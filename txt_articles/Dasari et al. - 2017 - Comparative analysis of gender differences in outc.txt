AbstrAct
Introduction While females generally have better 
outcomes than males after traumatic injury, higher 
mortality has been shown to occur in females after 
intentional trauma in lower-income countries. However, 
gender differences in trauma outcomes in different 
countries have not been previously compared. We 
conducted a two-country comparative analysis to 
characterise gender differences in mortality for different 
mechanisms of injury.
Methods Two urban trauma databases were analysed 
from India and the USA for fall, motor vehicle collision 
(MVC) and assault patients between 2013 and 2015. 
Coarsened exact matching was used to match the two 
groups based on gender, age, injury severity score, 
Glasgow Coma Score and type of injury (blunt vs 
penetrating). The primary outcome of mortality was studied 
by using logistic regression to calculate the odds of death 
in the four country/gender subgroups.
results A total of 10 089 and 14 144 patients were 
included from the Indian and US databases, respectively. 
After matching on covariates, 7505 and 9448 patients were 
included in the logistic regression. Indian males had the 
highest odds of death compared with US males, US females 
and Indian females for falls, MVC and assaults. Indian 
females had over 7 times the odds of dying after falls, 5 
times the odds of dying for MVC and 40 times the odds of 
dying after assaults when compared with US females.
conclusion The high odds of death for Indian females 
compared with US females suggests that there are other 
injury and systemic factors that contribute to this discrepancy 
in mortality odds. This same mortality pattern and implication 
is seen for Indian males compared with all subgroups. 
Standardised coding of injury mechanism in trauma 
registries, in addition to intentionality of injury, can help 
further characterise discrepancies in outcomes by gender 
and country, to guide targeted injury prevention and care.
IntroductIon
Over 90% of traumatic injuries occur in 
low-middle income countries, yet most of 
the data regarding the presentation and 
outcomes of patients in these countries are not 
captured in registries.1–3 Trauma registries are 
a critical component of monitoring outcomes 
and directing quality improvement, especially 
in low-resource settings.4 Several compara-
tive studies have been conducted to analyse 
factors leading to discrepancies in trauma 
outcomes between high and lower-income 
countries.5–7 Injury mechanism, differences 
in clinical interventions and the presence 
or absence of regional trauma systems have 
been cited as some of the elements contrib-
uting to observed differences in outcomes.5–7 
Comparing outcomes in different countries 
can help guide injury prevention and trauma 
care improvement initiatives.6 However, there 
have been no prior studies examining gender 
differences in trauma outcomes between 
countries. Thus, knowledge of how to 
approach gender-based differences in trauma 
outcomes on a global scale is lacking.
Gender differences after trauma have 
been previously studied, mostly in the USA. 
Females in the USA have been shown to have 
fewer complications and lower mortality 
after trauma than similarly injured males in 
a nationwide sample.8 A state-based study 
confirmed that female gender did not 
adversely affect mortality after adjusting for 
age and injury severity.9 A hormonal basis has 
even been implicated in the observed better 
outcomes after trauma-associated sepsis in 
females compared with males in the USA.10 
However, such detailed analyses of gender 
differences after trauma have been limited to 
higher-income countries such as the USA.
In lower/middle income countries (LMICs), 
several retrospective studies have revealed 
significantly higher mortality among female

patients with trauma compared with males, most notably 
among patients with burn.11–13 However, these studies 
have not adjusted for demographics and injury severity in 
making comparisons between males and females. Addi-
tionally, there have been no studies examining mortality 
across gender based on mechanism of injury in different 
countries. Studying gender differences after trauma in 
different countries is an important step towards improved 
injury prevention, given that gender-based violence is 
prevalent in both high-income and lower-income coun-
tries.14 Given this, our aim was to conduct a two-country 
comparative analysis to characterise gender differences 
in mortality for different mechanisms of injury between a 
high-income and lower-income country.
Methods
description of databases
The two trauma databases were analysed from India and 
the USA. The Indian database was developed through 
a research consortium initiative, ‘Towards Improving 
Trauma Care Outcomes’ (India), and contains exclusively 
data of patients with trauma from four hospitals in the 
three largest megacities (population>10 million inhabi-
tants) in India: Kolkata (Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial 
Hospital), Mumbai (King Edwards Memorial Hospital 
and Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital) and 
Delhi (the Apex Trauma Centre of the All-India Insti-
tute of Medical Sciences). The first two are large public 
hospitals that provide care, including trauma, to the 
lower socioeconomic strata. The Apex Trauma Centre is 
a public-funded standalone trauma hospital. The data-
base contains data from 2013 to 2015. There are other 
public hospitals in each of the cities which are not part 
of the study, and thus the patients are a proportion of all 
the patients with trauma in the three cities. However, as 
the three included are the major public hospitals in the 
three cities, they share a large burden of the patients with 
trauma.
The US database is from one of three level 1 trauma 
centres in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a medium-size city 
with over 305 000 inhabitants. The database contains 
all patients with trauma admitted to this centre, with 
the exception of patients with burn, who are seen at a 
different trauma centre in the city, and any patient who 
was dead at the scene prior to transport to the hospital. 
The trauma centre is one of two major centres in Pitts-
burgh, and receives the majority of the trauma in the 
city. Data were extracted from 2013 to 2015 to match the 
study period of the Indian database. The US database is 
a single-centre database versus the Indian database which 
is multicentre.
data
Variables common to both databases extracted for anal-
ysis were age, gender, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow 
Coma Scale (GCS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), type of 
injury (blunt vs penetrating) and in-hospital mortality. 
In the case of intubated patients, the verbal part of 
the GCS was recorded as for one in the Indian cohort. 
The same was done in the US database. The top three 
mechanisms of injury were analysed: falls, motor vehicle 
collisions (MVC) and assaults. In the Indian registry, this 
had been precoded as ‘Mechanism of Injury’ with the 
following options: fall, railway collision, road traffic colli-
sion, assault, burn, other. In the US database, there was 
no specific categorical variable for mechanism of injury. 
Thus, we generated a binary variable to represent those 
three types of injury by including all patients who had 
an ICD-9 E code (International Classification of Diseases, 
External Causes of Injury) whose Manner/Intent was 
either a fall, MVC or assault. The former two included 
both unintentional and intentional mechanisms under 
the same variable.
statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14 (Stata 
2015. Stata Statistical software: Release 14). Variables were 
summarised by country and gender using descriptive 
statistics. Variables were then compared using Χ2 for 
categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis for continuous 
Summary Box
What is already known about this topic?
 
► Ninety per cent of deaths due to trauma worldwide occurs in lower/
middle income countries (LMICs).
 
► Higher mortality from trauma in LMICs attributed to differences in 
injury mechanisms, and the presence or absence of prehospital and 
trauma systems.
 
► Males usually have worse morbidity and mortality following trauma 
than females in the USA.
 
► Females often have worse mortality than males in lower-income 
countries after intentional trauma.
What are the new findings?
 
► Females in India who were assaulted had nearly 40 times the odds 
of mortality compared with similarly injured female assault patients 
in the USA, accounting for the largest difference in odds of mortality 
between either gender in either country.
 
► Males and females in the higher-income country (USA) usually 
had five to seven times lower odds of mortality than their similarly 
injured counterparts in a lower-income country (India) for falls and 
motor vehicle collisions.
 
► Indian males had the highest overall odds of mortality for all 
mechanisms of injury among all genders and both countries.
recommendations for policy
 
► Our findings highlight an important, previously unpublished 
discrepancy in gender outcomes after trauma, especially for female 
patients who presented for trauma care after sustaining assault.
 
► Trauma clinical care providers, including developing/existing 
prehospital care systems, should be aware of the potential social 
and/or societal reasons for this mortality discrepancy.
 
► Our findings support the need for trauma registries to develop 
standardised coding mechanisms for mechanism and intentionality 
of injury in order to elucidate additional reasons for mortality 
discrepancies that may not be related to clinical care or injury 
severity.

variables. We examined all variables between the two 
countries, with subanalyses according to gender. All 
analyses were carried out with a 95% confidence level 
(p value<0.05 considered significant).
The coarsened exact matching (CEM) method was 
employed in order to achieve a rough match between 
the two databases prior to comparative analysis.15 Given 
that the nature of the populations being analysed were so 
different at baseline, in terms of demographic variables 
and injury severity, this method was chosen instead of a 
traditional one-to-one matching method. CEM matches 
two datasets based on user-determined ranges of values 
for each variable, which are called strata.15 CEM matches 
observations that are within the same strata for every vari-
able that is included in the match. Thus, CEM ensures that 
matched observations, in this case, patients, have values 
within a similar range for each covariate of interest. The 
quality of the match achieved after CEM can be evaluated 
using the L1 parameter, which is a marker of imbalance 
between two groups in terms of their covariates. Thus, 
a decrease in L1 indicates improvement in imbalance 
between the group groups after matching.15 Of note, 
CEM only matches subjects that do not have missing 
values for any of the specific variables; thus, if subjects 
are missing data points for any of the variables, they are 
excluded from the match. This precluded the need for a 
method to handle missing data values, as it is inherently 
part of the CEM algorithm.
The datasets were matched on the following variables: 
gender, age, ISS, GCS and type of injury (blunt vs pene-
trating). We employed logistic regression with the primary 
outcome of mortality, adjusted for the variables on which the 
databases were already matched. The results of the logistic regres-
sion model were used to calculate the odds of death in the four 
country/gender subgroups.
results
Between 2013 and 2015, the Indian and US databases 
contained 11 670 and 14 155 patients, respectively. After 
exclusion of railway and burn injuries, there were 10 089 
Indian and 14 144 US patients included. The coarsened 
exacting matching procedure resulted in a matched 
cohort of 7505 Indian and 9448 US patients. The multi-
variate L1 distance was 0.891 before matching and 0.601 
after matching, indicating improvement in imbalance 
between the two groups after matching. Both groups still 
remained significantly different across most variables 
before and after CEM (table 1).
On examining the differences between males and 
females in each country across key demographic and 
outcome variables, gender differences were found in 
the prevalence of blunt versus penetrating injury, the 
prevalence of surgical intervention after trauma, days 
of ventilation and trauma mortality (table 2). Notably, 
males incurred significantly more trauma than females 
in both countries (Χ2 test p value<0.05, table 2). Indian 
males had significantly higher rates of surgical inter-
vention than Indian females, while US females had 
significantly higher rates of surgical intervention than US 
males (table 2). US males had significantly longer ventila-
tion time periods than US females, and had significantly 
higher mortality rates than US females as well (3.3% vs 
2.5%, table 2). While overall mortality among Indian

females was grossly higher than among Indian males 
(28.2% vs 26.2%, respectively), this difference was not 
statistically significant.
Within the matched cohort, odds of mortality among 
the four subgroups (Indian males, Indian females, US 
males, US females) was highest for Indian males across all 
three leading mechanisms of injury (table 3). Among US 
patients, males had roughly three times the odds of death 
after falls compared with females (p<0.05). However, the 
differences in odds for mortality were not significant 
for MVC and assault injuries. Among Indian patients, 
females had lower adjusted odds of mortality compared 
with males across all three injury types.
Between gender groups in both countries, Indian males 
and females had three to seven higher odds of mortality 
compared with their US counterparts for almost all mech-
anisms of injury (table 3). Within the assaults category, 
Indian females had over five times the odds of mortality 
compared with US males, whereas US females had only 
0.13 times the odds of death compared with US males. 
This difference in odds of death for females in India and 
the US after assaults was the largest difference in odds 
among all subgroups and injury mechanisms.
Further characterisation of the assault injuries based 
on type of injury (blunt vs penetrating mechanism) 
revealed that Indian males with blunt assault injuries 
had higher mortality while Indian females with pene-
trating assault injuries had higher mortality (table 4). No 
significant difference was observed in mortality between 
US males and females. Indian females with penetrating 
assault injury had the highest mortality (13%) despite 
having the lowest injury severity for penetrating injuries 
when compared with Indian males, as well as US males 
and females.

dIscussIon
This two-country comparative analysis of patients with 
trauma in India and the USA is the first study to examine 
differences in trauma outcomes based on gender between 
a high-income and lower-income country. Our findings 
confirm previous literature citing increased mortality 
after trauma in lower-income countries.5 Additionally, 
our matched analysis revealed significant differences in 
outcomes based on gender, with higher adjusted odds of 
mortality in males compared with females in both coun-
tries. These odds differences were significant in patients 
sustaining falls in the USA, and across all three mecha-
nisms of injury in India.
Prior literature has shown that males tend to have 
higher adjusted morbidity and mortality after trauma 
compared with females.8 Whether this is due to differ-
ences in recovery after injury or differences in trauma 
mechanisms has not been clarified in the literature, 
although molecular differences in response to injury have 
been implicated.10 Our data suggest that these gender 
mortality differences persist in both higher-income and 
lower-income country settings. Indian males have been 
shown to be involved in the majority of fatal MVCs in 
India.16 The high odds of death for Indian males across 
all groups from our data implies that injury mechanisms 
may be significantly worse for males in a lower-income 
country than females in the same country and males 
in a higher-income country. The data, combined with 
established evidence about fatality from MVCs in LMICs, 
suggest that males may be involved in more high-speed 
collisions, resulting in more fatal injuries and higher 
mortality. Additionally, while the Indian cohort was on 
average about two decades younger than the US cohort, 
they had higher mortality; however, this is consistent with 
the fact that the median age of the Indian population is 
27 years of age, while that of the USA is 38 years of age.17
Interestingly, after examining differences within 
genders between two countries, our data reveal new 
discrepancies. While both males and females in India 
had higher odds of mortality than their US counterparts, 
Indian female assault patients had a 40 times higher odds 
of death than US females (table 4). This odds difference 
was unparalleled among any of the other subgroups 
and mechanisms of injury. This finding raises several 
questions, many of which cannot be answered given the 
current limitations in how trauma registries document 
intentionality of injury. For instance, is this difference in 
mortality attributable to potential delay between injury 
time and medical attention, along with limited prehos-
pital care services and access to affordable surgical care? 
The potential demographic and social variables contrib-
uting to this discrepancy are not currently quantified in 
registries in both high-income and low-income countries. 
In terms of social variables, there is data showing that 
domestic violence contributes to a significant percentage 
of female trauma patients presenting in high-income 
and low-income countries.18–20 Multiple strong sources 
of evidence suggest that only one in four women in 
India seek care services related to experiencing inti-
mate partner violence.21 22 While present data cannot 
be conclusive, time to care may indeed be prolonged in 
cases of intentional injury and gender-based violence.
Our study suggests that, even after adjustment for 
demographic and injury severity variables in a matched 
sample, significant differences persist between males and 
females in a high-income and lower-income country. The 
multitude of prehospital and clinical care variables that 
are not captured in current registries may explain these 
differences. For example, registries that include compre-
hensive complication and infection data could be used 
to assess which clinical factors may be leading to discrep-
ancies in observed in-hospital mortality between genders 
and countries. This concepts can be encompassed under 
the broader concept of trauma system development that 
is the goal of many trauma quality improvement initia-
tives in lower-resource countries.23 The institution of 
trauma care protocols in lower-resource countries has 
been shown to improve clinical outcomes.24 25 However, 
one of the largest barriers to trauma research and 
quality improvement in such settings is the absence of 
established prehospital care systems.26 This makes data 
collection of prehospital variables, such as delay between 
time of injury to hospital attention, difficult.
With recent discussion in the global trauma care 
community about the utility of an international trauma 
registry,27 we suggest that an international coding system 
for prehospital delay and intentional injury in trauma 
information systems also take place concurrently. A 
systematic method for screening and recording of time 
between injury to arrival and intentional injury is sorely 
needed in trauma registries, in both developed coun-
tries and LMICs. The current method of documentation, 
if it occurs at all, is most likely incomplete, given our 
inability to directly calculate intentional injury estimates 
from trauma registry samples. However, the collection of 
such data could be powerful and facilitate deeper analysis 
into some of the trends uncovered by our analysis, such 
as discrepancies between adjusted mortality for males 
in India compared with the USA, as well as the 40 times 
higher odds of mortality for females sustaining assault 
injuries in India compared with the USA. Ultimately, 
availability of prehospital services and infrastructure, and 
subsequently data collecting capacity, in LMICs deter-
mines whether variables such as prehospital transport 
request time, depart time and hospital arrival time can 
be collected; in India, at present, the limited presence 
of prehospital precludes widespread capturing of these 
data points.
With regard to differences in intervention between 
the two countries, we saw significantly higher rates of 
surgical management of patients with trauma in India 
compared to the USA (table 1). Since that the data-
bases are not granular to this degree, we are unable to 
explain exactly why this is the case. In India, many MVCs 
and assault cases, because of the medico-legal nature of

case, are transferred to public hospitals. Additionally, 
many patients are transferred to public hospitals when 
they cannot afford surgical treatment in other private 
health facilities. Since the Indian cohort is based on 
public trauma centres, there could be a larger number 
of surgeries occurring given that these centres provide 
more tertiary level care to those who cannot afford private 
care or are referred up to such larger-volume hospitals 
for cases requiring operative management. Given the 
limited use of resources such as interventional radiology 
in such public hospitals in India, all these cases represent 
surgical procedures occurring in the operating room 
versus bedside procedures. The same is the case in the 
US database. Additionally, we saw a discrepancy between 
ISS and GCS severity in India and the USA, with mild 
ISS values in India despite significantly higher mortality. 
Indian public hospitals have limited resources and radio-
logical interventions such as CT, ultrasound and X-rays 
are not done routinely for patients with trauma unless 
in cases of severe injury. Hence, many internal injuries 
maybe missed and not recorded in the coding of ISS 
and GCS. Additionally, as autopsy reports are usually 
not used in the Indian cohort, any data internal injury 
findings would not be available. That is why even patients 
with higher ISS or higher GCS may have high mortality. 
Differences in specific resource utilisation for patients in 
different countries is a subject of much interest and rele-
vance to comparative trauma research worldwide.
This exploratory study is not without several limita-
tions. Given that the two databases were not standardised 
in the same way with regard to mechanism of injury, we 
had to adapt the US database to fit the mechanism of 
injuries coded in the Indian database, through ICD-9 
subgroup coding. It is possible that there were patients 
coded within the Indian database as ‘falls’ or ‘MVCs’ who 
were intentionally injured; however, this would not have 
been captured given that ‘assaults’ was its own category. 
This supports the need for standardised intentionality 
of injury coding in trauma registries, separate from the 
mechanism of injury variable. Additionally, the matching 
achieved from our CEM method was an imperfect match. 
This is largely attributable to the skewed distributions of 
nearly all the variables, such as age, injury severity and 
length of stay between the two databases. Finally, we are 
not able to currently test our hypotheses regarding the 
contribution of prehospital delay and intentionality of 
injury to the observed mortality differences given the 
limitations of the variables in the databases used, namely 
that the Indian database does not contain prehospital 
mortality. However, we believe that this analysis lays the 
groundwork for further data collection and analysis of 
gender differences after trauma, especially for assault 
injuries.
conclusIon
Our study revealed that both males and females in 
lower-income countries have higher adjusted mortality 
after falls, MVCs and assaults compared with their 
counterparts in a higher-income country. Additionally, 
intentionally injured females in a lower-income country 
were shown to have the highest relative odds of mortality 
compared with any other subgroup. This demonstrates 
the need for the collection of prehospital and inten-
tionality of injury data to elucidate mechanistic and 
sociodemographic reasons for these mortality differ-
ences. With the increased interest in building prehospital 
trauma capacity and trauma systems in lower-resource 
settings, we advocate for the need for data collection of 
prehospital and delay in care variables to further under-
stand discrepancies in trauma outcomes by gender.
