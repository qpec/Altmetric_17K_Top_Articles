OBJECTIVES: To examine associations of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) and other beverage 
intake during pregnancy with adiposity in midchildhood (median age of 7.7 years).
METHODS: We studied 1078 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort 
study. Exposures were sugary and nonsugary beverage intake assessed in the first and 
second trimesters of pregnancy by using a food frequency questionnaire. Main outcome 
measures were offspring overall adiposity (BMI z score, fat mass index [FMI, kg/m2] from 
dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry, and sum of subscapular [SS] and triceps [TR] 
skinfold thicknesses) and central adiposity (SS:TR ratio and waist circumference).
RESULTS: In the second trimester, mean (SD) SSB intake was 0.6 (0.9) servings per day. Thirty-
two percent of mothers were multiracial or people of color, 68% were college graduates, 
and 10% smoked during pregnancy. In midchildhood, mean (SD) BMI z score was 0.38 
(1.00), and the FMI was 4.4 (1.9) kg/m2. In multivariable models adjusted for multiple 
maternal and child covariates, each additional serving per day of SSB was associated with 
higher BMI z scores (0.07 U; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.01 to 0.15), FMI (0.15 kg/m2; 
95% CI: −0.01 to 0.30), SS + TR (0.85 mm; 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.64), and waist circumference 
(0.65 cm; 95% CI: 0.01 to 1.28). Stratified models suggested that the associations were due 
primarily to maternal, not child, SSB intake and to sugary soda rather than fruit drinks or 
juice. We did not find differences between boys and girls, nor did we observe the effects of 
sugar-free soda or of first-trimester beverage intake.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher SSB intake during the second trimester of pregnancy was associated 
with greater adiposity in midchildhood.

WhaT’s KnoWn on This subjecT: Maternal diet 
during pregnancy may entrain offspring obesity. 
One potential dietary factor is sugar-sweetened 
beverages, intake of which appears to cause obesity 
in children and adults.
WhaT This sTudy adds: In this prospective 
prebirth cohort study, school-aged children of 
mothers who consumed more sugary beverages 
in midpregnancy had higher levels of adiposity, 
measured by BMI, skinfold thicknesses, and dual-
energy radiograph absorptiometry.

One set of solutions for the 
worldwide childhood obesity 
pandemic emphasizes prevention 
in the early, plastic stages of human 
development, when the right cues 
could set lifelong trajectories of 
optimal health.1 Decades of animal 
experiments show that perturbations 
during early, sensitive periods of 
development affect fat deposition 
and development of cardiometabolic 
dysfunction.2 Many of these 
experiments comprise alterations 
in the diet of pregnant mothers, 
including reductions in energy or 
protein intake or, more recently, 
high fat diets, westernized diets, 
and high-sugar diets.3 
–5 Although 
these experiments provide proof of 
principle, the experimental energy 
and protein restriction tend to 
be out of the physiologic range of 
humans, many of the components 
of “overnutrition” diets in animal 
models do not have analogs in the 
human diet, and the variation in 
experimental paradigms make 
translation to the human condition 
indirect at best.6
In humans, it has been more 
challenging to demonstrate robust 
associations between the diets 
of pregnant women and obesity 
in their offspring. One reason is 
a focus on nutrients, akin to the 
animal studies, rather than foods. 
Although nutrient-based studies7 
– 
10 
may more closely approach causal 
mechanisms, foods are what people 
buy, cook, and eat, and thus food-
based recommendations are easier 
to “absorb.”7 
– 
10 In addition, dietary 
assessment begins with asking 
about foods; nutrient calculations 
rely on external databases as 
well as reported food intake, thus 
introducing multiple sources of 
error. Another reason is that few 
cohort studies with accurate dietary 
assessment in pregnancy have child 
follow-up to school age, 
11 when 
obesity becomes a good predictor of 
later adverse health outcomes, 
12  
and none, to our knowledge, have 
examined maternal beverage intake.
Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) 
intake is a prime target of obesity 
prevention and treatment strategies 
in nonpregnant adults and children. 
Numerous observational studies and 
meta-analyses in adults, and some 
among children, demonstrate that 
intake of SSBs predicts excess weight 
gain, obesity, metabolic syndrome, 
and type 2 diabetes.13 
– 
15 National 
and local policies are geared toward 
reducing consumption of sugary 
beverages, and in recent years in 
the United States (but not abroad), 
sugary soda consumption has begun 
to decline.15 
– 
18 Despite the clarity 
from observational studies, 2 recent 
intervention studies to reduce SSBs 
among children and adolescents, 
especially 1 among already 
overweight or obese adolescents, 
revealed only modest effects on 
weight-related outcomes, perhaps 
because physiologic plasticity is 
already waning at those ages.19 
–21 
Once obesity takes hold, physiologic, 
behavioral, and social forces 
tenaciously fight against weight 
control, even in childhood.22, 
 
23
The purpose of this study was to 
investigate associations of sugary and 
nonsugary beverage consumption 
during pregnancy with obesity-
related outcomes in midchildhood 
among mother-child pairs 
participating in the prebirth cohort 
study Project Viva.
MeThods
Between 1999 and 2002, we 
recruited women into Project 
Viva in early pregnancy from 8 
obstetric offices of Atrius Harvard 
Vanguard Medical Associates, a 
multispecialty group practice in 
eastern Massachusetts.24 Details 
of recruitment and retention are 
published.24 Of the 2128 women 
who delivered a live singleton infant, 
we excluded from this analysis 59 
participants with previous type 
1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or 
gestational diabetes in a previous 
pregnancy, 44 participants who were 
born before 34 weeks’ gestational 
age, and 947 participants who 
did not attend the midchildhood 
in-person visit. Thus, our sample 
size for analysis was 1078 mother-
child pairs. Compared with the 1078 
participants in this analysis, the 947 
nonparticipants were somewhat 
less likely to have college-educated 
mothers (62% vs 68%) and to have 
annual household income exceeding 
$70 000 (56% vs 61%), and the mean 
maternal age was slightly lower (31.5 
vs 32.1 years). Maternal race and/
or ethnicity (33% vs 32% multiracial 
or people of color) and BMI (mean of 
24.8 vs 24.6) and intake of second-
trimester SSBs (mean of 0.69 vs 0.63 
servings per day), however, were 
similar.
After obtaining written informed 
consent, we performed in-person 
study visits with participating 
mothers at the end of the first and 
second trimesters of pregnancy and 
with mothers and children during the 
first few days after delivery and in 
infancy (median age of 6.3 months), 
early childhood (median age of 3.2 
years), and midchildhood (median 
age of 7.7 years). Mothers completed 
mailed questionnaires at 1, 2, 4, 5, 
and 6 years of age. The institutional 
review boards of Harvard Pilgrim 
Health Care, Brigham and Women’s 
Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center approved the study 
protocols.
exposures
We obtained data on consumption 
of beverages during pregnancy from 
semiquantitative food frequency 
questionnaires (FFQs) that expectant 
mothers completed after the first and 
second research visits, at the mean 
(SD) gestational ages of 11.9 (3.5) 
and 29.2 (2.6) weeks. Each of the 2 
FFQs was slightly modified for use 
in pregnancy from a commonly used 
adult FFQ from which SSB intake

predicts a number of cardiometabolic 
outcomes.13 
– 
15, 
 
25, 
26 Participants 
endorsed categories of frequency of 
beverage consumption from “never/
less than 1 per month” to a maximum 
of “2 or more glasses per day” for 
some fruit juices, “4 or more cans 
per day” for soda, and “6 or more 
glasses per day” for water. The time 
referent for the first-trimester FFQ 
was “during this pregnancy, 
” that 
is, from the woman’s last menstrual 
period until she completed the 
FFQ. For the second-trimester FFQ, 
the time referent was the previous 
3 months. The FFQ included 3 
questions on regular (sugary) soda 
intake, 3 questions on sugar-free 
soda, 5 questions on fruit juice, 
1 question on fruit drinks, and 2 
questions on water. We defined SSBs 
as regular soda and fruit drinks. We 
also included fruit juice, sugar-free 
soda (diet soda), and water in our 
analyses. Although the FFQ included 
4 questions regarding the type of 
milk consumed, it did not include 
specific information about sweetened 
and flavored milk. Therefore, we did 
not include dairy products in this 
analysis, nor did we include tea or 
coffee, although these were queried 
on the FFQs.
outcome Measures
At the midchildhood visit (median 
age of 7.7 years, range of 6.6–10.9 
years), trained research staff 
measured each child’s height to 
the nearest 0.1 cm and weight to 
the nearest 0.1 kg with a calibrated 
stadiometer (Shorr Productions, 
Olney, MD) and calibrated scale 
(Tanita model TBF-300A; Tanita 
Corporation of America, Inc, 
Arlington Heights, IL). We calculated 
age- and sex-specific BMI z scores 
by using US national reference 
data.27 We also measured total fat 
mass with dual-energy radiograph 
absorptiometry (DXA) (Discovery 
A model; Hologic Inc, Marlborough, 
MA), and we calculated fat mass 
index (FMI) as fat mass in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared, 
analogous to BMI. We measured 
waist circumference to the nearest 
0.1 cm with a Hoechstmass 
measuring tape (Hoechstmass Balzer 
GmbH, Sulzbach, Germany), and 
subscapular skinfold thickness (SS) 
and triceps skinfold thickness (TR) 
to the nearest 0.1 mm with Holtain 
calipers (Holtain LTD, Crosswell, UK) 
and calculated their sum (SS + TR) 
and ratio (SS:TR). Research assistants 
performing all measurements 
followed standardized techniques28 
and participated in in-service training 
to ensure measurement validity (IJ 
Shorr; Shorr Productions). Inter- and 
intrarater measurement errors were 
within published reference ranges for 
all measurements.29
covariates
At each in-person and mailed visit 
from early pregnancy through the 
midchildhood outcome visit, as well 
as from outpatient and hospital 
medical records, we collected 
information on many potentially 
confounding, mediating, and 
moderating variables. We collected 
sociodemographic and medical data 
at enrollment, with regular updates. 
Mothers reported their age, race 
and/or ethnicity, education, parity, 
prepregnancy weight and height, 
and paternal weight and height. 
We calculated total gestational 
weight gain by subtracting self-
reported prepregnancy weight 
from the last prenatal weight from 
medical records. We calculated 
gestational age by using the date of 
the last menstrual period, but if the 
early second-trimester ultrasound 
assessment differed from the 
calculated gestational age by more 
than 10 days, we used the ultrasound 
dating instead. We obtained birth 
weight from medical records. At 
appropriate ages, mothers reported 
the number of hours their children 
spent in child care, timing of solid 
food introduction, breastfeeding 
duration, child diet, television 
viewing, and physical activity 
habits.30 
– 
32
To explore mediation or moderation 
by child’s beverage intake, we used 
data from a beverage frequency 
questionnaire that mothers 
completed at the midchildhood 
visit. This questionnaire, with 7 
response categories from “never” to 
“5 or more times per day” for each 
beverage, included 11 questions on 
milk intake, including flavored milk 
(which typically contains added 
sugars); 1 question each on regular 
and sugar-free soda; 2 questions on 
fruit juice; 1 question on fruit drinks; 
and 1 question on water. To facilitate 
consistency with the maternal 
prenatal report of beverage intake, 
in our primary analysis we did not 
include sweetened flavored milk 
in our calculations of child intake 
of SSBs. In a secondary analysis, 
inclusion of sweetened flavored 
milks did not materially change the 
findings.
data analysis
The main elements of our analytic 
approach included multivariable 
linear and logistic regression to 
account for confounding and to 
explore mediation, stratification to 
examine effect modification, and 
multiple imputation to compensate 
for missing data. Our primary 
exposure was beverage consumption 
in the second trimester of pregnancy, 
expressed as a continuous variable 
in regression models, but displayed 
as <0.5, 0.5 to <1, 1 to <2, 2 to <3, or 
at least 3 servings per day in tables. 
We also examined first-trimester 
intake and, additionally, the change 
from first to second trimester 
because preliminary data showed 
that changes in SSB consumption 
predicted gestational weight gain 
during the same period.33 Gestational 
weight gain itself is a predictor of 
offspring obesity in this and other 
populations.34 Main midchildhood 
outcomes included BMI z score, 
obesity, FMI, sum of SS + TR skinfolds 
3

 GILLMAN et al
for overall adiposity, and the ratio of 
SS:TR and waist circumference for 
central adiposity.
To examine exposure-outcome 
relationships, we initially examined 
exposures as categorical variables 
(quartiles). Because trends across 
quartiles were linear, we expressed 
exposures as continuous variables 
in regression models. We built 
multivariable linear regression 
models in which we adjusted for 
maternal age, race and/or ethnicity, 
education, smoking, parity, and 
prepregnancy BMI; household 
income; and child sex and exact 
age at the time of the midchildhood 
visit. Adding other potentially 
confounding variables, including 
maternal intake of fried food away 
from home, carbohydrates, fatty 
acids, total energy intake, fetal 
growth, breastfeeding duration, 
midchildhood sleep duration, 
television viewing, and physical 
activity, did not materially change 
the observed associations, so we 
did not include them in our final 
models. We did not adjust for 
gestational weight gain and fetal 
growth because they might be on the 
causal pathway and would be likely 
to attenuate the total associations. 
We also considered whether lack 
of covariate overlap between 
exposed (maternal SSB intake ≥2 
servings per day) and unexposed 
(<2 servings per day) drove results. 
We used propensity scores to define 
overlapping covariate values, or 
“common support.” We ran common-
support regression after excluding 
11 participants for whom 1 or the 
other exposure group provided few 
data, and results were similar.35 
To examine effect modification, 
we stratified adjusted models by 
maternal prepregnancy BMI, child 
sex, and child race and/or ethnicity 
in separate models. To examine 
the mediating or moderating 
effect of child beverage intake, we 
dichotomized both maternal and 
midchildhood sugary beverage 
intake at cut points defined post 
hoc by examination of the data and 
examined effects within each of the 
4 resulting strata; as an alternative 
approach, we added child intake as a 
covariate.
When including a single beverage 
as an exposure, these regression 
approaches essentially reveal 
the effect of adding servings of a 
beverage to one’s diet. We also 
explored effects of substituting each 
type of beverage for SSBs by fitting 
models that also included total 
beverage intake and all beverage 
types except SSBs. This type of model 
may more accurately reflect the 
common practice of drinking 1 type 
of beverage instead of another, rather 
than adding it to total fluid intake.36
To account for missing data, we 
performed multiple imputation for 
all 2128 mother-child pairs in Project 
Viva. We then limited the analysis 
to the 1078 included participants. 
We used SAS (Proc MI) to impute 50 
values for each missing observation 
and combined multivariable 
modeling estimates by using Proc 
MI ANALYZE in SAS version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC). An alternative 
approach, including only participants 
with all covariate data (complete 
cases), yielded similar results. 
Because we observed approximately 
linear effects across quartiles of 
intake, we reported regression 
estimates and their 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for each increment of 
1 serving per day of beverage intake 
as a continuous variable.
ResulTs
Mean (SD) maternal age at 
enrollment was 32.1 (5.4) years, 
prepregnancy BMI was 24.6 (5.2), 
and total gestational weight gain was 
15.6 (5.3) kg; 32% of the participants 
were multiracial or people of color, 
10% smoked during pregnancy, 68% 
were college graduates, and 39% had 
household incomes ≤$70 000 per 
year (Table 1).
In the second trimester, mean (SD, 
range) sugary beverage intake 
was 0.6 (0.9, 0.0–8.3) servings 
per day. Over half consumed <0.5 
servings per day, and fewer than 
10% drank more than 2 servings 
per day. Mean intakes of juice, diet 
soda, and water were 1.4, 0.1, and 
4.5 servings per day, respectively 
(Table 2).
Correlates of higher second-
trimester consumption of sugary 
beverages included younger maternal 
age, higher prepregnancy BMI, 
multicracial race and/or ethnicity, 
lower education and household 
income, smoking during pregnancy, 
shorter breastfeeding duration, and 
earlier introduction of solid foods 
(Table 1). In midchildhood, mean 
(SD) BMI z score was 0.38 (1.00) and 
272/1078 (25.2%) of the children 
were overweight or obese, that is, 
BMI exceeding the age-sex–specific 
85th percentile. These and the other 
adiposity outcomes were highest 
among children whose mothers 
consumed at least 2 servings per day 
of sugary beverages (Table 1). The 
Spearman correlation coefficient 
was 0.27 between maternal second-
trimester and child midchildhood 
consumption of sugary beverages, 
0.07 between maternal second-
trimester consumption and child 
midchildhood BMI z score, and 0.10 
between child consumption and BMI 
z score.
In multivariable models (Table 3), we 
found that maternal second-trimester 
intake of sugary beverages was 
related to all child overall adiposity 
and central adiposity outcomes. 
Unadjusted estimates (95% CIs) 
for each additional serving per day 
included 0.15 U (0.07 to 0.23) for 
BMI z score, 0.31 kg/m2 (0.15 to 
0.47) for FMI, 1.76 mm (0.94 to 2.59) 
for SS + TR, 2.12 (0.65 to 3.60) for 
SS:TR, and 1.47 cm (0.79 to 2.15) for 
waist circumference. These estimates 
were attenuated by adjusting for 
sociodemographic variables and 
maternal prepregnancy BMI and 
4

smoking. For example, the adjusted 
estimate (95% CI) for BMI z score 
was 0.07 U (−0.01 to 0.15) and for 
FMI was 0.15 kg/m2 (−0.01 to 0.30). 
In logistic regression, the adjusted 
odds ratio (OR) for childhood BMI 
exceeding the 85th percentile was 
1.14 (0.95 to 1.36).
Only maternal consumption of SSBs 
(0.07 U; −0.01 to 0.15), not juice, diet 
soda, or water, was associated with 
BMI z score (Table 4). Between the 2

types of sugary beverages, maternal 
intake of soda demonstrated the 
stronger association (0.11 U; −0.02 
to 0.23) than did fruit drinks (0.06 
U; −0.05 to 0.17), although CIs were 
wide and crossed 0. Estimates for 
juice 0.01 (−0.05 to 0.06), diet soda 
0.07 (−0.05 to 0.18), and water 0.00 
(−0.03 to 0.03) were null. DXA FMI 
results (Table 5) were similar to BMI 
z score results (Table 4).
We did not observe different effects 
among offspring of overweight or 
obese (BMI ≥25) versus normal-
weight mothers (interaction P value = 
.88), or boys versus girls (interaction 
P value = .25), or children of white 
versus African American versus other 
race and/or ethnicity (interaction  
P value = .12) (Table 4). In addition, 
including child beverage intake 
in the models did not appreciably 
attenuate the estimates (Tables 
3– 
5). For example, the associations 
of maternal SSB intake and BMI z 
score (0.07 U; −0.01 to 0.15) and FMI 
(0.15 kg/m2; −0.01 to 0.30) were 
the same before and after adjusting 
for child SSB intake. In these models, 
each additional SSB serving per 
day in children was not associated 
with BMI z score (−0.04 U; −0.13 
to 0.05) or total FMI (0.00 kg/m2; 
−0.17 to 0.17). In logistic regression, 
the adjusted OR for childhood BMI 
≥85th percentile was the same before 
and after adjusting for child SSB 
intake (OR: 1.14; 0.95 to 1.36). In 
this model, including both maternal 
and child intake, each additional SSB 
serving per day in children was not 
associated with BMI ≥85th percentile 
(OR: 1.01; 0.81 to 1.25).
Furthermore, models stratified 
simultaneously according to maternal 
and child intake suggested that the 
associations were primarily driven 
by maternal intake, although some of 
the CIs were wide and overlapping 
(Fig 1). We examined maternal intake 
of at least versus <2 servings per day 
and child intake of at least versus 
<0.5 servings per week and their 
interaction. Compared with lower 
intakes in both mother and child, 
higher intake in children alone was 
associated with a higher BMI z score of 
0.08 (95% CI: −0.06 to 0.22) whereas 
higher maternal intake was associated 
with BMI z score increments of 0.22 
(−0.37 to 0.80) and 0.29 (0.01 to 0.56) 
among children with lower and higher 
intakes, respectively (Fig 1A).

In secondary analyses, first-
trimester sugary beverage intake 
was not associated with any of the 
midchildhood outcomes (data not 
shown). However, change in intake 
from first to second trimester 
was associated with all of the 
outcomes, with effect estimates 
similar to those for the second 
trimester alone. For example, 
adjusted estimates (95% CIs) for 
each increase in 1 serving per day 
of SSBs were 0.07 (0.00 to 0.15) 
for childhood BMI z score and 0.19 
(0.04 to 0.35) for FMI.
In addition, in substitution analyses, 
we found that replacing maternal 
second-trimester SSBs with water, 
100% fruit juice, or milk had a 
greater beneficial effect on child BMI 
z score (−0.07 [−0.15 to 0.01], −0.08 
[−0.19 to 0.03], or −0.10 [−0.19 to 
−0.01] per increment of 1 serving per 
day, respectively) than did replacing 
SSBs with diet soda (−0.02 [−0.16 to 
0.13]).

discussion
In this prospective prebirth cohort 
study, school-aged children of 
mothers who consumed more sugary 
beverages in midpregnancy had 
higher levels of adiposity, measured 
by BMI, skinfold thicknesses, and 
the reference standard DXA. After 
adjustment for multiple covariates, 
each additional serving of a sugary 
beverage consumed by a mother 
during the second trimester was 
associated with an additional 0.15 
kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.01 to 0.30) of fat 
mass. The associations were robust 
to adjustment for many confounding 
variables, were independent of the 
children’s beverage intake, and 
did not differ by child sex or race 
and/or ethnicity. We did not find 
associations with intakes of diet 
soda or water, or with any first-
trimester beverage consumption. 
These findings suggest that efforts to 
limit SSB consumption once women 
become pregnant could help stem the 
tide of childhood obesity.
The paradigm of developmental 
origins of health and disease posits 
that cues during early, plastic phases 
of human development can have 
lifelong consequences for obesity and 
chronic disease.37 Because such cues 
can determine a trajectory of long-
term health, and because plasticity 
wanes with age, interventions to 
alter health trajectories become more 
difficult as fetuses become children 
and children become adults.38 Given 
the combination of physiologic, 
behavioral, and social barriers, weight 
control after the onset of obesity is 
particularly challenging, implying that 
early prevention is paramount.
Maternal diet during pregnancy, as 
1 element of the “fetal supply line, 
” 
may supply sufficient developmental 
cues to offer effective prevention 
of obesity in the offspring. The few 
animal experiments that address 
beverage or added sugar consumption 
in pregnancy provide support for 
our observations, but they may not 
directly translate to humans.39 
–43 
In children and nonpregnant 
adults, higher consumption of 
sugary beverages consistently 
predicts excess weight gain, and 
randomized trials suggest that 
reducing their intake can at least 
modestly contribute to prevention 
or treatment of obesity.19 
– 
21, 
 
44 The 
human literature on health outcomes 
related to maternal beverage intake 
in pregnancy, however, is scant. 
In the Nurses’ Health Study II, 
consumption of sugar-sweetened 
cola before pregnancy was associated 
with risk of developing gestational 
diabetes, although in a previous 
Project Viva analysis, we found 
no relationships between first-
trimester glycemic index, glycemic 
load, carbohydrates, or Western 
diet pattern (which includes sugary 
beverages) and development of 
gestational diabetes.25, 
 
45 In the large 
Norwegian Mother-Child cohort study 
and in the smaller Born-in-Bradford 
study, higher intake of sugary 
beverages predicted increased risk 
of preterm birth.46 
– 
48 The Norwegian 
investigators also reported a direct 
association between sugary beverage 
intake and preeclampsia.49 
– 
51 In 
contrast, in the Danish National 
Birth Cohort, investigators found no 
relationship with preterm birth.52

among the 6-month-old infants of 
overweight or obese mothers (N = 
121) but not among infants of normal 
weight mothers (N = 128). Among 
66 mother-infant pairs of Hispanic 
ethnicity in Texas, Watt et al54 found 
that maternal sugary beverage intake 
was directly associated with weight for 
length exceeding the 85th percentile 
during infancy. However, in a much 
larger study of Canadian mother-infant 
pairs, Azad et al55 found no association 
of intake of sugary beverages in late 
pregnancy with risk of overweight 
at 1 year of age. In comparison with 
those 3 studies, the outcomes in our 
study were in midchildhood, when 
BMI more strongly predicts adverse 
adult outcomes.12, 
56 We examined 
substitution as well as addition effects, 
and we employed direct measures 
of adiposity in addition to height and 
weight.
One key question with any study 
of maternal behavior and offspring 
health is the extent to which the 
same behavior in the child explains 
the findings. Maternal beverage 
intake could be related to child 
intake via 3 pathways. First, in the 
postnatal period, mothers provide 
food for their children and serve as 
role models for behaviors.57 Second, 
an inherited genetic predilection 
for certain beverages could exist.58 
Third, maternal intake in pregnancy 
could program child’s intake, 
perhaps via mechanisms related to 
“fuel-mediated teratogenesis.” 
59 
Distinguishing among these 3 
possibilities is difficult in a single 
study. Nevertheless, our findings 
from stratified analyses that indicate 
that maternal intake was more 
strongly related to the outcomes than 
was child intake lend credence to the 
hypothesis that the observed effects 
are due to prenatal programming of 
susceptibility to obesity. In addition, 
we observed effects for second-
trimester beverage intake, when fetal 
fat accumulation is accelerating, but 
not for intakes earlier in pregnancy.
Some evidence suggests that 
artificially sweetened beverages 
(even those without calories) can 
lead to increased consumption of 
food and therefore excess weight 
gain that is intermediate between 
unsweetened beverages and SSBs.60 
In both the Norwegian and Danish 
cohorts, higher consumption of 
artificially sweetened beverages 
was associated with increased 
risk of preterm birth, 
47, 
 
52 and in 
the Canadian cohort, with risk 
of overweight at 1 year of age.55 
However, we did not find that 
maternal diet soda intake was 
associated with offspring adiposity.
Strengths of this study include 
prospective data collection since 
early pregnancy; robust dietary 
assessment at 2 points in pregnancy; 
availability of numerous covariates 
to address confounding, mediation, 
and moderation; research-standard 
adiposity outcomes; and a sample 
size that allowed precise estimates 
of effect, at least for continuous 
outcomes. Limitations include 
self-report of diet, but resulting 
misclassification may well be 
nondifferential leading to bias toward 
the null, a conservative bias. We 
did not measure beverage intake 
in exactly the same way in mothers 
during pregnancy and in their 
children, but there was sufficient 
overlap for consistency, and the 2 
were moderately correlated. Loss to 
follow-up, although regrettable, is 
common in cohort studies in early 
life. We observed some differences 
in baseline covariates between 
participants and those lost to 
follow-up, but adjustment for those 
variables did not alter the conclusions. 
In addition, we did not observe 
differences in baseline maternal 
beverage intake. These factors argue 
against selection bias as a major threat 
to validity of the findings.
conclusions
Prevention strategies at the earliest 
stages of human development, 
including before birth, hold 
promise for prevention of obesity 
and noncommunicable diseases 
across the life course.37 In this 
study, we found that mothers who 
consumed more sugary beverages 
in midpregnancy had children with 
greater levels of adiposity. Women 
may be more amenable to behavior 
change when they are pregnant 
than when they are not.61 Combined 
with our results, this observation 
provides impetus to examine the 
long-term effects of interventions 
to reduce sugary beverage intake 
during pregnancy. In the United 
States, reductions in overall sugary 
beverage intake over the past decade, 
combined with hopeful results from 
some randomized trials of behavior 
change in pregnant women, 
62, 
 
63 make 
efforts to reduce sugary beverages in 
pregnancy a realistic goal. In low- and 
middle-income countries, however, 
where sugary beverage intake 
continues to rise along with the rapid 
emergence of obesity, and resources 
are lacking for individual-level 
behavior change interventions during 
gestation, the challenges are great.
