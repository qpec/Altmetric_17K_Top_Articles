Introduction
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative 
therapy for hematological malignancies (i.e., leukemia and lym-
phoma), owing to graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects 
mediated by alloreactive T cells. These same T cells also mediate 
acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the subsequent devel-
opment of chronic GVHD (1–5). Both alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells can mediate acute GVHD, and Th1 and Th17 cells play a 
critical role in initiating gut GVHD (6–10). While flow cytometry–
sorted donor CD4+ T cells mediate severe GVHD through expres-
sion of FASL and production of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., 
IFN-γ and TNF-α) (10, 11), sorted donor CD8+ T cells prevent graft 
rejection and mediate GVL effects through their expression of per-
forin/granzyme, without causing acute clinical GVHD in several 
mouse models (12, 13). However, the mechanisms whereby puri-
fied alloreactive CD8+ T cells mediate GVL effect without causing 
GVHD remain largely unknown.
Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1, also known as B7H1) 
functions as an immune checkpoint that interacts with pro-
grammed death-1 (PD-1) and CD80 (14, 15). PD-L1 is usually 
expressed by hematopoietic cells and by parenchymal cells under 
inflammatory cytokine (i.e., IFN-γ) induction (16). CD80 is con-
stitutively expressed by T cells and is upregulated early after T 
cell activation (17), whereas PD-1 is expressed by T cells late after 
T cell activation (18). PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 induces aner-
gy, exhaustion, and apoptosis of activated T cells (19, 20); on the 
other hand, PD-L1/CD80 interaction has been reported to inhibit 
CD28/CTLA4-deficient T cell proliferation in vitro (15).
Expression of PD-L1 in recipient tissues decreases the severity 
of GVHD in allogeneic recipients conditioned with conventional 
total body irradiation (21–23), while expression of PD-L1 by donor 
T cells increases the severity of GVHD by augmenting the expan-
sion and survival of donor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (24). We recent-
ly showed that the interaction of PD-L1 with CD80 in the absence 
of PD-1 worsened GVHD by augmenting alloreactive CD4+ T cell 
proliferation and expansion, although simultaneous interactions 
of PD-L1 with both CD80 and PD-1 ameliorated GVHD by aug-
menting apoptosis of activated alloreactive CD4+ T cells (25).
Regulation of anergy, exhaustion, and apoptosis through 
PD-L1 interactions with CD80 and PD-1 on CD8+ T cells in alloge-
neic HCT has not yet been well characterized. Our previous stud-
ies showed that the absence of host-tissue expression of PD-L1 
contributed to expansion of infiltrating CD8+ T cells in GVHD tar-
get tissues in recipients with GVHD and lymphopenia (21). Oth-
er investigators have shown that host-tissue expression of PD-L1 
caused exhaustion of alloreactive CD8+ T cells and reduced GVL 
Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) interacts with programmed death-1 (PD-1) and the immunostimulatory molecule CD80 
and functions as a checkpoint to regulate immune responses. The interaction of PD-L1 with CD80 alone has been shown to 
exacerbate the severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas costimulation of CD80 and PD-1 ameliorates GVHD. 
Here we have demonstrated that temporary depletion of donor CD4+ T cells early after hematopoietic cell transplantation 
effectively prevents GVHD while preserving strong graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in allogeneic and xenogeneic 
murine GVHD models. Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells increased serum IFN-γ but reduced IL-2 concentrations, leading to 
upregulation of PD-L1 expression by recipient tissues and donor CD8+ T cells. In GVHD target tissues, the interactions of  
PD-L1 with PD-1 on donor CD8+ T cells cause anergy, exhaustion, and apoptosis, thereby preventing GVHD. In lymphoid 
tissues, the interactions of PD-L1 with CD80 augment CD8+ T cell expansion without increasing anergy, exhaustion, or 
apoptosis, resulting in strong GVL effects. These results indicate that the outcome of PD-L1–mediated signaling in CD8+ T 
cells depends on the presence or absence of CD4+ T cells, the nature of the interacting receptor expressed by CD8+ T cells, and 
the tissue environment in which the signaling occurs.

leukemia activity of donor CD8+ T cells

evaluated the impact of temporary in vivo CD4+ T cell depletion on 
GVL effects against BCL1 tumor cells (29). BALB/c recipients con-
ditioned with total body irradiation were injected with luciferase- 
transfected BCL1 cells (BCL1/Luc, 5 × 106 per mouse) together 
with T cell–depleted bone marrow (TCD-BM, 2.5 × 106) alone or 
TCD-BM plus spleen cells (5 × 106). Recipients given spleen cells 
were treated with anti-CD4 or control rat IgG on days 0, 14, and 
28 after HCT. BCL1/Luc tumor cell–bearing recipients transplant-
ed with TCD-BM alone all died with progressive tumor growth by 
20 days after HCT (Figure 1, A–D). Recipients transplanted with 
BM and spleen cells and treated with control rat IgG eliminated 
BCL1/Luc tumor cells by 12 days after HCT, but all died with acute 
GVHD and severe diarrhea by 20 days after HCT. In contrast, 
recipients treated with anti-CD4 eliminated the tumor cells by 12 
days after HCT, and all recipients survived for more than 100 days 
with mild and transient signs of GVHD (P < 0.001; Figure 1, A–D). 
These results indicate that in vivo depletion of donor CD4+ T cells 
early after HCT preserves GVL effects while preventing GVHD.
Leukemia and lymphoma cells also infiltrate liver tissues. 
In vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI) indicated that tumor load 
started to decrease by day 7 and disappeared by day 12 after HCT 
(Figure 1, A and B). In addition, as compared with recipients giv-
en TCD-BM alone, anti-CD4–treated recipients showed mild 
and transient signs of acute GVHD, peaking at day 7 (Figure 1C). 
Thus, we tested whether CD8+ T cell–mediated GVL activity was 
associated with hepatocyte damage. We compared serum aspar-
tate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations in anti-CD4–treated 
recipients with or without the presence of BCL1 cells. On day 7 
after HCT, anti-CD4–treated recipients with BCL1 cells had sig-
nificantly elevated serum AST concentrations as compared with 
recipients without BCL1 (P < 0.01; Figure 1E). By day 12, AST con-
centrations returned to normal, and no difference was observed 
among anti-CD4–treated recipients with or without BCL1 inocu-
lation and recipients given TCD-BM alone. These results indicate 
that the GVL effect of CD8+ T cells is associated with mild hepato-
cyte damage, but this damage is self-limited and disappears after 
tumor cell eradication.
Second, we tested the GVL capacity of this regimen by 
using “GVL-resistant” blast-crisis chronic myelogenous leuke-
mia (BC-CML) in C57BL/6 background. Murine BC-CML cells 
obtained from W. Shlomchik (University of Pittsburgh) were 
generated by retroviral transfer of bcr-abl and NUP98/HOXA9 
fusion cDNAs. Like human BC-CML, murine BC-CML was rel-
atively GVL resistant. At certain cell doses, allogeneic CD8+ T 
cells were not able to rescue recipients inoculated with BC-CML 
cells, although identical numbers of CD8+ T cells rescued almost 
all recipients inoculated with the same number of chronic-phase 
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CP-CML) cells (30).
Accordingly, A/J BM (10 × 106) and spleen cells (10 × 106) were 
transplanted into lethally irradiated (1,100 cGy) C57BL/6 recipi-
ents (31). The recipients were challenged with an i.v. injection 
of BC-CML (20 × 103 cells per mouse) at the time of HCT (30). 
The tumor cells killed all (12 of 12) GVHD-free recipients given 
TCD-BM alone within 30 days, and moribund mice had high per-
centages of BC-CML cells in the spleen, liver, and BM (Figure 2, 
A and B, and Supplemental Figure 6A). In contrast, tumor cells 
were eliminated in IgG-treated GVHD recipients, although they 
effects in GVHD recipients (26, 27). However, it was reported that 
in vivo expansion of alloreactive CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissues 
(i.e., spleen) early after HCT, before the onset of GVHD, was not 
affected by host-tissue expression of PD-L1 (28).
In the current studies, we show that depletion of donor CD4+ 
T cells early after HCT led to an increase of IFN-γ and reduction 
of IL-2 in the serum, and increased expression of PD-L1 by GVHD 
target tissues and by donor CD8+ T cells. Interactions of PD-L1 
with PD-1 on donor CD8+ T cells in GVHD target tissues induced 
tolerance through anergy, exhaustion, and apoptosis of effector T 
cells, thereby preventing GVHD. Interactions of PD-L1 with CD80 
on donor CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissues enhanced their expan-
sion and activity against malignant cells in the recipient.
Results
Temporary depletion of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT 
preserves strong GVL effects, while effectively preventing both acute and 
chronic GVHD in multiple models. In a previous study, we showed 
that sorted CD8+ T cells from C57BL/6 donors did not induce 
acute GVHD but they induced chronic GVHD in lethally irradiated 
 
BALB/c recipients, as indicated by histopathology in salivary glands, 
a prototypic target organ of chronic GVHD. Depletion of CD4+ T 
cells by treatment with anti-CD4 mAb on days 15 and 30 prevent-
ed the development of chronic GVHD, as indicated by prevention 
of tissue damage in all GVHD target tissues, especially in the sali-
vary gland (7). In extending these results, we found that: (a) In vivo 
administration of anti-CD4 on the day of HCT was more effective 
in depleting donor CD4+ T cells as compared with ex vivo depletion 
of CD4+ T cells, as judged by percentage and yield of donor CD4+ T 
cells in the spleen of recipients at 7 days after HCT (Supplemental 
Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; 
https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/JCI91138DS1). (b) Although a low dose of 
CD4+ T cells (0.075 × 106) or CD8+ T cells (1 × 106) alone induced no 
sign of diarrhea, addition of the small numbers of CD4+ T cells to 
the CD8+ T cell graft induced severe diarrhea and death of all recip-
ients (Supplemental Figure 1B). The addition of the small numbers 
of donor CD4+ T cells markedly reduced the apoptosis of colon 
tissue–infiltrating CD8+ T cells, resulting in marked expansion of 
donor CD8+ T cells in the colon tissue (Supplemental Figure 1C), 
and this effect was IL-2–dependent (Supplemental Figure 1D). (c) 
A single injection of anti-CD4 immediately following HCT effec-
tively prevented acute GVHD but did not prevent chronic GVHD, 
which was associated with reconstitution of donor CD4+ T cells 
beginning by day 21 after HCT (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3). (d) 
Three injections of anti-CD4 on days 0, 14, and 28 effectively pre-
vented both acute and chronic GVHD, and recovery of donor CD4+ 
T cells thereafter no longer caused chronic GVHD (Supplemental 
Figure 4, A–C). Prevention of chronic GVHD was indicated by the 
absence of tissue damage in GVHD target tissues at about 60 days 
after HCT (Supplemental Figure 4B). In addition, 3 injections but 
not 1 injection of anti-CD4 led to recovery of medullary thymic 
epithelial cells (mTECs) (Supplemental Figure 5, A–D). Therefore, 
GVHD, especially chronic GVHD, is more effectively prevented by 
temporary in vivo depletion of donor CD4+ T cells early after HCT 
than by ex vivo depletion of donor CD4+ T cells.
In the previous study, we did not evaluate the effect of in vivo 
CD4+ T depletion on GVL effects. To address this question, we first

In further experiments, we increased donor spleen cells to 
 
20 × 106 and 40 × 106 and extended the anti-CD4 treatment to day 
60 after HCT. 37.5% (6 of 16) of recipients given 20 × 106 donor 
spleen cells died with progressive tumor growth; 62.5% (10 of 16) 
survived for more than 100 days without detectable tumor cells 
(Figure 2, A and B). All (12 of 12) recipients given 40 × 106 donor 
spleen cells survived for more than 100 days without detectable 
tumor cells in the spleen, liver, or BM (Figure 2, A and B, and Sup-
plemental Figure 6A). The anti-CD4–treated recipients given 40 × 
106 donor spleen cells showed recovery of CD4+ T cells to a level 
all (8 of 8) died due to GVHD within 15 days after HCT (Figure 
2, A and B). The anti-CD4–treated, GVHD-free recipients given 
10 × 106 donor spleen cells had significantly prolonged survival, 
as compared with TCD-BM recipients (P < 0.01; Figure 2A), but 
by day 100 after HCT, 70% (7 of 10) of the recipients died with 
progressive tumor growth (Figure 2, A and B, and Supplemental 
Figure 6A). The 3 recipients surviving more than 100 days after 
HCT had no detectable tumor cells. Thus, BC-CML cells appear 
to be partially resistant to GVL effects in anti-CD4–treated recipi-
ents given 10 × 106 spleen cells.

recipients. Lethally irradiated BALB/c recipients transplanted with splenocytes (5 × 106) and TCD-BM (2.5 × 106) from C57BL/6 donors. Recipients were 
challenged with i.p. injection of BCL1/Luc cells (5 × 106 per mouse) and were given 3 i.v. injections of rat IgG or anti-CD4 mAb (500 μg/mouse) at days 0, 
14, and 28 after HCT. Recipients given TCD-BM cells (2.5 × 106) alone were used as controls. Mice were monitored for tumor growth using in vivo biolumi-
nescent imaging (BLI), clinical signs of GVHD, and survival. (A) One representative BLI image from each time point is shown for each group. (B) Summary

similar to that of TCD-BM recipients by 100 days after HCT (Fig-
ure 2C). They showed no clinical evidence of GVHD. Body weight 
increased progressively, and histological evaluation showed no 
tissue damage at day 100, similar to results in TCD-BM control 
(Figure 2, D and E). The antitumor effect was donor CD8+ T cell–
dependent, since injection of CD8+ T-depleted spleen cells (40 × 
106) abolished GVL effects in anti-CD4–treated GVHD-free recip-
ients, and all mice (8 of 8) died with progressive tumor growth by 
approximately 25 days after HCT (Supplemental Figure 6B). Tak-
en together, these results show that temporary in vivo depletion 
of CD4+ T cells allows donor T cells to eliminate “GVL-resistant” 
BC-CML leukemia cells while effectively preventing GVHD.
Third, we tested whether administration of depleting anti–
human CD4 mAb could prevent GVHD and preserve GVL effects 
in a xenogeneic model of GVHD (32). Immunodeficient NSG 
mice without or with human B cell lymphoma Raji cells (1 × 106 
per mouse) were used for GVHD or GVL experiments. Healthy 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (20 × 106) 
were injected i.p. into mice that were then treated with depleting 
anti–human CD4 (clone IT1208, 200 μg/mouse) or control IgG 
twice weekly for 4 weeks (33). We tested 4 human PBMC donors. 
For each donor, we used 16 NSG mice, 8 for GVHD experiments 
and 8 for GVL experiments. Within each experiment, 4 recipients 
were treated with control IgG and 4 were treated with anti-CD4.
Anti-CD4 treatment effectively prevented xenogeneic 
GVHD in experiments with 3 of the 4 donors, and the 12 GVHD-
free anti-CD4–treated NSG recipients survived for more than 
100 days after PBMC injection (Figure 3A). With cells from 1 
donor, anti-CD4 treatment was only partially effective in pre-
venting xenogeneic GVHD (Supplemental Figure 7). IgG-treated 
control NSG recipients all developed GVHD with weight loss, 
ruffled fur, and hair loss, and all died by about 60 days after 
PBMC injection (P < 0.01; Figure 3A). Anti-CD4 treatment pre-
vented GVHD target tissue damage in the skin, salivary gland, 
liver, and lung (P < 0.01; Figure 3B).
In GVL experiments, control recipients given Raji cells alone 
all died with progressive tumor growth by 35 days. NSG mice given 
Raji cells and human PBMCs were treated with IgG or anti-CD4. 
All 12 GVHD-free anti-CD4–treated mice survived for more than 
100 days after PBMC injection (P < 0.01; Figure 3C), but IgG-treat-
ed mice all died with GVHD by approximately 65 days after PBMC 
injection. Control NSG mice that died with progressive tumor 
growth had Raji cell infiltration in the spleen, liver, and BM, while 
the anti-CD4–treated GVHD-free NSG mice had no detectable 
tumor cells in these tissues (P < 0.01; Figure 3C). These results 
suggest that antibody-mediated in vivo depletion of donor CD4+ T 
cells immediately after HCT may be able to prevent GVHD while 
preserving GVL effects after allogeneic HCT in humans.
Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT increases 
serum IFN-γ but decreases serum IL-2 concentrations. In experiments 
with C57BL/6 donors and BALB/c recipients, we explored how in 
vivo depletion of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT pre-
vented acute GVHD while preserving GVL effects. High serum 
levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α have been associated with acute GVHD 
(34). Contrary to expectation, depletion of donor CD4+ T cells 
increased serum IFN-γ concentrations approximately 3-fold at 7 
days after HCT (P < 0.001). Serum IL-2 concentrations decreased 
by approximately 50% (P < 0.05), and serum TNF-α concentra-
tions showed no significant differences from baseline (Figure 4A). 
The increased serum levels of IFN-γ are attributable to expansion 
of donor CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissues, because the number of 
IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells in the spleen of anti-CD4–treated recipients 
was approximately 3-fold higher than in rat IgG–treated recipients 
(P < 0.001), although the percentage of IFN-γ+ cells among CD8+ T 
cells was similar in the 2 groups (Figure 4B). These results suggest 
that in vivo depletion of CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT may 
expand IFN-γ–producing CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissues.
Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT increas-
es the numbers of donor CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissues. Next, we 
kinetically evaluated the effects of in vivo CD4+ T cell depletion 
on donor CD8+ T cell expansion and tissue distribution. At 5 days 
after HCT, the numbers of H-2Kb+ donor-type CD8+ T cells in the 
spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were lower in anti-CD4–
treated recipients than in rat IgG–treated recipients (P < 0.01; 
Figure 4C). From 7 to 10 days after HCT, the numbers of donor 
CD8+ T cells in the spleen, popliteal lymph nodes, and mesenteric 
lymph nodes of anti-CD4–treated recipients were approximately 
3-fold higher than those in the control IgG–treated recipients (P < 
0.01), although the numbers subsided and differences diminished 
between the 2 groups by 14–21 days after HCT (Figure 4C). By day 
28, donor CD8+ T cells expanded again in lymphoid tissues of anti-
CD4–treated recipients, but not in IgG-treated recipients, and 
IgG-treated recipients showed severe lymphopenia (Figure 4C).
Furthermore, by using congenic markers (CD45.2 for the 
injected T cells and CD45.1 for T cells that were generated de 
novo from the donor marrow), we found that at 28 days after HCT, 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen of IgG-treated recipients were 
almost all derived from CD45.2+ mature T cells in the graft. In con-
trast, CD4+ T cells in the spleen of anti-CD4–treated recipients 
were almost all derived from the CD45.1+ donor marrow, while 
CD8+ T cells originated from both the injected CD45.2+ T cells and 
the CD45.1+ donor marrow (Supplemental Figure 8A). The yield of

with PBMCs (20 × 106 i.p.) from healthy human donors were injected with 
either IgG or anti–human CD4 mAb (200 μg/mouse, twice weekly for 4 
weeks). 1 × 106 eGFP+ Raji cells were injected i.p. on day 0. Recipients were 
monitored for signs of tumor burden and clinical GVHD. (A) Percentage

was evaluated 50–100 days after HCT. Tissues from the IgG-treated group

than in control IgG–treated recipients on day 10 after HCT (Figure 
4C), anti-CD4–treated recipients appeared to have little damage to 
liver or evidence of hepatocyte apoptosis, in contrast to IgG-treat-
ed control recipients (P < 0.01; Figure 5, C and D). Furthermore, 
liver-infiltrating CD8+ T cells from IgG-treated recipients at day 21 
after HCT induced GVHD in secondary adoptive recipients, while 
CD8+ T cells from anti-CD4–treated recipients did not (Figure 
5E). These results suggest that liver-infiltrating CD8+ T cells may 
be anergic or exhausted, such that they become nonpathogenic.
Therefore, we compared the proliferation and apoptosis of 
donor CD8+ T cells in the spleen, liver, and colon tissues at 7 and 10 
days after HCT. At day 7, in vivo BrdU labeling showed that donor 
CD8+ T cells had significantly faster proliferation in the spleen, 
liver, and intestine tissues in anti-CD4–treated recipients as com-
pared with IgG-treated recipients (P < 0.01; Figure 6A, middle 
column, and Supplemental Figure 10A). In contrast, apoptosis of 
donor CD8+ T cells was markedly reduced in the spleen (P < 0.01), 
not significantly changed in the liver, and markedly increased in 
the colon (P < 0.01) in anti-CD4–treated recipients as compared 
with IgG-treated recipients (Figure 6A, right column, and Supple-
mental Figure 10B). By day 10, donor CD8+ T cells in the spleen and 
liver of anti-CD4–treated recipients no longer proliferated better, 
although the apoptosis rate was still lower (Supplemental Figure 
11A). Therefore, the increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis 
led to the increased numbers of donor CD8+ T cells in the spleen 
and liver of anti-CD4–treated recipients early after HCT.
To evaluate anergy and exhaustion of donor CD8+ T cells, we 
compared the CD8+ T cell expression levels (mean fluorescence 
index, MFI) of the anergy/exhaustion-related markers GRAIL, 
TIM-3, and IL-R7α. As compared with IgG-treated recipients, the 
CD8+ T cells from the spleen of anti-CD4–treated recipients did 
not have significant change in their expression of GRAIL, TIM-3, 
or IL-7Rα on day 7 (Figure 6B and Supplemental Figure 10C), but 
they had significantly downregulated expression of TIM-3 and 
upregulated expression of IL-7Rα on day 10 (Supplemental Figure 
11B). In contrast, the CD8+ T cells from the liver of anti-CD4–treat-
ed recipients had significantly increased expression of GRAIL and 
downregulated expression of IL-7Rα on day 7, although the chang-
es appeared to be small (Figure 6B and Supplemental Figure 10C), 
and on day 10 after HCT, they had upregulated expression of TIM-
3 (Supplemental Figure 11B). In addition, comparing CD8+ T cells 
from the liver and spleen of anti-CD4–treated recipients, CD8+ T 
cells from the liver expressed significantly higher levels of GRAIL 
and TIM-3 and lower levels of IL-7Rα at 7 days after HCT (P < 0.05; 
Figure 6C); and higher levels of TIM-3 persisted at day 10 (P < 
0.01; Supplemental Figure 11C). These results suggest that donor 
CD8+ T cells in the liver of anti-CD4–treated recipients become 
anergic and exhausted by 7–10 days after HCT, while those in the 
spleen do not.
EOMES regulates CD8+ T differentiation (40). EOMES+T-bet+ 
 
CD8+ T cells are effector cells with strong cytolytic function, while 
EOMES+PD-1+ CD8+ T cells are terminally differentiated exhaust-
ed cells (41, 42). Therefore, we evaluated the impact of depletion of 
CD4+ T cells on CD8+ T expression of EOMES, T-bet, and PD-1 in 
the spleen and liver at 7 and 10 days after HCT. CD8+ T cells from 
the spleen and liver of anti-CD4–treated recipients had signifi-
cant increase in percentages of EOMES+T-bet+ and EOMES+PD-1+ 
total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen of IgG-treated recipients 
was significantly lower than that in anti-CD4–treated recipients 
 
(P < 0.01; Supplemental Figure 8A). Very few Foxp3+ Tregs derived 
from the injected CD4+ T cells were present in IgG-treated recipi-
ents, but Tregs represented approximately 10% of the CD4+ T cell 
population derived from the donor marrow in anti-CD4–treated 
recipients (Supplemental Figure 8B). These results indicate that 
IgG-treated recipients developed acute GVHD and lymphopenia. 
A single injection of anti-CD4 effectively depletes the injected 
CD4+ T cells and augments de novo regeneration of both CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells, as well as Tregs.
Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT decreases 
the numbers of donor CD8+ T cells in the intestine and lung but not 
in the liver. At 5 days after HCT, only a few donor CD8+ T cells 
infiltrated the colon, lung, and liver, with no difference between 
recipients treated with IgG or anti-CD4. From day 7 to day 28 after 
HCT, the numbers of donor CD8+ T cells in the colon were mark-
edly lower in anti-CD4–treated recipients than in IgG-treated 
recipients (P < 0.01; Figure 4C). The pattern in the lung was simi-
lar to that in the colon. In the liver, the numbers of donor CD8+ T 
cells were higher in anti-CD4–treated recipients than in IgG-treat-
ed recipients at 10 days after HCT (P < 0.01), but by day 21, the 
numbers of CD8+ T cells in IgG-treated recipients surpassed the 
numbers in anti-CD4–treated recipients (P < 0.01; Figure 4C). The 
expansion of donor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in GVHD target tissues 
of IgG-treated recipients was associated with recurrence of GVHD 
(Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 4A).
We and others previously reported that donor T cell infiltration 
of gut tissues is regulated by their expression of gut tissue–specific 
homing and chemokine receptors (α4β7, CCR9, CXCR3), and by tis-
sue release of the corresponding chemokines (CCL25 and CXCL9–
11) (35, 36). Although donor CD8+ T cell infiltration of intestinal 
tissues (i.e., colon) was markedly decreased in anti-CD4–treated 
recipients at 7 days after HCT (Figure 4C), donor CD8+ T cells did 
not show any significant reduction in the expression of α4β7, CCR9, 
or CXCR3 (Supplemental Figure 9A). Expression of CCL25 in the 
small intestine and expression levels of CXCL9–11 in the colon 
were higher in anti-CD4–treated recipients than in IgG-treat-
ed recipients (P < 0.05; Supplemental Figure 9B). These results 
suggest that reduction of gut tissue infiltration by donor CD8+ T 
cells after depletion of donor CD4+ T cells is unlikely to be due to 
decreased CD8+ T cell migration into gut tissues.
Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT augments 
donor CD8+ T cell apoptosis in the intestine and anergy/exhaustion in 
the liver, but not in the spleen. Next, we explored mechanisms where-
by anti-CD4–treated GVHD-free recipients had reduced numbers 
of donor CD8+ T cells in the colon and similar or higher numbers 
in the liver, while having increased numbers of donor CD8+ T cells 
in the spleen, as shown in Figure 4. In the pathogenesis of GVHD, 
alloreactive donor T cells damage Paneth cells in the small intestine 
and disrupt epithelial junctions in the colon (37, 38). Consistently, 
anti-CD4–treated recipients without signs of diarrhea showed little 
damage to Paneth cells in the small intestine and little disruption of 
epithelial junctions in the colon (Figure 5, A and B).
Alloreactive T cell infiltration also plays a critical role in dam-
age to the liver (39). Although the numbers of liver-infiltrating 
CD8+ cells were markedly higher in anti-CD4–treated recipients

production and tissue PD-L1 expression contribute to GVHD pre-
vention by administration of anti-CD4 early after HCT.
Furthermore, we found that elevation of IFN-γ in anti-CD4–
treated BALB/c recipients given WT C57BL/6 transplants was 
associated with upregulation of host intestinal epithelial cell 
expression of PD-L1 (Supplemental Figure 14A), and in contrast 
to acute GVHD-free anti-CD4–treated WT recipients, anti-CD4–
treated Pdl1–/– recipients showed severe acute GVHD, as judged by 
body weight loss, severe diarrhea, and death within 10 days after 
HCT (Supplemental Figure 14B). The acute GVHD was associated 
with liver dysfunction, hepatocyte apoptosis, and loss of Paneth 
cells and colon epithelial integrity (P < 0.01; Supplemental Fig-
ure 14, C and D). The severity of acute GVHD in Pdl1–/– recipients 
appeared to be similar to that in IgG-treated control WT recipients 
(Supplemental Figure 14, B–D).
In addition, we directly tested the role of host-tissue PD-L1 
on acute GVHD severity induced by sorted CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. 
While 2.5 × 106 or 5 × 106 sorted CD8+ T cells induced very little 
evidence of acute GVHD, the same numbers of donor CD4+ T cells 
induced severe lethal acute GVHD, and all the recipients died with-
in 10 days (P < 0.01; Supplemental Figure 15A). Conversely, 2.5 × 106 
 
or 5 × 106 sorted CD8+ T cells induced severe lethal acute GVHD in 
Pdl1–/– recipients, and the severity was similar to that induced by 
the same number of donor CD4+ T cells (Supplemental Figure 15B). 
Taken together, these results indicate that host-tissue expression of 
PD-L1 plays a critical role in preventing acute GVHD mediated by 
donor CD8+ T cells in the absence of donor CD4+ T cells.
Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of host-tissue expression 
of PD-L1 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and anergy/exhaustion 
of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, liver, and colon tissues of anti-CD4–
treated recipients on day 7 after HCT. As compared with anti-CD4–
treated WT recipients, anti-CD4–treated Pdl1–/– recipients had no 
changes in proliferation or apoptosis of donor CD8+ T cells in the 
spleen (Figure 7A and Supplemental Figure 16, A and B), with no 
difference in the numbers of CD8+ T cells between Pdl1–/– recipi-
ents and controls. Anti-CD4–treated Pdl1–/– recipients had a signifi-
cant decrease in CD8+ T proliferation and apoptosis in the liver and 
colon, and the reduction of apoptosis outweighed the reduction of 
proliferation (P < 0.01; Figure 7A and Supplemental Figure 16, A 
and B), such that higher numbers of donor CD8+ T cells infiltrat-
ed the liver and colon of Pdl1–/– recipients as compared with con-
trols. These results indicate that host-tissue expression of PD-L1 
augments the apoptosis of infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the liver and 
intestine but not in the spleen of anti-CD4–treated recipients.
We also compared the expression levels (MFI) of GRAIL, TIM-3, 
 
and IL-7Rα and the percentage of EOMES+T-bet+ CD8+ and 
EOMES+PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in the spleen and liver of Pdl1–/– recip-
ients and controls at 7 days after HCT. The absence of host-tissue 
expression of PD-L1 did not significantly change donor CD8+ T 
expression of GRAIL or TIM-3 in the spleen, although expression 
of IL-7Rα was higher in Pdl1–/– recipients than in WT recipients 
(Figure 7B and Supplemental Figure 16C). On the other hand, the 
absence of host-tissue expression of PD-L1 reduced expression 
of GRAIL and increased expression of IL-7Rα by CD8+ T cells in 
the liver, with no significant changes in TIM-3 expression (Fig-
ure 7B and Supplemental Figure 16C). The absence of host-tissue 
PD-L1 did not significantly change the percentages of EOMES+ 
cells, as compared with control IgG–treated recipients at days 7 
and 10 after HCT (P < 0.01; Figure 6D, Supplemental Figure 10D, 
and Supplemental Figure 11D). The increase of EOMES+T-bet+ 
cells was dominant among splenic CD8+ T cells on days 7 and 10, 
while the increase of EOMES+PD-1+ cells was dominant among 
CD8+ T cells in the liver at day 7, with no difference on day 10 (Fig-
ure 6E and Supplemental Figure 11E). These results indicate that 
anti-CD4 depletion of donor CD4+ T cells early after HCT leads to 
preferential cytotoxic differentiation of CD8+ T cells in the spleen 
and preferential terminal differentiation and exhaustion of CD8+ 
T cells in the liver.
Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT allows 
host-tissue expression of PD-L1 to tolerize infiltrating donor CD8+ 
T cells in GVHD target tissues but not in lymphoid tissues. PD-L1/
PD-1 interaction leads to T cell anergy and exhaustion (18), and 
simultaneous PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions aug-
ment apoptosis of activated alloreactive CD4+ T cells early after 
HCT (25). Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells increased serum lev-
els of IFN-γ (Figure 4A), and IFN-γ induces tissue expression of 
PD-L1 in GVHD target tissues (21, 23). Although IL-27 upregulates 
PD-L1 expression (43), we did not see differences in serum IL-27 
concentrations in recipients with or without anti-CD4 treatment 
(Supplemental Figure 12). Thus, we first tested whether donor cell 
IFN-γ production and tissue expression of PD-L1 contributed to 
prevention of GVHD in anti-CD4–treated recipients. Spleen cells 
(5 × 106) from IFN-γ–deficient (Ifng–/–) and WT C57BL/6 donors 
were transplanted into lethally irradiated BALB/c recipients. 
Indeed, anti-CD4 treatment did not prevent acute GVHD mediat-
ed by transplants from Ifng–/– donors. All recipients showed severe 
diarrhea and weight loss, and approximately 80% (8 of 10) of the 
recipients died by 30 days after HCT (Supplemental Figure 13A). 
The CD8+ T cells, CD11c+ DCs, and Mac-1/Gr-1+ myeloid cells in 
the spleen and liver of recipients given Ifng–/– transplants all had 
significantly downregulated expression of PD-L1 early after HCT 
(Supplemental Figure 13B). These results suggested that IFN-γ

anergic or exhausted. Taken together, these results show that in 
anti-CD4–treated allogeneic mouse recipients, host-tissue expres-
sion of PD-L1 plays an important role in the induction of anergy, 
exhaustion, and apoptosis of donor CD8+ T cells infiltrating the 
liver but not in the spleen.
We also found that human T cells could interact with mouse 
PD-L1 (Supplemental Figure 18A), and blockade of PD-L1 inter-
action with its receptors by administration of anti–mouse PD-L1 
led to development of lethal xenogeneic GVHD in anti–human 
CD4–treated NSG recipients given human PBMCs, whereas the

of host-tissue PD-L1 did not significantly change the percentage 
of EOMES+T-bet+ CD8+ T cells in the liver, but the percentage of 
EOMES+PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in the liver was lower in Pdl1–/– recip-
ients compared with WT recipients (Figure 7C and Supplemental 
Figure 16D). In addition, the presence of BCL1 tumor cells did not 
have a significant impact on the induction of tolerance in donor 
CD8+ T cells infiltrating the liver (Supplemental Figure 17), sug-
gesting that donor CD8+ T cells in the liver tissues are able to 
eliminate the infiltrating tumor cells before becoming completely

Supplemental Figure 19A). Anti-CD4 treatment also significantly 
upregulated CD8+ T cell expression of PD-1 and CD80 early after 
HCT (Figure 8A and Supplemental Figure 19A). CD8+ T cells in the 
spleen had the highest expression of PD-L1 and CD80, with the low-
est expression of PD-1. In contrast, CD8+ T cells in the colon had the 
lowest expression of PD-L1 and CD80, with the highest expression 
of PD-1. The pattern for CD8+ T cells in the liver fell in between, as 
indicated by the ratio of PD-1 to CD80 (Figure 8A). Consistent with 
a previous report (44), non-T cells such as CD11c+ DCs and CD11b/
Gr-1+ myeloid cells in the spleen expressed much higher levels of 
PD-L1 as compared with those in the liver and colon. Anti-CD4 
treatment did not significantly change the high expression of PD-L1 
by non-T cells in the spleen (Supplemental Figure 20). Therefore, we 
tested the impact of donor CD8+ T cell PD-L1 and CD80 interactions 
on donor CD8+ T expansion and GVL effects.
Transplantation of sorted Thy1.2+ T cells from Pdl1–/– C57BL/6 
donors and TCD-BM cells from WT C57BL/6 donors led to 
control recipients without anti–PD-L1 blockade showed no signs 
of xenogeneic GVHD (Supplemental Figure 18B). Blockade with 
anti–PD-L1 led to significant downregulation of PD-1 expres-
sion by CD8+ T cells and significant augmentation of CD8+ T cell 
expansion in the liver and lung (Supplemental Figure 18, C and D). 
These results suggest that tissue expression of PD-L1 contributes 
to tolerization of human donor CD8+ T cells in xenogeneic recipi-
ents in the absence of human CD4+ T cells.
Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT leads to 
donor CD8+ T cell upregulated expression of PD-L1 and CD80 in lym-
phoid tissues, which preserves GVL effects. Since donor T cell expression 
of PD-L1 augments acute GVHD lethality in recipients transplanted 
with both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (24), we evaluated the effect of 
donor CD8+ T expression of PD-L1 in the expansion and GVL activ-
ity of CD8+ T cells in GVHD-free anti-CD4–treated recipients. Anti-
CD4 treatment significantly upregulated CD8+ T cell expression of 
PD-L1 in the spleen and liver but not in the colon (Figure 8A and 
Figure 7. Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells allows 
host-tissue PD-L1 to tolerize CD8+ T cells in GVHD 
target tissues but not in lymphoid tissues. Lethally

and treated at day 0 with anti-CD4 mAb as described 
in Figure 5. On day 7 after HCT, spleen, liver, and colon

1C), we focused on comparing the tumor load early after HCT 
in recipients with or without blockade of PD-L1/CD80 interac-
tions via 43H12 mAb treatment on days 0 and 2 after HCT. Anti-
CD4–treated recipients were challenged with 5 × 106 and 10 × 106 
BCL1/Luc cells. Treatment with anti–PD-L1 (43H12) significantly 
augmented tumor growth as visualized with in vivo BLI (P < 0.01; 
Figure 8E). Although all (8 of 8) anti-CD4–treated recipients elim-
inated tumor cells before day 12 after HCT, blockade of PD-L1/
CD80 augmented tumor growth, as indicated by in vivo BLI, 
resulting in death of all (8 of 8) recipients given 5 × 106 or 10 × 106 
BCL1/Luc cells by approximately day 10 after HCT (Figure 8E). 
43H12 mAb treatment also markedly increased the tumor load 
in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and lungs at 7 days 
after HCT. Taken together, these results show that donor CD8+ 
T cell expression of PD-L1 and its interaction with CD80 aug-
ments donor CD8+ T survival and expansion in the spleen, result-
ing in strong GVL activity without causing GVHD early after HCT 
in anti-CD4–treated recipients.
Discussion
We have shown that temporary in vivo depletion of adoptively 
transferred mature donor CD4+ T and de novo–generated CD4+ T 
cells early after HCT prevents both acute and chronic GVHD, while 
augmenting donor early CD8+ T expansion in lymphoid tissues 
and preserving strong GVL effects. This outcome does not simply 
reflect depletion of donor CD4+ T cells that recognize recipient 
alloantigens, but results from several newly observed mechanisms.
Expression of PD-L1 in recipient tissues can prevent both 
acute and chronic GVHD after effective depletion of donor CD4+ 
T cells early after HCT, and temporary depletion for only 30–60 
days after HCT is sufficient. We observed that a single injection 
of anti-CD4 effectively prevented acute GVHD, but the recipi-
ents still develop chronic GVHD with damage in GVHD target 
tissues. We also observed that at least 3 injections were required 
to effectively prevent chronic GVHD. Three injections of anti-
CD4 allowed mTEC recovery and restoration of thymic negative 
selection, but a single injection was not sufficient. Our recent pub-
lication (7) indicated that de novo–generated CD4+ T cells early 
after HCT could perpetuate CD8+ T-mediated damage in the thy-
mus, leading to autoimmune-like chronic GVHD. Consistently, 
although a single injection of anti-CD4 prevented acute GVHD 
and augmented de novo generation of donor-type CD4+ T cells, 
it did not prevent thymus damage mediated by de novo–gener-
ated donor CD4+ T cells early after HCT. On the other hand, in 
the absence of donor CD4+ T cells, donor CD8+ T cells infiltrat-
ing thymic tissues were tolerized by host-tissue PD-L1, and thy-
mus damage mediated by the donor CD8+ T cells was self-limited. 
Therefore, anti-CD4 treatment has the important effect of tempo-
rarily depleting both the injected mature CD4+ T cells and also the 
CD4+ T cells generated de novo from the marrow progenitors early 
after HCT, thereby allowing sufficient time for mTECs to recover 
and restore effective thymic negative selection. This time period 
is approximately 30–60 days after HCT. CD4+ T cells generated 
from the donor marrow progenitors after this time point no longer 
cause chronic GVHD.
We observed that increased IFN-γ concentrations were associ-
ated with enhanced expression of PD-L1 by colon epithelial cells, 
marked reduction of donor CD8+ T expansion in the spleen of anti-
CD4–treated recipients early after HCT, as compared with Thy1.2+ 
T cells from WT donors (P < 0.001; Figure 8B). This finding was 
associated with increased apoptosis, downregulated expression of 
BCL-XL, and an increased percentage of CD8+ T cells that express 
PD-1 and EOMES (P < 0.01; Figure 8B and Supplemental Figure 
19B). Similarly, transplantation of Thy1.2+ T cells from CD80–/– 
donors and TCD-BM cells from WT donors also led to significant 
downregulation of BCL-XL and an increased percentage of CD8+ 
T cells that express PD-1 and EOMES (P < 0.01) as compared with 
T cells from WT donors, although expression of annexin V and 
expansion of the CD8+ T cells were similar in the 2 groups (Fig-
ure 8C and Supplemental Figure 19C). These results indicate that 
expression of PD-L1 and CD80 by donor CD8+ T cells are both 
required in order to augment their survival and expansion in the 
spleen of anti-CD4–treated recipients early after HCT.
To further evaluate the role of PD-L1/CD80 interaction in 
CD8+ T cell survival and expansion, we used an anti–PD-L1 mAb 
(43H12) that specifically blocks PD-L1/CD80 interaction without 
interfering with PD-L1/PD-1 interaction (20). The 43H12 mAb 
was injected i.p. into anti-CD4–treated WT recipients on days 0 
and 2 after HCT. As compared with control IgG treatment, block-
ade of PD-L1/CD80 interaction also markedly decreased donor 
CD8+ T cell expansion in the spleen. This finding was associated 
with augmented apoptosis, reduced expression of BCL-XL, and an 
increased percentage of EOMES+PD-1+ cells (Figure 8D and Sup-
plemental Figure 19D). Taken together, these results indicate that 
donor CD8+ T-T PD-L1/CD80 interactions play a critical role in 
augmenting donor CD8+ T survival and expansion in the spleen of 
anti-CD4–treated recipients early after HCT.
Finally, we evaluated the impact of PD-L1/CD80 interaction 
on GVL activity in anti-CD4–treated recipients. Since BCL1/Luc+ 
tumor cells in anti-CD4–treated recipients were eliminated within 
12 days after HCT without relapse by 100 days after HCT (Figure

CD4 and could be depleted by anti-CD4 treatment. However, 
depletion of donor CD4+ T cells together with those CD4+ regula-
tory cells was able to effectively prevent GVHD, suggesting that in 
the absence of donor CD4+ T cells, tissue-protective mechanisms 
are sufficient to prevent GVHD mediated by CD8+ T cells, and 
CD4+ regulatory T cells are dispensable.
We also found that small numbers of donor CD4+ T cells in 
the graft could augment acute GVHD by markedly reducing the 
apoptosis of CD8+ T cells infiltrating the colon, and this effect 
was IL-2–dependent. In addition, although sorted CD8+ T cells 
induced little and sorted CD4+ T cells induced severe acute GVHD 
in PD-L1–sufficient WT recipients, sorted CD8+ and CD4+ T cells 
both induced lethal acute GVHD with similar severity in PD-L1–
deficient recipients. These results suggest that CD8+ T cells are 
more sensitive than CD4+ T cells to host-tissue PD-L1–mediated 
apoptosis, and CD4+ T cell help early after HCT can make donor 
CD8+ T cells resistant to host-tissue PD-L1–mediated apoptosis. 
This observation is consistent with a previous report that IL-2 from 
CD4+ T cells may prevent apoptosis induced by PD-1 signaling in 
CD8+ T cells that are deficient in IL-2 production (47). Our obser-
vations also explain why host-tissue expression of PD-L1 could 
ameliorate GVHD only to a certain degree when whole spleen 
cells with both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were transplanted, as indi-
cated by comparison of WT and Pdl1–/– recipients (21, 22).
Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells early after HCT not only pre-
vented GVHD, but also enabled donor CD8+ T cell expression of 
PD-L1 to mediate their own expansion in lymphoid tissues and 
mediate strong GVL activity that could overcome “GVL-resistant” 
BC-CML tumor cells. The high concentrations of IFN-γ associated 
with CD4+ T cell depletion could contribute to the preservation of 
GVL activity, since Yang et al. (48) showed that in the absence of 
donor CD4+ T cells, IFN-γ–deficient donor CD8+ T cells had lower 
GVL activity than WT donor CD8+ T cells.
We observed that augmentation of donor CD8+ T cell expan-
sion in the lymphoid tissues after anti-CD4 treatment is depen-
dent on donor CD8+ T expression of both PD-L1 and CD80, and 
host-tissue expression of PD-L1 has little impact. The lack of 
impact from host PD-L1 is likely due to relative paucity of host 
parenchymal cells that express PD-L1 in the lymphoid tissues. The 
expansion of donor CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissues most likely 
results from T-T interaction via PD-L1/CD80, although we cannot 
entirely exclude the possibility that CD8+ T interaction with non-T 
cells via PD-L1/CD80 also plays a role. First, PD-L1 deficiency on 
donor CD8+ T cells, but not PD-L1 deficiency on donor non-T cells 
(data not shown), markedly reduced donor CD8+ T cell survival 
and expansion. Second, CD80 deficiency on donor CD8+ T cells 
also reduced donor CD8+ T expression of survival gene BCL-XL 
and increased CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Third, anti-CD4 treatment 
early after HCT upregulated PD-L1 and CD80 expression by 
donor CD8+ T cells but not by non-T cells (i.e., DCs and myeloid 
cells). Finally, specific blockade of PD-L1/CD80 interaction by 
anti–PD-L1 (43H12) markedly reduced donor CD8+ T survival and 
expansion in the spleen and abolished GVL effects. This obser-
vation is consistent with previous findings that PD-L1 on CD8+ T 
cells was required for survival of activated CD8+ T cells (49). In 
contrast, PD-L1/CD80 interactions augment apoptosis of activat-
ed CD4+ T cells (25). Mechanisms that account for the differential 
and IFN-γ deficiency was associated with downregulation of PD-L1 
expression. These observations are consistent with results of a pre-
vious study showing that in recipients with acute GVHD, upreg-
ulation of PD-L1 expression in host tissues requires IFN-γ (23). 
Although host-tissue PD-L1 had little impact on donor CD8+ T cell 
proliferation or survival in the spleen early after HCT, depletion 
of donor CD4+ T cells led to induction of apoptosis of infiltrating 
donor CD8+ T cells by PD-L1 in colon tissue and induction of aner-
gy and exhaustion by PD-L1 in liver tissue. The differential effect of 
PD-L1–mediated signaling on donor CD8+ T cells in the colon and 
liver was associated with differential expression of PD-1 and CD80 
by donor CD8+ T cells in these tissues. The ratio of PD-1 to CD80 
MFI on donor CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in the colon 
as compared with the liver. Further studies are needed to address 
how donor CD8+ T cells express different levels of PD-1 and CD80 
in the different tissues, and how different ratios of PD-1/CD80 
regulate PD-L1–mediated tolerance mechanisms in CD8+ T cells. 
Other mechanisms may also contribute to GVHD prevention in 
anti-CD4–treated recipients with elevation of IFN-γ. For example, 
IFN-γ augments tissue release of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
(IDO), which could ameliorate acute GVHD (45). Depletion of 
donor CD4+ T cells also prevents marrow GVHD (46).
NKT cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T 
cells can suppress GVHD (3, 45), and some of these cells express

cells. Donor CD8+ T cells express higher levels of PD-L1 and CD80 
but a lower level of PD-1 in the spleen, promoting PD-L1/CD80 
interactions among donor CD8+ T cells. In contrast, donor CD8+ 
T cells express a higher level of PD-1 and lower levels of PD-L1 and 
CD80 in GVHD target tissues, promoting host-tissue PD-L1 inter-
action with PD-1 on donor CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells are defec-
tive in IL-2 production, and in the absence of IL-2 help from CD4+ 
T cells, donor CD8+ T cells may become more sensitive to the 
tolerizing effects of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. Donor CD8+ T-T and 
PD-L1/CD80 interactions augment donor CD8+ T survival and 
expansion in lymphoid tissues, resulting in strong GVL effects. 
Dominant host PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 on CD8+ T cells 
mediates donor CD8+ T cell anergy, exhaustion, and apoptosis in 
GVHD target tissues, thereby preventing GVHD.
Our results provide an answer to the unanswered historical 
question of why sorted donor CD8+ T cells facilitate engraftment 
and mediate GVL effect without causing GVHD (4, 13). Our results 
might explain why ex vivo depletion of donor CD4+ T cells did not 
effectively prevent GVHD in a previous human trial (51), because 
very small numbers of donor CD4+ T cells in the graft could have 
expanded after HCT, and they could have worked together with 
donor CD4+ T cells generated from the marrow progenitors ear-
ly after HCT to help donor CD8+ T cells resist host-tissue PD-L1–
mediated apoptosis or other tolerance mechanisms. Our studies 
also indicate that temporary in vivo depletion of donor CD4+ T 
cells immediately after HCT may represent a novel approach to 
prevent GVHD while preserving strong GVL effects. Temporary in 
vivo depletion of donor CD4+ T cells for a period of approximate-
ly 30–60 days after HCT may not only allow GVHD target tissues 
to tolerize infiltrating donor CD8+ T cells while preserving GVL 
effects in the lymphoid tissues, but may also allow regeneration 
of mTECs and restoration of thymic negative selection for durable 
prevention of chronic GVHD.
Methods
Mice. WT and gene-manipulated C57BL/6, BALB/c, and other mice 
were purchased from the National Cancer Institute animal produc-
tion program (Frederick, Maryland, USA) or Jackson Laboratory or 
were bred at City of Hope Animal Research Center. Detailed strain 
information and sources are described in Supplemental Methods. All 
mice were maintained in a pathogen-free room in the City of Hope 
Animal Research Center.
Experimental procedures and materials. Induction and scoring 
of acute and chronic GVHD, in vivo BLI, in vivo BrdU labeling of 
proliferating T cells, TUNEL staining, tissue cell isolation, intracel-
lular staining of cytokines, antibodies, flow cytometry analysis and 
sorting, histopathology, histoimmunofluorescent staining, and real-
time PCR are described in our previous publications (7, 23, 25) and 
in Supplemental Methods.
Statistics. Data are displayed as mean ± SEM. Body weight, diar-
rhea, cutaneous damage scoring, GVHD, and survival in different 
groups were compared by the multiple t test or log-rank test. Compari-
son of 2 means was with an unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test; compar-
ison of multiple means was with 1-way ANOVA (Prism, version 6.0; 
GraphPad Software). P less than 0.05 is considered as significant.
Study approval. All animal procedures were approved by the 
IACUC of the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope.
effects of PD-L1/CD80 interactions on donor CD8+ T cells and 
CD4+ T cells are under investigation.
Saha et al. showed that PD-L1 deficiency in donor T cells 
reduced proliferation and survival of donor T cells and delayed 
GVHD lethality in recipients given both CD4+ and CD8+ donor T 
cells (24). This observation suggests that even when donor T cells 
have reduced survival capacity due to lack of expression of PD-L1, 
host-tissue expression of PD-L1 is still unable to tolerize tissue-in-
filtrating T cells to prevent GVHD when both donor CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells were present. Consistent with this report and adding 
one step further, we showed that depletion of donor CD4+ T cells 
early after HCT allowed host PD-L1 to effectively tolerize infiltrat-
ing CD8+ T cells in GVHD target tissues and completely prevent 
acute GVHD. At the same time, PD-L1/CD80 interactions among 
donor CD8+ T cells in the lymphoid tissues augment CD8+ T cell 
survival and expansion as well as their GVL activity.
On the other hand, using a nonlethal murine model of GVHD 
mediated by H-Y antigen–specific transgenic CD8+ T cells, Michon-
neau et al. reported that the transgenic CD8+ T cells were not able 
to eliminate host-type tumor cells in lymphoid tissues because of 
enhanced PD-L1/PD-1 interactions between PD-1+ transgenic 
CD8+ T cells and PD-L1+ CD11c+ DCs and F4/80+ macrophages 
(44). Similarly, Mueller et al. showed that PD-L1 expressed by 
hematopoietic cells suppressed viral-specific CD8+ T cell activa-
tion and expansion (50). Although we observed that CD11+ DCs 
and Mac-1/Gr-1+ myeloid cells in the spleen expressed much higher 
levels of PD-L1 as compared with those in the liver, the high lev-
els of PD-L1 on DCs and myeloid cells did not appear to interfere 
with the GVL activity of donor CD8+ T cells in the lymphoid tissues 
of anti-CD4–treated recipients, since different types and doses of 
tumor cells were all eliminated in anti-CD4–treated recipients.
Several explanations might account for the different impact of 
PD-L1 expressed by hematopoietic cells on GVL effects in the lym-
phoid tissues of recipients given H-Y–specific CD8+ T as compared 
with WT alloreactive CD8+ T cells. First, PD-L1 expressed by hema-
topoietic cells mainly controls activation and expansion of naive 
T cells (50). In anti-CD4–treated recipients, alloreactive CD8+ T 
cells are activated by recipient APCs that are rapidly eliminated. 
Therefore, PD-L1 expression by donor hematopoietic-derived 
APCs does not play an important role in donor T cell activation and 
expansion. Second, H-Y–specific transgenic CD8+ T cells in male 
recipients appeared to have very weak alloreactivity as indicated by 
lack of GVHD mortality even after blockade of PD-1. Their allore-
activity was easily controlled by PD-L1/PD-1 interactions between 
CD8+ T cells and DCs and macrophages in the lymphoid tissues. In 
contrast, the alloreactivity of WT alloreactive CD8+ T cells is much 
stronger, as indicated by their ability to cause rapidly lethal GVHD 
in Pdl1–/– recipients. Their alloreactivity cannot be controlled by 
PD-L1/PD-1 interactions between CD8+ T cells and DCs and mac-
rophages. Third, H-Y–specific transgenic CD8+ T cells might not 
express PD-L1, or PD-L1 might not play a role in their survival and 
expansion, unlike WT alloreactive T cells (24).
In summary, as depicted in the diagram (Figure 9), depletion 
of donor CD4+ T cells immediately after HCT increases serum 
IFN-γ but decreases IL-2 concentrations. Increase of IFN-γ aug-
ments expression of PD-L1 by donor CD8+ T cells and host tissues, 
while increasing expression of PD-1 and CD80 by donor CD8+ T
