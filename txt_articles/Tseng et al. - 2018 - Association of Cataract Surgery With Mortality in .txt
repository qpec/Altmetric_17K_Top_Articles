IMPORTANCE Previous studies have suggested an association between cataract surgery and
decreased risk for all-cause mortality potentially through a mechanism of improved health
status and functional independence, but the association between cataract surgery and
cause-specific mortality has not been previously studied and is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between cataract surgery and total and cause-specific
mortality in older women with cataract.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study included nationwide data
collected from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial and observational study
linked with the Medicare claims database. Participants in the present study were 65 years or
older with a diagnosis of cataract in the linked Medicare claims database. The WHI data were
collected from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed for the
present study from July 1, 2014, through September 1, 2017.
EXPOSURES Cataract surgery as determined by Medicare claims codes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality and
mortality attributed to vascular, cancer, accidental, neurologic, pulmonary, and infectious
causes. Mortality rates were compared by cataract surgery status using the log-rank test and
Cox regression models with time-varying covariate cataract surgery status adjusting for
demographics, systemic and ocular comorbidities, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index,
and physical activity.
RESULTS A total of 74 044 women with cataract in the WHI included 41 735 who underwent
cataract surgery. Mean (SD) age was 70.5 (4.6) years; the most common ethnicity was white
(64 430 [87.0%]), followed by black (5293 [7.1%]) and Hispanic (1723 [2.3%]). The mortality
rate was 2.56 per 100 person-years in the cataract surgery group and 1.45 per 100
person-years in the cataract diagnosis group. In covariate-adjusted Cox models, cataract
surgery was associated with higher all-cause mortality (adjusted hazards ratio [AHR], 1.07;
95% CI, 1.02-1.11) as well as higher mortality specific to vascular (AHR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.26-1.46),
cancer (AHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.18-1.38), accidental (AHR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.76), pulmonary
(AHR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.62-2.37), and infectious (AHR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.14-1.65) diseases.
Neurologic death causes were not associated with cataract surgery (AHR, 0.98; 95% CI,
0.83-1.17)
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In older women with cataract in the WHI, cataract surgery
was associated with higher risk for total and cause-specific mortality (except for neurologic
causes). Further study of the interplay of cataract surgery, systemic disease, disease-related
mortality, and the best timing of when to undergo cataract surgery would be informative for
improved patient care.

ataract surgery is the mainstay of treatment for visu-
ally significant cataract, and its primary purpose is to
reverse the associated visual impairment.1,2 Previous
studies from administrative databases have demonstrated that
in addition to visual improvement, cataract surgery was also
associated with a lower mortality risk.3-5 Although these stud-
ies hypothesized that the observed associations are medi-
ated by improvements in health status and functional inde-
pendence after cataract surgery, they have not examined
whether the association between cataract surgery and lower
mortality risk applies to women with different medical con-
ditions that affect overall functioning to varying degrees, such
as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and dementia.
TheWomen’
sHealthInitiative(WHI)databasecontainsde-
tailed and extensively validated information on demographic,
comorbidity, and lifestyle factors in a large cohort of US women
with more than 20 years of follow-up.6 Furthermore, the WHI
databasecontainsinformationontotalandcause-specificmor-
tality, which is not available in other large databases of patients
with cataract surgery in the United States.7 These factors make
the WHI an ideal cohort in which to examine the interplay be-
tween eye disease and a wide variety of systemic and lifestyle
factors in US women. Given these strengths of the WHI data-
base and the need for further understanding of the association
between cataract surgery and improved survival, the purpose
ofthepresentstudyistoexaminetheassociationbetweencata-
ract surgery and total and cause-specific mortality in the WHI
cohort, with the hypothesis that cataract surgery improves sur-
vival among women with cataract in the WHI.
Methods
Overview of the Women’s Health Initiative
The WHI is a study of US postmenopausal women aged 50 to
79 years. The WHI included 4 overlapping, randomized clini-
cal trials evaluating hormone therapy, diet modification, and
calcium and vitamin D supplementation that enrolled 68 132
women and an observational study cohort that enrolled 93 676
women. Details of the study design have been previously
published.8-10 The protocols were approved by the institu-
tional review boards at all clinical sites, and all women pro-
vided written informed consent. The present study was addi-
tionally approved by the institutional review board at UCLA.
Data collection for the main WHI study started in January
1,1993,andendedDecember31,2005,at40clinicalcenters,and
additional observational data were collected in 2 WHI exten-
sionstudiesfromJanuary1,2005,throughDecember31,2010,11
andfromJanuary1,2010,throughDecember31,2015.12ForWHI
participants who are also enrolled in Medicare, WHI data are
linkedonanindividualleveltoallInternationalClassificationof
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)13 diag-
nosis codes and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)14 codes
in the administrative Medicare database.
Study Population
The study population consisted of all WHI participants
who had an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for cataract in the linked
Medicare database at 65 years or older (eTable 1 in Supplement
1). Participants younger than 65 years at the time of cataract
diagnosis in Medicare were excluded owing to selective indi-
cations for Medicare enrollment before 65 years of age. Par-
ticipants who were younger than 65 years at the time of WHI
enrollment were not included in the study population until the
age of cataract diagnosis in the Medicare database, which de-
fined their age at study baseline.
Cataract Surgery Status
Theexposureofinterestwascataractsurgery.Thecataractsur-
gery group consisted of all participants with an ICD-9-CM di-
agnosis code for cataract and a CPT code for cataract surgery
(eTable 1 in Supplement 1). The cataract diagnosis group con-
sisted of all participants with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for
cataract without a CPT code for cataract surgery. Patients in
both groups were followed up starting from the date of earli-
est diagnostic code for cataract.
Outcome
The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality be-
fore December 31, 2015. Death and underlying cause of death
were determined at the clinical coordinating center by re-
viewofmedicalrecordsordeathcertificatesand,insomecases,
by reports from participants’relatives or by the National Death
Index.15 Of 31 311 total discovered deaths in the WHI cohort as
of December 31, 2015, cause of death was ascertained from
medicalrecordreviewfor21 887participants(69.9%),fromthe
initial cause of death form for 2466 (7.9%), and from the ICD-
9-CMcodefor6958(22.2%).Inthisstudy,causesofdeathwere
grouped into vascular, cancer-related, accident-related, neu-
rologic, pulmonary, and infectious conditions (eTable 2 in
Supplement 1).
For the cataract diagnosis group, time to death was calcu-
lated as the number of days from cataract diagnosis to death.
For the cataract surgery group, time between cataract diag-
nosis and surgery was classified into follow-up time for cata-
ract diagnosis, and time after surgery was classified into fol-
low-up time for cataract surgery. Participants who did not have
a recorded death in the study were censored on the last known
date of WHI follow-up or on December 31, 2015, if they were
still enrolled.
Key Points
Question How is cataract surgery associated with mortality
outcomes in women with cataract?
Findings In this prospective cohort study of 74 044 participants
of the Women's Health Initiative with cataract, cataract surgery
was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality and
mortality attributed to vascular, cancer-related, accidental,
pulmonary, and infectious causes, even after adjusting for
demographics and systemic and ocular comorbidities.
Meaning In women with cataract, cataract surgery may be
associated with higher mortality risk related to multiple types of
systemic illness. However, this study cannot determine whether
death events are attributable to the surgery itself, a result of
surgery postponement, or other factors.

 Covariates
Demographics that were collected included age at the time of
cataract diagnosis in Medicare, race, US region of residence,
educational level, annual income, health insurance status at
the time of WHI enrollment, use of preventive health ser-
vices(mammographyandPapanicolaousmear),andWHIstudy
arm. Systemic comorbidities in the Charlson Comorbidity In-
dex (CCI)16 were assessed at the time of surgery and the time
of diagnosis for the cataract surgery group and at the time of
diagnosis for the cataract diagnosis group (eTable 3 in
Supplement 1). The CCI is a weighted index of systemic dis-
ease burden (range, 0-33), and a higher CCI score indicates a
higher burden of systemic disease.16 Ocular comorbidities col-
lected included age-related macular degeneration and glau-
coma. A participant was counted as having a systemic or ocu-
lar comorbidity if she had the disease based on the WHI
indicatorvariableforthedisease,anICD-9-CMcodeforthedis-
ease in Medicare, or both (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). The WHI
verified the following outcomes by central medical record re-
view: all cancers, myocardial infarction, congestive heart fail-
ure, stroke, other cardiovascular events, pulmonary emboli,
hip fracture, and dementia (only in the WHI Memory Study
subcohort).
Becauseobjectivevisualacuitydatawerenotavailable,the
presence of severe cataract was examined as a proxy for poor
vision. Patients with ICD-9-CM codes for subcapsular cata-
racts, total or mature cataract, hypermature cataract, and com-
bined cataracts were considered to have severe subtypes of
cataract (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).
Additional covariates collected included smoking status,
alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and physical
activity. Smoking status and alcohol intake were self-
reportedatstudybaseline.WedeterminedBMIbasedonheight
and weight measurements from study baseline. Physical ac-
tivitywasbasedonmetabolicequivalenttasksperweek,which
were calculated from self-reported physical activity habits at
baseline and at years 3 and 6.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed for this study from July 1, 2014, through
September 1, 2017. Patient characteristics and mortality rates
were compared by cataract surgery status descriptively. To
comparethesourceofdiagnosisforsystemiccomorbiditiesthat
were ascertained from the WHI and Medicare databases, we
performed χ2 tests for the diagnosis source for selected car-
diovascular and cancer-related comorbidities. Log-rank tests
were used to compare crude mortality rates by surgical sta-
tus. Cox regression models with time-varying covariate cata-
ract surgery status (exposure) were used to obtain covariate-
adjusted associations from cataract surgery and time to death
due to any cause and from cataract surgery and time to death
attributed to vascular, cancer, accidental, neurologic, pulmo-
nary, and infectious conditions. All demographic, CCI score,
ocular comorbidities, cataract severity, smoking status, alco-
hol intake, physical activity, and BMI data were included as co-
variates in the model. To account for potential confounding
by indication, propensity scores were created by regressing all
covariates on cataract surgery status to determine the prob-
ability of cataract surgery. Participants were then grouped by
propensity score strata, and time to all-cause mortality was
compared between participants in the cataract surgery and
cataract diagnosis groups within propensity score deciles with
Cox models with cataract surgery as a time-varying covari-
ate. P < .05 indicated significance.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and eTable
5 in Supplement 1. The study cohort included 74 044 women
(mean [SD] age, 70.5 [4.6] years), of whom 41 735 were in the
cataract surgery group and 32 309 were in the cataract diag-
nosis group. The largest proportion of patients in the cataract
surgery and cataract diagnosis groups were aged 65 to 69 years
at the time of cataract diagnosis (45.6% and 55.6%, respec-
tively). The remainder of demographic factors were similar in
both groups. The most common systemic comorbidity in both
groups was solid malignant neoplasm (29.9% in the cataract
surgery and 23.6% in the cataract diagnosis groups), and the
most common ocular comorbidity was glaucoma (31.6% in the
cataract surgery and 17.5% in the cataract diagnosis groups).
Higher proportions of most comorbidities were found in the
surgery group at the time of surgery. When diagnosis sources
for selected systemic comorbidities were compared, 6.2% to
40.8% of comorbidities were diagnosed in the WHI and Medi-
care databases, whereas the remainder were diagnosed in 1 da-
tabase only (eTable 6 in Supplement 1). In both groups, most
participants were never smokers (51.5% in the cataract sur-
gery and 51.8% in the cataract diagnosis groups, of those with
availabledata),had1tolessthan7alcoholicbeveragesperweek
(25.8% in the cataract surgery and 27.1% in the cataract diag-
nosis groups, of those with available data), had a BMI of less
than 25 (36.2% in the cataract surgery and 36.7% in the cata-
ractdiagnosisgroups),andhadactivitylevelsof5to12MET/wk
(64.8% in the cataract surgery and 64.5% in the cataract di-
agnosis groups, of those with available data).
Mortality Incidence
Data on mortality incidence are summarized in Table 2. The
crude incidence of all-cause mortality was 2.56 deaths per 100
person-years in the cataract surgery group and 1.45 deaths per
100 person-years in the cataract diagnosis group (P < .001 for
log-rank test comparing crude mortality incidence in both
groups).
Multivariable Associations Between Cataract Surgery
and Mortality
Multivariable associations between cataract surgery and each
type of mortality treating cataract surgery as a time-varying
covariate are summarized in Table 3. Cataract surgery was as-
sociated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality in the un-
adjusted model (hazards ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.18-1.27) and
adjusted model (adjusted HR [AHR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11).
Cataract surgery was also associated with higher hazards for

for the subgroups so obtained, we observed a high hazard rate
ratioforall-causemortalityforthegroupsofwomenmostlikely

subgroups (Table 5).
Discussion
In participants with cataract in the WHI, cataract surgery
was associated with a higher risk for total and cause-specific
mortality (except for neurologic cause) after adjusting for
demographics, systemic and ocular comorbidities, and
selected lifestyle factors. Specifically, WHI participants after
cataract surgery had relatively higher risks for dying due to
any cause and due to vascular, cancer, accidental, pulmo-
nary, and infectious conditions compared with participants
with a cataract who did not receive surgery. Our study
design does not allow us to distinguish whether the empiri-
cally observed increases in the hazard for these death
events are attributable to the surgery itself or whether they
are a result of individually postponing surgery until a point
in time where hazard rates are increasing in addition to the
general effects of the covariates we do adjust for, such as
age at cataract diagnosis.
A previous study of cataract surgery and mortality in the
USMedicarepopulation3 reportedthatcataractsurgerywasas-
sociated with a lower hazard for all-cause mortality in patients
withcataractafteradjustingfordemographicsandsystemicand
ocular comorbidities, which was also seen in a subgroup analy-
sis of women within the Medicare population. In the present
study, we were able to adjust additionally for smoking, alcohol
use, BMI, and physical activity. In addition, we used an ap-
proach treating cataract surgery status as a time-varying covar-
iate, and our overall results suggested that cataract surgery is
associated with higher all-cause and (most) cause-specific
causes of mortality. This approach accounts for the time from
diagnosis to actual surgery reflecting that women at the time
of diagnosis initially continue to contribute observational time
to the nonsurgery group. While the empirically observed in-
creases in the hazard rates for all-cause or cause-specific mor-
tality might be attributable to the surgery itself, other possible
explanations remain: our results might be affected by unob-
served confounding that we are not aware of, as is typical for
observational studies. Furthermore, the empirically observed
increases in the hazard rates might be the result of individu-
allypostponingsurgeryuntilapointintimewherehazardrates
would increase in addition to the general effects of the covari-
ates we do adjust for, such as age at cataract diagnosis.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the as-
sociation between cataract surgery and cause-specific mor-
tality, and results from time-varying covariate Cox models sug-
gest that cataract surgery is associated with a higher hazard
rate for all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
In the present study, a mediational analysis was not per-
formed to examine potential mechanisms to explain the as-
sociation between cataract surgery and mortality from differ-
ent systemic causes. However, we hypothesize that the
mechanism of association is multifactorial and can vary across
systemic conditions. The cataract surgery group demon-
strated a higher mortality rate compared to the cataract diag-
nosis group, as well as an overall sicker systemic disease pro-
file; we suspect that these differences cannot be explained by
cataract surgery alone and that patients with cataract who do
and do not receive surgery have inherent demographic, so-
cioeconomic,andsystemicdifferencesthatmustbefurtherex-
plored in future studies.
Although limited studies examine the association
between cataract surgery and systemic conditions, previous
studies17-19 have demonstrated associations between
cataract surgery and lower risk for fall and fracture, and
others20-22 have demonstrated that patients with cataract
have higher scores on standardized cognition assessments
after cataract surgery. However, these studies did not exam-
ine the associations between these systemic conditions and
eventual mortality. Because our observed elevated hazard
rates might be a result of the individual timing of the sur-
gery, which is elective for the respective patient, studies
specifically targeting at which point in life cataract surgery
is best performed hold promise for further insight into the
benefits or harms of cataract surgery. Also, additional stud-
ies could specifically examine the association of cataract

Limitations
This study is mainly limited by its observational nature. Par-
ticipation in the WHI is voluntary, and generalizability of find-
ings from this cohort may be limited by differential partici-
pantdropout.Inaddition,becausetheWHIcohortisallfemale,
findings from this study may not be generalizable to male pa-
tients, and additional studies of cataract surgery and mortal-
ityinamalepopulationwouldbebeneficial.Furthermore,WHI
participants are long-term study participants, and their demo-
graphic and systemic disease profiles may differ from those of
the general population of women in the United States. An-
other finding of interest in this study that may limit its gener-
alizabilityistheunusuallyhighproportionofpatientswithsys-
temic comorbidities compared with previous studies,3
especially in the cataract surgery group. We hypothesize that
the explanation for these differences is multifactorial and
mainly related to the ability to combine the WHI and Medi-
care databases, which may lead to increased detection of co-
morbidities compared with a single data collection modality
that was supported by the significant proportion of cardiovas-
cular and cancer-related comorbidities that were only diag-
nosed in 1 of the 2 databases between WHI and Medicare. In
addition, follow-up with primary care physicians may have
been better among WHI participants who have proven reli-
able follow-up with regular study visits, which would lead to
increaseddetectionofsystemicdisease.Theobservationaldata
in this study are also subject to misclassification bias, includ-
ing the accuracy of cause-of-death data. Previous studies have
demonstrated that cardiovascular disease is overrepresented
as a cause of death,23 in addition to suggesting high rates of
misclassification of causes of death from other sources of
illness.24-26Inthepresentstudy,higherratesofmetastaticcan-
cer but lower rates of cancer-related deaths in the cataract sur-
gery vs cataract diagnosis group were found, suggesting that
our findings should be interpreted in light of the inherent limi-
tations of cause-of-death data. In addition, unmeasured con-
foundingisapossibility.Finally,althoughhighermortalityrates

a causal association between cataract surgery and increased
mortality, and additional study of the mechanisms and inter-
playbetweentheseassociationsiswarrantedasisfurtherstudy
of the timing of cataract surgery for those women who ulti-
mately elect to have such a surgery.
Conclusions
This study found associations between cataract surgery and
higher risks for total and several types of cause-specific
mortality in participants of the WHI. Our study design does
not allow us to distinguish whether the empirically
observed increases in the hazard for these death events are
attributable to the surgery itself or whether they are a result
of individually postponing surgery until a point in time
where hazard rates are increasing in addition to the general
effects of the covariates we do adjust for, such as age at
cataract diagnosis. Further studies of the associations
cataract surgery, systemic disease, and disease-specific
mortality would be informative for improving patient selec-
tion and use of cataract surgery and for improved under-
standing of the benefits of cataract surgery beyond vision
improvement.
