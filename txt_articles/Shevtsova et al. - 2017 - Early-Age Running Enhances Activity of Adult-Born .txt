Abstract
Cognitive reserve, the brain’s capacity to draw on enriching experiences during youth, is believed to protect
against memory loss associated with a decline in hippocampal function, as seen in normal aging and neurode-
generative disease. Adult neurogenesis has been suggested as a specific mechanism involved in cognitive (or
neurogenic) reserve. The first objective of this study was to compare learning–related neuronal activity in
adult-born versus developmentally born hippocampal neurons in juvenile male rats that had engaged in extensive
running activity during early development or reared in a standard laboratory environment. The second objective
was to investigate the long-term effect of exercise in rats on learning and memory of a contextual fear (CF)
response later in adulthood. These aims address the important question as to whether exercise in early life is
sufficient to build a reserve that protects against the process of cognitive aging. The results reveal a long-term
effect of early running on adult-born dentate granule neurons and a special role for adult-born neurons in
contextual memory, in a manner that is consistent with the neurogenic reserve hypothesis.

Introduction
Cognitive reserve refers to the brain’s capacity to draw on
enriching experiences during youth to protect against ad-
verse effects of structural decline, as in normal aging, and
neuropathological damage resulting from accident or dis-
ease (Stern, 2002). A number of factors, including physical
exercise, education (Puccioni and Vallesi, 2012), occupation,
and lifestyle (Fratiglioni and Wang, 2007), contribute to cogni-
tive reserve, which has been viewed as a compensatory mech-
anism for optimizing function in the compromised brain.

Significance Statement
The role of adult neurogenesis in learning and memory is under active investigation, but the underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. The present study found that early-age running led to enhanced associative
learning and memory in adult rats and increased activity of adult-born granule neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG)
during memory retrieval. This study demonstrates the long-term effect of early-age physical activity on learning
and memory much later in life. The findings emphasize the involvement of adult-born hippocampal neurons in
neurogenic and functional cognitive reserve and show that physical activity contributes to memory improvement.

 The relationship between cognitive protection and brain
plasticity is central to the concept of cognitive reserve but
our understanding of specific brain mechanisms involved
is limited. One possibility may relate to adult neurogen-
esis, the capacity to produce new cells in the hippocam-
pus that become integrated into neuronal networks of
learning and memory. Several investigators have shown
that physical exercise and other types of environmental
enrichment increase neurogenesis levels (van Praag et al.,
1999) and improve performance on hippocampus-sensi-
tive tests of cognition (Farmer et al., 2004). Based on
these findings, Kempermann proposed a “neurogenic re-
serve” hypothesis in which the potential for adult neuro-
genesis is maintained. According to this hypothesis, the
continued exposure to stimulating events in young age
leads to the increased production of new hippocampal
neurons to support cognitive function in old age (Kemper-
mann, 2008).
In previous studies, we used voluntary running to in-
crease the levels of hippocampal neurogenesis in juvenile
rats and examine neurogenesis levels at various time
points, up to nine months later (Merkley et al., 2014).
Voluntary running was chosen as an enriching activity
because of its known effects on neurogenesis (van Praag
et al., 1999), and associated effects on learning and mem-
ory (van Praag et al., 2005; Abrous and Wojtowicz, 2016).
Our study provided the first evidence that early life phys-
ical activity in rodents can build a long-lasting neurogenic
reserve later in life (Merkley et al., 2014).
The question addressed in the present study is whether
voluntary running during early development can contrib-
ute to such a process in later adulthood. To test whether
neurogenic reserve serves as a mechanism to improve
memory, one group of rats was given voluntary access to
running wheels for six weeks and another group was
housed in standard laboratory cages. After four months
rats were trained on a contextual fear (CF) conditioning
task and, two weeks later, tested for memory of the CF
response. CF is known to depend on the hippocampus
and, in particular, new hippocampal neurons (Winocur
et al., 2006; Winocur et al., 2012). Rats received CF
conditioning when they were six to seven months old. At
that age, a potential reserve mechanism would be primed
for possible use in case of damage or disease, but not yet
engaged in a compensatory manner.
Testing was done in the original conditioning context, a
similar one, or a very different context, to provide infor-
mation on the quality of memories. The purpose of ma-
nipulating context at test was to determine if these effects
generalized to contexts that bore some similarity to the
conditioning chamber but were not associated directly
with shock. A novel aspect of the present study was the
utilization of c-Fos-immunoreactivity to measure the ac-
tivity of adult born neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) in
response to testing. Using immunohistochemical meth-
ods with a mitotic marker 5-chloro-2’-deoxyuridine (CldU)
and an activity marker c-Fos, we were able to demon-
strate the enhanced activity of adult-born dentate granule
neurons in comparison to developmentally born neurons.
Materials and Methods
Experimental design
One-month-old (juvenile) male rats (n � 80) were
housed for six weeks in specially designed cages with
free access to running wheels, or in standard laboratory
cages. After one week of acclimatization, the rats were
divided into two groups, runners (n � 40) and non-runners
(n � 40), and kept in single cages throughout the study.
Runners and non-runners were maintained under the
same housing conditions, including ad libitum access to
food and water, except that cages of runners were fitted
with a running wheel (circumference: 1.07 m). Running
was monitored daily by means of a Vital View data acqui-
sition system (Mini-Mitter A Respironics Company).
After six weeks, the running wheels were removed and
the animals housed in pairs for four months in standard
laboratory cages conditions for the remainder of the ex-
periment (see below). The running and non-running
groups were subdivided into four subgroups. (1) No train-
ing and no test (controls). (2) Context A. (3) Context A’.
And (4) context B. Three weeks before CF conditioning, all
rats received a CldU injection. When the rats were six to
seven months old, they were trained on a standard form of
CF conditioning (Winocur et al., 2006). Two weeks later,
memory for the fear response was tested in the original
conditioning chamber (context A), a similar chamber (con-
text A’), or a very different chamber (context B).
Animals were killed shortly after testing, and adult neu-
rogenesis in the DG of the hippocampus was analyzed.
Training and testing environments, as well as tissue col-
lection, processing, and immunohistochemistry, are de-
scribed in detail below. The experimental timeline is
shown in Figure 1.
Animals
Long Evans rats (Charles River) were used in this study.
All animals were maintained on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle
with lights on at 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. Animal weights were
recorded regularly and animal procedures were in accor-
dance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on
Animal Care. The experimental protocol was approved by
the Animal Care Committee at the University of Toronto
and Trent University.
Running
Running distances were monitored daily as well as the
time of day that each animal spent running. The records
showed that the rats predominantly ran during the dark

 phase of their cycle. Cumulative running distance or av-
erage distance traveled did not differ between cohorts
designated to testing and control groups but the distance
covered across the entire running period of six weeks
increased progressively for all groups. Thus, rats ran an
average of 21.8 (SD � 14.8) km during week 1 and
reached the maximum of 71.1 (SD � 57.9) km during
weeks five and six.
Training and testing environments
All rats received CF conditioning in a wooden chamber
(50 � 40 � 18 cm) that had four walls made of clear
Plexiglas, a hinged clear Plexiglas roof with holes to allow
ventilation, and a floor that consisted of metal rods,
spaced 1.3 cm apart. The chamber was placed on a table,
1.3 m above the floor, and situated in the center of a
standard laboratory room. The room contained standard
furniture (e.g., desk, table, bookshelf along one wall, etc.),
as well as pictures, light fixtures, etc. on the walls. Illumi-
nation was provided by overhead fluorescent lights under
rheostatic control.
Training procedures for CF conditioning were similar to
those followed in previous studies (Winocur et al., 2006;
2007). Each rat received one fear conditioning trial that
began with the rat being placed in the chamber and
allowed to explore freely for 5 min. Near the end of the
exploration period and over a 64-s period, eight observa-
tions of freezing behavior were recorded every 8 s to
obtain a preshock measure of freezing. Freezing was
defined by an immobilized crouching response in which
the only detectable movement was the rat’s breathing.
Behavior was monitored by an overhead video camera
connected to a recorder and data processing system that
recorded the time spent freezing. The rat then received 10
tone-shock pairings at 2-min intervals (tone: 2000 Hz;
80–90 db, 30 s; shock: 1.5 mA; 1 s). The tone was
presented through a centrally mounted speaker attached
to the box, and the shock was delivered by TechServe
(Model 452A shock generator). Beginning 30 s after the
last shock and over a 64-s period, freezing behavior was
recorded every 8 s (eight observations). One minute later,
the rat was removed from the box and returned to its
home cage.
For testing, rats assigned to context A were tested in
the same chamber and environment as in CF condition-
ing. Rats in context A’ were tested in the same chamber
but the environment was slightly changed (e.g., room
objects rearranged, lighting dimmed slightly). Rats in the
context B were tested in a smaller box (40 � 30 � 18 cm),
also made of Plexiglas but with walls that were lined with
opaque gray material. The roof was clear Plexiglas with
ventilation holes and the floor consisted of metal rods,
spaced 1.3 cm apart. This test box was placed in a
different room on a table that was situated against a wall.
Care was taken to ensure that the configuration of furni-
ture, pictures, etc., was different from that of the room in
which fear conditioning took place. Testing procedures
were identical in all conditions. Testing consisted of a
single trial in which the rat was placed in the appropriate
box for 8 min, and in the absence of the tone, the amount
of time spent freezing was recorded. The rat was then
removed from the box and returned to its home cage.
CldU injections
Three weeks before contextual fear conditioning (CFC)
training, each rat was injected intraperitoneally with thy-
midine analog CldU (105478, MP Biomedicals). The in-
jected solution was prepared by dissolving CldU in saline
at 10 mg/ml and adjusting the pH to 7 with 0.5 �l of 10 N
NaOH/ml saline. The injected dose was 85 mg of CldU/kg.
Tissue collection and processing
Ninety minutes after testing animals were deeply anes-
thetized with isoflurane inhalation followed by transcardial
perfusion with 300 ml ice-cold PBS followed by 300 ml
ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Following decapi-
tation, brains were removed and placed in PFA for 24 h at
Figure 1. Experimental timeline. At one month of age, a group of 40 rats was exposed to running wheel while the other group was
kept in standard cages for six weeks. All rats were trained on the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task in context A. Two weeks after
training, 10 rats from each group were tested in context A, A’, or B. The remaining rats served as untested controls. Mitotic marker
CldU was injected three weeks before training. Ninety minutes after the test, all animals were perfused for immunohistochemistry.

 4°C. After postfix, brains were placed in PBS containing
0.1% sodium azide and stored until further processing.
Immunohistochemistry
Brains were cut in half, and the hippocampus was
dissected from the right hemisphere in each animal. Iso-
lated hippocampi were sectioned along the dorso-ventral
axis using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems)
into sections 30 �m thick. The sections were stored in
PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide at 4°C until staining.
Twelve sections were selected from each animal using
a systematic random sampling procedure previously
described (Wojtowicz and Kee, 2006). All immunohisto-
chemistry was conducted on free floating sections. Im-
portantly, sections were rinsed extensively in PBS before
processing and between each incubation. All primary and
secondary antibody incubations were conducted in a PBS
solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100. In experiments
involving labeling of CldU, sections were incubated at
45°C for 30 min in HCl (1.0 N) to denature DNA and
unmask the antigen before incubation in primary anti-
body, preceded and followed by extensive rinsing.
Detection of c-Fos and CldU
To identify cell survival and activity of newly formed
cells, double-label immunohistochemistry was conducted
for CldU and immediate early gene (IEG) protein c-Fos.
Sections were incubated sequentially, with primary anti-
c-Fos antibody (1:2000, 72 h at 4°C; Millipore, ABE457),
followed by secondary antibody donkey anti-rabbit IgG
Alexa Fluor 568 (1:200, 2 h at room temperature (RT), Life
Technologies, A10042) in dark; afterward, to detect CldU,
the tissue was incubated with primary antibody rat anti-
BrdU (1:1500, 24 h at 4°C, AbD Serotec, OBT0030), fol-
lowed by secondary antibody goat anti-rat IgG Alexa
Fluor 488 (1:200, 2 h at RT, Life Technologies, A11006).
This particular antibody can bind to CldU with high affinity
(Merkley et al., 2014). In all experiments, sections were
mounted onto glass slides using double-distilled water
(ddH2O), and coverslipped using PermaFluor (Thermo
Scientific). Immunohistochemical controls included the
omission of primary antibodies, which resulted in lack of
staining at the corresponding wavelength in each in-
stance.
Quantification of cells and cell counts
All the single immunolabeled cells in the granule cell
layer (GCL) zone of the DG were counted using a fluo-
rescent microscope (Nikon, Eclipse Ni). Double-labeled
neurons were visualized using Leica TCS SP5 confocal
microscope (Leica Microsystems). The average number of
cells per sampling section was multiplied by the number
of hippocampal sections to yield the total number of cells
per DG in each rat. Twelve sections were initially sampled
from each animal. The sampling was repeated twice or in
some animals three times to reach a minimum of at least
30 CldU� cells per animal. On average 68.3 (SD � 34.3,
n � 80) CldU� cells per animal were examined for
double-labeling with c-Fos.
Statistical analysis
For immunohistochemistry and behavioral data, differ-
ences between groups were analyzed using two-way
ANOVA with running and testing as variables. All pairwise
multiple comparisons were conducted using the Holm-
Sidak post hoc test or, in case of behavioral data, the
Bonferroni multiple comparisons procedure. All values
were expressed as mean � SEM or SD when appropriate.
Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Plot 12.0
software (Systat Software). The level of statistical signifi-
cance was set at p � 0.05.
Results
Hippocampal neurons are activated during a
contextual learning task
A necessary element of this study is a measure of
overall activity in the hippocampal neurons, especially
those in the DG. For this purpose, we used a c-Fos protein
detected by immunohistochemistry as a measure of
c-Fos gene expression. The results illustrated in Figure 2,
show c-Fos activity in the DG following test, which took
place two weeks after CFC training (Fig. 1, experimental
timeline). As expected, only a small fraction of the general
granule cell population expressed c-Fos in control ani-
mals (Fig. 2A). A similar result was obtained for the CA1
field of the hippocampus (Fig. 2-1, Extended data).
A two-way ANOVA comparing c-Fos activation within
the DG in early runners versus non-runners shows a
testing-induced increase in c-Fos (F � 15.9, p � 0.001)
that was equal in runners and non-runners (F(1,79) � 0.297,
p � 0.588) with no interactions among the variables
(F(1,79) � 0.063, p � 0.979; Fig. 2B). On subsequent
examination of different contexts, the results showed that
this testing-induced increase in the number of c-Fos�
cells generalized to all contexts, as shown by similar
levels of activation in all tested subgroups in both running
and non-running conditions (Fig. 2C). These results are a
robust indication that DG and the hippocampus as a
whole participates in the CFC task and that early running
does not influence this activity.
Additional estimates of granule cell volumes revealed
no significant differences among the groups (two-way
ANOVA using running (p � 0.116) and testing (p � 0.883)
as variables; data not shown). Thus, the test-induced
increase in the hippocampal c-Fos activity is a true mea-
sure of the increased activity among the pre-existing neu-
rons and not an effect on hippocampal growth.
c-Fos activity is related to adult-born neurons and
enhanced by running
To determine if the c-Fos activity was related to adult-
born granule neurons rather than to the pre-established
general population, the densities of double-labeled cells
(c-Fos/CldU) were measured. The animals were injected
with CldU three weeks before training thus labeling a
cohort of five-week-old neurons at the time of testing.
This age was chosen to ensure a full maturity and func-

 tionality of the neurons in terms of IEG expression (Snyder
et al., 2009).
The estimates demonstrate that the proportion of active
cells is �3% in cage controls, and up to 7% in tested
runners (Fig. 3B). In terms of absolute numbers, the
c-Fos�/CldU� cells (non-runner controls, mean � 20.4;
SD � 3.5/DG) were less numerous than the c-Fos� cells
in the general DG population (compare to Fig. 2). How-
ever, the percentage activation numbers show that, not
only are the adult-born neurons more active than a gen-
eral population but also their activity is significantly en-
hanced in early runners as compared to non-runners in
tested animals (two-way ANOVA for running (F(1,79) �
5.837, p � 0.018), testing (F(1,79) � 13.946, p � 0.001) and
(F(1,79) � 10.115, p � 0.002) interactions; Fig. 3B).
Next, c-Fos activity was examined in relation to specific
tasks (A, A’, or B) administered to animals at the time of
testing. Context A representing the environment in which
the rats were trained, A’ representing a similar, and B a
completely novel environment (Fig. 4).
Two-way ANOVA performed on the absolute numbers
of the double-labeled cells shows significant effects of
running (F(1,79) � 23.57, p � 0.001), testing (F(3,79) � 5.582,

effect of testing (F(3,79) � 10.838, �p � 0.001). There was no
effect of running (F(1,79) � 1.131, p � 0.291) and no interaction
(F(3,79) � 2.151, p � 0.101).

 p � 0.002), and significant interaction (F(3,79) � 2.872, p �
0.042; Fig. 4B). In particular, the three tested groups were
higher in comparison to controls (pairwise comparison at
p � 0.05). Also, the cell numbers in tested runners were
higher in comparison to those in tested non-runners.
There were no differences among any of the non-running
groups. Thus, the early-age running specifically enhances
the activity of adult-born five-week-old neurons when rats
are tested in the same, familiar or novel environment.
Importantly, the percentage c-Fos expression is elevated
in parallel to the absolute cells numbers. The increase
shown in Figure 4 is not due to enhanced cell survival in
tested runners since the numbers of CldU� cells did not
differ in any of the groups (Fig. 4-1, Extended data).
Memory selectivity is enhanced by running
The animals were administered CF conditioning in con-
text A two weeks before perfusion (Fig. 1, experimental
timeline). The performance of all groups following CF
conditioning and testing are presented in terms of per-
centage time the animals spent freezing (Fig. 5). Two-way
ANOVA of freezing times and running showed a signifi-
cant effect of running (F(1,54) � 11.672, p � 0.001) and
testing (F(2,54) � 3.692, p � 0.031). The interactions be-
tween running and testing could not be adequately exam-
ined due to a low statistical power (0.05); however, a
pairwise comparison with the Bonferroni t test revealed a
significant difference between runners and non-runners
within context A’ (p � 0.01) and B (p � 0.049) but not
within A (p � 0.219).
These effects were specific for memory testing since
the conditioning (training) phase showed no difference in
learning. The percentage freezing scores in runners (84.2,
SE � 3.5) and non-runners (78, SE � 4.3) were not
different (t � 1.027, 58 df, p � 0.31). In summary, these
behavioral results show no effect of running on memory of
the familiar context (A) but reduced freezing in the similar
(A’) and completely different (B) contexts. The results
parallel the c-Fos activation in adult-born granule DG
neurons showing selective activation in runners but not in
non-runners.
Discussion
The most striking result of this study is the effect of
early-age running on memory-related neuronal activity
(Figs. 3, 4). This is the first evidence of such a long-term
effect and a confirmation of an animal model of cognitive
reserve. The model was based on numerous human stud-

 ies which used a variety of forms of enrichment to induce
the reserve phenomenon reviewed in (Merkley and Woj-
towicz, 2016). Running is known to reliably induce in-
creases in adult neurogenesis and enhance cognitive
function in animals and in humans (Déry et al., 2013;
Hutton et al., 2015). The six-week period of running was
based on a previous study and is sufficient to produce a
maximal effect since running reached a maximum at that
period (see Materials and Methods). A relatively high
6-7% of c-Fos in adult-born neurons, as shown in Figure
3, is far greater than the sparse activation of �1% seen in
the developmentally born neurons in agreement with pre-
vious estimates (Chawla et al., 2005; Ramirez-Amaya
et al., 2006) and our data in Figure 2.
In the present study, rats in the running condition, that
were found to exhibit enhanced neurogenesis, also froze
less than non-runners when tested in contexts A’ and B
indicating better discriminability of the contextual environ-
ments and less generalization of the fear response. There
is considerable evidence that the ability to discriminate
between overlapping stimulus elements (pattern separa-
tion), is associated with hippocampal function (Leutgeb
et al., 2007) and, in particular, adult neurogenesis in DG
(Clelland et al., 2009; Abrous and Wojtowicz, 2016; McA-
voy et al., 2016). The present results extend previous
reports by showing that adult neurogenesis can be en-
hanced by early experience and, as a mechanism under-
lying pattern separation, can be mediated through a
build-up of cognitive reserve. The enduring effects of early
running may have occurred at the level of stem cells
and/or the neurogenic milieu, presumably in the sub-
granular zone of the DG. Hippocampal afferents are
known to influence the neurogenic zone by stimulating
distinct phases of cellular growth and development (Wo-
jtowicz and Tan, 2016) and epigenetic influences on pro-
genitors that could mediate such changes have been
described (Ma et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2016).
Runners tested in context A also exhibited more activity
in adult-born cells than non-runners, but the groups did
not differ in freezing time. This outcome was not neces-
sarily expected but is understandable when considering
the dynamic changes that occur in CF memory over time
(Winocur et al., 2010). Several studies have shown that CF
memories, when initially encoded in the hippocampus, are
highly context specific and do not generalize to other
environments. After a few days, these memories trans-
form into less specific schematic memories that can be
evoked by a sample of the original contextual cues or
even by new contexts that bear only a slight similarity to
the original (Wiltgen and Silva, 2007; Winocur et al., 2007).
In the normal animal, the context-specific and non-
specific versions can coexist and the type of memory that
is expressed depends on several factors (Winocur et al.,
2013). It is likely that, in the present study, the runners,
with elevated neurogenesis activity and enhanced hip-
pocampal function, were expressing hippocampus-de-
pendent, context-specific memory of the fear memory,
whereas the non-runners were retrieving the more gen-
eral, schematic version that is believed to be represented
in a network of cortical regions.
The influence of early life experiences on learning and
memory in later life is a topic needing more study (Stern,
2012). Numerous human studies point to beneficial ef-
fects of educational and/or physical experiences during
youth on symptoms of cognitive decline in old age. The
idea was publicized by the “Nun study” which described
several examples of such life-long effects (Iacono et al.,
2009). As well, in line with the cognitive reserve hypothe-
sis, other survey-type studies have emphasized the im-
pact of early age experiences on cognitive performance in
late adulthood (Scarmeas and Stern, 2003; Petrosini,
2009). Qualitatively, cognitive reserve can be viewed as a
buffer or reservoir of plasticity acquired early in life, that is
used later in response to normal age-related decay or
pathologic damage. As such, cognitive reserve may con-
stitute an important part of the compensatory mecha-
nisms frequently observed in the compromised brain
(Wang et al., 2005).
There is considerable evidence that early physical and
cognitive activity can delay the onset of pathologic
changes that accelerate the process of cognitive decline
in old age (Valenzuela and Sachdev, 2006; Stern, 2012). In
animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) changes in the
adult neurogenesis often precede appearance of patho-
logic markers and cognitive symptoms of AD (Hamilton
et al., 2010; Krezymon et al., 2013). Thus, reduced levels
of adult neurogenesis may be a measure of early symp-
toms and a predictor of subsequent disease. If so, it
follows that early lifestyle related interventions (e.g., social
stimulation, physical exercise) that help to prevent such
effects through the build-up of a neurogenic reserve
(Merkley and Wojtowicz, 2016), may provide a measure of
protection against early cognitive impairment.
