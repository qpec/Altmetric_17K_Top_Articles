Abstract
Background: Studies have shown that more than half of patients with advanced progressive diseases approaching
the end-of-life report pain and that pain relief for these patients is poorest at home compared to other care
settings such as acute care facilities and hospice. Although home is the most common preferred place of death,
the majority of deaths occur outside the home. Specialist palliative care is associated with improved quality of life,
but systematic reviews of RCTs have failed to show a consistent association with better pain relief. The aim of this
study was to examine the factors associated with good pain relief at home in the last 3 months of life for people
with advanced progressive disease.
Methods: Data were obtained from the National Bereavement Survey in England, a cross-sectional post-
bereavement survey of a stratified random sample of 246,763 deaths which were registered in England from 2011
to 2015. From 110,311 completed surveys (45% response rate), the analysis was based on individual-level data from
43,509 decedents who were cared for at home before death.
Results: Decedents who experienced good pain relief at home before death were significantly more likely to have
received specialist palliative care (adjusted OR = 2.67; 95% CI, 2.62 to 2.72) and to have a recorded preferred place
of death (adjusted OR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.84 to 1.90) compared to those who did not. Good pain relief was more likely
to be reported by a spouse or partner of the decedents compared to reports from their son or daughter (adjusted
OR = 1.50, 95% CI, 1.47 to 1.53).
Conclusion: This study indicates that patients at home who are approaching the end-of-life experience
substantially better pain relief if they receive specialist palliative care and their preferred place of death is recorded
regardless of their disease aetiology.

 Introduction
Pain is a highly prevalent and debilitating problem
among people with advanced progressive disease [1, 2].
Studies have shown that more than 50% of patients with
advanced cancer and non-cancer diseases reported pain,
and the prevalence may increase as they approach the
end of life [2–4]. Managing pain in people approaching
the end of life is a major concern for health care profes-
sionals and a global public health priority [5, 6]. Despite
increased availability of strong opioids, many patients
still do not receive adequate analgesia for their pain [7].
Even in the UK, access to and duration of opioid treat-
ment is limited for patients before they die, and people
aged 60 years or older are less likely to receive opioids
compared to younger patients [8, 9].
Numerous studies have consistently shown a mis-
match between expressed preferences for place of death
and actual place of death with most people preferring to
die at home but the majority dying in hospital [10, 11].
Issues such as carer burden or difficulties in controlling
pain and other symptoms at home make the majority of
deaths occur outside the home [12, 13]. This is sup-
ported by evidence from the National Survey of Be-
reaved People (VOICES) in England which showed that
pain relief is poorest for people who received end-of-life
care at home compared to those dying in acute care fa-
cilities or hospice [14]. Only 19% of respondents re-
ported pain to be completely relieved in people who
were cared at their own home in comparison with 64%
in hospices, 43% in care homes and 40% in hospital [15].
UK policy supports the need for improved quality of
care for people dying at home, particularly relief from
pain [16–18].
Although specialist palliative care (compared to usual
care) is associated with improved quality of life, there is
inconclusive evidence from meta-analyses about the ef-
fect on reducing pain and symptom burden [19–25].
Pain relief in older adults and those with non-cancer dis-
ease may be harder to obtain because these patients have
limited access to specialist palliative care services com-
pared to younger patients and those diagnosed with can-
cer [14, 26–29]. We aimed to examine the factors
associated with good pain relief at home in the last
3 months of life for people with advanced progressive ill-
ness. Specifically, we sought to examine the relationship
between the extent of pain relief at home and receiving
specialist palliative care.
Methods
Population and data source
The National Survey of Bereaved People (VOICES,
Views of Informal Carers - Evaluation of Services) is a
nationally representative cross-sectional survey which
was conducted in England annually for 5 years, 2011–
2015,
to
collect
information
about
the
quality
of
end-of-life care, particularly in the last 3 months of life
[30]. The survey was commissioned by NHS England
and administered by the Office for National Statistics
(ONS). The survey’s results are based on a relative’s or
friends’ perspective on the quality of end-of-life care
provided to the decedent. Previous analyses of VOICES
data have been used to inform national policy on
end-of-life care service and assess and evaluate the qual-
ity of end-of-life care in different settings (home, hos-
pital, care homes and hospices) [31]. Every year, a
stratified sample of around 49,000 adults was selected
from deaths which are registered in England. The
VOICES questionnaire was sent by post to the person
who registered the death of the decedent who is nor-
mally a family member or a close friend. Respondents
were contacted once between 4 and 11 months after
death (two further reminder questionnaires were sent if
there was no response). The sampling weight and
non-response weight were created by the ONS for each
year. The sampling weight and non-response weight
were then combined by taking the product of the two.
We used the combined weight to adjust for sampling
and
non-response
biases.
Further
information
on
VOICES methodology is available from the ONS [30].
Sampling
We obtained data from five annual VOICES surveys
conducted between 2011 and 2015. During this period,
246,763 people were invited to participate, of whom
110,311 (45%) returned a completed questionnaire. Be-
cause VOICES survey does not contain information
about palliative care in settings other than home, we ex-
amined factors associated with good pain relief at home
in the last 3 months of life for people with advanced
progressive illness. In addition, the main outcome was
the success of pain relief at home which was applied
only to decedents who had pain at home in the last
3 months of life.
The following exclusion criteria were applied:
1. Decedent who died suddenly or were not ill prior to
death.
2. Decedent who did not spend any time at home in
the last 3 months of life.
3. Decedent who did not have any pain at home in the
last 3 months of life.
Independent variables
Respondent characteristics included age, gender and re-
lation to the decedent (spouse/partner, son/daughter,
other). Decedent characteristics included age, gender,
cause of death (cancer or non-cancer), index of multiple

 deprivation (IMD) quintiles (1 = most deprived, 5 = least
deprived), duration of illness before decedent died.
We developed variables for service characteristics la-
belled receiving specialist palliative care at home in the
last 3 months of life (yes or no), recorded preference for
place of death (yes or no) and urgent care provided out
of hours (once or twice, three times or more, not at all).
Specialist palliative care proxy measure
Respondents were asked about the decedent, ‘when he/
she was home in the last three months of life, did he/she
get any help from any of the services: hospice home care
nurse or specialist, hospice at home service, Macmillan
nurse or Marie Curie nurse? (Macmillan and Marie
Curie are UK-based charities that fund clinical nurse
specialists in palliative care who deal with cancer and
non-cancer patients). If respondents answered ‘yes’ to
any of the three questions, it was assumed that their
relative had received specialist palliative care in the last
3 months of their life, defined as professionals or ser-
vices whose core activity is providing palliative care. If
responders answered ‘no’ to all three questions, it was
considered for the purposes of this research that their
relative had not received specialist palliative care in the
last 3 months of their life.
Recorded preference for place of death
The survey asks about the decedent ‘Did she/he ever say
where she/he would like to die?’ If responders answered
‘yes’
, they were asked about the preferred place of death.
After that, they were asked ‘Did the health care staff
have a record of this?’ Having a preference recorded for
place of death in the medical records was used as a posi-
tive indicator for this variable.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the extent of pain relief at
home. We collapsed the response categories included in
the survey for ease of interpretation into: (1) good pain
relief (pain relieved completely, all of the time and com-
pletely, some of the time) and (2) poor pain relief (pain
relieved partially, not at all).
Statistical analysis
Based on individual-level survey data, numbers and
percentages
(both
unweighted
and
weighted)
were
calculated to summarise decedent and respondent char-
acteristics. Logistic regression models were used to
examine the association between decedent and respond-
ent characteristics and good pain relief. All variables that
had a p value less than 0.1 univariately (to account for
potential collinearity) were included in an initial multi-
variable model. As the aim of the analysis was to identify
factors associated with good pain relief, rather than
develop the most parsimonious model, variables were
retained in the final multivariable model if they im-
proved the fit of the model based on the likelihood-ratio
test (using backward selection p < 0.05). In the final
multivariable logistic regression model, we assessed po-
tential multicollinearity using the variance inflation fac-
tor (VIF). Statistical software IBM SPSS statistics version
24 was used for data management and analysis. We used
the published weights for the VOICES survey in the ana-
lysis to account for the study design and to adjust for
non-response bias [30].
Results
Of the 110,311 respondents to the VOICES question-
naire from 2011 to 2015, 66,802 (60.6%) respondents did
not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded
(Fig. 1). Therefore, 43,509 (39.3%) of respondents were
included in our analysis. Around 51.6% of decedents
were female and 59.8% of survey respondents were fe-
male (Table 1). Decedents aged 75 and older account for
60.9% of the study population. Over half of decedents
(52.1%) were ill for more than a year prior to death, and
51.2% of deaths were from non-cancer disease. Data
were missing for the following variables: How long had
she or he been ill prior to death (484, 1.1%), respondent
age (531, 1.2%), respondent’s relationship to decedent
(733, 1.6%) and respondent sex (2298, 5.1%).
Care and service characteristics by cause of death are
shown in Table 2. Overall, 35.7% of decedents received
specialist palliative care at home and 24.6% had a re-
corded preference for place of death. About 78.7% of de-
cedents had at least one out-of-hours service contact in
the last 3 months of life. Cancer decedents were more
likely to receive specialist palliative care support at home
(66.2% vs 9.9%), have a recorded preference of place of
death (36.6% vs 13.1%) and to contact out-of-hours ser-
vice in the last 3 months of life (81.6% vs 75.9%) com-
pared to non-cancer decedents.
Pain relief by cause of death is presented in Table 3.
Overall, just under half of the decedents in our study ex-
perienced good pain relief (47.8%). For decedents with
non-cancer disease, around 39.6% had good pain relief
compared to 56.4% of cancer decedents (p < 0.001).
Table 3 also compares pain relief by service character-
istics. This shows that 66.2% of decedents who received
specialist palliative care services at home experienced
good pain relief compared to 37.5% of those who did
not (p < 0.001). Among patients who had a recorded
preference for place of death, 66.0% had good pain relief
in comparison with only 41.7% of decedents who did
not (p < 0.001). Good pain relief stratified by cause of
death and service characteristics is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Univariately all characteristics were significantly asso-
ciated (p < 0.001) with good pain relief at home (Table 4)

 and remained in the final multivariable model. The mul-
tivariable model revealed a significantly higher chance of
experiencing good pain relief among those who received
specialist palliative care at home (adjusted OR = 2.67;
95% CI, 2.62 to 2.72) and who had a recorded preference
for place of death (adjusted OR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.84 to
1.90) in comparison with those who did not, keeping all
other characteristics constant (Table 4). In addition, com-
pared to decedents who did not contact out-of-hours ser-
vices, decedents who contacted out-of-hours services
three times or more were more likely to have good pain
relief (adjusted OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.07), while de-
cedents with one or two out-of-hours service contacts ex-
perienced worse pain relief (adjusted OR = 0.89; 95% CI,
0.87 to 0.91).
The results also showed that women had 3% higher
odds of good pain relief than compared to men (adjusted
OR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04), keeping all other char-
acteristics constant. In addition, shorter duration of ill-
ness
was
associated
with
reduced
probability
of
experiencing good pain relief in comparison with dece-
dents with illness for more than a year; that is, the odds
of good pain relief were 9% lower for decedents who
were ill between 1 month and 6 months prior to death
in comparison with decedents with illness for more than
a year. Moreover, decedents who died of cancer were
more likely to experience good pain relief (adjusted OR
= 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.10), compared to non-cancer
decedents and keeping all other characteristics constant.
Decedents aged 75 and older were more likely to ex-
perience good pain relief, compared to younger dece-
dents. For example, the odds of experiencing good pain
relief were 46% higher among decedents aged 85 and
older compared to younger decedents aged 74 or youn-
ger. Deprivation (IMD) was significantly associated with
good pain relief, but in a nonlinear pattern. For example,
compared to the most deprived quintile, decedents who
lived in the second least deprived quintile had signifi-
cantly higher odds of good pain relief while those in the
least deprived quintile had no difference in their odds of
good pain relief. The respondent’s relationship with de-
cedents was also significantly associated with good pain
relief. Good pain relief was more likely to be reported by
a spouse or partner of the decedent compared to a son
or daughter of the decedent (adjusted OR = 1.50, 95%
CI, 1.47 to 1.53), keeping all other characteristics
constant.
Multicollinearity did not appear to be present, based
on an evaluation using the variance inflation factor
(VIF). All VIF scores are less than 1.7. These scores are
well below the cutoff values of between 5 and 10, in
which collinearity may be problematic [32].
Discussion
Our analysis of 43,509 patients who were cared for at
home before death showed that receiving specialist pal-
liative care and have a recorded preference for place of
death were found to be strongly and independently

 associated with good pain relief in the last 3 months of
life. These findings have contributed to evidence sup-
porting the need for, and the benefits of, specialist pallia-
tive care and recording preferences for place of death for
patients with advanced disease. Furthermore, we have
demonstrated that respondents who were spouses or
partners of the decedents were much more likely to re-
port better pain relief that respondents who were sons
or daughters.
A major strength of this study is that we used data
from
the
first
national
survey
on
the
quality
of
end-of-life care in England. The response rate was mod-
est (45%) which could lead to bias. However, the re-
sponse rate provides a suitable sample size for analysis
at the national level and the weighting method we used
corrected for non-response and sample biases [30]. We
have also combined 5 data sets, 2011–2015 to increase
the sample size in order to improve data robustness.
The validated questionnaire and the large sample size
provided good statistical power from which generalisable
findings can be made.
Our study has a number of limitations. A key draw-
back is that it was an analysis of a post-bereavement sur-
vey which used the perceptions of decedent’s relatives as
proxy measure of the quality of care experienced by the
patient. Retrospective ratings of end-of-life care by dece-
dent’s relatives could be different from the actual experi-
ence of the decedent. Research is difficult to conduct on
patients with advanced progressive disease and although
the validity and reliability of proxies are questionable, it
may need to be accepted and utilised as a valuable part
of end-of-life research [33]. Without this proxy measure,
there are only few, poorly powered studies to inform im-
portant policy documents and the practice of end-of-life
care. Moreover, retrospective studies allow for more rep-
resentative samples to be studied as they are not limited
to diseases such as cancer that have an identifiable ter-
minal phase. It is better to have imperfect recollections
from proxies than it is to have no perceptions of
end-of-life care at all [33]. In addition, recall bias cannot
be excluded due to the timing of data collection being
4–11 months after death and the possibility of inaccur-
ately recalling subjective aspects such as pain.
Another important limitation of the findings is that we
were only able to demonstrate an association between
improved pain relief and specialist palliative care and re-
corded preference for place of death, but we cannot
demonstrate causality. However, it is entirely plausible
that contact with specialist palliative care or discussing
and recording preferred place of death results in better
pain relief, particularly because of the emphasis by spe-
cialist palliative care clinicians on symptom management
and
expertise
in
use
of
opioid
analgesia.
The
counter-argument that patients with good pain relief
‘cause’ a referral to specialist palliative care is much less
plausible as eligibility criteria for referral to specialist

 palliative care services include symptoms that are un-
controlled or complicated, i.e. patients have poor pain
relief not good pain relief [34]. This might also imply
that patients referred to specialist palliative care had
worse baseline pain than those not referred and that the
impact of specialist palliative care on pain relief is
underestimated in this analysis. The association between
good pain relief and recording of preferred place of
death is more difficult to explain. It may represent en-
gagement in broader aspects of advance care planning
which includes pain management strategies, and perhaps
reflects greater communication and engagement with

 healthcare professionals, both of which might lead to bet-
ter pain outcomes. The type of respondent influenced rec-
ollection of pain relief; spouses and partners rated pain
relief better than sons or daughters. Spouses and partners
are likely to have had closer contact than sons or daugh-
ters and perhaps represent a more reliable account. Con-
versely, spouses and partners are more likely to be older
and have potentially different (lower) expectations of
healthcare services and interventions than younger sons
and daughters resulting in inflated views of outcomes. Fi-
nally, we cannot exclude the possibility of uncontrolled
confounding by factors that were not measured within the
survey, for example the presence of other symptoms that
might trigger palliative care referral, other services that
patients received that were not captured within the survey
questions or presence of depression or anxiety within de-
cedents or respondents. Interestingly, decedents aged 75
and older were less likely to experience good pain relief,
compared to younger decedents in the univariable ana-
lysis, but following adjustment and multivariable analysis,
decedents aged 75 and older had a significantly higher
odds of good pain relief compared to younger decedents
(Table 4). The reason for this swing in direction of the as-
sociation might be due to confounding with other vari-
ables in the final multivariable model. While we checked
and found no evidence of a high degree of multicollinear-
ity, associations between both the outcome and age and
another variable(s) are likely to be present.
This is the largest study that shows a significant asso-
ciation between receiving specialist palliative care at
home and improved pain relief within routine clinical
services. Previous research has found an inconclusive re-
lationship between palliative care support and improved
pain relief. A US national study by Teno et al., which is
one of very few national surveys of family perspectives
on end-of-life care, supports our findings [35]. These au-
thors found that in 512 patients who died at home, pain
relief was significantly better in the 256 patients who re-
ceived care at home with hospice services compared to
receiving only home nursing services. In a systematic re-
view and meta-analysis of trials [19], which examined
the effectiveness of home palliative care, only 3 of 9
studies in which pain was an outcome measure found
statistically significant positive effects on pain relief.
Conclusion
Our study indicates that patients at home who are ap-
proaching the end-of-life experience substantially better
pain relief if they receive specialist palliative care or have
a recorded preference for place of death, regardless of
their disease aetiology. Policymakers should consider
how to ensure improvements in pain management for
patients at home through advice and support from com-
munity specialist palliative care services.
