Summary
Background Antimalarial resistance is rapidly spreading across parts of southeast Asia where dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine is used as first-line treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The first published reports about 
resistance to antimalarial drugs came from western Cambodia in 2013. Here, we analyse genetic changes in the 
P falciparum population of western Cambodia in the 6 years before those reports.
Methods We analysed genome sequence data on 1492 P falciparum samples from 11 locations across southeast Asia, 
including 464 samples collected in western Cambodia between 2007 and 2013. Different epidemiological origins of 
resistance were identified by haplotypic analysis of the kelch13 artemisinin resistance locus and the plasmepsin 2–3 
piperaquine resistance locus.
Findings We identified more than 30 independent origins of artemisinin resistance, of which the KEL1 lineage 
accounted for 140 (91%) of 154 parasites resistant to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. In 2008, KEL1 combined with 
PLA1, the major lineage associated with piperaquine resistance. By 2013, the KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage had reached a 
frequency of 63% (24/38) in western Cambodia and had spread to northern Cambodia.
Interpretation The KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage emerged in the same year that dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine became 
the first-line antimalarial drug in western Cambodia and spread rapidly thereafter, displacing other artemisinin-resistant 
parasite lineages. These findings have important implications for management of the global health risk associated 
with the current outbreak of multidrug-resistant malaria in southeast Asia.

Introduction
The first-line treatment for Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria is artemisinin combination therapy.1 Artemisinin 
and its derivatives are potent and fast-acting antimalarial 
drugs, but they are also short acting.2 The rationale 
behind artemisinin combination therapy is to combine 
artemisinin with a longer-acting partner drug to ensure 
that all parasites are killed and to prevent the emergence 
of resistance.3
In 2008, it became apparent that P falciparum was 
becoming resistant to artemisinin in western Cambodia, 
and over the next few years resistance was observed in 
other parts of Cambodia, as well as in Thailand, Vietnam, 
Myanmar, and Laos.4–6 Although this finding caused 
widespread concern, there were some mitigating factors. 
First, resistance to artemisinin was not complete—ie, 
artemisinin treatment continued to reduce parasitaemia, 
albeit at a slower rate than before. Second, partner drugs 
of artemisinin combination therapy were able to clear 
parasites despite the slower response of parasites to 
artemisinin; thus, artemisinin combination therapy 
remained effective as first-line antimalarial therapy. 
Third, the spread of resistance was due to multiple 
emergences of artemisinin resistance, each caused by an 
independent mutation in the kelch13 gene and confined 
to a reasonably small geographical area.7–9
In 2013, the situation worsened in that artemisinin 
combination therapy was completely failing to clear 
parasites in some patients in western Cambodia.10 At that 
time, the form of artemisinin combination therapy 
used 
in 
Cambodia 
as 
first-line 
treatment 
was 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and treatment failure 
was due to increasing resistance to piperaquine. 
Piperaquine resistance was shown to have a genetic 
basis, and copy number amplification of the plasmepsin 2 
and plasmepsin 3 genes was discovered to be a useful 
genetic marker.11,12 Since 2013, the frequency of 
complete treatment failure in patients receiving 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has increased rapidly in 
Cambodia, northeast Thailand, and Vietnam.13–17
This 
spread 
of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
treatment failure has been associated with a specific 
parasite lineage that is spreading across the region.15,17

artemisinin combination therapy, these reports have 
caused considerable alarm and debate about whether or 
not it constitutes a public health emergency.
We did an in-depth genetic analysis of the epidemiological 
origins and early history of this outbreak using genome 
sequence data on P falciparum samples collected in 
Cambodia from 2007 to 2013. Our genome sequence data 
were complemented by open-access sequence data on 
other samples from southeast Asia generated by the 
MalariaGEN Plasmodium falciparum Community Project.18
Methods
Genome sequence data
We analysed genome sequence data on 497 P falciparum 
samples collected in clinical studies6,11,14,19 of antimalarial 
drug efficacy in 2010–13 in three provinces of Cambodia 
where artemisinin and piperaquine resistance was 
expected to be common (Pursat, western Cambodia), 
emerging (Preah Vihear, northern Cambodia), or 
uncommon (Ratanakiri, northeastern Cambodia). Patients 
were enrolled as part of observational or drug efficacy 
studies from provincial referral hospitals and district 
health centres and had presented with uncomplicated 
P falciparum malaria. Details of the sampling protocol, 
together with enrolment and exclusion criteria, have been 
reported elsewhere.6,11,14,19 All patients provided written 
informed consent under protocols approved by Cambodia’s 
National Ethics Committee for Health Research and the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ 
institutional review board.
These data were combined with open-access genome 
sequence 
data 
generated 
by 
the 
MalariaGEN 
Plasmodium falciparum Community Project on samples 
from various locations in southeast Asia, as previously 
reported.18 Information about the contributing studies 
can be found on the project website. Altogether, this 
dataset yielded 464 P falciparum samples collected in 
western Cambodia in 2007–13 and 1028 from other 
locations and timepoints. For all of the samples 
analysed, sequence data were generated at the Wellcome 
Sanger Institute with Illumina short-read technology, 
and genotypes were called with a standardised analysis 
pipeline.20
To minimise the risk of confounding of the multilocus 
analyses and haplotype analyses by complex infections, 
we used only samples from south or southeast Asia with 
sufficient coverage (>75% of the single nucleotide 
polymorphism [SNP] covered by at least five reads) 
and with low complexity of infection (within-sample 
diversity >0·8).
Kelch13 genotyping and haplogroup assignment
To analyse mutations in the P falciparum kelch13 gene 
that are markers of artemisinin resistance (appendix),21 
we derived the genotype of kelch13 for each sample from 
read counts at non-synonymous SNPs in the propeller 
and BTB/POZ domains of the kelch13 protein, as 
described previously.7 We reconstructed the probable 
origin of kelch13 mutation using chromosome painting.22 
This method compares haplotypes in a sample to those 
in the remaining samples and estimates the probability 
that a genome fragment originates in each of them, 
while also accounting for recombination and de-novo 
mutations (appendix).
Research in context
Evidence before the study
We searched PubMed without language restrictions up to 
Oct 30, 2017, using the search terms “artemisinin”, “piperaquine”, 
“multidrug”, “resistance”, and “southeast Asia”. We identified 
32 publications about increasing dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine treatment failure and its genetic markers. In two 
studies, Imwong and colleagues examined 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment failure in Thailand, 
Laos, and Vietnam, and used microsatellite typing around the 
kelch13 gene to show that increasing treatment failure was due 
to the spread of a particular lineage of artemisinin-resistant 
parasites originating in western Cambodia.
Added value of this study
We did a genome sequence analysis of a large collection of 
Plasmodium falciparum samples from a longitudinal clinical study 
of antimalarial-drug resistance in western Cambodia. We found 
that 91% of parasites resistant to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
were of the KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage, suggesting that they arose 
from a common epidemiological origin, and that this co-lineage 
is probably the same lineage observed in other countries by 
Imwong and colleagues. These data show that the KEL1/PLA1 
co-lineage emerged in western Cambodia in the same year that 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine officially became the first-line 
antimalarial drug, and thereafter spread rapidly for 5 years before 
the first clinical reports of this major outbreak of multidrug 
resistance appeared.
Implications of all the available evidence
Treatment of P falciparum malaria resistant to 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine with alternative antimalarial 
drug combinations remains possible, but the current outbreak 
suggests that artemisinin-resistant parasites are gaining 
increased biological fitness, which might increase the risk of 
southeast-Asian parasites eventually becoming untreatable 
and spreading to Africa. Uncertainties can be mitigated by the 
use of appropriate genetic surveillance technologies to enable 
malaria control programmes working in the most vulnerable 
locations to respond as soon as possible to any substantial 
evolutionary changes in the parasite population. We propose 
that this strategy should be used as part of the regional malaria 
elimination policy in southeast Asia.

Copy number amplifications
We used two orthogonal methods to assess duplication 
genotypes 
around 
mdr1 
and 
plasmepsin 
2–3: 
a 
coverage-based method and a method based on position 
and orientation of reads near discovered duplication 
breakpoints. Details of the methods are described 
elsewhere.11 In short, a coverage-based hidden Markov 
model was used to identify potential copy number 
amplifications and their boundaries.23 Breakpoints of 
duplications around mdr1 and plasmepsin 2–3 were then 
identified by visual inspection of soft-clipped reads and 
paired reads aligned either in the same or the opposite 
orientation (face-away reads). We then searched all samples 
for face-away read pairs spanning the breakpoints, and 
combined results with those of the hidden Markov model. 
For the plasmepsin 2–3 locus, breakpoint positions and 
sequences used in the search are described in the appendix.
Spread of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine resistance
We estimated the level of co-ancestry between different 
locations using chromosome painting. The method was 
run with the same parameters specified for the kelch13 
haplogroup analysis, but across the whole genome. For 
each sample, we generated the most likely painting 
(ie, Viterbi decoding) and aggregated copying vectors 
according to geographical origin of the donor samples. We 
then estimated the fraction of the genome copied from 
each population. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed 
with the function nj in the R package ape, with default 
parameters and a genome-wide pairwise genetic distance 
matrix, as described elsewhere.18,24

Results
We analysed genome sequence data on 1492 samples 
collected at 11 locations across southeast Asia, including 
464 samples collected between 2007 and 2013 in Cambodia 
(table). This collection allowed a detailed longitudinal 
genetic analysis of the P falciparum population of western 
Cambodia in the period leading up to the first clinical 
reports of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine resistance 
in 2013.
689 (46%) of 1492 samples carried kelch13 mutations, 
including 136 (9%) samples that were heterozygous 
because of mixed infection (appendix). We observed 
24 distinct kelch13 mutations, each denoted by their effect 
on the aminoacid sequence (figure 1; appendix). In the 
553 homozygous samples with kelch13 mutations, the 
most frequent alleles were 580Tyr (n=317), 493 His 
(n=56), 539Thr (n=43), 543Thr (n=24), 441Leu (n=16), 
561His (n=15), and 675Val (n=15).
Kelch13 mutations were observed throughout the entire 
geographical region, with the exception of Bangladesh, 
and increased in frequency over time (figure 1). Western 
Cambodia had an extremely high prevalence of 
kelch13 mutations (384 [83%] of 464 samples, including 
61 [13%] heterozygous samples), and their frequency 
increased from 40% (ten of 25) in 2007 to 84% (32 of 38) in 
2013. Of 323 samples from western Cambodia with 
homozygous kelch13 mutations, 241 (75%) were carrying 
the 580Tyr allele (appendix).
The observation of 24 different kelch13 mutations 
suggested that at least 24 epidemiological origins of 
artemisinin resistance existed in the sampled locations. 
However, 
some 
kelch13 
mutations 
have 
multiple 
independent origins, so that two samples with the same 
mutation might not be epidemiologically related (ie, their 
alleles are identical by state, but they might not be identical 
by descent).7,8 To address this question, we analysed the 
haplotype structure of kelch13 and its flanking regions in all 
553 samples with homozygous mutations and used 
statistical chromosome painting to estimate the level of 
shared ancestry between samples.22 This approach allowed 
assignment of each sample to a kelch13 haplogroup, defined 
here as a group of samples with the same kelch13 mutation 
and strong haplotypic similarities indicative of recent 
shared lineage at the kelch13 locus (appendix). This 
approach identified 38 kelch13 haplo 
groups, each of which 
was presumed to represent a distinct lineage of artemisinin 
resistance (appendix). The 580Tyr allele was found in six 
different kelch13 haplogroups, of which the most common 
was the KEL1 lineage (appendix).
The KEL1 lineage accounted for 266 (48%) of 
553 artemisinin-resistant samples in this dataset. The 
lineage was predominantly found in western Cambodia, 
but was also observed in other parts of Cambodia, as well as 
in Vietnam and Laos, where its genetic background 
appeared to be different (figure 1; appendix). In western 
Cambodia, the KEL1 lineage was at 4% (one of 25) frequency 
in 2007, which increased to 63% (24 of 38) in 2013. The 
lineage appears to have spread through the parasite 
population by recombination—ie, it is found in parasites

that are considerably different at the whole-genome level, as 
can be visualised with a genome-wide neighbour 
-joining 
tree (appendix).
Amplifications of plasmepsin 2–3, which are markers 
of piperaquine resistance, were observed in 185 (41%) of 
456 samples from western Cambodia and in 14 (1%) 
of 1009 samples from elsewhere (calls were inconclusive 
for 27 samples; figure 2; appendix). Two genetic features 
of the plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications indicated that they 
mostly had the same epidemiological origin. First, the 
breakpoint sequences of the amplification (ie, the 
sequences around the point where the additional copy 
of the gene is inserted) were identical in all but 
six samples (appendix). Second, most samples carrying 
the amplification had highly similar haplotypes 
surrounding the amplified genes, which were different 
from those without the amplification (appendix). Based 
on haplotype analysis, 186 (93%) of 199 samples with the 
amplification had strong evidence of recent shared 
ancestry (fewer than five differences out of 1454 SNPs 
with minor allele frequency of >1%), and 11 (6%) samples 
could plausibly have arisen from the same recent 
ancestor after allowing for recombination or mixed 
infections. We refer to this lineage as PLA1. The 
remaining two samples with the amplification were from 
northwest Thailand and had a substantially different 
haplotype.
Amplifications of plasmepsin 2–3 were already circulating 
at low frequency in 2002–03.12 However, in this dataset, 
plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications were absent in 2007 but then 
rapidly increased to 79% (30/38) frequency in western 
Cambodia by 2013. This finding differs from the Thailand–
Myanmar border, where only two amplifications were 
observed in 2008 and none after that timepoint. In 
northern Cambodia, plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications were 
first observed in 11 samples collected in 2012 and 2013.
The combination of kelch13 mutation and plasmepsin 
2–3 amplification is a marker of dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine treatment failure.11 By analysing this 
combination of markers, we identified 154 samples

resistant to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, after exc- 
lusion of samples with heterozygous genotypes, which 
were unsuitable for this analysis. We found that 145 (94%) 
samples resistant to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
carried the kelch13 580Tyr allele and 140 (91%) belonged 
to the KEL1 lineage. Six (4%) resistant samples carried 
the 493His allele and belonged to the KEL2 lineage 
(appendix). We identified 15 samples from western 
Cambodia and two from Thailand that carried plasmepsin 
2–3 amplifications, but without kelch13 mutation.
These data indicate that resistance to dihydro- 
artemisinin–piperaquine 
was 
present 
in 
western 
Cambodia as early as 2008 and then rapidly increased in 
frequency, from 16% (five of 31) in 2008 to 
68% (25 of 37) in 2013 (figure 3). From the time of its 
emergence, resistance to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
was associated with the KEL1 lineage, which was observed 
in eight (80%) of ten resistant samples obtained from 
western Cambodia in 2008 and in 55 (93%) of 59 resistant 
samples obtained from western Cambodia in 2012–13. In 
the same period, the frequency of KEL1 samples carrying 
plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications (all of the PLA1 lineage) 
increased in western Cambodia, from 31% (four of 13) in 
2008 to 92% (22 of 24) in 2013.
The acquisition of plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications by 
parasites of the KEL2 lineage (carrying the kelch13 493His 
resistance allele) appears to be more recent, and these 
parasites account for six (6%) of the 105 samples 
resistant to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in western 
Cambodia between 2011 and 2013 (appendix). Genomic 
evidence suggests that these amplifications are of the 
PLA1 lineage (appendix); thus, this acquisition probably 
occurred through introgression via recombination, 
possibly with parasites belonging to the KEL1 lineage.
Based on these genetic data, resistance to dihydro- 
artemisinin–piperaquine appears to have been confined 
to western Cambodia until 2011, but in 2012–13 it was 
observed in 11 samples from northern Cambodia and in 
one sample from Laos close to the northern Cambodian 
border. Analysis of the kelch13 and plasmepsin 2–3 loci in 
these northern Cambodian samples showed that they 
resembled most of the resistant samples from western

Cambodia, suggesting they all belonged to the KEL1/PLA1 
co-lineage. This finding suggests that resistance to 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has spread from western 
to northern Cambodia.
To examine this question in more detail, we did 
chromosome painting across the whole genome and 
estimated co-ancestry between samples from different 
geographical locations. We found that, in northern 
Cambodia, samples with markers of dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine resistance had much higher levels of western 
Cambodian co-ancestry than the rest of the population 
(figure 4A). Construction of a neighbour-joining tree with 
whole-genome data showed that samples from northern 
Cambodia 
with 
markers 
of 
dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine resistance grouped closely with parasites 
from western Cambodia, rather than with other parasites 
from northern Cambodia (figure 4B). Taken together, these 
findings indicate that emergence of dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine resistance in northern Cambodia in 2012 was 
the result of migration of parasites from western 
Cambodia.
Artesunate–mefloquine was the first-line artemisinin 
combination therapy in Cambodia before the initial use 
of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in 2008, and has 
continued to be widely used in other parts of southeast 
Asia.25 Increasing piperaquine resistance in western 
Cambodia was accompanied by a reduction in mefloquine 
resistance.14 We explored this association by analysing 
mdr1 amplifications that are known markers of 
mefloquine resistance.26 Between 2007 and 2013, the 
frequency of mdr1 amplifications in western Cambodia 
decreased from 59% (ten of 17) to 6% (two of 36), by 
contrast with Myanmar and Thailand, where the 
frequency increased from 13% (one of eight) in 2007 to 
63% (19 of 30) in 2013. This decline in mdr1 amplifications 
in western Cambodia was directly associated with the 
evolution and expansion of parasites belonging to the 
KEL1 haplogroup (figure 3). As the KEL1 lineage increased 
in frequency, it progressively lost mdr1 amplifications and 
gained plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications. By 2013, when the 
KEL1 lineage had reached a frequency of 65% (24/37) in 
western Cambodia, 92% (22/24) of the KEL1 samples had 
plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications, whereas none had 
mdr1 amplifications.
Discussion
Whether the rapid spread of resistance to dihydro- 
artemisinin–piperaquine in southeast Asia will derail 
malaria control worldwide is highly debated.15,17,27,28 WHO 
has determined that it is not a public health emergency, 
but this view is challenged by some malaria experts.27,28 
The findings of this study shed light on four questions 
pertinent to the ongoing debate: what is the nature of the 
parasites that are causing the problem? How rapidly have 
they spread? How are they likely to respond to alternative 
drug combinations? What are the major risks and 
uncertainties in the long term?
First, in terms of population genetics, what are the 
essential features of the resistant parasites? We found 
that 91% of the samples carried a kelch13 580Tyr allele of 
the KEL1 lineage and 4% carried a kelch13 493His allele of 
the KEL2 lineage. Thus, most but not all of the parasites 
resistant to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine acquired 
artemisinin resistance from a single epidemiological 
origin, despite identification of 38 putative independent 
origins of artemisinin resistance in our study.
At the plasmepsin 2–3 locus, we identified only 
two epidemiological origins of gene amplifications 
associated with piperaquine resistance. One of these was 
reasonably rare, being found in only two parasites 
from Thailand. All of the parasites resistant to 
dihydro- 
artemisinin–piperaquine belonged to a single 
plasmepsin 2–3 lineage that we refer to as PLA1.

The genetic features of the KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage are 
concordant with reports of parasites resistant to 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in Thailand, Laos, and 
Vietnam.15,17 Imwong and colleagues15,17 refer to these 
parasites as the PfPailin lineage, suggesting that this 
lineage of P falciparum is uniform, analogous to a viral or 
bacterial strain. However, malaria parasites, unlike 
viruses and bacteria, undergo sexual recombination with 
each transmission cycle and, therefore, this nomenclature 
is potentially misleading. Our data show that the KEL1 
lineage of artemisinin resistance is carried by parasites of 
diverse genetic backgrounds and, although parasites of 
the KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage have high levels of shared 
ancestry relative to the general parasite population, they 
are not genetically homogeneous. Additionally, the KEL1 
and PLA1 lineages are separate and possibly emerged 
independently. This concept is central to understanding 
how multidrug-resistant parasites might evolve in the 
future—ie, through recombination with other parasites 
and incorporation of new genetic features.
Second, when did this group of parasites emerge and 
how rapidly have they spread? Our data show that parasites 
in the KEL1 lineage were present at low frequencies in 
western Cambodia as early as 2007
. At that time, they 
carried mdr1 amplifications that confer resistance to 
mefloquine and did not carry plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications. 
The KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage was first observed in 2008, the 
same year that dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was 
introduced as the first-line antimalarial drug in western 
Cambodia. Nevertheless, piperaquine has been extensively 
used in western Cambodia, as a monotherapy in the 1990s 
and then in combination with artemisinin in the late 2000s. 
In neighbouring provinces, plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications 
were circulating at low frequencies in 2002–03, but had 
increased in frequency by 2008.12 Thus, although we did not 
find plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications in this dataset in 2007, it 
is possible that PLA1 existed before at a low frequency, 
independently of KEL1. Over the time period and in the 
locations surveyed here, PLA1 was mainly linked to KEL1, 
but it was also seen in parasites with the KEL2 haplogroup 
and in those without kelch13 mutations.
Before 
the 
emergence 
of 
dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine resistance, the frequency of artemisinin-
resistant parasites in western Cambodia was already high, 
but they comprised a diverse set of kelch13 mutations 
arising from multiple epidemiological origins, each of 
which tended to remain fairly localised. After the 
KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage emerged in 2008, it spread rapidly 
and extensively across western Cambodia, reaching a 
frequency of more than 60% in the parasite population. 
Our data show that the KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage appeared in 
northern Cambodia in 2012, probably due to the spread of 
parasites from western Cambodia. Although the genetic 
typing methods used by Imwong and colleagues15,17 to 
characterise kelch13 haplotypes and plasmepsin 2–3 
amplifications were different from those used in this 
study, it seems likely from their data that the parasites

resistant to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine that appeared 
in northeastern Thailand and Laos in 2014–15, and in 
Vietnam in 2016, correspond to the KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage.
Third, what short-term predictions can be made about 
the likely response of the resistant parasites to alternative 
drug combinations? The KEL1 lineage was initially 
associated with mdr1 amplifications that are markers of 
mefloquine resistance, but this association has lessened 
over time, and the most recent KEL1/PLA1 samples in 
this dataset do not carry mdr1 amplifications. Therefore, 
at present, parasites resistant to dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine are sensitive to mefloquine, and artesunate–
mefloquine is now being used successfully as first-line 
antimalarial treatment in Cambodia. Evidence also 
suggests that parasites resistant to dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine are responsive to artesunate–pyronaridine, 
a new artemisinin combination therapy.27
It is reasonable to expect that the switch to artesunate–
mefloquine in Cambodia will cause piperaquine 
resistance to decline, but this switch might also cause 
mefloquine resistance to rise, particularly because 
KEL1 parasites evidently have no problem in switching 
between 
mefloquine 
and 
piperaquine 
resistance. 
Evidence suggests that a negative interaction exists 
between mdr1 and plasmepsin 2–3 amplifications; they 
rarely co-occur in samples from Cambodia.11,12 Further 
studies are needed to assess whether this negative 
association is the result of a natural antagonism, in 
which the use of piperaquine decreases mefloquine 
resistance and vice versa. If that is the case, the 
effectiveness of artemisinin combination therapy in 
southeast Asia could be maintained by use of mefloquine 
and piperaquine in combination or in rotation. However, 
any strategy will need to be closely monitored because it 
has the potential to cause emergence of joint resistance 
to both drugs.
Finally, what are the long-term risks and how might the 
level of uncertainty be reduced? The main risks are that 
P falciparum malaria will eventually become untreatable 
in southeast Asia, and that this resistance will spread to 
Africa. Many parallels exist between drug resistance 
outbreaks and cancer. In cancer diagnosis, the term 
aggressive means a tumour that is rapidly spreading, as 
opposed to one that remains localised. By this definition, 
the KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage can be described as an 
aggressively spreading form of drug resistance.
The rapid spread of KEL1/PLA1 suggests that 
artemisinin-resistant parasites are acquiring increased 
biological fitness, and to what extent this increased 
biological fitness increases the risk of partner-drug 
failure and transcontinental spread is unknown. On one 
hand, the risk might be fairly low; the success of the 
KEL1 lineage might have been simply due to its 
association with PLA1 at a time when dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine was the first-line antimalarial. In this case, 
spread of resistance could potentially be contained 
through strategic management of dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine use. On the other hand, the aggressive 
spread of KEL1 might have been due to factors that are 
independent of its association with PLA1. KEL1 carries 
the 580Tyr allele, which has more independent origins 
than any other artemisinin resistance allele. The 
frequency of the 580Tyr allele is much higher than the 
frequency of other artemisinin resistance alleles, not 
only 
in 
western 
Cambodia 
but 
also 
on 
the 
Thailand–Myanmar border.29 Given that the allele has 
emerged independently in these two locations, it might 
have superior fitness that is independent of its genetic 
background. It is also possible that the KEL1 lineage is 
progressively undergoing evolutionary adaptation by 
becoming linked to compensatory or synergistic 
mutations in other genes that act to increase its 
transmissibility and biological fitness.
Malaria policy makers now face a dilemma. On one 
hand, malaria remains treatable, and its prevalence has 
been sufficiently reduced in Cambodia and neighbouring 
countries that regional malaria elimination seems 
feasible. On the other hand, the situation is extremely 
fragile, and there is considerable uncertainty about how 
the parasite population will evolve in response to the next 
round of interventions. Our data show that the KEL1/PLA1 
co-lineage emerged in 2008, the same year that 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine officially became the 
first-line antimalarial in western Cambodia, and then 
spread rapidly for 5 years before the first clinical reports 
emerged. It would be catastrophic if the same were to 
happen for the last remaining antimalarials that are 
effective in southeast Asia. However, unlike the situation 
in 2008, provision of national malaria control programmes, 
with tools for high-resolution genetic surveillance of all 
observed malaria cases in the most vulnerable locations, is 
now technically feasible. We propose that this strategy 
should be used as part of the regional malaria elimination 
policy because it would enable malaria control 
programmes to respond as soon as possible to evolutionary 
changes in the parasite population, and thereby reduce 
uncertainty and risk. We also suggest that these data 
should be made openly available, so that all countries in 
the region and the international malaria community can 
cooperate to find a solution if a particular intervention 
strategy starts to fail. With use of appropriate technologies 
and concerted action, major outbreaks of resistance 
should not go unnoticed in the future and the risk of a 
global health emergency should be reduced.
