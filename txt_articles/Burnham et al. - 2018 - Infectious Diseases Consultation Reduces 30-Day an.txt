Background. Multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections are associated with high mortality and readmission rates. 
Infectious diseases (ID) consultation improves clinical outcomes for drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections. 
Our goal was to determine the association between ID consultation and mortality following various MDRO infections.
Methods. This study was conducted with a retrospective cohort (January 1, 2006–October 1, 2015) at an academic tertiary re-
ferral center. We identified patients with MDROs in a sterile site or bronchoalveolar lavage/bronchial wash culture. Mortality and 
readmissions within 1 year of index culture were identified, and the association of ID consultation with these outcomes was deter-
mined using Cox proportional hazards models with inverse weighting by the propensity score for ID consultation.
Results. A total of 4214 patients with MDRO infections were identified. ID consultation was significantly associated with reduc-
tions in 30-day and 1-year mortality for resistant S. aureus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36–0.63; and HR, 
0.73, 95% CI, 0.61–0.86) and Enterobacteriaceae (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27–0.64; and HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59–0.94), and 30-day mor-
tality for polymicrobial infections (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31–0.86) but not Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas. For resistant Enterococcus, 
ID consultation was marginally associated with decreased 30-day mortality (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62–1.06). ID consultation was 
associated with reduced 30-day readmission for resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
Conclusions. ID consultation was associated with significant reductions in 30-day and 1-year mortality for resistant S. aureus 
and Enterobacteriaceae, and 30-day mortality for polymicrobial infections. There was no association between ID consultation and 
mortality for patients with resistant Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, or Enterococcus, possibly due to small sample sizes. Our results 
suggest that ID consultation may be beneficial for patients with some MDRO infections.
Keywords. infectious diseases consultation; multidrug-resistant organisms. 
Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are an urgent public 
health threat, with increasing global incidence, progressively 
fewer treatment options, an association with significant health 
care costs, and high rates of morbidity, mortality, and readmis-
sions [1–7]. With such a significant burden of disease due to 
MDROs, strategies are needed to reduce the morbidity, mortal-
ity, and societal cost of MDRO infections. One potential inter-
vention to improve outcomes in patients with MDRO infections 
is infectious diseases (ID) consultation.
Previous research has shown that ID consultation is associ-
ated with up to 67% reductions in mortality, decreased rates 
of infection relapse, increased adherence to national treat-
ment guidelines, reduced rates of readmission, and up to 58% 
lower rates of treatment failure in patients with various infec-
tions [8–15]. However, there is limited research regarding the 
association of ID consultation with clinical outcomes among 
patients with MDRO infections. Currently available research 
on ID consultation and MDROs centers on methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, for which ID consultation is 
associated with improved patient outcomes [8, 12–14].
We studied hospitalized patients with MDRO infections, 
confirmed by positive bloodstream, bronchoalveolar lavage 
(BAL)/bronchial wash, or other sterile site cultures to deter-
mine whether ID consultation was associated with reductions 
in mortality and readmissions for various MDRO pathogens. 
Understanding the association of ID consultation with clinical 
outcomes will help guide the decisions of physicians caring for 
patients with MDRO infections.

spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or 
Acinetobacter spp. were analyzed for eligibility. Antimicrobial 
susceptibilities for all pathogens were determined using disc dif-
fusion methodology. Sterile sites were defined as bloodstream; 
pleural, intra-abdominal, pericardial, cerebrospinal, and syno-
vial fluids; bone marrow; and surgical specimens collected from 
lymph nodes, central nervous system (CNS), liver, spleen, kid-
ney, pancreas, ovary, or vascular tissue. Patients were excluded 
if they died or were discharged 48 hours after the first positive 
culture was collected, as these patients’ outcomes were unlikely 
to be affected by ID consultation. This study was approved by 
the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional 
Review Board with a waiver of informed consent.
Study Design and Data Collection
Utilizing a retrospective cohort study design, the first hospital-
ization between January 2006 and October 2015 of all patients 
age ≥18 years with MDR Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp., 
S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or Acinetobacter spp. isolated from the 
bloodstream, other sterile sites, or BAL/bronchial wash cul-
ture was identified. The primary end points were death and 
readmission after MDRO infection. Baseline characteristics, 
including age, gender, race, Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation (APACHE) II [22] scores (calculated based 
on clinical data from the 24 hours before and after positive 
cultures were obtained), and medical comorbidities (based on 
ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes), were obtained. Patients who died 
during the index hospitalization or were discharged on hospice 
were considered to be expired at the time of hospital discharge 
and excluded from the readmission analyses.
Definitions and Data Sources
Time to death was calculated from the day that a culture posi-
tive for an MDRO was obtained. All data were obtained from 
the BJC Healthcare Informatics database, maintained by the 
Center for Clinical Excellence, BJC Healthcare. BJH is the 
largest adult teaching institution for BJC Healthcare, a large 
integrated health care system of both inpatient and outpatient 
care. The system includes 13 hospitals in a geographic re-
gion surrounding and including St. Louis, Missouri. BJH has 
>50 000 admissions annually, and the BJC system >140 000. 
All index hospitalizations used to define the cohort occurred 
at BJH. Readmissions to BJH or any other BJC acute care fa-
cility were captured. Expiration dates from stays in any BJC 
facility are included in the Informatics database. For patients 
with less than 1 year of follow-up after index hospitalization, the 
Social Security Death Index (SSDI) was used to identify patient 
deaths. Patients without follow-up in the BJC system and not in 
the SSDI were considered lost to follow-up on their last date of 
care in a BJC facility.
Defining MDROs
We utilized multiple definitions of drug resistance as outlined 
by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
and European CDC (Supplementary Table 1) [16–18]. Any 
Enterobacteriaceae was presumed to be an extended-spectrum 
beta lactamase (ESBL) producer if ceftriaxone or ceftazidime 
was intermediate or resistant. Patients were considered to have 
a vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) infection if S. aur-
eus isolated in culture was determined to have a vancomycin 
minimum inhibitory concentration of 4 or 8 µg/mL, in accord-
ance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recom-
mendations [19].
Statistical Analysis
Mortality and readmissions by index hospitalization pathogen 
group were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariate 
analysis was performed by chi-square or the Fisher exact test 
where appropriate for categorical values. The Student t test or 
Mann-Whitney U test was used where appropriate for con-
tinuous variables. Continuous variables were reported as means 
with standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges 
(IQRs). Categorical data were expressed as frequencies. For 
univariate analysis of variables associated with mortality or re-
admission, Kaplan-Meier analysis with comparison by the log-
rank test was used for categorical values, and univariate Cox 
regression for continuous variables.
Descriptive statistics were performed using the chi-square 
and Mann-Whitney U tests. To create the propensity score 
for ID consultation, we used multivariable logistic regression, 
with ID consult as the dependent variable and a wide range 
of independent variables (Supplementary Table 2). The inde-
pendent variables chosen for inclusion in the propensity score 
model included all variables with P < .20 in univariate analysis 
or clinical/biological plausibility for association with mortality 
or ID consultation. Balance diagnostics using standardized dif-
ferences were used to assess the performance of the propensity 
score model, with an SD >0.10 considered evidence of imbal-
ance [20]. Standard differences of the factors in the propensity 
score are shown in Supplementary Table 4.
For analysis of 30-day and 1-year mortality and 30-day 
readmissions, Cox proportional hazards models with back-
ward selection were performed with inverse weighting by the 
propensity score. Before model development, the top 5% and 
bottom 5% of the population based on the propensity score 
were trimmed from the population [21]. To determine the 
impact of ID consultation on mortality and readmission de-
pending on pathogen type, interaction terms were created. All 
variables included in the final Cox proportional hazards model 
are reported. A P value of <.05 was considered significant in all 
analyses. All analyses were done using SAS v9.4.
RESULTS
A total of 4429 patients with MDROs from sterile sites or BAL/
bronchial wash cultures were identified, 202 of which were 
excluded due to death or discharge in the 48 hours after positive

culture. An additional 13 patients who had left-ventricular 
assist devices were excluded, as all but 1 had an ID consult. 
Of the remaining 4214 patients, 840 (19.9%) died or were dis-
charged on hospice within 30 days of the first positive culture, 
and 1832 (43.5%) died within 1 year. Among survivors of the 
index MDRO hospitalization, 1076 (31.9%) were readmitted 
within 30 days and 2049 (60.7%) were readmitted within 1 year. 
Table 1 shows 30-day and 1-year mortality and readmission 
rates by pathogen group and ID consultation status. Among 
patients without an ID consult, 578 (24.4%) died within 30 days 
of positive culture and 1115 (47.0%) within 1 year. For patients 
who had ID consults, 262 (14.2%) died within 30 days and 717 
(38.9%) within 1 year.
In univariate analyses for each drug-resistant pathogen group, 
nonsurvivors tended to be older, have more comorbidities, 
and higher APACHE-II scores than survivors (Supplementary 
Table 3).
Mortality
After adjustment using a multivariate Cox proportional 
 
hazards model with inverse weighting by the propensity score, 
ID  
consultation was significantly associated with reduced all-
cause mortality for several pathogen groups at different time 
points. The median time from positive MDRO culture to ID 
consultation was 2.1 days, with an interquartile range of 0.4 to 
4.5. The time to ID consultation was not significantly  
different 
between survivors and nonsurvivors (2.08 vs 2.43 days, respec-
tively; P = .12). At 30 days after positive culture, ID  
consultation 
was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality 
for drug- 
resistant S. aureus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; 95% 
 
confidence interval [CI], 0.36–0.63; P < .0001), drug-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27–0.64; P < .0001), and 
polymicrobial MDRO infections (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31–0.86; 
P = .011) (Table 2). At 30 days, ID consultation was associated 
with marginally reduced risk of mortality for drug-resistant 
Enterococcus (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62–1.06; P = .12).
At 1 year, ID consultation remained associated with 
reduced risk of all-cause mortality for drug-resistant S. aureus 
(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.86; P < .001) and drug-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59–0.94; P < .012). 
ID consultation was not associated with reduced mortality for 
patients with drug-resistant Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter at 
30 days or 1 year.
Other risk factors for 30-day mortality in the multivariate 
Cox proportional hazards model with inverse weighting by the 
propensity score included patient and infection characteristics, 
as well as admitting service (Table 2). Patients with positive 
blood cultures and those in an ICU at the time a positive cul-
ture was drawn had increased hazard ratios for 30-day mortality 
(Table 2). In addition, bone marrow transplant, cardiovascular 
disease, cirrhosis, leukemia, lymphoma, metastatic cancer, 
human immunodeficiency virus, and presence of an automated 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator were all associated with 
increased risk of 30-day mortality (Table 2).
Readmissions
In propensity score–weighted multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards models, ID consultation was associated with decreased 
risk of 30-day readmission for drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
infections (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.97; P = .028) only. ID con-
sultation was not associated with decreased risk of 30-day or 
1-year readmissions for other pathogens. In patients receiving

ID consultation, there was an increased risk of 30-day readmis-
sion for patients with drug-resistant S. aureus infections (HR, 
1.27; 95% CI, 1.03–1.57; P = .023).
DISCUSSION
We found that ID consultation was associated with reductions in 
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality for several MDRO pathogens. 
Previous studies have shown a mortality benefit to ID consultation 
for patients with bloodstream infections due to drug-resistant S. aur-
eus [8, 12]. In addition, ID consultation has been shown to result 
in reductions in mortality and  improvements in a variety of other 
quality-of-care metrics [9–11]. For the other MDROs characterized 
in the present study, we are unaware of any literature that exam-
ines an association between ID consultation and mortality. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study to report an association between 
ID consultation and reductions in mortality for drug-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae and polymicrobial MDRO infections.
We did not find an association with ID consultation and 
reduced mortality for drug-resistant Acinetobacter and 
Pseudomonas. However, these were the 2 smallest groups in our 
study, and we were underpowered to detect a mortality differ-
ence. ID consultation has been associated with higher rates of 
appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy in other studies [8], 
and delays in appropriate therapy are known determinants of 
mortality in patients with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter infec-
tions [22–26]. Therefore, it is possible that ID consultation would 
reduce mortality for infections with these organisms if studied in 
larger cohorts. Future studies should address this question.
For patients with drug-resistant Enterococcus infections, ID 
consultation was marginally associated with a reduction in 
30-day mortality. It is possible that with a larger sample size, 
this finding would reach statistical significance.
ID consultation was associated with a significant  
reduction 
in 30-day readmission rates for patients with drug-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae, a novel finding. Increasing the use of ID 
 
consultation for drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections 
could potentially help hospitals reduce financial penalties for 
 
readmissions. On the other hand, ID consultation was  
associated 
with increased risk of 30-day readmission in patients with drug- 
resistant S. aureus infections. This may be due to high rates of 
vancomycin use for S. aureus at our institution [27] and associated 
adverse drug events, although we do not have treatment data for 
this cohort to confirm this possibility. Even with this increased 
readmission rate, ID consultation was associated with a  
significant 
reduction in mortality after drug-resistant S. aureus infection, 
pointing to an overall benefit. The lack of an association between 
ID consultation and readmissions for the other pathogen groups 
could be due to small sample size or underlying medical comorbid-
ities associated with high morbidity and mortality such as diabetes, 
heart failure, leukemia, and solid organ malignancies.
Our study has several limitations. The retrospective nature 
of the study makes it difficult to elucidate possible confounders 
that could have biased the outcome measures. It is possible that 
due to the retrospective study design, we were unable to account 
for unrecognized confounding variables that linked ID consult-
ation and mortality. Without drug administration data, we are 
unable to determine if the higher rate of appropriate therapy in 
the ID consultation group was the reason for reduced mortality. 
This was a single-center study, and results may not be gener-
alizable to other centers. Even in a large center, numbers were 
small for some pathogen groups. However, the strength of the 
association between ID consultation and mortality in the largest 
pathogen groups is robust and likely applicable to other tertiary 
care referral centers with similar patient case mixes.
We are also limited by a lack of data on non-MDRO path-
ogens with which to compare benefit of ID consultation, but 
previous work has shown that patients acquiring MDRO 
infections are fundamentally different than patients with non-
MDRO infections [28, 29]. Therefore, we felt it was more useful 
to compare patients with different types of MDROs rather than

comparing patients with non-MDRO infections with those with 
MDRO infections of the same type of organism.
Another limitation of our study is loss to follow-up. It is pos-
sible that some patients went to a facility outside of the BJC 
Healthcare network and that we were unable to capture their 
mortality and readmission status. However, we cross-checked 
all patients in the Social Security Death Index if they did not 
have follow-up within the BJC Healthcare network within 
1 year in an attempt to reduce the number of uncaptured deaths.
In conclusion, ID consultation is significantly associated with 
reductions in all-cause mortality for drug-resistant S. aureus, 
Enterobacteriaceae, and polymicrobial MDRO infections as well 
as reductions in 30-day readmissions after Enterobacteriaceae in-
fection. Comorbidities and severity of acute and chronic illnesses 
also were risk factors for mortality and readmissions. By analyz-
ing outcomes after ID consultation, we hope to encourage ID in-
volvement and collaboration with teams caring for patients with 
MDRO infections to improve patient outcomes. Our research 
further emphasizes the crucial role of ID physicians in the face of 
ever-increasing antimicrobial resistance.
