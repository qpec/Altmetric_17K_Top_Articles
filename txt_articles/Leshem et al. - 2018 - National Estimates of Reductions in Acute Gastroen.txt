We compared acute gastroenteritis (AGE)-related hospital-
ization rates among children <5 years of age during the pre–
rotavirus vaccine (2000–2006) and post–rotavirus vaccine 
(2008–2013) periods to estimate national reductions in AGE-
related hospitalizations and associated costs. We estimate that 
between 2008 and 2013, AGE-related hospitalizations declined 
by 382 000, and $1.228 billion in medical costs were averted.

Before the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in the United 
States, rotavirus gastroenteritis resulted in an estimated 20 
to 60 deaths, 55 000 to 70 000 hospitalizations, 200 000 emer-
gency department visits, and nearly 500 000 outpatient visits 
among children aged <5 years annually [1]. In February 2006, 
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommended the routine use of pentavalent rotavirus vac-
cine (RotaTeq, Merck and Co., Whitehouse Station, NJ) for 
US infants [1]. In June 2008, the ACIP updated its recommen-
dations to include the use of monovalent rotavirus vaccine 
(Rotarix, GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) [2].
Since the introduction of rotavirus vaccines, rates of hospital-
ization in US children for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and rotavi-
rus have decreased substantially [3–5]. We previously described 
reductions in diarrhea- and rotavirus-associated hospitalization 
rates in US children after rotavirus vaccine introduction [4]. We 
now extended this analysis to include an additional year of data 
and we estimate the national reductions in the absolute number 
of all-cause AGE in US children <5 years of age as well as reduc-
tions in health care costs after rotavirus vaccine introduction.
METHODS
We analyzed data from the State Inpatient Databases of the 
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), produced by 
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The 
State Inpatient Databases component of the HCUP captures 
data on all hospitalizations that occur in community and aca-
demic hospitals in the participating states [6]. This study was 
conducted through an active collaboration between the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention and the AHRQ. The study 
did not require review by an institutional review board, because 
deidentified aggregated data were used.
All discharges from short-stay AGE-related hospitaliza-
tions were identified by using the International Classification 
of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) 
codes for diarrhea of determined etiology (bacterial [001–005, 
excluding 003.2 and 008.0–008.5], parasitic [006–007, exclud-
ing 006.3–006.6], and viral [008.6 and 008.8]) and diarrhea of 
undetermined etiology (presumed infectious [009.0–009.3] 
and presumed noninfectious [558.9 and 787.91]) [3, 4]. 
Rotavirus-coded hospitalizations were identified by using the 
rotavirus-specific ICD-9-CM code 008.61. We restricted the 
rate-reduction analyses to data from 26 states that consistently 
provided hospitalization data to the HCUP each year during the 
study period from 2000 to 2013. These states include Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, 
Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, 
Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, 
Wisconsin, and West Virginia. Approximately 74% of US 
children aged <5 years resided in 1 of these 26 states [7]. 
Hospitalization rates were calculated by dividing the annual 
number of hospitalizations by the number of children <5 years 
of age who resided in the 26 participating states during that

year using the National Center for Health Statistics bridged-
race population estimates for 2000 through 2013 as the denom-
inator [7].
To compare the relative difference in hospitalization rates for 
AGE and rotavirus before and after rotavirus vaccine licensure, 
we compared the mean hospitalization rate for calendar years 
2000 to 2006 with that for calendar years 2008 to 2013, respec-
tively. Data from 2007 were excluded, because rotavirus vaccine 
coverage rates were low and uneven in the first year after vac-
cine introduction. Statistical comparisons of rates, rate reduc-
tions, and 95% confidence intervals for rate reductions were 
calculated using Poisson regression analysis. To obtain nation-
ally representative estimates of the annual number and cost of 
AGE-related hospitalizations, we applied the annual rates to the 
entire US population of children <5 years of age according to 
US census data [7].
To calculate the annual reductions, we subtracted the annual 
number and costs of hospitalizations in each postvaccine year 
from the mean prevaccine (2000–2006) data. The median cost 
of a hospitalization for AGE was obtained after converting hos-
pital charges to costs by using the cost-to-charge ratio file for 
the 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database [8]. The total 
costs of prevented hospitalizations were calculated by multiply-
ing the estimated number of AGE-related hospitalizations pre-
vented by the median cost of such hospitalizations.
RESULTS
We examined 1 253 951 AGE-related hospitalizations among 
children <5 years of age during 2000 to 2013, 203 616 (16%) 
of which were coded as a rotavirus-related hospitalization. 
The mean annual prevaccine AGE-related hospitalization rate 
among children <5 years of age was 76 per 10 000 (annual range, 
73 per 10 000 to 83 per 10 000). AGE-related hospitalization 
rates in the prevaccine years were stable, and no secular trends 
during the years 2000 to 2006 were found (Figure 1). AGE-
related hospitalization rates in the postvaccine years were 
reduced by 31% to 55%, and greater reductions were docu-
mented in later years (Table 1). Furthermore, a biennial pattern 
emerged in the postvaccine years; lower and delayed rotavirus 
seasonal peaks in 2008, 2010, and 2012 were found, and we 
observed slightly higher and earlier peaks in 2009, 2011, and 
2013 (Figure 1). In 2013, the AGE-related hospitalization rate 
was slightly higher than that in 2012, which represents a high 
year in the biennial pattern.
We estimate that the annual number of AGE-related hospi-
talizations among children <5 years of age in the United States 
declined from an average of 148 912 during the prevaccine years 
to a nadir of 68 633 in 2012 (Table 1). An estimated 382 858 hos-
pitalizations were averted from 2008 to 2013 (average annual 
number of hospitalizations averted, 63 810).
The median cost for an AGE-related hospitalization was 
$3210. Before vaccine introduction, the average annual cost 
for AGE-related hospitalizations in the United States was $478 
million. The annual cost reductions after rotavirus vaccine 
introduction ranged between $134 million and $257 million, 
and an estimated $1.228 billion was saved from 2008 to 2013 
(annual average AGE-related hospitalization costs averted, $204 
million).
DISCUSSION
The introduction of routine rotavirus vaccination in 2006 was 
followed by substantial reductions in the rate of AGE-related 
hospitalizations. We estimate that since the introduction of 
rotavirus vaccines in the United States in 2006, 382 000 hos-
pitalizations in children <5 years of age were averted, which 
results in $1.228 billion saved in direct hospitalization costs.

 BRIEF REPORT • JPIDS 2018:7 (September) • 259
Our results provide additional information that supports the 
effect that the implementation of rotavirus vaccines exerted on 
AGE-associated morbidity and costs in the United States.
Before rotavirus vaccine implementation, a mature rotavi-
rus vaccination program was estimated to avert 34 000 to 44 000 
hospitalizations in US children aged <5 years annually [9, 10]. 
Although these estimates were based on population sizes in 
the 1990s to early 2000s, our figure of ~80 000 hospitalizations 
averted during the most recent years of 2012 to 2013 substan-
tially exceeds expected reductions. A potential explanation 
is that pre–vaccine-introduction studies underestimated the 
burden of rotavirus-related hospitalizations in US children, 
because these figures were derived either by using indirect 
approaches such as measuring excess winter seasonal hospital-
izations or by using rotavirus-surveillance data from an active 
surveillance study conducted in a single city in the 1980s that 
showed that rotavirus accounted for approximately one-third of 
AGE-related hospitalizations. A more recent active surveillance 
study conducted in 3 US counties during the period immedi-
ately preceding rotavirus vaccine implementation revealed that 
rotavirus accounted for almost half of all AGE-related hospital-
izations during the months of January to June, and this figure is 
in line with the reductions we observed in the postvaccine years 
[11]. Also, studies have found that rotavirus vaccination confers 
indirect benefits to unvaccinated children (via herd immunity), 
which is a phenomenon that might have amplified the potential 
effect of vaccination [5].
Our study had some limitations. First, although the rota-
virus ICD-9-CM code has been shown to be specific for 
identifying laboratory-confirmed rotavirus hospitalizations, 
rotavirus-coded events underestimate the true burden of 
rotavirus-related hospitalizations because laboratory test-
ing and coding for rotavirus are not performed routinely for 
all patients with gastroenteritis [12]. Thus, we relied on all 
AGE-related hospitalizations to estimate national reductions 
in hospitalizations and costs after rotavirus vaccine intro-
duction. Although trends in AGE-related hospitalizations 
could be affected by secular changes in the incidence of other 
pathogens such as norovirus, the pattern of greater declines 
in more recent years with higher rotavirus vaccine coverage 
supports the theory that the reductions are related primarily 
to rotavirus vaccination. Our cost-reduction assessment did 
not include office or emergency department visits, most pro-
fessional fees, or noncovered charges during hospitalization. 
Moreover, indirect costs to households in excess of hospital 
charges paid out of pocket (eg, time loss, transportation, etc) 
were not included. Therefore, our report underestimates the 
overall cost savings associated with rotavirus vaccine intro-
duction. Rotavirus-associated deaths are uncommon in the 
United States, and reporting through the HCUP might miss 
some cases, because only in-hospital diarrhea-related deaths 
in children tested for rotavirus would be captured. We could 
not estimate the effect that rotavirus vaccines had on reduc-
tion in the numbers of these deaths. Last, there was poten-
tial bias resulting from restricting the analyses to 26 states 
with consistent reporting; however, these 26 states account 
for almost three-fourths of the US birth cohort, so major bias 
is unlikely.
In conclusion, rotavirus vaccine introduction in the United 
States has resulted in a substantial decline in AGE-related hos-
pitalizations along with their associated costs. An expansion of 
this cost-savings analysis to include household and professional 
costs would enable updated cost-effectiveness estimates for rou-
tine use of rotavirus vaccines in the United States.
