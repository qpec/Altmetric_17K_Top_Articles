Abstract
Background—From October 2013 to April 2014, French Polynesia experienced the largest Zika 
virus (ZIKV) outbreak ever described at that time. During the same period, an increase in Guillain-
Barré syndrome (GBS) was reported, suggesting a possible association between ZIKV and GBS.
Patients and Methods—A case-control study was performed to identify the role of ZIKV and 
dengue virus (DENV) infection in developing GBS. Cases were GBS patients diagnosed at the 
Centre Hospitalier de Polynésie Française during the outbreak period. Controls were age-, gender-, 
and residence-matched patients who presented at the hospital with a non-febrile illness (Control 
group 1 [CTR1]; n=98), and age-matched patients with acute ZIKV disease and no neurological 
symptoms (Control group 2 [CTR2]; n=70). Virological investigations included RT-PCR for ZIKV, 
and both microsphere immunofluorescent and seroneutralization assays for ZIKV and DENV. 
Anti-glycolipid reactivity was studied in GBS patients using both ELISA and combinatorial 
microarrays.
Results—Forty-two patients were diagnosed with GBS during the study period. Ninety-eight 
percent of GBS patients had anti-ZIKV IgM or IgG, and all had neutralizing antibodies against 
ZIKV compared to 55.7% with neutralizing antibodies in the CTR1 group (P<0.0001). Ninety-
three percent of GBS patients had ZIKV IgM and 88% had experienced a transient illness in 
median six days before the onset of neurological symptoms, suggesting recent ZIKV infection. 
GBS patients had electrophysiological findings compatible with the acute motor axonal 
neuropathy (AMAN) type, and had rapid evolution of disease (median duration of the installation 
and plateau phases was 6 and 4 days, respectively). Twelve (29%) patients required respiratory 
assistance. No patients died. Anti-glycolipid antibody activity, notably against GA1, was found in 
13 (31%) patients by ELISA and 19/41 (46%) by glycoarray at admission. The typical AMAN-
associated anti-ganglioside antibodies were rarely present. There was no significant difference in 
past dengue history between GBS patients and the two control groups.
Conclusion—This is the first study providing evidence for ZIKV infection causing GBS. As 
ZIKV is spreading rapidly across the Americas, at risk countries need to prepare for adequate 
intensive care beds capacity for managing GBS patients.
Background
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) in the genus Flavivirus, family 
Flaviviridae.1 ZIKV was first isolated from a Rhesus monkey in 1947 in the Zika forest of 
Uganda.2 The first human infection was reported in Nigeria in 1954.3 Like dengue (DENV) 
and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses, ZIKV adapted from an ancestral transmission cycle 
involving non-human primates and a broad spectrum of canopy dwelling mosquito species 
as vectors to an urban / periurban cycle involving humans as reservoirs and widely 
distributed Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes as vectors.4
From the 1950s, ZIKV was only reported as circulating sporadically in Africa and South-
East Asia.5 In 2007, ZIKV was isolated for the first time in the Pacific, on the Micronesian 
island of Yap.6 From October 2013 to April 2014, French Polynesia experienced the largest

 Zika outbreak ever reported at that time.7 It was estimated that more than 32,000 patients 
consulted for suspected ZIKV infection, with a weekly incidence peaking on week 9 of the 
outbreak.8 From 2014, ZIKV spread to other Pacific islands, notably Easter island (Chile). 
In March 2015, Brazil reported autochthonous transmission of ZIKV,9 and an outbreak was 
declared 6 months later.10 As of February 1, 2016, ZIKV had emerged in 25 countries and 
territories in South/Central America, with alarming reports of microcephaly cases among 
neonates in Brazil.11
Previously to the French Polynesian outbreak, ZIKV infection used to be described as a mild 
febrile illness with clinical symptoms including maculopapular rash, joints and muscles 
pain, headache and non-purulent conjunctivitis.6 Between November 2013 and February 
2014 in French Polynesia, 42 patients presented at hospital with Guillain-Barré syndrome 
(GBS), an autoimmune disease causing acute or subacute flaccid paralysis, contrasting with 
reports of 5, 10, 3 and 3 in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively.12 Other arboviral 
diseases like West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis, chikungunya and dengue had already been 
reported to sometimes cause GBS,13–16 but only during the outbreak in French Polynesia 
was this severe neurological complication first described associated with ZIKV infection.17 
The temporal coincidence between the peaks in incidence of ZIKV and GBS cases, and also 
the concurrent circulation of DENV serotypes 1 and 318 suggested possible causal 
relationship between the three events. Using two control series, we addressed the hypothesis 
that ZIKV infection with or without DENV concurrent or sequential infection may be a risk 
factor for the development of GBS.
Methods
Study design and participants
A case-control study was performed to identify the role of ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) 
infection in developing GBS. Cases were GBS patients diagnosed at the Centre Hospitalier 
de Polynésie Française in Papeete, Tahiti, during the outbreak period. As a routine, all 
patients with suspicion of GBS in French Polynesia are referred to the CHPF for diagnosis 
confirmation. All of the patients included in this study were diagnosed as developing a GBS 
by neurologists or staff in intensive care units according to international criteria.19 Clinical 
and demographic data were collected from medical records obtained during patients’ 
hospitalisation. The data recorded for all patients included: patient’s age, gender, island of 
residence, medical history and co-morbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, illness duration 
and severity. Electrophysiological assessment was performed for all patients using standard 
electromyography [EMG] techniques including motor nerve conduction studies of the 
median nerve (recording of the abductor pollicis brevis), the ulnar nerve (recording of the 
abductor digiti minimi) and the peroneal nerve (recording of the extensor digitorum brevis), 
as well as sensory nerve conduction studies in radial and sural nerves.
To estimate the proportion of ZIKV infections in the general population, to be further 
compared with the GBS series, a first control group (CTR1, n=98) was recruited among 
patients hospitalised or consulting for non-febrile illness at the CHPF. Patients from the 
CTR1 group were matched for age (±10 years), gender and island of residence with patients

 in the GBS group. Each patient in CTR1 group had a blood sample taken ±7 days from the 
admission date of the matching GBS case.
To investigate a possible role of past DENV infection(s) in developing a GBS in ZIKV 
infected patients, a second control group (CTR2, n=70) was recruited among age-matched 
(± 10 years) patients with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection, but who did not develop any 
neurological complication.
The epidemic curve of ZIKV in French Polynesia was obtained by extrapolating data from a 
sentinel network of clinicians who have been reporting the number of suspected ZIKV cases 
on a weekly basis from October 2013 until April 2014 to the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire – 
Direction de la Santé de Polynésie Française.
Zika and dengue virus infection diagnosis
For the GBS group, a first blood sample was collected at hospital admission and one to three 
additional blood samples were collected three weeks, two and/or three months later. For the 
CTR1 group, the blood sample was collected within a 7-day period from the indexed GBS 
case for 59 (60.2%) patients, and with a median (IQR) period of 13 (9-16) days for the 
remaining controls.
Diagnosis of ZIKV acute infection in patients from GBS and CTR2 groups was performed 
using a ZIKV specific RT-PCR protocol adapted from Lanciotti et al.20 Serum was 
considered positive for ZIKV if the two distinct genomic regions targeted by the RT-PCR 
were amplified.
Detection of IgM against ZIKV and DENV in blood samples from patients in GBS and 
CTR1 groups was performed using indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) on Vero cells 
(African Green Monkey kidney cells) infected with either ZIKV[PF13-251013-18] or 
DENV[D1-Hawaii 1944].
Detection of IgG against ZIKV and each of the four DENV serotypes was performed on 
blood samples from patients in GBS, CTR1 and CTR2 groups using a recombinant-antigen 
based microsphere immunoassay (MIA) adapted from Beck et al.21 (see details in 
Supplementary material).
Detection of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV and each of the four DENV serotypes was 
performed for patients in the GBS and CTR1 groups using a microseroneutralization assay 
performed on Vero cells inoculated with serial dilutions of each serum previously incubated 
with titrated ZIKV[PF13-251013-18] or DENV serotype 1 to 4 strains that were isolated 
during previous outbreaks in French Polynesia (see details in Supplementary material).
Immunochemical reaction with glycolipids
The sera from both GBS patients (n=42 at admission, n=31 at 3 months) and healthy blood 
donors (collected prior to April 2013; n=20) were tested by ELISA (Bühlmann-
Gangliocombi®) for IgG/IgM reactivity to the glycolipids GM1, GA1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b 
and GQ1b at 1:100 dilution. As per kit instructions, results were considered as positive,

 equivocal, and negative when showing >50%, 30-50%, and <30% binding, respectively. Sera 
(n=41 at admission, n=27 at three months) were also tested by a combinatorial microarray 
screening method based on a refinement and miniaturization of previous published 
combinatorial glycoarray assay22 (see details in Supplementary material).
Immunosuppression test for exploration of molecular mimicry mechanisms
The sera from six patients showing high reactivity towards GA1 were tested against ZIKV 
viral proteins by Western blot (see details in Supplementary material). Molecular mimicry 
was evaluated using the method by Neil.23 (see details in Supplementary material).
Sample size
The primary objectives of this study were to determine the association between GBS and 
ZIKV infection in French Polynesia and to determine whether possible co-infection or pre-
existing immunity to dengue (and a specific DENV serotype) appear to facilitate the 
development of GBS. With two controls per case, and on the assumption that 70% of GBS 
patients and 40% of controls reported a recent ZIKV infection, the statistical power to detect 
a difference between the GBS group and the control group was calculated to be 86%.
Statistical analysis
The risk of developing GBS per ZIKV infection was calculated by dividing the total 
estimated number of GBS cases reported in French Polynesia (n=42) by the total number of 
people infected by ZIKV during the epidemic period. This latter number was calculated by 
multiplying the attack rate (66%) estimated during a post epidemic population-based 
serological survey24 by the total population of French Polynesia (268 270 inhabitants; 2012 
census). The association between ZIKV positive serology, DENV positive serology, and 
GBS was analysed using exact conditional logistic regression. As the humoral response 
elicited by acute ZIKV infection may trigger production of anti-DENV IgG related to past 
DENV infections, we adjusted the odds-ratio (OR) describing the association between anti-
DENV IgG and GBS for the presence of anti-ZIKV IgG. All ORs are given with their 95% 
confidence intervals. Motor nerve conduction parameters values were compared to reference 
values using one-sample t tests, and 1st week values were compared to 4th month values 
using Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank sum tests. First week values of the 19 patients 
with electrophysiological measurements at 4th month were compared to those of the 18 
patients without follow-up using a Mann Whitney test. Data were collected using EpiData 
3.1 software and all statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14, StataCorp LP.

The study protocol was approved by the Comité d’Ethique de la Polynésie française (N°69/
CEPF 2014), and all patients provided informed consent for their participation in the study.

Results
Epidemiological dynamics of the outbreak
Cases of ZIKV infection were reported weekly from October 2013 until March 2014 (See 
Figure 1). The first GBS case was reported on week 5 of the outbreak, while the peaks of the 
Zika epidemic and GBS cases were reached on week 9 and 12, respectively. In total, 42 
cases of GBS were recorded during the ZIKV outbreak. Based on a 66% attack rate of ZIKV 
infection in the general population, the risk of GBS was estimated at 0.24 per 1000 ZIKV 
infections.
Patients characteristics
The median (IQR) age of GBS patients was 42 (36-56) years, 31 (74%) were males and 38 
(90%) were born in French Polynesia.
The clinical characteristics of the patients in the GBS group are shown in Table 1. Most 
(88%) had a recent history of viral syndrome, in median 6 days prior to the onset of 
neurological manifestations. Rash (81%), arthralgia (74%), fever (58%) were the most 
commonly reported symptoms.
The main characteristics of the GBS were the rapid progression to nadir (median of 6 days 
between the onset of neurological symptoms to the nadir), and the short plateau phase 
(median of 4 days). Clinical presentation at admission was manifested by generalised 
weakness (74%), with incapacity to walk (44%). Facial palsy was common (64%). Ninety 
three percent of the patients had increased (> 0.52 mg/dL) protein concentration in the 
cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture. Sixteen (38%) patients were admitted to 
intensive care unit, and 12 (29%) required respiratory assistance. All GBS cases received 
treatment by immunoglobulins, and one had plasmapheresis. The median duration of 
hospitalisation was 11 days for all patients, and 51 days for the 16 patients who were 
admitted into intensive care. No patients died. Three months after discharge, 24 (43%) 
patients were able to walk without assistance.
ZIKV and DENV infection diagnosis
Acute ZIKV infection, as confirmed by a positive RT-PCR result, was observed for all 
patients in the CTR2 group, but for none of the 41 patients tested in the GBS group (Table 
2A); thus corroborating clinical observations, notably the absence of fever, suggesting that 
the patients in the GBS group were no longer viremic at admission.
Recent infection by ZIKV was supported by the detection of anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies in 
92.9% and 17.3% of the patients in GBS and CTR1 groups, respectively (Table 2A). As 
possible cross-reactivity between anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV IgM responses had previously 
been described, IFA was performed using the two viruses. In the GBS group, 73.8% of the 
patients had IgM against ZIKV but not against DENV. All 19.1% patients with anti-DENV 
Cao-Lormeau et al.

 IgM also had IgM against ZIKV, suggesting that the anti-DENV IgM response could result 
from cross-reactivity.
When combining the results of both anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG, previous occurrence of a 
ZIKV infection was suggested for 97.6% of the patients in the GBS group and 35.7% in the 
CTR1 group (OR [95% CI] = 59.7 [10.4 - +∞]; P<0.0001; Table 2C). Moreover, a 
neutralizing response against ZIKV was observed for 100% of the patients in the GBS group 
and 55.7% in the CTR1 group (OR [95% CI] = 34.1 [5.8 - +∞]; P<0.0001).
The interpretation of anti-DENV IgM is difficult due to possible cross-reactivity with anti-
ZIKV IgM. Still, there was no indication of increased recent infection with DENV among 
GBS patients when compared to the CTR1 group (Table 2A; P>0.05). Past history of dengue 
was common among GBS patients (95.2% on the last sample available, away from the 
immunological boost associated with recent ZIKV infection). It was non significantly 
different from that of the CTR1 group (88.8%; OR [95% CI] = 2.0 [0.4 – 19.9]; P = 0.62) 
and the CTR2 group (82.9%; OR [95% CI] = 6.04 [0.81 – 269.5]; P = 0.10) (Table 2C and 
Suppl. Table 1). These non significant differences were further attenuated after stratifying by 
the presence of anti-ZIKV IgG, suggesting that the humoral response elicited by ZIKV 
infection also triggered production of anti-DENV IgG (Table 2B & 2C). This is corroborated 
by the examination of ZIKV and DENV IgG responses in the blood samples serially 
collected from the GBS patients. Indeed, the number of patients with anti-ZIKV IgG 
increased from the earliest to the intermediate and then to the latest sample, while the 
reverse occurred for anti-DENV IgG (Suppl. Table 1 & Suppl. Table 2). A possible 
explanation would be that an anamnestic anti-DENV IgG response in GBS patients might 
have been transiently boosted by the ZIKV infection.
Serological tests for Campylobacter jejuni (n=41), HIV (n=42), cytomegalovirus (n=32), 
Epstein-Barr virus (n=32) and herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (n=8) were negative.
Neurophysiological assessment
A total of 37 patients underwent electrophysiological examination during the first week after 
GBS onset (Table 3). Motor nerve conduction study showed the same pattern in all tested 
nerves, with prolonged distal latencies (P<0.0001) and marked reduction of the distal 
compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude (P<0.0001), indicative of severe 
conduction alteration in the distal nerve segments. By contrast, there was no significant 
conduction slowing or block in intermediate motor nerve segments (throughout forearm and 
legs). Amplitude and conduction velocity of sensitive potentials were not significantly 
altered in radial and sural nerves.
A second nerve conduction study was performed four months later including 19 GBS 
patients for whom a baseline assessment was available (there was no difference in baseline 
values of the 19 patients with follow-up compared the 18 without follow-up). By comparison 
to the first study, results showed a clear improvement of the distal conduction abnormalities 
(P<0.001), with reduction of the prolonged distal latencies and near normalization of CMAP 
amplitudes (Table 3 and Suppl. Figure 1). Altogether, these findings are suggestive of an 
acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN).

 Detection of reactivity towards glycolipids by ELISA
By ELISA, at admission, sera from 13 (31%) GBS patients showed a positive reactivity (% 
of binding >50%) against different glycolipids (Table 4 and Suppl. Table 2). Ten (24%) had 
an equivocal percentage of binding (between 30 and 50%). Among these 23 patients, 17 had 
a reactivity directed toward glycolipid GA1 (8 positive, 9 equivocal) and it was either 
isolated or shared with other glycolipids. At three months, the proportion of reactive sera 
had slightly increased (48%). Controls were negative (n=20). These results were 
heterogeneous and low intensity for 50% of them.
Test of reactivity of GBS patient’s sera with ZIKV viral proteins by Western blot
Western blot was used to test the reactivity against ZIKV viral proteins in the serum from 6 
GBS patients, 4 with high reactivity against GA1 (patients 6, 11, 20 and 29 of Suppl. Table 
2), and 2 patients with no reactivity against GA1 (patients 13 and 27 of Suppl. Table 2). All 
sera showed intense reactivity with viral proteins regardless of their reactivity towards GA1 
(Suppl. Figure 2).
Determination of specific interaction to GA1 by serum absorption with GA1
The reactivity of serum n°20 towards ZIKV proteins was not inhibited even at the highest 
GA1 amount (600 µg; Suppl. Figure 3). We further tested serum n°6 and did not observe any 
competition with a GA1 amount of 300 µg (data not shown).
Detection of reactivity towards glycolipids by combinatorial microarray
Combinatorial microarrays were used for screening glycolipid complexes as antigens. The 
majority of serum samples tested was negative or had low level binding to some single and 
or heteromeric glycolipid complex. Notably, antibodies against GA1:sulphatide complex 
were frequently observed (19/41; 46.3%) in patient sera, with intermediate binding 
intensities, above the threshold of positivity (p=0.001). In addition, a significant number of 
patient sera had antibodies raised against GA1 in complex with cholesterol and/or 
phosphatidylserine, although most were of low binding intensity (see Supplementary 
material and Suppl. Figure 4).
Discussion
This is the first study to evaluate the role of ZIKV infection in a large number of GBS 
patients diagnosed during a ZIKV outbreak. The serological investigations conducted on the 
blood samples from the 42 patients who developed a GBS during the French Polynesian 
ZIKV outbreak confirm that all these patients have experienced ZIKV infection. Moreover, 
the presence of IgM (92.9%) and the information that most (88%) patients reported a 
transient viral syndrome compatible with ZIKV disease in median 6 days prior to the onset 
of neurological symptoms, suggested a recent ZIKV infection. GBS patients were no longer 
viremic for ZIKV at the time of admission, consistent with previous data showing that ZIKV 
viremia rarely exceeds five days after disease onset.25 However, detection of virus in urine 
by RT-PCR may be a valuable alternative.26 As DENV 1 and 3 serotypes were co-
circulating at the time of the ZIKV epidemic,18 we investigated whether DENV infection 
might have contributed to the occurrence of GBS. Analysis of dengue serology (IFA, MIA,

 seroneutralization) did not support recent DENV infection. Most (95.2%) of the GBS 
patients had pre-existing dengue immunity, but this did not appear as being significantly 
different from the control groups.
GBS is an acute, immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy typically arising after minor 
viral and bacterial infections. Motor function is usually affected, beginning distally and 
progressing proximally over up to a 4-week period.27 Patients suffer from generalised 
weakness, areflexia and varying degree of sensory disturbances and involvement of cranial 
nerves.28 The risk of GBS increases with age and men are more commonly affected than 
women.29 The pathophysiology is incompletely understood, but is known to mostly occur 
2-8 weeks after an infection. GBS is the leading cause of non-traumatic paralysis, with a 
global incidence of 1-4 per 100,000 persons-years. The range of infections reported to have 
preceded GBS include upper respiratory infections, notably influenza and pseudo-influenza, 
digestive tract infections, notably Campylobacter jejuni, as well as cytomegalovirus and 
Epstein-Barr virus infections.30–32 The incidence rate of GBS cases during the French 
Polynesian outbreak was estimated at 0.24 per 1,000 ZIKV infections, at the lower range of 
the 0.25 to 0.65 per 1,000 observed following C. jejuni infections.33 It is unlikely that GBS 
cases were missed during the study period, since routine procedures for systematic 
confirmation of GBS diagnosis pre-existed the ZIKV epidemic, and all cases were 
systematically referred to the CPHF for diagnosis confirmation. While it is unknown 
whether attack rates of ZIKV epidemics will be as high in Latin America affected regions as 
compared to Pacific islands (73% in Micronesia6 and 66% in French Polynesia24), high 
number of GBS cases may be expected in the coming months as the result of this 
association. The results of our study support that ZIKV should be added to the list of 
infectious pathogens susceptible to cause GBS.
GBS patients in the present series had electrophysiological findings compatible with the 
AMAN type. EMG assessments performed during the first week of the disease showed 
marked distal motor nerve conduction alterations, which explain the neuromuscular 
weakness. Prolonged distal latencies and reduced distal CMAP amplitude may have been as 
first interpreted as demyelinating conduction slowing and block, leading to classify the GBS 
pattern as acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (AIDP) with possible axonal 
degeneration. However, the disappearance of the distal motor conduction alterations during 
the follow-up in a subset of patients, without development of abnormal temporal dispersion 
or conduction slowing in intermediate nerve segments, was consistent with “reversible 
conduction failure” already described in AMAN.34,35 In GBS patients, such nodal/
paranodal dysfunctions would be rather strictly localized in distal motor nerve endings.36 
The clinical outcome of these ZIKV GBS patients was generally favourable, despite a rapid 
onset and short plateau phase, as may be seen in other patient groups suffering from the 
AMAN type of GBS.37 Three months after discharge, 43% of the patients were able to walk 
without assistance.
Among the molecular mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of GBS, a broad range 
of anti-glycolipid IgG antibodies, notably directed to gangliosides, has been previously 
described, particularly in axonal variants of the disease.38,39 Results in this current study, 
using both ELISA and combinatorial microarray techniques found less than 50% of sera at

 admission with a significant autoimmune response against glycolipids, including 
gangliosides and/or glycolipid complexes (see supplementary material). This low detection 
rate for the AMAN clinical subtype, may be a reflection of the unique nature of the 
preceding infection and study population, in contrast with more typical post-Campylobacter 
GBS/AMAN clinical cohorts. These findings suggest that there may be autoantibodies in 
this post-ZIKV GBS cohort that cannot be fully identified by current methods. Moreover, 
complementary analysis of sera with reactivity against GA1 did not reveal any competition 
between GA1 and ZIKV proteins, thus suggesting the lack of antigenic mimicry between 
ZIKV antigens and GA1 in these GBS patients and casting doubt on the relevance of the 
anti-GA1 antibodies to neuropathy pathogenesis. The disease may not be anti-glycolipid 
antibody mediated, rather be mediated by other autoantibody specificities or unknown 
neurotoxic factors. Alternatively viral neurotoxicity may contribute a more direct but as yet 
unexplained role.
Because almost all of the GBS patients were of Polynesian origin and as distribution of HLA 
alleles had been previously described as being involved in certain forms of GBS,40 a 
possible role of ethnicity in triggering GBS was hypothesized. However, the high incidence 
of GBS recently reported in Brazil, El Salvador and Columbia during local ZIKV 
outbreaks11,41 suggests that, whenever involved, such host factors may not be specific to 
the ethnic groups living in French Polynesia.
In conclusion, this is the first study to document a large series of patients who developed a 
GBS following ZIKV infection, a virus that previously used to be considered as causing only 
mild disease. Most (88%) of the GBS patients reported symptomatic ZIKV infection that 
preceded by a median of 6 days the occurrence of neurological symptoms. All GBS were of 
the AMAN type, characterised by distal motor nerve involvement, the absence of typical 
patterns and levels of anti-glycolipid antibodies, and faster recovery than usually observed in 
typical GBS. As ZIKV is spreading rapidly across the Americas, at risk countries need to 
prepare for adequate intensive care beds capacity for managing GBS patients.
