Background-—Saturated fat (SFA), x-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), and trans fat (TFA) influence risk of coronary heart disease
(CHD), but attributable CHD mortalities by country, age, sex, and time are unclear.
Methods and Results-—National intakes of SFA, n-6 PUFA, and TFA were estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical model based on
country-specific dietary surveys; food availability data; and, for TFA, industry reports on fats/oils and packaged foods. Etiologic
effects of dietary fats on CHD mortality were derived from meta-analyses of prospective cohorts and CHD mortality rates from the
2010 Global Burden of Diseases study. Absolute and proportional attributable CHD mortality were computed using a comparative
risk assessment framework. In 2010, nonoptimal intakes of n-6 PUFA, SFA, and TFA were estimated to result in 711 800 (95%
uncertainty interval [UI] 680 700–745 000), 250 900 (95% UI 236 900–265 800), and 537 200 (95% UI 517 600–557 000) CHD
deaths per year worldwide, accounting for 10.3% (95% UI 9.9%–10.6%), 3.6%, (95% UI 3.5%–3.6%) and 7.7% (95% UI 7.6%–7.9%) of
global CHD mortality. Tropical oil–consuming countries were estimated to have the highest proportional n-6 PUFA– and SFA-
attributable CHD mortality, whereas Egypt, Pakistan, and Canada were estimated to have the highest proportional TFA-attributable
CHD mortality. From 1990 to 2010 globally, the estimated proportional CHD mortality decreased by 9% for insufficient n-6 PUFA
and by 21% for higher SFA, whereas it increased by 4% for higher TFA, with the latter driven by increases in low- and middle-income
countries.
Conclusions-—Nonoptimal intakes of n-6 PUFA, TFA, and SFA each contribute to significant estimated CHD mortality, with
important heterogeneity across countries that informs nation-specific clinical, public health, and policy priorities. (J Am Heart

C
oronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of
death worldwide and accounted for 7 million deaths in
2010.1 The types of dietary fats consumed play an important
role in CHD risk, representing key modifiable risk factors.2 In
particular, higher intakes of trans fat (TFA)3 and of saturated
fat (SFA) replacing x-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) are
associated with increased CHD,4,5 whereas higher intake of
PUFA replacing either SFA or carbohydrate is associated with
lower risk.6
Considerable heterogeneity is evident in intakes of these
dietary fats7 and in CHD mortality rates1 globally; however,
differences in CHD mortality attributable to nonoptimal
intakes of SFA, n-6 PUFA, and TFA by country, age, and sex
are not well established. Furthermore, whereas dietary
intakes and CHD rates have changed substantially in recent
decades, the regional and country-level trends in these
burdens have not been evaluated in detail. This may be
especially relevant for dietary linoleic acid, the predominant n-
6 PUFA, which appears to have similar CHD benefits whether
replacing SFA or carbohydrates.6 No prior study has inves-
tigated global CHD deaths attributable to higher SFA,
insufficient n-6 PUFA, and higher TFA consumption.
To address these gaps, we used a comparative risk
assessment framework to quantify CHD mortality due to
nonoptimal intakes of n-6 PUFA, SFA, and TFA in 186
countries in 1990 and 2010 by age and sex.

 Methods
Study Design
To quantify CHD burdens attributable to each dietary fat, we
used established methods8 to collect data on (1) population
distributions of dietary n-6 PUFA, SFA, and TFA in 1990 and
2010 by country, age, and sex; (2) age-specific etiologic
effects of these fats on CHD mortality; (3) optimal population
intakes of these fats; and (4) total numbers of CHD deaths in
1990 and 2010 by country, age, and sex. These inputs and
their uncertainty were incorporated into a comparative risk
assessment framework to estimate the proportional and
absolute CHD mortality attributable to each dietary fat.
Selection of Dietary Fats
We evaluated 3 dietary fats with probable or convincing
evidence for etiologic effects on CHD mortality: insufficient n-
6 PUFA (replacing either SFA or carbohydrates), higher SFA
(replacing n-6 PUFA), and higher TFA (replacing other fats).
These dietary factors were selected based on described
criteria.2 We did not include seafood x-3 PUFA because of its
distinct food sources and mechanistic pathways or plant x-3
PUFA or total monounsaturated fat (MUFA) because of
promising but not yet probable or convincing evidence for
causal effects on CHD.9,10 Our findings for PUFA reflect the
estimated CHD burdens related to nonoptimal n-6 PUFA, not
total or x-3 PUFA.
Dietary Consumption of Fats
Our methods for estimating intakes of key dietary factors
globally have been described.7,11,12 Briefly, we systematically
searched, identified, and compiled data from nationally
representative dietary surveys, large subnational surveys (if
national surveys were not available), United Nations food
balance sheets, and (for TFA) industry sales data on fats/oils
and packaged food to estimate age, sex, and country-specific
intakes of n-6 PUFA, SFA and TFA among adults in 1990 and
2010 (Table 1). Dietary fat consumption data and their
corresponding uncertainty were incorporated into a Bayesian
hierarchical model to estimate the mean intake levels and
corresponding statistical uncertainty for each age, sex,
country, and year stratum, accounting for differences in
dietary data, survey methods, representativeness, and sam-
pling and modeling uncertainty.2 The final model estimated
dietary SFA, n-6 PUFA, and TFA in 24 age and sex subgroups
(men and women across 12 age categories from 25–30 to
≥80 years) within 186 countries (those with year 2000
population >50 0002) in 1990 and 2010, representing
3.8 billion adults across 21 world regions.
Etiologic Effects of Dietary Fats on CHD Mortality
Etiologic effects of nonoptimal intakes of these dietary fats
on CHD mortality were evaluated, as described previ-
ously.2,11,13 The relative risk (RR) and its uncertainty for
each dietary fat were obtained from published meta-analyses
of prospective cohort studies including multivariable adjust-
ment for age, sex, other cardiovascular risk factors, and often
other dietary factors (Tables 1 and 2).4,6,14–20 These RRs
represent the best causal estimates for effects of each
dietary fat on CHD mortality. Based on these findings, we
evaluated the impact of insufficient n-6 PUFA as an isocaloric
replacement for either SFA or carbohydrate, excess SFA as an
isocaloric replacement for n-6 PUFA, and excess TFA as an
isocaloric replacement for other fats (equivalent thirds of SFA,
MUFA, and PUFA). Notably, depending on levels of SFA and n-
6 PUFA consumption within any age, sex, and country
stratum, the CHD burden attributable to insufficient n-6 PUFA
will nearly always include the CHD burden of excess SFA
consumption but not vice versa. In sensitivity analyses, we
assumed that benefits of reducing SFA also extended to
replacement with MUFA, although evidence linking total
MUFA to CHD mortality is not well-established.4,10 We did not
include potential effects on other cardiac, vascular, or other
chronic diseases due to insufficient evidence for causal
effects. Emerging evidence suggests, for instance, that SFA
may protect against stroke,21 certain TFA isomers may
increase risk of sudden death and diabetes,3 and n-6 PUFA
may protect against these end points.22 These end points can
be reevaluated in future analyses, as more evidence becomes
available.
Based on our prior work, proportional effects of dietary
factors on CHD mortality were generally similar by sex,5 thus
we assumed no heterogeneity in RRs by sex. Conversely,
proportional effects (RRs) of major CHD risk factors decline
with age in an approximately log-linear relationship23; we
applied this age-varying RR pattern to distributions of RRs for
dietary fats. We did not identify sufficient evidence for effect
modification by other factors, such as total diet quality or
obesity.
Optimal Intake Distribution of Dietary Fats
Optimal intakes of each dietary fat were determined using
reported methods,11,13 based on (1) observed levels asso-
ciated with lowest CHD mortality in meta-analyses, (2)
observed highest (for n-6 PUFA) or lowest (for SFA and TFA)
consumption levels in at least 2 to 3 countries globally, and
(3) general consistency with national and international
dietary guidelines.24,25 Using these methods, we identified
optimal intake levels of 12%E (percentage of total energy
intake) for n-6 PUFA, 10%E for SFA, and 0.5%E for TFA. For

 n-6 PUFA and SFA (Table 2), we recognized that optimal
intakes were further dependent on the replacement nutrient:
Benefits of reducing SFA
were
considered only
when
replaced by n-6 PUFA (up to 12%E), and benefits of
increasing n-6 PUFA were considered only when replacing
SFA (down to 10%E) or carbohydrate.4,6,10 For each fat, we
assumed no additional health benefits accrued beyond the
optimal intake level and nutrient replacement scenario within
each age, sex, and country stratum. In sensitivity analyses,
we evaluated potential harms of SFA down to an optimal
intake level of 7%E.
CHD Deaths by Country, Age, and Sex
Data on country-, age-, and sex-specific CHD mortalities
were obtained from the 2010 Global Burden of Diseases
study.1 Briefly, causes of death were collected in 186
countries from 1980 to 2010 based on vital registration,
verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, population census,
surveys, hospital and police records, and mortuaries; com-
pleteness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic
variations, and probable cause of death were assessed
(Table 1). CHD mortality was estimated using statistical
modeling
strategies
including
different
permutations
of
covariates. Model performance was assessed with rigorous
out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of
the 95% uncertainty interval (UI). CHD death was defined as

Statistical Analysis
The population-attributable fraction (PAF) due to nonoptimal
intakes of dietary fat was calculated using the following
equation:
PAFi ¼
R m
x¼0 RRiðxÞPiðxÞdx �
R m
x¼0 RRiðxÞP0iðxÞdx
R m
x¼0RRiðxÞPiðxÞdx
PAFi is a age-, sex- and country-specific population attribu-
table fraction; x is the level of dietary fat; Pi(x) is the age-, sex-
, and country-specific actual distribution of dietary fat; P0i(x) is
the age- and sex-specific optimal distribution of dietary fat;
RRi(x) is the age- and sex-specific multivariable-adjusted
RR of mortality at level x; and m is the optimal level of dietary
fat.
The age-, sex-, and country-specific absolute CHD mor-
tality attributable to each dietary fat was quantified by
multiplying the age-, sex-, and country-specific PAFi by the
total CHD deaths in the corresponding stratum. Absolute
attributable mortalities
were
summed
across

to
estimate national, regional, and global absolute burdens,

*For each individual survey, we obtained and assessed information about survey methods and population characteristics, and extracted or (in most cases) obtained data directly from the survey authors for dietary intakes by age, sex, and
time
†The country level dietary fat intakes were collected from the FAO annual food disappearance balance sheets for the 186 countries from 1990 to 2010.
‡The FAO-based estimate of SFA availability was based on tropical fats/oils, which could lead to underestimation of estimated intake in regions with missing data but in which meat and dairy intake are high; however, individual-level survey
data were available in most regions, minimizing such potential underestimation.
§For TFA intake, the hydrogenated oil net ratio corresponded to the net amount of hydrogenated oils available for consumption in each country-year. Using the FAO data, the numerator of this ratio was calculated based on exported
hydrogenated oil (in kcal per capita) and exported oil crops (in kcal per capita) through space-time with lag-distributed income as a covariates. The denominator was calculated by adding import values to production values minus the export
values, and then applying to the space-time model. In addition, TFA intake information was also obtained from Euromonitor using total fats/oils sold (per capita) via retail and total packaged foods sold (per capita) via retail.

 and divided by total CHD deaths within these strata for
corresponding proportional burdens. To evaluate changes
between 1990 and 2010, attributable CHD mortalities in
1990 were age-standardized to 2010 nation-specific age
distributions. Statistical uncertainty was quantified using the
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, drawing randomly
1000 times from the 95% uncertainty distributions of the
estimated dietary fat intake, its etiologic effect on CHD (RR),
and total CHD mortality within each age, sex, and country
stratum. The central PAF was derived from the mean value of
these 1000 estimations, and its 95% UI was derived from the
2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. All analyses were performed
using R software version 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing).
The study obtained institutional review board approval and
informed consent from participants. The paper was also
approved by an institutional review committee.
Results
Detailed findings on dietary n-6 PUFA, SFA, and TFA by age,
sex, country, and region in 1990 and 2010 have been
reported7 (Tables 3, 4, S1, and S2). In 2010, national mean
intakes across 186 nations ranged from 1.2%E to 12.5%E for
n-6 PUFA, 2.3%E to 27.5%E for SFA, and 0.2%E to 6.5%E for
TFA.
Global and Regional Attributable CHD Mortality
In 2010, 711 800 (95% UI 680 700–745 000) CHD deaths
per year worldwide were estimated to be attributable to
insufficient n-6 PUFA consumption in place of carbohydrate or
SFA, accounting for 10.3% (95% UI 9.9%–10.6%) of total global
CHD mortality and for 187 (95% UI 179–196) CHD deaths per
year per 1 million adults (Table 3). Of these, 45% (316 400,

§Although potential harms of high n-6 PUFA consumption have been theorized,14–16 randomized controlled trials demonstrate no evidence linking dietary LA to increased levels of
inflammation.17 LA improves all major lipid and lipoprotein risk factors18 and both total n-6 PUFA and LA are associated with lower risk of clinical CHD events.4,6 Indeed, higher blood
biomarker levels of arachidonic acid, the prototypical n-6 PUFA considered to be harmful, are actually linked to significantly lower risk of CHD.19 Thus, the American Heart Association, US
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, and United Nations have each concluded that higher LA consumption is beneficial for health.4,6,19 In observational cohorts and controlled trials of
clinical events, levels of dietary LA linked to lower risk range from �7%E to 10%E and 9%E to 30%E, respectively.
kHigher TFA consumption defined as higher TFA (>0.5%E) intake replacing SFA or n-6 PUFA or monounsaturated fats.

 95% UI 296 900–337 900) occurred prematurely (aged
<70 years), and 43% (306 000, 95% UI 284 300–329 300)
occurred among women. As expected based on underlying
CHD rates, absolute attributable mortality was higher at older
than younger ages. Conversely, attributable proportional CHD
mortality was higher at younger versus older ages, consistent
with larger proportional effects of diet on CHD at younger
ages. Eastern Europe had the most absolute n-6 PUFA–
attributable CHD deaths per year (547 per 1 million adults,
95% UI 464–640) (Figure 1), and Oceania had the highest
proportion of n-6 PUFA–attributable CHD deaths (18.6%, 95%
UI 16.9%–20.2%). In comparison, East Asia had both fewest
absolute (74 per 1 million adults, 95% UI 63–87) and lowest
proportion (6.7%, 95% UI 5.9%–7.5%) of n-6 PUFA–attributable
CHD mortality.
When we evaluated the impact of excess SFA intake in
place of n-6 PUFA, an estimated 250 900 (95% UI 236 900–
265 800) attributable CHD deaths per year worldwide in 2010
were identified and accounted for 3.6% (95% UI 3.5%–3.7%) of
global CHD deaths and 66 (95% UI 62–70) CHD deaths per
year per 1 million adults (Table 3). Globally, CHD mortality
attributable to higher SFA was only one-third of that
attributable to insufficient n-6 PUFA, with much of this
difference seen in south Asia.
Excess TFA consumption was estimated to cause 537 200
(95% UI 517 600–557 000) CHD deaths per year worldwide
in 2010, representing 7.7% (95% UI 7.6%–7.9%) of global CHD
mortality and 141 (95% UI 136–146) CHD deaths per year per
1 million adults (Table 3). Of these, women accounted for 44%
and premature deaths for 45%. High-income nations generally
had higher TFA-attributable CHD mortality than lower-income
nations. Younger adults generally experienced higher propor-
tional TFA-attributable CHD mortality related to both higher
consumption and, more so, higher proportional effects of diet

 on CHD at younger ages. Highest absolute TFA-attributable
CHD mortality was in North America (488 per 1 million adults,
95% UI 428–557) (Figure 2), accounting for 18% of CHD
deaths in this region. Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean
had the lowest estimated TFA-attributable CHD mortality,
accounting for <5% of CHD mortality in these regions.
In sensitivity analyses, allowing higher SFA intake to be
replaced by both n-6 PUFA and MUFA resulted in an
estimated 255 900 (95% UI 238 600–276 200) SFA-attribu-
table CHD deaths per year in 2010 (Table 5), whereas
lowering the optimal level of SFA consumption from 10%E to
7%E produced an estimated 376 900 (95% UI 358 600–
396 100) SFA-attributable CHD deaths per year. Evaluating
both assumptions simultaneously, global annual SFA-attribu-
table CHD deaths per year were 459 300 (95% UI 435 300–
485 800), accounting for 8.7% (95% UI 8.4%–8.9%) of global
CHD deaths.
Nation-Specific CHD Attributable Mortality
Across 186 individual nations in 2010, the highest number of
n-6 PUFA–attributable absolute CHD deaths were observed in
several former Soviet states, in particular Ukraine (647 CHD
deaths per year per 1 million adults, 95% UI 505–823)
(Figure 3, Table S1). In tropical oil–consuming nations such as
Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Philippines, and Malaysia, about 1 in
5 CHD deaths were attributed to insufficient n-6 PUFA.
In most countries, magnitudes of absolute and proportional
SFA-attributable CHD mortality were smaller than those for n-
6 PUFA (typically �60% lower) (Figure 4, Table S1), except in
tropical oil–consuming nations with very high SFA intakes.
The largest relative differences in n-6 PUFA– versus SFA-
attributable CHD mortality were found in some South Asian
nations, including Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh,
as well as Caribbean and sub-Saharan African nations. In

Organization income levels are as follows: high, ≥$12 616 per capita; upper-middle, $4086 to $12 615 per
capita; lower-middle, $1036 to $4085 per capita; low, ≤$1035 per capita. Attributable CHD mortality was
estimated for (A) higher SFA intake (red triangles), modeled as decreasing consumption to 10%E when
isocalorically replaced with PUFA up to 12%E; (B) insufficient n-6 PUFA (blue diamonds), modeled as
increasing consumption to 12%E when isocalorically replaced with either carbohydrates or SFA; and (C)
higher TFA (green circles), modeled as decreasing consumption to 0.5%E when isocalorically replacing with
other fats. *In Egypt, TFA-attributable CHD mortality per 1 million adults was 1120, beyond the x-axis scale.

 these, CHD mortality attributable to SFA was a fraction (often
<10%) of that attributable to insufficient n-6 PUFA.
Among the 20 most populous countries, Russia, Germany,
and Egypt had the highest absolute CHD mortality attributable
to insufficient n-6 PUFA, with >335 CHD deaths per year per 1
million adults in each (Figure 5, Table 4). SFA-attributable
absolute CHD mortality was also highest in Russia as well as
in the Philippines and Thailand. In contrast, Iran, Pakistan, and
India had few SFA-attributable CHD deaths but had substan-
tial CHD mortality attributable to insufficient n-6 PUFA.
The highest TFA-attributable absolute CHD mortality was
found in Egypt, with 1120 (95% UI 1036–1209) deaths per
year per 1 million adults (Figure 3, Table S1). Other countries
with substantial TFA-associated CHD mortality included
Canada, Pakistan, and the United States, each with >475
TFA-attributable CHD deaths per year per 1 million adults. In
these countries, excess TFA accounted for >17% of corre-
sponding national CHD mortality (Figure 6). In comparison, 33
of 186 countries had proportional TFA-attributable mortality
<3%.

 Temporal Trends
From 1990 to 2010, global mean dietary intakes increased by
0.5%E for n-6 PUFA and 0.1%E for TFA and decreased by 0.2%
E for SFA, corresponding to relative changes of +8%, +11%,
and �2% (Tables 3 and 4).7 Consistent with these dietary
changes, global proportional attributable CHD mortality
between 1990 and 2010 decreased by 9% for insufficient n-
6 PUFA and 21% for higher SFA but increased by 4% for higher
TFA.
Nearly all world regions experienced stable or declining
trends in proportional n-6 PUFA– and SFA-attributable CHD
mortality over this time period, except for Oceania, which
experienced a 5% increase (Figures 1 and 7). For insufficient
n-6 PUFA, Eastern Europe, East Asia, and the Caribbean
experienced the most substantial declines in proportional
attributable CHD mortality (�26%, �24%, �18%). Conversely,
many world regions experienced increases in proportional
TFA-attributable CHD mortality, largest in Asia (+12.5%
~33.8%) (Figure 2), Central America (+36.3%), and the
Caribbean (+30.7%). In contrast to these developing regions,
Western Europe experienced large declines in proportional
TFA-attributable CHD mortality (�14.7%).
Nation-specific trends in CHD mortality attributable to
different dietary fats from 1990 to 2010 are shown in Tables
S1 and S2. Among the 20 most populous nations, the United
States, Germany, and Thailand experienced decreases and
Bangladesh experienced an increase in age-standardized CHD
mortality per 1 million population that was attributable to all
dietary fats (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Annual CHD mortality attributable to SFA, n-6PUFA, and TFA in the world’s 20 most populous nations in 1990 and 2010. The x-axis
represents CHD deaths per 1 million adults attributable to different dietary fats, calculated by dividing the number of attributable CHD deaths by
the adult population (defined as people aged ≥25 years) of the specific country and then multiplying by 1 million. The y-axis (from the top to the
bottom) shows the 20 most populous countries in 2010. The error bars represent the 95% uncertainty level. The optimal level is 10�1%E for
SFA, 12�1.2%E for n-6 PUFA, and 0.5�0.05%E for TFA. %E indicates percentage of total energy intake; CHD, coronary heart disease; n-6 PUFA,

 Discussion
Our new findings, based on best available data on dietary fat
consumption; diet-disease etiologic effects; and country-, age-
, and sex-specific CHD mortality, provide estimates of global,
regional, and national burdens of CHD mortality attributable
to nonoptimal n-6 PUFA, SFA, and TFA. In 2010, an estimated
711 800, 250 900, and 537 200 CHD deaths worldwide were
attributable to nonoptimal n-6 PUFA, SFA, and TFA, respec-
tively, corresponding to 10.3%, 3.6%, and 7.7% of global CHD
mortality. Important heterogeneity was identified across world
regions and nations. In addition, between 1990 and 2010,
estimated proportional CHD mortality for nonoptimal n-6
PUFA and SFA decreased by 9% and 21%, respectively,
whereas for TFA, it increased 4%. These global trends
represented averages of important regional and national
differences, such as increases in n-6 PUFA-attributable CHD
mortality in Oceania but decreases in most other regions and
increases in TFA-attributable CHD mortality in low- and
middle-income countries but decreases in Western Europe.
Growing evidence indicates that lowering SFA provides
convincing cardiovascular benefits only when replaced by
PUFA, whereas cardiovascular benefits of n-6 PUFA are
similar whether replacing SFA or total carbohydrates.4,6,10
Our
analysis
provides,
for
the
first
time,
a
rigorous
comparison of global CHD burdens attributable to insuffi-
cient n-6 PUFA versus higher SFA. In 80% of nations, n-6
PUFA–attributable CHD burdens were at least 2-fold higher
than SFA-attributable burdens. This suggests that focus on
increasing healthful n-6–rich vegetable oils may provide
important public health benefits. In countries such as
Ethiopia and Pakistan, n-6 PUFA–attributable CHD mortality
was >15 times that attributable to SFA, suggesting needs to
prioritize increases in n-6 PUFA–rich vegetable oils rather
than decreased SFA in these countries. In tropical oil–
producing nations in Southeast Asia and Oceania, SFA- and
n-6 PUFA–attributable CHD burdens were more similar,
consistent with very high consumption of SFA from tropical
oils, especially palm oil.
Current evidence on benefits of exchanging SFA with PUFA
derives mainly from studies replacing animal fats, especially
meats and butter, with soybean and other vegetable oils.4,5,26
Cardiovascular effects of SFA from different food sources, or
perhaps more relevantly the net cardiovascular effects of
different SFA-rich foods, may differ widely.26,27 Health effects
of tropical oils, for example, may be influenced by triglyceride

 regioisomerism28 or benefits of trace phytochemicals.29 This
remains speculative, and long-term studies are required to
evaluate the health effects of tropical oils. Our results should
be considered the best currently available estimates of CHD
burdens attributable to average SFA consumption from animal
fats, especially meats and butter, when replaced fully with
PUFA. Caution should be exercised when interpreting our
estimated SFA-attributable burdens in nations having mean-
ingful SFA intake from other sources, such as cheese, yogurt,
or tropical oils. If cardiovascular effects of total SFA are
similar for animal fats versus tropical oils, then the identified
SFA-related CHD mortality calls for stronger policy efforts to
replace tropical oils with PUFA-rich vegetable oils in South-
east Asia and Oceania. Current efforts mainly rely on nutrition
labeling to reduce SFA, but that may have small effects30
resulting from low public awareness, confusion or misinter-
pretation of the label, and low access to n-6–rich alternatives.
In sensitivity analysis, SFA-attributable burdens would be
larger if replacement with either PUFA or MUFA would provide
benefits. Using MUFA would also provide a wider, more
feasible range of fat/oil alternatives. Unfortunately, evidence
for the cardiovascular benefits of total MUFA remains
uncertain.4,10 Based on limited numbers of trials, MUFA from
nuts and extra virgin olive oil appears likely to provide
cardiometabolic benefits31,32; however, these represent minor
global sources of MUFA and emphasize the need for more
research on long-term health effects of other common
sources.
We evaluated 2 potentially optimal levels of SFA: 10%E and
7%E. In 2010, 75 of 186 countries had already achieved the
10%E level, whereas only 18 had achieved 7%E. The latter,
however, tended to be poor countries with higher levels of
hunger and malnutrition; diets rich in inexpensive, starchy
staples; and diets lower in more diverse, healthful foods.12 In

 these nations, very low SFA consumption is often paired with
high consumption of refined grains or starches, which may be
more harmful than SFA.4,5 This highlights the need for caution
and monitoring of actual nutrient replacements if SFA is
targeted in any given country.
Even at low intake levels, TFA-attributable mortality
remains high globally. This is consistent with unique adverse
effects of industrially produced TFA on both lipid and nonlipid
pathways.3 We found that between 1990 and 2010, TFA-
attributable CHD mortality decreased in many high-income
countries, consistent with ongoing policy strategies to reduce
industrial TFA.33,34 Nevertheless, we estimated remaining TFA
consumption to cause >15% of CHD deaths in countries such
as the United States and Canada, exceeding CHD mortality
attributable to SFA. Given ongoing industry reformulations
and absence of reliable national TFA consumption data, these
findings should be interpreted cautiously and updated as
more data become available. National reformulations suggest
that TFA reduction is slowing in the United States,35 indicating
a need for continued surveillance and strong policy efforts.
In contrast to Western nations, we found increased TFA-
attributable burdens in many middle- and low-income coun-
tries between 1990 and 2010 (eg, Egypt, Pakistan, Mexico). In
these countries, exposure to TFA likely derives not only from
industrially packaged foods but also from widespread use of
inexpensive partially hydrogenated cooking fats in homes, in
small restaurants, and by street-food vendors. These diverse
sources represent a challenge to reducing TFA in developing
nations and suggest a need for coordinated national policies
including mandatory labeling, direct restrictions, and govern-
ment-promoted industry self-regulation.36,37
Validity of our estimates is influenced by the validity of the
etiologic effects. For n-6 PUFA and industrial TFA, estimated
etiologic effects are similar whether considering predicted
effects based on established changes in metabolic risk factors
from randomized trials, observed relationships with clinical
events in prospective cohorts, or (for PUFA) pooled effects on
events in meta-analysis of clinical trials.4,6,20 For SFA
replacing PUFA, evidence is similar, although, as noted
earlier, such effects appear to vary depending on the food
source, making estimated SFA-attributable burdens more
uncertain in nations (and persons) with diverse food sources
of SFA. The dietary fats investigated in this study are also 1
component of overall dietary quality. Other cardiometabolic
risks, such as other dietary factors, physical activity, smoking,
medication, and obesity, influence CHD and contribute to total
burdens. Our findings represent estimates of independent
contributions of these dietary fats to CHD mortality world-
wide, reflecting the average population effect within each age,
sex, and country stratum, not the burden for any individual
patient. Nevertheless, benefits from other dietary compo-
nents, such as dietary fiber, plant-based proteins, and other
phytochemicals derived from fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
nuts, and legumes, while limiting added sugars and salt, also
deserve attention.
Our investigation has several strengths. We used the most
valid available global data on dietary consumption based on
systematic
searches and extensive direct
contacts
for
nationally
representative
individual-level
dietary
surveys,
complemented by national food availability and industry data.
We evaluated and used evidence on heterogeneity of diet–
disease relationships, in particular, by age. Underlying death
rates across countries were systematically corrected for
differences in data availability and national coding patterns.
We incorporated and accounted for sources of uncertainty,
including uncertainty in the dietary data and diet–disease
etiologic effects. We did not perform ecologic (correlative)
analyses of dietary fats and CHD, which could be strongly
biased by cross-national confounders and ecologic fallacy, but
rather used comparative risk assessment based on external
published evidence on etiologic effects on clinical CHD
events.
Potential limitations should be considered. Due to less
available data, our estimates were more uncertain in some
regions, inflating uncertainty of estimated disease burdens.
Few national surveys assessed TFA, which we evaluated
based on available dietary surveys, blood TFA levels, and
industry sales data on partially hydrogenated oils and
packaged foods. These findings highlight the need for
expanded surveillance of TFA in both developed and devel-
oping countries to help inform public policy. Our TFA-
attributable burdens are based on average effects of TFA
from partially hydrogenated oils, and certain isomers (eg, 18:2
isomers) may have more harmful effects. Most cohorts
included in meta-analyses of diet–disease relationships did
not correct for dietary variation over time, resulting in
underestimation of true etiologic effects and attributable
mortality. Except for age, modification effects of other
cardiometabolic risk factors were not identified; such effects
can be incorporated in future analyses if such evidence
emerges. We evaluated CHD mortality, and attributable
burdens owing to nonfatal CHD events would be higher.
In conclusion, we estimated that insufficient n-6 PUFA,
excess TFA, and, to a lesser extent, excess SFA are leading to
significant CHD mortality globally. These findings will help
inform global, regional, and national policy priorities and
public health programs to reduce burdens of chronic disease.
