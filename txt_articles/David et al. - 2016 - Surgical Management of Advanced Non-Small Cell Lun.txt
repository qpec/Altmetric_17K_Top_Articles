Abstract
Background—For patients with advanced stage Non—Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), 
chemotherapy and chemoradiation are the principal treatment modalities, and the role of surgical 
resection remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate current trends and oncologic outcomes in 
advanced stage NSCLC. We hypothesized that surgery is associated with increased survival and 
may be an underutilized treatment modality.
Methods—The California Cancer Registry was queried from 2004–2012 for cases of stage IIIA, 
IIIB, and IV NSCLC, and we identified 34,016 cases. Patients were categorized by treatment 
group, and linear regression was used to calculate trends in treatment and predictors of treatment 
group. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modeling were used to determine the influence of 
treatment group on overall (OS).
Results—Twenty- seven percent (9223/34,016) of patients received no treatment. For the entire 
cohort, treatment with chemotherapy alone increased (p <0.001), but treatment with radiation 
alone, surgery alone or in any combination decreased (p=0.011, <0.001, 0.021, 0.007, and 0.094) 
Treatment group, age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, stage, histology, and tumor size were all 
significant predictors of OS. OS was significantly longer in patients who had surgery as part of 
their treatment regimen (p<0.001).

 Conclusions—For patients with advanced stage NSCLC, the use of multimodality regimens that 
include surgery are decreasing despite longer OS. Future studies are needed to identify the 
demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with advanced stage NSCLC who may 
benefit from surgery.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in 
developed countries for both sexes worldwide, accounting for more than 1.4 million deaths 
per year[1]. Unfortunately, the vast majority (79%) of patients are diagnosed with stage IIIA, 
IIIB or IV disease, which dramatically reduces the chance for cure or meaningful 
survival[2]. Overall five-year survival for all patients with NSCLC is approximately 17.4%, 
but varies by stage [2]. Meaningful long-term survival is typically limited to patients with 
localized disease who are candidates for surgical resection. Surgery only with curative 
intent, for select stage IIIa and IV patients, in combination with other treatment modalities, 
but is not currently recommended for stage IIIb patients.
Under the current guidelines, there are circumstances in which patients with stage IIIA or IV 
NSCLC are eligible to undergo surgical resection, in the context of a multimodality 
approach [3]. Retrospective studies have observed improved survival among advanced stage 
NSCLC patients who have received surgical therapy [4–12]. An analysis of National Cancer 
Database (NCDB) data demonstrated increased survival for stage IIIA patients who have 
surgery included in their treatment regimen. However, this analysis also showed that few of 
these patients received surgical resection (14%) [13]. Similarly, for Stage IIIB (defined as 
T4N2 or any N3) patients, the incorporation of surgery into multidisciplinary treatment is 
associated with increased survival. The increased survival observed with surgery persisted 
after adjusting for confounding variables including receipt of chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy in a propensity-matched analysis of the NCDB [10]. Among patients with 
Stage IV disease who harbor limited disease burden or oligometastatic disease, surgical 
management has also been associated with increased survival [14,15]. The increased survival 
seen in these circumstances has been attributed to selection bias leading to patients with 
better performance status and/or more limited metastatic burden undergoing surgery. It has 
been difficult to objectively measure the extent and mechanism of selection bias using using 
large cancer registries because they lack granular patient data to fully characterize 
differences in treatment allocation to explain this selection bias. Despite the trend for 
increased survival in patients undergoing surgery as part of a multimodality approach, the 
use of surgery in this population is generally low. Therefore, we sought to characterize the 
trends in treatment of advanced stage NSCLC and characterize the oncologic outcomes. We 
hypothesized that surgery is associated with increased survival and may be an underutilized 
treatment modality for appropriately selected patients.
Patients and Methods
This study was exempt by the University of California, Davis IRB. Patients were identified 
through the California Cancer Registry (CCR), which includes data for the entire population 
of California. The CCR is a participant in the National Cancer Institute Surveillance 
Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, the only comprehensive source of

 population-based information in the US which includes stage of cancer at the time of 
diagnosis and rigorous survival data.
Data in the CCR are abstracted from medical records and include patient demographics, 
tumor characteristics, and type of surgical resection. Race/ethnicity in the CCR is based on 
information collected from medical records supplemented with linkage to algorithms to 
appropriately identify Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Race/ethnicity was categorized 
as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific 
Islander. Patient address at diagnosis is assigned to a census tract, and neighborhood 
socioeconomic status (SES) was based on U.S. Census characteristics combined into the 
summary Yost index, categorized into quintiles [16].
Only patients for whom NSCLC was the first or only cancer diagnosis and who had invasive 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma were included. Patients diagnosed at autopsy 
were excluded from analysis. Stage at diagnosis was defined based on the SEER 
modification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Patients diagnosed 
as stage III or IV from 2004–2012 were included in this analysis. In the CCR, stage refers to 
clinical stage for patients who have not had surgery and pathologic stage for patients who 
have had surgery, if complete staging information is available. Patients were followed 
through December 31, 2012.
Types of treatment included No Treatment (NTX); Chemotherapy only (Chemo); Radiation 
only (Rad); Chemoradiation (CR); Surgery only (SURG); Chemotherapy and Surgery (CS); 
Surgery and Radiation (SurgRad); Chemotherapy, Radiation, and Surgery (CRS); and 
Unknown (UNK). Types of surgery included sublobar resection (wedge and 
segmentectomy), lobectomy, and bilobectomy/pneumonectomy. Chi-square tests were used 
to determine whether baseline characteristics in demographic characteristics and treatment 
were significantly different between the treatment groups. Linear regression analysis was 
used to determine the trend in treatment over the study period; using the proportion of 
patients who received treatment at a certain year as a continuous variable as the outcome. 
Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) functions were estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier method within treatment groups. Log-rank tests were conducted to examine 
whether the unadjusted differences in survival between the groups were statistically 
significant. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed for OS 
and CSS, adjusting for patient’s age, sex, race, SES, stage, tumor size, and histology. 
Nominal logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship of predictor 
variables to treatment groups as the outcome variable, adjusting for significant covariates. 
Parallel analyses were performed for surgery subgroups. We considered p-values less than 
0.05 as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS for 
Windows, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Cary, NC).
Results
As shown in Table 1, we identified 34,016 patients diagnosed from 2004–2012 with Stage 
III or IV NSCLC. The majority of the patients were non-Hispanic white (65%), more than 
half were male, and patients were evenly distributed by SES category.

 Figure 1 shows 27% of patients received no treatment for NSCLC, and the percentage of 
patients receiving no treatment increased commensurate with stage (Table 2, p<0.0001). 
Chemoradiation was the next most common treatment (25.7%). Surgery alone or in 
combination with any other treatment was performed in 11% of the cohort in aggregate. The 
treatment groups were heterogeneous for age, sex, race, SES, and stage.
Frequency of Treatment Group Trend Analysis
For the entire cohort, there was a 0.6% increase in treatment with chemotherapy over time 
(p<0.001), but treatment with radiation alone, surgery alone, or surgery in combination with 
any other treatment modality decreased over the study period (Table 3). For patients with 
Stage IIIA disease, there was a significant increase in patients receiving no treatment and a 
significant decrease in patients receiving chemotherapy plus surgery (Figure 2A). Among 
patients with Stage IIIB disease, there was a significant increase in treatment with 
chemoradiation (Figure 2B). Treatment with surgery alone or in any combination 
significantly decreased as did the incidence of no treatment. For patients with Stage IV 
disease, there was no change in the incidence of no treatment whereas treatment with 
chemotherapy increased, and treatment with radiation alone or surgery alone or in any 
combination significantly decreased (Figure 2C).
For patients who had surgery in any combination, the frequency of lobectomy increased over 
the study (p=0.014) the frequency of bilobectomy/pneumonectomy decreased (p=0.039) 
(data not shown).
Survival Analysis
Survival, both OS and CSS, was significantly longer in all of the groups that included 
surgery (p<0.0001) (Figure 3) (data not shown for CSS). For the entire cohort, median OS 
was 40.7 months for patients treated with CS, 33.3 months for patients treated with CRS, 
28.8 months for patients treated with SURG, and 18.6 months for SurgRad. In the patients 
who did not have surgery, median OS was 11.9 months for CR, 10.5 months for Chemo, 3.7 
months for RAD and 2.1 months for NTx. Stage specific median OS is shown in Table 4. We 
observed the same pattern of longer OS in patients receiving surgery as part of their 
treatment across stages. On multivariate analysis, treatment group, age, sex, race, SES, 
stage, histology and tumor size were all significant predictors of OS and CSS (Table 5) (data 
not shown for CSS).
Predictors of treatment group
Multivariable nominal regression was performed with treatment group as the outcome 
variable to examine factors predictive of receipt of individual treatments (Table 6). With 
increasing age, patients were more likely to receive NTx versus CR, Chemo, Rad or any 
surgical treatment. When compared to the highest SES, patients in all other SES categories 
were significantly more likely to undergo NTx than CR, Chemo, Rad or any surgical 
treatment. Patients with Stage IIIB or IV disease were significantly more likely to undergo 
NTx than CR, Rad or any surgical treatment, compared to stage IIIa.

 Comment
We analyzed the patterns of treatment for advanced stage NSCLC and identified that 27% of 
advanced stage NSCLC in CA undergo NTx for their disease. Many factors impact the 
decision to undergo NTx and it is possible that because of under-reporting to the registry the 
size of this group may have been overestimated. Yet, disparities in receipt of therapeutic 
treatment have been observed in early stage NSCLC, so it is likely that disparities in access 
to care contributed to the high rates of NTx. The negative perceptions of lung cancer 
outcomes by patients and physicians may also influence the decision for NTx in our cohort.
Poor survival rates and stigma are associated with NSCLC and likely perpetuate themselves 
and impact treatment decisions for NTx. In a survey of primary care physicians, Wassenaar 
et al found significant differences in referral patterns and a lack of knowledge regarding 
treatment options and outcomes among in the primary care community regarding the 
benefits of treatment of NSCLC[17]. In a Swedish study of treatment trends of all stages of 
NSCLC, 33.4% of patients underwent no treatment and there were significant differences in 
treatment trends based on region of treatment[18]. These authors observed that increasing 
age was a significant predictor of not receiving treatment. Additionally, Hispanic and Black 
race were associated with increasing rates of no treatment, as was lower SES; suggesting 
that disparities of care may influence the number of patients receiving no treatment for 
NSCLC.
Racial disparities in the care of NSCLC patients are well established and have proven 
difficult to ameliorate. In a study of early-stage NSCLC patients in 1999, Bach et al 
demonstrated that lower survival rates in black patients could be attributed to lower rates of 
surgery in these patients[19]. Given that SES and race/ethnicity predicted no treatment in 
our analysis, our data suggest these racial disparities also affect outcomes in advanced stage 
NSCLC.
Overall MST was significantly longer for patients in any of the treatment groups that 
involved surgery. However, the incidence of surgery was low at 10.8% and decreased over 
time. In the NCDB, rates of surgery for stage IIIA disease range from 12–17% and from 12–
18.5% for stage IIIB disease [10,13]. These studies demonstrate increased survival in the 
surgical cohorts. It is highly likely that longer survival in the surgical cohorts represents 
selection bias for healthier patients with fewer comorbid conditions, but this is difficult to 
assess. A propensity-matched analysis of the stage IIIB NCDB patients, demonstrated longer 
survival in patients treated with CRS compared to CR (28.9 months vs 17.2 months, 
p<0.001) suggesting that the surgical survival advantage may not be solely due to selection 
bias and could represent a treatment effect [10].
It is interesting to speculate why the utilization of surgery is decreasing. It is possible that 
improved systemic therapies are changing initial treatment approaches, but some have 
suggested that favorable response to systemic therapy may make more patients eligible for 
surgery. n analysis of an Englishcancer registry demonstrated a similar decrease in the use of 
surgery for all stages of NSCLC from 1995–2006 [20]. These authors attributed the decrease 
in use of surgery to improvements in radiological staging, but this explanation would likely

 undermine our fundamental observation of an association of surgery with improved OS. It is 
possible that the decreased use of surgery over time in our study reflects changing referral 
patterns and a lackof surgical involvement in multidisciplinary treatment planning for these 
patients., There are limitations to this study. As with any registry analysis, we are unable to 
explain treatment decisions or the intent of the treatments administered. Chemotherapy data 
are known to be underreported to the CCR. It is possible that patients in the SurgRad group 
may have received chemotherapy, thereby explaining the high survival in that cohort. 
Additionally, only 20% of patients had lymph node sampling, which may reflect a 
significant understaging of NSCLC patients in the CCR.
The association of surgery with improved survival in advanced stage NSCLC is recognized 
by most thoracic surgeons, but it is unclear whether or not this association has been 
disseminated to other providers and disciplines involved in the care of NSCLC patients. 
Association clearly does not prove a causal relationship. It is important to assess all patients 
with NSCLC in a multidisciplinary context for possible surgical candidacy. There may be an 
opportunity to extend surgical intervention in advanced stage NSCLC to a larger proportion 
of appropriately selected patients, particularly those who are older, from lower SES groups, 
and from under-represented minority groups.
