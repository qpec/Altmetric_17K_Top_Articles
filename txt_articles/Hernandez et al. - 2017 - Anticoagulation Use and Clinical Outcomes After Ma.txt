A
nticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of stroke 
associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) by ≈60%.1 
Anticoagulation, however, is not free of risks, being an impor-
tant determinant of bleeding. The optimal management of AF 
patients who have experienced a major bleeding complica-
tion is uncertain because there are competing risks from both 
the resumption and the discontinuation of anticoagulation: 
although patients experiencing a major bleed are at increased 
risk of recurrent bleeding events,2 they are also at a high risk of 
thromboembolic events, if anticoagulation is not reinitiated.3–6 
The uncertainty surrounding decisions about the posthemor-
rhage use of anticoagulation is relevant from the clinical per-
spective, particularly, because patients who are at highest risk 
of bleeding are also at highest risk of stroke.2,7
Previous studies that examined the clinical outcomes of 
patients who resumed versus those who discontinued anti-
coagulation after a major bleed found that resumption of 
anticoagulation was associated with lower risk of thrombo-
embolic events, but higher risk of bleeding.3–6 Nevertheless, 
in comparing clinical outcomes between these 2 groups of 
patients, these studies did not account for the type of antico-
agulation agent used and used data that preceded the market 
entry of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.3–6 
With no requirement for routine coagulation assay monitor-
ing, and with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding, the thera-
peutic management and bleeding profile of the non-vitamin 
K antagonist oral anticoagulants are considerably different 
from those of warfarin.8 Consequently, the clinical outcomes 
associated with the resumption of anticoagulation after a 
major bleeding event may differ between patients reinitiat-
ing warfarin therapy and those reinitiating non-vitamin K 
antagonist oral anticoagulants. Therefore, it is important to 
separately evaluate the risks of stroke and recurrent bleeding 
among patients who resume anticoagulation with warfarin, 
Background and Purpose—Little is known about the clinical outcomes associated with posthemorrhage anticoagulation 
resumption for atrial fibrillation. This study had 2 objectives: first, to evaluate anticoagulation use after a first major bleed 
on warfarin or dabigatran and, second, to compare effectiveness and safety outcomes between patients discontinuing 
anticoagulation after a major bleed and patients restarting warfarin or dabigatran.
Methods—Using 2010 to 2012 Medicare Part D data, we identified atrial fibrillation patients who experienced a major 
bleeding event while using warfarin (n=1135) or dabigatran (n=404) and categorized them by their posthemorrhage 
use of anticoagulation. We followed them until an ischemic stroke, recurrent hemorrhage, or death through December 
31, 2012. We constructed logistic regression models to evaluate factors affecting anticoagulation resumption and Cox 
proportional hazard models to compare the combined risk of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality and the risk of 
recurrent bleeding between treatment groups.
Results—Resumption of anticoagulation with warfarin (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–
0.97) or dabigatran (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44–0.99) was associated with lower combined risk of ischemic stroke and 
all-cause mortality than anticoagulation discontinuation. The incidence of recurrent major bleeding was higher for 
patients prescribed warfarin after the event than for those prescribed dabigatran (HR 2.31; 95% CI 1.19–4.76) or whose 
anticoagulation ceased (HR 1.56; 95% CI 1.10–2.22), but did not differ between patients restarting dabigatran and those 
discontinuing anticoagulation (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.32–1.33).
Conclusions—Dabigatran was associated with a superior benefit/risk ratio than warfarin and anticoagulation discontinuation 
in the treatment of atrial fibrillation patients who have survived a major bleed.

those who reinitiate anticoagulation with the non-vitamin K 
antagonist oral anticoagulants, and those who discontinue all 
anticoagulation.
Therefore, our present analysis had 2 objectives: first, to 
evaluate the patterns of oral anticoagulation use after a major 
bleeding event on dabigatran or warfarin and to identify pre-
dictors for posthemorrhage resumption of oral anticoagula-
tion and, second, to compare the combined risk of ischemic 
stroke and all-cause mortality and the risk of recurrent bleed-
ing events between patients who resume anticoagulation with 
warfarin or dabigatran versus those whose anticoagulation is 
ceased.
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
We obtained 2010 to 2012 data for a 5% random sample of Medicare 
beneficiaries from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
First, we identified all patients who had a diagnosis of AF9 and filled 
a prescription for dabigatran or warfarin between October 19, 2010 
(date of dabigatran approval), and June 30, 2012 (Figure 1). To make 
sure that the warfarin group was representative of patients initiating 
warfarin and, hence, comparable to the dabigatran group, we excluded 
all individuals who had filled a prescription for warfarin during the 
6 months before October 19, 2010. We followed 10 059 dabigatran 
users and 79 714 warfarin users from the date of the first prescrip-
tion of dabigatran or warfarin after October 19, 2010, to December 
31, 2012, until the first of the following events: major bleeding, dis-
continuation of treatment, defined as a gap in treatment for over 60 
days,10 switch of anticoagulant, or death. Second, we selected those 
who experienced a major bleeding event that required hospitalization 
(index major hemorrhage) and identified those who were discharged 
alive. Third, we collected their prescriptions for oral anticoagulant 
agents filled after the date of the index major hemorrhage and catego-
rized them according to the oral anticoagulation agent used. Patients 
who filled a prescription for dabigatran or warfarin after the bleeding 
event were followed from the date of the first anticoagulant prescrip-
tion after index major hemorrhage (posthemorrhage follow-up start 
date) to December 31, 2012, or until the occurrence of a stroke, a 
recurrent bleeding event, or death. To set the posthemorrhage follow-
up start date for patients who never filled a prescription for an oral 
anticoagulant agent after the index major hemorrhage, we performed 
frequency matching. Further details on frequency matching can be 
found in Methods in the online-only Data Supplement. Patients who 
switched to rivaroxaban were not included in the study because of 
the small sample size of this treatment group (n=8 in the dabigatran 
cohort and n=9 in the warfarin cohort). This study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh as 
exempt.
Outcomes
Effectiveness outcomes included ischemic stroke, all-cause mortal-
ity, and the composite of ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. 
Ischemic stroke was defined as having one inpatient, emergency 
room, or outpatient claim with primary or secondary International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 433, 434, or 436.11,12 
Safety outcomes included recurrent major bleeding and any recur-
rent bleeding event (definitions in Methods in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Covariates
We evaluated how different demographic factors, clinical charac-
teristics, anatomic location, and severity of the index major hemor-
rhage affected the posthemorrhage use of oral anticoagulation. All 
covariates were measured at the time of the index major hemorrhage. 
Demographic characteristics included age, sex, race, and eligibility 
for Medicaid coverage. Clinical covariates included CHA2DS2-VASc 
score,7 HAS-BLED score,2 and several other Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services priority comorbidities. (CHA2DS2-Vasc 
score measures of the risk of stroke in patients with AF. To calculate 
CHA2DS2-Vasc, female sex, age between 65 and 74, congestive heart 
failure, hypertension history, vascular disease history and diabetes 
mellitus are assigned one point, and age of 75 or older and a history 
of previous stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism are 
assigned two points.7 HAS-BLED score is a prediction score of the 
risk of major bleeding for patients with AF on anticoagulation. In cal-
culating the HAS-BLED score, age of 65 or greater, labile INR, renal 
disease, liver disease, use of antiplatelet agents or of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, and a history of hypertension, stroke, major 
bleeding and alcohol or drug use are all assigned one point.2) Because 
Medicare claims data do not contain information on the international 
normalized ratio, we calculated the HAS-BLED score as the sum of 
all previous factors, except labile international normalized ratio. We 
categorized the anatomic location of the index major hemorrhage 
into 4 groups: intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 
genitourinary hemorrhage, and other bleeding events, which included 
hemoperitoneum, epistaxis, hemoptysis, hemarthrosis, conjunctival, 
and vaginal hemorrhage and not-otherwise-specified hemorrhage. 
Measures of the severity of the index major hemorrhage included 
length of inpatient stay, intensive care unit admission, and blood 
transfusion therapy and whether the patients underwent corrective 
procedures in the same anatomic area of the bleeding. The defini-
tions of covariates can be found in Methods in the online-only Data 
Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
We compared patient characteristics of 3 posthemorrhage treatment 
groups in each cohort at the time of index major hemorrhage using 
χ2 tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and analysis of variance, as appropriate. 
To predict the probability of restarting the same anticoagulation agent 
used before the index bleeding event or switching to another agent as 
opposed to discontinuing oral anticoagulation, we constructed a mul-
tinomial logistic regression model with generalized logit link function, 
where the outcome variable was the posthemorrhage treatment group, 
and covariates included all variables listed in the Covariates section.
Kaplan–Meier time-to-event curves were constructed to compare 
the cumulative incidence rates of effectiveness and safety outcomes 
at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year posthemorrhage follow-up among 
the posthemorrhage treatment groups. To further control for poten-
tial confounders in comparing effectiveness and safety outcomes, we 
constructed Cox Proportional Hazard models. Cox models built to 
compare effectiveness outcomes controlled for age, CHA2DS2-VASc 
score, HAS-BLED score, and an indicator variable for the location of 
the index major hemorrhage (1 if intracranial and 0 otherwise). Cox 
models built to compare safety outcomes controlled for CHA2DS2-
VASc, HAS-BLED score, an indicator variable for the location of 
the index major hemorrhage (1 if intracranial and 0 otherwise), and 
the measures of the severity of the index bleeding event, as detailed 
earlier. For all time-to-event analyses, time 0 was the posthemorrhage 
follow-up start date (defined in the Data Source and Study Population 
section). The time at risk was censored at the end of the study period 
(December 31, 2012) or at the time of death, except for the Kaplan–
Meier and Cox models, whose outcome included mortality. In those 
analyses, the time at risk was only censored at the end of the study 
period. All of these analyses were performed separately for the dabi-
gatran and the warfarin cohorts. In a secondary analysis, we grouped 
patients from the warfarin and dabigatran cohorts according to the 
treatment used after the index major hemorrhage and compared effec-
tiveness and safety outcomes using Cox models in a similar manner, 
as described earlier. All analyses were conducted with statistical soft-
ware SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).
Sensitivity Analysis

intracranial bleeding are likely to differ from those who bled on

other anatomic locations. To examine how this may have affected our 
results for the comparative risk of posthemorrhage clinical outcomes, 
we repeated our analysis after excluding patients who experienced an 
intracranial bleeding.
Results
Posthemorrhage Anticoagulation Use 
and Patient Characteristics
The proportion of patients who reinitiated anticoagulation 
after the index major hemorrhage was similar between the 
warfarin and dabigatran cohorts (49% for dabigatran and 
47% for warfarin; P value =0.497). However, dabigatran 
users were more likely to switch to warfarin after the bleed-
ing event than warfarin users were to switch to dabigatran 
(17% versus 2%; P value <0.001). In addition, resumption 
of the same oral anticoagulation agent used before the index 
major hemorrhage was more common in the warfarin cohort 
than in the dabigatran cohort (41% versus 28%, with P 
value <0.001). In the dabigatran cohort, the mean time from 
index bleeding to anticoagulation resumption was 45 days 
for patients who resumed dabigatran and 73 days for those 
who switched to warfarin (P value =0.005). In the warfarin 
cohort, the average time from index bleeding to anticoagula-
tion resumption was 60 days for patients who resumed war-
farin and 70 days for those who switched to dabigatran (P 
value =0.501). The average follow-up time for each group 
and cohort can be found in Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement.
Table shows how patient characteristics at baseline com-
pare among posthemorrhage treatment groups. Older patients 
were more likely to discontinue anticoagulation after the index 
hemorrhage in both cohorts. Specifically, the odds of resuming 
dabigatran or switching to warfarin compared with discontinu-
ing anticoagulation decreased by 24% (95% confidence inter-
val [CI] 9% to 37%) and 28% (95% CI 10% to 42%) for every 
5 years increase in age, respectively (Figure 2). In the warfarin 
cohort, patients who experienced an intracranial bleeding, were 
admitted to the intensive care unit, or received a blood transfu-
sion were more likely to cease anticoagulation (Figure 3).
Ischemic Stroke
Before adjustment, there was no difference in the risk of 
stroke among treatment groups in the 2 cohorts: the cumu-
lative incidence of ischemic stroke at 1 year was 0.20 (95% 
CI 0.12–0.29) for dabigatran users resuming dabigatran, 0.15 
(95% CI 0.08–0.21) for dabigatran users who discontinued 
anticoagulation, 0.21 (95% CI 0.10–0.32) for dabigatran users 
switching to warfarin, 0.17 (95% CI 0.13–0.21) for warfarin 
users resuming warfarin, 0.14(95% CI 0.11–0.18) for warfa-
rin users who discontinued anticoagulation, and 0.25 (95% CI 
0.06–0.44) for warfarin users switching to dabigatran (Table 
III in the online-only Data Supplement). After adjustment for 
potential confounders, the risk of ischemic stroke did not dif-
fer between patients who resumed dabigatran (hazard ratio 
[HR] 1.29; 95% CI 0.69–2.43) or switched to warfarin (HR 
1.29; 95% CI 0.63–2.65) and those who did not reinitiate

anticoagulation (Figure 4). In the warfarin cohort, similarly, 
the risk of ischemic stroke did not differ among treatment 
groups (HR 1.26; 95% CI 0.88–1.80 for resumption of war-
farin versus discontinuation of anticoagulation and HR 1.81; 
95% CI 0.72–4.53 for switching to dabigatran versus discon-
tinuation of anticoagulation). When the 2 cohorts were ana-
lyzed simultaneously based on the treatment received after 
the index hemorrhage, once again, there was no difference in 
the risk of ischemic stroke among posthemorrhage treatment 
groups.
Ischemic Stroke and All-Cause Mortality
The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality at 1 year was 
higher for patients who discontinued anticoagulation (0.13; 
95% CI 0.08–0.18 for patients on the dabigatran cohort and 
0.15; 95% CI 0.12–0.18 for patients on the warfarin cohort) 
than for those who restarted anticoagulation (0.02; 95% CI 
0.00–0.04 for dabigatran users resuming dabigatran and 
0.07; 95% CI 0.04–0.09 for warfarin users resuming war-
farin; Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). After 
adjustment for potential confounders, the risk of all-cause 
mortality was lower for patients on the dabigatran cohort 
who resumed dabigatran (HR 0.13; 95% CI 0.03–0.58) or 
switched to warfarin (HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.05–0.91) than for 
those who did not reinitiate anticoagulation (Figure 4). In 
the warfarin cohort, resumption of warfarin was associated 
with lower composite risk of ischemic stroke and all-cause 
mortality (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57–0.98) and lower risk of 
all-cause mortality (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23–0.55) than dis-
continuation of anticoagulation.
When the 2 cohorts were analyzed simultaneously based on 
the treatment received after the index hemorrhage, we found 
that the composite risk of ischemic stroke and all-cause mor-
tality was lower for patients who were prescribed warfarin

CHA2DS2-Vasc score measures of the risk of stroke in patients with AF. To calculate CHA2DS2-Vasc, female sex, age between 65 and 74, congestive heart failure, 
hypertension history, vascular disease history and diabetes mellitus are assigned one point, and age of 75 or older and a history of previous stroke, transient ischemic 
attack or thromboembolism are assigned two points.7 HAS-BLED score is a prediction score of the risk of major bleeding for patients with AF on anticoagulation. In 
calculating the HAS-BLED score, age of 65 or greater, labile INR, renal disease, liver disease, use of antiplatelet agents or of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 
a history of hypertension, stroke, major bleeding and alcohol or drug use are all assigned one point.2 CMS indicates Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; GI,

(HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59–0.97) or dabigatran (HR 0.66; 95% CI 
0.44–0.99) than for those whose anticoagulation was discon-
tinued after the major bleeding event. Furthermore, resump-
tion of anticoagulation with warfarin (HR 0.35; 95% CI 
0.23–0.53) or with dabigatran (HR 0.13; 95% CI 0.04–0.41) 
was associated with decreased mortality compared with dis-
continuation of anticoagulation.
Recurrent Bleeding
There were no differences in the unadjusted risk of bleeding 
events among posthemorrhage treatment groups in the dabi-
gatran cohort (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement): 
the cumulative incidence of major recurrent bleeding at 1 
year was 0.07 (95% CI 0.02–0.11) for dabigatran users who 
resumed dabigatran, 0.09 (95% CI 0.04–0.14) for those who 
discontinued anticoagulation, and 0.09 (95% CI 0.01–0.17) for 
those switching to warfarin. However, in the warfarin cohort, 
the unadjusted risk of recurrent major bleeding at 1 year was 
lower for patients who discontinued anticoagulation (0.10;95% 
CI 0.07–0.13) than for those who restarted warfarin after the 
index hemorrhage (0.17; 95% CI 0.13–0.21). These unadjusted 
results were consistent with the findings of the adjusted analy-
sis: the risks of major and any bleeding events were similar 
for 3 treatment groups in the dabigatran cohort (Figure 4). In 
the warfarin cohort, however, the risk of major bleeding was 
higher for patients resuming warfarin compared with those dis-
continuing all anticoagulation (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.09–2.36).
When the 2 cohorts were combined based on the treatment 
received after the index hemorrhage, we found that the risk 
of major hemorrhage was higher for patients who were pre-
scribed warfarin than for those who were prescribed dabiga-
tran or who discontinued anticoagulation therapy. Specifically, 
the HR of recurrent major bleeding was 0.42 (95% CI 0.21–
0.84) for dabigatran compared with warfarin and 1.59 (95%

patients who were prescribed dabigatran after the index hem-
orrhage and those whose anticoagulation was discontinued 
(HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.32–1.33).

Sensitivity Analyses
Our results for the HRs of posthemorrhage clinical outcomes 
were robust to the exclusion of patients who experienced an

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first real-world 
analysis comparing clinical outcomes after a major hemor-
rhage among patients who reinitiated anticoagulation therapy 
with dabigatran or warfarin and those who never resumed 
anticoagulation. Our study has 4 main findings: first, we found 
that posthemorrhage use of warfarin was more common than 
that of dabigatran in 2010 to 2012. Second, we observed that 
the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores did not affect the 
likelihood of reinitiating anticoagulation after a major bleed-
ing event. In contrast, age, anatomic location, and severity 
of the index bleeding event were the most important deter-
minants of resuming anticoagulation. Third, compared with 
discontinuation of all anticoagulation, resumption of antico-
agulation therapy with either dabigatran or warfarin was asso-
ciated with higher rates of survival and stroke-free survival. 
Fourth, the risk of recurrent major hemorrhage was higher 
for patients who were prescribed warfarin after a first major 
bleeding compared with those who were prescribed dabiga-
tran or those whose anticoagulation was never reinitiated.
Our estimate for the HR of all-cause mortality for patients 
who reinitiated warfarin compared with those who discontin-
ued anticoagulation (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23–0.53) is similar to 
the one reported by Staerk et al4 (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.34–0.46). 
Regardless of the consistency of these findings, the association 
of anticoagulation resumption with increased survival may be 
subject to residual confounding because patients who discon-
tinued anticoagulation had higher burden of disease than those 
who resumed anticoagulation. In our analyses, we controlled 
for CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores; however, these 
prediction tools do not distinguish the severity of the risk fac-
tors included in their calculation. Furthermore, conditions 
other than the ones included in the calculation of CHA2DS2-
VASc and HAS-BLED scores may have been unbalanced 
between patients who restarted anticoagulation and those who 
did not. Consequently, our results for the comparative risk of 
all-cause mortality between patients who reinitiated and those 
who discontinued anticoagulation should be interpreted with 
caution.
Study Implications
Our study contributes significantly to the existing literature 
because, as opposed to previous work, it stratified treatment 
groups into 2 cohorts according to the type of anticoagula-
tion agent used after the index bleeding event. In doing so, we 
demonstrate the benefit of the use of anticoagulation therapy 
after a major bleeding event. More specifically, we found 
that the resumption of anticoagulation therapy after a major 
hemorrhage was associated with a lower incidence of stroke 
and all-cause mortality than anticoagulation discontinua-
tion. In contrast, less than half of the patients who survived a 
major hemorrhage in 2010 to 2012 restarted anticoagulation,

The odds ratio for switching to dabigatran as opposed to interrupting anticoagulation for patients of other race compared with white 
patients could not be estimated because none of the patients belonging to other racial minorities switched to dabigatran after the index 
bleeding event. CHA2DS2-Vasc score measures of the risk of stroke in patients with AF
. To calculate CHA2DS2-Vasc, female sex, age 
between 65 and 74, congestive heart failure, hypertension history, vascular disease history and diabetes mellitus are assigned one point, 
and age of 75 or older and a history of previous stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism are assigned two points.7 HAS-
BLED score is a prediction score of the risk of major bleeding for patients with AF on anticoagulation. In calculating the HAS-BLED score, 
age of 65 or greater, labile INR, renal disease, liver disease, use of antiplatelet agents or of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and a 
history of hypertension, stroke, major bleeding and alcohol or drug use are all assigned one point.2 CMS indicates Centers for Medicare

which likely represents prescribers’ aversion to the perceived 
high risk of recurrent hemorrhage. However, in our study, 
we found that the risk of recurrent major bleeding was lower 
than the risk of ischemic stroke for all treatment groups 
and that the risk of recurrent major bleeding did not differ 
between treatment groups in the dabigatran cohort. These 
results should encourage clinicians to resume anticoagula-
tion among patients who survived a major bleeding event. 
When comparing outcomes associated with the resumption 
of warfarin and dabigatran, we found that the benefit/risk 
ratio of posthemorrhage dabigatran use is superior to that 
of warfarin because, with comparable effectiveness, dabiga-
tran was associated with lower rates of recurrent bleeding. In 
contrast, we observed that the use of dabigatran was substan-
tially less common than the use of warfarin among patients 
who survived a major bleeding event in 2010 to 2012. The 
lower tendency to prescribe dabigatran as compared with 
warfarin after a major hemorrhage in 2010 to 2012 may 
be explained by 2 reasons. First, although warfarin therapy 
requires routine international normalized ratio monitoring, 
laboratory coagulation markers are not routinely monitored 
for patients on dabigatran. In this context, clinicians may 
be under the impression that they have more control over 
the coagulation status of patients on warfarin than those on 
dabigatran, particularly in the early aftermath of a major 
bleeding event. Second, clinicians may have been especially 
risk-averse to prescribe dabigatran during our study period 
because of the warnings on the risk of severe bleeding with 
dabigatran released by the main international regulatory 
agencies throughout 2011, as well as the lack of antidote to 
reverse the anticoagulation effects of dabigatran in the time 
period that this study captures. In this scenario, patients 
who were prescribed dabigatran after the index hemorrhage 
were likely to be those at lowest risk of recurrent bleeding. 
These risk-averse prescription patterns of dabigatran may 
have introduced residual confounding in our results for the 
comparative risk of bleeding events with warfarin and dabi-
gatran. With the approval in October 2015 of idarucizumab, 
a dabigatran-binding monoclonal antibody fragment, pre-
scribers may become more comfortable using dabigatran in 
patients who have already suffered a major bleeding event 
on anticoagulation.13 Therefore, it will be important to repeat 
analyses similar to ours because newer Medicare Part D data 
that represents the period after the approval of idarucizumab 
become available.
Study Limitations
In addition to the fact that our results reflect the early experi-
ence with dabigatran, our study is subject to 3 main limita-
tions. First, claims data do not contain laboratory results and, 
therefore, we did not have information about the international 
normalized ratio levels of our study subjects, which may

have affected the decision to restart anticoagulation therapy 
in patients who bled on warfarin. Second, we did not stratify 
our analyses by the anatomic location of the index bleeding 
event. The posthemorrhage clinical outcomes of patients expe-
riencing an intracranial bleeding, for example, are likely to 
be different from those who presented with a gastrointestinal 
bleeding. Third, we did not stratify by the dose of dabigatran 
used. Nevertheless, the use of dabigatran 75 mg was relatively 
uncommon in the period that our study represents—<10% of 
Medicare beneficiaries with AF on dabigatran were prescribed 
dabigatran 75 mg in the first 2 years after dabigatran approval.14
Conclusions
In this observational study, the resumption of anticoagulation 
with either dabigatran or warfarin after a major bleeding event 
was associated with increased survival and stroke-free sur-
vival compared with discontinuing anticoagulation. In addi-
tion, dabigatran was associated with lower risk of recurrent 
hemorrhage than warfarin. Our findings suggest that the ben-
efit/risk ratio of dabigatran in the prevention of stroke among 
AF patients who have survived a major hemorrhage is supe-
rior to that of warfarin therapy or anticoagulation discontinu-
ation but will need to be validated in other patient cohorts and 
with more recent data.
