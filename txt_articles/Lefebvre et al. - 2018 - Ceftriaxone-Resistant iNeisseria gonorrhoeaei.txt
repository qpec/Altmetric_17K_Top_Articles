We identified a ceftriaxone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
isolate in a patient in Canada. This isolate carried the penA-
60 allele, which differs substantially from its closest relative, 
mosaic penA XXVII (80% nucleotide identity). Epidemio-
logic and genomic data suggest spread from Asia. Antimi-
crobial susceptibility surveillance helps prevent spread of 
highly resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains.
C
eftriaxone is one of the last remaining treatments 
available for gonorrhea and a component of the rec-
ommended dual therapy with azithromycin in Canada (1). 
As of October 15, 2017, only 5 ceftriaxone-resistant Neis-
seria gonorrhoeae isolates had been reported worldwide 
(MIC range 0.5–2 mg/L) (2–6). The highest ceftriaxone 
MIC reported in Canada was 0.25 mg/L, representing only 
0.45% (49/10,805) of all N. gonorrhoeae isolates tested 
during 2010‒2016 (7). We describe ceftriaxone-resistant N. 
gonorrhoeae isolated in Canada.
The Study
An asymptomatic 23-year-old woman had a positive N. 
gonorrhoeae nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) re-
sult (Cobas 4800 CTNG; Roche Diagnostics Canada, La-
val, Canada) on January 17, 2017, obtained as part of a 
screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Upon 
receiving the result, a physician instructed the patient 
to follow up with the STI clinic to have proper counsel-
ling. She visited on January 24 and obtained a prescrip-
tion of single-dose cefixime 800 mg and azithromycin 1 g 
 
(recommended therapy according to Québec STI Treat-
ment Guidelines) (8). Because the patient was from a low-
prevalence population, the healthcare provider decided to 
perform a genital gonorrhea culture. The culture was posi-
tive for N. gonorrhoeae (no. GC063564/47707), thus con-
firming the positive NAAT result.
Because antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Etest, 
bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) demonstrated non-
susceptibility of the isolate to ceftriaxone and cefixime but 
susceptibility to azithromycin, a second follow-up visit was 
requested by the practitioner. The second visit occurred 
February 7, 2017, and the patient was then prescribed em-
pirically a single 2-g dose of azithromycin. Tests of cure 
by NAAT and cervical culture were performed during this 
visit and were negative for N. gonorrhoeae, indicating a 
successful initial treatment with cefixime and azithromycin 
administered 14 days earlier.
The patient reported a month-long sexual relationship 
60 days before the STI screening. The partner was assessed 
by clinical examination and screening tests and treated with 
cefixime 800 mg and azithromycin 1 g on January 27, 2017. 
He was asymptomatic and his urinary NAAT screening 
result was negative for N. gonorrhoeae. He did not have 
sex with men or a sex worker but did report unprotected 
sexual activity during a trip to China and Thailand in No-
vember 2016, before his relationship with the patient in this 
case study. Information about antimicrobial drug use dur-
ing his trip to Asia was not available. He was followed up 
in February 2017, and NAAT test results of his urine and 
pharyngeal specimens were again both negative for gon-
orrhea. Public health professionals also contacted the case 
study patient’s next-to-last partner (5 months earlier), and 
his screening result was also negative for N. gonorrhoeae.
The bacterial isolate from our patient was confirmed 
to be N. gonorrhoeae by API NH (bioMérieux), VITEK 
(bioMérieux), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (bioMérieux), and whole-
genome sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibilities for iso-
late GC063564 were confirmed by using the agar dilution 
method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute protocol (9). The strain was resistant to ceftriaxone 
(MIC 1 mg/L), cefixime (MIC 2 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (MIC 
32 mg/L), and tetracycline (MIC 4 mg/L) and susceptible 
to azithromycin (MIC 0.5 mg/L). The Clinical and Labora-
tory Standards Institute does not have a resistance break-
point for cefixime or ceftriaxone but defines susceptibility

at an MIC <0.25 mg/L. The European Committee on An-
timicrobial Susceptibility Testing defines cefixime and 
ceftriaxone resistance at an MIC >0.125 mg/L (10), and 
the World Health Organization defines decreased suscep-
tibility to cefixime as MIC ≥0.25 mg/L and to ceftriaxone 
as MIC ≥0.125 mg/L (11). Although the defined resistance 
breakpoint is not consistent among these organizations, a 
ceftriaxone MIC 1 mg/L has been previously reported as 
resistance (2,6).
We performed molecular typing in silico using whole-
genome sequence data (BioProject PRJNA415047). We 
sequenced the isolate with the Illumina MiSeq platform (Il-
lumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and used genomic quality, 
assembly, and annotation pipelines as previously described 
(12). The multilocus sequence type (ST) of GC063564 was 
ST1903, and N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence type 
(MAST) was ST1614. Using a novel antimicrobial genom-
ic sequence analytic tool called NG-STAR (N. gonorrhoe-
ae Sequence Typing for Antimicrobial Resistance) (13), 
we identified the isolate GC063564 as NG-STAR ST233, 
which contains a mosaic penA allele, mtrR-35A deletion, 
porB G120K/A121D, ponA L421P, gyrA S91F/D94A, 
parC S87R, and no 23S rRNA A2059/C2611 mutations. 
The GC063564 isolate also had an rpsJ V57M mutation, 
and tetM was not detected.
The molecular antimicrobial resistance profile corre-
sponds to the MICs determined phenotypically (13). The 
multilocus sequence type (ST1903) and mosaic penA al-
lele (penA-60) of this isolate from Canada were identical 
to those of the ceftriaxone- and multidrug-resistant N. gon-
orrhoeae FC428 isolated in 2015 in Japan (14). PenA-60 
has a mosaic penicillin-binding protein 2 structure with 2 
key mutations (A311V and T483S) that confer ceftriaxone 
resistance. PenA-60 differs substantially from previously 
described penA types (5), resembling only 80% of the clos-
est-related mosaic allele penA-XXVII. Bacterial isolates 
GC063564 and FC428 had identical porB1b NG-MAST 
alleles but different tbpB alleles (GC063564 had tbpB-33; 
FC428 had tpbB-21), resulting in different N. gonorrhoeae 
MAST profiles (ST-1614 for GC063564 and ST-3435 for 
FC428). The variation in the N. gonorrhoeae MAST types 
between the 2 isolates collected 2 years apart is not unex-
pected, considering the highly recombinant nature of the N. 
gonorrhoeae genome (15).
Conclusions
We identified a ceftriaxone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae iso-
late in Canada that contained the penA-60 allele formerly 
reported in Japan in 2015. Epidemiologic information 
suggests international spread of a penA allele associ-
ated with high-level ceftriaxone resistance. Antimicro-
bial susceptibility surveillance successfully identified 
this novel isolate introduced into Canada and prompted 
public health officials to rapidly conduct an investiga-
tion to prevent further spread in the community. In an era 
of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea, ongoing antimicrobial 
susceptibility surveillance of N. gonorrhoeae is critical to 
support treatment guidelines, public health intervention, 
and protection.
