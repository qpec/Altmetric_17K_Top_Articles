Abstract
Regulatory T cells promote cancer by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. We found that 
anti-LAP antibody which targets the latency-associated peptide (LAP)/TGF-β complex on Tregs 
and other cells enhances anti-tumor immune responses and reduces tumor growth in models of 
melanoma, colorectal carcinoma and glioblastoma. Anti-LAP decreases LAP+ Tregs, tolerogenic 
dendritic cells and TGF-β secretion, and is associated with CD8+ T cell activation. Anti-LAP 
increases infiltration of tumors by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and reduces CD103+ CD8 T cells in 
dLNs and spleen. We identified a role for CD103+ CD8 T cells in cancer. Tumor-associated 
CD103+ CD8 T cells have a tolerogenic phenotype with increased expression of CTLA-4 and 
IL-10 and decreased expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and granzymes. Adoptive transfer of CD103+ 
CD8 T cells promotes tumor growth whereas CD103 blockade limits tumorigenesis. Thus, anti-
LAP targets multiple immunoregulatory pathways and represents a potential approach for cancer 
immunotherapy.

 INTRODUCTION
Classic CD4+ Tregs are identified by the intracellular marker Foxp3 (1, 2). However, 
targeting classic Tregs for treatment in humans is hampered by the expression of Foxp3 and 
surface Treg markers on activated cells. Other types of Tregs have also been described 
including Tr1 and Th3 cells (3, 4) although they are not as well understood or characterized 
as classic Foxp3+ Tregs. We have been interested in Tregs that express TGF-β on their 
surface complexed to latency-associated peptide (LAP), which identifies regulatory CD4+ T 
cells that have been described in the models of oral tolerance and autoimmunity (3, 5, 6) and 
are increased in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), LAP+ CD4 tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) are 50-fold more suppressive than FOXP3+ CD4 T cells. In head and 
neck cancer, LAP is up-regulated on FOXP3+ CD4 T lymphocytes (7). TGF-β is secreted in 
the tumor microenvironment by different cells and has an important role in dampening the 
anti-tumor immune response (8, 9). In cancer, TGF-β controls cell growth, induces 
angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion and promotes immune suppression (10). LAP and TGF-β 
are translated as one precursor polypeptide from the Tgfb1 gene and undergoes cleavage by 
furin, which separates the N-terminal LAP protein portion from TGF-β. TGF-β is then 
reassembled with LAP to form a small latent complex (SLC) that retains TGF-β in its 
inactive form on the cell surface. The SLC is then deposited on the cell surface bound to the 
LAP membrane receptor GARP or embedded in the extracellular matrix (11–13). We 
utilized anti-LAP antibodies that we developed (14) to investigate LAP targeting as cancer 
immunotherapy.
RESULTS
Anti-LAP monoclonal antibody decreases tumor growth in models of melanoma, 
glioblastoma and colorectal carcinoma
We utilized a mouse monoclonal anti-LAP antibody (14) in orthotopic and flank syngeneic 
tumor models. Anti-LAP reduced tumor growth in B16 melanoma (Fig. 1A) and in both 
intracranial (orthotopic) (Fig. 1B–E and fig. S1A) and sub-cutaneous (Fig. 1F and G) 
glioblastoma (GL261) models. Anti-LAP also affected established B16 tumors (fig. S1B). In 
glioblastoma, an early therapeutic effect was observed as only rare tumor cells were 
observed at two weeks whereas all control mice developed solid tumors by this time (Fig. 
1H and fig. S1C). In CRC, anti-LAP reduced tumor number in the azoxymethane (AOM)/
Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt (DSS) orthotopic model of spontaneously induced CRC, (Fig. 
1I, J and fig. S1D and E) and in two sub-cutaneous CRC models, MC38 and CT26 (Fig. 1K–
M). We employed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset to study the relationship 
between the expression of the LAP/TGF-β encoding gene, TGFB1, and its associated genes 
(THBS1/TSP-1, LRRC32/GARP, HSPA5/GRP78, and LTBP1/2) with cancer patient 
survival. We found that the relatively high expression of these genes based on z score was 
associated with poorer patient survival (Fig. 1N and fig. S2).
Anti-LAP decreases LAP+ CD4 T cells and blocks the release of TGF-β
Potential mechanisms of anti-LAP effects include reduction of LAP+ T cells and/or 
blocking TGF-β release from the small latent complex (fig. S3A). Increased numbers of

 splenic LAP+ T cells in animals with B16 melanoma were reduced following anti-LAP 
treatment (Fig. 2A, fig. S3B, and S3C) as were the frequency of LAP+ T cells in the tumor 
and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) (Fig. 2A). Different non-competing antibodies were used 
for anti-LAP treatment (clone TW7-28G11) and for measuring LAP+ cells (clone 
TW7-16B4) (fig. S3D). To determine whether anti-LAP blocked release of membrane bound 
TGF-β we utilized P3U1 cells that over-express the Tgfb1 gene and secrete TGF-β when 
LAP is activated. Both 16B4 and 28G11 anti-LAP clones reduced the release of TGF-β 
(Fig. 2B). Thus, anti-LAP decreases LAP+ cells and blocks TGF-β release from the cell.
LAP+ CD4 T cells from tumor-bearing mice have suppressive properties
We measured markers associated with Tregs (Foxp3), exhausted T cells (Lag3, PD1, PD-L1, 
Tim3) and CD103 in TILs from B16 melanoma mice on both LAP+ and LAP− T cells. 
Expression of these markers was increased on LAP+ vs. LAP− T cells (Fig. 2C and fig. 
S3E). A similar tolerogenic phenotype was observed for LAP+ Tregs from dLNs and 
spleens of tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 2C, fig. S3F and S3G). We also measured gene 
expression and found that cancer-associated genes, including Lag3, Tigit, and Vcam were 
expressed at higher levels in LAP+ vs. LAP− T cells (Fig. 2D and fig. S4A). Interestingly, 
Irf4 that has been shown to promote effector function of Tregs (15) was also overexpressed 
in LAP+ T cells (fig. S4A). Using the Nanostring Pan Cancer Immunology code set, we 
found 480 genes differentially expressed between B16 melanoma and control mice (Fig. 
2E). Among them, genes associated with effector Treg function, such as Aire, Gata3, Irf4, 
Foxp3, Stat3, Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Entpd1 (CD39), Itgae (CD103), Il10, Gzma, Gzmb and cancer-
associated T cell markers, such as Havcr2 (Tim3), Ctla4, Tigit, and Lag3 were expressed at a 
higher level in LAP+ T cells in naïve mice. These genes were further upregulated on LAP+ 
T cells in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 2E). On the other hand, genes associated with T cell 
activation, including Il6ra, Pin1 and Mapk14 were downregulated in LAP+ T cells in tumor-
bearing mice (Fig. 2E).
Since Foxp3 is a marker of Tregs in mice, we analyzed the relationship between LAP and 
Foxp3 in B16 tumor-bearing mice. We performed principle component analysis (PCA) on 
the Nanostring-based gene expression data in LAP+/−Foxp3+/− CD4 T cell subsets. We 
found that PC1 was associated with the variance between Foxp3+/− generated datasets, 
whereas PC2 was associated with the variance between LAP+/− generated datasets. Thus, in 
addition to the differences between Foxp3+/−, we found LAP+ T cell subsets clustered 
differently from LAP− T cells in both Treg and non-Treg CD4 populations (fig. S4B). We 
analyzed the distribution of LAP+/−Foxp3+/− T cell subsets in vivo and found that most 
LAP+ T cells were Foxp3+ both in the periphery and in the tumor (fig. S4C). LAP+ T cells 
from both dLNs and spleens of tumor-bearing mice reduced the proliferation of responder 
CD4+ T cells in vitro (Fig. 2F and 2G). Blocking TGF-β signaling with either TGF-β 
receptor inhibitor or anti-TGF-β mAb (Fig. 2G) reduced the suppression, indicating that 
LAP+ T cells suppressed in vitro through a TGF-β-dependent mechanism.
Anti-LAP treatment modulates dendritic cell subsets in the spleen
Antigen-presenting cells play a key role in anti-tumor immunity. Since anti-LAP blocks the 
secretion of TGF-β which is known to interfere with the maturation of splenic antigen-

 presenting cells (16), we investigated anti-LAP on dendritic cells (DCs) in the spleen in the 
B16 melanoma model. We measured CD11c-Hi/CD11b-Int (subsequently referred to as 
CD11c-Hi) and CD11c-Int/CD11b-Hi (CD11c-Int) cell subsets. CD11c-Hi cells were 
increased following anti-LAP whereas CD11c-Int cells were reduced (Fig. 3A and 3B). We 
also measured splenic DCs in the GBM model and observed a similar effect (fig. S5A and 
S5B). In GBM, tumors grow slowly and the effect of anti-LAP on splenic CD11c/CD11b 
DCs in GBM was observed with long-term anti-LAP treatment (>3 weeks). CD11c-Int cells 
express higher levels of LAP vs. CD11c-Hi cells (Fig. 3C and fig. S5C), which suggests that 
the CD11c-Int cells are more tolerogenic. Because the function of these two DC subsets is 
not well defined, we characterized their inflammatory properties. We found that both MHCII 
and CD86 were expressed at higher levels on CD11c-Hi vs. CD11c-Int cells (Fig. 3D and 
fig. S5D). We then sorted these two DC subsets, stimulated them with LPS or anti-CD40 and 
measured cytokine expression. We found that Il10 was expressed at higher levels and Il12 at 
lower levels in the CD11c-Int subset (Fig. 3E), indicating a more tolerogenic phenotype as 
compared to CD11c-Hi cells. To determine whether these DC subsets affected CD8 T cells, 
we co-cultured them with labeled CD8+ naïve T cells and measured cytokine secretion and 
growth. We found increased expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α in cells co-cultured with the 
CD11c-Hi subset (Fig. 3F) demonstrating that CD11c-Hi cells promote an effector 
phenotype in CD8+ cells. Furthermore, CD11c-Hi cells supported CD8+ T cell survival to a 
greater extent than the CD11c-Int subset (Fig. 3G and fig. S5E). Finally, we found that anti-
LAP treatment decreased LAP+ CD11c-Int cells (Fig. 3H and fig. S5F) and reduced the 
expression of the tolerance-associated proteins PD-L1 and CD103 on CD11c-Int cells (Fig. 
3I and fig. S5G). This is presumably secondary to a reduction of TGF-β by anti-LAP (Fig. 
2B), since both genes could be up-regulated by TGF-β (17, 18). Thus, anti-LAP increased 
dendritic cells with a pro-inflammatory phenotype and decreased DCs with an anti-
inflammatory phenotype in the spleen. We found that membrane LAP expression was 
reduced on CD11c+ cells in spleen, dLN and tumor after anti-LAP treatment (Fig. 3J and 
fig. S5H) indicating that anti-LAP may also affect DCs in the tumor microenvironment. Of 
note, we did not identify CD11c/CD11b subsets in dLN or tumor (fig. S5I).
Anti-LAP treatment enhances anti-tumor adaptive immune responses
To test whether CD8+ T cells were required for the therapeutic effect of anti-LAP, we 
implanted the B16 melanoma in CD8-deficient mice. and found that the therapeutic effect of 
anti-LAP was abolished (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this, the therapeutic effect of anti-LAP 
was also reversed in animals treated with anti-CD8 (fig. S6A). No difference was observed 
in CD4-deficient mice (fig. S6B). When we analyzed TILs from mice implanted with the 
B16 melanoma, we found an increase in infiltrating CD8+ T cells following anti-LAP 
whereas CD4+ T cells did not change (Fig. 4B and fig. S6C). Similar results were observed 
in the intracranial GBM model (fig. S6D). Intratumoral CD8+ T cells expressed higher 
levels of the proliferation marker Ki67, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and the 
degranulation marker CD107 (Fig. 4B and fig. S6E). Anti-LAP treatment also increased the 
ratio of CD8+ T cells to Foxp3+ Tregs in the tumor in both B16 melanoma and intracranial 
GL261 GBM models (Fig. 4B, fig. S6E and S6F). We then examined the dLNs and spleen of 
B16 melanoma-bearing mice. In dLN, anti-LAP enhanced the proliferation of CD8+ T cells, 
increased the levels of TNF-α in CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, and increased NK cells

 and the levels of granzyme B they express (Fig. 4C and fig. S6G). In the spleen, we observed 
higher levels of granzyme B, CD107 and ICOS on CD8+ T cells after anti-LAP treatment, 
demonstrating a stronger effector phenotype of cytotoxic T cells following treatment. In 
addition, the frequency of NK cells and the expression of granzyme B by NK cells were 
increased. Furthermore, the CD44 activation marker was up-regulated on CD4+ T cells (Fig. 
4D and fig. S6H). Of note, the percentage of LAP+ CD8 T cells was very low in the spleen, 
dLN and tumor and did not change with anti-LAP treatment (fig. S6I and S6J) suggesting 
that these cells do not play a significant role in the anti-tumor effect of anti-LAP. Taken 
together, these results demonstrate that anti-LAP affects adaptive immune responses both 
systemically and within the tumor driving them to a more inflammatory phenotype.
Anti-LAP treatment affects tolerogenic CD103+ CD8 T cells
We consistently found a reduction of CD103+ CD8 T cells in both the spleen and dLNs 
following anti-LAP treatment (Fig. 5A). TGF-β plays an important role in the induction of 
CD103+ CD8 T cells (19), which may explain why anti-LAP reduces their number. Because 
the frequency of infiltrating CD103+ CD8 T cells in B16 tumors was very low (fig. S7A and 
S7B), we focused on CD103+ CD8 T cells in the periphery. We measured gene expression 
in CD103+ and CD103− CD8 T cells from the dLNs and spleen of naïve and B16 
melanoma-bearing mice using the Nanostring Pan Cancer Immunology code set. We found 
171 differentially expressed genes between groups (Fig. 5B), among them, activation and 
effector markers, including Cd44, Gzma, Gzmm, Gzmk, Il2rb, Prdm1, Il18r1, Tbx21, 
Eomes, and Ccr2; these genes were specifically overexpressed in CD103− CD8 T cells in 
naïve mice and were further upregulated in tumor-bearing mice. On the other hand, negative 
regulators of T cell activation including Egr3, Ctla4, and Tgfbr2 were higher in CD103+ 
CD8 T cells. Importantly, the Treg associated genes Il2ra, Foxp3, and Rorc (20–22) were up-
regulated in CD103+ CD8 T cells in tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, tumor suppressor 
genes, such as Erg1 and Rrad, were down-regulated in CD103+ cells from tumor-bearing 
mice vs. naïve mice, whereas oncogenes, such as Plaur and Vcam were up-regulated, 
suggesting that the tumor itself may further modulate the CD103+ T cell subset. Of note, in 
the intracranial GBM model, CD103+ CD8 T cells infiltrate the tumor and anti-LAP 
reduced these cells both in the tumor and systemically (fig. S7C).
To further investigate CD103+ and CD103− CD8 T cell subsets in naïve vs. tumor 
conditions, we performed a PCA analysis on the global gene signature and found differential 
clustering of CD103+ vs. CD103− CD8 T cell subsets in both naïve and tumor conditions 
(Fig. 5C). PC1 mainly accounts for the variance between CD103+/− generated datasets, 
whereas PC2 accounts for the variance between tumor/naive generated datasets. Thus, 
CD103+ marks a CD8 T cell population that is different both in naïve mice as well as under 
tumor conditions. We then measured protein expression of activation markers IFN-γ, TNF-
α, GzmA, CD44, Eomes, IL18R, IL2RB, IL2, CD107, and Ly6C on CD103+ vs. CD103− 
CD8 T cells in spleen and dLNs of melanoma-bearing mice. We found that CD103+ CD8 
cells expressed lower levels of these markers (Fig. 5D, fig. S7D and S7E). KLRG1 was also 
decreased on CD103+ CD8 T cells. On the other hand, IL-10, CTLA4, and CD25/IL2RA 
were up-regulated on CD103+ CD8 T cells from dLNs consistent with the regulatory 
phenotype of CD103+ CD8 T cells. We then found that CD103+ CD8 T cells isolated from

 either B16-bearing mice or naïve mice suppressed CD8+ T cell proliferation (Fig. 5E and 
5F). Suppression was mediated by the PD1/PD-L1 axis as it was blocked by anti-PD1 or 
anti-PD-L1 antibodies (fig. S7F). Consistent with this, CD103+ CD8 T cells expressed 
higher level of PD-L1 then CD103− CD8 T cells (fig. S7G and S7H). Of note, anti-PD1 and 
anti-LAP antibodies had comparable effects on B16 tumor growth (fig. S7I). We then 
examined the in vivo tumor-promoting role of CD103+ CD8 T cells by adoptively 
transferring CD103+ or CD103− CD8 T cells from B16 melanoma-bearing mice to CD8-
deficient animals. We found greater tumor growth in animals that received CD103+ CD8 T 
cells and smaller tumor growth in animals that received CD103− CD8 T cells (Fig. 6A and 
fig. S8A). Co-transfer of CD103+/CD103− CD8 T cells increased tumor growth compared 
to the transfer of CD103− CD8 T cells alone. Without T cell transfer (PBS group) there was 
greater tumor growth compared to all the CD8+ T cell transfer groups demonstrating that 
CD8+ T cells control tumor growth. The increased tumor growth that we observed in the 
PBS group as compared to the CD103+ CD8 T cell group could be explained by the stability 
of CD103+ CD8 T cells after adoptive transfer: only 40% of cells remain CD103+ CD8 T 
cells (Fig. 6B).
We isolated these cells at the end of the experiment and found they maintained expression of 
CD103 and lower levels of pro-inflammatory genes (Fig. 6B and fig. S8B). We observed a 
similar effect when CD103+ or CD103− CD8 T cells were adoptively transferred from 
untreated mice (fig. S8C). To further investigate the role of CD103 we treated B16 
melanoma and MC38 CRC-bearing mice with anti-CD103 antibody, which primarily targets 
CD103+ CD8 T cells (fig. S8D). We found that anti-CD103 treatment reduced tumor growth 
(Fig. 6C and fig. S8E) and was associated with reduction of CD103+ CD8 T cells (Fig. 6D). 
We then asked whether combined targeting of CD103 and LAP would have a synergistic 
effect; we treated tumor-bearing mice simultaneously with anti-CD103 plus anti-LAP. We 
did not observe a decrease of B16 tumor growth as compared to single antibody treatment 
with either anti-CD103 or anti-LAP (Fig. 6E). Consistent with our findings, in patients with 
both high and low grade gliomas, high CD103 expression was associated with shorter 
survival (Fig. 6F). Of note, CD103 is also expressed on CD4+ Tregs, which can contribute to 
a poorer prognosis. To address the potential role of LAP on CD103+ CD8 T cell function, 
we examined surface LAP expression and found that the frequency of LAP+CD103+ CD8 T 
cells was very low and there was no increased LAP expression on CD103+ vs. CD103− 
CD8 T cells (fig. S8F).
Anti-LAP treatment combined with antigen specific vaccination enhances tumor 
immunotherapy and improves immune memory
Because anti-LAP enhances the maturation of antigen presenting cells, we investigated 
combining anti-LAP with antigen-specific vaccination. We employed B16 melanoma cells 
that express ovalbumin (B16-OVA) and treatment with DCs loaded with ovalbumin (Fig. 
7A). In this model, ovalbumin serves as a tumor-associated antigen. One week following 
vaccination with OVA-loaded DCs, mice were implanted with B16-OVA and treated with 
anti-LAP every third day. No mice vaccinated and treated with anti-LAP developed tumors 
whereas 60% of mice treated with IC and all mice in control group developed tumors (Fig. 
7B). We then asked whether anti-LAP affected immune memory following DC vaccination.

 We used a series of markers for activation and memory of CD8+ T cells including IL7R, 
KLRG1, CCR7, and CD62L. Based on previously reported CD8+ T cell memory markers 
(23–25), we found an increase of effector memory-like CD8+ T cells in dLNs of anti-LAP 
treated mice (Fig. 7C–G and fig. S9A). Consistent with our results above, IL7R+CD103− 
CD8 T cells were increased in mice treated with anti-LAP (Fig. 7H and fig. S9B).
We also investigated the intracranial GBM model in which glioma cells expressing 
ovalbumin (GL261-OVA) were implanted (Fig. 7I). One week following vaccination with 
OVA-loaded DCs, mice were implanted with GL261-OVA and treated with anti-LAP. 
Disease onset was delayed and, based on MRI imaging, none of anti-LAP treated mice 
developed tumors (Fig. 7J and K). On day 114, we re-challenged mice that did not develop 
tumors by implanting GL261-OVA subcutaneously and followed them for an additional 
month. None of these mice developed tumors, indicating that they had developed antigen 
specific immunity against the tumor. We investigated the immune response against OVA in 
surviving mice and found that anti-LAP treated mice developed increased numbers of both 
OVA-specific CD8 cells (Fig. 7L) and memory cells as measured by IL-7R and CD62L 
markers (Fig. 7M and 7N). To investigate the contribution of anti-LAP to immune memory 
we vaccinated mice with DCs loaded with OVA and treated them with anti-LAP for 4 weeks 
(Fig. 7O). A month later, we re-challenged the mice with a small number of subcutaneously 
injected GL261-OVA cells. Two months later, we analyzed CD8+ T cells and found specific 
up-regulation of IL7R+CD44+ CD8 T cells in anti-LAP treated mice (Fig. 7P and fig. S9C) 
indicating that anti-LAP supports anti-tumor memory. Thus, combination therapy with anti-
LAP improved the immune response to antigen-specific DC vaccination and enhanced 
immune memory.
Discussion
Although targeting Tregs is an important avenue to boost tumor immunity, this approach has 
been limited due to a lack of drugable Treg targets and lack of specificity for Tregs (26, 27). 
We found that targeting LAP may be an effective way to affect Tregs and boost tumor 
immunity since the LAP/TGF-β complex identifies a subset of highly suppressive Tregs that 
are up-regulated in human malignancies (7, 28, 29). Consistent with multiple roles of TGF-
β, we found increased CTL responses, reduction of tolerogenic CD103+ CD8 T cells, 
activation of NK cells, maturation of DCs and improved immune memory following anti-
LAP treatment. In humans, LAP+Foxp3+ T cells are more suppressive than LAP-Foxp3+ T 
cells (28). Consistent with this, anti-LAP did not affect Foxp3+ T cell numbers in our 
studies. Foxp3 can also be transiently expressed on activated effector T cells in humans (30) 
and the accumulation of a Foxp3-lo population, represented by non-Treg cells, correlates 
with better survival of CRC patients than Foxp3-hi cells (31). These studies may explain 
different roles of Tregs in CRC reported by investigators.
We found that CD103+ CD8 T cells have a tolerogenic immune profile, exhibit suppressive 
properties and have a tumor-promoting role in vivo as compared to CD103− CD8 T cells. 
Anti-LAP treatment reduced CD103+ CD8 T cells, presumably because it decreases 
bioavailable TGF-β, which regulates the generation of CD103+ CD8 T cells (18, 32, 33). 
Indeed, TGF-β has been demonstrated to regulate the generation of CD103+ CD8 T cells

 (18, 32, 33). Furthermore, we found that direct targeting of CD103 by an anti-CD103 
antibody that reduces CD103+ CD8 T cells in mice similar to what we observed with anti-
LAP also had a therapeutic effect in the B16 melanoma and MC38 CRC models. Anti-
CD103 antibody appears to act systemically in the B16 melanoma model as only a few 
CD103+ CD8 T cells infiltrate the tumor in this model. Interestingly, combinatorial 
treatment with anti-LAP and anti-CD103 did not result in a synergistic therapeutic effect 
indicating that LAP and CD103 pathways overlap. A previous study of anti-CD103 did not 
show a therapeutic effect in the CT26 model of CRC (34). Different roles for CD103+ CD8 
T cells have been reported. Some studies report increased effector function against cancer 
cells (19, 32, 35, 36) whereas others demonstrate that CD103+ CD8 T cells could be 
regulatory in transplantation models and autoimmunity (37–41). Our study supports these 
later observations and extends them to cancer. It is possible that CD103+ CD8 T cells kill 
cancer cells in the tumor environment while suppressing T cell growth systemically. Of note, 
CD103 has been described as a marker of CD4+ regulatory cells and is present on 
tolerogenic DCs (2, 34, 42–44).
LAP is not only expressed on CD4+ T cells but also on CD8 cells, γδ T cells, NK cells, B 
cells and DCs (45–48). Thus, the anti-tumor effect of anti-LAP could be related to multiple 
targets. Dendritic cells play a key role in tumor antigen-specific vaccination and we found 
that anti-LAP plus DC vaccination enhanced the anti-tumor effects of DC vaccination. 
Interestingly, immature DCs express higher levels of LAP and we found that LAP+ DCs in 
humans have suppressive properties (45).
Although we demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of anti-LAP antibody in a range of 
models, it is known that models do not always predict responses in humans. Furthermore, 
the subcutaneous models we studied do not mimic the natural tumor environment in humans. 
Nonetheless, LAP+ cells are increased in human cancer, possess tolerogenic function, and 
predict a poor prognosis in human cancer (7, 28, 29). Thus, despite the limitations of animal 
models, targeting LAP+ cells is consistent with the importance of TGF-β, and Tregs in the 
physiology of cancer in humans.
In summary, in addition to targeting Tregs, our results demonstrate a more complex process 
as anti-LAP also modulates DCs that express surface LAP, blocks TGF-β and decreases 
tolerogenic CD103+ CD8 T cells (fig. S10). Anti-LAP acts on multiple populations to 
promote anti-tumor immunity by increasing the activity of CD8+ T effector cells and 
enhancing immune memory. Consistent with our findings, LAP and CD103 expression in 
human cancer is associated with a poorer prognosis, providing an important translational 
link between our results and human disease and making anti-LAP an attractive candidate for 
cancer immunotherapy.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
Our objective was to investigate the therapeutic effect of anti-LAP antibody in models of 
cancer and characterize its effect on immune function. We used mice and primary cells and 
cell lines to address immunologic mechanism. Cages were randomly assigned to different

 treatment groups. Tumor size and weight loss were the major factors for ending data 
collection. All data were included in analysis, though in rare situations, clear outliers were 
excluded. Experimental replication is indicated in the figure legends. Although the study 
was not blinded, some in vivo experiments were performed independently by investigators in 
other laboratories. Data were collected using methods that provide numerical values 
(calipers, scales, bioluminescence imaging for tumor size measurement; flow cytometer for 
assessing protein expression or cell proliferation, real-time PCR instrument and nSolver 
digital analyzer for mRNA expression measurement). Animal pre-clinical studies were 
reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.
Animals
C57BL/6, BALB/c, CD4 (B6.129S2-Cd4tm1Mak/J) and CD8 (B6.129S2-Cd8atm1Mak/J)-
deficient 6–8 week male mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. Foxp3-GFP 
reporter mice were housed in a conventional specific pathogen-free facility at the Harvard 
Institutes of Medicine. All experiments were carried out in accordance with guidelines 
prescribed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Harvard Medical School.
Antibody Treatments
Mice were treated with either anti-LAP or IC mAbs prepared in PBS. Mouse anti-LAP 
monoclonal antibodies were isolated from hybridoma generated in-house. Two clones were 
employed for in vivo treatments: TW7-28G11 (IgG2b) and TW7-16B4 (IgG1). Respective 
ICs, MPC-11 (IgG2b) and MOPC-21 (IgG1), anti-CD103 (clone M290) and anti-PD1 
(RMP-1) were purchased from BioXCell. As a standard treatment, antibodies were 
administered intraperitoneallly, 10 mg/kg every third day following tumor implantation. In 
some experiments, mice were treated i.p. with 100 μg per mouse of anti-CD8β (clone 
Lyt-3.2; BioXCell) Ab or IC (rat IgG1, HRPN; BioXCell) on days –1, 7, and 14 after 
B16F10 implantation.
Statistical analysis
Two sample t-test was used to compare two groups, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s 
adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to compare more than two groups, and two-
way ANOVA was used to compare two and more groups over time. Survival curves were 
compared using a log-rank test. Two-sided alpha level of 0.05 was used for all tests. 
Analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0a. Details of each analysis are 
included in the source data in supplementary materials.

melanoma cells and treated with either anti-LAP or IC antibodies (n=5 (CD8KO/anti-LAP 
and WT/anti-LAP) and n=4 (CD8KO/IC and WT/IC)). Data are representative of two 
independent experiments. (B–D) Analysis of the immune response in tumor (B), dLN (C) 
and spleen (D) of B16 tumor-bearing mice by flow cytometry (n=4). Data are representative 
of two independent experiments. Error bars, mean±s.e.m. Two-way ANOVA (A) and two-
tailed t-test (B–D) were used for p value calculations. P values for the last time point are 
shown.

from either naïve or B16 tumor-bearing mice (n=3). (C) PCA analysis of the global gene 
expression profiles shown in (B). (D) Phenotypic characterization of CD103+ and CD103− 
CD8 T cells in dLNs and spleen of B16 melanoma-bearing mice by flow cytometry (n=3–5; 
data are combined from two independent experiments). (E, F) In vitro suppression of naïve 
CD8+ T cell proliferation by CD103+ CD8 T cells isolated from naïve or melanoma-bearing 
mice. (E) Representative histograms of proliferation of responder CD8+ T cells and (F)
