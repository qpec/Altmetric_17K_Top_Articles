In patients with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease 1A (CMT1A), peripheral nerves display
aberrant myelination during postnatal development, followed by slowly progressive demye-
lination and axonal loss during adult life. Here, we show that myelinating Schwann cells in a
rat model of CMT1A exhibit a developmental defect that includes reduced transcription of
genes required for myelin lipid biosynthesis. Consequently, lipid incorporation into myelin is
reduced, leading to an overall distorted stoichiometry of myelin proteins and lipids with
ultrastructural changes of the myelin sheath. Substitution of phosphatidylcholine and
phosphatidylethanolamine in the diet is sufficient to overcome the myelination deficit of
affected Schwann cells in vivo. This treatment rescues the number of myelinated axons in
the peripheral nerves of the CMT rats and leads to a marked amelioration of neuropathic
symptoms. We propose that lipid supplementation is an easily translatable potential
therapeutic approach in CMT1A and possibly other dysmyelinating neuropathies.

yelination of axons is essential for rapid impulse pro-
pagation and is made by Schwann cells in the periph-
eral nervous system1. Myelin or Schwann cell defects
underlie a group of common neurological disorders referred to as
demyelinating polyneuropathies (PNP)2. Charcot–Marie–Tooth
disease 1A (CMT1A) is the most frequently inherited demyeli-
nating PNP caused by the duplication of the gene encoding the
peripheral myelin protein of 22kDA (PMP22), an integral
transmembrane protein of the myelin sheath3,4. The disease is
characterized by a slowly progressive nature, and affected patients
suffer from a distally pronounced muscle weakness as well as
from sensory symptoms. Most patients seek medical advice in the
second decade of life5, but first symptoms such as a mild walking
disability are already present in childhood6. In line with the early
onset, nerve biopsies from children with CMT1A disease7 as well
as the analysis of a genuine CMT1A animal model demonstrate a
pronounced dysmyelination early postnatally8. We previously
used a CMT1A rat model, which closely mimics the human
disease9, to examine peripheral nerve development and could
show that Pmp22 transgenic Schwann cells show a strong delay in
myelination, with many fibers remaining unmyelinated until
adulthood8. Consequently, the pool of functional, myelinated
axons in CMT1A is markedly reduced throughout life. These
pathologically unmyelinated fibers degenerate with time, sug-
gesting that improving myelination would also rescue axon sur-
vival8. However, it has been mysterious how altered Schwann cell
differentiation links mechanistically to reduced myelination in
CMT1A8,10,11.
Schwann cell lipid metabolism was a plausible missing link in
CMT1A pathogenesis, as myelin lipids are important for both,
myelin membrane growth and long-term integrity. Lipids account
for about 70% of the myelin membrane, with phospholipids,
cholesterol, and glycosphingolipids being most abundant, com-
prising 50.6%, 27.2%, and 17%, respectively, of the total lipids in
the purified myelin12. Importantly, the de novo synthesis of
cholesterol by Schwann cells is rate limiting for myelin biogenesis,
as demonstrated by mouse mutants with disturbed cholesterol
biosynthesis13,14. In contrast, mouse mutants in which other
(non-cholesterol) lipid-generating enzymes have been ablated
show normal myelination, often followed by impaired myelin
maintenance15. In line, interference with fatty acid synthesis
causes more subtle defects in the peripheral nerves, including
changes of the myelin ultrastructure as well as an altered
Schwann cell metabolism16. Indeed, a role for glial lipids in
intermediate metabolism, independent of myelin biogenesis,
has been suggested16–18. Moreover, all major myelin lipids are
present in lipid rafts with structural myelin proteins, including
PMP2213,19–21.
We previously observed a transcriptional downregulation of
the lipid-related genes in sciatic nerves of Pmp22 transgenic
rats22. In detail, in a comparative transcriptomic analysis using
microarrays between mildly and severely affected CMT rats at
early (P6) and late (P90) time points, we found the lipid-
associated genes to be differentially expressed between mildly and
severely affected CMT rats, which allowed us to derive surrogate
biomarkers for disease severity22,64.
This led to the hypothesis that Pmp22 overexpression in CMT1A
disease and disturbed intracellular lipid metabolism interfere
with myelin biogenesis and cause the dysmyelinating phenotype.
Myelinating glial cells normally self-generate their lipids during
development, but they can take up and utilize extracellular
lipids13,23,24. Moreover, when mice were fed with a special lipid diet,
the
myelin–lipid
composition
transformed
substantially25,26.
Thus, Schwann cells respond to internal and external changes of
lipid metabolism, rendering lipid supplementation an attractive
therapeutic option in diseases such as CMT1A.
Results
Schwann cells in CMT1A display impaired lipid biosynthesis.
We previously observed a differential expression of lipid-related
genes between mildly and severely affected CMT1A rats at single
early (P6) and late (P90) time points using microarray analysis22;
however, the temporal regulation of lipid metabolism and its
relation to postnatal myelination remained unclear. In a first
step, we therefore used RNA-sequencing to analyze the lipid
biosynthetic and metabolic processes in a longitudinal manner
in sciatic nerve transcriptoms derived from wild-type and
Pmp22 transgenic rats before and during the time course of
myelination (Fig. 1a). Importantly, in this unbiased approach,
lipid biosynthetic and metabolic processes were the most pro-
minently downregulated transcripts in CMT1A rats during
postnatal development, with a reduced mRNA expression of both
lipid catabolizing and anabolizing transcripts (Fig. 1a). The
observed transcriptional dysregulation in CMT1A strongly cor-
relates with the time course of myelin biosynthesis, and no
major changes of gene transcription were observed at embryonic
day 21 (Fig. 1a). In order to unravel the nature of mRNA dys-
regulation in Pmp22 transgenic Schwann cells, we grouped the
individual transcripts into four distinct patterns based on the
expression profile similarity (Fig. 1a). In fact, almost all lipid-
associated transcripts follow a similar expression pattern with
lipid genes failing to be upregulated in Pmp22 transgenic
Schwann cells during myelination (Pattern 1, to a lesser extent
Pattern 3, Fig. 1a), indicating that Schwann cells display an
impaired ability to mount a lipid biosynthetic transcriptional
program in CMT1A disease.
Does this explain the compromised ability of CMT Schwann
cells to myelinate? We sought to test this in primary Schwann cell
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuron co-cultures derived from
Pmp22 transgenic animals by exogenous lipid supplementation.
Indeed, when compared with wild type, the Pmp22 transgenic
Schwann cell DRG co-cultures appeared to recapitulate the
pronounced dysmyelination observed in vivo in CMT1A disease
(Fig. 1b, c). In order to decide for the optimal lipid species in a
supplementation experiment, we performed in-depth bioinfor-
matics on the metabolic pathways of major lipid classes in myelin
and their perturbation by CMT1A. The vast majority of
transcripts for proteins involved in phospholipid, cholesterol,
and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis were downregulated (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1A–C). Among the phospholipids, the metabolism
of phosphatidylcholine, a major myelin compound, was severely
impaired at the transcriptional level in sciatic nerves of CMT1A
rats (Fig. 1d).
Importantly, while phosphatidylcholine treatment did not
improve myelination when added to lipid-oversaturated standard
medium (Supplementary Fig. 1D), the supplementation of
Pmp22
transgenic
Schwann
cell
co-cultures
with
2 µg/ml
phosphatidylcholine (PC) in delipidated medium resulted in a
striking increase in the number of myelinated segments, stained
for myelin basic protein (MBP) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary
Fig. 1E). Notably, phosphatidylcholine treatment also raised the
number of myelinated segments in wild-type cultures, ultimately
leading to an equal degree of in vitro myelination in control and
CMT1A-derived Schwann cell DRG co-cultures (Fig. 1e). In a
subsequent experiment, we treated Pmp22 transgenic Schwann
cell neuron co-cultures with tail group-labeled phosphatidylcho-
line (BODIPY-PC). Importantly, Schwann cells incorporated the
labeled phosphatidylcholine into the myelin membrane, suggest-
ing that the rescue of myelination is due to a direct incorporation
of the exogenously supplied lipids into the myelin sheath (Fig. 1f).
Of note, BODIPY alone (tagged to pentanoic acid) was taken
up by the cells, but was not incorporated into the myelin
sheath (Fig. 1f).

 Phospholipid therapy ameliorates neuropathy in CMT1A rats.
Following this in vitro findings, we tested whether systemically
applied phospholipids can reach the peripheral nervous system
and are utilized by Schwann cells for myelin biosynthesis in vivo.
We injected fluorescently labeled phosphatidylcholine (BODIPY-
PC; 500 µg) once into the tail vein of CMT rats during active
myelination (postnatal day 15) and analyzed the myelin sheaths
histologically in sciatic nerves 1 week post injection (Fig. 2a).
Notably, we were able to detect several myelinated fibers with
incorporated BODIPY-PC, confirming that Schwann cells make
use of exogenously supplied lipids for myelin biosynthesis
(Fig. 2a).

 Based on the positive effect of PC treatment on myelination
in vitro, we next asked whether lipid supplementation is also able
to promote myelination in an experimental treatment approach
in the CMT1A rat model in vivo. In a proof-of-principle trial, we
treated Pmp22 transgenic and control rats from postnatal day 2
(P2) until adulthood (P112) by providing either normal food
or
a
diet
enriched
with
two
different
concentrations
of
phospholipids (PL) into the cages housing the mother and the
pups (Fig. 2b). The experimental diets contained 3.8% crude fat
(see Methods) and were enriched by either 0.3 or 3% soy bean-
derived PL composed of 55% phosphatidylcholine and 20%
phosphatidylethalonamine in addition to trace amounts of other
lipids. Of note, the lipid diet was well tolerated by the animals and
did not show side effects or abnormal weight gain (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2A).
As rat pups only consume solid food from postnatal day 15 on,
we analyzed to which extent the supplemented lipids passed in
the milk of the nursing dams. To this end, we treated the nursing
dams after they gave birth from P2 to P9 with 3% PL. At P9, we
collected the milk from the stomachs of the pups and subjected
the samples to mass spectrometry. Of note, the lipid proportion
of milk in general consists of >98% of neutral lipids, mostly
TAG27. With over 60%, the major fatty acid compound in the
supplemented phospholipid is linoleic acid, which harbors two
double bonds (C18:2, see Methods). When plotting the analyzed
milk neutral lipids (TAG plus DAG) as a function of the double
bonds, a significant shift toward species with either two or four
double bonds was visible, indicating that the supplemented
phospholipid fatty acid tails have passed in the mother's milk in
the form of neutral lipids (Supplementary Fig. 2B).
Importantly, when we analyzed the grip strength of the animals
treated from P2 to P112, we detected a dose-dependent
improvement in Pmp22 transgenic rats treated with both, a
0.3% or a 3% PL diet (Fig. 2c). CMT1A rats that received the 3%
PL treatment showed a significantly improved muscle strength at
the end point of the therapeutic trial (P112), even reaching wild-
type levels (Fig. 2c). In good agreement, the muscle circumfer-
ence, a measure for muscle mass, showed a significant increase in
both, the 0.3% and 3% PL-treated CMT1A rats when compared
with controls (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, in electrophysiological
recordings at study end, we detected a mild but significant
improvement of the nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in addition
to a substantial amelioration of the decreased compound muscle
action potentials (CMAPs), indicating a larger number of fast
propagating myelinated axons after PL therapy28,29 (Fig. 2e, f).
These results prompted us to further investigate the myelination
status of peripheral nerves by histology. In the tibial nerve of
PL-treated CMT1A rats, we found a striking increase of
myelinating axons, again with numbers reaching wild-type levels
in the 3% PL therapy group (Fig. 3a, b). Moreover, when we
quantified the density of axonal neurofilaments, which is
aberrantly increased in CMT1A rats and has been previously
shown to impair nerve function in peripheral neuropathy30, we
found the neurofilament spacing to be improved after PL therapy
without changes in axonal diameter (Fig. 3c, d and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3A). Hence, exogenous lipid supplementation emerges as
an effective therapeutic approach in a CMT1A rat model.
Dietary lipids normalize myelin ultrastructure in CMT rats.
Lipid supplementation did not affect the number of unmyelinated
axons or onion bulb formations in CMT1A rats (Supplementary
Fig. 3B, C), suggesting that PL treatment predominantly supports
myelinating Pmp22 transgenic Schwann cells. Analysis of myelin
sheath thickness in untreated CMT rats, as assessed by g-ratio
quantification, showed the expected distribution of small caliber
hypermyelinated fibers and large caliber axons with reduced
myelin sheath thickness, however, with no alteration after PL
therapy (Fig. 4a, b). Likewise, we observed no improvement of the
reduced internodal length in teased fiber preparations of Pmp22
tg nerves after PL therapy (Supplementary Fig. 3D). In line, when
we determined the nodal width with the help of immunohis-
tochemistry against the nodal NaV1.6 and the confining myelin
MBP, we found no alteration of an abnormally widened nodal
area in treated CMT1A animals (Supplementary Fig. 3E).
When we analyzed the myelin ultrustructure in human
CMT1A biopsy material at the electron microscopic level, myelin
morphology was overall comparable between CMT1A nerve
samples and respective controls (Fig. 4c, d). Of note, non-
standardized processing of human nerve biopsies in clinical
routine hampers reliable quantification of subtle ultrastructural
differences; nonetheless, a mildly widened interperiodic distance
may be present in human CMT1A, as quantified in two control
versus three CMT1A specimens (Fig. 4d), in line with previous
observations31. These findings prompted us to assess myelin
periodicity in the CMT rat model, where we detected a significant
widening of the distance between the individual myelin layers in
CMT rat myelin (Fig. 4e, f), in line with the human observations.
Importantly, we found the widened myelin periodicity that we
observe in CMT rats to be normalized after PL therapy (Fig. 4e, f).
In order to assess to which extent the altered ultrastructural
myelin morphology may be due to alterations in the protein
and lipid composition of the myelin sheath, we performed
western blot and mass spectrometric analyses of purified myelin,
Fig. 1 CMT rat Schwann cells display impaired endogenous ability to synthesize lipids. a Heatmap (left) shows scaled TPM values (transcripts per million)
for differentially expressed genes (adjusted p value <0.05 and log2 fold change >|0.5|) at P18. Genes downregulated in Tg (Pmp22 transgenic) versus Wt
(wild type) at P18 were further divided into two patterns—genes with increasing TPM in Wt from E21 to P18 (pattern 1) and remaining (pattern 3). Genes
upregulated in Tg versus Wt at P18 were further divided into two patterns—genes with increasing TPM in Tg from E21 to P18 (pattern 2) and remaining
(pattern 4). Heatmap (right) shows top ten biological process terms (from WebGestalt) for each pattern. b Dorsal root ganglia neuron and Schwann cell
co-cultures from wild-type (Wt) and Pmp22 transgenic (Tg) mice revealed impaired myelination in Tg co-cultures. Shown are representative pictures of Wt
and Tg cultures 14 days after myelination induction. Myelin is immunostained for MBP (green) and axons for TUJ1 (magenta). Scale = 100 µm.

medium, Tg co-cultures integrate BODPIPY-labeled phosphatidylcholine (left panels, BODIPY-PC, green, 2 µg/ml medium) into the myelin sheaths (MBP,

induction). Cultures were counterstained for nuclei (DAPI, blue). Scale = 100 µm (blow up 50 µm)

 comparing wild-type rats to PL-treated and non-treated CMT
rats (Fig. 5a–d). Here, we did not detect major differences in
protein stoichiometry between PMP22 and MPZ from untreated
and PL-treated CMT rats, and when compared with wild-type
controls (Fig. 5a, b). Interestingly, MBP protein levels in myelin
were slightly increased after PL therapy in CMT rats, but
remained unaltered in full nerve lysates (Fig. 5a, b and
Supplementary Fig. 4A).
However, when normalized to protein input, mass spectro-
metric analysis of purified myelin demonstrated a highly
significant reduction by >50% of nearly all classes of lipids in
CMT rat myelin (Fig. 5c). Importantly, after PL therapy, the lipid-
to-protein ratio in the myelin of CMT rats showed a strong trend
toward normalization, although the majority of individual lipid
classes does not reach significance compared with non-treated
Pmp22 transgenic controls (Fig. 5c). Indeed, the observed high
variability in adult Pmp22 transgenic rats at onset may underlie
the lack of significance after treatment and may reflect the
ongoing de- and remyelination in adult peripheral nerves of
CMT1A rats. Interestingly, the stoichiometry of the main lipid

 classes in purified myelin was barely altered between wild-type
and CMT rats, with plasmalogens (down in CMT rats) and
triacylglycerols (up in CMT rats) as the only deregulated lipids in
wild-type versus CMT rat myelin (Supplementary Fig. 4B).
However, in purified CMT rat myelin, the proportion of 36 acyl
carbon molecules among glycerolipids was decreased and again
increased after PL treatment (Fig. 5d). We note that the vast
majority of supplemented phospholipid species contained a total
of 36 acyl carbons on two fatty acid residues, as the diet
comprised of 80% 18-carbon fatty acids (see Methods). The
increase of 36 acyl carbon lipids after PL therapy strongly
suggests that dietary lipids have been efficiently incorporated into
the myelin sheath (Fig. 5d).
Lipid therapy is effective at different CMT1A disease stages.
We previously demonstrated that treatment of CMT rats with
the recombinant growth factor neuregulin-1 early postnatally
(P6–P18) significantly improves CMT1A disease pathology8.
Importantly, early short-term treatment (12 days) was sufficient
to improve the disease phenotype over 3 months, whereas
neuregulin-1 treatment starting at later time points was less
effective8. We therefore tested whether the therapeutic effect of
PL is also restricted to a specific time window. We treated new-
born CMT rats (including their mothers, as lactating pups start
feeding solid food only around P15) with 3% PL from P2 to P21,
i.e., during the phase of active myelination (Fig. 6a). Indeed,
without altering the body weight, this early short-term therapy
was sufficient to improve motor performance when CMT rats
were phenotyped at age P21 (Fig. 6b, c). We also observed a sig-
nificant increase in the number of myelinated fibers in PL-treated
CMT rats at that age (Fig. 6d, e), demonstrating that early short-
term treatment improves developmental myelination. Next, we
asked whether the early postnatal treatment would result in a
long-term therapeutic effect. Surprisingly, when short-term-
treated CMT rats (until P21) were analyzed after treatment ces-
sation, the improved motor phenotype was still obvious at P30,
but disappeared when retested at P50 and P75 (Fig. 6f). Is a
continuous PL treatment required to maintain the therapeutic
effect? Of note, while the continuous PL treatment from P2 to
P112 proved successful on histological and phenotypical level (see
above Figs. 2, 3), the analysis of the molecular Schwann cell
phenotype in P2–P112 PL-treated CMT rats did not show an
improved Schwann cell differentiation or dedifferentiation nei-
ther on the level of gene transcription (Supplementary Fig. 5A)
nor on the level of MEK/ERK activity (Supplementary Fig. 5B), a
pathway crucially involved in Schwann cell dedifferentiation32.
Another established mediator of Schwann cell dedifferentiation is
macrophage-driven
inflammation33.
Corroborating
previous
studies in various CMT mouse models34, the rat mutants indeed
displayed an elevated number of endoneurial macrophages; this
elevation was not changed by the PL treatment at P112

 (Supplementary Fig. 5C). Hence, PL treatment, in contrast to
neuregulin-1 therapy, does not improve Schwann cell differ-
entiation in the CMT1A rat model, indicating that PL acts as a
downstream
effector
of
myelination
without
affecting
the
underlying failure of intracellular Schwann cell signaling. Indeed,
PL treatment did not ameliorate the reduced PI3K–AKT activity
(as measured by AKT phosphorylation) in CMT rat peripheral
nerve (Supplementary Fig. 5D). Moreover, while the direct
pharmacological activation of PI3K/AKT induces lipid gene
transcription (Supplementary Fig. 6A)35, PL-treated CMT rats
showed no rescue of mRNA expression of myelin and lipid genes
at P21 (Fig. 7a). In line, we observed no transcriptional upregu-
lation of the rate-limiting enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis as
well as for the major myelin protein Mpz in vitro after PC
treatment of myelinating co-cultures (Supplementary Fig. 6B).
Only, a slight upregulation in wild-type co-cultures was found for
Mbp mRNA in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1B). We hence postu-
late
that
the
promyelinating
effect
of
phospholipids
are
downstream of a transcriptional regulation, and that Schwann
cells may execute cholesterol and myelin protein biosynthesis via
post-transcriptional changes by compensation and regulation on
the protein level, e.g., by modulating enzyme activities. In order to
demonstrate in proof-of-principle that PC treatment indeed
results in an increased biosynthesis of other myelin components,
we took advantage of differentiating primary rat Schwann cell
monocultures to measure the cholesterol production as a function
of PC treatment. Importantly, here we found more cholesterol
to be produced in Schwann cells treated with PC, without a
concomitant change in cholesterol-related mRNA expression
(Fig. 7b, c).
We conclude that PL treatment does not induce intracellular
lipid biosynthesis on the transcriptional level, and that the
therapeutic effect is mediated by a direct compensation of
Schwann cells lipid metabolism. This also explains the observed
fading of the therapeutic benefit after PL treatment cessation
(Fig. 6f).

(Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, KS test) of all individually measured myelin sheaths between CTRL (23 measurements) and CMT1A (33 measurements)

 Accordingly, PL treatment starting after postnatal myelination
should still improve CMT1A disease, as lipid biosynthesis in
affected Schwann cells remains transcriptionally downregulated
throughout life. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we fed the
CMT rats with chow enriched with 3% PL, now from P21 until
P90 (Fig. 7d). Indeed, a longitudinal analysis of the motor
phenotype revealed an improved motor performance when tested
after 2 months of treatment (Fig. 7e). Importantly, at study end,
treated CMT rats showed muscular preservation (Fig. 7f),
improved axonal preservation, as measured by improved CMAP,
despite unaltered NCV (Fig. 7g), and a significantly increased
number of myelinated fibers in the tibial nerve (Fig. 7h)
compared with non-treated controls. In summary, we have
demonstrated that PL application directly improves the function
of myelinating Schwann cells, and that treating Pmp22 transgenic
rats with PL improves CMT1A disease in this model at the
behavioral, physiological, and histological level.
Discussion
CMT1A is characterized by dysmyelination during early postnatal
development along with a slowly progressive demyelination and
axonal loss in adult peripheral nerves. Using a Pmp22 transgenic
disease model, we here demonstrate that mutant Schwann cells are
characterized by an endogenous defect of efficient lipid bio-
synthesis that originates at the transcriptional level, coincides with
the onset of myelination, and persists throughout life. Importantly,
lipid gene transcription has been recently shown to be controlled
by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade in Schwann cells35,36.
In line, we previously found that Pmp22 transgenic Schwann cells
are characterized by a strongly decreased PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway during postnatal development8. Hence, the defective lipid
gene transcription in CMT1A may be the direct result of reduced
AKT/mTOR activation in CMT1A. In line with this hypothesis,
we were indeed able to induce the transcription of lipid genes by
stimulating the PI3K/AKT pathway in Pmp22-overexpressing
Schwann cells in vitro. In turn, we did not find enhanced PI3K/
AKT activity in PL-treated CMT rats in vivo, and reduced lipid
gene transcription was not ameliorated in PL-treated CMT1A rats.
Also, molecular Schwann cell differentiation was not rescued by
PL therapy in CMT1A animals. Hence, we suggest that impaired
lipid biosynthesis is downstream of impaired PI3K/AKT signaling,
which eventually hinders myelin biosynthesis by Pmp22-over-
expressing Schwann cells.

 The persistent defect of Schwann cell differentiation and
decreased PI3K/AKT signaling may explain why the cessation of
PL treatment is accompanied by a fading of the therapeutic effect.
Indeed, we found lipid transcription to be still downregulated in
adult Pmp22 transgenic Schwann cells compared with wild-type
controls, suggesting that also the (in general lower) lipid need in
adulthood cannot be fulfilled by diseased Schwann cells in
CMT1A. The previously described slowed and hence prolonged
myelination in CMT1A8, together with ongoing de- and remye-
lination in adult disease stages is likely to require a continuous
lipid biosynthesis by Pmp22 transgenic Schwann cells, next to
physiological myelin turnover.
We hence hypothesized that targeting a downstream problem,
the reduced availability of synthesized lipids, should ameliorate
the cellular defect of CMT1A animals with regard to myelin
sheath production. Indeed, when we applied fluorescence-labeled
exogenous lipids, the added lipids were utilized by Schwann cells
and incorporated into the myelin sheath, which resulted in
strongly improved myelination compared with non-treated con-
trols. Of note, in vitro phosphatidylcholine treatment induced
the production of cholesterol by Pmp22 transgenic Schwann cells
without concomitant changes in lipid transcription, suggesting
that post-transcriptional mechanisms such as compensation and
regulation of enzyme activities enables Schwann cells to execute
lipid
and
myelin
protein
biosynthesis
upon
phospholipid
supplementation.
Importantly, when we translated these findings into a ther-
apeutic trial in vivo, we detected improved myelin biosynthesis
along with an amelioration of the neuropathic phenotype in
Pmp22 transgenic rats based on a simple PL-enriched diet. We
note that in vivo PL treatment did not alter the number of
myelinated axons in wild types, in contrast to the in vitro
experiments which were performed under starvation in the
lipoprotein-deficient medium, whereas this is not the case in vivo,
suggesting that the exogenous lipids are not rate limiting in vivo
in the wild-type situation under normal chow conditions.
Where does the increased number of myelinated fibers after
in vivo PL treatment derive from? We previously demonstrated
that CMT1A rats never achieve a normal number of myelinated
axons during postnatal development, with a significant difference
in the number of myelinated axons from postnatal day 18 on8.
Those fibers that should be myelinated (caliber >1 µm), but
remain amyelinated during development survive within the nerve
until later disease stages in adulthood and slowly degenerate with
disease progression. Hence, we suggest that PL treatment helps
Schwann cells to physiologically myelinate this pool of amyeli-
nated fibers (>1 µm), thereby protecting these fibers against
degeneration. Moreover, PL treatment improved the lipid-to-
protein ratio in myelin membranes as well as the widened
ultrastructural periodicity of the myelin layers in CMT rats. An
altered myelin periodicity has also been detected in nerve biopsies
from patients with CMT1A31 (Fig. 4c, d), but the underlying
mechanisms were unknown. We detected only minor changes in
protein stoichiometry in CMT rats, suggesting that myelin pro-
tein composition is not the cause of the altered myelin periodicity
in CMT1A. However, a widened myelin periodicity has been

 recently demonstrated in mouse mutants in which fatty acid
synthesis or plasmalogen phospholipid synthesis had been
ablated16,37, indicating that decreased amount of lipids in myelin
of Pmp22 transgenic Schwann cells (Fig. 5c) could be the direct
cause for the observed ultrastructural changes. That lipid sup-
plementation can indeed affect myelin composition has been
suggested by pulse chase experiments, showing that intraper-
itoneally injected phospholipid precursors are rapidly taken up by
Schwann cells and deposited into the myelin38, and further
demonstrated in our present findings after intravenous injection
of fluorescently labeled PC. Hence, myelin lipid composition in
the periphery is plastic and can be influenced by both exogenous
and endogenous availability of lipids.

Fig. 7 Late phospholipid therapy ameliorates neuropathy in CMT rats. a Large-scale qPCR analysis in P21 sciatic nerves mRNA extracts of rats that were
treated with or without 3% PL, as in Fig. 6a. Analysis of genes encoding myelin, lipid anabolism, and lipid catabolism proteins revealed a consistent
downregulation of virtually all respective gene transcripts in Tg animals, compared with Wt controls, which was unaltered upon 3% PL treatment (n = 8 per
group, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post test). b, c Treatment of differentiating Schwann cell monocultures kept in delipidated serum with
phosphatidylcholine (PC, 2 µg/ml) revealed an increased cholesterol biosynthesis (b, paired analyses, three biological replicates with each two treated
versus two non-treated cultures, paired t test) without a concomitant transcriptional change in key enzymes of cholesterol synthesis (c, six treated versus
six non-treated cultures, Student's t test). d A third cohort of rats underwent a late long-term treatment paradigm from P21 on. e After 2 months of
treatment, at P90, CMT control rats (red, n = 20) performed worse when compared with wild-type controls (black, n = 12), whereas CMT rats treated with
3% PL (blue, n = 15) showed significant improvement in grip strength. No phenotype improvement was observed at earlier time points (P35 and P63).

 that an optimized molecular composition and architecture of
myelin would reduce the capacitance and increase the resistance
in nerve fibers and, hence, improve nerve conduction39. Of
note, we did not observe changes in other parameters involved
in nerve conduction speed, such as myelin sheath thickness,
internodal length, and axonal caliber (Fig. 4a, b and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3A, D).
Importantly, we observed a therapeutic effect of PL treatment
not only during early postnatal development, but also when we
started treatment in advanced disease stages in adult CMT rats.
This finding is of major relevance in view of a potential transla-
tion of our findings into clinical trials with patients affected by
CMT1A disease. Indeed, although the first symptoms occur
already during childhood, most patients seek medical advice and
respective therapeutic options only in young adulthood. More-
over, as CMT1A disease is characterized by strong clinical
variability, a therapeutic intervention in adult, symptomatic
patients can be more easily adapted to disease burden and prevent
overtreatment and side effects in pediatric patients. Importantly,
dietary phospholipids have been tested in many clinical trials
and showed no substantial side effects40. In clinical practice,
phospholipid treatment has even been associated with a lower
cardiovascular risk, anti-inflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis, and a potential positive influence on memory and
cognition in neurological disorders40. We hence suggest that a
phospholipid therapy constitutes a promising translatable ther-
apeutic rationale for CMT1A disease, which may also be applic-
able in conjunction with other newly emerging therapeutic
options, such as treatment with antisense oligonucleotides sup-
pressing Pmp22 mRNA, which has recently been shown to
improve the disease phenotype in CMT1A animal models41.
In conclusion, we have identified perturbed lipid metabolism as
a disease mechanism downstream of Pmp22 duplication in
CMT1A, and found that dietary lipid supplementation acts as a
downstream effector of Schwann cell function, which bypasses
the inefficient expression of genes for lipid synthesis in Pmp22
transgenic Schwann cells. This improves myelin biosynthesis and
the neuropathic phenotype of a CMT1A rat model, demon-
strating that lipid supplementation should be considered as a new
therapeutic approach to CMT1A disease.
Methods
Transgenic rats and mice. Pmp22 transgenic rats9, (SD-Tg(Pmp22)Kan), were
used for experimental therapy trials, while E13.5 Pmp22 transgenic mice, (Tg
(PMP22)C61Clh), embryos were used for in vitro experiments42. For genotyping
PCR, genomic DNA was extracted from the tail biopsies using nexttec Kit
according to the manufacturer’s procedures. For routine genotyping, we used
the following PCR primers in a coamplification reaction. Primer sequences:
Genotyping primers: For Pmp22 transgenic rats, sense 5′-CCAGAAAGCCA
GGGAACTC-3′, and antisense 5′-GACAAACCCCAGACAGTTG-3′, and for
Pmp22 transgenic mice, sense 5′-TCAGGATATCTATCTGATTCTC-3′ and anti-
sense 5′-AAGCTCATGGAGCACAAAACC-3′. All animal experiments were
conducted according to the Lower Saxony State regulations for animal experi-
mentation in Germany, as approved by the Niedersächsische Landesamt für Ver-
braucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (LAVES), and in compliance with the
guidelines of the Max Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were pre-established. Only male rats were used
for the therapy trials. Animals were randomly included according to the
genotyping results, age, and weight into the experiments. Animals were excluded
prior to experiments in case of impaired health condition or weight difference of
more than 10% with the average group. Exclusion criteria, during or after the
experiment was performed, comprise impaired health condition of individual
animals not attributed to genotype or experiment (according to veterinary), or
weight loss >10% of the average group. No animals had to be excluded due to
illness/weight loss in all performed animal experiments. Exclusion criteria
regarding the outcome assessment were determined with an appropriate
statistical test, the Grubbs’ test (or ESD method), using the statistic software
GraphPad (Prism).
Animal experiments (phenotype analyses, electrophysiology and histology)
were conducted in a single blinded fashion towards the investigator. Selection of
animal samples out of different experimental groups for molecular biology/
histology/biochemistry was performed randomly and in a blinded fashion.
Phospholipid therapy. Standard rat chow was used (PS R-Z, Ssniff Spezialdiäten
GmbH), according to the supplier, consisting of 35% starch, 21.2% crude protein,
6.7% crude ash, 5% sugar, 4.4% crude fiber, and 3.8% crude fat. In the phospholipid
treatment study, soy phospholipids (SIGMA, P3644; 55% phosphatidylcholine,
20% phosphatidylethanolamine) was mixed to the standard chow at two different
concentrations, 0.3 and 3%. The fatty acid contents of the supplemented phos-
pholipids were ~60% C18:2 (linoleic), 17% C16:0 (palmitic), 9% C18:1 (oleic), 7%
C18:3 (linolenic), and 4% C18:0 (stearic), with other fatty acids being minor
contributors.
The animals, wild types and Pmp22 transgenics, were fed with 0.3 or 3%
lecithin-chow in four different therapeutic paradigms. (1) Long-term treatment
from P2 to P112, (2) early short-term treatment from P2 to P21, and (3) early
short-term treatment late effect, in which the animals were fed with 3% lecithin-
chow from P2 to P21 and then the animals were switched to normal food until P80.
The last feeding paradigm (4) was the late long-term treatment, in which the
animals received chow mixed with lecithin from P21 to P90. We performed a priori
power analysis integrating the disease variability in order to calculate the required
group sizes. In addition, we have stratified all CMT rats for the late long-term
treatment (P21–P90) before therapy start (P19). However, for the trials starting
right after birth (P2–P21 and P2–P90), stratification was not possible (as
phenotype tests at that age are not applicable). In these trials, rats were randomly
allocated to the different treatment groups. At each treatment paradigm’s
termination time point, motor phenotyping and electrophysiology of the animals
were performed and finally, tissues were collected after killing the animals for
further histological and molecular analysis.
In order to test the incorporation of circulating phosphatidylcholine into the
myelin sheath, 500 µg BODIPY-labeled TopFluor PC (Avanti polar lipids,
#810281) dissolved in 25 µl of pure ethanol was infused into the tail vein of a
15-day-old CMT rat. One week later, the rat was killed and the tissue was collected
for analysis.
Motor phenotyping. The impact of lecithin treatment on the rats forelimbs’ and
the hindlimbs’ grip strength was examined by standardized grip strength tests22,43.
For hindlimb measurements, forelimbs of the animal were supported and the
animal’s tail was pulled against a horizontal T-bar (width 14 cm, diameter 3.2 mm)
connected to a gauge. In case of forelimb measurements, the animal gripped the
same horizontal T-bar during pulling it away from the bar with increasing force.
The maximum force (measured in Newton) exerted onto the T-bar before the
animal lost grip was recorded, and a mean of at least eight repeated measurements
was calculated. All phenotyping analyses were performed by the same investigator
who was blinded toward the genotype and treatment arm. To assess the extent of
muscle mass, the skin of the left forelimb was removed and the muscle cir-
cumference was measured by wrapping a non-sterile silk suture thread (0.65 mm;
F.S.T. cat#18020-03) five times around the group of muscles (adjacent non
overlying), attached to the radius and the ulna, starting from the joint toward the
paw. The wrapped thread length was measured to the nearest millimeter using a
normal desk ruler (adapted from ref. 44).
Electrophysiology. Nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) and compound muscle
action potentials (CMAPs) were measured22,43. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with
xylazinhydrochloride/ketaminhydrochloride (8 mg per kg body weight/100 mg per
kg body weight). For distal stimulation, two steel electrodes (Schuler Medi-
zintechnik, Freiburg, Germany) were placed along the tibial nerve above the ankle
and for proximal stimulation other two steel electrodes were placed at the sciatic
nerve notch. Recording needle electrodes were inserted into the plantar muscles.
Supramaximal square wave pulses (100 ms duration) were applied using a Toennies
Neuroscreen (Jaeger, Hoechsberg, Germany). NCVs were calculated using the
distance between the proximal and distal stimulation electrodes, while the leg is
completely extended, and sciatic nerve conduction latency measurements.
Histology. For light microscopy: sciatic nerves of the rats were kept in 2.5%
glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate buffer for 1 week.
Afterward, probes were osmicated and embedded in epoxy resin (Serva). Semi-thin
sections (0.5 μm) were prepared (Leica RM 2155, using a diamond knife Histo HI
4317, Diatome) and stained with a mixture of 1% toluidine blue and azur
II–methylene blue for 1 min at 60 °C. Microscopic images were collected using a
×100 lens (Leica DMRXA), and digital images were obtained using Axiophot
microscope (Zeiss) equipped with AxioCam MRC (Zeiss) and zen 2012 software.
Counting of myelinated axons was carried out on whole sciatic nerve cross sections,
manually using ImageJ (NIH).
For electron microscopy: Ultrathin (50–70 nm) sciatic nerve cross sections were
treated with 1% uranylacetate solution and lead citrate and analyzed using a Zeiss
EM10 or EM109 (Leo). Myelin sheath thickness comparison was carried out via
calculation of the g-ratio, which is a numerical ratio between the fiber’s diameter
and the diameter of the same fiber and the myelin sheath wrapping it. For g-ratio
comparison at least 150 fibers were randomly analyzed from each sciatic nerve at

 ×3000 magnification. Ultrastructural analysis was performed by measuring the
periodicity, i.e., the distance between two adjacent major dense lines, for at least 20
periods per myelinated fiber of at least 10 (human sural nerves) and 20 (rat tibial
nerves) myelinated fibers per sample at a ×30,000 magnification. For all histological
quantification, the experimenter was blinded with respect to genotype and
treatment of all animals.
The morphometric analysis of human sural nerve biopsies was performed in
three patients affected by CMT1A disease (all three with a genetically confirmed
duplication of the PMP22 gene, two males, one female, age 59, 60, and 44 years,
respectively) and on two biopsies of individuals without signs and microscopic
characteristics of a peripheral neuropathy (both females age 39 and 51 years).
Cell culture. Dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) cultures were prepared by isolating DRGs
from wild-type or Pmp22 transgenic mouse embryos (C61 line42 at embryonic day
13.5 (E13.5) and plated according to standard procedure45. Dissociated DRGs, with
trypsin, were plated at a density of 10 × 104 cells per 1 mm coverslip coated with
collagen (Gibco). The cells were kept in a growth medium, 10% deactivated
Hyclone fetal bovine serum (GE healthcare & Life technologies) and 50 ng/ml NGF
(alomone labs) in a minimum essential medium (MEM), (Gibco) for 1 week. In
order to induce myelination, growth medium was supplemented with 50 ng/ml
ascorbic acid (AA) (SIGMA) every other day. In order to test the effect of exo-
genously applied phosphatidylcholine (PC) on myelination in vitro, the cells were
switched to myelination medium composed of MEM containing 10% lipoprotein-
deficient serum (LPDS) (Sigma), 50 ng/ml NGF, 50 ng/ml ascorbic acid (AA) after
growing the cells for 1 week in normal growth medium. The cultures grown on
LPDS were supplemented with 2 µg/ml PC (Avanti polar lipids, #441601 G) dis-
solved in ethanol while control cultures received equal amounts of ethanol as PC-
treated cultures. For testing the direct incorporation of PC into myelin, by the time
of myelination induction the cells were treated with 2 µg/ml BODIPY-labeled
TopFluor PC (Avanti polar lipids, #810281), whereas control cultures were treated
with 2 µg/ml BODIPY-labeled pentanoic acid (ThermoFisher, #D3834).
Rat Schwann cells were prepared from sciatic nerves of four newborn rats (4-day
old)46. For cell expansion, media were supplied with 10 ng per ml medium
recombinant human neuregulin-1 EGF-like domain (rhNRG1, Reprokine) and
4 μM forskolin (SIGMA). Cells were deprived of rhNRG1 for 1 week before freezing
and storage. For experiments, independent Schwann cell preparations (as biological
replicates) were defrosted, replated, and cultured on resting medium (DMEM +
10% FCS) for 3 days. Before experimental treatment with the specific PI3K activator
(740YP, Tocris), Schwann cells were kept on serum-reduced medium (1% FCS) for
1 day. Schwann cells were collected 6 h after treatment began. For the cholesterol
assay, Schwann cells were kept on DMEM containing 10% LPDS (Sigma) and
differentiated by the addition of 1 mM dbcAMP (Sigma) for 2 days with or without
2 µg/ml phosphatidylcholine. Schwann cells from three independent preparations
were used for cholesterol quantification. Gene expression analysis from Schwann
cells cultured under the same condition was performed in six replicates.
Cholesterol amounts of primary Schwann cell cultures were measured using a
Cholesterol assay kit (Abcam), essentially according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
In brief, cells where harvested in PBS and extracted in a mixture of chloroform:
isopropanol:NP-40 (7:11:0.1). The organic phase was dried under vacuum at room
temperature, resuspended in the assay buffer and subjected to a colorimetric
reaction. Absorbances were measured in a microplate reader and related to
cholesterol concentrations via comparison with a standard curve.
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1× PBS
for 10 min), permeabilized (ice-cold methanol 95% and acetone 5% mixture at
−20 °C for 4 min) and then incubated for 1 h in blocking solution (4% horse
serum, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.1% porcine gelatin. Primary
antibodies (polyclonal rabbit anti-MBP (1:400; Dako) and monoclonal mouse anti-
class III β tubulin (1:500; Covance)) were diluted in blocking solution and applied
at 4 °C overnight. Coverslips were washed three times with 1× PBS, then secondary
antibodies (alexa 488 donkey anti-rabbit (1:400) (Invitrogen) and alexa 555 donkey
anti-mouse (1:400) (Invitrogen)) diluted in blocking solution containing 0.2 μg/ml
4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma), were applied at room tempera-
ture for 1 h. Only in case of TopFluor phosphatidylcholine in vitro application a
different combination of secondary antibodies was used. Finally, coverslips were
washed with PBS, shortly immersed in distilled water and mounted on slides with
aqua-polymount (Polysciences). Fluorescence Images were obtained with fluores-
cence Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with MRM camera (Zeiss). Acquisition
and processing of images was carried out with Zen2–blue edition (Zeiss), ImageJ
(NIH), Photoshop CS (Adobe), and Illustrator 10 (Adobe) software. For the
quantification of myelination, the total number of myelin basic protein (MBP)-
positive myelin segments on each coverslip was counted, and statistics were done
using the two-tailed Student’s t test.
Immunohistochemistry. In order to analyze the incorporation of circulating
fluorescent PC into the myelin sheath (see above), sciatic nerves from PC infused
rats were cryoembedded and longitudinal sections (20 µm) were prepared. The
sections were rehydrated with 0.1 M PBS and fixed with 4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS and
washed with PBS. Then permeabilization (0.4% Triton in PBS for 30 min) and
blocking (4% horse serum (HS), 0.2% Triton in PBS for 30 min) of the fixed tissues
was carried out. The primary antibody (anti-MBP polyclonal rabbit (1:500; Dako))
was diluted in 1× PBS containing 1% HS, 0.05 % Triton and applied overnight at
4 °C. After washing, the secondary antibody (Alexa 555 anti-rabbit 1:500 (Invitro-
gen)) and DAPI were diluted in 1.5% HS in PBS and applied at room temperature
for 2 h. Finally, the slides were washed with PBS, double distilled water, and covered
with aqua-polymount (Polysciences). For staining of activated endoneurial mac-
rophages47–49, fresh-frozen tibial nerve samples were fixed in acetone, blocked for
30 min with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1 M PBS, followed by incubation
overnight with mouse anti-rat ED1 antibodies (1:500, MAK0341R, Linaris) in 1%
BSA in 0.1 M PBS at 4 °C. After washing steps with PBS corresponding Cy3-
conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at RT. Nuclei were visualized by
incubation with DAPI (1:500,000, D9542, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at RT. All
samples were embedded after a final washing step with Aqua-Poly/Mount® (Poly-
sciences). Digital fluorescence microscopic images were acquired using an Axiophot
2 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera (Visitron Systems) and after-
ward processed with Photoshop CS3 (Adobe).
Mass spectrometry of purified myelin and milk. A myelin-enriched light weight
membrane fraction was purified from rats’ sciatic nerves homogenized in 0.27M
sucrose50,51. The protein concentration was measured by Lowry assay using DC
protein assay kit (BioRAD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and/or
with protein gel silver52. The silver gel was imaged with hp Scan jet 6390C
(HP intelligent scanning technology) and the density of each lane was measured
with ImageJ (NIH).
The amount of 1 µg of myelin membranes per sample were subjected to lipid
extractions using an acidic Bligh & Dyer, except from plasmalogens, which were
extracted under neutral conditions53. Lipid standards were added prior to
extractions, using a master mix containing 50 pmol phosphatidylcholine (13:0/13:0,
14:0/14:0, 20:0/20:0; 21:0/21:0, Avanti Polar Lipids) and sphingomyelin (d18:1 with
N-acylated 15:0, 17:0, 25:0, semi-synthesized as described in ref. 54, 200 pmol D6-
cholesterol (Cambrigde Isotope Laboratory), 25 pmol phosphatidylinositol (16:0/
16:0, 17:0/20:4, Avanti Polar Lipids), phosphatidylethanolamine and
phosphatidylserine (both 14:1/14:1, 20:1/20:1, 22:1/22:1, semi-synthesized54,
diacylglycerol (17:0/17:0, Larodan), cholesterol ester (9:0, 19:0, 24:1, Sigma), and
triacylglycerol (D5- Mix, LM-6000/D5-17:0,17:1,17:1, Avanti Polar Lipids), 5 pmol
ceramide and 20 pmol glucosylceramide (both d18:1 with N-acylated 15:0, 17:0,
25:0, semi-synthesized as described54, 50 pmol SGalCer di18:1/17:0 (Avanti Polar
Lipids), 10 pmol phosphatidic acid (17:0/20:4, Avanti Polar) and
phoshatidylglycerol (14:1/14:1, 20:1/20:1, 22:1/22:1), semi-synthesized as
described54. Phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen (PE P-)-containing standard
mix was supplemented with 22 pmol PE P-Mix 1 (16:0p/15:0, 16:0p/19:0, 16:0p/
25:0), 31 pmol PE P- Mix 2 (18:0p/15:0, 18:0p/19:0, 18:0p/25:0), 43 pmol PE P-Mix
3 (18:1p/15:0, 18:1p/19:0, 18:1p/25:0). Semi-synthesis of PE P was performed55.
Lipid extracts were resuspended in 60 µl methanol and samples were analyzed
on an AB SCIEX QTRAP 6500 + mass spectrometer (Sciex, Canada) with chip-
based (HD-D ESI Chip, Advion Biosciences, USA) electrospray infusion and
ionization via a Triversa Nanomate (Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, USA) as
previously described54. Resuspended lipid extracts were diluted 1:10 in 96-well
plates (Eppendorf twin tec 96, colorless, Sigma, Z651400-25A) prior to
measurement.
Measurements were performed in 10 mM ammonium acetate in methanol for
the analysis of most lipids except for sulfatides which were measured in 0.005%
piperidine in methanol in negative ion mode. Precursor and neutral loss scanning
was employed to measure phosphoglycerolipids, sphingolipids, and glycerolipids as
described54. Sulfatides were analyzed by precursor ion mode selecting for
negatively charged fragment ions with m/z 97. Remaining samples were subjected
to cholesterol determination as described56. Data evaluation was done using
LipidView (ABSciex) and an in-house-developed software (ShinyLipids). The lipid
classes’ concentrations defined by mass spectrometric analysis were normalized to
the measured protein concentration as assessed by standard Lowry assay (BioRad)
and silver gel densitometry. To test for a potential overlap of endogenous lipids and
standards we additionally performed lipid extractions in the absence of lipid
standards and subjected the samples to MS analysis and data evaluation. Lipid
standards used for MS analysis did not significantly overlap with endogenous lipid
species (Supplementary Data 1). As an example, the major phosphoglycerolipids
species phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine showed an overlap of
standards with endogenous species of 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively (Supplementary
Data 1). In average, signal intensities of 0.82 ± 0.7% were found to be present in
endogenous lipid samples that overlapped with the m/z values of standards.
For analyses of nursing rat dam's milk, dams were treated with 3% PL as
described above from offspring’s age P2–P9. The P9 pups were killed and the
stomachs content collected and pooled per litter (five treated dams and four control
dams). Samples were transferred to methanol. Lipids obtained by acidic extraction
were subjected to fractionation using Discovery DSC-Si SPE tubes (Sigma-Aldrich).
Lipids were resuspended in 1 ml CHCl3 and loaded twice onto SPE tubes, which
were equilibrated in CHCl3. Lipids were then eluted in three fractions. Fraction 1
was eluted with 3 ml CHCl3, fraction 2 with 3 ml isopropanol:acetone (1:1, v/v),
and fraction 3 with 3 ml methanol. Evaporated samples were resuspended in
methanol. MS analysis and data evaluation were performed in 10 mM ammonium
acetate in methanol as described above.

 Protein analyses. Rat sciatic nerves were homogenized using a Precellys24
homogenizer (Bertin Instruments) in sucrose lysis buffer (320 mM sucrose, 10 mM
Tris base, 1 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM MgCl2, protease inhibitor (cOmplete Mini,
EDTA-free, Roche)). For myelin fractions analysis, samples were prepared
according to the standard procedure mentioned above. Protein electrophoresis was
carried out using precast gradient gels (NuPAGE 4–12% Bis–Tris, Invitrogen).
Relative protein concentrations were determined via colloidal Coomassie staining
(Imperial stain, BioRad). Western blots were incubated overnight with primary
antibodies against p-AKT, AKT, p-ERK, ERK (all polyclonal rabbit; 1:1000, Cell
Signaling), anti-PMP22 (polyclonal rabbit; 1:2000; Assay biotech), anti-MBP are
(monoclonal mouse; 1:1000, Biolegend), and P0 (monoclonal mouse; 1:5000,
kindly provided by H.P. Hartung, Düsseldorf, Germany57). Detection was per-
formed using anti-rabbit and anti-mouse-HRP-coupled secondary antibodies,
respectively (1:5000, Dianova), Western Lightning Plus-ECL, Enhanced Chemilu-
minescence Substrate (Perkin Elmer) and a luminescence Imager (Intas Science
Imaging).
RNA analysis. Total sciatic nerve RNA was extracted with RNeasy Kit (Qiagen),
whereas RNA from cell culture was purified using RLT lysis buffer, according to the
manufacture’s instruction. Concentration and quality (ratio of absorption at 260/
280 nm) of RNA samples were determined using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(ThermoScientific). Integrity of the extracted RNA was determined with the Agi-
lent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies).
For RT-PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using poly-
Thymin and random nonamer primers and Superscript III RNase H reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using the
Roche LC480 Detection System and SYBR Green Master Mix according to the
manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were carried out in four replicates.
The relative quantity (RQ) of RNA was calculated using LC480 Software
(Roche). Results were depicted as histograms (generated by Microsoft-Excel 2003)
of normalized RQ values, with mean RQ value in the given control group
normalized to 100%. As internal standards, peptidylprolyl isomerase A (Ppia) and
ribosomal protein, large, P0 (Rplp0) were used. PCR primer sequences can be
found in the Supplementary Data 2.
RNA-seq analysis. Quality control, read alignment, and differentially
expressed genes: RNA-sequencing resulted in ~24 million reads per sample
(Supplementary Data 3). Quality assessment was based on the raw reads using the
FASTQC quality control tool (v0.10.1)58. The sequence reads (single-end 50 bp)
were aligned to the rat reference genome (rn6) with Bowtie2 (v2.0.2)59 using RSEM
(v1.2.29)60 with default parameters. First, the rat reference genome was indexed
using the Ensembl annotations (v84.6) with rsem-prepare-reference from RSEM
software. Next, rsem-calculate-expression was used to align the reads and quantify
the gene and isoform abundance. The output of rsem-calculate-expression gives the
read count and TPM value (transcripts per million) for each gene and isoform
separately.
The gene ontology (GO) gene sets were obtained from the Molecular Signatures
Database (MSigDB) from the Broad Institute UC San Diego (http://software.
broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). The gene sets were extracted from
MSigDB without any further manipulation and the identifiers are given in the
figure legend.
Statistics. For power analysis, the software G*Power Version 3.1.7. was used.
Power analyses were performed before conducting in vivo therapy experiments (a
priori). Adequate Power (1 – beta-error) was defined as ≥80% and the alpha error
as 5%.
Differential expression analysis was carried out using gene read counts with
DESeq2 package61. Genes with less than 5 reads (baseMean) were filtered out.
Genes with an adjusted p value <0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed.
Gene ontology enrichment analysis: Gene ontology (GO) analysis was conducted
using WebGestalt62. An adjusted p value <0.1 using the Benjamini–Hochberg
method for controlling the false discovery rate was set as significant for GO terms
in biological processes. Results were confirmed using DAVID database for
downregulated genes at P18. Lipidomics data were analyzed using LIMMA
package63. Note that NA values were changed to 0. Linear fit was performed using
lmFit function for two groups at P18 (Wt and Tg) and three groups for P112 (Wt,
Tg_pla, and Tg_Tx3). For the latter, pairwise comparison was performed using
contrasts.fit function for Wt-Tg_pla and Tg_pla-Tg_Tx3. We considered an
adjusted (P18) and non-adjusted (P112) p value <0.05 significant. Unless indicated
otherwise, all other data were processed using MS Excel and GraphPad Prism
v6.04. The statistical test that was used to analyze the data is indicated in the figure
legends, respectively. Briefly, for comparing two group's Student’s t test was used,
for comparing more than two groups one-way ANOVA with appropriate post test
was used and for comparing two or more groups for more than one time point
(longitudinal analysis) two-way ANOVA with appropriate post test was used and a
p value <0.05 was considered significant.
Data availability statement. All RNA-seq data sets are accessible under GEO
accession number GSE115930. All other relevant data are available from the
