STING is an innate immune cytosolic adaptor for DNA sensors that engage malaria parasite
(Plasmodium falciparum) or other pathogen DNA. As P. falciparum infects red blood cells and
not leukocytes, how parasite DNA reaches such host cytosolic DNA sensors in immune cells
is unclear. Here we show that malaria parasites inside red blood cells can engage host
cytosolic innate immune cell receptors from a distance by secreting extracellular vesicles
(EV) containing parasitic small RNA and genomic DNA. Upon internalization of DNA-
harboring EVs by human monocytes, P. falciparum DNA is released within the host cell
cytosol, leading to STING-dependent DNA sensing. STING subsequently activates the kinase
TBK1, which phosphorylates the transcription factor IRF3, causing IRF3 to translocate to the
nucleus and induce STING-dependent gene expression. This DNA-sensing pathway may be
an important decoy mechanism to promote P. falciparum virulence and thereby may affect
future strategies to treat malaria.

 P
athogens are sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRR)
of the mammalian innate immune system, which directly
recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP),
and also host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMP) that are released from infected host cells1. PRR activa-
tion is a double-edged sword; although it is the basis for the
generation of an effective adaptive immune response, PRR acti-
vation can also drive pathology2. One PAMP recognized by PRRs
is nucleic acid, and PRRs that detect pathogen nucleic acids are
divided into two main groups. PRRs at the cell surface or in
endosomes,
such
as
Toll-like
receptors
(TLR),
recognize
pathogen-derived nucleic acids in the extracellular environment.
By contrast, RIG-I-like receptors sense cytosolic viral RNA, and
cGAS and IFI16, which signal via STING, sense cytosolic double-
stranded DNA (dsDNA)3. Once activated, PRRs and dsDNA
sensors trigger signaling cascades that alter gene expression and
stimulate the production of type I interferons (IFN), chemokines
and proinflammatory cytokines4, which activates a broad anti-
pathogen immune response.
Stimulation of cytosolic DNA sensors by pathogen dsDNA
activates STING-dependent signaling to alter gene expression.
When not active, STING is anchored as a homodimer to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Upon detecting patho-
gen dsDNA in the cytoplasm, STING becomes active and is able
to bind TBK1, and together these proteins translocate from the
ER, via the Golgi apparatus, to perinuclear endosomes. Once
Ser366 is phosphorylated by TBK1, STING interacts with and
activates IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 then dissociates from the
STING–TBK1–IRF3 complex to form a homodimer and enter the
nucleus to induce transcription of genes, including type I IFN
genes (reviewed in ref. 5).
However, parasites and other pathogens can target the same
host sensors to promote their own survival6, 7. Even in the case of
the intracellular malaria parasites that invade mammalian red
blood cells (RBC), one study showed that parasite growth requires
STING in immune cells8. That study suggested that Plasmodium
yoelii, a rodent malaria parasite, needs STING to support its
growth in laboratory mice8, and it has also been shown that
immune cell responses to genomic DNA from P. yoelii8 and P.
falciparum9 are STING dependent. Thus STING-dependent
sensing of malaria DNA is important to disease outcome, and
may be considered either immune detection by the host, or
immune escape by the parasite. However, the mechanism by
which parasite genomic material is transferred from infected
RBCs to the cytosol of host immune cells for STING-dependent
sensing is unclear.
One mechanism pathogens utilize to transfer functional
molecules into host cells is the secretion of extracellular vesicles
(EV)10. EVs carry a multitude of proteins, lipids, metabolites and
nucleic acids, which they transfer to target cells by way of fusion,
providing secure and efficient delivery of cellular signals11. EVs
are commonly classified according to their mode of biogenesis.
Microvesicles (MV; 0.3–1 μm in diameter) are derived from the
plasma membrane in response to external or internal stimuli by a
process of evagination and vesicle formation. Exosomes are
smaller in size (50–200 nm in diameter), formed inside multi-
vesicular bodies, and are secreted independent of cell death12.
Owing to their stability, EVs protect their cargo from degradation

 and denaturation in the extracellular environment. Although EVs
from many cell types contain functional proteins13, 14 and RNA11,
15, the extent to which they also contain genomic DNA (gDNA) is
less clear.
Cell-cell communication and sensing extracellular signals is
essential for all living organisms, especially for pathogens16, yet
our understanding of these processes in parasitic protozoa is
limited. This group of parasites is responsible for major diseases,
including malaria, caused by the genus Plasmodium. P. falci-
parum and P. vivax cause most clinical cases of malaria. These
parasites alternate between multiple developmental stages as they
cycle between their mosquito and human hosts, encounter dif-
ferent environments17. Thus, these parasites require a range of
efficient means to alter and even manipulate host responses. In
the human host, blood-stage parasites cause the disease symp-
toms and pathology. The blood cycle is initiated when merozoites,
the free and invasive blood-stage parasites, invade circulating
RBCs. The 48 h asexual blood-stage cycle of P. falciparum
involves differentiation of the invading merozoite through a ring
stage, then trophozoite and schizont developmental forms18.
P. falciparum-infected RBC (iRBC)-derived EVs have a func-
tion in parasite–parasite communication and promote the
differentiation of parasites in recipient cells to gametocytes19, 20.
Malaria parasites also use EVs as a mechanism of intercellular
communication to alter host cell responses21, 22 using human
RNA molecules21, 23.
Individuals infected with P. falciparum or P. vivax have high
circulating levels of platelet-derived and RBC-derived EVs24, 25.
Here, we use nano-tools to study the nucleic acid cargo of
parasite-derived EVs. We provide evidence that EVs released by
P.falciparum parasites contain parasite non-coding RNA and
parasite gDNA. The DNA is secreted via vesicles in a time-
dependent manner, and is only detectable for the first 12 h after
invasion of the RBCs. Our findings outline the process by which
parasitic EV-DNA is transferred into the host cytosol, and
detected by the STING-dependent cytosolic dsDNA sensing
pathway to modulate host gene induction from a distance. We
demonstrate that upon EV uptake, the downstream components
of the STING-dependent pathway, namely TBK1 and IRF3, are
phosphorylated, leading to the translocation of IRF3 into the
nucleus to induce the transcription of host genes. Thus, the
protected genomic DNA within the P. falciparum-derived EVs
stimulates the STING–TBK1–IRF3 axis. Our data explain how
malaria DNA elicits STING-dependent responses.

 Results
Characteristics of vesicles released from P. falciparum-iRBCs.
In previous work, we identified a cell-cell communication pathway
mediated via ‘exosome-like’ nanovesicles released by ring-stage P.
falciparum-iRBCs20. Here we further determine the biophysical
characteristics of the secreted nanovesicles. Cryo-transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) showed these vesicles to be composed
primarily of unilamellar vesicles of 50–300 nm diameter in size;
some possessed double or triple membranes (Fig. 1, bottom left
panel), as was described previously26. Size and population analysis
using nanopore-based particle detection (qNano), revealed a
particle diameter distribution between 50 and 350 nm with a peak
at 107.7 ± 2.1 nm, which corresponds to the typical size of
mammalian exosomes (Fig. 1). qNano measured a broader dia-
meter distribution with higher frequencies (125–225 nm) for
vesicles purified from uninfected RBCs (uRBCs). Vesicles from
uRBCs appear to be less electron-dense by cryo-TEM than those
purified from infected cultures, suggesting the latter carry different
cargo (Fig. 1, upper panel). The extracellular nanovesicles derived
from ring-stage P. falciparum-iRBCs were further characterized by
their buoyant density on an OptiPrep (OP) gradient and were
found in fractions 2–5, between 1.03 and 1.07 g/cm3, which was
similar to previous exosome reports27. Altogether, the morphol-
ogy, size, number of membranes and density indicate that the
nanovesicles released by P. falciparum-iRBCs are biophysically
different to those of uRBC shedding vesicles and similar to those
of mammalian exosomes. Moreover, P. falciparum-iRBCs secrete
vesicles that originate from the cell internal milieu rather than by
shedding of the host cell membrane.
P. falciparum-iRBC EVs contain human and parasite small
RNA. It is well-known that EVs contain nucleic acid cargo28, 29,
therefore we analyzed the genetic cargo protected within P. fal-
ciparum-secreted EVs. Vesicles released by malaria parasites have
been previously shown to contain human non-coding RNA
molecules29. To determine whether EVs secreted from ring-stage
iRBCs also contain parasitic small RNA, we isolated the entire
repertoire of RNA found in P. falciparum-derived EVs and from
uRBC vesicles used as a control. We then assessed the RNA
content using a small RNA Bioanalyser assay (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Our results showed that vesicles from uRBCs were found
to contain little RNA (2.3–5.8 ng per sample) with no distinct
peaks of tRNA or rRNA and low amounts of small RNA between
4–150 nucleotides. However, EVs secreted from P. falciparum-
infected RBCs contained a significant amount of RNA ranging
between 4 and 150 nt (10.2–47.3 ng per sample) with distinct
peaks representing tRNA and potentially 5S RNA.
We performed small RNA deep sequencing to obtain a profile
of the isolated RNA species. As expected, uRBC vesicles displayed
a higher degree of alignment (83.7%) with the H. sapiens genome
(hg19)
as

(57.18%

exhibited an 11.54% alignment with the P. falciparum genome
where most are currently unannotated (Fig. 2a). However, the
most abundant P. falciparum non-coding region was PF13TR011:
ncRNA, found on chromosome 13, with the closest protein
coding region being an uncharacterized protein (MAL13P1.461;
Supplementary Table 2). These non-coding regions were not
predicted to be potential precursors for mature microRNA

 (miRNA) structures. Of note, to our knowledge, this is the first
report of the identification of parasitic RNA delivered in EVs.
The percentage of reads obtained from mapping EV contents
to human microRNA (miRNA) revealed uRBC vesicles contained
a high percentage of miRNA reads (31%) compared to iRBC-
derived EVs (10%). Out of the 229 human miRNA detected, 218
were detected in both uRBC-derived and iRBC-derived vesicles
(Fig. 2b) with the most abundant of all being hsa-miR-451a.
Notably, the majority of the human miRNAs were present at
much lower levels in the iRBC-derived EVs (Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Table 3). Using quantative reverse transcription
PCR (qRT–PCR), we validated that the most significantly
differentiated miRNA are present in iRBC-derived EVs at lower
levels than in vesicles derived from uRBCs (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Importantly, GO enrichment analysis revealed that the
highest number of represented miRNA targets was of the
functional group involved in cell adhesion regulation (Supple-
mentary Table 4). Our Ingenuity Pathway Analysis led to the
identification of seven miRNAs that influence various host cell
adhesion genes, i.e., those encoding the Platelet endothelial cell
adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1), CD36, Vascular cell adhesion
protein 1 (VCAM1), P-selectin, Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-

 1 (ICAM1), E-selectin and Neural cell adhesion molecule
(NCAM-1) host proteins (Fig. 2d). Many of these proteins are
known receptors for PfEMP1-dependant iRBC adhesion factors.
A case in point, VCAM1 is indirectly regulated by TNF30, a
predicted target of miR–19b–3p. These results support a study
indicating that iRBC-derived vesicles carry functional human
regulatory miRNAs to host endothelial cells and regulate VCAM1
expression in a yet unknown mechanism23, 31.
In addition, we detected almost full mRNA coverage of the P.
falciparum gene that encodes the early-transcribed membrane
protein 11.2 (ID PF11_0040; Supplementary Fig. 3). This result
was verified by targeted PCR, which detected the full-length
mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating the presence of intact
parasite mRNA species within EVs.
Ring-stage P. falciparum-iRBC EVs contain parasite gDNA.
We previously demonstrated that malaria parasites secrete vesi-
cles that contain functional nucleic acid material (episomal
plasmids)20. While the actual presence of gDNA in EVs is still
largely undetermined, a few studies in mammals indicate that
living cells release gDNA and even mitochondrial DNA protected
within exosomes32–34, yet the actual function of this gDNA
remains unclear.
We used various approaches to investigate whether P.
falciparum parasites deliver gDNA (i.e., endogenous genes) via
EVs. EVs were collected from a wild-type NF54 strain, stained
with the nucleic acid dye DAPI and imaged with Widefield
Deconvolution Microscopy (WDM, Fig. 3a). A positive DAPI
signal was obtained for iRBC-derived vesicles as compared to
uRBC-derived vesicles. Additional staining with DNA stain
Draq5 (red) and membrane dye Laurdan (blue) confirmed the
co-localization of the DNA with the EVs, suggesting that the
DNA was internal vesicle cargo (Fig. 3b). To ascertain that the
DNA was indeed located within the vesicles, we extensively
treated the EVs with DNase I prior to DNA extraction, as
previously reported33, and then employed the TapeStation DNA
detection assay (Supplementary Fig. 5). This assay led to the
detection of DNA species greater than 15 kb in size — large
enough to encode multiple genes (Supplementary Fig. 5). Using
differential enzymatic digestions, we confirmed these fragments
to be DNA rather than RNA (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 11).
Furthermore, treatment of EVs with DNases that recognize either
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (S1 nuclease) or double-stranded
DNA (DNase I) indicated that most of the DNA was dsDNA
(Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 11). To further characterize the Ev-
DNA, we performed high-throughput whole-genome sequencing
and comparative genomic hybridization analysis on DNase I-
treated EVs. The sequence analysis revealed broadly distributed
regions of the P. falciparum genome, representing sections from
all its chromosomes (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Table 5). Mitochon-
drial DNA has been reported to be present in EVs35, 36. Of note,
mitochondrial and apicoplast genomes were also present at lower
copy numbers in the EVs compared to parental controls
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
Parasite genes are protected within released EVs. We examined
the nuclear, mitochondrial and apicoplast DNA EV content. To
ascertain whether the different DNA species are protected inside
the vesicles, we established a dedicated DNA protection assay. An
external plasmid (PuF-1) was added to highly purified EVs fol-
lowed by DNase I digestion and inactivation. While the external
PuF-1 was digested in the presence of DNase I, the EV-DNA
sequences of selected nuclear (MSP2, ROP14, and GAP40), api-
coplast (SSU-api) and mitochondrial (SSUD) genes remained
protected
and
detectable
by
PCR
amplification
(Fig.
4a,
Supplementary Fig. 11). This result indicates that P. falciparum
genomic and organellar DNA are packaged into and protected
within EVs.
To directly visualize the presence of specific DNA sequences in
EVs, a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based assay was
developed (termed Ev-FISH). EVs were permeabilized with
Equinatoxin II37 and subjected to in situ DNA hybridization
with nuclear, mitochondrial and apicoplast probes (MSP2, SSUD,
and SSU-api, respectively) (Fig. 4b, c). Imaging allowed the direct
detection of Ev-DNA content. While ring-stage-derived EVs were
positive for DAPI, as well as MSP2 (Fig. 4b, e), SSUD and SSU-api
genes (Fig. 4c), no signal was detected for EVs collected from
uRBC vesicles (Fig. 4e). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report of a FISH assay performed on purified vesicles. For
this reason we further assessed the validity of our assay by testing
it on EVs from a parasite line expressing a GFP plasmid
(3D7Emp3-GFP). Both blue and green signals were detected,
corresponding to gDNA and the GFP gene, respectively, whereas
only the signal for gDNA appeared in the parental 3D7 control
(Supplementary Fig. 7), verifying the specificity of the assay. In
conclusion, the molecular assays, imaging and DNA protection
results (Figs. 3 and 4) confirm that P. falciparum-derived EVs
indeed contain gDNA.
Parasite DNA-binding proteins are present in EVs. Western
Blot analysis confirmed the presence of DNA-binding proteins,
parasite histones H3 and H4, in EVs from the active OP density
gradient fractions (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting
that the DNA strands are compacted into nucleosome structural
units within the EVs. Fluorescence immuno-labeling of EVs with
antibodies against H4 (Fig. 4e) enabled detection of parasite
histones within EVs and co-localization with gDNA (blue stain-
ing). gDNA also co-localized with known exosomal marker, SR1
(Sorcin)38 (Fig. 4g).
Parasite gDNA is delivered via EVs only at the ring-stage. Only
vesicles that are produced during the ring stage of the P. falci-
parum cycle were shown to be able to transfer episomal plas-
mids20. Thus, to determine whether the loading of parasite DNA
cargo into EVs and its subsequent delivery occur through a
selective process that reflects parasite biogenesis, we examined the
presence of Ev-DNA in vesicles derived from highly synchronized
parasite cultures collected at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h (h) after invasion
into RBCs. gDNA was found in the EVs collected 12 h post
invasion but was absent from EVs produced at later time points
(Fig. 4f, b) or from gametocytes (not shown). We did, however,
detect the SR1 positive exosomal protein control38 at all time
points (Fig. 4g). This finding indicates that DNA packaging and
delivery via EVs happen only during the early stages following
invasion,
suggesting
the
existence
of
a
time-dependent
mechanism.
Parasite EVs are efficiently internalized by monocytes. Patho-
gens have developed an arsenal of strategies, including the use of
EVs16, 39, for evading and manipulating the immune response, in
particular by directly targeting the sensors involved in nucleic
acid immunity (reviewed in ref. 40). Given the presence of P.
falciparum genomic dsDNA in ring-stage-derived EVs, we
examined the possibility that these parasites alter the innate
immune response by transporting their own DNA species into
the cytosol of immune cells and, thereby, stimulating dsDNA
sensors. We stained P. falciparum-derived EVs for their DNA
(using Hoechst DNA dye), RNA (using Thiazole Orange (TO)
RNA dye) or lipid (using Dil lipid dye) cargo components,
introduced them into monocytes (THP1 cell line) and monitored

 their uptake using image flow cytometry (Fig. 5a, b and
Supplementary Fig. 8). We were able to detect the EVs’ nucleic
acid (Fig. 5) and lipid (Supplementary Fig. 8) cargo within the
cytosol of the recipient monocyte cells upon internalization of the
vesicles.
Remarkably, the parasite-derived EVs exhibit a significantly
higher level of intake by monocytes as compared to vesicles
derived from uRBCs (Fig. 5c, d and Supplementary Fig. 8A). The
internalization of the EVs, however, could be detected only under
physiological condition at 37 °C (Fig. 5c, d). These results were
further verified by tracking P. falciparum-EV intake by human
monocytes extracted from PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear
cells), gained from nine healthy donors (Fig. 5e). Moreover, by
performing live kinetic measurement, using IFC, we were able to
monitor the dynamics of the DNA cargo distribution within
monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 9). Labeled EVs were added to live
THP1 cells and the derived signal was read continuously (after a
90–150 s loading time) by IFC for 45 min. As demonstrated, the
transferred DNA signal intensity in the cells increased with time,
indicating progressive uptake of the P. falciparum-labeled EVs by
monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 9A, B). Within the first 15 min,
the DNA signal appears as clear bright spots inside the cells,
followed by a signal that progressively disperses through the cell
(Supplementary Fig. 9C), suggesting that the DNA cargo’s
destination is the cytosolic milieu.
Together, these data indicate that vesicles secreted by the
parasite exhibit a significant advantage to allow uptake by
monocytes and are able to deliver their nucleic acid cargo into the
cytosol of host immune cells.
Parasite EV-DNA activates an innate immune response. The
fact that the destination of the EV-DNA cargo is the monocyte’s
cytosol provided a rationale as to how malaria DNA might gain
access to DNA sensing pathways in immune cells such as
monocytes, which is an unanswered question to date. To explore
this possibility, monocytes (THP-1 cells) were treated with P.
falciparum EVs derived from ring-stage (vesicles containing
parasitic DNA; Fig. 6a blue bars) or trophozoite-stage (vesicles
lacking parasitic DNA; Fig. 6a red bars). We then examined the
ability of THP-1 cells to produce cytokines including IFNs that
are typical of a DNA sensing response. Thus, at various points in
time over the course of 24 h (30 min, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h) mRNA
induction of CCL5, CXCL10, and IFNα (primers detect multiple
isoforms of IFNα), IFNB and IFIT1 (an IFN-stimulated gene) was
measured (Fig. 6a). Notably, the mRNA levels of all five gene
products were significantly induced upon intake of ring-stage P.
falciparum-derived EVs (Fig. 6a, blue bars). At the same time,
intake of trophozite-stage P. falciparum-derived EVs did not
substantially increase mRNA induction from these genes (Fig. 6a,

 red bars), nor were they affected by vesicles derived from uRBCs
(Fig. 6a, black bars). These results indicate that the recipient
monocytes sense the transferred P. falciparum EV-DNA within
their cytosol and, as a consequence, activate their response. Our
findings were also confirmed by the analysis of the secretion levels
of RANTES (as measured by ELISA) and of type I IFN (as
measured by bioassay) treated with vesicles derived from ring-
stage iRBCs, trophozoite-stage iRBCs and uRBCs (Fig. 6b).
Importantly, the induction of CCL5, CXCL10, IFNα, IFNB, and
IFIT1 mRNA was also confirmed using primary monocytes
obtained from three healthy donors (Fig. 6c).
Next, we tested whether external parasite gDNA, rather than
actively transferred gDNA, could be detected by monocytes and,
as a result, stimulate a type I IFN response from the outside. We
added naked P. falciparum gDNA (1 µg ml−1) to the media of
growing monocytes. After 24 h, cells were collected and the
mRNA levels of CCL5, CXCL10, IFNΑ, IFNB and IFIT1 were
measured (Fig. 7a). As seen in Fig. 7a, much lower mRNA
induction was detected in cells treated with naked P. falciparum
DNA (Fig. 7a, purple bars) compared to the strong mRNA
induction
seen
when
monocytes
were
transfected
with
lipofectamine-containing P. falciparum gDNA (Fig. 7a, green
bars). These results were confirmed by the secretion levels of
CCL5 and of type I IFN (Fig. 7c). The data for transfected P.
falciparum gDNA exhibited a similar pattern of response to that
observed following treatment with ring-stage P. falciparum-
derived EVs (Fig. 6a, b). Furthermore, the observed immune
response patterns to the insertion of P. falciparum DNA, either
via transfection or EVs, is typical of a DNA sensing response in
THP-1 cells41, 42 and resembled the response of THP-1 cells to
(poly(dA:dT) (Fig. 7b, d), which stimulates STING-dependent
DNA sensing pathways in these cells.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that parasite-DNA-
carrying vesicles can be internalized into monocytes to elicit an
innate immune cytokine response.
STING is required for EV-DNA-dependent gene induction.
Having established the effect of EV-DNA within monocytes, we
wanted to establish whether the host response to the P. falci-
parum EV-DNA was indeed STING-dependent since it was
previously reported that STING serves as an essential target for
the development of malaria parasites8, yet the mechanism by
which the parasites activate the pathway by inserting its DNA
into immune cells while growing within RBCs was not deter-
mined. Also naked gDNA (that may be released by parasite egress
or lysis) added directly to cells led to a significantly lower cyto-
kine response (Fig. 7), consistent with the requirement for
intracellular cytosolic sensing. In order to determine whether
STING has an essential role in the response for the recognition of
EV-DNA, we used STING knockout (KO) THP-1 cells generated
by the CRISPR/Cas9 system which were shown to be impaired in
their ability to respond to cytosolic DNA, while their response to
RNA was intact43. Upon P. falciparum-derived EV intake by the
cells, mRNA induction responses were examined in a similar
manner to that described above. Compellingly, although control
THP-1 cells displayed robust induction of CCL5, IFNα, IFNB and
CXCL10 mRNA after P. falciparum-EV intake (Fig. 8a, blue bars),
these responses were completely absent in STING KO cells
(Fig. 8a, orange bars), similar to the responses to control vesicles

 collected from uRBCs (Fig. 8a, black bars). Similar results were
obtained when CCL5 or type I IFN production from control and
STING KO THP-1s were measured (Fig. 8b, blue vs orange bars).
Together, these findings indicate that STING plays a key role in
type I IFN response to transferred P. falciparum DNA.
TBK1 and IRF3 are activated after parasite-derived-EV intake.
The protein kinase TBK1 and the transcription factor IRF3 are
essential downstream components of the STING-dependent type
I IFN response. In unstimulated cells, both TBK1 and IRF3 are
inactive in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation by microbial dsDNA,
however, cGAMP produced from cGAS binds STING, located on
the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, leading to the recruitment
of TBK1 to STING, and phosphorylation of TBK1 (pTBK1).
pTBK1, in turn, then directly phosphorylates IRF3 (pIRF3),
leading to the latter’s translocation to the nucleus and stimulation
of IFNβ induction44, 45. Thus, to further confirm that STING
signaling is indeed activated by P. falciparum-EV uptake we
examined whether TBK1 and IRF3 are activated and undergo
phosphorylation due to P. falciparum-EV internalization. For
this, we utilized an antibody specific for phosphorylated TBK1 at
Ser172 (αp-TBK1) and an antibody against Ser396-IRF3. The
treatment of THP1 cells with P. falciparum-ring-derived EVs or
transfected poly(dA:dT) as a positive control induced the phos-
phorylation of both TBK1 and IRF3 (Fig. 8c, Supplementary
Fig. 11). In contrast, phosphorylation of TBK1 was not observed
when naked P. falciparum dsDNA was added directly to mono-
cytes (Fig. 8c, Supplementary Fig. 11).
As phosphorylated IRF3 dissociates from the STING-TBK1-IRF3
complex and enters the nucleus to induce the transcription of type I
IFNs44, 45 we monitored the subcellular localization of phosphory-
lated IRF3 following the internalization of P. falciparum-EVs by
subcellular fractionation (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11) and
confocal microscopy (Fig. 8d). Indeed, as seen in Fig. 8d (upper
panel), the phosphorylated IRF3 localizes to the nucleus upon
treatment with P. falciparum-EVs and was detected in the nuclear
fraction using WB analysis (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).
Together, these results demonstrate that malaria DNA-
containing P. falciparum-EVs gain access to the cytosol of innate

Discussion
The dynamic interplay between pathogens and their host is one of
the most complicated themes in infectious disease progression.
Pathogens excel in developing different means to facilitate cell-
cell communication via, among other methods, secreted vesicles.
EVs are vehicles that shuttle bioactive molecules between cells
and they play an important role in many biological processes,
while various pathogens utilize the exosomal pathway for their
own benefits16. We have previously shown that P. falciparum
parasites use vesicles to exchange active recombinant genes
among them20. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the
genetic material protected within vesicles released by wild-type P.
falciparum strains, revealing that the malaria parasite delivers
small non-coding RNAs and gDNA material that spans all its
chromosomes, and also includes mitochondrial and apicoplast
DNA. We further showed that the cytosolic immune machinery
specifically senses the parasitic DNA via STING pathway.
The parasitic EV-DNA is released within the first 12 h post
invasion, a stage in which the parasites do not yet replicate their
DNA, suggesting that DNA packaging and delivery requires
specific machinery. While the origin of the reserve DNA species
during the early-stage of the parasite development is currently not
clear (perhaps DNA remains that are carried by the invading
merozoites), our findings are reminiscent of other exosome stu-
dies of mammalian cells demonstrating that the exosomal DNA
represents the nuclear32, 33 and mitochondrial36 genomes. Cur-
rently, it is difficult to estimate the stoichiometry of DNA per EV,
mainly as there is no reliable technique for separating the two
types of vesicles in the samples those released from infected and
from uninfected RBCs. Although further research needs to be
pursued in order to understand how gDNA species are loaded
into the EVs, the results of this study shed light on the previously
reported finding that the ring stage in the parasite blood cycle is
the critical stage for plasmid transfer between parasites20. For the
parasite, export of gDNA protected within vesicles may also serve
as a method for horizontal gene transfer46, 47.
Innate immune sensing of both host and pathogen DNA is
known to contribute to disease outcomes. Cells release DNA as a
defense mechanism against danger, as does the microorganism
Prochlorococcus, which releases its gDNA in vesicles48 and even
fragments of host gDNA49 or mitochondrial DNA50. For malaria,
responses of immune cells to genomic DNA from P. yoelii8 and P.
falciparum9 were shown to be STING dependent.
Since malaria parasites face hostile environments in their
complex life cycle, they must develop an ability to alter the host
immune system. One line of reasoning suggests that innate sen-
sing of malaria DNA by STING-dependent pathways favors the
parasite and represents immune subversion, as is the case for
other non-viral pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus51–53. P. yoelii, a
rodent malaria parasite, requires STING to support its growth in
laboratory mice8, although the relevance of this to human malaria
remains unclear. Malaria DNA has also been shown to be sensed
by endosomal TLR9, which is expressed on pDCs, via a
mechanism whereby malaria hemozoin targets the DNA to
TLR9-positive endosomes54. Further, TLR9 has been shown to be
essential for the development of protective immunity to P. yoelii
in laboratory mice55. Thus for P. yoelii in laboratory mice, TLR9-
dependent DNA detection is beneficial to the host, whereas
STING-dependent DNA detection favors the parasite.
Whether STING-dependent sensing represents a pathogen
decoy mechanism, and/or host detection of the pathogen requires
further investigation for human malaria, but overall STING is
likely to be important in defining disease outcomes. However, up
to now it was unclear how malaria DNA gains access to cytosolic
dsDNA sensing pathways that utilize STING in immune cells.
Thus, we show that malaria DNA-containing P. falciparum-
derived EVs gain access to the cytosol of monocytes and stimulate
STING-TBK1-IRF3-dependent gene induction. Our finding pro-
vides a mechanistic explanation for host sensing of malaria DNA.
Interestingly, innate detection of pathogen nucleic acid by
transfer into immune cells via exosomes was also shown for
Epstein Barr virus56. There, cells latently infected with EBV
triggered anti-viral immunity in neighboring DCs due to transfer
of viral RNA via exosomes. Yu et al.8 showed that removal of
STING in vivo increases resistance of mice to P. yoelii, and that
STING activation in pDCs downregulates TLR-dependent type I
IFN responses via SOCS1. Thus it is possible that P. falciparum
EVs if taken up by human pDCs would activate STING, which
could amount to an immune subversion mechanism. However, as
in the case of EBV, P. falciparum nucleic acid sensing at a dis-
tance by immune cells may represent a normal function of host
immunity.
One of the major outcomes of malarial activation of nuclei acid
sensing PRRs, including STING, is induction of type I IFNs. For
example, Yu et al.8 showed that early release of low levels of type I
IFN favor host resistance to P. yoelii, while Wu et al.57 deter-
mined that a strong type I IFN response to P. yoelii, that was
dependent on RNA-sensing RIG-I-like receptors, contributed to a
decline in parasitemia over time. Sharma et al.9 showed that later
release of high levels of type I IFN in response to P. berghei
caused pathology and death, while another study showed that in
P. berghei- infected mice, type I IFN signaling impaired Th1-
dependent malaria immunity58. In contrast, a RIG-I-like receptor
response to P. berghei RNA in infected mice was shown to be
critical for host resistance to liver-stage plasmodium infection59.
In humans, blood-stage P. falciparum infection induced type I
IFN induction, leading to inhibition of innate and adaptive
immune responses60. Thus, the relationship between type I IFN
and protective vs pathological outcomes in malaria infection is
complex and requires further investigation.
Apart from DNA, here, we demonstrate that the EVs released
by P. falciparum-iRBCs contain not only human RNA species, as
previously reported31, but also small parasitic non-coding RNA
molecules, similar to vesicles secreted by other pathogens16, 28, 61.
Although we showed that the response of human monocytes to P.
falciparum ring-stage vesicles, in terms of induction of type I
IFNs and chemokines, was entirely STING-dependent (Fig. 7a, b),
it is possible that host sensing of EV-RNAs also contributes to the
immune response to P. falciparum. For example, EV-RNAs could
be detected by TLR7 or TLR8 on certain host cells62. The pre-
sence of RNA species in P. falciparum-derived EVs provides a
new perspective as to other potential means whereby the parasite
can manipulate the host milieu. The miRNA and mRNA carried
and delivered by secreted vesicles can control gene expression in
recipient cells29, 63. We detected a significant population of P.
falciparum non-coding RNAs in EVs, though the potential
function of these molecules remains unknown. In addition, the
predicted targets of the human miRNAs within the vesicles are
genes involved in cell adhesion regulation, including VCAM1,
CD36 and ICAM1 receptors, to which different forms of the
virulence protein family PfEMP1 bind64, 65. These results strongly
support the work published showing that P. falciparum-derived
vesicles not only target endothelial cells and deliver functional
miR-451a-Argonaute2 complexes (RISC) but that the RNA
delivery results in elevation of a number of transcripts of the

may serve as a sensing signal in a population to coordinate
parasite social interactions16, thus potentially playing a role in

observed19, 20.
In summary, we show that malaria parasites secrete EVs con-
taining both parasitic RNA and DNA, and we demonstrate a
novel mechanism by which parasitic DNA enters monocytes to
modify the STING pathway response. Our comprehensive iden-
tification of the molecular cargo transferred by P. falciparum-
derived EVs significantly enhances knowledge as to their potential
in intercellular signaling and elicits key questions relating to
parasite survival and malaria pathogenesis.
Methods
Cell culture. The monocytic cell line THP-166, commonly used in innate DNA
sensing studies, was used. The STING knockout THP-1 cell line was generated by
the CRISPR/Cas9 system43.
Parasite lines used were CS2eBsdGFP, 3D7edhfrGFP20, NF54 (generously
provided by Malaria Research Reference Reagent Resource Center (MR4)), CS2
and 3D7. P. falciparum: Parasites were grown in pooled donor RBCs provided by
the Israeli blood bank (Magen David Adom blood donations in Israel) at 4%
hematocrit, and incubated at 37 °C in gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2 in N2.
Parasites were maintained in RPMI medium pH 7.4, 25 mg/ml HEPES, 50 μg/ml
hypoxanthine, 2 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 20 μg/ml gentamycin and 0.5%
AlbumaxII. P. falciparum cultures and human cell lines (THP1) were tested for
mycoplasma once a month using commercial kits; MycoAlert Plus Kit (Lonza) or
Mycoplasma Detection Kit—QuickTest (Tivanbiotech),
Primary monocyte isolation- Naïve PBMCs (obtained from Magen David
Adom blood donations in Israel) were collected from three healthy donors. CD14
+ cells were isolated from the PBMCs by magnetic separation using CD14
MicroBeads and an LS column (MACS Miltenyi Biotech lnc). 1 × 106 CD14+ cells
were plated per well. The cells were incubated with P. falciparum-iRBC ring stage-
derived vesicles or uRBC-derived vesicles for 1,6,24 h and were compared to the
untreated CD14 + cells.
Purification of extracellular vesicles. Briefly, infected or uninfected RBC growth
media was collected and cellular debris removed by centrifugation at 1500 r.p.m.,
3000 r.p.m. and 10,000 r.p.m. The supernatant was concentrated using a Vivaflow
100,000 MWCO PES (Sartorious Stedium) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet
nanovesicles. OptiPrep density gradient was performed as previously described20;
OptiPrep velocity gradient purification—the initial vesicle pellet was resuspended
in 2 ml incomplete media and further purified on a 10-ml continuous 10–30%
Optiprep gradient made up in NTE buffer (137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 10
mM Tris, pH 7.4), 250,000 g, 14 h, 4 °C, in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA, USA). Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top.
DNA isolation and analysis. Nanovesicle pellets from 100 mL of culture were
washed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with DNase I (Ambion). The
enzyme was then inactivated (75 °C for 15 min), followed by acid-phenol:chloro-
form extraction.
RNase and DNase digestion. DNA was extracted using acid-phenol:chloroform
as previously described67. EV-DNA or 3D7 gDNA were equally distributed and
subjected to S1 nuclease, DNase or RNase A (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. For
the DNA protection assay, 25 pg of plasmid DNA PuF was added prior to DNase I
treatment.
Parasite EV time course. CS2 parasites were grown to the late trophozoite/early
schizont stage. The iRBCs were purified using a magnetized MACS column. Bound
iRBC were eluted and added to fresh uRBCs. Culture was incubated on a shaker at
37 °C for 4 h to allow invasion. Remaining trophozoites/schizonts were lysed using
5% sorbitol. The culture containing early rings (0–4 h post invasion) at 5% para-
sitaemia and 4% hematocrit was washed twice with RPMI-HEPES and incubated at
37 °C. Culture supernatant was collected at 12 h intervals. After each collection,
parasites were washed twice with RPMI-HEPES prior to addition of fresh medium.
EVs were extracted from collected culture supernatant.
Cryo-electron microscopy. Cryo-TEM was performed as described previously26
with a Tecnai G2 F30 (FEI) transmission electron microscope operating at 300 kV
with defocus between 10 and 16 μm across ×15,000 to ×39,000 magnification.
RNA sequencing analysis. RNA sequences were analyzed for quality control using
FASTQC and the Torrent Suite 3.4.1. Output files (*.bam) were uploaded and
aligned to the H. sapiens genome (hg19) using Bowtie 2, using Partek Flow (Partek
Incorporated, Singapore). Remaining unaligned reads were passed through for a
second alignment with the P. falciparum 3D7 genome (ASM276v1) using Partek
Flow. All aligned files were then analyzed using Partek Genomic Suite software
(Partek Incorporated, Singapore). Sequences aligned to HG19 were mapped to
miRBase_v.20, Ensembl v74 and tRNAscan-SE. Sequences aligned to ASM276v1
were mapped using annotations from EnsemblProtist (ASM276v1, INSDC
Assembly GCA_000002765.1, non-coding and protein coding annotations) and
tRNAscan-SE. Reads were normalized to reads-per-million, calculated as follows:
Number of sequenced reads/total reads × 1,000,000 normalized using linear gen-
eralized modeling. Low-abundant miRNAs with less than 10 read counts across all
samples were removed and highly abundant miRNAs further analyzed. Differential
analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite using the statistical
functions. Selection of miRNAs was based upon ANOVA comparing infected
vesicles with uninfected vesicles. Significant changes in miRNA expression were
expressed in fold change (LOG2) and defined as (inf-ex vs uninf-v) p ≤ 0.05 and
± 2.0 fold change.
Validation of EV-miRNA by RT–PCR. Additional samples were collected for
validation and RNA was isolated as mentioned above using the miRNeasy kit
(Qiagen). RNA (1 ng) was reverse transcribed to cDNA (TaqMan MicroRNA
Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems, Australia) according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol with a primer pool containing all miRNA assays (TaqMan
microRNA assays, 5×, Applied Biosystems). Sixteen assays, which included 12
targets and 2 additional assays (hsa-miR-144–3p, hsa-miR–19b–3p, see Supple-
mentary Table 6 for assay IDs), were pooled in order to serve as possible nor-
malization controls. The cDNA samples were pre-amplified (TaqMan PreAmp
Master Mix Kit, Applied Biosystems) and qRT–PCR (TaqMan Fast Advanced
Master Mix, Applied Biosystems) was performed using individual miRNA assays
(TaqMan microRNA assays, 20×, Applied Biosystems) and run on the ViiA 7 Real-
Time PCR System (Life Technologies). Reverse transcription and pre-amplification
no template controls using primer pools and individual assays were also prepared
to ensure there was no background amplification of miRNA assays. Raw Ct data
was uploaded to DataAssist (Applied Biosystems) to calculate delta delta Ct
(ΔΔCt) using appropriate normalization methods68 calculated by DataAssist by
Applied Biosystems.
Library preparation and genome sequencing. EV-DNA was prepared and
indexed for Illumina sequencing using the TruSeq® DNA LT Sample Prep Kit
v2–Set A (Illumina, FC–121–2001). The library was quantified using the Agilent
2200 TapeStation. Indexed libraries were then prepared for paired end sequencing
on a HiSeq instrument using the v3 100 cycle kit (Illumina).
DNA sequencing analysis. Sequence data quality was assessed using FastQC. A
laboratory strain of P. falciparum 3D7 isolated from erythrocytes was used as
control. Sequence reads from the EVs and control were aligned to the P. falciparum
3D7 reference genome (PlasmoDB v 10.0)69 using Bowtie 2 (v2.1.0)70 with options
“--very-sensitive-local --minins 100 --maxins 800.” PCR duplicates were removed
using Picard MarkDuplicates (picard.sourceforge.net). Local read depth was cal-
culated by counting aligned reads starting in contiguous 5 kb windows and was
normalized by dividing by the total count for the genome. The relative fold change
in copy number was estimated by the ratio of EV to control read depth, normalized
for library size, in each window:
CNi ¼ ne;i þ 1
P
i ne;i
= nc;i þ 1
P
i nc;i
ð1Þ
where CNi is copy number ratio for bin i, ne;i is the number of EV reads starting in
bin i, and nc;i is the number of control sample reads starting in bin i.
EV RNA isolation and analysis. Nanovesicle pellet from 100 ml was washed in
PBS and total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen). RNA yield,
composition and quality were analyzed by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser using the
Small RNA Kit (Agilent). For RNA sequencing analysis and validation of miRNA
by RT–PCR, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Scanning ion occlusion sensing analysis. Scanning ion occlusion sensing analysis
was performed using the qNano system (Izon, Christchurch, New Zealand).
Sample size distributions were calibrated by Izon Control Suite 2.2 using calibra-
tion particles of 100, 200, and 400 nm in size.
Nanosight particle analysis. Vesicle size distribution and concentration was
performed using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) (Malvern Instruments,
Nanosight NS300). Sample size distributions were calibrated in a liquid suspension
by the analysis of Brownian motion via light scattering. Nanosight provides single
particle size and concentration measurements.

 centromere protein A (CenPA) (or anti-histone H3) antibody was generated by
cloning the 5′ 193 nucleotides of the histone H3 gene (PF13_0185) into the pGEX4
T expression vector to produce a GST fusion protein in BL21 cells. Rabbits were
immunized with the fusion protein and antibodies were purified by affinity
chromatography71. Histone H4 (Abcam, ab16483, 1:1000). Anti-rabbit antibodies
against STING pathway proteins; pIRF3 (CST, mAb #29047 1:250), pTBK1 (CST,
mAb #5483 1:1000) and STING (CST, mAb #13647 1:1000) and Lamin (nuclear
control, CST mAb #12255 1:1000) were obtained commercially (Cell Signaling).
Antibodies against actin (AAS69609C1:1000), Anti-rabbit antibody against
Tubulin (AAS12651C 1:1000) were obtained commercially (ANTYBODY VER-
IFY). Full-length uncropped blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 11.
Immunofluorescence. AlexaFluor488 secondary anti-mouse antibody, goat anti-
human biotin conjugate antibody and streptavidin-Cy5 were purchased from Life
Technologies and Abcam. Purified EVs were fixed by adapting standard methods72
in the following way: Coverslips (Menzel-Glaeser) washed with water (2×), ethanol
(1×), water (2×) and methanol (1×) were carefully flame dried. Volumes (10–40 μl)
of EVs resuspended in PBS were applied to the coverslips and left to air dry before
dipping them in cold methanol. Samples were blocked with filtered 3% BSA
(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h. Primary antibodies in 3% BSA PBS were incubated
for 1 h and washed five times for 5 min with 3% BSA PBS. Secondary antibodies,
also in 3% BSA PBS, were incubated for 45 min and then washed five times for 5
min with 3% BSA PBS. Prior to imaging, coverslips were air dried and 5 μl of
mounting medium with DAPI (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories) was applied
before sealing them on microscope slides with nail polish. Sorcin-SR1was obtained
commercially (Abcam).
Widefield deconvolution microscopy. Vesicle immuno or FISH labeled were
imaged by WDM (ex-em wavelengths: DAPI 381/99–435/48, FITC 461/89–523/36,
Alexa647 and Draq5 621/43–676/34) with a 100×/1.4 Oil immersion objective on a
Deltavision Elite microscope (Applied Precision, USA). Z-stacks were captured
with a 200 nm step interval and then deconvolved using SoftWorx (Applied Pre-
cision, GE Healthcare), which uses a constrained iterative deconvolution algorithm.
Measurements undertaken on sub-resolution beads (~170 nm) on the DAPI
channel (ex-em 381/99–435/48 nm) using WDM determined a resolution of 215
nm in xy and 500 nm in z dimension for this channel.
EV fluorescent in situ hybridization. The EV-FISH preparation was developed as
a new protocol for gene in situ detection in EVs. We generated fluorescence-labeled
probes (Fluorescein) for the gfp, msp2, SSUD and SSU-Api genes using the Label
IT Nucleic Acid Labeling kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer
(Mirus, MIR 3225). Briefly, probes were made by PCR from 3D7 WT gDNA for
gfp, msp2, SSUD and SSU-Api using Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche,
3300226) with 0.3 M primers in a 50 μl reaction. The cycling parameters were as
follows: 95 °C for 45 sec, 55 °C for 45 s, 64 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles. The labeling
reaction, using the Label IT kit, was performed by mixing 40 μl of each PCR
reaction (100 ng/μl) with 5 μl 10× Buffer and 5 μl Label IT Reagent (Mirus, MIR
3225). All other steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.
Parasite-derived EVs were permeabilized with equinatoxin II (EqtII) in 1X SSPE
(150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA) in a final volume of 50 μl for 5
min at room temperature. Fluorescence-labeled PCR probes were denatured in a
HS solution (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2XSSPE, 250 μg Herring sperm
DNA) at 95 °C in a final volume of 50 μl for 5 min. EVs were mixed with denatured
probes at a 1:1 ratio and incubated at 95 °C for 2 min in a final volume of 100 μl.
Hybridization was performed overnight at 37 °C on a coverslip sealed with a
GeneFrame (ThermoScientific, AB-0576). Following three washes with 1XSSPE,
the GeneFrames were removed and the coverslips were mounted onto slides in
Vectashield with DAPI (Vector, H-1500) and analyzed by confocal microscopy
using a DeltaVision OMX V4 Blaze 3D Structured Illumination Microscopy (3D-
SIM) System (Applied Precision).
Vesicle intake by THP-1 cells or PBMCs. Vesicles were purified from P. falci-
parum-iRBCs or uRBCs culture and were stained using Thiazole Orange (TO; for
RNA content), Hoechst (HO; for DNA content) or Dil (for lipid content). THP-1
cells or naïve PBMCs (obtained from blood donors of Magen David Adom in
Israel) were stimulated with equal amounts of EVs, as were measured by Nano-
sight, (Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) Malvern Instruments Ltd.). ~5 × 106
EVs per 1 × 106 cells for 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Vesicle intake was detected by
image stream flow cytometry (IFC).
Image stream analysis. Cells were imaged using a multispectral IFC (ImageS-
treamX mark II imaging flow-cytometer; Amnis Corp, Seattle, WA, Part of EMD
Millipore). For direct vesicle intake measurements, vesicles were labeled and equal
amounts were imaged. The ImageStreamX uses calibration beads 3μm in diameter
for measuring focus and flow speed. To exclude these beads from the acquisition,
objects were gated according to their area and intensity of the side scatter channel
(Ch06) and the uniform bead population was easily identified and eliminated. For
live kinetics, labeled EVs were added to THP1 cells and immediately acquired, for a
period of 45 min (following a 90–150 s gap for sample introduction into the
instrument). At least 5 × 104 cells were collected from each sample and data were
analyzed using the manufacturer’s image analysis software (IDEAS 6.2; Amnis
Corp). Images were compensated for fluorescent dye overlap using single-stain
controls. THP1 cells were gated for single cells, using the area and aspect ratio
features, and for focused cells, using the Gradient RMS feature, as previously
described85. Cropped cells were further eliminated by plotting the cell area of the
bright field image against the Centroid X feature (the number of pixels in the
horizontal axis from the left corner of the image to the center of the cell mask).
Vesicle internalization was evaluated by using several features, including the
intensity (the sum of the background-subtracted pixel values within the masked
area of the image) and the max pixel (the largest value of the background-
subtracted pixel).
Real-time PCR. Type I IFN, CCL5, CXCL10 and IFIT1 gene expression was
determined by real-time PCR, using SYBR-fast green detection systems (Applied
Biosystems). Expression levels were normalized to HTRP expression. The data are
presented as the fold induction over untreated controls for each phenotype. Data
represent the mean 9 SD from either biological replicates or technical replicates.
The following PCR primers were used: IFNB: forward, 5′-CTGCATTACCT-
GAAGGCCAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTGAAGCAATTGTCCAGTCCC-3′; IFNα (to
detect multiple isoforms): forward, 5′-TGAAGGACAGACATGACTTTGG-3′ and
reverse, 5′-TCCTTTGTCCTGAAGAGATTGA-3′; CCL5: forward, 5′-TCATTGC-
TACTGCCCTCTGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCCTTGACCTGTGGACGACT-3′
CXCL10: forward, 5′-GGCAATCAAGGAGTACCTCTCT-3′ and reverse, 5′-
GCAATGATCTCAACACGTGGAC-3′; IFIT1: forward, 5′-CAC-
CATTGGCTGCTGTTTAGCTCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGCAGCCGTTCTG-
CAGGGTTT-3′; HRPT: forward, 5′-CCTGGCGTCGTGATTAGTGAT-3′ and
reverse, 5′-AGACGTTCAGTCCTGTCCATA-3′
Confocal microscopy. For the visualization of STING, pIRF3 and pTBK1: Fol-
lowing incubation with P. falciparum-derived EVs, cells were fixed and permea-
bilized with 4% PFA and 2% Sucrose at 4 ˚C and were labeled with antibodies
against STING, pIRF3 or pTBK1. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 710
confocal microscope, using a 60× oil objective. Image processing was performed
using Zen 2010 (Zeiss) and ImageJ. All images are representative of at least three
independent experiments.
Measurement of cytokine production from monocytes. CXCL10 and CCL5 were
measured by ELISA according to manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems)73,
while type I IFN production was measured by bioassay, using HEK Blue IFN-α/β
reporter cells (InvivoGen).
Cytosolic and nuclear fractionation. Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear frac-
tions were performed as previously described74.
Following treatment by Pf-EVs, cells were washed three times with ice-cold
PBS, resuspended in three volumes of cold cell disruption buffer (KCl 10 mM,
MgCl2 1.5 mM, Tris-Cl 20 mM and DTT 1 Mm) and incubate for 10 min on ice.
Cells were transferred into a baked Dounce homogenizer and were homogenized
using ~30 strokes with a baked, type B pestle. The homogenate was transfer into a
fresh tube and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cell nuclear fraction was isolated by
centrifuging the homogenate at 1500 g for 5 min, the supernatant (containing the
cytoplasmic fraction) was transferred into a new tube containing RIPA buffer
(NaCl 150 mM, EDTA pH 8.0 5 mM, Tris, pH 8.0 50 mM, NP-40 1.0%, sodium
deoxycholate 0.5% and SDS 0.1%) and protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340).
The nuclear fraction (pellet) was washed three times with PBS and resuspended in
RIPA containing protease inhibitor. Both fractions were further analyzed by WB.
