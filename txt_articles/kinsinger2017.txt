IMPORTANCE The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer
screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography for current and former heavy smokers
aged 55 to 80 years. There is little published experience regarding implementing this
recommendation in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVES To describe organizational- and patient-level experiences with implementing an
LCS program in selected Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals and to estimate the
number of VHA patients who may be candidates for LCS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This clinical demonstration project was conducted at 8
academic VHA hospitals among 93 033 primary care patients who were assessed on
screening criteria; 2106 patients underwent LCS between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Implementation Guide and support, full-time LCS coordinators, electronic
tools, tracking database, patient education materials, and radiologic and nodule follow-up
guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Description of implementation processes; percentages of
patients who agreed to undergo LCS, had positive findings on results of low-dose computed
tomographic scans (nodules to be tracked or suspicious findings), were found to have lung
cancer, or had incidental findings; and estimated number of VHA patients who met the
criteria for LCS.
RESULTS Of the 4246 patients who met the criteria for LCS, 2452 (57.7%) agreed to undergo
screening and 2106 (2028 men and 78 women; mean [SD] age, 64.9 [5.1] years) underwent
LCS. Wide variation in processes and patient experiences occurred among the 8 sites. Of the
2106 patients screened, 1257 (59.7%) had nodules; 1184 of these patients (56.2%) required
tracking, 42 (2.0%) required further evaluation but the findings were not cancer, and 31
(1.5%) had lung cancer. A variety of incidental findings, such as emphysema, other pulmonary
abnormalities, and coronary artery calcification, were noted on the scans of 857 patients
(40.7%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE It is estimated that nearly 900 000 of a population of 6.7
million VHA patients met the criteria for LCS. Implementation of LCS in the VHA will likely lead
to large numbers of patients eligible for LCS and will require substantial clinical effort for both
patients and staff.

findings in community practice as a reason not to recommend
screening,4 and primary care physicians and pulmonologists
have questioned practical aspects of implementing LCS in
practice.5,6 Although guidelines about components of high-
quality screening programs have been issued,7-9 published ex-
perience with implementation of LCS is limited.10
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides care
for 6.7 million mostly older male US veterans each year,11 many
of whom are current or former smokers12 but who also have
multiple medical conditions.13,14 Implementation of an LCS
program for VHA patients would potentially require substan-
tial resources and effort by clinical staff and facilities for an un-
certain benefit of reduced mortality from lung cancer.
To understand the feasibility and implications for VHA pa-
tients and clinical staff of programmatic LCS, the VHA imple-
mented a 3-year Lung Cancer Screening Demonstration Proj-
ect (LCSDP) in 8 geographically diverse hospitals.15,16 The
specific goals were to describe the organizational effort and re-
sources needed to implement a comprehensive LCS pro-
gram, patient interest in and acceptance of screening, and the
clinical experience of patients who underwent LCS in terms
of positive test results, lung cancers detected, and incidental
findings. We also wanted to estimate the size of the VHA popu-
lation that potentially meets eligibility criteria for LCS. This ar-
ticle describes the initial experience of the LCSDP toward these
goals.
Methods
Site Selection
The 8 sites, all academic medical centers, were chosen from
35 facilities that volunteered for the demonstration project
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Selection criteria included hav-
ing strong support from facility leadership, clinical champi-
ons,anonsiteCTscannerandradiologist(preferablywithtrain-
ing in chest radiology), a multidisciplinary lung cancer
program, and a tobacco cessation program.
Project Design and Patient Criteria
The LCSDP was designed as a population-based screening pro-
gram that proactively identified appropriate patients at the 8
sites for consideration of LCS. First, those aged 55 to 80 years
without a diagnosis of esophageal, liver, or pancreatic cancer
(following standard VHA protocol) or lung cancer and with-
out a documented estimated life expectancy of fewer than 6
months were identified by an algorithm applied to the VHA
electronic medical record. Nurses then reviewed those pa-
tients’smoking histories to identify current or former (quit less
than 15 years ago) cigarette smokers who had smoked a mini-
mum of 30 pack-years (number of packs per day multiplied by
number of years smoked). Based on clinical judgment, pa-
tients’primary care professionals excluded those who met ini-
tial criteria but who had competing medical conditions that
wouldprecludethemfromscreening(ie,seriouscomorbidcon-
ditions or estimated life expectancy of fewer than 5 years). Pa-
tients with documented chest CT scans within the past 12
months were excluded until 12 months had elapsed, as were
those with symptoms suggestive of possible lung cancer or
those receiving active therapy for cancer other than nonmela-
noma skin cancer. Patients without exclusion criteria dis-
cussedtheirinterestinundergoingLCSwithclinicalstaff,using
a shared decision-making process and brochure (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement).17 Sites were encouraged to start LCS imple-
mentation with a small number of interested primary care
teams and then expand as resources allowed. One site began
screening July 1, 2013; other sites began as they hired clinical
LCS coordinators.
Project Materials
Project materials developed for patients and staff are de-
scribed in detail in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement. An Imple-
mentation Guide provided detailed guidance on a recom-
mended approach to conduct the screening program and
included resources, tools, and the evaluation plan. Staff at all
sites were encouraged to follow the guidance but were al-
lowed to make changes based on local resources and proce-
dures.

Key Points
Question What are the implications for patients and staff of
implementing a proactive, population-based, comprehensive lung
cancer screening program in a large, multi-site health care system?
Findings This clinical demonstration project showed that, in
Veterans Health Administration facilities, development and
implementation of a comprehensive lung cancer screening
program is a complex and challenging undertaking and that most
patients will have findings that require follow-up; however, few
patients will have early-stage lung cancers.
Meaning Implementation of a comprehensive lung cancer
screening program requires significant clinical effort for as-yet
uncertain patient benefit.

incidentalfindings,andestimatednumberofVHApatientswho
may be candidates for LCS. The designation “nodules need-
ing to be tracked” was based on nodule follow-up guidelines
adopted from Fleischner Society guidelines.18,19 Generally,
these were solid nodules 8 mm or smaller without suspicious
features (eg, irregular or spiculated borders) and not known
to be new or growing based on results of prior imaging (if avail-
able), ground glass nodules larger than 5 mm, or mixed solid
and ground glass nodules of any size. Patients with solid nod-
ules 8 mm or smaller with suspicious features or nodules
knowntobeneworgrowingandthosewithnoduleslargerthan
8 mm were referred for further evaluation.
Following VHA policy,21 neither the demonstration proj-
ectnortheevaluationwasconsideredtoberesearch;theywere
declared nonresearch clinical operations activities by the VHA
National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Preven-
tion, the VHA Office of Research Oversight, and the Durham
Veterans Affairs Medical Center Institutional Review Board. As
a clinical operations activity, patient consent was not re-
quired. Patient data were deidentified in analyses.
Data Sources
Organizational-level effort data at the 8 sites were collected
from internal project notes, telephone calls and email with
LCSDP site leaders and coordinators, and monthly site re-
ports. Patient-level data were captured via clinical reminders
developed for the project (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).
These electronic tools allowed gathering of data in the medi-
cal record that are not recorded using standardized codes (eg,
International Classification of Diseases). These data and other
standard coded data were obtained from a VHA central data
repository.20 For the estimated number of VHA patients who
may be candidates for LCS, VHA central data were used to de-
termine the national number of primary care patients with at
least 1 visit to VHA primary care in fiscal year 2014 who met
the age and clinical criteria of the cohort eligible for LCS. That
number was multiplied by the mean percentage of patients in
the project with the appropriate smoking history.
Statistical Analysis
Patients determined to be eligible for LCS as of March 31, 2015,
with an initial LDCT scan completed at 1 of the 8 sites by June
30, 2015, are included in these analyses. All patients were fol-
lowedupthroughadministrativedataanalysisfor330daysfrom
their initial LDCT scan. They were identified as having con-
firmed lung cancer if they had at least 1 International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification or In-
ternational Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code for
malignantneoplasmofthetrachea,bronchus,lung,orothersites
withintherespiratorysystemandintrathoracicorgans(seeeAp-
pendix 1 in the Supplement for a list of codes) and if confirma-
tory pathologic reports with staging and/or histologic findings
were found on review of the electronic medical record. Pa-
tients were classified as having other positive test results (nod-
ules needing to be tracked or suspicious findings requiring fur-
ther evaluation) and incidental findings if indications of these
eventswerefoundwithin50daysofthedateoftheinitialLDCT
scan(seeeAppendix1intheSupplementformethodologicalde-
tailsaboutdetermininginitialdatesoftheLDCTscan).Datawere
descriptively summarized using counts, percentages, means,
and ranges using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Cost and
budget effect analyses will be reported separately.
Results
Organizational Effort and Processes
Each of the 8 sites named a physician leader (6 pulmonolo-
gists, 1 medical oncologist, and 1 radiologist, including K.L.R.
and N.T.T.) and hired a full-time LCS clinical coordinator with
salary support provided by the VHA (all but 1 were registered
nursesormid-levelhealthcareprofessionals).Coordinatorswere
involved in all daily activities of patient care coordination, in-
cluding identification of appropriate candidates for screening,
deliveryofpatienteducationaboutLCS,participationinshared
decisionmakingaboutscreening,schedulingofLDCTscans,no-
tification of patients about results, and follow-up care, as
needed, in close collaboration with the physician site leaders.
Coordinators were also responsible for educating primary care
staff about program procedures. Details about coordinator and
site radiologist training and quality assurance review activities
are provided in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement.
TheImplementationGuidewasdeveloped,expanded,and
revised through frequent conference calls by national LCSDP
leadership staff with steering committee members, site lead-
ers, and LCS coordinators. The electronic tools and database
were revised multiple times based on input from the coordi-
nators. Patient education materials and guidelines for nodule
follow-up were revised to improve clarity and usefulness. Site
leadersandcoordinatorsreportedvariabilityinhowsitesimple-
mented their screening programs, especially in terms of iden-
tifying patients who met criteria for LCS, which staff engaged
in shared decision making with candidates for screening, LCS
coordinators’responsibilities,trainingofprimarycarestaffand
radiologists, communicating LCS results with patients, and re-
sponsibility for follow-up of incidental findings.
Seven of the 8 sites followed a similar process for offering
LCS and obtaining patient agreement (eAppendix 1 the Supple-
ment). At those 7 sites, patients meeting the initial inclusion
criteria who were seen by health care professionals partici-
patingintheLCSDPwerefurtherassessedforeligibilityforLCS.
Clinicians determined that 4246 of 5035 patients (84.3%) were
appropriate for screening (ie, they had no additional medical
contraindications). The eighth site mailed patient education
materials (the Screening for Lung Cancer brochure [eFigure 2
intheSupplement]17)topatientseligibleforLCSandthencalled
them or requested they call the coordinator if interested in dis-
cussing LCS further or to request screening.
The 8 sites identified 93 033 patients who met the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria (Figure). A total of 36 555 patients
(39.3%) were missing information about smoking status or, the
tobacco pack-years were improperly calculated; they were not
further assessed. Of the remaining 56 478 patients, 18 083
(32.0%) met the smoking history criteria for eligibility for
screening.

Across the 8 sites, 2452 of 4246 patients (57.7%) who were
offered LCS agreed to be screened (site range, 290 of 863
[33.6%] to 257 of 389 [66.1%]) (Table 1). Of those, 2106 pa-
tients(85.9%)completedtheirfirstLDCTscanbyJune30,2015.
They were predominantly men (2028 [96.3%]) (Table 2); 1106
of 2106 patients (52.5%) were 65 years or older.
Patient Outcomes
Yield of LCS for Positive Test Results and Lung Cancers
There was wide variation among sites in the percentage of
screening test results that were positive for nodules or pos-
sible lung cancer. Overall, 1257 of the 2106 patients (59.7%)
screenedhadapositivetestresult(siterange,70of228[30.7%]
to 181 of 213 [85.0%]) (Table 1), including 1184 patients (56.2%)
who had 1 or more nodules needing to be tracked (site range,
64 of 228 [28.1%] to 176 of 213 [82.6%]). Most nodules were
small (<5 cm; 710 of 1293 [54.9%]) and solid (1079 of 1293
[83.4%]) (Table 3). A total of 73 patients (3.5% of all patients
screened) had findings suspicious for possible lung cancer and
underwentfurtherdiagnosticevaluation.Lungcancerwascon-
firmed for 31 of those patients (1.5%; site range, 0 of 247 to 10
of444[2.3%])withinthe330-dayfollow-upperiod;20(64.5%)
of the cancers were stage I (Table 4). The mean number of days
frominitialLDCTscantocancerdiagnosiswas137(range,5-330
days). The remaining 42 patients (2.0%; site range, 0 of 135 to
10 of 247 [4.0%]) who underwent evaluation were not con-
firmed to have lung cancer during that time frame. The rate
of false-positive test results for lung cancer was 97.5% (1226
of 1257) during the 330-day follow-up period (Table 1).
Yield of Incidental Findings
Radiologists and coordinators were asked to record only inci-
dental findings that would likely require follow-up or further
evaluation. Overall, 857 patients (40.7%) had 1 or more inci-
dental findings reported (site range, 89 of 444 [20.0%] to 135
of 213 [63.4%]) (Table 1). Among the 1044 incidental findings
reported, the most common were emphysema, other pulmo-
nary abnormalities, and coronary artery calcification (eTable
in the Supplement).
Size of VHA Population That Potentially Meets
LCS Eligibility Criteria
Based on the central data analysis described above, we calcu-
lated that 2 780 933 primary care VHA patients potentially met
the eligibility criteria for visits, age, and medical history. Using
the mean of 32% of patients in the demonstration sites who
met the additional criteria for smoking history, an estimated
889 899 VHA patients may be candidates for LCS.
Discussion
The VHA LCSDP found implementing a comprehensive LCS
program that followed recommendations7-9 to be challeng-
ing and complex, requiring new tools and patient care pro-
cesses for staff as well as dedicated patient coordination.
For example, creating electronic tools to capture the neces-
sary clinical data in real time that met the needs of the LCS
coordinators proved to be difficult, even with the VHA’
s
highly regarded electronic medical record. Although com-
puterized clinical reminders about current or recent smok-
ing are widely used in the VHA,22 more detailed information
about pack-years smoked and years since quitting was
required; this information is not fully captured in the elec-
tronic medical record.

If the eligibility percentage found in our 8-site project is
representative of the VHA population as a whole, we esti-
mate that nearly 900 000 veterans in the VHA health care sys-
tem would meet the initial screening criteria for age, smoking
history, and medical history. Even if this number is reduced
by 16%, as found when longer-term medical contraindica-
tions were taken into account (Figure), the number of veter-
ans who may be candidates for annual LCS is substantial. Ac-
curately identifying these patients and discussing with them
the benefits and harms of LCS will take significant effort for
primary care teams. Based on LCSDP experience, only about
58% of candidates will agree to be screened. Patients’rea-
sons for declining screening were not collected but may have
included concerns about the need for LCS, exposure to radia-
tion, psychological distress, effort required for the screening
examinations, and others.23,24
In addition, performing screening LDCT scans for large
numbers of patients may stress the capacity of radiology ser-
vices, especially considering the number of repeat scans
needed, potentially leading to delays for patients needing CT
scansforotherdiagnosticindications.Pulmonaryservicesmay
also see an increased workload in determining which nod-
ules need follow-up. Finally, primary care will need to be in-
volved in deciding which incidental findings need further
evaluation. These clinical efforts will require coordination and
communication among clinical services and between pa-
tients and staff. Lung cancer screening coordinators will likely
be needed to manage population-based LCS programs, lead-
ing to additional personnel costs. Such programs will also re-
quire training for primary care staff and radiologists, quality
assurance measures, and possibly additional CT scanners and
radiology staff.
The veterans screened in the VHA demonstration project
differed in several ways from the NLST participants.1,25 They
were generally older: 52.5% were 65 years or older compared
with only 14 220 of 53 454 NLST participants (26.6%) in that
age group at the time of enrollment. This difference may be
owing, in part, to the higher upper age limit used in the LCSDP
(≤80 years, as recommended by the US Preventive Services
Task Force3). A much higher proportion of veterans were men
(2028 [96.3%]) compared with those in the NLST (31 532 of
53 454 [59.0%]), reflective of the demographics of VHA pa-
tients. More VHA patients were current smokers (1192 [56.6%])
than were NLST participants (25 762 of 53 454 [48.2%]).
Whether these differences will alter the benefit shown in the
NLST is not known.
The rate of positive findings after 1 round of screening in
the LCSDP was more than twice that in the NLST (1257 [59.7%]
vs 7191 of 26 309 [27.3%]). The reason for the overall high rate
of initially positive examination results in the VHA sites is not
certain but may be owing, in part, to the older age and heavier
smoking history of veterans screened.26,27 Nodule follow-up
guidelines in the LCSDP included a recommendation to fol-
low up very small nodules (<4 mm) if they were new or grow-
ing, based on results of previous scans, or had suspicious fea-
tures; the NLST did not follow up nodules smaller than than
4 mm. The wide range of nodular findings among the 8 sites
(range, 70 of 228 [30.7%] to 181 of 213 [85.0%]) may reflect, in
part, different geographical locations28 or differences in in-
terpretation by participating radiologists. A similar variabil-

ity in positive findings by site was noted in the NLST (4% to
69%)29 and suggests a need for better standardization to
achieve consistency in reading results of LDCT scans.
After the LCSDP developed its nodule follow-up guide-
lines based on those of the Fleischner Society,18,19 the Ameri-
can College of Radiology released its Lung CT Screening Re-
portingandDataSystemstandards.30Whenthesecriteriawere
retrospectively applied to NLST data, the number of false-
positive results was reduced from 26.6% (6939 of 26 090) to
12.8% (3343 of 26 090).31 Since only about one-third of nod-
ules identified as needing to be tracked in the LCSDP were 6
mm or greater, the positive rate might decline from nearly 60%
to about 20%. However, this possibility assumes that pa-
tients with small nodules will continue to be screened annu-
ally and any growth will be detected in subsequent scans.
Clearer guidance about management of very small nodules is
needed, especially for patients who do not continue to be
screened.
Approximately 40% of those screened in the LCSDP had
a variety of incidental findings. Many reported findings,
such as emphysema and coronary calcifications, may not
require follow-up. However, inclusion of these findings
in reports of LDCT scan results requires a health care
professional’
s time to determine if additional testing is nec-
essary.
This clinical demonstration project raises several impor-
tant questions that warrant further investigation. For ex-
ample, more needs to be understood about the smoking ces-
sation experience of those who were screened. The study by
Zeliadt et al32 of current smokers who were offered LCS found
that screening may negatively influence cessation efforts. We
also need to learn more about the optimal design of decision
aids and ways to use shared decision making for LCS. In ad-
dition, the significance of and patient experience with inci-
dental findings on results of LDCT scans needs to be further
evaluated.
Limitations
These findings have important limitations. Data analysis was
based on data in clinical records rather than on data collected
by research staff. Missing or incorrectly recorded data about
smoking pack-years or years since quitting, for example, were
noted for 39.3% of patients who met the initial screening cri-
teria. It is possible that individuals received follow-up care for
positive LCS results outside the VHA health care system, and
thoserecordswouldnotbeavailableforouranalysis.Thenum-
ber of patients treated for lung cancer may be underesti-
mated. Some patients, especially those with significant medi-
calcomorbiditieswhounderwentscreening,mayhavereceived
radiation therapy for presumed lung cancer; without diagno-
sis codes for confirmed lung cancer, those patients were not
captured in project data. The follow-up period in this project
was less than 1 year; longer follow-up time will be needed to
determine the health outcomes of LCS. This project was per-
formed in 8 selected VHA academic medical centers; imple-
mentation of LCS programs in smaller medical facilities with
fewer resources may differ in many ways. Finally, these find-
ings may not be generalizable to non-VHA health care sys-
tems and patients who are not veterans. The experience of the
VHA, owing to its central organizational structure, may rep-
resent a best-case scenario, but even the VHA was challenged
with implementing LCS.
Conclusions
The VHA LCSDP found that a comprehensive LCS
program is a complex endeavor for both patients and
