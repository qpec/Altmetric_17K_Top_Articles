Summary
Background Globally, a growing number of children and adolescents are left behind when parents migrate. 
We investigated the effect of parental migration on the health of left behind-children and adolescents in low-income 
and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane 
Library, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, and Popline from inception to April 27, 2017, 
without language restrictions, for observational studies investigating the effects of parental migration on nutrition, 
mental health, unintentional injuries, infectious disease, substance use, unprotected sex, early pregnancy, and abuse 
in left-behind children (aged 0–19 years) in LMICs. We excluded studies in which less than 50% of participants were 
aged 0–19 years, the mean or median age of participants was more than 19 years, fewer than 50% of parents had 
migrated for more than 6 months, or the mean or median duration of migration was less than 6 months. We screened 
studies using systematic review software and extracted summary estimates from published reports independently. 
The main outcomes were risk and prevalence of health outcomes, including nutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight, 
overweight and obesity, low birthweight, and anaemia), mental health (depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, conduct 
disorders, self-harm, and suicide), unintentional injuries, substance use, abuse, and infectious disease. We calculated 
pooled risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using random-effects models. This study is 
registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064871.
Findings Our search identified 10 284 records, of which 111 studies were included for analysis, including a total of 
264 967 children (n=106 167 left-behind children and adolescents; n=158 800 children and adolescents of non-migrant 
parents). 91 studies were done in China and focused on effects of internal labour migration. Compared with children 
of non-migrants, left-behind children had increased risk of depression and higher depression scores 
(RR 1·52 [95% CI 1·27–1·82]; SMD 0·16 [0·10–0·21]), anxiety (RR 1·85 [1·36–2·53]; SMD 0·18 [0·11–0·26]), suicidal 
ideation (RR 1·70 [1·28–2·26]), conduct disorder (SMD 0·16 [0·04–0·28]), substance use (RR 1·24 [1·00–1·52]), 
wasting (RR 1·13 [1·02–1·24]) and stunting (RR 1·12 [1·00–1·26]). No differences were identified between left-behind 
children and children of non-migrants for other nutrition outcomes, unintentional injury, abuse, or diarrhoea. No 
studies reported outcomes for other infectious diseases, self-harm, unprotected sex, or early pregnancy. Study quality 
varied across the included studies, with 43% of studies at high or unclear risk of bias across five or more domains.
Interpretation Parental migration is detrimental to the health of left-behind children and adolescents, with no 
evidence of any benefit. Policy makers and health-care professionals need to take action to improve the health of these 
young people.

Introduction
Globally, nearly one in seven individuals are migrants. 
The majority are labour migrants who originate from low-
income or middle-income countries (LMICs) and relocate 
in search of employment opportunities either inter-
nationally or internally within a country (eg, from rural to 
urban settings).1 Some individuals are forced to migrate 
because of acute drivers such as conflict and disasters. 
As a result of migration, especially low-skilled labour 
migration, children are often left behind in the care of 
other family members or carers. Among labour migrants, 
a key incentive for migration is the hope of improving the 
circumstances of their families and children through 
increased household income and financial stability. 
International migrants send an estimated US$613 billion 
per year in remittances to their countries of origin.2 
Although the health and rights of migrant workers 
is recognised as a priority in the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals,3 the health of children of migrants 
has been largely overlooked in research and policy.

No estimates are available for the number of left-
behind children and adolescents globally, but the figure 
is thought to be in the hundreds of millions. More than a 
third of all children residing in rural China (61 million) 
are left behind by one or both migrant parents.4 27% of 
children in the Philippines,5 36% in Ecuador,6 and more 
than 40% in rural South Africa7 are estimated to be left 
behind.
Evidence about the health status of left-behind children 
is conflicting. On the one hand, material benefits and 
greater income security from remittances might be 
expected to confer improvements in health and facilitate 
access to health care and education. In Pakistan, migration 
had positive effects on the growth of left-behind children, 
with girls benefitting more than boys.8 However, on the 
other hand, some studies suggest poorer health outcomes 
among left-behind children. In China, where the most 
research has been done to date, studies have shown poorer 
nutritional,9 developmental10 and mental health outcomes11 
in left-behind children than children of non-migrant 
parents. It is unclear to what extent the health of these 
children is affected by parental migration, and how the 
impact might vary according to contextual factors, 
including sex and age. For example, in China, boys who 
were left before age 6 years were not as tall as boys whose 
parents left them at an older age.12 Although adolescents 
might be more independent than younger children, 
parental absence, and lack of supervision at this crucial 
age has been associated with risk-taking behaviours, 
including substance use and physical inactivity, with 
implications for long-term health.13 Furthermore, effects 
might vary according to the circumstances of parental 
migration. For example, maternal absence and the 
absence of both parents might have more pronounced 
effects on children’s health than paternal absence alone.14 
To date, to our knowledge, no studies have comprehensively 
examined the health status of left-behind children and 
adolescents across all settings and key areas of health. To 
address this research gap, we did a systematic review and 
meta-analysis to assess the impact of parental migration 
on child and adolescent nutrition, mental health, 
unintentional injuries, infectious disease, substance use, 
unprotected sex, early pregnancy, and verbal, physical, and 
sexual abuse in LMICs. We investigated whether parental 
migration status (one or both parents migrating), type of 
migration (internal or international; labour or forced) and 
child characteristics (age, sex) differentially influence the 
health of left-behind children and adolescents.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 
MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, 
Web of Science, PsychINFO, Global Index Medicus, 
Scopus, and Popline from database inception to 
April 27, 2017
. Full search terms are provided in 
the appendix. We searched for observational studies 
reporting the risk of health outcomes done in LMICs 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Migration is increasing globally, which has resulted in a 
growing number of children and adolescents being left 
behind when their parents migrate. Before starting this study, 
we searched the scientific literature for articles on the effect 
of parental migration on child and adolescent health, and 
found two narrative reviews: one focused on left-behind 
children in the Philippines and the other on mental health 
outcomes in left-behind children in China. These reviews 
suggested that children benefited from the remittances their 
parents sent home in terms of improved education and 
reduced child labour, which could result in improved health, 
but reported that family separation might have long-term 
psychological and societal costs. We also identified more than 
30 studies, mainly from China, investigating the effects of 
parental migration on a broad range of health outcomes 
across different countries. On Nov 26, 2018, we did an 
updated search of MEDLINE for systematic reviews with no 
date or language restrictions, using the broad search terms 
“(child* OR adolescent) AND health AND (migration OR 
left-behind)”. Although we identified 99 systematic reviews, 
none reviewed the key areas of health of left-behind children 
and adolescents across all low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs).
Added value of this study
 This is the largest and most comprehensive study to date 
assessing the impact of parental migration on all key areas of 
child and adolescent health across all LMICs. Compared with 
children of non-migrants, left-behind children and adolescents 
had an increased risk of depression, suicidal ideation, and risk 
of anxiety. Left-behind children also had smaller increases in 
risk for wasting, stunting, and substance use. These results 
highlight a rarely discussed consequence of global migration 
with implications for global policy making and health-care 
provision in migrant-sending countries. Although a small 
number of individual studies found positive health effects of 
parental migration, overall we found no evidence of benefit 
across any of the health outcomes.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings highlight the unmet health needs of left-behind 
children and adolescents. Research to date has focused 
primarily on China and longitudinal studies in a wider range of 
LMICs with high rates of emigration are needed to better 
understand risk and resilience factors within this population, 
and to inform policy and practice to address unmet health 
needs in left-behind children, adolescents, and their carers.

(classified according to the World Bank classification) that 
included children and adolescents (aged 0–19 years) with 
at least one migrant parent. We defined parental 
migration as one or more parent moving away from 
the place their children are living, for a minimum of 
6 months. We included studies in which parents 
had migrated for any reason, such as employment 
(labour migrants) or armed conflict or disasters (forced 
migrants). We included internal and international 
parental migration, defined as migration within and 
beyond a country’s borders, respectively. The comparator 
group was children of non-migrating parents. We excluded 
studies in which less than 50% of participants were aged 
0–19 years, the mean or median age of participants was 
more than 19 years, fewer than 50% of parents had 
migrated for more than 6 months, or the mean or median 
duration of migration was less than 6 months.
We updated our searches to include all literature 
published before Sept 5, 2018, to assess whether studies 
published after our original search might alter the 
implications of our findings. We tailored search strategies 
to each database and used controlled vocabulary and 
search filters where available, or Boolean search methods 
and free text terms. No date or language restrictions were 
used. Because of the large volume of research on left-
behind children available in China, we searched the China 
National Knowledge Infrastructure database and key 
Chinese public health journals. We also searched 
reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and grey 
literature published by key international organisations 
(UN Children’s Fund, International Organization for 
Migration, and UN High Commissioner for Refugees). 
The full search strategy is detailed in the appendix. 
We used Covidence systematic review software (Veritas 
Health Innovation, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) to organise 
and screen articles. Two reviewers (KR-C, GF, CZ, LKB, 
YZ, HS, BE, AB, WL, MO, DK, or DD) independently 
screened each title and abstract and excluded those that 
were not relevant, and then independently screened the 
full text of remaining studies to assess eligibility. 
Two reviewers (GF, CZ, LKB, YZ, AM, HS, BE, RB, WL, 
MO, KR, or OM-A) extracted data, and assessed the risk of 
bias for all included studies. Discrepancies about study 
inclusion were resolved through discussion with a third 
reviewer or by contacting study authors. Studies that 
reported results as mean scores with SDs or as raw 
proportions or unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 
included in meta-analysis. When insufficient data were 
reported for inclusion in the meta-analysis, we contacted 
study authors to request further information.
This study is reported in accordance with the PRISMA 
guidelines15 (appendix). The study protocol is available 
online.
Data analysis
We extracted data on study design, participant numbers 
and characteristics, and exposures and outcomes using 
data extraction sheets designed by the authors (appendix). 
When duplicate data were identified, only data for the 
most recent timepoint were extracted.
Outcomes of interest were risk and prevalence of the 
main causes of disability-adjusted life-years for children 
aged younger than 5 years, 5–9 years, and 10–19 years, 
including nutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight, 
overweight and obesity, low birthweight, and anaemia), 
mental health (depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, 
conduct disorders, self-harm, and suicide), unintentional 
injuries, substance use, physical, emotional, and sexual 
abuse,16 and infectious disease. Additional outcomes 
were unprotected sex and early pregnancy (<18 years; 
appendix).
We summarised outcomes from all studies included in 
the review diagrammatically, using adjusted estimates to 
classify studies according to their effect estimates and 
provide a visual overview of the evidence. Studies with 
sufficient data to examine the effect of being left behind 
on nutrition, mental health, injury, and substance 
use outcomes were included in random-effects meta-
analysis. We estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 
95% CIs for binary outcomes and standardised mean 
differences (SMDs) with 95% CI for continuous 
outcomes. Binary categorisations indicate the presence 
or absence of a disorder (caseness), and continuous 
outcomes were associated with symptom severity. We 
used unadjusted study outcomes for three main reasons. 
First, only 15 studies reported adjusted effect estimates. 
Second, the adjusted effects estimates varied considerably 
with regard to the covariates included and effects 
were not directly comparable. Third, a number of studies 
reported adjusted ORs; due to the so-called non-
collapsibility property of ORs,17 estimates from adjusted 
ORs can differ significantly from unadjusted estimates 
even in the absence of confounding. We used meta-
regression to assess the effect of child age and sex on 
study-specific effect estimates.
Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of 
the Newcastle Ottawa Scale18 incorporating items from 
the National Institute for Clinical Excellence Quality 
Appraisal19 (appendix). Studies with a high or unclear 
risk of bias across five or more domains were defined as 
being at high risk of bias. This definition was based on 
consensus between the authors, which acknowledged 
that any such cutoffs are arbitrary.20 No studies were 
excluded on the basis of quality. Funnel plots were used 
to assess publication bias.
We used the I² statistic to indicate the proportion of 
total variation between study estimates due to hetero-
geneity.20 To identify and assess sources of heterogeneity, 
we planned a-priori subgroup analyses to assess 
migration of one versus both parents, and forced versus 
labour migration. We also planned to do subgroup 
analyses of internal versus international migration, but 
due to the predominance of Chinese studies, which 
were all on internal migration, we decided to do

subgroup analyses of studies in China versus the rest of 
the world. We did a sensitivity analysis to assess the 
robustness of our conclusions with regard to the 
assumptions underlying our analytic approach. We did 
fixed-effects meta-analyses and repeated analyses using 
only studies with low risk of bias. All statistical analyses 
were done using Stata (version 13.0) and MetaXL 
(version 5.3). The study is registered with PROSPERO, 
number CRD42017064871.

Results
Our systematic search of the literature identified 
10 284 records, of which 2265 were duplicates (figure 1). Of 
the 396 full-text articles retrieved, 111 studies9,10,13,21–128 done 
between 1994 and 2017 in 16 countries (n=106 167 left-
behind children and adolescents; n=158 800 children and 
adolescents of non-migrant parents) were included in the 
systematic review (appendix). 89 studies (n=78 273 left-
behind children and adolescents; n=88 350 children of 
non-migrant parents) were included in meta-analyses. 
Reasons for exclusion at the full-text screening stage and 
characteristics of included studies are shown in the 
appendix. Of the 111 included studies, 91 (82%) were done 
in China, 58 (52%) were published in Chinese, nine (8%) 
were done in Asia (Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, 
Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and India), six (5%) in Latin America 
(Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru), three (3%) in Africa 
(Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi), two (2%) in the Caribbean 
(Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica), and two (2%) in 
eastern Europe (Romania and Moldova). 101 studies were 
cross-sectional, seven were cohort studies, and three 
were case-control studies. All studies included children 
of labour migrants; none included children of forced 
migrants. All Chinese studies examined internal migration 
within China, whereas studies from the rest of the world, 
with the exception of one study,100 focused on international 
migration. 71 studies included children aged younger than 
10 years. Among the 92 studies that reported participant 
sex, the proportion of male participants ranged from 
13·1% to 76·3%. Study quality varied by domain assessed 
(figure 2). 48 (43%) of the 111 included studies were at high 
or unclear risk of bias across five or more domains. Funnel 
plots showed no evidence of publication bias (appendix).
Of the 111 studies included in the systematic review, 
mental disorders were the most common study outcome 
(n=64), followed by nutritional status (n=29), substance 
use (n=14), experience of violence and abuse (n=7), 
unintentional injury (n=6), and infectious disease (n=5; 
figure 3). Across all outcomes, only 12 studies reported a 
lower risk of adverse health outcomes among left-behind 
children and adolescents.
64 of 65 studies reporting mental health outcomes used 
self-reported screening tools. Meta-analysis showed that 
left-behind children and adolescents had a significantly 
higher risk of depression caseness (RR 1·52 [95% CI 
1·27–1·82]) and symptoms (SMD 0·16 [95% CI 
0·10–0·21]), anxiety caseness (RR 1·85 [1·36–2·53]) and 
symptoms (SMD 0·18 [0·11–0·26]), and suicidal ideation 
caseness (RR 1·70 [1·28–2·26]) compared with children of 
non-migrating parents (figures 4A, figure 4B). Left-behind 
children and adolescents had a higher risk of symptoms of 
conduct disorder (SMD 0·16 [95% CI 0·04–0·28]) but 
not caseness (RR 1·16 [95% CI 0·88–1·52]). Statistical 
heterogeneity across mental disorder outcomes was high 
(I²=67·0–96·9%). In subgroup analyses, no differences 
were identified in risk of anxiety caseness or symptoms 
among children and adolescents left behind by one parent

of non-migrant parents (appendix). Children and 
adolescents left behind by both parents had a higher risk of 
depressive symptoms than did those of non-migrants 
(SMD 0·11 [95% CI 0·01 to 0·22]), but no differences were 
identified between children or adolescents left behind by

[95% CI 0·74–1·17]) or by both parents (1·13 [0·78–1·64]) 
when compared with children and adolescents of non-
migrant parents (appendix). In studies outside of China, 
no significant differences in risk of mental disorders were 
found among children and adolescents of international 
migrants compared with children of non-migrant parents. 
With the exception of conduct disorders, the number of 
studies of children of international migrants done outside 
of China was limited. Among children of migrants in 
China (all of whom were internal migrants) risks for all 
health outcomes were consistent with the results of the 
main analyses (appendix). Excluding studies at high risk of 
bias did not alter mental disorder outcomes. Using a fixed-
effects model did not significantly alter effect estimates 
with the exception of conduct disorder caseness (RR 1·45 
[95% CI 1·38–1·52]; appendix). We did not include 
any studies in the meta-analysis reporting outcomes 
for self-harm.
Meta-analyses showed that left-behind children had a 
significantly increased risk of wasting (RR 1·13 [95% CI 
1·02–1·24]) and stunting (RR 1·12 [1·00–1·26]) than 
children of non-migrants. No differences were identified 
in mean height-for-age Z score (SMD –0·47 [95% CI 
–0·95 to 0·01]), mean weight-for-height Z score 
(SMD –0·02 [–0·09 to 0·05]), mean weight-for-age 
Z score (SMD –0·32 [–0·69 to 0·05]), risk of 
being underweight (RR 1·10 [0·88 to 1·38]), risk of being 
overweight or obese (RR 0·94 [0·74 to 1·19]), or risk of 
having iron-deficiency anaemia (RR 1·18 [0·91 to 1·54]) 
between left-behind children and children of non-
migrating parents (figure 4C, figure 4D). Heterogeneity 
varied across nutrition outcomes (I²=0·0–98·1%), with 
all outcomes (with the exception of wasting and weight-
for-height Z score) varying substantially between studies.
Subgroup analyses of wasting for children left behind by 
one parent and by both parents showed no statistical 
evidence of an increased risk in left-behind children 
compared with children of non-migrants (appendix). 
Subgroup analyses of stunting revealed a significant 
increase in risk for children left behind by one parent 
Figure 3: Harvest plot of health outcomes among left-behind children and children of non-migrant parents included in the systematic review
Each full-height bar represents the health outcomes reported by an individual study included in the systematic review. Half-height bars represent studies which found 
varying directionality of health outcomes between different population subgroups (eg, a higher risk among girls who were left behind but no difference among boys 
who were left behind compared with children of non-migrant parents). Numbers refer to study references as cited in the reference list. Nine studies23,24,31,32,86, 87,91,98,124 were 
excluded from this plot due to the absence of significance testing reported in these studies. Two studies105,109 were included for those outcomes for which significance 
testing was reported and excluded for other outcomes.

(RR 1·28 [95% CI 1·06–1·55]) and children left behind by 
both parents (1·26 [1·06–1·50]; appendix) compared with 
children of non-migrating parents. Among studies done in 
China, children left behind had a higher risk of stunting 
than children of non-migrants, but all other nutrition 
outcomes remained unchanged. Of the studies done 
outside of China, only three67,93,100 reported nutrition 
outcomes for children who were left behind. Overall no 
difference was found in nutrition outcomes in studies 
outside of China, with the exception of wasting and weight-
for-height Z scores (appendix). Excluding studies at high 
risk of bias did not alter nutrition outcomes. Using a fixed-
effects model resulted in significantly worse height-for-age 
Z scores (SMD –0·23 [95% CI –0·29 to –0·17]) and weight-
for-age Z scores (–0·19 [–0·25 to –0·12]) among left-behind 
children than children of non-migrant parents; all other 
outcomes remained unchanged (appendix).
Left-behind children had a marginally higher risk of 
substance use (RR 1·24 [95% CI 1·00–1·52]) including 
alcohol, smoking, and any substance use. No significant 
differences were identified in risk of unintentional injury 
(RR 1·32 [95% CI 0·97–1·78]), abuse (RR 1·09 
[0·88–1·35]), or diarrhoea (RR 0·97 [0·90–1·05]; figure 4E) 
between left-behind children and children of non-migrant 
parents. Statistical heterogeneity was high across these 
outcomes (I²=82·8–83·1%). Pooled risk for substance use 
outcomes in studies outside of China and among children 
left behind by one parent showed no increased risk 
compared with children of non-migrants; however, each 
subgroup included only two studies (appendix). When 
studies at high risk of bias were excluded, no significant 
differences were identified in risk of substance use among 
left-behind children compared with children of non-
migrant parents. Fixed effects meta-analysis revealed a

higher risk of unintentional injury among left-behind 
children than children of non-migrant parents (RR 1·35 
[95% CI 1·21–1·52]; appendix). No studies included in the 
meta-analysis reported outcomes for infectious disease, 
with the exception of diarrhoea, or outcomes for 
unprotected sex or early pregnancy.
Meta-regression showed sex and mean age had no 
significant effects on any health outcomes (appendix).
Discussion
Although most studies identified by our systematic review 
focused on internal labour migration in China, our 
findings suggest that, as a group, left-behind children and 
adolescents have worse outcomes than children of non-
migrant parents, especially with regard to mental health 
and nutrition. Compared with children of non-migrants, 
left-behind children and adolescents had a 52% increased 
risk of depression, 70% increased risk of suicidal ideation, 
and an 85% increased risk of anxiety. We found smaller 
increases in risk for wasting (13%), stunting (12%) and 
substance use (24%). Left-behind children and adolescents 
had no increased risk of conduct disorders, being 
overweight or obese, anaemia, unintentional injury, 
diarrhoea, or abuse. Although a minority of individual 
studies10,42,55,56,78,80,88,95,103,107,109 reported beneficial health effects, 
no overall benefits were found across any of the outcomes 
assessed. We found no studies investigating the effect of 
forced migration, which might be explained by the fact 
that leaving children behind in the context of conflict or 
disaster is unlikely.
We updated our search from April 28, 2017, to 
Sept 5, 2018, using the same search terms and databases.

This updated search identified nine additional papers 
(six published in English and three published in 
Chinese), all of which focused on internal migration and 
were done in China. Findings from the studies were 
consistent with the results from our meta-analyses and 
provide no evidence of benefits of parental migration for 
left-behind children and adolescents and support our 
overall findings in terms of the negative health impact 
of migration on left-behind children and adolescents. 
Four studies reported outcomes for depression: 
three studies129–131 found a small increase in depressive 
symptoms or worse depression scores among left-behind 
children and adolescents and one study132 found no 
difference between left-behind children and children 
of non-migrant parents. Studies129,133 reporting anxiety 
outcomes similarly found increased risks among left-
behind children and adolescents compared with children 
of non-migrants. Consistent with our findings, a large 
study of adolescents in China (n=13 952) found a 
significant increase in suicide attempts in left-behind 
adolescents compared with adolescents who were not left 
behind (3·75% vs 2·86%, p<0·01).134 Two studies135,136 
assessed nutrition outcomes. A cohort study135 found 
that left-behind children and adolescents had lower

weight-for-age Z scores and height-for-age Z scores at 
baseline and follow-up after migration, although the 
effect of migration varied according to which parent 
migrated. Li and Zhang136 found that a higher proportion 
of left-behind children had stunting and wasting than did 
children with non-migrant parents. One study137 reported 
a higher risk of any type of unintentional injury (eg, 
vehicle and traffic injuries and falls) among left-behind 
children and adolescents than children and adolescents 
with non-migrant parents (adjusted OR 1·208, p<0·05).
Labour migration is a global trend, shaping families 
and communities across the world.138 Our findings are 
consistent with previous reviews5,11 about left-behind 
children in rural China and the Philippines: although 
parental labour migration might have economic benefits 
for families, it might have hidden costs for the health of 
children and adolescents who are left behind. A previous 
study139 reported that these negative health consequences 
extend to other family members. The Child Health and 
Migrant Parents in South-East Asia study139 showed that 
left-behind mothers and other carers in transnational 
migrant households were more likely to have poor 
mental health than carers in non-migrant households: 
mental health problems were associated with infrequent 
contact with the migrant and migrant destinations in the 
Middle East, whereas receiving remittances in the past 
6 months was found to have a protective effect on the 
mental health of carers. With the exception of age and 
sex, we were unable to investigate factors mediating 
poor health outcomes among left-behind children and 
adolescents, although family structure, community 
social capital, living conditions, and level of caregiver 
supervision might be important.68,140 Future research 
should consider the circumstances of parental migration. 
Children of parents migrating because of extreme 
poverty, disasters, or oppression are likely to have worse 
health outcomes than children from wealthier migrant 
families that are financially stable with access to 
adequate health care. Residing with siblings and 
relationships between children and their caregivers 
could also be important.
82% of studies included in our systematic review were 
done in China, an upper middle-income country where 
migration is mainly internal, rural-to-urban labour 
migration. Our study highlights a major research gap in 
countries beyond China, potentially limiting the 
generalisability of our findings to other forms of 
migration and to other settings, especially low-income 
countries. Subgroup analyses of studies done across the 
rest of the world showed no difference in outcomes for 
left-behind children and adolescents; however, with the 
exception of conduct disorder, few studies have been 
done, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn.
Addressing the needs of families who are left behind 
will be essential for health-care workers and policy 
makers.141 In China, the health and wellbeing of left-
behind children is a priority and steps are being taken to 
address this. In 2013, the Chinese Government called on 
local authorities to take specific responsibility for the 
education and care of left-behind children.142 The Chinese 
Women’s Federation has taken a lead in most provinces, 
but action has been inconsistent and it is unclear 
whether the health of left-behind children is improving 
as a consequence. Community-based clubs for children 
have been established to provide left-behind children 
with educational and recreational opportunities.143 Other 
strategies include conditional cash transfer schemes for 
caregivers to encourage them to attend health education 
Panel: Next steps and future research
Clinical
• 
Health-care providers should have an increased awareness 
with regard to mental health and nutritional disorders when 
dealing with left-behind children and adolescents. More 
focus should be placed on research to better understand the 
health needs of this group in a range of countries globally.
Epidemiology
• 
Increase in the evidence base and available data to 
understand the short-term and long-term health 
consequences of migration on left-behind children, with a 
particular focus on internal migration outside of China and 
international migration, elucidating the mechanisms by 
which being left behind might lead to improvements or 
worsening health. To do this, more work is needed on the 
moderating and mediating factors—for example, the 
number of parents migrating, the type and duration of 
migration, the degree of contact with parents, or age of the 
children and the differing family situations, including 
alternate family structures.
Intervention research
• 
Moving beyond understanding the problem, interventions 
are needed to improve the health or to mitigate the adverse 
effects of being left behind. This might involve community 
actions, laws, or technology to improve the connectedness 
of families. Research is particularly needed on interventions 
at an individual or community level to promote resilience 
and enable young people to overcome the negative aspects 
of parental absence due to migration.
Policy
• 
Both global and national policies need to consider the 
health needs of children who are left behind. Research is 
needed to identify and implement national policies to 
provide services for children who might not have parental 
support. Globally, policies for migrant workers should 
consider the impact on their families. Migrant workers must 
be allowed the time to visit and communicate with their 
families. Global mental health initiatives need to better 
consider this excluded group.

sessions, vaccinations, and health checks.144 In China 
until around 10 years ago, the national household 
registration system limited rural children’s access to 
urban health and educational services, with children 
forced to attend designated migrant schools, which 
varied in quality. The situation is now changing, 
especially in smaller cities, as a result of the national 
household registration system restrictions being relaxed, 
migrant children attending mainstream schools, and 
using rural health insurance to access health care. These 
changes have led to an increase in the number of children 
migrating with their parents.145
Next steps for research and practice require a 
multifaceted approach, involving clinical, epidemiolo-
gical, intervention research, and policy perspectives 
(panel). Focusing on all levels of society, the International 
Organization for Migration recommends a multi-
dimensional intervention framework that includes the 
government and business.146 Clinicians, teachers, and 
other individuals working with left-behind children and 
adolescents must be aware of the potential mental health 
and nutritional needs of this population, and be trained 
to support and treat them. Increased awareness is 
particularly important with regard to common mental 
disorders and risk-taking behaviours that children or 
adolescents might not present with, or that might be 
underlying another clinical presentation. Global mental 
health initiatives should be encouraged to incorporate a 
focus on left-behind children. However, a one-size-fits-
all approach to intervention is likely to be ineffective 
since left-behind children and adolescents will have 
different experiences of migration and being left behind. 
A study in China 
68 found that children who were left 
behind had more depressive symptoms than children 
residing in rural China with both parents who had never 
migrated or been left behind, regardless of whether they 
had previously migrated or not. However, children who 
were previously left-behind but were now living with 
their parents had fewer depressive symptoms than 
children in rural areas without any experience of 
migration or being left behind.68 Although sex was not a 
predictor of health outcomes among left-behind children 
and adolescents in our study, girls and boys might 
require different intervention approaches. Interventions 
are also needed to support caregivers, many of whom 
might be elderly relatives with health needs of their own. 
Increasing the evidence base beyond China is essential, 
as are longitudinal studies investigating the long-term 
effects of parental migration on children and adolescents. 
Although familial separation is acutely detrimental for 
health, children might go on to develop resilience and 
have potentially better health outcomes.
The comprehensive scope of this review is a strength, 
since evidence was included across all LMICs, in all 
languages, across multiple health outcomes, with low 
publication bias. However, our study has several 
limitations. Our original systematic search included 
literature published up to April, 2017, and thus newer 
studies might alter the conclusions. However, when 
updating the searches to September, 2018, the studies 
were 
consistent 
with 
our 
findings. 
Statistical 
heterogeneity was high in the meta-analyses, which 
persisted in subgroup analyses and meta-regression. 
This heterogeneity suggests that, despite our use of 
a strict definition of left-behind children and adol-
escents, other mediating or moderating factors might 
influence the results reported in individual studies, 
including caregiver and contextual factors. Similarly 
high heterogeneity was identified in a systematic review 
and meta-analysis147 of mental disorders among 
refugees resettled in western countries. Most of the 
studies included in our systematic review and meta-
analysis were from China, focused on internal 
migration, and were cross-sectional, which means 
temporal causal inference is limited and might not 
generalise beyond China. Despite these limitations, our 
study defines and identifies a global population of 
young people at risk.
In summary, left-behind children and adolescents 
have substantial unmet mental health and nutritional 
needs that have not been well described outside of 
China. The prevalence of labour migration is increasing, 
thus interventions that support these young people are 
urgently needed to prevent long-term negative effects 
on their health and development.
