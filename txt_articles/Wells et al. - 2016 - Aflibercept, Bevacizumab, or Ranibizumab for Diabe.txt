 Methods—Randomization to 2.0-mg aflibercept, 1.25-mg repackaged (compounded) 
bevacizumab, or 0.3-mg ranibizumab intravitreous injections performed as frequently as monthly 
utilizing a protocol-specific follow-up and retreatment regimen. Focal/grid laser was added if 
DME persisted and was not improving at 6 months or later. Visits occurred every 4 weeks during 
year 1, and were extended up to every 4 months thereafter when VA and macular thickness were 
stable and injections were deferred.
Main Outcome Measures—Change in VA (efficacy), ocular/systemic adverse events (safety), 
retreatment frequency.
Results—Median numbers of injections in year 2 were 5, 6, 6 and over 2 years were 15, 16, 15 in 
the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab groups, respectively (global P=0.08). Focal/grid 
laser was administered in 41%, 64%, and 52%, respectively (aflibercept-bevacizumab: P<0.001, 
aflibercept-ranibizumab: P=0.04, bevacizumab-ranibizumab: P=0.01). From baseline to 2 years, 
mean VA letter score improved by 12.8 with aflibercept, 10.0 with bevacizumab, and 12.3 with 
ranibizumab. Treatment group differences varied by baseline VA (interaction P=0.02). With worse 
baseline VA (20/50-20/320), mean improvement was 18.3, 13.3, and 16.1 letters, respectively 
(aflibercept-bevacizumab: P=0.02, aflibercept-ranibizumab: P=0.18, ranibizumab-bevacizumab: 
P=0.18). With baseline VA 20/32-20/40, mean improvement was 7.8, 6.8, and 8.6 letters, 
respectively (P>0.10 for pairwise comparisons). Anti-Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC) 
events occurred in 5% with aflibercept, 8% with bevacizumab, and 12% with ranibizumab (global 
P=0.047: aflibercept-bevacizumab: P=0.34, aflibercept-ranibizumab: P=0.047, ranibizumab-
bevacizumab: P=0.20; global P=0.09 adjusted for potential confounders).
Conclusion—All 3 anti-VEGF groups had visual acuity improvement at 2 years with a 
decreased number of injections in year 2. VA outcomes were similar among treatment groups for 
eyes with baseline VA 20/32-20/40. Among eyes with worse baseline VA, aflibercept, on average, 
had superior 2-year VA outcomes compared with bevacizumab, but superiority of aflibercept over 
ranibizumab, noted at 1 year, was no longer identified. Higher APTC event rates with ranibizumab 
over 2 years warrants continued evaluation in future trials.
Introduction
The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) conducted a comparative 
effectiveness trial comparing the three commonly used anti-vascular endothelial growth 
factor (anti-VEGF) agents, aflibercept (EYLEA®, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), 
bevacizumab (Avastin®, Genentech), and ranibizumab (Lucentis®, Genentech) for center-
involved diabetic macular edema (DME) associated with visual impairment. The study 
utilized a standardized follow-up and retreatment regimen, including focal/grid laser for 
persistent DME not improving 6 months or later. The previously reported 1-year results 
showed all three agents improved vision, on average, with treatment group differences 
varying according to initial visual acuity.1, 2 When baseline visual acuity impairment was 
mild (20/32 to 20/40), no apparent differences in visual acuity, on average, were identified 
among the groups, while at worse levels of visual acuity (20/50 to 20/320), aflibercept, on 
average, was more effective at improving vision than the other two agents. No statistically 
significant differences in pre-specified ocular or systemic safety events among the 3 anti-
VEGF agents were identified.

 The 1-year primary outcome time point was chosen, in part, because previous trials 
consistently showed that, on average, most visual acuity improvement with anti-VEGF 
agents for DME occurred by 1 year.3-5 Therefore, we anticipated if there were treatment 
group differences, they likely would be apparent by 1 year. However, the secondary and final 
study end point at 2 years was chosen to determine if differences in treatment effects 
identified at 1 year were sustained at 2 years and whether differences in intravitreous 
injection and laser frequency were identified. The results of the 2-year analyses are reported 
herein.
Methods
The study procedures and statistical methods have been reported previously and are 
summarized briefly.2 The protocol is available on the DRCR.net website (www.drcr.net, date 
accessed: December 22, 2015).
Eighty-nine clinical sites enrolled 660 participants (mean age 61±10 years; 47% women) 
with best corrected visual acuity (approximate Snellen equivalent) of 20/32 to 20/320 (mean 
baseline visual acuity approximately 20/50), center-involved DME on clinical examination 
and optical coherence tomography (OCT) based on protocol-defined thresholds (mean 
baseline central subfield thickness 412 μm [provided as a Stratus® [Carl Zeiss Meditec] time 
domain equivalent throughout the remainder of this report]), and no prior anti-VEGF 
treatment within 12 months of enrollment. The eyes were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 
intravitreous injections of aflibercept (2.0 mg), bevacizumab (1.25 mg), or ranibizumab (0.3 
mg). If the non-study eye needed an anti-VEGF injection, the same agent as the study eye 
was used.
Participants had visits every 4 weeks during the first year and every 4 to 16 weeks during the 
second year depending on treatment course. At each visit, study eyes were assessed for 
retreatment with the anti-VEGF agent based on visual acuity and OCT criteria. Starting at 
the 6-month visit focal/grid laser treatment was administered if DME persisted and was not 
improving. Medical monitoring of all adverse events was completed by a masked physician 
at the Coordinating Center. A secondary review by another masked physician independent of 
the DRCR.net was performed for all serious adverse events to confirm pre-specified safety 
outcomes.
At annual visits the visual acuity and OCT technicians were masked to treatment group. 
Investigators and study coordinators were not masked. Participants were masked until the 
primary results were published in February 2015, when they were informed of the study’s 
primary results and informed of their treatment group assignment. At that time, if deemed 
warranted by the investigator, the study participant could switch anti-VEGF agents after 
discussion with the Protocol Chair.
The 2-year analyses methods mirrored the 1-year analyses.2 The primary analysis consisted 
of three pairwise comparisons of mean visual acuity change from baseline in the 3 treatment 
groups using an analysis of covariance model, adjusted for baseline visual acuity, with the 
Hochberg method used to control overall type I error.6 The primary analysis followed the

 intention-to-treat principle, including all randomized eyes. Central subfield thickness was 
analyzed similarly, with additional adjustment for baseline thickness. For visual acuity, 
multiple imputation was used to impute missing 2-year data and outlying values were 
truncated to 3 standard deviations from the mean.7 Binary visual acuity and central subfield 
thickness outcomes were analyzed using binomial regression or Poisson regression with 
robust variance estimation.8 Observed data are presented for summary statistics unless 
otherwise specified. For adverse events and number of treatments, global P-values for the 
overall 3-group comparison were calculated; pairwise comparisons were calculated if the 
global P-value was <0.05, adjusting for multiple treatment comparisons.9 All P-values are 2-
sided. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for all analyses.
Results
The 2-year visit was completed by 90%, 85%, and 88% of the 660 randomized participants 
(91%, 90%, and 91% excluding deaths), in the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab 
groups, respectively (Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no 
substantial differences identified in the baseline characteristics of those who completed and 
those who did not complete the 2-year visit (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
For those who completed 2 years, the median number of visits during the second year was 
10 in all three groups (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Among participants completing the 2-year visit, the median (interquartile range) numbers of 
intravitreous injections during the 2 years were 15 (11-17), 16 (12-20), and 15 (11-19) 
injections in the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab groups, respectively (global 
P=0.08), with 5 (2-7), 6 (2-9), and 6 (2-9) injections, respectively, between the 1 and 2 year 
visits (global P=0.32, Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Most eyes (84%) 
received at least 1 injection in the second year, and 98% of the protocol-required injections 
(based on visual acuity and OCT) were given over the 2 years (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The percentages of eyes receiving at least 1 session of focal/
grid laser during the 2 years were 41%, 64%, and 52% in the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and 
ranibizumab groups, respectively (global P<0.001; pairwise comparisons: P<0.001 for 
aflibercept-bevacizumab, P=0.04 for aflibercept-ranibizumab, and P=0.01 for ranibizumab-
bevacizumab), with 20%, 31%, and 27%, respectively, receiving at least 1 session of focal/
grid laser in the second year (global P=0.046, Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Three eyes in the aflibercept group, 10 in the bevacizumab group, and 1 in the ranibizumab 
group received 1 or more alternative treatments for DME other than the randomly assigned 
anti-VEGF or focal/grid laser. Only one of the eyes receiving alternative treatment occurred 
after the participant had been unmasked to their treatment assignment and informed of the 1-
year results (one eye in the bevacizumab group received aflibercept).
Effect of Treatment on Visual Acuity
Visual acuity at the 2-year visit improved from baseline, on average, by 12.8 letters with 
aflibercept, 10.0 letters with bevacizumab, and 12.3 letters with ranibizumab (pairwise 
comparisons: P=0.02 for aflibercept-bevacizumab, P=0.47 for aflibercept-ranibizumab, and 
P=0.11 for ranibizumab-bevacizumab; Supplementary Appendix Table S3, Figure 1,

 Supplementary Appendix Figure S3). However, the relative effect of the treatments varied by 
initial visual acuity (P value for interaction=0.02 with baseline visual acuity letter score as a 
continuous variable, and P value for interaction=0.11 with baseline visual acuity as a binary 
variable [letter score (69 or better or worse than 69 [approximate Snellen equivalent 
20/50])]; Table 1 and Supplementary Appendix Figure S2). Specifically, when initial 
visual acuity letter score was <69 (“20/50 or worse” , approximately 50% of the cohort), 
mean visual acuity letter score improvement from baseline to the 2-year visit was +18.1 
±13.8, +13.3 ± 13.4 and +16.1 ± 12.1 respectively (95% confidence intervals [CI] and P-
values for differences in mean change for aflibercept-bevacizumab: +4.7 (+0.5 to +8.8) 
[P=0.02], aflibercept-ranibizumab: +2.3 (−1.1 to +5.6) [P=0.18], and ranibizumab-
bevacizumab: +2.4 (−1.0 to +5.8) [P=0.18]; Table 1). When initial visual acuity letter score 
was 78 to 69 (“20/32 or 20/40”), mean letter score improvement at the 2-year visit was +7.8 
± 8.4 for aflibercept, +6.8 ± 8.8 for bevacizumab, and +8.6 ± 7.0 for ranibizumab without 
any statistically significant differences between groups (Table 1). Sensitivity analyses with 
different approaches for handling missing data and outlier values produced similar results 
(Supplementary Appendix Table S4).
Percentages of eyes with at least 10 or at least 15 letter changes at the 2-year visit are 
provided in Table 1 and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix and Figure S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix; there were no statistically significant differences between 
groups for any of the binary visual acuity outcomes, overall or within visual acuity 
subgroups. The detailed distribution of visual acuity at 2 years is provided in 
Supplementary Appendix Table S5. There was no statistically significant interaction 
between treatment and any of the 3 other pre-planned baseline factors: OCT central subfield 
thickness, prior anti-VEGF treatment, or lens status (Table S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Mean change in visual acuity over two years stratified in a post-hoc analysis by 
both baseline visual acuity and central subfield thickness is provided in Figure S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix; within the better baseline vision eyes with thicker baseline 
central subfield thickness (400 microns or thicker on time domain equivalent), there was a 
suggestion of less VA improvement in the bevacizumab group than the other two groups.
Effect of Treatment on Macular Edema
At the 2-year visit, central subfield thickness decreased on average by 171±141 microns 
with aflibercept, 126±143 microns with bevacizumab, and 149±141 microns with 
ranibizumab (95% confidence intervals and P-values for differences in mean change for 
aflibercept-bevacizumab: −48.5 [−70.0 to −27.0 (P<0.001)], aflibercept-ranibizumab: −15.5 
[−33.0 to +2.0 (P=0.08)], and ranibizumab-bevacizumab: −33.0 [−53.4 to −12.6 (P<0.001)]; 
Supplementary Appendix Table S7). The number of eyes achieving central subfield 
thickness <250μm (based on Zeiss Stratus equivalent) was 141 (71%), 75 (41%) and 121 
(65%) eyes, respectively. The relative treatment effect on central subfield thickness varied 
based on initial visual acuity (P value for interaction <0.001, Table 2; Figure 2). When 
initial visual acuity was “20/50 or worse,” central subfield thickness at 2 years decreased on 
average by 211±155, 185±158, and 174±159 microns with aflibercept, bevacizumab, and 
ranibizumab, respectively; eyes with initial visual acuity “20/32 or 20/40” decreased

 133±115, 68±98, and 125±118 microns, respectively. Change in retinal volume from 
baseline to 2 years is reported in Supplementary Appendix Table S8.
Safety
Ocular adverse events over two years are summarized in Table 3 and Tables S13-S14 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. One injection-related infectious endophthalmitis occurred in 
each group.
Systemic adverse events over two years are provided in Table 3 and Tables S9-S12 and S15 
in the Supplementary Appendix. Across the 3 treatment groups, the numbers of serious 
adverse events reported (37%-39%) and of participants hospitalized (33%-34%) within two 
years were similar (global P=0.90 and 0.93, respectively). In the aflibercept, bevacizumab, 
and ranibizumab groups, respectively, there were 2%, 6%, and 5% deaths (global P=0.12) 
and 5%, 8%, and 12% in pre-specified analysis using the Anti-platelet Trialists 
Collaboration definition of events (global P=0.047; pairwise comparisons: P=0.34 for 
aflibercept-bevacizumab, P=0.047 for aflibercept-ranibizumab, and P=0.20 for ranibizumab-
bevacizumab; global P adjusted for twelve potential baseline confounders [listed in a 
footnote to Table 3] =0.09, global P adjusted for prior myocardial infarction or prior 
stroke=0.06). The higher rate of APTC events for ranibizumab included more non-fatal 
strokes (2 for aflibercept, 6 for bevacizumab, 11 for ranibizumab) and vascular deaths (3 for 
aflibercept, 8 for bevacizumab and 9 for ranibizumab). In a post-hoc analysis among the 
aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab participants, respectively, without a history of 
stroke or myocardial infarction prior to study entry 5% (10/203), 6% (12/193), and 9% 
(17/193) developed an APTC event, while with a history of a prior stroke or myocardial 
infarction 10% (2/21), 20% (5/25), and 36% (9/25) developed an APTC event 
(Supplementary Appendix Table S10).
In a post-hoc analysis, among treatment group comparisons in 24 MedDRA system organ 
classes, one treatment group difference was associated with a P-value less than 0.05 (ear and 
labyrinth disorders), presumably a chance finding due to the large number of comparisons 
(Supplementary Appendix Table S11). When combining the systems of cardiac and 
vascular disorders, 31%, 32%, and 38% (global P=0.26) of participants had at least one 
event in the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab groups respectively 
(Supplementary Appendix Table S12).
Discussion
This randomized trial of eyes with vision-impairing center-involved DME compared 
treatment with intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab. Focal/grid laser was 
added per protocol after 6 months when DME persisted and was no longer improving. All 
three regimens, on average, produced substantial visual acuity improvement through 2 years. 
However, as in year 1, the relative treatment effect differed by baseline visual acuity. At 2 
years, in eyes with better baseline visual acuity, there still were no meaningful differences 
identified in mean visual acuity change among the treatment groups. In eyes with baseline 
VA of 20/50 or worse, the advantage of aflibercept over ranibizumab, noted at 1 year, had 
decreased and was no longer statistically significant at 2 years, while aflibercept remained

 superior to bevacizumab. Few eyes in any group lost substantial amounts of vision, 
regardless of the baseline visual acuity.
In eyes with baseline visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, the visual acuity differences between 
aflibercept and the other two agents were clinically relevant at 1 year; the relative difference 
in percentage of eyes in the aflibercept group that gained 15 or more letters at one year was 
63% greater than in the bevacizumab group (67% vs. 41%) and 34% greater than in the 
ranibizumab group (67% vs. 50%).2 However, at 2 years these relative differences were only 
12% (58% vs. 52%) and 5% (58% vs. 55%), respectively. Similar small relative differences 
were seen for a 10 or more letter improvement at two years (15% and 7% respectively), 
raising the question of whether differences observed at 2 years are clinically relevant.
At year 1, bevacizumab was less effective at reducing retinal thickness than the other 2 
agents. This difference persisted in year 2 among the eyes with better initial visual acuity. If 
this finding was coupled with visual acuity benefits it could be judged relevant, however, as 
a difference in acuity was not identified with better initial visual acuity, this observation may 
not be of clinical importance.
Over 2 years, the cumulative numbers of injections were similar across the 3 treatment arms, 
with the number in year 2 being about half that in year 1. Through 2 years, laser treatment 
was required less frequently in aflibercept-treated eyes than with the other 2 agents. Since 
laser was a protocol-defined part of the treatment regimen, it is not possible to separate the 
effect of macular laser from the anti-VEGF treatment on the VA and thickness outcomes.
Rates of ocular adverse events, including endophthalmitis and post-injection inflammation, 
remained low through 2 years with all 3 agents. Systemic APTC rates were higher in the 
ranibizumab group, with a greater number of non-fatal strokes and vascular deaths in the 
ranibizumab group. Although the P-values increased slightly after adjusting for a history of 
prior stroke or myocardial infarction and other potential confounders, this did not 
substantially alter the results. These findings have not been demonstrated consistently in 
previously reported clinical trials. Supplemental Table S16 and Figure S6 summarize 2-
year APTC events from prior anti-VEGF studies for DME and choroidal neovascularization 
in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In the Rise and Ride trials of eyes with DME, a 
higher percentage of participants in the pooled 0.5 mg ranibizumab group (7.2%) had an 
APTC event than in the 0.3 mg ranibizumab group (5.6%) or the control group (5.2%).5 In 
Rise, 0.3 mg ranibizumab had the lowest rate of participants with an APTC event among the 
3 treatment groups and in Ride it had the highest. In DRCR.net Protocol I, fewer participants 
experienced an APTC event during 2 years in the 0.5 mg ranibizumab group (7%) than in 
the laser group (13%).3 In previous trials of AMD, 2 year percentages of participants with an 
APTC event were similar between ranibizumab and bevacizumab groups and between 
aflibercept and ranibizumab groups.10, 11, 12 Across multiple retinal diseases, a meta-
analysis from Thulliez et al did not identify an increased risk of major cardiovascular or 
hemorrhagic events with ranibizumab compared with control.13 It is noteworthy that the 
12% frequency of ranibizumab managed participants with one or more APTC events in the 
current study appears to be larger relative to the other trials, including DRCR.net protocol I 
where the percentage was 7% with high overlap in DRCR.net clinical centers. The

 inconsistencies in the totality of the evidence create uncertainty as to whether there is a true 
increased risk of APTC events with ranibizumab at this time.
Strengths of the study include excellent compliance with the standardized retreatment 
regimen (98%), making it unlikely that a potential limitation of bias to treat or not to treat on 
the part of the unmasked ophthalmologist influenced the outcomes. Furthermore, good 
retention among the living participants, with approximately 90% of all enrolled eyes across 
all 3 groups completing the 2-year visit, makes it unlikely that losses to follow-up biased the 
results. Another potential limitation is that participants were unmasked to treatment group 
after the 1-year results were published; however, only one study participant switched to an 
alternative anti-VEGF treatment after the unmasking. Since the eligibility criteria were 
relatively broad with participants enrolled among 89 community- and university-based sites 
across the U.S., the results likely are generalizable to similarly characterized patients treated 
in a similar manner. The absence of other similarly designed comparative effectiveness trials 
across these three anti-VEGF agents precludes comparing these results to other studies.
In summary, this DRCR.net comparative effectiveness study for center involved DME 
showed vision gains in all three drugs at the 2-year visit, with an average of almost half the 
number of injections, slightly decreased frequency of visits, and decreased amounts of focal/
grid laser treatment in all 3 groups in the second year. Among eyes with better VA at 
baseline no difference was identified in vision outcomes through the 2-year visit. For the 
eyes with worse VA at baseline, the advantage of aflibercept over bevacizumab for mean VA 
gain persisted through 2 years, although the difference at 2-years was diminished. The VA 
difference between aflibercept and ranibizumab for eyes with worse VA at baseline that was 
noted at 1 year had decreased at 2 years. The implications of the increased rate of APTC 
events with ranibizumab found in the current study is uncertain due to inconsistency with 
prior trials. The results from this randomized clinical trial provide strong evidence for 
ophthalmologists to consider when applying this information to individual patients with 
DME.

Mean Change in Visual Acuity over Time, A) Overall; B) and C) Stratified by baseline 
visual acuity (approximate Snellen equivalent): 20/50 or worse (B) and 20/32-20/40 (C). 
Change in visual acuity was truncated to 3 standard deviations from the mean. The number 
of eyes at each time point ranged from 195-224 in the aflibercept group, 185-218 in the 
bevacizumab group, and 188-218 in the ranibizumab group (see Figure S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix and Figure S2 in the 1 Year Supplementary Appendix2 for the 
number at each time point).
