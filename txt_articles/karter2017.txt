IMPORTANCE Hypoglycemia-related emergency department (ED) or hospital use among
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is clinically significant and possibly preventable.
OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a tool to categorize risk of hypoglycemic-related
utilization in patients with T2D.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using recursive partitioning with a split-sample design,
we created a classification tree based on potential predictors of hypoglycemia-related ED or
hospital use. The resulting model was transcribed into a tool for practical application and
tested in 1 internal and 2 fully independent, external samples. Development and internal
testing was conducted in a split sample of 206 435 patients with T2D from Kaiser
Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care system. The tool was
externally tested in 1 335 966 Veterans Health Administration and 14 972 Group Health
Cooperative patients with T2D.
EXPOSURES Based on a literature review, we identified 156 candidate predictor variables
(prebaseline exposures) using data collected from electronic medical records.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital use during 12 months
of follow-up.
RESULTS The derivation sample (n = 165 148) had a mean (SD) age of 63.9 (13.0) years and
included 78 576 (47.6%) women. The crude annual rate of at least 1 hypoglycemia-related ED
or hospital encounter in the KPNC derivation sample was 0.49%. The resulting hypoglycemia
risk stratification tool required 6 patient-specific inputs: number of prior episodes of
hypoglycemia-related utilization, insulin use, sulfonylurea use, prior year ED use, chronic
kidney disease stage, and age. We categorized the predicted 12-month risk of any
hypoglycemia-related utilization as high (>5%), intermediate (1%-5%), or low (<1%). In the
internal validation sample, 2.0%, 10.7%, and 87.3% were categorized as high, intermediate,
and low risk, respectively, with observed 12-month hypoglycemia-related utilization rates of
6.7%, 1.4%, and 0.2%, respectively. There was good discrimination in the internal validation
KPNC sample (C statistic = 0.83) and both external validation samples (Veterans Health
Administration: C statistic = 0.81; Group Health Cooperative: C statistic = 0.79).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This hypoglycemia risk stratification tool categorizes the
12-month risk of hypoglycemia-related utilization in patients with T2D using only 6 inputs.
This tool could facilitate targeted population management interventions, potentially reducing
hypoglycemia risk and improving patient safety and quality of life.

 A
dvances in diabetes clinical care and medical treat-
ment have reduced the risk of long-term complica-
tions and mortality for the more than 25 million Ameri-
cans who have diabetes.1 However, iatrogenic hypoglycemia
associated with glucose-lowering medication use has become
a critical public health and drug safety concern.2-4 Severe hy-
poglycemiaisdefinedasaneventnecessitatingassistancefrom
another person to actively administer carbohydrates, gluca-
gon,orotherresuscitativeactions.5Suchassistanceisoftenren-
dered professionally in emergency department (ED) or hospi-
tal encounters and is captured as hypoglycemia-related
utilization.6
Whereas the risk of severe hypoglycemia is known to be
elevated in patients with type 1 diabetes, the risk has been his-
torically underappreciated among patients with type 2 diabe-
tes (T2D), which make up most of the diabetes population. Hy-
poglycemia is now one of the most frequent adverse events in
patients with T2D and is more common than acute hypergly-
cemic emergencies (eg, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state),7
particularly among older patients and those with a longer
history of diabetes.8 One in 4 emergency hospitalizations for
adversedrugeventsisrelatedtohypoglycemia,andtheserates
are higher in older patients.9 Severe hypoglycemia has been
associated with falls and automobile accidents,10 cardiovas-
cular autonomic dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmia,11
dementia,12 and death.13,14 Patients report that fear of hypo-
glycemia can dissuade them from initiating newly prescribed
insulin.15 Hypoglycemia is also strongly predictive of poorer
health-relatedqualityoflife16andmorediabetesdistress.17Hy-
poglycemia-related utilization is costly; total annual direct
medical costs were estimated at approximately $1.8 billion in
2009 in the United States.18
The risk of hypoglycemia varies widely in patients with
T2D.19 Whereas interventions to prevent hypoglycemia
exist,20-24 there are no validated methods to target these
interventions efficiently. Accordingly, we developed and
validated a hypoglycemia risk stratification tool to catego-
rize 12-month risk of hypoglycemia-related emergency
department (ED) or hospital use among patients with T2D.
This study was approved by the institutional review boards
of Kaiser Permanente, the Bedford Veterans Health Admin-
istration, and Group Health Cooperative; the requirement
that informed consent be obtained from study participants
was waived.
Methods
Study Design
We used a prospective cohort study design to develop a risk
tool to categorize the 12-month risk of hypoglycemia-related
ED or hospital use. Selection of prebaseline candidate predic-
tors was based on a literature review of clinical risk factors as-
sociated with hypoglycemia and limited to data typically avail-
able in electronic medical records (EMRs). We derived and
internally validated this tool in a split sample (4:1) of 206 435
adult patients with T2D in an integrated health care delivery
system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California [KPNC]) using
clinical and demographic data from EMRs. We used recursive
partitioning in the derivation sample to create a risk classifi-
cation tree. The classification tree leaf nodes were further cat-
egorized into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk groups on the
basis of predicted risk and then transcribed into the hypogly-
cemia risk stratification tool. After testing the tool in the in-
ternal sample, we conducted external validation in 2 com-
pletely independent samples of patients with T2D from the
Veterans Administration Diabetes Epidemiology Cohort
(DEpiC) (VA sample, n = 1 335 966)25 and from Group Health
Cooperative (GH sample, n = 14 972).
Study Population
Using EMR data from KPNC, we identified 233 330 adults (≥21
years as of the baseline date of January 1, 2014) with diabetes
with continuous health plan membership for 24 months pre-
baseline and pharmacy benefits for 12 months prebaseline. We
excluded24 719patientswithunknowndiabetestypeand3615
with probable type 1 diabetes according to an algorithm (based
on age of onset <30 years and use of insulin alone26). The re-
maining206 435eligiblepatientswithT2Dwererandomlysplit
into an 80% derivation sample (n = 165 148) for tool develop-
ment and a 20% internal validation sample (n = 41 287). Simi-
lar eligibility criteria were applied in the creation of the 2 ex-
ternal validation samples.
Outcome
Our outcome was the occurrence of any hypoglycemia-
related ED or hospital use during 12 months postbaseline. This
was defined by having any ED visit with a primary diagnosis
of hypoglycemia or a hospitalization with a principal diagno-
sis of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia cases were ascertained ac-
cording to a validated definition27 (any of the following Inter-
nationalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevision(ICD-9),codes:
251.0, 251.1, 251.2, 962.3, or 250.8, without concurrent 259.8,
272.7, 681.XX, 682.XX, 686.9X, 707.1-707.9, 709.3, 730.0-
730.2, or 731.8 codes). Secondary discharge diagnoses for hy-
poglycemia were not used because they are often attribut-
abletoeventsthatoccurredduringtheEDorhospitalencounter
(eg, inpatient insulin management, sepsis, acute renal
failure28).
Key Points
Question Can electronic medical records be used to reliably
categorize risk of future hypoglycemia-related emergency
department or hospital use in patients with type 2 diabetes?
Findings We developed and validated a risk stratification tool that
categorized patients’12-month risk of hypoglycemia-related
utilization using only 6 electronic medical record–based inputs
(patient history of hypoglycemia-related utilization, insulin use,
sulfonylurea use, emergency department use, chronic kidney
disease, and age). Tool performance was validated in 2 fully
independent populations.
Meaning This hypoglycemia risk stratification tool could facilitate
efficient targeting of population management interventions to
reduce hypoglycemia risk and improve patient safety.

 Exposures
On the basis of a literature review of clinical risk factors asso-
ciated with hypoglycemia in T2D, we selected 156 (122 cat-
egorical and 34 continuous) candidate clinical, demographic,
and behavioral predictor variables for model development
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). To increase the utility of our pre-
diction model in other health care settings (transportability,
usability29), we excluded variables that were expensive or
impractical to collect, had ambiguous meanings, or were not
typicallyavailableinanEMR.Medicationexposureswerebased
on pharmacy dispensings during 6 months prebaseline; labo-
ratory values were based on the last test results within 2 years
prebaseline; and prior medical events (eg, history of hypogly-
cemia-related utilization using the same outcome definition)
were based on all available prebaseline records (maximum, 18
years of medical history; mean [SD], 16.5 [3.4] years).
Statistical Analysis
We used standard methodology for model development in-
cludingasplitsampleandinternalandexternalvalidation.30-33
We first regressed the outcome (any hypoglycemia-related uti-
lization) on each of the 156 candidate predictors using uni-
variate logistic regression models to generate odds ratios. We
selected candidate variables that had a resulting P < .10. We
then used recursive partitioning (using SAS JMP, version 1234)
on the selected candidates to construct a binary classifica-
tion tree to predict the occurrence of at least 1 hypoglycemia-
related utilization episode 12 months postbaseline. Recur-
sive partitioning is widely used to generate clinical decision
support tools.32,35,36 This method uses a machine-learning,
nonlinear, and nonparametric approach to split (“partition”)
events into pairs of subgroups based on continuous or cat-
egorical predictors, and has the unique advantage that it iden-
tifies complex nested interactions, unlike linear modeling
methods. Recursive partitioning also optimizes cut points
ratherthanrelyingonprespecification.Thus,theresultantclas-
sification tree identifies predictors that may be important for
1 segment of the population but not others, as well as identi-
fying critical thresholds in continuous or ordinal predictors.
We pruned branches from the classification tree in an at-
tempt to optimize predictive accuracy (performance), model
simplicity, practicality of implementation, and intuitive clini-
cal interpretation.31,33 Overly complex models (overfitting),
while potentially offering somewhat greater precision, may be
less practical, increase the decision and classification costs (ex-
pense and time of compiling the predictors), and introduce
propagatederrorassociatedwithpredictorsmeasuredwithun-
certainty.
Validation Studies
Model accuracy was assessed in the internal validation sample
using standard metrics.30-32(pp255-310),37-39 Discrimination, the
ability of a model to accurately distinguish between subjects
who do vs do not develop the outcome, is based on the area
underthereceiver-operatorcurve(Cstatistic),withgreaterthan
0.7 classified as good discrimination. We also visually as-
sessedcalibration(theextenttowhichthepredictedrisksover-
or underestimate the observed risks) using calibration plots.
Given that our goal was not to quantify the numeric probabil-
ity of a hypoglycemia episode for a given patient but rather to
stratify our population into categories of risk, we focused on
model discrimination over calibration.33,40
We further evaluated components of generalizability33,39
(ie, reproducibility in patients not used for the derivation of
the model) and transportability (practical application in dif-
ferent settings) in the 2 external primary care T2D popula-
tions (VA and GH samples).32,33,41 Because these samples in-
cludedadifferentdiseaseseverityandcasemixofpatientswith
T2D from distinct geographical locations with different meth-
ods for identifying patients with diabetes, the validation ex-
ercises also tested the spectrum, geographic, and method-
ological transportability of the model.32,33
Sensitivity Analyses
We developed this risk stratification tool using all of the pa-
tients’availablemedicalhistoriesatKPNC(upto18years);how-
ever, long enrollment may be uncommon in other health care
settings. Thus, we conducted further analyses to evaluate
whetherourtoolwassensitivetorestrictionsinavailablelength
of enrollment (prebaseline period transportability33). We also
evaluated temporal sensitivity (historical transportability33) of
the tool by applying it to KPNC data in the subsequent year
(using a baseline date of January 1, 2015). This tool was opti-
mized for patients with T2D, and because not all health care
settings can reliably determine diabetes type from their EMR,
we also evaluated tool performance when patients with type
1 diabetes were included (ie, sensitivity to misclassification).
Finally,asameasureofecologicalvalidityofthistool,weevalu-
ated the association between the predicted level of risk of
hypoglycemia-related utilization and actual, self-reported

patients with T2D.
Results
Model Selection
Thefinalclassificationtreewasbasedon6patient-specificvari-
ables: total number of prior episodes of hypoglycemia-
related ED or hospital utilization (0, 1-2, ≥3 times), number of
ED encounters for any reason in the prior 12 months (<2, ≥2
times), insulin use (yes/no), sulfonylurea use (yes/no), pres-
ence of severe or end-stage kidney disease (dialysis or chronic
kidney disease stage 4 or 5 determined by estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate of ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated by the
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creati-
nine equation)43 (yes/no), and age younger than 77 years (yes/
no) (Figure 1). This classification tree resulted in 10 mutually
exclusive leaf nodes, each yielding an estimated annual risk
of hypoglycemia-related utilization, which were categorized
as high (>5%), intermediate (1%-5%), or low (<1%). In the KPNC
internal validation sample, 2.0% were categorized as high risk,
10.7% as intermediate risk, and 87.3% as low risk.
We then transcribed the classification model into a simple,
checklist style, hypoglycemia risk stratification tool by map-
ping the combinations of risk factors to high, intermediate, or

 low risk of having any hypoglycemia-related utilization in the
following 12 months (Figure 2). This tool instructs the user to
identify only 1 of 6 mutually exclusive options, where the first
5 are each defined by a unique combination of predictor vari-
ables, and the sixth option is indicated only after ruling out
all other options (eTable 2 in the Supplement provides the
source code).
Patient Characteristics
We compared the distribution of the 6 predictor variables in
our derivation and validation samples (Table 1). There were no
significant differences in the distribution of the 6 predictors
between the KPNC derivation vs validation samples, but there
weresignificantdifferencesacrossexternalvalidationsamples.
The proportion of men and women was similar in the KPNC
andGHsamples,whiletheVAsamplewaspredominantlymen.
The mean age was similar across sites, although the propor-
tion older than 77 years was greater in the VA (24.6%), fol-
lowed by KPNC (17.8%), and GH samples (13.2%). The VA
sample had the highest proportion of patients with severe or
end-stage kidney disease (3.7%), and 3 or more prior hypogly-
cemic events (0.4%) vs 2.0% and 0.1%, respectively, in GH. In-
sulin use was lower in the KPNC samples (20.3%) compared
withtheGH(30.9%)andVAsamples(30.2%).Sulfonylureause
was higher in the KPNC samples (34.9%) compared with the
VA (25.0%) and GH (22.5%) samples. The observed annual rate
of hypoglycemia-related utilization was lower in GH patients
(0.30%) compared with the KPNC derivation sample (0.49%)
and the VA (0.51%).
Model Validation
Internal validation of the classification tree model indicated
highdiscrimination(Cstatistic = 0.83)andgoodcalibration(no
significant differences between predicted and observed risk:
Pearson χ2 goodness-of-fit P = .31) (Table 2). The odds ratios
of hypoglycemia-related utilization among those categorized
as high relative to low risk were large in each sample: KPNC
internal validation sample (34.6; 95% CI, 24.2-49.3), VA (23.3;
95% CI, 21.9-24.7), and GH (20.7; 95% CI, 8.6-45.0; P < .001).
The tool also performed well in terms of discrimination in
the external validation samples (VA C statistic = 0.81; GH C sta-
tistic = 0.79). Visual inspection of the calibration plots showed
a reasonable match between the predicted and observed risk
of hypoglycemia-related utilization within the 10 leaf nodes
(Figure 3). However, the tool somewhat overestimated risk
among the leaf nodes in the intermediate- and higher-risk cat-
egories in the external validation samples.
Sensitivity Analyses
In the sensitivity analyses for length of available medical his-
tory, good discrimination was confirmed despite shorter medi-
cal history (C statistic = 0.82, 0.83, 0.84 for ≤2, ≤5, and ≤10

Hypoglycemic-related utilization was defined by having any ED visit with a
primary diagnosis of hypoglycemia or a hospitalization with a principal diagnosis
of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia cases were ascertained with any of the
following International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes: 251.0,
251.1, 251.2, 962.3, or 250.8, without concurrent 259.8, 272.7, 681.XX, 682.XX,
686.9X, 707.1-707.9, 709.3, 730.0-730.2, or 731.8 codes.27 The classification
tree was developed using the 808 out of 165 148 T2D adults (derivation
sample) from Kaiser Permanente who had such utilization (4.9 events per 1000
person-years) in 2014. The classification is based on 6 predictor variables from
the electronic medical record and resulted in 10 mutually exclusive leaf nodes.
The criterion for each node is displayed with the corresponding number of
individuals (n) who met that criterion. The 12-month observed rate of any
hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital use is displayed in each leaf node and
categorized as high (>5% risk), intermediate (1%-5% risk), or low risk (<1% risk).
CKD indicates chronic kidney disease.

 years, respectively). We then evaluated temporal sensitivity
(historical transportability33). There was good discrimination
(C statistic = 0.83) even after KPNC experienced a significant
21% increase in the rate of hypoglycemia-related utilization
(0.48% vs 0.59% for 2014 and 2015, respectively). We also
evaluated sensitivity to misclassification of diabetes type by
including all diabetes patients in our sample and found good
discrimination (C statistic = 0.84).
In the assessment of ecological validity, there was a strong
associationbetweenpredictedriskofhypoglycemia-relateduti-
lization and self-reported severe hypoglycemia (ie, hypogly-
cemia necessitating assistance in the past 12 months). Pa-
tients categorized as high risk by the tool were 5 times more
likely (49.7% vs 9.2%; P < .001) to self-report a severe hypo-
glycemic episode relative to those categorized as low risk.
Discussion
Health care systems currently lack an evidence-based method
for efficiently and systematically identifying patients with T2D
at risk of hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital use. We devel-
oped and validated a pragmatic hypoglycemia risk stratifica-
tion tool that uses 6 factors to categorize the 12-month risk
of hypoglycemia-related utilization. This tool uses EMR
data only and requires no patient contact; it offers an effi-
cient, low-cost approach for identifying patients for targeted
interventions to reduce their risk of hypoglycemia.21,44-48 Be-
cause of the harms and costs associated with hypoglycemia,
high-risk patients are candidates for an elevated level of scru-
tiny. Identifying medication overtreatment49-51 and includ-
ing hypoglycemia rates as a health plan–level quality mea-
sure have been recommended to drive accountability and
quality improvement.52-54
This tool is intended to offer a practical method to risk
stratify patients for population management. For example, in-
tensive interventions aimed at reducing hypoglycemia risk
could be targeted at the minority of patients with T2D in the
high-risk category (2% of patients with diabetes at KPNC).
These interventions could include deintensifying or simpli-
fying medication regimens, addressing impaired hypoglyce-
mic awareness, prescribing glucagon kits or continuous
glucose monitors, making referrals to clinical pharmacists or
nurse care managers, providing additional diabetes educa-
tion, and regularly asking about hypoglycemia events occur-
ring outside the medical setting. Clinician discussions could
address potential contributors to hypoglycemia, including
behavioral (eg, meal skipping55), psychosocial (eg, food
insufficiency56,57), or socioeconomic (eg, deprivation58) fac-
tors. Similarly, a lower-cost, less intensive intervention could
be designed for patients in the intermediate-risk category (11%
at KPNC). The intervention could include system-level struc-
tural modifications such as risk-based glycemic targets, auto-
mated clinical alert flags in the EMR, and automated messag-
ing to patients with elevated risk. Moreover, the tool could be
modified to identify specific subsets of risk groups such those
with 3 or more hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital encoun-
ters whom our model identifies as having the highest risk.

Tool Inputs
 • How many times has the patient ever had hypoglycemia-related utilization in an ED (primary diagnosis of hypoglycemiaa) or
  hospital (principal diagnosis of hypoglycemiaa) (0, 1-2, ≥3 times)?
 • How many times has the patient gone to an ED for any reason in the prior 12 months (<2, ≥2 times)?
 • Does the patient use insulin (yes/no)?
 • Does the patient use sulfonylurea (yes/no)?
 • Does the patient have severe or end-stage kidney disease  (CKD stage 4 or 5) (yes/no)?
 • Is the patient <77 years old (yes/no)?
Instructions: The 6 inputs above are used to identify one of the mutually exclusive exposure groups and the corresponding risk 
category (high, low, or intermediate) for hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital utilizationb in the following 12 months. The first 5

 While it is unknown to what extent clinicians are aware
of a patient’
s hypoglycemia risk, there is evidence that clini-
cians and patients with diabetes do not communicate about
hypoglycemia events that occur outside clinical settings.59,60
Almost all (roughly 95%) severe hypoglycemia events may go
clinically unrecognized because they did not result in ED or
hospital use.61 In an internal review of EMRs of KPNC pa-
tients with T2D, hypoglycemia was absent from the problem
lists in 85% of patients categorized by our tool as being at high
risk, underscoring the potential for this tool to increase clini-
cians’awareness of the risk of hypoglycemia in their patients
with T2D.
Limitations
Some limitations should be noted. The final classification
tree was one of many possible options, chosen on the basis
of performance (eg, C statistic), parsimony, and pragmatism
(eg, we excluded predictors that are typically unavailable,

 impractical, or costly to assess in usual care settings). In de-
veloping the model, we excluded secondary discharge diag-
noses for hypoglycemia because these events may occur
during the ED or hospital encounter (eg, inpatient insulin man-
agement,sepsis,acuterenalfailure28),ratherthanbeingacause
of the encounter. On the other hand, hypoglycemia could be
a secondary diagnosis if the primary or principal diagnosis is
trauma due to an automobile accident or a serious fall caused
by hypoglycemia. Although we did not include those events
in our model development, we estimate that this would in-
clude less than 2% of ED encounters (data not shown). When
validating this model, we emphasized discrimination rather
than calibration given that our goal was to risk stratify pa-
tients into broad categories rather than predicting the con-
tinuous level of risk.40 Thus, while the tool successfully strati-
fies the population into 3 levels of risk, it should not be used
to estimate the probability of hypoglycemic-related utiliza-
tion for an individual patient. Discrimination performance of
the tool was validated internally and externally in 2 large, in-
dependent populations, suggesting generalizability. Geo-
graphic,methodologic,andspectrumtransportabilitywerealso
demonstrated because these external validation populations
were from different geographical locations, used differing
methods of caring for and identifying patients with T2D, and
had different distributions of disease severity and case mix.
While the observed rates of hypoglycemia-related utilization
were lower in GH (0.3%) and somewhat higher in VA (0.51%)
compared with KPNC sample (0.49%), the tool had good dis-
crimination in all 3 samples. Some of the inconsistent find-
ingsareattributabletosparsedataintheGHvalidationsample;
only 45 events were observed during follow-up. It is also pos-
sible that the 2 external sample populations may experience
more prevention efforts than at KPNC, explaining the some-
what lower than expected risk in higher-risk patients in the
validation samples.
Thetoolwasdesignedtopredicthypoglycemia-relateduti-
lization and thus did not take into account severe hypoglyce-
mia occurring outside the health care system (roughly 95% of
hypoglycemic events necessitating third-party assistance are
treatedbypersonsotherthanmedicalprofessionals,eg,friends
or family61,62). However, we demonstrated a strong and sig-
nificant association between the tool’
s stratification of the
risk of hypoglycemia-related utilization and a patient’
s self-
reported severe hypoglycemia events. Therefore, we believe
that preventive interventions targeting patients identified as
high risk by this tool may reduce the rate of severe hypogly-
cemic events that do not result in utilization or clinical recog-
nition. Finally, the tool also proved robust in internal valida-
tions when patients with type 1 diabetes were included
and when the availability of longitudinal EMR data was
restricted.
This risk stratification tool was developed and validated
in 3 vertically integrated health care delivery systems (KPNC,
GH, and the VA). The tool logic may be programmed into a
system’
s EMR to allow for automated risk stratification based
on the EMR data. Practical barriers may complicate im-
plementing this tool for population management in horizon-
tally integrated or nonintegrated health care delivery sys-
tems, for example, where pharmacy claims may not be
readily available.

classification tree, we multiplied the number of patients by the predicted rate
of hypoglycemia events to generate the number of expected events in that
node. We then summed the expected events from all nodes within each of the
3 risk levels to obtain expected event counts by risk level. The expected rates
for each 3-level stratum will therefore vary between samples due to case-mix
differences.

 Conclusions
This tool offers a practical, EMR-based method to stratify pa-
tients with T2D by their 12-month risk of hypoglycemia-
related ED or hospital utilization. This tool could be inte-
grated with targeted preventive interventions to facilitate
population management, which ultimately could reduce fu-
ture hypoglycemia risk and improve patient safety. The 2 cri-
teria indicating high risk are easily memorized (ie, ≥3 previ-
ous episodes of hypoglycemia-related utilization, or 1 or 2
episodes if treated with insulin). The criteria for intermediate
risk are more nuanced and therefore may be less likely to pro-
voke clinical action in primary care without prompting. Health
care systems could adopt a 2-level intervention, with inten-
sive (more expensive) interventions reserved for high-risk pa-
tients and less intensive (lower cost) interventions for the in-
termediate-risk patients. Implementation of this tool could
conceivably increase clinician awareness of patients’hypo-
glycemia risk. Clinical researchers may also find this tool help-
ful in identifying patients at high risk for hypoglycemic epi-
sodes for either purposeful inclusion or exclusion in clinical
trials of novel therapies and diagnostic tests. Quality improve-
mentandimpactstudies29areneededtoevaluatewhetherand
how implementation of this hypoglycemia risk stratification
tool may influence clinician behavior, patient decision mak-
ing, drug safety, and hypoglycemia incidence. Future re-
search is needed to develop patient-centered and cost-
effective interventions to reduce hypoglycemia risk in those
identified as being at high risk for hypoglycemia.
