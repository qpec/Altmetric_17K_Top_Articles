IMPORTANCE Guidelines recommend corticosteroids in patients with IgA nephropathy and
persistent proteinuria, but the effects remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in patients with IgA
nephropathy at risk of progression.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Therapeutic Evaluation of Steroids in IgA
Nephropathy Global (TESTING) study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical
trial designed to recruit 750 participants with IgA nephropathy (proteinuria greater than 1 g/d
and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 20 to 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 after at least
3 months of blood pressure control with renin-angiotensin system blockade] and to provide
follow-up until 335 primary outcomes occurred.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to oral methylprednisolone (0.6-0.8 mg/kg/d;
maximum, 48 mg/d) (n = 136) or matching placebo (n = 126) for 2 months, with subsequent
weaning over 4 to 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary composite outcome was end-stage kidney
disease, death due to kidney failure, or a 40% decrease in eGFR. Predefined safety outcomes
were serious infection, new diabetes, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fracture/osteonecrosis,
and cardiovascular events. The mean required follow-up was estimated to be 5 years.
RESULTS After randomization of 262 participants (mean age, 38.6 [SD, 11.1] years; 96 [37%]
women; eGFR, 59.4 mL/min/1.73 m2; urine protein excretion, 2.40 g/d) and 2.1 years’ median
follow-up, recruitment was discontinued because of excess serious adverse events. Serious
events occurred in 20 participants (14.7%) in the methylprednisolone group vs 4 (3.2%) in
the placebo group (P = .001; risk difference, 11.5% [95% CI, 4.8%-18.2%]), mostly due to
excess serious infections (11 [8.1%] vs 0; risk difference, 8.1% [95% CI, 3.5%-13.9%];
P < .001), including 2 deaths. The primary renal outcome occurred in 8 participants (5.9%) in
the methylprednisolone group vs 20 (15.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.37 [95%
CI, 0.17-0.85]; risk difference, 10.0% [95% CI, 2.5%-17.9%]; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria of
1 g/d or greater, oral methylprednisolone was associated with an increased risk of serious
adverse events, primarily infections. Although the results were consistent with potential renal
benefit, definitive conclusions about treatment benefit cannot be made, owing to early
termination of the trial.

mmunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most prevalent pri-
mary glomerular disease, particularly in the Asia-Pacific
region.1 Up to 30% of all people with IgA nephropathy will
eventually develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)2; de-
creased kidney function, persistent proteinuria, and hyper-
tension are the strongest risk factors.3,4
Theuseofrenin-angiotensinsystem(RAS)blockadehasbeen

risk IgA nephropathy5,6 and is thus guideline-recommended

develop ESKD, so better treatments are required.
Although IgA nephropathy is an immune-complex–
mediated glomerulonephritis, the role of immunosuppres-
sion remains controversial.8 A meta-analysis of previous trials
suggested substantial benefit with corticosteroid therapy, but
trialqualitywassuboptimal,mosttrialsweresingle-center,and
adverse outcomes were poorly reported.9 Additionally, the
efficacy of corticosteroids in patients with impaired kidney
function was not evaluated, and limited data exist for people
of Eastern or South-Asian origin.10-12 Global guidelines cur-
rently suggest a 6-month course of corticosteroids for indi-
viduals with urinary protein excretion persistently above 1 g/d
and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than
50 mL/min/1.73 m2 after at least 3 months of appropriate sup-
portive care. However, it is acknowledged that this weak rec-
ommendation is based on low-quality evidence.7
In addition, a recent trial of immunosuppression in IgA
nephropathy13 found that the addition of immunosuppres-
sion to intensive supportive care in 162 European partici-
pants reduced proteinuria but did not reduce the rate of eGFR
decline over 3 years. As a result, it remains uncertain whether
corticosteroidtherapyisbeneficialinIgAnephropathyandhow
any benefits might trade off against potential risks.
The present study was designed to test the efficacy and
safety of full-dose corticosteroid therapy in preventing clini-
cally important kidney outcomes in patients with high-risk
IgA nephropathy.
Methods
Study Design and Patients
The Therapeutic Evaluation of Steroids in IgA Nephropathy
Global (TESTING) study was an investigator-initiated, multi-
center, double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing oral
methylprednisolone with placebo on the risk of important
kidneyoutcomesinpeoplewithIgAnephropathyreceivingap-
propriate supportive therapy, including blood pressure con-
trol and RAS blockade.
The study was overseen by a management committee,
coordinated by an academic research organization (The
George Institute for Global Health), and designed to be con-
ducted in up to 100 centers from China, Australia, India,
Canada, and Malaysia. Ethical approval to conduct the trial
was obtained from Peking University, the University of Syd-
ney, and the ethics committees of each study center; all par-
ticipants provided written informed consent. The study pro-
tocol is available in Supplement 1.
Eligibility required a diagnosis of primary IgA nephropa-
thy proven on kidney biopsy, an eGFR between 20 and
120 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated using the Chronic Kidney
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation14),
and urinary protein excretion greater than 1 g/d. Exclusion
criteria included a strong indication, or contraindication, for
corticosteroid therapy, based on the judgement of the treat-
ing physician (patients were included if the patient and phy-
sician had clinical equipoise regarding the use of the treat-
ment), or the use of systemic immunosuppressive therapy
in the previous year.
The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the
eTable 1 in Supplement 2. Given the planned multinational re-
cruitment and potential for differences in response by ethnic-
ity, self-reported racial origin by patients was collected and re-
corded by the investigators, based on prespecified categories.
Randomization and Masking
Patients who were adherent to treatment and who had per-
sistent proteinuria greater than 1 g/d during the run-in period
were randomly assigned 1:1 via a password-protected en-
crypted website interface to receive oral methylprednisolone
or matching placebo, stratified by region; proteinuria (<3 g/d
or ≥3 g/d); eGFR (<50 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2);
and kidney biopsy findings (endocapillary proliferation sta-
tus [E1 or E0] according to the Oxford classification).15 Ran-
domization was performed using a minimization algorithm
based on the stratification variables; the algorithm was cen-
trally generated and used by all centers to minimize any im-
balances in key variables. Patients, investigators, site staff, and
sponsors were masked to treatment assignment for the dura-
tion of the study.
Procedures
Potentially eligible participants entered a run-in period from
4 to 12 weeks, during which treatment was adjusted to en-
sure that they were receiving the maximum labeled or toler-
ated dose of RAS blockade, along with optimized blood pres-
sure control according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for glomerulonephritis and hy-
pertension, for at least 3 months prior to randomization. Study
Key Points
Question Do corticosteroids safely prevent loss of kidney
function in patients with IgA nephropathy receiving optimal
supportive therapy?
Findings This randomized clinical trial that included 262
participants was stopped early (after 28 of the 335 planned
events) due to a significantly increased risk of serious adverse
events with oral methylprednisolone vs placebo (14.7% vs 3.2%,
primarily excess infections); at that point, the primary efficacy
outcome favored methylprednisolone (5.9% vs 15.9%).
Meaning Oral corticosteroid therapy was associated with an
increased risk of serious adverse events; the effect on kidney
outcomes remains uncertain due to the limited number of events.

 treatment consisted of 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg/d of oral methylpred-
nisoloneormatchingplacebo(roundedtothenearest4mgand
with a maximal dose of 48 mg/d) for 2 months, then tapered
by 8 mg/d each month, with a total treatment period of 6 to
8 months.
Participants were followed up at regular intervals, for a
plannedmeanofatleast5years.Studyvisitsoccurredmonthly
for 3 months after randomization, then every 3 months until
month 12, and every 12 months until the end of the study. Ad-
ditional telephone or face-to-face (at the choice of the inves-
tigator) visits were required at 3-month intervals to ascertain
kidney end points or adverse events.
Laboratory evaluation of all specimens was performed in
a national central laboratory in China and at local laborato-
ries in other countries. Serum creatinine levels were mea-
sured using enzymatic or Jaffe methods with calibration trace-
able to isotope dilution mass spectrometry.
End Points
The primary composite end point was initially defined as the
first occurrence of a 50% decrease in eGFR, the development
of ESKD (defined as a need for maintenance dialysis or kid-
ney transplantation and adjudicated by a blinded, indepen-
dentcommittee),ordeathduetokidneydisease.Basedoncon-
sensus recommendations from a workshop sponsored by the
National Kidney Foundation and the US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration on renal end points,16,17 the steering committee
decided to modify the creatinine-based component of the pri-
mary end point to a 40% decrease in eGFR in November 2014,
prior to knowledge of any results, while other components of
the primary end point remained unchanged.
Secondary end points included the composite of ESKD,
40% decrease in eGFR, and all-cause death; the composite
of ESKD, 50% decrease in eGFR, and all-cause death; and
each of ESKD, death due to kidney disease, and all-cause
death. The secondary end points also included proteinuria
reduction evaluated by time-averaged proteinuria and eGFR
slope across all postrandomization study visits. Prespecified
exploratory end points included (1) a 25% decrease in eGFR
assessed separately or as part of a composite with ESKD and
all-cause death; (2) annual slope in the inverse of serum cre-
atinine level; (3) proteinuria remission at months 6, 12, and
24; and (4) disappearance of hematuria at last follow-up.
A statistical analysis plan (Supplement 3) was developed by
a subgroup of the steering committee, blinded to any infor-
mation about study outcomes.
Adverse Events and Safety
Predefined safety outcomes were all-cause mortality, total se-
rious adverse events, serious infections, new diabetes, gas-
trointestinal hemorrhage, fracture or osteonecrosis, and car-
diovascularevents.Seriousadverseevents(SAEs)weredefined
according to the International Conference on Harmonization
Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management.
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
Anindependentdataandsafetymonitoringcommittee(DSMC)
met twice yearly to review efficacy and safety data; 2 formal
interim efficacy analyses were planned when one-third and
two-thirds of the primary end points had occurred, using stop-
ping boundaries defined using the O’
Brien Fleming method,
while the decisions about stopping for harm were not based
on predefined statistical rules. The DSMC could recommend
terminating the study early if there was clear and substantial
evidence of benefit or if the risk of adverse events was deter-
mined to likely substantially outweigh the potential benefits
(Supplement 4).
Statistical Analysis
The initial sample-size calculations assumed an annual com-
bined event rate for the primary end point (50% eGFR de-
crease, ESKD, and death due to kidney disease) of 7%, requir-
ing 1300 participants to detect a 30% relative risk reduction
in the primary end point with 90% power (α = .05). A 30% risk
reduction was selected because it was the upper bound of the
95% confidence interval in a meta-analysis of previous trials
assessing steroids for IgA nephropathy.9 After the primary end
point was modified to include a 40% reduction in eGFR, the
estimated annual event rate increased to 12% based on data
from a large Chinese cohort18 and a previous trial,10 and the
required sample size was reduced to 750 participants to pro-
vide more than 90% power to detect a 30% risk reduction with
methylprednisolone. The trial was event-driven throughout,
with a total of 335 primary outcomes expected over a mean
follow-up of 5 years.
All analyses were conducted according to the intention-
to-treat principle. The effect of treatment on the primary
composite end point was estimated using an unadjusted Cox
proportional hazards model. The proportionality assumption
was assessed by plotting log{−log[S(t)]} and assessing
whether the curves were parallel and with a test of interac-
tion between time and treatment in the Cox model. Data for
patients were censored at the date of death or the date of data
extraction for those still alive. Because of small numbers,
other composite end points as well as the individual compo-
nents were summarized as the proportions of patients with at
least 1 event and compared using Fisher exact test. Confi-
dence intervals for risk differences were calculated using the
Newcombe score method.
The yearly rate of eGFR decline was calculated as the mean
of the individual slopes obtained from individual linear regres-
sions of eGFR over time. Time-averaged proteinuria was cal-
culated as the weighted mean of all postrandomization mea-
surements,withweightsrepresentingthetimeelapsedsincethe
previous measurement. Mean eGFR slopes and mean time-
averaged proteinuria values were compared across treatments
using t tests. Overall differences in eGFR and proteinuria over
time were estimated using linear mixed models including all
postrandomizationmeasurements.Fixedeffectsincludedbase-
line measurement, month (as a categorical variable with 5 cat-
egories), treatment group, and the interaction between month
and treatment group. A random intercept by participant was
used to model within-participant correlations. Complete re-
mission of proteinuria was defined as achievement of urinary
protein level less than 200 mg/d, and partial remission as 50%
or greater proteinuria reductions, with achieved urine protein

 less than 1 g/d. Details on the analysis of exploratory end points
are included in the statistical analysis plan (Supplement 3).
All P values were 2-sided, and P values less than .05 were
considered to indicate statistical significance. Formal adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons was not performed, but analy-
ses were interpreted conservatively in light of the number of
outcomesassessed,andeffectsonsecondaryoutcomesshould
be considered exploratory.
The homogeneity of the treatment effects on the primary
outcome across specified subgroups was tested by adding in-
teraction terms to the Cox models, with predefined sub-
groups including proteinuria (<3.0 vs ≥3.0 g/d), eGFR (<50 vs
≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2), endocapillary hypercellularity on his-
tological scoring (yes or no), and baseline maximum toler-
ated dose of RAS blockade (>80%, 50%-80%, and <50%
achieved of maximum labeled dose). All analyses were per-
formed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Between May 2012 and November 2015, 523 potentially eli-
gible patients were screened, of whom 262 (48.8%) were eli-
gible and underwent randomization (136 to methylpredniso-
lone, 126 to placebo) (Figure 1). Recruitment was stopped
early, and study treatment discontinued among randomized
participants, owing to an excess of SAEs (mostly infections)
in the corticosteroid group, based on advice from the DSMC
at a regularly scheduled meeting in November 2015 that con-
cluded that the trial should not continue in its current form;
the full recommendations of the DSMC are reported in
Supplement 5. The steering committee accepted this advice
and decided to terminate the study intervention on this basis
on November 13, 2015.
After termination of study intervention, patients still re-
ceiving study drug were unblinded and those receiving meth-
ylprednisolone were asked to return for a safety-assessment
visit;allparticipantswereaskedtoreturnforanadditionalstudy
visit at which updated informed consent for ongoing data col-
lection, and additional information regarding study out-
comes, was obtained. After termination, the study began tran-
sitioningfromthetreatmentphasetocontinuingfollow-upwhile
participants were no longer receiving randomized therapy; a
transitional analysis was conducted and is reported here.
Participants were recruited from China and Australia. Cen-
ters in India, Canada, and Malaysia joined the study later be-
cause of funding timing and were preparing to enroll partici-
pantswhenrecruitmentwasstopped,butnopatientshadbeen
recruited to the trial from these countries.
The 2 randomized groups had similar characteristics at
baseline (Table 1; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Overall, mean age
was 38.6 (SD, 11.1) years, 96 women (37%) were enrolled, mean
eGFR overall was 59.4 (25.0) mL/min/1.73 m2, and 24-hour
urine protein excretion was 2.40 (1.94) g/d. Blood pressure lev-
els at entry were well controlled and similar in the 2 groups
during follow-up (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). The median time
between biopsy and randomization was 139 days (interquar-
tile range [IQR], 107-244 days).
At the time of this transitional analysis, participants had
been in the study for a median of 25 months (range, 5.7-45.3
months). A total of 226 (86%) had completed study treat-
ment and were in the follow-up phase at the time the steering
committee made the decision to discontinue recruitment and
study therapy.
Twenty-eight SAEs were reported in 20 participants
(14.7%) in the methylprednisolone group compared with 4
SAEs in 4 (3.2%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 4.63
[95% CI, 1.63 to 13.2]; P = .001 by Fisher exact test) (Table 2
and Figure 2), equating to a risk difference of 11.5% (95% CI,
4.8% to 18.2%). Most adverse events occurred in the first 3
months of treatment. This was mainly driven by an excess of
serious infections (2 fatal) among 11 patients (8.1%) in the
methylprednisolone group, compared with no serious infec-
tions in the placebo group (risk difference, 8.1% [95% CI,
3.5% to 13.9%]; P < .001). One patient in the placebo group
died of stroke after commencing dialysis. Effects on SAE
rates were broadly consistent according to predefined base-
line subgroups (eFigure 2A in Supplement 2), but small
event numbers limited subgroup power.
The primary composite renal outcome occurred in 8 par-
ticipants (5.9%) in the methylprednisolone group and 20
(15.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.17
to0.85];P = .02;riskdifference,10.0%[95%CI,2.5%to17.9%])

 respectively, reaching ESKD (P = .10). A prespecified sub-
group analysis did not show evidence of significant differ-
ences in the effects of methylprednisolone on the composite
kidney failure outcome in subgroups defined by baseline pro-
teinuria (<3.0 vs ≥3.0 g/d), kidney function (eGFR <50 vs
≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2), histological lesion scoring (E1 vs E0 by

mary outcomes.
The effects on secondary outcomes are listed in Table 3.
Only 14 participants reached ESKD, with no clear difference
between the randomized groups. Of these participants, 7 had
a baseline eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and another 4
had baseline eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2. The
effects on other components of the primary outcome were di-
rectionally similar but not statistically significant. Partici-
pants randomized to corticosteroid therapy had a lower risk
of composite outcomes, including ESKD, all-cause death, and

 [95% CI, 0.42 to 9.89] mL/min/1.73 m2; P = .03). A prespeci-
fied sensitivity analysis excluding the treatment period with
highest corticosteroid exposure (from month 1 to 3, −0.11 vs
−6.38 mL/min/1.73 m2; risk difference, 6.27 [95% CI,
2.77 to 9.76] mL/min/1.73 m2; P < .001) and the entire treat-
ment exposure period (from month 1 to 6, −1.64 vs
−5.64 mL/min/1.73 m2; risk difference, 4.00 [95% CI, 1.22 to
6.78] mL/min/1.73 m2; P = .005) showed similar results. Analy-
ses using annual change of inverse of serum creatinine level
instead of eGFR showed similar results. The eGFR in the cor-
ticosteroid-treated group increased early and remained sig-
nificantly higher than in the placebo-treated group at each
studyvisit,to3yearsoffollow-up(Figure4A).Theoverallmean
difference (methylprednisolone − placebo) in eGFR over the
entire follow-up (months 3-36) was 6.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95%
CI, 2.9 to 9.3; P < .001).
Mean proteinuria during follow-up was significantly re-
ducedinthemethylprednisolone-treatedgroup(1.37[SD,1.08]
vs 2.36 (SD, 1.67) g/d; difference, −0.99 g/d [95% CI, −1.34 to
−0.64 g/d]; P < .001) (Figure 4B). This was consistent with the
overall difference estimated with linear mixed models (differ-
ence, −1.0 g/d [95% CI, −1.36 to −0.65]; P < .001). The propor-
tion of individuals achieving either complete or partial remis-
sion of proteinuria at 6 months was 45.1% in the corticosteroid
groupvs13.7%intheplacebogroup(riskdifference,31.4%[95%
CI, 18.9% to 42.5%]; P < .001), with similar results at 12 months
(52.2% vs 13.6%; risk difference, 38.5% [95% CI, 25.2% to
50.0%]; P < .001) and 24 months (48.2% vs 21.8%; risk differ-
ence, 26.4% [95% CI, 8.7% to 42.0%]; P = .005). At 6 months,
the rates of complete remission of proteinuria were 7.8% for
the corticosteroid group vs 1.1% for the placebo group (risk dif-
ference, 6.8% [95% CI, 0.8% to 13.6%]; P = .04) and of partial
remission were 45.1% vs 13.7% (risk difference, 31.4% [95% CI,
18.9% to 42.5%]; P < .001). Microscopic hematuria (defined as
at least 5 red blood cells per high-power field) was noted in 138
patients (62.2%) at baseline. Among those, 127 had at least 1
subsequent measurement, with 61 (48.0%) showing remis-
sion by the last visit. This occurred in 58.8% of participants in
the methylprednisolone group vs 35.6% in the placebo group
(risk difference, 23.2% [95% CI, 5.8% to 38.7%]; P = .01).
Discussion
This study assessed a full-dose corticosteroid regimen in pa-
tients with IgA nephropathy at high risk and found high rates
of serious adverse outcomes due mainly to an increased risk
of serious infections, resulting in the early cessation of recruit-
ment to the trial. While proteinuria and eGFR levels were im-
proved, and suggestions of potential benefit for the primary
outcome were observed, there were too few primary out-
comes to draw definitive conclusions about treatment effi-
cacy from this trial.
The nearly 5 times higher risk of SAEs is a particularly im-
portant finding, given that many previous corticosteroid trials
in IgA nephropathy have collected and reported adverse ef-
fects inconsistently.9 It is possible that the high rate of infec-
tions was related to the trial population or the specific treat-
ment regimen used in this study; however, the Supportive
Versus Immunosuppressive Therapy for the Treatment of Pro-
gressive IgA Nephropathy (STOP-IgAN) trial also collected and
reported detailed adverse-event data and found similarly high
ratesofsevereinfectionsamongtheimmunosuppressiongroup
(8.1% vs 9.8%), including 1 death in the combination immu-
nosuppression group.13 The excess of SAEs (mostly infec-
tions) observed in this study has implications for clinical de-
cision making and treatment guidelines for the use of
corticosteroids in IgA nephropathy. Future studies could also
consider the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy, which has
not been used in any of the completed studies and is not rec-
ommended in clinical practice guidelines.
While interpretation of the primary results is limited, the
findings are consistent with a meta-analysis of 9 smaller trials,
which found that corticosteroid therapy was associated with
a lower risk of composite renal outcomes (50% reduction in
eGFR or ESKD; relative risk, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.67]).19

 isanotherpossiblereason.Ongoingfollow-upofbothstudiesis
important to better define the longer-term kidney effects, par-
ticularly as the adverse events mostly occurred early, whereas
the benefits appeared to accrue throughout follow-up.
The early increase in eGFR observed in the corticosteroid-
treatedparticipantsraisesthepossibilitythatsomeoftheeGFR
effects may be due to sarcopenic effects of corticosteroid lead-
ing to reduced creatinine generation (eFigure 3 in Supplement
2) or due to corticosteroid-induced hyperfiltration.23,24 Ex-
cluding the creatinine measures during the treatment period
attenuated the difference in the rate of eGFR loss over time,
but it remained significantly lower in the corticosteroid-
treated group. The early reduction in proteinuria, as well as
the difference in rates of the more clinically important pri-
mary outcome, suggest that potentially clinically important
benefits are possible, which will be further clarified by the on-
going follow-up of study participants.
Strengthsofthistrialincludetherelativelylargesamplesize.
The ongoing participant follow-up will help to more accurately
assesstheefficacyofcorticosteroids.Thisstudyalsohasseveral
limitations. Although to our knowledge this is the largest trial
reportedtodateamongpatientswithIgAnephropathy,recruit-
ment was stopped earlier than planned because of excess
adverse events, so power was less than predicted, and both
risks and benefits might be overestimated as a result. Most
participantswereofasingleethnicity,meaningethnicity-based
treatment responses cannot be assessed. The reliance on
eGFR based on serum creatinine measurement is another
limitation,particularlybecausecorticosteroidsmayreducecre-
atinine generation.
Conclusions
Among patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria greater
than 1 g/d, oral methylprednisolone was associated with an in-
creased risk of serious adverse events, primarily infections. Al-
though the results are consistent with potential benefit, de-
finitive conclusions about treatment benefit cannot be made,
owing to early termination of the trial.
