Abstract
A continued increase in the proportion of adolescents who never smoke, 
as well as an understanding of factors that influence reductions in smoking 
among this susceptible population, is crucial. The World Health Organization 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control provides an appropriate structure 
to briefly examine Australian and New South Wales policies and programs 
that are influencing reductions in smoking among adolescents in Australia. 
This paper provides an overview of price and recent tax measures to reduce 
the demand for tobacco, the evolution of smoke-free environment policies, 
changes to tobacco labelling and packaging, public education campaigns, 
and restrictions to curb tobacco advertising. It also discusses supply-
reduction measures that limit adolescents’ access to tobacco products. 
Consideration is given to emerging priorities to achieve continued declines in 
smoking by Australian adolescents.
Introduction
Australia has seen consistent and marked reductions in both adolescent 
(aged 12−17 years) and young adult (aged 18−24 years) smoking. Between 
2001 and 2013, the proportion of young adults reporting they were ‘never 
smokers’ increased by almost 20 percentage points, from 58% to 77%.1 
Adolescent smoking is also at a record low, with only 3.4% of people aged 
12–17 years smoking daily.1 In addition, the average age of smoking initiation, 
or first full cigarette smoked, has increased from 14.2 years in 1995 to 
15.9 years in 2013.1 In New South Wales (NSW), the latest data show the 
proportion of adolescents reporting current smoking as 6.7% in 2014, down 
from 23.5% in 1996 (see Figure 1).2
Most smokers begin smoking before the age of 25, and, in high-
income countries, most begin smoking as adolescents.3 Although smoking 
prevalence continues a downward trend in countries such as Australia 
and the US, adolescent ‘replacement smokers’ continue to be targeted by 
tobacco industry marketing efforts.4
Continuing to increase the proportion of young people (adolescents and 
young adults) who are ‘never smokers’ is important for improving the overall 
health of the population. Further, understanding the factors that influence

Reductions in smoking among Australian adolescents 
2
reductions in smoking among this susceptible population 
is crucial for future policy development.
Substantial progress has been made in tobacco 
control to further this understanding. The World Health 
Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control (WHO FCTC) gives its signatories the impetus 
and structured approach to implement evidence based 
measures to address tobacco-related harm in their 
countries. The WHO FCTC provides an appropriate 
structure to briefly examine policies and programs that 
are influencing reductions in smoking among Australian 
adolescents. 
Price and tax measures to reduce 
demand for tobacco
Price measures are considered a critical component 
of comprehensive approaches to tackling tobacco use 
in adults and adolescents. The impact of increasing 
the price of cigarettes on product demand, specifically 
among adolescents, has been well established for more 
than three decades.5 The US Surgeon General recently 
concluded that taxes that increase the cost of tobacco 
reduce the uptake of smoking and the amount smoked.4 
Adolescents from lower socioeconomic status (SES) 
backgrounds are more price-sensitive to such increases 
than those from higher SES backgrounds.6 
In Australia, increased cigarette prices have 
been strongly associated with reductions in smoking 
across the general population, lower SES quintiles and 
adolescents.7,8 Between 1990 and 2005, the average 
price of a cigarette rose from $0.18 to $0.41.8 Of note, 
the Australian Government introduced changes to the 
tobacco excise system in 1999, moving from a weight-
based system (which was enabling the proliferation of 
larger and cheaper lightweight cigarette packs) to a 
‘per-stick’ system. During this time, national adolescent 
smoking prevalence (smoking in the past month) declined 
from 22.9% to 13.3%.8 After adjusting for other tobacco 
control policies that were active in Australia during this 
time, increasing cigarette prices was associated with 
reductions in adolescent smoking.8 In 2010, tobacco 
excise increased by 25%, with four subsequent annual 
increases of 12.5% from 2013 to 2016. 
Nonprice measures to reduce the 
demand for tobacco
Appropriately funded, sustained smoke-free environment 
policies targeted at the adult population (in particular, 
stronger clean indoor air restrictions) and adult-targeted 
mass media campaigns (as part of overall per capita 
national tobacco control funding) have been found to 
reduce smoking by adolescents.8−10 Australian regulatory 
changes that increased the size of graphic health warnings 
and introduced plain packaging are reducing cigarette 
pack appeal among adolescents11, and recent regulatory 
changes further restricting tobacco advertising, promotion 
and sponsorship at the point of sale have also helped to 
reduce smoking among Australian adolescents.12,13

Reductions in smoking among Australian adolescents 
3
Increasingly restrictive smoke-free environment 
regulations in indoor and certain outdoor public places 
have been introduced over the past 6 years in Australia. 
These include bans on smoking near children’s 
playgrounds, in open areas of public swimming pools, at 
major sports grounds, within specified distances of public 
buildings, at public transport stops and stations (including 
railway stations, bus stops, light rail stops, ferry wharves 
and taxi ranks), and in outdoor dining areas of restaurants, 
cafes and licensed premises. In NSW, the Public Health 
(Tobacco) Act 2008 made it an offence (from July 2009) 
to smoke in a car with a child under the age of 16, and 
imposes a $250 on-the-spot fine for the driver and any 
passenger breaking this law. Under the Smoke-free 
Environment Act 2000, smoking has been banned in NSW 
commercial outdoor dining areas since July 2015.
Australia has also seen significant increases in 
national- and state-funded mass media campaigns. The 
National Tobacco Campaign was launched in June 1997, 
and states and territories increased their investment in 
public health warnings about tobacco in subsequent 
years. In 2005, NSW and Victoria spearheaded a 
graphic health warning campaign, which was a major 
collaborative effort between states and territories.14 
In 2006, the Australian Competition and Consumer 
Commission launched a tobacco company–funded 
campaign to inform smokers that low-yield cigarettes 
were not a healthier alternative.15 Under the NSW 
Tobacco Strategy 2012–2017, NSW continues to invest 
in mass media campaigns as part of a comprehensive 
approach to tackling tobacco consumption.
Australia has been at the forefront of developments 
aimed at reducing the appeal of cigarette pack branding, 
through innovative packaging and labelling strategies. 
The introduction of graphic health warnings in 2006 
was associated with reduced intentions to smoke 
among adolescents.16 A key objective of the Australian 
Government’s tobacco plain packaging measure, 
introduced in 2012, was to reduce the attractiveness and 
appeal of tobacco products to consumers, particularly 
adolescents. Although it is too early to assess the long-
term impact of tobacco plain packaging, early results 
suggest that it has already reduced cigarette pack brand 
association among Australian adolescents, thus reducing 
the appeal of cigarette packs.11
The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 banned 
the broadcast and publication of tobacco advertisements 
in Australia. State and territory legislation, such as the 
NSW Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2008, banned in-store 
and other forms of advertisement and promotion of 
tobacco brands and products, and sponsorship of public 
events. Bans on tobacco retail point-of-sale displays 
have been shown to positively impact smoking-related 
outcomes for adolescents and further denormalise 
smoking.12 However, with traditional forms of tobacco 
advertising closed off, tobacco companies are seeking 
alternative ways to promote their products. On average, 
for every additional hour that young people spend on 
the internet daily, exposure to smoking in video games 
increases by 8%.17
Core provisions to reduce supply
The positive effect of government regulations aimed at 
controlling the supply of tobacco products to children and 
adolescents is well established.12,18 Preventing sales to 
minors can help to prevent the uptake of smoking, thus 
contributing to reduced smoking rates among minors.18,19 
Compliance is achieved through education, monitoring 
and enforcement of the law.18,19
In Australia, enforced tobacco control legislation has 
also contributed to declines in smoking by adolescents 
by restricting the supply of tobacco to minors and 
supporting denormalisation of smoking.8 In NSW, the 
Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2008 makes it illegal to sell 
tobacco products and nontobacco smoking products 
(e.g. herbal cigarettes) to minors in NSW, and prohibits 
the sale of cigarettes ‘per stick’ or in packs containing 
fewer than 20 cigarettes. The Act also includes a range of 
point-of-sale provisions that cover restrictions on tobacco 
advertising, promotion, packaging and point-of-sale 
display. Cigarette vending machines are only allowed in 
licensed venues restricted to those older than 18 years, 
and purchases can only be made when activated by 
venue staff or when a token is purchased from venue staff. 
Sales to minors and point-of-sale provisions are 
enforced by NSW Health inspectors, who conduct 
random and complaints-based inspections of 
tobacco retailers to monitor compliance with the law. 
Noncompliant retailers face substantial fines. For 
example, the Act imposes penalties of up to $11 000 
for individuals selling a tobacco product to a minor, 
and $55 000 for corporations, with higher penalties for 
repeated breaches. Similar laws exist in other Australian 
states and territories.
Emerging priorities
This paper provides an update on the status of smoking 
by adolescents in Australia and NSW, particularly on 
the policies and programs aligned with the WHO FCTC 
that are influencing reductions in smoking. Significant 
progress has been made, but further action is required 
to achieve continued declines in smoking by Australian 
adolescents by preventing uptake and aiding quitting. 
Constant vigilance is needed to address new and 
innovative tobacco marketing strategies. Proven effective 
strategies will require continued investment, as outlined 
in the WHO FCTC. This includes further increases 
in tobacco excise, and the delivery of tailored and 
integrated marketing communication strategies for anti-
tobacco campaigns that motivate and support quitting 
across all media platforms. Lastly, the ongoing monitoring 
and enforcement of tobacco legislation by states and 
territories will continue to be critical.
