C
ontinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology provides real-time glucose concentration data to people with diabetes. The data 
enable timely treatment decisions that can lead to avoidance or mitigation of hypoglycaemia, with potential cost savings. This 
commentary discusses CGM implementation and funding policies in the UK, and regional disparities that confront many people with 
diabetes who could benefit from the technology.

People with type 1 diabetes are at risk of diabetes-specific microvascular complications of 
retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and face an increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
compared with the general population.1 These risks can be modified by optimising glucose self-
management,2 commonly measured by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and achieved through 
appropriate selection of insulin preparation,3 structured education programmes,4 insulin pump 
therapy,5 capillary blood glucose monitoring, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).  
CGM devices display contemporaneous glucose concentration, glucose direction and rate of 
change, and a graphical representation of the preceding glucose trend. They also provide alerts 
and alarms for glucose values outside of defined thresholds, and for rapid rates of change. 
Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that, compared with intermittent self-monitoring, 
CGM improves HbA1c, reduces time spent in hypo- and hyperglycaemia, improves fear of 
hypoglycaemia and quality of life, and lowers the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.6–10
With the publication, in 2015, of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
guidelines for type 1 diabetes,11,12 CGM was advocated as a therapeutic option for children and 
adults living with type 1 diabetes in England (Table 1). The NICE guidance for children supports 
offering CGM to children with frequent severe hypoglycaemia, to those with impaired awareness 
of hypoglycaemia associated with adverse consequences (such as seizures or anxiety), or where 
there is inability to recognise, or communicate about, symptoms of hypoglycaemia due to cognitive 
or neurological disabilities. In addition, CGM should be considered in neonates, infants and pre-
school children with type 1 diabetes, in children and young people who undertake high levels of 
physical activity (for example, sport at a regional, national or international level), and in children 
and young people who have comorbidities (for example anorexia nervosa) or who are receiving 
treatments (such as corticosteroids) that can make blood glucose control difficult.
The adult guideline supports consideration of CGM for adults with type 1 diabetes who meet one 
or more of the following criteria: more than one episode a year of severe hypoglycaemia with no 
obvious preventable precipitating cause; complete loss of awareness of hypoglycaemia; frequent 
(more than 2 episodes a week) asymptomatic hypoglycaemia that is causing problems with daily 
activities; extreme fear of hypoglycaemia; hyperglycaemia (HbA1c level of 75 mmol/mol [9%] or 
higher) that persists despite self-monitoring of capillary blood at least 10 times a day.11 Adults 
accessing CGM should commit to using the system for at least 70% of the time and it must be 
provided by a centre with expertise in its use, as part of strategies to optimise HbA1c and reduce 
the frequency of hypoglycaemia. The NICE guidelines are stricter than those in other territories 
and may prevent some groups from accessing CGM, such as those with impaired awareness 
of hypoglycaemia and a Gold score between 4 and 6. In order to change this in future guidance, 
further evidence may be required.

For both adults and children, the use of CGM is an adjunct to education 
and support, and randomised clinical trials support CGM use independent 
of the insulin delivery modality (pump or multiple dose injection).7,9,13 
Importantly, NICE guidelines advocate an overall HbA1c target of 
 
48 mmol/mol (6.5%), supporting people with type 1 diabetes to achieve 
near normoglycaemia without disabling or problematic hypoglycaemia. 
The recommendations in the guidelines all support this overarching 
target, including implementation of CGM to optimise glucose.
The conditions of access in the adult guideline reflect the evidence 
assessed by the panel at the time. Benefit accrues from the use of CGM 
in a dose-dependent fashion, and a minimum of 6 days out of 7 use-
per-week was the threshold for benefit in young adults in the landmark 
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) study.8 The guidance 
also reflects the outcome of an economic analysis published alongside 
the NICE guidance which assessed the net monetary benefit of CGM 
compared with capillary blood glucose testing 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 times per 
day. From these data, the required HbA1c improvement for CGM, and the 
threshold where self-monitoring may be considered to have failed, were 
set.11 Since publication of the guidance, additional data from randomised, 
controlled trials has been published, confirming the benefits of CGM for 
people with type 1 diabetes using multiple dose injection regimens, both 
in reducing HbA1c by a clinically significant margin, and in addressing 
time spent below hypoglycaemic thresholds.7,9 Data suggest CGM is now 
sufficiently accurate to replace capillary blood glucose testing in most 
scenarios,14 but there remains a legal requirement in the United Kingdom 
to assess blood glucose (not interstitial fluid) prior to driving.
Despite the support for CGM in the adult and paediatric guidance, 
routine implementation into treatment pathways has not been achieved, 
reflecting, in part, challenges with provider arrangements. Across 
England there are around 200 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), to 
whom local provision of care is devolved. The National Health Service 
(NHS) England, the executive public body of the Department of Health 
which oversees the budget, planning, delivery and operation of the 
NHS, state that CCGs must be mindful of NICE guidance but guidance 
documents are not mandated and local adoption, interpretation, and 
implementation is possible. This situation allows for geographical 
variation in the availability of some technologies. This contrasts with NICE 
technology appraisal documents which are mandated by law, and which 
support insulin pump use in England.
Some areas of England have successfully adopted the NICE guidance 
including North West London, where a group of eight CCGs, covering 
a population of around 2 million people, has implemented access 
to CGM for adults with type 1 diabetes who meet the NICE criteria. 
This co-ordinated implementation arose from collaboration between 
specialists, commissioners, and primary care, and supports people with 
challenging glycaemia to access appropriate technologies, enabling 
effective self-management of type 1 diabetes. Following a stakeholder 
meeting between commissioners, specialists, primary care physicians 
and business managers, a business case was prepared that included 
an evidence review, and defined access criteria, duration of use 
and monitoring processes. The business case included emergency 
response data for hypoglycaemia in North West London, provided by the 
London Ambulance Service. The final business case was presented to 
the Collaboration Board of CCGs where it was approved, along with a 
short application form for initial funding and a renewal form including 
monitoring data to be completed at 6 month intervals.
However, equity of access to CGM remains a challenge across the 
NHS and the use of individual funding requests, designed for access

daily injection insulin regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII 
or insulin pump) therapy
Consider ongoing real-time continuous glucose monitoring for children and young 
people who have comorbidities (for example anorexia nervosa) or who are receiving

to therapies only in exceptional circumstances, remains common for 
CGM. Conservatively, 25% of people with type 1 diabetes have impaired 
awareness of hypoglycaemia and the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia 
is around 0.5 episodes per patient year,15–17 suggesting that the NICE 
criteria are not exceptional and many people with type 1 diabetes would 
meet these requirements if broadly applied. In 2011, the estimated 
cost of a single episode of severe hypoglycaemia requiring healthcare 
professional support is £377–1,306, suggesting significant potential 
for cost savings for people at highest risk of severe hypoglycaemia.18 
Furthermore, only 29.2% of people with type 1 diabetes in England 
and Wales achieve an HbA1c below 58 mmol/mol (7.5%)19 and access 
to a wider array of intensification strategies including CGM is likely to 
increase this number over time.
The National Insulin Pump Audit has collected data across the NHS 
for insulin pump usage, and will continue annually to assess this, 
enabling longitudinal benchmarking.20 This audit will now include the 
use of CGM technologies, allowing year-on-year assessment of uptake 
 
of CGM in the NHS. The presented data in this survey paper assess the 
state of CGM in the UK in 2017, including the views of people using it 
and adoption outside of the NHS; data that have not previously been 
reported. While this survey should not be considered comprehensive 
it offers some insight into the use of CGM and the benefits as reported 
by patients. 
Adoption of new technologies into a resource-limited public health 
system is challenging and requires evidence for clinical, and cost, 
effectiveness. CGM is not unique but the evidence-base moves rapidly 
in line with product cycles, and it is important that guidelines and 
access criteria are able to move in parallel with this, to ensure people 
with type 1 diabetes are able to access interventions that are clinically 
relevant, and offer potential long-term cost savings. CGM can be rapidly 
adopted by people with diabetes and benefit can be measured over a 
short period of time, often with existing resources. It is clear that use 
of CGM, at present, extends beyond NHS provision, and that those 
people who are self-funding technologies, perceive benefit. The survey 
data support development of more flexible guidance that is able to take 
this into account, and which ensures safe implementation of CGM with 
demonstration of clinically meaningful outcomes, including psychosocial 
wellbeing and quality of life.
