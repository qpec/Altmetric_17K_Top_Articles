Memory CD8+ T cells confer long-term immunity against tumors,
and anticancer vaccines therefore should maximize their generation.
Multiple memory CD8+ T-cell subsets with distinct functional and
homing characteristics exist, but the signaling pathways that regu-
late their development are ill defined. Here we examined the role of
the serine/threonine kinase Akt in the generation of protective im-
munity by CD8+ T cells. Akt is known to be activated by the T-cell
antigen receptor and the cytokine IL-2, but its role in T-cell immunity
in vivo has not been explored. Using CD8+ T cells from pdk1K465E/K465E
knockin mice, we found that decreased Akt activity inhibited the
survival of T cells during the effector-to-memory cell transition and
abolished their differentiation into C-X-C chemokine receptor 3
(CXCR3)loCD43lo effector-like memory cells. Consequently, antitumor
immunity by CD8+ T cells that display defective Akt signaling was
substantially diminished during the memory phase. Reduced memory
T-cell survival and altered memory cell differentiation were associated
with up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein Bim and the T-box
transcription factor eomesodermin, respectively. These findings sug-
gest an important role for effector-like memory CD8+ T cells in tumor
immune surveillance and identify Akt as a key signaling node in the
development of protective memory CD8+ T-cell responses.

n a typical immune response to an acute infection, naive CD8+
T cells expand and differentiate into effector cells that target
infected cells for destruction. Following elimination of the
pathogen, the majority (90–95%) of effector cells die by apo-
ptosis, and the remaining cells mature into memory cells. The
mechanisms that regulate memory CD8+ T-cell generation are
not fully defined. However, several lines of evidence indicate
that increasing the intensity of inflammation skews differentia-
tion toward short-lived effector cells (SLECs) at the expense of
memory precursor effector cells (MPECs) (1–4). The memory
CD8+ T-cell pool consists of populations of cells that vary in a
number of characteristics, including tissue trafficking, effector
function, and recall responses. Initially two memory cell subsets
were identified based on the expression of CD62L (L-selectin)
and C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) (5–7). Thus, central
memory T cells (TCM), which express CD62L and CCR7, localize
preferentially to lymph nodes (LNs) and exhibit strong recall
responses as well as robust IL-2 production. In contrast, effector
memory T cells (TEM), which lack CD62L and CCR7, traffic
preferentially to nonlymphoid tissues, possess heightened cyto-
toxicity toward target cells, and display a limited proliferative
recall capacity (5–7). More recently, Hikono et al. (8) identified
distinct memory CD8+ T-cell subsets based on the expression of
C-X-C chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), CD27, and an activa-
tion-associated glycoform of CD43. These markers further divide
circulating TCM and TEM cells into subsets that differ in homeostatic
proliferation, persistence, granzyme B expression, production of IL-
2, and recall responses. CD27hiCXCR3hiCD43lo memory CD8+ T
cells persist longer and generate better recall responses than
CD27loCXCR3loCD43lo memory cells, but the latter subset
confers the most efficient protective immunity against infection
with Listeria monocytogenes or vaccinia virus (9).
The signaling pathways that regulate the development of
memory T-cell subsets are not well understood, but knowledge of
these pathways is important for the development of more effi-
cacious vaccines against tumors and intracellular pathogens. In
the current report we have focused on the serine/threonine
protein kinase Akt. Akt regulates nutrient uptake and cellular
metabolism in many cell types but appears to be dispensable for
these processes in mature CD8+ T cells (10). Akt regulates the
T-cell receptor (TCR) and IL-2 transcriptional programs that
control the expression of cytolytic molecules, adhesion receptors,
and cytokine and chemokine receptors that distinguish effector
cells from naive and memory cells (11, 12). It therefore has been
suggested that Akt activity promotes the differentiation of naive
CD8+ T cells into cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) at the expense of
memory cells (11, 12). However, this view is based on findings
derived from in vitro studies, and therefore the true impact of
physiological Akt activation on CD8+ T responses in vivo re-
mains unknown. A critical step for Akt activation is the phos-
phorylation of Thr308 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
(PDK1). This event is mediated by the tethering of Akt and PDK1
to the plasma membrane via their pleckstrin homology (PH) do-
mains (13). The PH domains of Akt and PDK1 bind to the lipid
second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3),
the product of the class I PI3Ks. Hence, knockin mice that express
a mutant form of PDK1 (PDK1-K465E) that cannot bind to PIP3
have strongly reduced Akt activation, but other PDK1 targets
remain unaffected (13, 14). Because low levels of Akt activity
remain in PDK1-K465E mice, thymic development of T cells,
Significance
Immunotherapy has emerged as an important modality for the
treatment of cancer, and T-cell vaccination provides an op-
portunity to generate a long-lasting anticancer response. Crit-
ical to this response is the generation of memory CD8+ T cells,
but the signaling pathways that regulate their development
are incompletely defined. In the current report we focused
on the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt. Although Akt is
known to be activated by the T-cell antigen receptor and the
cytokine IL-2, its role in T-cell immunity remains unknown. In
this study we show that Akt signaling profoundly impacts
memory T-cell development and the antitumor response dur-
ing the memory phase. Optimizing Akt activity therefore
should maximize the therapeutic effect of anticancer vaccines.

 which is absent in Akt knockout mice (15), proceeds normally
(14). Thus, PDK1-K465E knockin mice provide a powerful model
for investigating the role of Akt signaling in mature T cells. Using
CD8+ T cells from PDK1-K465E knockin mice we now show that,
contrary to the currently held view, Akt signaling is critical for the
development of CD8+ memory T cells.
Results
Reduced Akt Signaling Does Not Impede the Generation of Primary
Effectors. Analysis of TCR-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at
Thr308 in PDK1-K465E and PDK1-WT CTLs confirmed the re-
duced ability of PDK1-K465E OT-I cells to activate Akt (Fig. S1A).
In addition, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
activity, as assessed by the levels of phospho-S6 at Ser235/236, was
still detectable in PDK1-K465E CTLs (Fig. S1B), consistent with
previous findings demonstrating that mTORC1 activation in
CD8+ T cells can be induced independently of Akt activation
(16). Next we investigated the effect of reduced Akt signaling on
the CD8+ T-cell response following vaccination with ovalbumin
(OVA) protein coadministered with agonist anti-CD40 mAb and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This vaccination approach induces
robust expansion of cytotoxic effectors and long-lived lymphoid
and mucosal memory CD8+ T cells (17, 18). We adoptively
transferred a small number of PDK1-K465E or PDK1-WT OT-I
cells, which bear a TCR specific for the OVA257–264/H-2Kb
complex, into C57BL/6 mice before vaccination. At the peak of
the response similar numbers of PDK1-WT and PDK1-K465E
donor OT-I cells were recovered from the spleen, LNs, and
blood, indicating that maximal Akt activation is not required for
the expansion of CD8+ T cells in vivo (Fig. 1A). The impact of
reduced Akt activity on OT-I T-cell effector function was also
minimal, with a small but reproducible decrease in the proportion of
granzyme B+ cells in the PDK1-K465E OT-I population compared
with PDK1-WT effectors (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, frequencies of
IFN-γ– and TNF-α–producing cells were similar in PDK1-WT and
PDK1-K465E OT-I effectors, whereas the proportion of cells that
produced IL-2 was marginally higher in PDK1-K465E effectors
(Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C). Moreover, cytokine production on a per-
cell basis was indistinguishable between the two cell types
(Fig. S1D). Similar results were obtained when the anti-CD40/LPS
adjuvant was replaced with agonist anti–4-1BB mAb/LPS or poly-
inosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) (Fig. S1 E–H). Finally, to de-
termine the broader impact of the PDK1-K465E mutation on
effector function and protective immunity in vivo, we compared the
ability of PDK1-WT and PDK1-K465E OT-I T cells to control the
growth of OVA-expressing E.G7 tumor cells. Four days after E.G7
inoculation, mice received either naive PDK1-WT or PDK1-
K465E OT-I T cells followed by OVA/anti-CD40/LPS. As shown
in Fig. 1D, PDK1-K465E and PDK1-WT OT-I cells were equally
effective in controlling tumor growth. Thus our data collectively
demonstrate that the development of primary effectors follow-
ing protein vaccination is largely insensitive to suboptimal
Akt activity.
Generation of Memory CD8+ T Cells Following Protein Vaccination
Requires Akt Signaling. To assess the impact of reduced Akt sig-
naling on the memory CD8+ T-cell response, we monitored the
contraction of OT-I T cells in blood following vaccination with
OVA/anti-CD40/LPS. As shown in Fig. 2A, PDK1-K465E OT-I
cells displayed an accelerated contraction phase compared with
Fig. 1.
Reduced Akt signaling does not impede the generation of primary effectors. Following adoptive transfer of CD45.1 PDK1-WT or PDK1-K465E OT-I
cells, congenic recipient mice were vaccinated with OVA/anti-CD40 mAb/LPS. Spleens, inguinal LNs, and blood samples were harvested 6 d later. (A) Numbers

 PDK1-WT cells. Furthermore, when equal numbers of PDK1-WT
and PDK1-K465E OT-I cells were cotransferred into congenic
mice, PDK1-WT cells did not rescue the rapid contraction of
PDK1-K465E cells, demonstrating a cell-intrinsic defect in the
ability of PDK1-K465E cells to transition from the effector to the
memory stage (Fig. 2B). Despite reaching similar frequencies at
the peak of the primary response, fewer PDK1-K465E OT-I T
cells were recovered at the resting memory phase in both lym-
phoid and nonlymphoid tissues (Fig. 2C). To discriminate between
tissue-localized and vasculature-associated memory CD8+ T cells,
we performed i.v. antibody labeling as described by Anderson
et al. (19). The majority of CD45.1+CD8+ T cells recovered from
the lungs and liver were not protected from i.v. anti-CD8α mAb
(Fig. S2A). In contrast, almost all CD45.1+CD8+ T cells isolated
from the intestine were protected from i.v. antibody labeling
(Fig. S2A). These experiments revealed that reduced Akt signaling
had the greatest effect on vasculature-associated memory CD8+ T
cells in the lungs and liver (Fig. S2B). Importantly, the reduction in
the frequency of i.v. mAb-protected PDK1-K465E OT-I memory
cells in the intestine demonstrated that Akt signaling is required for
optimal accumulation of memory cells in the intestine parenchyma
following vaccination with OVA/anti-CD40/LPS (Fig. S2B).
We next determined whether reduced Akt signaling selectively
impairs the development of a particular subset of memory cells.
This analysis was conducted 6–7 wk after immunization when
PDK1-K465E OT-I cells were still readily detectable. Initially we
analyzed the expression of CD62L, a marker classically used to
discriminate TCM from TEM (5, 6). The frequency of CD62Lhi
cells was higher among PDK1-K465E OT-I cells in both the
spleen and LNs, suggesting that Akt activity normally restrains
the generation of TCM (Fig. S2C). However, CD62L is tran-
scriptionally induced by Forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1),
which is inactivated by Akt phosphorylation (14, 20, 21). Thus,
the increased expression of CD62L on PDK1-K465E memory
cells may not truly reflect their differentiation state. We there-
fore used a complementary strategy based on the expression of
CXCR3 and an activation-associated glycoform of CD43 to de-
lineate the various memory T-cell subsets (8, 9). In the memory
phase, PDK1-WT OT-I cells gave rise to subsets that conformed
to previously defined phenotypic features obtained in disparate
models, with CXCR3loCD43lo cells displaying the lowest amount
of CD62L and the highest levels of killer cell lectin-like receptor
G1 (KLRG1) and granzyme B (Fig. S2D). As depicted in Fig.
2D, the frequency of CXCR3loCD43lo cells was highest in non-
lymphoid organs such as liver and lungs and was lowest in LNs.
Intravascular staining showed that the CXCR3lo memory cells
recovered from the lungs and liver are associated with the vas-
culature, whereas CXCR3lo memory cells recovered from the
intestine are protected from i.v. anti-CD8α mAb and therefore
localized in the parenchyma (Fig. S2E). Importantly, the per-
centage of CXCR3loCD43lo cells was noticeably reduced in the
PDK1-K465E OT-I population, and this diminution was associ-
ated with a reciprocal increase in the frequency of CXCR3hiCD43lo
cells (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that the generation of CXCR3lo

 CD43lo effector-like memory cells is particularly sensitive to the
reduction in Akt signaling.
To address how the diminution in resting memory cells influenced
the recall response, mice were rechallenged with OVA257–264. The
magnitude of the secondary response was significantly reduced when
memory T cells were derived from PDK1-K465E OT-I T cells (Fig.
3A). Additionally, PDK1-K465E secondary effectors expressed less
granzyme B than with PDK1-WT cells (Fig. 3B and Fig. S3A). In the
few mice that had detectable memory PDK1-K465E cells the fold-
expansion of PDK1-K465E memory cells was similar to that of
PDK1-WT cells, indicating that decreased Akt activity affected
memory cell generation rather than the cell’s capacity to mount a
secondary proliferative response (Fig. S3B). To assess if the re-
duced recall response impacted immune protection, we inoculated
mice with E.G7 tumor cells 3 d after secondary immunization. As
shown in Fig. 3C, mice that possessed memory PDK1-WT OT-I
cells were better protected than those that had PDK1-K465E
OT-I memory T cells. Finally, we showed that reduced Akt sig-
naling abolished memory CD8+ T-cell formation in two additional
protein vaccines that encompass alternative adjuvants (Fig. S3 C
and D). These results demonstrate that Akt signaling is required
for the effector-to-memory cell transition after protein/adjuvant
vaccination.
Vaccine-Induced PDK1-K465E OT-I Effectors Express Increased Levels
of the Proapoptotic Protein Bim. To probe the mechanism un-
derpinning the diminished ability of PDK1-K465E OT-I effector
cells to transition into the memory phase, we first assessed if
reduced Akt activity affected the ratio of SLECs to MPECs as
defined by differential expression of CD127 and KLRG1 (1).
The frequency of CD127hiKLRG1lo cells, defined by this crite-
rion as MPECs, was higher among PDK1-K465E effectors (Fig.
4 A and B). However, the use of CD127 to demarcate MPECs in
this case is complicated by the fact that Il7ra is a target of Foxo1,
a transcription factor inactivated by Akt (20–22). Therefore, the
frequency of PDK1-K465E MPECs as identified by CD127 ex-
pression may be artificially inflated. This possibility is supported
by the observation that PDK1-K465E effectors exhibited higher
expression of CD127 on both KLRG1hi and KLRG1lo cells than
did PDK1-WT effectors (Fig. S4).
Because Bim-deficient effector CD8+ T cell are largely resistant
to apoptosis during the contraction phase (23), we hypothesized
that increased Bim protein in PDK1-K465E OT-I effectors ac-
celerates cell death and limits the generation of memory cells.
Comparing the amount of Bim protein in PDK1-WT and PDK1-
K465E OT-I effectors isolated 7 d postvaccination revealed a
twofold increase in its expression in PDK1-K465E OT-I cells (Fig.
4C). Thus, our findings support the notion that physiological Akt
activity in effector T cells exerts prosurvival effects by limiting the
expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim.
The Role of Akt Signaling in CD8+ T-Cell Differentiation After Infection
with L. monocytogenes. To understand the role of Akt signaling in
effector CD8+ T-cell differentiation in a more inflammatory setting,
we compared the responses of adoptively transferred PDK1-WT
and PDK1-K465E OT-I cells following infection with OVA-
expressing L. monocytogenes (Lm-OVA). On day 6 postinfection,
the frequency of PDK1-K465E OT-I effectors in the spleen and
blood was lower than that of PDK1-WT cells (Fig. 5A). This de-
crease was not the result of reduced proliferation of PDK1-K465E
OT-I cells, because the frequency of Ki67+ cells in spleen was
comparable in PDK1-WT and PDK1-K465E effectors (Fig. S5A),
but instead was caused by preferential localization of PDK1-K465E
OT-I cells in LNs (Fig. 5 A and B). CD62L expression was higher
on PDK1-K465E OT-I cells (Fig. 5C) and likely contributed to
redirecting their trafficking to LNs. Because reduced Akt activity
results in high CD127 expression on both KLRG1hi and KLRG1lo
cells (Fig. S5 B and C), we used KLRG1 expression alone to
identify the various effector cell subsets. Disparate levels of KLRG1
subdivide the effector cell population into subsets that are enriched
in either terminal effectors or precursors of TCM (24). As expected,
the frequency of KLRG1hi cells generated after Lm-OVA infection
(Fig. 5D and Fig. S5 B and D) was greater than following protein
vaccination (Fig. 4A) (25). The proportion of KLRG1hi cells was
lower in the PDK1-K465E OT-I population in the spleen (Fig. 5D)
and blood (Fig. S5 B and D), leading to a twofold reduction in the
numbers of PDK1-K465E KLRG1hi cells compared with PDK1-
WT KLRG1hi cells (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, although an increase in
the proportion of CD127hi cells among PDK1-K465E OT-I effec-
tors was evident in the spleen, the numbers of PDK1-K465E and
PDK-WT CD127hi T cells were similar (Fig. 5E).
Next we assessed the effect of reduced Akt signaling on effector
function. Consistent with our findings in the protein vaccination
setting, PDK1-K465E OT-I exhibited only a modest reduction in
granzyme B expression compared with PDK1-WT effectors (Fig.
S5E). Mobilization of the degranulation marker CD107a at the
cell surface and IFN-γ and TNF-α production were equivalent
in PDK1-WT and PDK1-K465E cells (Fig. S5 F–I). Although
MPECs and SLECs exhibit equivalent cytotoxicity and a similar
capacity to produce TNF-α and IFN-γ, MPECs produce more
IL-2 than SLECs (1, 24). We found that the proportion of IL-2–
producing cells was significantly higher among PDK1-K465E ef-
fectors, but IL-2 production on a per-cell basis was equivalent
(Fig. 5F and Fig. S5 H and I), indicating that PDK1-K465E CD8+
T effectors were enriched in MPECs.
The T-box transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes)
regulate the differentiation of CD8+ T cells into effector and
memory cells (4). T-bet expression is required for the generation of
KLRG1hi cells (1), and Eomes promotes the generation and per-
sistence of TCM (26). Examination of the expression of T-bet and
Eomes revealed that PDK1-K465E OT-I effectors express similar
levels of T-bet but higher levels of Eomes as compared with PDK1-
WT cells, suggesting that PDK1-K465E effectors have a superior
potential to give rise to TCM (Fig. 5 G and H).
The Role of Akt Signaling in the Generation of Memory Responses
After Infection with L. monocytogenes. To assess the impact of
reduced Akt activity on the persistence of CD8+ T cells following
infection, we first monitored the frequency of adoptively trans-
ferred PDK1-WT and PDK1-K465E OT-I cells in blood. In
contrast to our observations following protein vaccination, the
frequency of total memory PDK1-K465E OT-I cells generated
by infection was similar to that of PDK1-WT OT-I cells (Fig.
6A). However, when the expression of KLRG1 was taken into
account, we noticed a striking reduction in the generation and
persistence of KLRG1hi effector and memory CD8+ T cells in
blood, whereas the accumulation of KLRG1lo cells was mini-
mally affected by the diminished Akt activity (Fig. 6B). Assess-
ment of the ratios of PDK1-WT to PDK1-K465E memory cells
in different organs revealed similar numbers of PDK1-WT and
PDK1-K465E cells in the spleen, preferential localization of
PDK1-K465E OT-I cells in the LNs, and decreased accumula-
tion of PDK1-K465E cells in the liver and lungs (Fig. S6A).
Furthermore, using CXCR3 and CD43 as markers that denote
functionally distinct memory cell subsets, we found marked dif-
ferences in the composition of PDK1-K465E and PDK1-WT
OT-I memory cells. A significant reduction in the proportion of
CXCR3loCD43lo cells was noted in the PDK1-K465E memory
pool and was accompanied by a reciprocal increase in the pro-
portion of the CXCR3hi cells, in particular the CXCR3hiCD43lo
subset (Fig. 6C). As a result, we observed a significant decrease
in the absolute numbers of PDK1-K465E CXCR3loCD43lo ef-
fector-like memory cells in the spleen, liver, and lungs and an
increase in the numbers of PDK1-K465E CXCR3hiCD43lo cells,
and to a lesser extent of PDK1-K465E CXCR3hiCD43hi cells in
spleen and LNs (Fig. 6D). Accordingly, lower numbers of PDK1-

 K465E cells expressing KLRG1, which is expressed predominantly
on CXCR3loCD43lo memory cells (Fig. S2D and refs. 8 and 9),
were recovered from the spleen, liver, and lungs (Fig. S6B).
Similar to our observations for memory cells generated by protein
vaccination, CXCR3loCD43loKLRG1hi memory cells recovered
from the lungs and liver were largely unprotected from i.v. anti-
body labeling, suggesting that these cells were associated with the
vasculature of these organs (Fig. S7). When restimulated ex vivo,
PDK1-K465E memory cells and PDK1-WT cells were equally
capable of producing IFN-γ and TNF-α, but PDK1-K465E
cells comprised a larger proportion of IL-2–producing cells
(Fig. 6E and Fig. S8 A and B), consistent with the altered com-
position of the PDK1-K465E memory population, which is skewed
toward the CXCR3hi subset (8). Furthermore, the remaining
PDK1-K465E CXCR3loCD43lo memory cells expressed substantially
less granzyme B than PDK1-WT cells (Fig. 7A and Fig. S8C). To
determine whether the loss of CXCR3loCD43lo cells from the
memory population of PDK1-K465E T cells impacts the killing ca-
pacity of memory cells, we compared PDK1-WT and PDK1-K465E
memory T cells in an ex vivo cytotoxicity assay. PDK1-WT cells were
more efficient than PDK1-K465E cells on a per-cell basis in
killing OVA peptide-pulsed target cells (Fig. S8D), suggesting
that PDK1-WT memory cells are potentially better in conferring
protective immunity in vivo.
To assess the impact of the altered memory pool on protective
immunity in vivo, we injected E.G7 tumor cells into mice that
had been previously challenged with Lm-OVA. Delayed tumor
growth was observed in mice harboring either PDK1-WT or
PDK1-K465E OT-I memory cells as compared with naive mice
(Fig. 7B). However, the tumor protection provided by PDK1-WT
memory cells was markedly more sustained. As a result, mice

 bearing PDK1-WT cells survived significantly longer than mice
bearing PDK1-K465E cells (Fig. 7C). These results highlight the
importance of optimal Akt signaling in the generation of protective
memory CD8+ T cells. We next assessed the frequency and phe-
notype of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (TILs). The frequencies
of PDK1-WT and PDK1-K465E T cells among tumor-infiltrating
CD8+ T cells were similar (Fig. S9A). Unexpectedly, CXCR3 was
down-regulated on TILs as compared with splenic CD8+ T cells
(Fig. S9B), thus preventing its use as a marker to delineate the
memory CD8+ T-cell subsets. However, chemokine (C-X3-C motif)
receptor 1 (CX3CR1), recently shown to be expressed on effector-
like memory CD8+ T cells (27) and confirmed by us (Fig. S9C), was
expressed on a subpopulation of TILs (Fig. S9D). Importantly, we
show that the frequency of CX3CR1+ cells was reduced among
PDK1-K465E TILs compared with PDK1-WT TILs, suggesting
that the optimal accumulation of tumor-associated effector-like
memory cells is dependent on Akt activity (Fig. S9 D and E).
Discussion
In the present study we explored how PIP3-dependent activation
of Akt impacts the CD8+ T-cell response elicited by vaccination
or infection. The overarching conclusion from the current study
is that CD8+ T-cell expansion and acquisition of effector func-
tion during the primary response are relatively insensitive to
suboptimal Akt activity, whereas multiple aspects of protective
memory cell development are highly dependent on Akt signaling.
The current study demonstrates that maximal Akt signaling is
neither required for CD8+ T-cell expansion nor necessary for the
generation of CTLs during the primary response. Although pri-
mary PDK1-K465E OT-I effector T cells express marginally
lower levels of granzyme B than PDK1-WT cells, they produce
similar levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Importantly, we show that
maximal Akt activity is not required for the antitumor response
during the primary effector phase, because PDK1-K465E OT-I
and PDK1-WT OT-I effector cells provide equivalent protection
against E.G7 tumors. Although we cannot exclude the possibility

 that the residual Akt activity in PDK1-K465E T cells was suffi-
cient for the generation of primary effectors, an alternative ex-
planation is that the primary T-cell response is controlled largely
by other signaling pathways. Notably, mTORC1 activity has been
shown to be necessary for optimal CD8+ T-cell expansion and
differentiation into effector cells (28). In this context, activation
of mTORC1 in CD8+ T cells is independent of Akt activity (Fig.
S1 A and B and ref. 16). By controlling the expression of hypoxia-
inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), mTORC1 enhances glucose metab-
olism and glycolysis and regulates the expression of perforin,
granzymes, CD62L, and CCR7 (16). Therefore, there is some
redundancy in the effects of Akt and mTORC1 signaling on the
regulation of cytotoxicity and tissue trafficking.
A striking finding of the current study is that Akt activity in
CD8+ T cells is required for cell survival during the transition
from the effector to the memory cell stage after protein vacci-
nation. Reduced Akt activity had profound effects on the overall
number of vaccine-generated memory cells so that the magni-
tude of the secondary response after rechallenge was signifi-
cantly diminished. The prosurvival role of Akt in CD8+ T cells
during the contraction phase is supported by our finding that the
levels of the proapoptotic Bcl2 family protein Bim are elevated
in PDK1-K465E effector T cells after protein vaccination. Bim is
known to promote the contraction phase of CD8+ effector
T cells (23), and its expression in T-cell lines is up-regulated by
Foxo3 (29). In this respect, recent studies have shown that de-
letion of Foxo3 in T cells results in an increase in T-cell survival
during either the primary response or the contraction phase
concomitant with reduced expression of Bim (30–32). Foxo3 is
phosphorylated by Akt, a posttranslational modification that re-
sults in Foxo3 nuclear exclusion and translocation to the cytosol
(29). Hence, the finding that PDK1-K465E effectors express ele-
vated levels of Bim is consistent with the notion that reduced Akt
signaling results in Foxo3-dependent up-regulation of Bim.

 By extending our analysis to an infection model, we found that
Akt signaling is primarily required for the differentiation of
CD8+ T cells into CXCR3loCD43loKLRG1hi effector-like
memory CD8+ T cells. The reduction in the number of effector-
like memory PDK1-K465E OT-I cells followed a decline in
KLRG1hi effectors, suggesting that the lack of Akt signaling had
an early impact on the generation of this population. In addition,
the frequency of IL-2–secreting cells among effector and memory
cells mirrored the phenotypic changes, consistent with previous
studies demonstrating that KLRGlhi effectors and effector-like
memory cells produce less IL-2 than KLRG1lo effectors and TCM
(1, 8, 24). Because the transcription factors T-bet and Eomes have
crucial roles in the generation of KLRG1hi effectors and TCM,
respectively (4), we assessed whether reduced Akt signaling im-
pacts their expression. T-bet expression within effectors was
not altered by the reduction in Akt signaling, suggesting that Akt
promotes the generation of KLRG1hi effectors and effector like-
memory T cells by an independent mechanism. In contrast, Eomes
expression was increased among PDK1-K465E OT-I effectors as
compared with its levels in PDK1-WT OT-I effectors. Previous
work has shown that CD8+ effector T cells that lack Eomes
generate fewer TCM (26). However, Eomes does not appear to
play a role in the generation of MPECs, because MPECs and
SLECs express similar amounts of Eomes, and Eomes deficiency
does not alter the SLEC/MPEC ratio (26). Thus, the higher ex-
pression of Eomes among PDK1-K465E OT-I effectors as com-
pared with PDK1-WT OT-I cells does not simply reflect the
greater frequency of MPECs but instead indicates that Akt sig-
naling actively suppresses Eomes expression. This finding suggests
that Akt signaling normally limits TCM generation and skews dif-
ferentiation toward effector-like memory T cells, at least in part
through down-regulation of Eomes. Eomes expression is depen-
dent on the transcription factor Foxo1, which is a known target for
Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation (20, 33). Thus, the
data presented here place Akt at the apex of the CD8+ T-cell
differentiation program that controls effector-like memory cells
and TCM.
Generation of protective, long-lasting CD8+ T-cell–dependent
immunity is an important goal for anticancer vaccines. Here we
show that Akt signaling is required for long-term protective an-
titumor immunity in two different settings. In the protein vac-
cination approach, the diminished antitumor protection was
primarily the result of the vastly reduced numbers of memory
PDK1-K465E OT-I cells. Reduction in secondary effector dif-
ferentiation, exemplified by lower granzyme B expression upon
peptide boosting, also may have contributed to the lack of an-
titumor activity of memory PDK1-K465E T cells. In the second
approach, T cells were primed with Lm-OVA. This setting
generated similar numbers of total PDK1-K465E and PDK1-WT
OT-I memory cells, but the PDK1-K465E memory population
was largely devoid of CXCR3loCD43lo effector-like memory
cells, and the remaining CXCR3loCD43lo cells expressed dimin-
ished amounts of granzyme B. Consequently when we compared
the cytotoxicity of PDK1-K465E and PDK1-WT OT-I memory
cells, we found that on a per-cell basis PDK1-K465E T cells were
less efficient in killing than PDK1-WT T cells. In addition, as-
sessment of their antitumor activity in vivo without further
boosting showed that memory PDK1-K465E T cells were less
effective in providing long-term protection than PDK1-WT
T cells. These findings indicate that Akt has an important
function in tumor immune surveillance by memory CD8+ T cells.
Recently, Crompton et al. (12) showed that pharmacological
inhibition of Akt during in vitro expansion of tumor-reactive
T cells results in enhanced persistence and antitumor activity
upon adoptive transfer and boosting. T-cell expansion protocols
for adoptive T-cell therapy typically use anti-CD3 antibody and
high-dose IL-2, conditions that promote sustained Akt signaling
and the terminal differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells at the
expense of TCM generation (14, 34). Under these conditions the
inhibition of Akt is expected to enhance the efficacy of adoptive
T-cell therapy by reducing the generation of terminally differ-
entiated effector cells (12). However, our findings suggest that
the physiological role of Akt in immune responses is to promote
the generation of effector-like memory cells, which, along with

 other memory subsets, ensure maximal protection of the host
against antigen reencounter.
The data presented in the current study also demonstrate that
the type of immune challenge dictates which facet of memory
cell development is affected by Akt signaling. Although differ-
entiation into effector-like memory T cells was similarly affected
in the protein vaccination and infection models, its prosurvival
effects during the contraction phase were confined to responses
elicited by protein vaccination. Interestingly, Bim was expressed
similarly in PDK1-K465E OT-I and PDK1-WT OT-I effectors in
the infection model (Fig. S10), in contrast with the results
obtained following protein vaccination (Fig. 4C). This divergence
may explain why primary PDK1-K465E OT-I effectors under-
went a more pronounced contraction than PDK1-WT OT-I
effectors after protein vaccination but not after infection.
Depending on the type of immune challenge, different mecha-
nisms of Foxo3 regulation that subsequently influence Bim ex-
pression could be operating. Thus, in addition to Akt, Erk and
IKK have been shown to inhibit Foxo3 activity, and various
pathways are known to counter Foxo3 inhibition (35). In addi-
tion, Bim is regulated by Foxo3-independent transcriptional,
posttranscriptional, and posttranslational mechanisms (36),
which could differ depending on the strength/duration of TCR
signaling, costimulation, and inflammation.
Finally, the effects of Akt signaling reported here are similar
to those ascribed to IL-2 in the generation of memory cell sub-
sets (2, 3), suggesting that Akt signaling is the primary mecha-
nism responsible for these effects. In summary, the present study
demonstrates a previously unappreciated role for Akt in the
generation of protective memory CD8+ T-cell responses, notably
against tumor recurrence. Optimizing Akt activity therefore
should maximize the therapeutic effect of anticancer vaccines.
Materials and Methods
Mice and in Vivo Experiments. All procedures were conducted in accordance
with UK Home Office guidelines and were approved by the University of
Southampton’s ethical committee. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles
River. OT-I transgenic mice carrying the K465E knockin mutation in the PH
domain of PDK1 (Pdpk1K465E) have been described previously (13, 14). Unless
otherwise specified, 104 CD45.1 or CD45.1/CD45.2 OT-I cells isolated from
spleen were transferred i.v. into CD45.2 C57BL/6 recipient mice. For co-
transfer experiments, 5 × 103 CD45.1 PDK1-WT OT-I cells were mixed with
5 × 103 CD45.1/CD45.2 PDK1-K465E OT-I cells and were transferred i.v. to
CD45.2 C57BL/6 mice. One day later, mice were challenged i.p. with 5 mg
OVA (Sigma) plus 100 μg anti-CD40 mAb (clone 3/23) (37) and 10 μg LPS
(Sigma) or OVA plus 200 μg anti–4-1BB mAb (clone Lob12.3) (38) and 10 μg
LPS or OVA plus 50 μg polyI:C (Sigma). Alternatively, mice were infected i.v.
with 106 cfu of ΔActA–Lm-OVA (from H. Shen, University of Pennsylvania
Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia). In some experiments, mice were
rechallenged with 30 nmol OVA257–264 peptide i.v. alone (in the case of OVA/
anti-CD40/LPS priming) or mixed with 100 μg anti-CD40 mAb (when using
OVA/anti-41BB/LPS and OVA/polyI:C for priming). Where indicated, mice
were injected s.c. with OVA-expressing E.G7 tumor cells (ATCC). Tumor
growth was monitored, and mice were killed when the humane end point
was reached (15-mm mean tumor diameter when taking the two greatest
perpendicular measurements).
Flow Cytometry. Antibodies and methods are listed in SI Materials and
Methods. Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled H-2Kb/SIINFEKL tetramer was prepared
in house. Samples were analyzed with a FACS Canto II and DIVA Software
(BD Biosciences) or FCS Express (De Novo Software).
Lymphocyte Isolation from Nonlymphoid Tissues. Colon lamina propria lym-
phocytes were isolated as described previously (39), except that 0.2 mg/mL
collagenase VIII was used for enzymatic digestion (Sigma). PBS-washed livers
were homogenized through a 100-μm cell strainer in PBS containing 0.5%
FCS and 2 mM EDTA. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in
40% Percoll solution (GE Healthcare) and layered on 70% Percoll solution.
Cells recovered at the interface were washed twice in PBS. The same pro-
tocol was applied to lungs, except they first were cut into small pieces.
Western Blotting. Detailed protocols of cell preparation are given in SI Ma-
terials and Methods. Cell lysates were prepared as previously described (16),
and proteins were separated using NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies)
and were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Blots
were probed with the antibodies listed in SI Materials and Methods. Den-
sitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ software.
Statistical Analysis. Where indicated, P values (*P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤
0.001) were determined by a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test using Prism
(GraphPad software), except for survival curves, in which a Mantel–Cox log-
rank test was used.
Additional materials and methods are available in SI Materials and Methods.
