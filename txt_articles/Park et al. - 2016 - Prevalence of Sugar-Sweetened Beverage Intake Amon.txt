 BRFSS is a state-based, random-digit–dialed telephone 
survey of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years, conducted annually by 
CDC and state health departments to monitor health condi-
tions and behaviors related to public health concerns.† BRFSS 
uses multistage, stratified sampling to select a representative 
sample of the noninstitutionalized adult population in each 
state, DC, and three U.S. territories (American Samoa, 
the Federated States of Micronesia, and Guam). In 2013, 
the median response rate across all states was 46.4% from

The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recom-
mend that the daily intake of calories from added sugars not 
exceed 10% of total calories.* Sugar-sweetened beverages 
(SSBs) are significant sources of added sugars in the diet of 
U.S. adults and account for approximately one third of added 
sugar consumption (1). Among adults, frequent (i.e., at least 
once a day) SSB intake is associated with adverse health conse-
quences, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular 
disease (2). According to the 2009–2010 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), an in-person and 
phone follow-up survey, 50.6% of U.S. adults consumed at least 
one SSB on a given day (3). In addition, SSB intake varies by 
geographical regions (4,5): the prevalence of daily SSB intake 
was higher among U.S. adults living in the Northeast (68.4%) 
and South (66.7%) than among persons living in the Midwest 
(58.8%). In 2013, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (BRFSS), a telephone survey, revised the SSB two-item 
optional module to retain the first question on regular soda and 
expand the second question to include more types of SSBs than 
just fruit drinks. Using 2013 BRFSS data, self-reported SSB (i.e., 
regular soda, fruit drinks, sweet tea, and sports or energy drinks) 
intake among adults (aged ≥18 years) was assessed in 23 states 
and the District of Columbia (DC). The overall age-adjusted 
prevalence of SSB intake ≥1 time per day was 30.1% and ranged 
from 18.0% in Vermont to 47.5% in Mississippi. Overall, at 
least once daily SSB intake was most prevalent among adults 
aged 18–24 years (43.3%), men (34.1%), non-Hispanic blacks 
(blacks) (39.9%), unemployed adults (34.4%), and persons 
with less than a high school education (42.4%). States can use 
the data for program evaluation and monitoring trends, and 
information on disparities in SSB consumption could be used to 
create targeted intervention efforts to reduce SSB consumption.

combined landline and cell phone data. Each year, BRFSS 
offers several optional modules to states on additional spe-
cific topics. In 2013, the BRFSS included an optional module 
with two SSB intake questions: 1) “During the past 30 days, 
how often did you drink regular soda or pop that contains 
sugar? Do not include diet soda or diet pop.” and 2) “During 
the past 30 days, how often did you drink sugar-sweetened 
fruit drinks (such as Kool-Aid and lemonade), sweet tea, and 
sports or energy drinks (such as Gatorade and Red Bull)? 
Do not include 100% fruit juice, diet drinks, or artificially 
sweetened drinks.” Respondents answered number of times 
per month, week, or day, and responses were converted to 
daily intake. To calculate daily SSB intake, daily intake fre-
quency from both questions was summed and categorized as 
none, >0 to <1 (coded as <1), and ≥1 time per day.§ During 
2013, 23 states and DC offered the SSB optional module, 
and 157,668 adults answered both SSB questions. Prevalence 
estimates are presented as percentages with 95% confidence 
intervals. Because age has been associated with SSB intake and 
age distribution varies by state, both crude and age-adjusted 
prevalences (standardization according to 2000 U.S. projected 
population) were provided for each state. Chi-square tests were 
used to examine whether state SSB intake varied by age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, employment status, or education (statistically 
significant at p<0.05). All analyses took complex survey design 
and sampling weight into account.
During 2013, after direct age adjustment, 30.1% of respon-
dents reported consuming SSBs at least once per day. At least 
once daily SSB intake was most common among persons aged 
18–24 years (43.3%), men (34.1%), blacks (39.9%), persons 
who reported being unemployed (34.4%), and persons with less 
than a high school education (42.4%). The lowest prevalences 
were reported by adults aged ≥55 years (19.1%), non-Hispanic 
persons of other races (21.2%), retired persons (18.0%), and 
college graduates (15.5%). By state, the age-adjusted prevalence 
of daily SSB intake was highest in Mississippi (47.5%), followed 
by Louisiana (45.5%), and West Virginia (45.2%) (Table 1). The 
prevalence of SSB intake of ≥2 times per day ranged from a low 
of 8.1% in Vermont to 27.3% in Mississippi (pooled mean for 
23 states and DC = 14.8%) (data not shown).
When examined by state of residence, SSB intake was most 
common among younger adults (aged 18–24 years) in most states 
and among men in all states. Overall, the prevalence of SSB intake 
≥1 time per day among the youngest group of adults (persons aged 
18–24 years) was 2.3 times the prevalence among the oldest age 
group (persons aged ≥55 years), ranging from 1.6-fold higher in 
New York to 3.4-fold higher in New Jersey. The overall prevalence 
among men was approximately 1.4 times the prevalence among 
women, ranging from 1.1 times higher in Mississippi to 2.0 times 
higher in Minnesota. Similarly, when prevalence of at least once 
daily SSB intake among blacks and Hispanics was compared 
with at least once daily intake prevalence among non-Hispanic 
whites (whites), the prevalence among blacks was 1.5 times the 
prevalence among whites (ranging from 0.9 in West Virginia to

in three adults reported consuming SSBs at least once daily in 
DC and the 23 states surveyed. Adults in Louisiana, Mississippi, 
and West Virginia reported the highest prevalence of at least once 
daily SSB intake. Daily SSB intake was most frequently reported 
among persons aged 18–24 years, men, blacks, adults who were 
not employed, and persons with less than a high school education.
The prevalence of daily SSB intake in this study was some-
what lower than that reported by the 2009–2010 NHANES 
data, which found that 50.6% of U.S. adults reported con-
suming at least one SSB on a given day (3). Potential reasons 
for this discrepancy might be accounted for by differences in 
modes of survey administration, methods of collecting dietary 
intake data, survey year, representativeness, and usual intake 
assessment. NHANES is an in-person and phone follow-up 
survey using 24-hour dietary recalls with USDA’s Automated 
Multiple-Pass Method that captures all forms of SSBs. In 
contrast, the BRFSS is a telephone survey using a short dietary 
screener about usual intake during the past 30 days.
As has been reported in other studies that used National 
Health Interview Survey and BRFSS (4,6) data, the prevalence 
of at least once daily SSB intake in this analysis was higher 
in southern states. Higher SSB intake frequency in certain 
states could result, in part, from variations in beverage retail 
4.9 in DC), and among Hispanics, was 1.4 times the prevalence 
among whites (ranging from 0.7 in Vermont to 2.2 in California). 
Overall, the prevalence of at least once daily SSB consumption 
among adults with less than a high school education was 2.7 times 
the prevalence among college graduates, ranging from 1.5 times 
higher in Mississippi to 5.4 times higher in DC.
The states with the highest prevalences of at least once daily 
consumption of SSBs among persons aged 18–24 years were 
Oklahoma (66.4%) and West Virginia (63.8%). The high-
est prevalences among men were in Louisiana (50.6%) and 
Mississippi (48.7%). At least once daily SSB intake was most 
prevalent among blacks in approximately half of states; states 
with the highest prevalence among blacks were Louisiana 
(50.7%) and Iowa (49.0%) (Table 2). Among persons who 
were unemployed, the highest prevalences of consuming SSBs 
≥1 time per day were reported in Mississippi (49.5%) and 
Louisiana (48.4%). The states with the highest prevalence 
among persons with less than a high school education were 
Louisiana (60.0%) and South Carolina (55.6%) (Table 3).
Discussion
The frequency of daily SSB intake remains high in some states 
and within certain populations. During 2013, approximately one

findings might not be generalizable to the entire U.S. adult 
population. Finally, SSB intake was measured in frequency 
rather than volume of consumption; therefore, estimating 
the amount of SSBs consumed or the caloric intake from 
SSBs was not possible.
The frequency of daily SSB intake is high among adults, 
especially among certain subpopulations, as well as persons 
living in southern states. SSBs can contribute to obesity, 
type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease related to excess 
intake of added sugars and calories from SSBs (2). SSB intake 
has been positively associated with markers of inflammation 
and insulin resistance, which might increase risk for cardio-
vascular disease and diabetes independently of obesity (2). 
Considering potential adverse health effects of SSB intake 
and the substantial contribution that SSBs make to excess 
dietary sugar, continuation of public health efforts aimed at 
decreasing high SSB intake is important. Actions can include 
education and awareness initiatives, increasing access to and 
promotion of healthier options through nutrition standards, 
environments, including access and availability, cultural norms 
(7,8), and advertising.¶  This study found higher prevalences 
of daily SSB intake among younger adults, men, blacks, and 
persons with lower levels of education, which is consistent with 
previous reports that used data from the 2009–2010 NHANES 
(3) and 2011 and 2012 BRFSS (6,9). Adults with less knowl-
edge about the adverse health consequences of SSB intake (5) 
might in part account for the higher reported consumption in 
some populations. Daily SSB intake was higher among young 
adults and unemployed adults but lower among older adults 
and retired adults in this analysis; previous studies based on 
NHANES and BRFSS data have found that older adults have 
lower SSB intake (3,6,9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, because BRFSS data are self-reported, 
they are subject to recall and social desirability bias, which 
might have underestimated or overestimated SSB intake. 
Second, only half of states elected to use the module; thus the

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are significant sources of 
added sugars among U.S. adults. SSB intake differs by geo-
graphical region and sociodemographic characteristics.
What is added by this report?
Data from the SSB intake module in the 2013 Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System provide the most recent state-spe-
cific data on consumption of SSBs. Among the 23 states 
surveyed and the District of Columbia, adult SSB intake was 
highest in Mississippi (47.5%), followed by Louisiana (45.5%) 
and West Virginia (45.2%). At least once daily SSB intake was 
most common among persons aged 18–24 years (43.3%), men 
(34.1%), non-Hispanic blacks (39.9%), persons who reported not 
being employed (34.4%), and persons with less than high 
school education (42.4%).
What are the implications for public health practices?
Because of the potential adverse health outcomes associated 
with SSB intake, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and 
cardiovascular disease, public health practitioners should 
continue efforts aimed at decreasing SSB intake among 
demographic groups with the highest reported consumption. 
Strategies can include education initiatives, increasing access to 
healthier options through nutrition standards, increasing 
availability of drinking water in schools and public venues, 
screening and counseling patients on SSB reduction, and facility 
food and beverage changes in clinic or hospital settings for 
employees, families, and patients.
