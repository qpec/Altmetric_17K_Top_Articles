In the study of variation in brain structure and function that might relate to sex
and gender, language matters because it frames our research questions and
methods. In this article, we offer an approach to thinking about variation in
brain structure and function that pulls us outside the sex differences formu-
lation. We argue that the existence of differences between the brains of
males and females does not unravel the relations between sex and the brain
nor is it sufficient to characterize a population of brains. Such characterization
is necessary for studying sex effects on the brain as well as for studying brain
structure and function in general. Animal studies show that sex interacts with
environmental, developmental and genetic factors to affect the brain. Studies
of humans further suggest that human brains are better described as belonging
to a single heterogeneous population rather than two distinct populations. We
discuss the implications of these observations for studies of brain and
behaviour in humans and in laboratory animals. We believe that studying
sex effects in context and developing or adopting analytical methods that
take into account the heterogeneity of the brain are crucial for the advancement
of human health and well-being.
1. Introduction
In the study of variation in brain structure and function that might relate to sex
and gender, language matters. It matters because the choice of words and
the meanings behind them frame our research questions and methods [1–4].
And it matters because inconsistent or imprecise use engenders confusion.
McCarthy & Konkle [4] made precisely these points in a carefully crafted article
in which they distinguished between sex dimorphism and sex difference. In
this opinion piece, they argued that we apply the term sexual dimorphism only
to those aspects of difference—for example, male and female genitalia or X
and Y chromosomes—that truly come (or nearly so [5]) in just two forms [4].
McCarthy & Konkle argued that scientists use care not to refer to male and
female brains as dimorphic when actually referring to sex difference, as in most
mammals sex-related brain differences consist of overlapping populations with
mean differences. Indeed, sexual dimorphism is extremely rare (if it exists at
all) in the human brain (e.g. [4,6–9]), including in regions showing very large
differences between females and males (e.g. [10–16]).1 For example, in a study
by Garcia-Falgueras et al. [14], the intermediate nucleus (InM) of the hypothala-
mus is on average about twice as large in males compared with females.
Nevertheless, in about a third of the males the InM is the size typical of females.
Ten years out from this call for more careful conceptualization of the relation-
ships between sex and the brain, we often remain encumbered by the same
imprecise language that McCarthy & Konkle [4] addressed. While some newer
scientific work seems to have dropped the use of dimorphism or reference to
male versus female brains, instead referring to human brains [8,17], the use of
the word dimorphism to describe sex-related brain differences appears in the
scientific literature frequently and seemingly without critique (e.g. [18–21]).
Matters are far worse in popular renditions of scientific findings. These routinely

 portray brain differences as dimorphic, uncritically compar-
ing ‘male brains’ to ‘female brains’ [12–24] (as opposed to
comparing brains from males to brains from females).
Even if we were to routinely disentangle the concepts of
difference and dimorphism with regard to specific brain
features, we would be left with conceptual difficulties. This
is because, as explained in §2 below, the existence of differ-
ences between the brains of males and the brains of females
is insufficient for describing and understanding the relation-
ships between sex and the brain. In this article, we offer an
approach to thinking about variation in brain structure and
function that pulls us outside the dimorphism-difference for-
mulation. We consider the implications of this approach for
future research including both basic and clinical inquiry
and in the light of the requirement that sex be explicitly
included in all research studies by the United States National
Institutes of Health [25,26] and of similar policies by Canada
and the European Union [27,28].
2. Developing the mosaic brain hypothesis
Consider the following illustration using a highly simplified
‘brain’ composed of two regions, A and B, each of which
can take one of two states, 1 or 2. A ‘state’ in this illustration
could be a volume, size, structure, locus of specific gene
expression or other functional difference. For argument’s
sake, the reader might think of A as a hypothalamic nucleus
and B as a subcomponent of the hippocampus, and imagine
that each of these components may be small (state 1) or large
(state 2). Consider further that there is a sex difference in both
components, so that in two-thirds of females component A
is small (i.e. in state 1), whereas in two-thirds of males
component A is large (i.e. in state 2), and the same is true
for component B (i.e. it is small (state 1) in two-thirds of
females and large (state 2) in two-thirds of males). Is the exist-
ence of sex differences sufficient to conclude that this
population of ‘brains’ is essentially polarized into two types
of brain? Moreover, is the existence of sex differences
enough to characterize the population? It turns out that the
answer to both questions is no.
Suppose we were studying 18 brains, nine from males and
nine from females. There are several ways to imagine fulfilling
the conditions described in the previous paragraph (figure 1).
In population 1, all the brains are internally consistent in the
form of their components, that is, both components are either
in the form prevalent in females (i.e. small), or both are in the
form prevalent in males (i.e. large). In this example, the popu-
lation is indeed split into two types of brains, small brains (A1,
B1) and large brains (A2, B2) in equal proportions, with small
brains being typical of females (as two-thirds of females have a
small brain) and large brains typical of males (as two-thirds of
males have a large brain).
In population 2, there are four types of brains: three (A1,
B1) brains from females, three (A2, B2) brains from males, six
(A1, B2) brains, three from males and three from females, and
six (A2, B1) brains, three from males and three from females.
Population 3 further complicates the possibilities: here there
are five (A1, B1) brains, one from a male and four from
females; similarly, there are five (A2, B2) brains, one from a
female and four from males; finally (A1, B2) and (A2, B1)
brains come in equal number from males and females. In
populations 2 and 3, some brain types are equally likely in
females and males, (A1, B2) and (A2, B1), whereas some
are more common in one sex over the other ((A1, B1) brains
are more common in females compared with males, and
(A2, B2) brains are more common in males compared with
females). Note, however, that the internally consistent brain
types ((A1, B1) and (A2, B2)), although more common in
one sex over the other, are not typical of that sex, i.e. only a min-
ority of subjects from each sex category has them. So while it
is true in all three populations that an (A1, B1) brain is most
likely to belong to a female, in populations 2 and 3 it is not
true that a female is most likely to have an (A1, B1) brain.
In fact, she is just as likely (in population 3) or more likely
(population 2), to have a mosaic brain, i.e. a brain that has
one component in the form more typical of females (i.e. in
state 1) and one component in the form more typical of
males (i.e. in state 2).
Are there any data supporting the existence of mosaic
brains? Joel [29,30] has recently suggested that such evidence
may be found in animal studies reporting that the effects of
sex on the brain differ even to the point of opposition under
varied environmental conditions and that sex-by-environment
interactions may differ for different brain features. For
example, Reich et al. [31] found that three weeks of mild
stress reversed a sex difference in the density of CB1 receptors
in rats’ dorsal hippocampus. Thus, what was typical in one sex
category under some conditions (i.e. low density of CB1 recep-
tors in non-stressed females and high density of CB1 receptors
in non-stressed males) was typical in the other sex category
under other conditions (i.e. following three weeks of stress).

 A different sex-by-environment interaction determined the
density of CB1 receptors in the ventral hippocampus, as the
same manipulation (three weeks of mild stress) eliminated a
sex difference in the density of these receptors in the ventral
hippocampus. Thus, even when considering only a single
characteristic (the density of CB1 receptors) and only two
environmental conditions (no stress versus three weeks of
mild stress), the hippocampus can take three forms: low den-
sity of CB1 receptors in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus
(non-stressed females and stressed males), high receptor den-
sity in dorsal and ventral hippocampus (non-stressed males),
high receptor density in dorsal hippocampus and low receptor
density in ventral hippocampus (stressed females). Stated in
terms of our hypothetical example, there are two components
(A and B ¼ dorsal and ventral hippocampus) that can assume
one of two states (1 and 2 ¼ low and high receptor density),
and three types of ‘brains’: (A1, B1), (A2, B2) and (A2, B1).
Similar findings have been reported following other forms of
manipulation (e.g. rearing conditions, pharmacological chal-
lenges, acute and chronic stress), for a variety of neural and
regional characteristics (e.g. spine density, dendritic arboriza-
tion, axonal branching, number of neurons, number of glia
cells, size of a nucleus), and for many brain regions and neuro-
transmitter systems [32–54]; thus it is highly likely that brain
cells, brain regions, and brains as a whole, are multimorphic
rather than dimorphic [29,30].
How does this exercise apply to human brains, for which
hundreds of regions have been analysed for sex differences in
size, volume or other characteristics? Joel and colleagues [55]
recently attempted to answer exactly this question using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They analysed volume,
cortical thickness, diffusion anisotropy or connectivity in
over 1400 human brains from four datasets. In each dataset,
they identified a subset of between 7 and 12 brain regions
(or connections) that mostly differed between the sexes, and
determined for each brain whether the form of each of these
regions was at the side of the distribution where females were
more prevalent than males (‘female-end’) or at the side of the
distribution where males were more prevalent than females
(‘male-end’). They found that regardless of the sample, age,
type of magnetic resonance imaging, method of analysis, and
exact definition of the ‘male-end’ and ‘female-end’ zones,
brains that had at least one region with a ‘male-end’ score
and one region with a ‘female-end’ score (a condition they
have termed substantial variability) were more prevalent than
brains that had only ‘male-end’ or only ‘female-end’ scores.
For example, defining the ‘male-end’ and ‘female-end’ zones
as the scores of the 33% most extreme males and females,
respectively, between 23 and 53% of brains (depending on
the sample) had at least one region with a ‘male-end’ score
and one region with a ‘female-end’ score, whereas the percent-
age of brains with all ‘male-end’ or all ‘female-end’ scores was
between 0 and 8% [55].
As figure 1 demonstrates, the small percentage of internally
consistent brains found in Joel and colleagues’ study does not
result from the overlap between the distribution of females and
males in every brain region. If brains were internally consistent,
then brains would have only ‘male-end’ features, only ‘female-
end’ features, or only ‘intermediate’ features (scores in between
the other two zones), with some males and females having
brains with only ‘female-end’ features or only ‘male-end’ fea-
tures, respectively (as in population 1, figure 1). However, a
simulation of data from Joel et al. [55], which tested how the
chances of obtaining internal consistency versus substantial
variability would change under different degrees of random
noise in an otherwise internally consistent brain, did not support
the possibility that brains are internally consistent in the degree
of ‘maleness–femaleness’ of each of their elements [55].
Thus, rather than being consistent in their degree of
‘maleness–femaleness’, most brains consist of unique ‘mosaics’
of features, some more common in females compared with
males, some more common in males compared to females,
and some common in both females and males. Moreover, this
mosaic changes as we experience the world, and, as the
animal studies reviewed above demonstrate, some of these
changes may be sex-dependent [29].
The animal data reviewed indicate that mosaic brains are
not merely a hypothetical construct, while the analysis of
internal consistency in the human brain reveals that brain
mosaicism is an important characteristic of human brains.
Furthermore, the prevalence of mosaicism is at variance
with the assumption that sex divides brains into two separate
populations. Instead, we can consider the possibility that
brains belong to a single highly heterogeneous population in
which there may be differences between females and males
in the frequencies of specific brain mosaics (e.g. brains with
only ‘female-end’ characteristics although rare in the popu-
lation, are more common in females compared with males).
Describing the population of brains as a single highly hetero-
geneous, one can still account for the existence of group-level
sex/gender differences in brain structure as well as the obser-
vation that different studies (i.e. using different samples of
females and males) report different structural and functional
differences between brains of females and brains of males
(e.g. [55–58]).
3. Sex and brain function
Even when differences between females and males in brain
structure are found, they do not necessarily translate into differ-
ences in function. De Vries emphasized the importance of the
principle of ‘compensation’ in considering the functionality of
a varietyof sex effects [59–61]. He and others refer to compensa-
tory sex-dependent processes that act to reduce rather than
create differences between females and males. Probably the
best-known compensatory mechanism is X inactivation, which
occurs only in females, and compensates for the difference
between females and males in the number of X chromosomes
(i.e. XX versus XY) (for review, see [59,61]). Thus, a truly
dimorphic sex-dependent process (i.e. one that occurs in only
one sex category) actsto counteract a difference between females
and males. In this situation, we could have concluded that males
and females not only differ in their chromosomal complement
but also in the regulation of gene expression, missing the point
that the second difference counteracts the first, thus lessening
overall functional differences.
Yet, when scientists and laypeople list differences between
females and males in the brain, they often implicitly assume
that the more differences there are, the more different are
the two sex categories, ignoring the possibility that some—
possibly many—differences may compensate for others (for
review and examples see [59–61]; see [62] for a detailed
example of compensation in the dopaminergic system and
[63] for similar considerations in the case of sex effects on
gene networks).

 Compensation works independently of sexual dimorph-
ism and internal consistency. That is, even if differences
between females and males are dimorphic and internally con-
sistent (as in the case of the chromosome complement (XX or
XY) and X inactivation (present or absent, respectively)), it is
still possible that they are cancelling out each other, thus
resulting in two functionally similar systems.
Taken together, the prevalence of brain mosaicism com-
bined with the principle of functional compensation predict
that brain function will not usually be characterized by
dimorphism. Indeed, direct assessment of brain function
using functional imaging techniques most often reveals
small, highly overlapping, group-level differences between
human females and males. Furthermore, the regions in which
such differences are found often differ in different studies
(e.g. [56–58]). Similarly, studies of behaviour, in humans and
other mammals, reveal overlap in all types of behaviour,
including sexual behaviour (e.g. [64–68]). In a study on
internal consistency in human behaviour, Joel et al. [55]
found that people possess unique mosaics of ‘feminine’ (i.e.
more
common
in
females
compared
to
males)
and
‘masculine’ (i.e. more common in males compared to females)
psychological characteristics. These observations are better
explained by the assumption that human brains belong to a
single heterogeneous population than by the assumption that
they belong to two classes, ‘female brains’ and ‘male brains’.
Larson et al. [69], for example, suggest that individuals with
autism spectrum disorder have an ‘extreme of the typical
male brain’ in opposition to a cognitive profile that they
describe as an ‘extreme of the typical female brain’ ([69],
p. 1). In contrast, under our single heterogeneous mosaic
brain assumption, the existence of differences between females
and males in the prevalence of specific behaviours and psycho-
pathologies (e.g. extreme physical aggression, autism) is
accounted for by the existence of differences between females
and males in the frequencies of rare brain mosaics (e.g. brains
with only ‘male-end’ characteristics although rare, are more
common in males compared with females [55]).
4. The implications of the mosaic approach
for future research
We started our discussion with the assertion that the exist-
ence of differences between the brains of females and males
does not allow us to conclude that brains belong to two
types nor to characterize the relationships between sex and
the brain. Such characterization is necessary for studying
sex effects on the brain as well as for studying brain structure,
function and dysfunction in general. This is because if human
brains belonged to two distinct populations, then every study
of brain structure and function, even if not designed to detect
sex effects (e.g. a study of the neural substrates of cognitive
functions, psychopathologies, etc.) should include sex cat-
egory (female, male) as a variable to control for sex-related
variability, and studies designed to reveal possible sex effects
on the brain would simply list differences between brains of
females and brains of males. On the other extreme, if human
brains belonged to a single heterogeneous population, then
sex category should not be included in studies of brain struc-
ture, function and dysfunction, and listing sex differences
would not be a useful strategy for studying sex effects on
the brain. Future studies may specify when sex category
should be included as a variable and when not, and reveal
new ways to consider sex as a variable between these two
extremes (include/exclude).
Although the data reviewed above do not support the two
distinct populations view, they are not sufficient to fully
characterize the relationships between sex and the brain (e.g.
populations 2 and 3; figure 1). We hope future studies will
fill in this gap. Yet, current data are sufficient to outline a gen-
eral direction for studies of sex effects on the brain and for
studies of brain structure, function and dysfunction in general.
Thus, given that brains are mosaics of features and that infor-
mation processing in the brain depends on networks that
comprise many brain regions rather than on regions working
in isolation, we need to develop or adopt analytical methods
that take into account both the variability in the human brain
(rather than treating it as noise) and individual differences in
the specific composition of the brain mosaic. Analytical
methods with the above characteristics have been developed
for working with other types of data. For example, with the
explosion of large-scale biological data following the sequen-
cing of the human genome, methods for analysis of large-
scale genetic variation data have been developed and used
for detecting patterns of change that are characteristic of
specific disorders (e.g. [70–72]). We hope similar approaches
will soon be adapted to or developed for studying the function
and dysfunction of the human brain.
But what should one do as we develop such tactics?
We would like to distinguish between including sex category
as a component of a study’s methods and as a component of
the results. We recommend using both males and females as
study subjects in any experimental design (sex as a component
of methods), because such inclusion is crucial for ensuring that
we more fully understand species’ variability than is possible
when only males or only females are studied. In appendix A,
we suggest an approach for conducting experiments with
both females and males as subjects. With respect to using sex
category as a variable in the analysis of the results, we will
separate the discussion of humans and laboratory animals.
(a) Should sex category be used as a variable in studies
of the human brain?
We believe that current data are better explained by the
assumption that human brains belong to a single hetero-
geneous population rather than to two distinct populations.
If this is so, then using sex category as a variable is both
unnecessary and misleading. Comparing brains of females to
brains of males would be analogous to comparing two samples
randomly drawn from a single population of brains, rather
than to comparing two samples, one randomly drawn from a
population of ‘male brains’ and the other from a population
of ‘female brains’ [29]. As a result, although such comparisons
may well yield significant differences between females and
males (due to the high heterogeneity of the population), these
differences would probably reflect a false-positive finding
resulting from a chance difference between the two samples
included in a specific study. This concern is emphasized by
our and others’ findings that different structural and functional
differences between brains of females and brains of males are
often found in different samples (e.g. [55–58]). We therefore
recommend avoiding the use of sex category as an analytic
variable in studies of the structure and function of the
human brain (for a similar recommendation, see [3,73,74]).

 Since sex category isone ofthe most salientgroupingdimen-
sions of humans, psychological and social variables, such as
socio-economic status, stress, type of education and personality
characteristics, often correlate with sex category. Therefore,
althoughwedonot recommendusing sex categoryasavariable,
we do recommend that studies of brain and behaviour include
advanced planning about which of these psychological and
social variables might be relevant, in order to include them in
the initial study design [3]. Krieger [75,76] offers well-developed
concepts for the study of what she calls ‘pathways to embodi-
ment’ that are applicable to the study of sex categories and the
brain. Psychological and social variables that correlate with
sex category should not, however, be integrated into a single
measure of gender, because gender is a complex, multilayered
system [3,77,78], with psychological, behavioural and social
components, each of which is multidimensional and cannot be
reduced to a single variable (e.g. [3,77–81]).
One exception to our current recommendation to exclude
sex category from analysis might involve studies of brain path-
ology, in which there are many reports of differences between
human females and males (e.g. [82–88]). These differences,
which are not categorical (i.e. there is no example of a condition
which is evident in only one sex category), could reflect the
effects of gender rather than the effects of sex (e.g. [2,89–91]),
and as suggested above, might be accounted for by differences
between females and males in the frequencies of rare brain
mosaics rather than differences between a ‘male brain’ and a
‘female brain’. However, as differences between females and
males in pathology and in response to treatment may be of
importance in the clinic, including sex category as a variable
in these studies could provide a first indication of a possible
contribution of sex or of a variable that correlates with sex
(e.g. elements of gender). Based on such indications, future
studies would be needed to better detect the real variable(s),
rather than relying on sex category as a stand-in.
(b) Should sex category be used as a variable in studies
of the brain of laboratory animals?
In contrast to humans, genetic, developmental and environ-
mental conditions can be highly controlled in laboratory
animals. Thus, the variability of factors that might interact
with sex to affect the brain (such as age, stress, housing con-
ditions, nutrition, history of drug exposure; for references and
review, see [29,30]) is greatly reduced. Consequently, brains
of laboratory animals in a specific experiment are expected
to be less heterogeneous compared with brains of humans
in a single study. Therefore in laboratory animals, differences
between the sex categories may indeed reveal the effects of
sex rather than the effects of some chance difference between
the sample of females and the sample of males in the study.
On the other hand, the controlled genetic, developmental
and environmental conditions limit the results obtained in an
animal study to the specific environmental, developmental
and genetic conditions under which sex effects were assessed
(see many examples for such context-specificity in the field of
animal models of psychopathology [92]). Therefore, we
should be careful in attempting to generalize from the specific
experimental conditions to other conditions and other species,
especially humans. Moreover, in order to obtain a better under-
standing of the effects of sex on the phenomena under study,
these effects should be studied using varied environments
and on different genetic backgrounds (e.g. using different
strains of inbred animals; for a similar position, see [3,74,78]).
For example, currently a powerful method, the four core geno-
types model is being used to disentangle the genetic and
hormonal components of sex effects on brain and behaviour
[93]. But as effective as this approach is, as long as different
environmental conditions are omitted from experimental
designs it could well be that observed sex effects on brain
and behaviour will be improperly interpreted. Crews et al.
[94] and de Medeiros et al. [95] offer one rigorous approach
to manipulating environments by using cross fostering to
raise mice in litters with different sibling ratios. This permits
the separation of litter effects from in utero hormonal effects
(e.g. [96]). In addition to litter composition, there are known
interactions of sex with other maternal factors (e.g. maternal
deprivation, maternal stress [43,48,52,53]) and method of
rearing (number of cage mates, enriched versus standard
environments [37,97,98]). What seems to be missing entirely
from the rodent work on sex effects on brain development
are studies conducted in simulated naturalistic environments.
It would surprise us if such studies did not change our under-
standings of sex effects on sex-related behaviours and brain
development in rodents. Embracing the concept of the
mosaic brain should lead to multivariate experimental designs
in which possible sex category effects are examined under
changing environmental and genetic conditions.
Although in animals there is probably no equivalence to
gender as a social system, there are still environmental vari-
ables that, in addition to physiological variables (e.g. weight),
correlate with sex category (e.g. number of animals in the
home cage [99]). Studies in laboratory animals that use sex
category as a variable should take special care to either control
for (physiological) and avoid (environmental) sex differences
in these variables, or systematically manipulate them.
5. Concluding remarks
Although comparisons between brains of females and brains of
males often reveal differences, the existence of such differences
does not unravel the relationships between sex and the brain.
Nor is it sufficient to characterize the population of brains.
Such characterization is necessary for studying sex effects on
the brain as well as for studying brain structure, function and
dysfunction in general. This is particularly timely in view of
the NIH initiative to consider sex in every study [25,26]. In lab-
oratory animals, in which brain variability is restricted by the
tight control of genetic, developmental and environmental
conditions, sex category can be used as a variable to reveal
sex effects. However, given that sex interacts with other factors
to affect the brain, sex effects on the brain must be understood
as context-dependent, where context relates to the specific
environmental, developmental and genetic conditions under
which sex effects were assessed and under which the animals
developed. In humans, we believe that the existence of
group-level sex/gender differences in brain structure, the
observation that different studies report different structural
and functional sex differences, as well as the existence of sex
differences in the prevalence of specific behaviours and
psychopathologies are currently better explained by the
assumption that human brains belong to a single hetero-
geneous population than by the assumption that they belong
to two distinct populations. We therefore recommend includ-
ing equal numbers of males and females in all studies while

 at the same time avoiding the use of sex category as a variable
in studies of brain structure and function. We hope future
studies will reveal additional ways to consider sex as a variable
or specify when sex category should be included as a variable
and when not. We believe that developing or adopting analyti-
cal methods that take into account the heterogeneity of the
human brain is crucial for the advancement of human health
and well-being.

Appendix A. An approach for conducting
experiments with both females and males
as subjects
This appendix describes how to treat sex category in studies of
brain and behaviour that do not aim to assess sex effects, for
example, in a study assessing the effects of a new treatment
of depression in an animal model of this disorder. In such a
study, the aim is achieved by including males and females
and by looking for interactions between Sex category and Treat-
ment, rather than by looking at the main effect of Sex category,
that is, at sex differences. This is because if the effects of an
independent variable such as Treatment, do not interact
with Sex category, then even if there are sex differences (for
example, females are on average more resilient than males
in all treatment conditions), this has no relevance for the
study’s question regarding the effectiveness of the treatment.
Obviously, finding such a sex difference, provided that the
effect size is large, may form the basis for a new study with a
new aim, namely, unraveling the mechanisms that make
females more resilient than males in this animal model.
The original study (assessing the effects of a new treatment
of depression) should include the following steps:
— Start with n (half females and half males) sufficient to
detect the effect of the variable in question (i.e. Treat-
ment), that is, same n one would have used for a study
of subjects from only one Sex category. Note that a
recent meta-analysis reveals that females and males do
not differ in the variability of many behavioural and bio-
logical variables [97], so there is no need to change power
calculations due to the inclusion of both females and
males in the same study.
— Look at the actual data to see if they suggest an interaction
between Sex category and Treatment, that is, if they suggest
that the effects of the treatment are different in females com-
pared with males (look at the actual data not just the
statistics, which at this point may not be powered enough
to detect a significant Sex category � Treatment inter-
action). If this is not the case, proceed with the analysis of
the results focusing on the effects of Treatment. Sex cat-
egory may be used as an independent variable in these
analyses to decrease within-group variability, but if Sex cat-
egory does not have an effect, this will only lead to a
reduction of degrees of freedom. If the data do suggest a
Sex category � Treatment interaction, then double the
number of animals (i.e. run a replication of the study with
the same n (half males and half females) as in the original
study), so that it becomes possible to assess the effects of
Treatment in the two sex categories.
The suggested practice is expected to decrease the overall
number of animals in research, especially in domains in
which animals are bred for a specific study (as in studies
involving genetic manipulations) and the use of only one
sex category leads to killing of animals of the other sex
category.
— When reporting the results, always report effect size and
not only significance level, and present data using actual
distributions (e.g. scatterplots) and not only means and
standard deviations or standard errors.
This is good practice in general, as it helps differentiate
between significant results and important results, but
is
especially
important
when
reporting
differences
between females and males, because of the current ten-
dency to treat every difference between means as a
dimorphic difference. Reporting actual data and effect
sizes enables scientists to appreciate the extent to which
sex category explains (or does not) the variability in
their results [78].
