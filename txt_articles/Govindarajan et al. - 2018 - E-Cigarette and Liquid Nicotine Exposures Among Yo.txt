OBJECTIVES: To investigate exposures to liquid nicotine (including electronic cigarette devices 
and liquids) among children <6 years old in the United States and evaluate the impact of 
legislation requiring child-resistant packaging for liquid nicotine containers.
METHODS: Liquid nicotine exposure data from the National Poison Data System for January 
2012 through April 2017 were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 8269 liquid nicotine exposures among children <6 years old reported 
to US poison control centers during the study period. Most (92.5%) children were exposed 
through ingestion and 83.9% were children <3 years old. Among children exposed to 
liquid nicotine, 35.1% were treated and released from a health care facility, and 1.4% were 
admitted. The annual exposure rate per 100 000 children increased by 1398.2% from 0.7 
in 2012 to 10.4 in 2015, and subsequently decreased by 19.8% from 2015 to 8.3 in 2016. 
Among states without a preexisting law requiring child-resistant packaging for liquid 
nicotine containers, there was a significant decrease in the mean number of exposures 
during the 9 months before compared with the 9 months after the federal child-resistant 
packaging law went into effect, averaging 4.4 (95% confidence interval: −7.1 to −1.7) fewer 
exposures per state after implementation of the law.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric exposures to liquid nicotine have decreased since January 2015, which 
may, in part, be attributable to legislation requiring child-resistant packaging and greater 
public awareness of risks associated with electronic cigarette products. Liquid nicotine 
continues to pose a serious risk for young children. Additional regulation of these products 
is warranted.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Since their 
introduction to the US market in 2007, use of 
electronic cigarettes has been increasing. There 
has been a concurrent increase in liquid nicotine 
exposures reported to US poison control centers 
among children <6 years old.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: From January 2012 
through April 2017, there were 8269 liquid nicotine 
exposures reported among young children, peaking 
in January 2015. The annual exposure rate increased 
by ∼1400% from 2012 to 2015 and then decreased by 
∼20% from 2015 to 2016.

 Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
are handheld devices that produce 
an aerosol (commonly known 
as a vapor) for inhalation from a 
solution that often contains nicotine, 
flavoring, and solvents.1 Since their 
introduction, there has been an 
increase in the use of e-cigarettes in 
the United States.2, 
 
3 There also has 
been an increase in liquid nicotine 
exposures from e-cigarette devices 
and liquids reported to US poison 
control centers (PCCs), frequently 
among children younger than 6 
years of age.4, 
5 These exposures are 
concerning because a small volume 
of concentrated nicotine solution 
could easily deliver the estimated 
lethal dose of 6.5 to 13.0 mg/kg body 
weight to a young child, 
6 and at least 
2 young children have already died of 
liquid nicotine.7 
–10 Children exposed 
to e-cigarette liquid nicotine have 
5.2 times higher odds of a health 
care facility admission and 2.6 times 
higher odds of having a serious 
medical outcome than children 
exposed to cigarettes.8
Authors of case reports have 
described liquid nicotine exposures 
in both adults and children in several 
countries.7, 
 
10 
– 
16 In state-specific 
studies, an increase in e-cigarette 
exposures reported to PCCs has 
been noted.17, 
18 Authors of other 
studies using the National Poison 
Data System (NPDS) have described 
trends in exposures to cigarettes 
and e-cigarettes in all age groups9 
and specifically among children <6 
years old.8 Increased awareness of 
the risks of liquid nicotine exposures 
led to state and federal legislation 
requiring child-resistant packaging 
for liquid nicotine containers.19 
Although there have been previous 
studies of liquid nicotine exposure 
among young children, there has 
not been a study on exposure rates 
after the passage of laws requiring 
child-resistant packaging for liquid 
nicotine containers.
In this study, we analyze data 
from the NPDS to investigate the 
characteristics and trends of liquid 
nicotine exposures and is the first to 
compare liquid nicotine exposures 
among young children before and 
after adoption of legislation requiring 
child-resistant liquid nicotine 
packaging.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Sources
Data from the NPDS were analyzed to 
investigate liquid nicotine exposures 
(including e-cigarette devices and 
liquids) among children <6 years 
old. The NPDS is maintained by the 
American Association of Poison 
Control Centers (AAPCC) and 
includes reported exposure data  
from the regional PCCs serving the  
50 US states, District of Columbia, 
and several US territories. Exposure 
data from the PCCs are uploaded to 
the NPDS on a near–real time basis.20
Federal and state legislation 
requiring child-resistant packaging 
for liquid nicotine containers was 
identified by using the Thomson 
Reuters Westlaw database.21 Official 
legislative databases for individual 
states were accessed for additional 
details as needed. A list was compiled 
of the effective dates for state 
legislation, defined as the date when 
it was illegal for liquid nicotine 
to be sold without child-resistant 
packaging in that state (Table 1).
Case Selection Criteria
Liquid nicotine exposures among 
children <6 years old from January 
1, 2012, through April 30, 2017, 
were extracted from the NPDS by 
using the AAPCC generic codes for 
e-cigarette devices and liquids. 
In this study, we only included 
single-substance human exposures 
occurring within the 50 US states or 
District of Columbia with the reason 
“Unintentional – General.” Cases with 
a medical outcome of “confirmed 
nonexposure” or “unrelated effect” 
were excluded.

 Study Variables
Liquid nicotine exposures were 
characterized by age and sex of 
the child, date of exposure, route 
of exposure, level of health care 
received, medical outcome, and 
“related” clinical effects. The 
AAPCC defines “minor effect, 
” 
“moderate effect, 
” and “major effect” 
for medical outcome as follows. 
“Minor effect” indicates that the 
individual developed some minimally 
bothersome signs and symptoms, 
typically limited to the skin or 
mucous membranes, which resolved 
quickly with no resulting disability 
or disfigurement. In a “moderate 
effect, 
” the individual exhibited 
signs or symptoms that were not 
life-threatening but were more 
pronounced, prolonged, or systemic 
than minor symptoms. Treatment 
was indicated, and the individual 
had no residual disability or 
disfigurement. In a “major effect, 
” the 
individual displayed life-threatening 
signs or symptoms, or symptoms that 
caused significant residual disability 
or disfigurement.20
For this study, the 50 states 
and District of Columbia were 
dichotomized into states with and 
without a child-resistant packaging 
law for liquid nicotine containers 
(Table 1). States were considered 
to have such a law if that law went 
into effect before July 26, 2016, the 
date when the federal Child Nicotine 
Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015 
(Public Law No. 114-116) went into 
effect.22
Statistical Analysis and Ethical 
Considerations
SPSS 24.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) 
and SAS Enterprise Guide 7.11 
HF3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) 
were used to analyze data. Overall 
and state-specific exposure rates 
were calculated by using the July 
1 US Census Bureau population 
estimates for children <6 years 
old for 2012–2016.23 Exposure 
rates were only calculated for the 
years with 12 months of complete 
data (2012–2016). Trends for the 
monthly number of exposures were 
analyzed by using piecewise linear 
regression with breakpoints at 
November 2012 and January 2015. 
To assess the effect of the federal 
law for liquid nicotine child-resistant 
containers, only states without 
a similar preexisting law were 
included. The difference in number 
of exposures before and after the 
law was calculated for each state by 
using data from 9-month periods 
before (October 2015–June 2016) 
and after (August 2016–April 2017) 
the federal law went into effect. 
A paired t test was used to assess 
the equality of the mean number 
of exposures during the 9 months 
before and after the federal law went 
into effect. Statistical significance 
was determined by using α = .05. 
The institutional review board of the 
authors’ institution judged this study 
as exempt.
RESULTS
General Characteristics
From January 1, 2012, to April  
30, 2017, there were 8269 liquid 
nicotine exposures among children  
<6 years old reported to US PCCs. 
The median age of exposed children 
was 2.0 years (interquartile range = 
1.3–2.0). The number of exposures  
(n = 3146) peaked at 1 year of age, 
and children <3 years old accounted 
for 83.9% (n = 6940) of exposures. 
Most (92.5%, n = 7649) children 
were exposed through ingestion  
and 55.3% (n = 4572) of exposures  
were among boys. More than one-
third (35.1%, n = 2902) of exposed  
children were treated and/or  
evaluated and released, and 1.4%  
(n = 115) were admitted to the hospital. 
One-fifth of exposed children (20.3%, 
n = 1677) experienced a minor effect, 
followed by moderate effect (1.6%,  
n = 132) and major effect (0.1%, n = 8). 
One death occurred to a 1-year-old 
boy. One-fourth (24.6%, n = 2032) of 
children exposed to liquid nicotine 
experienced 1 or more related 
clinical effects. Severe clinical effects 
were rare, and included coma (n = 4), 
seizure (n = 4), respiratory arrest  
(n = 3), and cardiac arrest (n = 1).
Exposure Rates and Trends
For years with 12 months of 
complete data (2012–2016), the 
rate of liquid nicotine exposure 
was 6.4 exposures per 100 000 US 
children <6 years old. State-specific 
rates ranged from 1.6 (Washington, 
DC) to 22.2 (OK) (Fig 1). The 
overall exposure rate per 100 000 
children increased by 1398.2% from 
0.7 in 2012 to 10.4 in 2015, and 
subsequently decreased by 19.8% 
from 10.4 in 2015 to 8.3 in 2016  
(Fig 2).
The monthly number of liquid 
nicotine exposures was lowest in 
February and July 2012 (8 exposures 
each month) and peaked in January 
2015 (274 exposures; Fig 3). There 
was no significant change in the 
monthly number of exposures from 
January through November of 2012 
(m = −0.3, P = .816), followed by a 
significant increase of 2390.1%  
(m = 8.6, P < .001) from November 
2012 through January 2015, and  
then a significant decrease of 48.2%  
(m = −3.9, P < .001) from January 
2015 through April 2017. From 
August 2016 (175 exposures), the 
first month after the federal Child 
Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act 
went into effect, to April 2017  
(142 exposures), there was an 18.9% 
decrease in the number of monthly 
liquid nicotine exposures.
Among states without a preexisting 
law, there was a significant difference 
(P = .002) in the mean number of 
exposures during the 9 months 
before compared with the 9 months 
after the Child Nicotine Poisoning 
Prevention Act of 2015 went into 
effect, averaging 4.4 (95% confidence 
interval: −7.1 to −1.7) fewer 
exposures per state during the

the law.
DISCUSSION
During the study period, there 
were >8200 exposures to liquid 
nicotine among children <6 years 
old reported to US PCCs. Although 
serious medical outcomes were not 
common, authors of previous studies 
have found that e-cigarette and liquid 
nicotine exposures more often are 
serious and result in health care 
facility admission than exposures 
to traditional cigarettes.8, 
 
9 Previous 
reports have described the severe 
consequences that can occur from 
liquid nicotine exposure, including 
death.7 
– 
16
The use of e-cigarettes has increased 
rapidly since their introduction in 
the United States in 2007. In 2009, 
0.6% of US adults reported ever 
using an e-cigarette, with studies 
reporting increasing use.2, 
 
24 The 
authors of a 2014 report indicated 
that 12.6% of adults had ever used 
an e-cigarette.25 Younger adults 
(18–24 years old) have reported a 
high prevalence of e-cigarette use.26 
Among middle and high school 
students, e-cigarettes were the most 
commonly used tobacco product in 
2016, with 4.3% and 11.3% reporting 
use, respectively.3 E-cigarette sales 
at convenience stores and other 
outlets grew from 2011 to 2015.27 
Furthermore, from 2014 to 2015, 
there was a 303.7% increase in 
e-cigarette liquid sales specifically.27 
Although nicotine-free products 
are available, 99.0% of e-cigarette 
products sold in the United States in 
2015 contained nicotine.28
As the use of e-cigarettes increased, 
so did the number of liquid nicotine 
exposures reported to US PCCs. The 
authors of 1 study reported that 
exposures among children <6 years 
old increased by 0.55 additional 
exposures per month between  
June 2010 and December 2012  
and then accelerated to 6.03

 additional exposures per month 
between January 2013 and 
September 2013.4 The authors  
of another study observed an 
∼1500% increase in monthly 
e-cigarette and liquid nicotine 
exposures among children  
<6 years old from January 2012  
to April 2015.8 Our study is the  
first to report a more recent  
reversal in this trend. In this  
study, the monthly number of 
reported liquid nicotine exposures 
climbed until January 2015,  
followed by an overall downward 
trend through April 2017.
In July 2014, the Child Nicotine 
Poisoning Prevention Act was 
initially introduced in the US 
Congress.29 By mid-January  
2015, at the peak of the children’s 
exposures, state legislation in New 
York, Minnesota, Vermont, and 
Illinois requiring child-resistant 
packaging for liquid nicotine 
containers had gone into effect. 
Fourteen additional states  
(Table 1) soon followed before  
the federal law’s effective date.22 
During the 9 months after the 
effective date (July 26, 2016) of  
the federal law, there was an  
overall decrease of 18.9% in the 
monthly number of liquid nicotine 
exposures. Among states that had  
not previously enacted a similar  
state law, there was a significant 
decrease in the mean number of 
liquid nicotine exposures among 
children <6 years old when 
comparing the 9 months before  
and after the federal law. Although 
the federal law may have contributed 
to this decline, its impact is uncertain 
because of a number of potentially 
confounding factors and the lack  
of a comparison group. The frequency  
of exposures had been decreasing  
before its enactment. Various  
factors likely contributed to the 
observed decrease, including state 
legislation requiring child-resistant 
packaging; efforts by public health 
professionals, clinicians, and child 
safety advocates to inform child 
caregivers of the risk of liquid 
nicotine exposures; and widespread 
media attention. State legislation 
may have influenced child exposures 
even in states without liquid 
nicotine packaging laws because 
manufacturers may have begun to 
distribute child-resistant containers 
throughout the United States rather 
than produce different products 
for states with and without these 
requirements.
We were unable to detect differences 
in monthly liquid nicotine exposures 
before and after enactment of 
individual state legislation requiring 
child-resistant packaging for liquid 
nicotine containers because of 
the small number of exposures in 
individual states. Other factors also 
may have washed out the effects 
of these laws, such as continued 
presence of previously-purchased 
non–child-resistant containers 
in children’s homes. In addition, 
manufacturers and retailers 
were aware of the impending 
implementation dates of these 
state laws and may have begun to 
distribute child-resistant liquid 
nicotine containers before these 
dates.
Prevention
Although child-resistant packaging 
requirements for liquid nicotine 
containers have been established, 
more comprehensive requirements 
could further reduce the likelihood  
of serious poisonings. Flow 
restrictors effectively limit young 
children’s ability to empty the 
contents of liquid medicine  
bottles.30 Applying this technology  
to liquid nicotine bottles could 
limit the dose ingested by children 
who gain access to these bottles. 
Additionally, the Child Nicotine 
Poisoning Prevention Act only 
applies to liquid nicotine bottles 
and does not address the packaging 
or design of e-cigarette devices 
themselves. Chambers in refillable 
e-cigarette devices in which the 
liquid nicotine is held are another 
source of exposure. Child-resistant 
chambers in e-cigarette devices could

 help prevent liquid nicotine exposure 
among young children.
Liquid nicotine comes in a variety 
of candy, fruit, dessert, and other 
flavors that may be attractive to 
young children. By 2014, there 
were 7764 unique flavors found 
across all e-cigarette brands.31 
The majority of exposures in this 
study occurred through ingestion, 
which is associated with the 
exploratory behavior common 
among young children, but also may 
be influenced by the attractiveness 
of liquid nicotine flavors, scents, 
and packaging to a young child. For 
instance, a bestselling e-liquid sold 
at an online site is named “Fruit 
Hoops” and has packaging that 
features images of colorful cereal.32 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
and other health organizations have 
called on the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) to ban the use 
of flavors and attractive labeling for 
liquid nicotine.33
E-cigarette liquid can be purchased 
at different nicotine concentrations, 
typically varying from 0 to 36 
mg/mL.34 Concentrated nicotine 
solutions, such as 60 mg/mL, are 
also available to consumers, who 
can then dilute and mix their own 
e-cigarette liquids.16, 
 
34 A young 
child can easily ingest a lethal dose 
in 1 swallow.6 In 1 case report, a 15 
month-old child died after ingesting 
a dose of 4.1 mg/kg of liquid 
nicotine.10 The 1 death in our study 
was previously reported.7 Fatalities 
from liquid nicotine poisonings could 
be prevented by limiting the volume 
and concentration of liquid nicotine 
packaged in containers to a sublethal 
dose for an average young child. 
This approach has been used for >50 
years for such products as children’s 
aspirin.35
Future research should be conducted 
to assess the effect of flow restrictors, 
flavoring, labeling, concentration, 
and other product-related factors on 
liquid nicotine exposure and outcome 
rates among young children.
The FDA passed a final rule on May 10, 
2016, deeming all tobacco products, 
including e-cigarettes and liquid 
nicotine refill containers, under its 
authority. This required all e-cigarette 
products that went into market 
after February 15, 2007, to apply for 
FDA approval and also established 
several requirements that had to be 
implemented by varying deadlines.36 
However, in May 2017, the FDA 
announced delays in enforcement 
of future compliance deadlines 
for several of these requirements. 
Additionally, in July 2017, the FDA 
revealed a new regulatory plan 
that includes extending premarket 
review for e-cigarettes to August 
2022 and seeking public comment 
on regulation of “kid-appealing 
flavors in e-cigarettes.” 
37 In addition, 
the US Department of Justice has 
requested extensions in lawsuits that 
have challenged the FDA’s authority 
to enforce its deeming rule.38 The 
final outcome of these actions will 
determine the FDA’s future role in 
regulating e-cigarettes and liquid 
nicotine.
Study Limitations
This study has several limitations. 
Exposure calls to PCCs are voluntary; 
therefore, the NPDS underestimates 
the true incidence of exposures to 
liquid nicotine nationwide. NPDS 
data may not be representative of 
the entire spectrum of liquid nicotine 
exposures because of potential 
reporting bias. Exposures reported 
to PCCs do not necessarily represent 
ingestion, poisonings, or overdoses 
because exposures are not generally 
confirmed with definitive laboratory 
testing. Information provided to 
PCCs is by self-report, which cannot 
be completely verified by the PCCs 
or AAPCC. Differentiation of liquid 
nicotine exposures due to e-cigarette 
devices versus e-cigarette liquids  
was uncertain, thus limiting the 
ability to assess the impact of  
child-resistant packaging laws  
that only apply to e-cigarette  
liquid containers. Although calls 
to PCCs regarding liquid nicotine 
exposures have decreased since 
January 2015, the relationship of 
this decline with child-resistant 
packaging legislation is only an 
association; there are many other 
factors that may have influenced 
exposures and call rates. Despite 
these limitations, the NPDS is a 
comprehensive data source useful 
for investigating liquid nicotine 
exposures in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS
Liquid nicotine can pose a serious 
poisoning risk for young children. 
The frequency of liquid nicotine 
exposures among children <6 years 
old has decreased since January 
2015, which may, in part, be 
attributable to adoption of child-
resistant packaging laws for liquid 
nicotine containers and greater 
public awareness of the risks 
associated with these products. 
Additional measures, including 
child-resistant e-cigarette devices, 
use of flow restrictors on liquid 
nicotine containers, and regulations 
on e-cigarette liquid flavoring, 
labeling, and concentrations, could 
further reduce the incidence of 
these exposures and the likelihood 
of serious medical outcomes when 
exposures do occur.
