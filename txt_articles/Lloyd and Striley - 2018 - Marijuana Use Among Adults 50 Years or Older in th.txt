Literature Review
Introduction
The older adult population in the United States will dra-
matically increase in the upcoming decades. By 2050, 
the population 65 years or older will increase to an esti-
mated 83.7 million people (Colby & Ortman, 2014; 
Ortman, Velkoff, & Hogan, 2014). The Baby Boomer 
generation, consisting of births from 1946 to 1964, con-
stitutes a large proportion of the current older adult pop-
ulation (Ortman et al., 2014). The United States will 
experience a unique set of challenges as the older adult 
population increases, including increasing disease 
comorbidities and risk of mortality as well as increased 
drug use compared with previous older generations 
(Colliver, Compton, Gfroerer, & Condon, 2006; Wu & 
Blazer, 2011).
In addition to an increasing older adult population, 
the United States is experiencing changes in the legal-
ization, perception, and use of marijuana. As of 
November 2017, 29 states and the District of Columbia 
have laws that legalize medical marijuana (ProCon.org, 
2017), and eight states and the District of Columbia 
have laws that legalize recreational marijuana (Robinson, 
2017). Historically, the perception of marijuana use as a 
risk to health and limited access to marijuana served as 
protective factors for marijuana use among older popu-
lations in the United States (Salas-Wright et al., 2017). 
However, as the Baby Boomer generation grew older, 
people with a tolerant attitude toward marijuana use and 
higher rates of lifetime drug use than previous genera-
tions began to enter the older adult population (Colliver 
et al., 2006; Wu & Blazer, 2014).
Drug use habits are influenced not only by current 
political and societal changes in marijuana use but also 
by past experiences. For instance, in the United States, 
Baby Boomers came of age during movements such as 
the Vietnam War protests, the sexual revolution, and the 
civil rights movement. The large size of the Baby Boomer 
generation in the United States resulted in increased 
competition, increased peer pressure, and a changed 
youth culture (Cross & Kleinhesselink, 1985). In addi-
tion, political and social forces, including changes in sex-
role expectations and sexual attitudes and organized

Marijuana Use Among Adults 50 
Years or Older in the 21st Century
Shawnta L. Lloyd, MPH1 and Catherine W. Striley, PhD, 
MSW, MPE1
Abstract
Background: Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug among older adults. As an older population grows 
in the United States that has a tolerant attitude toward marijuana use, the dynamics of marijuana use and the 
effects of marijuana on personal, social, and health outcomes among older adults require attention. Objectives: 
This review summarizes epidemiological literature on marijuana use among older adults. Method: A literature 
search was conducted using PubMed, AgeLine, and an online search engine from January 2000 to December 2017, 
resulting in 18 articles. Results: The greatest increase in marijuana use was observed among those in the older adult 
population 50 years or older, and those 65 years or older had the greatest increase in marijuana use in the older 
adult population. Common correlates of marijuana use among those in the older population included being male, 
being unmarried, having multiple chronic diseases, having psychological stress, and using other substances such as 
alcohol, tobacco, other illicit drugs, and prescription drugs. Conclusion: The increased use of marijuana in older 
populations requires surveillance and additional research to understand the use and effects of marijuana in older 
populations to avoid negative health outcomes.

resistance to the Vietnam War draft, introduced youth to 
adult roles. Drug use, including marijuana use, was one 
of the outcomes of these forces and became an additional 
source of stress (Cross & Kleinhesselink, 1985). As Baby 
Boomers grew older, their drug use patterns may have 
persisted.
When asked, most U.S. past-year marijuana users 50 
years or older did not perceive marijuana use as a great 
risk; more than 75% of adults perceived a slight risk or 
no risk in smoking marijuana once or twice a week 
(Choi, DiNitto, Marti, & Choi, 2016). Marijuana use 
seems normalized among the older populations as more 
of those who ever used marijuana age. As laws legaliz-
ing marijuana spread across the United States, and the 
perception of risk associated with marijuana use 
decreases, some in the older adult population may (a) 
continue use, (b) restart marijuana use, or (c) initiate 
marijuana use for the first time. The impact of marijuana 
use on the health and social factors of aging adults is 
largely unknown.
The present review summarizes the available literature 
on marijuana use among older middle-aged adults (50-64 
years old) and older adults (65 years or older), including 
(a) prevalence of marijuana use, (b) patterns of marijuana 
use, and (c) correlates of marijuana use. We then summa-
rize the review and discuss the risks and benefits of mari-
juana, as well as the directions for future research.
Method
A scoping review of the literature was systematically 
conducted using PubMed and AgeLine from January 1, 
2000 to December 8, 2017 (Peters et al., 2015). PubMed 
includes most health science literature, and AgeLine 
contains literature related specifically to the older adult 
population. Literature since the year 2000 was examined 
to obtain the most recent epidemiological studies related 
to marijuana use in older populations in the context of 
marijuana legalization and an increasing older popula-
tion. Search terms included a combination of the follow-
ing: cannabis, medical marijuana, marijuana smoking, 
marijuana abuse, marijuana use, marijuana, hashish, 
blunts, cannabis use, marijuana use, aging, elder*, geri-
atric, older adults, and older adult.
The inclusion criteria for articles in this review 
included (a) epidemiological studies concerning mari-
juana use in the older adult population 50 years or older, 
(b) human subjects, (c) English language, (d) peer-
reviewed publications, and (e) U.S. populations. 
Publications in this review did not include case studies, 
letters to the editor, essays, and perspective papers. The 
initial search resulted in 193 articles from both data-
bases (Figure 1). A review of each published title and 
abstract was completed to select studies that were con-
sistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, result-
ing in the selection of 35 articles from both databases. 
Most articles excluded from the review reported on 
younger samples, were written in non-English 
languages, or were unrelated to marijuana use. Finally, 
the full text of each published article was reviewed. 
Articles without relevant information of marijuana use 
in older U.S. populations or that were nonepidemiologi-
cal publications (i.e., perspective papers, essays) were 
excluded. A total of 10 unduplicated articles were 
obtained from the database search. An Internet search 
was conducted using the search terms to identify addi-
tional articles that were not identified in PubMed and 
AgeLine, resulting in eight additional articles. Overall, 
a total of 18 articles were included in this review (Table 
1). Study findings were synthesized according to their 
ability to inform current scientific knowledge about 
three themes: (a) prevalence of marijuana use, (b) pat-
terns of marijuana use, and (c) correlates of marijuana 
use.
Result
Review of the Literature
The prevalence of marijuana use and associated factors 
and behaviors in the older adult population 50 years 
 
or older was examined in several population-based 
 
studies, including the National Survey on Drug Use and 
 
Health (NSDUH), the National Comorbidity Survey–
Replication (NCS-R), and the National Epidemiologic 
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). 
Additional studies that addressed marijuana use in the 
older adult population analyzed data from the State 
Medical Marijuana Patient Registries, California 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, California 
Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, and the 
Langley Porter Adult Psychiatry Clinic of the University 
of California, San Francisco. The years of data included 
in this review ranged from 2001 to 2014 with sample 
sizes from 154 to 79,402.
Prevalence of Marijuana Use
Marijuana. In comparison with younger age groups, 
fewer people in the older adult population (50+ years 
old) currently use marijuana (Azofeifa et al., 2016; 
Degenhardt, Chiu, Sampson, Kessler, & Anthony, 2007; 
Hasin et al., 2015). Among those in the older adult pop-
ulation, the prevalence of past-year marijuana use 
ranged from 3.9% to 4.8% based on data from the 
NESARC and NSDUH (Choi, DiNitto, & Marti, 2016a). 
Nonetheless, the greatest increase in marijuana use was 
observed in the older adult population (Azofeifa et al., 
2016). From 2006 to 2013, the past-year prevalence of 
marijuana use among those 50 years or older signifi-
cantly increased by 71.4% (Han et al., 2017).
Differences in past-year prevalence were also found 
among age cohorts. Past-year prevalence of marijuana 
use ranged from 5.6% to 9.1% among those 50 to 64 
years old and 1.3% to 2.0% among those 65 years or 
older (Choi et al., 2016a; Han et al., 2017; Salas-Wright 
 Lloyd and Striley 
3
et al., 2017). Trend analysis determined that past-year 
marijuana use among those 50 to 64 years old increased 
10.1% annually, and past-year marijuana use among 
those 65 years or older increased 15.3% annually after 
adjusting for sociodemographic factors, substance use, 
and risk factors (Salas-Wright et al., 2017). Prevalence 
is higher among marijuana users in the 50 to 64 age 
group; however, the largest increase in use has been 
found among those 65 years or older (Han et al., 2017; 
Salas-Wright et al., 2017).
Medical marijuana. There is a paucity of studies exam-
ining marijuana use among older adults. However, 
even fewer studies have examined medical marijuana 
use (MMU) in the older adult population. Medical 
marijuana is used as self-treatment for medical condi-
tions and symptoms that do not improve with tradi-
tional treatment (American College of Physicians 
[ACP], 2008). Choi and colleagues used data from the 
2012-2013 NESARC to determine that marijuana 
users in the older adult population were more likely to 
report marijuana use for medicinal purposes than 
nonmedicinal reasons. Among medical marijuana 
users, 18 years or older, 29.8% of users were adults, 
50 years or older. Adults 50 years or older represented 
16.9% of nonmedical marijuana users (Choi, DiNitto, 
& Marti, 2017a).
In addition to the examination of MMU in a national 
survey, MMU has been investigated in individual states. 
In California, middle-aged (45-64 years old) and older 
adults (65+) had a point prevalence MMU of approxi-
mately 12.0%, resulting in a higher prevalence than the 
youngest age group, 18-24 (9.28%) (Ryan-Ibarra, Induni, 
& Ewing, 2015). Fairman (2016) determined that the pro-
portion of medical marijuana users in the older adult pop-
ulation, 50 years or older, ranged from 34.6% to 50.9% in 
eight U.S. States, including Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, 
Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. 
Adults, 50 years or older, had the highest rates of MMU 
in Alaska (ages 50-59; 4.4/1,000 persons), Arizona (ages 
51-60; 16.8/1,000 persons), Nevada (ages 55-64; 
3.3/1,000 persons), Oregon (ages 60-69; 30.9/1,000 per-
sons), and Vermont (ages 55-64; 5.3/1,000 persons) 
(Fairman, 2016).

Gerontology & Geriatric Medicine
Patterns of marijuana use. Most marijuana users (past-
year users) in the older adult population initiated mari-
juana use before the age of 18; more than 50% of older 
marijuana users may be long-term users (Dinitto & 
Choi, 2011; Han et al., 2017). Older marijuana users 
and past marijuana users had similar initiation dates; 
however, older marijuana users began using the most 
marijuana near age 19, but older past marijuana users 
started using the most marijuana near age 21 (Choi 
et al., 2016a). In addition, older marijuana users also 
used more marijuana (3.19 joints/day) in comparison 
with older past marijuana users (1.90 joints/day) dur-
ing the time of most marijuana use. The average quit 
age of past marijuana users was approximately 32 
years old among those in the older adult population 
(Choi et al., 2016a).
In the older adult population, marijuana was usually 
purchased, received free, or shared with a friend; the 
main source of marijuana was a friend (Dinitto & Choi, 
2011; Han et al., 2017). Older users commonly used 
marijuana at least 100 days out of the year. More than 
26% of older marijuana users reported marijuana use 1 
to 4 times a week, and an average of 1.67 joints per day 
was reported (Choi et al., 2016a). Nearly 55% of older 
marijuana users reported no efforts to decrease mari-
juana use (Dinitto & Choi, 2011).
In addition to marijuana use, the past-year use of 
other substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and 
other illicit drugs, and misuse of prescription drugs 
were more likely to be reported among older mari-
juana users (Choi et al., 2016; Choi, DiNitto, Marti, & 
Choi, 2017; Dinitto & Choi, 2011; Han et al., 2017; 
Salas-Wright et al., 2017). From 2006 to 2013, signifi-
cant increases in alcohol (63.4%) and tobacco (55.8%) 
use were identified among marijuana users in the older 
population (Han et al., 2017). Marijuana use patterns 
were similar between those who used marijuana only 
and those who used marijuana with other illicit drugs 
in regard to marijuana use recency and frequency 
(Choi et al., 2016). Moreover, those who used pain 
relievers nonmedically were more than three times as 
likely to be marijuana users in comparison with those 
who did not use pain relievers nonmedically (Choi, 
DiNitto et al., 2017).
Correlates of marijuana use
Among marijuana users in the older adult population, 
demographics, health characteristics, and social and 
behavioral characteristics play a vital role in the use of 
marijuana. Males were more likely to use marijuana 
than females (Choi et al., 2016a; Dinitto & Choi, 2011; 
Han et al., 2017; Salas-Wright et al., 2017). However, 
the prevalence of marijuana use in females doubled 
from 2006 to 2013 (Han et al., 2017). Moreover, older 
marijuana users were more likely to report being never 
married, divorced, or separated than older nonusers 
(Choi et al., 2016a; Dinitto & Choi, 2011; Han et al., 
2017; Salas-Wright et al., 2017). The race and ethnicity 
of marijuana users differed in epidemiological studies. 
Marijuana users in the older adult population were more 
likely to report being non-Hispanic Black, multiracial, 
or American Indian in comparison with older nonusers 
(Choi et al., 2016a; Dinitto & Choi, 2011; Han et al., 
2017). Salas-Wright and colleagues (2017) determined 
that racial differences existed among marijuana users in 
the older adult population based on age cohorts. 
Marijuana users between the ages of 50 and 64 years 
were more likely to be non-Hispanic White, but mari-
juana users 65 years old or above were more likely to be 
African American (Salas-Wright et al., 2017).
Furthermore, differences in the levels of education 
among older marijuana users exist. Han and colleagues 
(2017) found that older marijuana users reported the 
completion of some college. Choi and colleagues 
(2016) determined that older marijuana users were 
more likely than older past marijuana users to complete 
college. Salas-Wright and colleagues (2017) found dif-
ferences in the educational status of marijuana users 
based on age. Marijuana users 50 to 64 years old com-
pleted some college, and marijuana users 65 years or 
older had less education, including the completion of a 
high school education or lower (Salas-Wright et al., 
2017).
In addition, the physical and mental health of older 
marijuana users differs from older nonusers. Based on 
data from 2006 to 2013, Han and colleagues (2017) 
determined that older marijuana users reported an 
increase in the prevalence of two or more chronic dis-
eases; however, in comparison with older nonusers, 
marijuana users self-reported better health (Dinitto & 
Choi, 2011). Older marijuana users in the sample were 
also younger, which may explain why users reported 
better health. Although better health was reported, 
older marijuana users have reported utilization of the 
emergency department (Choi, Marti, DiNitto, & Choi, 
2017; Schlaerth, Splawn, Ong, & Smith, 2004). In 
contrast to nonusers, marijuana use has been associ-
ated with injury among those in the older adult popu-
lation, and injury has been associated with emergency 
department visits (Choi, Marti, et al., 2017). Injury 
served as a mediator for the increased likelihood of 
emergency department utilization among marijuana 
users.
Additionally, psychological stress was elevated in 
older marijuana users compared with older nonusers 
(Choi et al., 2016; Dinitto & Choi, 2011). Marijuana 
users were more likely to report past-year and lifetime 
depression (Choi et al., 2016a; Choi et al., 2016; Han 
et al., 2017; Salas-Wright et al., 2017). From 2006 to 
2013, past-year depression increased by 100.0% among 
older marijuana users (Han et al., 2017). Choi and 
Colleagues (2016) determined that higher rates of one or 
more of the following past-year and lifetime mental 
health issues were more likely to be reported among 
older marijuana users compared with nonusers, 
 Lloyd and Striley 
9
including major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety 
disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 
bipolar disorder with manic or hypomanic episodes. 
Lifetime suicide attempts were also more likely to occur 
in older marijuana users than older nonusers (Choi et al., 
2016a). The use of marijuana with other drugs can fur-
ther exacerbate psychological distress. Those in the 
older adult population who used marijuana and other 
drugs were significantly more likely than those who did 
not use drugs to have lifetime and past-year major 
depressive episodes and past-year serious suicidal 
thoughts (Choi et al., 2016).
Although past-year mental health treatment increased 
by 73.6% among older marijuana users, mental health 
treatment was less likely to be reported among older 
marijuana users when compared with older nonusers 
(Dinitto & Choi, 2011; Han et al., 2017). Among older 
adults seeking treatment for depression, a high Beck 
Depression Inventory–II score was significantly associ-
ated with past-month marijuana use (Satre, Sterling, 
Mackin, & Weisner, 2011). Furthermore, marijuana and 
other substance use disorders were common among 
older marijuana users in contrast to older nonusers (Choi 
et al., 2016a). The prevalence of cannabis abuse or 
dependence was approximately 6.9% (Han et al., 2017). 
Medical marijuana users were more likely than nonmed-
ical marijuana users to have a cannabis use disorder 
(Choi et al., 2017a). A larger proportion of older mari-
juana users than nonusers also reported lifetime alcohol 
and drug treatment (Choi et al., 2016a).
Four studies were identified that examined differing 
social and behavioral factors among older marijuana 
users and nonusers. Family members of marijuana users, 
including biological parents, siblings, and offspring, 
were more likely to use drugs than older nonusers (Choi 
et al., 2016a). Moreover, marijuana use in the older pop-
ulation was associated with life stressors (i.e., trouble 
with family and personal relationships, personal or fam-
ily trouble with the police or law, debt, homelessness, 
and theft or property destruction victimization) and 
decreased appraisal, belonging, and tangible social sup-
port (Choi, DiNitto, & Marti, 2016b). Salas-Wright and 
colleagues (2017) found that marijuana users 50 to 64 
years old were more likely to participate in risky activi-
ties, including driving while intoxicated, selling drugs, 
theft, and attacking to harm in comparison with older 
nonusers. In contrast, marijuana users 65 years or older 
were more likely to drive while intoxicated but were not 
involved in other risky activities. In addition, Choi and 
colleagues also found that older marijuana users were 
more likely to drive under the influence (DUI) in com-
parison with older nonusers (Choi, DiNitto, & Marti, 
2016c, 2017b). Among adults 50 years or older, mari-
juana users were more likely to be involved in the crimi-
nal justice system in the past year. However, as the 
prevalence of marijuana increased and the perception of 
risk-associated marijuana use decreased, the relation-
ship between marijuana use and risky behaviors (i.e., 
other illicit drug use, involvement in the criminal justice 
system) weakened (Salas-Wright et al., 2017).
Discussion
Summary of Review
This review summarized the peer-reviewed published 
literature on marijuana use in the older adult population 
50 years or older, including the prevalence of marijuana 
use, patterns of marijuana use, and correlates of mari-
juana use. The greatest increase in marijuana use was 
observed among those in the older adult population 50 
years or older, and those 65 years or older had the great-
est increase in marijuana use among all older users. A 
larger proportion of adults in the older adult population 
used marijuana medicinally in contrast to recreational 
use; MMU differed from state to state among older mar-
ijuana users. In addition, older marijuana users were 
more likely to initiate marijuana use before the age of 
18, and it is possible that some in the older adult popula-
tion have continued marijuana use since then. Common 
correlates of marijuana use among those in the older 
adult population included factors such as being male, 
being unmarried, having multiple chronic diseases, and 
having psychological stress; findings for factors such as 
race and education level varied in the reviewed studies. 
Marijuana use was also reported with the use of other 
substances and drugs, including alcohol, tobacco, other 
illicit drugs, and misused prescription drugs. The major-
ity of older marijuana users reported no efforts to 
decrease marijuana use. For many, marijuana use may 
continue even as older ages are reached.
Marijuana Benefits and Risks
As marijuana use becomes more prevalent in the United 
States, evidence is gradually revealing negative 
 
marijuana-associated outcomes involving both medicinal 
and recreational marijuana use. As the legalization of 
medicinal and recreational marijuana increases in the 
United States, the percentage of older marijuana users may 
increase, including both aging lifetime marijuana users 
and new users. A larger percentage of older marijuana 
users reported MMU than recreational marijuana use 
(Choi, DiNitto et al., 2017). Common reasons for medici-
nal marijuana use include pain, anxiety, loss of appetite or 
weight loss, depression, and insomnia (Hazekamp, Ware, 
Muller-Vahl, Abrams, & Grotenhermen, 2013).
Lau and colleagues (2015) conducted a qualitative 
study among Baby Boomers and determined that mari-
juana users perceived marijuana as having less adverse 
effects, a lower risk for addiction, and better effective-
ness for treating symptoms of medical conditions. 
Marijuana has been described as a safer alternative to 
substances and drugs such as alcohol, other illicit drugs, 
and prescription drugs (Lau et al., 2015). It has even 
 10 
Gerontology & Geriatric Medicine
been suggested that marijuana use may reduce the use of 
opioids (Boehnke, Litinas, & Clauw, 2016). As the 
United States battles an opioid epidemic, marijuana use 
may help reduce the loss of life, but a complete picture 
of the outcomes associated with marijuana use among 
older populations has yet to be elucidated.
Although marijuana may have medicinal properties, 
additional research is needed to understand its effects 
among older users. A clinical review found that only a 
few conditions have high-quality evidence to support the 
use of medical marijuana, including chronic pain, neuro-
pathic pain, and spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (Hill, 
2015). A review of the efficacy and safety of medical can-
nabinoids, such as psychoactive ingredients in marijuana 
like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in older subjects found 
that adverse events were common among those who used 
medical cannabinoids in contrast to controls (Ameri, 
1999; van den Elsen et al., 2014). Currently, there is not 
enough evidence to corroborate the safety of marijuana 
use and the effectiveness of marijuana use for many medi-
cal conditions (Hill, 2015; van den Elsen et al., 2014).
Along with the potential benefits of marijuana use, the 
negative health outcomes associated with marijuana use 
in the older adult population should be considered by 
users and potential users. First, medical marijuana has 
been legalized without testing for efficacy and safety as 
required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA; 
“The Compassionate Use Act of 1996: The Medical 
Marijuana Initiative,” 2011). There are only two cannabi-
noids approved by the FDA, including dronabinol and 
nabilone (FDA, 2006a, 2006b, 2017; National Institute 
on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2017). Dronabinol is marketed 
as Marinol and Syndros, which are used to treat anorexia-
associated weight loss in patients with acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and nausea and vomiting 
associated with chemotherapy in cancer patients (FDA, 
2006b, 2017). Nabilone is marketed as Cesamet, which 
is used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with che-
motherapy (FDA, 2006a). Second, older adults experi-
ence many changes associated with aging that increase 
susceptibility to adverse events associated with any drug. 
For example, physiological changes result in differences 
in pharmacokinetics, leading to increased drug serum 
levels (Dowling, Weiss, & Condon, 2008). However, a 
thorough scope of age-related changes in adults is beyond 
the scope of this review. The potency of THC varies and 
may increase the likelihood of experiencing adverse 
events (Ge, Zhang, & Zuo, 2014). A wide range of THC 
has been found in marijuana sold illegally, ranging from 
3% to 29% (Mehmedic et al., 2010). There is no evidence 
base to determine the appropriate strains and dosage of 
marijuana to use, even for medical marijuana users 
(Borgelt, Franson, Nussbaum, & Wang, 2013).
Marijuana use can negatively affect the health of 
those in the older adult population beyond abuse and 
dependence. Marijuana use has been associated with 
injury (Asbridge et al., 2014; Blows et al., 2005; Choi, 
Marti, et al., 2017; Wettlaufer et al., 2017), mental health 
problems (Choi et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2016a; Hall & 
Degenhardt, 2009; Manrique-Garcia et al., 2012), car-
diovascular disease (Alshaarawy & Elbaz, 2016; 
Hackam, 2015; Hemachandra, McKetin, Cherbuin, & 
Anstey, 2016; Lindsay, Foale, Warren, & Henry, 2005; 
Reece, Norman, & Hulse, 2016), respiratory problems 
(Howden & Naughton, 2011; Macleod et al., 2015; 
Martinasek, McGrogan, & Maysonet, 2016; Moore, 
Augustson, Moser, & Budney, 2005), metabolic syn-
drome (B. A. Yankey, Rothenberg, Strasser, White, & 
Okosun, 2017; B. N. Yankey, Strasser, & Okosun, 2016), 
cancer (Aldington et al.,2008a, 2008b; Zhang et al., 
1999), unhealthy diet (Foltin, Fischman, & Byrne, 1988; 
Smit & Crespo, 2001), and drug–drug interactions 
(Lasota, 2015; Mahvan et al., 2017). In addition, the use 
of marijuana with other substances, including prescrip-
tion drugs, tobacco, alcohol, and other illicit substances, 
may exacerbate the negative effects of marijuana use in 
aging bodies. A thorough scope of all negative health 
outcomes associated with marijuana use is beyond the 
scope of this review. However, some areas of concern 
among older adults will be discussed, including 
unhealthy diets, injuries, and mental health problems.
A healthy diet is an important prevention factor in the 
fight against disease. Aging increases the risk of one or 
more chronic diseases and degenerative diseases (Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). 
Therefore, marijuana may be used for medicinal pur-
poses. Marijuana use stimulates the appetite, and mari-
juana users have a higher intake of energy and nutrients 
than nonusers (Foltin et al., 1988; Smit & Crespo, 2001). 
Smit and Crespo (2001) found that marijuana users 20-59 
years old self-reported a higher intake of alcohol, sodium, 
pork, cheese, and salty snacks, but fewer fruits and veg-
etable than nonusers. Although the nutritional status of 
the marijuana users and nonusers did not differ, the long-
term effects of diet among marijuana users are unknown. 
The stimulation of appetite for patients with HIV/AIDS 
and cancer may be beneficial, but it could be life- 
threatening for someone with diseases such as diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease, where a healthy diet may be 
vital to improved health outcomes.
Moreover, marijuana use can increase the risk of injury 
among those in the older adult population. Choi and col-
leagues (2017) determined that marijuana use increased 
injury among older marijuana users, and injury was a 
mediator for the utilization of the emergency department. 
Older marijuana users may be at an increased risk of 
vehicular accidents and falls; however, studies that 
address injuries related to marijuana use among those in 
the older adult population are scarce. Previous studies 
have found that marijuana use increased the risk of vehic-
ular accidents (Asbridge et al., 2014; Blows et al., 2005; 
Wettlaufer et al., 2017). As the aging process occurs, cog-
nitive processing speed and visual skills decrease (Eckert, 
Keren, Roberts, Calhoun, & Harris, 2010; Harada, 
Natelson Love, & Triebel, 2013). A combination of the 
effects of marijuana, including sedation, and cognitive 
 Lloyd and Striley 
11
changes in older marijuana users can have deleterious 
consequences for older drivers. Vehicular accidents not 
only cause harm to human life but can also result in high 
costs due to health care utilization and property damage 
(Wettlaufer et al., 2017). Furthermore, those in the older 
adult population are at risk of falls, and the use of drugs 
may increase the risk of falls. Most research regarding 
drug use and falls have focused on prescription drugs, not 
marijuana use (Musich, Wang, Ruiz, Hawkins, & Wicker, 
2017).
In addition, mental health problems have been asso-
ciated with marijuana use. Marijuana use is strongly 
associated with depression (Choi et al., 2016a; Choi 
et al., 2016) and schizophrenia (Hall & Degenhardt, 
2009; Manrique-Garcia et al., 2012). Current and life-
time older marijuana users were more likely to report 
past-year and lifetime mental disorders in contrast to 
those who never used marijuana (Choi et al., 2016a). 
Choi and colleagues (2016a) found that lifetime mari-
juana users were more likely to report past-year MDD, 
anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol 
use disorder, and tobacco or nicotine use disorder in 
comparison with those who never used marijuana. 
Current marijuana users were more likely to have past-
year other drug use disorders, alcohol use disorders, and 
tobacco or nicotine use disorder in comparison with life-
time marijuana users (Choi et al., 2016a). Marijuana use 
is significantly associated with substance use disorders 
among current marijuana users (Blanco et al., 2016; 
Choi et al., 2016a). In addition, among patients seeking 
treatment for mental health and substance use problems, 
marijuana use may negatively affect recovery (Bahorik 
et al., 2018; Bahorik et al., 2017).
Directions for Future Research
The paucity of research examining marijuana use in the 
older adult population leaves many questions unan-
swered. Additional research is needed to learn about 
marijuana use in the older adult population. The increas-
ing use of marijuana is an issue that requires surveil-
lance and scientific investigation of marijuana use and 
related behaviors, including (a) trends in marijuana use 
as legalization increases, (b) motivations and opportuni-
ties to initiate and continue marijuana use, (c) differ-
ences in MMU versus non-MMU, (d) prevalence of 
marijuana use among institutionalized older adults (i.e., 
correctional facilities, nursing homes), and (d) real and 
perceived health and social outcomes related to mari-
juana use. Biological indicators are also needed to con-
firm marijuana use, because underreporting of drug use 
is common in the older adult population (Rockett, 
Putnam, Jia, & Smith, 2006).
Limitations and Strengths
This review has limitations that should be noted. First, 
this 
review 
examined 
the 
scope 
of 
available 
epidemiologic literature; the quality and the differences 
in measurements, variables, and methods included in the 
studies were not assessed. Second, only peer-reviewed, 
published literature was included in the review. The gray 
literature was not examined to identify unpublished 
studies. Nonetheless, this review has strengths. PubMed 
and AgeLine databases were utilized to systemically 
identify studies that met the inclusion criteria of the 
review. In addition, an Internet search was used to iden-
tify other studies that were not identified in the PubMed 
and AgeLine databases. This review investigates a 
timely topic as the aging population increases and the 
legalization and use of marijuana increase in the United 
States.
