Abstract
Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate in many vertebrate tissues with age and contribute to age-
related pathologies1–3, presumably through their secretion of factors contributing to the 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)4–6. Removal of SnCs delays several 
pathologies7–9 and increases healthy lifespan8. Aging and trauma are risk factors for the 
development of osteoarthritis (OA)10, a chronic disease characterized by degeneration of articular 
cartilage leading to pain and physical disability. Senescent chondrocytes are found in cartilage

 tissue isolated from patients undergoing joint replacement surgery11–14, yet their role in disease 
pathogenesis is unknown. To test the idea that SnCs might play a causative role in OA, we used the 
p16-3MR transgenic mouse, which harbors a p16INK4a (Cdkn2a) promoter driving the expression 
of a fusion protein containing synthetic Renilla luciferase and monomeric red fluorescent protein 
domains, as well as a truncated form of herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)15,16. 
This mouse strain allowed us to selectively follow and remove SnCs after anterior cruciate 
ligament transection (ACLT). We found that SnCs accumulated in the articular cartilage and 
synovium after ACLT, and selective elimination of these cells attenuated the development of post-
traumatic OA, reduced pain and increased cartilage development. Intra-articular injection of a 
senolytic molecule that selectively killed SnCs validated these results in transgenic, non-transgenic 
and aged mice. Selective removal of the SnCs from in vitro cultures of chondrocytes isolated from 
patients with OA undergoing total knee replacement decreased expression of senescent and 
inflammatory markers while also increasing expression of cartilage tissue extracellular matrix 
proteins. Collectively, these findings support the use of SnCs as a therapeutic target for treating 
degenerative joint disease.
To test whether SnCs contribute to OA pathogenesis, we first asked whether SnCs develop 
after articular joint injury in mice by following the expression of p16INK4a (also known as 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a; encoded by the Cdkn2a locus), a frequently used 
biomarker for SnCs8,17–19. We induced post-traumatic OA by ACLT in p16-3MR transgenic 
mice, in which p16INK4a-positive SnCs can be noninvasively monitored15,16 (Supplementary 
Fig. 1a). Luminescence in the articular joint region of the p16-3MR mice increased after 
ACLT surgery (Fig. 1a,b), peaking 2 weeks after injury and decreasing thereafter to a low-
level steady state that remained above the background level (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The 
mRNA level of Cdkn2a increased and then decreased with kinetics similar to those of the 
luminescence (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1c). The mRNA levels of Cdkn1a and Il6, 
encoding the SASP marker IL-6 (ref. 20), were also higher in vehicle-treated ACLT mice 
than in sham-operated controls 28 d after ACLT, further corroborating the development of 
SnCs in the injured joint (Supplementary Fig. 1d). OA disease and cartilage degeneration 
after ACLT were confirmed histologically and through pain assessment. ACLT-mediated 
injury reduced safranin O staining of proteoglycans and resulted in cartilage thinning, 
surface irregularities and induction of type II collagen degradation (Supplementary Fig. 
1e,f). Behavioral assessment of OA-induced pain showed that ACLT surgery caused 
decreased weight bearing on the injured leg and an increased latency period required for the 
injured hindlimb to reach a pain threshold after the mouse was placed on a 55 °C platform 
(Supplementary Fig. 1g).
To localize SnCs in the articular joint, we performed immunostaining for p16INK4a protein 
and high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1)—an extracellular alarmin whose nuclear 
expression precedes the secretion of SASP components in cells undergoing senescence21,22. 
In vehicle-treated ACLT mice, p16INK4a protein was largely restricted to the superficial 
zone, where 66% of cells were positive for p16INK4a, and 65% of cells had little to no 
nuclear HMGB1 staining in articular cartilage (Fig. 1e,f). In contrast, in sham-operated 
controls, there were fewer cells positive for p16INK4a staining and HMGB1 was largely 
nuclear. We found that vehicle-treated p16-3MR ACLT mice, when compared to mice

 without ACLT surgery, had a greater number of p16INK4a-expressing cells in the synovium, 
as well as at the cartilage surface. However, there was no difference in p16INK4a-expressing 
SnCs in infrapatellar fat pads between the two groups (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The role of 
the synovium in OA has long been postulated23, and our results suggest that the synovium 
also contributes to the senescence burden in articular joints during OA progression. SnC 
localization to the superficial layer of cartilage has particular relevance for tissue 
regeneration, as this is where purported cartilage progenitor cells are located24. Furthermore, 
the superficial and deep cartilage layers interact to maintain homeostasis and increase new 
tissue production when needed25, further indicating a regulatory role for these superficial 
layer cell populations that express p16INK4a.
Next, we sought to determine whether selective removal of the SnCs that develop after 
ACLT would reduce or reverse the progression of OA and OA-related symptoms. To do this, 
we took advantage of the p16-3MR transgene, which includes HSV-TK, thereby permitting 
the selective killing of p16INK4a-expressing cells by ganciclovir (GCV)26. GCV treatment 
(Fig. 1a) reduced luminescence in the ACLT mice (Fig. 1b), indicative of the clearing of 
p16INK4a-positive SnCs. Clearance was confirmed by reduced injury-induced increases in 
the mRNA levels of Cdkn2a and Cdkn1a (Fig. 1c,d), along with increased immunostaining 
for nuclear HMGB1 and reduced p16INK4a protein in the cartilage (Fig. 1e,f). We also 
observed a reduction in p16INK4a expression in the synovium of GCV-treated p16-3MR mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Clearance of SnCs inhibited articular cartilage erosion such that 
proteoglycan staining was largely rescued and resembled that of normal tissue (Fig. 1e,g). 
The pain associated with ACLT injury was decreased when SnCs were removed (Fig. 1h), 
and the inflammatory markers matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) and Il-1β (Il1b) (Fig. 
1d), whose expression is typical of OA disease and tissue degradation27, also showed 
decreased mRNA levels. SnC removal increased the protein and mRNA levels of Col2a1 and 
Acan (corresponding to the cartilage extracellular matrix molecules type II collagen and 
aggrecan, respectively). The expression of Sox9, which regulates chondrogenesis in addition 
to having other activities, remained unchanged. However, there were pathological changes in 
the structure and/or appearance of the subchondral bone and the expression of bone-
resorption-related genes28 was increased after ACLT surgery and OA development; these 
phenotypes were not rescued by GCV treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2b–d), suggesting that 
GCV may not reach the bone when injected intra-articularly and that systemic 
administration may be required16. To confirm that GCV itself did not affect the local 
cartilage environment but only killed SnCs in p16-3MR mice, we injected GCV into the 
ACLT-treated joints of nontransgenic C57BL mice, where it was found to have no influence 
on OA disease progression or pain (Supplementary Fig. 1). Together, these data suggest that 
SnCs develop after trauma in the articular cartilage and synovium of the knee joint and their 
removal, even after OA and symptoms develop, reduces disease impact and creates a 
prochondrogenic environment.
To selectively clear SnCs using a pharmacologic approach, we tested a senolytic (UBX0101) 
that was recently found to selectively eliminate SnCs16,29. First, we optimized the 
concentration of UBX0101 using p16-3MR mice and an injection regimen similar to that 
used to administer GCV. The development of SnCs was followed by luminescence to 
compare the efficacy of UBX0101 in clearing SnCs with that of GCV. An intra-articular

 injection with as little as 0.2 mM UBX0101 14 d after ACLT effectively cleared the SnCs 
induced by the surgery. The luciferase signal decreased after UBX0101 treatment 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a), and SnC clearance was confirmed by reduced expression of 
Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a, Mmp13 and Il1b (up to a 50% reduction) in UBX0101-treated ACLT mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). The OA-related disease outcomes of pain and articular cartilage 
erosion were similarly reduced with UBX0101 (Supplementary Fig. 3c–e). Proteoglycan 
loss and the thinning and calcification of articular cartilage were attenuated in ACLT mice 
treated with 1 mM UBX0101. Moreover, injection of 0.2 to 5 mM UBX0101 also produced 
a prochondrogenic environment characterized by greater Col2a1 and Acan gene expression, 
indicating new cartilage growth. The expression of Sox9 and Runx2, a regulator of 
chondrocyte hypertrophy and bone development30, remained unchanged after treatment 
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). Similar to the GCV response in p16-3MR mice, abnormal 
subchondral bone remodeling and osteophyte formation in ACLT mice were not rescued by 
UBX0101 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3f).
The half-life of UBX0101 in the articular joint was short, with concentrations falling below 
the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) after 1.5 h. Systemic exposure was minimal 
(3.3% of the intra-articular dose reached the circulation), and the IC50 was never reached 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Even with this short half-life in the joint cavity, UBX0101 was 
effective in blocking cartilage erosion in our ACLT mouse model because UBX0101 
eliminated SnCs rather than blocking their SASP secretion. Once cells have been eliminated, 
drug exposure is no longer necessary. Considering therapeutic translation, we next aimed to 
reduce the number of intra-articular injections while still achieving successful SnC removal. 
We thus determined the number of UBX0101 injections (one injection every 2 d) required to 
reduce OA progression when injections were begun 14 d after ACLT surgery 
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Both five and six injections of 1 mM UBX0101 resulted in lower 
expression of Cdkn2a, Mmp13 and Il1b, higher expression of Col2a1 and Acan, and less 
OA-induced pain in comparison to vehicle-treated ACLT mice.
We next confirmed the efficacy of intra-articular UBX0101 injections for treating ACLT-
induced OA in C57BL mice. On the basis of the short half-life of the drug in the articular 
space and the dosing experiments, six intra-articular injections (1 mM, once every 2 d over 2 
weeks starting on day 14 after ACLT) were performed (Fig. 2a). Similar to the effects of 
GCV in p16-3MR mice, UBX0101 treatment selectively killed SnCs that were induced by 
ACLT surgery in articular cartilage. This SnC clearance was confirmed by (i) a reduced 
number of cells without nuclear HMGB1 and higher numbers of non-SnCs positive for 
nuclear HMGB1 (Fig. 2b,c); (ii) a higher number of non-SnCs expressing, Ki-67 and 
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Fig. 6a); (iii) fewer 
p16INK4a- and MMP13-positive chondrocytes (Fig. 2b,c); and (iv) reduced levels of Cdkn2a, 
Cdkn1a, Il6 and Mmp13 mRNAs 28 d after injury (Fig. 2d). We also observed fewer Ki-67-
expressing cells in the synovium of vehicle-treated C57BL mice, a finding consistent with 
the presence of synovial SnCs, which was abrogated by UBX0101 treatment 
(Supplementary Fig. 6b). This correlates with the reduction in expression of p16INK4a 
observed in the synovium of GCV-treated p16-3MR mice.

 The long-term durability of a single UBX0101 treatment course and its ability to attenuate 
articular cartilage degeneration and ameliorate OA symptoms were evaluated over 84 d (Fig. 
2c–f and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Reduction of proteoglycan and OA-related pain was 
maintained between 28 and 56 d after surgery and the gene and protein levels of the 
prochondrogenic factors Col2a1 and Acan remained upregulated in comparison to the 
untreated controls (Supplementary Figs. 7a and 8a–d). Subchondral bone alterations induced 
by ACLT surgery did not change over the 84-d study (Supplementary Figs. 7b–d and 8d,e). 
However, OA disease (cartilage degradation and subchondral bone sclerosis) and OA-
induced pain returned at 84 d after ACLT or 4 weeks after the last drug injection 
(Supplementary Fig. 8b,c,e), suggesting that SnCs may return by week 12 after ACLT. In 
mouse ACLT surgery, the ligament cannot be repaired, so continued damage may occur in 
the joint in addition to age-related accumulation of SnCs over time. Thus, repeated treatment 
may be required to remove SnCs that accumulate owing to injury and aging to prevent 
disease development and to achieve long-term disease modification.
To test the potential of UBX0101 in treating later-stage disease, we injected the drug into 
mice 42 d after ACLT (Supplementary Fig. 9a). After the standard intra-articular injections 
over 2 weeks, UBX0101 treatment increased the number of non-SnCs with nuclear HMGB1 
(Supplementary Fig. 9b), reduced OA-induced pain (Supplementary Fig. 9c) and reduced the 
levels of Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a and Mmp13 mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 9d). Further, the 
expression of chon-drogenic genes (Col2a1 and Acan) and proteoglycan staining in articular 
cartilage increased even with the late UBX0101 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 9d,e). ACLT 
mice treated with UBX0101 had a reduction in subchondral bone sclerosis but similar 
osteophyte formation relative to vehicle-treated controls (Supplementary Fig. 9f). Together, 
these results indicate that UBX0101 can clear SnCs from articular cartilage to reduce OA 
symptoms and modify the disease by creating a pro-regenerative environment even in later-
stage disease.
Aging in mice contributes to the development of spontaneous and injury-induced OA, 
similar to what occurs in humans31,32. We therefore explored the consequences of selective 
removal of naturally occurring age-related SnCs on arthritis development using the 
previously reported INK-ATTAC transgenic mouse model, which expresses the FK506 
binding protein–caspase-8 fusion protein under the control of the p16INK4a promoter7,8. 
Starting at 12 months of age, AP20187, a molecule that induces apoptosis in p16INK4a-
expressing cells8, was injected intraperitoneally into female mice twice a week until animals 
became moribund. In the articular joints of these mice, elimination of naturally occurring 
p16INK4a-positive SnCs markedly reduced age-related cartilage degeneration in comparison 
to vehicle treatment alone, as demonstrated by increased safranin O staining for 
proteoglycans, cartilage thickness and normalized Osteoarthritis Research Society 
International (OARSI) scores (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 10a).
The synergistic impact of age and trauma may further exacerbate disease. To address this 
possibility, we performed ACLT surgery on p16-3MR mice aged 19 months and evaluated 
the effect of selective SnC removal on OA disease. In contrast with young animals, 
luminescence in the articular joint region of vehicle-treated aged p16-3MR mice increased 
continually over 28 d after ACLT surgery (Fig. 3d). This SnC development in ACLT mice

 was corroborated by higher mRNA levels of Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a and the SASP factor Il1b and 
fewer of Ki-67-positive non-SnCs as compared to controls that did not undergo surgery (Fig. 
3e and Supplementary Fig. 10b). Moreover, the distribution of the SnCs in aged mice after 
ACLT was different from that in young mice after ACLT. In particular, 40% of p16INK4a-
positive SnCs were localized throughout the articular cartilage of vehicle-treated ACLT mice 
instead of only in the superficial layer (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 10b).
More severe OA developed after ACLT surgery in aged than in young p16-3MR mice, as 
demonstrated by histology and OARSI scoring of vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 3f,g). The 
baseline morphology of the aged animals without surgery showed thinning cartilage with 
reduced safranin O staining for proteoglycans and higher OARSI scores. Removal of SnCs 
from aged p16-3MR animals using the standard regimen of UBX0101 (Fig. 2a) reduced OA-
induced pain, similar to what was observed in young mice (Fig. 3h). Furthermore, 
expression of Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a, Il6 and Mmp13 was reduced with SnC clearance. Moreover, 
Cdkn1a and Mmp13 gene expression levels in ACLT mice treated with UBX0101 were 
lower than those in animals that did not receive any surgery, suggesting that there were 
higher baseline levels of SnCs in the aged mice (Fig. 3e). However, in contrast with the 
young animals, there was not higher expression of prochondrogenic genes (Col2a1 and 
Acan) in the older animals after treatment at 28 d (Fig. 3e). Histologically, there was a small 
increase in safranin O staining of the articular cartilage in ACLT mice treated with 
UBX0101, but the OARSI scores were not significantly lower than those of the vehicle-
treated ACLT mice, given the small number of animals in this study (Fig. 3f,g). ACLT- and 
age-induced changes in bone did not significantly change with UBX0101 treatment 
(Supplementary Fig. 10c,d). However, SnCs found in the synovium were cleared with 
UBX0101 treatment, and those in the subchondral bone marrow were slightly reduced in 
number (Supplementary Fig. 10e). These findings suggest that UBX0101 can clear SnCs 
from aged articular cartilage, but the age-related decline in the proliferative and synthetic 
capacities of articular chondrocytes may reduce subsequent tissue regeneration33. However, 
based on the drastic articular joint improvement, in terms of OARSI scores, in the older 
animals with naturally occurring OA, it is likely that additional treatments, and potentially 
systemic treatment, might be required to reduce disease and rebuild cartilage tissue.
The relevance of SnCs and their clearance in clinical OA was evaluated in explant and in 
vitro cultures from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. To validate the presence of 
SnCs in human disease tissues, we performed senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-
gal) staining and HMGB1 immunohistochemistry on arthritic and healthy human cartilage 
explants. SA-β-gal-positive SnCs were observed throughout the depth of osteoarthritic 
cartilage, and there was little to no difference in nuclear HMGB1 staining in OA tissues as 
compared to tissues from healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, staining was 
variable in cartilage tissue isolated from different regions of the joint within an individual, 
suggesting variability across the articular surface. To avoid bias from this variability in SnCs 
across the articular joint, we isolated cells from the tissue for further testing.
Exposure to the senolytic UBX0101 effectively cleared SnCs isolated from human OA 
cartilage grown in culture as a monolayer. Preliminary screening showed that treatment with 
43 μM UBX0101 killed senescent chondrocytes isolated from human OA tissue, as

 determined by the SA-β-gal assay (Supplementary Fig. 12). To further understand the effects 
of UBX0101 on OA, human OA chondrocytes were exposed to UBX0101 (43 μM) for 2 d 
(Fig. 4a); this regimen killed 20% of the SnCs and no more than 5% of non-SnCs, as 
determined by staining for SA-β-gal activity and nuclear HMGB1, Annexin V–propidium 
iodide (PI) live–dead cell staining, and the protein levels of p21 (Fig. 4b,c and 
Supplementary Fig. 12d). Increased levels of activated caspase-3 suggest that UBX0101 
kills SnCs through the apoptotic pathway in treated human OA chondrocytes (but not 
healthy chondrocytes; Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 12e). After human OA chondrocytes 
were exposed to UBX0101 for 2 d followed by drug-free culture for 8 d, the cultures showed 
a decline in expression of the senescence-related genes CDKN2A (without statistical 
significance), MMP3 and IL6. Expression levels of the OA-related genes MMP13 and IL1B 
were also decreased (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, selective removal of SnCs from the OA 
chondrocyte cultures by UBX0101 increased the proliferation rate of the remaining 
chondrocytes by up to 15%, as determined by labeling of individual cells with 5-ethynyl-20-
deoxyuridine (EdU) (Fig. 4f). These data suggest that transient UBX0101 treatment may 
cause a reversible cessation of cell growth (quiescence) in normal cells, which resume 
proliferation after removal of UBX0101.
We next evaluated UBX0101 treatment of human OA chondrocytes in a 3D pellet culture 
system that supports maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype and chondrogenesis. After 
21 d of growth in culture, human OA chondrocyte pellet cultures that were then transiently 
exposed to 43 μM UBX0101 for 4 d had dramatically reduced levels of SnCs (Fig. 4g), as 
determined by reduced SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 4h). UBX0101 also reduced CDKN2A, 
MMP3, IL1B and IL6 mRNA levels and increased COL2A1 and ACAN mRNA levels (Fig. 
4i). Similarly, UBX0101 decreased p16INK4a and MMP13 protein levels and increased the 
levels of COL2A1, proteoglycan and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs), confirming 
new cartilage growth (Fig. 4i,j).
In summary, we report the development of SnCs after articular joint injury in the superficial 
layer of cartilage and the synovium in mice. These cells express a SASP that includes 
inflammatory molecules and degradative enzymes. The removal of SnCs, through transgenic 
mouse models or pharmaceutical intervention, reduced the development of post-traumatic 
OA and related pain and created a prochondrogenic environment. Aged mice had a higher 
senescence burden and developed more severe OA after injury. The relevance of our findings 
to human disease was validated using chondrocytes isolated from arthritic patients. These 
findings provide new insights into therapies targeting SnCs for the treatment of trauma and 
age-related degenerative joint disease.

Mice generation and drug treatment
We purchased young (aged 10 weeks) male C57BL mice from Charles River (Germantown, 
MD, USA). p16-3MR transgenic mice (a C57BL/6J strain) were generated as previously 
described15 and were bred in the animal facility of the Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine. All studies described using INK-ATTAC mice (a C57BL/6J strain) were 
performed and the mice were generated as previously described8. The experimental protocol 
was approved by and performed in accordance with protocols from the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins University and the Mayo Clinic Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions 
with five or fewer mice per cage. Mice had free access to food and water. The mice used for 
all experiments were randomly assigned to control or treatment groups and to those used in 
OA evaluation. For drug treatments, p16-3MR and normal C57BL mice were injected intra-
articularly with 1 or 2 mM GCV (Sigma-Aldrich, G2036) in 10 μl of saline or 0.2, 1 or 5 
mM UBX0101 in 10 μl of saline. INK-ATTAC mice were intraperitoneally administrated 2.0 
μg of AP20187 (B/B homodimerizer; Clontech) per gram bodyweight or vehicle from 12 
months until the end of life.
Cell isolation and culture
Human articular cartilage samples explanted from patients with OA undergoing total knee 
arthroplasty were received from the National Disease Resource Institution (Philadelphia, PA, 
USA) according to an IRB-approved protocol. Patients in the registry in NDRI (National 
Disease Research Interchange) gave informed consent for the donation of organs and tissues 
for research and education. Cartilage tissue was cut into 1 mm3 pieces, washed three times 
with PBS supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Pen/Strep; 
Invitrogen, 15140-122) and digested on an orbital shaker for 16 h at 37 °C with 0.17% (w/v) 
type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical, 4176) in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco, 
11965-092) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, SH30070.03). After digestion, the 
filtrate was passed through a 70-μm strainer, and cells were rinsed three times with DMEM 
supplemented with 1% Pen/Strep and 10% FBS. For 3D pellet culture of human OA 
chondrocytes34, 400,000 cells were seeded in 96-well MicroWell round-bottom plates 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pellets were formed in the bottom by centrifugation at 150g for 
10 min. The human OA chondrocyte pellets were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in 200 
μl of chondrocyte growth medium consisting of high-glucose DMEM, 1% Pen/Strep, 10% 
FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco, 11140-050), 1 M HEPES (Gibco, 
15630-080), 100 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360-070), 0.2 M l-proline (Sigma, P5607) 
and 25 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma, A5960). Pellets were harvested after 21 d for 
evaluation. Media were changed three times per week until the end of the experiment.
Surgically induced OA mouse model
Anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and sham surgery were performed on male 
p16-3MR mice aged 10 weeks or 19 months and male C57BL mice aged 10 weeks. Animals 
were placed under general anesthesia with 3% isoflurane, and hindlimbs were shaved and 
prepared for aseptic surgery. For the sham operation, the knee joint was exposed following a

 medial capsular incision, which cut the patellar tendon, and the surgical skin incision was 
closed with sutures. For the ACLT surgery, after opening the joint capsule, the ACL was 
transected with microscissors under a surgical microscope. After irrigation with saline to 
remove tissue debris, the skin incision was closed. All procedures were performed according 
to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns 
Hopkins University School of Medicine. On week 4, 8 or 12, the mice were euthanized and 
the joint was collected for mRNA quantification and histological assessment of the medial 
tibial plateau joint through blinded graded observations by two observers who followed the 
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system35.
Bioluminescence
For in vivo luminescence imaging, male p16-3MR mice aged 10 weeks or 19 months were 
injected intra-articularly with 10 μl (150 μg/ml) of Xenolight RediJect Coelenterazine h 
(Calipers). Twenty-five minutes later, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and 
luminescence was measured with a PerkinElmer IVIS SpectrumCT in vivo imaging system 
(Caliper Life Sciences; 5 min, medium binning).
Real-time RT–PCR
To extract RNA, the hindlimbs that underwent surgery and no-surgery controls were 
dissected and immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen and were then pulverized with a 
mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted from knee joints using TRIzol and was reverse 
transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer’s 
protocol (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR for Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a, Il1b, Mmp3, Mmp13, Col2a1, 
Acan, Sox9, Runx2, Tnfrsf11b (Opg), Bglap, Rankl and Ctsk was performed using the 
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied 
Biosystems by Life Technologies, 4367659). All signals were normalized to that for Actb. 
Relative gene expression was calculated by the ∆∆CT method, in which ∆CT was calculated 
using the Actb reference gene. ∆∆CT was calculated relative to the unoperated control group 
in the in vivo studies and relative to control samples in the in vitro studies. See 
Supplementary Table 1 for a list of primers.
Hotplate analysis
Mice were placed on the hotplate analgesia meter at 55 °C (Columbus Instruments). The 
latency period for a hindlimb response (for example, shaking, jumping or licking) was 
recorded as the response time before and at different time points after surgery36. At least 
three measurements were taken per mouse. The observer was blinded to the genotype and 
treatment of the mice.
Weight bearing
Static incapacitance measurements were performed using the Incapacitance Tester 
(Columbus Instruments). Mice were first acclimated to the chamber at least three times 
before measurement. After acclimatization, mice were maneuvered inside the chamber to 
stand with one paw on each scale. The weight placed on each hindlimb was measured over a 
3-s interval for at least three separate measurements. Results are expressed as a percentage

 of the weight placed on the operated limb versus the weight placed on the contralateral 
control limb. The observer was blinded to the genotype and treatment of the mice.
Pharmacokinetic half-life determination
Local and blood pharmacokinetics analyses were performed after a single intra-articular 
administration of 1 mM UBX0101 in saline to determine the half-life, and measurements 
were generated by Seventh Wave laboratories (MO, USA).
Biochemical analysis of sGAG content
Pellets (n = 3 per group) were lyophilized for 2 d and then digested overnight in 125 mg/ml 
papainase (Worthington, 3126) for 16 h at 60 °C. The sGAG content was determined by 1,9-
dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) dye assay, which measured absorbance at 525 nm and 
used chondroitin sulfate as a standard. DNA content was determined by Hoechst Dye 33342 
DNA assay, using calf thymus DNA as a standard. sGAG content was expressed as 
micrograms of sGAG per microgram of DNA.
Histology
Pellets and mouse joints were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, dehydrated in 
increasing concentrations of ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were cut 
from the paraffin blocks and applied to glass slides. The sections were stained for 
proteoglycans with aqueous safranin O (0.1%) for 5 min, and the specimens were then 
mounted.
Quantification of subchondral bone damage
Osteophyte thickness (a distance on the marginal zone of the medial tibial plateau starting at 
an original edge of the tibial articular cartilage) was measured with AxioVision SE64 
software. Medial tibial bone sclerosis (the extent of subchondral bone sclerosis and 
reduction in bone marrow area) was scored by measuring the subchondral trabecular bone to 
marrow ratio. On each safranin O–stained joint section, the decrease or increase in 
trabecular bone area was assigned a score from −5 to 5, where 0 represents no increase or 
decrease, −5 represents severe bone loss and 5 represents severe bone sclerosis.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical staining, the endogenous peroxidase activity of the sections was 
quenched using 2.5% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in methanol and sections were then incubated 
at 3 °C with 0.25% (w/v) hyaluronidase for 1 h. The AEC Broad-Spectrum Histostain-SP 
Kit (Invitrogen, 959944) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions. Primary 
antibodies for p16INK4a (1:500; Abcam, ab54210), MMP-13 (1:200; Abcam, ab39012), type 
I collagen (1:100; Abcam, ab34710), type II collagen (1:300; Abcam, ab34712) and type X 
collagen (1:50; Abcam, ab58632), osteocalcin (1:100; Millipore, AB10911), HMGB1 
(1:500; Abcam, ab18256), Ki-67 (1:100; Novusbio, NB110-89717) and PCNA (1:100; 
Thermo Scientific, MA511358) were used and diluted in 4% BSA dissolved in PBST 2.5% 
Triton X-100 in PBS.

 Immunofluorescence
Monolayer cultures of human OA chondrocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 
permeabilized with PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then blocked with 
4% BSA containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were 
incubated with primary antibodies against HMGB1 (1:100; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. The 
cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) 
conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1,000; Life Technologies, A-11012). After washing, the 
nuclei were counterstained with DAPI for 5 min. Nuclear HMGB1 was imaged by 
fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss, USA). Cell proliferation was detected using Click-iT 
EdU Alexa Fluor 488 imaging kits (Promega, C10337). Total cells were counted following 
nuclear DAPI counterstaining in ten random fields per culture dish to determine the 
percentage of EdU-positive cells.
SA-β-galactosidase staining
SA-β-gal staining was done using a kit (Biovision, K320-250) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. SnCs were identified as blue-stained cells under light 
microscopy. Total cells were counted using a nuclear DAPI counterstain in ten random fields 
per culture dish to determine the percentage of SA-ß-gal-positive cells.
Flow cytometry analysis for apoptosis detection
For Annexin V/PI analysis, live trypsinized and floating cells were collected, centrifuged 
and rinsed with PBS. Cells were stained with the Annexin V apoptosis detection kit APC 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience, 88-8007). Data were analyzed 
with the BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer and FlowJo X 10.0 software (Becton Dickinson).
Immunoblotting
To assay the cleaved caspase-3 and p16INK4a proteins, chondrocytes were harvested, washed 
twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific, 89900) containing 
protease (Sigma, P8340) and phosphatase (Sigma, P5726) inhibitor mixture according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein concentration was determined using the BCA 
assay (Pierce, 23227). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE and then transferred 
onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% BSA in 
TBST and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies specific for cleaved 
caspase-3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling, 9661), p21 (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-417), 
ß-actin (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778) and GAPDH (1:1,000; Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, sc-1694). After washing away unbound primary antibodies, the membranes 
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies 
(1:5,000; Bio-Rad, 1706515) and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5,000; Cell Signaling, 
7076) and protein bands were detected using an ECL detection system with X-ray film 
(Fujifilm).
Statistics
The data displayed normal variance. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample 
size. Pilot experiments were performed with a small number of animals (Supplementary Fig.

 1) to determine average and s.d. in the model and characterization methods. From this 
information, a power analysis was performed to determine adequate animal numbers to 
achieve statistical significance. The experiments were not randomized, except for the in vivo 
animal studies with mice, as described above. No samples or animals were excluded from 
the analysis except mice who died early as a result of fighting (we performed 12 in vivo 
experiments, and 1 or 2 animals were excluded per experiment, each of which usually 
entailed 40–60 animals; so, at most, 1 animal out of 40 animals was excluded from analysis). 
All in vivo data are expressed as the mean and each data point represents an individual 
mouse. All in vitro data are expressed as averages ± s.d. Statistical significance (P values) 
was determined by an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction (we do 
not assume an equal s.d. in each group) or one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s multiple-comparisons 
test). All analyses were performed with Prism 6 software from GraphPad (San Diego, CA, 
USA). Statistical significance was determined to be P < 0.05.

months) mice. (d) Representative whole-body luminescence images on day 28 after ACLT 
surgery (no surgery, n = 8; Veh treated, n = 7; UBX0101 treated, n = 8) (left) and 
quantification of luminescence (in arbitrary units, A.U.) at the indicated times after the 
surgery of male p16-3MR mice aged 19–20 months treated as indicated in Figure 2a (right). 
Scale bars, 2 cm (no surgery, n = 8; Veh treated, n = 7; UBX treated, n = 8). (e) 
Quantification of mRNA levels for Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a, Mmp13, Col2a1 and Acan normalized 
to Actb levels in joints 28 d after ACLT (n = 3 for all groups). (f) Representative images of 
safranin O and methyl green staining and immunostaining for p16INK4a (brown, arrows; no 
surgery, n = 4; Veh treated, n = 3; UBX0101 treated, n = 4), Ki-67 (no surgery and Veh 
treated, n = 3; UBX0101 treated, n = 4) and HMGB1 (brown, arrowheads; no surgery, n = 5; 
Veh treated and UBX0101 treated, n = 3) on articular cartilage. HC, hyaline cartilage; CC, 
calcified cartilage. Scale bars, 100 μm. (g) OARSI grade for no-surgery, vehicle-treated and 
UBX0101-treated ACLT mice (no surgery, n = 5; Veh treated, n = 6; UBX treated, n = 7).

UBX0101 clears SnCs by inducing apoptosis and improves the cartilage-forming ability of 
chondrocytes from human OA tissue. (a) Schematic of the monolayer experiments in b–e. 
(b) Quantification of SA-β-gal-positive cells and the percentage of live (gate Q2, PI
−Annexin V−), apoptotic (gate Q3, PI−Annexin V+ and gate Q4, PI+Annexin V+), and dead 
(gate Q1, PI+Annexin V−) SnCs in monolayer-cultured human OA chondrocytes treated 
with vehicle or 43 μM UBX0101. Representative images are shown of cells with nuclear 
HMGB1 (red) visualized by immunostaining (n = 10 images per group). Scale bars, 100 μm. 
(c) Representative flow cytometric plots measuring apoptosis from three independent 
experiments. (d) Immunoblot analysis of cleaved caspase-3 (cCasp3) and actin in human OA 
chondrocytes at 18 h, 1 d and 2 d after incubation with vehicle or 43 μM UBX0101. The 
experiment was performed two independent times. See Supplementary Figure 13 for 
uncropped immunoblots. (e) Quantification of mRNA levels for CDKN2A, MMP3, IL1B, 
IL6 and MMP13 normalized to ACTB levels; n = 3 for each group. (f) Representative EdU 
staining (left; green) and quantification of the percentage of EdU-positive cells remaining 
(right) in human OA chondrocyte cultures after removing SnCs using UBX0101; n = 5 for 
each group. Scale bars, 100 μm. (g) Schematic of the 3D pellet culture experiments in h–j. 
(h) SA-β-gal staining (left; scale bars, 1 mm) and sectioned images immunostained for 
p16INK4a, MMP13 and COL2A1 and stained for safranin O (right; scale bars, 100 μm) in 
3D pellet cultures of human OA chondrocytes treated with vehicle or 43 μM UBX0101; n =
