Abstract: Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal 
cingulate white matter (SCC) has shown promise as an intervention for 
patients with chronic, unremitting depression (TRD). To test the safety 
and efficacy of DBS for TRD, a prospective, randomized, sham-controlled 
trial was conducted.  
Methods: Participants with TRD were implanted with a DBS system targeting 
bilateral SCC white matter and randomized to six months of active versus 
sham DBS followed by six months open-label SCC DBS. The primary outcome 
was response rate at the end of the six-month double-blind phase. 
Response was defined as a 40% or greater reduction in depression severity 
from baseline. A futility analysis was performed when approximately half 
of the proposed sample received DBS implantation and completed the 
double-blind phase. At the conclusion of the 12-month study, a subset of 
patients continued to be followed for up to 24 months. 
Findings: Prior to the futility analysis, 90 participants were randomized 
to active (N=60) versus sham (N=30) stimulation. Both groups showed 
improvement, but there was no statistically significant difference in 
response rate during the double-blind, sham-controlled phase. 
Participants continued to improve during the six months open-label phase. 
Long-term response and remission rates for all participants receiving 
active DBS open-label were, respectively, 40% and 19% at 12 months, 51% 
and 17% at 18 months, and 48% and 25% at 24 months. Twenty-eight patients

 experienced 39 adverse events; eight of these (in seven patients) were 
deemed to be related to the study device and/or surgery.  
Interpretation: This study confirmed the safety and feasibility of SCC 
DBS as a treatment for TRD but failed to show statistically significant 
antidepressant efficacy in a six months double-blind, sham-controlled 
trial. Long-term (up to 24 months) open-label SCC DBS was associated with 
a response rate of nearly 50%, with 25% of participants remitted. These 
rates are clinically meaningful and higher than those expected in this 
patient population with treatment-as-usual.   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Introduction 
 
Brodmann Area 25 (BA25) within the subcallosal cingulate has been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of treatment-resistant 
depression.1 In depressed patients who respond to antidepressant treatments, BA25 activity shows a consistent change associated with 
antidepressant response. However, in patients with treatment-resistant depression, BA25 activity does not change with adequate 
antidepressant treatment compared to treatment responders. Anatomically, BA25 shows a pattern of structural connectivity that supports its 
role in the pathophysiology of depression and treatment-resistant depression, with monosynaptic connections to the medial prefrontal cortex, 
perigenual and dorsal anterior cingulate gyri, hippocampus/amygdala, ventral striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus and monoaminergic nuclei 
within the brain stem.1 Therefore, direct modulation of BA25, and especially its white matter connections to other brain regions involved in 
depression, is a potential treatment target for patients with treatment-resistant depression. 
 
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter has shown promising safety and efficacy for patients with 
treatment-resistant depression.2-9 Open-label, chronic, high-frequency (>100 Hz) subcallosal cingulate DBS has demonstrated six-month 
response rates of about 50% and long-term remission rates (over two to six years) around 50%.4-7, 10 Patients enrolled in these studies were 
highly treatment-resistant (typically not responding to at least four antidepressant medications in the current episode, and no consistent 
response to psychotherapy and/or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)), chronically depressed (average episode duration of about five years) and 
severely ill due to their treatment-resistant depression, with the vast majority effectively disabled. These preliminary findings are clinically 
meaningful and compare favorably to response and remission rates in patients with treatment-resistant depression receiving treatment-as-
usual, other neuromodulation interventions or ablative procedures such as cingulotomy.11-17 Given these encouraging open-label data, a 
Manuscript
  
 
prospective, randomized, double-blind sham-controlled trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for treatment-resistant depression was conducted. It 
was hypothesized that six months of subcallosal cingulate DBS would be associated with statistically significant antidepressant efficacy 
compared to sham stimulation.  
 
 Methods 
Study overview 
 
A six-month, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
subcallosal cingulate DBS (Libra®XP Deep Brain Stimulation System, St. Jude Medical, Plano, Texas) for patients with treatment-resistant 
depression. A six-month open-label phase followed the double-blind phase. Planned enrollment was 201 participants randomized at up to 20 
sites. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00617162). Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at each 
site and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under an Investigational Device Exemption (G070107, sponsored by St. Jude Medical). The study 
was monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Recruitment occurred from April 10, 2008 to November 21, 2012.

Inclusion criteria included: 1) men and women aged 21-70 years; 2) unipolar, non-psychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed 
before age 45 with a current episode >12 months duration; 3) lack of antidepressant response (via medical and/or pharmacy records) to a 
minimum of four adequate antidepressant treatments, including at least three medications from three different classes, evidence-based 
  
 
psychotherapy, and/or ECT, 4) lack of sustained response to a course of psychotherapy; 5) Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) score >22 at each of three separate baseline visits, rated by two separate psychiatrists; baseline visits 2 and 3 were separated by no

informed consent.  
 
Exclusion criteria included: 1) bipolar or psychotic disorder; 2) obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic 
disorder, bulimia or anorexia nervosa; 3) generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as the primary diagnosis during the current depressive episode; 4) 
substance use disorder (excluding caffeine, nicotine) within the last 12 months; 5) borderline or antisocial personality disorder; 6) substantial risk 
of suicide; 7) received ECT within 3 months prior to enrollment, or likely to require ECT during the study; 8) central nervous system disease 
impairing motor, sensory or cognitive function or requiring intermittent or chronic medication; 9) fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome or

surgical trial; and 16) unable to comply with study visit schedule and timeline. 
 
Concomitant treatments 
  
 
 
Participants could continue psychotherapy and medications during the study but were required to maintain a stable medication regimen 
as well as regularly scheduled psychotherapy visits. Medication changes or the initiation of psychotherapy were not allowed during the six-
month double-blind phase. Minor adjustments to sedative/hypnotic and anxiolytic medications were allowed.  
 
Screening and baseline assessments 
 
Potential participants were screened according to the eligibility criteria above. At least two years of medical records were reviewed. 
Potential participants were provided a detailed informed consent document, had an initial screening, and completed three baseline evaluations. 
These evaluations occurred no less than two weeks apart from each other, and baseline visits 2 and 3 were not separated by more than six 
weeks. The first two baseline visit evaluations were performed by independent psychiatrists. Baseline assessments included the MADRS; the 17-
item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD-17); the Self-Rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR); subsection for 
cluster B personality disorder of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SCID-II); Systematic Assessment for 
Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE); the 30 item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30); the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS); 
the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS); GAF; the short form Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QOL); Clinical 
Global Impression of Severity and Improvement (CGI); Patient Global Impression Index (PGI); Health and Labor Questionnaire (HLQ); Hamilton 
Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). After the baseline visit was completed, the lead study 
psychiatrist (PEH) performed an external review of the participant’s data to ensure eligibility. After the third baseline visit, a neuropsychological 
  
 
battery was administered to assess attention/working memory and other executive functions. A high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scan and pre-surgical evaluation were also performed.  
 
Surgery and target localization 
 
The DBS system consisted of two leads, extension wires and an implantable pulse generator (IPG). Each DBS lead consisted of a four 
electrode array with a 3 mm electrode at the tip and three 1.5 mm electrodes, each separated by 1.5 mm. At least two of three experts (HSM, 
CH, PEH) manually selected and agreed upon the optimal surgical target, defined as a region in the subcallosal cingulate white matter 
approximately 75% of the distance from the anterior commissure to the plane defined by the gray matter edge of the genu of the corpus 
callosum and in the transition from the white matter to the gray matter in the medial-lateral axis.2, 3, 18 Target selection was performed in native 
MRI space (i.e., not in an atlas-defined space) and involved identifying a target region at the gray matter-white matter transition area in the 
subcallosal cingulate gyrus. Optimal target location was provided to the site neurosurgeon to assist with surgical targeting, and each 
neurosurgeon was trained on targeting by a team of experts (HSM, CH, AML).  
 
Bilateral DBS system implantation occurred no less than two weeks and no more than four weeks after the final baseline evaluation 
using the standard stereotactic surgical procedures at each site. Impedance of the system was tested intraoperatively, but no stimulation was 
delivered during surgery.  
 
Post-operative computed tomography (CT) was obtained to assess for intracranial hemorrhage and lead localization. The post-operative 
CT scan was then merged with the pre-operative high-resolution MRI used for initial target selection. At least two of three expert consultants 
  
 
(HSM, CH, PEH) reviewed these merged images and selected an optimal contact sequence for chronic monopolar stimulation. The first contact 
chosen was the one in closest proximity to the predefined target (described above), and the second contact chosen was the one in the next 
closest proximity to the predefined target. No participant had more than two contacts within the predefined target region. Four subjects had an 
additional surgery to reposition the leads due to the leads not being in the ideal target region; in all cases, this occurred prior to randomization. 
Post-operative CT scans were merged with baseline MRI scans.  
 
Randomization 
 
Approximately two weeks after device implantation, participants were randomized to receive immediate active stimulation (Stimulation 
group) or 6-month delayed stimulation (sham; Control group) using a ratio of 2:1 (Stimulation:Control). Randomization was computer-generated 
(SAS version 9.2) with a block size of three at each site before the site started the study. At each site, an unblinded DBS programmer was 
informed of treatment allocation; all other team members and the patient were blinded to treatment allocation.  
 
DBS programming 
 
For participants randomized to the Stimulation group, stimulation was initiated at the completion of the randomization visit (week 2 
following implantation). Initial parameters included monopolar stimulation at the optimal first contact selected on each side at 130 Hz, 91 
microsecond pulse width (PW), 4 milliamperes (mA). For Controls, a sham programming session was performed, but stimulation was not 
initiated. Participants were not formally assessed for whether they had acute effects from stimulation.  
  
 
 
For participants receiving active stimulation, programming changes were made based on the change in MADRS from the previous rating. 
Two weeks after the initial programming session, no parameter changes were made if the MADRS score reduction was ≥10% from the previous 
evaluation. If the MADRS value was ≤10% lower than that on the previous evaluation, amplitude was increased to 6 mA. After another four 
weeks (if the MADRS was again ≤10% lower than that from the previous evaluation), the amplitude was increased to 8 mA. After another four 
weeks, if the MADRS was again ≤10% lower than that from the previous evaluation, the second contact from the pre-selected contact sequence 
would be added for monopolar stimulation (i.e., the patient would have two contacts providing active monopolar [8 mA] stimulation in each 
hemisphere). If intolerable side effects occurred following a parameter change, parameters were returned to the previous settings. No 
modifications were allowed in pulse width or frequency. No further parameter changes were allowed beyond 10 weeks following initiation of 
stimulation. Participants randomized to sham had similar programming visits, but stimulation remained off during the double-blind phase.  
 
Randomized, double blind, sham-controlled phase 
 
Following randomization, participants returned for evaluations at weeks 4, 6, and 8, then every month until the 6-month endpoint. At 
each visit, the following evaluations were completed: MADRS; SAFTEE; DBS programming form; IDS-C30; QIDS-SR; WSAS; GAF; CGI; PGI; HAM-A; 
and C-SSRS. At the 3 month and 6 month visits, the following additional evaluations were completed: HRSD-17; YMRS; QOL; and HLQ. The 
neuropsychological battery was repeated at the 6 month visit. Outside of regularly scheduled, in-person evaluations, each patient was contacted 
by phone or in person by study personnel every one to two weeks to assess for safety. Participants experiencing worsening of suicidal ideation 
could remain in the study if stability (“rescue”) could be achieved within seven days. Participants experiencing a ≥25% worsening in MADRS 
  
 
score from baseline were considered treatment failures, exited from this phase of the study and enrolled in the open-label or long-term follow-
up study based on whether they were already receiving active stimulation.  
 
Open-label phase 
 
Following the 6-month double-blind phase, participants entered the 6-month open-label phase. All participants in the Control group 
(including responders and remitters) had stimulation initiated at this time with the identical algorithm employed for contact and parameter 
selection and changes as described above for the active treatment group. Participants in the Stimulation group continued with active 
stimulation. In the open-label phase, patients and study staff (except the unblinded programmer) were not provided any information about 
randomization status during the first 6 months of the study. At each monthly visit the following evaluations were completed: DBS programming 
form; MADRS; IDS-C30; QIDS-SR; WSAS; GAF; CGI; PGI; HAM-A; and C-SSRS. At the 9 month and 12 month visits, the following additional 
evaluations were completed: SAFTEE; YMRS; QOL; and HLQ. The neuropsychological battery was performed again at the 12 month visit. 
Parameter adjustments were constrained as described above. Changes in medications and psychotherapy were allowed in this open-label phase.   
 
Long-term follow-up phase 
 
Participants completing the 12 month study were invited to continue in a long-term, naturalistic follow-up study. Study visits occurred 
every six months. Changes in stimulation parameters, medications and psychotherapy were allowed. For patients continuing with chronic DBS, a 
rechargeable battery was provided as needed.  
  
 
 
Efficacy measures 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was defined as difference in response rate between the Stimulation and Control groups. 
Response was defined as a ≥40% reduction in MADRS and no worsening in GAF from baseline (average of 3 baseline MADRS assessments) to the 
average scores at months 4, 5, and 6. The average of months 4, 5, and 6 was chosen as the primary endpoint due to the aim to assess for a 
sustained change over time. Secondary measures of efficacy included changes from baseline to endpoint for the HRSD-17, IDS-C30, QIDS-SR, 
WSAS, PGI, CGI, QOL and HAM-A. For the 6-month open-label and long-term follow-up studies, response was defined as a ≥40% reduction in 
MADRS from the baseline average to the score at the time point of interest (e.g., 12 months, 18 months, 24 months). Remission at all time 
points was defined as a MADRS score ≤10. 
 
Safety measures 
 
The incidence of all adverse events (e.g., hospitalization due to worsening depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, unanticipated 
medical treatment for psychiatric reasons, and device related events) that occurred over study duration were used as the primary safety 
endpoints for the study. 
 
Statistical considerations and data analyses 
  
 
 
Based on preliminary data7, a ≥40% response rate was anticipated for the active subcallosal cingulate DBS group. A ≤18.5% response rate 
for the Control group was expected.12 Therefore, 159 participants randomized 2:1 (106 in the active group and 53 in the sham group) would 
provide 80% power to reject the primary efficacy null hypothesis at a 5% significance level. Sample size calculations were performed based on 
the Z test method with pooled variance using PASS 2005. To allow for a dropout rate as high as 20%, the sample size for recruitment was 
increased to 201 participants (134 in the active stimulation group and 67 in the sham stimulation group). 
 
The primary efficacy outcome assessed was difference in response rate between the groups (as defined above). Participants who were 
missing one or two of the assessments at months 4, 5 or 6 had data from the available visits used. Participants missing MADRS scores for Months 
4, 5 and 6 were considered non-responders. A logistic regression model including effects of treatment group, study site, level of treatment 
resistance (as defined by ATHF criteria), and baseline MADRS was fitted. Data from study sites with fewer than three participants in either 
treatment group were pooled.    
 
 
Planned futility analysis 
 
In approving this study, the U.S. FDA required a futility analysis be completed once ≥75 participants had reached the primary endpoint 
by either completing the month 6 visit or exiting the study. No more than 125 participants could be enrolled prior to the futility analysis.  The 
futility analysis was performed using the average of the revised alternative hypothesis and the observed interim results. With the current sample 
size of 201 participants, the alternative hypothesis was a 40% response rate for participants receiving active stimulation and a 20.7% response 
rate for participants receiving sham (the proportions providing 80% power to reject the primary hypothesis given the smaller sample size at the 
  
 
time of the futility analysis). Based on these revised population proportions, 5000 sets of simulation results among the remaining approximately 
84 stimulation participants and 42 control group participants were run. Each set of simulated results was added to the observed results, and a 
two-tailed Fisher’s exact p-value was calculated. The probability of a successful outcome of the study was the proportion of these p-values 
<0.05. If the probability of a successful study outcome was <10%, the study would be stopped for futility. Additionally, the study could be 
stopped at the sponsor’s discretion, even if this formal definition for futility was not met.  
 
 
Results 
 
A total of 128 participants were enrolled (i.e., signed informed consent) from 15 investigational sites prior to the completion of the 
futility analysis (Figure 1). Of the 128 participants enrolled into the study, only 90 from 13 investigational sites received DBS system implantation 
and were randomized to treatment. Of these, 60 participants were randomized to active stimulation, and 30 were randomized to sham 
stimulation. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in demographic or clinical variables (Table 1).  
 
On average, patients in both groups showed a statically significant improvement in depression and global functioning over 6 and 12 
months. At the endpoint for the 6-month blinded, controlled phase, there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the 
Stimulation group (20% response rate; 10% remission rate) and the Control group (17% response rate; 7% remission rate)(Figure 2, Tables 2 and 
3; analyses of primary and secondary outcome measures are shown in Supplementary Tables S1-S8). In participants randomized to sham 
stimulation for the first six months of the study, six months of active stimulation did not result in additional statistically significant within group 
antidepressant efficacy (i.e., no statistically significant decrease in MADRS score from month 6 to month 12). By the 12 month visit, response and 
  
 
remission rates did not statistically significantly increase compared to the 6 month visit in either group, though response rates numerically 
increased in both groups (Stimulation group: 30% response rate; Control group: 27% response rate), and remission rates remained stable to 
slightly increased (Stimulation group: 18%; Control group: 7% remission rate). Medication and/or psychotherapy changes were only allowed in 
the 6 month open-label phase, but did not correlate with efficacy or differential efficacy in the groups.  
 
Adequacy of blinding was confirmed based on questioning participants about which group they were assigned to after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 
3 months and 6 months of the blinded, randomized, controlled phase of the study. There was no difference between the Stimulation and 
Control group in proportion of participants guessing they were receiving active stimulation, with approximately 30%-40% of each group 
(Stimulation, Control) guessing they were receiving active stimulation at each time point. About 50% of participants in each group guessed 
accurately, and there was no difference in accuracy of guessing between the groups. No participant reported any acute effects with the initiation 
of active stimulation, nor were any effects of initial activation of stimulation observed by study staff, including the unblinded programmer.  
 
For the futility analysis, based on the first six months’ data, the response rate for the Stimulation group was predicted to be 40%, and 
the response rate for the Control group was predicted to be 18.5% (see Methods above). In the actual futility analysis, the Stimulation group 
showed a 20% response rate, and the Control group showed a 17% response rate. It was concluded that the study had a 17% chance of success if 
continued. Although this did not meet the formal definition for futility described above (<10% chance of success), the sponsor chose to end 
study enrollment following the futility analysis. 
 
Following the initial 12-month study, seventy-seven (77) participants entered into a four-year follow-up study. Eight participants from 
the Active group and five participants from the Control group dropped out; all were nonresponders at the 12 month endpoint. For long-term 
  
 
assessment of efficacy, response was defined as a ≥40% decrease in MADRS score from baseline to each endpoint, and remission was defined as 
a MADRS score ≤10. For assessment of long-term efficacy, patients in both groups (Stimulation and Control) were combined for analysis; 
therefore and by example, six months of stimulation refers to six months of active stimulation regardless of whether this started initially (in the 
Stimulation group) or six months later (in the Control group). With long-term, active subcallosal cingulate DBS, response and remission rates 
were 40% and 19% at 12 months, 51% and 17% at 18 months, and 48% and 25% at 24 months, respectively. Mean MADRS and GAF scores by 
months of stimulation are shown in Figure 3. 
 
To assess whether stimulation parameter and/or medication changes were associated with efficacy, two post-hoc analyses were 
performed. For the first 12 months data, a generalized linear mixed effects model was fitted that included treatment group, medication change 
and stimulation parameter change at each follow-up visit as independent fixed effects, subject as a random effect and responder status at each 
follow-up visit as the dependent variable. Based on this model, neither stimulation parameter change nor medication change was associated 
with response rate (p=0.2176 and p=0.4891, respectively). Separately, a generalized linear mixed effects model was fitted for the 18-30 months 
(open-label) data that included medication change and stimulation parameter change at each follow-up visit as independent fixed effects, 
subject as a random effect and responder status at each follow-up visit as the dependent variable. This analysis showed that stimulation 
parameter change was associated with increased response rate (p=0.0127), but medication change was not (p=0.3955). 
 
Twenty eight (28) participants experienced 39 serious adverse events (SAE) during the 12 month study (Table 3). Eight (8) SAEs occurring 
in seven patients were judged to be definitely related to the study device and/or surgery, including six infections (in five patients), one skin 
erosion over the extension wires, and one post-operative seizure. The remainder of SAEs were attributed to the primary mood disorder and 
  
 
deemed unrelated to the device or active stimulation; i.e., there appeared to be no clear temporal relationship between the onset and 
resolution of these events and the initiation or adjustment of stimulation. There were two deaths by suicide in the study; both were in the 
Control group during the 6-month open-label phase. No unanticipated device related adverse events were reported. No episodes of hypomania 
or mania occurred during the study. There were no adverse neuropsychological effects at 6 or 12 months; a full description of 
neuropsychological findings will be reported separately. No side effects occurred with DBS programming, and no parameter adjustments were 
required due to side effects following a parameter change.  
 
Ten out of 90 participants receiving DBS system implantation terminated the study early (five prior to the primary endpoint/six-month 
visit and five before the 12-month visit). Six early exits were due to adverse events (worsening depression [n=1], suicide attempt [n=1], increased 
suicidal ideation with failed “rescue” (see Methods) [n=1], death by suicide [n=2], and head pain [n=1]). Three early exits were due to patient 
preference and one was due to the sponsor closing the study. Four out of the 10 subjects that exited the study early chose to have the device 
fully explanted shortly after study exit.  
 
No demographic or clinical characteristics were associated with 6 month, 12 month or 24 month response or remission rates. Presence 
of melancholic features, duration of illness and/or current episode, history of ECT did not differ between responders and nonresponders at any 
time point. Eventual responders versus non-responders did not differ in use or change in psychotherapy, medications or stimulation parameter 
adjustments. No systematic difference in electrode placement between responders and non-responders was identified, consistent with prior 
studies.18, 19 Additionally, distance between actual vs. planned target placement did not differ significantly between eventual responders versus 
nonresponders, and there were no significant differences between sites in accuracy of electrode placement.   
  
 
 
Discussion 
 
This study helps confirm the feasibility and safety of subcallosal cingulate DBS as a treatment for treatment-resistant depression 
patients. However, this study failed to demonstrate that six months of active versus sham stimulation was associated with statistically significant 
antidepressant effects. Additionally, participants initially treated with sham stimulation during the first six months of the study did not show 
statistically significant antidepressant benefit with an additional six months of open-label active stimulation. In participants with up to two years 
of open-label active DBS stimulation, 48% achieved an antidepressant response and 25% achieved remission. These long-term outcomes are 
clinically meaningful and greater than would be expected with treatment-as-usual in this highly treatment-refractory patient population.12 
 
These findings are disappointing given the encouraging data from earlier open-label studies of subcallosal cingulate DBS, and no 
demographic or clinical characteristics were associated with response versus nonresponse. However, it is noted that participants in this study 
had an average current episode duration of about 12 years. This is much longer than the average duration of current episode in prior subcallosal 
cingulate DBS studies (approximately five years)3, 6 and may have contributed to the low overall response rate. Although subcallosal cingulate 
DBS has shown enduring, open-label efficacy in chronic depression,4, 6 it is possible that this intervention is less effective for patients with 
extremely chronic depression. 
 
Interpreting these findings must also consider study design. For studies of invasive interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders, placebo 
effects can be surprisingly high and may actually be quite long-lasting.20, 21 However, the placebo response rate in this study was not significantly 
greater than what was anticipated; in fact it was lower than projected. Indeed, the major difference in this study compared to prior subcallosal 
  
 
cingulate DBS studies was the lower response rate to active stimulation during the blinded phase of the study. Again, this may be due to the 
more chronic nature of disease in this cohort compared to prior samples. Additionally, it is not uncommon for the response to active treatment 
to be lower in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial than in open-label studies. Additionally, prior studies and data from this cohort 
suggest delayed and progressive antidepressant effects over time with subcallosal cingulate DBS. Therefore, it is possible that differences in 
benefit between active and sham stimulation may not be seen until after one to two years of treatment in this group. However, such a time 
frame makes sham-controlled studies much more challenging. Other study designs may need to be considered, such as open-label stimulation 
followed by blinded discontinuation.22 
 
 Targeting for this study was based on an algorithm derived from early subcallosal cingulate DBS studies.18 Neurosurgical placement of 
the DBS electrodes, based on this algorithm, was highly accurate and did not differ between eventual responders and nonresponders. However, 
gross anatomical placement of subcallosal cingulate DBS electrodes may not be adequate for optimal treatment delivery. Recently, important 
subtleties in electrode placement have been described based on the white matter tracts impacted.19 These data suggest that, for maximal 
efficacy, the active subcallosal cingulate DBS electrode must be placed such that it impacts a critical network of white matter tracts connecting 
key brain regions, including the forceps minor, cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. Therefore, it is possible that prospective targeting 
based on individual DTI tractography could optimize subcallosal cingulate DBS electrode placement.23, 24  
 
Given the strength of the preliminary data leading to this study, and the emerging data suggesting ways to optimize targeting for this 
intervention, the negative outcome of this trial should not be simply interpreted as a failure of subcallosal cingulate DBS for treatment-resistant 
depression. Subsequent studies are merited to determine whether active subcallosal cingulate DBS failed to differentiate from sham due to 
  
 
clinical features of the patient population (e.g., extremely chronic depression) or suboptimal electrode placement. Additionally, identification 
and use of a physiological metric to verify engagement of the appropriate neural circuit could assist with targeting. Importantly, the long term 
response and remission rates in this and prior studies suggest that this intervention continues to have promise.

Introduction 
 
Brodmann Area 25 (BA25) within the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) has been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of treatment-
resistant depression (TRD).1 In depressed patients who respond to antidepressant treatments, BA25 activity shows a consistent change 
associated with antidepressant response. However, in patients with TRDtreatment-resistant depression patients, BA25 activity does not change 
with adequate antidepressant treatment compared to treatment responders. Anatomically, BA25 shows a pattern of structural connectivity that 
supports its role in the pathophysiology of depression and TRDtreatment-resistant depression, with monosynaptic connections to the medial 
prefrontal cortex, perigenual and dorsal anterior cingulate gyri, hippocampus/amygdala, ventral striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus and 
monoaminergic nuclei within the brain stem.1 Therefore, direct modulation of BA25, and especially its white matter connections to other brain 
regions involved in depression, is a potential treatment target for patients with TRDtreatment-resistant depression. 
 
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter (SCC) has shown promising safety and efficacy for patients with 
TRDtreatment-resistant depression.2-9 Open-label, chronic, high-frequency (>100 Hz) SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS has demonstrated six-month 
response rates of about 50% and long-term remission rates (over two to six years) around 50%.4-7, 10 Patients enrolled in these studies were 
highly treatment-resistant (typically not responding to at least four antidepressant medications in the current episode, and no consistent 
response to psychotherapy and/or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)), chronically depressed (average episode duration of about five years) and 
severely ill due to their TRDtreatment-resistant depression, with the vast majority effectively disabled. These preliminary findings are clinically 
meaningful and compare favorably to response and remission rates in patients with TRDtreatment-resistant depression receiving treatment-as-
usual, other neuromodulation interventions or ablative procedures such as cingulotomy.11-17 Given these encouraging open-label data, a

prospective, randomized, double-blind sham-controlled trial of SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS for TRDtreatment-resistant depression was 
conducted. It was hypothesized that six months of SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS would be associated with statistically significant antidepressant 
efficacy compared to sham stimulation.

SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS (Libra®XP Deep Brain Stimulation System, St. Jude Medical, Plano, Texas) for patients with TRDtreatment-resistant 
depression. A six-month open-label phase followed the double-blind phase. Planned enrollment was 201 participants randomized at up to 20 
sites. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00617162). Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at each 
site and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under an Investigational Device Exemption (G070107, sponsored by St. Jude Medical). The study 
was monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Recruitment occurred from April 10, 2008 to November 21, 2012.

Concomitant treatments 
  
 
 
Participants could continue psychotherapy and medications during the study but were required to maintain a stable medication regimen 
as well as regularly scheduled psychotherapy visits. Medication changes or the initiation of psychotherapy were not allowed during the six-
month double-blind phase. Minor adjustments to sedative/hypnotic and anxiolytic medications were allowed.  
 
Screening and baseline assessments 
 
Potential participants were screened according to the eligibility criteria above. At least two years of medical records were reviewed. 
Potential participants were provided a detailed informed consent document, had an initial screening, and completed three baseline evaluations. 
These evaluations occurred no less than two weeks apart from each other, and baseline visits 2 and 3 were not separated by more than six 
weeks. The first two baseline visit evaluations were performed by independent psychiatrists. Baseline assessments included the MADRS; the 17-
item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD-17); the Self-Rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR); subsection for 
cluster B personality disorder of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SCID-II); Systematic Assessment for 
Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE); the 30 item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30); the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS); 
the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS); GAF; the short form Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QOL); Clinical 
Global Impression of Severity and Improvement (CGI); Patient Global Impression Index (PGI); Health and Labor Questionnaire (HLQ); Hamilton 
Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). After the baseline visit was completed, the lead study 
psychiatrist (PEH) performed an external review of the participant’s data to ensure eligibility. After the third baseline visit, a neuropsychological 
  
 
battery was administered to assess attention/working memory and other executive functions. A high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scan and pre-surgical evaluation were also performed.  
 
Surgery and target localization 
 
The DBS system consisted of two leads, extension wires and an implantable pulse generator (IPG). Each DBS lead consisted of a four 
electrode array with a 3 mm electrode at the tip and three 1.5 mm electrodes, each separated by 1.5 mm. At least two of three experts (HSM, 
CH, PEH) manually selected and agreed upon the optimal surgical target, defined as a region in the subcallosal cingulate white matter 
approximately 75% of the distance from the anterior commissure to the plane defined by the gray matter edge of the genu of the corpus 
callosum and in the transition from the white matter to the gray matter in the medial-lateral axisTargeting the SCC for DBS for TRD has been 
previously described.2, 3, 18  Target selection was performed in native MRI space (i.e., not in an atlas-defined space) and involved identifying a 
target region at the gray matter-white matter transition area in the subcallosal cingulate gyrus. Optimal target location was provided to the site 
neurosurgeon to assist with surgical targeting, andE each neurosurgeon was trained on targeting by a team of experts (HSM, CH, AML).  
 
.Each neurosurgeon was trained on targeting by a team of experts (HSM, CH, AML). At least two experts (HSM, CH, PEH) manually 
selected and agreed upon the optimal bilateral SCC DBS targets for each patient using the baseline MRI scan. These data were provided to the 
site neurosurgeon to assist with surgical targeting. Bilateral DBS system implantation occurred no less than two weeks and no more than four 
weeks after the final baseline evaluation using the standard stereotactic surgical procedures at each site. Impedance of the system was tested 
intraoperatively, but no stimulation was delivered during surgery.  
  
 
 
Post-operative computed tomography (CT) was obtained to assess for intracranial hemorrhage and lead localization. The post-operative 
CT scan was then merged with the pre-operative high-resolution MRI used for initial target selection. Four subjects had an additional surgery to 
reposition the leads due to the leads not being in the ideal target for stimulation; in all cases, this occurred prior to randomization. Post-
operative CT scans were merged with baseline MRI scans. At least two of three expert consultants (HSM, CH, PEH) reviewed these merged 
images and selected an optimal contact sequence for chronic monopolar stimulation. The first contact chosen was the one in closest proximity 
to the predefined target (described above), and the second contact chosen was the one in the next closest proximity to the predefined target. 
No participant had more than two contacts within the predefined target region.  
Four subjects had an additional surgery to reposition the leads due to the leads not being in the ideal target regionfor stimulation; in all cases, 
this occurred prior to randomization. Post-operative CT scans were merged with baseline MRI scans. 
 
 
Randomization 
 
Approximately two weeks after device implantation, participants were randomized to receive immediate active stimulation (Stimulation 
group) or 6-month delayed stimulation (sham; Control group) using a ratio of 2:1 (Stimulation:Control). Randomization was computer-generated 
(SAS version 9.2) with a block size of three at each site before the site started the study. At each site, an unblinded DBS programmer was 
informed of treatment allocation; all other team members and the patient were blinded to treatment allocation.  
 
DBS programming 
Formatted: Tab stops: Not at 
14.13 cm
  
 
 
For participants randomized to the Stimulation group, stimulation was initiated at the completion of the randomization visit (week 2 
following implantation). Initial parameters included monopolar stimulation at the optimal first contact selected on each side at 130 Hz, 91 
microsecond pulse width (PW), 4 milliamperes (mA). For Controls, a sham programming session was performed, but stimulation was not 
initiated. Participants were not formally assessed for whether they had acute effects from stimulation.  
 
For participants receiving active stimulation, programming changes were made based on the change in MADRS from the previous rating. 
Two weeks after the initial programming session, no parameter changes were made if the MADRS score reduction was ≥10% from the previous 
evaluation. If the MADRS value was ≤10% lower than that on the previous evaluation, amplitude was increased to 6 mA. After another four 
weeks (if the MADRS was again ≤10% lower than that from the previous evaluation), the amplitude was increased to 8 mA. After another four 
weeks, if the MADRS was again ≤10% lower than that from the previous evaluation, the second contact from the pre-selected contact sequence 
would be added for monopolar stimulation (i.e., the patient would have two contacts providing active monopolar [8 mA] stimulation in each 
hemisphere). If intolerable side effects occurred following a parameter change, parameters were returned to the previous settings. No 
modifications were allowed in pulse width or frequency. No further parameter changes were allowed beyond 10 weeks following initiation of 
stimulation. Participants randomized to sham had similar programming visits, but stimulation remained off during the double-blind phase.  
 
Randomized, double blind, sham-controlled phase 
 
Following randomization, participants returned for evaluations at weeks 4, 6, and 8, then every month until the 6-month endpoint. At 
each visit, the following evaluations were completed: MADRS; SAFTEE; DBS programming form; IDS-C30; QIDS-SR; WSAS; GAF; CGI; PGI; HAM-A; 
  
 
and C-SSRS. At the 3 month and 6 month visits, the following additional evaluations were completed: HRSD-17; YMRS; QOL; and HLQ. The 
neuropsychological battery was repeated at the 6 month visit. Outside of regularly scheduled, in-person evaluations, each patient was contacted 
by phone or in person by study personnel every one to two weeks to assess for safety. Participants experiencing worsening of suicidal ideation 
could remain in the study if stability (“rescue”) could be achieved within seven days. Participants experiencing a ≥25% worsening in MADRS 
score from baseline were considered treatment failures, exited from this phase of the study and enrolled in the open-label or long-term follow-
up study based on whether they were already receiving active stimulation.  
 
Open-label phase 
 
Following the 6-month double-blind phase, participants entered the 6-month open-label phase. All participants in the Control group 
(including responders and remitters) had stimulation initiated at this time with the identical algorithm employed for contact and parameter 
selection and changes as described above for the active treatment group. Participants in the Stimulation group continued with active 
stimulation. In the open-label phase, patients and study staff (except the unblinded programmer) were not provided any information about 
randomization status during the first 6 months of the study. At each monthly visit the following evaluations were completed: DBS programming 
form; MADRS; IDS-C30; QIDS-SR; WSAS; GAF; CGI; PGI; HAM-A; and C-SSRS. At the 9 month and 12 month visits, the following additional 
evaluations were completed: SAFTEE; YMRS; QOL; and HLQ. The neuropsychological battery was performed again at the 12 month visit. 
Parameter adjustments were constrained as described above. Changes in medications and psychotherapy were allowed in this open-label phase.   
 
  
 
Long-term follow-up phase 
 
Participants completing the 12 month study were invited to continue in a long-term, naturalistic follow-up study. Study visits occurred 
every six months. Changes in stimulation parameters, medications and psychotherapy were allowed. For patients continuing with chronic DBS, a 
rechargeable battery was provided as needed.  
 
Efficacy measures 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was defined as difference in response rate between the Stimulation and Control groups. 
Response was defined as a ≥40% reduction in MADRS and no worsening in GAF from baseline (average of 3 baseline MADRS assessments) to the 
average scores at months 4, 5, and 6. The average of months 4, 5, and 6 was chosen as the primary endpoint due to the aim to assess for a 
sustained change over time. Secondary measures of efficacy included changes from baseline to endpoint for the HRSD-17, IDS-C30, QIDS-SR, 
WSAS, PGI, CGI, QOL and HAM-A. For the 6-month open-label and long-term follow-up studies, response was defined as a ≥40% reduction in 
MADRS from the baseline average to the score at the time point of interest (e.g., 12 months, 18 months, 24 months). Remission at all time 
points was defined as a MADRS score ≤10. 
 
Safety measures 
  
 
 
The incidence of all adverse events (e.g., hospitalization due to worsening depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, unanticipated 
medical treatment for psychiatric reasons, and device related events) that occurred over study duration were used as the primary safety 
endpoints for the study. 
 
Statistical considerations and data analyses 
 
Based on preliminary data7, a ≥40% response rate was anticipated for the active SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS group. A ≤18.5% response 
rate for the Control group was expected.12 Therefore, 159 participants randomized 2:1 (106 in the active group and 53 in the sham group) would 
provide 80% power to reject the primary efficacy null hypothesis at a 5% significance level. Sample size calculations were performed based on 
the Z test method with pooled variance using PASS 2005. To allow for a dropout rate as high as 20%, the sample size for recruitment was 
increased to 201 participants (134 in the active stimulation group and 67 in the sham stimulation group). 
 
The primary efficacy outcome assessed was difference in response rate between the groups (as defined above). Participants who were 
missing one or two of the assessments at months 4, 5 or 6 had data from the available visits used. Participants missing MADRS scores for Months 
4, 5 and 6 were considered non-responders. A logistic regression model including effects of treatment group, study site, level of treatment 
resistance (as defined by ATHF criteria), and baseline MADRS was fitted. Data from study sites with fewer than three participants in either 
treatment group were pooled.    
 
 
Planned futility analysis 
  
 
 
In approving this study, the U.S. FDA required a futility analysis be completed once ≥75 participants had reached the primary endpoint 
by either completing the month 6 visit or exiting the study. No more than 125 participants could be enrolled prior to the futility analysis.  The 
futility analysis was performed using the average of the revised alternative hypothesis and the observed interim results. With the current sample 
size of 201 participants, the alternative hypothesis was a 40% response rate for participants receiving active stimulation and a 20.7% response 
rate for participants receiving sham (the proportions providing 80% power to reject the primary hypothesis given the smaller sample size at the 
time of the futility analysis). Based on these revised population proportions, 5000 sets of simulation results among the remaining approximately 
84 stimulation participants and 42 control group participants were run. Each set of simulated results was added to the observed results, and a 
two-tailed Fisher’s exact p-value was calculated. The probability of a successful outcome of the study was the proportion of these p-values 
<0.05. If the probability of a successful study outcome was <10%, the study would be stopped for futility. Additionally, the study could be 
stopped at the sponsor’s discretion, even if this formal definition for futility was not met.  
 
 
Results 
Participants and study flow 
 
A total of 128 participants were enrolled (i.e., signed informed consent) from 15 investigational sites prior to the completion of the 
futility analysis (Figure 1). Of the 128 participants enrolled into the study, only 90 from 13 investigational sites received DBS system implantation 
and were randomized to treatment. Of these, 60 participants were randomized to active stimulation, and 30 were randomized to sham 
stimulation. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in demographic or clinical variables (Table 1).

Efficacy of randomized, controlled DBS (6 months) followed by open-label treatment (6 months) 
 
On average, patients in both groups showed a statically significant improvement in depression and global functioning over 6 and 12 
months. At the endpoint for the 6-month blinded, controlled phase, there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the 
Stimulation group (20% response rate; 10% remission rate) and the Control group (17% response rate; 7% remission rate)(Figure 2, Tables 2 and 
3; analyses of primary and secondary outcome measures are shown in Supplementary Tables S1-S8). In participants randomized to sham 
stimulation for the first six months of the study, six months of active stimulation did not result in additional statistically significant within group 
antidepressant efficacy (i.e., no statistically significant decrease in MADRS score from month 6 to month 12). By the 12 month visit, response and 
remission rates did not statistically significantly increase compared to the 6 month visit in either groupimprove, though response rates 
numericallyhad increased in both groups (Stimulation group: 30% response rate; Control group: 27% response rate), and remission rates 
remained stable to slightly increased (Stimulation group: 18%; Control group: 7% remission rate). Medication and/or psychotherapy changes 
were only allowed in the 6 month open-label phase, but did not correlate with efficacy or differential efficacy in the groups.  
 
Adequacy of blinding was confirmed based on questioning participants about which group they were assigned to after 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 
3 months and 6 months of the blinded, randomized, controlled phase of the study. There was no difference between the Stimulation and 
Control group in proportion of participants guessing they were receiving active stimulation, with approximately 30%-40% of each group 
(Stimulation, Control) guessing they were receiving active stimulation at each time point. About 50% of participants in each group guessed 
Formatted: Level 1
  
 
accurately, and there was no difference in accuracy of guessing between the groups. No participant reported any acute effects with the initiation 
of active stimulation, nor were any effects of initial activation of stimulation observed by study staff, including the unblinded programmer.  
 
Futility analysis 
 
For the futility analysis, based on the first six months’ data, the response rate for the Stimulation group was predicted to be 40%, and 
the response rate for the Control group was predicted to be 18.5% (see Methods above). In the actual futility analysis, the Stimulation group 
showed a 20% response rate, and the Control group showed a 17% response rate. It was concluded that the study had a 17% chance of success if 
continued. Although this did not meet the formal definition for futility described above (<10% chance of success), the sponsor chose to end 
study enrollment following the futility analysis. 
 
Long-term outcomes 
 
Following the initial 12-month study, seventy-seven (77) participants entered into a four-year follow-up study. Eight participants from 
the Active group and five participants from the Control group dropped out; all were nonresponders at the 12 month endpoint. For long-term 
assessment of efficacy, response was defined as a ≥40% decrease in MADRS score from baseline to each endpoint, and remission was defined as 
a MADRS score ≤10. For assessment of long-term efficacy, patients in both groups (Stimulation and Control) were combined for analysis; 
therefore and by example, six months of stimulation refers to six months of active stimulation regardless of whether this started initially (in the 
Stimulation group) or six months later (in the Control group). With long-term, active SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS, response and remission rates 
Formatted: Level 1
  
 
were 40% and 19% at 12 months, 51% and 17% at 18 months, and 48% and 25% at 24 months, respectively. Mean MADRS and GAF scores by 
months of stimulation are shown in Figure 3. 
 
To assess whether stimulation parameter and/or medication changes were associated with efficacy, two post-hoc analyses were 
performed. For the first 12 months data, a generalized linear mixed effects model was fitted that included treatment group, medication change 
and stimulation parameter change at each follow-up visit as independent fixed effects, subject as a random effect and responder status at each 
follow-up visit as the dependent variable. Based on this model, neither stimulation parameter change nor medication change was associated 
with response rate (p=0.2176 and p=0.4891, respectively). Separately, a generalized linear mixed effects model was fitted for the 18-30 months 
(open-label) data that included medication change and stimulation parameter change at each follow-up visit as independent fixed effects, 
subject as a random effect and responder status at each follow-up visit as the dependent variable. This analysis showed that stimulation 
parameter change was associated with increased response rate (p=0.0127), but medication change was not (p=0.3955). Stimulation parameter, 
medication and/or psychotherapy changes were allowed during the follow-up study, but these changes, when they occurred, had no discernible 
impact on efficacy over time.  
 
Safety 
 
Twenty eight (28) participants experienced 39 serious adverse events (SAE) during the 12 month study (Table 3). Eight (8) SAEs occurring 
in seven patients were judged to be definitely related to the study device and/or surgery, including six infections (in five patients), one skin 
erosion over the extension wires, and one post-operative seizure. The remainder of SAEs were attributed to the primary mood disorder and

deemed unrelated to the device or active stimulation; i.e., there appeared to be no clear temporal relationship between the onset and 
resolution of these events and the initiation or adjustment of stimulation. There were two deaths by suicide in the study; both were in the 
Control group during the 6-month open-label phase. No unanticipated device related adverse events were reported. No episodes of hypomania 
or mania occurred during the study. There were no adverse neuropsychological effects at 6 or 12 months; a full description of 
neuropsychological findings will be reported separately. No side effects occurred with DBS programming, and no parameter adjustments were 
required due to side effects following a parameter change.   
 
Ten out of 90 participants receiving DBS system implantation terminated the study early (five prior to the primary endpoint/six-month 
visit and five before the 12-month visit). Six early exits were due to adverse events (worsening depression [n=1], suicide attempt [n=1], increased 
suicidal ideation with failed “rescue” (see Methods) [n=1], death by suicide [n=2], and head pain [n=1]). Three early exits were due to patient 
preference and one was due to the sponsor closing the study. Four out of the 10 subjects that exited the study early chose to have the device 
fully explanted shortly after study exit.  
 
 
Response predictors 
 
No demographic or clinical characteristics were associated with 6 month, 12 month or 24 month response or remission rates. Presence 
of melancholic features, duration of illness and/or current episode, history of ECT did not differ between responders and nonresponders at any 
time point. Eventual responders versus non-responders did not differ in use or change in psychotherapy, medications or stimulation parameter 
adjustments. No systematic difference in electrode placement between responders and non-responders was identified, consistent with prior

studies.18, 19 Additionally, distance between actual vs. planned target placement did not differ significantly between eventual responders versus 
nonresponders, and there were no significant differences between sites in accuracy of electrode placement. Although not statistically significant, 
it was noted that nonresponders tended to have an electrode placement that was more posterior and inferior to that of responders based on 
review by two experts (HSM, RG, CH).  
 
Discussion 
 
This study helps confirm the feasibility and safety of SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS as a treatment for TRDtreatment-resistant depression 
patients. However, this study failed to demonstrate that six months of active versus sham stimulation was associated with statistically significant 
antidepressant effects. Additionally, participants initially treated with sham stimulation during the first six months of the study did not show 
statistically significant antidepressant benefit with an additional six months of open-label active stimulation. In participants with up to two years 
of open-label active DBS stimulation, 48% achieved an antidepressant response and 25% achieved remission. These long-term outcomes are 
clinically meaningful, similar to those seen in earlier open-label studies and greater than would be expected with treatment-as-usual in this 
highly treatment-refractory patient population.12  
 
These findings are disappointing given the encouraging data from earlier open-label studies of SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS, and no 
demographic or clinical characteristics were associated with response versus nonresponse. However, it is noted that participants in this study 
had an average current episode duration of about 12 years. This is much longer than the average duration of current episode in prior 
SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS studies (approximately five years)3, 6 and may have contributed to the low overall response rate. Although 
  
 
SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS has shown enduring, open-label efficacy in chronic depression,4, 6 it is possible that this intervention is less effective 
for patients with extremely chronic depression. 
 
Interpreting these findings must also consider study design. For studies of invasive interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders, placebo 
effects can be surprisingly high and may actually be quite long-lasting.20, 21 However, the placebo response rate in this study was not significantly 
greater than what was anticipated; in fact it was lower than projected. Indeed, the major difference in this study compared to prior 
SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS studies was the lower response rate to active stimulation during the blinded phase of the study. Again, this may be 
due to the more chronic nature of disease in this cohort compared to prior samples. Additionally, it is not uncommon for the response to active 
treatment to be lower in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial than in open-label studies. Additionally, As prior studies and data from 
this cohort suggest delayed and progressive antidepressant effects over time with SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS. Therefore, , it is possible that 
differences in benefit between active and sham stimulation may not be seen until after one to two years of treatment in this group. However, 
such a time frame makes sham-controlled studies much more challenging. Other study designs may need to be considered, such as open-label 
stimulation followed by blinded discontinuation.22  
 
 Targeting for this study was based on an algorithm derived from early SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS studies.18 Neurosurgical placement 
of the DBS electrodes, based on this algorithm, was highly accurate and did not differ between eventual responders and nonresponders. 
However, gross anatomical placement of SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS electrodes may not be adequate for optimal treatment delivery. Recently, 
important subtleties in electrode placement have been described based on the white matter tracts impacted.19 These data suggest that, for 
maximal efficacy, the active SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS electrode must be placed such that it impacts a critical network of white matter tracts 
  
 
connecting key brain regions, including the forceps minor, cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. It is notable that SCC DBS responders in this 
study tended to have a more anterior and superior electrode placement compared to nonresponders – a placement that, in theory, would be 
more likely to allow direct stimulation of the forceps minor. Therefore, it is possible that prospective targeting based on individual DTI 
tractography could optimize SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS electrode placement.23, 24  
 
Given the strength of the preliminary data leading to this study, and the emerging data suggesting ways to optimize targeting for this 
intervention, the negative outcome of this trial should not be simply interpreted as a failure of SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS for TRDtreatment-
resistant depression. Subsequent studies are merited to determine whether active SCCsubcallosal cingulate DBS failed to differentiate from 
sham due to clinical features of the patient population (e.g., extremely chronic depression) or suboptimal electrode placement. Additionally, 
identification and use of a physiological metric to verify engagement of the appropriate neural circuit could assist with targeting. Importantly, 
the long term response and remission rates in this and prior studies suggest that this intervention continues to have promise.

9. Please provide the appendix as a pdf file with numbered pages. 
***This is supplied as a separate document. 
 
10. One of my editorial colleagues requested:  please add to the discussion the fact that methods vary a 
lot between DBS trials so can't really say they work / don't work as a general rule unless you know the 
methods, as they are very heterogenous and perhaps some techniques work and others don't. E.g., “the 
methods could use more info on precise lead localisation measurements, types of electrodes used, how 
variability between surgeons was rated, etc. Or, if this level of detail is not available, the discussion 
could use a bit on how things like missing the target, variability between surgeons, etc could have 
affected the outcome.” 
 
***More detail is provided on the parameters of the electrode array and targeting. As described in the 
manuscript, lead placement was assessed by a team of experts; in four cases, leads were repositioned 
due to inadequate placement. This team of experts also identified the optimal sequence of contacts to 
be used for active/sham stimulation; this is now described in more detail. We did perform a post-hoc 
imaging analysis of lead placement and location of the contacts used for stimulation. In terms of gross 
anatomical location, there was no statistically significant difference in lead placement between 
responders and nonresponders. This is described in the last paragraph of the results section. 
 
***Results for all secondary outcome measures are now provided in Supplementary Tables S2-S8.  
 
Reviewer #2: 
 
1. I think these results deserve some more discussion than it currently receives. On p.16 the authors 
state: "Indeed, the major difference in this study compared to prior SCC DBS studies was the lower 
response rate to active stimulation during the blinded phase of the study." I completely agree with this 
statement, but the authors explain this difference by stating "(…) it is possible that differences in benefit 
between active and sham stimulation may not be seen until after one to two years of treatment". 
However, I miss a direct comparison between this study and previous open-label studies. For instance, in 
Lozano et al (2008, Biological Psychiatry) the response rate after 6 months was 60% (12/20), in 
Holtzheimer et al (2012, Archives of General Psychiatry), response was 58,9% (10/17), in Puigdemont et 
al (2012, Internation Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology) it was 87.5% (7/8). These are all 
substantially higher response rates, which did not take 1-2 years to reach. Even after 6 months of open-
label stimulation in this study (i.e. the 12-month point), the response rates were approximately 30% in 
both groups. Could the authors discuss this point some more? Might there be some essential differences 
with these open-label studies, e.g. other ways of DBS programming or more supportive or 
psychotherapeutic sessions? 
 
***We share the reviewers perplexity, yet it is not uncommon for placebo-controlled studies to show 
lower response rates to active treatment compared to prior open-label studies (please refer to the VNS 
studies in depression, where placebo-controlled response rates to active VNS over 3 months was half of 
what was seen in the prior open-label study). However, this alone does not fully explain the overall 
lower response rate even at the later time points. It is plausible that the more chronic nature of these 
patients compared to prior samples plays some role, as this cohort has a notably longer duration of the 
index episode compared to the average duration of other published small studies. These points have 
been emphasized in the discussion.

2. One explanation given in the discussion is the longer episode duration. Do you have any evidence 
from this study that patients with shorter episode duration responded better or faster? If so, could this 
be added to the paper? 
 
***In this study, episode duration did not correlate with response, and we likely did not have the power 
to adequately test for this. However, it is notable that this sample had, on average, a much longer 
duration of current episode than in previous studies. This may have impacted the response rate to active 
stimulation, but this is purely speculative at this point.  
 
3. In addition to the long episode duration, Table 1 shows participants in the active group are on average 
67.73 years (3.8) and in the control group 67.37 years (3.29). This means the patients in this study are on 
average 20 years older than the patients in the open-label studies. I think this and its possible influence 
on the results should be mentioned in the discussion. 
 
***This was an error in the original table. This has been corrected. 
 
4. The response rates do seem to increase after one year of open-label stimulation to approximately 
50% (i.e. at the 18-month point). On p.14, the authors state: "Stimulation parameter, medication and/or 
psychotherapy changes were allowed during the follow-up study, but these changes, when they 
occurred, had no discernible impact on efficacy over time." Could the authors explain how this was 
measured or analyzed, and also add this analysis to the manuscript? Can the authors give any indication 
what did cause the increase in response rates? 
 
***Below we provide a full description of the data analyses, and we have added this to the results 
section. We defer to the editors whether to include all of this text in the manuscript. As stated in the 
original manuscript, neither stimulation parameter nor medication changes were associated with 
efficacy for the first two phases of the study (6 month sham-controlled phase and 6 month open-label 
phase). However, an analysis of the 18-30 month period (when all participants had received active 
stimulation for 12-24 months) did show that stimulation parameter changes associated with efficacy 
(including reevaluating contact location and stimulating at a single contact (different from the initial 
optimal contact)). Details of the analyses include: 
 
“For the first 12 months data, a generalized linear mixed effects model was fitted that included 
treatment group, medication change and stimulation parameter change at each follow-up visit as 
independent fixed effects, subject as a random effect and responder status at each follow-up visit as the 
dependent variable. Neither stimulation parameter change nor medication change were associated with 
response rate (p=0.2176 and p=0.4891, respectively). Separately, a generalized linear mixed effects 
model was fitted for the 18-30 months data (open-label stimulation) that included medication change 
and stimulation parameter change at each follow-up visit as independent fixed effects, subject as a 
random effect and responder status at each follow-up visit as the dependent variable. Stimulation 
parameter change was associated with increased response rate (p=0.0127), but medication change was 
not (p=0.3955).” 
 
5. Some details of the surgery and target localization (p.6) were a bit unclear. Which electrodes were 
implanted and how many contacts did the electrode have? How was the targeting done (by use of an 
anatomical landmark or axon bundles?) and can you give a short description of where the contacts were 
approximately placed? If possible, could you add a figure or schematic of a typical placement? On p.6 
 4 
 
the following remark is made: "(…) using the standard stereotactic surgical procedures at each site." 
Were there any systematic differences between sites? 
 
***Details on the electrode array/lead and target selection have been added to the Methods. The same 
targeting approach was used at every site; differences in stereotactic surgical procedures between sites 
did not affect target selection or location of the implanted leads and primarily involved the surgeon’s 
preference regarding details of the procedure unrelated to target placement (e.g., location of scalp 
incision, angle of lead insertion).  
 
6. In addition, I had some question on the DBS programming (p.7). I understand no more than four 
different settings (4, 6 and 8 mA and addition of contact?) were allowed and no changes were made 
after 10 weeks. What happened in case of side effects? Did you change it to a previous setting or was a 
setting in between allowed?  
 
***In the case of side effects, parameters could be changed to those used previously. However, this 
occurred in no cases. (But, this clarification has been added to the manuscript.) 
 
7. And assuming the use of a 4-contact electrode, why was decided not to try different contacts besides 
these two contacts? 
 
***This has been clarified by providing a more detailed description of targeting, as above. Prior studies 
of SCC DBS strongly suggested that the optimal contact for chronic stimulation was the contact best 
situated in the subcallosal cingulate white matter. The contact selection was guided by this. The contact 
best situated in the SCC white matter was selected as the first contact to be used. The contact next best 
situated in the SCC white matter was selected as the second contact to be added. In no case were the 
third or fourth contacts situated in or near the SCC white matter so there were never considered as 
viable options for long term stimulation. Additionally, due to the experience that antidepressant effects 
of SCC DBS occur over weeks to months, we chose to limit parameter changes to the first 10 weeks of 
the study, and this necessarily limited the number of steps included in the algorithm.  
 
8. Furthermore, no DBS parameters were changed in case of >10% decrease on MADRS. Does this mean: 
once >10% decrease has been achieved, DBS parameters were fixed? Or could amplitude be increased 
two weeks later, if no further improvement had been achieved? As a concrete example: if a patient 
decreases from 40 to 36 on the MADRS on 4 mA after 2 weeks, is the amplitude fixed on 4 mA, or did 
you have the opportunity to increase to 6 mA if the patient did not show further improvement in the 
weeks after? 
 
***As described in the methods, the 10% MADRS change was assessed based on the previous MADRS 
assessment. So yes, the amplitude could continue to be increased if the MADRS following 4 weeks was 
less than 10% lower than the MADRS at 4 weeks’ time point.  
 
9. Table 3 presents the responder rates. At 18, 24 and 30 months percentages are presented out of a 
total of 52 and 25 patients. What about the 8 and 5 dropping out? Were these responders / non-
responders? Could the authors add the intent-to-treat percentages (e.g. by using the response status at 
last follow-up)? 
 
***The response rates presented are the intent-to-treat percentages. Of the eight patients that dropped 
out of the Active group, all were nonresponders at all time points up to the 12 month endpoint. Of the 
 5 
 
five patients that dropped out of the Control group, three were nonresponders at all time points up to 
the 12 month endpoint. One was a responder at 3, 6, and 9 months, but not at the 12 month endpoint. 
One was a responder at the 9 month time point but not at any other time point. We believe this level of 
detail is not needed in the manuscript. However, we have added the following to the Results section: 
“Eight participants from the Active group and five participants from the Control group dropped out; all 
were nonresponders at the 12 month endpoint.”  
 
Reviewer #3: 
 
1. Why did the authors choose MADRS rather than the more standard (eg in the pilot papers) HAMD? 
Table 2 is missing HAMD data from months 9 and 12 and it's not explained why. 
 
***The MADRS was chosen as the primary measure because it has been shown to be unifactorial, hence 
more sensitive to symptom change. Per the protocol, the HAMD and several other secondary measures 
were were only administered every 6 months per the FDA approved protocol.  
 
2. Authors state that expert consultants selected optimal contact sequences for monopolar stimulation. 
What constituted an optimal sequence? Proximity to anatomic SCC? 
 
***The optimal sequence essentially included the first and second contacts best situated in or near the 
SCC white matter. Please see response to Reviewer 2 above. More detail on targeting has been added to 
the Methods, as described above.  
 
3. Did the authors assess the effect, if any, of cumulative stimulation dose, i.e compare outcomes of 
those who were stimulated the longest compared to the shortest? 
 
***Response and remission rates increased over time, though a few participants responded sooner than 
others. From the data collected, there is no meaningful way to assess the effect of cumulative dose 
beyond noting that antidepressant efficacy increased over time in the sample. 
 
4. I would consider removing or re-wording the line in the Discussion that intervention may be less 
effective in the extremely chronically depressed. The authors state in the preceding paragraph that no 
demographic or other features predicted clinical response to DBS, and duration of illness is an illness 
feature. For many in the psychiatry community, brain surgery ought to be specifically for patients who 
are extremely chronically depressed, to justify it's risk and invasiveness. Is this not the very definition of 
TRD? 
 
***We included this comment to reflect the difference in duration of current episode between this 
current cohort and the samples enrolled in prior studies of SCC DBS for TRD. We do believe this is a 
potential explanation for active DBS not achieving a mean effect as large as that seen in prior studies. If 
SCC DBS were clinically available, we do not think this comment implies that it should not be considered 
for patients with extremely chronic depression. However, this should perhaps be considered as a 
potentially negative prognostic factor (as it currently is when considering ECT and TMS).  
 
5. Only one reference is made to DBS trials done at targets other than the SCC. Several have been tried, 
including the VC/VS, NAcc, Habenula, and MFB. In addition SCC DBS has been tried in different 
indications, including bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa. Do the authors feel a different target 
should be tried? Why or why not? 
 6 
 
 
***We feel it is most appropriate to focus this manuscript on the findings of this trial. We believe it is 
beyond the scope of this manuscript to weigh in on the relatively strengths of the various DBS targets 
for TRD, and that this discussion is more appropriate for a commentary or later review. However, we 
defer to the editors on this and would be happy to include more discussion on this point if the editors 
feel it would strengthen the manuscript.  
 
Reviewer #4: 
 
1. It is a little frustrating that the authors did not ensure a more similar patient population to prior 
studies. 
 
***As noted above, the age of this sample was incorrectly reported in the previous manuscript. The 
mean age for this sample is similar to that of prior studies. All other clinical features are also similar to 
previous studies except for duration of current episode. This was unanticipated, since no limits for 
episode duration were used in prior studies, and therefore the same approach was used in this study. 
This approach unexpectedly resulted in a sample with a longer mean duration of current episode than 
seen in prior studies.  
 
2. Despite no advantage of 6 months DBS when comparing to sham to active, transition to open-label 
DBS showed marked improvement over 2 years. It is unclear whether there are significant differences 
when compared to baseline in this open-label phase but this would be worth indicating. 
 
***There was an overall statistically significant within group decrease in depression severity over time. 
This comment has been added to the manuscript in the Results section.  
 
2. It is certainly reasonable that a microlesion effect was durable and that a better design would have 
been open-label stimulation followed by blinded discontinuation as the authors indicated as the authors 
indicate. 
 
***We agree that this is an interesting alternative design. However, this was not the FDA-approved 
protocol for this study.  
 
3. Could there not have been a significant change between groups because there was frequent, 
supportive contact (every 1-2 weeks) from the study team?  Any involvement in clinical trials has been 
found to improve outcomes in patients across disciplines.  
 
***This is indeed possible, though the change in depression severity over the first 6 months in the sham 
group was not dramatic.  
 
4. Might the clinical scales used not be sensitive to detect a clinically meaningful effect in very ill 
subjects? 
 
***It is possible that the MADRS may not capture the meaningful symptom change in these very ill 
patients. However, the use of standard depression rating scales is typically expected from the field at 
large, and especially the FDA. 
 
 7 
 
5. Interestingly, this study was like the Reclaim VC/VS depression study in that it used the MADRS, 
showed no effect, and was halted by study sponsor. Also, could lack of more robust response be the 
result of not changing DBS settings after 10 weeks? 
 
***This is possible. However, we chose to err in favor of longer stimulation time at what were deemed 
to be optimal settings (based on prior studies) versus additional settings changes that would not have 
allowed for a longer period of stimulation at the final parameters.  
 
6. The authors indicate that the demographics did not impact outcome - I was curious however how 
closely they looked at sex differences? 
 
***Change in primary and secondary measures were compared between men and women in the study 
and were not found to be statistically significantly different. A logistic regression model was used to 
examine the effect of treatment (Stimulation or Control) while adjusting for the baseline demographic 
variables (study site, level of treatment resistance as defined by ATHF criteria and baseline MADRS). 
Based on the logistic regression model results, gender did not impacted the outcomes (p=0.3164). The 
full model for the primary outcome measure (MADRS) is provided below and is now included as 
Supplementary Table S1.

7. The inclusion of patients with medication-free or stable regimens for only >4 weeks may have been 
too little? 
 
***Presuming the reviewer means that 4 weeks of medication stability may be too short for “true” 
stability, we partially agree. However, for clinical and practical reasons, a longer period of stability was 
deemed not feasible. Also, a four week period of medication stability is common in depression clinical 
trials, including studies of patients with TRD.  
 
8. Did revision patients have any difference in outcomes on average? There were 4 revisions. Would be 
interesting to know if there was a more robust lesion effect in these revisions as well. The authors have 
not proven that DBS is better than implant alone, so ruling out lesion effects by looking at patients with 
perhaps MORE robust lesion effects would help. 
 
***There was no difference in efficacy in patients with and without revisions. In these 4 revisions, 3 
were in the control group and 1 was in the treatment group. Their responder status at each visit was 
summarized in the below table.

Within the control group, a logistic model which included an indicator of system revision as independent 
variable and responder status at 6M as dependent variable was fitted to the data. It shows that there 
was no difference in efficacy in patients with and without system revisions (p-value = 0.2817).  A 
generalized linear mixed-effect model was fitted to the longitudinal data and it shows that was no 
difference in long-term efficacy in patients with and without system revision (p=0.6792).  
 
 9 
 
9. Given this staggered randomized onset design, were revision patients in each group? 
***Yes. 
10. Why wouldn't the treatment/control groups be of the same size? They were 2:1 I believe - is this 
ethically driven as more patients in the experimental group will be exposed to potential therapy earlier 
on? 
 
***In consultation with the FDA, this design was chosen to reduce the chances of patients receiving 
sham treatment. Statistical analyses accounted for this difference in group size.  
 
11. For patients who needed increase in mA during the blinded phase, were there outcome differences? 
 
***There were not.  
 
12. Are certain patients simply super responsive but those who don't respond at a low dose, don't 
respond or worsen at a higher dose? This would support a blinded randomization of responders. 
 
***This is unknown, and the study was not designed to test this.  
 
13. How many subjects worsened and moved to open label? 
 
***None.  
 
14. How many had revisions were in the control group? 
 
***There were 4 subjects who had revisions: 3 were in the control group and 1 was in the stimulation 
group.  
 
15. To me it seems disease stability is necessary before interpreting a stimulated response. Shouldn't the 
investigators have waited until the subjects returned to a predefined baseline? It seems patients in the 
control group were improving as I am sure the stimulated group would have had they not been 
stimulated. I recognize it must be challenging to wait and funding was likely a major limitation, but if 
patients are on a downward trend in disease severity without stimulation, I feel the design 
compromised any interpretation of stimulation induced effects on depression severity. Some discussion 
is needed on this. 
 
***This is an interesting design option, but again, this was not the protocol approved by the FDA. A 
more standard, prospective, randomized, controlled trial was deemed to be most appropriate for testing 
the hypotheses, especially given the state of the field at the time the study was designed. This is already 
mentioned in the discussion.  
 
16. "Stimulation parameter, medication and/or psychotherapy changes were allowed during the follow-
up study, but these changes, when they occurred, had no discernible impact on efficacy over time." How 
was this confirmed to be true? 
 
***Please see the response to Reviewer 2 above.   
 
 10 
 
17. "However, it is noted that participants in this study had an average current episode duration of 
about 12 years. This is much longer than the average duration of current episode in prior SCC DBS 
studies (approximately five years)3, 6." But this wasn't significant as a correlation, right? The authors 
seem to be looking for trends (and I understand why) but they stated previously that demographics did 
not impact outcome. Have they consulted with a statistician to ensure these correlations were not 
significant? 
 
***As stated in the manuscript, there was no correlation between duration of current episode and 
efficacy in this study; this was indeed confirmed by statistical analyses. It is possible we did not have 
power to show an association of episode duration and efficacy. However, this sample, as a whole, had a 
mean duration of current episode much longer than prior studies which we believe is an important point 
to note as a potential explanation for why patients in this study were less responsive to active DBS than 
in prior trials.  
 
18. "It is notable that SCC DBS responders in this study tended to have a more anterior and superior 
electrode placement compared to nonresponders - a placement that, in theory, would be more likely to 
allow direct stimulation of the forceps minor. Therefore, it is possible that prospective targeting based 
on individual DTI tractography could optimize SCC DBS electrode placement." I agree - but wonder why 
this targeting is such a challenge across institutions. It is a bit concerning that if targeting is difficult, that 
this potential therapy could not be broadly adopted. I suspect this is not the case, but it would provide 
clarity if the authors could explain why this error occurred despite the training they claimed was 
performed. 
 
***Since lead placement did not differ significantly (only a slight trend) between responders and 
nonresponders, we have taken this statement out of the manuscript. Regarding surgical targeting, there 
are a number of reasons why this might vary within and between sites. A full discussion of this is beyond 
the scope of this manuscript. To be clear, there was no systematic error in targeting and this is described 
in the last paragraph of the results section.   
 
Reviewer #5: 
 
1. This study mainly reported descriptive statistics and simple comparison results between means. 
Multilevel modeling is a standard analysis method for longitudinal data, which is known to be more 
powerful than simple comparison between two time points. In the Section Statistical Consideration and 
Data Analysis, a logistic regression model was mentioned. However it is not clear what is the outcome 
variable in this logistic regression. Was it used to examine responders versus non-responders? No results 
from this logistic regression were reported in the Results Section. 
 
***The full logistic regression model is provided above in response to Reviewer 4. This is now included 
in the supplementary information as Table S1.  
 
2. Efficacy measures were collected at baseline (weeks 4, 6, ad 8) and at months 4, 5, and 6. To evaluate 
efficacy, average of 3 baseline MADRS assessments and average of months 4, 5, and 6 were used. For 
this type of longitudinal data, it is a common practice to use multilevel modeling to examine the change 
trajectory. The stimulation group can be added as a moderator to see whether the trajectory is 
significantly different between the two groups. Multilevel modeling has advantages of handling missing 
data and is known to be a more powerful analysis method than simple averaging. 
 
 11 
 
***A linear mixed effects model was constructed which included treatment group and visit as fixed 
effects and subject as a random effect and was fitted to the MADRS assessment over the first 12 months 
(Figure 2 in the manuscript). It shows that MADRS decreased over time (p-value <0.0001) in both groups 
and the Control group have a 2.95 point higher MADRS score across all visits as compared to the 
Stimulation group (p=0.0038), however there was no significant difference in change over time between 
the groups. A similar model was fitted to the GAF and it shows that GAF improved over time (p-value 
<0.0001) in both groups and there was no difference between two groups over time (p=0.2417).

4. When examining long-term outcomes, it makes more sense to run multilevel models for data shown 
in Figure 3. Words describing change trajectories such as "efficacy over time" and "temporal 
relationship" appeared several times in the paper. It seems that the authors were trying to investigate 
the change trajectory. If so, I strongly recommend multilevel modeling as an effective approach for 
longitudinal data. 
 
***Please see the above responses.  
 
Reviewer #7: 
 
1. To my mind, using a responder criteria of 40% improvement is problematic. I realize that 40% 
improvement in this refractory population is significant. However, essentially ALL prior depression 
studies use 50% improvement as a measure of response. For example, you reference Lozano (2012) 
which is reference #7. Using 50% criteria, the one year response rate in that study was 29%. With the 
40% criteria, it was 62%! The more lenient criteria makes comparison to prior and future studies highly 
problematic. A greater explanation needs to be given for choosing this threshold. It also makes 
 12 
 
comparison to the only other sham controlled trial (Dougherty, 2015, Reclaim) very difficult. In looking 
at that study, there appear to be a number of patients who would be responders at 2 years at 40%, but 
were not at 50%. I'm not sure how to resolve this given that the 40% threshold was chosen a priori. I 
would like to see the response rate results given for the 50% threshold as well, if for nothing more than 
comparative purposes. At a minimum, the difference has to be completely clear when comparing to 
prior studies. It also needs to be very clearly addressed in the discussion. 
 
*** The requested 50% response rate data has been added to the table. 
 
2. Per Table 1, the mean age in this study was over 67 years. I'm assuming this is an error, given that the 
inclusion criteria were ages 21-70. My apologies if I am misreading the Table. Please explain. Obviously, 
an average age of 67 would make this population dramatically different than other DBS studies or your 
own open label trials. 
 
***This was an error in the Table and has been corrected. The mean age of this group is very similar to 
prior studies of DBS for TRD.  
 
3. Please provide mean reductions in MADRS scores and increases in GAF scores for Figure 3. These 
appear to be much less than in prior open-label studies. This would allow for some direct comparison to 
other studies that used different response threshold criteria. I would also suggest adding a 2-year time 
point for Table 2. 
 
***Since not all patients at 12 months entered the long-term follow-up study, we deemed it not 
appropriate to put the 2 year data in Table 2 and the Figures. Long term effects are presented in Table 3. 
As discussed in the manuscript, the change over time with active stimulation is less than that seen in 
prior studies. We do not believe reporting the percent change in MADRS and GAF adds much to the 
presentation of results since these could easily be calculated from the data presented. However, we 
defer to the editors on this, and could easily add these to Table 2 (though we feel this would make the 
table much more visually complicated).  
 
4. How was your stimulation adjustment paradigm arrived at? Was it based on data from prior studies or 
more on clinical experience? Please explain. 
 
***This was based on prior studies showing that a single contact in the SCC white matter was sufficient 
for antidepressant benefit and that no more than 8 mA was typically needed to achieve effects.  
 
5. The first paragraph of the discussion states that response/remission rates here are similar to open 
label studies. This really isn't true, especially when the 40% threshold is considered. Please rephrase. 
 
***This sentence has been revised.  
 
6. The only other sham controlled trial of DBS in TRD(Dougherty, 2015) isn't even referenced in the 
discussion. Granted, it is a different target. However, it appears to have a very similar design, and many 
similarities in the results. It is critical to emphasize and discuss why two sham controlled studies based 
on solid open label data both failed to demonstrate efficacy. This group of highly experienced authors 
must at least comment on where this treatment sits after these two trials and where the field goes from 
here. 
 
 13 
 
***We believe it is beyond the scope of this paper to comment on the other sham-controlled trial given 
the major differences between these studies (different targets, different time points, different 
programming paradigms, etc.). To us, this discussion seems more appropriate for a commentary or 
review. We have focused this manuscript on describing the results of this clinical trial and prefer to defer 
to others on placing this in the broader context of DBS for TRD. However, we see this as an editorial 
decision. If the editors believe that this discussion should be added to this manuscript, we will add it.  
 
7. Were both suicides on active stimulation at the time of suicide? Please clarify. 
 
***As stated in the results, both deaths by suicide occurred in the Control group during the open-label 
phase, so both patients were receiving active stimulation but had previously received sham stimulation.  
 
8. One patient was exited due to sponsor study closure. Was this decision forced upon the patient or did 
they concur with exiting? Did they want to continue but weren't able? This concern has been brought up 
in several ethics commentaries on DBS. It's a crucial point when designing future studies and what the 
funding agencies will be responsible for. Please clarify and discuss. 
 
***This patient was exited from the 12-month study but was enrolled in the long-term follow-up study. 
Therefore, the sponsor continues to provide care related to DBS for this patient.  
 
9. Please explain why a 2:1 randomization was chosen. 
 
***In consultation with the FDA, this design was chosen to reduce the chances of patients receiving 
sham treatment. Statistical analyses accounted for this difference in group size.

 Introduction 
Depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is a serious medical 
illness that affects a person’s physical and mental state.  When a person is 
clinically depressed, his or her ability to function both mentally and physically is 
drastically affected. This impaired functional and symptomatic state may last for 
weeks, months, or even years. Typical symptoms of depression include: an 
"empty" feeling, sadness and anxiety, tiredness, lack of energy or interest in 
activities, sleep disturbances, including early morning awakening or oversleeping, 
and thoughts of death or suicide, a suicide attempt.  These problems can become 
chronic or recurrent and lead to substantial impairments in an individual’s ability to 
take care of their daily responsibilities.  MDD is one of the leading causes of 
disability in the United States and established market economies worldwide 
(Murray et al. 1996). The World Health Organization (2006) estimates that at its 
worst, depression can lead to suicide, a tragic fatality associated with 
approximately 850,000 lives every year.   
Major depressive disorder affects approximately 9.9 million American adults or 
about 5.0 percent of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year (Narrow 
1998).  While MDD can develop at any age, the average age of onset is the mid-
20s (American Psychiatric Association – APA, 1994).  Among this disease 
population, a large number of patients are consistently resistant to the many and 
different therapies utilized to treat depression.  This subgroup is diagnosed as 
having treatment resistant depression (TRD) and treatment alternatives are 
desperately needed for this growing population of severely depressed patients.  
Modern brain imaging technologies are revealing that in depression, neural circuits 
responsible for the regulation of moods, thinking, sleep, appetite, and behavior fail 
to function properly, and that critical neurotransmitters—chemicals used by nerve 
cells to communicate—are out of balance (Nestler et al. 2002).  Genetic research 
indicates that vulnerability to depression results from the influence of multiple 
genes acting together with environmental factors (NIMH Genetics Workgroup).  
Ongoing studies of brain chemistry and of mechanisms of action with 
antidepressant medications continue to inform the development of new and better 
treatments.  
Antidepressant medications are widely used and often partially effective treatments 
for depression (Mulrow et al. 1998).  Available antidepressant drugs influence the 
functioning of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, primarily serotonin and 
norepinephrine, known as monoamines. Older medications such as tricyclic 
antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), affect the 
activity of both of these neurotransmitters simultaneously. The disadvantage of 
these older medications is that they can be difficult to tolerate due to side effects 
or, in the case of MAOIs, dietary and medication restrictions.  Newer medications, 
such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective 
serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), appear to have fewer side 
effects than the older drugs, making it easier for patients to adhere to treatment. 
Unfortunately, no single medication is effective for all depressed patients as

various groups of patients will respond to one drug while other patients will require 
different agents.  Fava (2003) states that treatment resistant depression typically 
refers to an occurrence of an inadequate response following adequate 
antidepressant therapy among patients suffering from unipolar depressive 
disorders; which further shows that adequate treatment strategy is extremely 
difficult for this group of depressed patients. A recent, overall assessment of the 
nation’s largest real world study of treatment-resistant depression (Sequenced 
Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression – STAR*D) suggests that a patient 
with persistent depression can get well after trying multiple treatment strategies, 
but his or her odds of “beating” depression lessen as additional strategies are 
needed (Rush et al. 2006).  The STAR*D study, which has studied thousands of 
patients, further proves that the task of finding the correct treatment for severely 
depressed patients, can be extremely daunting.   
Certain types of psychotherapy can be an effective treatment option for 
depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) 
have shown to be particularly useful. Approximately two thirds of adults with 
depression improve when they receive appropriate treatment with medication, 
psychotherapy, or the combination (Hollon et al. 2006), whereas only one third of 
treatments result in a full remission. 
Despite available pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatments, a large 
number of depressed patients do not have an acceptable or sustained response to 
these treatments.  Despite the advances in brain-neurobiology research and the 
growing number of available antidepressant therapies, fewer than 50% of these 
patients achieve remission, and up to 20% develop treatment resistant depression 
(Kennedy & Lam, 2003). Not only do these patients remain treatment resistant, 
they are also chronically and severely disabled.   
For these severely ill patients who do not respond to psychotherapy and 
medication, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), is often prescribed.  Although this 
therapy has been shown to have short-term efficacy, many patients experience 
acute or sustained side effects as a result of the feature (Fink, 2001).  Some 
patients indicate memory loss which can occur for days, weeks and even months 
after ECT sessions. More recently, other somatic interventions such as 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) 
have become available, although sustained response rates are relatively modest 
according to research studies.   
Although still investigational, the rTMS method appears to only provide temporary 
relief of symptoms; thus many aspects will need to be refined for programming 
parameters and targeting of regional locations when utilizing this technology, if it is 
ultimately approved by FDA.  A recent FDA panel meeting addressing rTMS’ 
safety and efficacy, showed that rTMS has a favorable safety profile but did not 
show efficacy at the specific primary endpoint of the clinical trial.  The FDA panel 
recommended to FDA that this therapy not be approved for the treatment of Major 
Depressive Disorder (FDA Panel Meeting, January 2007).   
Alternatively, vagus nerve stimulation has been used for the indication of Epilepsy

in the United States since 1997 (George 2000 and Sackeim et al. 2007).  Due to 
the fact that many epileptic drugs also work for bipolar depressed patients, there 
was belief that there may be a correlation in the disease process between these 
two conditions (Elger 2000).  These hypotheses led to clinical trials researching the 
use of the VNS system for major depressive disorder.   VNS was ultimately 
evaluated and approved by the FDA in July of 2005, for the adjunctive long-term 
treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients 18 years of age and older, 
who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate 
response to four or more adequate antidepressant treatments (Cyberonics 
Labeling).  VNS is now one of the limited new options for this depressed, treatment 
resistant patient population.  Although this therapy was recently approved by the 
FDA, longer-term, well designed clinical trials are needed to confirm the safety and 
efficacy of this treatment alternative.  Furthermore, since the VNS device has 
shown limited efficacy in small numbers of patients, it has certainly not proven to 
be the ultimate solution for treatment of these severely depressed patients.  
For the most severely, treatment resistant of these patients, several invasive 
ablative neurosurgical procedures have also been available; although they are now 
infrequently used due to perceived side effects and the unfortunate irreversibility of 
the treatment.  Well-established procedures involve the production of lesions that 
interrupt distinct frontal-cingulate, fronto-striatal, and thalamo-frontal white matter 
tracts, resulting in therapeutic benefit for some patients (Cosgrove et al. 1995; and 
Sachdev and Sachdev, 2005). Several of these procedures, including subcaudate 
tractotomy, cingulotomy and anterior capsulotomy have been found to be effective 
in some patients, although all involve the permanent destruction of neural 
structures.  Furthermore, there is also a considerable time delay between surgery 
and symptom improvement.   
Recently, destructive procedures to treat Parkinson’s disease, such a 
thalamotomies and paladotomies have been replaced by applying high frequency 
electrical stimulation to these targets. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been 
found to have distinct advantages over ablation with the major advantage being its 
reversibility, as well as the option to modify specific stimulation parameters when 
necessary.  Pathological studies further demonstrate that chronic DBS produces 
little to no tissue damage (Haberler et al. 2000). In theory, DBS can be seen as a 
potentially safe, effective, flexible and reversible alternative to ablative surgery for 
treatment resistant depression, if the optimal target can be defined and evaluated.  
Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed changes in cortical (frontal, 
parietal), paralimbic (cingulate, insula) and subcortical (caudate, thalamus) activity 
following various types of treatments [medication, psychotherapy, sleep 
deprivation, ECT, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), ablative 
surgery] (Mayberg, 2003).  Normalization of frontal abnormalities (both increases 
and decreases) is the best-replicated finding. Decreases in paralimbic regions, 
while variable, are also consistently reported. While there is not yet a common 
pattern that characterizes depression remission across all of the available 
treatment modalities, medications and all of the available somatic treatments such 
as ablative surgery, TMS and VNS, changes have been seen in the paralimbic

regions. Specifically, changes have been found in the hippocampus and ventral 
medial frontal/cingulate areas, having known projections through specific 
subcaudate tracts (Mayberg et al. 2000).   
Regions affected by these white matter interruptions are widespread, as the 
subcaudate tractotomy is quite large.  Specific tracts are less well characterized, 
but likely involve connections linking orbital frontal, subgenual cingulate, ventral 
striatum/caudate, thalamus brainstem, hypothalamus and hippocampus/amygdala.  
The precise optimal target(s) within the subcaudate that mediate antidepressant 
response is not known at this time. However, imaging studies suggest that 
disturbances involving more specific connections between the subgenual cingulate 
and 
medial 
frontal, 
ventral 
striatum, 
anterior 
thalamus, 
hippocampus, 
hypothalamus and brainstem may be particularly critical (Seminowicz et al. 2004).  
Brodmann Area 25WM (BA25WM), also known as the subgenual cingulate region, 
subgenual white matter, or Cg25, has been shown to be involved in both acute 
sadness and antidepressant treatment effects; hence indicating its role in 
modulating mood states (Mayberg et al. 1999).  These findings further suggest that 
DBS may be most effective if these medial pathways are selectively modulated, as 
this hypothesis has been further verified in a preliminary study in treatment-
resistant depressed patients.  Mayberg et al. 2005, reported that in a small group 
of severe refractory depressed patients, DBS induced clinical response in 4 out of 
6 patients, with 2 patients achieving full remission. Although these preliminary 
findings are encouraging, much larger, controlled clinical trials are necessary to 
show the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation of Brodmann Area 25WM.    
Deep brain stimulation is considered safe, non-destructive and reversible. The 
frequency and severity of procedural risks and complications with DBS 
implantation for depression are expected to be similar to those for Parkinson’s 
Disease and Essential Tremor.  An extensive review of Manufacturer and User 
Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) reports, regarding deep brain stimulation 
from 1997 to present, has shown no evidence of tissue damage due to excessive 
electrical stimulation.  To date, over 30,000 Deep Brain Stimulation devices have 
been implanted worldwide. Furthermore, a recent paper by Haberler et al. (2000) 
concluded that chronic DBS, defined as continuous deep brain stimulaton for up to 
70 months, does not cause damage to neural tissue in Parkinson’s Disease 
patients when applied at therapeutic levels.   
Unfortunately, there are a limited number of new treatment options for the 
treatment resistant patient population.  Considering the severity of treatment 
resistant depression and its debilitating effect on patients’ and family’s lives, Deep 
Brain Stimulation provides an optimistic opportunity for significant symptom relief 
and potential quality of life improvement, with minimal risk.  Further, this evaluation 
of DBS’ safety and efficacy, gives patients with treatment resistant depression an 
additional treatment option.  The purpose of this proposed clinical study is to 
evaluate safety and efficacy of subgenual white matter (Brodmann Area 25WM) 
deep brain stimulation for the treatment of single or recurrent, Major Depressive 
Disorder, using standard psychiatric rating scales and questionnaires as outcome 
measures.

Study Design 
3.1 Design 
This study is designed as a prospective, multi-centered, double-blind, 
randomized, controlled 12-month pivotal study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of the ANS Libra®
 
 Deep Brain Stimulation System for patients with 
major depressive disorder who have failed at least 4 treatments in the current 
episode. The primary outcome assessment will occur at 6 months: however, 
all patients will be followed for 1 year. A total of 201 patients will be 
randomized from up to 20 sites. 
Each 
potential 
patient 
will 
be 
pre-screened 
according 
to 
the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  A narrative of what study participation entails, will 
be used to educate potential participants on study requirements. Prior to on-
site baseline evaluations, the patient will sign the informed consent. Patients 
will then undergo 3 baseline evaluations, with each of these evaluations to 
occur no less than 2 weeks apart from each other. The first 2 baseline visit 
evaluations will be performed by separate psychiatrists in order to confirm the 
patient’s diagnosis.  The patient must score an average ≥ 22 on the MADRS, 
across 3 evaluations.  All patients will be scheduled for surgery, to occur no 
less than two weeks and no more than 1 month after final baseline evaluation, 
to implant the ANS Libra® Deep Brain Stimulation system.  After device 
implantation, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups in a 2:1 ratio

(Active Treatment Group & Control Group).  
   
Group 1:
  
 DBS Active Treatment Group – implanted with investigational device 
and activated for stimulation. 
Group 2:
 
 DBS Control Group – implanted with investigational device, but will 
not receive active stimulation for the first 6 months of the study.  At the end of 
6 month visit, these patients will have the investigational device programmed 
and activated.    
After system implant (Week 0), the patient will return to clinic approximately 2 
weeks after surgery for evaluation and treatment randomization into either 
Group 1 or Group 2 (Group 1 = Active Treatment Group; Group 2 = Control 
Group).  Patient will then return to clinic for subsequent evaluations at 2 
weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 
7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, and 1 year post 
system implantation.

3.2 Baseline Evaluations  
A thorough review of medical records, over at least the previous two years for 
each patient, will be necessary to review treatment history and any non-
compliance to treatment issues.  These baseline measurements will be taken 
after the patient signs the informed consent and complies with all the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, prior to device implantation and randomization to 
treatment. Patient baseline measurements include the Montgomery and 
Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); the Hamilton Depression Rating 
Scale - 17 item (HRSD-17); the Self-Rated Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology (QIDS-SR); Subsection for cluster B personality disorder of 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SCID-II); 
Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE); the 30 
item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30); the Young Mania 
Rating Scale (YMRS); the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS); Global 
Assessment of Function (GAF); the short form Quality of Life Enjoyment and 
Satisfaction Questionnaire (QOL); Clinical Global Impression of Severity and 
Improvement (CGI); Patient Global Impression Index (PGI); Health and Labor 
Questionnaire (HLQ); Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Columbia 
Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Two different psychiatrists will 
confirm the diagnosis of MDD via DSM-IV-TR criteria. Previous medical 
history and psychiatric history will be assessed and recorded including the 
M.I.N.I. Plus, MMSE, and psychotherapy treatments.  A Neuropsychological 
Battery will be performed after Baseline #3 if patient has met MADRS study 
inclusion criteria. Portions of these baseline sessions may be videotaped.  An 
initial MRI will occur after Baseline #3 in order to (1) exclude patients 
presenting with brain abnormalities that might be contributing to severity and 
treatment resistance of depression or which would not be compatible with the 
surgery; and (2) to perform surgical lead placement targeting and surgical 
pre-planning.  
 
3.3 Justification for Study Design 
The normal study design to investigate the effect of treatment above and 
beyond natural history of the condition and the placebo effect is to perform a 
double blind, randomized controlled study. The present study design fits 
these criteria.  All patients will be implanted with the investigational device 
bilaterally within Brodmann Area 25WM, according to surgical procedure.  
The 2-arm study design will allow for a control group to be followed 
simultaneously with a treatment group.  The only difference between these 2 
groups will be that 1 group will be receiving active stimulation and the other 
group will not be receiving active stimulation.  We believe that this controlled 
study design will allow both within patient and between treatment group

Page 18 
comparisons of the effect of DBS on the successful reduction of symptoms 
from treatment resistant depression. 
 
We will require 3 separate psychiatric baseline evaluations to meet eligibility 
criteria.  Thus, no one person in the study will have the ability to judge if 
patients are diagnosed properly and meet the baseline scores to be part of 
this study; hence improving the consistency/reproducibility of the data for the 
study.  
 
The MADRS was chosen as the primary measurement tool because it has 
been shown to be unifactorial, hence more sensitive to symptom changes; 
has been demonstrated to have more individual items that have been shown 
to be sensitive to change; and is an easy scale to administer.   
 
A statistically significant greater number of patients who meet the response 
criteria according to MADRS, in the Deep Brain Stimulation group, than in the 
control group at 6 months, will demonstrate the benefit of Deep Brain 
Stimulation in the treatment resistant depression patient population.   A 
responder analysis will be performed on this data.  The primary endpoint 
criterion of 40% is a clinically meaningful benefit due to the protracted and 
disabling nature of this treatment resistant population (Rush et al. 2003; 
Nahas, 2005).   
 
We believe that this study design will effectively eliminate bias, by addressing 
the following concerns: 
 
1.  The selection criteria for the study will favor placebo non-responders, 
due to the fact that it naturally selects patients that have undergone 
multiple therapies with little success; 
2.  A control group will be used to prove the treatment effect; 
3.  Active stimulation will not be tested intraoperatively, in order to ensure 
that patient does not receive any response prior to randomization;  
4.  The Investigator will be blinded to which treatment the patient will 
receive in order to minimize bias; 
5.  The patient will be blinded to which treatment they will receive in order 
to minimize bias; 
6.  To help diminish placebo effect over time, all patients will be followed 
for 12 months and treatment effects will continue to be monitored;  
7.  All patients will be followed for 12 months post-implant and all willing 
patients will be followed at 6-month intervals after completing the 
study. 
Finally, a one year study is sufficient to determine safety and efficacy due to 
the nature of this device and the severity of the patient population.  This 
treatment is not a direct life saving intervention.  However, if this therapy is 
successful it will provide an alternative treatment to those patients who have 
tried all conventional therapies and failed.  In a select group of patients, this

treatment may be able to reduce the suicide rate and provide depressive 
symptom relief, thus drastically improving their quality of life.  In addition,  
previous device studies of this type that have been undertaken have 
demonstrated their treatment effect and supported their safety profile by 
supplying either 6-month, or 1-year of data to obtain PMA approval. We feel 
this study design supports the collection of valid scientific evidence to support 
a new device, seeking Pre-Market Approval of this indication.  We feel that if 
this study is successful, DBS will provide physicians with an additional 
treatment option.   
 
Study Success defined as: 
3.4 IPG Implantation 
 Achieving a statistically significant greater number 
of patients who meet the response criteria as compared to the control group 
at the 6 month endpoint.      
The ANS Libra Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System consists of an 
Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) designed to be connected to 4 or 8 
electrode leads and extensions and programmed by an external programmer. 
The DBS system for the purposes of this study is to be used for the treatment 
of severe major depressive disorder. The ANS pulse generator is implanted in 
a subcutaneous pocket, and receives radio frequency (RF) programming 
signals by means of the external programmer. The ANS IPG decodes the 
programmed information and delivers stimulation pulses to a selected 
combination of output electrodes, on the lead.  The Implantation Visit will be 
classified as “Week 0”. 
3.5 Patient Evaluation 
All patients will be evaluated 3 times, by at least 2 separate psychiatrists, 
prior to being considered for device implantation.  All patients will be assigned 
a case manager/counselor to follow the patient for the duration of the study.  
This case manager will be blinded to the study therapy for the duration of the 
study. 
 
After system implant (Week 0), the patient will return to clinic approximately 2 
weeks after surgery for evaluation and treatment randomization into either 
Group 1 or Group 2 (Group 1 = Active Treatment Group; Group 2 = Control 
Group).  Patient will then return to clinic for subsequent evaluations at 4 
weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 
months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, and 1 year post system 
implantation. 
 
At the end of the 6 month visit, all control group patients will have the option 
to receive active stimulation and will be followed on a monthly basis until the 
end of the 1 year study.

4.1 System Components 
The components of the DBS System to be used in this study include an 
Implantable Pulse Generator (ANS, Libra and LibraXP DBS IPG), leads 
(ANS, Libra DBS Lead Kits), extensions, the ANS MTS trial stimulator, the 
clinician programmer, the patient controller (ANS, QuikLink Controller).  The 
Libra system is comprised of implanted and non-implanted components that 
include: 
• Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) – generates low-current electrical 
pulses. 
• Lead - contains electrodes to deliver stimulation 
• Lead Extension – make the electrical connection between the lead 
and the generator 
• Trial Stimulator - for intraoperative and post operative testing 
• Clinician Programmer – for programming the generator 
• QuikLink Patient Controller  - controls off/on function and amplitude 
4.2 Regulatory Status 
The ANS Libra DBS system is predicated on the currently approved Genesis 
neuromodulation system (Approved in US under PMA P010032, Registered 
in Canada under License No. 67516, CE Marked in Europe and Registered in 
Australia, and meets ISO 13485), which is indicated for Spinal Cord 
Stimulation (SCS) and distributed around the world.  The ANS device to be 
used in this study is not currently approved for marketing and distribution in 
the United States for Deep Brain Stimulation for Major Depressive Disorder.  
However, the Libra DBS System has received Health Canada approval for 
investigational testing for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.  The 
ANS DBS system is categorized in the United States as a class III medical 
device and the purpose of this clinical trial is to provide safety and efficacy 
data to support the PMA submission for the ANS Deep Brain Stimulation 
System.

Subject Assignment to Treatment and Blinding 
Each patient who is willing to consider study participation and who provides 
informed consent will be evaluated with the inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
eligibility.  Each patient will be enrolled chronologically on a patient screening log 
and given a screening number until device implantation. The patient will be given 
a randomization number after device implantation has occurred and the patient 
has been shown to meet all inclusion criteria and not violate any exclusion 
criteria.  Patients will be block-randomized with a separate randomization number 
for each study site.  Patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment group in a 
2:1 ratio, to either: 
Group 1: DBS Active Treatment Group – Implanted with DBS system and 
activated for 6 months of DBS. 
Group 2
 
:  Control Group - Implanted with DBS system, device not activated for 
stimulation for the first 6 months of study. 
The patients will be blinded to the functioning of the DBS system.  The patient 
will not be able to tell if they have been randomized to active treatment or to the 
control group.   
 
The evaluating psychiatrist (Investigator) and/or qualified designee and the case 
manager will be blinded to the functioning of the DBS system in order to minimize 
bias.  The device will be programmed by one clinician and the information 
regarding the device will not be given to the evaluating psychiatrist or qualified 
designee.  All efforts will be made to ensure that the evaluating psychiatrist is the 
same throughout the patient study treatment and follow-up visits, in order to 
reduce variability in the evaluators scoring.  All evaluators will be trained prior to 
study initiation as well as re-trained on a scheduled basis throughout study 
duration.

7.2.2 Outcome measures 
 
The Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale is a 10 item 
severity scale constructed to be sensitive to change with treatment. It was 
designed to be sensitive for individual items and is therefore useful for 
measuring differential profiles of action. Ratings of patients on a 65 item 
comprehensive psychopathology scale were used to identify the 17 most 
commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness, and ratings 
on these 17 items for 64 patients participating in studies of four different 
antidepressant drugs were used to create a depression scale consisting of

the 10 items which showed the largest changes with treatment and the 
highest correlation to overall change. (Montgomery & Asberg 1979)  An 
interrater evaluation will also be performed on multiple study visits to 
increase consistency and reduce variability. 
 
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a 17-item scale that 
evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of 
depression, and comorbid anxiety symptoms. The HRSD-17 was one of 
the first rating scales developed to quantify the severity of depressive 
symptomatology. First introduced by Max Hamilton in 1960, it has since 
become the most widely used and accepted outcome measure for 
evaluating depression severity. It provides ratings on current DSM-IV 
symptoms of depression, with the exceptions of hypersomnia, increased 
appetite, and concentration/indecision. The HRSD-17 was designed to be 
administered by a trained clinician using a semi-structured clinical 
interview. The 17-items are rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3 point (0-
2) scale.   
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) 
 
The construction of the IDS-C30 was intended to remedy deficits in the 
Hamilton Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) and Montgomery and Asberg 
(MADRS) depression rating scales by, among others, including all nine 
symptom domains needed to diagnose a DSM-IV major depressive 
episode in order to assess symptom remission, improve ability to detect 
milder levels of symptoms than the HRSD-17, and provide unconfined and 
more equivalent weighting among items. There are two versions of the 
IDS with identical items: a clinician rating (IDS-C30) and a self-report 
(IDS-SR30). Items were selected to represent mood, cognitive, vegetative, 
anxious, and endogenous symptoms common in depression. Each of the 
30 items is rated from 0 to 3, with increasing severity represented by a 
higher rating. (Rush et al. 1996) 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30) 
 
The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report
 
 (QIDS-
SR) is a 16-question shortened self-test, derived from the 30-item IDS, 
which measures 9 different criterion domains of major depression.  Each 
of the 4 possible answers to each quiz is given an ascending numerical 
value from 0-3.  
The SAFTEE is a structural clinical interview developed by the National 
Institute of Mental Health which exams possible treatment-emergent side 
effects for clinical studies.  The SAFTEE-SI looks at specific adverse 
symptoms for a particular treatment.

The MINI is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by 
psychiatrists and clinicians in the United States and Europe, for DSM-IV 
and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders. With an administration time of 
approximately 15 minutes, it was designed to meet the need for a short 
but accurate structured psychiatric interview for multi-centered clinical 
trials and epidemiology studies and to be used as a first step in outcome 
tracking in non-research clinical settings.  The MINI Plus is a more 
detailed edition of the MINI.  
The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) Plus 
 
The mini-mental state examination (MMSE)
 
 or Folstein test is a brief 30-
point questionnaire test that is used to assess cognition. It is commonly 
used in medicine to screen for dementia.  In the time span of about 10 
minutes, it samples various functions, including arithmetic, memory and 
orientation.  It was introduced by Folstein et al in 1975 and is widely used 
with small modifications. 
 
The SCID-II is a semi-structured interview for making DSM-IV Axis II 
(Personality Disorder) diagnoses and is designed to be administered by a 
clinician or trained mental health professional. A SCID II takes 1/2 to 1 
hour to administer. There are 3 components to the SCID-II. The interview 
itself covers the 11 DSM-IV Personality Disorders. The SCID-II Personality 
Questionnaire is available as a screening tool to shorten the time it takes 
the clinician to administer the SCID-II. After the subject fills out the 
Personality Questionnaire (which usually takes 20 minutes), the clinician 
simply circles the numbers to the left of the SCID-II items that correspond 
to items answered "yes" on the questionnaire. When the SCID-II is 
administered, the clinician needs only to inquire about the items screened 
positive on the questionnaire. The assumption is that a subject who 
responds with a "no" on the questionnaire item would also have answered 
"no" to the same question had it been read aloud by the interviewer.  For 
this study, only the subsection for Cluster B will be administered. 
Structural Clinical Interview for Personality Disorders (SCID II) 
 
The YMRS is an 11-item instrument used to assess the severity of mania 
in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The 11 items are: Elevated 
Mood, Increased Motor Activity Energy, Sexual Interest, Sleep, Irritability, 
Speech (Rate and Amount), Language - Thought Disorder, Content, 
Disruptive - Aggressive Behavior, Appearance, and Insight. 
The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 
Ratings are based on patient self-reporting, combined with clinician 
observation (accorded greater score).  (Young 1978)

The short form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction 
Questionnaire is a self-report form composed of 16 items each rated on a 
5-point scale that indicates the degree of enjoyment or satisfaction 
experienced during the past week.  A total score of items 1 to 14 is 
computed and expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score 
of 70.  The 14 items evaluated each subjects’ satisfaction with his or her 
physical health, social relations, ability to function in daily life; ability to get 
around physically; mood; family relations; sexual drive and interest; ability 
to work on hobbies, work, leisure time activities; economic status; 
household activities; living/housing situation; and overall sense of well 
being.  (Rapaport et al. 2005) 
Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QOL) 
 
The WSAS-SR is used to measure functional impairment attributed to a 
identified problem (Mundt, 2002).  There are 5 questions that are 
associated with work, home, social leisure, private leisure and ability to 
form and maintain relationships.  
Work and Social Adjustment Scale Self Report (WSAS) 
 
The Global Assessment Scale is a hypothetical continuum of mental 
health illness that looks at psychological, social and occupational 
functioning. The GAF scale is divided into 10 ranges of functioning in 
which the clinician picks a single value that best reflects the individual’s 
overall level of functioning. The GAF does not include “impairment in 
functioning due to physical (or environmental) limitations.” (American 
Psychiatric Association – APA, 1994) 
Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) 
 
The CGI is used to measure the global impression of a treatment 
response in a psychiatric patient’s illness by a clinician (Guy 1976).  Two 
of three sub-scales are being used to measure severity of the illness and 
improvement of the illness. Items in the two-subscales being administered 
are rated on a seven-point scale ranging from “1=normal” to “7=extremely 
ill” for severity subscale and “1=very much improved” to “7=very much 
worse” for improvement sub-scale. 
Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Improvement (CGI) 
 
The PGI is used to measure the global impression of a treatment 
response in a psychiatric patient’s illness by the patient.  Two sub-scales 
are being used to measure severity of the illness and improvement of the 
illness. Items in the two-subscales being administered are rated on a 
seven-point scale ranging from “1=normal not ill at all” to “7=among the

“7=very much worse” for improvement sub-scale. 
 
 
Health and Labor Questionnaire (HLQ)
The HLQ is designed to collect quantitative data on the relation between 
illness and treatment and work performance. The HLQ data permits the 
estimation of production losses (costs) of paid and unpaid labor. It 
contains also an indicator for impediments for paid and unpaid labor, one 
of the indicators for quality of life. The HLQ is divided into 4 modules to 
collect data about absence from work, reduced productivity at paid work, 
unpaid labor production and impediments to paid and unpaid labor. The 
modular structure permits the omission of questions that are not 
applicable to the study population. The questionnaire is suitable for self-
assessment.  
  
 
A 14 item test designed to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms.  All 
questions are rated on a 5 point (0-4) scale, with 7 questions on psychic 
anxiety and 7 questions on somatic anxiety.  Total scores range from 0 to 
56.  Patients with anxiety and panic disorder tend to have a score greater 
than 20.    
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) 
 
The C-SSRS is a semi-structured clinical interview that utilizes a set of 
prompts and questions to help an interviewer get more complete 
information on events suggestive of suicidality.  This prospective tool aims 
to standardize terminology and articulate suicidality assessment in a 
straightforward manner.

Neuropsychological Battery 
 
Neuropsychological Examination: 
 
The following neuropsychological 
tests will be performed and evaluated at or after baseline #3, 6 
months, and 1 year visits during the study to assess the safety of 
Deep Brain Stimulation.  The following is a description of all the tests 
to be performed:   
 
Attention/Working Memory 
Wechsler Memory Scale –Working Memory Index Test (Wechsler, 
1997) 
 
Letter-Number Sequencing  
Examinees are presented with strings of alphanumeric sequences 
(e.g., 6-B-3-Z) of increasing length (2-8 letter-number pairs). The task

of the examinee is to repeat the letters and then the numbers in 
alphabetical and numerically ascending order. This test of working 
memory thus requires re-sequencing of information while holding in 
memory the original sequence. This task takes 3-5 minutes to 
complete. 
 
Stroop Color and Word Test (Golden, 1978) 
This version of the well-known Stroop test has 3 parts, each 
consisting of 1 page of 100 stimuli (arranged in 5 columns of 20 
items). The first sheet contains the words red, green, and blue, printed 
in black ink, in random order with the constraint that a word cannot be 
followed by the same word. The examinee is asked to read the words, 
and the variable of interest is how many items are completed correctly 
in 45 sec. On page 2 are 100 “XXXX” printed in either red, green or 
blue ink, with the constraint that a given item number could not 
correspond to the same color on the first page, and the same color 
cannot occur on consecutive items. The examinee is given 45 sec to 
name the color of the ink in which each stimulus is printed. On the 
final part, the page consists of the words red, green, and blue, and 
each word is printed in red, green, or blue ink, but in a manner that 
the word and color ink are always incongruent. The score is the 
number of items completed correctly in 45 sec. The whole test takes 
about 5 minutes. 
 
Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test (Ruff & Allen, 1996) 
This test of sustained and selective attention consists of 20 15-second 
trials during which patients cross out 2 target stimuli (the numbers 2 
and 7) among three rows of either numeric or alphabetic stimuli (each 
row contains 10 targets and 40 distracters in quasi-random order). 
The targets embedded among letters are considered “automatic” 
conditions (because the patient can identify targets simply by the 
category they belong to), whereas the tasks embedding the targets 
among numbers are considered “Controlled” conditions requiring 
effort and working memory since targets and distracters belong to the 
same stimulus category (numbers). The test evaluates both accuracy 
(considering errors of omission and commission) and speed.  
Normative data (based on 360 persons) are available for ages 16-70 
years, stratified by education. Test-retest reliability is estimated to be 
.89 for speed, and .59 to .69 for accuracy on automatic and controlled 
search tasks (with stability coefficients ranging from .76 to .93). The 
test is typically completed in 5 minutes.

Page 31 
The D-KEFS contains 3 verbal fluency tests assessing timed oral 
production of items from lexical and semantic categories. In the Letter 
fluency task the patient is asked to say as many words as possible 
(excluding proper names and numbers) beginning with a given letter 
of the alphabet. There are 3 trials, each using a different letter, of 60 
seconds each. In the Category Fluency task, the examinee is asked to 
say as many words as possible belonging to a category (such as 
animals) in 60 seconds.  There are 2 trials using different categories. 
On the final task (Category Switching), the patient is asked to orally 
generate consecutive words from 2 alternating categories for 60 
seconds.  The tasks can be completed in about 8-10 minutes. 
 
The tests are normed on over 2000 individuals, are standardized, are 
applicable to persons up to 89 years of age, and are co-normed with 
the WASI. This co-norming feature means that cognitive strengths 
and weaknesses can be ascertained with confidence given 
comparability of scores and normative data. Another strength of this 
instrument is the availability of alternate forms, thus minimizing 
practice effects (although not eliminating possible familiarity and 
carry-over effects). Test-retest data are available to facilitate 
interpretation of score changes over time. 
 
 
Memory 
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised (HVLT-R; Brandt & 
Benedict, 2001) 
This verbal learning test has six equivalent, alternate forms, making it 
ideal for repeat administration. It is normed on persons aged 16-92 
years and was designed to be tolerated by even significantly impaired 
individuals. The examinee is provided 3 learning trials to remember an 
orally presented 12-word list (four nouns from each of 3 semantic 
categories). Following a 20-25 minute interval, delayed recall and 
yes/no recognition are assessed. The test takes about 15 minutes 
excluding the delay interval which is preferably filled with intervening 
visuospatial tasks. Test-retest reliability is weaker for recognition and 
retention (.40 and .39; probably limited by skewed 
Score distributions), but adequate for recall (.66-.74). Test-retest 
gains, even when persons were tested as little as 2 weeks apart, were 
only about 0.5 standard deviations. 
 
Brief Visual Memory Test – Revised (BVMT-R; Benedict, 1997) 
Like any of its word list learning analogs (e.g., the HVLT-R), this test 
involves multiple trial learning followed by delayed recall and 
recognition trials. However, the stimuli are abstract line drawings 
rather than words. The patient is shown a set of 6 abstract line 
drawings (in a 2x3 array) for 10 seconds and is then asked to draw

Page 32 
them in their correct location. This procedure is repeated for a total of 
3 learning trials. After 25 minutes, delayed recall and recognition 
(identifying which 6 of 12 drawings were seen) trials are administered. 
The brevity of the task and the availability of 6 alternate forms make 
the test useful for repeated administrations. It is normed for persons 
aged 18-79 years. Reliability coefficients exceed .90, and test-retest 
reliability ranges from .60 to .84. Excluding the delay, which is filled 
with verbal tests, the BVMT-R can be completed in 15 minutes. 
 
 
Self and Informant Rating of Executive Functions 
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function – Adult Version 
(BRIEF-A; Roth et al. 2005) 
The self-and informant-report forms consist of 75 items asking the 
person to report the frequency (never, sometimes, or often) with which 
certain behaviors have occurred during the month prior to evaluation. 
The behaviors measured relate to a variety of executive functions 
(e.g., self-monitoring, emotional control, behavioral inhibition and 
shifting, planning and organization) and are expressed in 2 indices 
(Behavioral Regulation Index and Metacognition Index) and an overall 
summary score (Global Executive Composite). There are also 3 
response validity scales. Normative data are available for 1,050 
persons for self-report and 1,200 informant reports. The test can be 
used with adults aged 18-90 years. Test-retest reliability for self-report 
clinical scores ranged from .82 to .93 over an average re-test interval 
of about 4 weeks, while informant report test-retest reliability ranged 
from .91 to .94. Test-retest values were still higher for the summary 
indexes. Patients and informants usually complete these forms in 
about 15 minutes. 
 
 
Testing order: 
The above tests should be performed in the following order: 
 
1. HVLT-R immediate recall (3 trials); 
2. Ruff 2 & 7; 
3. Stroop; 
4. Fill rest of 20-25 minute delay with starting the BRIEF;

DBS System Implantation 
 
The DBS system implant visit should be performed no less than 2 weeks and 
no more than 1 month after the baseline #3 visit.  
 
Implantation of the DBS system will be performed according to standard 
surgical procedure for Brodmann Area 25WM (Cg25) DBS implantation. 
 
Pre-Operative Imaging:
 
 High resolution, 3D T1 weighted images will be 
obtained.  On or before the day of surgery patients will have a stereotactic 
frame or appropriate bone fiducials applied using local anesthesia.  Additional 
CT imaging for fusion is optional, as is the use of IV contrast.   
Pre-Operative Planning:
 
 Standard software (e.g. Framelink, Brainlab, or 
other) is used to reconstruct the images in axial, coronal, and sagittal views, 
relative to the AC-PC plane.    
The sagittal images will be used first.  Surgeon will select an image several 
millimeters (mm) off midline clearly showing the white and gray matter of the 
cingulate gyrus.  A tentative target point is selected at the center of the 
subgenual cingulate (Brodmann Area 25WM).  
 
Next, the surgeon will convert to the coronal images perpendicular to the AC-
PC plane.  The midpoint of the subgenual cingulate gyrus is typically found in 
the coronal image containing the anterior-most section of the caudate 
nucleus.  Thus the A-P position of the target can be confirmed by scanning a 
few images anterior and posterior to confirm proximity to this section.  
 
Precise targets can then be selected bilaterally in this same coronal section.  
A point is selected on each side at the border of the white and grey matter, 
midway between the superior and inferior banks of the cingulate gyrus. The 
intended site is approximately 5-7 mm from the midline and 10 mm below the 
corpus callosum. After targets have been selected, the appropriate frame 
coordinates can be calculated and used for the stereotactic procedure. 
 
Entry points can also be selected on the stereotactic planner if desired.  This 
practice is variable at different centers.  If entry planning is performed it is 
recommended that an entry site that is slightly anterior to the more typical 
burr hole used for STN-DBS. This is necessitated by the more anterior nature 
of this target.  Anterior entry (~2cm anterior to the coronal suture) will avoid a 
difficult approach angle.   
 
DBS Implantation: After sterile preparation of the operative field, burr holes 
are placed under local or general anesthesia.  Again the slightly more anterior 
entry is recommended. A lateral position of 2-3cm from midline is also 
recommended. Dura and pia are opened under direct visualization.  The

remainder of the operation is performed using an appropriate stereotactic 
frame or frameless guidance system. 
  
One or more cannulas are inserted to the target coordinate. Microelectrode 
recording may be performed, at this point, to confirm the location of the grey-
white junction within the target area.  This procedure is optional.  
 
A DBS electrode will be inserted into the target under fluoroscopic 
visualization.  Once the electrode has been placed in the calculated target 
intra-operative diagnostic testing will be performed; however, no active deep 
brain stimulation will be delivered to the patient in order to protect the study 
blinding process.  After confirmation of position the end of the lead is 
protected and excess lead is coiled in a sterile subgaleal pocket made by 
blunt dissection. The procedure is then repeated for the contralateral side.  
 
Intraoperative Device Diagnostic Testing:
 
 The implanted leads will be tested 
for proper connectivity as well as impedance; however, no active stimulation 
will be delivered, so as to not break the blinding of the study.   
IPG Implantation:
 
 The second stage of the operative procedure involves the 
implantation of lead extensions and the IPG. This will be performed 
immediately following the above procedure. The patient is given a general 
anesthetic and a sterile preparation is performed. The lead ends are 
accessed either by reopening the scalp incision or by making a smaller 
incision over the subgaleal pocket.  The lead extension is then tunneled 
subcutaneously to a second incision just below the clavicle (can be left or 
right depending on patient preference). The extension wire is attached to the 
DBS leads proximally and to the battery distally.  The implantable pulse 
generator is placed in a subcutaneous pocket that is made below the clavicle.  
Excess wire is coiled behind the IPG.  Once again, a device diagnostic test 
will occur but no active stimulation will be delivered to the patient at this time. 
Lead Localization
7.4 Concomitant Treatments 
:  The lead will be imaged post-implantation to confirm lead 
location according to current neurosurgical procedures and/or CT scans.  
These images must be given to the Sponsor for future analysis. 
 
All patients will have the ability to maintain their depression medication 
regimen as well as regularly scheduled psychotherapy to ensure study and 
therapy controls are maintained.  For the 1-year study, all psychiatric 
care/decisions must be transferred to the study psychiatrist.  For the first 6 
months of the study, patients will not be able to add new medications 
(excluding sleep aids and other meds to manage non-depression related 
conditions) nor increase current antidepressant medication doses.

Medication additions: 
For temporary insomnia, zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone, or chloral hydrate (a 
single dose nightly) or trazodone (< 100 mg) may be used, for a maximum of 
14 nights during the study. Lorazepam (< 2 mg/d) may also be administered 
for treatment emergent anxiety for up to 14 days. 
 
Rescue medications: 
The study psychiatrist should first identify a need for a rescue based on 
his/her clinical judgment of worsening depression.  In the event that a patient 
needs to be “rescued” due to a severe worsening of their depression (defined 
as patients who score 25% worse than their baseline average on the MADRS 
or worsening of suicidal ideation), prior to the completion of 6 months in the 
study, appropriate intervention may be initiated at the principal investigator’s 
discretion considering the protocol-specified guidance.  The following 
guidance should be adhered to when the rescue protocol is initiated: 
 
 
 
If a patient is rescued based on a 25% worsening of their MADRS score 
compared to the average MADRS Scores: 
• The patient will be considered a treatment failure. 
• The visit will serve as the patient’s endpoint data and the patient will be 
exited from the study.  All end-of-study procedures should be 
performed. 
• At the principal investigator discretion, medications may be added or 
changed as deemed in the best medical interest of the patient. 
• Patients who were in either the control group or received active 
stimulation should enter a separate open-label protocol for long-term 
follow-up. 
 
 
If a patient is rescued based on a worsening of suicidal ideation 
• A patient who shows imminent suicidal intent but does not attempt 
suicide will be treated for the acute exacerbation of their symptoms.  If 
the event can be treated with an acute intervention (less than 7 days) 
then the patient should resume participation in the trial and not be 
unblinded as to treatment. 
• After the acute intervention, the patient must have a MADRS item 10 
score of less than 5 to resume participation in the trial. 
• After the acute intervention, the patient must resume their previous 
medication regimen if medications were changed. 
• Patient’s medications must be stable for a minimum of 7 days prior to 
an effectiveness visit 
• If the patient attempts suicide, or requires a long-term medication 
change he/she will be considered and followed as a treatment failure.

Patients who were in either the control group or received active 
stimulation should enter a separate open-label protocol for long-term 
follow-up. 
 
At any time during the study the patient feels suicidal or in any danger from 
worsening depressive symptoms, they, or their caretaker should call their 
study psychiatrist immediately.    
7.5 Postoperative Visits  
All patients should be called in advanced to remind them of all study visits 
and to complete the necessary paperwork if applicable.  Patients will be 
assigned a case manager to follow their care for the duration of the study.  
The patient may schedule visits with the case manager a minimum of every 2 
weeks and a maximum of weekly for the study duration.  Patients should call 
the study physician and/or study staff if they are having any complications 
related to surgery, programming, or related study activities.  
 
 
Post surgery visit  
Patient will return to Neurosurgeon for a postoperative visit approximately 2 
weeks post implantation for normal follow up patient care including suture 
removal and wound evaluation. 
 
7.5.1  Study Visits: 
Patients will visit the clinic to have their device tested or programmed 
and activated (active group) within approximately 2 weeks, after 
surgery. Patients randomized to the control group will only have device 
diagnostics performed at this visit.  All patients may be seen at any 
time during the study for device device diagnostics.  
Two weeks after system implant – system diagnostics or 
programming and activation: 
 
For the treatment group, parameters of stimulation will be reassessed 
with minor adjustments in amplitude made to optimize clinical effects 
(as measured by the MADRS). Criteria for adjustment will include 
changes in amplitude if there is either an absence or a loss of 
improvement since the last adjustment.  If a patient is stable or shows 
evidence of clinical improvement according to the MADRS the settings 
will be unchanged. If a patient deteriorates following an increase in 
amplitude or after the introduction of stimulation, the settings will be 
changed according to the programming plan below.  Changes in the 
specific contact will only be done if there are no behavioral effects at 
the target contact following adjustments of amplitude.

Group:  
 
 
Initial Device Settings: 4.0mA, 130Hz, 91uSec 
Relative Change in MADRS from previous rating will dictate changes 
as follows. 
 
If the MADRS value is better 2 weeks after the initial programming 
session, (better defined as a decrease in MADRS score by ≥ 10% from 
previous evaluation) do not change electrode settings, frequency, or 
pulse width).   
 
If the MADRS value has decreased by less than 10% 2 weeks after the 
initial programming session, Amplitude can be increased by 2.0mA.  
If after 4 weeks at this new amplitude setting, the MADRS value has 
not changed or has not started to decrease, amplitude may be 
increased by 2mA again.   
 
In the event that the MADRS value has increased by >10% (worsened 
state), the amplitude should be decreased by 2.0mA.  If after 2 weeks, 
the MADRS is still unchanged or continues to deteriorate (increased 
MADRS score); a new contact should be selected.   
 
Contact pairs (matched right and left) will be tested consecutively.   A 
change in contacts or addition of contacts will be made if there is either 
no response or worsening using either higher (8.0mA) or lower 
(2.0mA) current as described above.  If a patient experiences clinical 
worsening in the context of no history of response to any setting, a 
careful safety evaluation will occur every 2 weeks. Stimulation will 
continue at the previous best contacts only if the patient and the 
investigator conclude that it is safe for the patient to continue in the 
open stimulation phase of the study.

7.5.2  Control Group (Non-Active Stimulation): 
 
 
At the end of the 6 month visit, patients will be given the option to have 
 
device programmed and activated for DBS.  Patient will then be 
 
followed monthly, until the end of the 52 week study.  
7.6 Long-Term Follow-Up 
All patients will be encouraged to enroll in a long-term follow-up study under a 
separate protocol sponsored by ANS to monitor the continued efficacy and 
safety of this system. Efficacy assessments and device related adverse 
events will be collected on all willing participants at specific intervals after they 
exit the currently proposed study.  A separate study protocol and patient 
informed consent will be signed for this long term follow up study. 
 
All study patients may have access to the device at no cost for battery 
replacement and or revision(s) until the device is commercially available in the 
United States.  The patients/physicians must make a request to the study 
sponsor to have the device shipped to the appropriate location.

Adverse Events (AEs)  
8.1  AE Definitions 
 
An ADVERSE EVENT is “Any change, undesired, noxious or pathological in a 
patient or subject illustrated by signs, symptoms and /or laboratory changes 
that occur during a clinical trial, whether or not considered drug/treatment 
related.” 
 
A SERIOUS/SEVERE AE is where the event is/causes: 
Life threatening or fatal 
Requires or prolongs hospitalization 
The patient to be disabled 
 
A DEVICE RELATED AE is an anticipated (those events listed in section 8.4) 
or unanticipated (those events that occur that are not listed in section 8.4) 
event that occurs that is considered device related.  A device-related event is 
one that the Investigator feels that the device (i.e. IPG, extension or lead) 
contributed in any way to the adverse event occurring.  A stimulation-related 
event is one that resolves when stimulation is turned off or turned down. 
 
A NON SERIOUS AE is an event other than one described above. 
8.2 AE Recording 
All Adverse Events volunteered by the Subjects/Patients or elicited 
by 
the 
Investigator must be recorded on the AE forms provided.  All serious/severe 
AEs must be recorded whether or not considered device/treatment related.  
All device related complications that occur during the study duration and/or 
malfunctions of study device should be recorded on the AE forms provided.  
Device complications are defined as those complications relating directly to 
the functioning of the stimulation system (i.e. IPG, extension or lead). 
8.3 Reporting AEs 
Throughout the course of the proposed study, all serious/severe adverse 
events and device related adverse events would be recorded and monitored 
by the Sponsor and the Investigator. Every effort will be made to remain alert 
to possible adverse experiences and unexpected findings. If adverse 
experiences occur, the first concern will be the safety of the subject. 
Appropriate medical intervention will be made.  All completed suicides and 
suicide attempts (defined by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(CSSRS) > 3) must be reported to the Sponsor immediately (less than 10 
days) upon discovery.  Once the Sponsor is notified of these events, the 
Sponsor will report these events to the FDA within 10 days.

Page 43 
Individual reports of device related complications will be documented and 
reported appropriately.  The investigator must report all serious AEs to the 
Sponsor immediately upon discovery by telephone and forward the completed 
AE form as soon as it is available. The Investigator must also promptly report 
the resolution to all reported serious or device related AEs. 
8.4  Anticipated Adverse Events and Complications 
Implantation of a deep brain stimulation lead is a surgical procedure that may 
expose the patient to the risks of post-operative pain, stress, or discomfort, 
intracranial hemorrhage, subcutaneous hemorrhage, intracranial infarctions, 
venous air embolism (air entering the veins), venous infarctions, symptomatic 
neumocephalus (intracranial air causing confusion requiring an extra day stay 
in the hospital), seizure or convulsions, seroma, infection, aphasia, paralysis, 
stroke, death, cerebrospinal fluid leakage or abnormality.  An additional 
neurosurgical procedure may be necessary to manage one of the above 
complications or to replace a fractured lead or to replace the pulse generator 
 
The anticipated adverse events associated with the use of this device may 
include the following: 
  
• Neuropathy;

Data Analysis and Statistical Plan 
9.1  Statistical Plan 
The study design for this investigation is a prospective, double-blind, 
randomized, and controlled study.  The primary objective is to demonstrate 
the safety and efficacy of using subgenual white matter (Brodmann Area 
25WM) deep brain stimulation as an adjunctive treatment for Major 
Depressive Disorder, single or recurrent episode. 
 
9.2 Sample Size 
Data in an uncontrolled pilot study of Deep Brain Stimulation showed that 
greater than 40% of the patients improved with a minimum of a 40% reduction 
in MADRS score following 6 months of deep brain stimulation.  For this study, 
the population response rate among patients treated with deep brain 
stimulation is assumed to be 40%.  If the population response rate in the 
placebo group is assumed to be 18.5% then 159 patients randomized 2:1 
(106 in the deep brain stimulation group and 53 in the placebo group) will 
provide 80% power to reject the primary effectiveness null hypothesis.  
Sample size calculations were performed using the inequality of proportions 
option in PASS 2005 and the Z test pooled.   To allow for a dropout rate as 
high as 20%, the sample size will be increased to 201 patients (134 in the 
deep brain stimulation group and 67 in the placebo group). 
 
9.3 Datasets 
The primary analysis of effectiveness will be intent to treat and will include all 
randomized patients.  Analyses of safety will include all patients who are 
implanted. 
9.4 Primary Effectiveness Analysis 
The primary effectiveness variable is change from baseline (mean of 
Baselines 1, 2, and 3) to the mean of Months 4, 5 and 6 in the MADRS.  
Patients who are missing one or two of the assessments at Months 4, 5 or 6 
will have the available visits used.  The primary endpoint is a clinical response 
defined as a 40% or greater reduction from baseline in the MADRS plus no 
worsening in Global Assessment of Functioning.  Patients missing the 
MADRS for Months 4, 5 and 6 will be considered as non-responders.  The 
primary hypothesis is as follows: 
 
HO: ПDBS = П
vs. 
control 
HA: ПDBS ≠ Пcontrol
 
, 
where ПDBS and Пcontrol are the population response rates in the Deep Brain 
Stimulation and control groups, respectively.  This hypothesis will be tested

by a logistic regression that includes the effects of treatment group, study 
site, level of treatment resistance as a continuous variable (as defined by 
ATHF criteria), and baseline MADRS, and will be tested as a two-sided test 
at the 5% level of significance.  Study sites with fewer than three patients in 
either treatment group will be pooled.  
 
A number of exploratory analyses are planned for the primary endpoint and 
are described in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan. 
9.5 Secondary Effectiveness Analyses 
The following secondary endpoints will be compared between the treatment 
and control groups, in the order that they will be tested : 
 
1. Change from baseline to Month 6 in GAF  
2. Change from baseline to Month 6 in Patient and Clinician Global 
Impression of Severity  
3. Change from baseline to Month 6 in Patient and Clinician Global 
Impression of Improvement  
4. A comparison of the  active and control groups at month 6 on the Short 
form Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QOL) 
5. Change from baseline to Month 6 in the Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology (IDS-C30) 
6. Change from baseline to Month 6 in the Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) 
7. Change from baseline to Months 6 in the Work and Social Adjustment 
Scale (WSAS) 
8. Change from baseline to Month 6 in the Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression - 17 item (HRSD-17) 
9. A 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the MADRS plus no 
worsening in Global Assessment of Functioning and no attempted suicide 
at 6 months 
10.The proportion of subjects in the active as compared to the control group 
at the end of month 6 who had a 50% or greater reduction in MADRS 
score from baseline 
11.A 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the HRSD-17 at 6 months 
12.A 40% or greater reduction from baseline in the MADRS at 6 months 
13.A remitter analysis will be performed with remitter defined as HAM-D 
score < 
14.The proportion of subjects in the active as compared to the control group 
at the end of month 6 who are remitters defined as MADRS score <10 
7 at 6 months 
 
 
The first eight secondary endpoints are continuous variables based on 
quantitative scales.  Each of these variables will be analyzed based on the 
multiple imputation procedure and pooling of study sites described under the 
secondary analyses of the primary variable.  An analysis of covariance that

Final 
 
 
Confidential 
Page 47 
includes the effects of treatment group, study site, and the corresponding 
baseline measure will be used to analyze each variable.   
 
The last six secondary endpoints will be analyzed first in the same manner 
as described for the primary endpoint and then after the multiple imputation 
procedure described for the primary endpoint.  
 
The secondary endpoints will be tested in the order they are presented 
above using a step down procedure to maintain an overall error of 5%.  This 
step down procedure will only be performed if the primary endpoint is 
statistically significant and only descriptive information will be provided if the 
primary endpoint is not statistically significant.  If the primary endpoint is 
statistically significant (p<0.05) then the first secondary endpoint will be 
tested at a significance level of 5%.  If that is significant, the second 
secondary endpoint will be tested at a significance level of 5%.  This 
procedure will continue until an endpoint is found to be nonsignificant 
(p>0.05), or all 14 secondary endpoints are found to be significant.   
 
The above imputation procedure described for the primary endpoint will be 
used for all secondary endpoints to create a complete dataset of values over 
the entire course of the study.  A mixed effects repeated measures analysis 
will then be used to estimate the time course of mean changes from 
baseline.  This will be used as supportive information only.. 
9.6  Other Analyses 
The ability of patients to correctly guess their assigned treatment will be 
done by comparing the patients’ perceived treatment with the actual 
treatment and estimating kappa statistics.  An estimated kappa statistic 
>0.60 will be deemed substantial strength of agreement35
 
.  In addition, to 
assess whether the patients’ perceived treatment is related to disease 
improvement, rather than stimulation effects, patients’ perceived treatment 
will be compared with whether or not they reached the primary endpoint and 
kappa statistics will also be estimated.  Other analyses will be performed 
according to the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
9.7  Safety Analyses 
9.7.1  Primary Safety Analysis 
The primary safety analysis will include a descriptive analysis of all adverse 
events during the controlled phase, comparing active stimulation with the 
placebo group.  Adverse events with sufficient incidence will be compared 
between treatment groups by a two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test at the 5% level 
of significance.  In addition, all adverse events among patients treated with 
active stimulation during either the controlled phase or the open label phase 
will be summarized along with their exact two-sided 95% confidence interval.

 C-07-01 Libra® IPG DBS

Page 48 
 
A total of 134 patients receiving active stimulation during the controlled 
phase will provide a 74% chance of observing at least one patient with an 
adverse event rate of 1%.  Moreover, a total of 201 patients exposed to 
active stimulation during either the controlled phase or the open label phase 
will provide an 87% chance of observing at least one patient with an adverse 
event rate of 1%.   
 
9.7.2  Other Analyses of Safety  
An additional safety evaluation will be performed on the Neuropsychological 
battery.  The Neuropsychological battery will be completed at baseline, 
Month 6 and Month 12.  Changes from baseline at Month 6 will be compared 
between treatment groups by an analysis of covariance that includes the 
effects of treatment group, study center, and corresponding baseline value.  
P-values will be reported only as summary statistics and no inference of 
statistical significance will be made from these data.  Changes from baseline 
to Month 12 will be presented as summary statistics for all patients from both 
original treatment groups combined.  Only available data will be used in 
these analyses with no imputation of missing data. 
 
The numbers of patients with Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-
SSRS) scores >3 will be tabulated by treatment group for each study visit 
throughout the blind and open label phases, and for both treatment groups 
combined in the open label phase.  
 
9.8 
Stopping Rule for Futility 
The futility analysis will be done when 75 to 100 patients have achieved the 
primary endpoint by either completing their Month-6 visit or have terminated 
from the trial prior to their Month 4 visit.  No more than 125 patients will be 
enrolled into the trial until the results of the futility analysis have been 
completed and reviewed by FDA. 
 
The futility analysis will be performed using the average of the revised 
alternative hypothesis (HA) and the observed interim results.  With the 
current sample size of 201 patients, the alternative hypothesis becomes a 
40% response rate for patients on stimulation and a 20.7% response rate 
among patients in the control group because these population proportions 
provide 80% power to reject the primary hypothesis.  The futility analysis will 
be performed under the assumption that the remaining patients will be drawn 
from populations with response rates that are the average of HA and the 
interim results.  Based on these revised population proportions, 5000 sets of 
simulation results among the remaining approximately 84 stimulation 
patients and 42 control group patients will be run.  Each set of simulated 
results will be added to the observed results and a two- sided Fisher’ Exact

p-value will be calculated.  The probability of a successful outcome of the 
study is then the proportion of these p-values that are <0.05.  If the 
probability of a successful study outcome is <10% the study will be stopped 
for futility.   
 
10 
Withdrawal of Subjects from Study 
Subjects may be discontinued from the study for non treatment-related reasons 
only when no other option is possible. Reasons for discontinuation include, but are 
not necessarily limited to: 
• Voluntary withdrawal from the study by the subject; 
• Subject has moved from the area and is determined to be lost-to-follow-up; 
• Investigator may discontinue the Subject’s participation in the study for reasons 
including, but not limited to: subject noncompliance, unwillingness or inability to 
cooperate with study requirements (therapy regimen, follow-up visits, study 
determination, etc...). 
 
The reason for discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate case report 
form.  
Prior to discontinuing a subject, every effort should be made to contact the subject 
in an effort either to get the subject back into compliance with the protocol, or to 
obtain as much follow-up data as possible.  If a subject decides to discontinue from 
the study, the subject shall have the option of having the system surgically 
removed followed by normal psychiatric care.  Once the patient exits the study, the 
device will be turned off (no matter what the randomized treatment was assigned).  
The device can only be reactivated by the study psychiatrist after the patient enters 
a separate open-label protocol for long-term follow-up.  The patient must sign a 
separate informed consent and must satisfy the inclusion criteria of the long-term 
follow up study prior to being enrolled.  The study psychiatrist must also deem the 
subject fit to begin or continue with stimulation.  
11 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed to review all SAE data 
and ensure the appropriate follow up actions necessary.  Keeping in mind the 
safety of patients the status of the study will be evaluated based on a risk to benefit 
ratio.  The Board will create a guidance document prior to the first patient being 
implanted.  This guidance document will indicate the frequency of DSMB meeting, 
stopping rules and other pertinent information to guide study review.

Modification of Protocol 
Any amendments to this protocol must be prepared by the study monitor and 
approved by ANS, the Investigator and the local authority (FDA/IRB/IEC) before 
implementation. 
13 
Discontinuation of Study 
ANS reserves the right to discontinue any study for administrative reasons at any 
time, such as but not limited to, a decision to discontinue further clinical 
investigations with the test article, improper conduct of the study by the 
Investigator, inability to obtain the number of patients required by the protocol, etc.  
Reimbursements for reasonable expenses will be made if such action is 
necessary. 
This study may be terminated by the DSMB if an unacceptable number of 
intracranial hemorrhages or an unacceptable number of completed suicides or 
suicide attempts is reached without an appropriate explanation.  Guidance 
regarding event evaluation is provided in the DSMB Plan 
 
Study enrollment will be suspended if the following criterion is met until the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board and FDA can review the safety and effectiveness data to 
determine whether the study should be halted, modified, or continued. 
 
• If the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (based on the normal 
approximation) for the rate of completed suicides in the combined patient 
population exceeds 2% at any point during the study. 
 
This study may be terminated if the number of the following events is reached 
without an appropriate explanation by the 6 month primary endpoint: 
 
• If greater than 24 patients experience an intracranial hemorrhage. This would 
assume that during the study at the specified interval the rate of intracranial 
hemorrhage would exceed 12% then the study would be terminated. 
 
 
14 
Administrative Requirements and Quality Assurance 
 
14.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
 
Before the study can begin the Investigator must provide the Sponsor with a

14.2 Clinical Supplies 
 
The Investigator agrees to keep all test articles in a secure location with 
restricted access.  The Investigator will maintain an inventory of test article 
receipt and distribution.  The Sponsor will provide an itemized inventory of all 
supplies dispatched.  The Investigator or appropriate designee will provide 
written confirmation of receipt.  Investigational devices and device 
accessories required for maintenance of the implanted devices will be made 
available to all patients enrolled in this study, at the request of the study 
Investigator, during the period the patient has completed study participation 
and prior to PMA approval.   
 
14.3 Reporting and Recording of Data 
 
All study data will be recorded on electronic Case Record Forms (eCRF).  
Electronic data capture (EDC) will also be utilized to monitor, correct, and 
store the collected data. 
 
14.4 Monitoring 
 
The Investigator will permit the Study Monitor to visit the Investigational Site 
at regular intervals to review all the CRFs, study related adjunctive data, and 
study management.  These reviews are for the purpose of verifying the 
adherence to the protocol and the completeness and exactness of the data 
being entered as required by Federal Regulations.  The Study Monitor must 
be kept informed of all issues pertinent to the study.  The Study Monitor will 
be available to discuss by telephone questions regarding adverse events, 
removal of patients/subjects from the study, conduct of the study or any other 
questions that should arise.  At the final monitoring visit the Study Monitor 
must resolve any outstanding data deficiencies and retrieve all used and 
unused test articles. 
 
14.5 On-site Audits 
 
The various National Regulatory Authorities (including the United States Food 
and Drug Administration) in the person of a scientifically trained and properly 
authorized employee of the department, may request access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection and copying.  Similar 
auditing procedures may also be conducted by a representative of the 
Sponsor.

14.6 Record Storage and Retention 
 
Federal law and GCP requires that a copy of all study records (e.g., Informed 
Consent documents, source documents, study records, etc.) which support 
CRFs of this study, must be retained in the files of the responsible 
Investigator for a minimum of two years following notification by ANS that all 
Investigations (not merely the Investigators portion) are completed, 
terminated, or discontinued, or that the Food and Drug Administration has 
approved the submission.   
If the Principal Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws 
from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be 
transferred to a person who will accept responsibility.  ANS must be notified in 
writing of the name and address of the new custodian.

Libra DBS System Clinician’s Manual
ABOUT THIS MANUAL
This manual provides information about the Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Inc.™ (ANS™) Libra™ Clinician 
Programmer (model 6850), and Libra (model 6608) and LibraXPTM (model 6644) implantable pulse generators. For 
information about other components of the Libra Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System, see the manuals packaged 
with those products.
BRIEF  
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The ANS Libra DBS System consists of an implantable 8-channel Libra or dual  
4-channel LibraXP 
neurostimulator, known as an implantable pulse generator (IPG). The IPG is used in conjunction with leads and 
extensions of various lengths and is programmed by an external programmer. This system is designed to deliver 
electrical stimulation, in various combinations of amplitude, pulse width, and frequency, to specific targets in the 
brain. The IPG, lead, and extension comprise the implantable components of the Libra DBS System. The Libra 
Clinician Programmer and QuikLink™ Controller support the operation of 
the IPG.
INVESTIGATIONAL INDICATIONS
The ANS Libra DBS system is intended for clinical investigation purposes only. The system is being investigated 
for the management of patients with Major Depressive Disorder, single or recurrent episode, with deep brain 
stimulation.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Implantation of an ANS Libra DBS System is contraindicated for use by patients who are unable to operate the 
system. It is also contraindicated for use with
● 
Pacemakers—Patients with demand-type cardiac pacemakers should not be implanted with a DBS system.
● 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)—Do not use a full body radio-frequency (RF) coil or other extremity 
coils on patients implanted with a deep brain stimulation system. Because energy from MRI can be transferred 
through the implanted system, the potential for heat generation at the location of the electrodes exists. This 
isolated temperature rise may cause tissue damage at the location of the implanted electrodes, possibly 
resulting in severe injury or death. Injury can occur during MRI treatment whether the deep brain stimulation 
system is turned on or off. All patients are advised to inform their health care professional that they should not 
be exposed to MRI. In the instance that MRI must be performed, precisely follow the guidelines provided in 
Appendix E.

� WARNINGS
Other System Components—Refer to the individual system component manuals for additional warnings and 
precautions related to those devices.
Diathermy—Do not use short-wave diathermy, microwave diathermy, or therapeutic ultrasound diathermy (all 
now referred to as diathermy) on patients implanted with a deep brain stimulation system. Energy from diathermy 
can be transferred through the implanted system and can cause tissue damage at the location of the implanted 
electrodes, resulting in severe injury or death. Diathermy is further prohibited because it may also damage the deep 
brain stimulation system components. This damage could result in loss of therapy, requiring additional surgery for 
system replacement. Injury or damage can occur during diathermy treatment whether the deep brain stimulation 
system is turned on or off.  
Poor Surgical Risks—Deep brain stimulation systems should not be implanted in patients who are poor surgical 
risks or patients with multiple illnesses or active general infections.
Implanted Defibrillators—Deep brain stimulation systems may adversely affect the programming and operation 
of implanted cardioverter defibrillators.
Explosive or Flammable Gases—Do not use programming devices in an environment where explosive or 
flammable gas vapors are present. The operation of programming devices could cause these vapors to ignite, 
resulting in severe burns, injury, or death.
Theft Detectors and Metal Screening Devices—Certain types of antitheft devices, such as those used at entrances 
and exits of department stores, libraries, and other public establishments, and/or airport security screening devices 
may affect stimulation. It is recommended that patients use caution when approaching such a device and request 
assistance to bypass the device. If they must proceed through the device, patients should move through the device 
quickly and check the stimulator after passing through to verify if it is turned on or off.
Operation of Machinery and Equipment—Patients should not operate potentially dangerous machinery, power 
tools, or vehicles or engage in any activity that would be potentially unsafe if their symptoms were to return 
unexpectedly. 
Device Components—The use of non-ANS components with this system may result in damage to the system and 
increased risk to the patient.
Case Damage—If the IPG case is pierced or ruptured, severe burns could result from exposure to the battery 
chemicals.
Anticoagulants—Physicians should use extreme care with lead implantation in patients with a heightened risk of 
intracranial hemorrhage. Physicians should also consider underlying factors, such as previous neurological injury 
or prescribed medications (anticoagulants), that may predispose a patient to the risk of bleeding.
High Charge Density—A potential risk of tissue damage exists with stimulation parameter settings of high 
amplitudes and wide pulse widths. Higher amplitude and pulse width settings required to achieve therapy may 
indicate a system problem or less than optimal lead placement.
If the stimulation parameters exceed the charge density limit of 30 µC/cm2, a warning will appear on the 
Clinician’s Programmer. Parameter values exceeding the charge density limit should only be programmed with 
due consideration of the warnings concerning charge densities. Charge density can be reduced by lowering the 
stimulation amplitude or pulse width.

PRECAUTIONS
GENERAL PRECAUTIONS
Surgeon Training—Implanting physicians should be experienced in stereotactic and functional neurosurgery. 
Physician Training—Clinicians should undergo device programming training and be experienced in the diagnosis 
and treatment of  the indication for which the DBS components are being used.
Patient Selection—It is extremely important to select patients appropriately for deep brain stimulation. 
Infection—It is important to follow proper infection control procedures. Infections related to system implantation 
might require that the device be explanted.
Implantation of Two IPGs—If two IPGs are implanted, ensure that at least 8 inches (20 cm) separates the 
implanted IPGs to minimize the possibility of interference during programming. Verify programmed parameters in 
both devices at the end of each programming session.
High Stimulation Outputs—Stimulation at high outputs may cause unpleasant sensations or motor disturbances or 
may render the patient incapable of controlling the stimulator. If unpleasant sensations occur, the device should be 
turned off immediately.
HANDLING, IMPLANTATION, STERILIZATION, STORAGE, AND EXPLANTATION
Single-Use Device—The implanted components of the Libra DBS System are intended for a single use only. Do 
not resterilize or reimplant an explanted component for any reason.
Expiration Date—Do not implant a system component if the use-before date has expired.
Care and Handling of Components—Use extreme care when handling system components prior to implantation. 
Excessive heat, excessive traction, excessive bending, excessive twisting, or the use of sharp instruments may 
damage and cause failure of the components.
Package and Component Damage—Do not implant a device if the sterile package or its components shows signs 
of damage, if the sterile seal is ruptured, or if contamination is suspected for any reason. Return the components to 
ANS for evaluation.
Exposure to Body Fluids or Saline—If the metal contacts on the proximal end of the lead or extension are 
exposed to body fluids or saline prior to connection, corrosion can occur. If exposure occurs, clean the metal 
contacts with sterile deionized water or sterile water (not saline) and dry completely prior to lead connection and 
implantation.
System Testing—The system should always be tested after implantation and before the patient leaves the surgery 
suite to ensure correct operation.
Component Disposal—Return all explanted components to ANS for safe disposal.

HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL ENVIRONMENTS
High Output Ultrasonics and Lithotripsy—The use of high output ultrasonic devices, such as an electrohydraulic 
lithotriptor, may cause damage to the electronic circuitry of an IPG. If lithotripsy must be used, do not focus the 
energy near the IPG.
Ultrasonic Scanning Equipment—The use of ultrasonic scanning equipment may cause mechanical damage to an 
implanted deep brain stimulation system if used directly over the implanted device.
External Defibrillators—The safety of discharging an external defibrillator on patients with implanted deep brain 
stimulation system components has not been established.
Therapeutic Radiation—Therapeutic radiation may damage the electronic circuitry of an implanted deep brain 
stimulation system, although no testing has been done and no definite information on radiation effects is available. 
Sources of therapeutic radiation include therapeutic x-rays, cobalt machines, and linear accelerators. If radiation 
therapy is required, the area over the IPG should be shielded with lead.
Electrosurgery Devices—Electrosurgery devices should not be used in close proximity to an implanted deep brain 
stimulation system. Contact between an active electrode and an IPG, lead, or extension can cause direct stimulation 
of the tissue at the electrode site and cause severe injury to the patient. If the use of electrocautery is necessary, 
turn the IPG off.
Psychotherapeutic Procedures—The safety of electromagnetic psychotherapeutic procedures (such as 
electroshock therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation) in patients implanted with DBS system components has 
not been established.
HOME AND OCCUPATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)—Certain commercial electrical equipment (e.g., arc welders, induction 
furnaces, and resistance welders), communication equipment (e.g., microwave transmitters, linear power amplifiers, 
 
and high power amateur transmitters), and high voltage power lines may generate sufficient EMI to interfere with 
the deep brain stimulation system operation if approached too closely.
Household Appliances—Household appliances that contain magnets (e.g., refrigerators, freezers, stereo speakers, 
mobile telephones, cordless telephones, standard wired telephones, AM/FM radios, and some power tools) may 
unintentionally cause the deep brain stimulation system to turn on or turn off.
Patient Activities/Environmental Precautions—Patients should take reasonable care to avoid devices that 
generate strong electromagnetic interference (EMI), which may cause the deep brain stimulation system to 
unintentionally turn on or off. Patients should also avoid any activities that would be potentially unsafe if their 
symptoms were to return unexpectedly.
Therapeutic Magnets—Patients should be advised to not use therapeutic magnets. Therapeutic magnets (e.g., 
magnets used in pillows, mattress pads, back belts, knee braces, wrist bands, and insoles) may unintentionally cause 
the deep brain stimulation system to turn on or off.
Mobile Phones—The effect of mobile phones on DBS systems is unknown; patients should avoid placing cellular 
phones directly over the device.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
A Libra DBS System consists of four primary components: IPG (neurostimulator), lead(s), extension(s), and 
programmer.
IPG
The Libra IPG is designed to be connected to one DBS extension. The LibraXP IPG is designed to be connected 
to two DBS extensions. The IPGs are powered by a hermetically sealed battery within a titanium case and use 
microelectronic circuitry to generate constant current electrical stimulation.
The IPG is insulated on all sides except the side with the markings. This allows the IPG case to be used as an 
anode for monopolar stimulation. Ensure that the marked side is implanted facing up and away from muscle.
The Libra IPG contains a radiopaque identification tag. The identification tag is visible inside the IPG header block 
using standard x-ray procedures. The tag contains a code: “ANS” identifies ANS as the manufacturer; “P” or “R” 
identifies the device as a Libra IPG Model 6608 or LibraXP Model 6644; and the two numbers following the “P” 
denote the year of manufacture (see Figure 1).
For year 2006, the code is P06.
P = Model 6608
R = Model 6644
FIGURE 1
LEADS AND EXTENSIONS
ANS DBS leads consist of electrodes on the distal end, connected by individually insulated wires to contact bands 
on the proximal end. The proximal end has a nonoperational metal band (the most distal band) that serves as an 
insertion handle. The insulated wires are covered by a biocompatible polymer. ANS DBS leads are designed for 
introduction into the brain using standard stereotactic neurosurgery techniques. 
The DBS extension is designed to connect the lead to the IPG. One end of the extension is designed to receive the 
proximal end of the lead, and the opposite end of the extension is designed for insertion and connection with the IPG.
Consult the Lead and Extension manual for more information and directions for use of these devices.
PROGRAMMER
The Libra Clinician Programmer controls the creation and adjustment of all programming parameters. The 
programmer uses radio-frequency signals to communicate with the IPG.
STERILIZATION INFORMATION
Sterile components in this kit have been sterilized using ethylene oxide (EtO) gas before shipment and are supplied 
in sterile packaging to permit direct introduction into the operative field. An expiration date (or ‘use-before date’) is 
marked on the label of each package.
� CAUTION:  ANS implantable components are intended for single use only. Do not resterilize.

SUGGESTED IMPLANT GUIDELINES
The implanting surgeon should carefully review the following suggested guidelines for implantation of a Libra system.
CONNECTING THE EXTENSION TO THE IPG
 1. If needed, clean the proximal end of the extension with sterile, deionized or distilled water and dry it 
completely. Use clean gloves and ensure that all body fluids and saline residue are cleaned from the proximal 
end of the extension. This is important to prevent future corrosion and potential failure of the system.
� CAUTION: Exposure of the internal IPG contacts to body fluid or saline can affect stimulation. If this 
occurs, clean the contacts with sterile, deionized or distilled water (not saline) and dry completely prior to 
extension connection and subsequent implantation.
 2. Slide a connector strain relief on to the proximal end of the extension, being careful not to sharply bend the 
extension (see Figure 2).
FIGURE 2
 3. Carefully slide the proximal end of the extension into the IPG header until it stops (see Figure 3).

 4. Use the torque wrench to tighten the setscrew clockwise until the torque wrench clicks (see Figure 4).
NOTE: After the torque wrench is removed, check the septum to ensure it has closed. If the septum is not 
closed, gently reseat the septum flaps.
� CAUTION: Use only the torque wrench included in the extension kit, IPG kit, or torque wrench kit (Model 
1101). If you need to loosen the setscrew, turn the setscrew (in quarter turns counterclockwise) only as far as 
necessary to remove the extension from the IPG header. Retracting the setscrew too far could cause damage 
to the septum.

IPG PLACEMENT
 1. Carefully place the IPG in a subcutaneous pocket, at a depth not to exceed 4 cm (1.5 inches), with the logo 
side facing toward the skin surface.
NOTE: The logo side of the IPG is uninsulated to enable monopolar stimulation. Implanting the IPG 
backwards may increase undesired muscle stimulation.
 2. Carefully coil any excess extension in loops no smaller than 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter and place them 
behind the IPG (see Figure 6). The loop(s) are intended to provide strain relief for the lead, extension, and 
IPG connections.
SN 123456

 3. To stabilize the IPG within the pocket and prevent movement, pass a suture through the hole at the top of the 
IPG header and secure it to the connective tissue.
 4. Before closing, verify that the system is operational by placing the wand from the Libra Clinician Programmer 
 
(6850) in a sterile bag and positioning the wand over the IPG site. 
NOTE: If a communication error occurs during programming, reposition the wand farther away from the 
IPG.
 5. Close the IPG pocket incision. The IPG in the pocket should be positioned away from the pocket incision 
suture line (see Figure 7).

IPG REPLACEMENT
 1. After ensuring that the IPG is turned off, open the IPG pocket per normal surgical procedure, and carefully 
remove the IPG from the pocket.
� CAUTION: Exercise extreme caution when using sharp instruments and electrocautery around the 
extension.
 2. Carefully remove the suture from the strain relief, being careful to not damage the extension (see Figure 5).
 3. Insert an ANS torque wrench into the IPG header septum and loosen the setscrew by turning it 
counterclockwise in quarter turns.
 4. Gently retract the extension from the IPG header. Clean and dry all contacts on the extension, ensuring they 
are free of fluid and tissue.
NOTE: If an extension needs to be replaced, do the following:
1.  
Make an incision above the extension connector assembly and disconnect the extension 
from the lead.
2.  
Sever the distal end of the extension just proximal to the extension connector assembly.
3.  
Carefully pull the extension out through the IPG pocket.
 5. Place a new strain relief over the extension. 
 6. Insert the extension into the new IPG.
 7. Tighten the setscrew clockwise until the torque wrench clicks.
 8. Remove the torque wrench and ensure the septum is closed.
 9. Slide the connector strain relief into position over the O-ring at the proximal end of the IPG. Tie a 2/0 non-
absorbable suture over the strain relief. 
 
10. Place the new IPG into the pocket, at a depth not to exceed 4 cm (1.5 inches) with the logo side facing 
outward away from the muscle layer.
 
11. Carefully coil any excess extension in loops no smaller than 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter and place them 
behind the IPG. 
 
12. To stabilize the IPG within the pocket and minimize movement, pass a suture through the hole at the top of 
the IPG header and secure it to the connective tissue.
 
13. Before closing, verify that the system is operational by placing the wand from the Libra Clinician Programmer 
 
(6850) in a sterile bag and positioning the wand over the IPG site. 
 
14. Close the IPG pocket incision.

CLINICIAN PROGRAMMER
OVERVIEW
The Libra Clinician Programmer (Model 6850) is an external device that is used to program the stimulation 
parameters of Libra neurostimulators via radio frequency telemetry. The major parts of the Clinician Programmer 
are shown in the following illustration.
The general flow of the programmer operation is as follows:
● 
the programmer provides a series of choices arranged in a loop. There are two types of choices: parameters 
(which have a value that can be adjusted) and actions (which cause an action to occur).
● 
 and 
 buttons are used to move forward and backward between the choices.
● 
the 
 and 
 buttons are used to change the value of the highlighted choice.
● 
the 
 button is used to initiate or select the highlighted choice.
● 
the 
 and 
 buttons are used only for very infrequent, special actions.

There are two types of choices in programming mode: actions and parameters. The following pages provide a 
description of the action and parameter choices available within programming mode.
 AMP
Use this to set the amplitude of the stimulation generated by the neurostimulator.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 
increases AMP by an amount equal to STEP
 
 
decreases AMP by an amount equal to STEP
This line shows the amplitude of the stimulation being generated by the neurostimulator, and allows it to be 
changed. When AMP is zero, it will display OFF. Stimulation amplitude can be adjusted in the following ways:
● 
Highlight the AMP line and press 
 or 
 to increase or decrease amplitude by an amount equal to 
STEP
● 
Press the red 
 button to turn amplitude off.
● 
Highlight JUMPTO, and then press 
 to change amplitude to the value shown on the JUMPTO 
line.
NOTE:  The � on the AMP or PW lines means that the charge density is above 30 µC/cm2 at the 
current AMP and PW settings. 
� WARNING: A potential risk of tissue damage exists with stimulation parameter settings of high amplitudes 
and wide pulse widths. High amplitude and pulse width settings required to achieve therapy may indicate a 
system problem or sub-optimal lead placement.
 CAN
Use this to set the polarity of the neurostimulator (can) case.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 
toggles the can polarity between ANODE and OFF
 
 
toggles the can polarity between ANODE and OFF
The neurostimulator case can be programmed to be either:  ANODE (a positive electrode, for monopolar 
stimulation), or OFF (not part of the stimulation circuit, for bipolar stimulation). Keep in mind the following when 
adjusting CAN:
● 
AMP will be turned off whenever CAN is changed
● 
AMP limits will be disabled whenever CAN is changed
● 
When CAN is set to ANODE, none of the electrodes on the lead can be set to anode. When CAN is 
changed to ANODE all electrodes on the lead set to anode will be automatically switched OFF.
● 
LibraXP: Both leads must have the same CAN setting. The CAN parameter can only be changed when 
programming lead 1. When programming lead 2, ANODE or OFF will be shown in brackets “[ ]” 
indicating that it cannot be changed.

 CHECK IMPEDANCE
Use this to obtain an estimate of the impedance of the system with the current stimulation parameters and electrode 
configuration. Also use this to obtain the impedance factor to calculate device longevity.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 starts a sequence that measures the system impedance
Impedance measurements can be helpful for troubleshooting problems, or estimating device longevity. See the 
Troubleshooting section of this manual for information on interpreting impedance measurements and Appendix C 
and D for information on calculating device longevity.
Before an impedance measurement can be taken, the programmer waits for the neurostimulator impedance 
measurement circuitry to stabilize. The programmer automatically calculates the required stabilization time, and 
displays a countdown on its screen. At any time after the stabilization time, position the wand over the 
neurostimulator and press the green 
 button to obtain the impedance measurement.
Impedance in Ohms
Impedance factor
  
NOTE: It is only necessary to hold the wand over the neurostimulator when the green 
 button is 
pressed. It is NOT necessary to hold the wand over the neurostimulator while the programmer is counting 
down.
NOTE: The stabilization time can be reduced by increasing AMP, FREQ or PW.
 DIA/LEN  (ELECTRODE DIAMETER AND LENGTH)
Use this to specify the dimensions (diameter and length) of the electrodes on the lead.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 
moves between the electrode diameter and length choices
 
 
moves between the electrode diameter and length choices
The programmer uses the electrode dimensions to calculate the average charge density, and displays a warning 
when it exceeds 30 µC/cm2. Each time the programmer is turned on, it resets this parameter to the smallest electrode 
dimensions. See the manual packaged with the DBS lead to determine the lead dimensions.

 EXIT
Use this to exit programming mode and return to the Home screen.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
exits programming mode and provides the choice to save or discard the changes made to the program
After finishing programming the neurostimulator, you must select EXIT to leave programming mode. Otherwise, 
the programmer will not turn off, and it will periodically beep to remind you to EXIT programming mode.
After selecting EXIT, you will be given the option to keep or discard the program changes you have just made. In 
certain circumstances when amplitude limits are enabled, you will also be prompted to adjust/confirm the amplitude 
limits.
� CAUTION: Always  EXIT programming mode and turn the programmer off and back on before attempting to 
program a different IPG. Failing to do so, can abruptly change stimulation parameters in the second IPG.
 FREQ
Use this to set the stimulation frequency.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 
increases the stimulation frequency in increments of 10 Hz
 
 
decreases the stimulation frequency in increments of 2 Hz
This line shows the frequency of the stimulation currently being generated by the neurostimulator, and allows it 
to be changed. FREQ (frequency) is the number of stimulation pulses delivered each second. Keep in mind the 
following points when adjusting FREQ:
● 
The highest frequencies may not be programmed with long pulse widths. The maximum frequencies are:
Max. FREQ for:
1 Lead
2 Leads
PW ≤ 248 µsec
240 Hz
200 Hz
PW > 248 µsec
220 Hz
180 Hz
● 
LibraXP: Both leads must have the same FREQ setting. FREQ can only be changed when programming 
lead 1. When programming lead 2, the FREQ parameter value will be shown in brackets “[ ]” indicating 
that it cannot be changed.

 GET STIM TIME
Use this to get information about stimulator use.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 reports the current values of TOTALDAYS and STIMDAYS
TOTALDAYS is the number of days since the neurostimulator was manufactured—whether or not stimulation 
output is on.
STIMDAYS is the number of days that stimulation was actually turned on. For example, if stimulation was turned 
on for 12 hours per day for 48 hours, then STIMDAYS counts this as one day, while TOTALDAYS counts it as two.
STIMDAYS and TOTALDAYS can be useful for troubleshooting and assessing patient compliance. See the 
Troubleshooting section of this manual for details.
 GO TO LEAD 1 / GO TO LEAD 2 (LIBRAXP ONLY)
Use this to move to (and program) the other lead on LibraXP neurostimulators.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
turns lead 1 stimulation off, and retrieves the stimulation parameters of lead 2 (and vice versa when 
going from lead 2 to lead 1)
When entering programming mode, a prompt will appear allowing you to select which lead to program. Stimulation 
output from the other lead is turned off while you program this lead, and vice versa.

 JUMPTO
Use this to immediately turn stimulation on at the amplitude shown on this line.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
immediately changes AMP to the amplitude displayed on the JUMPTO line
JUMPTO provides an alternate, shortcut method of adjusting the stimulation amplitude. Some of the uses for this 
feature may include:
● 
The JUMPTO line displays the value that the stimulation amplitude was at when the programming session 
was started, thereby providing a continuous reminder of the last programmed stimulation amplitude.
● 
The programmer automatically turns stimulation off when a programming session is started. JUMPTO 
provides a fast way to turn stimulation back on. This may be useful for patients that are sensitive to 
stimulation being turned off, but are tolerant of stimulation being quickly turned on.
� CAUTION: Some patients may be startled by abruptly turning on stimulation. Use the AMP line to 
gradually turn on stimulation in patients who are sensitive to abruptly turning on stimulation.
 MAGNET
Use this to set how the neurostimulator will respond if it senses a magnet.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 
toggles magnet mode between OFF and ON/OFF
 
 
toggles magnet mode between OFF and ON/OFF
The neurostimulator contains a sensor that detects the presence of a strong magnet. It can be programmed to 
respond to a magnet in two different ways:
● 
OFF: The neurostimulator will turn stimulation output OFF the first time it detects a magnet. Stimulation 
cannot be turned back on with the magnet.
● 
ON/OFF: The neurostimulator will toggle stimulation output between ON and OFF each time it detects a 
magnet.

 MODE
Use this to set the stimulation mode.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
enters the stimulation mode adjustment screen
The neurostimulator has two stimulation modes: continuous and cycle.
● 
Continuous mode produces stimulation until the neurostimulator is turned off via a magnet, programmer or 
QuikLink. 
● 
Cycle mode produces stimulation in a repeating cycle of a defined on time followed by a defined off time. 
The Home screen will display a “C” in the lower left corner when the neurostimulator is in cycle mode.
After entering the mode adjustment screen, use the 
 / 
 buttons to toggle between CONT (continuous) and 
CYCLE modes. When CYCLE is selected use the scroll butt 
ons and 
 / 
 buttons to adjust the H (hours), M 
(minutes) and S (seconds) cycle on and cycle off times in the stimulation mode adjustment screen. When finished, 
highlight DONE and press 
 to leave stimulation mode adjustment screen.
 POL
Use this to set the polarity of the electrodes on the lead.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
when CAN is OFF, changes the polarity of the electrode from 0 (OFF) to + (anode) to – (cathode)
 
when CAN is ANODE, changes the polarity of the electrode from 0 (OFF) to – (cathode)
 
when CAN is OFF, changes the polarity of the electrode from 0 (OFF), to – (cathode) to + (anode) 
 
when CAN is ANODE, changes the polarity of the electrode from 0 (OFF), to – (cathode)
The electrodes on ANS leads are numbered 1 through “X”, with the most distal electrode designated electrode 
#1. The programmer supports programming Libra neurostimulators with a single lead with up to 8 electrodes, and 
LibraXP neurostimulators with two leads with 4 electrodes each.
Electrode 2 = (–) CATHODE
Electrode 1 = OFF

PW
Use this to set the pulse width of the stimulation produced by the neurostimulator.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 
increases the width of the stimulation pulse by 13 microseconds
 
 
decreases the width of the stimulation pulse by 13 microseconds
This line shows the pulse width of the stimulation currently being generated by the neurostimulator, and allows it to 
be changed. The longest pulse widths may not be programmed with the highest frequencies (see FREQ for details).
 RAMPTIME
Use this to set how long stimulation will take to ramp up to the programmed amplitude when the neurostimulator is 
turned on.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 
moves to the next longer ramp time
 
 
moves to the next shorter ramp time
Some patients may find it more comfortable to have stimulation gradually ramp up when the neurostimulator is 
turned on, as opposed to jumping directly to the programmed amplitude. This line allows you to set how quickly 
stimulation is increased when the neurostimulator is turned on. The ramp time choices are 0, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 45, and 
60 seconds. Both leads on a LibraXP use the same ramp time.
NOTE: RAMPTIME is not used in programming mode. In programming mode, amplitude changes are 
made as fast as practicable.
 SET AMP LIMITS
Use this to enable and set the values of the amplitude limits, or disable amplitude limits.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
enters the amplitude limits configuration screen
Libra neurostimulators give you the option to allow your patients to adjust their stimulation within your prescribed 
amplitude limits using their controller. This feature is enabled from the amplitude limits configuration screen by 
changing MIN or MAX so that they are not equal to AMP. Amplitude limits are disabled by setting MIN and MAX 
equal to AMP. When finished, highlight DONE and press 
 to leave stimulation mode adjustment screen.
● 
MAX is the maximum amplitude to which patients will be able to increase their stimulation amplitude.
● 
MIN is the minimum amplitude (other than OFF) to which patients will be able to decrease their 
stimulation amplitude.
● 
STEP is the increment by which stimulation amplitude will be adjusted each time the increase amplitude 
or decrease amplitude button is pressed.

27
Each time the increase amplitude or decrease amplitude button is pressed, stimulation amplitude is adjusted by 
an amount equal to STEP. This allows you to control both the range (from MIN to MAX) and the number of 
amplitude choices that you prescribe. Some patients may find it easier to have only a few choices whereas others 
may need the fine-tuning that can be provided with more, smaller increments.
NOTE: STEP should be adjusted before entering the amplitude limits configuration screen. Adjusting 
STEP afterward may cause MIN and/or MAX to reset.
NOTE: STEP, MIN and MAX should be set just prior to exiting programming mode. Upon exiting 
programming mode, the programmer will automatically prompt you to change MIN if it is no longer less 
than or equal to AMP, or MAX if it is no longer less than or equal to AMP.
 STEP
Use this to set the increment by which AMP will be adjusted both in programming mode, and in amplitude 
adjustment mode.
Highlighting this line and pressing:
 
 
increase STEP by 0.05mA
 
 
decrease STEP by 0.05mA
This line shows the increment by which the stimulation amplitude will be increased or decreased when the AMP 
line is highlighted and the 
 or 
 button is pressed. This allows you to change how stimulation is stepped up. 
A larger step size can be used to quickly make large amplitude changes, and a smaller step size allows fine tuning 
of the amplitude.
This parameter is also used to set the increment by which amplitude will be increased or decreased when using 
amplitude limits. Keep in mind the following points when using STEP for amplitude limits:
● 
STEP can be increased to reduce the number of amplitude steps offered to a patient. This may make it 
easier for patients to use and understand.
● 
LibraXP:  The STEP value for lead 1 can be different than the STEP value for lead 2.

AMPLITUDE ADJUSTMENT MODE
Amplitude adjustment mode is accessible from the Home screen when amplitude limits have been enabled. See 
SET AMP LIMITS for information on enabling amplitude adjustment mode. See the Home screen section for 
information on accessing amplitude adjustment mode. 
In this mode, the 
 and 
 buttons can be used to adjust stimulation amplitude in the same way that a patient 
provided with a QuikLink controller would do so.
Adjusting amplitude via amplitude adjustment mode is slightly different than doing so through programming mode, 
which may provide you with additional flexibility. Specifically:
● 
Programming mode must be used to enable and configure amplitude limits, and to set all parameters. 
Amplitude adjustment mode only allows amplitude to be adjusted.
● 
Stimulation is turned off when entering programming mode, but not when entering amplitude adjustment 
mode.
● 
LibraXP:  In amplitude adjustment mode, amplitude can be adjusted while stimulation is being delivered to 
both leads, whereas in programming mode it cannot.
Highlighting an AMP value and pressing:
 
 
increases stimulation amplitude by an amount equal to STEP
 
 
decreases stimulation amplitude by an amount equal to STEP

TROUBLESHOOTING
DAILY CHANGE IN STIMULATION SENSATION
The Libra and LibraXP IPGs perform a battery diagnostic every 24 hours, which momentarily interrupts 
stimulation. If a patient reports a sensation that occurs at the same time every day, he or she is most likely sensing 
the battery diagnostic. For help reprogramming the IPG to alleviate this sensation, contact ANS Customer Service 
at +1-972-309-8000.
NEUROSTIMULATOR BATTERY WARNINGS
Libra neurostimulators contain circuitry to detect when their battery voltage has fallen below a preset “low battery” 
level, and when it has fallen below a preset “battery depleted” level. When this occurs, the programmer will display 
the corresponding warning.
IPG Battery Depleted Warning (EOL – End of Life)
When the “EOL warning” is displayed, the neurostimulator battery is depleted and stimulation may stop abruptly 
without further warning.
� WARNING: Schedule neurostimulator replacement surgery NOW. 
 
The EOL Warning indicates that the neurostimulator battery is depleted and stimulation can abruptly stop at 
any time without further warning. Consider the effects that an abrupt cessation of stimulation and return of 
the underlying symptoms would have on this patient, and as appropriate, place the patient under continuous 
monitoring until surgery and/or make plans to manage the underlying symptoms.
IPG Battery Very Low Warning
When the “IPG Battery Very Low” warning appears, do the following
 1. Enter programming mode.
 2. Use GET STIM TIME to obtain the value of STIMDAYS. Write down this value.
 3. Use CHECK IMPEDANCE to obtain the current value of the impedance factor.
 4. Use APPENDIX C or D to calculate the estimated device longevity at the current stimulation parameters.
 5. If STIMDAYS and the calculated longevity are approximately equal, then schedule replacement IPG surgery. 
Otherwise, call ANS Customer Service for assistance in determining whether or not to clear the IPG low 
battery flag.

Libra DBS System Clinician’s Manual
CLEARING AN IPG LOW BATTERY FLAG
In certain situations, particularly when using low stimulation parameters and/or regularly turning the 
neurostimulator off, a neurostimulator may prematurely trigger a battery warning. This is caused by a battery 
passivation layer that will dissipate after the neurostimulator is used more. The neurostimulator is fully 
functional, and the battery has its full specified capacity. This situation may recur multiple times with the same 
neurostimulator.
To clear a low battery flag proceed as follows
 1. While the low battery warning is displayed on the screen, press the 
 button, then the 
 button.
 2. When the following screen appears, press the 
 button.
  3. Instruct the patient to use their controller to check the battery status regularly and contact you if the low 
battery warning reappears. The low battery flag may need to be cleared more than once.
IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS
Impedance measurements can be helpful for troubleshooting problems, or estimating device longevity. To obtain an 
impedance measurement, enter programming mode and use the CHECK IMPEDANCE action. After the impedance 
measurement is taken, the screen will appear as shown below. The impedance in ohms is displayed followed by the 
impedance factor in parentheses.
  
Impedance in Ohms
Impedance factor
  
Keep in mind the following when interpreting impedance measurements:
● 
When the impedance factor is zero: A zero impedance factor indicates that the neurostimulator output is very 
low. When the patient is receiving effective stimulation at this output, the device longevity will be very good 
(use Appendix C or D to calculate longevity). However, because the neurostimulator output is very low, it is 
not possible to obtain a definitive impedance measurement—only an estimate of the maximum value. For this 
reason, the impedance reading is always reported as being “< xxxx” (less than xxxxΩ) when the impedance 
factor is zero.
NOTE: If the patient can tolerate it, AMP can be temporarily increased to the point that the impedance factor 
becomes non-zero, and thereby obtain a better impedance estimate. This value of the impedance factor should 
not be used for estimating longevity.

● 
Erratic sequential impedance measurements: Sequential impedance measurements taken at the same 
stimulation parameters should be consistent (±1 impedance factor). If you obtain very different impedance 
measurements at the same stimulation parameters, this may indicate a system problem. Contact ANS customer 
service for assistance.
● 
HIGH impedance readings: There are two situations in which the impedance will be reported as “HIGH.” 
One is when the impedance is over 3000 Ohms. The other is when the impedance factor is 31. Impedance 
factor 31 indicates that the neurostimulator cannot deliver the required current. This may indicate that there is 
an open circuit. Contact ANS customer service for assistance. 
TEMP PROGRAM
     
 
Libra, Model 6608 
LibraXP, Model 6644
The temp program message indicates that the stimulation program was not correctly saved at the end of the prior 
programming session. When the programmer detects a temp program, it will not allow the neurostimulator to be 
turned on. Instead, the only option the programmer gives is to enter programming mode so that the stimulation 
parameters can be adjusted as necessary, and the program properly saved.
NOTE: For Libra neurostimulators (Model 6608), the temp program stimulation parameters are retained when 
entering programming mode. So, if the patient was getting acceptable results from the temp program, then you 
can simply enter programming mode, and then immediately EXIT to properly save the program and correct 
this situation.
For LibraXP neurostimulators (Model 6644), the program stimulation parameters are reset to factory defaults 
and stimulation is turned off. Enter programming mode and reprogram the IPG.
HIGH CHARGE DENSITY
The programmer automatically checks every amplitude and pulse width increase request to determine if it will 
cause the maximum average charge density to be exceeded. If so, the programmer first asks you to confirm the 
electrode size (diameter and length). Then, if after the electrode size is confirmed, the charge density is too high, it 
displays the charge density warning shown below.
     
Selecting YES sends the requested increase to the neurostimulator and allows you to exceed the maximum 
recommended charge density. While the charge density is being exceeded, a warning symbol will appear next on 
the AMP and PW lines, and on the Home screen. Selecting NO cancels the requested increase.

This message appears when the frequency or pulse width requested would exceed the capabilities of the IPG. (See 
Freq for details.) Decrease frequency so that pulse width can be increased, or vice versa.
This error occurs when the programmer was unsuccessful in its attempt to communicate with the neurostimulator. 
It may be possible to correct this by repositioning the wand over the neurostimulator, or moving away from sources 
of electromagnetic interference.
NOTE: If the COMM error occurs while you are in programming mode, you will be taken to the Home 
screen and required to re-enter programming mode. In addition, the LibraXP will lose the changes made since 
the program was last saved.

APPENDIX C: BATTERY LONGEVITY FOR LIBRA
The battery life of the IPG depends on the parameters you have selected, the impedance that the current encounters 
in the neurostimulation circuit, and the hours per day it is used. To optimize the Libra IPG battery life for patients 
who require programming parameters resulting in Impedance Factors equal to or greater than one (1), try reducing 
the amplitude slightly and increasing the pulse width. Doing so may lower the impedance factor and reduce battery 
drain. This Appendix provides the information necessary to calculate the initial estimated life of the Libra IPG. 
These estimates are based on the selected stimulation parameters and will account for the electrode impedance. 
LIBRA DBS SYSTEM LONGEVITY CALCULATION
To estimate the battery life of an implanted Libra DBS System, perform the following calculations:
NOTE: Please contact ANS to determine the longevity for any reading with an impedance factor greater than

APPENDIX E: LIBRA SYSTEM AND MRI SAFETY FOR THE LIBRA IPG
MRI ASTM Guidelines
Risks
MRI machines have the potential to induce deflection, torque, and heating of implanted medical devices. 
Additionally, implanted medical devices can interfere with the MRI to create artifacts in the resulting image. 
ASTM Test Standards have been developed to quantify these effects in order to evaluate the safety concerns 
involving MRI scans on patients with an implanted medical device.
Testing and Results
Testing was conducted on the Libra DBS Systems (Libra and LibraXP IPGs) to determine the affect of the MRI 
environment on the implanted system. The induced mechanical forces, torque and deflection, were evaluated under 
worst-case conditions in a 1.5T MRI magnet. The MRI scanner, the software used, and the parameters under which 
the scans were conducted are inherent to the results of any testing. The following testing was performed using a 
1.5T GE Medical Systems LX Echospeed System with 9.0 software. The system’s magnet was a superconducting, 
cylindrical self-shielded, LCC magnet (CX-K4) manufactured by GE Medical Systems. The MRI environment 
induced no mechanical forces on the leads or extensions used with the Libra DBS System. This is explained by the 
lack of magnetic materials in the lead and extension. The Libra and LibraXP IPGs experienced mechanical forces 
less than the maximum torque and deflection on the device due to gravity. The maximum mechanical force due to 
gravity is considered to be a conservative criteria by the ASTM standards.
Quantitative analysis of RF heating on the Libra DBS Systems was conducted in vitro using a 16-rung, quadrature 
birdcage, transmit/receive headcoil (GE Medical Systems, Model 46-282118G2). Although this testing following 
the applicable ASTM standard showed minimal heating at higher SAR levels, the maximum recommended SAR 
level of 0.4 W/kg should be followed for clinical MRI scanning of patients with implanted medical devices. All 
scanning should be limited to a head-only, transmit and receive head coil in a 1.5T MR System. Configurations 
were tested with one loop approximately 3–4 cm in diameter at the burr hole site and 1–1.5 loops approximately 
4–4.5 cm in diameter beneath the IPG. 
For the Libra IPG: At a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of  3.1 W/kg, the maximum temperature rise was 4.6 
degrees Celsius when testing a unilateral implant; at an SAR of 1.7 W/kg, the maximum temperature rise was 2.5 
degrees Celsius for a unilateral implant. At an SAR of 3.1 W/kg, the maximum temperature rise was 6.2 degrees 
Celsius when testing a bilateral implant; at an SAR of 1.7 W/kg, the maximum temperature rise was 2.4 degrees 
Celsius for a bilateral implant.
For the dual header LibraXP IPG: At an SAR of 3.1 W/kg, the maximum temperature rise was 3.8 degrees 
Celsius when testing a unilateral implant. For a bilateral configuration with the extensions less than 0.25 cm apart, 
the maximum heating at an SAR of 1.6 W/kg was 4 degrees Celsius at the left tip electrode and 2.9 degrees Celsius 
at the right tip electrode.
Artifact testing was conducted on the Libra DBS Systems to determine the extent of image distortion. Image 
distortion occurs within 1.0 cm of the lead, 2.8 cm of the extension, 10.4 cm of the Libra IPG, and 12.7 cm of 
the LibraXP IPG. These distortion areas should be used as a guideline to anticipate image disruption due to the 
implanted device. Implanted devices are unlikely to impair the diagnostic use of MR imaging when the area of 
interest is beyond the distortion area listed for the specific device. Artifact testing was conducted at worst-case 
conditions and followed the applicable ASTM standard.

Libra DBS System Clinician’s Manual
MRI Safety Guidelines
Implant Recommendations
● 
The Libra DBS Systems should be implanted as close to the centerline of the patient as possible. Avoid 
unnecessary offset of the IPG and extensions. Safety testing was conducted with the lead tip within 0.5 cm, the 
extension within 5.7 cm, and the IPG center within 9 cm of the centerline.
● 
Placing a loop in the lead and beneath the IPG allows for strain relief of the system at the connection points. 
Heating tests were conducted with a loop approximately 3–4 cm in diameter at the burr hole and one and a half 
loops approximately 4–4.5 cm in diameter beneath the IPG.
● 
Avoid implanting the IPG in the mid to lower torso of the patient and avoid unnecessary offset of the system. 
Safety testing was conducted with the IPG in the upper torso, 28 cm below the landmark and within 9 cm of 
the centerline.
● 
Avoid separation of the extensions when using a LibraXP IPG for bilateral stimulation. Separation of the 
extensions increases the distance of one extension along the y-axis away from the centerline of the magnet 
when scanning a patient in the upright, supine position.
Pre-scan Preparation
An appropriate health care professional with access to a Libra Clinician Programmer should be available to assist 
and prepare the patient’s device for the MRI procedure as described below:
● 
The patient should be in the supine position when in the magnet to bring the implant as close to the centerline 
of the magnet as possible.
● 
If the IPG has already been implanted, record the patient’s current therapeutic settings, set the IPG’s amplitude 
to 0 mA, set the Magnet mode to Off, and turn the IPG output to Off.
● 
Instruct the patient to alert the MRI system operator of any problems (heating, shocks, vision impairment, etc.) 
so the operator can terminate the MRI if needed.
 
CAUTION: Due to the risk of localized heating that may result in tissue damage, an MRI procedure should 
not be performed on a patient with a Libra DBS System that is suspected to have a broken lead or extension 
wire. If a broken lead or extension wire is suspected, an x-ray should be obtained prior to an MRI to verify the 
presence of the broken wire. Additionally, the test procedure detailed in Appendix I may be run on the Libra 
DBS System to test for an open circuit due to broken lead or extension wires.
MRI Scanner Parameters and Settings
● 
Use only MRI systems operating at a static magnetic field strength of 1.5 Tesla.
● 
Use only a transmit and receive type RF head coil to minimize the exposure of the Libra DBS System to the 
MRI RF fields. Do not use a whole body RF coil, a head coil that extends over the chest area, a head coil that 
is not both a transmit and receive type RF coil.
● 
Select imaging parameters to perform MRI at a specific absorption rate (SAR) that does not exceed 0.4W/kg in 
the head.
● 
Carefully perform continuous verbal and visual monitoring of the patient throughout the MRI procedure.

This consent form may contain words that you do not understand.  Please ask the study 
doctor or the study staff to explain any words or procedures that you do not clearly 
understand.  
 
You are being asked to take part in a research study.  However, before you agree to take part in 
this study, please read this consent form.  Please ask as many questions as you need to be sure 
you understand the possible risks and benefits.  
 
It is important for you to understand that, if you participate in the study, you are required to 
transfer your psychiatric care to the study psychiatrist for the length of the study.  The study 
psychiatrists will need to be able to have access to a sufficient amount of your psychiatric 
medical history in order to verify eligibility for the study. 
 
This consent form contains important facts to help you decide if it is in your best interest to take 
part in this study.  If you have any questions that are not answered in this consent form, one of 
the research staff will be happy to give you further information.  
 
Introduction 
 
You are being asked to participate in a one year research study of a new surgical procedure to 
treat severe depression. The procedure is called Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). This procedure 
requires an operation on your brain to place DBS electrodes.  The DBS system used in this study 
(trade name Libra Deep Brain Stimulation System from Advanced Neuromodulation Systems) 
is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use and is considered a 
“significant risk” device.  This system has been approved by the FDA for use in this experiment. 
 
The DBS electrodes will provide electrical stimulation to a part of your brain called the 
subgenual cingulated cortex or Brodmann Area 25 (cg25).  You are being asked to participate in 
the study because you have a severe form of depression that has not responded to several 
standard treatments. 
 
The goal of the present study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DBS (stimulating 
Brodmann 25) in the treatment of severe depression. DBS refers to the electrical stimulation of 
structures deep within the brain.  Brodmann Area 25 is a part of your brain about the size of a 
Page 111 of 291
  
 
ANS C-07-01

sugar cube near the front and middle of your brain thought to control mood.  DBS is not 
currently approved to treat severe depression.  You will be one of 201 people, from up to 20 
sites, who take part in this study. 
 
The study doctor in charge of this study or a member of the study staff has discussed with you 
the requirements for participation in this study.  It is important that you are completely truthful 
with the study doctor and staff about your health history.  You should not participate in this study 
if you do not meet all qualifications.   
 
CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATION 
To participate in this study you must be currently depressed. You must be a male or female 
between the ages of 21-70. You must have failed several treatments for depression.  If you are 
currently taking antidepressant medications, you must have been on these medications at the 
same doses for the 4 weeks prior to enrolling in the study and the first six months of the study 
(unless side effects require a decrease in dose).  You must currently be receiving care from a 
psychiatrist. You must be willing to transfer your psychiatric care to the study psychiatrist for the 
length of the study.  You must also be willing to sign a written release of information to allow 
the study team to share information with your psychiatrist about your participation in this study 
and for your psychiatrist to share information with us. 
 
You cannot participate in this study if it is not safe for you to have general anesthesia required 
for surgery. You cannot participate if you are currently suicidal or have had more than 3 serious 
attempts in the past 12 months.  You cannot participate if you have been diagnosed with 
fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue disorder, a history of major psychotic episodes, chronic pain 
disorders requiring certain medication, substance abuse or dependence in last 12 months (e.g. 
alcohol, medication, cocaine, marijuana), neurological disorder that impairs motor, sensory or 
cognitive functions, bipolar I or II disorder, and other types of psychiatric disorders.  You cannot 
participate if you have a diagnosis of sleep apnea that is not currently treated. You cannot 
participate if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study.  You cannot 
participate if you have a cardiac pacemaker or other implanted electrical device. You cannot 
participate in this study if you have had electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the last three months 
or will require ECT for the duration of this study. You cannot participate if you have a history of 
epilepsy or status epilepticus. You cannot participate if you plan to use diathermy at any time 
during the study. You cannot participate if you have any metallic implants such as aneurysm 
clips in the vicinity of Brodmann Area 25 or cochlear implants your study doctor feels may 
interfere with the implant of the ANS device. You cannot participate in this study if you are 
currently participating or plan to participate in another investigational device, drug or surgical 
study. You also may not participate in this study if you have any medical conditions requiring an 
MRI; Conditions that require chemotherapy for the treatment of a malignancy or requiring 
chronic oral or intravenous steroid therapy; Females lactating or of child bearing potential, with a 
positive pregnancy test or not using adequate birth control; and/or a medical condition requiring

Procedures 
 
Screening Visits 
After enrolling in the study, you will have three screening visits in order to determine your 
eligibility to be in this study.  There will be at least two weeks between each visit.   
 
During the first screening visit, your doctor will determine whether you are eligible for the study.  
This visit will include recording your current condition and symptom.  The first screening visit 
will take about four hours to complete.  At this visit, the following procedures will occur: 
• 
You will be asked about your medical and family history, current health problems and 
medications; 
• 
You will have a physical exam; 
• 
If you are female, you may be asked to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test; 
• 
You will be asked to complete several questionnaires regarding your mood and your 
quality of life; 
• 
The study psychiatrist will ask you questions about your mood, functioning, physical 
symptoms and quality of life. 
 
Some of your answers will be videotaped. 
 
During the second screening visit, the doctor will ask you several questions about your mood and 
symptoms.  You will also be asked to complete some questionnaires.  This visit will take about 
60 minutes. 
 
The third screening visit will occur at least two weeks before surgery. During this visit, the 
doctor will ask you several questions about your mood and symptoms. If you qualify for the 
study after answering the questions, you will meet with the neurosurgeon that will explain the 
procedure, and perform an exam to make sure you can have surgery.  You will schedule a time 
for several tests on your memory and cognitive function (how your thought processes are 
working). You may also schedule a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan before the surgery.  
This is a picture of your brain, which will allow the neurosurgeon to rule out any problems. You 
will not feel any pain as part of this scan. Because of the number of these tests, this visit could 
take up to four hours.   
 
Medications 
You may continue to take antidepressant and other medications during this study. However, you 
must stay on the same medications at the same doses during the four weeks prior to enrolling 
into the study and during the 6 months following surgery (excluding sleep aids and other meds to 
manage non-depression related conditions). 
 
Neurosurgical Exam 
You will meet with the neurosurgeon who will explain the planned surgical procedure.  The 
neurosurgeon will perform a detailed physical examination. A small amount of blood (about 30-
40 milliliters or 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn. The neurosurgeon will review your blood and 
urine tests to make sure that you are medically able to undergo brain surgery. You will sign a 
separate surgical consent just prior to the operation.

Surgery 
You will be admitted to the hospital on the morning of the surgery. A MRI scan will be obtained 
and used in the operating room to place the surgical frame and the DBS electrodes.  
DBS system includes: 
• Two leads, which consists of insulated wires with four electrodes at the end 
• Two extensions, which connects the lead to the power source 
• Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG), which is the power source. 
 
The IPG is a metal “can” about 2 inches in diameter and about ½ inch thick that is inserted like a 
pacemaker under the skin. It contains a small battery and produces the electrical impulses needed 
for stimulation. Battery life varies for each patient, depending on the type and intensity of 
stimulation needed for good symptom relief. For patients using electrical stimulation to treat 
disabling tremor and chronic pain, battery life has typically been three to five years when used 
continuously. When it is time to replace the battery, minor surgery is required to remove the used 
IPG and insert a new one. 
 
In the operating room, local anesthesia will be used to numb your scalp, an incision measuring 
approximately 2 inches long will be made on each side of your head, and then two holes will be 
placed in the top of your skull (one on each side of your head) to obtain access to your brain. The 
neurosurgeon will then insert two small electrodes into your brain. The electrodes contain special 
contacts attached to tiny wires that come out of the holes made in your skull. 
 
Immediately after insertion of the electrodes, you will have a second procedure (approximately 
45 minutes under general anesthesia) to connect the electrodes to the extension cable that is 
tunneled under the skin behind your ear, and this is then connected to the IPG which will be 
placed below your collarbone, just under your skin. Following surgery, you will have an image 
taken to make sure that the electrodes are in the right place.  
 
Randomization 
There will be 2 groups in the study.  The group you are assigned to will be chosen by chance 
(like flipping a coin). This will happen only after the surgery is completed. At that time, you will 
be randomly assigned to treatment Group A or Group B.  You have a 67% chance (2 out of 3) of 
being in Group A.  You have a 33% chance (1 out of 3) of being in Group B.  If you are 
randomly assigned to Group A your doctor will turn your DBS system on.  If you are randomly 
assigned to Group B your DBS system will not be turned on until 6 months after your system has 
been fully implanted. 
 
Neither you nor the study doctor will know which group you are in. 
 
 
Follow-up visits 
After the system implant, the study period will last approximately 12 months.   
You will return to the neurosurgeon’s office within 2 weeks after surgery to check your wounds 
and healing process.  You will also need to return to the study psychiatrist’s office 14 times for 
study related visits, which will occur 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 
months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months and 1 year after your

system has been fully implanted.  You will receive a phone call a few days before each visit, to 
remind you of your upcoming appointment. You will also be assigned a case manager from the 
study psychiatrist’s office who will keep in contact with you throughout the length of the study. 
 
Case Manager Visits 
You will have scheduled visits with your case manager a minimum of every two weeks to a 
maximum of weekly for the length of the study.  The case manager will follow your care for the 
duration of the study. 
 
Post-operative follow up visit (within weeks after surgery) 
This visit will occur within two weeks after surgery at the neurosurgeon’s office.  The following 
procedures will occur: 
• 
Your neurosurgeon will ask if you have had any complications since surgery 
• 
Your neurosurgeon will check your wounds for any sign of infection, to possibly 
remove sutures and to make sure you are healing properly. 
 
Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8, and Months 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 Visits 
At these visits, the following procedures will occur: 
• 
You will be asked if you have had any complications since your last visit

At the end of this study, you will be asked to participate in a long-term study.  The study staff 
will tell you more about that study at that time.  You will be given a separate informed consent 
form for that study. 
 
Risks and Discomforts 
 
This study is designed to test a new treatment for your depression.  There may be some risks, 
discomforts, or side effects that are not yet known. 
 
Risk of Surgery 
As with any surgery, there are risks involved from the surgery and/or the anesthesia.  Your 
doctor will discuss these with you. The risk of serious complications from surgical placement of 
the electrodes is estimated at 8-10%. This is based on known risks of similar surgery done in 
different brain targets for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other conditions. The most 
serious risk of surgery is bleeding into the brain (7-8%). Bleeding into the brain can lead to death 
or stroke that may result in permanent neurological deficits (8-9%), including weakness, 
paralysis, seizures or convulsions, difficulty speaking, impaired thinking and loss of feeling. The 
risk of death with the general anesthesia for implantation of the pacemaker is small. Damage to 
brain tissue might also be experienced. There is also a possibility of bleeding under the skin of 
your scalp. You may experience pain, discomfort and/or swelling at the sites of the incisions in 
the head and chest, and at the sites where the pins of the stereotactic frame go. These problems 
generally go away within 1 week.  You can also have air entering the veins or brain which can 
cause damage.  Air entering the brain may cause confusion leading to an extra day stay in the 
hospital.  Cerebrospinal fluid or fluid around the brain may leak or be found to be abnormal 
during the surgery. An additional surgery may be necessary to manage some complications.  
 
Risk of DBS Treatment  
While using the device several complications can occur. Occasionally, you might experience 
headache, disequilibrium (unbalance feeling), paresis (partial loss of limb movement), sleep 
disturbance, and sensory deficit. Less common complications would include neuralgia (painful 
feeling of nerves), cognitive impairments (confusion, abnormal thinking, hallucinations, 
alteration of mentation, amnesia, delusions or dementia), ataxia (loss of coordination of legs or 
trunk muscles), hearing and visual disturbance, apathy, eye disorder, drowsiness, difficulty 
breathing, increased salivation, rapid heart rate, pneumonia, edema including periorbital 
(swelling), and syncope (fainting).  Some rare complications include neuropathy (problems with 
nerves) and myoclonus (jerking or twitching movements). Other complications that might occur 
during the study include fever, attention deficit, dysarthria (slowed or slurred speech), suicide or 
suicide attempt, increase in drug side effects, autonomic instability (change in vital signs), 
urinary incontinence, worsening depression symptoms, anxiety, ruminativeness, hypomania, 
mania, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms, psychosis, sweating, 
diarrhea, and nausea and/or vomiting. 
 
Risk of Device 
It is also possible that an implanted electrode or IPG may move, break or become dislodged. 
There is also the chance of allergic reaction to the device. Care must be taken to see that 
implanted devices do not become infected. This could cause an infection not only in the area of 
the implanted device, but an infection that involves the whole body. Such an infection would 
require treatment with antibiotics and possibly surgery to remove the stimulation system. The 
risk of infection or malfunction of the DBS device and/or IPG is about 10.6%. It may be 
Page 116 of 291
  
 
ANS C-07-01 
 
 
7 of 11 
 
Patient Initials ______ 
 
necessary to remove the DBS device. Reasons for removing the device include damage to device 
or infection that does not respond to antibiotics. If your depression does not improve over time or 
you experience a worsening in your clinical condition, the investigators will discuss with you the 
options of removing the device. Removal of the device has a very low risk of serious 
complications but they are the same as those associated with surgical implantations of the device 
(see above).  The loss of therapeutic response, tingling sensation, initial jolt or tingling during 
start of the device, undesirable changes in stimulation, or wearing away of skin over IPG site, 
burr hole cap or extensions, persistent pain or redness at IPG site or extension may result as a 
complication related to the device. 
 
At a Neurological Devices Advisory Panel held in March 2000, data was presented that found 
that during a study of Parkinson’s disease patients receiving deep brain stimulator implantations 
(in a different part of the brain), 139 of 159 patients experienced one or more adverse events. 
Serious adverse events were experienced by 52.2% of patients including 6.3% of patients who 
experienced hemiparalysis or hemiparesis in the one study. The rate of any adverse event was 
about 88%. In that study the system was implanted into either the globus pallidus or the 
subthalamic nucleus, which are two different locations in the brain. In 2002, the device was 
approved by the FDA for “bilateral stimulation of the internal globus pallidus (Gpi) or the 
subthalamic nucleus (STN) as an adjunctive therapy in reducing some of the symptoms of 
advanced, levodopa-responsive Parkinson’s disease that are not adequately controlled with 
medication.” The device used in the study reported was made by a different manufacturer but is 
similar to the ANS device you will be receiving. It cannot be determined at this time whether the 
risks will be more, less or the same as those reported at the panel meeting. If you have any 
questions regarding the risks that could occur, please discuss your concerns with your implanting 
physician. 
 
You may require additional neurosurgical procedures to manage one of the complications listed 
above, or to replace a fractured lead.  You may also require further surgical procedures to replace 
the IPG device when the battery expires.   
 
Additional risks of having a DBS system: 
 
You should not be exposed to diathermy (deep heating) treatments that are sometimes used for 
muscle relaxation. Energy from diathermy can be transferred through the implanted system and 
can cause tissue damage at the location of the implanted electrodes, resulting in severe injury or 
death. Please be aware that you should always inform your health care providers that you have 
an implanted DBS system and should not be exposed to any type of diathermy. 
 
You should not be exposed to repeat Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRIs have the 
potential to induce repositioning, rotation, and heating in implanted medical devices. Exposure to 
MRI with an implanted DBS system may also cause permanent neurological damage or even 
death. If you need regular MRI to monitor another medical condition, you cannot participate in 
this study.  
 
The risks of performing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with DBS are not known, but may 
include serious neurological injury or death. You should not have ECT with an implanted DBS 
system whether the device is active (ON) or inactive (OFF).  If your depression worsens and you 
choose to have ECT after the first 6 month period or withdrawal from the study we will discuss 
Page 117 of 291
  
 
ANS C-07-01 
 
 
8 of 11 
 
Patient Initials ______ 
 
with you whether the DBS device should be removed beforehand.  In addition, you should not 
receive rTMS or MST therapy with an implanted DBS system. 
 
The long-term effects of DBS for depression are not known. There may be side effects or risks 
that are not yet known. You will be monitored carefully to determine if you are experiencing a 
reaction to DBS.  
 
Reproductive Risks 
If you are a female of childbearing potential, you will be asked to take a urine pregnancy test to 
ensure you are currently not pregnant.  You will also be required to use proper birth control 
methods for the duration of the study.  Women who are currently nursing a child are not allowed 
to take part in this study. 
 
Safeguards 
 
If you agree to participate in this study, you must report all of your past and present diseases to 
the Investigator.  Any allergies you have must also be reported.  
 
Potential Benefit 
 
Deep brain stimulation has the potential to improve your depression.  However, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the treatment you receive will be more effective than classical antidepressant 
treatments.  This study may help future patients suffering from major depression.  You may not 
directly benefit from participating in this study.  
 
Alternatives to Being in this Study 
 
If you are not to be able to have an implant or if you choose not to undergo the surgical 
procedure to implant the system, you will have the chance to discuss other treatment options with 
your doctor.  There may be other medications or forms of psychotherapy that may help you.  
Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) is another alternative that has been used to treat depression 
that is unresponsive to conventional treatments.  There is also an FDA approved potential 
surgical alternative treatment called vagus nerve stimulation.  Another option will be to continue 
your current method of treatment.  You should discuss other treatment alternatives with your 
psychiatrist before choosing to participate in this study. 
   
Confidentiality 
 
We will protect information about you and your taking part in this research study to the best of 
our ability.  If information about this study is published, your name will not be given.  However, 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the ______________________ Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), your doctors and designated representatives of the study sponsor, 
Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Inc. (ANS), may sometimes look at the medical records 
and study information of those who take part in this study.  Representatives of ANS may be 
given permission to be present during the surgical procedure.    
 
A court of law could order medical records shown to other people, but that is unlikely.  However, 
absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.

Neuromodulation Systems, Inc. (ANS) will pay for emergency treatment for any injury or 
adverse condition that appears while you are involved in the study that is not covered by your 
insurance company.  The injury or adverse condition must have occurred as a direct result of 
treatment that was being administered in accordance with the study protocol.  Payment for non-
emergency treatment is not available.  Payment for lost wages, disability or discomfort is not 
available.  You do not give up any of your rights by signing this form. 
 
Cost of Being in the Study 
 
The charges for implanting the DBS system and for the follow up visits required by the study 
protocol will be covered by the study sponsor.  You will not be billed for any of the procedure or 
device costs required by the study.  The sponsor will also cover your expenses for any tests 
performed for study purposes.   
 
You will be compensated for your travel costs and for your time involved in the study.  You will 
receive $50 for each of the eighteen study visits completed and parking vouchers to cover travel-
related expenses.  If you decide to drop out of the study before you have completed the 12-month 
study visit, your payment will be prorated.  You would then be paid for the visits that you 
completed during your time taking part in the study.  MODIFY AS NEEDED TO DETAIL 
HOW PAYMENT WILL BE PROCESSED 
 
Post-study Care 
 
At the end of the 12 month study period or if you exit the study prior to the end of the 12 month 
study period, you will continue to be followed by your study psychiatrist so he/she can program 
your DBS system.  ANS will cover the customary costs associated with these visits up to a 
maximum of 4 programming visits a year and will cover surgical costs and expenses for care 
directly related to the DBS system, such as costs associated with removing or replacing the 
device.  This coverage will continue until the DBS system is approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of major depressive disorder, ANS discontinues this study or the FDA denies approval 
of the DBS system, whichever occurs first.  Once one of the preceding events takes place, you 
will be notified by the study doctor or his/her staff. Post study care is limited to reasonable and 
necessary care and does not include any non-device related care or other psychiatric care such as 
hospitalizations, counseling, psychiatric visits, etc.  Please discuss all plans and questions 
regarding your ongoing care with your study physician.

participate, you are free to stop participating at any time.  If you decided to withdraw, notify your 
study psychiatrist.  This will allow your study psychiatrist to tell you if there are any potential 
medical risks of withdrawal.  If you withdraw from this study your device will be turned off and 
you will have two options.  The first option is to have the DBS system removed.  The second 
option is to enroll in a long-term follow up study.  To be eligible to enroll in the long term follow 
up study, you must have your DBS system implanted for 6 months.  You must also understand 
that your study psychiatrist or Advanced Neuromodulation Systems may stop the project or your 
participation in it at any time.   
 
You will be kept informed of any significant findings throughout this study that may affect your 
willingness to continue to participate.

DISCLAIMER 
 
Our aim is to assist in the assessment and tracking of patients with greater efficiency and accuracy.  Before action is 
taken on any data collected and processed by this program, it should be reviewed and interpreted by a licensed 
clinician. 
 
This program is not designed or intended to be used in the place of a full medical and psychiatric evaluation by a 
qualified licensed physician – psychiatrist.  It is intended only as a tool to facilitate accurate data collection and 
processing of symptoms elicited by trained personnel.

 M.I.N.I. Plus 5.0.0 (January 1, 2005)

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
 
 
The M.I.N.I. was designed as a brief structured interview for the major Axis I psychiatric disorders in DSM-IV and ICD-10.  
Validation and reliability studies have been done comparing the M.I.N.I. to the SCID-P for DSM-III-R and the CIDI (a 
structured interview developed by the World Health Organization for lay interviewers for ICD-10).  The results of these 
studies show that the M.I.N.I. has acceptably high validation and reliability scores, but can be administered in a much shorter 
period of time (mean 18.7 ± 11.6 minutes, median 15 minutes) than the above referenced instruments.  It can be used by 
clinicians, after a brief training session.  Lay interviewers require more extensive training.  The M.I.N.I. Plus is a more 
detailed edition of the M.I.N.I.  Symptoms better accounted for by an organic cause or by the use of alcohol or drugs should 
not be coded positive in the M.I.N.I.  The M.I.N.I. Plus has questions that investigate these issues.   
 
INTERVIEW: 
 
In order to keep the interview as brief as possible, inform the patient that you will conduct a clinical interview that is more 
structured than usual, with very precise questions about psychological problems which require a yes or no answer. 
 
GENERAL FORMAT: 
 
The M.I.N.I. Plus is divided into modules identified by letters, each corresponding to a diagnostic category. 
 
•At the beginning of each diagnostic module (except for psychotic disorders module), screening question(s) corresponding to 
the main criteria of the disorder are presented in a gray box. 
 
•At the end of each module, diagnostic box(es) permit the clinician to indicate whether diagnostic criteria are met. 
 
CONVENTIONS: 
 
Sentences written in « normal font » should be read exactly as written to the patient in order to standardize the assessment of 
diagnostic criteria. 
Sentences written in « CAPITALS » should not be read to the patient.  They are instructions for the interviewer to assist in the 
scoring of the diagnostic algorithms. 
Sentences written in « bold » indicate the time frame being investigated.  The interviewer should read them as often as 
necessary.  Only symptoms occurring during the time frame indicated should be considered in scoring the responses. 
Answers with an arrow above them ( ➨ ) indicate that one of the criteria necessary for the diagnosis(es) is not met. In this 
case, the interviewer should go to the end of the module and circle « NO » in all the diagnostic boxes and move to the next 
module. 
When terms are separated by a slash (/) the interviewer should read only those symptoms known to be present in the patient  
(for example, questions M20-M23). 
Phrases in (parentheses) are clinical examples of the symptom.  These may be read to the patient to clarify the question. 
 
RATING INSTRUCTIONS: 
 
All questions must be rated. The rating is done at the right of each question by circling either Yes or No.  Clinical judgment 
by the rater should be used in coding the responses.  The rater should ask for examples when necessary, to ensure accurate 
coding.  The patient should be encouraged to ask for clarification on any question that is not absolutely clear. 
 
The clinician should be sure that each dimension of the question is taken into account by the patient (for example, time 
frame, frequency, severity, and/or alternatives). 
Symptoms better accounted for by an organic cause or by the use of alcohol or drugs should not be coded positive in the 
M.I.N.I.  The M.I.N.I. Plus has questions that investigate these issues. 
 
For any questions, suggestions, need for a training session, or information about updates of the M.I.N.I., please contact :

STRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE FOR THE  
MONTGOMERY AND ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (SIGMA) 
 
 
Janet B.W. Williams, D.S.W. and Kenneth A. Kobak, Ph.D. 
 
 
 
INTERVIEWER: The questions in bold for each item should be asked exactly as written.  Often these questions 
will elicit enough information about the severity and frequency of a symptom for you to rate the item with 
confidence.  Follow-up questions are provided, however, for use when further exploration or additional 
clarification of symptoms is necessary.  The specified questions should be asked until you have enough 
information to rate the item confidently.  In some cases, you may also have to add your own follow-up 
questions to obtain necessary information.  Note that questions in parentheses are optional, i.e., if information is 
unknown. 
 
NOTES:  
 
Time period.  The ratings should be based on the patient's condition in the past week. 
 
Change from baseline. In general, a symptom is rated as present only when it reflects a change from before the 
depression began.  The interviewer should try to identify a 2-month period of non-depressed functioning and 
use this as a reference point.  In some cases, such as when the patient has Dysthymia, the referent should be to 
the last time they felt OK (i.e., not depressed or high) for at least a few weeks. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This interview guide is based on the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 
(Montgomery SA, Asberg M: A new depression scale designed to be sensitive to change. Brit J Psychiat 
134:382-389, 1979).  The scale itself has been retained in its original form, except for reversing the order of the 
first two items.  This guide adds interview questions to aid in the assessment and application of the MADRS.  
Previous versions of this guide appeared in 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2005.

 SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR 
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types) 
 
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, 
or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent) 
If yes, describe: 
 
 
Has subject engaged in Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior? 
 
Yes      No

Total # of 
Attempts 
 
______ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yes    No 
□   □ 
Interrupted Attempt:   
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred). 
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck 
but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so. 
Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you 
actually did anything? 
If yes, describe: 
 
Yes      No

Total # of 
interrupted 
 
______ 
 
Aborted Attempt:   
When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops themselves before they actually have engaged in any self-destructive behavior. 
Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, except that the individual stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by something else. 
Has there been a time when you started to do something to try to end your life but you stopped yourself before you actually did 
anything? 
If yes, describe: 
 
 
Yes      No

______ 
Preparatory Acts or Behavior: 
Acts or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a verbalization or thought, such as assembling a specific 
method (e.g. buying pills, purchasing a gun) or preparing for one’s death by suicide (e.g. giving things away, writing a suicide note).  
Have you taken any steps towards making a suicide attempt or preparing to kill yourself (such as collecting pills, getting a gun, 
giving valuables away or writing a suicide note)? 
If yes, describe: 
 
 
Yes      No
