Abstract
Of the chronic diseases affecting grade school children, asthma is the most common and accounts 
for the greatest number of school days missed. Moreover, it can influence family dynamics and 
function in other ways and, unfortunately, it may also be associated with mortality, particularly in 
the inner city environments of the United States. Thus, understanding factors that lead to its 
development in early life is essential in developing strategies aimed at primary prevention. Two 
risk factors that have been identified by a number of investigators include first, the development of 
allergic sensitization and second, wheezing respiratory tract illnesses caused by viruses and 
bacteria, either alone or in combination. Both of these factors appear to exert their influences 
within the first few years of life such that asthma becomes established prior to the child entering 
grade school at age 5 to 6 years. Since both allergic sensitization and viral and bacterial illnesses 
can occur in children who do not develop asthma, it is therefore paramount to identify genetic and 
environmental factors that activate, interact, and/or direct the immune system and components of 
the respiratory tract along pathways that allow asthma to become established and expressed 
clinically.

 appear to be the most consistent and reproducible.3 It has been shown that allergic 
sensitization has its greatest impact on recurrent wheezing and asthma when the process 
occurs in the first few years of life4–6 and when it involves the development of sensitization 
to multiple aeroallergens.5, 6 Thus, the strength of its influence appears not to be binary but 
more quantitative and developmental in nature.
Preschool wheezing illnesses with both viral7–9 and bacterial10–12 pathogens are also 
associated with recurrent wheezing and increased asthma risk. Respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) infection historically has been considered to be the most important respiratory 
pathogen in producing these long term lower respiratory sequelae13, and more recent data 
provides additional support for these relationships.14, 15 Furthermore, animal studies provide 
mechanistic evidence by which RSV may cause asthma.16 Treatment trials in preterm 
infants with palivizumab, an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, have demonstrated significant 
reductions in the development of recurrent wheezing.17
With the advent of molecular virology technology during the past few decades, human 
rhinovirus (RV) has been increasingly recognized as a major etiologic factor in preschool 
wheezing illnesses and a highly significant link with the risk of developing childhood 
asthma. Indeed, RV wheezing illnesses are associated with an approximately 10-fold 
increase in asthma risk by six years of age7 and potential mechanisms underlying these 
developments have been described.18 Certain RV species (e.g. A and C > B) may be more 
virulent thereby causing more lower respiratory tract illnesses19–22 and increased morbidity 
resulting in emergency department visits and hospitalization.20, 23 Moreover, the 
development of recurrent lower respiratory tract symptoms following RV-C infections may 
occur more frequently in individuals with demonstrable allergic sensitization.24
Airway bacteria in early life also influence asthma risk. Colonization with common 
respiratory pathogens such as S. Pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenza in early life 
signal an increased risk for recurrent wheeze and early childhood asthma, and these same 
pathogens are associated with acute wheezing illnesses in young children. New tools to 
assess the airway microbiome are shedding additional light on relationships between 
beneficial vs. pathogenic microbes and the risk for acute wheezing and asthma.
This article will expand on the contributions of allergic sensitization and viral and bacterial 
respiratory tract wheezing illnesses on increased risk for both recurrent preschool wheezing 
and childhood asthma. Whenever possible, it will emphasize data generated in long-term 
longitudinal studies that have facilitated etiologic and epidemiologic characterizations.
Viruses, bacteria and the development of asthma
Early life viral infections and childhood asthma
Our understanding of the role of viral infections in wheezing has expanded with the 
development and evolution of molecular viral diagnostics. Results from studies using PCR 
and sequenced based tests indicate that there is a long list of viruses that can cause upper 
respiratory and lower respiratory illnesses (Table 1),8, 25–29 and the clinical manifestations 
of infections with these different viruses are quite similar. Infections can lead to no

 symptoms at all, cold symptoms, or lower respiratory syndromes such as pneumonitis, 
bronchiolitis and acute wheezing illnesses. The risk of asthma seems to be most closely 
associated with the occurrence and frequency of virus-induced wheezing illnesses.7 Other 
clinical manifestations of acute viral illnesses that are associated with increased risk of 
asthma include fever and pneumonitis.4
Nearly all wheezing illnesses in the first few years occur during viral respiratory infections, 
and the viruses most frequently associated with wheezing illnesses are respiratory syncytial 
virus (RSV) and rhinoviruses (RVs).28 Other viruses that are commonly detected during 
wheezing illnesses include metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses and 
bocaviruses. Co-infections with more than one virus are most commonly confirmed in 
infants, and can be associated with more severe symptoms.8, 30 Prolonged illnesses can be 
caused by sequential infections with more than one virus, infections with a virus followed by 
a bacterial pathogen, or less commonly, prolonged infection with a single virus.31 
Adenoviruses are more likely than other respiratory viruses to cause prolonged viral 
shedding.32
RSV
RSV is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus of the family 
Paramyxoviridae, and RSV infections are ubiquitous in infancy.33 RSV has two main 
antigenic groups (A and B). In general, RSV-B infections tend to cause less severe illnesses, 
but virulence varies considerably with individual strains of RSV, even within the antigenic 
groups. Most RSV infections cause mild or asymptomatic illnesses; it is estimated that only 
9% of infections lead to outpatient clinic visits, and 5% or less of infections lead to 
hospitalization.34 Even so, RSV infections are the most common cause of bronchiolitis in 
the first year of life. Risk factors for RSV bronchiolitis include prematurity, comorbid 
conditions affecting the heart, lungs or immune system, and age and season of birth.35 The 
peak age for susceptibility to RSV LRI is at 2–3 months of age, after neutralizing antibody 
acquired transplacentally from the mother has waned. RSV replicates in epithelial cells 
lining the upper airways and bronchioles, and in type I pneumocytes. RSV infections that 
extend into the lower airways can cause airway narrowing and closure by causing epithelial 
cell necrosis and inducing cellular inflammation and mucus hypersecretion.36
There are several lines of evidence to suggest that more severe RSV infections in early life 
may contribute to the risk for developing childhood asthma. First, approximately one third 
of children with RSV bronchiolitis develop recurrent wheezing episodes. In turn, children 
with recurrent wheezing are at increased risk for subsequent asthma, especially if they have 
atopic parents or have other atopic features.37 Further, in a large Tennessee Medicaid 
database, children who were born approximately 120 days before peak RSV season were at 
increased risk for bronchiolitis, and had a corresponding increase in the risk for developing 
asthma by age 3.5–5.5 years.15 Similarly, analysis of RSV bronchiolitis in birth cohort 
studies indicates a positive association with the risk for developing asthma, but not allergic 
sensitization.38, 39 Finally, analysis of the Tucson Children’s Respiratory cohort through 
young adulthood revealed an interaction between RSV LRI in infancy and smoking with

 respect to asthma. Active smoking was a significant risk factor (RR 1.7 [1.2–2.3], p = 0.003) 
for asthma only in young adults who had a history of RSV LRI during infancy.40
Treatment with monoclonal antibodies specific for RSV F protein (palivizumab, 
motivizumab) can reduce the risk of RSV bronchiolitis, and several interventional studies 
have tested whether prevention of RSV bronchiolitis in infancy leads to a reduction in 
recurrent wheezing and asthma. A prospective nonrandomized study of palivizumab 
administration to preterm infants in Canada and Europe reported found an 80% reduction in 
the risk of recurrent wheezing from ages 2–5 years in nonatopic children, but no effect in 
atopic children.41 In a multicenter study conducted in the Netherlands, healthy preterm 
infants born at 33–35 weeks gestation were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial of palivizumab prophylaxis, and were monitored for one year to determine effects on 
recurrent wheeze. Palivizumab treatment led to a 61% relative reduction in total number of 
wheezing days in the first year of life.17 Similarly, a case-control study of palivizumab in 
Japanese infants with mild prematurity demonstrated reduced recurrent wheezing in the 
treated vs. untreated groups (6.4% vs. 18.9%, P < .001).42 The most recent study evaluated 
effects of motivizumab on 2127 healthy full term Navajo infants, an ethnic group at high 
risk for bronchiolitis. In a DBPC randomized trial involving infants aged 6 months or 
younger, motivizumab reduced by 87% the relative risk of hospital admission for 
bronchiolitis.43 However, motivizumab did not reduce subsequent rates of medically 
attended wheezing between ages 1–3 years (14.9% vs. 14.0% in the placebo group).
Thus, passive immunization against RSV certainly reduces acute bronchiolitis in preterm 
infants, and likely reduces the rates of recurrent wheezing for premature infants. Whether 
RSV prophylaxis can reduce recurrent wheezing in term infants is unclear. Additional 
studies are needed to more clearly understand who might benefit from prophylaxis to reduce 
recurrent wheezing, and also whether this approach can prevent atopic asthma. Given that 
children who become polysensitized to allergens in infancy are at greatest risk for persistent 
wheezing and reduced lung function,5, 17, 44 the latter question is of great clinical 
importance.
Rhinoviruses
RVs consist of more than 160 individual types that are classified into three species (A, B, 
and C) based on viral genetics.45 RVs are the pathogens most often associated with upper 
respiratory tract infections (common colds), and can also cause lower respiratory infection 
and wheezing illnesses.23, 46, 47 They are the second most common virus associated with 
bronchiolitis, and are the most common virus detected in association with wheezing illnesses 
in children by the age of 1–2 years.48–50 The species of RV affects virulence, and RV-A and 
RV-C cause more severe illnesses in infants21, 24 and are more likely to cause lower 
respiratory illnesses.20, 23 Cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) was recently 
identified as an entry factor on airway epithelial cells for RV-C.51 Interestingly, a CDHR3 
polymorphism is associated with risk for childhood asthma, and the risk allele is associated 
with more CDHR3 on the surface of cells.52 This finding suggests the possibility that RV-C 
infections in early life could contribute to asthma pathogenesis.

 For years it was mistakenly assumed that RV infections were confined to the upper airway. 
This assumption was based on early findings that RV replicated best at 33–35°C53, and it 
was thought that higher temperatures in the lower airways would preclude lower airway 
infection. However, temperatures in the large and medium conducting airways are cooler 
than core temperature, and are ideal for RV replication.54 Further, some RV types, including 
C-species viruses, replicate equally well at 33°C and 37°C.55, 56 Finally, RV can be detected 
in sputum and bronchial biopsy specimens following experimental inoculation of the upper 
airway,57–59 concurrent with peak symptoms and reductions in peak expiratory flow.60 RVs 
have also been detected in lower airway biopsies from infants with recurrent wheezing.61 
These findings provide strong evidence that RV can infect the lower airways, especially in 
young children.
RV wheezing illnesses in the first 2–3 years of life are closely associated with the risk of 
subsequent asthma. This relationship was first recognized in long-term studies of Finnish 
infants hospitalized for acute wheezing illnesses. RV was the predominant virus detected 
during wheezing illnesses after 5 months of age. When reassessed 5 years later, 60% of 
children who wheezed with RV in the first 2 years of life had asthma.62 Similar findings 
were obtained at subsequent follow-up of these children in adolescence.63 Birth cohort 
studies have provided definitive evidence of a strong relationship between RV wheezing and 
asthma. In the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) study, outpatient RV wheezing 
illnesses during the first year of life were a significant predictor of recurrent wheezing 
through age 3 years.8 Furthermore, viral etiology of wheezing illnesses differentially 
affected the risk for subsequent asthma; the risk of asthma was greater for children who 
wheezed with RV (OR 9.8) or children who wheezed with RV and RSV (OR 10.0) 
compared to children who wheezed only with RSV (OR 2.6).7 Similar findings were 
reported in the Childhood Asthma Study in Perth study; early life infections with RV or 
RSV were associated with an increased risk of asthma, but only in children who had 
developed aeroallergen sensitization by 2 years of age.4 In a study conducted in the 
Netherlands, RV wheezing episodes were positively related to asthma risk. This relationship 
was partially explained by lower lung function in infancy being a risk factor for rhinovirus 
wheezing.64 Finally, in a collaborative study involving two birth cohorts (COAST and 
Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood [COPSAC]), 17q21 genotype 
strongly influenced both the risk of rhinovirus wheezing, and the probability that an infant 
with RV wheezing would go on to develop asthma.65 Thus, there are unresolved questions 
as to whether RV illnesses in childhood promote the development of asthma, reveal the 
presence of preexisting asthma, or both.
Bacteria and wheezing illnesses
The previous sections reviewed information linking viral infection with wheezing illnesses 
and subsequent asthma. Remarkably, the association between airway bacteria and wheezing 
illnesses may be similarly robust,10 and this relationship may begin quite early in life. In a 
Danish birth cohort study, colonization of the nasopharynx with S. pneumonia, M. 
catarrhalis, and H. influenzae at one month of age was associated with increased incidence 
of recurrent wheeze and asthma in early childhood.66

 Viral infections can lead to changes in the composition of the airway microbiome and 
overgrowth of respiratory pathogens, and it is likely that both the virus and secondary 
changes in airway bacteria contribute respiratory symptoms and perhaps airway 
obstruction.11, 67–69 These findings suggest a potential role for antibiotic treatment for 
wheezing illnesses in early life; however, the evidence base for this approach appears to be 
mixed. On one hand, serious bacterial infections accompanying bronchiolitis appear to be 
rare,70 and a recent meta-analysis found that antibiotics such as azithromycin or ampicillin 
were not efficacious for treatment of bronchiolitis.71 On the other hand, Bacharier and 
Guilbert et al conducted a randomized multicenter clinical trial involving 607 preschool 
children with a history of recurrent wheezing illnesses who were then treated with 
azithromycin or placebo at the beginning of respiratory symptoms.72 Azithromycin 
treatment reduced the risk of progression to severe lower respiratory illness (hazard ratio 
0.64 [0.41–0.98], p = 0.04). The mechanism of effect could be related to either antimicrobial 
or anti-inflammatory activities of macrolide antibiotics. Additional studies are needed to 
more clearly identify children most likely to respond to azithromycin therapy, given the 
risks of selecting for antibiotic-resistant organisms, and theoretical risks of disturbing the 
microbiome during infancy.
While bacterial pathogens are positively associated with wheezing and asthma, 
environmental exposure to a broad range of bacteria may protect against wheezing illnesses. 
For example, children exposed to animal sheds on farms are less likely to develop wheezing 
in early life, including transient wheezing of presumed viral origin.73 These beneficial 
effects appear to be related to exposure to diverse environmental microbes. Indeed, animal 
models indicate that gastrointestinal administration of selected bacteria can provide 
protection against signs of illness following challenge with RSV.74 Furthermore, exposures 
in urban environments were related to the risk of recurrent wheeze in the Urban 
Environment and Childhood Asthma (URECA) birth cohort study.75 Dust samples obtained 
during the first year of life were analyzed for both bacteria and allergen content. Infants who 
developed wheezing and atopy by age 3 years were most likely to grow up in homes with 
reduced exposure to both microbes and specific allergens (cat, mouse and cockroach). These 
findings suggest that early life exposures to bacteria and perhaps animal proteins modulate 
immune responses that are important determinants of respiratory illness severity.
Interactions between Allergy and Infections
Allergic sensitization, most notably to perennial aeroallergens, has been defined as a pivotal 
risk factor for the development of asthma.1 It has recently become evident that both the 
timing of allergic sensitization and the quantity of sensitization are important prognostic 
indicators. Simpson and colleagues have identified an atopy phenotype in children they 
termed “multiple early sensitization”. In those children sensitized to multiple aeroallergens 
at an early age, Simpson reported a remarkable increase in risk for asthma inception, severe 
exacerbations leading to hospitalization, and impaired lung function.5 This link between 
early life sensitization to multiple allergens and increased asthma risk has been replicated in 
additional cohort studies.6

 This observed link between early sensitization to aeroallergens and asthma risk is in part due 
to synergy between allergic inflammation and viral infections, most commonly RV. Indeed, 
children in the COAST study who were sensitized to aeroallergens and wheezed with RV 
during the first three years of life had the greatest risk for asthma inception.7 This led to the 
question of whether viral illnesses in early life lead to allergic sensitization or if the converse 
was true. Using a longitudinal multistate Markov model in the COAST study, Jackson et al 
identified a sequential relationship whereby allergic sensitization leads to viral wheezing.2 
This relationship was strongest for RV wheezing, and there was no evidence that viral 
wheezing led to sensitization.
There is also strong evidence to implicate allergic sensitization and exposure as a risk factor 
for wheezing with common cold infections later in childhood. In emergency department 
studies, detection of a respiratory virus, most commonly RV, together with detectable 
allergen-specific IgE and/or the presence of eosinophilic inflammation were all identified as 
risk factors for developing acute wheezing episodes.25, 76, 77 Notably, viral infections and 
allergic inflammation synergistically enhanced the risk of wheezing, and higher levels of 
allergen-specific IgE conferred the greatest risk. This synergism may be particularly notable 
for RV-C, where aeroallergen sensitization was recently reported as a risk factor for 
recurrent severe exacerbations leading to ED visits and hospitalization.24
Mechanisms of Allergy-Virus Interactions
There are multiple mechanisms by which viral infections are thought to interact with allergic 
inflammation in order to lead to lower respiratory airway dysfunction, wheezing and asthma 
exacerbations78. First, underlying allergic inflammation can directly enhance airway 
responsiveness to RV infection.79 Additionally, viral infections can damage the barrier 
function of the airway epithelium, leading to enhanced absorption of aeroallergens across 
the airway wall and enhanced inflammation, while underlying allergic inflammation may 
also lead to enhanced viral replication80, 81. Of interest, both RV infections60 and 
allergens82 can enhance airway epithelial cell production of IL-33, a recently identified 
innate cytokine, which promotes type 2 airway inflammation and remodelling. This steroid 
resistant pathway has been reported to be up-regulated in children with difficult to control 
asthma.82 Interestingly, IL-33 polymorphisms have been linked with intermediate and late 
onset wheezing, which are strongly linked to early life allergic sensitization.83 Another 
innate epithelial cytokine, IL-25, is also induced by RV and is likely to accentuate allergic 
airway inflammation in the context of RV infections in allergic individuals.84
Finally, there is significant evidence that children with allergic asthma have impaired 
antiviral responses.85–87 Indeed, allergen exposure and high-affinity IgE receptor cross-
linking has been shown to impair virus-induced type I and III interferon production in 
peripheral blood cells (Figure 1).88, 89 The result would be both enhanced viral replication 
and also enhanced type 2 inflammation in the airway.90, 91
The most direct evidence to support the importance of allergen-virus interactions in virus-
induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations comes from a recent clinical trial of 
omalizumab (anti-IgE) to prevent seasonal virus-induced asthma exacerbations.92 In this 
trial, virus-induced exacerbations were significantly reduced by omalizumab, and this

 reduction coincided with an enhanced type I interferon response ex vivo in RV stimulated 
mononuclear cells. Of note, those participants who had larger increases in type I interferon 
response with omalizumab treatment had the greatest protection from virus-induced 
exacerbations.
Conclusion
Two key risk factors for the development of childhood asthma are first, the development of 
allergic sensitization in early life and second, wheezing respiratory tract illnesses caused 
primarily by viruses but also by bacteria either alone or as co-infections accompanying 
illnesses of viral etiology. To develop effective strategies for the primary prevention of 
asthma in children, therapies directed at these two risk factors, either alone or in 
combination, appear to be essential components to target.

 What Do We Know?
•
Early life aeroallergen sensitization and viral wheezing illnesses are independent 
and synergistic risk factors for asthma inception.
•
Bacterial pathogens have recently emerged as an additional important 
contributor to asthma risk, either alone or as co-factors with viral infections.
What is Still Unknown?
•
Whether the prevention of allergic sensitization, antiviral strategies, 
immunostimulants, or other strategies that augment immune responses to airway 
pathogens will prevent the development of asthma.

Interplay between high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) and antiviral responses. In normal 
airways, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are major sources of type I and type III interferons in 
response to viral infections. These cells also have low-level expression of the FcεRI. In the 
context of allergy, pDCs express greater amounts of FcεRI, which is inversely related to 
interferon responses. In addition, cross-linking of FcεRI further reduces interferon 
responses. Consequences of suppressed interferon responses to viral infection could include
