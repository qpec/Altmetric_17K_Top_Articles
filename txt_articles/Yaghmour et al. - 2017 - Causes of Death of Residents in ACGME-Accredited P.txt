Research Report
In 2014, the suicide-related deaths 
of two internal medicine interns in 
New York1 shocked the public and the 
profession, and refocused attention on 
physician suicide, a concern for several 
decades. A study by Center et al2 found 
that an estimated 300 to 400 practicing 
physicians died by suicide each year, 
and another by Shanafelt et al3 showed 
that 1 in 16 surgeons reported suicidal 
ideation. Studies also show that 
medical residents are at higher risk for 
depressive disorders, depressed mood, 
burnout, and suicidal ideation than are 
their peers in the general population.4–6 
However, the causes of death for 
physicians in training have not been 
systematically studied.
The Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) 
accredits more than 9,900 residency 
and fellowship programs across the 
United States7 and oversees the training 
of approximately 125,000 residents 
annually.7 Each preventable resident 
death, in addition to being a tragedy 
for colleagues, faculty, and patients, 
represents a real loss to patients and 
society, given the estimated 30,000-hour 
contribution of a physician over the 
course of a full career.
Our study sought to better understand 
the rates and causes of death for 
residents, and compare them with rates 
in the general population. In particular, 
we were interested in the number and 
leading causes of resident deaths; their 
patterns and trends in occurrence; 
and associations with gender, year in 
training, program accreditation status, 
and whether any patterns could offer 
information to reduce avoidable deaths.
Method
The ACGME maintains information 
about U.S. accredited graduate medical 
education programs, including the 
number of residents enrolled in a 
given program for each academic 
year.7 Programs annually update their 
information using the Accreditation Data 
System (ADS). Data about new residents 
are entered, residents continuing in the 
program are confirmed, and residents 
who have graduated or left the program 
are identified. For each resident no longer 
in the program, the reason is selected 
from a list that includes indicating the 
resident is deceased.
Our study used data aggregated by the 
National Death Index (NDI), a division 
of the National Center for Health 
Statistics. The American Institute for 
Research Review Board reviewed our 
study protocol and issued an exempt 
designation following an expedited 
review. We queried the NDI, in 
compliance with published guidelines,8 to 
provide the cause of death for residents 
reported as deceased. NDI staff matched 
resident information with cause of death 
data from their database, and provided 
ICD-10-coded causes of death.
Abstract
Purpose
To systematically study the number of 
U.S. resident deaths from all causes, 
including suicide.
Method
The more than 9,900 programs accredited 
by the Accreditation Council for Graduate 
Medical Education (ACGME) annually 
report the status of residents. The authors 
aggregated ACGME data on 381,614 
residents in training during years 2000 
through 2014. Names of residents reported 
as deceased were submitted to the National 
Death Index to learn causes of death. 
Person-year calculations were used to 
establish resident death rates and compare 
them with those in the general population.
Results
Between 2000 and 2014, 324 individuals 
(220 men, 104 women) died while in 
residency. The leading cause of death was 
neoplastic disease, followed by suicide, 
accidents, and other diseases. For male 
residents the leading cause was suicide, 
and for female residents, malignancies. 
Resident death rates were lower than in 
the age- and gender-matched general 
population. Temporal patterns showed 
higher rates of death early in residency. 
Deaths by suicide were higher early in 
training, and during the first and third 
quarters of the academic year. There was 
no upward or downward trend in resident 
deaths over the 15 years of this study.
Conclusions
Neoplastic disease and suicide were the 
leading causes of death in residents. 
Data for death by suicide suggest added 
risk early in residency and during certain 
months of the academic year. Providing 
trainees with a supportive environment 
and with medical and mental health 
services is integral to reducing 
preventable deaths and fostering a 
healthy physician workforce.

We matched the cause of death 
information from the NDI with 
demographic data from the ADS database 
to determine cause-of-death differences 
by gender, specialty, level of training, and 
academic year. Cross-tab comparisons 
and odds ratio (OR) calculations were 
performed with SAS Enterprise Guide, 
Version 7.1 (SAS, Cary, North Carolina).
We calculated estimated person-years by 
summing the number of persons (in this 
case, residents) for each academic year 
whose data we studied. For example, in 
academic year 2007–2008, there were 
107,851 residents in ACGME programs; 
thus, there were 107,851 person-years in 
2007–2008. To create the study window 
of 15 years, 2000 through 2014, we used 
half the total number of person-years for 
academic years 1999–2000 and 2014–
2015. Because ADS annual reporting was 
not fully operational during 1999–2000 
and 2000–2001, we used data from the 
American Medical Association Graduate 
Medical Education Census published 
in the JAMA medical education theme 
issues of 20009 and 2001.10 We calculated 
person-years for men and for women 
for each individual year of training that 
we studied. This enabled comparisons 
of resident rates of death per 100,000 
person-years to age- and gender-matched 
U.S. cohorts, reported for the overall 
cohort, and by gender and year of training 
for the 15-year period of analysis.
Lastly, we examined whether there were 
differences in accreditation status and/
or other accreditation parameters for 
programs with one or more resident 
suicides, those with one or more resident 
deaths due to other causes, and programs 
overall, on the hypothesis that resident 
stress may be higher in programs that are 
not well managed.
Results
From 2000 through 2014, 381,614 
individual physicians were enrolled in 
ACGME-accredited residency programs 
and participated in 1,622,939 collective 
person-years of training (918,654 years 
for men, 704,285 years for women). 
Over the same period, 324 residents were 
reported as having died while enrolled in 
ACGME-accredited programs.
Through the NDI and other public 
sources, the cause of death was identified 
for 311 individuals (96%). Of the 324 
deceased trainees, 305 (94%) were 
accurately matched to the cause of 
death using NDI data, and for another 
6 trainees (2%), the cause of death was 
determined from obituaries or local 
news articles. The cause of death of the 
remaining 13 could not be precisely 
identified and was categorized as “ill-
defined or of undetermined intent.”
For the study period, the general category 
representing the highest number of 
deaths among residents (80; 42 men, 38 
women) was neoplastic diseases, with 
central nervous system (15; 7 men, 8 
women) and breast cancer (12 women, 
no men) the most prevalent causes (see 
Table 1). The second-most-prevalent 
cause of resident death was suicide (66; 
51 men, 15 women), with 16 residents 
dying using firearms, and 16 intentionally 
overdosing on drugs or other substances. 
Suicide by leaping from heights or by 
asphyxia by hanging, strangulation, or 
inhalation accounted for 18 deaths, and 
16 residents died by suicide by other 
means or by unspecified means.
Fifty-one residents died from being 
involved in accidents (34 men, 17 
women). Among these deaths, 33 (20 
men, 13 women) were classified as 
motor vehicle accidents, and 5 (4 men, 
1 woman) were classified as pedestrian 
or bicycle accidents. Another 51 
residents succumbed to medical and 
surgical diseases. Among these deaths, 
30 (22 men, 8 women) resulted from 
cardiovascular disease, and 8 (5 men, 3 
women) were from infectious diseases.
Twenty-two residents (19 men, 3 
women), including 12 anesthesiology 
residents, died by accidental poisoning. 
The deaths of an additional 11 residents 
(9 men, 2 women) occurred under 
circumstances of unclear intent (5 of 
these deaths by falls and 6 by poisoning), 
and 7 residents (4 men, 3 women) were 
victims of homicide. For 28 residents 
(22 men, 6 women)—including 13 
residents that could not be matched to 
NDI or public data, and 15 with NDI 
records—the cause of death was classified 
as ill-defined or undetermined intent.
Between 2000 and 2014, the reported 
and published overall death rate for 
25- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. general 
population was 105.4 per 100,000 
population (145.3 men, 65.0 women).11 
Over the 15 years of this study, the death 
rate of male residents ages 25–34 years 
was much lower at 20.08 per 100,000 (OR 
0.14, confidence interval [CI] 0.11–0.16), 
and for female residents ages 25–34 
it was 12.97 per 100,000 (OR 0.20, CI 
0.15–0.24), for an aggregate death rate for 
residents ages 25–34 of 16.91 (OR 0.16, 
CI 0.14–0.18). The specific frequencies 
and rates of causes of death are shown 
in Table 1, and comparisons with the 
gender- and age-matched parameters 
of the U.S. population are provided in 
Table 2.
Suicide is the leading cause of death in 
male residents, and the second-most-
prevalent for female residents (see 
Table 1). An important finding is that 
the majority of suicides (49 of 66; 74%) 
occurred in years 1 and 2 of training (see 
Figure 1). In addition, the months of 
July–September and January–March (the 
first and third quarters of each academic 
year) contain 42 of the 66 (64%) resident 
suicides, with the first quarter containing 
23 (almost 35%).
Whereas residents as a group were less 
likely to die by suicide than the members 
of the general population as a group (see 
Table 2), residents in the age cohorts 35–
44 and 45–54 had higher rates of suicide 
than did those in the 25–34 cohort, and 
the 95% CIs of the ORs for these groups 
exceed the rate of the general population. 
Gender-related trends are present as well. 
The suicide rate for male residents of 
5.55 is 2.61 times higher than the rate for 
female residents of 2.13. However, the 
male resident OR for deaths by suicide 
in comparison with males in the general 
population aged 25–34 is 0.24, while the 
female resident to population aged 25–34 
is 0.38, nearly 50% greater than that for 
males.11
Table 3 shows patterns in death by year 
for training for pipeline specialties (i.e., 
specialties entered directly after medical 
school that lead to primary board 
certification; nonpipeline specialties 
are those in fellowship programs 
entered after completion of a pipeline 
specialty program). Other than the 
data for suicide, there are no patterns 
that provide actionable information to 
reduce preventable deaths. For neoplastic 
disease, which was the most common 
cause of death during the study period, a 
 Research Report

978
higher number of deaths occurred in the 
first year of training, yet the calculated 
rates do not suggest any significant 
differences across years of training. 
Information for the 46 physicians in 
nonpipeline specialties shows “other 
medical and surgical diseases” as the 
most common cause of death (12), 
followed by suicide (10) and neoplastic 
disease (9); these data are not shown in 
Table 3.
Residents who died during the time 
period we studied were training in 49 
specialties or subspecialties. During the 
same time period, deaths of graduates 
from Canadian medical schools (3; 0.9%), 
international medical schools (88; 27%), 
U.S. MD-granting medical schools (201; 
62%), and DO-granting medical schools 
(25; 7.7%) approximate the proportions 
of matriculated residents in ACGME-
accredited programs.12
Analysis of the relationship between 
the accreditation status of programs 
and resident deaths showed that at the 
time of the resident deaths, there were 
no significant differences between the 
accreditation status of programs with 
resident deaths and those without them 
(chi-square = 3.3087, P = .3464). Review 
of the resident surveys from the programs 
with resident suicides compared with 
programs with resident deaths from other 
causes revealed no differences in duty 
hours compliance, institutional or faculty 
resources, or resident satisfaction with 
their program (data not shown in the 
table).
Resident deaths per year varied from 
a minimum of 13 in 2000–2001 to a 
maximum of 31 in 2007–2008 (mean 
22.36, mode 18, SD 4.78; detailed data 
not shown in the table). There was 
no trend (increasing or decreasing) 
in total deaths, or deaths from any 
common causes for the 15 academic 
years in this analysis, which include the 
implementation of common work hours 
standards in 2003 and 2011.
Discussion
We are aware of only two prior national, 
multispecialty reports of resident 
mortality, with both using a more limited 
sample and finding low rates of death.13,14 
Both studies used surveys of program 
directors, which may have resulted in 
underreporting. In this comprehensive 
study of nearly 400,000 resident 
physicians, covering over 1.6 million 
person-years over 15 years, we observed 
324 deaths. This corresponds to an overall 
death rate of 19.96 per 100,000 person-
years (23.95 men; 14.77 women), and 
a death rate from suicide for residents 
of 4.07 per 100,000 person-years (5.56

of the data limits our ability to make 
further evidence-based recommendations 
to reduce preventable deaths from many 
common causes. For example, data for 
resident deaths in motor vehicle accidents 
would be of interest, given concerns 
about resident fatigue and increased 
risk for accidents.15 The favorable 
comparisons with the age- and gender-
matched population (2.39 vs. 6.33 per 
100,000 person-years for female residents, 
and 3.33 vs. 17.26 per 100,000 person-
years for male residents; see Table 2) offer 
reassurance that residents die in motor 
vehicle accidents at rates lower than the 
general population. At the same time, 
the data lack information on the timing 
and context of accidents, which makes 
it impossible to assess whether any of 
these deaths resulted from potentially 
preventable causes.
Our data indicate that neoplastic disease 
is the most prevalent cause of death of 
residents, and the leading cause of death 
in female residents. Although residents 
are less likely to die of malignancy than 
their age- and gender-matched cohorts, 
resident deaths from malignancy occur 
throughout training, suggesting that 
some residents matriculate into graduate 
training with potentially undiagnosed 
disease, and others develop the disease 
while in training. This suggests that 
supporting resident self-care, including 
opportunities for preventive health care, 
is essential, if programs and sponsoring 
institutions are to minimize preventable 
deaths from malignancy. As noted 
by Legha16 in a history of physician 
suicide—yet applicable to other causes 
of resident deaths—if a member of a 
health profession can become ill and 
not seek or receive care, “despite being 
surrounded by other caregivers, [that] 
begs for a thoughtful assessment to 
determine why it happens at all.” There 
are few studies of resident access and 
use of health care services. One study 
from 2000 found barriers to resident 
use of health services, due to residents’ 
long hours and multiple competing 
obligations.17

The finding of lower rates of resident 
death by suicide compared with the age- 
and gender-matched population was 
surprising, given the data on higher rates 
of depression in medical students than 
in the age-matched general population,18 
and the higher rates of suicide deaths 
in practicing physicians compared with 
the rates in the general population. The 
exceptions to this are residents in age 
cohorts 35–44 and 45–54, for which the 
95% CIs of the ORs exceeded the rate 
of the general population. Despite the 
lower rate, of all major causes of death 
during residency, only death by suicide 
showed potentially actionable patterns. 
The higher rates of suicide for residents 
early in their training are consistent with 
data from a prospective study of 740

interns at 13 institutions, finding that 
suicidal ideation increased 370% over 
the first three months of the first year of 
training.19 Higher rates early in training, 
and during the first and third quarters 
of the academic year, are consistent 
with the hypothesis that the stresses of 
the transition from medical school to 
residency, and from intern to resident, 
are significant and may contribute to 
risk in susceptible individuals. Similarly, 
postholiday midwinter, midyear 
academic, and seasonal factors may 
have particularly severe effects on some 
residents, possibly leading to depression, 
isolation, and even suicide. It is possible 
that some suicide deaths were attributed 
to other causes, due to pressure from, for 
example, decedents’ families, colleagues, 
or faculty. If some of the accidental 
deaths, some of the surprisingly high rate 
of poisonings, and some of the deaths 
with ill-defined causes or undetermined 
intent were misclassified suicides, the 
number would be higher than the 66 
declared suicides.
Our findings present the education 
community with an opportunity to 
reduce unnecessary deaths by increasing 
preventive strategies, scheduling 
preemptive education, and fostering 
access to counseling and confidential 
mental health services for residents. In 
addition, all of those who are engaged in 
the clinical learning environment—both 
faculty and residents themselves—need 
to watch for signs of resident burnout, 
depression, social isolation, or significant 
changes in performance.
Practical interventions to enhance well-
being are beginning to result from efforts 
by the ACGME and the graduate medical 
education community to aggregate 
relevant resources, including an enhanced 
focus on resident well-being through a 
range of ACGME activities.20 That such 
programs can be created and used by 
residents and faculty, and show positive 
impact, has been demonstrated for the 
past decade by the experience at Oregon 
Health and Science University,21 and a 
controlled trial that showed that cognitive 
behavior therapy significantly reduced 
suicidal ideation.22
At the same time, supporting trainee 
well-being and help-seeking behaviors 
will not eliminate resident deaths by 
suicide, as rates are already low, and, 
often, there is a lack of any advance 
warning.23 Future studies should 
explore institution- and program-level 
approaches to increase and support help-
seeking behaviors by trainees in distress, 
through a supportive community, and 
engagement of faculty, peers, and family 
and social networks.
In contrast to physicians in training, 
practicing physicians die by suicide at 
rates greater than those for age- and 
gender-matched professional and general 
populations,24–26 and the prevalence of 
physician burnout and depression appears 
to be increasing in practicing physicians27 
and in residents.16 A systematic review4 
found a rate of 29% of depression and/
or depressive symptoms across studies, 
ranging from 21% to 43%, with higher rates 
in more recent studies. The link between 
burnout and suicidal ideation is complex, 
yet there is a link. A study showed that 
27% of medical students who met criteria 
for burnout during their undergraduate 
medical education recovered, and that 
individuals who recovered reported 
markedly less suicidal ideation, suggesting 
lower risk for burnout.28
The well-being of physicians is important 
to patients, the profession, the public, 
and the physicians themselves.29,30 
Disturbances in their well-being can have 
serious consequences for their patients 
and loved ones, while disturbances in 
the well-being of a sizable portion of 
the physician workforce may have a 
detrimental effect on the profession’s 
commitment to serving society.24 Efforts 
to enhance physician well-being must 
begin during the medical education years, 
and strategic interventions to initiate 
habits of self-care and improve use of 
mental and physical health care should 
target residents and faculty.21,31 Inclusion 
of the latter group is important for 
their well-being, and to promote these 
behaviors on the part of those who serve 
as role models for residents. Improved 
physician well-being will benefit patients, 
as a meta-analysis has found positive 
associations of occupational well-
being and patient satisfaction, patient 
adherence to treatment, and interpersonal 
aspects of care.28
Limitations and strengths
There are limitations to this study. First, 
despite the magnitude of the cohort, it 
does not represent all residents in the 
United States. The American Osteopathic 
Association accredits osteopathic 
programs, and a number of surgical 
fellowship programs are accredited by 
specialty societies or other entities. Also, 
our study did not assess the prevalence of 
suicide after dismissal from, or completion 
of, residency. Finally, the limited number 
of deaths from specific causes, including 
suicide deaths, and absence of individual 
resident data beyond demographic 
information, precluded the use of 
regression analysis to provide a more 
sophisticated assessment of risk factors. 
Strengths of this study include that it is the 
most complete study of causes of resident 
death to date, covering 15 academic years 
of ACGME-accredited programs and 
involving nearly 400,000 physicians in 
training, with the causes of death obtained 
through the NDI database or other public 
sources of information.
Conclusions
Resident death occurs significantly 
less frequently than in the age- and 
gender-matched general population. 
Malignancy is the most common cause, 
with suicide the second-most prevalent 
etiology and the most preventable cause 
of death of trainees. The data suggest a 
higher risk for individuals early in their 
training and during vulnerable periods 
in the first quarter of the academic year 
and after the winter holiday season. 
Strategies to reduce preventable deaths 
should include preventive and treatment 
services, emergency support for trainees 
in distress, and ongoing monitoring and 
provision of wellness services that take 
into account the level of training, age of 
the trainee, and the time of year. Future 
research should explore institution- and 
program-level approaches to increase 
and support help-seeking behaviors by 
trainees in distress.
