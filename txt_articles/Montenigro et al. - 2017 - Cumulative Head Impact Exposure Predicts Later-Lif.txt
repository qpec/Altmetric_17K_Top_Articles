Abstract
The term ‘‘repetitive head impacts’’ (RHI) refers to the cumulative exposure to concussive and subconcussive events.
Although RHI are believed to increase risk for later-life neurological consequences (including chronic traumatic en-
cephalopathy), quantitative analysis of this relationship has not yet been examined because of the lack of validated tools to
quantify lifetime RHI exposure. The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop a metric to quantify cumulative RHI
exposure from football, which we term the ‘‘cumulative head impact index’’ (CHII); 2) to use the CHII to examine the
association between RHI exposure and long-term clinical outcomes; and 3) to evaluate its predictive properties relative to
other exposure metrics (i.e., duration of play, age of first exposure, concussion history). Participants included 93 former
high school and collegiate football players who completed objective cognitive and self-reported behavioral/mood tests as
part of a larger ongoing longitudinal study. Using established cutoff scores, we transformed continuous outcomes into
dichotomous variables (normal vs. impaired). The CHII was computed for each participant and derived from a combi-
nation of self-reported athletic history (i.e., number of seasons, position[s], levels played), and impact frequencies reported
in helmet accelerometer studies. A bivariate probit, instrumental variable model revealed a threshold dose-response
relationship between the CHII and risk for later-life cognitive impairment ( p < 0.0001), self-reported executive dys-
function ( p < 0.0001), depression ( p < 0.0001), apathy ( p = 0.0161), and behavioral dysregulation ( p < 0.0001). Ulti-
mately, the CHII demonstrated greater predictive validity than other individual exposure metrics.

Introduction
T
he term ‘‘repetitive head impacts’’ (RHI) refers to the
cumulative exposure to recurrent concussive and sub-
concussive events.1–6 A concussive event is a direct or indirect
impact to the head of sufficient intensity to produce overt clinical
symptoms that typically resolve within days or weeks,5 but can
persist for months7 or ‡1 year.8 The mechanisms of concussion are
believed to involve shearing and tensile forces to axons that occur
during the impact-induced acceleration, deceleration, and rota-
tional forces of the brain.9 A subconcussive event is similar in that it
also involves a transfer of mechanical energy to the brain at enough
force to injure axonal integrity, but does not result in clinical
symptoms.1–4,10,11 However, the intensity of impact necessary to
trigger this potential neuronal damage is not known, and whether
there are levels of impact that are benign to neuronal functioning
has also not been determined.
The investigation of RHI has most commonly been in contact
sports, such as American football. More than 4,500,000 amateur
athletes participate in tackle football each year,12,13 and this sport

 has one of the highest rates of concussion.14,15 Surveys of high
school and college athletes show that *50% of football players
sustain a concussion each year, and >30% sustain multiple con-
cussions.14,16,17 Subconcussive events are likely even more fre-
quent, as helmet-based accelerometer studies estimate that amateur
football players average 600 subconcussive impacts per season in
high school and >1000 at the collegiate level.3 The high prevalence
of concussive and subconcussive events in amateur football players
is concerning, given their reported association with acute18–20 and
chronic21–25 neurological consequences. Repetitive subconcussive
blows (measured by helmet accelerometer sensors recording events
that exceed 14.4g10) are associated with pre- to post-season cog-
nitive decline,10,26 functional brain alterations (e.g., reduced neu-
rophysiological health),10,26,27 and microstructural white matter
brain changes28 in high school football players.
Although research on this topic still is limited, cumulative
concussive as well as subconcussive impacts may be a key con-
tributor to later-life neurological consequences, including the
neurodegenerative disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE).29 Importantly, 16% of pathologically confirmed cases of
CTE have no reported history of concussion,30 highlighting the
potential long-term risks of subconcussive injury. In addition, al-
though CTE has been described predominantly in former profes-
sional contact sport athletes, a recent study of deceased amateur
athletes and controls found that a history of contact sport in-
volvement was the greatest risk factor for CTE neuropathology.31
Various exposure metrics (e.g., age of first exposure to football,32–34
duration of football play,11,35–37 concussion history21–25) have been
linked to later-life cognitive and neurobehavioral disturbances in
former football players and other contact sport athletes. These dif-
ferent metrics may reflect different aspects of RHI exposure, each
with slightly different effects on the brain.11,35
A direct relationship between RHI and long-term clinical out-
comes has been difficult to formally test because of the lack of
validated tools to quantify cumulative RHI exposure.38 Quantifying
RHI exposure is methodologically challenging, given that it in-
volves a self-reported assessment of multiple events that occur
throughout one’s athletic career. Thus far, research on RHI and
long-term outcomes has relied on single, indirect metrics based on a
subject’s history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), which involves
retrospective self-reports or proxy reports using a structured in-
terview containing validated scales.39–41 These scales include those
recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke (NINDS) common data elements and the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC).42 Despite known limitations, numerous
studies have demonstrated the usefulness of retrospective report in
predicting long-term consequences following multiple concus-
sions.21,22,43 Although short-term head impact exposure could be
quantified prospectively with the placement of accelerometers in
the helmets of athletes, this approach does not estimate cumulative
exposure over one’s athletic career, which is speculated to be of
primary importance for predicting later-life impairments and
CTE.44,45 In response to this need, Kerr and coworkers recently
proposed the Head Impact Exposure Estimate (HIEE),46 which
estimates a football player’s total hours of contact exposure, ex-
cluding exposure prior to high school, using self-report interview.
However, the HIEE has not been validated in a model with clinical
outcomes.
In our study, we developed and validated a metric to estimate an
athlete’s total cumulative exposure to RHI from football, referred
to as the ‘‘cumulative head impact index’’ (CHII). To derive the
CHII we combined two sources of information: 1) individual self-
report measures of athletic exposure, and 2) extrapolated objective
measures based on position(s) played, obtained from published
helmet accelerometer studies. Our metric includes estimates for
youth, high school, and collegiate level exposure, and incorporates
percentages for all positions played (i.e., primary, secondary, ter-
tiary). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship
between the CHII and later-life cognitive, behavioral, and mood
impairment. Additionally, we compared the predictive validity of
the CHII against three other individual exposure metrics; namely,
total season/years played, age at first exposure (AFE), and overall
concussion history.21–23,25,32,33,43,47 We hypothesized that cumu-
lative head impact exposure would have a measurable threshold,
above which the risk of developing later life clinically meaningful
cognitive, mood, and behavioral impairment increases signifi-
cantly.
Methods
Study design
This present sample was part of a larger ongoing study, the
Longitudinal Examination to Gather Evidence of Neurodegenerative
Disease (LEGEND) study, at the Boston University Alzheimer’s
Disease and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center.
LEGEND is a longitudinal study to assess potential risk factors for
short- and long-term consequences of RHI. Participation involves
annual telephone-based cognitive assessments; web-based mea-
sures of mood, behavior, and cognition; and saliva sampling for
APOE genotyping. The LEGEND research protocol was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Boston University Medical
Campus and written consent was obtained from all LEGEND
participants. Study participation was open to adults, ‡18 years of
age, who were either active or former athletes, across all sports and
levels of play. There is no active recruitment program for LE-
GEND. Rather, this is a convenience sample in which potential
subjects learn of the study through descriptions on the investiga-
tors’ web sites and through word of mouth. Therefore, the LE-
GEND sample should not be viewed as being representative of all
athletes. Detailed descriptions of the LEGEND protocol have been
previously published.25,47,48
Participants
Of the 800 participants in the LEGEND data set at the time of
analysis, 93 former amateur football players met the following
inclusion and exclusion criteria: 1) highest level of football played
was at high school or college, 2) no concussion was sustained in the
year prior to their initial evaluation (to diminish potential effect of
acute brain injuries on clinical outcome measures), and 3) they did
not participate in another contact sport (i.e., amateur wrestling,
boxing, bull riding, diving, horse jumping, ice hockey, karate, la-
crosse, martial arts, mixed martial arts, entertainment wrestling,
rugby, or soccer). The final sample included 17 former high school
football players and 76 former collegiate football players. Demo-
graphic characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1.
Health and athletic history
Participants were administered a structured questionnaire that
has been used previously,25,32,47 designed to collect retrospective
information about the participant’s lifetime athletic experience,
past medical history, and concussion history. Questions about
athletic experience captured variables regarded by the literature as
being potential predictors of brain trauma, such as: 1) sports
played,11,49 2) AFE to tackle football,32–34 3) levels of play50–53
(youth, high school, college, professional), 4) number of seasons
played at each level,27,28,54 5) total years played,23,35–37 6) all

 positions55–58 played for each sport (first, second, third) at each
level, 7) percentage of game time played at each position,46,58 and
8) age at retirement from the sport.36
The self-reported number of concussions was obtained, after
participants were read a ‘‘modern’’ definition of concussion, based
on the CDC statement on sports-related concussion59 and the Third
International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Zurich.60
The concussion history characteristics of the sample are provided in
Table 2. Because the distribution of self-reported concussions is
highly skewed, we used the log of concussions in all subsequent
analyses to normalize the distribution. Participants were also asked
to report their AFE to tackle football and the total number of sea-
sons they played (i.e., duration of football play) (Table 2). For our
analysis, participant’s AFE was converted into a dichotomous
variable: AFE before age 12 and AFE at age 12 or above. Age 12
was selected as the cutoff, based on our previous work on AFE, as
an exposure metric associated with later-life clinical and structural
changes.32,33 For duration of play, we used seasons rather than
years because for some athletes, a year of football involved both a
fall and spring season.
CHII
The CHII was developed as an estimate of an athlete’s total
cumulative exposure to RHI from football. To derive an indi-
vidual’s CHII we combined data from two sources of infor-
mation: 1) individual self-report measures of athletic exposure
obtained from the LEGEND questionnaire at each level played
(youth, high school, college), such as number of seasons played,
positions played at each level (primary, secondary, tertiary),
and the proportion of the season’s total game time played at
each position; and 2) a measure of estimated head impacts re-
ceived per season, based on data from published helmet ac-
celerometer studies that report the frequency of head impacts
per season by position and level of play (See following section
and Table 3).55–57,61,62
Published accelerometer studies used to determine
frequency of head impacts by position and level of play
To obtain estimates of the frequency of head impacts by position
and level of play, we performed a systematic review of the literature
(using PubMed) on helmet accelerometer studies, using the fol-
lowing key words/search terms: HITS system, 6DOF, accelerom-
eters, helmet-sensor, football, youth, high school, and college.
Studies that satisfied the following a priori inclusion criteria were
selected.
1. Head Impacts were measured during every practice and
game for the entire season.
2. Level of play (youth, high school, college) was identified.
3. Head impact frequencies were reported for positions of play.
4. Any impact event with a peak linear acceleration <10g was
excluded from analysis. A minimum cutoff of 10g ensures
the elimination of nonimpact events (e.g., jumping) from the
calculation of head impact frequency.37, 56,63–66
Table 3 provides a summary of key data points obtained from
each accelerometer study that met our inclusion criteria. The par-
ticipants in the studies summarized in Table 3 were active in both

 games and practices. Because most players at the youth level play at
multiple positions, we include a single number to reflect exposure
for all seasons each player spent at the youth level. There was a
single high school study identified that grouped together certain
positions, such as linesmen, regardless of whether or not they
played at offensive or defensive positions. Because many players at
the high school level would interchangeably play at both offense
and defense, using a similar exposure metric for these positions is a
realistic assumption.61 Impact frequencies from these studies were
pooled and weighted, whenever possible, to derive averages
weighted by each study’s sample size. These weighted averages are
estimates of the impact frequencies per position at the different
levels of play (youth, high school, college).
The CHII was calculated from the self-report variables and
weighted impact frequencies using the equations outlined in Ta-
ble 4. A hypothetical case is provided to illustrate the calculation of
the CHII.
Mr. A is a 42-year-old male who reports having participated in
football at the youth, high school, and collegiate levels.
1. In college, Mr. A reported that he had played a total of three
seasons. His primary position for his college team was
linebacker (LB); he reported having no secondary or tertiary
positions of play. He estimated having participated in 85%
of game downs as a linebacker. Therefore, his college CHII
was: (85%)·(685 impacts per season for LB from Table 5) ·
(3 seasons)=1747.
2. In high school, Mr. A reported that he had played for all four
seasons. His primary position for his high school team was
also LB; he reported having a secondary position playing the
offensive line (OL) as a guard. Of all the games in high
school, he estimated having participated in 40% of game
downs as a LB and 30% as OL. Therefore, his high school
CHII was: [(40%) · (619 impacts per season for LB) · (4
seasons)] + [(30%) · (868 impacts per season for OL) · (4
seasons)] = 2032.
3. Lastly, Mr. A reported that he had played four seasons of
football prior to high school. He reported having played as
an OL throughout his youth participation. He estimated that
he participated in 90% of game downs for all 4 seasons.
Therefore, his youth CHII was: [(90%) · (107 impacts per
season for any position) · (4 seasons)] = 385.
4. His overall CHII = 1747 + 2032 + 385 = 4164.
Clinical outcomes and measures
The following set of instruments administered to LEGEND
participants were selected for the current study: 1) Brief Test of
Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT)67; 2) Behavior Rating
Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A)68; 3)
Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D)69;
and 4) Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES).70 Each of these measures
was chosen a priori based on its previous use in studies of TBI and
concussion (BRIEF-A,25,71,72 AES,73–75 CES-D,76–78 BTACT79),
and on the availability of validated cutoff scores suggesting clini-
cally meaningful impairment.68,73,80–82

 validity of cognitive test batteries administered by telephone
are well documented.79,83 The BTACT requires 20 min to
complete and consists of six subtests that measure episodic
verbal memory (Immediate and Delayed Rey Auditory-Verbal
Learning Test), working memory (Digits Backward), verbal
fluency (Animals Categorical Fluency), task switching (Red/
Green Test), inductive reasoning (Number Series), and pro-
cessing speed (Backward Counting).67 A global composite
score was derived with the bi-factor approach, which has an
overall improved validity over the single-factor approach and is
better able to distinguish among persons with a lifetime history
of head injury.79 Age- and gender-corrected scores were scaled
relative to a healthy normative sample. Objective cognitive
impairment was defined as 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below
the normative mean.82,84
BRIEF-A.
Participants completed an online version of the
BRIEF-A questionnaire,68 a well-validated 75 item measurement
of executive function behavior in activities of daily living. Parti-
cipants rate ‘‘how often each of the [75] following behaviors has
been a problem?’’ in the past month on a three point Likert scale
(1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often); higher scores indicate a
greater degree of dysfunction. We used the global measure of ex-
ecutive function (Global Executive Composite [GEC]), as well as
two factor-based measures of cognitive regulation (Meta-cognition
Index [MI]) and behavioral-emotional regulation (Behavioral
Regulation Index [BRI]). Raw scores were converted into stan-
dardized age-adjusted T scores (mean = 50, SD = 10). T-scores
‡1.5 SDs of the normative mean (T scores ‡65) are considered to
indicate clinical impairment.68
CES-D.
The CES-D69 is a 20 item self-report measure of
depression symptoms that was developed and validated by the
National Institute of Mental Health.69 Participants rate their de-
pression symptom severity in the past week on a four point Likert
scale that ranges from ‘‘none of the time’’ to ‘‘all of the time.’’
Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms, with an
established total CES-D cutoff score ‡16 reliably indicating clini-
cally meaningful depression.80,81

Statistical analysis
Group comparisons.
The former high school and collegiate
football player groups were compared using two sample t tests for
continuous normal variables, Wilcoxon two sample tests for non-
normal continuous variables, and v2 tests for categorical or di-
chotomous variables.
Regression modeling.
To test our study hypothesis, we
modeled each dichotomous outcome measure (probability of im-
pairment or not) with our predictor metric (CHII). This model is
illustrated in Figure 1. We first identified a point (threshold dose) at
which the magnitude of the relationship (slope) changes from a zero
magnitude (B1 = 0) to a non-zero magnitude (B2 > 0). The change
point threshold shows the conversion of the relationship from a
baseline risk of playing football to a dose-response relationship
above which higher exposure to head impacts can lead to higher
risk of impairment.85 The change point was identified using a
Bayesian hierarchical model estimated by Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method with 30,000 simulations implemented in
PROC MCMC in SAS 9.4.85 An important contribution in mod-
eling head impact exposure to long-term outcomes is the incorpo-
ration of concussion history into the model. Because a head impact
is a necessary condition for a concussion, we cannot estimate the
effect of head impacts by controlling for concussions in a simple
regression setup. This relationship between predictors where a
value of one variable is directly caused by another is often de-
scribed as endogenous.86 If endogeneity exists between variables
within our model, the following two problems would occur: 1) a
linear regression model that includes both the CHII and concussion
history would give invalid inference, and 2) the estimates of the
slopes from such a regression model would be biased. To address
the inference and bias problems caused by endogeneity we used an
‘‘instrumental variable model’’ with log concussions as the in-
strument.87 The instrumental variable model can be described as a
two stage regression. In the first stage regression, we estimated the
effect of the log of the number of concussions on the CHII, whereas
in the second stage regression we used the predicted values from the
first stage to estimate the effect of the CHII on the probabilities of
impairment for each of the outcomes. Both regressions included
age and education as covariates. Next, we applied the instrumental
variable model using a bivariate probit model. The estimated effect
of cumulative head impacts derived from this instrumental variable
model is equivalent to an effect estimated among the compliers
from a study where exposure was prospectively randomized.88
Therefore, an instrumental variable model allows for causal in-
ference from observational data with large measurement er-
ror.88,89 Further, the instrumental variable approach reduces the
measurement error of the estimates of frequency of head impacts
by position and level of play. Because the studies used to estimate
these frequencies are independent from the LEGEND study, their
measurement error is uncorrelated from the self-reported con-
cussions in LEGEND. Therefore, in this instance, concussions
become an ideal instrument to calibrate and reduce the mea-
surement error of head impact exposure. Similar approaches in
different settings have been used in econometric and clinical
therapeutic studies.90,91
Comparison with other exposure metrics.
We also exam-
ined total seasons played and AFE as simple exposure metrics that
have demonstrated a significant relationship with clinical outcomes
in other studies.11,32,33,35,36 Total season played and AFE were
independently added to our bivariate probit model, with age and
education as covariates. Next, we modeled clinical outcomes with
concussion history in a separate univariate probit model, with age
and education included as covariates.
Results
Participant demographics and group comparisons
Participant demographics (Table 1), exposure variables (Table 2),
and outcome measures (Table 5) were compared across the two
highest levels of play; that is, high school and college. The college
level group had significantly more years of education (t test = 3.58,
p value = 0.0005), more seasons played (t test= 4.85, p value <
0.0001), a greater number of concussions (Wilcoxon = 592.5,
p value = 0.0431), and a higher CHII (t test= 2.47, p value = 0.0156).
All other group comparisons were nonsignificant. Mean scores on
the BTACT, an objective measure of cognitive function, indicated
that the entire sample was, on average, cognitively normal (Table 5).
CHI exposure and risk of impairment
The CHII was calculated for all 93 participants, and the means
for former high school and collegiate football players are listed in
Table 2.
The CHII change points listed in Table 6 indicate the threshold
number of impacts, above which a dose response relationship is
initiated between exposure (CHII) and the risk of impairment.
Figure 2 shows the predicted probabilities of impairment for dif-
ferent doses of exposure. The baseline risk of impairment signifi-
cantly increases linearly after a change point as exposure increases
in all outcomes. (See Table S1 for a tabular summary of the data
depicted in Fig. 2) (see online supplementary material at http://
www.liebertpub.com)
Specifically, we find that the risk of impairment increases stea-
dily every 1000 impacts, or about twice the sample’s average’s
season number of impacts (545) above the baseline change point.
For all outcomes, the risk of developing clinically meaningful

Each dichotomous outcome measure (A–F) was fit using a bivariate probit, an instrumental variable model adjusted for both
age and education as well as our predictor variable of interest (cumulative head impact index [CHII]). Baseline risk refers to the risk of
impairment at the CHII dose range below the thresholds identified in Table 6. Above these thresholds, a significant linear dose-response
relationship between CHII exposure and later-life clinical impairment was found for all outcomes. See Table S1 for tabular data (see

 impairments in mood, behavior, and cognition increased consid-
erably with two additional seasons worth of head impacts. For
example, we found that adding 10 seasons of impacts above the
baseline threshold increased a subject’s risk of developing objec-
tive cognitive impairment by 9-fold.
Other exposure metrics and risk of impairment
We added alternate exposure metrics to our bivariate probit
model to test whether other metrics might be better at predicting
clinical outcomes and/or whether they might eliminate the pre-
dictive significance of the CHII. Total seasons of play and AFE did
not add independently to our bivariate probit model, nor did they
eliminate the significance of the CHII for predicting clinical out-
comes. When added to the model with the CHII, participants with
AFE <12 showed some increase in the risk for impairment but did
not achieve significance on any outcome after adjusting for CHI:
GEC (b = 0.41, p value = 0.2542), MI (b = 0.36, p value = 0.3456),
BRI (b = 0.56, p value = 0.073), CES-D (b = 0.49, p value = 0.1771),
AES (b = 0.33, p value = 0.4170), and BTACT (b = 0.81, p val-
ue = 0.1427). Interestingly, when controlling for CHI, increasing
the total number of seasons played reduced the risk for clinical
impairment: BRI (b = -0.11, p value = 0.0183), MI (b = -0.09,
p value = 0.0847), GEC (b = -0.07, p value = 0.1586), CES-D (b =
-0.09, p value = 0.1224), AES (b = -0.07, p value = 0.2011), and
BTACT (b = -0.03, p value = 0.6390). The significant negative
association between total seasons played and BRI is consistent with
previous research demonstrating a neurobehavioral benefit from
regular exercise.92–94 The betas (b indicates the magnitude and
direction of the relationship among the predictor, AFE or total
seasons, and the risk for impairment in a model that also takes into
account a quantitative estimate of CHI exposure. For example,
positive betas indicate a positive association between exposure and
impairment, such that increasing exposure was associated with an
increased probability of impairment.
Lastly, we explored the role that concussion history had on
predicting clinical outcomes, and compared its predictive power to
that of the CHII. Because of the endogeneity problem previously
described (i.e., that head impacts are a necessary factor for both the
CHII and concussions) we could not simply include concussion
history as a covariate in our CHII model. The Spearman correlation
between concussion history and the CHII was 0.22 ( p value = 0.02).
Therefore, we ran a univariate probit model with age and education
as covariates, in order to evaluate the predictive power of con-
cussions on the probability of impairment. The estimates were: BRI
(b = 0.50, p value = 0.0109), MI (b = 0.41, p value = 0.0255), GEC
(b = 0.48, p value = 0.0138), CES-D (b = 0.48, p value = 0.0195),
AES (b = 0.30, p value = 0.0717), and BTACT (b = 0.43, p val-
ue = 0.1526). Compared with the CHII, concussion history was
limited to predicting self-reported changes in behavioral regulation
(BRI), cognition (MI), executive dysfunction (GEC), and depres-
sion (CES-D), but not apathy (AES), or objective cognitive dys-
function (BTACT). Even for the significant outcomes (BRI, MI,
GEC, CES-D), concussion history was found to have less predictive
power than the CHII.
Discussion
We developed a metric of cumulative exposure to RHI from
football, the CHII, a measure that includes self-reported exposure
and estimated quantitation of head impacts based on published
helmet accelerometer studies. The CHII was used to examine the
relationship between cumulative RHI exposure and later-life cog-
nitive, mood, and behavioral impairment in a sample of former
football players whose highest level of play was either high school
or college. Subjects denied having played any other contact sport at
any time. The mean CHII of 5806 total impacts for our sample is
consistent with the range of cumulative impacts expected for for-
mer high school and college football players.3 We found that the
CHII strongly predicts later-life clinical outcomes, outperforming
other individual metrics such as concussion history, AFE to tackle
football, and total duration of play, suggesting that it is a useful
metric to estimate lifetime RHI exposure.
We view this study as an initial examination of the CHII, and our
findings of the relationship between earlier RHI exposure and later
life impairments should be considered preliminary because of
several limitations described subsequently. Moreover, this was not
a study of CTE or neurodegeneration; our outcome measures fo-
cused on clinically meaningful levels of cognitive, mood, and be-
havior impairment and did not include any biomarkers of
underlying disease or injury. This study does, however, underscore
the importance of subconcussive trauma in the development of later
life neurological impairment. The number of self-reported con-
cussions predicted impairment in fewer outcomes than the CHII.
Compared with the CHII, concussion history did not significantly
predict apathy or objective cognitive dysfunction (BTACT). These
findings are consistent with previous imaging studies of amateur
athletes that demonstrated that changes in brain functional imaging
occurred after a single season of cumulative asymptomatic impacts
without concussion,10,26,27 and postmortem studies that indicated
that 16% of former contact sport athletes with pathologically ver-
ified CTE had no concussion history.30,36 These studies together
with our current findings highlight the critical need to evaluate
prospectively the potential risk and later-life consequences of ex-
posure to repetitive asymptomatic blows to the head (i.e., sub-
concussive impacts).
This study is the first in the literature to demonstrate a threshold
dose-response relationship between estimated cumulative head
impact exposure from football and later-life risk for cognitive and
neurobehavioral impairment. We found that after a threshold, the
risk for impairment increased with additional impacts. Similar
findings of a threshold dose-response from RHI have been reported
in studies of soccer and boxing.35,95–97 Specifically, our results
show that the risk of developing behavioral dysregulation, execu-
tive dysfunction, depression, and apathy nearly doubled with 2800
additional impacts above the threshold. Our findings also show that
increasing the CHI dose from 6500 to >12,000 increased the risk for
objective cognitive impairment by a considerable 25-fold.
Interestingly, the dose-response threshold for cognitive function
was much higher relative to other outcomes. Although this is
speculative, it is possible that changes in mood and behavior reflect
a different underlying mechanism or areas of structural impairment
than cognitive changes, and that the cognitive changes reflect the
evolution and progression of underlying CTE pathology.36,98 This
is consistent with previous imaging studies in soccer players,
wherein a lower threshold for detecting microstructural brain
changes from soccer heading was identified compared with the
threshold for memory impairment on neuropsychological evalua-
tion.95 Further, in CTE, individuals with cognitive symptoms
present later in the clinical course than those with behavioral im-
pairments.98
Our findings indicate that below identified thresholds, accumu-
lated impacts have no apparent effect on the risk for cognitive or
neurobehavioral impairment. However, individuals had a baseline
constant risk below the threshold. This baseline risk does not

 suggest that safety below the threshold is assumed. Moreover, our
study design does not allow us to determine a safe time to cease
RHI exposure; that is, quit football. Further, the baseline risk and
the threshold likely depend upon several subject-specific factors
such as possible genetic susceptibility, body mass index, socio-
economic status, and cognitive reserve.99 Large, well-controlled,
prospective, longitudinal research that distinguishes threshold ef-
fects and baseline risk in football is clearly needed to identify
maximum exposure levels for each player’s safety. Such research
would ultimately facilitate the development of safety guidelines
that could minimize the risk of adverse effects on the brain in
football.
Considering the public health implications of our study, there is
also a need to investigate any causal evidence between RHI ex-
posure and clinical impairment. Establishing cause indicates the
possibility of intervention. We utilized the Bradford–Hill criteria
for evaluating causal inference in observational studies,100 and our
findings are suggestive of a causal relationship between cumula-
tive head impact exposure and later-life clinical impairment. We
analyzed eight Bradford–Hill criteria in our model: strength, dose-
response, consistency, plausibility, coherence, experiment, re-
versibility, temporality, and specificity. Strength of association
between our predictor, the CHII and all six measures of clinical
impairment was very strong and higher than any other exposure
predictor. The dose-response criterion is of particular importance
in disorders that exhibit a latent onset, and this was supported by
the present study.101 Regarding consistency of association, the
dose-response relationship has also been shown in boxers.94,102,103
The plausibility of association is supported by human and animal
studies that show cumulative subconcussive impacts and axonal
Injury and blood–brain barrier damage.10,11,28,93,104–107,108 Since
1928, a relationship has been hypothesized between RHI and neuro-
logical disease, supporting the notion of coherence of association.106
Animal models have shown that a reduced number of impacts results
in reduced negative consequences to support experimentation of as-
sociation and the reversibility of association.109,110 Lastly, exposure
must precede the disease, which conforms to observations in all
previous studies and demonstrates temporality of association.
These findings do not suggest that every individual with a history
of RHI – even exposure above the reported thresholds – will have
later-life cognitive, mood, or behavioral impairments or develop a
neurodegenerative disease, such as CTE. Support of a causal rela-
tionship does not imply a universal relationship. For example, a
causal relationship between smoking tobacco and subsequent lung
cancer has long been accepted. However, not all smokers develop
lung cancer; some develop other conditions and diseases causally
linked to smoking (e.g., stroke, heart disease, emphysema), and still
others remain healthy throughout their lives. We hope that the use of
the CHII (and subsequent iterations of this exposure metric) will
result in greater clarification and validation of the causal relationship
between football-related RHI and later-life clinical impairment.
The current study has clear limitations. Although all the accel-
erometer studies used to measure RHI discarded linear accelera-
tions <10g, some of the studies used a slightly higher minimum
cutoff to register a hit. However, small differences in cutoff points
are likely not meaningful given that the majority of recorded im-
pacts had mean accelerations well above the minimum cutoff points
(as supported by the data summarized in Table 3). For example, the
frequency of impacts per season reported by Mihalik and co-
workers55 was lower than the frequency reported by Crisco and
coworkers,57 despite having used a lower cutoff (Mihalik 10g;
Crisco 14.4g). Additional research using both helmet-based and
head-based accelerometers is needed to develop standardized,
consensus based cutoff points.66 In addition, within the CHII, it is
assumed that players are active in both games and practice, and
does not take into account players who do not participate in games.
Participants in our study were active players in games in high
school and in college. For example, former college players in our
study averaged 3.6 years of play and 50% game involvement.
Therefore, because of the possible difference in RHI exposure
between reserve players (who participate in all practices but have
limited game involvement) and starters (who participate in all
practices and have extensive game involvement), and because of
the potential discrepancy in the frequency and severity of RHI
exposure between practices and games, our findings may not ac-
curately reflect differences in long-term consequences between
starters and reserve players. Moreover, our study evaluated only
certain aspects of exposure (i.e., cumulative impacts) and did not
use other possible biomechanical metrics, such as cumulative linear
and rotational accelerations. The sample size of the present study
was also small because of the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The present results will need replication in larger studies. Further,
despite our analytic approach, the study design is cross-sectional,
which limits the extent to causal inference. Our convenience
sample may induce a self-selection bias limiting the external va-
lidity of our findings. However, our instrumental variable analytic
approach reduced the measurement error bias and potential con-
founding effects.111 Specifically, this method allowed us to provide
unbiased estimates of causal effects in our nonrandomized sam-
ple88,89 and is increasingly utilized in clinical studies112,113 par-
ticularly when there are obstacles to performing a randomized
controlled trial.
Future studies will be necessary to validate the CHII and im-
prove our understanding on the long-term clinical consequences of
RHI exposure. Larger studies are needed to investigate the effect of
CHI exposure by age and level. Studies utilizing objective fluid and
neuroimaging biomarkers will allow for a better understanding of
the underlying etiology associated with CHI exposure. Case-
controlled postmortem studies will also be necessary to examine
the association between the CHII and CTE (and other) neuropa-
thology. There is also the need to examine additional potential risk
factors that may modify the relationship between RHI exposure and
later-life cognitive and neurobehavioral impairment, including, but
not limited to, genetics, diet, exercise, substance use (including
performance enhancing drugs), and cardiovascular risk. Finally,
there is a need for similar models of cumulative RHI exposure for
other contact sports, once accelerometer or some other objective
measure of head impacts is more widely available.
Conclusion
We developed the CHII, a tool to quantify retrospective cumu-
lative exposure to RHI, including subconcussive impacts. Using the
CHII, we showed that RHI exposure among amateur football
players is associated with later-life cognitive and neurobehavioral
consequences. Although our findings raise safety concerns for
participation in amateur football, prior to changes in policy and
rules, prospective longitudinal research in larger samples is needed
to validate the CHII and replicate and extend our associated
findings.
