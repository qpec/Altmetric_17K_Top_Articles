Rivaroxaban with or without aspirin in patients with stable peripheral or
carotid artery disease: an international, randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial
COMPASS Investigators; et al; Anand, Sonia S
Abstract: BACKGROUND Patients with peripheral artery disease have an increased risk of cardio-
vascular morbidity and mortality. Antiplatelet agents are widely used to reduce these complications.
METHODS This was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial for which patients
were recruited at 602 hospitals, clinics, or community practices from 33 countries across six continents.
Eligible patients had a history of peripheral artery disease of the lower extremities (previous peripheral
bypass surgery or angioplasty, limb or foot amputation, intermittent claudication with objective evidence
of peripheral artery disease), of the carotid arteries (previous carotid artery revascularisation or asymp-
tomatic carotid artery stenosis of at least 50%), or coronary artery disease with an ankle-brachial index
of less than 0·90. After a 30-day run-in period, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral
rivaroxaban (2·5 mg twice a day) plus aspirin (100 mg once a day), rivaroxaban twice a day (5 mg with
aspirin placebo once a day), or to aspirin once a day (100 mg and rivaroxaban placebo twice a day).
Randomisation was computer generated. Each treatment group was double dummy, and the patient,
investigators, and central study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke; the primary peripheral artery disease outcome was
major adverse limb events including major amputation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
number NCT01776424, and is closed to new participants. FINDINGS Between March 12, 2013, and May
10, 2016, we enrolled 7470 patients with peripheral artery disease from 558 centres. The combination of
rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone reduced the composite endpoint of cardiovascular
death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (126 [5%] of 2492 vs 174 [7%] of 2504; hazard ratio [HR] 0·72,
95% CI 0·57-0·90, p=0·0047), and major adverse limb events including major amputation (32 [1%] vs
60 [2%]; HR 0·54 95% CI 0·35-0·82, p=0·0037). Rivaroxaban 5 mg twice a day compared with aspirin
alone did not significantly reduce the composite endpoint (149 [6%] of 2474 vs 174 [7%] of 2504; HR 0·86,
95% CI 0·69-1·08, p=0·19), but reduced major adverse limb events including major amputation (40
[2%] vs 60 [2%]; HR 0·67, 95% CI 0·45-1·00, p=0·05). The median duration of treatment was 21
months. The use of the rivaroxaban plus aspirin combination increased major bleeding compared with
the aspirin alone group (77 [3%] of 2492 vs 48 [2%] of 2504; HR 1·61, 95% CI 1·12-2·31, p=0·0089),
which was mainly gastrointestinal. Similarly, major bleeding occurred in 79 (3%) of 2474 patients with
rivaroxaban 5 mg, and in 48 (2%) of 2504 in the aspirin alone group (HR 1·68, 95% CI 1·17-2·40;
p=0·0043). INTERPRETATION Low-dose rivaroxaban taken twice a day plus aspirin once a day re-
duced major adverse cardiovascular and limb events when compared with aspirin alone. Although major
bleeding was increased, fatal or critical organ bleeding was not. This combination therapy represents an
important advance in the management of patients with peripheral artery disease. Rivaroxaban alone did
not significantly reduce major adverse cardiovascular events compared with asprin alone, but reduced
major adverse limb events and increased major bleeding. FUNDING Bayer AG.

Introduction
Patients with carotid artery disease or with peripheral 
artery disease of the lower extremities are at high risk for 
major adverse cardiovascular events,1–3 and patients with 
peripheral artery disease of the lower extremities are also 
at high risk for major adverse limb events such as severe 
limb ischaemia and amputation.4 In addition to smoking 
cessation and exercise, statins, angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents (aspirin 
or a P2Y12 inhibitor) are used to reduce vascular 
complications.4–6 Anticoagulant therapies have not been 
shown to be superior to antiplatelet therapy in peripheral 
artery disease and have unacceptably high rates of 
major bleeding.7 Specifically, high intensity (international

normalised ratio [INR] of 3–4·5) and moderate intensity 
warfarin (INR 2–3) used with aspirin does not reduce 
major adverse cardiovascular events but does increase 
the 
risk 
of 
life-threatening 
bleeding, 
including 
intracranial haemorrhage.7,8 Furthermore, ticagrelor was 
not superior to clopidogrel in reducing major adverse 
cardiovascular events or major adverse limb events in 
patients with peripheral artery disease.9 Dual antiplatelet 
therapy is not consistently superior to single antiplatelet 
therapy in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events 
or major adverse limb events in patients with peripheral 
artery disease.10,11 Vorapaxar, a platelet receptor modulator, 
did not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in 
patients with peripheral artery disease but acute limb 
ischaemia was significantly reduced, and there was an 
increase in moderate and severe bleeding.12
Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, is effective in 
treating venous thromboembolism,13 and has been shown 
to prevent thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation.14 
Low dose rivaroxaban prevents venous thromboembolism 
after orthopaedic surgery,15 and the Acute Coronary 
Syndrome–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 51 
(ATLAS-2) trial16 showed that low-dose rivaroxaban 
(2·5 mg twice a day) used in addition to dual antiplatelet 
therapy reduced major adverse cardiovascular events in 
patients with acute coronary syndromes, although 
rivaroxaban alone (5 mg twice a day) increased major, 
intracranial, and fatal bleeds. In the COMPASS trial,17 we 
sought to identify whether a low dose of rivaroxaban 
given twice a day when used with aspirin or without 
aspirin, was more effective than aspirin alone in reducing 
major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse 
limb events in patients with peripheral artery disease.
Methods
Study design and participants
The design of COMPASS has been previously published.17 
COMPASS was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled trial comparing low-dose rivaroxaban 
with aspirin or rivaroxaban alone (with aspirin placebo) 
versus aspirin alone (with rivaroxaban placebo) for 
prevention of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, 
and stroke in patients with coronary artery disease or 
peripheral artery disease who were receiving other 
proven therapies. Patients with a need for dual 
antiplatelet 
therapy, 
other 
non-aspirin 
antiplatelet 
therapy, oral anticoagulant therapy, strong inhibitors of 
CYP 3A4, strong inducers of CYP 3A4, or other 
medication with known interactions with rivaroxaban 
were excluded from the trial.17 Patients were enrolled 
from 602 hospitals, clinics, or community practices in 
33 countries  across six continents (appendix). To be 
eligible for trial inclusion, patients with peripheral artery 
disease were required to have one of the following: aorto-
femoral bypass surgery, limb bypass surgery, percutaneous 
transluminal angioplasty revascularisation of the iliac, or 
infrainguinal arteries; or limb or foot amputation for 
arterial vascular disease; or intermittent claudication and 
one or more of either an ankle brachial index (ABI) of less 
than 0·90 or a peripheral artery stenosis (≥50%) 
documented by angiography or duplex ultrasound; or 
carotid revascular 
isation or asymptomatic carotid artery 
stenosis of at least 50% diagnosed by duplex ultrasound or 
angiography. Because ABI was measured in all trial 
participants at baseline, patients enrolled with coronary 
artery disease who had an ABI of less than 0·90 were 
included in the overall peripheral artery disease cohort. 
The ABI was calculated by the ratio of the highest limb 
systolic blood pressure over the highest brachial systolic 
blood pressure and Doppler measurements were not 
required. All peripheral artery disease definitions used in 
COMPASS are found in the appendix.
Patients with a high risk of bleeding, stroke within 
1 month, a history of haemorrhagic or lacunar stroke, 
severe heart failure with a known ejection fraction of less 
than 30%, or estimated glomerular filtration rate of less 
than 15 mL/min were excluded. Detailed exclusion 
criteria have been published.17 The protocol was approved 
Research in context 
Evidence before this study
Patients with peripheral artery disease are at high risk for major 
cardiovascular and limb events. The mainstay of treatment for 
patients with peripheral artery disease includes use of a single 
antiplatelet agent daily to prevent major adverse cardiovascular 
events. Other antithrombotic regimens have been tested in 
patients with peripheral artery disease including vitamin K 
antagonists and newer antiplatelet agents including P2Y12 
antagonists used alone or in combination with aspirin, but none 
have been shown to be superior to antiplatelet therapy alone.
Added value of this study
The peripheral artery disease analysis of the COMPASS trial 
shows that use of low-dose rivaroxaban twice a day, together 
with aspirin 100 mg once a day, reduces cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute limb 
ischaemia and amputation, compared with aspirin alone. 
Although there is an increase in bleeding leading to more 
hospital admissions, there is no excess of fatal bleeding, 
intracranial bleeding, or bleeding into critical organs. Thus, 
the net clinical benefit favours the use of low-dose 
rivaroxaban plus aspirin.
Implications of all the available evidence
The combination of low dose rivaroxaban twice a day with 
aspirin could replace aspirin alone as standard of care in 
patients with stable peripheral artery disease who are not at 
high risk for bleeding.

by health authorities and institutional review boards in 
all participating countries and written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
either low-dose rivaroxaban with aspirin, rivaroxaban 
alone, or aspirin alone stratified by centre and use of 
proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). A computer-generated 
randomisation schedule was generated by the Population 
Health Research Institute. Each treatment group was 
double dummy, and the patient, investigators, and central 
study staff were masked to treatment allocation. Patients 
who were not already taking a PPI were also randomly 
assigned to receive pantoprazole or an equivalent placebo. 
This component of the trial is continuing, and is not 
reported in this Article.
Procedures
Eligible patients entered a 30-day run-in phase during 
which time they received rivaroxaban placebo twice a day 
and aspirin 100 mg once a day, both administered orally. 
After the run-in period, participants who adhered to the 
assigned regimen and who did not have any adverse 
events, were randomly assigned to receive either 
rivaroxaban 2·5 mg twice a day with aspirin 100 mg once a 
day, rivaroxaban 5 mg twice a day (with aspirin placebo 
once a day), or aspirin 100 mg once a day (with rivaroxaban 
placebo twice a day). At the randomisation  visit, patients 
were assessed for eligibility, adherence to run-in 
medications, had physical measurements taken including 
blood pressure and ankle brachial index, and answered 
questionnaires to obtain data on the participants’ health 
and quality of life. Participants were seen at 1 and 6 months 
after randomisation and 6 month intervals thereafter. 
Patients were assessed at follow-up visits to record 
outcomes and adverse events, and to enhance adherence. 
Additional follow-up visits were done via telephone at 
3 and 9 months.
Outcomes
The primary cardiovascular efficacy outcome was the 
composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction 
or stroke. Peripheral artery disease outcomes were 
prespecified and included: acute limb ischaemia, chronic 
limb ischaemia, and amputation (appendix). Acute limb 
ischaemia was defined as limb threatening ischaemia with 
evidence of acute arterial obstruction by radiological 
criteria or a new pulse deficit leading to an intervention 
(ie, surgery, thrombolysis, peripheral angioplasty, or 
amputation) within 30 days of symptoms onset. All cases 
of reported acute limb ischaemia were verified using a 
diagnostic algorithm developed for use in COMPASS, and 
an adjudicator reviewed the event if the diagnostic 
algorithm did not confirm the event. Chronic limb 
ischaemia was defined as severe limb ischaemia leading to 
a vascular intervention. Major amputation was defined as 
amputations due to a vascular event above the forefoot, or

defined as minor amputation if involving the forefoot and 
digits. Key composite outcomes for peripheral artery 
disease were major adverse limb events (defined as the 
development of acute or chronic limb ischaemia over the 
course of the trial follow-up, including any additional 
major amputations due to a vascular event that was not 
included in acute or chronic limb ischaemia), the 
composite of major adverse cardiovascular events and 
major adverse limb events, and the composite of major 
adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, or stroke) and major adverse limb 
events including major amputations. 
The primary safety outcome was major bleeding and we 
used a modification of the International Society on 
Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria for major 
bleeding, defined as the composite of bleeding that was 
fatal, symptomatic bleeding into a critical organ, surgical 
site requiring reoperation, or requiring hospitalisation 
(including presentation to an acute care facility without an 
overnight stay). The net clinical benefit outcome for the 
overall trial was prespecified as cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, or fatal or critical bleeding. 
For peripheral artery disease, we also examined the net 
clinical benefit of major adverse cardiovascular events or 
major adverse limb events including major amputation 
offset by fatal or critical organ bleeds.
Statistical analysis
The overall trial was designed to have at least 90% power to 
detect a 20% relative risk reduction of major adverse 
cardiovascular events in each of the rivaroxaban treatment 
groups compared with aspirin. The overall trial, which 
enrolled 27 395 participants, was an event-driven trial that 
was planned to be continued until at least 2200 participants 
had a confirmed primary out 
come event.
The peripheral artery disease analysis was a pre-specified 
subgroup with no specific plan to adjust for multiple 
testing. Adjustments for multiple testing were only done 
for the main study. The peripheral artery disease outcome 
definitions were specified in advance and we verified 
events using an algorithm and, when needed, adjudication 
by a vascular disease expert physician. All outcomes that 
occurred after randomisation and before the recommend-
ation of the data and safety monitoring board to stop the 
trial on Feb 6, 2017, were included in the analysis. At this 
time the only information divulged to the members of the 
peripheral artery disease sub-committee was information 
included in the press release by the company that the 
overall results on the primary outcome were clearly 
favourable. No information on any subgroups or numerical 
details of results were shared with the peripheral artery 
disease committee who finalised the analysis plan without 
any knowledge of the results in the peripheral artery 
disease subgroup or information from individual patients. 
Each of the two rivaroxaban-based regimens were 
compared with the aspirin control group. We did these two 
comparisons using two separate stratified log-rank tests. 
Analysis of outcomes were based on Kaplan-Meier 
estimates of cumulative risk over time. We estimated

proportional hazards models. We verified linearity and 
proportionality of the hazard ratios. We examined 
treatment effects in subgroups of patients with peripheral 
artery disease including by location of disease and by key 
baseline characteristics.
An independent data and safety monitoring board 
monitored the overall study with formal stopping 
guidelines for efficacy and non-formal guidelines for 
safety. Details are provided elsewhere.17,18 This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01776424, 
and is closed to new participants.
Role of the funding source
The study was designed by the Steering Committee and 
the sponsor, Bayer AG. Site management, data collection, 
and data analysis were coordinated at the Population 
Health Research Institute, which is affiliated with 
Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University in 
ON, Canada. The authors had full access to the data and 
take responsibility for the results.
Results
Between March 12, 2013, and May 10, 2016, 27 395 patients 
were enrolled into the overall COMPASS trial. The 
planned original sample size for COMPASS was 
19 500 patients of which we planned to enrol at least 
5000 patients with peripheral artery disease (25% of the 
total). However the sample size was increased due to 
slower than expected recruitment and a lower than 
expected aggregate event rate of the primary outcome, 
6048 participants with symptomatic peripheral artery 
disease were enrolled and an additional 1422 patients 
enrolled with coronary artery disease who had an ABI of 
less than 0·90 at baseline were included in the peripheral 
artery disease cohort before the working group became 
aware of the trial results, for a total of 7470 patients with 
peripheral artery disease.
The independent data and safety monitoring board 
recommended early termination of the rivaroxaban and 
aspirin portion of the overall study on Feb 6, 2017, 
having observed a reduction in the primary outcome in 
favour of the low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin group, 
which met their formal efficacy stopping guidelines 
criteria. All events that occurred by this date are 
included in the analysis. 8101 patients with peripheral 
artery disease were screened and entered the run-in 
portion of the study (figure 1). Of the 7470 patients 
classified as having peripheral artery disease, 6048 met 
the inclusion criteria for symptomatic peripheral artery 
disease, including 4129 (55%) with symptomatic 
peripheral artery disease of the lower extremities, and 
1919 (26%) who had previous carotid revascularisation

or carotid stenosis of at least 50%. An additional 
1422 patients (20%) who met the trial inclusion criteria 
for coronary artery disease who had an ABI of less 
than 0·90 were included and designated as having 
asymptomatic peripheral artery disease. 7457 patients 
(>99%) had complete follow-up (figure 1). The median 
duration of the follow-up was 21 months. At the final 
follow up visit, 392 (17%) of 2345 participants randomly 
assigned to rivaroxaban plus aspirin, 418 (18%) of 
2322 participants assigned to rivaroxaban alone, and 
378 (16%) of 2343 participants assigned to aspirin alone 
were permanently off study drug. Efficacy and safety 
outcomes are presented per 100 patient-years of 
follow-up in the appendix.
The results for each peripheral artery disease subgroup 
for key efficacy and safety outcomes are shown in the 
appendix. The characteristics of those with peripheral 
artery disease were well balanced between the three 
treatment groups (table 1). The mean age was 67·8 years 
(SD 8·5), 5361 (72%) were men, 5496 (74%) were current 
or former smokers, and 4906 (66%) also had coronary 
artery disease.
The 
primary 
outcome 
of 
cardiovascular 
death, 
myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 126 (5%) of 
2492 patients with peripheral artery disease who received 
low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin and in 174 (7%) of 
2504 patients who received aspirin alone. (table 2, figure 2) 
Low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin was superior to 
aspirin alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·72, 95% CI 0·57–0·90, 
p=0·0047). By contrast, the primary outcome in the 
rivaroxaban alone group was not significantly superior to 
that seen in the aspirin alone group (149 [6%] of 2474 vs 
174 [7%] of 2504; HR 0·86, 95% CI 0·69–1·08, p=0·19). 
A similar pattern was observed for the composite of: 
coronary heart disease deaths, myocardial infarction, 
ischaemic stroke, and acute limb ischaemia with the low-
dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin group being significantly 
superior to the aspirin alone group (115 [5%] of 2492 vs 
169 [7%] of 2504; HR 0·68, 95% CI 0·53–0·86, p=0·0011) 
and the rivoroxaban alone group showing no difference to 
the aspirin alone group (147 [6%] of 2474 vs 169 [7%] of 
2504; HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·70–1·10, p=0·25). The combined 
outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, 
ischaemic stroke, or acute limb ischaemia was less 
frequent in the low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin group 
than in the aspirin alone group (142 [6%] of 2492 vs 
198 [8%] of 2504; HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·57–0·88, p=0·0019), 
but similar between the rivaroxaban alone and aspirin 
alone groups (168 [7%] of 2474 vs 198 [8%] of 2504; 
HR 0·86, 95% CI 0·70–1·05, p=0·14; table 2). There was 
no significant reduction in total mortality in the low-dose 
rivaroxaban plus aspirin group when compared with the 
aspirin alone group (HR 0·91, 95% CI 0·72–1·16, p=0·45).
Major adverse limb events were also significantly 
lower in the low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin 
group compared with the aspirin alone group (30 [1%] 
of 2492 vs 56 [2%] of 2504; HR 0·54, 95% CI 0·35–0·84, 
p=0·0054). Similarly, major adverse limb events were 
also significantly lower in the rivaroxaban alone group 
than in the aspirin alone group (35 [1%] of 2474 vs 
56 [2%] of 2504; HR 0·63, 95% CI 0·41–0·96, p=0·032). 
The rate of acute limb ischaemia was also significantly 
lower in the low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin group 
and the rivaroxaban alone group when compared with 
the aspirin alone group (table 2). Major amputations 
were fewer in the low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin 
group when compared with aspirin alone (HR 0·30, 
95% CI 0·11–0·80), but no significant reduction was 
observed for rivaroxaban alone group when compared 
with the aspirin alone group (HR 0·46, 95% CI 
0·20–1·08). Although most major amputations of

vascular cause were reported in conjunction with acute 
or chronic limb ischaemia, two events in the low-dose 
rivaroxaban plus aspirin group, five in the rivaroxaban 
alone group, and four in the aspirin group were not. 
Taken together, compared to aspirin, the combination of 
rivaroxaban plus aspirin significantly reduced the 
combination major adverse limb events plus all major 
amputations of a vascular cause by 46% (HR 0·54, 
95% CI 0·35–0·82, p=0·0037) and a reduction of 33% 
was seen with rivaroxaban alone when compared with 
aspirin alone (HR 0·67, 95% CI 0·45–1·00, p=0·046; 
table 2, figure 3).
The composite of major adverse cardiovascular events or 
major adverse limb events was also significantly lower in 
the low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin group than in the 
aspirin alone group (155 [6%] of 2492 vs 222 [9%] of 2504; 
HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·56–0·85, p=0·0004) but was not lower 
in the rivaroxaban alone group than in the aspirin alone 
group (184 [7%] of 2474 vs 222 [9%] of 2504; HR 0·83, 
95% CI 0·68–1·01, p=0·065; table 2) Additionally, there 
were fewer major amputations such that the addition 
of this outcome reinforced the reductions in major 
adverse cardiovascular events or major adverse limb 
events including major amputation leading to a 31% risk 
reduction with low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus 
aspirin alone (p=0·0003; appendix), but there were no 
significant reductions in this outcome with rivaroxaban 
alone versus aspirin alone (p=0·077; table 2)
Major bleeding occurred in 77 (3%) of 2492 patients 
who had low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin, 79 (3%) of 
2474 patients who had rivaroxaban alone, and in 
48 patients (2%) of 2504 who had aspirin alone (table 3). 
There was a relative increase in major bleeding in the 
low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin group compared with 
the aspirin alone group (HR 1·61, 95% CI 1·12–2·31, 
p=0·0089) and also in the rivaroxaban alone group 
when compared with aspirin alone (HR 1·68, 95% CI 
1·17–2·40; p=0·0043). No differences in fatal bleeding or 
non-fatal intracranial haemorrhages or symptomatic 
bleeding into a critical organ were observed between any

of the treatment groups. Other major bleeding including 
surgical site bleeding requiring re-operation or bleeding 
leading to hospitalisation was significantly increased in 
patients receiving the low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin 
than in the aspirin alone group (HR 1·94, 95% CI 
1·24–3·04, p=0·0031); similarly, this increase was also 
seen in the rivaroxaban alone group when compared 
with the asprin alone group (HR 1·86, 95% CI 1·18–2·92, 
p=0·0064). The most common site of bleeding for all 
groups was gastrointestinal (table 3).
The prespecified net clinical benefit outcome consisting 
of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and 
fatal or critical organ bleeding occurred in 140 (6%) of 
2492 patients with low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin and 
in 185 (7%) of 2504 with aspirin alone (HR 0·75, 95% CI 
0·60–0·94, p=0·011) and in 168 (7%) of 2474 patients 
rivaroxaban alone, which was similar to the aspirin alone 
group (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·75–1·13, p=0·43). The net 
clinical benefit outcome including major adverse 
cardiovascular events or major adverse limb events 
including major amputation, or fatal or critical organ 
bleeding occurred in 169 (7%) rivaroxaban plus aspirin 
compared to 234 patients (9%) in aspirin alone (HR 0·72, 
95% CI 0·59–0·87, p=0·0008). Thus, for every 1000 patients 
treated 27 major adverse cardio 
vascular events or major 
adverse limb events including major amputation would be 
prevented and one fatal and one critical organ bleed would 
be caused over a 21-month period. Additional net clinical 
benefit data are presented in the appendix.
The effects of low-dose rivaraxoban plus aspirin on the 
efficacy outcomes were consistently better than aspirin 
alone across various subgroups of peripheral artery 
disease including that of the lower extremities and 
carotid artery disease (figure 4). Furthermore, the effects 
of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin alone 
on the combined outcome of major adverse cardiovascular 
events and major adverse limb events including major 
amputation were consistent in patients with and without 
diabetes, patients who were current versus former or 
never smokers, those with lower extremity peripheral 
artery disease versus other peripheral artery disease, 
those who had an ABI of less than 0·90 versus ≥0·90, 
those with symptomatic peripheral artery disease versus 
patients with coronary artery disease who had an ABI of 
less than 0·90, and those with and without coronary 
artery disease. (figure 5)
Discussion
Patients with peripheral artery disease who were enrolled 
into the COMPASS trial and received the combination of 
rivaroxaban 2·5 mg twice a day plus aspirin 100 mg a day 
had fewer major adverse cardiovascular events by 28%, 
major adverse limb events by 46%, and the composite of 
major adverse cardiovascular or limb events by 31% 
compared with the aspirin alone group. Although this 
combination was associated with an increase in risk of 
major bleeding, there was no excess in fatal or critical 
organ bleeds, and the benefit–risk analysis indicates 
a net benefit. Rivaroxaban 5 mg twice a day, when 
compared with aspirin alone did not significantly 
decrease major adverse cardiovascular events, but 
decreased limb events, and increased major bleeding.
Patients with peripheral artery disease often have 
widespread atherosclerosis and have an increased risk of 
atherothrombotic events in multiple vascular territories 
(ie, coronary, cerebral, and peripheral) and mortality.19,20 
Finding effective and relatively safe antithrombotic 
regimens for patients with peripheral artery disease to 
decrease major adverse cardiovascular events and major 
adverse limb events with an acceptable bleeding profile 
has been challenging, and there have been few large 
clinical trials that have been done in patients with 
peripheral artery disease.21 Moderate intensity vitamin K 
antagonist therapy with antiplatelet therapy is associated 
with a substantial increase in life-threatening bleedings, 
and no reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events 
or major adverse limb events.7 Furthermore, single and 
dual antiplatelet regimens have not conclusively shown 
reductions in major adverse limb events.10,20,22,23 Before 
COMPASS, the most promising therapies for patients 
with chronic stable peripheral artery disease were 
clopidogrel which was superior to aspirin to prevent 
major adverse cardiac events,24 although the efficacy in 
preventing limb events was less clear; and the platelet 
receptor antagonist vorapaxar12 used together with other 
antiplatelet drugs. In TRA2P-TIMI 50,12 although the

composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, 
and stroke was reduced with vorapaxar in the overall 
trial, no significant benefit was observed in patients with 
peripheral artery disease, and there was more moderate 
or severe bleeding. However, a reduction in acute limb 
ischaemia and peripheral revascularisation was observed 
with vorapaxar.
In COMPASS we studied a broad range of patients 
with peripheral artery disease including those with 
symptomatic peripheral artery disease of the lower 
extremities, carotid artery disease and those with 
coronary artery disease with an ABI of less than 0·90 
who were well treated with medical therapy as shown by 
the high use of statins and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin 
receptor blockers. The use of proven medical therapies in 
patients with peripheral artery disease has increased over 
the past 10 years in clinical trials7,9 and is likely to 
contribute to the lower than expected rate of 
cardiovascular events. This finding emphasises the 
importance of optimising treatment in the general 
peripheral artery disease population.4,25,26 Consistent 
benefits in the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular 
events and major adverse limb events occurred with 
combination of rivaroxaban 2·5 mg plus aspirin 
compared with aspirin alone but did not occur to the 
same extent with the rivaroxaban 5 mg twice a day 
regimen. These results are also consistent with the 
results of the overall trial, which have been reported 
separately.18 Collectively, these results show that in 
patients with arterial vascular disease, low dose 
anticoagulants and aspirin have an additive effect. The 
subgroup of patients with peripheral artery disease but 
no coronary artery disease was too small to show 
significance on its own, but the results were directionally 
consistent with the rest of the patients in the analysis, 
and the test for heterogeneity was not significant.
In this patient population with stable peripheral artery 
disease, major adverse limb events (which includes acute 
and chronic limb ischaemia leading to peripheral artery 
interventions such as peripheral artery revascularisation 
and amputation) were reduced by almost half with the 
combination of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin when 
compared with aspirin alone. This is an important 
finding because persistent, severe limb ischaemia 
threatens limb viability and can lead to amputation, 
which in turn increases the risk of major adverse 
cardiovascular events.19 Furthermore, major amputation 
is associated with a 50% risk of mortality in the year after

the procedure27,28 and any therapy that can reduce a 
patient’s risk of developing acute limb ischaemia and 
major amputation might also reduce their future risk of 
major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality.20
Patients with peripheral artery disease are also at 
increased risk of bleeding, which is partly explained by 
their high number of comorbid conditions such as 
advanced age and renal insufficiency.7,8,23 In COMPASS, 
although an increase in major bleeding was observed in 
both rivaroxaban groups when compared with aspirin 
alone, there was no excess in fatal or critical organ bleeds, 
bleeding into a surgical site requiring reoperation, and 
no excess of major bleeding observed in the peripheral 
artery disease subgroup compared with the coronary 
artery disease subgroup.29 Furthermore, most of the 
bleedings were gastrointestinal, which rarely leave 
permanent sequelae. The net clinical benefit in patients 
with peripheral artery disease, which considers the 
decrease in major adverse cardiovascular events and the 
increase in fatal or critical organ bleeding, favours 
rivaroxaban 2·5 mg plus aspirin compared with aspirin 
alone, and when major adverse cardiovascular events 
and major adverse limb events including amputation are 
combined, the net clinical benefit is similar.
Our study has some limitations. First, since the overall 
COMPASS study was stopped before its planned number 
of total events, confidence intervals are slightly less 
precise than those planned for the primary outcomes, 
secondary outcomes, and subgroup analyses. Second, a 
third of patients with peripheral artery disease were 
taking a PPI at the outset of the trial and, of the remaining 
patients, half were randomly assigned to receive an active 
PPI and the other half to placebo. If PPIs reduce 
gastrointestinal bleeds, it is possible that the high use of 
PPI might have reduced the risk of bleeding in all the 
treatment groups. This issue can only be clarified after 
completion of the PPI component of the COMPASS trial. 
Third, ABI was measured using a sphygmomanometer 
and palpation of the artery in most individuals (73%) and 
a Doppler probe was used in only 24% of participants. 
The use of the Doppler probe is not common in cardiology 
clinics, especially outside high-income countries. Never-
theless, the simpler approach to measuring ABI is 
predictive of future major adverse cardiovascular events 
in previous studies.30 Furthermore, patients with coronary 
artery disease who had no known clinical peripheral 
artery disease but who had an ABI of less than 0·90 were 
included in the peripheral artery disease cohort. However, 
most patients who were included in this analysis 
had clinical evidence of peripheral artery disease and, 
importantly, the benefits of treatment of low-dose 
rivaroxaban and aspirin were consistent across all of the 
peripheral artery disease subgroups.
In conclusion, low-dose rivaroxaban used together with 
aspirin was more effective than aspirin alone in 
preventing both major adverse cardiovascular and limb 
events including major amputation and increased major 
bleeding, although there was little fatal or critical organ 
bleeding. Therefore, the combination of rivaroxaban and 
aspirin represents an important advance in the 
management of patients with peripheral artery disease.
