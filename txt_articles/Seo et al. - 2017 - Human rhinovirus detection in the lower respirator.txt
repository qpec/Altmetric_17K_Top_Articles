uman rhinoviruses are the most common respiratory viruses
detected in patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation.
Although rhinovirus appears to occasionally cause severe lower
respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised patients, the clinical
significance of rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract remains
unknown. We evaluated 697 recipients transplanted between 1993 and
2015 with rhinovirus in respiratory samples. As comparative cohorts, 273
recipients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory
syncytial virus (N=117), parainfluenza virus (N=120), or influenza (N=36)
were analyzed. Factors associated with mortality were analyzed using
Cox proportional hazard models. Among 569 subjects with rhinovirus
upper respiratory tract infection and 128 subjects with rhinovirus lower
respiratory tract infection, probabilities of overall mortality at 90 days
were 6% and 41%, respectively (P<0.001). The survival rate after lower
respiratory tract infection was not affected by the presence of co-
pathogens (55% in patients with co-pathogens, 64% in patients without,
P=0.34). Low monocyte count (P=0.027), oxygen use (P=0.015), and
steroid dose greater than 1 mg/kg/day (P=0.003) before diagnosis were
significantly associated with mortality among patients with lower respi-
ratory tract infection in multivariable analysis. Mortality after rhinovirus
lower respiratory tract infection was similar to that after lower respiratory
tract infection by respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or
influenza in an adjusted model. In summary, transplant recipients with
rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract had high mortality rates
comparable to viral pneumonia associated with other well-established
respiratory viruses. Our data suggest rhinovirus can contribute to severe
pulmonary disease in immunocompromised hosts.

ABSTRACT
Introduction
Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of respiratory virus
infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.1-4
Although well documented cases suggested a possible role of HRV in severe dis-
ease,5 earlier cohort studies did not conclusively demonstrate the ability of HRV to

 cause lower respiratory tract disease, in part because of
the presence of co-pathogens as well as a lack of sensitive
molecular diagnostic techniques.6,7 With the widespread
adoption of multiplex molecular detection platforms, HRV
RNA is now detected frequently in the bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) fluid of immunocompromised patients
undergoing evaluation for pulmonary infiltrates.3,8,9
However, the significance of HRV RNA detection in the
lower respiratory tract remains poorly defined. 
In a recent large prospective study, detection of HRV in
the upper respiratory tract of hematopoietic cell transplan-
tation (HCT) candidates was associated with poor out-
come after HCT.4 Another study also suggested poor out-
comes in immunocompromised patients with HRV infec-
tion, comparable to those infected with 2009 H1N1
influenza.10 As for lower respiratory tract infection (LRI),
recent studies of community-acquired pneumonia in
immunocompetent patients identified HRV as the most
common 
pathogen 
using 
molecular 
diagnostic
techniques.1,11 HRV was also a key pathogen in immuno-
compromised patients originally diagnosed with idiopath-
ic pneumonia syndrome, and its detection in the lower
respiratory tract was associated with a particularly poor
outcome.12 Overall, these data suggest that HRV may be a
clinically significant pathogen with the potential to cause
serious pulmonary disease. The purpose of this study was
to determine the significance of detection of HRV RNA in
the BAL fluid in HCT recipients. 
Methods
Study design
This retrospective study includes patients who were transplant-
ed between 1993 and 2015 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center (FHCRC) and had virologically-confirmed HRV
infection following HCT at the University of Washington Virology
Laboratories.13 Only an individual’s first episode of HRV infection
was analyzed. HRV upper respiratory tract infection (URI) was
defined as HRV detection in a nasopharyngeal sample, and LRI
was defined as HRV detection in a BAL or lung biopsy sample.
Patients’ demographic data and transplant information closest to
the HRV infection were retrieved from the FHCRC database, and
other data related to the clinical course of HRV infections were col-
lected by medical chart review. As comparative cohorts, patients
with LRI caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluen-
za virus (PIV), or influenza virus were included in the analyses.14-16
The first episode of LRI by any of the 4 viruses was selected and
the cases with overlapped infections of the 4 viruses were exclud-
ed from the analyses. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at FHCRC.
Laboratory testing
Nasopharyngeal samples were collected when HCT recipients
had URI symptoms and a BAL sample was obtained when
patients had lower respiratory tract symptoms and a radiographic
abnormality. HRV detection was performed by conventional cul-
ture and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR) assay in respiratory samples. The culture was performed
using 3 different culture systems (rhesus monkey kidney cells
[RMK], adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells
[A549], and human foreskin fibroblast [HFF]), and BAL samples
were incubated for 10 days (an additional 11 days in HFFs culture)
at 37˚C. RT-PCR to detect HRV has been used routinely since 2007
in our center. RSV, PIV or influenza virus was detected by conven-
tional culture, direct fluorescent antibody tests and/or PCR. The
viral load of HRV was roughly estimated from the PCR cycle
threshold (Ct) value of the sample that provided the initial diagno-
sis of HRV LRI.17 
All biopsy or autopsy samples were inoculated in 3 different cell
lines as above and also tested for HRV using RT-PCR. In autopsy
samples, 2 curls from a frozen specimen of each side of lungs were
separately tested for HRV using RT-PCR.  
Statistical analysis
Patients’ demographic characteristics were summarized and
compared between URI and LRI or among LRI with different
viruses (HRV, RSV, PIV, and Influenza virus) using chi-square or
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum
test for continuous variables (as appropriate). The probability of
overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
The probability of mortality after HRV URI was estimated by
cumulative incidence curves, treating progression to LRI as a com-
peting risk. The probability of mortality from respiratory failure
was estimated by cumulative incidence curves, treating death due
to other causes as a competing risk. The log-rank test was used to
compare hazards of time-to-event outcomes among patients’ char-
acteristics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evalu-

 Results
Patient characteristics
There were 697 patients diagnosed with HRV infection
between 1993 and 2015; 569 (82%) and 128 (18%) had
URI alone and LRI, respectively. Characteristics of each
group are shown in Table 1. More than 80% of the HRV
cases were diagnosed in and after 2007, reflecting the ini-
tiation of routine use of PCR to detect HRV. The median
time to HRV URI and LRI following HCT was 74 days
(range, 0 to 7063 days) and 87 days (range, 0 to 4309 days),
respectively. Approximately half of patients with HRV LRI
had co-pathogens at diagnosis, such as Aspergillus (N=11;
including 5 cases positive by galactomannan alone) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=5) considered to be non-viral
co-pathogens, and RSV (N=3), PIV (N=3) and adenovirus
(N=3) as viral co-pathogens. 
Mortality after HRV infection and risk factors
There were 52 patients who died within 90 days after
the onset of LRI. Forty-one patients (79%) died from pul-
monary failure, and 5, 4 and 2 died from organ dysfunc-
tion, disease relapse and acute graft versus host disease
(GvHD), respectively. The probabilities of overall mortali-
ty at 90 days following HRV diagnosis in patients with
URI or LRI are shown in Figure 1A (6% in URI and 41%

 in LRI, P<0.001). The probabilities of 90-day survival after
HRV LRI were 55% and 64% in patients with and without
co-pathogens, respectively (P=0.34) (Figure 1B). 
In a multivariable analysis of risk factors for overall mor-
tality, low monocyte count, oxygen requirement at diagno-
sis, and steroid dose greater than 1 mg/kg/day before diag-
nosis were significantly associated with higher mortality.
In the analysis of risk factors for mortality from respiratory
failure, only low monocyte count at diagnosis and steroid
use ≥1 mg/kg/day before diagnosis were significant factors
in multivariable models (Table 2). Steroid use after diagno-
sis was also a significantly important factor (overall mortal-
ity: HR, 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-4.69;
P=0.003, mortality from respiratory failure: HR, 2.77; 95%

allogeneic transplantation did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (overall mortality: HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 0.76-5.81;
P=0.16, mortality from respiratory failure: HR, 2.18; 95%
CI, 0.67-7.06; P=0.19). To examine a more homogeneous
cohort, we analyzed a cohort restricted to cases with allo-
geneic transplantation after 2007 and HRV infections with-
in 2 years after HCT (Table 3). Oxygen requirement at
diagnosis and steroid dose greater than 1 mg/kg/day before
diagnosis were important factors for mortality (Table 4).   
The HRV PCR Ct value of the BAL sample obtained at
diagnosis was not significantly associated with mortality
after HRV LRI (Tables 2 and 4). There were 20 cases with

 Detection of HRV in tissue samples
To investigate whether HRV could be potentially
responsible for lower respiratory tract disease or subse-
quent death, we examined the biopsy and/or autopsy
samples for HRV using conventional culture and the RT-
PCR assay. Of 15 biopsies performed at LRI diagnosis and
7 after diagnosis, 15 (100%) and 6 (86%), respectively,
were HRV positive by RT-PCR; 2 (13%) and 4 (57%),
respectively, were HRV positive by culture. 
Among 128 patients with HRV LRI, 52 died within 90
days after onset of HRV LRI. Among them, 12 patients
underwent autopsy (median days between LRI diagnosis
and autopsy, 10 days; range, 2 to 67 days) and HRV was
detected in 6 samples by RT-PCR. Both samples obtained
from right and left lungs were positive in 5 of 6 positive
cases. No samples were positive by culture.
Mortality comparison with LRI due to other respiratory
viruses 
We compared mortality after HRV LRI with that after
LRI caused by RSV (N=117), PIV (N=120), or influenza
virus (N=36). Patients’ characteristics are shown in Table
3. We observed differences among the various virus
cohorts with regard to time of onset after transplantation,
cell source, and oxygen requirements at diagnosis.         
Overall survival by 90 days among groups without co-
pathogens were similar (P=0.62 in Figure 2A). Since oxy-
gen requirement at diagnosis is an important risk factor for
mortality and is a reflection of the degree of lung injury,
we analyzed survival by oxygen requirement. As shown
in Figure 2B and 2C, the 4 groups of patients with respira-
tory viral LRI were comparable in overall survival (P=0.76
in Figure 2B, P=0.95 in Figure 2C). 
To confirm that mortality after HRV LRI is similar to that
after RSV, PIV or influenza virus, we performed a multi-
variable analysis among the 388 total patients (Table 5). In
an adjusted model, mortality in HRV LRI remained similar
to that after LRI by other respiratory viruses (Table 6).
Discussion
The study herein showed that patients who have HRV
detected in the lower respiratory tract have similar out-
comes to patients with LRI due to known pathogenic
viruses such as RSV, PIV and influenza virus, even after
excluding other potential bacterial, fungal and viral co-
pathogens. Although the detection of HRV RNA by RT-
PCR is not proof of ongoing viral replication, we were also
able to detect replicating virus from the lung tissue of a
subset of patients with a fatal outcome, thus demonstrat-
ing that these viruses were viable and potentially respon-
sible for the pulmonary disease in these patients.
To prove a pathogen-disease association for a pathogen
that is difficult to cultivate,18 especially in the molecular
era, is difficult, as Koch’s postulates or other assessments
of direct viral injury cannot be easily applied despite the
detection of viral nucleic acid. We employed multiple
strategies to examine the plausibility of HRV as a signifi-
cant pathogen, including: (i) a comparison of mortality in
patients with HRV detection in the upper and lower respi-
ratory tract, (ii) a comparison between patients with and
without co-pathogens in outcome after HRV LRI, (iii) an
evaluation of factors associated with death following HRV
detection in BAL samples, (iv) a comparison of mortality
with respiratory viruses of well-established pathogenicity,
and (v) tissue detection of the virus.
Our primary comparison was between patients with
HRV URI and those with HRV detection in the BAL
(Figure 1A). While the comparison of mortality after URI
and LRI alone is not conclusive evidence for a causative
effect of HRV for LRI, the two curves are significantly dif-

 ferent, and in addition, look remarkably similar to curves
previously documented for other respiratory viruses, such
as PIV, in HCT recipients.15 Second, the fact that mortality
in patients with or without co-pathogens is similar could
suggest that HRV by itself is a cause of LRI, because oth-
erwise one would expect the outcome to be improved in
patients without co-pathogens. Next, factors associated
with mortality following HRV BAL positivity were similar
to those for other respiratory viruses (RSV, PIV, HMPV,
influenza viruses) reported by our group and others,14-16,19-23
and included oxygen use, cytopenias, and high-dose corti-
costeroid use (Tables 2 and 4). An important analysis was
the comparison of the outcome of HRV LRI with other
well-established viral pneumonias. We used 3 previously
described cohorts14-16 and analyzed overall mortality in a
multivariable Cox model that adjusted for key factors that
are associated with poor outcome. There was no differ-
ence in mortality after LRI between HRV and the other 3
viruses, even after adjusting for several important factors,
such as the presence of co-pathogens and oxygen use at
the time of diagnosis (Table 6, Figure 2), providing strong
evidence that HRV detection in the BAL is indeed a clini-

 cally significant finding. Although the Cox model adjusted
for oxygen use, we performed a subset analysis of patients
who presented without oxygen use (Figure 2B). This
group likely had minimal or no acute lung injury at the
time of diagnosis and the subsequent outcome in these
patients was more likely to be associated with the viral
insult rather than the inflammatory changes associated
with acute lung injury. Although mortality was, as expect-
ed, lower in this group, mortality rates approaching 20%
by 3 months after diagnosis were documented, indicating
an important negative impact on survival. Importantly,
there were no apparent differences in LRI outcomes
between HRV and RSV, PIV or influenza virus.
We also examined virologic factors to evaluate the role
of HRV in lung disease. Tissue documentation of a
pathogen is considered a key factor supporting a patho-
genic role of an infectious agent.24,25 Although we were
limited by the small number of tissue samples from lung
biopsies and autopsies in our cohort, we were able to cul-
ture HRV from lung biopsies in 6 of 22 patients who had

 cultures performed. This is a remarkable result because
our culture system is not optimized for HRV recovery
(which in general is improved by incubation at lower tem-
peratures and other methods, such as roller flasks, as used
in previous papers),7 and suggests a high viral load may
have been present. Since viral culture positivity from biop-
sy material is generally considered to indicate invasive
viral disease for other respiratory viruses and
cytomegalovirus (CMV),24,26,27 we consider this finding to
be highly significant. We also detected HRV RNA by PCR
in archived frozen tissue from lung biopsies and autopsy
samples. The HRV PCR Ct values of the BAL samples,
which provide a rough estimate of the HRV viral load,
were not associated with mortality in our cohort (Tables 2
and 4). The lack of association does not rule out a patho-
genic role of HRV, since studies with other well-estab-
lished pathogens such as CMV, RSV, and PIV also failed to
demonstrate an association of viral load in the BAL with
mortality.12,15,28,29 Methodologic issues may be responsible
for these results, including the inability to account for BAL
dilution and the potentially differential amplification effi-
ciency of different HRV serotypes.30 Additional studies are
needed to conclusively study the role of the viral load in
the BAL for HRV and other viruses.
The study herein has both strengths and limitations. We
examined a large number of cases of HRV RNA positive
BALs and comparative cases with other viral lower respi-
ratory diseases which allowed us to perform appropriate
statistical analyses that carefully accounted for co-
pathogens and stages of acute lung injury. Our study was
not restricted to specific transplant types or time periods
after HCT, however, a subgroup analysis of recent allo-
geneic transplant recipients showed similar results. Due to
a lack of specific information about the severity of GvHD
in some cases, the association between mortality after
HRV LRI and GvHD remains unclear, although we used
steroid dose as a surrogate marker for GvHD severity. Our
largely unbiased approach of evaluating patients with pul-
monary infiltrates by bronchoscopy and BAL and the
availability of lung tissue are additional strengths.
According to previous reports, approximately 30% of
HRV URI cases were asymptomatic4 and 5% of BAL sam-
ples from asymptomatic HCT recipients included HRV
LRI;12 we therefore think that asymptomatic lower respi-
ratory tract infection is only a minor factor in the present
study. Other limitations include the lack of tissue
immunohistochemical studies and the lack of direct viral
quantitation, as well as our inability to adequately culture
for HRV in autopsy or biopsy specimens. Currently avail-
able antibodies for HRV are serotype-specific.31 Because
we did not identify the HRV serotypes in our tissue sam-
ples, we could not perform immunohistochemistry to
confirm tissue detection of HRV. Furthermore, we
acknowledge that certain HRV strains (particularly HRV-C
viruses) may not have been identified earlier in this study
and would be unlikely to be successfully cultivated. Thus,
infections with HRV-C might be underrepresented in the
patients prior to 2008.
In conclusion, we provide further evidence that HRV is a
serious pathogen in the lower respiratory tract of HCT
recipients. This conclusion is supported by similar out-
comes of patients with HRV in the BAL compared to those
with well-established respiratory pathogens such as RSV
and influenza virus and by the presence of HRV in lung tis-
sue. The data are also consistent with the recent literature
on HRV in other clinical settings, which supports a potential
causal role in serious clinical disease,1 and agree with earlier
studies in HCT recipients carried out prior to the use of
molecular diagnostic techniques.6,7 However, while these
data are supportive of a pathogenic role of HRV, ultimate
proof could best be provided by randomized placebo-con-
trolled trials. These data provide the rationale for the rapid
development and clinical evaluation of new therapeutics.
