Abstract
Background: Non-drinking among young people has increased over the past decade in England, yet the
underlying factor driving this change is unknown. Traditionally non-drinking has been found to be associated with
lower socio-economic status and poorer health. This study explores among which sub-groups non-drinking has
increased, and how this correlates with changes in drinking patterns, to identify whether behaviours are becoming
more polarised, or reduction is widespread among young people.
Methods: Among participants aged 16 to 24 years (N = 9699), within the annual cross-sectional nationally-
representative Health Survey for England 2005–2015 datasets, the following analyses were conducted: 1) The
proportion of non-drinkers among social-demographic and health sub-groups by year, and tests for linear trends
among sub-groups, adjusting for age were calculated. In pooled analyses, an interaction between year and each
variable was modelled in sex- and age-adjusted logistic regression models on the odds of being a non-drinker
versus drinker 2) At the population level, spearman correlation co-efficients were calculated between the proportion
non-drinking and the mean alcohol units consumed and binge drinking on the heaviest drinking day, by year.
Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used, modelling the proportion non-drinking as the independent
variable, and the mean units/binge drinking as the dependent variable.
Results: Rates of non-drinking increased from 18% (95%CI 16–22%) in 2005 to 29% (25–33%) in 2015 (test for trend;
p < 0.001), largely attributable to increases in lifetime abstention. Not drinking in the past week increased from 35%
(32–39%) to 50% (45–55%) (p < 0.001). Significant linear increases in non-drinking were found among most sub-
groups including healthier sub-groups (non-smokers, those with high physical activity and good mental health),
white ethnicity, north and south regions, in full-time education, and employed. No significant increases in non-
drinking were found among smokers, ethnic minorities and those with poor mental health. At the population-level,
significant negative correlations were found between increases in non-drinking and declines in the mean units
consumed (ρ = − 0.85, p < 0.001), and binge drinking (ρ = − 0.87, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Increases in non-drinking among young people has coincided with a delayed initiation into alcohol
consumption, and are to be welcomed. Future research should explore attitudes towards drinking among young people.

 Background
Abstention from alcohol or ‘non-drinking’ has risen in
Great Britain. Around 10%
classified themselves as
non-drinkers in 1998, increasing to 15% in 2009 [1], with
a further increase to 21% in 2013 [2]. The increase has
been the greatest among young adults. The proportion of
non-drinkers (including those who had not had a drink in
the past year) among those aged 16–24 doubled from 12%
in 2011 to 24% in 2014 in England [3]. This phenomenon
among young people has received much media attention,
with some referring to it as “The Rise of the Teetotal gener-
ation” [4]. Whilst the media has speculated on the causes,
such as greater health concerns, to our knowledge this has
not been investigated formally.
Research has established a social gradient in non-drinking.
Non-drinkers are more likely to have lower education, lower
income, live in the most deprived areas, and be unemployed
compared with those who drink alcohol in moderate
amounts [5–9]. Furthermore, poor health being a reason for
abstaining are well established [9–13]. However, it is possible
that increases in abstention may be due to health promoting
reasons, encouraged by health promoting campaigns such
as ‘Dry January’ [14], and the emerging evidence of the link
between any alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer
[15], and obesity [16]. A recent study on mental wellbeing
found that being a non-drinker was associated with in-
creased chances of both high and low mental wellbeing (ver-
sus medium wellbeing), compared with being a moderate
drinker
[17],
suggesting
that
non-drinkers
may
have
polarised characteristics in terms of health.
The aim of this research is to identify whether in-
creases in non-drinking have occurred among factors
commonly associated with non-drinking such as low
socio-economic
position
and
poorer
health,
versus
non-traditional factors such as among healthier groups
or higher social status. Drinking habits are defined from
an early age which can impact health later on in life
[18], so it is important to understand how drinking be-
haviours are changing among this age-group. Another
aim
of
this
work
is
to
identify
how
changes
in
non-drinking among young people has accompanied
changing drinking patterns overall, for example whether
behaviour is becoming more polarised between none
and heavy drinking, which could be problematic.
Research questions
In our study, we address the following research questions,
among 16–24 year olds in England, from 2005 to 2015:
1. How has non-drinking increased? Is this pattern ob-
served for the different types of non-drinkers; life-
time abstainers, ex-drinkers, occasional drinkers? In
addition, for periodic abstinence (those who abstain
in the previous week)?
2. Among which social/demographic and health
subgroups has non-drinking increased?
3. In multivariable analyses, have the chances of being
a non-drinker increased more strongly for any par-
ticular sub-group over-time?
4. How do changes in the proportion of non-drinking
over time, correlate with changes in mean con-
sumption, and heavy episodic drinking over time?
Methods
Study design and participants
This study uses the Health Survey for England (HSE) 2005
to 2015, accessed via he UK Data Service, subject to their
end user license [19]. The Health Survey for England is a
nationally-representative annual cross-sectional survey of
the population living in private households in England [19].
Participants were selected using multi-stage stratified-sam-
pling; selecting participants within primary sampling unit
(PSUs). Household response rates declined somewhat over
the period, ranging from 74% in 2005 to 60% in 2015 [20].
Non-response weights have been calculated and were in-
cluded in the datasets. Ethical approval for the HSE was ob-
tained ahead of the data collection from the relevant ethics
committee [21], data was anonymised and further ethical
approval was not needed. In our study, the sample was lim-
ited to the participants aged 16 to 24 years, who answered
questions about drinking status (N = 9699) in surveys be-
tween 2005 and 2015. Non-response to the drinking status
question accounted for 1.5% of all 16 to 24-year olds. Infor-
mation was collected via trained interviewers who adminis-
tered the interview face-to-face in participants’ households
using CAPI and a self-completion booklet.
Variables
Non-drinking
Non-drinkers were defined as participants who reported
‘no’ to the question on drinking status: “Do you ever drink
alcohol nowadays, including drinks you brew or make at
home?” Lifetime abstainers; non-drinkers who reported
they had always been a non-drinker, and former drinkers;
non-drinkers who reported they had not always been a
non-drinker, were derived from a follow-up question spe-
cific to non-drinkers.. Non-drinkers were also asked if
they drank occasionally, who we refer to as ‘occasional
drinkers’. Non-drinkers have been found to be a heteroge-
neous group, consisting of lifetime abstainers, former
drinkers and occasional drinkers [22]. In addition, to explore
periodic abstinences, we also examined changes in the
prevalence of not having an alcoholic drink in the past week.
Drinking patterns
Drinking patterns were identified based on alcohol units
drank on the heaviest drinking day in the past week.
These questions were asked consistently across the
Ng Fat et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1090

 survey years between 2005 and 2015. A category for
drinkers, drinking alcohol within limits at the time of
the survey (not exceeding 4 units for men, and 3 units
for women on any day [23]) were created. Binge drink-
ing was defined as drinking twice the recommended
daily limits on the heaviest drinking day.
Social and demographic variables
The following variables were considered as sub-groups;
sex, broad ethnicity (white/non-white), full-time educa-
tion versus not in full-time education, north and south
regions of England, area-deprivation, measured by the
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) in quintiles dichot-
omised (three least deprived versus two most deprived
area), urban location (urban/town/village), household
level
national-statistics
socio-economic
classification
(NS-SEC) (managerial professional/intermediate/routine
manual) and individual employment status (employed/
non-employed).
Health and health behaviours
Positive health behaviours and health statuses were consid-
ered including non-smokers (versus smokers), eating five or
more portions of fruit and vegetable a day (versus 3–4 or
0–2 portions), high physical activity (versus medium or low
level), and up to normal Body Mass Index (BMI) category
(underweight/normal (up to 24.9 kg/m2), overweight or
over (25 kg/m2 or over). Apart from objectively collected
data on BMI, all information was self-reported. Physical ac-
tivity was measured using the short-form International
Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [24], which has
been asked annually since 2013. Questions on fruit and
vegetable consumption were not asked in 2012 and 2014;
all
other
years
were
presented.
The
proportion
of
non-drinkers among those with no longstanding illness
(versus those with a longstanding illness or limiting long-
standing illness) were also explored. Mental health and
wellbeing was measured through the 12 item General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the Warwick-Edinb
urgh Mental Wellbeing scale (WEMWBS), respectively.
Total GHQ-12 scores were calculated by assigning values
of 0 if symptoms were not present, or 1 if symptoms were
present on each of the 12 items, and summing scores on
the items together (maximum score 12). We dichotomised
total GHQ-12 scores into zero (no evidence of mental ill-
ness), or 1 or more (less than optimal mental health includ-
ing probable mental ill health) [25]. GHQ-12 scores were
not collected in 2007, 2011, 2013 and 2015. Participants
with total scores on the 14-item WEMWBS with five re-
sponse categories (scored zero to five), ranging from 14 to
70 were dichotomised. Participants with scores one stand-
ard deviation below the mean were categorised as having
low mental wellbeing (14–42), versus above one standard
deviation from the mean (mid to high wellbeing; 43 or
higher) [17]. Questions from the WEMWBS scale have
been asked annually since 2010. The GHQ-12 and
WEMWBS were administered via a self-completion book-
let, which has a higher non-response rate.
Statistical analyses
All
analyses
applied
complex
survey
design
and
non-response weighting. The proportion of non-drinkers
among the population and corresponding confidence inter-
vals were calculated for each year from 2005 to 2015. Signifi-
cant differences were highlighted when proportions differed
from the 2005 start year. Tests for linear trends in the level
of non-drinking over time, were examined for each
sub-group using regression analyses, modelling year as an
independent variable and non-drinking as the dependent
variable and adjusting for age. Trends were illustrated in
charts using three-year moving averages. The same analyses
were repeated among different social-demographic and
health sub-groups. Information for variables with missing
year’s data, were modelled as consecutive years, observing
whether a significant linear increase was found among the
years that data was collected.
In pooled analyses of all datasets, we examined whether
the chances of being a non-drinker increased greater by
year for certain sub-groups, by conducting logistic regres-
sion on the odds of being a non-drinker versus drinker,
modelling an interaction effect between each sub-group
and year, adjusting for age and sex. These analyses were
limited to variables that had information on all years; urban
area, IMD, educational, employment, household social
class, smoking status, limiting longstanding illness statuses
which was dichotomised (BMI was not included due to a
relatively high proportion of missing BMI measurements
(14%)). In preliminary analyses, the interaction effect be-
tween broad ethnic groups (white vs. non-white) and year
was significant (OR = 1.06 (95%CI 1.01–1.11) p = 0.03), sug-
gesting that the odds of being a non-drinker have increased
faster for the white than non-white population. However, in
models there were large effect sizes, due to sparse data
problems [26]. Therefore we limited these logistic regres-
sion models to white-participants only (N = 7934).
We examined whether increases in non-drinking were re-
lated to changes in drinking patterns among young people
by undertaking ecological analyses. Spearman correlation
co-efficient were calculated between the proportion of
non-drinkers by year and the proportion binge drinking,
and mean units consumed on the heaviest drinking day.
Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to test
the strength and direction of the relationship between the
proportion non-drinking (independent variable) and the
proportion binge/mean units (dependent variable), over
time. The relationship is illustrated using scatter diagrams.
As a sensitivity analyses we also examined the relationship
between the proportion of non-drinkers and the proportion

 binge drinking and mean units consumed on the heaviest
drinking among drinkers only, which does not include the
numbers of non-drinkers in its calculation.
Results
Descriptive trend analyses
Among those aged 16 to 24 years, the proportion of
non-drinkers increased from 18% (95% CI 16–22%) in
2005 to 29% in 2015 (CI 25–33%) (test for linear trend
p < 0.001, Table 1, see Additional file 1: Table S1 for con-
fidence intervals)). The increase was largely attributable
to an increase in the proportion of lifetime abstainers
(9% (CI 7–11% to 17% (CI 13–21%, p < 0.001), rather
than ex-drinkers (2% (CI 1–3%) to 2% (CI 1–4%), p =
0.371). There were also increases in the proportion
whom had not drunk any alcohol in the last week, from
35% (CI 32–40%) in 2005 to 50% (CI 45–55%) in 2015
(p < 0.001), and from 22% (CI 19–26%) to 33% (CI 28–
37%) among drinkers only (p < 0.001). There were sig-
nificant decreases in the proportion who drank above
limits (43% (CI 38–47% to 28% (CI 24–32%), p < 0.01),
or binge drank (27% (CI 23–31%) to 18% (15–22%), p <
0.001) but no differences in the proportion drinking
within limits (22–22%. p = 0.258). These trends have
been depicted as three-year moving averages in Fig. 1.
Sub-groups analyses
Examining the level of non-drinking by social and demo-
graphic sub-groups (Table 2, see Additional file 1: Table
S2 for confidence intervals), linear increases in the
prevalence of non-drinking by year from 2005 to 2015
were found among males, females, those aged 16–17,
18–24 years, white ethnicity, in full-time education and
those living in urban, town/villages, north and southern
regions of England, areas along the five deprivation
quintiles, among those employed and non-employed,
and all household level occupational groups (Table 2) (p
< 0.05). In 2005, just over a quarter, 28% (CI 22–35%) of
16 to 17 year olds were a non-drinker, by 2015 this had
increased to just under a half (48%, CI 39–56%). Like-
wise the proportion of non-drinkers increased among 18
to 24 years olds from 15% in 2005 (CI 12–18%) to 24%
(CI 20–29%) in 2015. Among the white population,
non-drinking increased from 14% (12–17%) in 2005 to
20% (17–24%) in 2015. The proportion of non-drinkers
among the employed doubled from 2005 (9%, CI 7–13%)
to 2015 (18%, CI32–45%). No significant increases were
found among non-white minorities (p = 0.421).
Examining the level of non-drinking by health behaviours
(Tables 3, 95% CI (Additional file 1: Table S3); linear in-
creases in non-drinking were found among non-smokers,
those with normal weight, and those eating three to four
portions of fruit and vegetables per day (p < 0.001). In 2005,
23% (CI 19–28%) of non-smokers were non-drinkers by
2015, this had risen to 34% (CI 29–39%). Among those eat-
ing three to four portions of fruit and vegetables, the pro-
portion of non-drinkers increased by 91%, from 2005 (17%
(CI 13–22%) to 2015 (32% (CI 25–40%). Linear increases in
the proportion of non-drinkers were also found among
those classified as overweight or above (BMI ≥ 25), and
those eating none to two proportions of fruit and vegetables
a day (p < 0.001). There were no statistical significant
increases in the proportion of non-drinkers among
smokers (p = 0.083), and those consuming more than
five fruit or vegetables per day (p = 0.084). From
2013 to 2015, there was a linear increase in the pro-
portion
of
non-drinkers
among
those
with
high
physical activity levels (p = 0.039), but no significant

 increase was found for those with low to medium
physical activity.
Examining the level of non-drinking by health; a linear in-
crease in non-drinking was found among those with a long-
standing illness (18% (CI 14–21%) in 2005 to 30% (CI 25–
35%) in 2015) as well as without a longstanding illness (13%
(CI 8–20%) in 2007 to 30% (CI 22–38%) in 2014) (p < 0.05).
A linear increase in non-drinking was also found
among those with normal GHQ score of zero (no evi-
dence of mental ill health), and mid-to-high mental
wellbeing (p < 0.001), but not for those with low men-
tal wellbeing (p = 0.237) or less than optimal mental
health (GHQ score ≥ 1) p = 0.258.Among those with
normal GHQ scores, the proportion of non-drinkers
increased from 20% (CI 17–25%) in 2005 to 37%
(31–43%) in 2014.
Interaction between year and sub-groups in pooled
regression analyses
Limiting to white participants only, for every year increase,
the odds of being a non-drinker versus drinker increased
by 7% (OR = 1.07 95% Confidence interval 1.04–1.09),
after adjusting for all variables. There were no significant
interactions between year and any of the variables, after
adjusting for age and sex (Additional file 1: Table S4).
Ecological analyses among the population; correlations
between non-drinking and heavy episodic drinking/mean
units
Correlations between the proportion of non-drinkers by
year, and the mean units of alcohol consumed on the heavi-
est drinking day, and proportion binge drinking was nega-
tive (mean units ρ = − 0.85, binge ρ = − 0.87, p < 0.001,
Table 4). Interpreting the regression co-efficient; a one per-
centage point increase in non-drinking among 16 to 24 year
olds, predicted a 0.22 reduction in mean units consumed
on the heaviest drinking day (95% CI -0.32—0.12), and a
1.06 percentage point decrease in proportion binge drink-
ing (95%CI 1.56—0.54) in the total population. The
co-efficient did not change dramatically when using mean
units and proportions binge drinking limited to drinkers
only (− 0.20 unit reduction (− 0.34—0.07), − 1.00 percent-
age point reduction (95%CI -1.68- -0.31). The direction of
the association is illustrated Fig. 2.
Discussion
Identifying as a non-drinker has increased among young
people, mainly attributable to fewer younger people tak-
ing up drinking, shown by the rate of lifetime abstainers
almost doubling from 9% in 2005 to 17% in 2015. In
addition more drinkers were engaging in weekly abstin-
ence. In 2005, just over a third of those aged 16 to 24
did not have a drink in the past week, compared with a
half in 2015. Previous research has identified stigma as-
sociated with non-drinking [27]. However, non-drinking
appears to have increased across almost all sub-groups, in-
cluding healthy groups (non-smokers, high physical activ-
ity and good mental health), the white population, those
in employment or full-time education, across household
NS-SEC group and among all levels of area-deprivation,
and both northern and southern regions. Whilst tradition-
ally poorer health and lower socio-economic status has
been associated with non-drinking [9, 28], this might sug-
gest that the norms around non-drinking are changing,
and this behaviour is becoming more mainstream among
young people. Furthermore, no increasing trends in
non-drinking were found among variables commonly as-
sociated with non-drinking, such as among ethnic minor-
ities, and those with poorer mental health [9, 28]. We
cannot know the reasons for why non-drinking has

 remained stable among ethnic minorities. Non-drinking
remains higher among ethnic minorities than the white
population.
Increasing rates of non-drinking among young people
are to be welcomed. Instead of behaviours becoming
polarised between extremes such as binge drinking and
abstinence, increases in non-drinking were correlated
with a decline in mean units of alcohol consumed, and
the proportion binge drinking. This is consistent with
population theories, including Skog’s the collectivity of
drinking cultures [29, 30], which suggests that it is the
average drinker which influences heavy and problematic
drinking [29, 31–34]. More young people not drinking
may influence lower average consumption overall, which
tends to reduce problematic drinking.
Declines in alcohol consumption among young people
have been found across other high income countries, in-
cluding within North America and Europe [34, 35],
although in Canada rates of binge drinking increased
from 1996 to 2013 [36]. It is difficult to pinpoint a single
factor that has caused the decline in alcohol consump-
tion. Policies in England coinciding with declines includ-
ing tougher and stricter licensing laws on the sales of
alcohol to those aged under 18 years, which is illegal
[37]. In 2005 three in ten 16 to 17 year olds reported be-
ing a non-drinker increasing to nearly one in two in

 2015. Much of the increase has come from young people
not taking up alcohol at all, indicating that initiation into
alcohol has been delayed. Around 39% of those aged
11–13 never had an alcohol drink in 2003, compared
with 48% in 2010 [38]. Among a cohort of 10 to 15 year
olds, happiness and awareness of alcohol-harm was asso-
ciated with not being initiated into alcohol use [39].
Increasing awareness of the harms of alcohol may have
played an important role in decreasing alcohol con-
sumption among young people and the general popula-
tion [3]. Indeed this would correlate well with the
increase in non-drinking among healthier sub-groups,
although

 proportions of fruit and vegetables a day), suggesting
that there may be other factors underpinning the in-
crease in non-drinking.
The non-significant associations between year and so-
cial and health variables, suggests that the increase is
not attributable to any one factor, and the causes are
likely to be multi-factorial or cultural. There were factors
not explored in this study such as media use, which
might be changing the way young people spend their
leisure time. Further qualitative research is required to
analyse attitudes towards drinking among young people
and how they may have changed, including changes in
life priorities and parental supervision in relation to al-
cohol
use.
The
relationship
between
increases
in
non-drinking among students and the employed may be
due to increased work stress or pressure, however we
cannot know this from this data, further we did not find
increases in non-drinking among those with poor mental
health or wellbeing. This needs to be investigated fur-
ther. Factors influencing the shift away from drinking
(and subsequently problematic drinking), could be capi-
talised on to ensure that sensible drinking continues to
be encouraged. Whilst rates are falling, young people re-
main the most likely group to be binge drinking [3].
Heavy
episodic
drinking
increases
the
risk
of
alcohol-related harm, such as crime and accident and
emergency attendance, which places considerable bur-
den on the National Health Service [40, 41]. Rates have
been falling from a very high level, where a third of
young people were found to be binge drinking in 2002
and 2007 [3]. Efforts to reduce problematic drinking
should
not
be
ignored.
Furthermore,
rates
of
non-drinking have not increased among smokers, sug-
gesting that these risky behaviours continue to cluster
[42, 43], and there may be subsets of young people with
very unhealthy behaviour. Alcohol or cigarette consump-
tion are likely to be gateways into each other [44]. Tar-
geting these behaviours in tandem, could have positive
implications for public health overall.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include the use of a large nation-
ally representative sample and the ability to explore
trends across a range of social, health and demographic
factors.
Limitations
include
having
only
years
as
time-points, meaning the inability to explore trends
using more sophisticated time-series analyses with more
time-points. Secondly there were small samples sizes
within groups such as ethnicity meaning the inability to
explore interaction effects of this variable in detail, and
only 3 years data on physical activity, and years when
questions on mental health or wellbeing were not asked.
Given the wide confidence intervals due to limiting the
data to people aged 16 to 24 years, we refrained from
interpreting trends in too much detail. Future years’ data
will be needed to verify whether trends are increasing or
plateauing. Thirdly, correlation does not necessarily
mean causation, and further investigation is needed to

 explore whether common factors are related to wide-
spread decline in drinking among young people. Never-
theless, the use of repeated-cross sectional nationally
representative data over the past decade, and the ability
to explore drinking patterns and broad trends within
sub-groups, has made important contributions to this
new area of research.
Conclusions
Increases in non-drinking were found across sub-groups,
including
groups
less
commonly
associated
with
non-drinking. This suggests that this behaviour maybe
becoming
more
acceptable
among
young
people,
whereas risky behaviours such as binge drinking may be
less normalised; both trends are to be welcomed from a
public-health standpoint and should be capitalised on
going forward. Smoking and drinking behaviours con-
tinue to cluster among young people. Future research
should explore attitudes towards drinking and not drink-
ing alcohol among young people.
