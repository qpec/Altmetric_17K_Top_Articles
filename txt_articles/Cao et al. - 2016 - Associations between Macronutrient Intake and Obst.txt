Abstract: Background: macronutrient intake has been found to affect sleep parameters including
obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in experimental studies, but there is uncertainty at the population
level in adults. Methods: cross-sectional analysis was conducted of participants in the Men Androgen
Inflammation Lifestyle Environment and Stress cohort (n = 784, age 35–80 years). Dietary intake was
measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported poor sleep quality and daytime
sleepiness were measured by questionnaires. Overnight in-home polysomnography (PSG) was
conducted among participants with without previously diagnosed OSA. Results: after adjusting for
demographic, lifestyle factors, and chronic diseases, the highest quartile of fat intake was positively
associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10, 2.89) and
apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) ě20, (RRR = 2.98, 95% CI 1.20–7.38). Body mass index mediated the
association between fat intake and AHI (30%), but not daytime sleepiness. There were no associations
between other intake of macronutrient and sleep outcomes. Conclusion: high fat is associated with
daytime sleepiness and AHI. Sleep outcomes are generally not assessed in studies investigating the
effects of varying macronutrient diets on weight loss. The current result highlights the potential
public health significance of doing so.

1. Introduction
A body of evidence has shown the associations between macronutrient intake and sleep
parameters, however, with inconsistency. Carbohydrate, particularly with high glycaemic index
(GI) was associated with faster sleep onset in healthy young men [1] but was associated with increased
total arousal in children compared with low GI [2]. Low intake of protein (<16% vs. ě16%) has been
shown to be associated with difficulty in initiating sleep, but high intake of protein (ě19% vs. <19%)
has been shown to be associated with difficulty maintaining sleep in middle-aged Japanese workers [3].
A fatty meal was found to aggravate apnoea in patients (overweight or obese) with obstructive sleep
apnoea (OSA) [4]. A newly published randomized-crossover study by St-Onge’s group found that low
fibre and high saturated fat and sugar intake was associated with lighter sleep with more arousals in
young and middle-aged healthy adults [5]. However, other studies suggested no association between

fat intake and sleep quality [6] or insomnia symptoms [3]. Although the inconsistent results may
be attributed to a variety of study designs, uncertainty remains regarding the association between
macronutrient intake and sleep in the current literature.
Studies that investigate the associations between macronutrient intakes and sleep parameters
(objective measurements) at the population level in the community setting are desired. One study in
Caucasian and Hispanic adolescents (n = 319) found that total fat intake was negatively associated
in girls but positively associated in boys with rapid eye movement sleep [7]. However, there are no
similar studies in adults. In this study, we aimed to assess whether macronutrient intake was associated
with Apnoea-hypopnea Index (AHI) and self-reported sleep symptoms in community-dwelling
middle-aged men at the population level under non-experimental conditions.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Population
The Men Androgen Inflammation Lifestyle Environment and Stress (MAILES) cohort study was
established in 2009, to investigate cardio metabolic disease risk factors in relation to sex steroids,
inflammation, environmental and psychosocial factors in men. A detailed cohort profile has been
published previously [8]. Briefly, the study population consists of 2563 community dwelling men
aged 35–80 years at baseline (MAILES stage 1) from the harmonisation of two population cohort
studies: all participants from the Florey Adelaide Male Ageing Study (FAMAS) (2002–2005) [9] and
eligible male participants from the North West Adelaide Health Study (NWHAS) (2004–2006) [10].
The MAILES stage 2 (2007–2010) was an approximate five-year follow-up consisting of a Computer
Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI), questionnaires and biomedical examinations. In total, 1815 men
completed the dietary intake during stage 2.
MAILES stage 3, conducted in August 2010, consisted of a CATI including sleep related questions
(n = 1629). The 184 who answered “yes” to the question “Have you ever been diagnosed with OSA
with a sleep study” were excluded from participating in the sleep sub-study, and the 1445 men who
answered “no” to the question were further asked if they were willing to participate in the sleep
study (75.2% agreed). Of these, a random sample of 1087 was chosen for inclusion. A total of 857
had home based PSG (Figure 1 [11]), and 837 of them had final valid measurements and became the
study population in this paper aimed at examining the association between macronutrient and AHI.
Self-selection bias was examined by comparing those who underwent a sleep study with those men
in the MAILES cohort who did not. Sleep study participants did not differ from non-participants in
daytime sleepiness, waking frequency and obesity level but they were younger, and more likely to
report frequent snoring and better general health [11]. Ethics approval was obtained from the Queens
Elizabeth Hospital Human Ethics Committee for the NWHAS study (number 2010054) and the Royal
Adelaide Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee for the FAMAS study (number 020305h).
2.2. Macronutrient Intake Assessment
Dietary intake was measured by the Cancer Council Victoria Diet Questionnaire for
Epidemiological Studies (DQES-V3.1 (FFQ)). The FFQ has been validated in an Australian population
and is widely used in epidemiological studies [12]. The questionnaire asks the participant’s habitual
consumption of 167 foods and six alcohol beverages over the previous 12-month on a 10-point
frequency scale. Additional questions were asked about the type of breads, dairy products and fat
spreads used. Macronutrient intakes were computed from the dietary data by the means of the nutrient
composition tables in the NUTTAB95 database (Food Standards Australia New Zealand, Canberra,
Australia, 1995).

** Includes 20 successful and 3 failed second PSG of which one was successfully reperated at a third 
time (this flow chart with instructions for PSG recruitment has been published previously [11]). 
2.3. Sleep Assessments 
Sleep measurements consisted of subjective (CATI and self‐reported questionnaires) and 
objective (in‐home PSG) approaches. Self‐reported data included: (1) the STOP (snore, tiredness 
during daytime, observed apnoea and high blood pressure) questions [13]; (2) the Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (total score ranged from 0 to 21, a score >5 indicates poor sleep quality) [14]; and (3) 
sleepiness asked by the question “Do you feel sleepy when sitting quietly during the day or early 
evening? (1) yes (2) no (3) sometimes”. 
AHI was measured by a single overnight in‐home PSG with Emblettas X100 portable sleep 
device [15]) and manually scored by an experienced sleep technician according to the 2007 American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria (alternative) [16].  
2.4. Other Measurements  
Information on education, marital status, income, work status, physical activity, smoking, shift‐
work, and chronic diseases were collected by questionnaires [8]. Medication use was obtained from

2.4. Other Measurements
Information on education, marital status, income, work status, physical activity, smoking,
shift-work, and chronic diseases were collected by questionnaires [8]. Medication use was obtained
from Medicare Australia by confidential unit record linkage, classified according to the Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification. The number of distinct medication classes (at the ATC
third level) six months before clinical examination were treated as covariates.
Body weight was measured in light indoor clothing without shoes to the nearest 100 g. Height was
measured without shoes to the nearest mm using a stadiometer. Waist circumference was measured
to the nearest mm, midway between the inferior margin of the last rib and the crest of the ilium,
in the mid-axillary line in a horizontal plane. Blood pressure was measured twice using a mercury
sphygmomanometer on the right upper arm of the subject, who was seated for five minutes before
the measurement.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
Macronutrient (carbohydrate, protein and fat) intakes (g) were recoded into quartiles (Q1–Q4).
Chi square test was used to compare difference between categorical variables, and ANOVA was used
to compare differences in continuous variables between groups. The association between quartiles
of macronutrient intake and self-reported sleep (snoring and poor sleep quality) was assessed using
Poisson regression. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to test the association between
macronutrient intake and self-reported sleepiness (“yes”, “sometimes” and “no”), as well as the
association between macronutrient intake and AHI. AHI was divided into three categories: low (<5),
medium (5–19) and high (ě20). Using low level and the lowest quartile (Q1) of each macronutrient
intake as the reference group, multivariate-adjusted associations were performed: (1) model 1 adjusted
for age; (2) model 2 further adjustments for education, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity
and shift-work; (3) model 3 further adjustments for waist circumference, diabetes, depression and
medication. We did a sensitivity analysis by further adjusting for energy intake in model 4. Structural
equation modelling (SEM) was used to test whether body mass index (BMI) mediates the association
between macronutrient intake and AHI (treated as continuous variable) and daytime sleepiness (“yes”
was assigned with value 2, “no” was assigned with value 0, “sometimes” was assigned with value 1,
and treated as continuous variables). Direct and indirect effects were estimated using command
“estimate teffects”. Linear trend across quartiles of each macronutrient intake was tested using the
median value of each macronutrient intake (g) at each quartile and treating it as a continuous variable
in the model. All statistical procedures were performed using STATA 13.0 (Stata Corporation, College
Station, TX, USA).
3. Results
Overall, 1815 participants with dietary intake were analysed, of whom 837 without a prior
diagnosis of OSA underwent successful sleep studies and 784 completed the dietary intake.
Demographic characteristics by quartiles of each macronutrient intake of the participants are presented
in Table 1. The mean age of the participants was 59.7 (SD 11.4) years. Characteristics of PSG participants
with dietary intake are presented in Table S1.

Univariate analysis results between macronutrient intake and AHI and self-reported sleep
parameters are presented in Table 2. No association was found between carbohydrate or protein
intake and AHI. High intake of fat was positively associated with high AHI and self-reported daytime
sleepiness. The prevalence of sleepiness was 46.4% and 37.0% among those with highest and lowest
quartiles of fat intake. The distribution of AHI was significantly different across quartiles of fat intake
with high fat intake associated with high AHI.
The prevalence ratio of self-reported sleep parameters (relative risk ratio for sleepiness) across
quartiles of macronutrient intake is presented in Table 3 and Figure S1. After adjusting for age, waist
circumference, education, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and shift work),
chronic diseases and medication, the highest quartile of fat intake was positively associated with
daytime sleepiness. Compared with the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of fat intake had a relative
risk ratio (RRR) of 1.78 (95% CI 1.10–2.89) for daytime sleepiness (p for trend across quartiles was 0.305).
When further adjusted for total energy intake, the association was no longer significant. There were no
associations between macronutrient intakes and other self-reported sleep parameters. The RRR for
AHI using multinominal logistic regression are presented in Table 4 and Figure S2. After adjusting for
age, waist circumference, lifestyle factors, chronic diseases and medication, fat intake was positively
associated with high AHI (ě20/h) (Q4 vs. Q1, RRR 2.98 (95% CI 1.20–7.38) (p for trend across quartiles
was 0.046 across quartiles). Similarly, the association was not significant after further adjusting for total
energy intake. BMI mediated 30% of the association between fat intake and AHI (direct effect 0.07,
indirect effect 0.03, p < 0.05) (Table S2 and Figure S3). However, BMI did not mediate the association
between fat intake and daytime sleepiness (Table S3).

4. Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the association between macronutrient
intake and sleep in a large population based cross-sectional study using objectively measured
polysomnography. We found that high intake of fat was associated with daytime sleepiness and
high AHI. The associations between fat intake and AHI was mediated by BMI.
Although the mechanism of the associations between macronutrient intake and sleep parameters
is yet to be clear, some possibilities have been suggested by previously published work. Sleep can
be regulated by various hormones that is induced by food intake through communications between
hypothalamus and the brain [17]. Both dietary carbohydrates and protein can affect tryptophan
metabolism through the availability tryptophan uptake into the brain via the blood brain barrier [18].
Regarding the mechanism of fat intake and sleep parameters, it is suggested that fat may affect sleep
by altering circadian regulation of hormonal, central nervous and metabolic systems [19].
We found a positive association between high fat intake and daytime sleepiness. Early experimental
studies showed that both infusion of lipid into the small intestine and isoenergetic meals may cause a
decline in alertness and concentration [20]. Wells et.al have shown that healthy young subjects felt
sleepier and less awake 2–3 h after a high-fat-low-carbohydrate meal [21]. Although carbohydrate rich
meals have been demonstrated to be associated with postprandial lassitude [22], a greater decline
was seen in high fat intake [20]. Other laboratory evidences suggested the potential role of gut
neuro hormones in promoting hypnogenesis through vagal activation which essentially triggers
fatigue [23–27]. However, we did not have data on the timing of fat intake, and dietary data collection
was prior to sleep measurements, so the immediate effect of sleepiness of high-fat diet was not able to
be assessed. Long-term high fat intake may lead to elevated levels of leptin and decreased levels of
ghrelin [28], which could regulate arousal and wakefulness via orexin [29]. Increased sleepiness was
observed in mice with high-diet fed induced obesity [30]. In large scale studies, positive associations
between obesity and excessive daytime sleepiness has been reported [31,32]. This is consistent with
our data that participants in the obese group had a higher risk of daytime sleepiness after adjusting
for lifestyle factors (Table S4). However, obesity does not seem to be a mediator of the association
between fat intake and daytime sleepiness (Table S3).High fat intake was also found to be associated
with a high level of AHI (ě20/h) in this study, after adjusting for age, waist, lifestyle factors, chronic
diseases and medication. Similarly, previous experimental studies found a fatty meal the night before
bed would increase AHI in OSA patients [4]. Long-term effect of high-fat diet on AHI is not clear.
In non-obese rats, high-fat fed diet increases apnoea, and this could be reversed and prevented by a
low dose injection of metformin (a drug for insulin resistance) [33]. This may suggest that insulin
resistance induced by high fat diet may be one of the mechanisms leading to increased AHI, but
was dependent on body weight. In patients with type 2 diabetes, AHI (ě30/h) was associated with
higher BMI [34]. Obesity has been suggested as one of the main risk factors of sleep apnoea [35] in
the literature. In our study, being obese was strongly associated with higher AHI compared with
non-obese participants (Table S5). Our mediation modelling suggests that the direct effect of BMI on
AHI was about five times stronger than the effect from fat intake, and about 30% of the effect on AHI
comes from BMI (Table S2 and Figure S3).
Regarding energy intake, higher energy intake was associated with high level of AHI in our study
(Table S5), and our sensitivity analysis suggested that it was a confounder in the association between
fat intake and AHI and daytime sleepiness. However, energy intake estimated from self-reported
dietary intake has been suggested to be less accurate [36]. Moreover, soft drink and alcohol were not
included in the energy intake calculation in our study.
The main merits of this study are: (1) it is the first investigation of the association between
macronutrient intake and PSG measured sleep parameters as well as self-reported sleep problems
in a relatively large sample; (2) we were able to adjust for a wide range of covariates including age,
waist circumference, energy intake, education, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, shift work,
depression, diabetes and medication.

Several limitations in our study need to be acknowledged. Firstly, asynchronous exploration
between macronutrient and sleep were performed due to the mismatch of time of the PSG study
and dietary survey. Secondly, due to the nature of the cross-sectional study, causation cannot be
made. Thirdly, because the study only involved men, the findings may not be generalised to women.
In addition, we only conducted one overnight PSG assessment as it is not practical to have multiple
night PSG assessments in large epidemiological studies. Despite objective sleep measurement, dietary
intake was estimated by FFQ, rather than 24-h food recall or actual weighing. 24-h food recall provides
meal specific food intake information, which has been suggested to be associated with circadian
adaption [37]. However, it is impractical to conduct 24-h food recall in studies with large sample size,
and 24-h recall does not capture a long term dietary habit as FFQ does.
In conclusion, high fat intake was associated with daytime sleepiness and high AHI. BMI mediates
the association between fat and AHI but not daytime sleepiness. Although a public health benefit is
suggested, future studies are needed to confirm the findings at the population level.
