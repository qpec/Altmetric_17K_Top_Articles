Background: Humanfemale orgasm isavexedquestioninthe fieldwhilethere iscredibleevidence ofcryptic female
choice that has many hallmarks of orgasm in other species. Our initial goal was to produce a proof of concept for
allowing females to study an aspect of infertility in a home setting, specifically by aligning the study of human
infertility and increased fertility with the study of other mammalian fertility. In the latter case - the realm of
oxytocin-mediated sperm retention mechanisms seems to be at work in terms of ultimate function (differential
sperm retention) while the proximate function (rapid transport or cervical tenting) remains unresolved.
Method: A repeated measures design using an easily taught technique in a natural setting was used. Participants
were a small (n�6), non-representative sample of females. The introduction of a sperm-simulant combinedwith
an orgasm-producing technique using a vibrator/home massager and other easily supplied materials.
Results: The sperm flowback (simulated) was measured using a technique that can be used in a home setting.
There was a significant difference in simulant retention between the orgasm (M�4.08, SD�0.17) and non-
orgasm (M�3.30, SD�0.22) conditions; t (5)�7.02, p�0.001. Cohen’s d�3.97, effect size r�0.89. This
indicates a medium to small effect size.
Conclusions: This method could allow females to test an aspect of sexual response that has been linked to
lowered fertility in a home setting with minimal training. It needs to be replicated with a larger sample size.

D
ebate concerning the nature and function of
human female orgasm has been intense �
although frequently producing far more heat
than light. According to most scholars in the field
(Barash, 2005; Judson, 2005; Pound & Daly, 2000; Puts,
2006), it is still an open question whether female orgasm
has been sculpted by natural selection to somehow in-
crease the dispersal of genes in future generations or
whether it exists only as a by-product of some other
adaptation. In this latter case, the most promising can-
didate would be the strong selection on the sensitivity of
the male homologue of the clitoris � namely the penis
(Gould, 1987; Lloyd, 2005; Symons, 1979) whereby
female orgasms exist only because male ones do � having
no function of their own. A by-product account typically
emphasizes the allegedly poor location of centers of
female sexual sensitivity for coitally produced orgasm to
occur. Proponents of this theory then typically go on to
argue that female sexual organs therefore exhibit a ‘Rube
Goldberg haphazardness’1 (Gould, 1987; Lloyd, 2005;
Symons, 1979; Wallen & Lloyd, 2008).
Candidates for an adaptive function for female orgasm
have broadly fallen into two types. There are those who
argue that female orgasms help to cement pair bonds, in a
1Rube Goldberg was a cartoonist who drew fantastical machines
that humorously completed mundane tasks with unnecessary
complexity. The English equivalent is Heath Robinson.

 species requiring bi-parental care (Eschler, 2004, 2005;
Morris, 1967; Rancour-Laferriere, 1983). In contrast are
those who assert that female orgasm allows preferential
selection of sperm from any one of a multitude of part-
ners (Baker & Bellis, 1993a, 1993b; Thornhill, Gangestad,
& Comer, 1995). Sperm selection is a feature of female
choice mechanisms. In contrast to Bateman’s principle,
there is a large body of evidence across taxa that female
fitness increases as sexual partners increase, just in case
that there is some mechanism for picking the best sperm
among sexual partners (Simmons, 2005). Note that there
is no requirement for these to be concurrent sexual
partners. It need not be the case that sperm from multiple
partners is simultaneously present in the female � just
that there operates some sort of differential sorting mech-
anism that privileges some matings over others.
It could be argued that these two adaptive accounts
are to some extent orthogonal to one another, generating a
somewhat different set of testable predictions. For exam-
ple, with respect to the pair-bond hypothesis, the finding
that primate female orgasm in general seems to occur more
frequently in extra-pair copulations (Ellsworth & Bailey,
2013) with high dominance or high genetic quality part-
ners (Gangestad & Thornhill, 1995; Puts, Welling, Burriss,
& Dawood, 2012; Thornhill et al., 1995; Troisi & Carosi,
1998) runs counter to prediction. However, it could also be
the case that reliably produced coital orgasms tend to draw
a heterosexual couple together (Rancour-Laferriere, 1983;
Wheatley & Puts, 2015). Viewed in this light, the com-
parative difficulty in females’ achieving coital orgasm with
a multiplicity of partners is a non-accidental feature of
such orgasms having adaptive significance. They are part
of a female choice mechanism that responds differentially
to different partners. In other words � female orgasm may
represent, in part, a ‘try before you buy’ mechanism that
simultaneously increases conception chances and moti-
vates the female to bond with that partner. A recent
detailed and authoritative review of the literature con-
cluded that the balance of probability was that some form
of sperm-selection mechanism was the most likely candi-
date for the functional aspect of human female orgasm
(Puts, Dawood, & Welling, 2012). However, the physiolo-
gical nature of such a mechanism is still in dispute � with
anatomical authorities in disagreement about whether it is
the proximate mechanism of cervical tenting (Levin, 2011)
or rapid transport (Zervomanolakis et al., 2007) by which
this evolved function is performed.
The clitoris is crucial to understanding the nature
of female orgasm. However � and contrary to much
popular and scholarly opinion � the clitoris is not a Rube
Goldberg contraption ill-suited to the production of
orgasm through intercourse (Gould, 1987; Hite, 1976;
Lloyd, 2005; Symons, 1979; Wallen & Lloyd, 2008;
although see Wallen & Lloyd, 2011 for a partial retraction
of this position). On the contrary � the clitoris is an
exquisitely balanced measuring instrument � with at least
18 separate, but functionally, integrated components
(Dickinson, 1949; Kobelt, 1851; O’Connell, Hutson,
Anderson & Plenter, 1998; O’Connell, Sanjeevan, &
Hutson, 2005). Most of its 4-inch length of sensitive
vascular tissue is hidden inside � prompting one leading
anatomist to call it an ‘iceberg organ’ (R. Levin, personal
communication, July 2010). The exterior part, or glans,
is highly sensitive � for example, it is a key area to be
retained during genitoplasty (Schober, Meyer-Bahlburg,
& Ransley, 2004) but this is by no means the only
important area of female sexual sensitivity. Surprisingly,
even women who have had the clitoral glans entirely, even
brutally, excised still report the experience of coital
orgasm (Lightfoot-Klein, 1989). In addition, it has been
found that there are a variety of neural pathways in the
vaginal area, independent of the clitoris, that are im-
portant in female sexual response � even to the point of
triggering orgasm in cases of complete spinal transection
(Komisaruk et al., 1996, 2004; Komisaruk & Sansone,
2003). Recently, these multifarious and separate neural
pathways of genital sensitivity have been mapped onto the
sensory cortex (Komisaruk et al., 2011), which is mark-
edly different in males and females (Di Noto, Newman,
Wall, & Einstein, 2013) arguing for separate underlying
evolutionary pathways in male and female urogenitary
systems.
An underlying assumption of much research into female
orgasm has been that all orgasms are the same, and in this
respect, the workof Masters and Johnson (1965, 1966) has
been foundational. However, their pioneering research is
not the last word on the topic. In particular, there are good
reasons to believe that their methodology of studying
unpartnered masturbation in a laboratory setting may
not have quite captured all of the salient features of the
human sexual experience. Attending to features of evolu-
tionary biology would lead one to expect that sexual
partner characteristics and behaviors (King & Belsky,
2012; Troisi & Carosi, 1998), as well as cognitive and emo-
tional components of the experience (Levin, 2002; Mah &
Binik, 2002), to be more than cosmetic features of sexual
encounters. Specifically, humans typically perform sex in
private consortships where they can focus on reproduc-
tively salient features of their prospective partners.
Although Masters and Johnson (1965, 1966) found no
evidence of sperm insuck in their pioneering research,
their methodology lacked key ingredients of ecological
validity. First, the six experiments on which their (null)
sperm insuck findings were based involved no actual
intercourse at all � they involved unpartnered masturba-
tion of the clitoral glans while a rigid transparent inser-
table was inside the vagina. But such insertables do not
behave like penises during intercourse � which bend to
the shape of the vagina (Schultz, van Andel, Sabelis, &
Mooyaart, 1999) so as to be able to interact with sensitive

 areas of the anterior vaginal wall including the paraur-
ethal gland (Grafenberg, 1950; Komisaruk & Sansone,
2003; Komisaruk et al., 2004; Komisaruk, Whipple,
Gerdes, Harkness, & Keyes, 1997; Levin, 2002; Perry &
Whipple, 1981; Zaviac
ˇic
ˇ, 1999) and the full internal
length of the clitoris (Dickinson, 1949; O’Connell et al.,
1998, 2005). For certain key experiments, Masters and
Johnson (1965, 1966) used inserted metal specula that
covered all of these sensitive areas. Thus, it is likely that
their methodologies effectively sidelined key features of
female orgasms, and therefore, their conclusion that
female orgasm was a unitary phenomenon � always the
same no matter how achieved or with whom � may have
reflected nothing more than an experimental artifact.
The recognition that not all female orgasms are the
same is a commonplace assumption among many sex
researchers (Bentler & Peeler, 1979; King & Belsky, 2012;
King, Belsky, Mah, & Binik, 2011; Levin, 1981, 1998,
2001, 2004; Levin & Wagner, 1985; Mah & Binik, 2001,
2002; Singer & Singer, 1972), sex therapists (Brody,
2007; Butler, 1976; Costa & Brody, 2007; Fisher, 1973;
Robertiello, 1970; Sundahl, 2003), and many � though not
all � women themselves when asked directly (Hite, 1976).
Female orgasms can vary in sensation, location, and im-
portant features of phenomenology. Following sugges-
tions (Dawood, Kirk, Bailey, Andrews, & Martin, 2005;
Judson, 2005), it has been found that women themselves
report that their orgasms vary in type (King et al., 2011)
and in ways based on how they are brought about (King
& Belsky, 2012). Furthermore, this variability hints at
adaptive functionality for at least one component of
female orgasmic experience � that of oxytocin-mediated
uterine peristalsis, a mechanism that has been hypothe-
sized to underlie sperm insuck (King & Belsky, 2012;
Wildt, Kissler, Licht, & Becker, 1998). Taken together,
it is very likely that in previous studies, including those
of Masters and Johnston, the full length of the clitoris,
most of which is internal, had not been aroused. Some
orgasms are reported as being accompanied by deep
internal sensations that could be the corollary of orgas-
mic function itself.
Differential sperm insuck has been investigated in
humans using a number of physiological measures (Fox,
1976; Fox & Fox, 1971; Fox, Wolff, & Baker, 1970; Wildt
et al., 1998; Zervomanolakis et al., 2007; but see Levin
(1998) for a proximately alternative, but functionally
equivalent view). Using radio telemetry devices, the
teams (Fox & Fox, 1971; Fox et al., 1970) found pressure
changes in the uterus following coitally generated female
orgasm. Although there have been some suggestions that
such pressure changes could have been caused by freak
weather conditions (Wallen, 2006), these would have
had to have been implausibly large to have caused the
measured effects and, in any case, were controlled for in
the original studies and in follow-ups (Fox & Fox, 1971;
Fox et al., 1970). It has been reported that the Fox et al.
(1970) studies show the opposite of what they claimed
(Lloyd, 2005). Specifically, some researchers have said
that the Fox et al. (1970) data show pressure changes in
the wrong direction (Lloyd, 2005; Wallen, 2006). How-
ever, close inspection of the original paper shows that
such criticisms rest on a misreading of the original graphs
� which are admittedly laid out in a somewhat confusing
manner. Specifically, critics have read them as saying the
opposite of what they actually showed. Usually graphs
have a time line along the x-axis that runs with time
flowing from left (time 0) to right. For one reason or
another, the Fox et al. (1970, p. 246) graphs run the
opposite way to custom (i.e. the y-axis is to the right, not
the left of the graph making time run the other way).
Critics who thought that the graphs showed the opposite
of what the Fox et al. team showed were simply viewing
them the wrong way around. Results of these studies,
therefore, do suggest that pressure changes occur in the
predicted direction following coitally generated orgasm.
However, it must be admitted that these pioneering
studies did not measure fluid movement per se � only
the potential for such movement driven by uterine
pressure changes.
Wildt et al. (1998) found insuck of sperm-like sub-
stances in the fallopian tube ipsilateral to the dominant
follicle after administration of oxytocin. Oxytocin is a
known correlate of female orgasm (Blaicher et al., 1999)
and also creates the uterine peristalsis that could cause the
pressure changes found by others (Carmichael, Warburton,
Dixen, & Davidson, 1994; Fox & Fox, 1971). Wildt et al.
(1998) describe the whole system as a peristaltic pump
with clear links to fertility. For example, following ad-
ministration of oxytocin, there was insuck of suitable
material into the fallopian tube ipsilateral to the dominant
ovary. Furthermore, pregnancy rates have been observed
to be higher in those women in whom such transport could
be demonstrated (Zervomanolakis et al., 2007). There has
been some criticism (Levin, 2011) that the amounts of
oxytocin in the bloodstream (3IU) used in such studies are
unrealistically high. However, the peripheral amounts in
the bloodstream are much less important than those found
at the site of action � that is the uterus (L. Wildt, personal
communication, August 2011).
Baker and Bellis (1993a, 1993b) assumed the insuck mech-
anism in their promising, and much cited, research into
the putative functionality of female orgasm.2 However,
they did not attempt any direct measures of sperm insuck
� relying instead on subjective reports of sperm backflow
amounts from participants and estimates of sperm
quantities. Some (Lloyd, 2005) have found the Baker
and Bellis (1993b) statistical analysis of these data to be
confusing. For example, Lloyd (2005, p. 206) criticized
2Although they changed the terminology from ‘insuck’ to ‘upsuck’.
A new method of assessing backflow following female orgasm

 Baker and Bellis (1993b) for their use of nonparametric
tests and standardization of rank scores, although Baker
and Bellis (1993b) describe the conditions for their
analytic procedures in scrupulous detail. However, it
must be admitted that their findings left the adaptive
status of female orgasm theoretical rather than estab-
lished (Pound & Daly, 2006) because flowback was
estimated rather than directly measured. A further
possible drawback to the Baker and Bellis (1993b)
methodology is that they did not distinguish coital from
masturbatory orgasms in terms of the likelihood of
producing sperm insuck and there are reasons to
distinguish female orgasm types (King & Belsky, 2012).
Sperm transport by some form of intra-uterine action
is a phenomenon that has been found across mammalian
taxa � as one might expect of an adaptation (West-
Eberhard, 1992). It has been documented for decades in rats,
cows, dogs, horses, rabbits, and macaques (Ammersbach,
1930; Evans, 1933; Genell, 1939; Goldfoot, Westerborg-
vanLoon, Groeneveld, & Slob, 1980; Krehbiel & Car-
stens, 1939; Millar, 1952; Toner & Adler, 1986; Trapl,
1943; Van Demark & Moeller, 1951). If such transport
responds differentially to salient features of the partner �
in other words becomes sperm selection � then this
would help complete the picture of a function for female
orgasm. To clarify, it is hypothesized that at least some of
the phenomenological features of female orgasm, such as
feelings of deep uterine peristalsis, may be exactly as they
appear to be.
In the farming industry, the generation of uterine
peristalsis � via techniques that more accurately simulate
insemination by a dominant male � is commonplace to
increase sperm uptake through artificial insemination
(Knox, 2001). If humans do not show sperm transport,
then they are the exception among mammals. All of the
mammals in which differential sperm transport (of which
insuck could be a component) has been demonstrated
show some degree of promiscuity � or, more properly,
polyandrous mating. However, some have expressed
skepticism that ancestral (or modern) female humans
might have benefitted greatly from polyandrous behaviors
(Birkhead, 2000).
For there to be a mechanism to privilege some matings
over others � it follows that, over evolutionary time,
enough female humans must have been engaging in
enough polyandry for such an adaptation to develop.
Such polyandry could well be sequential � with female
orgasm acting as a ‘try before you buy’ choice mechanism
or as a well to harvest sperm from preferred partners
while remaining in a primary mate-ship especially under
violent patriarchal conditions (Peters, 1987). Although
official human polyandrous marriage systems are rare �
albeit less so than is commonly thought (Starkweather
& Hames, 2011) � there are a number of reasons for be-
lieving that facultative polyandry among female humans
is more common than often assumed. Across taxa there
are patterns of physiological adaptation that are under-
stood in terms of responses to the degree of female
polyandry. For example, monandrous gorillas have small
testicles, polyandrous chimpanzees have large ones to
produce the necessary amounts of material to compete
effectively inside the females (Dixon, 1998). Human
testicle size falls in between the extremes of monandry
and polyandry (Short, 1979). There exist other similar
male physiological adaptations hypothesized to be ac-
counted for by female polyandry � such as proportionate
sperm increase in multi-male, single-female, sexual en-
counters (Pound, 2002) and, perhaps, a penis adapted to
excavate the sperm of prior partners (Gallup et al., 2003).
It has also been argued that there are specific male psycho-
logical adaptations to the possibility of sperm competi-
tion, such as violent male sexual jealousy (Buss, 2000).
That this jealousy is not always misattributed is evi-
denced by the degree of extra-pair paternity � estimated
to be currently somewhere between 2 and 10% in humans
(Anderson, 2006; Greiling & Buss, 2006). The lower
figure is reported by said scholars as probably more
accurate, but may well be high enough to drive adapta-
tions. Consider an activity that had a 1% chance of
lifetime (pre-reproduction) mortality. Zubrow (1989)
showed that just such a mortality difference in two
overlapping populations would extinguish one of them
within 30 generations � less than a millennium.
Female responses to other females’ socio-sexual stra-
tegies, which in modern parlance has been termed ‘slut
shaming’ (Magnanti, 2012), can also be taken as evidence
of the need � perhaps over evolutionary time � to have
developed strategic psychological responses to polyan-
drous female behaviors. Attacks on female reproductive
reputation are effective in ways that they are not on males
and are evidenced cross-culturally (Gangestad & Simpson,
1990). Some have even argued that female orgasmic
response evolved in an environment of frequent multi-
partner sexual encounters (Hrdy, 1986). In any case, it is
generally becoming accepted that models of sexuality
that imply females to be coy and passive in the face of
aggressive male sexual ardor are seriously at variance
with the facts � whether in humans or other animals
(Gowaty, 1997; Hrdy, 1981, 1986, 1996; Judson, 2003;
Zuk, 2002). Put bluntly, Bateman’s principle � that
females do not benefit from multiple matings � is wrong.
Female choice mechanisms are key drivers in primate
evolution (Cronin, 1991), and facultative polyandry is a
suite of mechanisms that can instantiate such choice.
The current study
In an effort to move the debate forward, we decided to
investigate the phenomenon of sperm retention � possibly
through orgasmic insuck � directly in human females. To
our knowledge, this has not yet been measured directly

 in humans. Anywhere from 5 min to 2 h following inter-
course, there is a phenomenon called backflow � an
outflow of about 3 mL of material, including semen, not
taken up into the reproductive tract (Baker & Bellis,
1993a).3 Minimizing backflow is a commonplace in the
farming industry where maintenance of low backflow
is highly correlated with fertility in a variety of species
(Knox, 2001; Mezalira, Dallanora, Bernardi, Wentz, &
Bortolozzo, 2005; Steverink, Soede, Bouwman, & Kemp,
1998). In humans, backflow is detectable by the female
in question (Baker & Bellis, 1993b) but is not under
conscious control. Measurement of backflow provides a
way to compare the amount of sperm taken up following
orgasm, even of different kinds of female orgasm,
perhaps produced in different ways.
Method
Participants
This exploratory study involved six females, mean age
39.3 years (SD 10.2), median age 39.5 years, age range
from 26 to 52. All were white, European, or American and
had been educated to at least undergraduate degree level.
None were using oral contraceptives. All were sexually
active with a current (male) partner. Five of the six
reported that they experienced regular periods. They all
reported as being either 0 or 1 on the standard Kinsey
scale for sexuality. All had previously reported variation in
orgasmic phenomenology (e.g. deep or shallow orgasms)
in line with previous findings (37). They were recruited via
snowballing of interested parties, accessed via personal
connections or interests. There was one dropout during
the testing period (e.g. from an original seven). All parti-
cipants who remained reported that the procedure was
‘easy’ or ‘fairly easy’ to carry out. While the ‘masturbation
not leading to orgasm’ condition (detailed below) did
create some issues of sexual frustration, all participants
retained in the study reported success with the procedure.
For further details of questions asked, see Appendix 1.
A sample of the instructions for performing the
procedure, including an instructional video, is available
from the authors on request. The study was carried out
under the supervision of the Ethics Board of University
College Cork (approved 15/03/2013). Participants were
fully debriefed, and arrangements were made for them to
be referred to specialist support if issues of inorgasmia
were raised (which did not occur).
Materials
Properties of human semen
Human semen has a number of chemical and physical
properties. Of the former, pH and buffering capacity,
typical citrate concentration, ion composition (calcium,
magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc), osmolarity,
sugar components (fructose and glucose), and, finally,
protein (albumin) concentration have all been assayed
in considerable detail (Owen & Katz, 2005). Important
physical properties of human semen include typical
volume and viscosity. Typical ejaculate volume has been
measured to have a range between 2.7 mL (Bhushan,
Pandey, Singh, Pandey, & Seth, 1978) and 4.99 mL
(Purvis, Magnus, Morkas, Abyholm, & Rui, 1986). The
higher figures are typically, though not universally, found
for
semen
collected
during
copulation
rather
than
following masturbation (Owen & Katz, 2005).
Measurement of viscosity is harder to specify as the
rheological properties of semen change after ejaculation.
The initial ejaculate coagulates and then subsequently
liquefies in from anywhere between 5 min (in vivo) and
30 min (in vitro) (Montagnon, Clavert, & Cranz, 1982;
Polak & Daunter, 1989). Semen has a number of (often
non-Newtonian4) viscosity properties such as its elasti-
city, thixotrophy, shear thinning, and yield stresses, which
are not captured by the standard World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) (1999) laboratory standard measures of
viscosity (see Owen & Katz, 2005, for a more extended
discussion). In their authoritative exposition of the pro-
duction of an effective semen stimulant, authorities in the
field (Owen & Katz, 2005) settle on a viscosity of 1.3 cP.5
Semen simulants
There are a number of products on the market that
reasonably closely approximate to the viscosity of human
semen. Water-based lubricants are preferred for a number
of reasons including hygiene and health. Lubricants
intended for use in sex closely � and non-accidentally �
approximate to the human mucin viscosity levels. In
particular, the BodywiseTM company produce a water-
based lubricant, called Liquid SilkTM, which is also
dermatologically neutral and safe for ingestion.
Collection devices
The Mooncup(TM), manufactured by Bodykind
TM, is a
device used as an alternative to tampons and sanitary pads
for collecting menstrual flow in an environmentally
friendly and hygienic fashion. It is a medical-grade silicone
cup � about the size of an eggcup � that can be held in
place during a woman’s period. Being unobtrusive and
comfortable to wear, it is also ideally suited to collecting
backflow over the up to 2 h time period necessary to do so.
In addition, each woman was supplied with a sterile

 introduction and collection of the sperm stimulant,
surgical glove, and spoon.
Procedures
The methodology was explained to each female in the
same way so as to standardize procedures as far as
possible. There was a trade-off between the requirements
of ecological validity � that orgasm be as natural as
possible � and the demands of scientific standardization of
procedures. Actual coition introduces a range of unac-
ceptably uncontrollable variables � a particularly crucial
one being ejaculate quantity. However, previous research
had found that normally achieved masturbatory orgasms
were insufficient to produce the uterine peristalsis that is
hypothesized to generate insuck (Masters & Johnson,
1965).
Fortunately, technology has moved on since the days
of Masters and Johnson (1965). In particular, devices
such as the Hitachi Magic WandTM can produce deep
tissue stimulation from the outside due to the tremendous
amount of (mains) electricity power used � producing
somewhere in the region of 6,000 RPM. Previous inter-
view-based research (King & Belsky, 2012) has revealed
that deep peristaltic effects during orgasm were common
� although not universal � with such devices. Here, the
pornographic film industry is ahead of science. The
easiest way to create the convincing orgasms in female
actors (Saad, 2011) is to have actual orgasms occur. To
some customers, this is a crucial issue and a common
topic of discussion on Internet message boards. The
Hitachi Magic WandTM is one of the most common devices
for creating such sensations and effects. This device
allowed us to produce orgasms with the phenomenology
of deep internal uterine peristalsis while controlling for
amount of sperm simulant introduced � something that
regular coition would not allow.
A potentially important control was estral timing. If
orgasm is connected to fertility, then it might be predicted
that it occurs differently at peak fertility. Thus, each
female collected backflow on three separate occasions �
at the end of the flow period, at peak estrus, and, finally,
just before the start of the next period. It was left up to
the women themselves to decide this. They kept diaries
of their periods and all reported regularity with them.
Emphasis was on collection at peak estrus, given that
theory predicts that this is when any differential sperm
selection would occur � if it does occur (Baker & Bellis,
1993b). In addition, females filled in a questionnaire that
asked for phenomenological details of the orgasm in ways
that have been previously found to be of significance
(King & Belsky, 2012). This is because it has been
proposed that the putative insuck component of female
sexual response does not occur at every orgasm (King &
Belsky, 2012; King et al., 2011).
Conditions
The most important comparisons were between orgasm
achieved through masturbation of clitoral glans and
masturbation that did not lead to female orgasm. This
is thus a repeated measures design � with each partici-
pant acting as her own control.
Prior to each condition, the female herself introduced
5 mL of appropriate measuring substance (see above)
and then either masturbated to orgasm, or not to orgasm,
as a control � in as far as possible for the same amount
of time. The use of a suitable deep-tissue massager as
detailed above was used. As soon as activity had finished,
the woman inserted the Mooncup(TM) and waited a
suitable time established in pre-testing for backflow to
occur � 1 h. The resultant substance was then extracted
and measured immediately (using the same measuring
syringe) to avoid loss of fluid due to evaporation. Given
the nature of the collection, it was not possible that the
participants be blind to the research hypothesis. However,
by standardizing procedure as far as possible, it was
hoped that any biases be minimized as far as realistically
possible. After a brief period of pre-test consultation and
feedback from participants, the procedure was altered to
emphasize that orgasms that produced female ejaculate
should not be included in the results.
Protocols
This was a repeated measures design with each partici-
pant acting as their own control. The independent vari-
able was simple � orgasm (or not) immediately following
introduction of sperm-like material. In order to control
for participant variables (such as desire), the decision as
to whether an orgasm would occur was decided by a
single coin flip 1 h prior to each collection exercise. It was
left to participants to find convenient times for collection
to occur, within the parameters of estral timing. The
procedure continued until there had been half of the
possible collections under one set of conditions, then
the rest were carried out. There was thus a (more or less)
randomized element introduced to try to control for
extraneous variables. The control was the no orgasm
condition � which still involved introduction of material
and subsequent measuring. The measurements taken here
provided the baseline for comparison. Introduction of
sperm simulant was achieved through the use of a sterile
syringe body (5 mL). Following said introduction, the
collecting device described above was applied and an
hour was allowed to pass. Instructions were that once a
quota of orgasm or non-orgasm conditions had been
achieved by random coin flip, then the remainder of the
protocols would be of the missing condition.
During this collection time, the participant went
about normal business (which the MooncupTM allows
for). Although some (Morris, 1967) have averred that
female orgasm creates drowsiness � the so-called poleax

 effect � this has not been the finding of any other scholars
in the field (in other words no one else of whom we are
aware has reported the hypothesized drowsiness) and any
putative sperm retention mechanisms should work irre-
spective of gravity. Strenuous post-coital activity was
avoided, however. After an hour, the MooncupTM was
removed and the residue inside was measured by using
(now cleaned) syringe body to draw in any resultant
material and the quantity read off from the side. Five
measurements of each condition were taken, including
three during the peak estrus period � as estimated by
counting forward to mid-cycle. This is held to be an
acceptable number of measures to be taken to reduce
random errors (Kirkup, 1994). Measurements taken at
the start and end of flow period were averaged as there
were no visible differences between the amounts mea-
sured. No measurements were taken at the time of each
woman’s period. All participants were non-users of
female oral (i.e. hormonal) contraceptives. Findings
were recorded in the manner detailed below (Appendix 2).
Each participant also recorded phenomenological details
of the orgasms produced.
Results
Sperm
backflow
was measured using
the
protocol
detailed above. Given that a measured dose of 5 mL
was introduced in each case, higher numbers indicate
larger quantities of the sperm simulant being retained.
Table 1 shows the comparison between the (presumed)
high and low fertility conditions in terms of retention of
sperm simulant.
If there were any differences between high and low
fertility conditions, these were undetectable given the
methods used. The initial intent was to be able to look at
results by hypothesized high/low fertility group. However,
given the small N, the low fertility/high fertility figures
were merged to create an average sperm retention score
allowing for more repeated measures data points to
maximize power. It may well be that follow-up research
finds a significant difference here. However, it was drawn
to our attention that the window for human female
fertility may well be broader that is commonly thought
and that sperm stays viable in the reproductive tract for a
surprisingly long time (Gould, Overstreet & Hanson,
1984). Given all this, plus the exploratory nature of the
study, it was considered reasonable to analyze the results
as a unit despite the fact that the initial intent had
included a test of the putative difference between high/
low fertility conditions. It seemed dishonest to pretend
that our initial intent was otherwise. Table 2 represents
the difference between the orgasm and non-orgasm
conditions expressed as a percentage of the total sperm-
simulant insertion (5 mL in each case). Results of the
questionnaire (closed questions) revealed that all the
orgasms in question were experienced as deep inside.
Although sample sizes were not large enough for
rigorous frequentist hypothesis testing (Tabachnick &
Fidel, 2007), there are still things about the data that can
be explored statistically. The differences between the
hypothesized high and low fertility conditions were not
significant but comparisons were made between the
aggregated orgasm and non-orgasm conditions for each
of the six participants. Treating the combined orgasm and
non-orgasm conditions as paired samples showed that
there was a significant difference in simulant retention �
measured in terms of lower amount of flowback � between
the

Discussion
The goal of the research was to establish a workable
method for testing the existence of and measuring the
result of sperm-retention mechanisms in human female
orgasm � bringing it in line with fertility-related research
in other species. Our aim was to generate a protocol that
could be carried out easily and at home and that might be
of use and interest to a wider audience than those with
the specific interest of understanding human female

 sexual response � that is those with a practical interest in
their own fertility.
The protocols outlined here suggested a mechanism
that can be used to assess differing hypotheses in respect
of human female orgasm. Furthermore, it appears that
female orgasm does perform some sort of sperm-retention
function. These results were in line with what has been
found in respect of sperm retention following oxytocin-
stimulating procedures in other species (Knox, 2001).
However, there are some important caveats.
One major limitation is that the sample size is, at
present, very small. While this is in line with the sample
sizes in other studies in human female orgasm otherwise
taken to be authoritative (e.g. Masters & Johnson (1965)
used six participants in their key study), the procedure
presented here should be taken as a proof of concept and
of procedural validity, rather than as conclusive evidence
of a sperm-retention function for human female orgasm.
The sample size was insufficient to produce anything
more than (albeit highly suggestive) descriptive statistics.
While the average effect size of putative sperm-retention
was large (15.7%) and in line with that found in other
species (Knox, 2001), these are preliminary findings only.
There is a need for these findings to be replicated in a
larger sample.
Furthermore, volunteers for a study such as this are
highly unlikely to be representative of the female popu-
lation at large. They are likely to be more generally sex-
positive (Plaud, Gaither, Hegstad, Rowan, & Devitt,
1999; Strassberg & Lowe, 1995) and more generally
novelty-seeking (Wiederman, 1999). However, even ad-
mitting this, it is unlikely that any of these things would
have much effect on the mechanisms under investigation.
However, the lack of blinding of the procedure may have
led to biased measurement � especially as some volunteers
were recruited via personal connections and interests,
while others approached one of the authors following a
discussion and request for volunteers on a blog post
about sexual research. Such volunteers may be motivated,
albeit subconsciously, to bias in their measurements. We
hope that the procedure is sufficiently robust and simple
enough to be carried out by a larger sample of parties
interested in the fertility-related aspects of their sexual
response and look forward to independent replication.
This would help to offset the necessarily invasive elements
of the study protocol.
In terms of future directions, even if human female
orgasm is established (through subsequent study) to be
sperm retaining, the precise mechanism of retention is still
disputed by physiological scholars in the field. Some have
argued that during female orgasm, the cervix tents slowing
sperm intake and thereby increasing fertility (Levin, 1998).
Others have argued that female orgasm, or at least the
oxytocin release associated with it, facilitates rapid trans-
fer of sperm (Wildt et al., 1998; Zervomanolakis et al., 2007).
Either of these sperm-retaining proximate mechanisms
would serve the same ultimate function � of increasing
fertility � if orgasms occur selectively. And this, they
appear to do (Gangestad & Thornhill, 1995; King &
Belsky, 2012). The evolutionary function (if any) and the
proximate mechanism (whichever it may or may not be)
need to be kept conceptually distinct in people’s minds lest
huge confusions occur.
One finding worthy of note is that some support for
taking self-report more seriously than some scholars
might assume. Data and theory should be mutually
supporting and build on one another. The small sample
of women did report (from the relevant closed question
in the questionnaire, Appendix 2) that they experienced
their orgasms deep inside � what is sometimes, albeit
erroneously, called a ‘vaginal orgasm’. As argued above,
all orgasms are clitoral but many do not engage the full
extent of the clitoris. This tends to support the idea that
female orgasms that involve arousal and stimulation of
the whole of the clitoris, rather than just the glans, may
be important. In this respect, it could be noted that it is
possible to generate ejaculation and orgasms from a
flaccid male penis by using sufficient direct stimulation.
It might thus be argued that any typology of orgasm is
redundant. There is some merit to this argument. In
support of the typology approach, it should be men-
tioned that it is women themselves that report this
difference (King & Belsky, 2012).
Finally, sperm retention leading to increased fertility is
not just of abstract or academic interest. Female orgasm is
closely linked to couple satisfaction. In addition, if sperm
retention does occur, then a number of interventions
relating to persistently infertile couples suggest them-
selves. Indeed, a prominent fertility specialist is on record
as saying that it is his belief that female inorgasmia
explains some of the variance in fertility once other
variables have been controlled for (Winston, 2010). The
procedures outlined here could easily be envisaged to form
part of the protocols to assist fertility in some couples as
well as providing a procedure for assessing the function of
female orgasm. As such, we submit that there is a proof of
concept of sperm retention function of female orgasm,
and a method for investigating the function of the same
could be developed.
