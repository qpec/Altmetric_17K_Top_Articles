Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Patients with type 1 diabetes and
microalbuminuria are at high risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) and end-stage renal disease. Soluble Klotho is an
anti-ageing circulating hormone involved in phosphate
metabolism and vascular homeostasis through protective
effects on the endothelium and antioxidant actions. The role
of soluble Klotho in patients with type 1 diabetes and
microalbuminuria is unknown.
Methods In a cross-sectional single-centre study we evaluated
the levels of circulating serum soluble Klotho in 33
participants with type 1 diabetes and a history of
microalbuminuria (receiving renin–angiotensin system
[RAS] inhibitors) and 45 participants with type 1 diabetes
without a history of microalbuminuria (not receiving RAS or
other antihypertensive drugs). All participants had an eGFR
>45 ml/min, duration of diabetes >20 years and no history of
CVD. Serum soluble Klotho levels were measured by a
validated immunoassay.
Results Participants with microalbuminuria had significantly
lower levels of serum Klotho compared with those without
microalbuminuria (median [interquartile range], 659.3
[525.3, 827.6] vs 787.7 [629.5, 1007]; p = 0.023). This
difference persisted after adjustment for variables including
age and eGFR. In a subgroup of 30 individuals with and
without microalbuminuria, other markers of phosphate
balance were not significantly different.
Conclusions/interpretation In individuals with type 1
diabetes, microalbuminuria is associated with soluble Klotho
deficiency. Further studies are required to determine whether
soluble Klotho is causally related to the development of
cardio-renal disease in type 1 diabetes.

Introduction
Microalbuminuria (MA) is one of the earliest manifestations of
diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in type 1 diabetes [1]. MA, a
marker of endothelial dysfunction, is associated with a higher risk
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality [1].
Increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are key
events contributing to the pathogenesis of DKD and CVD [1].
Klotho is a nephroprotective transmembrane protein
predominantly expressed in the renal tubules and implicated

 in regulating phosphate metabolism, together with fibroblast
growth factor-23 (FGF-23) [2]. A circulating form of Klotho,
named soluble Klotho (resulting from a proteolytic cleavage
of the transmembrane protein), is detectable in the circulation
and has been demonstrated to maintain vascular homeostasis
through antioxidant properties [2]. In vivo, soluble Klotho
deficiency is accompanied by activation of the renin
angiotensin system (RAS) and endothelial dysfunction [2].
Individuals with type 2 diabetes and an eGFR >60 ml/min
have reduced tissue levels of Klotho compared with individ-
uals with IgA nephropathy [3]. ESM Table 1 summarises
human and in vivo studies where Klotho levels have been
associated with DKD. In rodent models of type 1 diabetes,
renal expression of Klotho is reduced [3]. To date there is a
lack of information on the relationship between circulating
soluble Klotho and MA in patients with type 1 diabetes.
Methods
This study included 78 individuals with type 1 diabetes
attending the diabetes outpatient clinic at Guy’s Hospital,
London, UK. Of these, 33 had microalbuminuria (MA+) and
45 had normoalbuminuria (MA−). All study participants gave
informed consent and investigations were approved by the
responsible ethics committee. Clinical details and biochemical
measurements for the cohort are shown in Table 1. For
measurement of serum Klotho, blood samples were
immediately centrifuged at 1500g at 4°C for 10 min and the
supernatant fractions were stored at 80°C (for <24 months)
with no freeze–thaw cycles before analysis. This approach has
been shown not to impact on the sensitivity of the assay used
in this study [4]. All samples were assayed in duplicate using
an immunoassay kit (Immuno-Biological-Laboratories,
Hamburg, Germany) [4–6].
All participants had an eGFR >45 ml/min, duration of
diabetes >20 years and no history of CVD. Participants in
the MA+ group had a positive history of MA (more than two
early morning urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR)
measurements ≥3.0 mg/mmol), confirmed diabetic
retinopathy and were receiving RAS inhibitor treatment. The
participants in the MA− group were not receiving any RAS
inhibitor treatment or any other antihypertensive agents.
An investigator blinded to MA status performed the
soluble Klotho measurements. Urine ACR was measured
from morning urine samples. Urine creatinine (Jaffe
reaction) and albumin concentrations were measured by
immunoturbidimetry, serum total cholesterol (enzymatic
colorimetry) and creatinine (rate reaction method) levels were
measured using a Cobas Mira Plus analyser (Roche
Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) [6]. HbA1c was measured
by boronate affinity HPLC (Primus CLC330, Kansas City,
MO, USA). eGFR was determined using the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Formula
(CKD-EPI) [7].
Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis of
demographic and clinical features. Participants with and
without MA were compared by an unpaired t test (for
continuous normally distributed variables), Mann–Whitney
test (for continuous variables not normally distributed) and
χ2 test (for categorical variables). Testing for normality was
performed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Since soluble Klotho
levels and ACR were not normally distributed, their values
were log transformed (base e) for Pearson correlation analysis
and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Multivariate
logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate if the

 significant association between MA status and Klotho levels
persisted when adjusted for other variables. Data are given as
mean±SD, percentage for categorical variables, or median
and interquartile range for variables not normally distributed.
A two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 19.0
(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Participants in the MA+ group were older (54.4 ± 11.6 vs
43.3±9.6 years), more frequently male (70% vs 44%) and
more frequently on statin treatment (70% vs 29%) compared
with the MA− group (p < 0.05 for all; Table 1). MA+
participants also had higher systolic BP (132.6 ± 12.4 vs
126.3 ± 13.1 mmHg), lower eGFR (90.2 ± 21.7 vs
100.2 ± 20.4 ml/min) and lower levels of serum Klotho
(659.3 [525.3, 827.6] vs 787.7 [629.5, 1007] pg/ml) compared
with MA− participants (p<0.05 for all; Table 1). Glycaemic
control was not significantly different between the two
groups. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, serum
soluble Klotho levels were inversely and significantly
associated with MA+ independent of other variables,
including age and eGFR (ESM Table 2). A significant corre-
lation between soluble Klotho and eGFR was not observed in
the entire cohort (MA+ and MA−) or MA+ population.
No significant association between ACR and soluble
Klotho was observed. In participants with MA+ (all receiving
RAS inhibitors) there was no significant difference in soluble
Klotho levels between those with remission of MA (ACR <3)
vs those with ACR ≥3.
Other variables including 25-hydroxy vitamin D (measured
by liquid chromatography and electrospray ionisation tandem
MS), serum corrected calcium (albumin measured by the
Roche bromocresol green method and calcium using
5‑nitro‑5′‑methyl‑BAPTA method), serum phosphorus
(measured using Roche molybdate method) and intact
parathyroid hormone (PTH; measured by the Roche method:
sandwich assay) levels were available in a subgroup of the full
cohort (n=30; MA+, n=12; MA−, n=18) (Table 2). These
patients were matched for age, HbA1c, BP, diabetes duration
and eGFR. In this subgroup, no statistically significant differ-
ences were found in 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, corrected
calcium and PTH between the MA+ and MA− groups. Klotho
remained significantly lower in participants in the MA+ group
compared with those in the MA− group. There was a signifi-
cant negative correlation between serum phosphorus and
serum soluble Klotho (Pearson correlation r = −0.397,
p=0.03; ESM Fig. 1).
Discussion
This is the first study to demonstrate that individuals with type
1 diabetes and MA+ have significantly lower serum soluble
Klotho levels compared with MA− individuals.
Our findings are consistent with in vivo data showing that
Klotho deficiency has a negative impact on albumin excretion
and is associated with kidney hypertrophy and exaggerated
expansion of the mesangial matrix in renal glomeruli [8]. A
nephroprotective role has been demonstrated for Klotho in an
animal model of type 1 diabetes, with global overexpression
ameliorating the histological features of DKD and reducing
albuminuria [9]. In a recent study using a non-diabetic animal
model of albuminuria, treatment with exogenous soluble
Klotho resulted in a reduction of urinary albumin excretion
by protecting against podocyte injury [10].
In individuals with type 2 diabetes, the level of plasma soluble
Klotho has been shown to correlate negatively with the
development of albuminuria and with a decline in eGFR [11].
Soluble Klotho levels reported in healthy adults, measured
with the same assay used in the present study, are similar to
our findings in individuals with type 1 diabetes [5, 12].

 Soluble Klotho has antiapoptotic effects on vascular
endothelial cells and protects against endothelial dysfunction
[2]. The association, if any, between levels of soluble Klotho
and CVD or renal endpoints in type 1 or type 2 diabetes is
unknown. In non-diabetic elderly individuals, higher soluble
Klotho levels are independently associated with a lower risk
of CVD [13].
Increased activation of the RAS characterises DKD,
whereas treatment with RAS inhibitors lowers the incidence
of cardio-renal events in DKD [1]. Of interest, activation of
the RAS induces a reduction in serum soluble Klotho levels
[2]. We have previously demonstrated in individuals with type
2 diabetes and MA+ that RAS inhibition increases soluble
Klotho levels [6]. In the present study, despite all participants
with MA+ receiving RAS inhibitors, this group had
significantly lower levels of serum soluble Klotho.
Our work has several limitations. A causal relationship
between lower soluble Klotho and development of MA cannot
be inferred as this was a cross-sectional study. Our sample size
is small as we specifically excluded patients with advanced
renal dysfunction and CVD, which are known to influence
Klotho levels [2]. We did not measure 24 h urine excretion
of calcium or phosphate or FGF-23 levels, and the results of
other markers of calcium phosphate metabolism were only
available for around one-third of participants. However, we
did not observe any differences in these markers in our study
subcohort with relatively preserved eGFR. This is consistent
with the general consensus that patients with lower eGFR and
advanced DKD exhibit significant perturbations in markers of
calcium phosphate metabolism/turnover. In the study
subcohort we noted significantly lower levels of circulating
Klotho in the MA+ group and this may suggest that changes in
Klotho occur early in type 1 diabetes DKD and before overt
changes in other markers of calcium and phosphorus
metabolism.
The strengths of this study are that all of the enrolled
patients had relatively preserved renal function (eGFR >45),
a similar long duration of diabetes and were a well-characterised
cohort attending a single centre for their diabetes care.
Further prospective studies will have to elucidate the
contribution of soluble Klotho deficiency to the development
of MA and progression of DKD. The need for such studies is
underscored by the laboratory evidence that Klotho is
involved in the pathogenesis of MA and DKD.
Klotho may be a potential target to reduce or significantly
slow the progression of renal disease in individuals with type
1 diabetes. With this perspective, our results establish a
platform to address this in future clinical studies.
