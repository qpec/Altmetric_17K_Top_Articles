ABSTRACT
Objective Iron deficiency is a common complication in
patients with IBD and oral iron therapy is suggested to
exacerbate IBD symptoms. We performed an open-
labelled clinical trial to compare the effects of per oral
(PO) versus intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapy
(IRT).
Design The study population included patients with
Crohn’s disease (CD; N=31), UC (N=22) and control
subjects with iron deficiency (non-inflamed, NI=19).
After randomisation, participants received iron sulfate
(PO) or iron sucrose (IV) over 3 months. Clinical
parameters, faecal bacterial communities and
metabolomes were assessed before and after
intervention.
Results Both PO and IV treatments ameliorated iron
deficiency, but higher ferritin levels were observed with
IV. Changes in disease activity were independent of iron
treatment types. Faecal samples in IBD were
characterised by marked interindividual differences, lower
phylotype richness and proportions of Clostridiales.
Metabolite analysis also showed separation of both UC
and CD from control anaemic participants. Major shifts
in bacterial diversity occurred in approximately half of all
participants after IRT, but patients with CD were most
susceptible. Despite individual-specific changes in
phylotypes due to IRT, PO treatment was associated with
decreased abundances of operational taxonomic units
assigned to the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
Ruminococcus bromii, Dorea sp. and Collinsella
aerofaciens. Clear IV-specific and PO-specific fingerprints
were evident at the level of metabolomes, with changes
affecting cholesterol-derived host substrates.
Conclusions Shifts in gut bacterial diversity and
composition associated with iron treatment are
pronounced in IBD participants. Despite similar clinical
outcome, oral administration differentially affects
bacterial phylotypes and faecal metabolites compared
with IV therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Iron deficiency anaemia is a common clinical issue
in patients with IBD, and iron replacement therapy
(IRT) improves anaemia and is associated with
improved quality of life.1 Conflicting results about
clinical outcome regarding the route of IRT have
been published.2 3 T
otal iron replacement is pos-
sible with intravenous (IV) iron infusions consid-
ered to be safe and efficacious.4 With regard to oral
iron, it has been advocated that lower doses of oral
iron should be used as it is efficacious with less side
effects.
Iron is a critical nutrient for the growth of
microorganisms, and the tight regulation of intra-
vascular iron availability forms part of the innate
immune defence.5 However, similar iron regulation
has not been elucidated in the intraluminal gut
environment whereby many gut bacteria are com-
peting for the free iron to maintain their growth.
Most of the pathogenic bacteria have enhanced
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ The high prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia
in patients with IBD requires therapeutic
intervention based on oral or intravenous (IV)
iron application.
▸ Oral iron treatment is standard, but GI side
effects and the potency to exacerbate intestinal
inflammation support clinical implementation
of IV iron therapy.
▸ High concentrations of luminal iron affect the
gut microbiota composition and disease activity
in IBD.
What are the new findings?
▸ Bacterial communities are most sensitive to
iron therapy in patients with Crohn’s disease
(CD).
▸ Oral and IV iron therapies differentially affect
bacterial communities and the metabolic
landscape in patients with IBD.
▸ Shifts in faecal metabolome and bacterial
communities are dissociated from changes in
disease activity in patients with IBD.
How might it impact on clinical practice in
the foreseeable future?
▸ IV iron therapy might specifically benefit anaemic
patients with CD with an instable microbiota.

 iron acquisition mechanisms contributing to increased viru-
lence.6 7 This was demonstrated in a study involving African
children where an increase in enterobacteria and a reduction in
lactobacilli accompanied by increased faecal calprotectin levels
were noted after 6 months of iron fortified biscuits.8 Most
recently, Jaeggi et al9 confirmed the effect of iron fortification
in Kenyan infants clearly demonstrating changes in faecal bacter-
ial

IBD is a result of disordered immune responses to commensal
and pathogenic gut microbes in genetically susceptible indivi-
duals.10 Diversion of faecal stream in the setting of an ileostomy
improves colonic inflammation, whereas re-establishment of the
faecal stream causes recurrence of disease, clearly demonstrating
the critical role of gut microbes in IBD pathogenesis.11 12 There
is accumulating evidence available implicating the role of gut
microbial dysbiosis in the pathogenesis and perpetuation of
IBD; however, environmental factors promoting changes in the
gut microbial ecosystem are poorly defined.13–16
W
e previously showed that dietary iron alters dominant gut
bacterial communities and exacerbates chronic ileal inflamma-
tion in mice.17 However, as correctly noted in a recent com-
mentary by Guenter W
eiss, the relevance of these findings still
awaits proof of concept in humans.18 Hence, we designed and
conducted an open-labelled clinical trial with iron-deficient par-
ticipants with or without IBD and performed pre-iron therapy
and post-iron therapy measurements where the individuals
served as their own controls. W
e measured faecal bacterial com-
munities by high-throughput sequencing and metabolite profiles
by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Clinical data included
changes in serum haemoglobin, ferritin and iron saturation and
the effect of iron therapy on the IBD status as captured by clin-
ical disease activity index and C reactive protein (CRP).
METHODS
Cohort and study design
Participants were identified by their treating gastroenterologists
and recruited during 2010 from the gastroenterology outpatient
clinics in Edmonton (University of Alberta Hospital (UAH),
Royal Alexandra Hosptial (RAH)). Written inform consent was
obtained prior to web-based randomisation. Inclusion criteria
were age >18 years and confirmed diagnosis of IBD by standard
radiology, endoscopy and histopathology findings. The control
group consisted of participants with a recent upper GI bleeding
such as peptic ulcer disease, with a deliberate low iron diet
(vegetarian), or women with non-specific GI symptoms and
menorrhagia. All subjects were iron deficient, that is, iron satur-
ation <16% with or without ferritin <30 mg/L (if normal CRP)
or <100 mg/L (if elevated CRP). Exclusion criteria included
iron supplementation, blood transfusion or the use of antibiotics
within the last 3 months prior to inclusion, untreated concur-
rent folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency, history of intolerance
to IRT
, coeliac disease, known malignancy other than skin
cancer and primary haematological disorder. Treatment alloca-
tion was 1:1 to either IV or per oral (PO) iron therapy. PO parti-
cipants took one 300 mg iron sulfate tablet twice a day. IV
patients received three or four separate iron sucrose 300 mg
infusions if iron deficient only or with anaemia, respectively.
Participants were followed up for 12 weeks from the initiation
of IRT
. The experimental design is summarised in figure 1A.
A review of participants’ clinical disease activity status at
12 months from the iron therapy initiation was performed with
special emphasis on the need for therapeutic escalation (step-up
medical or surgical therapy).
Samples
All participants were reviewed at baseline and 3 months after
initiating IRT
. At these time points, serum and stool specimens
were collected. All participants were given a stool collection kit
with a pictorial instruction on how to collect stools specimens
and minimise contamination. Stool samples were frozen within
30 min and kept at −80°C until further processing for sequen-
cing and mass spectrometry analysis. W
e can thus exclude con-
founding effects of freezing/thawing cycles or storage at −20°C
over long periods of time. As the recruitment happened over
18 months, some specimens were kept frozen longer than
others. However, this was the case for samples across all groups
that were compared, precluding group-specific artefact observa-
tions due to the sampling/storage procedure. Quality of life was
assessed using Shorten IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) and the
Euro Quality 5 Dimensions Visual Analogue Scale (EQ5D VAS).
At 3 months, subjects were reviewed for medication adherence
and possible adverse event. IBD activity was assessed with
Modified Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn’s disease
(CD) and Partial Mayo (pMayo) score for UC, in conjunction
with serum CRP
. Adherence to PO iron therapy was assessed by
pill count at week 12 and adherence to IV iron was determined
by attendance at the infusion clinic. The disease activity and
clinical course of the IBD cohort were also reviewed at
12 months after initiation of treatment.
High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing
Samples were processed and data were analysed as described
previously.19 Detailed information is provided in the online sup-
plementary methods.
High-resolution mass spectrometry and metabolome
analysis
Samples were measured via Fourier transform ion cyclotron res-
onance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-mass spectrometry (MS))
and acquired data were processed by in-house developed pipe-
lines as described in the online supplementary methods.
Iron measurement
The procedure for quantification of iron content in faeces is
detailed in the online supplementary methods.
Statistical analysis
All data sets, including operational taxonomic unit (OTU)
counts and abundances of taxonomic groups as well as metabo-
lome data, are provided in online supplementary table S1.
Statistical analyses were performed in the R programming envir-
onment or using SIMCA-P+12 (Umetrics).
Sequencing data were analysed statistically as published previ-
ously.19 Prior to testing for variations in OTU or taxonomic
counts, individual counts <0.5% were zeroed, and only prevalent
and dominant taxonomic groups or molecular species (ie, detected
in at least 30% of the participants (n=124) and with a median
sequence abundance >1% in at least one group) were considered.
For metabolome analysis, data were autoscaled prior to apply-
ing any multivariate tools. Feature selection for a given classifi-
cation was done according to the absolute values of regression
coefficients or variable importance in projection (VIP score)
derived from applying orthogonal partial least squares discrim-
inant analysis (OPLS-DA). In order to estimate univariate signifi-
cance of the selected features, p values were calculated using the
Mann–Whitney test. After selecting an adequate set of features
(per extension, metabolites), OPLS-DA was reperformed using

 sevenfold cross-validation and the quality of the model was
checked by the values of R2Y and Q2CUM (goodness of fit and
predictive ability, respectively).
RESULTS
IRT restores iron storage, independently of the
administration route
A total of 72 participants completed the study (36 in each of
the PO and IV group), including 19 non-inflamed (NI) controls,
31 patients with CD and 22 patients with UC. After interven-
tion, the mean iron saturation level in the control group was no
different between the PO route (23.3±6.3%) and IV route
(23.9±9.9%). Comparable mean iron saturation was achieved at
3 months in the IBD cohort: PO route (24.7±15.8%) and IV
route (24.2±13.4%) (figure 1B). A statistically significantly
higher serum ferritin level at 3 months was noted in the IV
cohort compared with PO in both NI and IBD participants
(figure 1B). The route of IRT did not affect haemoglobin levels
at 3 months (data not shown).
Impact of iron treatment on disease activity
and quality of life
The route of IRT did not affect disease activity based on
changes in the clinical disease activity indices (MHBI and
pMayo) and serum concentrations of CRP (figure 1C). At
12 months follow-up, 37% of the PO (n=27) and 30% of the
IV (n=124) cohort required therapeutic escalation requiring
biological therapy or surgery (p=0.63). Overall, there was a
trend towards higher magnitude of improved SIBDQ scores in
IBD-IV groups, but results did not reach significance (figure
1D). In contrast, the VAS (EQ5D VAS) indicated improvement
in CD participants on the IV treatment (figure 1D), suggesting
that IV iron may be associated with a better quality of life in
CD. With respect to adverse events, one CD participant in the
IV group developed arterial thrombosis of the left leg requiring
below knee amputation. Other adverse events included general-
ised arthralgia and headaches. In the PO cohort, one participant
had self-limiting nausea. No adverse event was reported in the
control group. Adherence to IV iron therapy was 100% in all

 participants. The overall adherence rate in the PO cohort
ranged from taking 85–100% of the iron tablets.
IBD is linked to specific faecal microbiota and metabolome
fingerprints
After sequence processing and filtering, we obtained a total of
6 726 192 chimera-checked 16S rRNA gene sequences (53 382
±13 153 per sample) spanning a total of 372 OTUs (121±37
per sample). W
e first looked at the presence of IBD-specific dif-
ferences in bacterial diversity and composition by analysing all
samples
independently
of
the
time
point
of
measure.
Multidimensional scaling revealed a significant clustering of
samples according to the occurrence of IBD (figure 2A). Both
IBD
groups
were
characterised
by
marked
interindividual
differences in 16S rRNA profiles when compared with NI parti-
cipants, who represented a more homogenous group of samples.
CD
participants
were
most
distinguishable
from
controls,
without specific subclustering according to disease state, that is,
patients in an active phase of the disease or in remission were
scattered across the clusters. Analysis of Shannon effective diver-
sity showed that IBD subjects were characterised by a significant
drop in taxa richness, and this was most pronounced in patients
with CD, who showed a median effective count <15 species
(figure 2B). To see whether differences observed at the level of
diversity were associated with changes in the relative abundance
of specific bacteria, we looked for significant differences in
sequence proportions of taxonomic groups from phyla down to
families. Firmicutes was the most dominant phylum in the
samples analysed, followed by Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes.
Members of the latter phylum were completely absent in samples
from patients with UC in the active state of disease (see online
supplementary figure S1A). Among Firmicutes, we observed a
drop in the relative abundance of Clostridiales in patients with
CD (figure 2C). At the family level, higher median abundance of
Christensenellaceae was specific for NI subjects. Within the
phylum Actinobacteria, Bifidobacteriaceae showed higher abun-
dances in patients with IBD (figure 2C), which might be related
to dietary intake of probiotics and prebiotics in the form of com-
mercially available yogurts in 10 participants.
With respect to metabolomics analysis, 7578 m/z values out of
the original 204 445 features detected (ca. 4%) passed filtering,
of which 2260 m/z values were annotated as putative metabolites
without differentiation between human, plant or bacterial origin.
An OPLS-DA model based on 1012 features revealed that base-
line faecal samples from patients without IBD separated well
from patients with CD (figure 2D). Of the 300 m/z values
assigned to putative metabolites, 13 were most discriminative for
classification of the CD and NI groups, including higher signal
intensities for ceramide phosphate and three fatty acids in faeces
from patients with CD (figure 2E). The OPLS-DA model built
using the samples belonging to NI and UC classes at baseline was
less robust than the model discriminating NI and CD classes,
with R2Y and Q2CUM values of 0.3 and 0.21, respectively
(figure 2F). Of the 331 m/z values assigned to putative metabo-
lites, 13 were most discriminative, including lower intensities of
phospholipids in patients with UC (figure 2G).
Faecal metabolomes and bacterial communities are prone to
instability in anaemic IBD versus NI patients following IRT
W
e next looked at variations of bacterial communities and
metabolomes in faeces when discriminating samples before
and after IRT. Multidimensional analysis showed that the
effect of treatment overtime did not overrule IBD-specific
clustering, that is,
we did not observe major effects of oral
or
IV
iron
on
bacterial
diversity
that
would
generate
treatment-specific clusters of samples (figure 3A). Changes
were individual specific, that is,
distances between samples
before and after treatment ranged from short to extreme, sug-
gesting that faecal bacterial communities from several subjects
are differentially sensitive to changes during IRT. Comparison
of phylogenetic distances demonstrated that paired samples
(before and after therapy for each individual) were more dis-
tantly related in patients with CD and patients with UC than
in control anaemic participants, indicating that faecal bacterial
communities
in
IBD
subjects
are
more
sensitive
to
IRT-induced alterations (figure 3B). Dendrogram analysis illu-
strated that patients with CD (red colour in the outer ring)
had the most distinct diversity, but most of all that these
patients were characterised by the lowest number of paired
samples, defined as two samples from one given individual
being most closely related to each other than to any other
sample in the data set (black boxes) (figure 3C). When classi-
fying subjects according to changes in the disease status
(improved, unchanged, worsen) on the basis of clinical scores
and CRP levels, and independently of IBD type (CD or UC),
a decrease in sequence proportions of members of the family
Ruminococcaceae was observed in subjects with improvement
of disease (see online supplementary figure S1B).
T
o assess the impact of IRT on faecal metabolome, we looked
at the sample arrangement in a low-dimensional space produced
by OPLS-DA for differentiation between NI controls and
patients with CD (prediction for NI and UC subjects after IRT
was not performed since the corresponding model was weak)
(figure 3D). This analysis showed that sample points from the
NI and CD groups after IRT (triangles) grouped together com-
pared with sample clouds at baseline (circles), which showed
divergence between NI and CD. This indicates that, in compari-
son with clear CD-specific features at baseline, faecal metabo-
lomes converged after IRT
.
The gut ecosystem is affected by oral iron treatment
Comparing samples at baseline and after IRT taking into
account the route of administration independently of disease
phenotype, the iron content in faeces was increased after PO
(p=0.014) but not after IV (p=0.363) treatment (paired t test)
(figure 4A). In contrast, total sulfur concentrations were not sig-
nificantly different. Because of these changes affecting iron
levels in faeces, we assessed whether the route of iron adminis-
tration influenced changes in bacterial communities and metabo-
lite landscape.
Independently of disease activity phenotype, we searched for
differences between PO and IV treatment when considering
delta-values calculated as differences in sequence abundances
(after—before). W
e found only five single OTUs that showed
differential effects, four of which had lower abundances after
oral iron therapy (figure 4B). These OTUs were identified as
Collinsella aerofaciens (OTU-6), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
(OTU-13), Ruminococcus bromii (OTU-23) and Dorea sp.
(OTU-52). In contrast, one OTU belonging to the genus
Bifidobacterium (OTU-620) was found at higher relative abun-
dances in faeces from subjects treated with iron orally, although
four participants in this group consumed prebiotics and probio-
tics versus six in the IV group.
An OPLS-DA classification model of the routes of administra-
tion independently of disease phenotype was built to find
treatment-specific
differences
in
faecal
metabolomes
and
showed that IV and PO grouped distinctly (figure 4C). A total of
1040 features were used to build the model and 308 of them

server. The top-17 metabolites responsible for separation of IV
and PO groups together with the output of univariate statistics
are shown in figure 4D. Metabolites displaying higher intensities
in the PO group included phosphatidylglycerol, palmitate and
derivatives thereof, whereas bile acids, steroids (tetrahydro-
deoxycorticosterone) and other cholesterol derivatives were
characteristics of the IV group.
DISCUSSION
The high prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in IBD requires
therapeutic intervention based on oral IRT or IV-IRT
.20 Oral
IRT has long been considered as standard intervention based on
the safety profile, low cost and convenient administration.
However, the high frequency of GI side effects21 and the
potency to exacerbate intestinal inflammation support clinical
implementation of IV-IRT

 absence of luminal ferrous iron was associated with major
changes in the gut microbiota and the prevention of chronic
inflammation in an experimental model for CD-like ileitis.17 24
To follow up on these findings, the aim of the present study was
to investigate the impact of oral (PO) and IV iron treatment on
the intestinal milieu via assessment of faecal bacterial diversity
and composition as well as metabolome analysis in subjects with
iron deficiency suffering from CD or UC.
In accordance with previous reports,25–28 distinct bacterial
phylogenetic
makeups
and
lower
phylotype
richness
were
observed in faeces from patients with IBD compared with NI
control anaemic subjects. Most interesting regarding the impact of
IRT
, faecal bacterial communities in patients with CD were charac-
terised by highest interindividual differences and were most sensi-
tive to changes after 3 months of treatment. Despite limitations of
faecal material for bacterial community analysis,29 the drop
observed in the relative abundance of Clostridiales spp. is consist-
ent with the most comprehensive analysis in treatment-naïve
paediatric patients with CD.25 In the latter study
, changes in stool
samples were actually representative for differences in biopsy
material at the terminal ileum and rectum. This implies an import-
ant disease-related effect on members of the order Clostridiales
independent of medication and sampling procedures. Specifically,
reduction of Clostridium cluster IV and XIV members has been
proposed to contribute to dysbiosis in patients with CD,30 31 and
selected mixtures of corresponding clostridia strains were shown
to induce Tregulatory cells with disease-suppressive phenotypes in
IBD-related mouse models.32 These results support a potential
protective role of certain Clostridiales spp. in IBD pathogenesis. In
our study, members of the newly described bacterial family

 Christensenellaceae were specific for NI conditions.33 However,
other family members within the order Clostridiales such as
Ruminococcaceae as well as the Veillonellaceae within the order
Selenomonadales are rather increased in patients with IBD,25 28 34
making general disease-related conclusions at these high taxo-
nomic levels rather difficult.
The transition from a quiescent state to disease exacerbation
in patients with IBD was shown to be associated with alterations
of faecal bacterial communities,35 which supports the hypothesis
that inflammatory processes in the intestines of both patients
with UC and patients with CD affect the microbial milieu. In
our study, IRT-induced shifts in bacterial diversity and compos-
ition in faeces from patients with IBD were not associated with
changes in disease activity, suggesting that patient-specific shifts
in faecal microbiota are not necessarily linked to changes in
disease severity over short periods of intervention. Regarding
the route of iron administration, IV therapy confirmed a slightly
more effective management of iron deficiency anaemia com-
pared with oral treatment with respect to serum ferritin levels.
In addition and consistent with the presence of increased iron in
faeces, the luminal milieu in faeces from PO-treated individuals
was distinct at the level of both metabolome and the occurrence
of specific bacterial phylotypes. In contrast to the increase in
total faecal iron after PO administration of iron sulfate tablets,
the total sulfur concentration did not increase. Oral administra-
tion studies of radioactive sulfate indicate a relatively high effi-
ciency of intestinal sulfate absorption, reaching up to 80%.36
Even doses of up to 8 g anhydrous sodium sulfate per day
resulted in 50–60% absorption efficiency.37 Although the colon
might contribute to total sulfate absorption,38 colonic accumula-
tion of this terminal electron acceptor as growth-limiting sub-
strate of sulfate-reducing bacteria would lead to an increased
abundance
in
human
faeces,
including
Desulfovibrio,
Desulfomonas or Desulfobacter.39 However, sequence analysis
in our study revealed low relative abundance and no changes in
bacterial taxa associated with sulfate metabolism. Changes
included higher signals for cholesterol, palmitate and phosphati-
dylglycerol in PO-IRT
, accompanied by a significant decrease in
the relative abundance of C. aerofaciens, F
. prausnitzii, R. bromii
and Dorea sp., and an increase in one OTU within the genus
Bifidobacterium. In contrast to the increase in total faecal iron
after PO administration of iron sulfate tablets, the total sulfur

 concentration did not increase. Oral administration studies of
radioactive sulfate indicate a relatively high efficiency of intes-
tinal sulfate absorption, reaching up to 80%.36 Even doses of up
to 8 g anhydrous sodium sulfate per day resulted in 50–60%
absorption efficiency.37 Although the colon might contribute to
total sulfate absorption,38 colonic accumulation of this terminal
electron acceptor as growth-limiting substrate of sulfate-reducing
bacteria would lead to an increased abundance in human faeces,
including
Desulfovibrio,
Desulfomonas
or
Desulfobacter.39
However, sequence analysis in our study revealed low relative
abundance and no changes in bacterial taxa associated with
sulfate metabolism. Opposite to the IBD-related changes that we
observed, iron fortification in Kenyan infants showed an increase
in clostridia and a decrease in bifidobacteria.9 40 Interestingly,
Bifidobacterium strains isolated from stools of iron-deficient
infants efficiently sequestered iron,41 suggesting an inverse rela-
tionship between abundance and functionality. Moreover, we
cannot exclude the possibility that the intake of functional foods,
including probiotic dairy products, in the present study may have
specifically affected results on relative sequence abundances of
bifidobacteria. Considering currently available studies, one of the
most consistent differences between IBD and NI subjects is the
reduced abundance of F
. prausnitzii, a member of the Clostridium
cluster IV
.14 15 W
e demonstrated that the relative sequence abun-
dance of F
. prausnitzii in stool samples was lower after PO
therapy, suggesting that this bacterium is affected not only by
disease-intrinsic factors, but also by environmental factors.
Non-targeted
metabolomics
studies
have
described
IBD-related changes in faecal metabolomes using mass spec-
trometry (MS)-based or nuclear magnetic resonance spectros-
copy
(NMR)-based
measurements.42–47
W
e
applied
direct
infusion FT-ICR-mass spectrometry (MS) to identify differences
in the metabolic landscape of patients with IBD before and after
PO-IRT or IV-IRT
. Our models revealed best discrimination of
faecal samples from CD versus NI subjects at baseline, with, for
instance, decreased intensities for the metabolite pyridoxate, a
degradation product of vitamin B6, which, in its coenzyme form
(pyridoxal-5-phosphate), previously showed lower plasma levels
in patients with IBD48 and was found to be inversely associated
with systemic inflammatory biomarkers.49 Several other com-
pounds annotated as fatty acids or conjugates thereof were dis-
criminative between NI and IBD (both CD and UC) subjects,
supporting a previously published study.45 Fatty acids are
important
players
in
mechanisms
underlying
inflammatory
responses, particularly short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and poly-
unsaturated fatty acids.50 C18:0 was characteristic of CD
samples, whereas signals for C16:2 were higher in the NI
group. Of note, C16:2 can be produced from chain-shortening
of conjugated linoleic acid, the latter compound being shown to
have
positive
immunoregulatory
effects
in
patients
with
CD.51 52 Phospholipids were also discriminatory in our ana-
lyses: lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPA) was increased in
CD and LysoPE was decreased in UC. LysoPAs can originate
from ceramides, which are lipids regulating multiple cellular
functions, including inflammation.53 Phosphorylation of cera-
mide leads to generation of ceramide phosphate that, along with
LysoPAs, was increased in CD group compared with NI. With
respect to UC subjects, the model revealed variations in the
occurrence of dicarboxylic acids, such as undecanedioate, dode-
canedioate and sebacate, which are proposed to regulate mito-
chondrial fatty acid oxidation and to be involved in IBD-related
liver dysfunctions.54 Finally, intensities of acetyl-N-formyl-5-
methoxykynurenamine were slightly decreased in UC subjects at
baseline. This compound is a metabolite of melatonin proposed
to have anti-inflammatory properties.55 Data suggest that mela-
tonin administration can have beneficial effects in UC.56
Metabolite features discriminating the PO and IV routes of
IRT included cholesterol and bile acid derivatives (lower in PO).
Different metabolic and inflammatory pathways involving chol-
esterol and bile acids have been linked to alterations of the gut
microbiota.57–59 In addition, higher levels of C16:0 in the PO
group were observed in our study. Patients with IBD were previ-
ously shown to have higher levels of saturated fatty acids in the
colonic mucosa60 and patients with CD showed higher levels of
C16:0 in faeces.45 Metabolites characterised by higher levels in
the IV group included lysophosphatidic acid, a signalling mol-
ecule affecting different cell functions in the intestinal epithe-
lium with possible tumorigenic effects,61 and urolithin A, a
metabolite of ellagic acid or ellagitannins produced by some
members of the gut microbiota with a wide range of biological
properties,
for
example,
antioxidant,
oestrogenic,
anti-
inflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities.62–64 Altogether,
whereas differences in microbiota were observed at the level of
a few specific molecular species, the route of iron administration
had a clearer discriminative effect at the level of metabolomes,
which reflect both host and microbial functions.
In conclusion, IRT in patients with iron deficiency or anaemia
induced significant shifts in bacterial community structure and
metabolite landscape in faeces. Patients with CD seemed to be
more prone to IRT-induced shifts and, according to the load of
free iron detected in the luminal environment, oral iron therapy
affected the presence of specific molecular bacterial species.
