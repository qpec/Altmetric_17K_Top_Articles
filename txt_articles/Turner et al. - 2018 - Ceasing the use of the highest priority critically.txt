 Ceasing the use of the highest priority critically important antimicrobials does not adversely affect 
production, health or welfare parameters in dairy cows

Abstract 
Due to scientific, public and political concern regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR), 
several EU countries have already taken steps to reduce antimicrobial (AM) usage in 
production animal medicine, particularly that of the highest priority critically important AMs 
(HP-CIAs). While veterinarians are aware of issues surrounding AMR, potential barriers to 
change such as concerns of reduced animal health, welfare or production may inhibit progress 
towards more responsible AM prescribing.  
Farmers from seven dairy farms in South West England engaged in changing AM use 
through an active process of education and herd health planning meetings. Prescribing data 
was collected from veterinary sales records; production and health data were accessed via 
milk recording and farm-recorded data.  
This study demonstrates that cattle health and welfare - as measured by production 
parameters, fertility, udder health and mobility data, and culling rates - can be maintained and 
even improved alongside a complete cessation in the use of HP-CIAs as well as an overall 
reduction of AM use on dairy farms.  
This study also identified a need to consider different metrics when analysing AM use data, 
including dose-based metrics as well as those of total quantities to allow better representation 
of the direction and magnitude of changes in AM use. 
  
Introduction 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within production animal populations is of increasing 
scientific, public and political concern. A recent review of published literature highlighted 
that, for some bacteria, AMR patterns seen in humans could be a result of antimicrobial (AM) 
use in livestock (1). There are also increasing reports of resistant bacteria being recovered 
from production animals (2-5), that the use of certain classes of antibiotics in livestock 
increase the risks of multiresistant bacteria being present on farms using these medicines (6, 
7), and that decreasing the use of these classes of antimicrobials can reduce the prevalence of 
resistance on these farms (8).  
Fluoroquinolones and third and fourth generation cephalosporins have been identified as 
‘highest priority critically important antimicrobials’ (HP-CIAs) for human medicine by 
national and international bodies including the World Health Organisation (WHO), World 
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the 
United Nations (FAO). Several EU countries have already taken steps to reduce AM use in 
production animal medicine (9, 10) with recent focus on the reduction of HP-CIAs. 
Prophylactic use of AMs is also under scrutiny as this practice has been demonstrated to 
increase the prevalence of multidrug resistant bacteria (11). Veterinary surgeons (VSs) in the 
UK have a crucial role to play in the reduction of AM administration on farms: although AMs 
are commonly administered by farm staff (12, 13), prescription-only veterinary medicines 
(POM-V), such as AMs, may only be used if prescribed by a VS, who is therefore ultimately 
responsible for their use. Furthermore, as a trusted source of information to farmers (13), VSs 
are well-placed both to implement changes in prescription practice and to educate and 
motivate farmers and farm staff to engage with disease prevention strategies and more 
 responsible AM use, all of which have been identified as ‘areas of action’ to reduce AMR 
(14). 
Whilst many VSs understand and appreciate concerns surrounding the use of AMs in 
production animal medicine (15), there are also other influences on prescribing practice. 
Practitioners often feel that they need to respond to farmer expectations of AM prescribing 
(16, 17) and farmers, in turn, have concerns over potential reduced animal health, welfare and 
production parameters, as well as financial issues associated with reducing or changing AM 
use on their farms (13, 18). Despite these concerns, a majority of UK dairy farmers feel that 
reducing AM use in their dairy herds would be beneficial and could reduce production costs, 
and that their peers (other farmers and VSs) would think favourably of them doing so (13). 
For VSs working in production animal medicine, the challenge of achieving more responsible 
and sustainable AM use can offer an opportunity to advance dialogue with farmers about on-
farm treatment protocols, employing preventive rather than reactive management of animal 
health and active herd health management.  
The primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the cessation of use of HP-CIAs, 
at farm level on associated animal health, welfare and production parameters. Other aims 
were to describe the reduction in AM use using appropriate metrics and to delineate the 
process by which prescribing practices were changed on the participating farms. The 
hypothesis was that cessation of the use of HP-CIAs would not be associated with 
deterioration of health, welfare or production on the dairy farms investigated. Throughout the 
study HP-CIAs are defined according to guidelines from the European Medicines Agency, as 
has been adopted by the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance, namely third 
and fourth generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and colistin ( 20). 
 
 Materials and methods 
Data collected for this study originated from seven dairy farms, all of which were current 
clients of the Langford Farm Animal Practice (FAP), North Somerset, UK. Data were 
collected between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2015.  
Implementing prescribing changes 
In 2010, VSs at the FAP began an initiative to reduce the use of HP-CIAs on all farms under 
the care of the practice. During 2010-11 farmers were engaged and educated about this 
process through farmer meetings and herd health planning visits; during 2011-12 changes to 
prescribing policy and on-farm use were implemented on pilot farms (Farms 2 and 3). 
Subsequently, changes were extended to all farms through the following years (2012-15), 
including one farm that joined the practice at the end of 2013 (Farm 6) on which changes in 
AM use were implemented from January 2014. Despite changes being implemented 
sequentially across study farms, AM use data were available for all farms for the whole study 
period. Farms worked closely with different VSs from the practice during this time, but the 
same changes to prescribing practice were encouraged on all farms throughout this entire 
process. It was deemed that all substantial changes had been made on all farms by the end of 
2014, so at least one year of follow-up data were available for comparison across all farms.   
On-farm treatment protocols were changed so that HP-CIAs were not kept on farms and were 
only prescribed by VSs after examination of an animal. Gradually the use of HP-CIAs was 
phased out entirely by both farmers and VSs for any empirical treatment decision. The most 
significant changes were: 1) from early 2010 fluoroquinolones were no longer used or 
prescribed by the practice; 2) fourth generation cephalosporins used in lactating cow 
intramammary tubes were replaced with products containing penicillin and aminoglycoside 
preparations; 3) third generation cephalosporins, widely used as injectable preparations, were 
 replaced with first generation cephalosporins or aminopenicillins. Practice policy stated that 
HP-CIAs were only to be considered if indicated by the results of culture and sensitivity 
testing.  
Strategies to encourage and improve animal management and husbandry were also 
implemented alongside changes in AM use. These included, but were not limited to, the 
increasing use of medicine audits and reviews to guide herd health planning and engage 
farmers in changing and reducing AM use, farmer education including evening meetings and 
practical classes, and increased herd health monitoring through clinical scoring (mobility 
scores/ body condition scoring) and sampling (milk cultures, metabolic profiling etc). 
Herd inclusion 
Herds were included in this study if they milk recorded monthly and kept sufficiently detailed 
fertility and disease incidence records to allow analysis of specific health parameters (see 
Supplementary Materials).  
Data collection 
Health, fertility and milk recording data were captured in Interherd software (Pan Livestock 
Services Ltd, Reading UK) or bespoke spreadsheets and then either extracted directly from 
these or after further analysis in another software package (TotalVet, SUM-IT Computer 
systems Ltd, Thame, UK; Figure 1). A full explanation of the data collection process and 
definition of disease parameters are described in the Supplementary Materials. 
Data for each health and welfare parameter were imported into the R programming 
environment (R-prject.org), log-transformed so that regression results represented percentage 
change per year, and then modelled by random-intercept regression using the Bayesian 
MCMCglmm package (21). 130,000 MCMC samples were simulated with the first 30,000 
 discarded as burn-in. For each health and welfare parameter, the slope of the fitted regression 
curve as percentage change per year of the mean (M) and the Bayesian equivalent of 
confidence intervals, the 95% credible interval (CI), are reported.  
Antimicrobial prescribing  
Data collection 
  
Antimicrobial prescribing and sales data were accessed via practice management 
software (RXWorks, Newbury, UK). From this software, a list of all AM sales to each of the 
farms in the study was obtained for each of the study years (1st January – 31st December 
2010-15), in addition to this AM sales data were provided by the veterinary practice 
supplying medicines to Farm 6 in 2010 - 13. Sales data were entered into a spreadsheet 
(Microsoft Excel, 2013) for analysis and total kilograms (kg) of AMs used per year as well as 
Animal Daily Dose per animal per year (ADD), as defined by Dupont and colleagues (22), 
were calculated. Further information regarding the calculation of the AM use metrics and AM 
classification are included in the Supplementary Materials. 
Results 
Farm descriptions 
All seven farms were located within a 20-mile radius of Langford FAP in South West 
England. All farms reared their own heifer replacements, had all-year-round calving patterns 
and, when housed, kept cows in cubicles (freestalls). All but two farms performed selective 
dry cow therapy (SDCT) at the start of the study period (23) (see Supplementary Materials 
for SDCT protocol). The farms practicing SDCT treated, on average, 36% of cows with AMs. 
Mean percentage of cows dried off using AMs across all study farms across all years was 
53%. Farm 6 began SDCT during 2014. Descriptive information regarding farm management 
 and on-farm data recording are presented (Tables 1 and 2). 
Antimicrobial prescription 
In 2010, third and fourth generation cephalosporins were being prescribed to all seven farms 
(Figure 2). None of the six FAP clients were prescribed any fluoroquinolones throughout the 
study, meaning the reductions seen in HP-CIA use on these farms is solely due to reduced 
prescriptions of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins. Notably, Farm 6 (which became a 
client of the practice at the end of 2013) was being prescribed a similar amount of HP-CIAs 
from 2010-13 when compared to farms that were clients of the FAP at this time (Figure 2). 
Unlike the other farms, Farm 6 was prescribed small quantities of fluoroquinolones in 2011 
(2.5 ADD) and 2013 (7 ADD). Colistin was not used on any farms throughout the study. 
Due to the changes in prescribing practices, the total quantity of HP-CIAs reduced from 0.9 
kg or 7.2 ADD in 2010 (accounting for 6.3% and 41.0% of kg and ADD, respectively) until 
they were not prescribed to any farms in 2015. HP-CIA prescriptions consistently accounted 
for a larger proportion of ADD than kg of AMs.   
The majority of HP-CIAs prescribed in 2010 across the seven farms were licenced for 
systemic administration (77% kg, 61% ADD; Table 3). Intramammary (lactating cow) 
preparations containing 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins also significantly contributed to 
total quantities of HP-CIAs prescribed (23% kg, 39% ADD), although no dry cow 
intramammary preparations containing HP-CIAs were prescribed throughout the six years of 
the study. From 2010 to 2015, HP-CIA-containing intramammary tubes constituted 26, 24, 8, 
3, 0 and 0% of all intramammary preparations, respectively, by kg and 57, 58, 21, 8, 0 and 
0%, respectively, by ADD. 
Overall, systemic AMs accounted for the largest quantities of AM prescriptions to each farm 
(by both kg and ADD) followed by intramammary preparations. The use of intrauterine and 
 topical AMs was low across all years (Table 3). 
Both metrics show variation in the quantities of AMs being prescribed to the study farms 
each year; both the total kg of AMs prescribed and the total number of ADD prescribed to the 
study farms increased in 2012 and 2013 before reducing through 2014 and 2015. When 
represented in ADD, AM prescription in 2015 was lower than in any previous year of the 
study (16.7 ADD; Table 3).  
The mean AM prescription across all study farms was also calculated in mg/kg for each year 
of the study and was found to be 14.0, 12.0, 17.5, 18.0, 15.1 and 12.7 mg/kg respectively 
between 2010 and 2015. The minimum value at the farm level was 5.0 mg/kg and the 
maximum value was 35.3 mg/kg for individual farms across all years of the study.   
The increase in the total quantity of AMs prescribed in 2012, as measured in both kg and 
ADD, was largely due to an increase of penicillins (including penicillin in combination with 
streptomycin), and 1st generation cephalosporins (Table 4). There was little change in the 
prescription of anti-pneumonial AMs considered to be used primarily for the treatment of 
calves (tetracyclines, chloramphenicol derivatives and macrolides, including long-acting 
macrolides) over the six years of the study (2.2, 2.0, 1.7, 2.3, 2.1 and 1.8 kg, respectively, 
through 2010-15), accounting for 0.1 ADD in 2010 and decreasing to 0.08 ADD in 2015. 
Production parameters 
Mean 305-day milk yield showed an increasing trend, with a mean increase of 0.6% per year 
over the six years of the study (95% CI [-0.2, 1.4]; Figure 3).  
Fertility parameters 
Fertility parameters showed an improving trend over the course of the six-year study period. 
Mean 100-day in-calf rate increased across the seven farms from 0.4 in 2010 to 0.5 in 2015 
 (M 5.0%; 95% CI [1.8, 7.8]) (Figure 4A). Calving index decreased from 413 days in 2010 to 
390 days in 2015 (M -0.9 %; 95% CI [-1.4, -0.5]); Figure 4B). During the same period, mean 
calving to conception interval showed a decreasing trend from 147 days in 2010 to 120 days 
in 2015 (M -2.8%/yr; 95% CI [-5.8, 0.2]). During the study period, the mean endometritis 
failure to cure rate is unlikely to have changed (M -5.7%/yr; 95% CI [-19.5, 7.6]). 
Udder health parameters 
Clinical mastitis case rate (as recorded by farmers) decreased on five of the seven farms 
between 2010 and 2015 (Figure 5A). On Farm 1, clinical mastitis cases rose from 10 
cases/100 cows/year to 29 cases/100 cows/year. The on-farm records of clinical mastitis for 
Farm 5 were not complete and so are not included in the analysis. From 2010-15, mean 
mastitis cure rates (as measured by somatic cell counts, SCC) showed a mean increase of 
7.5%/yr (95% CI [1.2, 13.3]; Figure 5B). Mean dry cow cure rates showed a decreasing trend 
(M -1.3%; 95% CI [-2.9, 0.2]). 
Subclinical mastitis risks, as assessed by mean proportion of cows with SCC over 200,000 
cells/ml and the mean percentage of cows chronically infected (SCC>200k for two 
consecutive milk recordings) are unlikely to have changed (M 1.0%; 95% CI [-2.2, 4.4] and 
M 2.2%, 95% CI [-2.1, 6.9], respectively). Variation in the 12-month rolling bulk milk SCC 
which ranged from 161 in 2013 to 262 in 2014 is largely due to extreme variability in the 
bulk milk SCC on one farm (Farm 1; Figure 6). 
Lameness 
The percentage of cows scored as lame at mobility scoring sessions performed by VSs 
decreased over the six years of the study on all farms with complete data (M-18.2%; 95%CI 
[-25.5, -12.5]) (Figure 7).  
Culling 
 Culling percentages ranged from 13 to 33% across the seven farms in 2010 and remained 
within this range throughout subsequent years of the study (M -3.7%; 95% CI [-7.9, 0.3]; 
Figure 8). While certain farms decreased the percentage of the herd culled each year (Farm 
2), others increased the culling percentage overall (Farm 6), and there was variability both 
within and between farms. 
 
Discussion 
The aims of this study were to describe how prescribing policy was changed to achieve a 
cessation in HP-CIA use on seven dairy farms, to appropriately assess these AM use changes 
using two different metrics and to examine the effects of discontinued HP-CIA use on cattle 
health and welfare. 
Farms were selected as a convenience sample due to inclusion criteria. It is accepted that for 
these reasons, and as clients of a first-opinion farm animal practice connected with a 
veterinary school, these farmers may not be representative of all UK dairy farms, and may 
receive more veterinary visits to their farm or veterinary input due to the mutual benefit of 
providing teaching opportunities for veterinary students. However, all the study farms were 
commercial dairies and the information outlined in Table 1 demonstrates that these farms 
represent herd sizes and management systems commonly found in the UK (24). As these data 
are only presented from one veterinary practice the farms are located within a reasonably 
limited geographic region. While this may have benefits in making the data from the farms 
more comparable as all will have been influenced similarly by factors such as climate and 
disease threats, it may mean that these farms are less representative of farms in other 
locations which are subject to other influences. 
Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that a range of different systems and management practices are 
 used across the seven study farms. These differences are likely to influence the initial, and 
ongoing disease prevalence on the farms (e.g.: housing type is likely to affect lameness rates 
and bedding type may influence mastitis rates). However, it is still possible for the aims of 
the study to be achieved by analysing data from these various farms, demonstrating the 
effects of the cessation of HP-CIAs on health and production parameters despite differing 
initial levels or causative factors. This demonstrates that it may be possible to apply similar 
prescribing changes to farms with a variety of management practices and expect to see health 
and production parameters maintained, or improved, as they were on these study farms.  
In this study, AMs prescribed to farms were assumed to represent AM use. It is possible that 
some prescribed AMs may not have been administered to animals but may have gone unused 
or been disposed of. For this reason, AM prescription is likely to overestimate use, however, 
the authors judged this unlikely to be significant as each farm had weekly or bi-weekly 
veterinary visits, making it unnecessary for AMs to be ‘stockpiled’.  
Calculation of antimicrobial use 
The comparison of AM prescribing using two metrics (Tables 3 and 4) highlights the degree 
of change implemented by VSs and farmers; HP-CIAs represent a small proportion of the 
quantity (kg) of AMs used in 2010-12 but represent a far larger proportion of ADD 
administered in the same years. This is particularly true of the use of HP-CIAs in 
intramammary tubes. The way in which the ADD metric is reported alongside kg of AMs 
prescribed demonstrates the ways in which different analyses of AM use can represent these 
data differently, as has been described by Mills and colleagues (25). Calculation of mean AM 
consumption in mg/kg values (as calculated by mg/PCU) for each year of the study was 
included to demonstrate the AM prescription of these herds in comparison with the 50 mg/kg 
target suggested by the O’Neill Report (1) and adopted for the UK across the combined 
livestock sectors (26), as well as the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance 
 (RUMA) Targets Task Force report dairy sector targets of a 50% reduction in use of HP-
CIAs between 2015 and 2020 and a total usage target of 21mg/PCU by 2020 (27). It should 
be noted that a move away from HP-CIAs towards other AM treatments is likely to initially 
increase the total mg/kg (or mg/PCU) use due to differences in dose rates. However, if 
combined with effective changes in herd health management which reduce overall disease 
incidence, this need not be a long-term effect. Conversely driving down total mg/kg targets 
could have unintended consequences if veterinary surgeons were to increase their reliance on 
low dose HP-CIAs. 
Antimicrobial prescription 
Similar to other studies (28-30), penicillins and 1st generation cephalosporins were 
prescribed in the highest quantity (kg) in 2014 and 2015. Tetracyclines were also commonly 
prescribed, as has been previously reported (28, 30). Antimicrobial use by the farms in this 
study differs from that of farms in  similar studies (28, 29), in which 3rd and 4th generation 
cephalosporins were among the most frequently used AM classes). These findings suggest 
that the groups of AMs used most frequently by farms in this study (penicillins, 1st generation 
cephalosporins and tetracyclines) are also commonly used on other dairy farms in other 
developed dairy areas of the world, and, as has been found by other authors, the reduced use 
of HP-CIAs results in a shift towards the use of penicillins and broad-spectrum AMs (31).  
The mean AM prescription to these farms across all years (range 12 – 18 mg/kg) was similar 
to the median and mean AM use on British dairy farms in another recent UK study (32). 
After prescribing changes were implemented on farms during 2011-12, the total quantities of 
AMs prescribed in kg increased by 52% (Table 4). This was in part due to the differences in 
mgs/dose of first line antimicrobials and HP-CIAs resulting in the total use of AMs appearing 
falsely elevated, demonstrated by a smaller increase (25%) as represented by ADD. However, 
 across both metrics, the quantities of AMs prescribed during 2012 and 2013 were higher than 
in 2011, suggesting increased use to treat disease in these years.  
Health and production parameters 
Milk yield on these farms remained stable over the study period, demonstrating that 
production was maintained alongside a cessation of HP-CIA use and an overall decrease in 
ADD prescribed through 2014-15 (Figure 3). 
Prior to prescription policy changes made in 2011-2012, farmers would frequently treat cows 
that were systemically unwell due to retained foetal membranes or metritis with injectable 3rd 
generation cephalosporins. Subsequent to prescription policy changes, cattle with these 
diseases were treated with aminopenicillin preparations or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 
combinations. It is assumed that a significant deterioration in uterine health would have 
negative impacts on fertility parameters (34, 35), however no negative effects on fertility 
parameters were observed in association with the reduction in HP-CIAs on these farms; in 
fact, the calving index decreased, the 100-day in-calf rate increased and mean number of days 
from calving to conception showed a decreasing trend through 2010-15 (Figure 4).  
The protocol for the antibiotic treatment of endometritis (intrauterine 1st generation 
cephalosporin licenced for this purpose in cattle) did not change on any of the farms 
throughout the study period. It is therefore unsurprising that the mean failure to cure rate of 
endometritis remained stable. 
Mean clinical mastitis case rates are reported for reference (Figure 5A), and it should be 
noted that they are lower than the average clinical mastitis case rates on farms in England and 
Wales (estimated to be 47 cases/100 cows/year (equating to a case rate of 0.47) (36)). The 
increase in clinical mastitis case rate in 2012/13 corresponds to the increase in prescription of 
AMs during these years and so is likely to contribute to the increased AM use in these years.  
 Despite variation in clinical mastitis case rates throughout the six study years, the clinical 
mastitis cure rates improved, suggesting that the treatments being used through 2014 and 
2015 (none of which contained HP-CIAs) appeared to be at least as effective at achieving a 
cure as the AMs being used in 2010, when 40% of ADD of intramammary preparations 
prescribed contained HP-CIAs. This is consistent with a study in which implementation of a 
restricted AM usage policy in Dutch herds did not impact negatively on udder health (37). 
HP-CIAs were not used in dry cow treatments in 2010; dry cow treatment protocols were 
therefore not changed between 2010 and 2015. The trend towards lower dry cow cure rates 
may be due to changes in mastitis pathogens, changes in dry cow management or in 
decreased efficacy of dry cow intramammary treatments, but it is difficult to differentiate 
between these with the data available. 
Prior to prescription policy changes, infectious causes of lameness in milking cows (in 
particular interdigital necrobacillosis) would commonly have been treated with injectable 3rd 
generation cephalosporin preparations. Although primarily affected by management factors, 
lameness rates would be expected to have increased if infectious causes of lameness had a 
poor treatment recovery rate. The fact that mobility scores from all six farms for which there 
are data available shows a general reduction in the rates of lameness at mobility scores 
indicates that foot health can also be maintained alongside reduced HP-CIA use, specifically 
through the use of 1st generation cephalosporins and aminopenicillins in place of 3rd 
generation cephalosporins. 
It is possible that animal health may have been deteriorating without altering the health 
parameters assessed if culling rates on the farms had increased significantly. Maximum 
culling rates through 2013-15, however, were lower than those of 2010-12, while the 
minimum culling rate remained at a similar level. Mean percentage change and associated 
CIs suggest that culling rates were maintained through all six years of the study (Figure 7). 
 As this was a retrospective study, only health data and production parameters that were 
available from milk recording data and on-farm records could be analysed. Rather than assess 
the efficacy of specific treatment changes for particular diseases, this study sought to provide 
evidence about the effects on production and welfare parameters of reducing HP-CIAs on 
dairy farms. Where possible, individual animal treatment outcomes were assessed and 
presented. Although many treatment outcomes may be of interest (including outcomes of 
pneumonia treatments in calves, clinical cure rates of pneumonia in calves or cases of 
interdigital necrobacillosis in dairy cows), not all of these could be assessed due to 
insufficient or inappropriate on-farm records.  
Future work in this area should consider prospective evaluations of individual animal 
treatment outcomes for specific diseases over time as AM use changes, with consistent 
follow-up of cases and recording of clinical or bacteriological cures. 
Changing prescribing practice 
While HP-CIAs were used on all seven farms at the beginning of the study period, some 
farms had higher use than others, and the time taken to implement strategies to reduce HP-
CIA use also varied between farms. This may reflect, in part, both the farmers’ willingness to 
change AM use and individual VS’s willingness to alter on-farm treatment protocols or their 
own prescribing practice. The increasing uptake of prescribing changes through the study 
period may also reflect both farmers’ and VSs’ perception of responsible AM use which may 
have been influenced by increasing public, political and industry pressures regarding AM use 
in agriculture during this time. Within two years of practice-wide implementation of 
prescribing changes, however, all six of the seven study farms that were clients of the FAP at 
the start of the study period had either significantly reduced or altogether ceased use of HP-
CIAs. While changes on the majority of farms occurred over a period of time (one to two 
years), the farm that joined the practice at the end of 2013 (Farm 6) changed its use of HP-
 CIAs with immediate effect after joining the practice and initiated use of SDCT, providing 
evidence that prescribing changes can be enacted quickly on farms. The changes to 
prescribing practice demonstrated in this study were made alongside various strategies to 
improve animal management and husbandry on the farms which subsequently resulted in a 
net decrease in doses (ADD) of AMs being prescribed, despite an increase in the use of 
certain AM classes. Through the results of this study we propose that reducing the need to 
prescribe AMs by working to improve herd health, rather than forcibly avoiding the 
prescription or use of AMs, offers a sustainable way to safeguard animal health and welfare 
and maintain food production alongside reduced AM use.  It should also be considered that 
reducing AM use through the process of improved herd health has many more economic 
advantages for the farm than purely changing or reducing AM use. 
A cessation of the use of HP-CIAs and a decrease in the use of AMs within the livestock 
industry should be a key target for farmers and VSs and has been shown to be achievable 
whilst maintaining animal health, welfare and production.  
Data and analyses of the sort presented here are crucial to addressing barriers that farmers 
and VSs face when deciding to alter their AM use and provide much-needed evidence to aid a 
shift in the ‘social norm’ of AM use in production animal medicine. 
Conclusions 
This is the first study to demonstrate that dairy cattle health and welfare - as measured by 
culling rates, production parameters, fertility, udder health and mobility data - can be 
maintained, if not improved, alongside a complete cessation in the use of HP-CIAs as well as 
an overall reduction of AM use on dairy farms when prescribing practices are altered in line 
with proactive herd health planning strategies.
