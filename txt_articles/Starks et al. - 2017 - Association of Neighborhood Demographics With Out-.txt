IMPORTANCE We examined whether resuscitation care and outcomes vary by the racial
composition of the neighborhood where out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) occur.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between bystander treatments (cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and automatic external defibrillation) and timing of emergency medical services
personnel on OHCA outcomes according to the racial composition of the neighborhood
where the OHCA event occurred.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective observational cohort study examined
patients with OHCA from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011, using data from the
Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium. Neighborhoods where OHCA occurred were classified
by census tract, based on percentage of black residents: less than 25%, 25% to 50%, 51% to
75%, or more than 75%. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression modeling examined the
association between racial composition of neighborhoods and OHCA survival, adjusting for
patient, neighborhood, and treatment characteristics.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Survival to discharge, return of spontaneous circulation on
emergency department arrival, and favorable neurologic status at discharge.
RESULTS We examined 22 816 adult patients with nontraumatic OHCA at Resuscitation
Outcomes Consortium sites in the United States. The median age of patients with OHCA was
64 years (interquartile range [IQR], 51-78). Compared with patients who experienced OHCA
in neighborhoods with a lower proportion of black residents, those in neighborhoods with
more than 75% black residents were slightly younger, were more frequently women, had
lower rates of initial shockable rhythm, and less frequently experienced OHCA in a public
location. The percentage of patients with OHCA receiving bystander cardiopulmonary
resuscitation or a lay automatic external defibrillation was inversely associated with the
percentage of black residents in neighborhoods. Compared with OHCA in predominantly
white neighborhoods (<25% black), those with OHCA in mixed to majority black
neighborhoods had lower adjusted survival rates to hospital discharge (25%-50% black: odds
ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93; 51%-75% black: odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.90; >75%
black: odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50-0.79; P < .001). There was similar mortality risk for black
and white patients with OHCA in each neighborhood racial quantile. When the primary model
included geographic site, there was an attenuated nonsignificant association between racial
composition in a neighborhood and survival.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Those with OHCA in predominantly black neighborhoods had
the lowest rates of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automatic external
defibrillation use and significantly lower likelihood for survival compared with predominantly
white neighborhoods. Improving bystander treatments in these neighborhoods may improve
cardiac arrest survival.

pproximately 350 000 patients experience out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) each year in the United
States.1 Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rate is
8.3% to 10% annually1,2; however, there is regional variation
in the incidence of and survival from OHCA.3,4 The incidence
ofOHCAhasbeenconsistentlyhigherinblackindividualscom-
pared with white individuals in the United States.5-9 Notable
disparities exist in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) train-
ing and the use of bystander CPR in predominantly black vs
white communities.2,5,10 Studies examining differences in sur-
vivalamongblackandwhiteindividualswhoexperienceOHCA
have produced conflicting results.8,9,11-15 Although there has
been robust research that black neighborhoods have lower by-
stander CPR,10 there has been limited comprehensive exami-
nation of whether the racial composition of black residents in
a neighborhood is associated with other bystander treat-
ments, emergency medical services (EMS) processes of care,
and OHCA outcomes, to our knowledge. Elucidating such an
association could help to allocate finite national and local re-
sources to areas in most need of improved training, care, and
outcomes. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC)
registry16 is a large OHCA registry with consecutive case cap-
ture. Using ROC data, we sought to determine whether differ-
encesincareandoutcomesexistinpredominantlyblackneigh-
borhoods vs neighborhoods with a lower proportion of black
residents.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
From January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011, we conducted a
retrospective observational cohort study using data from the
ROC Cardiac Arrest Epidemiologic Registry, which is a pro-
spective,multicenter,observationalregistryofconsecutivepa-
tients with nontraumatic OHCA from 7 US sites (Birmingham,
Alabama; Dallas–Fort Worth, Texas; Pittsburgh, Pennsylva-
nia; Portland, Oregon; San Diego, California; Seattle and King
County, Washington; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and 3 Cana-
dian sites (British Columbia, Ottawa, Toronto).16 In the United
States and Canada, ROC Cardiac Arrest Epidemiologic Regis-
try covers a service area population of 23.7 million people and
involves 264 EMS agencies and 287 receiving hospitals.17
Information on each patient was collected from EMS and
hospital records using standardized definitions, which in-
cluded Utstein data elements. Data were collected by trained
personnel who followed uniform procedures to ensure valid-
ity and reproducibility. Site-specific quality assurance in-
cluded initial and continuing education of EMS personnel data
collection. The data coordinating center ensured data quality
by using range and logic checks in web-based data entry forms
and the batch upload process, systematically reviewing data
to uncover inconsistencies, reviewing randomly selected rec-
ords to confirm accuracy of data entry, and conducting an-
nual site visits.3
Participating sites obtained institutional review board ap-
proval to conduct this research with a waiver of written con-
sent under the Common Rule minimal risk criteria. The reg-
istry was approved by a central institutional review board at
the University of Washington with concurrent approval at 100
US institutional review board sites.
Study Population
We characterized EMS-treated adult patients with OHCA (aged
≥18 years) as those who received an attempt at external defi-
brillation by lay responders or emergency personnel or re-
ceived chest compressions by EMS personnel.16 We excluded
patients with OHCA who were assessed by EMS personnel but
not treated, including cases where there was (1) clear evi-
dence confirming death (eg, rigor mortis); (2) a “do not at-
tempt resuscitation” directive; or (3) a compelling reason that
included extensive history of terminal or intractable disease
orarequestfromthepatient’
sfamilynottotreat.Patientswere
also excluded if they were participating in an active ROC clini-
cal trial (n = 7) during the study period. Canadian ROC sites
were excluded from this analysis because of differences in ra-
cial and ethnic make-up, as well as different census tract dis-
tributions from the United States.18
Geospatial Information
TheaddresseswhereanOHCAoccurredwerestandardizedand
geocoded, then assigned to the appropriate US census tract;
these are traditionally used as proxies for neighborhoods be-
cause they typically represent socially and economically ho-
mogeneous groups of approximately 1200 to 8000
individuals.19 We geocoded approximately 99% of the ROC co-
hort population. Neighborhood-level demographic informa-
tion (race), socioeconomic status (median household income
andpercentageofindividualswithcollegeeducation),andgeo-
graphic information (percentage of rural populations) were as-
signed to each census tract using the 2000 Decennial Census
information. Choropleth maps of census tracts from the 7 ROC
sites were created using neighborhood race and OHCA sur-
vival to hospital discharge.
Primary Variable
The primary independent variable was the percentage of black
residents living in each neighborhood (ie, census tract), as de-
fined by demographic data collected from the census. For the
Key Points
Question Is the racial composition of neighborhoods associated
with bystander treatments, emergency medical services processes
of care, and survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest?
Findings In this cohort study of 22 816 patients with
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests across 2543 census tracts between
2008 and 2011, we found that out-of-hospital cardiac arrests
occurring in mixed to majority black neighborhoods had lower
survival to discharge compared with neighborhoods composed of
less than 25% black residents.
Meaning Directing attention toward improving education and
treatment of cardiac arrest in predominantly black neighborhoods
may save lives.

 primary analysis, the cohort was divided into the following
quantiles according to proportion of black residents in a neigh-
borhood: less than 25%, 25% to 50%, 51% to 75%, or more than
75%. We also modeled neighborhood black race continu-
ously (per 5–percentage point change).
Key Variables
Covariates of interest included the age, sex, witnessed OHCA
status, initial cardiac rhythm, bystander CPR status, location
of arrest (public or private), and lay use of automatic exter-
nal defibrillation (AED) before EMS arrival. Neighborhood
census tract covariates included median household income,
percentage of residents with a college degree, and rural
populations.
Emergency medical services processes of care included
time from call to first EMS professional at the scene (defined
by arrival to the OHCA location), time from call to first ad-
vanced life support professional on the scene, EMS arrival to
rhythm check, EMS arrival to first shock, EMS arrival to first
returnofspontaneouscirculation(ROSC),EMSarrivaltoceased
efforts(ie,terminationofresuscitation),andEMSarrivaltohos-
pital transport. Initial rhythm was determined with either a
manual defibrillator or an AED with a built-in computer algo-
rithm capable of classifying the patient’
s initial rhythm as re-
sembling ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia (ie,
shockable) or not (ie, nonshockable). For this analysis, ven-
tricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and shockable
rhythmsweregroupedtogetherintoa“ventriculartachycardia/
ventricular fibrillation” category. Pulseless electrical activ-
ity;asystole;andno-shock,no-stripweregroupedtogetherinto
the nonshockable category. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
processes included compression depth and rate. These pro-
cess data were measured by commercially available monitor
defibrillators during attempted resuscitation.20 Study-site co-
ordinators and internal study monitoring committees au-
dited these data for accuracy.
Outcomes Measures
The primary outcome of interest was survival to hospital dis-
charge among all patients within each census tract. Second-
ary outcomes included ROSC at emergency department (ED)
arrival and favorable neurologic status at discharge. The lat-
ter was defined as discharged alive with a modified Rankin
Scale score of 3 or less.21,22 Patients who died before dis-
charge were assigned a modified Rankin Scale score of 6. The
modified Rankin Scale score was assessed by trained individu-
als who reviewed the hospital clinical record.20
Statistical Analysis
We examined variability in census tract and individual-level
patient and cardiac arrest characteristics, EMS process of
care time intervals, and outcomes for patients with OHCA.
For the primary analysis, we defined quantiles by ordering
census tracts from lowest to highest by the proportion of
black residents in each tract. We compared patient and
neighborhood factors with EMS processes of care across
quantiles using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables
and χ2 tests for categorical variables. Trends across unad-
justed outcomes were compared across quantiles using the
Cochran-Armitage trend test.
Multilevel mixed-effects logistic models with a hierarchi-
cal approach were used to assess the association between
neighborhood race and OHCA outcomes. This model was cho-
sen given the hierarchical nature of the data with clustering
ofpatientswithincensustracts.Weadjustedforpatient,neigh-
borhood socioeconomic status, and bystander factors, as well
as EMS response intervals. Variables included in the models
wereneighborhoodracequantiles,patientage(<40,40-65,>65
years) and sex, bystander CPR and/or AED use, advanced life
support response time (<6 vs ≥6 minutes), EMS response time
(<5 vs ≥5 minutes), witness status (none, EMS, bystander, un-
known), location of OHCA (public vs private), initial rhythm
(shockable vs nonshockable), median household income (per
$10 0000 change), rural population (per 5–percentage point
change), and percentage with a college degree (per 5–percent-
age point change). There was multiple collinearity with by-
stander CPR and bystander AED use, so these treatments were
added to models as a combined categorical variable.
Furthermore, we explored whether associations be-
tween neighborhood racial composition on outcomes per-
sisted after adjusting for ROC geographic site. Finally, we ex-
amined a prior designated subgroup analysis by the presence
or absence of a shockable rhythm.
In a sensitivity analysis, we sought to determine whether
black vs white patients with OHCA had different survival in
each neighborhood race quantile. This was performed through
interactiontesting(neighborhoodblackrace × individualOHCA
race [black vs white]). Because of the high missing rate for
OHCA race (48.5%), we restricted the cohort population only
to patients with OHCA who had race and ethnicity identified.
We ran the model without race to ensure that neighborhood
effect remained after excluding patients with missing infor-
mation. We then added individual race as an independent vari-
able in the model, along with neighborhood race (as the pri-
mary dependent variable), as well as other confounders.
Finally, the interaction term was added to the primary model
to assess the differential impact of individual race on the as-
sociation between neighborhood race and survival.
Allstatisticaltestswere2-sided,withP<.05indicatingsta-
tistical significance. No adjustments were made for multiple
comparisons. Analyses were performed using Stata Release 11
(StataCorp).
Results
We analyzed 22 816 patients with OHCA from 2543 census
tracts. The median age of patients was 64 years (interquartile
range [IQR], 51-78), 13 982 were men (61.3%), 4915 had a shock-
able initial rhythm (21.5%), 3069 had a cardiac arrest that oc-
curred in a public location (13.5%), and 8316 had a bystander-
witnessed event (36.4%) (Table 1). Bystander CPR was
performed in 9012 patients (39.5%), and bystander AED use
before EMS arrival was performed in 938 (4.1%). The median
percentage of black residents in US ROC neighborhoods was
4.5%,andthemedianhouseholdincomewas$40 598(Table1).

 The median percentage of black residents in the United States
is 3.0%,2 and the median household income was $42 148 in
2000.23
In neighborhoods with a higher percentage of black resi-
dents, patients with OHCA were more likely to be young and
were less likely to be men, have an initial shockable rhythm,
experience OHCA in a public location, or have a bystander-
witnessed event (Table 1). With a higher percentage of black
residents in the neighborhood, the percentage of patients with
OHCA who received bystander CPR and lay AED use de-
creased(Figure).Similarly,medianhouseholdincomesandcol-
legeeducationdecreasedwithahigherpercentageofblackresi-
dents in the neighborhood (Table 1).
Emergency medical services process of care times varied
amongneighborhoodracequantiles(Table1).Theintervalfrom
dispatchcalltoEMSarrivalwasshorterforneighborhoodswith
a higher percentage of black residents. Time from EMS arrival
to hospital transport was also shorter for neighborhoods with
a higher percentage of black residents. Compared with other
neighborhoods, time from EMS arrival to first ROSC was lon-
gestinneighborhoodswithmorethan75%blackresidents,and
EMS personnel spent more time in black neighborhoods with
more than 75% black residents before ceasing resuscitation ef-
forts (Table 1). Compared with other neighborhoods, time to
first defibrillation was longer for patients in neighborhoods
with more than 75% black residents, but for patients with
shockable rhythms, time to ceased efforts was shortest in
neighborhoods with more than 75% black residents (Table 1
and eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Overall, 6343 of 22 816 patients had ROSC at ED arrival
(27.8%). The percentage of patients with OHCA who had ROSC
at ED arrival decreased for neighborhoods with a higher per-
centage of black residents (Table 2). Survival to discharge was
11.1% (2528 of 22 816) for the overall cohort. Unadjusted sur-
vival to discharge rates decreased for neighborhoods with a
higher percentage of black residents (Table 2 and eFigure in
the Supplement). Favorable neurologic status at discharge fol-
lowed similar patterns to ROSC at ED arrival and survival to
discharge (Table 2).
After adjustment, patients with OHCA in neighborhoods
with a higher percentage of black residents experienced lower
survival to hospital discharge (>75% black residents: odds ra-
tio [OR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.82; 51%-75% black residents: OR,
0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.93; and 25%-50% black residents: OR,
0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93; P = .001) compared with neighbor-
hoods with less than 25% black residents (Table 3 and eTable
2 and eTable 3 in the Supplement for full model). A similar in-
verse association was demonstrated for favorable neurologic
status at discharge (>75% black residents: OR, 0.56; 95% CI,
0.38-0.82; 51%-75% black residents: OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.50-

0.94; P < .001) for predominantly black neighborhoods com-

as well as ROSC at ED arrival (>75% black residents: OR, 0.47;
95% CI, 0.39-0.55; 51%-75% black residents: OR, 0.58; 95% CI,
0.47-0.73; and 25%-50% black residents: OR, 0.66; 95% CI,
0.56-0.78; P < .001) (Table 3 and eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). When neighborhood race was modeled continuously,
every 5–percentage point increase in neighborhood black resi-
dents was associated with 0.97 adjusted odds (95% CI, 0.96-
0.98) for survival to discharge.
There were significant differences in the proportion of
black residents living in census tracts among geographic sites
in ROC (eFigure and eTable 4 in the Supplement). In a sensi-
tivity analysis in which ROC geographic site was included as a
covariate, survival to hospital discharge was not significantly
different between neighborhoods with a higher percentage of
black residents compared with neighborhoods with less than
25% black residents (Table 3).

and survival to discharge after accounting for individual race
(Table 3). Within each neighborhood race quantile, black and
white patients with OHCA had similar mortality risk (interac-
tion P = .80; Table 3). Patients with OHCA who had shockable

of ROSC at ED arrival, survival to discharge, and favorable neu-
rologic status at discharge across all quantiles compared with
patients with nonshockable rhythms (Table 2 and Table 3 and
eTable 2 in the Supplement). The association between pro-
portion of black residents in a neighborhood and survival dif-
fered by initial rhythm. There was a greater magnitude of dis-
parity in outcomes among neighborhoods with more than 75%
black residents compared with neighborhoods with less than
25% black residents among patients with a shockable rhythm
compared with those with a nonshockable rhythm (interac-
tion P < .001).
Discussion
Patients with OHCA with any initial rhythm in neighbor-
hoods with higher percentages of black residents had lower
rates of bystander CPR and AED use and were significantly less

 likely to achieve ROSC at ED arrival, survive to hospital dis-
charge, or have favorable neurologic status at discharge com-
pared with patients who experienced OHCA in predomi-
nantly white neighborhoods. Despite lower survival in
predominantly black neighborhoods, survival was no differ-
ent for black and white patients having a cardiac arrest in any
neighborhoods. Greater differences were observed among
those with an initial shockable rhythm than an initial non-
shockable rhythm. Because patients with shockable rhythms
can immediately be treated with an AED and are associated
with higher survival, these differences may be modifiable. The
association between neighborhood race and survival was not
significant after adjusting for geographic site.
To our knowledge, prior investigations examining treat-
ments and outcomes for OHCA have focused on the race of the
individual. Nonetheless, such analyses are difficult to inter-
pret because patient race is typically missing on a large num-
ber of patient records in cardiac arrest registries.24 Prior his-
torical investigations of racial disparities have produced
conflicting results,8,9,12,15,25 but most demonstrate large dis-
parities in outcomes for black vs white patients.8,9,11,25 We spe-
cifically focused our investigation on the demographic char-
acteristics of the neighborhoods in which the OHCA events
occurred to understand whether neighborhood racial compo-
sition was associated with bystander treatments, EMS pro-
cesses of care, and OHCA outcomes.
We found that in neighborhoods with a higher propor-
tion of black residents, the use of bystander treatments de-
creased. Bystander CPR is consistently lower among black in-
dividualsandinblackcommunities.15,24-26Sassonetal24found
that bystander CPR was lowest in low-income neighbor-
hoods composed of more than 80% black residents with an ad-
justed odds of bystander CPR less than half that of high-
income neighborhoods composed of more than 80% white
residents. We also found that bystander CPR rates decreased
in a stepwise fashion with a higher proportion of black resi-
dents living in a community. A prior qualitative study27 in 3
primarily black high-risk neighborhoods (high OCHA inci-
dence, low bystander CPR) identified the following barriers to
performing CPR: not recognizing a cardiac arrest and lack of
knowledge with performing CPR, fear of litigation, personal
health risks, and feeling disconnected from community mem-
bers. Barriers to CPR training in these communities included
costofCPRtraining,lackofknowledgeaboutcardiacarrestand
CPR,competingpriorities,andhealthconcernsassociatedwith
performing CPR.27
Bystander AED use has rarely been examined in studies
seekingtounderstandhealthdisparitiesinOHCA,toourknowl-
edge. We found that rates of bystander AED use were low over-
all, but there was wide disparity in AED use according to the
community’
s racial composition. Bystanders in communities
with more than 75% black residents were 5 times less likely to
use an AED prior to EMS arrival compared with communities
with less than 25% black residents. Partly contributing to this
disparity is that as the percentage of black residents in a neigh-
borhood increased, OHCAs were less likely to occur in a pub-
lic location where an AED could be available. However, even
in public locations, predominantly black neighborhoods had
less AED use (11.3% in neighborhoods with <25% black resi-
dents, 5.6% in neighborhoods with >75% black residents) com-
pared with other communities. Other reasons for this dispar-
ity may be general lack of AED availability in black
communities, or lack of general education about cardiac ar-
rest and possible treatments in primarily black neighbor-
hoods compared with other neighborhoods.
Multiple previous studies have shown that EMS response
times are either similar or shorter for black vs white individu-
als with cardiac arrest.8,9,25 We found that OHCA occurring in

 rhythms in neighborhoods with more than 75% black resi-
dents compared with neighborhoods with less than 25% black
residents. It remains unclear why it takes longer to provide an
initial shock in predominantly black communities, especially
with better EMS arrival times. Some reasons may be related
toOHCAsoccurringinapartmentcomplexesorhigh-risebuild-
ings where it may take longer to get to the patient.28 What also
remains unclear is why there are shorter resuscitation times
in patients with OHCA with shockable rhythms for predomi-
nantlyblackcommunities,particularlywhentimetoROSCwas
longer for patients in black communities. Evidence-based cri-
teria for advanced life support termination of resuscitation
rules exist,29,30 but we did not evaluate whether such criteria
were applied consistently across communities.
We found that OHCAs occurring in black neighborhoods
have lower rates of ROSC at ED arrival, survival to hospital dis-
charge, and lower favorable neurologic status at discharge. Af-
ter adjustment for known common correlates of outcome, a
higher proportion of black residents in a neighborhood was in-
dependently associated with worse outcomes. Socioeco-
nomic status did not attenuate the association between black
communities and outcomes of OHCA, as previously observed
in other studies.15,31-33 In a sensitivity analysis, black patients
and white patients with OHCA had similar survival in each
neighborhood. These findings suggest that urgent attention
should be directed toward improving education and treat-
ment of patients with cardiac arrest in predominantly black
neighborhoods.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, our observational
data demonstrate an association between neighborhood
race and survival, but this association does not prove causa-
tion. Second, unmeasured confounders may have played a
role in our observed adjusted association between neigh-
borhood race and outcomes. Third, our sensitivity analysis
examining individual race should be interpreted with cau-
tion. As with other large data sets of OHCA, information
about race was missing in approximately half (49.5%) of
patients. Although individual race was not the focus of our
analysis, we believe it was important to shed light on
whether black patients and white patients with OHCA had
the same survival rates in predominantly black neighbor-
hoods. Fourth, we did not evaluate the individual compo-
nents of EMS care, such as endotracheal intubation and
drug use. Fifth, it is well established that there are geo-
graphic variations in survival after OHCA across the United
States. We assessed the racial composition of neighbor-
hoods because it was a significant and important contribu-
tor to survival. When we adjusted for geographic site in
addition to accounting for census tract, this association was
attenuated and nonsignificant. Experts may disagree
whether it is preferable to adjust only for small areas (ie,
census tract) or both small and large areas (ie, geographic
site). We defined a priori adjustment for small areas as our
primary analysis given concern for overadjustment with
census tract and geographic site in the models. Importantly,
most of the black neighborhoods clustered in 4 sites.
Because 3 of the sites with higher survival had no census
tracts with more than 75% black residents (and few with
51%-75% black residents), we are further limited in our abil-
ity to evaluate the association between racial composition
and survival after OHCA. Finally, 2000 census data were
used for this analysis because ROC sites did not uniformly
adopt 2010 census data until 2012. Although census vari-
ables may slightly differ between reporting periods, using
the 2000 census data ensured that all patients had consis-
tent and uniform reporting.
Conclusions
Bystander treatments and survival after OHCA are signifi-
cantly lower in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of
black residents. Black and white patients with OHCA had simi-
lar survival in each neighborhood quantile. Novel education
and implementation efforts are needed to improve resuscita-
tion outcomes in these neighborhoods.

Neighborhood-Level Disparities in Resuscitation
and the Potential of Connected Health

In 1999, Iwashyna et al1 reported significant variation in rates
of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) delivery based on the
racial composition of neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois. Pa-
tients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) living in
racially integrated neighbor-
hoods had the highest likeli-
hood of receiving CPR, fol-
lowed by those living in
predominatelywhiteneighborhoods.Conversely,patientswith
OHCA living in predominantly black neighborhoods had the
lowestratesofCPRprovision.Atthetime,thesefindingsraised
fundamental questions concerning unequal access to the life-
saving treatment of CPR. Nearly 20 years later, little has
changed and considerable racial disparities in OHCA resusci-
tation care and outcomes persist.
In this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Starks et al2 demon-
strate a strong and compelling association between geogra-
phy, neighborhood racial composition, and outcomes. This
comprehensive study used data from the Resuscitation Out-
comes Consortium Cardiac Arrest Epidemiologic Registry, an
observational registry of consecutive OHCA occurring in 7 sites
in the United States and 3 in Canada. Among 22 816 cases of
OHCA in the United States from 2008 to 2011, patients in pre-
dominately black neighborhoods had the lowest rates of CPR,
automated external defibrillator (AED) use, and survival com-
pared with patients in predominantly white neighborhoods.
This well-designed study highlights the inability of the US
health care system to provide equitable care for patients re-
gardless of their race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. The
tools for appropriate OHCA response are widely available and
scientifically proven: CPR and AEDs save lives. Too little fo-
cus has been placed on reducing barriers to access across di-
verse communities. Advancing the field of resuscitation sci-

for vulnerable populations and instead focus on implement-
ing practices that reduce and/or eliminate disparities. Given
the lack of progress in the past 20 years, creative efforts and
novel interventions are imperative.

nologies to increase access and implementation of effective
therapies for OHCA.3 One of the most significant changes over
the past decade has been the enhanced connectedness of in-
dividuals through digital platforms, such as social media, and
technologies, such as mobile telephones. The digital divide is
narrowing as access to these tools increases across socioeco-
nomic groups, generations, and geographic regions. The pres-
ence of personalized technology and online networks does not
inevitably translate into their use in health emergencies, but
it offers the promise of reaching diverse populations in ways

can engage people outside of traditional health care environ-
ments and use the every day tools used on a daily basis to ac-
cess food, housing, leisure, and other social services. Several
digital strategies—mobile telephones, social networks, and
drone technologies—are particularly promising and are out-
lined below. These technologies could be uniquely effective

Mobile Telephones
Increasing the network of potential CPR responders through
the use of mobile technologies can improve the likelihood of
bystander response to OHCA. Ringh et al5 used a mobile tele-
phone positioning system that was triggered when emer-
gency medical services were dispatched, thereby alerting
trained laypersons to respond to patients with OHCA. This sys-
tem demonstrated a considerable increase in bystander CPR
rates (64%) when compared with controls (48%). Similar ef-
forts led by PulsePoint (http://www.pulsepoint.org) have
focused on using smartphones to alert bystanders to respond
in emergencies and the location of nearby AEDs.6 Through
mobile telephones, crowdsourcing, and promotion of
motivational stories of real people saving lives, this technology
empowers laypersons to act in emergencies.
