Abstract
Background—How coffee consumption relates to mortality in diverse European populations, 
with variable coffee preparation methods and customs, is unclear.
Objectives—To examine whether coffee consumption is associated with all-cause and cause-
specific mortality in men and women.
Design—Prospective cohort study.
Setting—Ten European countries.
Participants—A total of 521,330 men and women enrolled in the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).
Main outcome measure—Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals(CIs) estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. The association of 
coffee with serum biomarkers of liver function, inflammation, and metabolic health was evaluated 
in the EPIC Biomarkers sub-cohort (n=14,800).

 Results—During a mean follow-up of 16.4 years, 41,693 deaths occurred. Compared with non-
consumers, participants in the highest quartile of coffee consumption experienced statistically 
significant lower all-cause mortality (Men: HR=0.88, 95%CI: 0.82–0.95; P-trend<0.001; Women: 
HR=0.93, 95%CI: 0.87–0.98; P-trend=0.009). These findings did not vary significantly by 
country. Inverse associations were observed for digestive disease mortality for men (HR=0.41, 
95%CI: 0.32–0.54; P-trend<0.0001) and women (HR=0.60, 95%CI: 0.46–0.78; P-trend<0.0001). 
Among women only, there was a statistically significant inverse association between coffee and 
circulatory disease mortality, (HR=0.78, 95%CI: 0.68–0.90; P-trend<0.001), cerebrovascular 
disease mortality (HR=0.70, 95%CI: 0.55–0.90; P-trend=0.002), and a positive association 
between coffee and ovarian cancer mortality (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02–1.23 P-trend 0.001). In the 
EPIC-biomarkers sub-cohort, higher coffee consumption was associated with lower serum alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and C-reactive protein.
Limitation—Reverse causality may have led to spurious findings; however, results did not differ 
following exclusion of participants who died within 8-years of baseline. The study is also limited 
by a single assessment of coffee drinking habits at baseline.
Conclusions—These results confirm prior findings on the reduced risk of mortality associated 
with coffee drinking but additionally show that this relationship does not vary by country where 
coffee preparation and drinking habits may differ. The study also reports novel inverse 
relationships between coffee drinking and digestive disease mortality.
Introduction
Coffee is one of the most commonly consumed beverages with an estimated 2.25 billion 
cups consumed per day worldwide. Coffee drinking provides exposure to a range of 
biologically-active compounds, including many with antioxidant activity (1), and higher 
coffee consumption has also been linked with lower levels of inflammation (2, 3), insulin 
resistance, and reduced risk of diabetes (4–6). Initial studies investigating the relationship 
between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality risk were of limited size and reported 
inconsistent results (7–9). However, recent U.S. based studies have reported that higher 
coffee consumption was related to lower all-cause mortality risk (10–12). In the NIH-AARP 
study, 10% and 15% lower all-cause mortality risks were observed in men and women, 
respectively, when individuals consuming more than 6 cups per day were compared with 
non-consumers (10). Further, a prospective investigation in Japan also reported inverse 
associations between coffee drinking and mortality risk (13). To date, a large European 
based analysis of coffee and mortality risk has not been undertaken.
For cause-specific mortality, findings on coffee drinking and cardiovascular disease 
mortality have been somewhat mixed (14–17), though recently, the aforementioned NIH-
AARP study, and a meta-analysis, reported a lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality 
for high-consumers of coffee compared with non-consumers (10, 18). Coffee drinking has 
not generally been associated with mortality from cancer (8, 10, 16, 18), while for other 
chronic diseases, such as digestive and respiratory disease mortality, limited data are 
available.

 We investigated the association of coffee consumption with risks of all-cause and cause-
specific mortality in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
(EPIC) – a large prospective cohort comprising more than 520,000 participants from ten 
countries. Our multi-center study design meant that inter-country coffee preparation methods 
and customs are captured unlike any study to date. In addition, to gain insight into potential 
biological pathways that may be influenced by coffee drinking; we investigated the 
association of coffee with serum biomarkers of liver function, inflammation, and metabolic 
health in a sub-cohort of EPIC participants and their association with all-cause mortality.
Methods
Study population
EPIC is an on-going multicenter prospective cohort study of 521,330 participants, mostly 
aged 35 years or above, who were recruited in 1992–2000. A detailed description of the 
methods employed has previously been described (19, 20). This current study includes data 
from participants recruited, predominantly from the general population, in 10 European 
countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden 
and United Kingdom; Supplemental Materials). Written informed consent was provided by 
all study participants. Ethical approval for the EPIC study was provided from the review 
boards of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and local participating centers. 
Exclusions prior to the onset of the analyses included: participants who reported, at baseline, 
cancer (n=22,537), heart disease (n=12,619), stroke (n=3,683), or diabetes (n=12,461); 
participants in the highest and lowest 1% of the distribution for the ratio between energy 
intake to estimated energy requirement (n=8,828); and participants with missing coffee 
consumption and follow-up information (n=9,459). This analysis, therefore, included 
451,743 participants (130,662 men, 321,081 women).
Diet, lifestyle, and anthropometric information collection
Dietary intake was assessed by a number of different instruments that had been developed 
and validated in a series of studies within the various source populations participating in 
EPIC (19, 20). The dietary assessment methods selected for individual centers reflected the 
results of these methodological studies and took into consideration the local context. Self-
administered questionnaires were used in all centers, except in Greece, Spain, and Ragusa 
(Italy), where data were collected at a personal interview. In Malmo (Sweden), a method 
combining a short non-quantitative food frequency questionnaire with a 7-day dietary diary 
was used. The information on type of coffee consumed (caffeinated and decaffeinated) was 
only collected for participants from Germany, Greece, Italy (excluding Naples and Ragusa), 
the Netherlands and the UK. For other centers, information on caffeine content of coffee was 
not collected. Participants recorded the number of coffee cups per month, week, or day; the 
structure of the questions varied somewhat by country and questionnaire. Coffee 
consumption (in mL/day) was calculated using the typical sizes of coffee cups for each 
center. Lifestyle questionnaires were used to obtain information on education, smoking 
habits, alcohol, physical activity, oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy, 
menopausal status and, in five centers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use.

 Liver function, circulatory disease, and metabolic biomarker measurement
Baseline data on serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase(ALP), alanine transaminase(ALT), 
aspartate transaminase(AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase(GGT), hs-C-reactive protein 
(CRP), glycated hemoglobin(HbA1c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C), and 
lipoprotein(a) were available for the EPIC Biomarkers’ sub-cohort of 16,775 randomly-
selected participants (See Table S1 for measurement method details). After applying the 
same exclusion criteria used in the main coffee-mortality analyses, 14,800 participants 
remained.
Assessment of mortality
Data on vital status and the cause and date of death were collected at the EPIC study centers 
using record linkages with cancer registries, boards of health and death indices in Denmark, 
Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK or through active follow-up 
(inquiries by mail/telephone, municipal registries, regional health departments, physicians/
hospitals) in Germany, Greece and France. Data on causes of deaths were coded in 
accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The 
following causes of death were investigated: cancer (ICD-10:C00-D48), circulatory (I00-
I99), ischemic heart (I20-I25), cerebrovascular (I60-I69), respiratory (J30-J98), digestive 
diseases (K00-K93), external causes (S00-Y98), and suicides (X60-X84).
Statistical analysis
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox 
proportional hazards models with age as the primary time metric. Time at study entry was 
age at recruitment and exit time was age at death or the last date at which follow-up was 
considered complete in each center. Models were also stratified by age at recruitment in 1-
year categories and center to minimize departure from proportionality, and to control for 
differing follow-up procedures, questionnaire design, and other differences across centers.
To account for between-country variability in volume and concentration of the type of coffee 
locally consumed, total, caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee were modelled using country-
specific quartiles among coffee consumers, and then compared against non-consumers. 
Analyses using cup-size categories (non-consumers, <1, 1–<2, 2–<3, and 3+ cups/day) were 
also undertaken. Trend tests across exposure groups were calculated by entering the category 
variables into the Cox models as a continuous term. Continuous models (HR expressed per 
cup/day; 1 cup=237 mL) were also used. The multivariable models were adjusted for a set of 
a priori-determined covariates that included body mass index (BMI: <22, 22–24.9, 25–29.9, 
30–34.9, 35+ kg/m2); physical activity (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, 
active); smoking status and intensity (never; current, 1–15 cigarettes/day; current, 16–25 
cigarettes/day; current, 25+ cigarettes/day; former, quit ≤10 years; former, quit 11–20 years; 
former, quit 20+ years; current, pipe/cigar/occasional; current/former); smoking duration 
(<10, 10–<20, 20–<30, 30–<40, 40+ years); education (none/primary school completed, 
technical/professional school, secondary school, longer education - including university); 
menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal, perimenopausal); ever use of oral 
contraceptives; ever use of menopausal hormone therapy; alcoholic drinks (non-consumers, 
<5, 5–14.9, 15–29.9, or 30+ g of ethanol/day), total energy (kcal/day) red and processed

 meats, and fruit and vegetables (all g/day). Further adjustment for dietary intakes of fiber, 
calcium, fish, soft drinks, and NSAID use resulted in virtually unchanged risk estimates, so 
these variables were not included in the final multivariable models. The coffee-mortality 
associations were further assessed across subgroups of smoking status, BMI, physical 
activity, alcohol, red/processed meat, and fruit/vegetable consumption. Interaction terms 
(multiplicative scale) between these variables and coffee intake were included in separate 
models; the statistical significance of the cross-product terms was evaluated using the 
likelihood ratio test. Similar analyses examined associations according to follow-up time 
categories (<5 years, 5–<10 years, and ≥10 years). Heterogeneity across countries was 
explored by a meta-analytic approach (21). To evaluate possible reverse causality, sensitivity 
analyses were conducted by excluding deaths within the first 5 and 8 years of follow-up, and 
limiting analyses to participants who self-reported being in ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ health at 
baseline recruitment. In a supplementary analysis, flexible parametric survival models (22) 
were used to allow direct estimation of the conditional cumulative incidence and thus 
absolute risks of death by sex and coffee consumption categories, adjusted for other 
covariates. Within these models, we employed restricted cubic splines with three internal 
knots to model the baseline hazard using attained age as the time-scale. Model-based 
survival functions and their confidence intervals were obtained from fitted models by coffee 
consumption category and sex, with other categorical covariates set to the most common 
category, and continuous variables set to their sex-specific means.
Liver function, inflammation, and metabolic biomarker measurement
In the EPIC biomarkers sub-cohort, mean levels of serum liver function, inflammatory, and 
metabolic biomarkers were calculated for coffee consumption categories. For biomarker 
values that were non-normally distributed, data were log-transformed and geometric means 
were calculated for each coffee consumption category (see Figure 3A footnote for 
multivariable adjustments). Also in the sub-cohort, Cox proportional hazards models, using 
the same criteria as the coffee-mortality analyses, were used to assess the relationships 
between serum levels (sex-specific quartiles) of albumin, ALP, ALT, AST, GGT, CRP, 
HbA1c, HDL-C, and lipoprotein(a) with all-cause mortality (see Figure S2 footnote for 
multivariable adjustments).
All statistical tests were two-sided and a P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
Role of the Funding Source
The various funders of the EPIC study had no role in study design, conduct, or reporting of 
the results.
Results
After a mean follow-up of 16.4 years, 18,302 and 23,391 all-cause deaths were recorded 
among men and women respectively. Of the total 41,693 all-cause deaths: 18,003 were from 
cancer; 9,106 from circulatory diseases; 2,380 from cerebrovascular diseases; 3,536 from 
ischemic heart disease; 1,213 from digestive diseases; 1,589 from respiratory diseases; 1,571

 from external causes; and 418 from suicide. The mortality rates, age-adjusted to European 
standard populations (23), were 118 and 78 deaths per 10,000 person-years in men and 
women, respectively. Intakes of coffee by daily volume consumed were highest in Denmark 
(median 900 mL/day for men and women) and the Netherlands (median 625 mL/day for 
men and 500 mL/day for women) and were lowest in Italy (median 91 mL/day for men and 
93 m/L/day for women) and Spain (median 100 mL/day for men and 118 m/L/day for 
women; Table S2). Compared to non-consumers, men and women with higher reported 
coffee intakes were more likely to be younger and current smokers, and reported higher 
intakes of red and processed meats and alcohol; with lower consumption of fruit and 
vegetables (Table 1).
Coffee consumption and all-cause mortality
High coffee consumers had lower all-cause mortality risks compared to non-consumers after 
adjustments for smoking and other covariates in the multivariable models (Men: HR 
comparing highest quartile of coffee consumption with non-consumers=0.88; 95%CI: 0.82–
0.95; P-trend<0.001; Women: HR=0.93; 95% CI: 0.87–0.98; P-trend=0.009; Table 2). When 
cup-size categories were used, similar inverse associations were observed for men (≥3 
cups/day vs. non-consumers, HR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.76–0.89; P-trend<0.001) and women (≥3 
cups/day vs. non-consumers, HR=0.92, 95%CI: 0.87–0.98; P-trend<0.001) (data not 
tabulated). There was no evidence of heterogeneity by country for the association between 
coffee consumption and all-cause mortality (P-heterogeneity 0.71 for men and 0.37 for 
women). Overall, similar inverse associations and linear trends were observed for 
consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, albeit in men, the association of 
caffeinated coffee with all-cause mortality was less pronounced than for decaffeinated 
coffee, with a statistically significant lower risk not observed in the highest quartile of 
consumption (Tables S3 and S4).
Adjusted cumulative incidence curves for all-cause mortality by coffee consumption 
categories are presented in Figure S1. For men, compared to non-consumers of coffee, the 
cumulative incidence of death until age 80 years was 3.1% (95% CI: 1.74–4.53) and 2.2% 
(95% CI: 0.80–3.68) lower among those in the third and highest quartile of coffee 
consumption, respectively. For women, the cumulative incidence of death until age 80 years 
was 1.4% (95% CI: 0.55–2.28) and 0.8% (95% CI: −0.12–1.69) lower among those in the 
third and highest quartile of coffee consumption when compared against non-coffee 
consumers.
Coffee consumption and cause-specific mortality
Strong inverse associations were observed between coffee consumption and risks of 
digestive disease deaths for men (Q4 vs. non-consumers/Q1, HR=0.41, 95%CI: 0.32–0.54; 
P-trend<0.0001) and women (Q4 vs. non-consumers/Q1, HR=0.60, 95%CI: 0.46–0.78; P-
trend<0.0001) (Table 2). Similar strength inverse associations were observed when cup-size 
categories were used (data not shown). Just over one-third of digestive disease deaths were 
due to liver disease. There was a statistically significant inverse association between coffee 
and liver disease deaths (sexes combined: Q4 vs. non-consumers, HR=0.20, 95%CI: 0.13–
0.29), whereas the results of non-liver digestive disease deaths were inconclusive (sexes

 combined: Q4 vs. non-consumers, HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.56–1.16). There was a strong, inverse 
association between deaths from liver cirrhosis and coffee drinking (sexes combined: Q4 vs. 
non-consumers, HR 0.21 95% CI: 0.13–0.34. Similar inverse associations were observed for 
alcoholic and non-alcoholic cirrhosis (data not shown).
Consumption of coffee was also inversely associated with circulatory diseases; this 
association was more pronounced in women and the inverse associations were stronger for 
deaths by cerebrovascular disease (Q4 vs. non-consumers, HR=0.70, 95%CI: 0.55–0.90; P-
trend=0.002) (Table 2). In general, the associations between coffee and cause-specific 
mortality were weakened when caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee were analyzed 
separately, albeit associations were in the same direction for both coffee types (Tables S3 
and S4). The association of coffee drinking with cancer-related death was not statistically 
significant in men whereas in women a positive association was found (Q4 vs. non-
consumers, HR=1.12, 95%CI: 1.02–1.23; P-trend=0.001). In further analyses by cancer site, 
we observed a statistically significant positive association between coffee and ovarian 
cancer-specific mortality (Q4 vs. non-consumers, HR=1.31, 95% CI, 1.07–1.61) in a 
multivariable model that included smoking and other risk factors (Table S5). There were also 
suggestive positive associations between coffee and mortality from colorectal and lung 
cancer in women, whereas in men, there were statistically significant inverse associations 
between low-medium consumption of coffee and lung cancer mortality (Table S5). Coffee 
drinking was statistically significantly inversely associated with liver cancer mortality in 
both men and women. Respiratory disease mortality was not related to coffee consumption 
in the full models (Table 2). Coffee consumption was not associated with deaths caused by 
external causes; however, an inverse relationship was observed between suicide and coffee 
for men, but not women (Table 2).
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
Smoking was the most influential confounder for the all-cause mortality analyses (Table 2); 
however, because smoking is positively associated with both coffee consumption and risk of 
death, confounding in this case would obscure a possible reduction in risk associated with 
coffee. As expected, statistical adjustment for smoking strengthened the association between 
coffee and reduced risk of death. Inverse all-cause mortality associations with coffee 
consumption were observed among never smokers, and across subgroups of other mortality 
risk factors (Figure 1). Similarly, among never smokers, inverse coffee associations were 
observed for deaths caused by cancer, circulatory diseases, digestive diseases, and 
respiratory diseases (Table S6).
No heterogeneity of the all-cause mortality associations was observed according to follow-
up time categories (Table S7). The all-cause and cause-specific mortality associations were 
virtually unchanged when deaths which occurred during the first 5 and 8 years of follow-up 
were excluded (Tables S8 and S9). Similar associations were also observed when analyses 
were limited to individuals who reported being in ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ health at baseline 
(n=119,609 participants; Table S10), and when analyses were limited to sole consumers of 
caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee only (data not shown).

 Serum levels of liver, inflammation and metabolic biomarkers by coffee consumption
In the EPIC-Biomarkers sub-cohort, compared to non-coffee and/or low consumers, higher 
coffee consumers had statistically significantly lower mean levels of the liver enzymes ALP, 
ALT, AST, and GGT, lower levels of CRP, and higher serum albumin (all P-trends<0.05; 
Table 3). For women only, higher coffee consumption was correlated with lower serum 
HbA1c, lipoprotein (a), and higher HDL-C. A total of 891 all-cause deaths were recorded in 
the EPIC-Biomarkers sub-cohort. Serum levels of ALP, AST, GGT, and CRP were 
associated with all-cause mortality when the highest and lowest quartiles were compared 
(Figure S2). Higher serum levels of albumin and ALT were associated with lower all-cause 
mortality.
Discussion
In this large-scale analysis of a multi-country European population, higher consumption of 
coffee was associated with lower risks of death, and in particular, mortality due to digestive 
and circulatory diseases. The inverse association between all-cause mortality and coffee was 
generally apparent for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption. Coffee 
drinking was also associated with variation in serum biomarkers of liver function, 
inflammation, insulin sensitivity and blood lipids; additionally, these same biomarkers were 
also associated with all-cause mortality, adding some degree of biological plausibility to the 
potential protective effects of coffee on common health outcomes.
The relation between coffee drinking and mortality has been investigated in numerous 
smaller studies, with mixed results reported (7–9). Consistent with the current investigation, 
prospective studies in Japan and the U.S. have published inverse associations between coffee 
consumption and all-cause mortality (10–13, 16, 17). The current investigation was the 
largest worldwide study to date to examine the coffee and mortality relationship, and the 
first comprehensive European based investigation. Previous European studies were of much 
smaller size and based within individual countries, where coffee intakes and preparation 
methods are relatively homogenous. In contrast, our analysis of EPIC data from 10 
European countries with ~42,000 documented deaths would have captured the inter-country 
coffee preparation methods and customs unlike any other study to date. Similar to the 
findings from the NIH-AARP analysis, our observed inverse association between coffee and 
all-cause mortality was consistent across subgroups of other lifestyle, anthropometric and 
dietary variables and was apparent for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. The 
caffeinated and decaffeinated data should, however, be interpreted cautiously as 
decaffeinated coffee consumption were very low in several of the populations included in 
EPIC and separate information for decaffeinated coffee was not collected in all EPIC 
centers. Further, the analyses may be contaminated by participants habitually consuming 
both types of coffee. Nevertheless, in sensitivity analyses, where only sole-consumers of 
caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee were analyzed, the associations remained essentially 
unaltered.
Our results revealed that coffee consumption was strongly inversely associated with liver 
disease mortality. Previous studies have reported inverse associations between coffee and 
both alcoholic and non-alcoholic cirrhosis development (24–26). With the largest number of

 liver disease cases to date, our results are consistent with these smaller studies. Serum levels 
of several indicators of altered hepatic function-including the enzymes ALP, ALT, AST, and 
GGT were lower among coffee drinkers compared to non-consumers/low consumers in the 
current analysis - observations that were consistent with prior data (24, 27); suggesting that 
coffee drinking may potentially have beneficial effects on hepatic function and health. 
Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that caffeine has anti-fibrotic effects on 
hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (28). In hepatocytes, caffeine has been demonstrated to 
lower levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) which activates connective tissue 
growth factor, a potent fibrogenic promoting molecule (29). In hepatic stellate cells (HSC), 
which when activated are a major driver of liver fibrosis, caffeine has also been shown to 
exert anti-fibrotic effects by lowering proliferation, stimulating apoptosis, and inhibiting 
adhesion (30). Coffee has also been demonstrated to impede progression of fatty liver 
disease by reducing fat accumulation, oxidative stress and liver inflammation in murine 
models (31), and a possible beneficial role for coffee on liver disease progression in 
hepatitis-C patients has also been reported (32).
The observed inverse associations between coffee drinking and mortality from circulatory 
disease are consistent with the prior NIH-AARP analysis (10). We note that this relation was 
stronger among women than men with the difference between sexes driven by a strong 
inverse association for cerebrovascular mortality risk in women; a finding consistent with 
previous studies which reported lower incidence of stroke in women consuming coffee (33, 
34). Interestingly, levels of HDL-C, which has been inversely related to risks of stroke and 
other circulatory disease outcomes (35), were higher among coffee drinkers compared to 
non-consumers in women but not in men. Further, among women only, lipoprotein(a), CRP, 
and HbA1c – factors that have been positively associated with cardiovascular disease 
outcomes (36–39) - were generally lower among coffee drinkers compared to non-
consumers. Given that the inverse relation between coffee drinking and circulatory disease 
mortality was primarily restricted to females, it may be hypothesized that this association 
might be driven by female-specific beneficial effects of coffee on lipid, inflammatory, and 
metabolic profiles.
Interestingly, we observed a positive association between coffee drinking and overall cancer 
mortality among women in this population. This relationship was primarily driven by a 
statistically significant positive association between coffee and mortality from ovarian 
cancer, with suggestive positive associations for lung and colorectal cancer. To our 
knowledge, there is no strong hypothesis on why coffee drinking should specifically raise 
the risk of death from ovarian cancer. While this result may be spurious and requires follow-
up in additional studies on ovarian cancer survival, we note that a positive association 
between coffee consumption and ovarian cancer incidence has previously been observed in 
the Iowa Women’s Health Study (40), though other prospective studies did not report similar 
relationships (41, 42).
We also note a statistically significant inverse relationship between coffee consumption and 
death from suicide for men, but not women. Consistent with this finding, coffee 
consumption was previously associated with lower suicide risk in a recent pooled analysis of 
the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (43).

 Discordant with these results, a Finnish prospective study reported greater suicide risk 
among heavy coffee consumers (44). Overall, our analysis only included 418 suicides, and 
importantly we lacked information on other factors related to suicide risk, such as 
antidepressant medication use and mental health status (e.g. depressive symptoms, anxiety, 
and stress) which may confound the coffee and suicide relationship. Further investigations 
on the effects of long-term coffee consumption on suicides are warranted.
Our prospective study was the largest to date to investigate the coffee-mortality relationship, 
and we controlled for important potential confounding factors. However we recognize that 
the associations may be biased due to residual confounding. In our analyses, smoking was 
the most important and influential confounder of the coffee-mortality relationship. However, 
the large number of participants and recorded deaths meant that our analyses could be 
restricted to never smokers. These analyses revealed that the inverse all-cause mortality 
association was stronger among never smokers, indicating that if residual confounding by 
smoking did occur, it would likely have attenuated the lower all-cause mortality risks 
observed among high coffee consumers. Generally, although residual confounding cannot be 
excluded as a potential explanation of our findings, our data revealed limited evidence that 
our results were the result of confounding bias due to smoking or other established mortality 
risk factors. Another possible explanation for our results is reverse causality, whereby 
participants experiencing early disease symptoms at baseline may have recorded lower 
coffee consumption or became non-consumers; thus artificially inflating the mortality risks 
amongst these individuals. However, we excluded participants from our analysis who self-
reported previous ill-health. Further, similar associations were observed when the analyses 
were limited to those individuals who self-reported being in ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ health at 
baseline, and when participants who died during the first 5 and 8 years of follow-up were 
excluded. An additional limitation is that coffee consumption information was only 
measured once at baseline and it is possible that changes in consumption may have occurred 
during the follow-up period. However, other studies in Western populations which measured 
diet repeatedly over the study follow-up period have recorded relatively stable coffee 
consumption patterns over time indicating that a single measure likely captures medium to 
long-term drinking habits (11). Finally, as coffee drinking was self-reported using dietary 
questionnaires some degree of measurement error and misclassification is expected. 
However, due to the prospective nature of the study, such misclassification would be 
expected to be non-differential (not correlated with mortality risk), and if at all would lead to 
an under-estimate of the true association.
In summary, our results suggest that higher levels of coffee drinking are associated with 
lower risks of death from a variety of causes and specifically from digestive and circulatory 
diseases. The consistency of the results of this European study with those from other cohort 
studies around the world, as well as biomarker data that indicate coffee drinkers have a more 
favorable liver function and inflammatory biomarker profile than non-consumers/low 
consumers, offers support to the hypothesis that coffee may confer chemopreventive 
properties. Since coffee is so ubiquitously consumed, and intakes are modifiable, the 
potentially beneficial clinical implications of coffee consumption should be given careful 
consideration and deserve to be further explored for its potential major impact on population 
health.

 Figure 1. 
Subgroup analysis of the associations of daily coffee consumption and all-cause mortality 
among men and women.
Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality are for the comparison of men and women in the 
highest quartile of consumers (high consumption) compared versus non-consumers. 
Multivariable model only - Cox regression using body mass index (<22; 22–<25; 25–<30; 
30–<35; 35+ kg/m2), physical activity index (inactive; moderately inactive; moderately 
active; active), education status (none; primary school completed; technical/professional 
school; secondary school; longer education including university; or not specified), alcohol 
consumption (non-consumers; <5; 5–<15; 15–<30; 30+ g/day), smoking status and intensity 
(never; current, 1–15 cigarettes per day; current, 16–25 cigarettes per day; current, 16+ 
cigarettes per day; former, quit ≤10 years; former, quit 11–20 years; former, quit 20+ years; 
current, pipe/cigar/occasional; current/former, missing; unknown), smoking duration (<10; 
10–<20; 20–<30; 30–<40; 40+ years; smoking duration unknown), ever use of contraceptive 
pill (yes; no; or unknown), menopausal status (premenopausal; postmenopausal; 
perimenopausal/unknown menopausal status; or surgical postmenopausal), ever use of 
menopausal hormone therapy (yes; no; or unknown), and intakes of total energy (kcal/day), 
red and processed meat (g/day), and fruits and vegetables (g/day) (all continuous), and 
stratified by age (1-year categories) and center. Categories were based on country-specific 
quartiles of coffee consumption after exclusion of non-consumers. Quartile cut-offs (in mL) 
were: Denmark: 500, 900 and 1,300; France: 150, 280 and 450; Germany: 261, 395 and 580; 
Greece: 70, 140 and 240; Italy: 60, 92 and 138; The Netherlands: 375, 500 and 750; 
Norway: 300, 420 and 540; Spain: 50, 105 and 196; Sweden: 300, 400 and 601; and the 
United Kingdom: 83, 380 and 488. Median consumption: alcohol = 12.6 g/day (men) and 
3.4 g/day (women); red and processed meat = 90.2 g/day (men) and 60.3 g/day (women); 
fruit and vegetables = 324 g/day (men) and 413 g/day (women).

status (none; primary school completed; technical/professional school; secondary school; longer education including university; or not specified), alcohol consumption (non-consumers; <5; 5–<15; 15–<30; 
30+ g/day), smoking status and intensity (never; current, 1–15 cigarettes per day; current, 16–25 cigarettes per day; current, 16+ cigarettes per day; former, quit ≤10 years; former, quit 11–20 years; former, 
quit 20+ years; current, pipe/cigar/occasional; current/former, missing; unknown), smoking duration (<10; 10–<20; 20–<30; 30–<40; 40+ years; smoking duration unknown), ever use of contraceptive pill 
(yes; no; or unknown), menopausal status (premenopausal; postmenopausal; perimenopausal/unknown menopausal status; or surgical postmenopausal), ever use of menopausal hormone therapy (yes; no; or 
unknown), and intakes of total energy (kcal/day), red and processed meat (g/day), and fruits and vegetables (g/day) (all continuous), and stratified by age (1-year categories), and center.
Categories were based on country-specific quartiles of coffee consumption after exclusion of non-consumers. Quartile cut-offs (in mL) were: Denmark: 500, 900 and 1,300; France: 150, 280 and 450; 
Germany: 261, 395 and 580; Greece: 70, 140 and 240; Italy: 60, 92 and 138; The Netherlands: 375, 500 and 750; Norway: 300, 420 and 540; Spain: 50, 105 and 196; Sweden: 300, 400 and 601; and the 
United Kingdom: 83, 380 and 488.
§Due to low case numbers among non-consumers, reference category merged with low consumers (Q1).

Multivariable means adjusted for country, smoking status (never, former, current, or missing), age (continuous), body mass index (<22; 22–<25; 25–<30; 30–<35; 35+ kg/m2), alcohol consumption (g/day; 
continuous), total energy intake (kcal/day; continuous). Categories were based on country-specific quartiles of coffee consumption after exclusion of non-consumers. Quartile cut-offs (in mL) were: 
Denmark: 500, 900 and 1,300; France: 151, 277 and 437; Germany: 262, 404 and 580; Italy: 60, 90 and 130; The Netherlands: 447, 536 and 768; Spain: 50, 110 and 200; Sweden: 321, 455 and 611; and the 
United Kingdom: 192, 477 and 855.
‡Arithmetic mean.
**Geometric mean.
Trend tests across exposure groups were calculated by entering the category variables into the models as continuous terms.
