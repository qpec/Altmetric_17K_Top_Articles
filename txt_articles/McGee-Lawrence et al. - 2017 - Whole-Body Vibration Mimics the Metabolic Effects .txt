Whole-body vibration (WBV) has gained attention as a potential exercise mimetic, but direct
comparisons with the metabolic effects of exercise are scarce. To determine whether WBV re-
capitulates the metabolic and osteogenic effects of physical activity, we exposed male wild-type
(WT) and leptin receptor–deficient (db/db) mice to daily treadmill exercise (TE) or WBV for 3 months.
Body weights were analyzed and compared with WT and db/db mice that remained sedentary.
Glucose and insulin tolerance testing revealed comparable attenuation of hyperglycemia and in-
sulin resistance in db/db mice following TE or WBV. Both interventions reduced body weight in db/
db mice and normalized muscle fiber diameter. TE or WBV also attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy in
visceral adipose tissue and reduced hepatic lipid content in db/db mice. Although the effects of
leptin receptor deficiency on cortical bone structure were not eliminated by either intervention,
exercise and WBV increased circulating levels of osteocalcin in db/db mice. In the context of in-
creased serum osteocalcin, the modest effects of TE and WBV on bone geometry, mineralization,
and biomechanics may reflect subtle increases in osteoblast activity in multiple areas of the skeleton.
Taken together, these observations indicate that WBV recapitulates the effects of exercise on
metabolism in type 2 diabetes. (Endocrinology 158: 1160–1171, 2017)

isruption of bone formation and turnover has been
reported in a range of metabolic disorders, including
obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although a significant body
of literature suggests that obesity reduces risk of osteo-
penia and osteoporosis (1, 2), there are also numerous
recent reports that obesity and its comorbidities reduce
bone formation (3–6). Obesity is accompanied by ectopic
lipid deposition in multiple tissues, including the skeleton,
where infiltration of adipocytes into the bone marrow
niche may negatively impact bone formation (7, 8). Bone
marrow stem cells express receptors for multiple adi-
pokines, including the adipose-derived hormone leptin

 (9, 10). Data from leptin-deficient rodent models have
revealed regionally specific effects on the skeleton, with
reports of cortical bone atrophy in weight-bearing long
bones like the femur and tibia (11–16). Leptin-deficient
(ob/ob) mice also exhibit lower femoral cortical bone
mineral density (BMD) and strength compared with wild-
type (WT) littermates (13). Bone loss in models of leptin
or leptin receptor deficiency has been linked with lower
osteoblast activity (9, 14), suggesting that cellular leptin
resistance in obesity might reduce bone formation.
Participation in regular physical activity protects
against bone loss (12, 17), and increasing evidence sug-
gests that whole-body vibration (WBV) elicits similar
effects in certain patient populations (18–20). Bone is a
mechanically responsive tissue (21, 22), and musculo-
skeletal loading with WBV or exercise promotes bone
formation in animal models (12, 21–26). Bone formation
is accompanied by increased levels of osteocalcin, a
hormone produced primarily by osteoblasts during ma-
trix synthesis (7, 27, 28). Circulating osteocalcin also
enhances insulin secretion by pancreatic b cells and in-
creases levels of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adipo-
nectin (29, 30). Circulating osteocalcin levels are reduced
in humans and in rodent models of obesity and insulin
resistance (16, 20, 31–34), and this effect is particularly
prominent in models with coincident obesity and bone
loss, such as Zucker rats (12) and leptin receptor–
deficient (db/db) mice (16). However, no studies have
directly compared the metabolic and skeletal conse-
quences of WBV in parallel with physical exercise.
Given that exercise and WBV place biomechanical
load on the skeleton, we hypothesized that both in-
terventions would promote bone formation, and that
osteogenic responses would be associated with im-
provements in glycemic control and lipid metabolism in
db/db mice. Both interventions modestly reduced body
weight, and in leptin receptor–deficient (db/db) mice,
treadmill exercise (TE) and WBV restored muscle fiber
diameters to within the range of WT mice. Musculo-
skeletal loading with TE or WBV reduced adipocyte
hypertrophy in visceral fat and attenuated hepatic
steatosis. Although effects on bone structure and bio-
mechanics were minimal, TE and WBV both increased
circulating levels of osteocalcin in db/db mice. This as-
sociation, if proven to be causal in subsequent studies,
would support the utility of WBV as an exercise mimetic.
Materials and Methods
Animal care, TE, and WBV
Male db/db mice and WT controls on the C57Bl6/J back-
ground were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,
ME) at 5 weeks of age. All animals were housed two per cage
with ad libitum access to food and water. Mice from each
genotype were assigned to sedentary (SED), WBV, or TE
conditions, with each group balanced for an equal distribution
of starting weights (n = 14 to 16 per condition). The first week
consisted of habituation to the experimental apparatus, fol-
lowed by 12 weeks of TE or WBV, as previously described (35,
36). In brief, WBV was carried out for 20 minutes per day at a
frequency of 32 Hz with 0.5g acceleration. TE (Columbus In-
struments, Columbus OH) was conducted using a 5% incline
at 10 m/min for 45 min/d. Both manipulations were applied
daily, with motivation on the treadmill achieved by delivery of
compressed air (15 psi) upon noncompliance. TE and WBV
began at lights out (18:00) to mimic the active phase of the
animals. Mice were weighed weekly throughout the experiment.
All procedures followed National Institutes of Health guidelines
and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta
University.
Intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance testing
For intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (IPGTT), mice
were fasted overnight, and preinjection blood samples were
rapidly collected from the tail vein within 3 minutes of cage
disturbance, as previously described (37). After collecting the
first sample, mice were injected with 1.0 g/kg glucose in sterile
saline [intraperitoneal (IP)], and postinjection samples were
taken at 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Glucose levels in blood
samples were determined immediately using a handheld gluc-
ometer and Freestyle Lite test strips (Abbott Diabetes Care,
Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). For IP insulin tolerance
testing, mice were injected with insulin (0.5 IU/kg IP), and
postinjection samples were collected at 15 and 60 minutes.
Blood glucose was determined using a handheld glucometer as
described earlier for IPGTT. Physiological responses to glucose
and insulin were quantified using area under the curve (AUC), as
previously described (37, 38).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
To analyze insulin responses to glucose challenge, mice were
injected with glucose as described previously for IPGTT, and
postinjection blood samples were taken at 30, 60, and 120
minutes. Insulin was quantified in serum samples from each time
point using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as
previously described (37, 39). For ELISA, samples were run in
duplicate as specified by the manufacturer (Crystal Chem,
Downers Grove, IL) and read at 450 nm on a SpectraMax 384
plate reader (Molecular Devices, Carlsbad, CA). Insulin con-
centrations were derived from the standard curve using linear
regression. Serum osteocalcin was also quantified by ELISA
(BT-470; Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA) following
manufacturer instructions, as previously described (36).
Serum chemistry and liver function panel
Serum analytes were quantified on a Roche Cobas Fara II
robotic chemical analyzer (Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland) as
previously reported (39, 40). Total cholesterol, triglycerides,
and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were quantified using assay
kits from Diagnostic Chemicals Limited (Oxford, CT). High-
density lipoprotein was measured using an assay kit from
Genzyme Diagnostics (Cambridge, MA). Nonesterified fatty
acids (NEFAs) and total ketone bodies (acetoacetone and

 3-hydroxybutyrate) were measured using kits from Wako Di-
agnostics (Richmond, VA). Total ketone bodies (acetoacetone
and 3-hydroxybutyrate) were measured using the Total Ketone
Bodies Kit (catalog nos. 415-73301 and 411-73401; Wako
Diagnostics, Richmond, VA). For the liver function panel, as-
partate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT),
gamma glutamyl-transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin were
measured using kits from Sekisui Diagnostics (Lexington, MA).
Histology and analysis of hepatic lipids
For adipose tissue histology, the skin was removed from the
lower extremities, and the inguinal fat pads were dissected from
the subcutaneous region. After bilateral dissection of the in-
guinal depot, the peritoneal wall was incised to reveal the
retroperitoneal fat pads, which were dissected away from the
kidney and adrenal. The intrascapular brown adipose depot
was excised and weighed after removing any superficial white
fat deposits. Fat pad weights were normalized to body weight at
euthanasia. Retroperitoneal and inguinal fat pads were sub-
sequently fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded,
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
Adipocyte diameters were quantified with image analysis
software (ImageJ), as previously described (35).
For muscle histology, the soleus and extensor digitorum
longus (EDL) muscles were separated along the horizontal plane
for paraffin embedding. Paraffin sections were stained with
H&E, and minimal fiber diameters were calculated in ImageJ, as
previously described (34). To quantify hepatic lipid content,
liver samples were weighed, homogenized, and processed for
chloroform extraction (41). In brief, samples were homogenized
in a 2:1 mixture of methanol:chloroform and treated with a 1:1
mixture of chloroform:KCl. Following centrifugation and
desiccation, the extracted lipids were quantified relative to
original tissue weight. For histological analysis, liver samples
were embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT; Sakura
Finetek, Torrance, CA) and sectioned on a cryostat (Leica).
Slides were subsequently stained with H&E or Oil Red O with
hematoxylin counterstaining.
Microcomputed tomography, bone
histomorphometry, and biomechanical testing
For analysis of cortical bone architecture, the middiaphysis
of each femur was scanned with an ex vivo microcomputed
tomography system (Skyscan 1174; Bruker microCT, Kontich,
Belgium) as previously described (42). Bones were scanned in air
using 50 kV, 15-mm isotropic voxels, and 400-ms integration
time. Scans were reconstructed and analyzed with SkyScan
software to quantify cortical bone thickness (mm), periosteal
area (mm2), cortical bone area (mm2), and medullary area
fraction (%). Analysis of BMD (measured in grams of mineral
per square centimeter of tissue) at the femoral neck and femoral
middiaphysis was performed using a microcomputed tomog-
raphy system developed at the Savannah River National Lab-
oratory (Aiken, SC) using 60 kV, 0.148 mA, and 15-mm voxels,
as previously described (36).
For histological analysis of bone formation, a subset of mice
from each group received two injections of tetracycline (20 mg/kg
IP), spaced 10 days apart, immediately prior to euthanasia.
The distal third of each tibia was dehydrated, embedded in
methyl methacrylate, and sectioned in the horizontal (trans-
verse) plane using a diamond saw, as previously described (43).
Complete images of each tibial cross-section were acquired at
1003 final magnification using the Automontage feature in
Microlucida software (Microbrightfield, Williston, VT). Analysis
of dynamic histomorphometry metrics was carried out for the
tibial histology sections as previously described (14), with minor
modifications. The endocortical mineral apposition rate was
derived from the average distance between double-labeled sur-
faces divided by the time between tetracycline injections. For
biomechanical testing, radii were thawed and placed on steel
testing fixtures (5-mm spacing, 2.5 mm on either side of center).
Testing was carried out by linear displacement at 0.10 mm/s
using a Transducer Techniques 5-kg load cell, with data recorded
every 0.01 seconds. Bones were loaded to failure, and ultimate
load and stiffness (slope) were calculated from the load-
displacement curves, as previously reported (36).
Statistics
Measures of liver, muscle, and adipose tissue were analyzed
using 2 3 3 analysis of variance (ANOVA) designs, with ge-
notype (WT 3 db/db) and intervention (SED 3 WBV 3 TE) as
fixed factors. When statistically significant (P , 0.05) effects of
intervention were observed, we conducted within-genotype
comparisons using one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc
comparison of each intervention group with genotype-matched
SED mice using Bonferroni-corrected t tests. Body weights over
the course of the experiment were compared across groups and
treatment conditions using 2 3 3 repeated measures ANOVA,
followed by post hoc testing as described previously. For IPGTT
and IP insulin tolerance testing data sets, AUC was computed
and compared across groups using 2 3 3 ANOVA followed by
post hoc comparisons as described earlier for single–end point
measures. Statistics were performed in PASW Statistics version
11 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY), and graphs were gener-
ated using Graphpad Prism 5.0 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA).
Results
Exercise and WBV reduce weight gain and muscle
atrophy in db/db mice
Twelve weeks of daily TE or WBV reduced weight gain
in db/db and WT mice [Fig. 1(a–d); effect of intervention,
F2,36 = 5.81, P , 0.01]. Although all groups of db/db mice
weighed significantly more than WT mice [Fig. 1(a–d);
effect of genotype, F1,36 = 76.55, P , 0.001], db/db mice
exposed to TE weighed significantly less than SED db/db
mice at the end of the experiment [Fig. 1(d); post hoc
comparison, db/db SED vs db/db WBV, not significant ;
db/db SED vs db/db TE, t14 = 3.75, P , 0.01]. The modest
reductions in weight gain observed with TE and WBV
may have been attributable to muscle hypertrophy, as db/
db mice responded to these interventions with significant
increases in EDL fiber diameter [Fig. 1(e) and 1(f); effect
of intervention in db/db, F2,18 = 8.84, P , 0.05; post hoc
comparison, db/db SED vs db/db WBV, t13 = 3.93, P ,
0.01; db/db SED vs db/db TE, t11 = 3.28, P , 0.01].
Similar trends were observed in the soleus, although these
effects did not reach statistical significance [Fig. 1(g)].
These results demonstrate that exercise and WBV

 normalize muscle fiber diameter in db/db mice. Because
muscle hypertrophy was coincident with small but sig-
nificant reductions in weight gain, exercise and WBV
exert similar effects on body composition in leptin
receptor–deficient mice.
Physical activity and WBV attenuate adipocyte
hypertrophy in visceral fat
Consistent with their obese phenotype, db/db mice had
significantly more visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT),
based on comparisons of retroperitoneal fat pad weights
relative to body weights at euthanasia [Fig. 2(a); effect of
genotype, F1,42 = 55.84, P , 0.01]. db/db mice also exhibit
significantly greater subcutaneous adiposity, based on
analysis of inguinal fat pad weights relative to body weight
[Fig. 2(b); effect of genotype, F1,42 = 48.27, P , 0.01]. The
ratio of intrascapular brown adipose tissue to body weight
was also significantly greater in db/db mice [Fig. 2(c); effect
of genotype, F1,42 = 19.79, P , 0.01].
Quantification of adipocyte morphology in vWAT
revealed that musculoskeletal loading significantly re-
duced cellular hypertrophy in db/db mice [Fig. 2(d); effect
of intervention in db/db, F2,18 = 32.91, P , 0.01]. Both
TE and WBV reduced the diameter of vWAT adipocytes
in db/db mice relative to db/db SED [Fig. 2(e); post hoc
comparison, db/db SED vsdb/db WBV,t14 = 5.14, P , 0.01;
db/db SED vs db/db TE, t16 = 7.08, P , 0.01]. These effects
were observed in vWAT, but not in subcutaneous white
adipose tissue, where all groups of db/db mice exhibit similar
degrees of adipocyte hypertrophy relative to WT mice [Fig.
2(f); effect of genotype, F1,30 = 17.52, P , 0.01]. When
interpreted alongside of increases in muscle fiber diameter
[Fig. 1(e)], attenuation of vWAT adipocyte hypertrophy
provides further evidence for repartitioning of body com-
position after musculoskeletal loading in db/db mice.
Musculoskeletal loading enhances glycemic control
and insulin sensitivity in db/db mice
db/db mice exhibit fasting hyperglycemia, based on
comparison of serum glucose levels taken before IPGTT
[Fig. 3(a) and 3(b)]. TE reduced circulating glucose levels at
60 and 120 minutes after glucose challenge [Fig. 3(a); effect
of intervention in db/db, F2,18 = 8.61, P , 0.05]. The effect
of TE in db/db mice was statistically significant following
comparison of the AUC [Fig. 3(b); post hoc comparison,
db/db SED vs db/db WBV, NS; db/db SED vs db/db TE,
t11 = 3.09, P , 0.05]. Similar trends were observed for the
effect of TE in WT mice, but these did not reach statistical
significance [Fig. 3(a)]. These results indicate that TE en-
hances glucose clearance in leptin receptor mutant mice.

 Analysis of serum insulin levels before and after glu-
cose challenge revealed parallel effects of TE and WBV in
db/db mice. SED db/db mice exhibit elevated fasting
insulin levels, but TE and WBV comparably reduced
insulin concentrations in samples taken prior to glucose
administration [Fig. 3(c); effect of intervention in db/db,
F2,18 = 6.71, P , 0.05]. Similar trends were observed
following analysis of the AUC, which revealed significant
reductions in insulin responses to glucose challenge after
TE or WBV in db/db mice [Fig. 3(c); post hoc comparison,
db/db SED vs db/db WBV, t11 = 7.82, P , 0.01; db/db
SED vs db/db TE, t11 = 10.91, P , 0.01]. As expected
given the low intensity of the loading interventions, there
was no effect of TE or WBV on insulin responses to
glucose challenge in WT mice [Fig. 3(c)]. This outcome
suggests that TE and WBV may enhance pancreatic
sensitivity to glucose in db/db mice.
To directly examine insulin sensitivity, we examined
changes in circulating glucose following insulin admin-
istration in WT and db/db mice exposed to TE, WBV, or
SED conditions. SED db/db mice were unresponsive to
insulin, but TE and WBV partially restored insulin sen-
sitivity [Fig. 3(e); effect of intervention in db/db, F2,16 =
4.96, P , 0.05]. These effects were also reflected by the
AUC, which was significantly reduced in db/db mice
exposed to TE or WBV, relative to SED db/db mice [Fig.
3(f); post hoc comparison, db/db SED vs db/db WBV,
t11 = 3.33, P , 0.05; db/db SED vs db/db TE, t11 = 6.93,
P , 0.01]. All groups of WT mice exhibited similar re-
ductions in serum glucose after insulin administration,
indicating that there was no effect of TE or WBV on
insulin sensitivity in WT mice [Fig. 3(e) and 3(f)]. Taken
together, these results indicate that TE and WBV exert
similar effects on glucose metabolism and insulin sensi-
tivity in db/db mice.
TE and WBV attenuate hepatic steatosis in
db/db mice
Significant increases in hepatic lipid content are
exhibited in db/db mice relative to WT mice [Fig. 4(a);
effect of genotype, F1,38 = 18.27, P , 0.01]. In db/db
mice, TE and WBV significantly reduced hepatic lipids
[Fig. 4(a); effect of intervention in db/db, F2,20 = 14.57,
P , 0.01; post hoc comparison, db/db SED vs db/db
WBV, t13 = 4.13, P , 0.01; db/db SED vs db/db TE, t11 =
3.72, P , 0.01]. Although the effects were less dramatic
than in db/db mice, WT mice also responded to TE and
WBV with reductions in hepatic lipid content, but these
did not reach statistical significance in post hoc com-
parisons [Fig. 4(a)]. Histological examination of H&E
staining in liver sections revealed widespread evidence of
hepatic steatosis in db/db mice relative to WT mice [Fig.
4(b)]. Consistent with the quantitative data from liver
lipid extraction, WBV and TE only partially reduced Oil
Red O staining in db/db mice, as differences were still
visually apparent upon comparison with liver sections
from WT mice [Fig. 4(b)].
Mild hepatomegaly also occurred in db/db mice, based
on significant increases in liver weights relative to body
weight following comparison with WT mice [Fig. 4(c);
Figure 2. TE and WBV comparably attenuate adipocyte hypertrophy in visceral fat from db/db mice. (a) db/db mice exhibit significantly greater
visceral adiposity than WT mice based on increases in the weight of the retroperitoneal fat pads after dissection and normalization to body
weight (BW) at euthanasia. (b) db/db mice also exhibit increases in subcutaneous adiposity relative to WT mice based on the ratio of inguinal fat
pad weights to body weight. (c) The proportional weight of intrascapular brown fat was also greater in db/db mice relative to WT mice. (d) TE or
WBV reduced adipocyte diameter in retroperitoneal fat relative to SED db/db mice. (e) Micrographs show representative H&E staining of
retroperitoneal fat from mice in the indicated conditions. Scale bar = 200 mm. (f) Adipocyte hypertrophy in subcutaneous fat was unaffected by
TE or WBV in db/db mice. For graphs, bars represent the average of (n = 6 to 8) mice in the indicated conditions, and hashtags denote the effect
of genotype following 2 3 3 ANOVA with statistical significance at P , 0.05. Asterisks indicate significant differences relative to matched-
genotype SED mice following one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons.

 effect of genotype, F1,39 = 60.41, P , 0.01]. In serum
samples, db/db mice had higher concentrations of ALT [Fig.
4(d); effect of genotype, F1,39 = 84.55, P , 0.01], with no
change in levels of AST [Fig. 4(e)]. There was no effect of
genotype or intervention on levels of GGT, but the change
in AST/ALT ratio observed in db/db mice indicates
that reductions in hepatic lipids with exercise or WBV
represent a partial, rather than total, normalization of liver
function. This interpretation is also supported by analysis of
serum lipids, which revealed significant increases in cho-
lesterol (effect of genotype, F1,71 = 13.73, P , 0.01), LDL
(effect of genotype, F1,35 = 95.57, P , 0.01), triglycerides
(effect of genotype, F1,68 = 45.83, P , 0.01), NEFAs (effect
of genotype, F1,38 = 6.09, P , 0.05), and total ketone bodies
(effect of genotype, F1,35 = 4.58, P , 0.05) in db/db mice
(Table 1). These observations indicate that dyslipidemia in
db/db mice persists after the musculoskeletal loading pro-
tocols used in these experiments.
Regional differences in skeletal responses to
musculoskeletal loading in db/db mice
SED db/db mice had significantly lower circulating
osteocalcin levels than WT mice [Fig. 5(a); effect of
genotype, F1,57 = 63.53, P , 0.01]. Musculoskeletal
loading with TE or WBV increased serum osteocalcin in
db/db mice relative to SED db/db mice (effect of in-
tervention in db/db, F2,35 = 17.02, P , 0.01; post hoc
comparison, db/db SED vs db/db WBV, t22 = 5.46, P ,
0.01; db/db SED vs db/db TE, t22 = 5.93, P , 0.01).
Neither manipulation restored serum osteocalcin to the
levels observed in WT mice, but the increase relative to
SED db/db mice indicates that musculoskeletal loading
exerts effects on the skeleton, even in the context of leptin
receptor deficiency. Although serum osteocalcin levels
increased following musculoskeletal loading in db/db
mice, quantification of the endocortical mineral appo-
sition rate in the tibial diaphysis revealed no effect of
genotype or musculoskeletal loading [Fig. 5(b)]. db/db

(effect of genotype, F1,39 = 38.01, P , 0.01), but cortical
bone loss was unaffected by either intervention [Fig. 5(c)].
Similar genotype effects were evident upon comparisons
of the periosteal area of the femur, which was signifi-
cantly reduced in db/db mice [Fig. 5(d); effect of geno-
type, F1,39 = 23.96, P , 0.01]. Although there was a trend
for increases in periosteal area after TE in db/db mice, this

 did not reach statistical significance [Fig. 5(d); for effect of
intervention in db/db, F2,18 = 2.85, P = 0.08].
Micro–computed tomography (microCT) analysis
revealed that db/db mice exhibit reduced BMD in the
femoral neck, relative to WT mice [Fig. 6(a); effect of
genotype, F1,38 = 19.67, P , 0.01]. TE, but not WBV,
normalized BMD in db/db mice [Fig. 6(a); effect of in-
tervention in db/db, F1,20 = 15.12, P , 0.01; post hoc
comparison, db/db SED vs db/db WBV, NS; db/db SED
vs db/db TE, t11 = 3.86, P , 0.01]. These effects were
regionally differentiated along the length of the femur, as
midshaft BMD was unaffected by genotype or muscu-
loskeletal loading [Fig. 6(b)]. Biomechanical testing in the
radius revealed that db/db mice had significantly reduced
bone strength, as measured by ultimate load, compared
with WT mice [Fig. 6(c); effect of genotype, F1,53 = 25.28,
P , 0.01]. However, neither of the interventions had a
significant impact on bone strength relative to matched-
genotype SED mice [Fig. 6(c)]. Likewise, radial stiffness
was not significantly impacted by genotype or experi-
mental condition [Fig. 6(d)]. In the context of increased
serum osteocalcin, the modest effects of TE and WBV on
bone geometry, mineralization, and biomechanics may
reflect distributed osteogenic responses in multiple areas
of the skeleton.
Discussion
In this report, we compared the metabolic and osteogenic
effects of WBV with the effects of TE in a mouse model of
genetic obesity and diabetes (db/db mice). We found that
TE and WBV exert similar effects on muscle fiber di-
ameter in db/db mice. SED db/db mice exhibited muscle
atrophy, but TE and WBV restored muscle fiber di-
ameter to within the range of WT mice. Exercise and
WBV reduced adipocyte hypertrophy in visceral fat,
attenuated hepatic steatosis, and enhanced glycemic
control in db/db mice. Although skeletal responses to

 exercise and WBV were modest, the increases in serum
osteocalcin suggest that db/db mice exhibit osteogenic
responses to both interventions. Taken together, these
findings demonstrate that WBV recapitulates the effects
of exercise on metabolism in a mouse model of obesity
and insulin resistance.
Two recently published reports by independent groups
have shown that WBV attenuates fasting hyperglycemia
and hyperinsulinemia in db/db mice (44, 45). However,
these reports did not incorporate kinetic analyses to in-
vestigate potential tissue-specific alterations in insulin
sensitivity and glucose metabolism. We observed that

 WBV partially normalizes pancreatic responses to glu-
cose, based on analysis of serum insulin responses to
glucose challenge. WBV also rescued insulin sensitivity,
based on reductions in serum glucose after insulin ad-
ministration. Exercise and WBV exert comparable effects
on insulin sensitivity and pancreatic responses to glucose,
but WBV did not recapitulate the effects of exercise on
glucose clearance in db/db mice. Understanding the ki-
netics and tissue-specific loci for responses to exercise and
WBV is critical to inform the timing and modality of both
interventions in future studies.
Findings from rodent models of obesity have shown
that WBV attenuates dyslipidemia (45, 46). In aged mice
and rodents with diet-induced obesity, WBV reduced
adiposity and lowered serum triglycerides (47–49), but
the magnitude of these effects had never been examined
relative to exercise. We observed comparable reductions
in adipocyte diameter following TE or WBV in leptin
receptor–deficient mice. Although this effect was not
accompanied by changes in serum triglycerides, it is
noteworthy that db/db mice retained physiological re-
sponses to musculoskeletal loading despite severe and
widespread metabolic deficits. The reductions in hepatic
lipid content and steatosis observed following WBV in
male db/db mice in the current study are also consistent
with a recent report in female db/db mice (45). Liu et al.
(45) demonstrated that the hepatic effects of WBV were
correlated with reductions in sterol regulatory element
binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), a transcription factor that
regulates genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (50).
Although it is possible that the effects of WBV on gly-
cemic control and hepatic lipids might be mediated by a
shared mechanism, this possibility remains speculative
and will require targeted manipulation of SREBP1c and
other pathways associated with WBV effects on the liver.
Previous work in rodent models indicates that WBV
attenuates muscle atrophy with disuse and aging and in
experimental models of menopause (23, 51–53). Leptin-
deficient mice exhibit widespread reductions in muscle
fiber diameter and cellularity (14, 54). Loss of skeletal
muscle in models of leptin deficiency has been linked with
imbalances between hypertrophic and atrophic myokines
(34, 55–57). There are interesting similarities between the
results of the current study and published data from
leptin-deficient mice with genetic ablation of the atrophic
hormone myostatin (55, 56). Specifically, the metabolic
effects of musculoskeletal loading in the current experi-
ments resemble the partial restoration of insulin sensi-
tivity reported in leptin-deficient mice following
myostatin ablation (55, 56). It is therefore possible that
changes in secreted factors from skeletal muscle could be
contributing to the effects of exercise and WBV. This
possibility is not exclusive to myostatin, because the
cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) also plays a critical role in
exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy, and the secreted
hormone irisin is released in response to exercise and
promotes energy expenditure (57). The effects of exercise
and WBV on muscle atrophy and metabolic dysfunction
in the current data set may also be mediated by disso-
ciable mechanisms. Future studies will be required to
examine whether physical activity and WBV promote
muscle hypertrophy via a common mechanism and to
elucidate the role of myokines in the metabolic effects of
loading interventions.
Although the effects of leptin deficiency on bone re-
main controversial, decreases in cortical bone mass in
weight-bearing regions of the skeleton like the tibia and
femur represent the most consistently reported skeletal
phenotype in leptin-deficient rodents (12–16, 52). Re-
cently published findings suggest that WBV increases
trabecular and cortical bone mass in db/db mice (44), but
these effects differ from the modest skeletal responses
observed after exercise and WBV in the current study.
The differential outcomes could be attributable to the
greater intensity and duration of the WBV protocol used
by Jing et al. (44); specifically, this report applied com-
parable mechanical force (0.5 g) at slightly higher fre-
quency (45 Hz, as opposed to 32 Hz in the current study).
The duration (20 minutes) used in the current study was
based on previous work by our group demonstrating
attenuation of age-related bone loss in male mice (36), but
this duration is also less than the 60-minute protocol
shown to promote bone formation in the study by Jing
et al. (44). The dose dependency of WBV effects on bone
formation and metabolism warrant further study, and the
different outcomes observed at the skeletal level may be
explained by methodological differences. However, our
observation that WBV increases serum osteocalcin in db/
db mice is consistent with the findings of Jing et al. (44).
Because the increases in osteocalcin observed in the
current study were comparable to those evoked by
treadmill training, our results demonstrate that WBV
elicits replicable increases in osteocalcin that recapitulate
the effects of exercise.
As noted previously (12, 16), SED db/db mice in the
current study had lower circulating osteocalcin levels
than SED WT mice. TE and WBV increased circulating
osteocalcin in db/db mice, relative to SED db/db mice, but
did not restore levels to within the range of WT mice.
Although the metabolic effects of osteocalcin are still
being elucidated (58, 59), several studies suggest that
undercarboxylated osteocalcin regulates glycemic con-
trol and lipid metabolism in mouse models (27, 30, 60).

 consequences of diet-induced obesity in WT mice (30, 60).
In the present studies, the effects of musculoskeletal
loading on serum osteocalcin in db/db mice were cor-
related with improvements in glycemic control and in-
sulin sensitivity, but it is important to note that total,
rather than undercarboxylated, osteocalcin was mea-
sured here. Although the metabolic responses observed
are consistent with the cellular consequences of osteo-
calcin exposure in pancreatic b-cells and myoblasts in
vitro (27–29, 61), the metabolic effects of exercise and
WBV may not be dependent on osteocalcin per se. Serum
osteocalcin reflects global bone formation (27, 28), and
osteoblasts can regulate metabolism in an osteocalcin-
independent manner (59, 62). Direct manipulation of
osteocalcin will be required to determine whether in-
creases are required for enhanced glycemic control with
exercise and WBV.
Although comparisons across published findings in the
human literature reveal broad similarities between the
metabolic effects of exercise and WBV, there have been
no direct comparisons of these interventions. Both forms
of musculoskeletal loading attenuate obesity, insulin
resistance, and sarcopenia in humans (19, 20, 25, 63–65),
but differences in patient population characteristics and
the methods used to evaluate metabolism prevent analysis
of the relative efficacy of WBV relative to exercise. In any
case, the transferability of the current results to humans
would require preliminary demonstration of similar
outcomes in outbred animal models, as the inbred strains
used in these experiments exhibit greater genetic homo-
geneity than human populations. Conducting genome-
wide association studies in an outbred animal model
could potentially identify predictive loci for comparable
metabolic responses to exercise and WBV. If genetic pre-
dictors of sensitivity to exercise and WBV were conserved
in humans, it might be possible to use single nucleotide
polymorphisms or other genetic covariates as biomarkers
to identify populations likely to benefit from WBV. The
primary conclusion drawn from the current report is that
WBV recapitulates some of the metabolic effects of exercise
in mice with genetic obesity and diabetes. Future studies
will focus on comparing the effects of musculoskeletal
loading in outbred models, but in the human literature, it
would be beneficial to consider direct comparisons of WBV
with exercise interventions. With the increasing prevalence
of obesity and its comorbidities, WBV warrants further
investigation as a strategy to attenuate risk factors for
cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
