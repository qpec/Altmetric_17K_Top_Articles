SUMMARY
Proviral factors are host proteins hijacked by viruses
for processes essential for virus propagation such as
cellular entry and replication. Pathogens and their
hosts co-evolve. It follows that replacing a proviral
factor with a functional ancestral form of the same
protein could prevent viral propagation without fatally
compromising organismal fitness. Here, we provide
proof of concept of this notion. Thioredoxins serve
as general oxidoreductases in all known cells. We
report that several laboratory resurrections of Pre-
cambrian thioredoxins display substantial levels of
functionality within Escherichia coli. Unlike E. coli
thioredoxin, however, these ancestral thioredoxins
are not efficiently recruited by the bacteriophage T7
for its replisome and therefore prevent phage propa-
gation in E. coli. These results suggest an approach
to the engineering of virus resistance. Diseases
caused by viruses may have a devastating effect in
agriculture. We discuss how the suggested approach
could be applied to the engineering of plant virus
resistance.
INTRODUCTION
It has been estimated that direct losses caused by pathogens,
animals, and weeds amount to 20%–40% of the global agricul-
tural productivity (Savary et al., 2012). Plant viruses that affect
economically important crops, in particular, often become a
cause of severe hardship for large numbers of people (Strange
and Scott, 2005; Rybicki, 2015). Several approaches to the
engineering of plant viral resistance have been explored, and
some crops with engineered resistance are grown commer-
cially (Dasgupta et al., 2003; Prins et al., 2008; Collinge et al.,
2010; Galvez et al., 2014; Whitham and Hajimorad, 2016).
Briefly, introduction of viral genes into plants has been found
in some cases to interfere with essential steps in the virus life
cycle, thus giving rise to the so-called pathogen-derived resis-
tance. Plant resistance genes encoding products that detect
viral gene products and trigger resistance responses are
known and have been shown to confer resistance to other plant
species when used as transgenes. Finally, RNA-silencing sys-
tems in plants can be engineered to target viral genomes and
transcripts.
Some host proteins play a permissive role for viral infection
and some play a restrictive role (‘‘proviral’’ and ‘‘antiviral’’ fac-
tors, respectively). There are abundant proviral factors as shown
by recent studies (Friedel and Haas, 2011; Wang, 2015; Enard
et al., 2016; Wilke and Sawyer, 2016; Sasvari and Nagy, 2016)
thus pointing to many potential targets for resistance engineer-
ing. Very recent work has used gene-editing methodologies to
suppress (knock out or render non-functional) proviral factors
and achieve resistance (Chandrasekaran et al., 2016; Pyott
et al., 2016). However, the applicability of this suppression
approach is limited by the fact that proviral factors carry out
‘‘normal’’ functions in the host, and their suppression may there-
fore compromise host fitness and survival.
Pathogens and their hosts co-evolve. Proviral factors can be
seen as proteins hijacked by viruses that are indeed losing the
arms race (Daugherty and Malik, 2012; Demogines et al., 2013;
Ng et al., 2015), as they have not yet adapted to evade viral hi-
jacking. Therefore, it stands to reason that if a proviral factor in
a host were exchanged for a functional analog, the fitness of
the host might be only mildly affected, whereas the fitness of
the virus could be substantially impaired. We hypothesize that
a means to engineer this exchange is to take an ancestral version
of the proviral host protein. Because the ancestral version would
have co-evolved with a very different set of pathogens, it would
be evolutionarily less simple for contemporary pathogens to
swap to use the ancestral protein. That is, evasion and virus
resistance can be achieved by using resurrected ancestral
proviral proteins that are expected to maintain sufficient func-
tionalities while being distant enough that they should represent
a difficult challenge for the virus in terms of recruitment and
adaptation. One can thus relatively preserve host fitness but
impair viral fitness. Here, we present a test/demonstration of
this approach using the infection of Escherichia coli by the bacte-
riophage T7 as a simple model. As explained below in some
detail, the molecular features of the relevant intermolecular inter-
actions make this system particularly attractive as a proof of
concept of our proposal. Furthermore, in the Discussion section,
we will speculate as to the greater relevance of the proposed
approach in engineering viral resistance, and specifically, we
will outline how it could be applied to engineering plant viral
resistance.
Bacteriophage T7 recruits E. coli thioredoxin to be a part of its
‘‘minimalist’’ (four proteins) replisome (Hamdan and Richardson,
Cell Reports 19, 1247–1256, May 9, 2017 ª 2017 The Author(s).

 2009). When recruited, thioredoxin functions as a processivity
factor for the gp5 DNA polymerase. It binds strongly to gp5
and increases its processivity from 1–15 to several hundred nu-
cleotides per binding event, likely by suppressing hoping on and
off the DNA (Etson et al., 2010). Binding to gp5 is mediated by
specific interactions with a unique 76-residue fragment known
as the thioredoxin-binding domain (for instance, see Figure 1 in
Akabayov et al. [2010]). Such specific interaction appears to re-
configure gp5 to enhance contact with DNA and create docking
sites for the other proteins of the replisome (Hamdan and Ri-
chardson, 2009; Lee and Richardson, 2011). The thioredoxin-
binding domain of the phage gp5 is not found in other members
of this polymerase family and is likely the result of the evolu-
tionary adaptation of bacteriophage T7 for efficient propagation
in E. coli. In fact, with a value for the dissociation constant of
5 nM, the interaction between E. coli thioredoxin and the thiore-
doxin-binding domain in gp5 is actually one of the highest-
affinity interactions involving replication proteins (Hamdan and
Richardson, 2009). The very high specificity of this interaction
makes it plausible that at least some ancestral forms of thiore-
doxin may not be recruited by bacteriophage T7.
On the other hand, the ‘‘normal’’ role of thioredoxin in all
known cells is to serve as a general oxido-reductase (Holmgren,
1995). As such, thioredoxin is involved in a diversity of cellular
processes, and a large number of potential substrates for thiore-
doxin have been identified using a variety of approaches (Collet
and Messens, 2010; Kumar et al., 2004). This wide substrate
scope is likely achieved through a molecular mechanism that
does not impose highly specific intermolecular interactions. In
fact, the disulfide bridge of the conserved CGPC active site motif
in thioredoxins is solvent-exposed and protrudes somewhat
from the structure of the protein (thioredoxin has sometimes
been referred to as a ‘‘male enzyme’’) (Holmgren et al., 1975).
This structural feature should promote the processing of a diver-
sity of substrates. Certainly, any change in a complex system
involving interacting parts or processes is likely to generate a
less fit system (Kirschner and Gerhart, 2005) and, consequently,
replacing a modern protein in a modern organism with a repre-
sentation of one of its ancestors is expected to bring about a
fitness cost in many instances (Hobbs et al., 2015). Still, given
that the most common oxido-reductase function of thioredoxin
involves molecular interactions that are not highly specific, it
would not be unreasonable to expect ancestral thioredoxins to
show some degree of functionality within an E. coli cell.
Overall, it seems plausible that at least some ancient thiore-
doxins could functionally replace the modern thioredoxin within
E. coli and, in addition, make E. coli resistant to the propagation
of bacteriophage T7. Certainly, an experimental test of this pos-
sibility would seem to face an insurmountable barrier, i.e., the
fact that ancient proteins no longer exist. However, phylogenetic
analyses of modern protein sequences can be used to derive
plausible approximations to the sequences of proteins in extinct
organisms (Pauling and Zuckerkandl, 1963). Indeed, proteins en-
coded by such reconstructed ancestral sequences (i.e., ‘‘resur-
rected’’ ancestral proteins, to use the common jargon of the field)
have been extensively used in the last �20 years to address
important problems in molecular evolution (for reviews, see Ben-
ner et al., 2007; Liberles, 2007; Harms and Thornton, 2010, 2013;
Risso et al., 2014; Merkl and Sterner, 2016). Here, we specifically
use several resurrected Precambrian thioredoxins that actually
span the �4 billion years of evolution of life on Earth (see Figure 1
for a description of the corresponding phylogenetic nodes and
the values of the identity of the reconstructed sequences with
the sequence of E. coli thioredoxin). These putative Precambrian
thioredoxins have been previously prepared and exhaustively
characterized (Perez-Jimenez et al., 2011; Ingles-Prieto et al.,
2013; Romero-Romero et al., 2016). They are properly folded
and share the thioredoxin fold. They are also stable, enzymati-
cally active, and their in vitro properties define convincing evolu-
tionary narratives as we have previously discussed in detail
(Perez-Jimenez et al., 2011; Ingles-Prieto et al., 2013; Romero-
Romero et al., 2016). For comparison, E. coli thioredoxin and hu-
man thioredoxin are also included in this study.
RESULTS
E. coli Strains Used in This Work
The cytoplasm of Escherichia coli actually contains two thiore-
doxins (Miranda-Vizuete et al., 1997; El Hajjaji et al., 2009): thio-
redoxin 1, which we have referred to in the Introduction (and shall

 continue to refer to) simply as E. coli thioredoxin, and thioredoxin
2, which has a zinc-binding domain and is induced under oxida-
tive stress conditions. The studies described here employ the re-
ceptor strain FA41, an E. coli strain deficient in the two thioredox-
ins described in this organism. FA41 is able to grow, albeit at a
significantly slower rate than the ‘‘wild type’’ strain DHB4. This
capability to grow slowly in the absence of thioredoxins is likely
due, at least in part, to the glutaredoxin pathway, which can sub-
stitute for some of the functions associated to the thioredoxin
pathway (absent in FA41). The slower-growth phenotype is in
fact consistent with that of other thioredoxin minus strains
described in the literature (Holmgren et al., 1978; Lim et al.,
1985). From now on, we shall refer to the FA41 and DHB4
E. coli strains as E. coli Trx� and E. coli Trx+, respectively. All
studies reported here are based on the complementation of
the E. coli Trx� strain with plasmids containing thioredoxin
genes. We decided to use this complementation approach,
rather than allelic replacement, to avoid potential effects on
fitness linked to regulatory changes triggered by stress condi-
tions in some of the fitness experiments. Expression of thiore-
doxins was under a T7 promoter in pET derivative plasmids.
This system is ‘‘leaky,’’ and even under non-inducing conditions
there is a basal expression level from the T7 promoter (see
Experimental Procedures for details), which is sufficient to
compensate the growth deficiency of the E. coli Trx� strain
with the plasmid encoding for the gene of E. coli thioredoxin 1
(Figure 2A). This suggests that the basal expression level leads
to thioredoxin concentrations within the complemented E. coli
Trx� strain comparable to the normal thioredoxin concentration
within E. coli (�102 mM) (Jacob et al., 2011).
Finally, FA41 and DHB4 are male E. coli strains, a feature
linked to the presence of an F0 factor. Infection of male strains
by the bacteriophage T7 is abortive and does not lead to subse-
quent virus propagation. Therefore, the E. coli Trx� and E. coli
Trx+ strains in our virus propagation experiments are F0 minus
versions of DHB4 and FA41, in which the F0 factor has been
cured following a standard protocol (see Experimental Proced-
ures for details).
Functionality of Precambrian Thioredoxins within E. coli
The resurrected Precambrian thioredoxins studied in this work
have been previously shown to display redox activity in vitro,
not only on the basis of regular solution assays, but also using
a single-molecule atomic force spectroscopy approach that
provides a high-resolution structural depiction of the catalytic
process (Perez-Jimenez et al., 2011). Indeed, the resurrected
Precambrian thioredoxins studied here show levels of in vitro
redox activity that are similar, or even higher in some cases,
than those of their modern human and E. coli counterparts.
This in vitro activity, however, does not necessarily imply sub-
stantial functionality within a modern organism. Thioredoxin is
involved in vivo in a diversity of cellular processes, and a large
number of proteins have been identified as thioredoxin sub-
strates (Collet and Messens, 2010; Kumar et al., 2004). Precam-
brian thioredoxins were adapted to ancestral extra- and intra-
cellular environments and, in particular, the substrates they
acted upon were likely different from the thioredoxin substrates
in modern organisms.
In order to probe the functionality of the ancestral thioredoxins
in vivo within a modern organism, we determined the extent
to which they can rescue the slow growth phenotype of the
E. coli Trx� strain. To this end, we complemented the E. coli
Trx� strain with plasmids containing the genes of Precambrian
thioredoxins (and also, the gene of human thioredoxin and, as
a control, the gene of E. coli thioredoxin) and measured the gen-
eration time. Compensation of the growth deficiency was indeed
observed (Figure 2B) and to an extent that roughly correlates
with the ‘‘evolutionary distance’’ with E. coli thioredoxin as
measured by the fraction of amino acid sequence identity (Fig-
ure 3). In fact, even the thioredoxins that are more evolutionary
distant from E. coli thioredoxin can compensate growth defi-
ciency to some measurable extent, as shown by generation
times significantly shorter than that for the E. coli Trx� strain (Fig-
ure 3). That is, the thioredoxins from the eukaryotic branch,

 including human thioredoxin, as well as the thioredoxins
corresponding to �4 billion years nodes (last bacterial com-
mon ancestor [LBCA], last archaeal common ancestor [LACA],
archaeal-eukaryotic common ancestor [AECA]; see Figure 1)
display some degree of functionality within Escherichia coli.
As shown in Figure 3, we actually performed generation
time determinations at different temperatures within the range
21�C–42�C in an attempt to determine whether any of the
observed effects on generation time could be linked to protein
stability. Resurrected Precambrian thioredoxins have been
previously shown to display much enhanced stability when
compared with their modern mesophilic counterparts (Perez-Ji-
menez et al., 2011; Romero-Romero et al., 2016). This high
stability may plausibly reflect that Precambrian (in particular,
Archaean) oceans were hot (Knauth, 2005; Robert and Chaussi-
don, 2006; Gaucher et al., 2008; Romero-Romero et al., 2016).
Still, last common ancestor of cyanobacterial, deinococcus,
and thermus groups (LPBCA) thioredoxin is the most stable
among the studied resurrected proteins (denaturation tempera-
ture of �123�C) (Perez-Jimenez et al., 2011) and this might spe-
cifically reflect a high temperature local environment, as the
LPBCA node is the ancestor of many modern thermophilic or-
ganisms (Perez-Jimenez et al., 2011). Interestingly, LPBCA thio-
redoxin seems to deviate somewhat, in particular at 42�C, from
the correlation between compensation of the growth deficiency
and evolutionary distance from E. coli thioredoxin (Figure 3).

Generation times for E. coli Trx� strain complemented with plasmids containing the genes of laboratory resurrections of Precambrian thioredoxins, as well as the
genes of human and E. coli thioredoxins. For comparison, generation times of the non-complemented E. coli Trx� strain are also shown. Experiments were
performed at four different temperatures. In all cases, four to six independent determinations were carried out and the average values are shown with error bars
that correspond to the calculated SDs. Data are plotted versus the evolutionary distance to the E. coli thioredoxin 1 as measured by sequence identity. Such
calculation is of course not possible for the non-complemented E. coli Trx� strain. For representation purposes, a sequence identity of zero has been assigned to
data for the non-complemented strain. The data labeled Trx correspond to the E. coli Trx� strain complemented with E. coli thioredoxin 1.

 The deviation is in the direction of decreasing generation time,
i.e., in the direction of increasing fitness.
Effect of Precambrian Thioredoxins on the Propagation
of Bacteriophage T7 within E. coli
We subsequently tested whether the bacteriophage T7 could
propagate within E. coli Trx� strains complemented with plas-
mids bearing ancestral thioredoxin genes. To this end, we per-
formed experiments in which a given volume of a cell suspension
was mixed with the same volume of a dilution from a stock virus
solution, mixed with agar, and plated. After overnight incubation
at 37�C, plaques are observed in a lawn of growing cells where
virus infection and subsequent virus propagation to neighboring
cells has occurred. The numbers of plaques can be easily con-
verted into numbers of plaque-forming units per mL in the stock
virus solution. Following standard protocols, we performed ex-
periments for each strain with serial 10-fold dilutions of the virus
stock solution. Furthermore, we made a substantial number (on
the order of ten per dilution) of replicate plates for each dilution.
For the E. coli Trx+ strain and for an E. coli Trx� strain comple-
mented with E. coli thioredoxin, plaques were observed even
at high phage dilutions and a value of �109 plaque-forming units
per mL could be calculated from the plaque counting. Similar re-
sults were obtained for an E. coli Trx� strain complemented with
the ancestral LGPCA thioredoxin, which is evolutionary close to
E. coli thioredoxin (sequence identity 0.83: Figure 1). However,
for LPBCA thioredoxin (sequence identity with E. coli thioredoxin
of 0.57), plaques were observed only at the highest virus concen-
tration used and, even at those concentrations, they were
observed only occasionally. Specifically, out of 36 plates made
with the E. coli Trx� strain complemented with LPBCA thiore-
doxin, only nine displayed plaques and, in fact, seven plates
showed barely one to two plaques. These results point to �102
or less plaque-forming units per mL, a value that is many orders
of magnitude below the �109 plaque-forming units found for
E. coli thioredoxin. The ratio of these two numbers yields an ef-
ficiency of virus propagation for LPBCA thioredoxin of �10�7
or less (with the propagation efficiency for E. coli thioredoxin
set to unity). We performed a more detailed analysis of the effi-
ciency of virus propagation with LPBCA thioredoxin on the basis
of an additional set of data obtained using the same phage stock
under the same conditions. Of the 15 plates prepared, 9 showed
no plaques, 4 showed 1 plaque, one showed 2 plaques and one
showed 3 plaques. Fitting this data to the Poisson distribution
yields and average number of plaques per plate of 0.56 with an
associated standard error (estimated by bootstrapping) of
0.20. The amount of phage present in each plate was equivalent
to 10 mL of the stock solution, leading to 56 ± 20 plaque-forming
units per mL with LPBCA thioredoxin. The same stock solution
had 1.3 3 109 plaque-forming units per mL when used to
infect the strain complemented with E. coli thioredoxin. The
efficiency of virus propagation with the ancestral protein is,
therefore, �5 3 10�8.
No plaques could be detected, not even at the highest virus
concentration used when an E. coli Trx� strain was comple-
mented with any of all the other thioredoxins studied in this
work. That is, in these experiments, the efficiency of virus
propagation for LBCA, LACA, AECA, last eukaryotic common
ancestor (LECA), last common ancestor of fungi and animals
(LAFCA), and human thioredoxins is indistinguishable from
zero. Therefore, a plot of efficiency of virus propagation versus
evolutionary distance to E. coli thioredoxin (Figure 4) calls to
mind a step function with the step comparatively close to
E. coli thioredoxin. This is in sharp contrast with the much less
abrupt variation seen with the generation time (Figures 3
and 4). The implication is that ancestral thioredoxins that show
substantial redox functionality within E. coli (as determined by
their capability to rescue the slower-growth phenotype of an
E. coli Trx� strain) do not allow (or substantially limit) phage prop-
agation in E. coli.
The experiments described in the preceding paragraphs
where carried out under basal thioredoxin expression levels.
For some selected cases, we also performed experiments
under overexpression conditions that may lead to a substantial

 fraction of the total protein concentration in the cell being
thioredoxin. Specifically, we used the maximum isopropyl
b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG)
concentration
(10
mM)
that leads to overexpression without compromising growth.
We found efficiencies of virus propagation that were increased
with respect to the basal-level values discussed in the preced-
ing paragraph, but also that were still substantially smaller than
the propagation efficiency for E. coli thioredoxin (taken as the
value of reference of unity). Specifically, we found efficiencies
of virus propagation of approximately 10�3, 10�5, 10�5, and
10�6 for LPBCA, LBCA, LACA, and human thioredoxins,
respectively. These results seem to disfavor the possibility
that the ancestral thioredoxins are efficiently recruited by the
phage and the low propagation efficiency is exclusively due
to very low processivity of the replisomes formed with the
ancestral proteins. They also disfavor that the occasional pla-
ques detected with LPBCA thioredoxin under basal expression
and high virus concentration (preceding paragraph) are due
to our virus sample containing a few mutant phages that can
recruit the ancestral thioredoxin. Note that, in these two sce-
narios, increasing thioredoxin concentration within E. coli would
not be expected to increase propagation efficiency. Overall, it
seems more likely at this stage that the very low virus propaga-
tion efficiency found for most ancestral thioredoxins is primarily
due to their association with the other molecular components
of the phage replisome being highly improbable for thermody-
namic or kinetic reasons.
We also explored the possibility that the occasional plaques
detected with LPBCA thioredoxin were related to virus evolution
during the efficiency of propagation experiments. We thus iso-
lated phages from eight such plaques and tested in liquid culture
their capability to lyse the E. coli Trx� strain complemented either
with E. coli thioredoxin or with LPBCA thioredoxin. The eight vi-
rus samples were found to efficiently lyse the strain comple-
mented with E. coli thioredoxin, as shown by a sharp decrease
of the absorbance at 600 nm from its initial value of �0.5. On
the other hand, strong lysis was not observed with the strain
complemented with the ancestral LPBCA thioredoxin. In fact,
for five of the virus samples tested, absorbance at 600 nm was
found to increase with time in a manner similar to the control
growth curve (i.e., the absorbance versus time profile deter-
mined in the absence of virus). On the other hand, for three of
the samples, absorbance at 600 nm changed comparatively little
with time, indicating arrested growth and likely some degree of
lysis. Virus evolution during the efficiency of propagation exper-
iment is a plausible explanation for the results obtained with
these three virus samples.
Finally, we were interested in assessing the extent to which our
conclusions could be affected by the fact that natural viral pop-
ulations are typically quasi-species as a result of high mutation
rates. For this purpose, we used the T7 Line 1, a synthetic T7
collection of mutants obtained after a growth for 200 generations
in the presence of a mutagen. T7 Line 1 has a genomic rate of
four nonlethal mutations per generation, which means three or-
ders of magnitude larger than the average value for DNA organ-
isms such as T7 (Springman et al., 2010) (see Experimental Pro-
cedures). Particularly, T7 Line 1 comprises approximately seven
missense mutations with frequencies of R0.75 in and around the
polymerase gp5 gene. We found that T7 Line 1 propagated with
similar efficiency in an E. coli Trx+ strain and in an E. coli Trx�
strain complemented with E. coli thioredoxin and complemented
with the ancestral LGPCA thioredoxin. The E. coli Trx� strain
complemented with LPBCA thioredoxin produced plaques with
an efficiency of six to seven orders of magnitude lower than
E. coli thioredoxin. No progeny from T7 Line 1 was obtained
with the rest of ancestral thioredoxins and with human thiore-
doxin. Therefore, the results obtained with the T7 wild-type (Fig-
ure 4 and first paragraph in this section) and with T7 Line 1 are
essentially identical.
DISCUSSION
In the present work, we have provided experimental evidence
that a back-to-the-ancestor replacement on a proviral factor
may bypass virus adaptation for recruitment of the modern pro-
tein and confer virus resistance. Of course, for this approach to
work, the ancestral protein must display functionality within the
modern organism, in such a way that organismal fitness is not
fatally compromised by the replacement. In the specific case
studied here, we had to ‘‘travel back in time’’ to �2.5 billion years
ago (the age of the LPBCA node: see Figure 1) to find an ances-
tral thioredoxin that prevents propagation of bacteriophage T7 in
E. coli. This long backward time-travel may reflect that the inter-
action of the thioredoxin-binding-domain of the virus gp5 poly-
merase with E. coli thioredoxin involves the burial of the active
site cysteines (Doublie
´ et al., 1998). Consequently, many of the
mutations at the interaction surface that could easily prevent
recruitment may also impair the normal redox function of thiore-
doxin and, therefore, will not be accepted. Note, nevertheless,
that different molecular interaction scenarios will lead to different
outcomes. For instance, if recruitment and ‘‘normal’’ function-
ality of the protein within the modern organism depend on inter-
actions at different molecular surfaces, we may plausibly expect
that even comparatively young ancestral forms may avoid being
recruited.
From a more general viewpoint, the results reported here point
to a strategy to the engineering of virus resistance. More specif-
ically, the proof of concept we have provided here immediately
suggests a reasonable approach to the engineering of virus-
resistant plants. Such approach will involve the following steps:
(1) A known proviral factor in a plant is selected as a target.
Obviously, this factor would be a protein that is hijacked
(or suspected to be hijacked) by the virus or viruses for
which we wish to engineer resistance.
(2) The known sequence of this protein is used as a search
query in a sequence database.
(3) The sequences recovered from the search (belonging to
homologs of the targeted protein) are aligned and the
alignment is used as input for ancestral sequence recon-
struction.
(4) The ‘‘modern’’ proviral factor is replaced by a recon-
structed ancestral counterpart. Actually, ancestral se-
quences for many phylogenetic nodes can be derived
from a single alignment of modern proteins and, therefore,
the replacement could be actually performed with many
1252
Cell Reports 19, 1247–1256, May 9, 2017
 different ancestral proteins leading to many engineered
plant variants.
(5) The engineered plant variants are screened for fitness un-
der conditions of interest (normal growth conditions, for
instance) and for virus resistance.
While this protocol to virus-resistant plants is obviously a pro-
posal to be tested by future work, it is important to note that all
the steps involved should be feasible. We elaborate on this in
some detail below:
Viruses have a limited coding capacity (this is particularly true
for the more common plant RNA viruses) and rely heavily on the
recruitment of many host factors. Different approaches to iden-
tify such proviral factors have been developed in recent years
(Wang, 2015; Sasvari and Nagy, 2016), and databases and
search engines for virus-host interactions are currently available
(e.g., http://virhostnet.prabi.fr; http://virusmentha.uniroma2.it).
Clearly, therefore, the first step in the protocol (selecting a pro-
viral host factor as target) is feasible, inasmuch as the 3D-struc-
ture of the targeted proviral factor or the mechanism of recruit-
ment would not be required to be known.
The database search of the second step is also feasible
because the very large (and exponentially growing) sequence
databases available in the post-genomic era make it likely that
a substantial number of homologous sequences are recovered
when using the sequence of the targeted proviral factor as
query. It is perhaps worth noting that the current version of
the Uniprot database includes 38,327 entries from 2,001 species
of
Viridiplantae
(http://www.uniprot.org/biocuration_project/
Plants/statistics). Ancestral sequence reconstruction (step 3)
is a well-known bioinformatics procedure and can be carried
out using software that is widely available and that has been
described in some detail in several recent reviews (for instance,
see Table 1 in Gumulya and Gillam [2017]).
Recent advances in gene-editing methodologies using site-
specific nucleases (Whitham and Hajimorad, 2016) make it
feasible to perform the back-to-the-ancestral-form replacement
of step 4. Possibly, the most direct approach at the current stage
of development would be the CRISPR-Cas system with homolo-
gous recombination (HR) (Shan et al., 2014; Bortesi and Fischer,
2015; Puchta, 2016). HR involves a repair template that includes
the DNA sequence to be inserted into the broken chromosome.
In the context of our proposal, the repair template would include
a reconstructed ancestral sequence. HR is considered as
more challenging that the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
method used to generate knockouts. Still, targeted gene inser-
tion using HR has been demonstrated in plants (for instance,
see Shan et al. [2013] and Table 3 in Bortesi and Fischer
[2015]). Furthermore, the HR methodology is likely to be exten-
sively developed in the near future due to its many potential ap-
plications (Voytas and Gao, 2014).
Certainly, viruses have an enormous potential for rapid
adaptation and can evolve to overcome natural or engineered
resistance (Whitham and Hajimorad, 2016). Still, the problem
of virus adaptation can be rationally addressed within the
context of resistance engineering through ancestral replace-
ment. First, the ‘‘older’’ ancestral proteins will likely have large
numbers of mutational differences with their modern counter-
part (the hijacked proviral factor), thus making it more difficult
for the virus to adapt and recruit them. Certainly, the ‘‘older’’
ancestral proteins are more likely to display a limited func-
tionality within the modern organism, thus compromising its
fitness. However, ancestral sequences for many different
phylogenetic nodes (of different age) can be derived from a
single alignment of modern sequences. Plausibly, it should
be possible to find ancestral proteins (perhaps of ‘‘intermedi-
ate age’’) displaying the right balance between limited effect
on organismal fitness and resistance to recruitment despite
virus adaptation. Second, ancestral replacement does not
have to be limited to a single proviral factor. Replacement on
multiple proviral factors will lead to a greater barrier to virus
adaptation. As suggested by one of the anonymous reviewers
of this work, maybe multiple, less divergent ancestral proteins
could alleviate the negative impacts on fitness while represent-
ing an insurmountable barrier for viruses on the long term and
not only on the short term.
Finally, we note that resurrected ancestral proteins typically
display large sequence differences with all their modern counter-
parts. For instance, when the sequence of LPBCA thioredoxin is
used as query, a Blast search on the non-redundant protein
sequence database recovers a modern protein with only 70%
identity with LPBCA-thioredoxin as the closest hit. The large
sequence differences between ancestral and modern proteins
suggest that back-to-the-ancestral-form replacement on a pro-
viral factor could also provide a substantial barrier to cross-spe-
cies transmission.
On a different note, this work shows that even laboratory rep-
resentations of proteins near the origin of life may, at least in
some cases, display some significant degree of functionality
within a modern organism, despite the very large number of
mutational changes between the modern and the ancestral pro-
teins. This is a remarkable result, particularly in view of recent re-
ports of strong negative correlation between estimated evolu-
tionary age and the effect of the reconstructed protein on
organismal fitness (Hobbs et al., 2015). However, our results
point to an important role of the specificity of functional intermo-
lecular interactions in determining the functionality of resur-
rected ancestral proteins within a modern organism. For pro-
teins whose function involves molecular interactions that are
not highly specific, we may expect a comparatively weak nega-
tive correlation between evolutionary age and the effect on
organismal fitness. In any case, it is plausible that the fitness
cost of replacing a modern protein with the laboratory resurrec-
tion of one of its ancestors could be compensated by similar
modern-to-ancestor replacements on its interacting partners,
thus providing an approach to study the evolution of relevant
biological interactions. A few years before his death (in 2013),
Emile Zuckerkandl (considered, together with Linus Pauling, as
one of the founders of the Molecular Evolution field) wrote that
‘‘the greatest interest of the reconstruction of ancestral informa-
tional macromolecules may well lie in the reconstruction of their
interactions’’ (Zuckerkandl, 2007). We demonstrate here that
ancestral proteins may display functionality within a modern
organism to an extent that is related to the specificity of their
interactions, thus opening up the possibility of finally realizing
Zuckerkandl’s proposal.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Strains and Growth Conditions
Bacterial strains used in this study were Escherichia coli strains DHB3
(araD139 D(ara-leu)7697 DlacX74 galE galK rpsL phoR D(phoA)PvuII DmalF3
thi), DHB4 (DHB3 F0 [lacpro lacIQ]) (Boyd et al., 1987), and FA41 (DHB4 trxA
trxC). These strains were kindly donated by Jon Beckwith (Harvard Medical
School). An F0 minus FA41 derivative susceptible of infection by T7 phage
was obtained in this work (see below).
Cells were grown routinely on lysogeny broth (LB) medium (Bertani, 1951),
except that glucose was omitted. Kanamycin 30 mg/mL was added for plasmid
selection. Cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm at 37�C un-
less otherwise indicated.
Setting up the System to Study Fitness Effects of Thioredoxin
Variants
The impacts on fitness of thioredoxin variants were studied using DHB4
and FA41, the two otherwise isogenic E. coli strains with or without the two
thioredoxin genes identified in this organism, trxA and trxC (see above).
FA41 showed a defect in growth when compared to its parental strain
DHB4. This deficiency was readily apparent even at optimum growth condi-
tions (Figure 2A). We took advantage of this phenotype to test the ability of thi-
oredoxin variants to restore normal growth.
FA41 was adapted for expression of thioredoxin variants under a T7 pro-
moter in pET derivative plasmids (Novagen) (see below). We were inclined to
use this system instead of allelic replacement, because chromosomal expres-
sion of thioredoxin in E. coli is under the control of environmental factors
included in the laboratory conditions used here. Expression of target genes
from T7 promoters requires the presence of the specific RNA polymerase
from the T7 phage. This gene was introduced in FA41 by lysogenization with
lDE3 (Novagen), a modified lD69 phage that bears the T7 RNA polymerase
gene under the control of the lacUV5 promoter.
Lysogenization of FA41 was performed following manufacturer recommen-
dations (lDE3 Lysogenization Kit, Novagen). This system is designed so that
growing colonies are expected to be stable lDE3 lysogens. In effect, because
lDE3 lacks the int function, it cannot integrate or be excised from the chromo-
some. Therefore, lysogenization of lDE3 requires coinfection with a Helper
Phage providing it. In addition, a Selection Phage is also included in the infec-
tion event; this phage cannot infect lDE3 lysogens and kills non-lDE3 cells,
ensuring that only lysogens survive. Specifically, the following procedure
was carried out: one independent colony of the thioredoxin minus strain
FA41 was grown at 37�C in LB medium supplemented with 10 mM MgSO4
and 0.2% maltose (to induce expression of the lambda receptor). At an absor-
bance at 600 nm of 0.5, 1 mL of the culture was coinfected with 108 PFU (pla-
que-forming units) of lDE3, 108 PFU of Helper Phage, and 108 PFU of Selec-
tion Phage, and the suspension was incubated for 20 min at 37�C to allow
phage adsorption. Mixtures were plated on LB and incubated overnight at
37�C. Growing colonies were putative lDE3 lysogens. A number of these can-
didates were resistant to infection by Selection Phage, suggesting that they
were in fact lDE3 lysogens. We randomly selected one of these colonies
and further verified the presence of T7 RNA polymerase in it (see below).
Plasmids with thioredoxin variants where derivatives of pET30a(+)::trxA in
which the open reading frame of thioredoxin 1 from E. coli followed by a
stop codon was cloned as an NdeI-XhoI fragment under the control of a T7
promoter between the same sites in vector pET30a(+) (Novagen) (Godoy-
Ruiz et al., 2005). The genes from human and ancestral thioredoxins were
also cloned in pET30a(+) as previously described (Ingles-Prieto et al., 2013).
Briefly, PCR-amplified open reading frames from the corresponding pEQ80L
derivatives (Perez-Jimenez et al., 2011) were obtained using oligonucleotides
that incorporated NdeI and XhoI restriction sites at their 50 and 30 ends, respec-
tively. The PCR fragments where digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned
between the same sites in vector pET30a(+). Sequencing confirmed both
constructions arrangements and the absence of mutations within the coding
sequences of these genes.
FA41(DE3) cells were made chemically competent and transformed with the
T7 derivative plasmids bearing thioredoxin variants, following the procedure
by Nishimura et al. (1990).
Validation of the System
We first analyzed the inducibility of thioredoxin gene expression under the con-
trol of the T7 promoter. The candidate FA41(DE3) was made competent and
transformed with pET30a(+)::trxA. We incubated this clone in the presence
of 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside), and the corresponding
cell extract was compared with that of non-induced cells in SDS-PAGE
analyses. A protein band with the expected size of thioredoxin was obtained
under inducing conditions (data not shown). This result indicated that the
selected clone overexpressed thioredoxin and therefore contained the T7
RNA polymerase.
We also compared the growth of the thioredoxin-deficient strain comple-
mented with thioredoxin with that of wild-type E. coli. We need to mention first
that lysogenization with lDE3 had no effect on growth of FA41 (Figure 2A). Thi-
oredoxin in pET30a(+)::trxA complemented the growth deficiency of FA41(DE3)
even in the absence of an inducer. This presumably occurs due to the leakage of
expression of T7 RNA polymerase from the lacUV5 promoter (Studier and Mof-
fatt, 1986). Therefore, basal expression of thioredoxin in cultures of FA41(DE3)
(pET30a(+)::trxA) was sufficient to restore normal growth (Figure 2A).
To further verify that this complementation was also effective in all the cul-
ture conditions of this study, we measured generation times (see below) of
DHB4 and FA41(DE3) with and without pET30a(+)::trxA at different tempera-
tures. Doubling times of the complemented strain were similar to those of
wild-type E. coli in all conditions (Figure 3). Therefore, we confirmed the validity
of this system for the study of the in vivo performance of thioredoxin variants.
Determination of Generation Times
The generation time, i.e., the time interval required for division of strains, was
calculated by standard methods. Specifically, preinocula of the appropriate
strains in LB medium were incubated overnight at 37�C and 180 rpm. Cultures
were diluted 1/200 times in fresh medium and incubated at the desired temper-
ature and 180 rpm. Samples were taken along the bacterial growth process,
and absorbance at 600 nm (A600) was measured as function of time. Genera-
tion time values were obtained from the slopes of plots of logarithm of absor-
bance at 600 nm versus time. Results are given as the average ± SD of four to
six independent experiments.
Determination of Efficiency of Plating by T7 Phage
Curation of F0
Growth of bacteriophage T7 in E. coli strains harboring F plasmids such as
FA41 is abortive (reviewed in Molineux, 1991). In order to test the infectivity
of T7 on E. coli with thioredoxin variants, we carried out the curation of F0 factor
in FA41(DE3). F0 is spontaneously lost fairly frequently and clones that lack it
can be easily obtained and isolated in solid media. Because F0 in FA41 carries
the lac operon (see above), colonies without it cannot hydrolyze the chromo-
genic lactose analog X-gal (5-bromo-4-cholo-3-indolyl b-D-galactopyrano-
side) and therefore are white in a medium containing it. FA41(DE3) was
streaked on LB plates with 50 mg/mL of X-gal, and white colonies were repuri-
fied several times to confirm clone homogeneity.
One well-isolated colony was selected and designed as FA41 F� (DE3). The
Lac- phenotype of this clone could be due either to F0 loss or to recombination
or deletion of the lac genes. To verify the curation of F0 in this clone, we tested
its immunity to f2 phage (kindly provided by Marjorie Russell, The Rockefeller
University), which infects only male strains (Loeb and Zinder, 1961). Contrary
to FA41(DE3), strain FA41 F� (DE3) was not infected by f2, confirming that it
was curated of the F0 factor. Finally, FA41 F� (DE3) supported the growth
of T7 when transformed with pET30(a)::trxA (data not shown). Strain DHB3
(F� DHB4) was used as negative control strain in experiments for infection
by f2 and as a positive control in those of infection by T7.
Infection by T7 Phage
Escherichia coli bacteriophage T7 (ATCC BAA-1025-B2) was used to test the
efficacy of performance of human and ancestral thioredoxins in the T7 phage
cycle. For that, we independently infected FA41 F� (DE3) transformed with the
pET-derivative plasmids bearing E.coli, human, or ancestral thioredoxins.
DHB3 was used as a positive control and untransformed FA41 F� (DE3) was
the negative control. We carried out the bacterial infections using MOI that
would render isolated and countable infection plaques. In the cases in which
no plaques were obtained at this MOI, the phage load was progressively
1254
Cell Reports 19, 1247–1256, May 9, 2017
 increased up to an MOI that would still allow the formation of a lawn of growing
cells.
Infection experiments were carried out as follows. Phage was serially diluted
in dilution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgSO4).
Strains were grown in LB medium at 37�C to an approximate absorbance at
600 nm of 0.5. At that point, 100 mL of cells were mixed with 100 mL of the appro-
priate phage dilution, and the suspension was mixed with �4 mL of molten top
agar (Elbing and Brent, 2002). Plates were allowed to cool down for solidifica-
tion and incubated overnight at 37�C. Plaque-forming units were then deter-
mined by visual inspection and counting. Control experiments showed that
no plaques were obtained with E. coli Trx� strain, and the efficiency of propa-
gation of T7 on E. coli Trx� with E. coli thioredoxin on a plasmid was similar to
that of E. coli Trx+ for any given phage suspension. Infection efficiency of E. coli
Trx� with human and ancestral thioredoxins was calculated as the efficiency of
propagation of each strain relative to that of E. coli Trx� with E. coli thioredoxin
on a plasmid. Data given in Figure 4 are the average of several (at least six) in-
dependent determinations with the error bars corresponding to the SD.
The ability of ancestral and human thioredoxins to support growth of a highly
mutated T7 population was tested using T7 Line 1 (kindly provided by James J.
Bull, University of Texas at Austin). T7 line 1 was obtained by evolution of T7
phage growing in the susceptible E. coli strain IJ1133 in the presence of the
mutagen N-methyl-N0-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The T7 population consists
of a collection of mutants obtained after �200 generations on IJ1133 by serial
transfer, with approximately four viable mutations per generation (Springman
et al., 2010). Infections by T7 Line 1 were carried out following the same pro-
cedure as with wild-type T7 phage.
In the infection experiments in which expression of thioredoxins was
induced by IPTG, cultures where incubated to an approximate absorbance
at 600 nm of 0.15. At this point, 10 mM IPTG was added to one half of the cul-
ture and the rest was kept as un-induced control. Incubation proceeded for 2
additional hours to allow induction of thioredoxin expression over basal levels
prior to phage infection. Infection experiments were conducted as detailed in
the above paragraph with the exception that plates from induced samples
where supplemented with 10 mM IPTG.
