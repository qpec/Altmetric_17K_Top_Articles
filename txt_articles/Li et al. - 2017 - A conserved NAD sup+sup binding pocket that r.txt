DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are
unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no
known function. We show that NHDs are NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding
of NAD+ to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from
inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair
protein. As mice age and NAD+ concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to
PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the
abundance of NAD+. Thus, NAD+ directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the
modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging.
T
he oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+) is critical for redox re-
actions and as a substrate for signaling by
the PARPs [poly(adenosine diphosphate–
ribose) polymerases] and the sirtuins (SIRT1
to SIRT7) in the regulation of DNA repair, energy
metabolism, cell survival, and circadian rhythms,
among other functions (1–3). Raising NAD+ concen-
trations or directly activating the sirtuins delays
aging in yeast, flies, and mice (4–6). Increased
amounts of sirtuin and PARP1 activity are also
associated with improved health and longevity
in humans (4, 7). Thus, understanding how cells
modulate NAD+ and PARP1 activity may shed
light on new therapies for major diseases, such
as diabetes and cancer, and possibly also the
aging process (3, 8).
Whether NAD+ has a third role in cells as a
direct regulator of protein-protein interactions
is a matter of speculation (9). The protein DBC1
(deleted in breast cancer 1) is one of the most
abundant yet enigmatic proteins in mammals
(10, 11), with a conserved domain similar to Nudix
hydrolases that hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates
but lacking catalytic activity due to the absence of
key catalytic residues (9, 12, 13).
DBC1 is known to inhibit SIRT1 (14), so we
tested whether DBC1 might also inhibit PARP1
as a way to coregulate these two major NAD+-
responsive pathways. In human embryonic kidney
(HEK) 293T cells, a SIRT1-independent interaction
between DBC1 and PARP1 was detected (Fig. 1A
and fig. S1, A and B). The PARP1 inhibitors PJ-34
and 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) had no effect on
the interaction (fig. S1C), nor did overexpression
of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–ribose hy-
drolase MACROD1 (MACRO domain containing 1)
(fig. S1D) or the PARP1 catalytic mutant, PARP1-
E988K (where E988K denotes Glu988→Lys988) (fig.
S1E). Thus, PARP1-DBC1 binding is independent of
PARP1 catalytic activity.
The PARP1-DBC1 complex was abrogated by
NAD+ in a concentration-dependent manner,
whereas the SIRT1-DBC1 interaction was unaf-
fected within physiological ranges of NAD+ (15),
except at 500 mM (Fig. 1B). This effect was sur-
prisingly specific: 200 mM of nicotinamide mononu-
cleotide (NMN), nicotinamide riboside (NR),
adenosine, adenosine triphosphate, and ADP-
ribose, or 500 mM of nicotinamide and its struc-
tural analog 3-AB (2 mM), had no effect on the
PARP1-DBC1 complex, and NADH (the reduced
form of NAD+) (200 mM) or adenine (200 mM)
were less effective than NAD+ (Fig. 1C and fig.
S2, A to C).
DBC1 mutants lacking regions outside the
NHD (DBC11-500 and DBC1243-923) behaved sim-
ilarly to full length DBC1 (Fig. 1C), whereas
MACROD1, poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase
(PARG) (fig. S2D), or PARP1 inhibitors (fig. S1C)
had no effect. PARP1-E988K behaved similarly
to the wild type (fig. S1E and fig. S2E). Carba-
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, a nonreactive
PARP1 substrate, abrogated the complex (fig. S2F).
Thus, disruption of the PARP1-DBC1 complex by
NAD+ does not require NAD+ cleavage or a cova-
lently attached ADP-ribose.
In HEK 293T cells, FK866, an inhibitor of
NAD+ biosynthesis (16), increased the PARP1-
DBC1 interaction (Fig. 1D), as did depletion of
NAD+ by genotoxic stress (fig. S3A). Interventions
that increased NAD+ abundance (5, 17) decreased
the PARP1-DBC1 interaction (Fig. 1, E and F, and
fig. S3B). The SIRT1-DBC1 interaction was slightly
diminished by FK866, possibly through the seques-
tration of DBC1 by PARP1 (fig. S3C). Together,
these data indicate that NAD+ inhibits PARP1-
DBC1 complex formation in cells.
To better understand the mechanism by which
NAD+ inhibits complex formation, we identified
the DBC1 domain necessary for interaction with
PARP1. A truncated version of DBC1 lacking an
NHD conserved region (DBC1D354-396) had im-
paired PARP1 binding in cells (fig. S4, A to D),
whereas a recombinant DBC1 mutant containing
the NHD domain (DBC1-NHD, residues 239 to 553)
bound to a truncated PARP1 lacking the catalytic
domain (PARP1-DCAT, residues 1 to 654) (fig. S5, A
and B) and was not abrogated by NAD+, indicating
that residues outside the minimal NHD domain may
be necessary for NAD+ to dissociate the complex.
DBC1 interacted with the BRCT [BRCA1 (breast
cancer 1) C-terminal] domain of PARP1 (fig. S6A)
(18) but not with the PARP1 catalytic domain
or PARP2, which lacks a BRCT domain (fig. S6,
B to D). A BRCT-deficient PARP1 had higher activ-
ity than the wild type (fig. S6, E to F), together
indicating that PARP1-DBC1 is mediated by con-
tacts between the NHD and PARP1-BRCT.
We generated an atomic-resolution homology
model for the human DBC1-NHD. Our model is
based on five known crystal structures of Nudix
domains from other proteins (Fig. 2A, fig. S7,
and supplementary materials and methods).
NAD+ had the best fit of all riboside nucleotides.
Substitutions of the amino acids predicted to alter
NAD+ binding inhibited PARP1-DBC1 binding
either slightly (K353A and P366A) or substan-
tially (Q391A) (Fig. 2B and fig. S8, A and B).
Radio-labeled or biotin-labeled NAD+ directly
bound to DBC1 (Fig. 2, C and D) and was com-
peted off with unlabeled NAD+ (fig. S9, A to D).
Partial deletion of the NHD (DBC1D354-396) or Q391A
(DBC1Q391A) reduced NAD+ binding, whereas N-
terminal and C-terminal truncations did not (Fig.
2, C to D, and fig. S9E). Mutation of C387, a
residue close to Q391 on the same helix (Fig. 2A),
also decreased NAD+ binding (Fig. 2D) and reduced
the responsiveness of the PARP1-DBC1 complex to
NAD+ (Fig. 2E).
PARP1 activity was inhibited by DBC1 in vitro
(Fig. 3A). In cells, knocking down DBC1 increased
both PAR [poly(ADP-ribose)] concentrations be-
fore and after exposure to paraquat, H2O2, or
etoposide (Fig. 3B and fig. S10, A to D) and the
abundance of mRNAs positively regulated by

 PARP1 (Fig. 3C) (19, 20). Reintroduction of wild-
type DBC1 reduced PARP1 activity and partially
restored gene expression, whereas DBC1Q391A
had no effect (Fig. 3C and fig. S10, E and F).
Reducing DBC1 lowered the abundance of the
phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (gH2AX)
(Fig. 3D), reduced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3E
and fig. S11A), increased cell survival after paraquat
treatment (fig. S11B), and increased both non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous
recombination (HR) pathways in a PARP1-dependent
manner (Fig. 3F and fig. S11C). Similarly, NMN
treatment reduced the number of gH2AX foci in
paraquat-treated primary human fibroblasts (Fig.
3G and fig. S12). No other major DNA repair
proteins appeared to change their interactions
with the PARP1-DBC1 complex in the presence of
NMN or DNA damage (fig. S13, A and B), though
we cannot rule out other interactions. These
results are consistent with a model in which
binding of NAD+ to the DBC1-NHD regulates the
two major pathways of DNA repair.
DNA repair declines with age (21), in concert
with lower PARP1 activity (7). Our data indicate

 that a cause may be increased binding of DBC1
to PARP1 as NAD+ levels decline during aging.
To test this, we examined the effect of NMN treat-
ment on young and old mice. Hepatic NAD+ con-
centrations were lower in old mice (Fig. 4A),
coincident with a higher amount of the DBC1-
PARP1 complex (Fig. 4B) and an increase in
gH2AX staining (Fig. 4C and fig. S14). A week of
NMN treatment (500 mg/kg per day intraperi-
toneally) increased hepatic NAD+ concentrations
and disrupted the PARP1-DBC1 complex in young
(fig. S15, A and B) and old mice (Fig. 4, D and E)
and reduced the abundance of gH2AX in old mice
(Fig. 4C and fig. S14).
Old mice had lower levels of PARP1 activity
(Fig. 4F and fig. S16A) and a decreased response
to DNA damage (fig. S16B), and DBC1 knockout
mice had increased PARP1 activity (Fig. 4G and
fig. S16C). The reduced PARP1 activity in the old
mice was restored by NMN (Fig. 4F and fig. S16D)
but not if PARP1 activity was inhibited (fig. S16,
E and F). Total amounts of poly(ADP-ribosylation)
increased with age in the liver (4), possibly due to
reduced PARG abundance (fig. S17A). These data
indicate that the decline in NAD+ during aging
promotes the binding of DBC1 to PARP1, which
inhibits PARP1’s ability to mediate DNA repair.
Similar studies were conducted on old mice exposed
to gamma irradiation. NMN treatment (Fig. 4E)
reduced DNA damage (Fig. 4H and fig. S17, B and C)
and protected against alterations in white blood
cell counts, lymphocytes, and hemoglobin, even
when given after irradiation (Fig. 4, I and J, and
fig. S18, A to C).
These data show that NAD+ has a third func-
tion in cells: to directly regulate protein-protein

evolved to allow a cell to adapt to fluctuations in
NAD+ abundance without degrading it and, in
the case of DBC1, to serve as a negative-feedback
loop to prevent PARP1 from depleting NAD+
down to lethal levels during DNA damage (15)
(fig. S19). The data also provide an explanation
for why DBC1 mutations are associated with cancers
(22) and indicate that assessing DBC1 status in

Although the reason NAD+ declines with age is
unclear, this work provides a plausible expla-
nation for why DNA repair capacity declines as
we age (24), pointing to NAD+ replenishment
as a means of reducing the side effects of chemo-
therapy, protecting against radiation exposure,
and slowing the natural decline in DNA repair
capacity during aging.
