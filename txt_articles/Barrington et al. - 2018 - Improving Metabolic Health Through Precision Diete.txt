ABSTRACT The incidence of diet-induced metabolic disease has soared over the last half-century, despite national efforts to improve
health through universal dietary recommendations. Studies comparing dietary patterns of populations with health outcomes have
historically provided the basis for healthy diet recommendations. However, evidence that population-level diet responses are reliable
indicators of responses across individuals is lacking. This study investigated how genetic differences influence health responses to
several popular diets in mice, which are similar to humans in genetic composition and the propensity to develop metabolic disease, but
enable precise genetic and environmental control. We designed four human-comparable mouse diets that are representative of those
eaten by historical human populations. Across four genetically distinct inbred mouse strains, we compared the American diet’s impact
on metabolic health to three alternative diets (Mediterranean, Japanese, and Maasai/ketogenic). Furthermore, we investigated metab-
olomic and epigenetic alterations associated with diet response. Health effects of the diets were highly dependent on genetic
background, demonstrating that individualized diet strategies improve health outcomes in mice. If similar genetic-dependent diet
responses exist in humans, then a personalized, or “precision dietetics,” approach to dietary recommendations may yield better health
outcomes than the traditional one-size-fits-all approach.
KEYWORDS diet; mouse; metabolic syndrome
O
VER the last half-century, national dietary guidelines
have failed to improve metabolic health in the United
States, exemplified by the dramatic increase in metabolic
syndrome (Cook et al. 2003). National dietary guidelines
have largely been built upon epidemiological studies, which
show that dietary patterns across populations are strongly
correlated with the spectra of diseases (Knox 1977), and as
dietary patterns change, so do disease spectra (Kagan et al.
1974; O’Dea 1992). However, a major limitation of population-
level dietary studies is the absence of information on the re-
lationship between individual and population-level responses.
There are clear examples in which genetically related
subgroups within a population experience more severe health
effects than the population as a whole, exemplified by West-
ernized indigenous populations that have disproportionately
high incidences of type II diabetes (O’Dea 1992; Schulz et al.
2006). The importance of genetic background in diet re-
sponse is supported by the strong similarity in weight gain
within monozygotic twin pairs during long-term overfeeding
(Bouchard et al. 1990). Clinical studies find wide variation
across genetically diverse people in the health effects of diet,
including weight gain and risk for heart disease (Liu et al.

 1978; Dansinger et al. 2005; Hession et al. 2009). Some of the
variation has been attributed to dietary adherence (Toubro
and Astrup 1997). Yet, tightly controlled studies find exten-
sive heterogeneity in physiological responses to identical di-
ets (Levine et al. 1999; Zeevi et al. 2015), demonstrating that
innate differences between people contribute to the hetero-
geneous effects of diets.
Mousemodelsprovideapowerfulresourceforstudyingthe
interaction of genetics with diet. Similar to humans, geneti-
cally diverse mice vary in their susceptibility to diet-induced
metabolic disease, but enable greater control of genetic and
environmental factors. Studies in mice demonstrate that
obesity has a strong genetic component and that identical
diets affect weight gain differently across strains (West et al.
1992; Petro et al. 2004; Parks et al. 2013). While there are
differences in metabolism and metabolic disease between
mice and humans (Kennedy et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2016),
a number of research groups have demonstrated the value of
mouse studies in unraveling the genetic architecture under-
lying metabolic responses (Paigen 1995; Almind and Kahn
2004; Cheverud et al. 2004; Biddinger et al. 2005; Svenson
et al. 2007; Hill-Baskin et al. 2009; Shockley et al. 2009; Ussar
et al. 2015; Sinasac et al. 2016).
To explore the impact of the American diet on metabolic
health across genetically diverse individuals, we designed a
mouse version of the contemporary American diet and com-
pareditsmetabolichealtheffects tothatofamoretypicallyfed
control mouse diet across four inbred strains (A/J, C57BL/6J,
FVB/NJ, and NOD/ShiLtJ, denoted as A, B6, FVB, and NOD,
respectively). The clinical traits assayed were indicative of
metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the
risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. We then compared
each strain’s metabolic health when fed alternative human-
relevant diets, including a Mediterranean diet, a Japanese
diet, and a ketogenic diet analogous to that consumed by
the Maasai, a tribal group in Kenya. In addition, we evaluated
the liver metabolome and epigenetic changes underlying dif-
ferential diet response. The diet (or diets) that was healthiest
relative to the American diet was genetic-dependent, demon-
strating that health outcomes in mice are improved through
individualized dietary strategies, and raising the question of
whether the development and implementation of personal-
ized diet recommendations could also lead to better out-
comes in people.
Materials and Methods
Animals and husbandry
Four-week-old A, B6, FVB, and NOD mice were obtained from
The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and acclimated for
2weeks.Micewererandomizedintodietgroups.Twoequally-
sized and identical cohorts of five mice per diet, sex, and strain
(480 in total) were studied in two locations, North Carolina
(NC cohort) and Texas A&M University (TAMU cohort) over
6 months. The NC cohort was housed at the University of
North Carolina during the first 4 months for analysis of body
composition, metabolic rate, and physical activity. Mice were
then transferred to North Carolina State University for the
final 2 months for glucose tolerance testing (GTT), necropsy,
and tissue collection. Mice were housed five per cage and
maintained at 22� under a 12-hr light cycle; they were main-
tained and protocols followed in accordance with the Univer-
sity of North Carolina, North Carolina State University, and
Texas A&M University Institution Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee guidelines. Mice were killed with carbon dioxide, and
tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in formalin.
Diets
Powdered diets were designed in collaboration with Research
Diets (New Brunswick, NJ). Traditional Mediterranean
(D12052702) and Japanese (D12052703) diets were based
on the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Food Balance
Sheets from Greece and Japan in 1961 (Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations 2016). The American diet
(D12052705) was based on the US Department of Agricul-
ture’s 2008 Dietary Assessment of Major Food Trends
(National Cancer Institute 2015). The Maasai/ketogenic diet
(D12052706) was designed to allow mice to remain in keto-
sis, formulated with dairy sources as consumed by the Masaai
(Mann et al. 1965), and with menhaden oil and corn oil
added to ensure mice had essential lipids. Purified control
mouse diet (D12052701; Research Diets) was used as a con-
trol diet for comparison to the American diet. Diets were
designed to recapitulate human diets as closely as possible,
matching macronutrient ratio, fiber content, types of ingre-
dients, and fatty acid ratios to the human diets (Supplemen-
tal Material, Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, and Table S4 in
File S1). Protein sources used included beef protein to match
red meat intake, casein to match dairy intake, soy protein to
match soy intake, egg white protein to match egg and white
meat intake, and fish protein to match seafood intake. Corn-
starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, sucrose, and
fructose were matched accordingly to the types and amounts
of starches and sugars in the diets. Soybean oil, corn oil,
menhaden oil, sunflower oil, butter, lard, safflower oil, flax-
seed oil, and olive oil were used to reconstruct lipid profiles.
Body composition and weight
Body composition (lean and fat mass) was assessed in both
cohorts at 12 weeks (EchoMRI-130 Body Composition Ana-
lyzer). Body composition measurements were verified by
comparing lean and fat mass measurements to scale weight.
Food consumption
Food consumption was measured in the TAMU cohort at
14 weeks by singly housing in wire bottom cages over a paper
filter to collect spilled food. Starting, ending, and spilled-food
weights were recorded. Two 24-hr acclimation periods were
followed by two 24-hr testing periods. Each period was
separated by 3 days. Diet-by-strain groups had n = 4–10 mice
of both males and females, except female NOD mice fed the
400
W. T. Barrington et al.
 Maasai/ketogenic diet, which were omitted due to distress
during the acclimation period.
Fasting glucose and GTT
Fasting glucose concentrations were measured following a
6-hr fast in both cohorts after 16 weeks on the diet. Glucose
(2 g/kg) was administered by oral gavage. Blood glucose
levels were measured with a Bionome GM100 glucose mon-
itor (Bionome USA) at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Area under
the curve (from a baseline of 0) was calculated. All diet-strain
groups had n = 9–20 mice. One American FVB male and one
American B6 male did not show a change in blood glucose
after gavaging and were omitted. Two NOD ketogenic males
had glucose . 600 mg/dl (glucometer maximum) while fast-
ing or at the first time point and were omitted.
Liver triglycerides
Followingnecropsy,livertriglycerideconcentrationwasquan-
tified in both cohorts as previously described (Folch et al.
1957). Briefly, 50 mg pieces of liver were homogenized in a
2:1 chloroform–methanol solution. After 30 min of incuba-
tion, a sodium chloride solution was added to the solution
and vortexed. The lower phase was decanted and evaporated
under nitrogen steam. Each sample was resuspended in a
0.5% Triton X-100/PBS solution. After sonication, samples
were incubated at 55� for 5 min. Infinity Triglyceride reagent
(Thermo Scientific) was added and samples were incu-
bated for 5 min at 37�. Absorbance at 500 nm was measured
and compared to a standard curve to quantify triglyceride
concentration.
Metabolic rate and activity
Mice in the NC cohort were singly housed in Phenomaster
Metabolic Chambers (TSE Systems) at 12 weeks. After an 8-hr
acclimation period, data collection included two 12-hr night
cycles and one 12-hr day cycle. Heat expenditure, oxygen
consumption, and drinking volume were calculated per hour
and normalized to lean mass, which was assessed prior to
testing. Mice that failed to drink . 0.5 ml were omitted from
water intake analysis (n , 2 per diet-strain group). Activity
was determined by number of laser beam breaks in both
vertical and horizontal axes and calculated per hour. Hyper-
active mice (defined by activity . 100% strain mean) were
omitted from activity analysis (n # 1 per group). Respiratory
exchange rate (RER) was calculated as an average per hour.
Liver histology
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded right lobe liver samples were
sectioned at 5 mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The
extent of steatosis was assessed in a blinded fashion by a board-
certified veterinarian pathologist using a previously reported
scoring system for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Liang et al.
2014). Briefly
, the scoring system for macrovesicular steatosis,
microvesicular steatosis, and cellular hypertrophy was based
on the percentage of hepatocytes within the stained section.
These parameters utilized the following categories: 0 (, 5% of
hepatocytes), 1 (5–33%), 2 (34–66%), and 3 (. 66%). Inflam-
mation was evaluated by counting the number of inflammatory
foci per field, averaged across five fields of view at 1003 mag-
nification. The level of inflammation was assigned using the
following categories: 0 (normal, , 0.5), 1 (slight, 0.5–1.0),
2 (moderate, 1.0–2.0), and 3 (severe, . 2).
Blood lipids and biochemistry
Fasted insulin was measured following a 6-hr fast at 18 weeks
in both cohorts. Fasted blood samples were not collected from
NOD mice in cohort 2, as they showed distress during fasting.
Bloodwascollectedviasubmandibularbleed,placedonicefor
at least 30 min to allow clotting, then centrifuged at 10 3 g for
5 min in 1.1 ml Z-Gel microtubes (Sarstedt). Insulin concen-
trations were quantified using a Mouse Serum Adipokine
Immunoassay ELISA kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) on a Bio-Plex
200 System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and cholesterol analysis
was performed on serum samples taken at necropsy in both
cohorts. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture, chilled for
at least 30 min, then centrifuged at 10 3 g for 5 min in 1.1 ml
Z-Gel microtubes (Sarstedt). ALT activity was quantified in
duplicate using a fluorometric ALT Activity Assay Kit per the
manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma [Sigma Chemical], St.
Louis, MO). Total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were
measured in duplicate using a colorimetric Cholesterol Quan-
tification Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma).
Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing
DNA extraction and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing
(WGBS) were performed on liver samples from 32 males
spanning four diet-strain combinations: B6 control mouse
diet, B6 American diet, A strain control mouse diet, and A
strain American diet (n = 8 per group). Males were used
because they had the most divergent diet responses in the
B6 strain. Genomic DNA was isolated from liver using the
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and a
modified protocol as follows: after tissue lysis and prior to
spin column application, 50 mg of RNase A (Thermo Scien-
tific) was added to each sample and samples were incubated
at room temperature for 60 min. Samples were eluted in two
cycles, in 100 and 60 ml of elution buffer.
WGBS single indexed libraries were generated using NEB-
Next Ultra DNA library Prep kit for Illumina (New England
BioLabs, Beverly, MA), according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions with modifications. Next, 500 ng gDNA was quan-
tified by Qubid dsDNA BR assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
and 1% unmethylated l DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) was
spiked in to monitor bisulfite conversion efficiency. Samples
were fragmented with a Covaris S2 or LE220 sonicator to an
average insert size of 350 bp. Size selection was performed
using AMPure XP beads and insert sizes of 300–400 bp were
isolated (0.43 and 0.23 ratios). Samples were bisulfite con-
verted after size selection using EZ DNA Methylation-
Gold Kit (Zymo), following the manufacturer’s instructions.

(three per group) were sequenced on Illumina a HiSeq2000
(100 bp), with the remainder sequenced on a HiSeq2500
(125 bp) paired-end single indexed run and 10% PhiX spike-in.
WGBS alignment and methylation analysis
Sequencing reads were aligned using the BSmooth (Hansen
et al. 2012) bisulfite alignment pipeline (version 0.7.1) and
Bowtie 2 version 2.1.0 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012). Sam-
ples from B6 and A strains were aligned to their respective
genome builds, obtained from the Collaborative Cross page
at the University of Northern Carolina Systems Genetics web-
site (http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=Pseudo),
combined with the genome for l phage. BSmooth was used
to extract read-level measurements of methylation. To com-
pare CG methylation across strains, the MODtools package
(46), which functions similarly to the University of California,
Santa Cruz Genome Browser’s liftOver, was used to convert A
genomic coordinates to the B6 build. Following conversion to a
common coordinate system, we smoothed the methylation
data as previously described (Hansen et al. 2012).
Real-time PCR
Hepatic Avpr1a transcript abundance was analyzed in males
in both cohorts, and in males from the 2-week follow-up
study in which five A and B6 mice were fed ad libitum an
American or control mouse diet for 2 weeks at TAMU. RNA
was isolated from liver using a Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA
kit (Promega). cDNAwas generated using a Transcriptor First
Strand cDNA Sythesis Kit (Roche). Primers were targeted to
Avpr1a (59-CATGTAGATCCACGGGTTGC-39 and 59-ACACCT
TTCTTCATCGTCCAG-39) and Rplp0 (59-CGCTTGTACCCAT
THATHATH-39 and 59-TTATAACCCTGAAGTGCTCGAC-39)
(Integrated DNA Technologies). Analysis was performed on
a LightCycler 96 Thermocycler (Roche) using LightCycler
480 Sybr Green I Master reaction mix. All samples were
run in duplicate and prepared on an EpMotion 5075 auto-
mated liquid-handling system. Cycling conditions were 95�
for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95� for 30 sec, 55� for
15 sec, and 72� for 60 sec. A high-resolution melting curve
was produced by heating to 95� for 10 sec, cooling to 65� for
60 sec, and heating to 97� for 1 sec, followed by a cooling step
of 37� for 30 sec. DCQ expression values were determined by
normalizing to Rplp0 expression.
Isocaloric mouse experiments
Four-week-old C57BL/6J males were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory and acclimated for 2 weeks. Mice were
isocalorically fed a control mouse or American diet for 90 days
at TAMU. Ten males were used per group, as males had a more
pronounced difference in adiposity between the control and
American diets. Mice were housed five per cage and fed 11.5
kcal/mouse daily. Prior experiments optimized food quantity to
ensure all food was eaten. Mice were weighed and body com-
position analyzed (EchoMRI-130 Body Composition Analyzer).
Metabolomics
Flash-frozen liver samples from the NC cohort were pulver-
ized, and 0.025 g was added to 1.3 ml of prechilled methanol
and incubated at 280� for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged
for 5 min at 13.2 rpm at 4� and supernatant removed. Next,
200 ml of 80% methanol:20% water (solvent B) was added
and incubated for 15 min at 280�. The samples were centri-
fuged for 5 min at 13.2 rpm at 4�, and the supernatants added
to the same glass vial. Next, 200 ml of solvent B was added
and incubated for 15 min at 280�. Samples were centrifuged
for 5 min at 13.2 rpm at 4� and supernatants were added to
the glass vial. The contents of the glass vial were dried using a
nitrogen drying apparatus, then 160 ml of sterile water was
added; 60 ml of 13C-labeled Escherichia coli was also added to
the dried glass vial as an internal standard. Samples, kept at
4�, were placed in an autosampler tray. Next, 10ml from each
sample was injected through a Synergi 2.5 mm Hydro-RP
100, 100 3 2.00 mm LC column (Phenomex) at 25�. The
mass spectrometer was run in full-scan mode and negative-
ionization mode, adapting a previous protocol (Clasquin et al.
2012). Samples were analyzed with a resolution of 140,000.
A scan window of 85–800 m/z (mass-to-charge) was used
from 0 to 9 min, and a window of 110–1000 m/z from 9 to
25 min. Solvent A consisted of 97:3 water:methanol, 10 mM
tributylamine, and 15 mM acetic acid. Solvent B was metha-
nol. The gradient from 0 to 5 min was 0% Solvent B, from 5 to
13 min was 20% Solvent B, from 13 to 15.5 min was 55%
Solvent B, from 15.5 to 19 min was 95% Solvent B, and from
19 to 25 min was 0% Solvent B, with a flow rate of 200 ml/min.
Raw files generated by Xcalibur were converted to mzML via
msconvert (Chambers et al. 2012). MAVEN (Melamud et al.
2010; Clasquin et al. 2012) was used to correct total ion
chromatograms based on retention time for each sample.
Identified metabolites were manually chosen and peak abun-
dance was integrated by mass (6 5 ppm) and retention time.
Unidentified metabolites were chosen using an algorithm
with the following settings: minimum peak width, 5; mini-
mum signal/blank ratio, $ 3; minimum peak intensity,
10,000; and minimum peak/baseline, 3. Unidentified peaks
were filtered manually to remove those that did not meet
the above criteria.
Statistical analysis
Factors contributing to phenotypic variance: To determine
the relative contribution of each factor underlying phenotypic
variance, multi-factor ANOVA was performed for each phe-
notype with the factors strain, diet, strain-by-diet interaction,
sex, and cohort (where applicable). Log transformation was
402
W. T. Barrington et al.
 used for data that was not normally distributed (activity, ALT,
GTT, insulin, LDL cholesterol, and liver triglycerides).
Comparison of metabolic effects within strains across
diet: To compare the effects of the American diet relative to
the control diet, two-way or multi-factor ANOVA was performed
independently for each strain using the factors diet and sex, and
cohort where applicable. Cohen’s d effect sizes were calculated
using the mean response on American diet minus the mean re-
sponse on control mouse diet, divided by the pooled SD. The
same methods were used to compare the effects of the Mediter-
ranean, Japanese, and Maasai/ketogenic diets to the American
diet, with P-values calculated using the American diet as a con-
trol. Dunnett’s Test correction was performed, which corrects for
testing multiple comparisons to a control, given that we exam-
ined metabolic changes within a strain through diet modification.
A P-value of 0.05 was used for the significance threshold.
Methylation analysis: Methylation analysis was conducted in
R via the bsseq package. The Avpr1a result was obtained by
searching for differentially methylated regions genome-wide
with a t-statistic cutoff of 4.6 and only considering CpGs, which
had a coverage of $ 2 in all 31 samples. One sample from the B6
control mouse diet group was excluded from analysis because
we observed that its source liver tissue had an abnormal tumor
growth. This was confirmed by global hypomethylation, as pre-
viously described in human colon cancers (Reikvam et al. 2011).
Metabolomics analysis: Metabolites missing $ 70% sample
measurements were removed from analysis. Missing values in
the remaining metabolites were imputed using k-nearest num-
bers. Data were assessed for normality using Q-Q plots, residuals,
and the Shapiro–Wilks test after each step of the normalization
process. Tissue weight and internal standard were treated as
covariates. Tissue amount used in the extraction was weighed
for each sample. Metabolites measured from the 13C E. coli
internal standard were matched with their corresponding me-
tabolite; otherwise, metabolites measured were matched with
a 13C metabolite of the same class type. Class types were iden-
tified using the Human Metabolome Database (Wishart et al.
2013). Once metabolites were adjusted for tissue weight and
internal standard, each metabolite was pareto-scaled across all
mice using the package “MetabolAnalyze” (Nyamundanda
et al. 2010). Each mouse was median normalized across all
metabolites and metabolites transformed using cube root.
The model assessed in each strain was:
Metabolite ¼ diet þ sex:
Statistical analyses of metabolites were performed using R
version 3.1.0 and 3.2.2. The a for all statistical tests was de-
termined to be 0.05. P-values associated with metabolites were
adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction factor.
Calculation of health category scores and metabolic
health index score: Health category scores were calculated
by multiplying the effect size (Cohen’s d) of each alternative diet
compared to the American diet for each phenotype in each strain
by its confidence level, thereby weighting for both effect size and
significance. Phenotypes within each category were designated
as positive or negative (below) depending on their association
with beneficial or detrimental health effects, respectively, as
shown in the model below. To allow for comparison across
categories, the category scores were standardized between 21
and +1 across all strain-diet groups within each category.

Results
Design of human-comparable mouse diets
We formulated diets based on historical dietary patterns to
examine the metabolic effects of diets that span the spectrum
of human dietary patterns and are associated with negative
(American)orpositive(Mediterranean,Japanese,andMaasai/
ketogenic) epidemiological health outcomes in people.
Many studies have compared effects of a control mouse diet
(Figure 1a) to a high-fat or Western diet (Figure 1b). Many
different high-fat diets have been formulated, each of which
contains varying concentrations of fat and carbohydrate, and
from different sources than shown in the figure. It is common
to find one or two representative ingredients for each indi-
vidual nutrient (i.e., casein provides protein, corn starch pro-
vides carbohydrate, and soybean oil provides fat). To better
recapitulate the diversity of ingredients in human diets, we
designed diets that match not only macronutrient ratios (i.e.,
proportions of protein, carbohydrate, and fat on a kcal basis),
but also ingredients, including bioactive compounds (e.g., red
wine and green tea extracts) (Figure 1, d and f), lipid profiles,
and fiber content (Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, and Table S4
in File S1). The American diet is representative of contempo-
rary dietary patterns in the United States (Figure 1c) (National
Cancer Institute 2015). The Mediterranean and Japanese diets
are representative of traditional eating patterns during the early
1960s, when these populations had among the longest life ex-
pectancies and lowest rates of chronic disease (Gordon 1957;
Marmot et al. 1975; Trichopoulou and Vasilopoulou 2000;
Precision Dietetics
403
 Knoops et al. 2004) (Figure 1, d and f). The ketogenic diet is
analogous to that of the Maasai tribe, who do not develop heart
disease despite eating high levels of fat and cholesterol (Mann
et al. 1965) (Figure 1e). The ketogenic diet induces ketosis, a
physiological state in which the body shifts metabolism to utilize
ketones and preserve glucose.
Sources of phenotypic variation
Four human-comparable diets (American, Mediterranean, Jap-
anese, and ketogenic) and the control mouse diet were fed ad
libitum to 10 male and 10 female mice from four inbred strains
(A, B6, FVB, and NOD). These strains were chosen due to
their genetic and phenotypic diversity, with the aim of sur-
veying mice with varying behavioral and metabolic profiles
(Kirby et al. 2010). The B6 strain is most commonly used in
studies and is susceptible to diet-induced obesity on a high-
fat, high-sugar diet (West et al. 1992). FVB is more resistant
to diet-induced obesity and is highly active, whereas the A
strain is resistant to diet-induced obesity despite low levels of
activity (Black et al. 1998; Parks et al. 2013). NOD is meta-
bolically unique from the other strains in its predisposition to
develop diabetes (Leiter et al. 1987).

 Two equally-sized cohorts of mice began diets at 6 weeks
andwereagedondietsfor12weekstoallowthemanifestation
of physiological effects, before the analysis of metabolic traits
over an additional 12 weeks (Figure S1 in File S1). Pheno-
types were compared using ANOVA models with diet, strain,
the interaction of diet with strain, sex, and cohort as factors.
Genetic variation accounted for a considerable proportion of
the total phenotypic variation for most phenotypes (Table S5
in File S1). Sex also contributed significantly to many pheno-
types. For example, sex effects accounted for about half of the
variation in body weight and lean weight, 33–42% of the
variation in metabolic rate, and 22% of the variation in water
intake. Diet effects contributed to the total phenotypic vari-
ation of most traits, including 84% of the variation in RER,
and 20–36% of the variation in plasma triglycerides, choles-
terol, and metabolic rate. Cohort effects explained a relatively
minor proportion of the total phenotypic variance, although
some differences in body composition were observed (Table
S5 in File S1).
Importantly, the interaction of genetic background with diet
influencedmostmetabolictraits,andinsomecasesaccountedfor
more variation than genetic or dietary effects alone (Table S5
in File S1). For instance, the genetic interaction with diet
accounted for 13% of variation in food intake, whereas the ge-
netic and diet effects each accounted for 11%. Genetic-by-diet
interactions were important for water intake and metabolic rate,
accounting for 12–15% of the phenotypic variance. While blood
lipids were strongly influenced by diet, genetic-by-diet interac-
tion effects contributed considerably, accounting for 10–12% of
the variation in plasma triglycerides, and HDL, LDL, and total
cholesterol. The genetic interaction with diet, where significant,
complicates the interpretation of the main effects of genetics
and diet, as the effect of genotype can vary across each diet.
Together, the results indicate that both genetic and dietary fac-
tors contribute in varying degrees to most metabolic traits, and
that the genetic interaction with diet plays a key role in influ-
encing metabolic traits.
Influence of the American diet on activity, metabolic
rate, and food intake
To model the potential impact of a precision nutrition ap-
proach, we sought to use the American diet as a baseline for
comparison to other human diets. However, because the vast
majority of mouse studies in any field use a chow diet, we first
put the novel American diet into the perspective of the control
mouse diet (Comparison A), before comparing the American
diet to alternative human-relevant diets (Comparison B)
(Figure S1 in File S1).
We examined basic physiological and behavioral parameters
and quantified the changes in Cohen’s d effect size. Physical
activity was not affected by diet (Figure 2a). Nonetheless,
the American diet increased metabolic rate in the A strain,
indicated by increase oxygen consumption (d = 0.98) and
heat expenditure (d = 0.96) (Figure 2b and Figure S2a in File
S1). Food intake decreased in the NOD strain (d = 22.20),
but was not significantly altered in other strains (Figure 2c).
Water intake increased significantly in A mice (d = 1.47) and
NOD mice (d = 1.37) (Figure 2d). RER was reduced in B6
mice fed the American diet (d = 21.47), indicative of greater
fat oxidation (Figure S2b in File S1).
The American diet induces varying degrees of fat gain
across strains
We compared the body composition of mice fed the American
diet relative to those fed the control mouse diet at 12 weeks. The
American diet increased body fat to varying degrees across
strains, with the largest effect in B6 mice (d = 2.18) compared
to NOD (d = 1.57), FVB (d = 1.42), and A mice (d = 1.14)
(Figure 2e and Figure S2c in File S1). This result is consistent
with previous research feeding high-fat diets (West et al. 1992;
Cheverud et al. 1999; Parks et al. 2013). Elevated body weight
coincided with increased fat mass (Figure 2, f and k). Interest-
ingly, food intake was poorly correlated with fat gain (Figure 2, c
and e), but this observation is consistent with previous studies
(Backhed et al. 2004; Petro et al. 2004; Hatori et al. 2012; Parks
et al. 2013). To validate this finding, an independent cohort of
B6 mice was isocalorically fed an American or control mouse
diet for 14 weeks. Mice fed an American diet weighed 14%
more with no change in lean mass, but a 74% increase in body
fat (Figure S3 in File S1), emphasizing the importance of factors
other than food intake in the accumulation of body fat.
The American diet negatively impacts blood
lipid profiles
Across strains, mice fed the American diet had increased LDL
cholesterol with variation in effect size (d = 0.82–3.09) (Fig-
ure 2g). Concomitantly, HDL cholesterol increased in B6,
FVB, and NOD strains (d = 1.58–1.64) (Figure 2h). Total
cholesterol was increased across strains (d = 2.01–3.31)
(Figure S2e in File S1). Plasma triglyceride concentrations
decreased in FVB mice (d = 22.33), but did not change in
other strains (Figure S2f in File S1).
The impact of the American diet on glucose homeostasis
differs by strain
The American diet’s effect on glucose homeostasis was eval-
uated by GTT, and measurement of fasting glucose and in-
sulin. B6 mice, commonly susceptible to glucose intolerance
on high-fat, high-sugar diets (Surwit et al. 1988), showed
glucose intolerance when fed the American diet (d = 2.35),
as demonstrated by increased area under the curve measure-
ments (Figure 2i). Similar responses were observed in FVB
(d = 2.69). Consistent with previous research, diet had minimal
impact on glucose tolerance in the A strain (Surwit et al. 1988).
Glucose tolerance was not significantly altered in the NOD
strain; however, this may have been due to high interindivid-
ual variability in this strain, which is genetically predisposed
to diabetes (Hattori et al. 1986).
Fasting glucose was increased by the American diet in B6
(d = 2.15), FVB (d = 1.30), and A (d = 0.80) strains (Figure
S2g in File S1). We did not observe significant alterations to
insulin levels (Figure S2h in File S1). Previous research has
Precision Dietetics
405
 shown increased insulin levels in B6 mice fed a high-fat diet,
albeit with high variability, requiring larger numbers of mice
to detect a significant effect (Burcelin et al. 2002).
The American diet increases liver triglyceride concentrations
To determine how liver health is impacted by the American diet,
we performed histological examinations, and measured liver
triglycerides and serum ALT, a marker of liver damage. Liver
triglyceride concentrations were consistently elevated across
strains (d = 2.86–4.05) (Figure 2j). ALT concentrations did
not significantly differ from mice fed the control diet (Figure
S2i in File S1). Histological examination revealed increased
macro- and microvesicular steatosis in the A, B6, and FVB
strains, while only macrovesicular steatosis increased in NOD

 mice. NOD mice also exhibited increased hepatic inflammation
(Table S6 in File S1).
Arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (Avrp1a) methylation
status is associated with diet response in strains with
divergent health effects
A mechanism by which individuals respond to or are protected
from diet-associated changes in metabolic health phenotypes is
through modification of the epigenome (Stover 2011; Janke
et al. 2015; Barrett et al. 2016). To examine epigenetic mod-
ifications, we performed WGBS on livers from A and B6 mice
fed control or American diets. These strains were chosen due
to their divergent responses to the American diet, with B6
displaying greater increases in body weight, adiposity, and
impaired glucose metabolism, while A was comparatively re-
sistant to these phenotypic effects. Changes in methylation
patterns at Avpr1a showed a significant contrast between A
and B6 mice. B6 mice fed the American diet were hypermethy-
lated at Avpr1a compared to their control diet counterparts
(Figure 3a); in contrast, no significant difference was observed
in A mice on the two diets, and A strain methylation was
roughly equivalent to that of B6 mice fed the control diet
(Figure 3b). Given the observed methylation differences and
Avpr1a’s known association with metabolic disease in mice
and humans (Aoyagi et al. 2007; Enhorning et al. 2009), we
examined Avpr1a hepatic transcript abundance, which was
greatly reduced in B6 mice fed the American diet (284%)
compared to the other three strain-diet groups (Figure 3c).
In a follow-up study, we identified that repression of Avpr1a
transcription occurs rapidly, as Avpr1a transcript abundance
was reduced by 54% after 2 weeks in B6 mice fed the American
diet (Figure 3d). Genetic variation within this region cannot
account for methylation and expression differences, as Avpr1a
sequences do not vary between the strains (Blake et al. 2017).
Liver metabolite changes vary by strain
Varyingthecompositionofthedietcausescorrespondingmetabolic
shifts at the cellular level. Metabolite levels have been associated
with increased risk of metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes (C. F.
Huang et al. 2013; T. Huang et al. 2013; Menni et al. 2013; Wang
et al. 2013). Metabolomic profiling was used to determine the
extent to which genetic variation impacted the tissue-level meta-
bolic response to the American diet vs. the control diet. Profiling
was performed in liver because of its primary role in nutrient
allocation. Hepatic metabolomes of B6 mice were more affected
by the American diet than other strains based on the number of
metabolites that differed significantly in abundance between the
two diet groups. A total of 16 known metabolites were affected by
the American diet in B6 strain, compared to five (FVB), three
(NOD) and one (A) in the other strains (Figure 3, e–g). Com-
parable diet-dependent differences across strains were also
reflected in the numbers of unknown metabolites (i.e., spectral
features that did not map to known compounds in our data-
base) (Figure 3e). Diet-induced changes in metabolite levels
were strain-dependent, with 84% of metabolites significantly
altered by the American diet in only a single strain (Figure 3f).
A precision dietetics approach reveals strain-specific
effects of diet on physiology and body composition
Dietary modification is a common initial intervention for patients
with metabolic syndrome. While a number of studies have eval-
uatedhowobesigenicoratherogenicdietsimpactmice,studieson
human-comparable diets are lacking. To test a precision dietetics
approach by evaluating diet responses in the context of genetic
background, we compared how physiology and health status
differed in A, B6, FVB, and NOD mice fed Mediterranean, Japa-
nese, and ketogenic diets relative to those fed an American diet.
Physical activity was highly variable within strain-by-diet
groups and was not significantly altered by diet (Figure 4a).
Nonetheless, metabolic rate increased in all strains fed a keto-
genic diet and the magnitude of increase was genetic-dependent
(Figure 4b and Figure S4a in File S1). Food intake increased in
B6 (d = 1.97) and NOD (d = 2.03) mice fed a Japanese diet
(Figure 4c). All strains except FVB drank more water on the
ketogenic diet (d = 1.42–2.13). RER decreased across strains
fed the ketogenic diet and increased in all fed the Japanese diet
(Figure S4b in File S1).
Body composition and weight did not significantly differ for
anystrainfedtheMediterraneandietrelativetotheAmericandiet
(Figure 4, e and f). Japanese and ketogenic diets yielded similar
reductions in body fat in A and B6 mice (d = 20.93 to 21.17)
(Figure 5a and Figure S4c in File S1), whereas FVB mice fed the
Japanese diet had lower percent body fat (d = 20.94), but not
those fed a ketogenic diet (Figure 4e). A reduction in lean weight
was unique to A mice fed a ketogenic diet (d = 21.02) (Figure
S4d in File S1). Across all diets, caloric intake was poorly corre-
lated with body fat (Figure S5 in File S1).
To better understand the relationship between percent body
fat, metabolic rate, and activity, we plotted the residuals for each
phenotypeafteraccountingforsexdifferencesinasubsetofmice
housed in metabolic cages for 3 days (Figure 4g). Metabolic rate
and percent body fat varied by strain and diet, while activity
level did not strongly contribute to shifts in metabolic rate or
body fat. The A strain, which is considered to be resistant to the
effects of diet (Black et al. 1998; Parks et al. 2013), had the
greatest physiological shift of all strains on the ketogenic diet.
Their metabolic rate and percent body fat were similar when fed
American, Mediterranean or Japanese diets, but their metabolic
rate greatly increased and body fat decreased when fed the
ketogenic diet.
Variation persisted in some diet-by-strain groups even
while accounting for sex differences. This is most evident in
thepercentbodyfatofB6mice.Heterogeneityofdietresponse
has been previously observed in B6 mice (Burcelin et al. 2002;
Koza et al. 2006), and indicates that while genetic informa-
tion can improve prediction of diet responses, other factors
are also influential.
Effects of Mediterranean, Japanese, and ketogenic diets
on blood lipid profiles
The response of blood lipids to diet is one of the most
researched topics in biomedical sciences, with thousands of
Precision Dietetics
407
 studies having been performed with varying results
(Shekelle et al. 1981; Kris-Etherton et al. 1988; Mente
et al. 2009). Utilizing inbred strains of mice clearly dem-
onstrates that dietary effects are dependent on the under-
lying genetic architecture (West et al. 1992; Cheverud et al.
2004; Parks et al. 2013). In our study, the Mediterranean
diet markedly reduced LDL cholesterol for A (d = 23.29),
FVB (d = 22.56), and NOD mice (d = 22.97) (Figure 4h),
and also decreased HDL cholesterol in A (d = 23.48) and
B6 (d = 21.59) mice (Figure 4i). The Japanese diet de-
creased LDL cholesterol in NOD (d = 23.04), B6
(d = 22.21), and FVB (d = 21.69) strains (Figure 4h), and
decreased HDL cholesterol only in NOD mice (d = 21.54)
(Figure 4i). Plasma triglycerides were elevated in FVB (d =
2.20) and A (d = 1.87) mice fed the Japanese diet (Figure
S3f in File S1).
The impact of low-carbohydrate diets on blood lipids is
controversial. Studies have reported positive or negative
effectsdependingontheageoftheparticipants,obesitystatus,
and duration of the diet(Sharman et al. 2002; Kwiterovich et al.
2003; Dashti et al. 2006). Our study found beneficial impacts of
the ketogenic diet on cholesterol profiles, with decreased LDL
cholesterol across strains (d = 22.21 to 24.72) and increased
HDL cholesterol in NOD mice (d = 2.49) (Figure 4, h and i).

 Influence of Mediterranean, Japanese, and ketogenic
diets on glucose metabolism
Impaired glucose homeostasis is common in patients with met-
abolicsyndrome.GlucosetoleranceimprovedinB6(d =21.47)
and FVB (d = 21.43) strains fed the Japanese diet (Figure 4j).
In addition, fasted glucose concentration decreased in B6 mice
(d = 20.88) (Figure S4g in File S1). Fasted insulin concentra-
tions decreased in NOD (d = 21.30) mice but increased in FVB
mice fed the Mediterranean diet (d = 1.14) (Figure 5a and
Figure S4h in File S1). The ketogenic diet did not improve
glucose tolerance in any strain (Figure 4j), but fasted glucose
(d = 20.89) and insulin (d = 21.23) were reduced in B6 mice
(Figure 5a, Figure S4g, and Figure S4h in File S1). In contrast,
fasted glucose increased in NOD mice fed a ketogenic diet (d =
1.46), while fasted insulin was reduced (d = 21.39).
The effect of diet on liver health differs by strain
In addition to the effects of diet on the clinical plasma biomarkers
of disease, we now appreciate the effects of lipid deposition in the
liver on metabolic disease (Kotronen and Yki-Jarvinen 2008;
Cohen et al. 2011).
We found that genome-by-diet interactions influenced liver
phenotypes in mice fed the Mediterranean, Japanese, and ke-
togenic diets. The Mediterranean diet reduced liver triglyceride
concentrations in the A (d = 21.20) and FVB (d = 22.25)
strains (Figure 4k). The ketogenic diet reduced liver triglycer-
ides in A (d = 21.02) and B6 (d = 21.43) mice. The Japanese
diet lowered liver triglyceride concentrations across all strains
(d = 21.21 to 22.75). Histological examination of A mice fed a
ketogenic diet revealed that, while microvesicular steatosis was
reduced (d = 21.57, P = 0.0008), macrovesicular steatosis was
not (P = 0.97) (Table S7 in File S1). Importantly, serum ALT, a
marker of liver damage, increased in A mice fed a Japanese diet
(d = 1.31) (Figure S4i in File S1). While each diet benefitted
some strains, no single diet was universally beneficial for liver
health across strains (Figure 5a).
Diet alters the liver metabolome in a strain-specific manner
We compared the liver metabolomes of mice fed Mediterranean,
Japanese, and ketogenic diets relative to those fed an American
diet. The Mediterranean diet had little effect on the tissue metab-
olome across strains (Figure 5b), with glycerol-3-phosphate in
NOD mice being the only known metabolite that was altered
(d = 20.78) (Figure 5h). B6 mice were the most sensitive to
dietary changes on the Japanese and ketogenic diets (Figure 5,
b–d). Similar to the comparison between American and control
mouse diets (Figure 3f), diet-induced changes were highly strain-
dependent, with 79% of metabolite changes being unique to
one strain for the Mediterranean diet, 81% for the ketogenic
diet, and 94% for the Japanese diet (Figure 5, e–g).
Categorical health effects of Mediterranean, Japanese,
and ketogenic diets
To provide a more comprehensive view of health effects, we
analyzed four major categories of metabolic health (body
composition, lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and liver
health) by calculating health scores (HSs), by combining phe-
notypes within each category across all strain-diet groups and
standardizingtheeffectsonascalefrom21to+1,withnegative
numbers indicating worsened health and positive numbers in-
dicating improved health relative to mice fed the American diet.
TheMediterraneandietdidnotimprovebodycomposition,but
was beneficial for liver health in A (HS = 0.71) and FVB (HS =
0.82) mice (Figure 6). Despite high variability
, the FVB Mediter-
ranean group had an improved lipid profile (HS = 0.44). The
Mediterranean diet improved glucose metabolism in B6 mice
(HS = 0.27) but was detrimental for A mice (HS = 20.28).
The Japanese diet improved body composition across
strains (HS = 0.48–1.00). It did not consistently improve
lipid profiles, but did provide the greatest improvement in
glucose metabolism of all diets for B6 (HS = 1.00) and NOD
mice (HS = 0.86). It also maximally improved liver health in
the FVB (HS = 1.00) and NOD (HS = 1.00) strains, but had
detrimental effects in the A strain (HS = 20.36).
The ketogenic diet improved body composition for B6 (HS =
0.93) and A (HS = 0.42) mice but was detrimental for NOD
(HS = 20.28) and FVB (HS = 20.47) mice (Figure 7). It also
improved blood lipid profiles across strains (HS = 0.37–1.00).
Impacts on glucose metabolism varied, with a strong benefit in
B6 mice (HS = 0.62), a mild benefit in A mice (HS = 0.18), no
improvement in FVB mice, and a detrimental effect in NOD
mice (HS = 20.55). Effects on liver health also varied by
strain, with benefits in B6 (HS = 0.54) and A (HS = 0.48),
but no benefit in FVB or NOD mice (Figure 6e).
The healthiest alternative to the American diet depends
on genetic background
The mean of the four HSs (MHS) was quantified to provide a
measure of collective metabolic health (Figure 7, a and b).
Only the ketogenic diet improved health for the A strain
(MHS = 0.52); both the Japanese (MHS = 0.64) and keto-
genic (MHS = 0.61) diets improved health in the B6 strain;
and the Japanese diet improved health in FVB (MHS = 0.47)
and NOD mice (MHS = 0.65) (Figure 7, a and b).
There is an ongoing debate over the influence of adiposity
on metabolic health, with some suggesting that it is not the
accumulation of adipose tissue, but the dysfunction of adipose
tissuethatcausesnegativemetabolicconsequences(Goossens
and Blaak 2015). The argument is strengthened by the ob-
served lack of metabolic abnormalities in some obese individ-
uals (Bluher 2013). To determine the metabolic effects of
these diets without consideration of adiposity, we calculated
MHSs without the body composition parameter (Figure 7, c
and d). MHS rankings remained relatively consistent, with a
notable exception that the FVB Mediterranean diet group
showed a significant benefit (MHS = 0.36), similar to that
of the Japanese diet (MHS = 0.35) (Figure 7d).
Discussion
In an effort to increase the relevance of rodent findings to
people and provide a wider survey of responses to diets, we
Precision Dietetics
411
 constructed mouse diets based on dietary patterns of historic
populations that better recapitulate human dietary profiles
than previous studies. We showed that the American diet
caused negative health effects across strains relative to the
control diet. However, as in humans (O’Dea 1992; Schulz et al.
2006), the severity of the effects varied across genetic back-
grounds. Mice gained fat on the American diet, even though
caloric intake did not significantly increase, which is in agree-
ment with previous studies in mice and humans, and empha-
sizes the importance of factors other than caloric intake alone

Figure 6 Scores of four health categories for alternative diets relative to the American diet in each strain. Health scores indicate cumulative health
effects of alternative diets relative to the American diet for four categories: body composition (lean mass, fat mass, and percent body fat), lipid profile
(HDL, LDL, and plasma triglycerides), glucose metabolism (fasted glucose, fasted insulin, and GTT), and liver health (liver triglycerides, ALT). A positive
score represents improved health and a negative score represents diminished health. Scores and 95% C.I.s are shown for (a) A, (b) B6, (c) FVB, and (d)
NOD . (e) The data are also represented in a heat map for comparison, with red showing improved health scores relative to the American diet. A, A/J

W. T. Barrington et al.
 2011; Ford and Dietz 2013; Ladabaum et al. 2014). Meta-
bolic rate increased in A mice fed the American diet, which
may in part explain the strain’s resistance to weight gain,
although additional research is needed to demonstrate
causality.
This study revealed strain-specific, diet-induced epigenetic
modification of the vasopressin receptor Avpr1a. The pheno-
typic changes observed in B6 mice fed the American diet are
consistent with those of Avpr1a knockout mice (Aoyagi et al.
2007). Furthermore, people carrying a single-nucleotide poly-
morphism in the AVPR1A gene exhibit phenotypes consistent
with both Avpr1a knockout mice and B6 mice fed a Western
diet, including increased incidence of diabetes in those eating a
Western-style diet (Enhorning et al. 2009). These data suggest
that AVPR1A is influential in diet responsiveness.
After comparing the impact of the American diet to a
controlmousediet,weinvestigatedhowhealthstatusdiffered
in mice fed the American diet relative to those fed other
human-comparable diets and identified that genome-by-diet
interactions were influential for most metabolic phenotypes.
Overall, while each strain had a diet or diets that improved
health relative to the American diet, no single diet improved
health across all genetic backgrounds.
The FVB strain showed beneficial health effects when fed
the Mediterranean diet, even though body composition was
not improved. This is consistent with human studies that find
beneficial metabolic impacts of a Mediterranean diet in some
individuals, without reducing food intake or body weight
(Salas-Salvado et al. 2011; Estruch et al. 2013). The Japanese
diet yielded metabolic benefits in all strains except A, in
agreement with the epidemiological evidence showing gen-
erally positive health effects of a Japanese diet in people
(Gordon 1957; Marmot et al. 1975; Marmot and Syme
1976; Kagawa 1978).
The ketogenic diet increased metabolic rate, in agreement
withhuman research suggestive of a“metabolicadvantage” of
low-carbohydrate diets (Feinman and Fine 2003). Lipid profiles
of all strains improved on the ketogenic diet, consistent with the
healthy cardiovascular status of the Maasai population (Mann
et al. 1964, 1965). Effects of high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets
on glucose response in people are controversial, with studies
having conflicting results (Accurso et al. 2008; Delahanty et al.
2009). Extrapolating from mouse data, our results suggest that
genetic variation may underlie the heterogeneity of diet re-
sponse, as A and B6 mice fed the ketogenic diet experienced
benefits to glucose homeostasis, while FVB and NOD mice did
not. The ketogenic diet improved overall health in the A and B6
strains, but not the FVB or NOD strains.
Our findings have potential limitations. While great care
was taken to accurately recreate mouse versions of human
diets,therearedifferencesincludingalackoffreshingredients

Thedietshadabaselinevitaminandmineralcontent,whereas
some human diets may lack certain vitamins or minerals. In
addition, fiber was limited to one source of insoluble fiber
(cellulose) and one source of soluble fiber (inulin) to easily
manipulatethelevelsofthesefiberclasses,butacomplete diet
would contain several sources of each fiber class. While our
study was not designed to detect the interaction of diet with
sex, there is a growing appreciation that these interactions are
influential in metabolic health (Bolnick et al. 2014; Arnold
et al. 2017; Link et al. 2017; Reue 2017). There are differ-
ences in metabolism between humans and mice that could
affect outcomes across species, although previous research

provide a measure of overall meta-

relative to the American diet. A pos-

 has demonstrated the utility of mouse models in studying
metabolic effects in humans (Rohner-Jeanrenaud and Jean-
renaud 1996; von Scheidt et al. 2017). This study demon-
strates the utility of mouse models to dissect genetic-by-diet
interactions; however, studies on diet responsiveness in hu-
mans are needed to extend findings to people.
Evaluating diet response in the context of genetic back-
ground enabled a much clearer understanding of dietary
effects. Nonetheless, some variation persisted within diet-
by-strain groups. Additional factors yet to be identified must
play a role in diet response. One possibility is that the gut
microbiome impacted phenotypes in this study (Backhed et al.
2007). Individual-specific epigenetic differences may also
have played a role.
This study in mice demonstrates that the health effects of
several popular human dietary patterns are dependent on
genetic background, adding to a growing appreciation for
individual variation in dietary considerations (West et al.
1992; Parks et al. 2013; Konstantinidou et al. 2014; Zeevi
et al. 2015; Korem et al. 2017). Determining the extent to
which genetic factors influence diet response in humans is
difficult given complex genetic variability and environmental
confounders. Even so, the disparate health consequences of a
Western-style diet across genetically distinct human popula-
tions and the strong concordance of dietary response in
monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins suggest that genet-
ics plays an important role. If genetics impacts diet response
similarly in people as in mice, then the implementation of
personalized dietary recommendations will be important
for the mitigation of metabolic disease.
