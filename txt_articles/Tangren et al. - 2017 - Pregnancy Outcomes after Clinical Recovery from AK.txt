ABSTRACT
The effect of clinically recovered AKI (r-AKI) on future pregnancy outcomes is unknown. We retrospec-
tively studied all women who delivered infants between 1998 and 2007 at Massachusetts General Hospital
to assess whether a previous episode of r-AKI associated with subsequent adverse maternal and fetal
outcomes, including preeclampsia. AKI was defined as rise in serum creatinine concentration to 1.5-fold
above baseline. We compared pregnancy outcomes in women with r-AKI without history of CKD
(eGFR.90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 before conception; n=105) with outcomes in women without kidney disease
(controls; n=24,640). The r-AKI and control groups had similar prepregnancy serum creatinine measure-
ments (0.7060.20 versus 0.6960.10 mg/dl; P=0.36). However, women with r-AKI had increased rates of
preeclampsia compared with controls (23% versus 4%; P,0.001). Infants of women with r-AKI were born
earlier than infants of controls (37.663.6 versus 39.262.2 weeks; P,0.001), with increased rates of small
for gestational age births (15% versus 8%; P=0.03). After multivariate adjustment, r-AKI associated with
increased risk for preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.6 to
9.7) and adverse fetal outcomes (aOR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.7). When women with r-AKI and controls were
matched 1:2 by age, race, body mass index, diastolic BP, parity, and diabetes status, r-AKI remained
associated with preeclampsia (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.1 to 10.1) and adverse fetal outcomes (OR, 2.1; 95%
CI, 1.2 to 3.7). Thus, a past episode of AKI, despite return to normal renal function before pregnancy,
associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy.

AKI is a global health epidemic and associated with
the future development of hypertension and
CKD.1–4 Although AKI is most often studied in
elderly and critically ill populations, it is also a fre-
quent occurrence in hospitalized children and
young adults and associated with increased risk
of future morbidity.5,6
Although the risk of AKI on the development of
future CKD and death is well established, the con-
sequence of an episode of AKI on health outcomes
relevanttoyoungerpopulations,suchaspregnancy,
has not been addressed. Pregnancy in women with
advanced preexisting kidney disease is considered
high risk.7,8 Several recent studies have reported
adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with earlier
stages of CKD as well, including those with normal
GFR (CKD stage 1).9,10 These findings argue that
even subclinical degrees of renal dysfunction, de-
spite otherwise normal GFR, are important for
healthy pregnancies. It is not known if adverse

 pregnancy outcomes are a long-term consequence of recov-
ered AKI (r-AKI). Furthermore, rates of preeclampsia vary
greatly across the world, with higher rates reported in low-
income countries.11,12 In low-income countries, rates of AKI
are also higher among young women.13 It is possible that
variation in rates of preeclampsia may follow differences in
the incidence of AKI among young women.14
The primary objective of our study was to determine if a
history of recovered AKI (i.e., no subsequent CKD) increases
the risk of subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes. We hy-
pothesized that a previous episode of AKI would result in in-
creased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, despite
clinical recovery of renal function before pregnancy.
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
We performed a study of pregnancies in the Massachusetts
General Hospital obstetric service birth database between
September 1, 1998 and December 31, 2007. AKI was defined
as a rise in serum creatinine concentration to 1.5-fold increase
above baseline. Pregnancies in women with an episode of AKI
with subsequent recovery of renal function (eGFR.90) before
start of pregnancy (r-AKI; n=105) were compared with preg-
nancies in women without kidney disease (controls;
n=24,640). Women with CKD were excluded (n=110) (Figure
1). At the first prenatal visit, women with r-AKI were of similar
age, body mass index (BMI), parity, and gestational age at
presentation compared with women without preexisting
AKI (Table 1). The two groups were similar in marital status
and education level; however, women in the control group
were more likely to be of self–reported nonwhite race (34%
versus 45%; P=0.04). The groups also had similar rates of
preexisting hypertension and baseline systolic and diastolic
BP recording at initial prenatal visit. More women in the
r-AKI group had preexisting diabetes (12% versus 3%;
P,0.001). Serum creatinine data during the 6 months before
conception were available for 36% of the control cohort
(n=8971). Preconception creatinine concentrations were sim-
ilar between groups (0.7060.20 versus 0.6960.10 mg/dl;
P=0.36). The baseline characteristics did not differ signifi-
cantly in those controls with and without baseline creatinine
measurements, with the exception of a modest different in
education status (Supplemental Table 1).
Table 2 summarizes the etiologies of documented AKI
episodes. A majority of patients suffered hemodynamic injury
characterized primarily as acute tubular necrosis or prerenal
azotemia (40%) or drug–induced renal injury (12%). AKI de-
veloped as a complication of a prior pregnancy in 12% of
women in the cohort. This encompassed AKI from severe
hyperemesis gravidarum, preeclampsia/hemolysis, elevated
liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, and obstetric
hemorrhage. Postrenal etiologies accounted for 5% of AKI in
the cohort. In 31% of patients who met criteria for r-AKI, an
etiology could not be determined on the basis of review of the
medical record; however, elevation of serum creatinine meet-
ing the criteria for AKI was documented.
Maternal and Fetal Outcomes
Maternal and fetal outcomes in women with and without r-AKI
are shown in Table 3. Mean gestational ages at delivery inwomen
with and without r-AKI were 37.663.6 and 39.262.2 weeks,
respectively (P,0.001). Women with r-AKI were more likely
to have preterm deliveries and deliveries by cesarean section
compared with women without AKI (40% versus 27%;
P=0.02). Women with r-AKI had increased risks of preeclamp-
sia, preterm preeclampsia, and early preterm preeclampsia
(23%, 10%, and 7% versus 4%, 1%, and 0.4%; P,0.001). After
adjustment for maternal age, maternal BMI, race, parity, history
of diabetes, and diastolic BP at first prenatal visit, r-AKI re-
mainedsignificantlyassociated with adversematernaloutcomes.
r-AKI was associated with a fivefold increased odds of pre-
eclampsia compared with that in women without AKI (adjusted
odds ratio [OR], 5.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.6 to
9.7). This finding was also true for preterm and early preterm
preeclampsia (adjusted OR, 6.3;95% CI, 3.1 to 12.7and adjusted
OR, 10.0; 95% CI, 4.0 to 25.3, respectively).
Mean neonatal weights at birth from womenwith and with-
out r-AKI were 32106823 and 33766570 g, respectively
(P=0.05). Women with r-AKI were more likely to have small
for gestational age offspring (15% versus 8%; P=0.03) and
neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU; 26% versus 8%; P,0.001) compared with women
without AKI. Although there was low number of perinatal
deaths in the cohort (n=189), there were significantly more
deaths in the offspring of mothers with r-AKI (3.0% versus
0.8%; P=0.02). This association, however, became nonsignif-
icant in the multivariate logistic regression (adjusted OR, 3.2;
95% CI, 1.0 to 10.6). In offspring of mothers with r-AKI, 40%
developed the composite adverse fetal outcome (preterm de-
livery, NICU admission, small for gestational age, or perinatal
death) versus 19% in those without AKI (P,0.001). r-AKIwas
associated with increased odds of small for gestational age
offspring, NICU admission, and the composite fetal adverse
outcome (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.7; adjusted OR,
3.0; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.9; and adjusted OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to
3.7, respectively). Even after preeclampsia in the incident
pregnancy was included in the multivariate model for fetal
outcomes, all fetal outcomes except perinatal death remained
significantly associated with r-AKI.
Sensitivity Analyses
As an additionalmethod to control for potential confounders
of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we performed two sensitiv-
ity analyses: one restricting the analysis to women with a
baseline serum creatinine and a matched analysis. Women
from the initial control cohort who had a serum creatinine
drawn within 6 months of conception (n=8971) were used as
the control population. Women with r-AKI delivered at

 earlier gestational age (37.663.6 versus 39.262.1 weeks;
P,0.001) with higher rates of preeclampsia (23% versus
4%; P,0.001) compared with women from the initial con-
trol cohort who had a serum creatinine drawn within 6
months of conception (Table 4). Similarly, infants of women
with r-AKI were more likely to be small for gestational age
(15% versus 9%; P=0.02) and admitted to the NICU (26%
versus 8%; P,0.001). These results were similar to those
found in the main analysis.
In the matched analysis, women with r-AKI were matched
in a 1:2 fashion by age, race, BMI, parity, diabetes status, and
diastolic BP in the first trimester to those without AKI. Ma-
ternal and fetal outcomes in women with and without r-AKI in
the matched analysis are illustrated in Figure 2. Mean gesta-
tional ages at delivery in women with and without r-AKI were
37.663.6 and 39.062.4 weeks, respectively (P=0.001).
Women with r-AKIwere more likely to have preterm deliveries
and delivery by cesarean section compared with matched

 controls (22% versus 11%; P,0.01 and 40% versus 29%; P=0.05,
respectively). Women with r-AKI also had increased risk of pre-
eclampsia (23% versus 7%; P,0.001; OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.1 to
10.1). The results are similar to those in the unmatched analysis,
with the exception of baby weight and small for gestational age
offspring. Although women with r-AKI had smaller offspring
(32106823 versus 33006646 g; P=0.34), the fetal birth weights
and rates of small for gestational age offspring were not signifi-
cantly different between the two groups. In a conditional logistic
regression model, r-AKI remained significantly associated with
preeclampsia, delivery by cesarean section, preterm delivery,
NICU admission, and the composite fetal outcome (Figure 2).
Subgroup Analyses
Because 12% of the episodes of AKI occurred during a prior
pregnancy, we performed an analysis excluding these women
and found a similar associated between r-AKI and risk of ad-
verse maternal and fetal outcomes. Because we did not have
information on preeclampsia during previous pregnancies for
the entire cohort, we also performed an analysis in nulliparous
women to exclude the possibility that adverse outcomes were
related to prior preeclampsia and not prior AKI, and again, we
found a similar association between r-AKI, preeclampsia, and
adverse fetal outcomes. Additionally, we performed analyses
excluding all women with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension.
In all of these scenarios, a similar association between r-AKI
and adverse pregnancy outcomes was observed (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
Ourstudyshowsthataprevious episodeofAKI,despite clinical
recovery of renal function, is a risk factor for adverse maternal
and fetal outcomes in pregnancy. r-AKI was associated with
adverse outcomes independent of other significant comorbid
conditions, including diabetes, chronic hypertension, and ma-
ternal obesity. This finding remained significant despite
multiple methods to adjust for confounding, including a mul-
tivariate logistic regression, a matched analysis, and multiple
subgroupanalyses.Ourfindingsraisetheconcernthat,because
these women have normal GFR estimates before conception,
they may not be identified as high risk for adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Additionally, these results may help explain dispa-
rate rates of preeclampsia across the globe. Rates of preeclamp-
sia differ by region, ranging from 1% to 15%.12 Similarly, the
incidence of AKI differs across the world, and in low-income
countries, young women represent a large proportion of pa-
tients with AKI.15 Given our findings, it is possible that the
differing rates of preeclampsia may be linked to differing rates
of AKI, even if AKI results in otherwise clinically documented
recovery.
Normal pregnancy results in physiologic changes in the
renalcirculationcriticaltomaternalandfetalhealth.Inwomen
with normal renal function, pregnancy is marked by in in-
creased renal plasma flow. GFR increases throughout gesta-
tion.16 Given our understanding of the physiologic adaptation
that affects the kidney during pregnancy, it is reasonable to
question whether previous episodes of renal injury may result
in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Poor pregnancy outcomes in
women with advanced CKD have been reported for decades.17
It is intuitive that women with low GFR would do poorly in
pregnancy. However, a recent study by Piccoli et al.9 found
increased rates of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes even
in women with early stages of CKD and normal GFR. Al-
though this study did not specifically report rates of

 preeclampsia, the mothers with early-stage CKD had higher
rates of preterm birth, and their offspring were more likely to
be small for gestational age and admitted to the NICU, even
when maternal GFR was normal before pregnancy. Of note,
the gestational ages at delivery and small for gestational age
estimates in our study are similar to the estimates from the
work by Piccoli et al.9 in women with CKD stages 1 and 2.
Preeclampsia is also reported to occur more frequently in
pregnancy after nephrectomy for kidney donation.18 In con-
trast to women with r-AKI, however, kidney donors do not
have an increased risk of preterm delivery or low birth weight,
suggestive that placental function is less affected.
In light of pregnancy outcomes in kidney donors and
women with preexisting CKD, our findings suggest that any
previous renal damage, due to either acute or chronic injury, is
associated with subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes. The
interactionbetweendiseasedkidneysandthefetoplacentalunit
during gestation remains unknown. Experimental studies in
AKI have shown that aberrations in Vascular Endothelial
Growth Factor signaling and endothelial injury are important
in perpetuating renal damage that subsequently leads to
CKD.19 Similarly, preeclampsia continues to be understood
as a disorder of diseased endothelium and imbalance of pro-
and antiangiogenic factors.20–22 Conditions with preexisting
endothelial injury are associated with increased incidence of
both AKI and preeclampsia. In our study, women with pre-
vious AKI had a higher rate of preeclampsia despite adjust-
ment for preexisting diabetes and hypertension. Moreover,
this result was evident after limiting the analysis to those
with a first delivery and thus, no history of preeclampsia.

 Because our study shows only an association between AKI and
future adverse pregnancy outcomes, there may also be an un-
known confounder that predisposes women to both events.
We, therefore, hypothesize that the underlying metabolic mi-
lieu (or other shared risk factors) of these women confers risk
for both preeclampsia and AKI. Alternatively, subclinical
vascular endothelial injury often associated with AKI may sen-
sitize the vasculature to the toxic effects of circulating antian-
giogenic factors that rise before term in all pregnancies.
Experimental studies using animal models
may shed further insights into the relation-
ship between AKI and preeclampsia.
We noted that prior AKI was associated
with an increased rate of cesarean delivery.
This association was no longer significant
whenexcluding pregnanciesthatresultedin
preeclampsia, pregnancies that resulted in
small for gestational age neonates, and
pregnancies in women with preexisting hy-
pertension and diabetes.
Our study has several limitations merit-
ing discussion. We acknowledge that our
definition of AKI is not the most current
standard (a creatinine rise of 0.3 mg/dl
over 48 hours) as defined in the 2012 Kidney
Disease Improving Global Outcomes
(KDIGO) guidelines.23 Because all of our
data predate these revised guidelines, we
found that providers in our medical system
did not recognize 0.3 mg/dl as significant,
and thus, follow-up testing was often ab-
sent. As a result, we may have missed
patients with milder cases of AKI in the co-
hort. These women would have been in-
cluded in our control arm; however, if
they would have been included in the case
arm, our point estimates may have been at-
tenuated. Nevertheless, our analyses includ-
ing only those women with available serum
creatinine values within 6 months of start of
pregnancy yielded point estimates similar to
our overall analyses. Additionally, we used a
definition of preeclampsia that differed
from the definition set by the 2013 American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-
gists’ Task Force on Hypertension in
Pregnancy.24 The definition of preeclamp-
sia varies by country.25,26 We chose a con-
servative definition of preeclampsia that
was not subject to bias of diagnostic coding
by providers or laboratory testing by pro-
viders. Our definition was more specific
and likely underestimates the incidence
of preeclampsia reported. Additionally, we
also assessed hard outcomes, such as fetal
weight, which is a surrogate of placental dysfunction. Another
limitation is our use of dipstick proteinuria and not spot urine
protein-to-creatinine ratios. Quantitative assessments of pro-
teinuria were unavailable in a majority of women in the co-

and Gynecologists’ Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy
continues to include dipstick urine protein in their definition
of preeclampsia, we acknowledge superior diagnostic accuracy
of quantitative methods of proteinuria detection.

CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
 In conclusion, our data show that a previous episode of AKI
is a significant and independent risk factor for preeclampsia and
other adverse pregnancy outcomes. This represents a newly de-
fined group of high-risk women, especially in parts of the world
where AKI in young women is more common. It would be in-
teresting to address if AKI severity is associated with future pre-
eclampsia risk in future studies. There was a small number of
eventsineachAKIstage,andwedidnothavethepowertoaddress
this relationship in our study. Although the overall frequency of
AKIinourpopulationwaslow,theconsequencesweresignificant
tobothmothersandtheiroffspring.Healthcareprovidersshould
consider our findings when counseling women with previous
AKI about the risk of adverse outcomes in pregnancy. More
research isneeded toaddresstheclinicalimplications ofprevious
episodesofAKIonpregnancyoutcomesandidentifystrategiesto
modify future risk in these women. Additionally, our findings,
taken in the context of CKD in the pregnancy literature, should
prompt future research on the renal-placental-fetal axis.

 CONCISE METHODS
Subjects and Data Collection
The Massachusetts General Hospital obstetrics service provides both
community care and high–risk obstetrics care for women from Boston
andthe surroundingNewEngland area. We performed a cohort studyof
all pregnancies in the Massachusetts General Hospital obstetric service
birth database between September 1, 1998 and December 31, 2007.
Clinical information on all women who received prenatal care at Mas-
sachusetts General Hospital or one of its affiliated health care centers
wasreviewed in detail.This cohort encompassesa population of women
from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Clinical informa-
tion, such as medical histories, prenatal BP measurements, and delivery
information, was abstracted into the medical record prospectively and
directly transferred into the study database.
Forthisstudy,weincludedallsingletonpregnanciesthatlastedpast
20-weeks gestation in women who received prenatal care during the
study period. Both maternal and neonatal data were available, includ-
ing flow charts with BP and urine analysis measurements. All women
who were missing BP, urine dipstick, or weight (all part of standard
care) at the first prenatal visit were excluded. Women who presented
for initial prenatal care after 20-weeks gestation were also excluded
(Figure 1). Detailed past medical information, including previous
laboratory results, inpatient and outpatient medical documentation,
and prior billing data, were obtained for the 10 years before preg-
nancy through the Partners Longitudinal Medical Record and the
Partners Research Patient Data Registry.
Ascertainment of Exposures and Outcomes
We defined AKI on the basis of data obtained before pregnancy. Patients
were identified using the KDIGO laboratory definition of AKI as “an
increase in Serum Creatinine to 1.5 times baseline, which is known or
presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days.”23 Medical records
for all women included in the cohort were reviewed in detail to docu-
ment return to normal renal function (eGFR.90 ml/min by the
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) before
pregnancy.27Womenwhopresented withanelevated creatinine without
a baseline but subsequently improved to an eGFR.90 ml/min before
pregnancy were also included. Women who met criteria for AKI who
were diagnosed with CKD, including (1) sustained eGFR ,90 ml/min,
(2) persistent proteinuria (2+ or greater proteinuria on dipstick or
albumin-to-creatinineratio .30mg/mg), (3) identificationofstructural
kidney lesions (e.g., autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease), or
(4) chronic condition associated with kidney injury (e.g., lupus nephritis
or ANCA vasculitis), were excluded. Etiology of AKI was determined
through detailed chart review.
One hundred five women met the criteria for r-AKI. The first
pregnancy after AKIwas considered. The control population included
24,640 pregnancies in women without known preexisting kidney dis-
ease (both preexisting CKD and AKI with persistent low GFR).
Women with 2+ dipstick proteinuria or greater at initial prenatal visit
were excluded. Preconception creatinine reflects serum measure-
ments documented at a maximum of 6 months before conception.
To avoid measurement bias, we also included women with no history
of AKI who lacked a serum creatinine measurement within 6 months
of conception in the control group, because this represented a ma-
jority of the low-risk pregnancies in the cohort. A woman was con-
sidered to have preexisting hypertension if her BP before 20-weeks
gestation was $ 140/90 mmHg or there was an International Statis-
tical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 9th Re-
vision (ICD-9) code for hypertension before the start of pregnancy. A
woman was considered to have preexisting diabetes based on the
absence of a glucose loading test during pregnancy (glucose loading
tests are contraindicated in women with preexisting diabetes) along
with the presence of the ICD-9 code for diabetes before pregnancy.
We reviewed 10% of the charts of women who met these criteria, and
all met the definition of preexisting diabetes.
ThediagnosisofpreeclampsiawasonthebasisofBPandspoturine
protein measurements made at prenatal visits. In women who were
normotensive at their first prenatal visit (BP,140/90 mmHg) and
lacked a diagnosis of chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension
was defined as BP$140/90 mmHg after 20-weeks gestation.24 In
women who were hypertensive at their first prenatal visit (BP$140/
90 mmHg), gestational hypertension was defined by the presence of a
rise in systolic BP .30 mmHg or a rise in diastolic BP .15 mmHg
after 20-weeks gestation. Patients with preeclampsia were women
with gestational hypertension and .2+ proteinuria after 20-weeks
gestation or .1+ proteinuria after 20-weeks gestation with confir-
mation of the diagnosis in the electronic delivery record. Preterm
preeclampsia and early preterm preeclampsia were defined as pre-
eclampsia with delivery before 37- and 34-weeks gestation, respec-
tively. We acknowledge that our definition of preeclampsia deviates
from the 2013 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
definition.24 Because our data were collected before these revised
guidelines, we felt that this represented a reproducible, specific def-
inition of preeclampsia. Small for gestational age was defined as the
10th percentile for completed week of gestational age on the basis of
national standards.28 Perinatal death was defined as infant death that
occurred at ,7 days of age or fetal death with a stated or presumed
gestation of 20 weeks or more. The composite fetal outcome was
defined by preterm delivery (,37 weeks), NICU admission, small
for gestational age, or perinatal death.
We performed a matched sensitivity analysis. Using a pool of
24,640 women without preexisting kidney disease, we matched two
controls without replacement for each woman with r-AKI using age
(63 years), race, BMI (62 kg/m2), parity, history of diabetes, and
diastolic BP in the first trimester (63 mmHg).
Statistical Analyses
Characteristics of women with and without r-AKI were compared
using paired t tests and Fisher exact tests as appropriate. Univariate
and multivariate logistic regressions were used to compare the odds
of delivery by cesarean section, preeclampsia, premature delivery,
small for gestational age, NICU admission, and perinatal death. Mul-
tivariate logistic regression models included variables associated with
adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal age, maternal BMI,
maternal diastolic BP, maternal history of diabetes, race, and parity.
In the matched analysis, conditional logistic regression was used as
appropriate.StatisticalanalyseswereconductedusingSTATA14(StataCorp.,
