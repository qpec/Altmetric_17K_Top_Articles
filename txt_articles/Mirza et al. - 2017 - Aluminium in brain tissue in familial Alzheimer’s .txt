The  genetic
 predispositions
 which  describe
 a
 diagnosis
 of  familial
 Alzheimer’s
 disease  can
 be considered
as
 cornerstones
 of  the  amyloid
 cascade  hypothesis.
 Essentially
 they  place
 the  expression
 and  metabolism
of
 the  amyloid
 precursor  protein  as  the main  tenet  of  disease
 aetiology.
 However,
 we  do  not  know
 the
cause
 of  Alzheimer’s
 disease  and  environmental
 factors  may  yet  be shown
 to  contribute
 towards
 its
onset
 and  progression.
 One  such  environmental
 factor  is human
 exposure
 to  aluminium
 and
 aluminium
has
 been  shown
 to  be present
 in
 brain  tissue  in  sporadic
 Alzheimer’s
 disease.
 We  have  made
 the first
ever
 measurements
 of  aluminium
 in  brain  tissue  from  12  donors
 diagnosed
 with
 familial
 Alzheimer’s
disease.
 The  concentrations
 of aluminium
 were extremely
 high,
 for  example,
 there
 were  values  in excess
of
 10  �g/g tissue
 dry  wt. in
 5 of the 12 individuals.
 Overall,
 the  concentrations
 were  higher
 than
 all
previous
 measurements
 of  brain
 aluminium
 except  cases  of known
 aluminium-induced
 encephalopathy.
We
 have  supported
 our  quantitative
 analyses
 using  a  novel  method
 of  aluminium-selective
 fluorescence
microscopy
 to visualise
 aluminium
 in  all lobes  of  every  brain  investigated.
 The  unique  quantitative
 data
and
 the  stunning
 images
 of  aluminium
 in  familial
 Alzheimer’s
 disease
 brain  tissue
 raise  the  spectre
 of
aluminium’s
 role  in  this
 devastating
 disease.

 Introduction
Genetic
 mutations
 associated
 with
 both
 the
 expression
 [1]
 and
metabolism
 [2]
 of
 amyloid
 precursor
 protein
 (APP)
 are,
 in
 general,
the
 basis
 for
 a
 diagnosis
 of
 familial
 Alzheimer’s
 disease
 (fAD).
 They,
along
 with
 evidence
 from
 Down’s
 syndrome
 [3],
 provide
 strong
support
 for
 the
 amyloid
 cascade
 hypothesis
 [4,5]
 and
 a
 central
 role
for
 the
 neuropathology
 and
 biochemistry
 of
 amyloid-beta
 (A�)
 in
Alzheimer’s
 disease
 [6].
 In
 many
 ways,
 familial
 AD
 has
 been
 used
as
 a
 blueprint
 for
 understanding
 and
 treatment
 of
 sporadic
 or
 late-
onset
 AD.
Aluminium
 is
 present
 in
 human
 brain
 tissue
 [7]
 and
 in
 a
 recent
study
 involving
 60
 human
 brains
 the
 median
 aluminium
 content
of
 712
 tissues
 across
 all
 four
 main
 lobes
 was
 1.02
 �g/g
 dry
 wt.
 with
75%
 of
 all
 values
 being
 <2.01
 �g/g
 dry
 wt.
 tissue
 [8].
 The
 associa-
tion
 of
 aluminium
 and
 AD
 has
 a
 significant
 history
 [9,10]
 and
 yet
there
 remains
 no
 consensus
 as
 to
 a
 role
 for
 this
 known
 neurotoxin
in
 the
 disease
 [11].
 However,
 recent
 reports
 concerning
 sporadic
AD
 [12]
 and
 environmental
 [13]
 and
 occupational
 [14]

aluminium
 have
 allowed
 the
 conclusion
 to
 be
 drawn
 that,
 under
certain
 conditions,
 it
 is
 inevitable
 that
 aluminium
 will
 contribute
towards
 AD
 [11,15].
 The
 suggestion
 is
 made
 that
 wherever
 in
 the
brain
 the
 concentration
 of
 aluminium
 is
 pathologically-concerning
(>2.00
 �g/g
 dry
 wt.)
 that
 this
 aluminium
 will
 contribute
 towards
any
 ongoing
 AD
 and
 will
 result
 in
 the
 disease
 being
 earlier
 in
 onset
with
 a
 more
 aggressive
 aetiology
 [15].
Familial
 AD
 is
 characterised
 by
 an
 earlier
 age
 of
 onset
 and
 yet
there
 are
 no
 data
 to
 describe
 the
 aluminium
 content
 of
 brain
 tissue
in
 this
 ‘signature’
 form
 of
 AD.
 Herein
 we
 have
 obtained
 brain
 tissue
from
 12
 autopsy-confirmed
 cases
 of
 familial
 AD
 and
 we
 have
 car-
ried
 out
 the
 first
 ever
 measurements
 of
 brain
 aluminium
 content
in
 familial
 AD.
 We  have
 also
 supported
 our
 quantitative
 measure-
ments
 with
 imaging
 of
 brain
 aluminium
 by
 aluminium-selective
fluorescence
 microscopy.

Aluminium
 was
 found
 in
 all
 144
 tissues
 and
 its
 concentration
ranged
 from
 0.01
 to
 35.65
 �g/g

 ranged
 from
 0.34(0.26)
for
 individual

 tissues
 (57/144)
 had
 an

while
 approximately
 58%
 of
 these

tent
 considered
 as
 pathologically-significant
 (≥3.00

 Aluminium
 fluorescence
 in
 brain
 tissues
Tissue
 sections
 from
 6
 of
 the
 12
 familial
 AD
 cases
 (A1,
 A5,
 A7,
A8,
 A11
 &
 A12)
 were
 investigated
 and
 the
 presence
 of
 aluminium
was
 confirmed
 in
 each
 case
 using
 lumogallion
 and
 fluorescence
microscopy.
 Representative
 images
 of
 positive
 aluminium
 fluo-
rescence
 are
 shown
 in
 Figs.
 1–3.
 Multiple
 deposits
 of
 aluminium
were
 identified
 in
 each
 case
 and
 including
 in
 the
 brain
 of
 donor
A1
 which
 had
 the
 lowest
 mean
 aluminium
 content
 by
 TH
 GFAAS.
Aluminium
 was
 primarily
 identified
 in
 grey
 matter
 as
 clusters
 or
swathes
 of
 focal
 deposits
 some
 of
 which
 were
 densely
 stained
 and
1–5
 �m
 in
 size
 while
 others
 were
 diffuse
 and
 up
 to
 50
 �m
 in
 length
or
 diameter.
 Many
 of
 the
 former
 gave
 the
 impression
 of
 being
intracellular
 being
 associated
 with
 astrocytes
 or
 neurons
 or
 tissue
spaces
 vacated
 by
 dead
 or
 dying
 cells.
 The
 more
 diffuse
 deposits
appeared
 to
 be
 extracellular
 and
 were
 similar
 in
 appearance
 to
 dif-
fuse
 deposits
 of
 A�.
 Aggregates
 of
 lipofuscin
 were
 common
 in
 most
tissues
 and
 some
 deposits
 of
 aluminium
 shared
 the
 appearance
 of
accumulations
 of
 lipofuscin.

 Discussion
The
 aluminium
 content
 of
 brain
 tissue
 donated
 by
 individuals
with
 a
 diagnosis
 of
 familial
 and
 probable
 familial
 Alzheimer’s
 dis-
ease
 was,
 overall,
 extremely
 high.
 The
 mean
 aluminium
 data
 for
each
 lobe
 across
 all
 12
 donors
 are
 significantly
 higher
 (P
 <
 0.05
 in
each
 case)
 than
 equivalent
 data
 (using
 identical
 methods
 and
 qual-
ity
 assurance
 indices)
 for
 the
 same
 lobes
 from
 a
 previous
 study
which
 included
 60
 human
 brains
 of
 which
 ca
 60%
 had
 been
 diag-
nosed
 as
 sporadic
 Alzheimer’s
 disease
 [8,12].
 Herein
 we
 measured
some
 of
 the
 highest
 values
 recorded
 for
 individual
 samples
 of
human
 brain
 tissue,
 for
 example
 to
 highlight
 just
 a
 few,
 11.54
 �g/g
in
 the
 occipital
 lobe
 of
 donor
 A2,
 13.41
 �g/g
 in
 the
 frontal
 lobe
 of
A5,
 25.80
 �g/g
 in
 the
 occipital
 lobe
 of
 A6,
 35.65
 �g/g
 in
 the
 frontal
lobe
 of
 A8
 and
 23.93
 �g/g
 in
 the
 occipital
 lobe
 of
 A11
 (Table
 1).
These
 individual
 values
 are
 higher
 than
 previous
 measurements
for
 non-AD
 and
 sporadic
 or
 late-onset
 AD
 brain
 tissue
 [7,8,12].
While
 we
 have
 previously
 recorded
 values
 up
 to
 ca
 13.00
 �g/g
 in
AD
 with
 occupational
 exposure
 to
 aluminium
 [14]
 and
 one
 value
of
 23.00
 �g/g
 in
 congophilic
 amyloid
 angiopathy
 (CAA)
 with
 envi-
ronmental
 exposure
 to
 aluminium
 [13]
 the
 values
 measured
 herein
for
 familial
 AD
 are
 more
 similar
 to
 those
 which
 have
 been
 associ-
ated
 with
 aluminium-induced
 encephalopathies
 [17].
 It
 was
 of
 note
that
 while
 the
 aluminium
 content
 of
 brain
 tissue
 from
 donor
 A1
was
 consistently
 low
 across
 all
 4
 lobes
 (mean
 (SD)
 0.34(0.26)
 �g/g)
when
 additional
 tissues
 from
 this
 donor
 were
 investigated
 by
fluorescence
 microscopy
 significant
 deposits
 of
 aluminium
 were
identified
 across
 all
 4
 lobes.
 This
 observation
 tends
 to
 support
 the
previous
 contention
 of
 focal
 as
 opposed
 to
 homogeneous
 distribu-
tion
 of
 aluminium
 in
 human
 brain
 tissues
 [7,14].
The
 presence
 of
 aluminium
 in
 brain
 tissue
 from
 donors
 with
familial
 AD
 was
 fully
 supported
 qualitatively
 by
 aluminium-
specific
 fluorescence
 microscopy
 (Figs.
 1–3).
 We  have
 produced
striking
 and
 unequivocal
 images
 of
 aluminium
 in
 human
 brain
 tis-
sue
 and
 confirmed
 aluminium’s
 presence
 in
 each
 of
 the
 familial
 AD
brains
 investigated.
 Aluminium
 appeared
 to
 be
 both
 intracellular,
associated
 with
 dead
 and
 dying
 neurones
 and
 extracellular
 in
 large
diffuse
 deposits.
 Further
 detailed
 research
 will
 be
 required
 to
 con-
firm
 the
 precise
 locations
 of
 deposits
 of
 aluminium.
 Our
 images
 may
support
 previous
 studies
 using
 various
 semi-quantitative
 tech-
niques
 which
 suggested
 the
 co-localisation
 of
 aluminium
 with;
neurones
 and
 neurofibrillary
 tangles
 in
 AD
 [10]
 and
 dementia
pugilistica
 [18];
 Lewy
 bodies
 in
 Parkinson’s
 disease
 [19];
 lipofuscin
in
 AD
 [20]
 and
 senile
 plaques
 in
 AD
 [21].
 We  have
 previously
 iden-
tified
 the
 co-localisation
 of
 aluminium
 and
 amyloid
 in
 an
 AD
 brain
[7]
 and
 we  have
 additional
 evidence
 herein
 to
 support
 this
 (Fig.
 4).
Aluminium
 is
 shown
 in
 the
 very
 near
 vicinity
 of
 a
 plaque-like
 struc-
ture
 which
 stained
 positively
 with
 Congo
 red
 and
 gave
 apple-green
birefringence
 under
 polarised
 light.
 However,
 emission
 spectra
 for
Congo
 red
 and
 lumogallion
 show
 significant
 overlap
 and
 so
 addi-
tional
 research
 will
 be
 required
 to
 provide
 unequivocal
 evidence
by
 fluorescence
 microscopy
 for
 the
 association
 of
 aluminium
 with
amyloid
 in
 diseased
 human
 brain
 tissue.
These
 data,
 supported
 by
 visual
 evidence
 of
 aluminium
 in
 brain
tissue,
 raise
 the
 possibility
 that
 genetic
 predisposition
 to
 AD
 is
accompanied
 by
 a
 higher
 propensity
 to
 accumulate
 and
 retain
 alu-
minium
 in
 the
 brain.
 In
 familial
 AD
 the
 expression
 and
 metabolism
of
 APP
 is
 altered
 and
 there
 is
 substantial
 evidence
 of
 a
 role
 for
A�
 in
 disease
 aetiology
 [6].
 The
 observation
 that
 A�
 binds
 alu-
minium
 promoting
 its
 precipitation
 in
 a
 �-sheet
 conformation
[22,23]
 alongside
 the
 known
 co-localisation
 of
 aluminium
 and
 A�
in
 human
 brain
 tissue
 [7]
 might
 suggest
 a
 role
 for
 A�
 in
 the
 reten-
tion
 and
 accumulation
 of
 aluminium
 in
 brain
 tissue
 in
 familial
 AD.
5.
 Conclusions
Aluminium
 is
 neurotoxic
 [11,23]
 and
 the
 concentrations
 of
 alu-
minium
 found
 in
 these
 familial
 AD
 brains
 are
 unlikely
 to
 be
 benign
and
 indeed
 are
 highly
 likely
 to
 have
 contributed
 to
 both
 the
 onset
and
 the
 aggressive
 nature
 of
 any
 ongoing
 AD
 in
 these
 individu-
als.
 These
 data
 lend
 support
 to
 the
 recent
 conclusion
 that
 brain
aluminium
 will
 contribute
 towards
 all
 forms
 of
 AD
 under
 certain
conditions
 [15].
