Updated Priorities Among Effective Clinical Preventive 
Services
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s provisions for first-
dollar coverage of evidence-based preventive services have reduced an important 
barrier to receipt of preventive care. Safety-net providers, however, still serve a 
substantial uninsured population, and clinician and patient time remain limited in 
all primary care settings. As a consequence, decision makers continue to set pri-
orities to help focus their efforts. This report updates estimates of relative health 
impact and cost-effectiveness for evidence-based preventive services.
METHODS We assessed the potential impact of 28 evidence-based clinical pre-
ventive services in terms of their cost-effectiveness and clinically preventable 
burden, as measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved. Each service 
received 1 to 5 points on each of the 2 measures—cost-effectiveness and clini-
cally preventable burden—for a total score ranging from 2 to 10. New microsim-
ulation models were used to provide updated estimates of 12 of these services. 
Priorities for improving delivery rates were established by comparing the ranking 
with what is known of current delivery rates nationally.
RESULTS The 3 highest-ranking services, each with a total score of 10, are 
immunizing children, counseling to prevent tobacco initiation among youth, 
and tobacco-use screening and brief intervention to encourage cessation among 
adults. Greatest population health improvement could be obtained from increas-
ing utilization of clinical preventive services that address tobacco use, obesity-
related behaviors, and alcohol misuse, as well as colorectal cancer screening and 
influenza vaccinations.
CONCLUSIONS This study identifies high-priority preventive services and should 
help decision makers select which services to emphasize in quality-improvement 
initiatives.

INTRODUCTION
T
he landscape for prevention in primary care has changed dramati-
cally since the Committee on Clinical Preventive Service Priori-
ties published the first ranking of clinical preventive services in 
2001,1 and the National Commission on Prevention Priorities (NCPP) last 
updated the list in 2006.2 A growing evidence base has expanded knowl-
edge about effective preventive services. At the same time, the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the pursuit of the Triple 
Aim3 seek to expand access to and the efficiency of primary care.
Changes in primary care have potential to improve utilization of pre-
ventive services. Patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) have been 
associated with increased use of preventive services, though it is not clear 
whether health and financial outcomes are affected.4-6 Accountable Care 
Organizations (ACOs), when combined with PCMHs, may empower 
primary care and incentivize change,7 and ACO shared-savings contracts 
may encourage hospital systems and specialty providers to become vested 
stakeholders in evidence-based prevention. Preventive care quality mea-
sures and incentives in ACO contracts might assure that prevention is pri-

oritized while participants pursue strategies to reduce 
the cost of care.
Since the release of the 2001 clinical preventive 
services ranking, the National Committee for Quality 
Assurance more than doubled the Healthcare Effective-
ness Data and Information Set measures in primary and 
secondary prevention.8 In 2013, the committee adopted 
these quality measures for ACOs, which include 9 mea-
sures for primary prevention and screening.9 In 2014 and 
2015, it introduced measures to track unnecessary cervi-
cal cancer screening in adolescent females and unneces-
sary prostate cancer screening in older men, with the 
goal of reducing utilization and preventing harm.8,10
The ACA now mandates first-dollar coverage for 
evidence-based prevention in nongrandfathered plans,11 
including grade A and B recommendations of the US 
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Evidence 
of increased utilization of preventive services associ-
ated with implementation of the ACA is beginning 
to emerge, particularly among persons aged 19 to 25 
years as covered dependents in family insurance poli-
cies. Nearly 1 million additional women have received 
human papillomavirus vaccinations12 through expanded 
insurance coverage. From 2009 to 2011, hypertension 
screening, cholesterol screening, and annual dental 
visits increased among young adults, though influenza 
vaccinations did not.13 Early data hint at increased 
receipt of other preventive services for adults of all 
ages14,15 as ACA provisions for expanded insurance cov-
erage and no co-payments took effect.
Meanwhile, new knowledge is changing preven-
tive service recommendations, which may alter our 
understanding of which services may produce highest 
value relative to each other. In the past decade, the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices rec-
ommended hepatitis A and rotavirus immunizations 
for children, human papillomavirus and meningococcal 
immunizations for adolescents, influenza vaccinations 
for an expanded population to include all ages above 
6 months, herpes zoster vaccine to prevent shingles in 
older adults, and the additional vaccines of both the 
tetanus-diphtheria booster and pneumococcal vaccina-
tions for adults. In the same time frame, the USPSTF 
recommended new services or substantially expanded 
the recommended target population for 13 evidence-
based preventive services while retiring 3 recommen-
dations. The value of other recommended services may 
be affected by new technologies or new use of existing 
technologies, including human papillomavirus testing 
in conjunction with Papanicolaou screening, improve-
ments in testing for human immunodeficiency virus, 
and offering varenicline to help smokers to quit.
In creating an updated priority list of evidence-
based preventive services, we incorporated many of 
these new and revised recommended clinical preven-
tive services to assist clinicians and other decision 
makers in their efforts to plan quality improvement 
initiatives, develop performance measurements, build 
primary care medical homes, and incorporate preven-
tive services into ACO contracts.
METHODS
Methods were guided by the NCPP, a panel of health 
care clinicians, health insurance plan leaders, employers, 
government representatives, and academics. Health-
Partners Institute conducted the analytical work.
Included Preventive Services
The clinical preventive services considered for this 
update included services recommended by the USP-
STF for the general population that were given an A 
or B grade, Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices recommendations for the general population, 
and services recommended by the USPSTF for those 
at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) or 
sexually transmitted infections that were given an A 
or B grade. Services for the general population were 
defined as those for which the recommended popula-
tion is limited only by age or sex criteria. Services that 
are routinely co-occurring, such as childhood vac-
cines, were evaluated as 1 service. For a more complete 
description of included and excluded services, see the 
Supplemental Appendix, available at http://www.annfa-
mmed.org/content/15/1/14/suppl/DC1.
Measures and Estimation
Preventive services were evaluated using 2 measures: 
clinically preventable burden as a measure of the health 
impact of a preventive service, and cost-effectiveness 
as a measure of efficiency. Clinically preventable 
burden is defined here as the total quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) that could be gained if the clinical 
preventive service were delivered at recommended 
intervals to a US birth cohort of 4 million patients over 
the years of life for which a service was recommended. 
Cost-effectiveness is the net cost per QALY gained. 
Estimation methods have been previously reported.16 
Here we highlight new methods as well as methods 
that are key to interpreting results.
Using simulation models, the clinically preventable 
burden and cost-effectiveness were computed by com-
paring scenarios with no utilization of a service with a 
scenario in which the service was offered to 100% of 
the target population. The current burden of cervical 
cancer is low compared with what it would be without 
cervical cancer screening, as is the current burden of 
vaccine-preventable childhood infectious diseases. The

total health benefit as calculated by clinically prevent-
able burden in this manner reveals the overall impor-
tance of such services.
The clinically preventable burden and cost-
effectiveness estimates reflect scenarios with 100% of 
the target population offered each service, but not all 
accept or complete follow-up diagnostic testing, treat-
ment, medication use, or behavior change necessary to 
benefit from the service. Realistic estimates of adher-
ence were used to allow clinically preventable burden 
estimates to reflect differences in patient follow-through.
The literature for some services, such as mam-
mography screening, provides data on the effective-
ness of periodic utilization, and the literature for other 
services, such as tobacco cessation counseling, focuses 
on one-time use. Clinically preventable burden and 
cost-effectiveness are estimated with greater consistency 
across services through the use of modeling to estimate 
the cumulative benefit of multiple opportunities to uti-
lize the service throughout the recommended age range. 
Clinically preventable burden and cost-effectiveness 
estimates reflect the impact of each service throughout 
the lifetime, including the delayed impact after the age 
when the service is no longer routinely offered.
QALYs are not discounted to present value in 
calculating clinically preventable burden; costs and 
QALYs, however, were discounted by 3% per year in 
the cost-effectiveness ratio. Costs are either measured 
in or adjusted to 2012 US dollars.
In estimating cost-effectiveness, the principles of 
the reference case methods of the first Panel on Cost 
Effectiveness in Health and Medicine were followed 
to promote consistency with recognized best practices 
and consistency across services.17 In keeping with these 
methods, costs include quantitatively important medi-
cal costs for screening, counseling, pharmaceutical 
treatment, and follow-up diagnostic tests and treat-
ments for both true- and false-positive screening find-
ings. The value of a patient’s time required to travel 
to the appointment and receive both the preventive 
service and needed follow-up was calculated using 
average hourly earnings for the United States.18 For 
visits in which more than the preventive service would 
be addressed, a fraction of a 15-minute office visit and 
associated travel time were apportioned to the cost of 
the service. Potential savings included medical costs for 
avoided treatments or reduced costs for less-intensive, 
earlier-stage treatments. In keeping with the principles 
of the reference case methods,17 savings do not reflect 
potential productivity gains when using health utilities 
to calculate QALYs, because the health utilities may 
already reflect patient valuation of time lost.
New in this ranking is the use of HealthPartners 
Institute’s ModelHealth microsimulation models to 
provide more precise estimates for preventive services 
with complex time elements, such as cancer screenings, 
CVD screenings, and repeated counseling related to 
diet, physical activity, and tobacco use. The micro-
simulation models tracked 500,000 or more simulated 
individuals in annual cycles over their lifetimes, both 
in scenarios with zero utilization and offering the 
preventive service to 100% of the target population. 
Twelve services in the ranking were estimated using 
microsimulation. Five of these are exemplified in the 
two accompanying articles on tobacco counseling 
and reducing other CVD risks. Other services were 
estimated either with spreadsheet models (13 services) 
or using existing peer-reviewed literature (3 services). 
The spreadsheet models assess the impact on a birth 
cohort as a whole over discrete age groups rather than 
by simulating individuals and tracking their status and 
outcomes year-by-year, as done in the microsimulation 
models. Literature-based estimates require adjustments 
to reported results to improve consistency across ser-
vices in the ranking, such as inflation adjustment, add-
ing time costs for receipt of preventive services, and 
calculations to convert the impact of a cross-sectional 
analysis to a birth cohort. Spreadsheet-based esti-
mates often rely heavily on multiple published studies; 
therefore, spreadsheet and literature-based estimates 
represent a continuum of new calculations and use of 
modeled estimates from others. For example, our esti-
mate for childhood immunizations—a literature-based 
estimate—uses model estimates from 2 other studies of 
the events prevented19 and the cost-savings,20 but uses 
information from additional sources to estimate QALYs 
saved and the costs of the vaccination series. Summa-
ries of the methods for services are available online.21
Service Scoring
As with the prior ranking, the NCPP chose to group 
services with a similar clinically preventable burden or 
cost-effectiveness into 5 scoring categories for each 
measure to balance the goal of delineated services on 
value with the risk of overstating the precision of the 
estimates.22 Services were sorted in descending order 
of burden estimates and in ascending order of cost-
effectiveness ratios. The 28 included services are not 
divisible into 5 equally sized groups; therefore, for each 
metric we identified groups of 5 and 6 services that 
maximized the percentage difference between estimates 
of the lowest estimate in the higher scoring category 
and the highest estimate in the lower scoring category. 
Services in the highest group were assigned a score 
of 5, and services in the lowest group were assigned a 
score of 1. Scores for clinically preventable burden and 
cost-effectiveness were then added to give each service 
a score ranging from 10 (best) to 2 (lowest).

Sensitivity analysis was conducted for each esti-
mate and used to indicate which services had scores 
with greater uncertainty.
Marginal Effects
The marginal clinically preventable burden of increas-
ing utilization from current levels to 90% is provided 
as a supplemental result to help guide decision making 
to increase utilization. Patients receiving services may 
have risk profiles different from those who are not. 
Our estimates of marginal clinically preventable burden 
assume, however, that those currently not receiving 
services have the same baseline risk as those who are 
receiving services, because existing data are insufficient 
to quantify the association between known differences 
in population characteristics and disease risks.
RESULTS
The ranges of base case estimates for clinically prevent-
able burden and cost-effectiveness that define the scor-
ing ranges are displayed in Table 1. In Table 2 services 
are sorted by total score and alphabetically among 
services with the same total score. Six cost-saving ser-
vices were all assigned a cost-effectiveness score of 5. 
Of these services, the childhood immunization series, 
counseling to discourage tobacco initiation among 
youth, and counseling to encourage tobacco cessation 
among adults also received the highest clinically pre-
ventive burden score of 5 and, therefore, had the high-
est possible total score of 10. Two other cost-saving 
services—alcohol misuse screening with brief interven-
tion, and counseling on low-dose aspirin use—had clin-
ically preventable burden scores of 3, giving them total 
scores of 8. Two cancer screening services, to prevent 
cervical and colorectal cancer, also received scores of 8.
Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening, cholesterol 
screening, and hypertension screening received scores 
of 7. Obesity screening and healthy diet counseling for 
those at higher risk for CVD also scored well, with a 
total score of 6 despite the relatively high expense for 
these intensive interventions, which limited their cost-
effectiveness. Six other services received a score of 6, 
including 2 screening services for sexually transmitted 
infections, 2 immunizations, screening for the abdomi-
nal aortic aneurism in higher risk men, and vision 
screening for children.
In some cases, sensitivity analysis indicated that a 
service’s total score may differ by more than 1 point. 
This outcome might occur either because the base case 
estimates for both clinically preventable burden and 
cost-effectiveness are near the upper or lower boundary 
for their scoring category, or because the base-case esti-
mates are particularly uncertain as a result of plausible 
alternative values for multiple influential variables in the 
models. These services are indicated by a footnote in 
Table 2, and specific notes on uncertainty are provided 
in Supplemental Appendix, Table 1, available at http://
www.annfammed.org/content/15/1/14/suppl/DC1.
Estimates of the additional QALYs that could be 
saved if utilization for services with total scores of 5 or 
higher were increased to 90% are displayed in Table 3. 
Services with greater limitations in utilization data, as 
explained in the footnote to Table 3, are displayed at 
the bottom of the table and assigned a utilization rate of 
50%. For these services, 50% likely overstates current 
utilization; therefore, the resulting estimate of additional 
QALYs that would be gained from increasing utilization 
to 90% may be conservative. Across the list, preven-
tive services that address health behaviors—including 
alcohol misuse, diet, physical activity, and tobacco 
use—provide great opportunities to improve population 
health even while our estimates account for realistic lev-
els of nonadherence with the targeted behavior changes.
Traditionally underutilized services of colorec-
tal cancer screening(despite trends in increasing 
utilization), influenza vaccination, and co-delivered 
chlamydia and gonorrhea screening also provide sub-
stantial opportunities to improve population health. 
Finally, although hypertension screening and choles-
terol screening are not included in Table 3 because 
of high screening rates, increasing the use of antihy-
pertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs subsequent 
to screening remains an important opportunity to 
improve control and outcomes.
DISCUSSION
This updated ranking reflects changes in the evidence 
base and recommendations for clinical preventive ser-
vices at a time of changes in primary care. Since its 
inception—and years before Berwick et al described

tions that expend substantial energy and resources 
to incorporate the results of this ranking into quality 
improvement efforts. New to the top of the priority 
list is brief counseling to prevent tobacco initiation 
among youth. As with other services aimed at improv-
ing health behaviors, our model estimates indicate that 
the seemingly small success rate—measured by chang-
ing lifestyles of a small percentage of patients—has 
large long-term effects when the health behaviors have 
extensive health consequences. There remains substan-
tial opportunity for primary care to improve popula-
tion health through increasing the utilization of these 
evidence-based services.
In the 2006 ranking, increasing colorectal cancer 
screening rates stood out as an opportunity to improve 
health by increasing utilization. National screening 
rates for colorectal cancer have climbed markedly in 
the intervening years. Continued health gains are pos-
sible by further reducing the gap between colorectal 
cancer screening rates and screening rates for CVD 
risk factors and other cancers.

boundary more precise than 50%. Either utilization data are completely lacking or are available only for a population for which generalizability to US population is 
highly questionable, or the utilization measures available are poorly aligned with the preventive service as recommended by the USPSTF.

systems should review preventive service utilization 
rates of the populations they serve to identify oppor-
tunities to reduce delivery gaps at the local level. By 
comparing local utilization rates to the ranking in 
Table 2, while accounting for age and risk characteris-
tics of the populations they serve, local decision mak-
ers can identify their own opportunities for improving 
patients’ health. We also encourage decision makers 
to assess local disparities in utilization of high-priority 
services and tailor care processes to close gaps. Priori-
ties may also vary at the individual patient character-
istics,39 requiring clinician and patient judgment in 
defining individualized priorities.
Community-based organizations also have a role 
to play in closing gaps. For example, the Community 
Preventive Services Task Force in 2015 recommended 
implementing and maintaining school-based health 
centers in low-income communities. Several of those 
outcomes are relevant to the preventive services in 
this ranking, including increases in immunizations and 
reductions in tobacco smoking and alcohol use.40 An 
integrated program that strategically combines the 
efforts of clinics and community-based organizations 
may efficiently produce greater impact.
It is important not to oversimplify the complex 
factors that contribute to changes in the rankings. For 
example, estimates of greater-than-expected impact 
from the food fortification program introduced in 
199841,42 reduced the potential impact of folic acid 
supplements, resulting in a drop in total score from 5 
in 2006 to 3 in 2016. Another example is pneumococ-
cal vaccine. Introduction of the 13-valent pneumo-
coccal conjugate (PCV13) vaccine in the childhood 
immunization series had a substantial impact on dis-
ease incidence in older adults, reducing the impact of 
the adult pneumococcal vaccine. Addition of the more 
costly PCV13 vaccine43 for adults in 2014 also reduced 
the overall cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccina-
tions for older adults.
The accuracy of our results is limited by factors 
common to modeling studies. Models cannot gener-
ate estimates that are more accurate than the data for 
influential variables that enter the model. Further, by 
definition, models simplify the complex chain of causa-
tion and associations present in the real world. Con-
sequently, different decisions about building a model 
structure that fits the available data while representing 
key dependencies could yield different results.
Other limitations of the methods previously 
noted2,16,22 are worth mention. The ranking adds scores 
for 2 ordinal measures, clinically preventable burden 
and cost-effectiveness, and weights them equally to 
derive a total score. This method may not produce an 
ordering of total scores that matches the criteria impor-
tant to a decision maker. We provide the separate scores 
for clinically preventable burden and cost-effectiveness, 
which can be weighted to derive an alternate order of 
services. These 2 measures were chosen as comprehen-
sive metrics that indicate 2 important aspects of health 
services: health impact and efficiency. Other factors 
not reflected in these metrics—such as the impact on 
reducing health disparities, costs of systems to increase 
utilization, reimbursement, and publicly reported per-
formance measurement—should be considered along-
side these rankings in setting priorities.
We followed the reference case methods of the 
first Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medi-
cine.17 Updated recommendations from the second 
panel were released after all analyses were complete. 
The new recommendations suggest that productiv-
ity gains should be included in cost-effectiveness 
analysis conducted from the societal perspective and 
that a second reference case from the health system 
perspective be presented.44 Following the first panel’s 
methods, we included patient time costs in receiv-
ing services. Doing so particularly affects the cost-
effectiveness of services that include intensive weight 
management as a key part of follow-up. Relative to 
other services in the ranking, those preventive services 
likely would score higher on cost-effectiveness that is 
conducted from the health systems perspective. Add-
ing productivity gains to all services in analysis from 
the societal perspective may not substantially change 
the services’ relative rankings, but we could not fully 
assess adding the gains for this update.
Our analysis includes only a fraction of services 
among which priorities for clinic time and resources 
must be made. It is useful to consider these rankings in 
a broader context. Relative differences exist in the ben-
efits that can be achieved through more consistent use 
of these services; all of these services, however, have 
proven value in prevention and should be prioritized 
over services with less or no evidence. A much larger 
portion of primary care time is spent on diagnosis and 
treatment. We are not aware of any effort to begin 
the enormous task of discerning priorities among the 
whole range of medical care services. Evidence-based 
preventive services for higher-risk groups may be very 
important for those groups and are not included in our 
ranking. Effective community preventive services also 
are not included. As hospitals look for options to meet 
community health benefits and to help manage popula-
tion health as part of accountable care organizations, 
they can look to resources, such as the Guide to Com-
munity Preventive Services,45 County Health Rank-
ings and Road Maps,46 and the Community Health 
Advisor,47 for guidance on evidence-based community 
preventive services.

This update does not include 4 services, listed in 
the Supplemental Appendix that meet our conceptual 
scope. An effort of this magnitude requires ongoing 
work to keep pace with important changes to the evi-
dence base, underlying data, and new recommenda-
tions. We intend to develop a process of continuous 
updates, with incremental updates made available in a 
timely manner.
Recognizing these limitations, decision makers 
can use this ranking tool as they continue efforts to 
improve quality of care in a changing primary care 
environment. First-dollar coverage for preventive ser-
vices and expanded insurance coverage through the 
ACA, the pursuit of the Triple Aim, and creation of 
PCMHs may each contribute to increased utilization 
of clinical preventive services. No single initiative, 
however, has been shown to dramatically increase utili-
zation rates by itself. This timely update can be used to 
guide decisions to make the most of the opportunities 
presented by changes in how primary care is provided.
