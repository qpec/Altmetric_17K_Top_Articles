Nearly 80% of cancer patients do not have genetic mutation results available at initial oncology
consultation; up to 25% of patients begin treatment before receiving their results. These factors hinder the
ability to pursue optimal treatment strategies. This study validates a blood-based genome-testing service
that provides accurate results within 72 hours. We focused on targetable variants in advanced none
small cell lung carcinomadepidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) variant L858R, exon 19
deletion (DE746�A750), and T790M; GTPase Kirsten ras gene (KRAS) variants G12C/D/V; and echi-
noderm microtubule associated protein like and 4 anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase fusion
(EML4-ALK) transcripts 1/2/3. Test development included method and clinical validation using samples
from donors with (n Z 219) or without (n Z 30) cancer. Clinical sensitivity and specificity for each
variant ranged from 78.6% to 100% and 94.2% to 100%, respectively. We also report on 1643 nonesmall
cell lung carcinoma samples processed in our CLIA-certified laboratory. Mutation results were available
within 72 hours for 94% of the tests evaluated. We detected 10.5% mutations for EGFR sensitizing
(n Z 2801 samples tested), 13.8% mutations for EGFR resistance (n Z 1055), 13.2% mutations in KRAS
(n Z 3477), and 2% mutations for EML4-ALK fusion (n Z 304). This rapid, highly sensitive, and actionable
blood-based assay service expands testing options and supports faster treatment decisions. (J Mol Diagn

Somatic
variants,
including
rearrangements,
point
mutations, and indels, are critical genetic alterations that
influence malignant transformation and ultimately may
result in disease progression. The clinical significance and
importance of aberrations in epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), Kirsten
ras (KRas), and anaplastic
lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) have been
previously reported.1e5 The identification of the driver
genomic alterations (oncogenic drivers) and targeting those
specific alterations with therapy are critical aspects of
today’s approach to the management of cancer.6,7
The standard approach to the identification of actionable
variants in patients with nonesmall cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) is analysis of a tissue biopsy sample. The US
Food and Drug Administration has approved formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embeddedebased tests for the detection of EGFR
mutations [the Cobas (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and
Therascreen (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) kits], KRAS mutations
(Therascreen), and ALK rearrangements (Vysis ALK Break
Apart FISH Probe Kit; Abbott Diagnostics, Lake Forest,
IL), and for ALK immunohistochemistry testing (clone
D5F3; Ventana/Roche, Tucson, AZ). However, there are

 limitations of tissue-based mutation testing. For instance,
approximately one fourth of patients with NSCLC are either
not candidates for biopsy or have insufficient tissue samples
recovered from the initial biopsy.8,9 This can limit the
treating physicians’ ability to fully diagnose the cancer
genotype. Additionally, tissue biopsies may be accompanied
by discomfort in the patient and inherent clinical risks,
including bleeding in the lungs, infection, and pneumo-
thorax. A tissue biopsy sample may also not be represen-
tative of the total load and spectrum of mutated cells,
especially in patients with advanced disease stages and
metastases. Genetic changes can occur in the interval
between removal of the initial biopsy sample and the start of
the specific targeted treatment, especially in patients who are
first treated with conventional chemotherapy or radio-
therapy; however, surgical complications and economic
considerations make multiple or serial tissue biopsies
impractical in most cases.1,10 Importantly as well, results
from tissue-based testing can take weeks to obtain and can
delay time to treatment.7,11
Prior studies have demonstrated that circulating nucleic
acids of cellular origin from normal and cancer cells can be
isolated from blood.11e14 Importantly, genomic information
from a patient’s tumor can be obtained within days of a
blood draw. Thus, tracking tumor-associated genetic aber-
rations in the blood can be used for quickly and non-
invasively determining whether targeted therapies are a
treatment option; assessing the presence of residual disease,
recurrence, or relapse; and detecting the emergence of
therapy-resistant cancer cells more quickly than conven-
tional tissue-based methods.14e16
The EGFR gene (EGFR) is mutated in an estimated 10%
to 40% of patients with NSCLC.17 Approximately 90% of
these EGFR mutations occur in either exon 19 from E746-
A750 or as an amino acid substitution in exon 21 at
codon 858 (L858R),18 both of which confer sensitivity to
the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib, and
afatinib. The EGFR T790M mutation is the most commonly
recognized mechanism of drug resistance to these first-line
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, accounting for nearly
50% of the acquired resistance.19,20 T790M, initially
considered as relevant only as a resistance marker, is also
now actionable with the regulatory approvals of osimertinib
for use in EGFR T790M mutationepositive NSCLC cases.
The ALK gene (ALK) encodes a kinase that promotes
cellular proliferation; genomic rearrangements in ALK can
drive aberrant proliferation and tumorigenesis in a number
of cancers. The most prevalent rearrangement involving the
ALK locus in NSCLC is a chromosome-2 inversion that
leads to juxtaposition of the associated echinoderm micro-
tubule associated protein like 4 gene (EML4), resulting in
the EML4-ALK transcript variant 1 (E13:A20), variant 2
(E20:A20), and variant 3 (E6:A20).21,22 Patients with ALK
rearrangements have generally mutually exclusive muta-
tions in EGFR and KRAS and do not respond to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors.23 In this event though, there
are targeted therapies for ALK-positive tumors, including
crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib.
KRAS variants account for approximately 15% to 25% of
the driver mutations found in patients with NSCLC.17,24 The
KRAS G12C, G12V, and G12D mutations, for which we
developed assays in this study, are the most prevalent
and together account for approximately 76% of all KRAS
mutations.24 Importantly, KRAS encodes a GTPase protein
that functions downstream of EGFR; thus, tumors that
contain KRAS driver mutations are nonresponsive to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors.6,25 Additionally, the detection of
a KRAS mutation in a liquid biopsy sample can serve as an
indicator that the quantity and quality of collected tumor
circulating cell-free (cf) DNA are sufficient for identifying a
cancer-specific driver mutation. Since oncogenic drivers are
typically mutually exclusive,26 the detection of a KRAS
mutation can increase confidence that another mutation has
not been missed. For these reasons, KRAS mutation testing
is commonly performed even in the absence of a currently
approved targeted agent directed at specific KRAS variants
in NSCLC.
We used Droplet Digital (dd) PCR (Bio-Rad, Pleasanton,
CA), which was optimized for rare mutation detection from
blood. ddPCR is a highly sensitive gene-mutation detection
method that is based on the partitioning of DNA into
droplets.27 There are now several ddPCR assays that have
been developed for various common and rare cancer
mutations; these assays have demonstrated utility in the
clinical setting.11,14,28,29 Our assays were developed using
several specimen
types and included
synthetic DNA
oligonucleotides, cell line (tumor)-derived RNA and DNA,
cell line materials spiked into normal plasma, as well as
circulating nucleic acids isolated from whole-blood samples
from donors with or without cancer. In the EGFR and KRAS
rare mutationedetection tests, we measured the presence of
DNA somatic variants and the relevant wild-type (WT)
sequences in dual-detection assays. In the case of the EML4-
ALK gene expression test, cDNA copied from the plasma
circulating RNA was measured. Here, the fusion transcript
assays and reference glucuronidase-ß (control) gene (GUSB)
assay were multiplexed to perform EML4-ALK testing.
We report on the results from technical feasibility and
verification and validation studies using the aforementioned
reference and donor specimens. A schematic outline of these
studies is shown in Supplemental Figure S1. We further
detail analyses of >1600 clinical cases tested using these
assays after the assays were made available through our
CLIA-certified laboratory.
We have developed a highly sensitive and robust blood-
based assay to identify EGFR-sensitizing mutations (L858R
and
DE746�A750),
the
EGFR-resistance
mutation
(T790M), KRAS G12C/D/V in circulating DNA, and EML4-
ALK variants 1/2/3 in circulating RNA. Our results indicate
that, in clinical practice, circulating nucleic acids can be
used as a rapid and reliable indicator of positive mutation
status of a tumor in the absence of tissue.

Rapid Variant Detection in Whole Blood
 Materials and Methods
Donor Specimens
All human-donor samples in these studies were procured
under collaborative agreements with partners, prospectively
under the healthy-donor program at our laboratory, or as
remnant specimens purchased under commercial use licen-
ses. All donor specimens were consented for research use
and no donor-specific identifying information was collected
or used in the course of this study. Sample sets sizes used
for clinical validation studies are shown in Table 1.
Analytical Controls
Synthetic Controls
Synthetic gene fragments were synthesized as gBlocks
by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The
sequences for EGFR and KRAS were designed so that each
single nucleotide variant was represented by a unique gBlock
along with a wild type of the same length and position
(Table 2). Lyophilized gBlocks were suspended in Tris-
EDTA buffer to a stock concentration of 10 ng/mL and were
further diluted to working concentrations as needed. Syn-
thetic DNA oligos were used for qualifying the instrument
(Supplemental Figure S2) and for assessing initial analytical
sensitivity and specificity (Supplemental Table S1), at con-
centrations between 1 attogram and 1 femtogram per well as
input into the respective ddPCR reactions.

(E13:A20,

the
ddPCR
reaction
(Supplemental
Figure
S3
and
Supplemental Table S1). Of note, the EML4-ALK multi-
plexed assay detects variant 2 at a lower amplitude than
those of variants 1 and 3 (Supplemental Figure S3). EML4-
ALK and GUSB analytical control RNA molecules were
generated using in vitro transcription of the gBlocks, with a
T7 promoter sequence. The in vitro transcription reaction
was performed using the TranscriptAid T7 High Yield
Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Kalamazoo,
MI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Synthe-
sized RNA was treated with DNase I and analyzed for
appropriate size using a 2% agarose gel. Synthesized RNAs
were quantified by Qubit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
and mixed at equal molar concentrations to generate the
final multiplexed analytical control. The multiplexed RNA
control was used at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2.5
femtograms as input into the reverse-transcription reaction.
Cell Line Controls
Positive cell line controls were purchased from Horizon
Discovery (Cambridge, UK) as genomic DNA or cell pellets
(for mRNA isolation) derived from engineered and geneti-
cally defined human cell lines. The genomic DNA custom
mixture contained EGFR and KRAS mutations. Extracted
DNA was added at 2.5 ng per well into the ddPCR reactions.
The EML4-ALK variant 1 rearrangementepositive cells
were previously characterized by Horizon Discovery to be
biologically relevant control material used to assess the
performance of PCR-based assays aimed at detecting the
EML4-ALK fusion transcript. Frozen cell pellets were pro-
cessed using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) to isolate
total RNA.
Recovery of cfDNA from Plasma
Retrospectively and prospectively collected samples were
evaluated.
Whole-blood
samples
were
prospectively
collected into either Cell-Free DNA BCT blood-collection
tubes (Streck, La Vista, NE) or BD Vacutainer K2 EDTA
tubes (lavender top) (Becton, Dickinson and Company,
Franklin Lakes, NJ). Samples collected into BD Vacutainer
tubes were immediately processed by the collection sites to
plasma and were frozen before being sent to Biodesix, Inc.
(Boulder, CO). The methods for processing whole blood to
plasma on-site were per the manufacturer’s instructions
(room temperature at a speed of 1000 to 1300 relative
centrifugal force for 10 minutes in a swinging-bucket
centrifuge and 15 minutes in a fixed-angle centrifuge).
Frozen plasma specimens were received and centrifuged at
high speed (16,000 � g for 10 minutes at 4�C). For those
cases in which whole blood was collected into the Cell-Free
DNA BCT tubes, samples were shipped overnight to the
Biodesix CLIA-certified laboratory and processed to plasma
first by centrifugation at low speed (1900 � g for 10
minutes at 4�C), followed by the same high-speed spin.
cfDNA was isolated using the QIAamp Circulating
Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. DNA was quantitated by the Qubit dsDNA HS
(High-Sensitivity) Assay Kit (Life Technologies/Thermo
Fisher). When available, cfDNA was used at 2.5 ng per
reaction in the ddPCR workflow.
Recovery of Circulating RNA from Plasma
Retrospectively procured samples were purchased as frozen
plasma (Indivumed GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Prospec-
tively procured whole-blood samples were collected into
Cell-Free RNA BCT tubes (Streck). All samples were

 processed to plasma by centrifugation at 900 � g for 10
minutes at 4�C. The plasma supernatant was then aspirated
without disturbance of the buffy coat layer. Approximately
4 to 5 mL of plasma was obtained from one 10-mL whole
bloodecollection tube. Circulating RNA was isolated using
the Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purifi-
cation Kit, slurry format (Norgen Biotek, Thorold, ON,
Canada) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Sam-
ples were eluted into 100 mL of prewarmed nuclease-free
water and subsequently concentrated using the RNA
Clean-Up and Concentration Kit (Norgen Biotek). RNA
levels were generally undetectable using the Qubit mea-
surement method.
Circulating RNA was reverse-transcribed using Super-
Script IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was isolated from
remaining reverse transcriptase primers and reaction mix by
elution through the DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 column
with a lower limit of capture of 50 bp. cDNA eluted from
this column was then used for ddPCR. A noereverse tran-
scriptase control was run with every batch of samples and
was processed identically but without reverse transcriptase.

Rapid Variant Detection in Whole Blood
 Droplet Digital PCR
ddPCR PrimePCR (Bio-Rad) reactions were set up in dupli-
cate. Each reaction well was mixed to a final volume of 20 mL
with the following: 10 mL of 2� ddPCR supermix for probes,
no 20-deoxyuridine 50-triphosphate; 1 mL of 20� variant target
primers/probe set (450nmol/L primers/250 nmol/L fluorescein
amidite OR 6-carboxyfluorescein probe); 1 mL of 20� control
target primers/probe set (450 nmol/L primers/250 nmol/L
50-hexachloro-fluorescein-CE phosphoramidite probe); and up
to 7 mL of the test template DNA (either cfDNA or cDNA).
Restriction digestion of template DNA was executed within
the PCR mix by adding two to five units of enzyme (HindIII,
AluI, MseI) per nanogram of DNA where applicable. HindIII
was used for EGFR T790M and L858R; AluI, for EGFR
DE746-A750; and MseI, for all KRAS assays (New England
BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). The EML4-ALK assay did not include
a restriction enzyme. No-template control reactions were per-
formed with water in place of the DNA template and were run
with every assay within a plate. PrimePCR assays used for
variant detection are listed in Supplemental Table S2.
Droplet generation was performed with either a manual
or automated droplet generation QX200 system (Bio-Rad)
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
guidelines.
Once
emulsions were generated, plates were placed into a C1000
Touch thermocycler (Bio-Rad). The thermocycling profile
was optimized as follows: enzyme activation, one cycle
(95�C, 10 minutes), followed by denaturation (94�C,
30 seconds) and annealing/extension (55�C, 1 minute) at a
ramp rate of approximately 2�C/second for 40 cycles. To
conclude the procedure, enzyme was deactivated at 98�C for
10 minutes, followed by hold at 4�C (ramp rate, approxi-
mately 1�C/second). After amplification, the plate was
transferred to the droplet reader (Bio-Rad). Samples were
read using the Rare Event Detection module on the reader
(QuantaSoft version 1.7.4.0917; Bio-Rad).

numbers. The GUSB RNA and the WT DNA variants were
used as assay-quality controls to verify the presence of
circulating nucleic acids of quality and quantity sufficient

the total number of copies per sample. The clinical cutoff
for validation studies was defined as two or more copies of

 dilutions were performed by diluting mutant-allele samples
into WT background at 1:8, 1:40, 1:200, 1:1000, and
1:5000. In the 1:5000 dilution condition, a mean of 8 copies
of the mutant allele and 48,400 copies of the WT allele were
detected to generate a lower limit of detection of 0.02%
MVF (Supplemental Figure S2). This analytical limit of
detection demonstrates the sensitivity of the system. In
practice, although we have observed a few cases that have
reached this lower bound, the majority of samples from
cancer patients (when blood is processed according to our
protocol) do not have enough circulating WT DNA to
permit detection at the 0.02% MVF limit.
Following initial system qualification, an initial verifica-
tion study was performed to evaluate the sensitivity and
specificity of each assay for its intended target and not off-
targets. These experiments were performed using synthetic
DNA control templates designed to mimic either circulating
tumor (ct) DNA fragments for EGFR mutations L858R,
DE746eA750,
and
T790M,
KRAS
mutations

G12D, G12V, or the cDNA generated from circulating

and

(Supplemental Table S1). For example, the EGFR T790M
assay was tested using synthetic DNA templates harboring
either the DE746eA750, L858R, or T790M mutation. As
expected, the T790M assay detected only T790M template,
but neither of the other two EGFR templates. These results
indicate that the T790M assay is specific to EGFR T790M
template
but
no
off-target
activity
toward
the
other
EGFR variants.
Although synthetic templates such as gBlocks are valuable
tools, they are not the ideal surrogate for cfDNA because they
are homogenous in nature and thus do not reflect the true
fragmentation status of cfDNA. Thus, in addition to the
gBlock studies, we used the combination of sonication and
restriction enzyme digestion to evaluate genomic DNA from
cell lines. Each assay was evaluated using either genomic
DNA or total RNA extracted from cell lines expressing each
variant of interest (Horizon Discovery). Individual assays
successfully detected the cell line reported to express such
variant but did not detect cell lines that expressed alternative
variants (data not shown). Additional feasibility and verifi-
cation were completed to optimize each step in the workflow.
Studies included optimization of extraction volumes, ther-
mocycling conditions, and reverse-transcription enzyme se-
lection (data not shown).
Evaluation of Assay Precision
Technical concordance between the results from the assays
developed for this study and reported reference results was
assessed using ddPCR methods performed in an external
laboratory (Horizon Discovery). The data were generated
using
genomic
DNA
from
the
predefined
cell
line
reference standards described in Materials and Methods
for EGFR and KRAS. The %MVF detected in each labo-
ratory (Figure 1A), as well as the mutant copy numbers
(Supplemental Table S3), are reported (r Z 0.8117,
P Z 0.061). Interoperator studies were also performed for
all variants. Two individual operators generated results
(Supplemental Table S4) with a high level of concordance
(r Z 0.9333, P Z 0.0007).
Interday and intraday precision testing was performed on
three samples for each of the variants. Where available,
these studies were executed using plasma samples from
donors with cancer that were predefined as having the
desired mutation at variable frequencies. For the L858R and
EML4-ALK assays, we were unable to identify donor
samples of a quantity sufficient for use in the precision
studies. Thus, L858R precision test data were supplemented
using analytical cell line control material (Horizon quanti-
tative standards), and EML4-ALK analytical performance
data were generated using the EML4-ALK multiplexed
analytical RNA standard. Intraday testing was completed
with three runs of each sample performed in a single day
(Figure 1, B and C). Interday testing was completed with
one run of each sample on 3 consecutive days (Figure 1, D
and E). Using predefined performance criteria based on the
detection of copies in all replicates and in all samples, all
samples passed evaluation.
Robustness evaluation was conducted for each variant
assay by analysis of the performance of the assay over 21
consecutive business days (Figure 2). EGFR and KRAS
robustness studies were executed using a multiplexed cell
line standard (custom-blended by Horizon Discovery; same
as in Supplemental Table S3), whereas testing for the
EML4-ALK multiplex assay was performed using multi-
plexed RNA standards (Table 2). These controls were
spiked into healthy-donor plasma each day, extracted, and
processed through the entirety of the workflow. Consistent
with the criteria used in our evaluation of precision, all
samples passed the robustness evaluation.
Evaluation of Assay Accuracy
The accuracy of each assay was evaluated with plasma
samples from healthy donors as well as variant-negative
and variant-positive samples from donors with cancer.
Twenty healthy-donor plasma samples were processed for
isolation of cfDNA and evaluated using each of the EGFR
and KRAS variant assays; in none of these cases were

 mutations detected by ddPCR. Ten healthy-donor samples
were processed for isolation of circulating RNA and
evaluated using the EML4-ALK multiplexed assay; in
none of these cases were fusion variants detected by
RT-ddPCR.
The sample sets from donors with cancer evaluated for
each variant assay are enumerated in Table 1. Results
obtained from each individual clinical validation sample,
including initial plasma volumes, quantity of recovered
cfDNA, and maximum reachable sensitivities (expressed as
%MVF for EGFR and KRAS genetic variants), as well as
initial plasma volumes and mutant copies detected for

transcript
variants,
can
be
found
in
Supplemental Tables S5eS11. In many cases, a single
donor sample was used to generate multiple reference
results because of the mutual exclusivity of the variants. For
example, an EGFR L858R sample is generally considered to
be mutually exclusive with the EGFR DE746-A750 variant.
Thus the number of evaluable validation reference samples
(n Z 343) was more than the number of total individual
donors with cancer (n Z 172).
The clinical factors of cancer tissue of origin and cancer
staging varied in the samples from donors with cancer. In
addition,
the
reference
methodology
included
Sanger
sequencing, pyrosequencing, and PCR [Cobas (EGFR),
Roche and Therascreen (EGFR and KRAS), Qiagen], all
performed on tissue for the DNA-variant references. The
clinical accuracy evaluation for each individual assay is
shown in Figure 3, along with representative results of a
two-dimensional plot of a variant detected and variant not
detected. A summary of the overall sensitivity, specificity,
and concordance results for each individual variant, as
well as by class, is shown in Table 3. Clinical sensitivities
ranged from 78.6% for the G12D variant to 100% for the
G12V and L858R variants, whereas clinical specificities
were 100% for all assays. Of note, the prevalence of EML4-
ALK variants in our test represent 78.4% of the total
EML4-ALK transcripts generated from ALK rearrangements.
Since the reference method in this data set was variant
agnostic (ie, Vysis break-apart FISH and Ventana immu-
nohistochemistry tissue results), we adjusted our specificity
and concordance by estimating that our EML4-ALK plasma
RT-ddPCR assay would maximally capture 78.4% of ALK
tissueepositive
samples.30
Thus, the
adjusted
clinical
sensitivity of the EML4-ALK assay was 85%. The overall
mean sensitivity, specificity, and concordance for the
group of variants described were 90.0%, 100%, and 97.0%,
respectively.
Test Utilization in the Clinical Setting
We next evaluated metrics associated with physicians’
usage of the seven variant-specific assays. The workflow for
clinical sample processing is represented in Figure 4A.
Data were extracted from the secure Laboratory Information
Management System, and all protected health information
was excluded from the analysis. Although we deliberately
developed these tests to have utility for NSCLC, up to 6% of
the tests requested to date have been for patients with cancer
from other anatomic sites (data not shown). For the purpose
of this study, we evaluated only samples from patients with
a diagnosis of lung cancer. Of the 1643 patients within this
data set, most were under the care of community physicians,
whereas approximately 11% of orders came from physicians
with academic affiliations (Figure 4B). Importantly, results
were available within 72 hours of sample receipt in 94% of
cases. These data highlight the adoption of mutation testing
by the lung cancer community and demonstrate the utility of
a centralized laboratory for the evaluation of actionable
mutations from blood.
For the majority of test orders, physicians requested
variants as a set of two or more. However, in this sample set,
21% of T790M orders and 5% of EML4-ALK orders were
placed as single-variant test requests (Figure 4C). We found
this to be of interest in the case of EGFR-resistance mutation
testing, where more recent recommendations are to test for
T790M in parallel with the original EGFR driver muta-
tion.31 The proposed reason for testing for the sensitizing
and resistance mutations simultaneously is that smaller,
more indolent tumors may harbor the resistance mutation
but not shed enough ctDNA to allow for detection in
plasma.32 Conversely, if the original EGFR mutation is
found but T790M is not, this could indicate an alternative
mechanism of resistance rather than a problem with cfDNA
detection. The total numbers of each sample submitted for
variant testing, percentage positive or negative, or no test
results, as well as the ranges of clinically relevant sensi-
tivities and variant copies observed are presented in Table 4.
Significantly, we recovered enough circulating nucleic acid
to report on >99% of samples received for DNA testing,
and on >90% of samples received for EML4-ALK fusion
variant testing. Variant copies ranged from a mean of 5.4
(EML4-ALK) to 1216 (EGFR DE746-A750) and %MVFs
ranged from the previously established lower bound of
0.02% (EGFR L858R) to 88.8% (EGFR DE746-A750).

Discussion
Measurement of circulating nucleic acids in plasma has
shown utility in the detection of metastatic cancer,12,33 and
levels are modulated with tumor burden as disease pro-
gresses.11,34e36 ctDNA can also provide an early measure of
treatment response, as has been supported by findings from
analyses of ctDNA in other solid cancers.11,15,16,37,38
However, the accurate detection and quantification of
mutated ctDNA in blood has been challenging due to the
difficulty in discriminating ctDNA from normal cfDNA.37
Measurement of circulating RNA, additionally compli-
cated due to a shorter half-life in circulation, has generally
been achieved when the RNA is extracted from cells and
other vesicles (eg, circulating tumor cells,39e41 tumor-
educated
platelets,42
or
exosomes43,44)
that
protect
circulating RNA. Notwithstanding these considerations, the
potential significance of circulating nucleic acids in diag-
nosis, prognosis, and monitoring has been clearly estab-
lished in various recent studies.10,11,45e47 Additionally,
more efficient procedures for the isolation of circulating
nucleic acids, coupled with highly sensitive detection pro-
cedures,20,48
have
enabled
advances
in
this
area
of
research.45
Our goal was to develop rapid, robust, and highly
sensitive blood-based genome assays with clinical utility.
We
thus
focused
on
actionable
mutations,
including
the
EGFR-sensitizing
(L858R,
DE746-A750)
and
EGFR -resistance (T790M) mutations, and KRAS mutations
G12C, -D, and -V in circulating DNA from donor speci-
mens. Additional studies were conducted to detect the most
prevalent EML4-ALK variant fusions with treatment impli-
cations. We have described in this report a ddPCR testing
service for the detection of clinically actionable variants in
circulating nucleic acids isolated from whole-blood samples
from patients with NSCLC. Variant results are typically
reported within 72 hours of sample receipt, consistent with a
recent report using a similar ddPCR approach.11 As

Rapid Variant Detection in Whole Blood
 described, components of assay development included: i)
workflow optimization for nucleic acid recovery from whole
blood (Figure 4), ii) test system performance verification/
method development studies including precision (Figure 1
and Supplemental Figure S1), iii) robustness (Figure 2),
and iv) analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity
(concordance) analyses with reference samples and results
(Figure 3 and Table 3). Clinical sensitivity for each variant
was individually established, with a range from 78.6% to
100% and a mean of 90.9%. Clinical specificity was
established to be 100% for all variants (Table 3). Overall
concordance was established, with a range of 88.9% to
100% and a mean of 97.0% for all variants.
In addition, we have described the utility of these tests in
clinical practice, with >1600 clinical cases analyzed in this
study (Figure 4 and Table 4). Of particular interest is
the finding that the tests developed are predominantly
ordered by community physicians (76.3%) (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, physicians most frequently request the EGFR-
sensitizing and -resistance variants and the KRAS mutations
(Figure 4B). The EML4-ALK assay in contrast to the cfDNA
tests has been available for a shorter time and thus 304 case
results were available for evaluation; however, the utility
trends for the RNA variants were similar to those of the
DNA test requests. The frequency of detected ALK was
consistent with the current reported prevalence in patients
with NSCLC in the United States.49 We observed a higher
assay failure rate with the RNA variant assay than with the
DNA variants (9.5% versus <1%). This finding likely
supports the argument for inherently less stability of RNA in
circulation. Additionally, similar to what has been previ-
ously reported,50 the ranges of variant burden, as measured
using the validated assay, was highly variable in the patient
population (0.02% to 88.8%) (Table 4) and independent
of plasma volume (3 mL) or the amount of input cfDNA
(2.5 ng per well).
Our data confirm that whole blood is a reliable source for
identifying ctDNA mutations and RNA variants and
demonstrate the potential for blood-based mutation testing
in clinical practice. The assay described herein provides
results within 72 hours from sample receipt, with minimal
false-positive detection rates, which facilitates more rapid
treatment decisions and circumvents the limitations of
tissue-based testing.11 For those patients who do not have
an actionable driver mutation identified by ddPCR, the
addition of more extensive genome and proteome testing
may provide even broader clinical information to support
treatment planning.
