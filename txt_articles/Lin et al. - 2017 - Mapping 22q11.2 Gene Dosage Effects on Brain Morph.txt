Reciprocal chromosomal rearrangements at the 22q11.2 locus are associated with elevated risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. The
22q11.2deletionconfersthehighestknowngeneticriskforschizophrenia,butaduplicationinthesameregionisstronglyassociatedwith
autism and is less common in schizophrenia cases than in the general population. Here we conducted the first study of 22q11.2 gene
dosage effects on brain structure in a sample of 143 human subjects: 66 with 22q11.2 deletions (22q-del; 32 males), 21 with 22q11.2
duplications (22q-dup; 14 males), and 56 age- and sex-matched controls (31 males). 22q11.2 gene dosage varied positively with intracra-
nial volume, gray and white matter volume, and cortical surface area (deletion � control � duplication). In contrast, gene dosage varied
negatively with mean cortical thickness (deletion � control � duplication). Widespread differences were observed for cortical surface
area with more localized effects on cortical thickness. These diametric patterns extended into subcortical regions: 22q-dup carriers had
a significantly larger right hippocampus, on average, but lower right caudate and corpus callosum volume, relative to 22q-del carriers.
Novel subcortical shape analysis revealed greater radial distance (thickness) of the right amygdala and left thalamus, and localized
increases and decreases in subregions of the caudate, putamen, and hippocampus in 22q-dup relative to 22q-del carriers. This study
provides the first evidence that 22q11.2 is a genomic region associated with gene-dose-dependent brain phenotypes. Pervasive effects on
cortical surface area imply that this copy number variant affects brain structure early in the course of development.

Introduction
Reciprocal chromosomal rearrangements represent powerful
models to assess effects of copy number variation (CNV) on brain
morphology and associated neuropsychiatric outcomes. Gene
dosage cannot be experimentally manipulated in humans as it
can in animal or in vitro models, but a similar framework emerges

Significance Statement
Probing naturally occurring reciprocal copy number variation in the genome may help us understand mechanisms underlying
deviationsfromtypicalbrainandcognitivedevelopment.The22q11.2genomicregionisparticularlysusceptibletochromosomal
rearrangements and contains many genes crucial for neuronal development and migration. Not surprisingly, reciprocal genomic
imbalances at this locus confer some of the highest known genetic risks for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we
provide the first evidence that brain morphology differs meaningfully as a function of reciprocal genomic variation at the 22q11.2
locus. Cortical thickness and surface area were affected in opposite directions with more widespread effects of gene dosage on
cortical surface area.

 via naturally occurring genetic variation. Such genomic imbal-
ances confer some of the highest genetic risk factors for prevalent
developmental neuropsychiatric disorders (Malhotra and Sebat,
2012; Hoeffding et al., 2017) and offer a quasi-experimental “re-
verse genetics” approach to elucidate how genes may impact neu-
rodevelopmental phenotypes (Hiroi et al., 2013).
The 22q11.2 locus is a valuable region to investigate gene dos-
age effects on brain development, as it is particularly susceptible
to chromosomal rearrangements due to nonallelic homologous
recombination (Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2002). Occurring at
nearly 1 in 2000 live births (Grati et al., 2015), the 22q11.2 dele-
tion (22q-del), also known as DiGeorge or Velocardiofacial syn-
drome (OMIM #188400, #192430), results from a 1.5–3 Mb
hemizygous deletion on the long arm of chromosome 22 (Shaikh
et al., 2007). 22q-del is the largest known genetic risk factor for
psychotic illness, associated with an �30-fold increase in risk
relative to population base rates (Bassett and Chow, 2008; Green
et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2014). It is also associated with
heightened risk for other developmental neuropsychiatric disor-
ders: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder,
and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (Niklasson et al., 2001,
2009; Vorstman et al., 2006; Girirajan et al., 2011).
Duplications at the same locus (22q-dup) were first reported
clinically in 2003 (Ensenauer et al., 2003). Unlike 22q-del, which
tends to occur de novo, the duplication is frequently inherited
(Ou et al., 2008). Less is known about the 22q-dup phenotype,
which is highly variable (Wentzel et al., 2008), but it appears to be
associated with elevated rates of ASD and delays in language and
psychomotor development (Wenger et al., 2016). In an analysis
of �47,000 individuals, the 22q-dup was significantly less com-
mon in schizophrenia cases than in the general population
(0.014% compared with 0.085%, OR � 0.17), suggesting the first
putative protective mutation for schizophrenia (Rees et al.,
2014). This finding of lower schizophrenia incidence in 22q-dup
carriers compared with noncarriers has now been replicated in
independent studies (Li et al., 2016; Rees et al., 2016; CNV and
Schizophrenia Working Groups of the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium, Psychosis Endophenotypes International Consor-
tium, 2017).
Genes within the 22q11.2 locus are essential for cortical circuit
formation (Meechan et al., 2015a), so it is not surprising that
22q-del carriers show aberrations in cortical anatomy. These ab-
normalities include widespread reductions in cortical volume,
particularly in midline regions, relative to typically developing
controls (Bearden et al., 2007; Jalbrzikowski et al., 2013; Schmitt
et al., 2015). Mouse models of 22q-del show diminished fre-
quency of projection neurons in layers II/III of the medial pre-
frontal cortex, which was in turn associated with the severity of
executive function deficits (Meechan et al., 2015b).
Although no study has yet characterized how a 22q11.2 dupli-
cation affects brain morphometry, dose-dependent effects on hu-
man brain structure have recently been discovered for other
reciprocal CNVs associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes.
Stefansson et al. (2014) first demonstrated dose-dependent ef-
fects of genes within the 15q11.2 locus for measures of regional
brain volume that overlap with regions affected in idiopathic
psychosis. Similarly, reciprocal 16p11.2 deletions and duplica-
tions were found to have global, “mirror image” effects on brain
structure, in which cortical surface area was differentially affected
(Qureshi et al., 2014; Maillard et al., 2015).
We investigated cortical and subcortical anatomic variation at
the 22q11.2 locus to test the hypothesis that reciprocal 22q11.2
deletions and duplications confer opposing effects on brain
structure. We decomposed cortical volume into its constituent
parts, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), which are
thought to have distinct neurodevelopmental origins (Rakic,
1988; Panizzon et al., 2009; Winkler et al., 2010). Any differential
effect of 22q11.2 variants on these measures may point to devel-
opmental processes that are disrupted during corticogenesis in
distinct brain regions as a result of 22q11.2 gene dosage.
Materials and Methods
Participants. The sample consisted of 143 individuals: 66 with molecu-
larly confirmed 22q11.2 deletions (32 males; 34 females), 21 with confirmed
22q11.2 duplications (14 males; 7 females), and 56 demographically
matched, unrelated controls (31 males; 25 females; for demographics, see
Table 1). Approximately 25% of the deletion carriers and controls were
included in a prior publication (Jalbrzikowski et al., 2013). As such, the
current study includes a substantially larger sample of 22q11.2 deletion
carriers and controls, as well as a novel cohort of 22q11.2 duplication
carriers. Patients were ascertained from either (1) the University of Cal-
ifornia at Los Angeles or Children’s Hospital, Los Angeles Pediatric Ge-
netics, Allergy/Immunology and/or Craniofacial Clinics, or (2) local
support groups and websites. Demographically comparable typically de-
veloping comparison subjects were recruited from the same communi-
ties as patients via web-based advertisements and by posting flyers and
brochures at local schools, pediatric clinics, and other community sites.
Exclusion criteria for all study participants included significant neu-
rological or medical conditions (unrelated to 22q11.2 mutation) that
might affect brain structure, history of head injury with loss of conscious-
ness, insufficient fluency in English, and/or substance or alcohol abuse or
dependence within the past 6 months. Healthy controls additionally
could not have significant intellectual disability or meet criteria for any
major mental disorder with the exception of attention deficit-hyper-
activity disorder or a past episode of depression, based on information
gathered during the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Ed 4 (First and Gibbon, 2004)
and/or Computerized Diagnostic Interview for Children (Shaffer et al.,
2000). All participants underwent a verbal and written informed consent
process. Participants under the age of 18 years provided written assent,
while their parent or guardian completed written consent. The Univer-
sity of California at Los Angeles Institutional Review Board approved all
study procedures and informed consent documents.
Psychiatric and cognitive assessment. Supervised clinical psychology doc-
toral students administered neurocognitive and psychodiagnostic evalua-
tions (Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders/Computerized Diagnostic Interview for Chil-
dren, as described above) to study participants. Estimates of general intellec-
tual functioning were obtained for all participants using the Wechsler
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (Wechsler, 1999) or Wechsler Adult Intel-
ligenceScale,Ed4(Wechsleretal.,2008).DiagnosisofASDwasbasedonthe
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2000) and the Autism
Diagnostic Interview-Revised (Lord et al., 1994). To obtain dimensional
measures of ASD-relevant behavior, parents of study participants also com-
pleted the Social Responsiveness Scale (Constantino and Gruber, 2007), a
quantitative measure of reciprocal social behavior that has been extensively
validated in both clinically ascertained and population-based samples and
theRepetitiveBehavioralScale(LamandAman,2007)tocapturepatternsof
restricted repetitive behavior often observed in ASD.
All diagnoses were determined by trained clinicians who participated in
an ongoing quality assurance program (Ventura et al., 1998). Training, reli-
ability, and ongoing quality assurance procedures for psychodiagnostic as-
sessmentsaredetailedinpriorpublications(Jalbrzikowskietal.,2013,2016).

 qRT-PCR. As an initial proof of principle to determine whether dupli-
cation and deletion carriers showed the expected increases or decreases,
respectively, in gene dosage, we first investigated gene expression levels for
threekeygenesinthe22q11.2locus.Peripheralbloodsamplesweredrawnin
two PAXgene tubes and were stored at 4°C. RNA was extracted using the
PAXgene blood RNA kit (PreAnalytix, QIAGEN). We assessed RNA quan-
tity using Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technolo-
gies) and also quality with Agilent Bioanalyzer Nanochips.
qRT-PCR was conducted using TaqMan assays, as described by Cop-
pola et al. (2006). Total RNA was converted into cDNA by SuperScript II
kit (Invitrogen). The reactions were performed with a TaqMan Master
Mix (Bio-Rad) in a 25 �l volume. Assays were performed in triplicate and
analyzed using a Roche Lightcycler. qPCR analyses were performed using
the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method (2-��Ct). We assayed three genes
within the 22q11.2 locus: catechol-O-methyltransferase (comt), DiGeorge
Syndrome Critical Region Gene 8 (dgcr8), and Zinc Finger DHHC-Type
Containing 8 (zdhhc8), using gapdh as a reference gene. Additionally, all
22q11.2 CNV carriers underwent multiplex ligation-dependent probe am-
plification (MLPA) (Sørensen et al., 2010) to determine specific breakpoint
locations (Table 1).
MRI acquisition and preprocessing. Measures of brain structure were
obtained with high-resolution structural MRI. Scanning was conducted
on an identical 3 tesla Siemens Trio MRI scanner with a 12-channel head
coil at the University of California at Los Angeles Brain Mapping Center
or at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (Table 1). Each scan began
with a 10 min acquisition of standard images used for determining re-
gional anatomy, including a sagittal localizer image (TR/TE � 500/33
ms, 192 � 256 matrix), a high-resolution T2-weighted axial image (TR/
TE � 5000/33 ms, 128 � 128 matrix, FOV � 200 � 200 mm), and a
sagittal 1 mm 3 T1-weighted image. We used FreeSurfer to process 1 mm 3
T1-weighted anatomical images acquired with an MPRAGE sequence.
The parameters for the MPRAGE were the following: TR � 2.3 s, TE �
2.91 ms, FOV � 256 mm, matrix � 240 � 256, flip angle � 9°, slice
thickness � 1.20 mm, 160 slices. The FreeSurfer image analysis suite
(version 5.3.0; http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) surface-based pro-
cessing pipeline was used to derive measures of volume, cortical thick-
ness, and surface area. FreeSurfer is a well-validated processing package
that has been previously described in detail (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al.,
1999). We extracted cortical measures based on the Desikan FreeSurfer
atlas (Desikan et al., 2006).
Quality assessment of MRI. Structural T1-weighted MRI brain scans were
analyzedinanunbiased,whole-brainapproachusingwell-validatedanalysis
and quality control protocols developed for the ENIGMA consortium (En-
hancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) (Thompson et
al., 2014), which have previously been applied in large-scale studies of
major depression (Schmaal et al., 2016), bipolar disorder (Hibar et al.,
2016), and schizophrenia (van Erp et al., 2016). We used the ENIGMA
quality assessment pipeline (Thompson et al., 2017) to determine scan
quality. Segmented regions were visually inspected and statistically eval-
uated for outliers following standardized ENIGMA protocols (http://
enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols). Briefly, the pipeline
includes three major steps: (1) extracting and organizing brain measures
from FreeSurfer, (2) quality checking the outputs wherein a set of repre-
sentative cross-sections from each subject are displayed with colored
FreeSurfer segmentations, and (3) calculating population summary sta-
tistics of the cortical traits and related histograms. Visual inspections of
ENIGMA snapshots were completed by 3 separate individuals who were
blind to diagnostic status. Scans of 4 22q-dup participants, 3 control
participants, and 5 22q-del participants failed the initial quality control
assessment. The 22q-dup participant scans were then manually edited
using standard procedures (detailed in Jalbrzikowski et al., 2013), after
which they passed QC assessment.

 Subcortical shape analysis. As conventional subcortical volume analysis
may obscure fine-grained differences in anatomical changes, a novel
surface-based high-resolution parametric mapping technique was used
to investigate shape differences across subjects for all subcortical re-
gions of interest (ROIs) (Mamah et al., 2016). This technique is sen-
sitive to subtle volumetric variations (Gutman et al., 2012, 2015) that
may represent underlying subfield organization (Wang et al., 2008). It
has recently shown high vertexwise heritability, suggesting that shape
indexes a biologically valid phenotype (Roshchupkin et al., 2016). A
growing body of evidence indicates that different diseases have dis-
tinct effects on hippocampal subfields (Small et al., 2011); these lo-
calized patterns of disease effects may extend to other subcortical
structures as well.
Using FreeSurfer segmentations as an initial input for creating
the shape models, shape registration was based on existing shape
templates and template “medial” models. The shape template was

 made by registering all subjects to a representative subject. The Eu-
clidean average of these shapes served as the template surface, from
which the template medial curve was computed. A pointwise measure
of shape morphometry, radial distance, was derived for all 14 subcor-
tical ROIs for each subject, using a medial model approach (Gutman
et al., 2012, 2015). For each point p � M on the surface, and given
a medial curve c: [0, 1] ¡ �3, the radial distance is defined by the
following:

In this way, radial distance (termed “thickness” henceforth) was calcu-
lated in native space for up to 2500 homologous points across each
subcortical structure, providing a detailed index of regional shape
differences across subjects. We included only those shape models that
passed visual inspection and conformed to T1-weighted MRI anatomical

 boundaries using the ENIGMA Shape Analysis Quality Assessment Pro-
tocol (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols/).
Statistical analysis. The primary statistical analyses were performed in
SPSS software version 24 (IBM; RRID: SCR_002865). Additional demo-
graphic comparisons and effect size calculations were done in either
MATLAB version R2015a (The MathWorks; RRID: SCR_001622) or R
3.0.2 (R Core Team, 2016; RRID: SCR_000432). Statistical modeling for
shape analyses was performed using the R stats package (https://stat.ethz.
ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/lm.html). We conducted inde-
pendent samples t tests for continuous variables and � 2 tests for categor-
ical variables. For the analyses of relative gene expression differences, we
conducted separate univariate ANCOVAs with gene expression level as
the dependent variable, CNV status as the independent variable, and age,
gender, and qRT-PCR batch as covariates.
Significance testing for our primary analyses was conducted in two
steps. First, we determined whether 22q11.2 CNVs had an effect on stan-
dard FreeSurfer ROIs for CT and SA, as well as volumes of subcortical
structures and global brain metrics (total intracranial volume, total gray,
and white matter volume, total SA, and average CT). For this omnibus
test, we performed an ANCOVA and false discovery rate (FDR) correc-
tion at q � 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) for the number of
regions, for each brain metric. Group (22q-dup, 22q-del, or control) was
used as the independent variable, and each ROI was included as the
dependent variable with age, sex, and scanner location as covariates.
Analyses of cortical and subcortical volume included intracranial volume
(ICV) as an additional covariate. Given the considerable variance across
different brain structures, we performed an ANCOVA for each ROI in-
dependently. Second, for regions that passed the FDR-corrected omni-
bus test, we conducted post hoc tests for each pairwise comparison,
applying the same correction used for the initial omnibus test.
For subcortical shape analyses, a multiple linear regression model was
used to assess surface-based thickness differences between 22q-del carri-
ers, 22q-dup carriers, and controls after correcting for age, sex, ICV, and
scanner location. The model was fitted at each point across the surface of
each subcortical structure. As these values were calculated in native
space, ICV was included as a covariate to regress out effects of head

 size. To correct for multiple comparisons, a standard FDR correction
was again applied at q � 0.05. Statistical models were fitted for the
following comparisons of interest: 22q-del carriers versus controls,
22q-dup carriers versus controls, and 22q-dup carriers versus 22q-del
carriers. All results described below are FDR-corrected unless other-
wise indicated.
Sensitivity analyses. To determine whether group differences in brain
structure are attributable to familial relationships between 22q-dup pa-
tients, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on a subset of the duplication
cohort comprising only unrelated individuals (N � 11), in which we
determined whether the parameter estimates for this subset differed from
those obtained on the full cohort. Specifically, we tested whether the
adjusted means calculated for unrelated subjects were within 2 SEs of the
adjusted means of the full cohort. 22q-dup patients in the subset were
selected with the aim of maintaining similar mean age and sex ratios to
the control and 22q-del group.
We conducted a similar secondary analysis to rule out the effect of
antipsychotic medication on brain structure, in which 8 participants (7
22q-del carriers and 1 22q-dup carrier) who were taking antipsychotic
medication at the time of visit were excluded. This approach was chosen
as the small sample size of the subgroup precluded a mixed model anal-
ysis that explicitly accounted for family structure. Similarly, the con-
founding of medication use and group made a direct analysis of the
effects of antipsychotic medication difficult to interpret. These sensitivity
analyses are designed to show that the inclusion/exclusion of these par-
ticipants does not bias the results.
Additionally, we conducted secondary analyses in which we covaried
for: (1) race and (2) global brain metrics (mean cortical thickness and
total cortical surface area).
Results
Neuropsychiatric and cognitive findings
There were significant differences in Full Scale IQ between
groups: 22q-del carriers had the lowest IQ scores, followed by
22q-dup carriers, then control participants had the highest IQ
scores (Table 1). The same pattern persisted for the Verbal IQ
domain; however, for Nonverbal IQ (as measured by Matrix Rea-
soning), 22q-del carriers performed significantly more poorly
than 22q-dup carriers and controls, who did not differ from each
other. Four 22q-del carriers and no 22q-dup carriers were diag-
nosed with a psychotic disorder, but rates of ASD were elevated in
both groups. 22q-del and 22q-dup carriers had similarly elevated
scores on dimensional measures of autism-relevant symptom-
atology (Social Responsiveness Scale and Repetitive Behavioral
Scale scales) relative to control participants.
mRNA expression
As shown in Figure 1, qRT-PCR analyses revealed a linear effect of
gene dosage on mRNA expression levels of COMT and ZD-
HHC8, but not DGCR8 (Fig. 1).
Gene dosage effects on global brain metrics
There were no significant main effects of scanner location, but
significant effects of group were found for total intracranial vol-
ume (F(2,137)� 7.12, p � 0.001), total gray matter volume (F(2,136) �
5.43, p � 0.005), cortical white matter volume (F(2,136) � 11.88,
p � 1.76e-5), total cortical SA (F(2,137) � 35.37, p � 4.1e-13),
mean CT (F(2,137) � 4.60, p � 0.01), and the corpus callosum
(F(2,136) � 7.32, p � 9.6e-4; Fig. 2A–F). Effects of gene dosage
appeared generally proportional in magnitude relative to con-
trols for callosal volume and cortical thickness, although for total
intracranial, gray and white matter volume and SA, the percent-
age reduction in deletion carriers was more substantial than the
relative increase seen in duplication carriers (Table 2; Fig. 2).
Further, as shown in Figure 2, the effects of this CNV on brain
structure did not appear to be accounted for by a subset of se-
verely affected individuals, but rather, the entire distribution was
shifted, suggesting a highly penetrant effect (Qureshi et al., 2014).
Post hoc pairwise contrasts revealed that the significant effect of
group was driven by patterns of differences between 22q-del and
22q-dup carriers, as well as 22q-del carriers and controls.
Effects of reciprocal 22q11.2 variation on cortical thickness
Omnibus ANCOVA revealed a significant effect of group for 20
ROIs (Table 3). Across cortical regions, 22q-dup tended to show
lower thickness compared with 22q-del with controls showing an
intermediate pattern (Fig. 3). Post hoc pairwise t tests revealed
that, compared with controls, 22q-del showed significantly
greater thickness in 8 ROIs and significantly lower thickness in 1

 ROI. In contrast, 22q-dup carriers had significantly lower CT
relative to controls, specifically in 3 lateral frontal and parietal
ROIs: the left caudal and superior frontal gyrus, and the right
precuneus (Table 3). 22q-dup carriers also showed cortical thin-
ning relative to controls at a nominal uncorrected p � 0.05 level
in predominantly frontal and sensorimotor regions (Fig. 4A). As
shown in Figure 3, the decreases in 22q-dup carriers in regional
cortical thickness measures are proportional to the increases ob-
served in 22q-del carriers, albeit in somewhat different cortical
regions; specifically, increased CT in 22q-del carriers was greatest
in the insula and inferior frontal regions, whereas reductions of
CT in 22q-dup were greatest in frontoparietal regions.
Opposing effects on cortical surface area
Pervasive effects of gene dosage were observed for cortical SA
with significant effects of group for 52 ROIs (Table 4). Cortical SA
showed a pattern opposite to that observed for CT: 22q-dup car-
riers largely showed greater SA compared with 22q-del carriers
and controls mostly intermediate (Fig. 5). No differences be-
tween 22q-dup and controls survived correction, but 16 ROIs
showed nominally significant differences at an uncorrected p �
0.05 level (Fig. 4B). These regions included most of the cortex
with differences of greatest magnitude observed in medial frontal
cortex, the cingulate, superior temporal gyrus, and bank of the
superior temporal sulcus (Fig. 5), notably, key components of
social cognitive neural circuitry (Lieberman, 2007).
Moreover, there was a notable divergence in the brain regions pre-
dominantlyaffectedbythedeletionversusduplication.Althoughreduc-
tions of cortical SA were of greatest magnitude in parietal regions for
22q-del carriers, SA increases in the duplication group were greatest in
frontotemporal and midline regions (i.e., cingulate cortex).
Effect size plots for 22q-dup carriers versus controls confirmed a
global divergent pattern between CT and SA: SA was larger in 22q-
dup carriers relative to controls (median effect size: Cohen’s d �
�0.22)withanegativevalueindicatinglargercorticalSAin22q-dup
carriers (Fig. 6B). Effects on CT, although more localized, were gen-
erally in the opposite direction. 22q-dup carriers showed lower
thickness relative to controls (median effect size: Cohen’s d � 0.20),
most notably in superior frontal regions (Fig. 6A).

 riers versus controls across cortical regions (Fig. 6C,D), indicate
that there is substantial regional variability in the effects of the
22q11.2 duplication on brain structure. With a sample size ap-
proximately equivalent to that of our deletion and control
groups, we would also be likely to find significant thickness dif-
ferences in additional frontoparietal regions in the duplication
cohort (i.e., the bilateral supramarginal, precentral and postcen-
tral gyrus, and left entorhinal cortex and insula). However, much
larger samples would be required to observe thickness differences
in temporal structures, as indicated by the smaller effect sizes in
these regions. The regional distribution of effect sizes differs
somewhat for cortical SA (Fig. 6D). With comparable sample
sizes to our deletion and control groups, we would likely identify
significant differences in SA in midline and right lateral parietal
regions, as well as the frontal pole and left temporal regions (en-
torhinal cortex, bank of the superior temporal sulcus) in dupli-
cation carriers versus controls. However, in other regions, the
effects were quite small, likely requiring several hundred subjects
to detect a significant group difference.

Significant effects of group extended into subcortical structures.
Although pairwise differences between 22q-dup carriers and con-
trols did not survive multiple comparisons correction for global

differences between 22q-dup and 22q-del carriers. Pairwise signifi-

tern: 22q-del carriers showed greater volume, whereas 22q-dup
showed a decrease in volume compared with controls.
Novel shape analysis methods revealed a widespread and
complex pattern of differences in local thickness measures
between 22q-del and 22q-dup carriers in subcortical regions (Fig.

Lin et al. • 22q11.2 Gene Dosage and Brain Morphometry
 et al., 2016), regions of greater thickness in the 22q-dup carriers
approximately correspond to subiculum and CA1 regions,
whereas decreased thickness in 22q-dup carriers approximately cor-
responds to CA2–4/dentate subfield regions. In contrast, largely
lower local thickness measures were found in bilateral putamen and
caudate structures in 22q-dup relative to 22q-del carriers with small
localized regions of greater thickness.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses revealed that neither familial relatedness nor
antipsychotic medication generally influenced the parameter es-
timates of interest. For the subsample of unrelated individuals,
the estimated effects for all global metrics, as well as the ROIs
showing significant 22q-dup versus control differences, were all
within 2 SEs of the estimated effects in the primary analyses
(Table 6). Similarly, the results of the analyses excluding partici-
pants on antipsychotics were within 2 SEs of the estimates ob-
tained in the primary analyses for all ROIs.
Moreover, covarying for race did not alter our overall pat-
tern of findings. Specifically, significant 22q-dup versus con-
trol differences in cortical thickness in all previously identified
ROIs (the left caudal and superior frontal gyrus, and the right
precuneus) remained significant, and an additional region,
the right superior frontal gyrus, was also found to be signifi-
cantly different.
Finally, after adjusting for mean thickness (Table 7), 7 of the
17 ROIs remained significant for 22q-del versus 22q-dup differ-
ences. The 3 ROIs in which we observed 22q-dup versus control
differences remained significant, regardless of whether average
cortical thickness was included as a covariate or not, indicating
localized effects of the 22q11.2 CNV on thickness. In contrast,
covarying for total SA reduced the magnitude of deletion-
duplication differences in regional SA measures. Specifically,
only 8 of the 50 previously identified ROIs remained signifi-
cantly different for 22q-del versus 22q-dup comparisons (Ta-
ble 8), suggesting that our SA results should be interpreted as
a diffuse, global surface deficit in 22q11.2 deletion carriers
with additional regional accentuation in occipitoparietal and
cingulate regions.
Discussion
22q11.2 copy number variation was associated with global op-
posing effects on brain structure, involving widespread cortical
SA reductions in deletion carriers with corresponding enlarge-
ment in duplication carriers. CT showed an opposite, more lo-

22q11.2 gene dosage implications for
neuropsychiatric disorders
There is now replicated evidence that duplications at 22q11.2 are
substantially less common in schizophrenia cases than in the gen-
eral population, but reciprocal deletions are an established strong
risk factor for schizophrenia (Rees et al., 2014, 2016). Our find-
ings suggest a possible underlying neurobiological basis for these
divergent behavioral phenotypes. We found opposing effects of
CT and SA in in 22q-del versus 22q-dup in medial temporal and
frontal brain regions strongly implicated in idiopathic schizo-
phrenia (Palaniyappan et al., 2011; Shepherd et al., 2012), sug-
gesting relevant underlying brain mechanisms that may be
selective for schizophrenia. Alternatively, because both 22q-
del and 22q-dup confer increased risk for ASD, opposing ef-
fects in common brain regions implicated in autism (Ecker et
al., 2013; Wallace et al., 2015; Ohta et al., 2016) (e.g., decreased
vs increased SA in medial frontal regions in 22q-del and 22q-
dup, respectively) may result in similar downstream pheno-
typic effects on traits, such as language delay and reciprocal
social behavior deficits. Future, prospective longitudinal
brain-behavior investigations in these two groups are neces-
sary to test these hypotheses.
22q11.2 gene dosage effects on brain structure
Critical to our study framework, we separately measured CT and
SA, two cortical measures that likely have different phylogenetic
and ontogenetic origins (Rakic, 1995; Panizzon et al., 2009) and
distinct developmental trajectories (Raznahan et al., 2011; Wi-
erenga et al., 2014). Our findings of opposing directions of effect,
as well as more pervasive effects of the 22q1l CNV on SA relative
to CT, suggest that different mechanisms may be involved. In
particular, increased progenitor cell production during early em-
bryonic development predominantly influences SA expansion
(Rakic, 1988); thus, widespread SA decreases in 22q-del may re-
flect reduced production of progenitor cells in multiple cortical
areas, implying that these divergent phenotypes arise early in the
course of development. Nevertheless, these effects were not en-
tirely proportional in magnitude, as deletions conferred a rela-

 tively larger “hit” to SA and to global brain volume metrics than
did duplications. This pattern is consistent with the relatively
milder effect of 22q-dup on cognition, which aligns with epide-
miological findings that duplication CNVs tend to have less del-
eterious effects on cognition (Ma
¨nnik et al., 2015). Widespread
SA reductions in 22q-del, with more subtle increases for 22q-dup,
may be a potential mechanism underlying differential deficits in
cognition associated with deletions at this locus. However, re-
gional CT decreases in 22q-dup were proportional to the in-
creases observed in deletion carriers, albeit in somewhat different
cortical regions.
While deletion-duplication differences in SA were widespread
throughout the cortex, including frontotemporal regions critical
for language (Friederici and Gierhan, 2013) and medial and lat-
eral frontal and parietal regions implicated in self-referential
thought and social perception (Kennedy and Adolphs, 2012),
effects on CT were more localized. Despite the notable divergence
in the specific brain regions predominantly affected by the dele-
tion versus duplication, regions with the greatest magnitude of
effects are notable in their shared role in social-cognitive neural
circuitry (Lieberman, 2007; Adolphs, 2009).
The overall patterns detected in the cortex persisted into sub-
cortical regions, previously shown to be affected by 22q-del (Bish
et al., 2004; Kates et al., 2004), suggesting global effects of 22q11.2
CNV on brain development. Our novel shape analysis revealed
localized patterns of subcortical alteration, which may corre-
spond to underlying anatomic subfields that cannot be resolved
by conventional volumetric approaches (Mamah et al., 2016).
We found largely higher local thickness in 22q-dup relative to
22q-del carriers in bilateral hippocampal, left thalamus, and right
amygdala structures; the opposite pattern was observed for bilat-
eral putamen and caudate structures, which together form the
dorsal striatum and importantly contain the same types of neu-
rons and circuits (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990). Local and
global hippocampal reductions in 22q-del are consistent with
findings in a mouse model, indicating decreased density of den-
dritic spines and glutamatergic synapses as well as impaired den-
dritic growth, in primary hippocampal neurons (Mukai et al.,
2008). To our knowledge, no preclinical models of the reciprocal
duplication have yet been developed; thus, it is unclear the extent
to which our human findings are recapitulated in animal models.
Future work aims to map known subfields to subcortical surface

underlying compartmental effects detected by this shape analysis
technique.
Genes critical for cortical circuit formation in the
22q11.2 locus
The 22q11.2 region houses many genes highly conserved in
model organisms and expressed in the developing brain. Some
22q11.2 genes are selectively expressed in cortical progenitors in
the ventricular/subventricular zones (e.g., ranbp1 and cdc45l),
whereas others, including dgcr8, a microRNA processing cofac-
tor, are more broadly expressed in cortical neurons (Meechan et
al., 2015a). As many of these genes are expressed early in devel-
opment, diminished dosage of multiple 22q11.2 genes may lead
to compromised proliferative and neurogenic capacity of neuro-
nal precursors.
Although the function of individual 22q11.2 genes in the de-
veloping cortex remains poorly understood, ranbp1 gene dosage
remains a candidate mechanism as a regulator of early nervous
system development (Paronett et al., 2015). ranbp1 homozygous
null mouse embryos are either exencephalic or microcephalic at
early stages. ranbp1 plays a role in rapidly dividing precursors in
the developing cortex, loss of which may compromise the overall
pool of cortical radial glial progenitors, resulting in a smaller
brain.ranbp1 � / �embryoswerefoundtohaveselectivelydisrupted

block including the ranbp1 and dgcr8 genes was associated with id-
iopathicschizophrenia(Liuetal.,2002).Thus,targetedstudiesofthe
effects of overexpression and underexpression of Ranbp1 and other
key neurodevelopmental genes in the locus are warranted.
Gene-dosage effects in other reciprocal CNVs
Notably, dose-dependent effects of two other neuropsychiatric
CNVs (15q11.2 BP1-BP2 and 16p11.2) on brain structure have
recently been discovered. Our findings of similar diametric pat-
terns in the 22q11.2 locus suggest that this anthropometric vari-
ation may be regulated by multiple, distinct genomic regions.
Consistent with our 22q11.2 findings, in the Icelandic population
Stefansson et al. (2014) found a positive gene dosage effect of
15q11.2 on gray matter volume, whereas corpus callosum size
was lower in 15q11.2 duplication relative to deletion carriers.
Further, convergent findings across 16p11.2 mouse and human
studies indicate pervasive effects of gene dosage across cortical
and subcortical structures, suggesting the role of genes important
in early development (Horev et al., 2011; Qureshi et al., 2014).
Similar to our results, reciprocal variation at 16p11.2 revealed
widespread alterations in SA (Qureshi et al., 2014); intriguingly,
however, the pattern of findings was in the opposite direction
(deletion � control � duplication). Thus, while gene dosage is
associated with opposing brain phenotypes across these “neuro-
psychiatric” CNVs, deletion or duplication of genomic material
does not consistently determine the direction of effect. Finally, in
a zebrafish model, Golzio et al. (2012) identified a single gene at
the 16p11.2 locus, KCTD13, that is likely responsible for the op-
posing brain phenotypes, as it causes microcephaly when overex-
pressed and macrocephaly when suppressed. It is not yet known
whether the patterns observed for 22q11.2 are attributable to a
single gene or an oligogenic effect.
Study limitations
Several limitations of our study must be noted, such as the mod-
est sample size of our 22q-dup group. As the first study to inves-
tigate effects of reciprocal genomic variation in this region, these
results should be confirmed in subsequent, larger investigations.
Additionally, given the duplication’s inheritance pattern (Went-
zel et al., 2008), many participants in this group were related.
Although effect sizes for our main findings did not substantively
change when removing related individuals, we could not entirely
disentangle familial effects from those of the duplication itself.
Additionally, the two CNV groups contained a greater propor-
tion of subjects of European ancestry than the control group;
nevertheless, covarying for race did not alter the significant find-
ings. Further, although 22q-dup carriers did not differ in nonver-
bal IQ from controls, it was not possible to match nonverbal IQ of
duplication to deletion carriers. Crucially, however, our sample
was highly representative of the phenotypic spectrum of 22q11.2
disorders in the broader population (McDonald-McGinn et al.,
2015; Tang et al., 2016).
In conclusion, elucidating the pathophysiology of develop-
mental neuropsychiatric disorders remains a major challenge,
due to considerable heterogeneity at both the genetic and pheno-
typic level (Geschwind and Flint, 2015). The robust, opposing
effects on brain structure described here highlight the utility of
investigating the influence of reciprocal chromosomal imbal-
ances on neural processes and how these may ultimately contrib-
ute to disease pathogenesis. Prospective longitudinal studies are
underway to track divergent neurodevelopmental trajectories
over time in CNV carriers. Finally, in vitro modeling of reciprocal
CNVs at the 22q11.2 locus offers an avenue to directly character-
ize associated cellular phenotypes.
