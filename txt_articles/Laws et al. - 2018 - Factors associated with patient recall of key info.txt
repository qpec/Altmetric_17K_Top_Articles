Abstract
While some studies have assessed patient recall of important information from ambulatory
care visits, none has done so recently. Furthermore, little is known about features of clinical
interactions which are associated with patient understanding and recall, without which
shared decision making, a widely shared ideal for patient care, cannot occur. Our objective
was to evaluate characteristics of patients and outpatient encounters associated with patient
recall of information after one week, along with observation of elements of shared decision
making. This was an observational study based on coded transcripts of 189 outpatient
encounters, and post-visit interviews with patients 1 week later. Coding used three previ-
ously validated systems, adopted for this study. Forty-nine percent of decisions and recom-
mendations were recalled accurately without prompting; 36% recalled with a prompt; 15%
recalled erroneously or not at all. Provider behaviors hypothesized to be associated with
patient recall, such as open-questioning and “teach back,” were rare. Patients with less than
high school education recalled 38% of items freely and accurately, while patients with a col-
lege degree recalled 65% (p < .0001). In a multivariate model, the total number of items to
be recalled per visit, and percentage of utterances in decision-making processes by the pro-
vider (“verbal dominance”), were significant predictors of poorer recall. The item count was
associated with poorer recall for lower, but not higher, educated patients.
Introduction
The “patient centered” care movement in the 1970s[1] led to interest in models of shared deci-
sion making[2] or concordance.[3] Shared decision making defines the goal of clinical com-
munication as agreement between physicians and patients about whether, when, and how
medicines or other interventions are to be taken, via discussion that includes and respects the
patient’s beliefs and wishes.[4, 5] Barry argues that when there are substantial tradeoffs among
potential benefits, risks, and burdens of treatment, informed choice by patients is essential to
optimizing outcomes.[6] Patient satisfaction has also been associated with directly observed
provider communication behaviors,[7–10] and with patient reports of engagement and

 autonomy in medical care.[7, 11–13] Patients reporting more engagement and autonomy have
in turn been found to be more adherent to therapy.[14, 15]
However, available evidence shows that discussions around decisions in routine outpatient
care lack essential components of informed choice;[16] as do decisions about major elective
vascular surgery.6 Physicians often do not elicit patients’ preferences or discuss reasons not to
take action;[17, 18] disagreement on diabetes management goals and strategies is common;
[19] and physician-patient communication about medications is poor when new medications
are started,[20] when patients are non-adherent,[21] and when patients make medication
changes on their own.14,15
While many factors affect whether decision making is shared and informed, and affect
adherence to medication regimens and other medical advice, people who do not properly
understand and remember instructions have no chance to be adherent. Nor can patients who
do not correctly understand the information provided by their physician legitimately be said
to have shared in decision making.
Studies over several decades have consistently found that patients do not correctly recall
much of the recommendations and information given by their physicians.[22–26] Typically
about half of items are found to be accurately recalled.
Several communicative behaviors are believed or hypothesized to be associated with better
recall, in medical and other contexts. One is summarization at the conclusion of the encoun-
ter.[27, 28] Another widely recognized method is “teach back,” asking the patient to repeat the
information in his or her own words.[29, 30] Providing structure for information in the form
of an initial “table of contents” followed by “chapter headings” has been found to improve
recall of medical information in an experiment with college students.[31] However, these have
not generally be evaluated in the context of ambulatory health care, either for prevalence or
effectiveness.
Knowledge alone is not sufficient for patients to effectively participate in decision making.
[32] While various models of shared decision making have been proposed, they have been
found to share the requirement that providers inform the patient about the nature of the deci-
sion and available options; elicit patient preferences; and integrate those preferences into a
decision making process.[5, 33] Accordingly, we set out to assess the extent to which providers
use behaviors hypothesized to promote recall in ordinary clinical interactions, to assess the
extent to which elements of shared decision making are present, and to determine predictors
of accurate recall and understanding by patients.
Methods
Subjects
We conducted an observational study at two hospital-based outpatient cardiology clinics and
one hospital-based outpatient nephrology clinic. Both providers and patients gave written
informed consent to participate, as did any people accompanying patients who were present
for the encounter. Data collection occurred during 2013 and 2014. Clinic staff informed us
that first visits tend to be uneventful, consisting largely of evaluation and orientation. There-
fore, we enrolled patients who were either coming for second visits, or who were experiencing
an exacerbation or significant treatment decision; and who were scheduled to see an enrolled
provider. Clinic personnel informed study staff ahead of time when an eligible patient was
expected, so a Research Assistant (RA) could be present. Reception staff or a research nurse
asked patients if they were interested in the study, and referred interested patients and any
companions to the RA for enrollment. This study was approved by the Institutional Review

Data collection
Participants completed a brief demographic background questionnaire. The RA then placed
an inconspicuous digital recorder in the examining room, and turned it on. Providers were
instructed how to turn it off if they or the patient wished. Upon completion of the visit, the RA
retrieved the recorder. In the next few days, RAs prepared a structured abstract of the visit
using spreadsheet software, listing treatment options, recommendations and decisions dis-
cussed in the visit; important information discussed in the visit; and behavioral or lifestyle rec-
ommendations. Based on prior consultation with providers, the abstract form was pre-
populated with common treatments in the respective specialties, such as salt restriction or
commonly used medications, with the ability to add any other information freely.
An RA then made a pre-arranged phone call to the patient approximately 7 days after the
visit. The RA first asked the patient to freely recall any important information, treatment
options, decisions or rationale discussed in the visit. For anything the patient failed to men-
tion, the RA would probe using the structured abstract. There followed a semi-structured
discussion of the patient’s experience of the visit, including any unanswered questions or con-
cerns that were not addressed. (The RA also administered structured questionnaires which are
not discussed in this report.) If patients had return visits during the study period, we also col-
lected data for those visits, yielding longitudinal information for some participants. An outside
service transcribed each visit. We corrected the transcripts and then coded them using three
systems.
Transcript coding
The first coding system used is the Generalized Medical Interaction System (GMIAS), which
was designed to extend extant systems for coding and analyzing provider-patient communica-
tion. These systems, which are generally based on defining various physician and patient ver-
bal behaviors and counting their frequencies, have produced insight into physician and patient
role relationships, and have described relationships between physician and patient characteris-
tics and a variety of relevant outcomes.[15, 34, 35] However, most coding systems lack a guid-
ing theoretical framework,[36] and assign only a single code to each utterance. The GMIAS is
based on speech act theory, a central construct in sociolinguistics, which refers to the social act
embodied in an utterance, such as questioning, requesting, directing, representing facts, or
expressing wishes.[37, 38] It has been described previously.[39] The GMIAS assigns two
codes–a speech act code and a topic code—which enables separate or conjoint analysis of ver-
bal behavior and content.[40] The unit of analysis is a completed speech act. While we do not
use topic codes in this analysis, we do consider specific speech acts including various forms of
question–open, closed and leading; and forms of knowledge check–non-specific (e.g. “Do you
understand?”) and teach-back. “What do you want to do” is an open question. Consistent with
good counseling practice, “Do you have any questions” is considered a closed question, while
“What questions do you have?” is an open question. The GMIAS is designed to be readily
adaptable to any clinical practice question or situation, while retaining its basic structure to
permit comparability.
The second coding system we used is the Comprehensive Analysis of the Structure of
Encounters System (CASES).[41] CASES extends the capabilities of the GMIAS by parsing the
structure of the encounter at a higher level. It firsts identifies each of the problems, issues or
tasks addressed in the encounter, which we call “threads,” each of which may contain any or

 all of 4 “processes,” which we label Presentation, Information, Engagement, and Resolution.
Presentation is development of information specific to the patient’s situation, such as symptom
reports, history taking, test results and clinical examination; Information pertains to more gen-
eral facts such as the etiology of a disease or typical prognosis; Engagement refers to interper-
sonal interactions such as expression of empathy and support; and Resolution is the decision
making leading to an outcome. Information that is adduced during the Presentation or Infor-
mation processes may subsequently enter a Resolution process if it is specifically referenced
during discussion or announcement of a decision. Threads are also coded as to the nature of
the resolution, e.g. take no action, prescribe a drug, make a referral, or commit to a lifestyle
change. We also classified resolutions as pertaining to medical intervention, such as prescrib-
ing a medication, changing a dosage, or deciding on a procedure; or behavioral or lifestyle
changes or maintenance such as diet, physical activity, or adherence to a previously prescribed
regimen. Not all threads result in any action. There may be no perceived need because, for
example a condition is self-resolving, a finding is negative, or the thread is merely updating the
provider on a situation. Sometimes, however, a problem is simply not addressed.
The CASES coding enabled us to match patient’s recall of individual decisions and rec-
ommendations to the resolution processes in which they were discussed. Note that there
can be more than one resolution to a thread, e.g. change in the dose of one medication,
introduction of a new one, and a dietary modification (producing two medical resolutions
and one behavioral resolution). In addition to threads pertaining to specific problems or
issues, CASES codes for initial agenda setting, and “wrap up” at the end of the visit, review-
ing key decisions.
There were three coders for this study. One was experienced in GMIAS and CASES coding
prior to this study. She was the “gold standard” coder. After initial didactic training, other cod-
ers coded some of the same encounters as the gold standad and the team met several times to
discuss and resolve discrepancies. We then computed intercoder reliability for both double
coding using both systems. For the GMIAS, with topic codes adapted to the specialties, in
repeated intercoder reliability tests we achieved kappa statistics for top-level topic codes con-
sistently above .86 and as high as .98, with similar results for speech act codes. Kappa statistics
of 0.61–0.80 are considered ‘‘substantial.”[42] For the CASES, there was 85% agreement on
assignment of utterances to threads, 85–100% agreement on assignment of processes within
threads, and 100% agreement on thread ownership in early tests. As there is necessarily some
judgment involved in assigning utterances to threads, however, coders would discuss difficult
issues and resolve them by consensus.
The third coding system we used is the OPTIONS system, a checklist for elements of shared
decision making.[43] Examples of OPTIONS codes are “states the existence of more than one
option to deal with the problem,” and “Pros and cons of options.” We modified the OPTIONS
system to collapse levels of strength for some items, in order to improve reliability. The
OPTIONS system was originally developed to focus on a single index problem.[43] Routine
outpatient visits, however, may produce any number of individual decisions. The CASES sys-
tem created a structure for OPTIONS coding of each treatment decision, making it straightfor-
ward to apply the system to encounters with multiple decision outcomes.
Dependent variable
The dependent variable in our analyses was recall quality. We matched the transcripts of the
follow-up interviews with the corresponding visits, and coded patients’ recall for each resolu-
tion item according to two dimensions: whether it was recalled freely, recalled only after
prompting, or not at all; and whether recall quality was entirely erroneous, partially correct, or

 essentially correct. We used this coding to classify items as recalled freely and accurately;
recalled accurately with prompting; or recalled inaccurately or not at all.
Note that information is often a component of a resolution. For example, a diagnosis may
constitute a resolution, or the information that a test result is not sufficiently concerning to
warrant further action, or the converse. Resolutions may consist of instruction on how to do
something, or may consist of information if the presenting problem was that the patient
wanted information or explanation. Additionally, our assessment of the accuracy of recall of
treatment decisions included the patient’s understanding of the rationale. So generally, recall
of the information relevant to decision making, or at least explicitly referencd in decision mak-
ing, was assessed. Most of the remaining information flow in encounters is actually from
patient to clinician, as the clinician takes history and investigates problems. There is some
additional information flow captured in what we call the information process, such as prog-
nostic and etiological information. If this figures in decision making, it will usually be incorpo-
rated in assessment of accurate understanding.
Analyses
We conducted analyses using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). We first
generated descriptive data on the frequency of items codable for recall, in both medical and
behavioral resolutions; the quality of patient recall; the prevalence of communicative behaviors
hypothesized to be associated with better recall; and OPTIONS codes. As most of the provider
behaviors were uncommon, as were OPTIONS codes, we could not test the association with
recall.
We tested the bivariate association of recall quality with patient level of formal education
using chi-square; and the number of items to be recalled within a visit, and the ratio of pro-
vider to patient utterances (speech acts) in the resolution processes within a visit using ordered
logit models accounting for clustering within patients.
We constructed multivariate ordered logit models, accounting for clustering within patients
to predict patient recall using patient education, number of items to be recalled in a visit, and
the ratio of provider to total (patient + provider) utterances in resolutions processes within the
visit. We tested patient age, gender, and race ethnicity (white non-Hispanic vs. other) as covar-
iates, and we constructed separate models for behavioral and medical resolutions. Covariates
that were not significant at a p<0.05 level were dropped from the model.
Fig 1 shows the structure of the data, with resolutions nested within visits, nested within
patient, nested within providers, nested within clinics. The dependent variable was measured
at the level of the individual resolution/recall; ratio of provider to patient utterances and num-
ber of items to be recalled measured at the level of the visit; and patient education at the patient
level.
Stakeholder engagement
We consulted with physicians in the participating clinics to inform the research design,
including the topic coding schemes and structured abstracts for nephrology and cardiology.
We also organized a standing consultative group of five nephrology and cardiology patients,
plus one patient spouse, with which we consulted on study design, analysis and interpreta-
tion of results. Finally, we presented these results for discussion in a symposium to a diverse
group of physicians, patients, and ancillary providers such as case managers and behavioral
counselors (Providence, RI, January 9, 2016). Results of the symposium inform our inter-
pretation (see Discussion).

 Results
Participants
In one cardiology clinic we enrolled 4 providers; in the second cardiology clinic we enrolled 7
providers, and in the nephrology clinic we enrolled 8 providers. We approached a total of 130
patients, of whom 108 gave informed consent. At least one visit was recorded, and follow-up
data obtained for 102. One of these was observed to have substantial cognitive impairment and
so was excluded from the analysis, leaving a total of 101 patients. These patients completed a
total of 189 visits with complete follow-up data. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 89, with a
mean age of 57. There were 47 men and 54 women. Seventy-three of the 101 subjects were
white, non-Hispanic. (See Table 1.) Visits occurred from September 2012 to March 2013.
Recall opportunities, recall quality and recall promoting behaviors
As the follow-up interviews were based on review of audio recordings under time constraints,
whereas the coding was based on careful review of transcripts, we found some items had been

 overlooked in the interviews. By definition, these were not recalled freely, meaning our overall
assessment of recall quality is probably a slight over-estimate. Of the 12.6% of Medical resolu-
tions considered codable for recall which had been overlooked in the follow-up interview,
most of these were either a patient commitment to undergo a procedure elsewhere, a deferred
decision, or a physician commitment to do something in the future. Slightly less than 15% of
Behavioral resolutions were overlooked in the follow-up, most of them patient commitments
to maintenance of a health-promoting behavior. These could have been considered out of the
universe of relevant decisions, but we treated them as missing values, which we assume are
randomly distributed.
Of 189 visits, all but one had at least one recall-coded medical decision or recommendation,
with a mean of 4.9 per visit (range 1 to 16). At least one recall-coded behavioral resolution
occurred in 149 of the 189 visits, with a mean of 2.7 per visit (range 1 to 14). The total of coded
recalls was 917 medical resolutions and 402 behavioral resolutions. Overall, 49% of resolutions
were recalled freely and accurately, and an additional 36% were recalled accurately with a

 prompt. Fifteen percent could not be recalled or were recalled erroneously. The numbers were
similar when medical and behavioral resolutions were examined separately.
Most items that were recalled with or without prompting were recalled accurately. How-
ever, inaccurate or entirely erroneous recall did contribute to lower scoring for 132, about
10%, of all items. The remaining items were not recalled at all.
We found that the hypothesized recall-promoting behaviors were uncommon. Agenda set-
ting occurred in only 7 of the 189 visits, while wrap-up occurred in only 27. There were a total
of 10 “teach back” events, and only 5 of these happened in resolution processes. Provider open
questions occurred in 16 Medical processes and only 4 Behavioral processes. Providers made far
more utterances than patients. The ratio of provider to patient utterances was 2.5 in Medical
resolution processes and 2.3 in Behavioral resolutions. Finally, OPTION coding found most ele-
ments of shared decision making largely absent. For example, “listing options” was observed
only 15 times. Pros and cons of multiple options were never discussed in behavioral processes.
Correlates of recall quality
Recall was strongly associated with patients’ level of formal education (Table 2, p< 0.0001).
Only about 38% of resolutions were recalled freely and accurately by people with less than a
high school diploma, whereas 65% were recalled freely and accurately by people with a college
degree. This difference was highly significant when accounting for clustering within patients,
and remained significant when selecting only Medical or only Behavioral resolutions.
Patient age, gender, race/ethnicity, and the specialty (nephrology vs. cardiology) were not
associated with recall quality in any models (all p>0.05). In the model of behavioral resolutions
(Table 3), the interaction between resolution count and patient education was statistically sig-
nificant (P = 0.03). For patients with less than high school education, more resolutions were
associated with poorer recall; the same relationship was not seen for more educated patients.
The ratio of provider to total utterances in the resolution process was also significantly associ-
ated with recall; a higher ratio was associated with worse recall, (β = -0.04, p = 0.01). Even after
accounting for the interaction, there was a main effect of resolution count per visit (β = -0.08,
p = 0.04). There was no residual main effect of education (p = 0.34). The only independent var-
iable that was statistically significant in the models of medical resolutions was the ratio of pro-
vider to total utterances (β = -0.02, p = 0.02).
The interpretation of the coefficients is that if a patient were to have one more resolution in
a visit, the ordered log odds of being in the higher resolution quality level would decrease by

 .055; while the odds would decrease by .028 for each 1% increase in the percentage of utter-
ances by providers. We should note that the proportional odds assumption is not met–the con-
trast between erroneous or no recall and accurate recall with prompting dominates over
prompted vs. unprompted recall. While this complicates interpretation of the coefficients, it
does not invalidate the finding of associations.
Discussion
This study has demonstrated the utility of a structured approach to assessing recall quality,
combined with the CASES method to support assessment and analysis of multiple decision
making processes within an encounter. To our knowledge, these tools are novel in the infor-
mation they can generate about interaction processes in clinical decision making. Research has
focused on cognitive biases, such as the relationship of gain and loss framing to decision out-
comes,[44, 45] and ways of presenting numerical risk constructs.[46] The OPTIONS system
assesses the content of the content of clinical decision making communication. However, con-
tent is only one dimension of communication. It is the interaction process, as assessed here by
CASES and the GMIAS, that determines whether patients and family members understand
and remember information, and can participate fully in shared decision making.
We found that there is substantial variation in the number of threads and resolutions per
visit. This is presumably a factor in the cognitive and decisional burden on patients. We found
using rigorously structured inquiry that patients in this sample recalled about 85% of items
accurately, but that less educated patients recalled fewer, particularly when confronted with a
large number of items. We also found that patients recall fewer items when physician utter-
ances are more numerous compared to patient utterances (a measure called “verbal domi-
nance” in the literature), which suggests a relationship between patient engagement and
patient recall.
Our finding that 85% of items are recalled accurately, with or without prompting, repre-
sents a higher rate of recall than in most studies. Not all reports of previous studies make it
clear whether prompting was used, nor do they clarify how accuracy was operationalized, so
we cannot say how comparable this is to previous observations. We also cannot say to what
extent items recalled only with prompting would have been remembered later by respondents
if we had not done the interview; nor can we say how much information would have been
retained at longer-term follow-up. These are appropriate questions for further research.
There is no standard for what percentage of decisions and recommendations patients ought
to remember accurately. Despite our finding of a relatively high percentage of accurate recall,
the 15% of items that are not remembered may be consequential. In our sample, they include,
for example, instructions to reduce salt intake, to change medication dosages, and to seek

 medical attention if certain symptoms occur. Better understanding of the prevalence of risk
and harm to patients from inaccurate recall is needed.
We find that patient recall of specific treatment decisions and behavioral recommendations
is relatively poor for people with little formal education; that recall is negatively associated
with a higher ratio of provider to patient talk in resolution processes; and that the association
of patient education with recall is moderated by the number of items to be recalled.
We also found that recall-promoting behaviors by providers are rare, as are elements of
shared decision making. We must note, however, that with an average of nearly 8 decision
items per visit, it would probably not be feasible to have a substantial shared decision process
for all of them; nor would patients necessarily expect or want this. Most decisions in these vis-
its are routine and, at least from the physician’s point of view do not present difficult tradeoffs.
Typical items include test ordering, dietary restrictions, or medication adjustment. Of course
these might be far more problematic for the patient than the physician realizes. A challenge for
future research is to determine what apparently minor choices or instructions might actually
present significant trade-offs for patients, and how providers and patients can determine what
choices call for substantial decisional processing.
We are not the first investigators to observe that there has been surprisingly little change in
physician-patient interaction over the decades.[47] While our study does not provide any par-
ticular insight into why this is true, it serves as confirmation. It also points to the greater chal-
lenge of achieving a consistently high level of patient understanding and recall with less
educated patients.
The consensus of the symposium participants (see 2.6, “stakeholder engagement”) was that
physicians generally want to practice more patient-centered medicine, but that time pressure
is a major obstacle. Agenda setting, teach back, discussion of multiple options, and open ques-
tions encouraging more patient talk are all perceived as taking up scarce time. The conclusion
was that simply training physicians to use these techniques is unlikely to produce major
change. What is needed is reform and reorganization of the medical enterprise to create more
room within the precious time of the physician-patient encounter to adequately process a lim-
ited number of therapeutic decisions. Systems for pre-visit planning, putting more medical
education and counseling responsibilities on non-physician providers, using technology to
facilitate exchange of information and recall, were all among the proposals.
This study is limited to 3 practices, all located in an academic medical center, and a fairly
small number of physicians. These are not primary care practices, so it will be important to
extend similar work to primary care and other settings. The findings, while based on hypothe-
ses, represent the first time these specific methods have been used and must be considered sub-
ject to replication based on larger and more diverse samples of practices.
The study succeeded in showing the feasibility and face validity of the methods, as the find-
ings are intuitively plausible and generally consistent with previous observations. We hope
they suggest some ways forward to improving medical interactions and patient-centered
outcomes.
Findings suggest that patient recall could be enhanced if providers were to use more of the
techniques to encourage patient engagement, such as open questioning, agenda setting, and
teach-back; and limit the amount of information to be remembered in a single visit based on
an assessment of patients’ ability to recall.
