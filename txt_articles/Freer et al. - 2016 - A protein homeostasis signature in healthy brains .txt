A protein homeostasis signature
in healthy brains recapitulates tissue
vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease
Rosie Freer,1 Pietro Sormanni,1 Giulia Vecchi,1 Prajwal Ciryam,1,2 Christopher M. Dobson,1 Michele Vendruscolo1*
In Alzheimer’s disease, aggregates of Ab and tau in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles spread progres-
sively across brain tissues following a characteristic pattern, implying a tissue-specific vulnerability to the disease.
We report a transcriptional analysis of healthy brains and identify an expression signature that predicts—at ages
well before the typical onset—the tissue-specific progression of the disease. We obtain this result by finding a
quantitative correlation between the histopathological staging of the disease and the expression patterns of the
proteins that coaggregate in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, together with those of the protein ho-
meostasis components that regulate Ab and tau. Because this expression signature is evident in healthy brains, our
analysis provides an explanatory link between a tissue-specific environmental risk of protein aggregation and a
corresponding vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease.
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is char-
acterized by the aggregation of amyloid b (Ab) and tau in amyloid pla-
ques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (1, 6). These assemblies spread
across specific brain tissues, particularly through the formation of
oligomers (7–10), following a characteristic pattern (11). However,
the mechanisms that govern the selective vulnerability of these tissues
are still debated (12–15). To understand why aberrant protein aggre-
gates form in some tissues but not in others, we investigated whether
the cellular environments of the most vulnerable tissues favor disease-
specific protein aggregation.
To implement this idea, we asked whether tissue vulnerability to AD
couldbeassociatedwithfailuresoftheproteinhomeostasissystem(16–19),
resulting from its saturation with an excess of aggregation-prone proteins
(20–25). We therefore explored the hypothesis that vulnerable tissues are
simultaneouslycharacterizedbytheelevatedexpressionofaspecificsubset
of proteins vulnerable to aggregation in AD—those that coaggregate with
Ab and tau in amyloid plaques and NFTs—and by specific expression
signatures of the corresponding protein homeostasis components that
further exacerbate the risk of aggregation of these metastable proteins.
To obtain a measure of the overall propensity of given tissues to
aggregate, we defined a vulnerability score (called D score) based on the
differential expression of the genes corresponding to aggregation-prone
proteins and their regulators. With this vulnerability score, we created a
vulnerability map of healthy brains. If our hypothesis is correct, this vul-
nerability map should recapitulate the histopathological staging of AD.
To test this hypothesis, we used the Braak staging of AD, which is
based on the postmortem detection of NFTs (11), and has been verified
by invivo identification byimaging-based positronemission tomography
scans (26–28). Tau can be considered as an effective reporter of a disease
state because of its vulnerability to misfolding and aggregation when its
environment becomes poorly regulated. The present study, therefore,
can also be seen as an investigation of the variety of complex factors
involved in such dysregulation.
Our results identify a quantitative correlation between the histo-
pathologicalstaging of ADand the specific expression patternsof the genes
corresponding to the proteins that coaggregate in plaques and tangles,
together with those of the genes corresponding to the protein homeostasis
components that regulate Ab and tau. Our analysis thus associates the risk
of protein aggregation in healthy brain tissues, as determined by their
cellular environments, and their corresponding vulnerability to AD.
RESULTS
Plaque and tangle components are highly expressed in
AD-vulnerable tissues
Toinvestigatewhethertheexpressionpatternsofproteinsthatcoaggregate
with Ab and tau in plaques and tangles underlie tissue-specific vulner-
ability to AD, we performed a transcriptome-wide microarray analysis
across more than 500 healthy brain tissues from the Allen Brain Atlas
(see Methods) (29). Here, we characterized the progression of AD using
Braak staging (see Methods) (11), whereby brain regions are classified
according to the temporal appearance of the NFTs, whose deposition
correlates with neuronal loss (see Methods and table S1). We analyzed
the expression data derived from six healthy human brainsof individuals
aged 24 to 57 years, with 93% of known genes represented by at least
two probes (29).
To quantify differential gene expression between tissues, we defined
a D score (see Methods, Fig. 1A, and fig. S1); for a given gene, a positive D
score indicates that the expression in the region under scrutiny is higher
than that in tissues not affected by AD (non-Braak regions). Although a
relatively weakcorrelation existsbetweenmRNAandproteinlevels(30,31),
in this work, we consider average values across groups of genes, and
hence, we expect stronger correlations to be present. To validate this type
of approach, we verified that the patterns of gene expression analyzed
hereareconsistentwiththecorrespondingpatternsofproteinexpression
using two independent data sets (fig. S2) (31, 32), and when possible, we
directly analyzed proteome-level data (see below).
Our analysis revealed the presence of elevated expression levels of
proteins that coaggregate in plaques and tangles in the tissues in which

 AD is first evident, as measured by the average DBI–III score (the D score
for Braak regions I to III) (Fig. 1B and tables S2 and S3). We tested the
statisticalsignificance of these results by calculating the DBI–III scores of 106
random sets of genes of equal size and comparing them to that of Ab and
tauaggregationmodulators(fig.S3).Wealsofoundthatgenescorresponding
to proteins that coaggregate within Lewy bodies (33) in Parkinson’s disease
(PD; see Methods) (34) have elevated expression in a region of the brain
[substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC)] (35) that is highly vulnerable to
thiscondition(fig.S4andtableS3),aresultthatsuggeststhattheparadigm
of tissue vulnerability that we propose here can be applied to other neuro-
degenerative disorders.
A protein homeostasis signature for vulnerability to
aggregation of Ab and tau is evident in healthy brains
Elevated expression levels of proteins that coaggregate in plaques and
tangles may promote aggregation in tissues vulnerable to AD. However,
these levels are similar across different Braak regions and therefore do
not explain by themselves the gradient of tissue vulnerability to disease
(fig. S5). We therefore investigated whether a weak regulation of these
proteins might also contribute to their vulnerability to aggregation. To
analyze the role of the protein homeostasis components, we performed a
literature search to identify molecular chaperones and posttranslational
modifiers known to influence Ab and tau aggregation (table S4). We
found that components of the protein homeostasis system known to pro-
tect against the aggregation of these two proteins have a mean expression
level in tissues most vulnerable to AD lower than that in AD-resistant
tissues (Fig. 2). These effects of reduced activity against aggregation are
compounded by an elevated relative expression of other protein ho-
meostasis componentsreportedto promote aggregation in highly vulner-
able tissues (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the expression patterns of
certain protein homeostasis components associated with protein aggrega-
tion predispose specific tissues in normal brains to be vulnerable to Ab and
tau deposition.
An expression signature associated with protein
aggregation in healthy brains predicts AD progression
Toinvestigatethe relationshipbetween thelevelsofexpressionofprotein
homeostasis components and the tissue vulnerability to AD at a more
granular level, we focused our analysis on tissues where an accurate align-
ment is possible between AD-staged tissues and the tissue parcellation
used in microarray analysis (see Methods and table S5). We found that
expression levels of protein homeostasis components that modulate the
aggregation of Ab and tau in healthy brains (table S6) are good predictors
of tissue vulnerability to AD and recapitulate the staging of the disease

 (Fig. 3 and fig. S5). In addition, we performed a control using proteome-
level data, which were available for mouse tissues (36). We found that the
ranking of the tissue-specific risk using protein data is consistent with that
using mRNA data (fig. S6).
We further investigated other possible causes of tissue vulnerability
to AD, particularly the immune response (Fig. 4 and table S7) (37, 38).
Our analysis of DBI–III scores of biochemical pathways listed in the Kyoto
EncyclopediaofGenesandGenomes(KEGG)database(39)revealedthat
genes associated with inflammatory responses are expressed at elevated
relative levels in healthy brains, whereas genes involved in autoimmune
responses are expressed at lower relative levels in AD-vulnerable tissues
(Fig. 4 and table S7). Because no other immune pathway shows signifi-
cant variation in expression (Fig. 4 and table S7), these results support
previous suggestions of a role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of
AD (37, 38). Thus, the vulnerability of specific tissues in AD may result
from the sum of a number of factors, including the expression levels of
disease-specific, aggregation-prone proteins and their corresponding
protein homeostasis complements, as well as the immune system.
Tissue vulnerability as assessed by the DBI–III scores is
specific to AD
To assess the possibility that the transcriptional signatures observed here
are generic to all neurodegenerative disorders, we repeated the D analysis
for a number of aggregation modulator sets relevant to amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis (ALS) and PD (fig. S7). We compared the distributions of
mean DBI–III scores for aggregation modulators of Ab and tau (AD),
a-synuclein (PD), and TDP43 and SOD1 (ALS), finding a statistically
significant deviation from proteome DBI–III scores for Ab and its pro-
tectors only (fig. S7A), despite the overlap between the aggregation mod-
ulators in the different diseases (fig. S7B).
Neurons have an expression signature that predisposes the
aggregation of Ab and tau, relative to other cell types
We next investigated whether the analysis described above is capable
of identifying the types of cells that are most vulnerable to pathological
aggregation in AD (see Methods). To address this point, we used
single-cell human mRNA sequencing data (40). By calculating the re-
lative expression of Ab and tau for neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and
endothelial cells, we found that their relative expression was elevated

 significantly in neurons (Fig. 5). Simultaneously, we found that the re-
lative expression of their aggregation protectors was the lowest and
that of their promoters was the highest. These results indicate that
neurons exhibit a cellular environment most conducive to Ab and
tau aggregation in comparison with the different brain cell types that
we analyzed in this work.
DISCUSSION
Together, our results show that brain tissues vulnerable to the pathological
protein aggregation that defines AD are characterized by an elevated ex-
pression of a specific subset of aggregation-prone proteins, as well as by
suboptimal levels of protein homeostasis components that predispose the
aggregation of Ab and tau. We have observed this expression signature
in the brains of healthy subjects at ages at which AD is rarely evident
(aged 24 to 57 years). These results indicate that the susceptibility of
specific tissues to aggregation is a feature of healthy brains, which is per-
missive for, although not necessarily causative of, disease onset. We ex-
pect additional factors to influence tissue vulnerability, including the
connectivity of tissues, because of the increasing evidence of the contri-
bution to disease progression from the cell-to-cell spreading of Ab and
tau toxic oligomers (41–43). Our findings may inspire novel therapeutic
approaches for AD, which, rather than trying to prevent a wide range of
possible triggering events, could be based on the pharmacological en-
hancement of our natural defense mechanisms that maintain our pro-
teome in a soluble state in the specific tissues where protein aggregation
may take place more readily (16, 21, 44). In summary, our results illus-
trate how the origins of variable tissue vulnerability to AD may lie within
the proteome through the identification in vulnerable tissues of an in-
trinsic expression signature associated with protein aggregation, observed
decades before the typical age of disease onset.
METHODS
Data sources
A full list of data sources for the results presented in this work is
provided in table S8.
Allen Brain Atlas data
We analyzed data from six healthy human brains from individuals aged
24 to 57 years. Samples were taken from more than 500 regions for each
hemisphere, and more than 19,700 genes were studied with multiple
probes. Microarray data were downloaded from the Allen Brain Atlas
(29). Data were downloaded from the Allen Brain Atlas on 19 December
2014. UniProt data (45) for subcellular localization and biological pro-
cess gene ontology assignments for most proteins were downloaded from
www.uniprot.org/downloadson21May2015.ProteinIDswereconverted
between UniProt and Entrez ID (used by the Allen Brain Atlas) using the
UniProt ID mapping service (table S2). With this procedure, expression
data were assigned to about 90% of the human reference proteome.
Braak staging
At progressive clinical stages of AD, conserved patterns of NFT deposi-
tion in neural tissues were observed, with increasingly large areas of the
brain affected with advancing stages. In the Braak staging of AD (11),
tissues were classified according to when, in the progression of AD,
NFTs appear in constituent neurons because NFT formation is a patho-
logical hallmark of AD and correlateswell with cell atrophy (46). In Braak
stagesIandII,NFTinvolvementisconfinedprimarilytothetransentorhinal
region of the brain. In stages III and IV, limbic regions are also affected,
with all regions of the hippocampus exhibiting AD pathology. In stages
V and VI, there is extensive neocortical involvement. Even at late stages
of AD, some regions of the brain, notably the cerebellum, remain un-
affected;weclassified these regions as “non-Braak.”Inthe originalpaper
describing the Braak staging (11), disease stages were discussed sequen-
tially, with the regions affected noted at each stage, in addition to the se-
verity of the pathology in these regions.
Mapping with the Allen Brain Atlas
To assign the brain regions from the Allen Brain Atlas to the correct
Braak stage, a rubric was developed. First, regions mentioned in the
original paper (11), which we refer to as “Braak staging” regions, were
assigned to the earliest Braak stage that they are associated with. Next,
these regions were matched to the regions characterized in the Allen
Brain Atlas. When a region in the Allen Brain Atlas was larger than a
Braak staging region, the whole of the Allen Brain Atlas region was al-
located to the corresponding Braak stage. For instance, although only two
isocortical layers were affected in Braak stage III, all isocortical tissues
were assigned to Braak stage III because isocortical expression data were
not distinguished by the layer they came from in the Allen Brain Atlas
parcellation. For this reason, when investigating the relationship be-
tween Braak staging and expression signature, “perfect-match” regions
provide the most accurate data. Perfect-match tissues have a high cor-
respondence between their Braak and Allen Brain Atlas perimeters.

 Assignments from Braak to Allen Brain Atlas regions are listed in
table S1.
Of the two main types of tissue in the brain, white matter consists
mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons, whereas gray matter has a
more diverse composition, including neuronal cell bodies, dendrites,
myelinated and unmyelinated axons, glial cells, synapses, and capillaries.
Thus, because NFTs are not found in AD in the axon hillock or initial
axon segment, one would not expect to see them in white matter in AD
(47). However, the volume of white matter does shrink in some regions
during the progression of AD, where affected neurons have their cell
bodies in gray matter and their axons in white matter. This fact implies
that NFT appearance, and thus Braak staging, may not be ideal for de-
scribing vulnerability to AD in white matter tissues. However, the effect
of this caveat on our study is limited because only 2 of the more than
500 regions studied in the Allen Brain Atlas include white matter and
is accounted for in fig. S5C.
The D score of the expression of a gene
Because the expression of a given gene in the Allen Brain Atlas is
measured by multiple probes (29), we first normalized the expres-
sion reading Ep,r for each probe p in each region r in the Allen Brain
Atlas as
E
0
p;r ¼ Ep;r � mp
sp
ð1Þ
where mp and sp are the average and SD of Ep,r across all regions,
respectively.
To quantify the variability of gene expression between tissues,
we defined a D score (fig. S1) for a given probe p over a brain re-
gion R (which is typically made up of several Allen Brain Atlas re-
gions) as

D Scores of proteins coaggregating in plaques and tangles
We calculated the D scores for two protein sets with high aggregation
propensity in AD (table S3), that is, those found to coaggregate with Ab
and tau in plaques and tangles, respectively (Fig. 1B) (23). We found the
mean DBI–III (Braak regions I to III) scores for these two subsets to be 0.3
(P = 2 × 10−4) and 0.1 (P = 2 × 10−4), respectively, whichare significantly
higher than that of the whole proteome (“Proteome”).
D Scores of proteins associated with PD
PD is a neurodegenerative disorder whose onset is characterized by the
death of dopaminergic neurons in the SNPC region (35). Lewy bodies,
protein aggregates primarily composed of a-synuclein (34), are a major
pathological hallmark of PD. The calculated mean DSNPC score for Lewy
bodies coaggregators (table S3) was 0.6 (P = 1 × 10−9) (fig. S4). We also
tested a-synuclein, finding a DSNPC score of 1.1.
D Distribution of KEGG pathways
To evaluate differential pathway expression between Braak and non-
Braak tissues for Fig. 4, we used the KEGG pathways (39). The DBI–III
scores were calculated for each KEGG pathway. The DBI–III distribution
for KEGG pathway members hand-sorted into larger groups (for in-
stance, neurotransmission; see table S7) was compared to that of the
human proteome.
Relative expression for cell types
Data were obtained from a previous mRNA sequencing study of human
brain tissue (40). To evaluate the vulnerability of different brain cell
types (Fig. 5), the relative expression was calculated for each gene within
each cell type as
E
0
g;c ¼ Eg;c � mg;c
sg;c
where Eg,c is the expression for each gene g in a given cell type c, mg,c is
the mean expression of that gene in a given cell type c, and sg,c is the
SD of expression of that gene in a given cell type c.
Calculation of the relative expression for
aggregation regulators
We undertook an unbiased literature search to identify all molecular
chaperones and posttranslational modifiers reported to affect the aggre-
gation of Ab or tau (table S4). These aggregation regulators were sorted
intothree groups:(i)proteinsthat protectagainstaggregation(protectors),
(ii) proteins that promote aggregation (promoters), and (iii) proteins
whose cumulative role on aggregation was ambiguous in the current
literature. Entrez IDs of the molecular chaperones and posttranslational
modifiers were identified and are provided in table S4 together with the
relevantreferences.Weevaluatedrelativeexpressionforproteinsingroups

Evaluation of statistical significance
To assess the differences in the distributions of D scores between various
data sets, we used the nonparametric Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney U test
(48), or a two-tailed t test (49), as specified in the figure captions.
Because of the high number of data and hypotheses tested in this study,
we adjusted the P values to reduce the false discovery rate (FDR).

 the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction to con-
trol the FDR (50) because this method allows the cost paid for the con-
trol of multiplicity to be kept relatively low. More generally, from the
analysis of the relationship between FDR, sensitivity, and study sample
size, it is known that microarray studies can be susceptible to large FDR,
which, besides measurement variability, is primarily determined by the
proportion of truly differentially expressed genes, the magnitude of the
true differences, and sample size (51, 52). Because our work relies on
3700 microarray studies (up to 900 samples from six brains), the FDR
rate analysis was performed on a relatively large sample size, allowing
for rather sensitive detection of truly differentially expressed genes. We
further increased the statistical significance of the results and avoided
a high false-negative rate by calculating the significance of the difference
of D score distributions for groups of genes. In comparison to cal-
culating the significance of the differences of D scores of individual
genes, this approach greatly reduced the number of hypotheses in our
study. These tests were performed using the SciPy and rpy2 modules for
Python.
