Abstract
Background: Although 7 million copies of Eat Right 4 Your Type have been sold in >60 languages, there has been a lack
of evidence supporting the “blood-type” diet hypothesis.
Objective: The present study aimed to examine the validity of this diet in overweight adults.
Methods: A total of 973 adults [mean ± SEM age: 44.6 ± 0.4 y; mean ± SEM body mass index (BMI; kg/m2): 32.5 ± 0.2;
758 women, 215 men] were participants of the Toronto Healthy Diet Study. A 1-mo, 196-item food-frequency question-
naire was used to determine dietary intakes before and after a 6-mo dietary intervention. Diet scores were calculated
to determine relative adherence to each of the 4 blood-type diets as a secondary analysis. ABO blood group was de-
termined by genotyping rs8176719 and rs8176746. ANCOVA was used to compare cardiometabolic risk factors across
tertiles of diet scores.
Results: At baseline, individuals with a higher adherence score to the type A diet had lower diastolic blood pressure
(tertile 3 compared with tertile 1: 70.9 ± 1.1 compared with 73.3 ± 1.1 mm Hg; P < 0.01). Lower waist circumference
was observed in individuals with higher adherence to the type B (tertile 3 compared with tertile 1: 100.8 ± 1.8 compared
with 105.4 ± 1.7 cm; P < 0.01) and type AB (tertile 3 compared with tertile 1: 101.2 ± 1.8 compared with 104.8 ± 1.7 cm;
P < 0.01) diets. After a 6-mo dietary intervention, individuals with increased adherence to the type A and type B diets
had greater reductions in BMI and waist circumference, respectively (P < 0.01). Individuals with an increase in type O
diet adherence showed decreases in both BMI and waist circumference (P < 0.01). However, matching the diets with
the corresponding ABO genotype of each individual did not change the effect size of any of these associations either at
baseline or at 6 mo.
Conclusions: ABO genotype does not modify any association between blood-type diets and biomarkers of car-
diometabolic disease in overweight adults, suggesting that the theory behind this diet is not valid This study was based
on the data of a trial that was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00516620.

Introduction
The “blood-type” diet is based on a popular book that advo-
cates eating according to one’
s blood group (1). Since the publi-
cation of Eat Right 4 Your Type (1) in 1996, >7 million copies
have been sold in >60 languages. Although popular among the
general public, the diet remains controversial due to the lack of
supporting scientific evidence.
The theory behind the blood-type diet proposes that the
ABO blood group reveals ancestral dietary habits and that ad-
herence to a diet specific to one’
s blood group can optimize
overall health and reduce the risk of cardiometabolic and other
diseases. Specifically, individuals with blood group O are consid-
ered “the hunter,” so they are advised to follow a high-animal-
protein diet. Those with type A are described as “the agrarian”
and are encouraged to follow a mostly vegetarian diet. The diet
for individuals with type B, “the nomad,” recommends high
intakes of dairy products. People with blood group AB, “the
enigma,” are advised to adhere to an intermediate diet between
the type A and type B diets (1). In addition to this general pat-
tern, each diet also recommends specific food items to eat or
avoid (Supplemental Table 1), although no rationale was pro-
vided.

 As a well-known genetic trait in humans, the ABO blood
group has been associated with differences in risk of malaria
(2); cholera (3); type 2 diabetes (4); venous thrombosis (5); and
skin (6), gastric (7, 8), pancreatic (9), and ovarian (10) cancer.
Research has also suggested that ABO blood group may modify
the relation between diet and certain metabolic pathways. For
example, a study on high-fat diets and intestinal alkaline phos-
phatase showed that individuals with blood group A not only
had the lowest phosphatase activity at baseline but also had the
lowest increase in activity after ingesting a high-fat diet (11).
Because phosphatase negatively regulates fat absorption in the
gut (12), a lower enzyme activity may explain why individuals
with blood group A had higher concentrations of serum choles-
terol (13). Current studies have shown that ABO blood group
might alter nutrient processing by modifying the metabolism
of the human gut microbiome (14). Different bacterial species
are known to have distinct binding affinities to ABO blood
group antigens (15). Such interactions may explain why indi-
viduals with the B antigen (blood groups B and AB) have a
higher diversity of Eubacterium rectale, Clostridium coccoides,
and Clostridium leptum (16). The results of these studies suggest
that ABO blood group may represent a genetic factor that can
potentially modify response to dietary intake. However, direct
evidence of interactions between diet, blood group, and clinical
outcomes remains scarce.
A current systematic review called for studies to validate the
purported health benefits of the blood-type diet (17). This was
followed by the first study, to our knowledge, to test the hypoth-
esis by using a cross-sectional study in a healthy young popu-
lation, which showed that any benefits of the blood-type diet

on cardiometabolic health are independent of an individual’
s
blood type (18). However, that study was limited by its cross-
sectional design and its young, lean, healthy population, which
may have masked the purported benefits of adhering to a blood
group–specific dietary pattern. Therefore, the objective of the
current study was to examine whether blood group modifies the
effects of dietary intervention in overweight adults at 2 different
time points. Findings from the present study will further eluci-
date whether the blood-type diet has any clinical significance,
allowing physicians, dietitians, and other health care providers
to address the potential merits of this popular diet with patients
interested in adopting it.
Methods
Study design and participants. Subjects were participants of the
Toronto Healthy Diet (THD) Study, which aimed to assess the effect of
dietary advice, food provision, or both on body weight and cardiovascu-
lar disease risk factors (19). Participants were residents of households in
Toronto that had ≥1 adult with a BMI (kg/m2) ≥25. A total of 1245 par-
ticipants with an age (mean ± SEM) of 44.6 ± 0.4 y (range: 18–82 y) and
a BMI of 32.5 ± 0.2 (range: 19.3–62.6) were recruited between January
2005 and July 2009. Among the total number of participants recruited,
919 were randomly assigned to receive Health Canada’
s Food Guide
(control) or 1 of 3 interventions: 1) dietary advice consistent with both
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and dietary portfo-
lio principle, 2) weekly food provision reflecting this advice, or 3) food
delivery plus advice. The details of these interventions can be found as
previously reported (19). A total of 685 participants completed the in-
tervention after 6 mo. Participants completed an FFQ both at baseline
and 6 mo after the dietary intervention.
For the current study involving the blood-type diet analysis, partici-
pants from the THD cohort were excluded if they had missing data for
dietary intake, biomarkers of interest, or ABO genotype. After exclu-
sions, 973 out of 1245 participants remained at baseline, and 576 out
of 685 participants who completed the intervention remained at 6 mo.
The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committees
at the University of Toronto and St. Michael’
s Hospital, and all par-
ticipants provided written informed consent. The study is registered at
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00516620).
Dietary adherence score assessment. Dietary intakes at base-
line and 6 mo after the dietary intervention were assessed by a 1-mo,
196-item Toronto-modified Willett semiquantitative FFQ, as described
previously (20). Each participant was given instructions on how to com-
plete the FFQ with the use of visual aids of portion sizes to improve the
measurement of self-reported food intake over the previous month. We
quantified the adherence to each of the 4 blood-type diets as previously

described (18). As a secondary outcome of the clinical trial, 4 different
diet scores were calculated for each participant, regardless of his or her
own blood group. On the basis of the food items listed in the blood-
type diet book (1), participants received 1 positive point for consuming
1 serving of each recommended food item and 1 negative point for con-
suming 1 serving of an item on the list of foods to avoid. Foods that are
listed as “neutral” were not included in the equation and did not con-
tribute to the final score. The lists of recommended foods to eat or avoid
for each ABO blood group are shown in Supplemental Table 1. Several
food items in the FFQ table, such as cold cereal, contain a variety of
ingredients that might be listed as either to avoid or as beneficial in the
blood-type diet. A neutral score was assigned to such food categories, so
their consumption would not affect the adherence score. All processed
foods, such as hotdogs, are listed as “to avoid,” because the blood-type
diet advises against the consumption of all such foods. Participants were
then grouped into tertiles on the basis of their scores for each diet, with
the top tertile representing those whose diet most closely resembled the
corresponding blood-type diet.
Cardiometabolic
risk
factor
assessment. Anthropometric
measurements including height, weight, blood pressure, and waist cir-
cumference were determined as previously described (21). BMI was cal-
culated, and physical activity was measured by questionnaire and ex-
pressed as metabolic equivalent hours per week (22). Overnight 12-h
fasting blood samples were collected to measure serum biomarkers of
cardiometabolic disease, including glucose, TGs, and total, HDL, and
LDL cholesterol, with the use of methods described previously (20).
ABO genotype identification. Sequenom’
s MassARRAY multi-
plex method was used to determine the blood group of study par-
ticipants by genotyping 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs;
rs8176719Del→G; rs8176746A→C) in the ABO gene. Genotyping of
these 2 SNPs has been shown to be a reliable way to determine an
individual’
s ABO blood group (23–25). The rs8176719 SNP indicates
O-allele–specific 261delG, whereas rs8176746 determines the galactose
specificity of the encoded A/B transferases and thus the expression of A
and B antigens on erythrocytes (26).
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with the
use of SAS software program, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc.). The α
error was set at 0.05, and reported P-values are 2-sided. Variables that
were not normally distributed were either loge or square root trans-
formed before analysis, and the mean ± SE values are given without
transformation to facilitate interpretation. Participant characteristics
were compared across ABO blood groups with the use of ANOVA. AN-
COVA was used to compare means of biomarkers of cardiometabolic
disease risk across tertiles of diet scores at baseline. Age, sex, ethnicity,
energy intake, physical activity, and smoking were included as covariates
in the ANCOVA model. Multiple comparisons based on the total num-
ber of biomarkers (n = 10) were accounted for with the use of a Bon-
ferroni correction. When a significant effect was observed (P < 0.005),
we further compared the differences between biomarkers in each of the
tertiles of diet score with the use of the Tukey-Kramer test for pairwise
comparisons. With regard to the results after 6 mo of dietary interven-
tion, changes in diet scores and biomarkers were calculated by subtract-
ing the baseline values from the values at 6 mo. ANCOVA with the same
covariates listed earlier was used to compare changes in the biomark-
ers across changes in diet scores. To determine whether matching each
blood-type diet to the corresponding blood group was associated with
a more favorable biomarker profile, we stratified the entire population
into 2 groups: one with the matched blood group for the diet and the
other unmatched. For example, with the type A diet, we compared indi-
viduals with blood group A with those with blood groups B, AB, and O.
“Matching status”was created as a new binary variable in the statistical
model to examine the interaction between diet score and the matching
status on each cardiometabolic disease risk factor for each blood-type
diet at both baseline and after 6 mo of the dietary intervention.
Results
Participant characteristics based on the ABO blood group at
baseline are summarized in Table 1. ABO blood group was
significantly associated with serum total and LDL cholesterol
(P < 0.05). When comparing between individual blood groups,
no significant difference was found for LDL cholesterol, but in-
dividuals with blood group O had significantly lower serum to-
tal cholesterol than did those in group AB. However, this dif-
ference was not observed after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity,
energy intake, physical activity, and smoking.
Mean values of cardiometabolic disease risk factors at base-
line across tertiles of each blood-type diet score are shown in
Table 2. Individuals with higher adherence scores to the type
A diet had lower diastolic blood pressure (tertile 3 compared
with tertile 1: 70.9 ± 1.1 compared with 73.3 ± 1.1 mm Hg;

1ANCOVA adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, energy intake, physical activity, and smok-

adherence on values of cardiometabolic risk factors. The Bonferroni procedure was
used to adjust for multiple comparisons (P < 0.005). ABO, ABO gene.
P < 0.01) regardless of ABO blood group status. Individuals
with higher adherence to the type B diet had lower waist cir-
cumference (tertile 3 compared with tertile 1: 100.8 ± 1.8 com-
pared with 105.4 ± 1.7 cm; P < 0.01). Individuals with higher
adherence to the type AB diets also had lower waist circumfer-
ence (tertile 3 compared with tertile 1: 101.2 ± 1.8 compared
with 104.8 ± 1.7 cm; P < 0.01). No significant association was
found for the type O diet. All associations were adjusted for age,
sex, ethnicity, energy intake, physical activity, and smoking.
To examine whether matching each blood-type diet to the
corresponding blood group modifies the effect on the biomarker
profile at baseline, we further stratified the population on the ba-
sis of matched and unmatched ABO blood groups. For example,
with the type A diet, we compared individuals with blood group
A with those with blood groups B, AB, and O. Table 3 summa-
rizes the P values for comparisons for each blood-type diet. The
exact values of such comparisons are shown in Supplemental
Tables 2–5. The results show that ABO blood group did not
modify the association between blood-type diet adherence and
cardiometabolic risk factors at baseline.
The validity of the blood-type diet was then examined af-
ter the 6-mo intervention. Participants had improved their diet
adherence with a mean (±SEM) score increase of 10.2 ± 0.8
for the type A diet, 6.7 ± 0.7 for the type B diet, 7.4 ± 0.6 for
the type AB diet, and 6.9 ± 0.7 for the type O diet. Figure 1
shows the distribution of score changes for each blood-type
diet. The average changes in cardiometabolic risk factors based
on changes in diet adherence scores are shown in Table 4. In-
dividuals with increased diet adherence score for the type A
diet had greater reductions in BMI (tertile 3 compared with
tertile 1: −0.6 ± 0.2 compared with 0 ± 0.2; P < 0.01). In-
dividuals with improved type B diet adherence had further re-
ductions in waist circumference (tertile 3 compared with ter-
tile 1: −0.7 ± 0.8 compared with 1.2 ± 0.8 cm; P < 0.01).
Individuals with increased type O diet score showed decreases
in both BMI (tertile 3 compared with tertile 1: −0.6 ± 0.2
compared with 0.1 ± 0.2; P < 0.01) and waist circumference
(tertile 3 compared with tertile 1: −1.3 ± 0.8 compared with
0.8 ± 0.8 cm; P < 0.01). No significant association was found
for the type AB diet.When comparing these biomarkers between
the matched blood group and the unmatched group, no signif-
icant interactions between changes in diet score and matching
ABO genotype and “blood-type” diet

Discussion
Our findings show that adherence to the blood-type diet is as-
sociated with favorable profiles of certain cardiometabolic risk
factors both at baseline and after improved dietary adherence
after a 6-mo dietary intervention in an overweight population.
However, these beneficial effects were independent of an indi-
vidual’
s ABO genotype. The present study is the first, to our
knowledge, to examine whether ABO blood group modifies di-
etary effects in overweight adults undergoing a dietary interven-
tion, and the results provide further evidence that an individual’
s
ABO blood group does not modify the association of the blood-
type diet and biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease.
The baseline results of the present study are consistent with
the findings of a previous cross-sectional study (18), in which
adherence to the blood-type diet was associated with a favor-
able cardiometabolic risk profile in a young, healthy population,
but in an ABO-independent manner. These ABO-independent
relations were further shown by the results after 6 mo of a di-
etary intervention in the current study. After receiving healthy
food items, dietary counseling, or both, participants, on aver-
age, improved their adherence scores for all 4 blood-type di-
ets. Such increases in adherence scores were associated with fa-
vorable changes in certain cardiometabolic risk factors. These
health-promoting effects are not unexpected, because all 4 of
the blood-type diets are generally prudent diets that recommend
a high consumption of fruit and vegetables and avoidance of
processed foods. Such dietary patterns have been recommended
by various health agencies due to their protective effects on
cardiometabolic diseases (27, 28). However, no significant in-
teractions were observed between diet scores and blood group
matching status for any risk factors either at baseline or after
a 6-mo dietary intervention, suggesting that ABO blood group
does not modify the association between blood-type diet adher-
ence and cardiometabolic risk factors.
The findings of the present study provide further evidence
against the claims made in the blood-type diet book. Despite
its popularity and bold health claims, research on the valid-
ity of this diet has only recently been conducted. A systematic
review published in 2013 found no scientific evidence to sup-
port the proposed benefits of the blood-type diet and called
for studies to validate its health claims (17). The first primary
research investigating the blood-type diet was published in 2014
and showed that although the diets may confer certain car-
diometabolic health benefits, these benefits were independent of
an individual’
s ABO blood group (18). However, that study was
cross-sectional and consisted of a young and ostensibly healthy
population, which may have masked the purported benefits of
adhering to a blood group–specific dietary pattern. In compar-
ison, the present study included 2 time points, which allowed
tracking of an individual’
s dietary adherence. It also involved an
overweight and older population. Previous research has shown
that diet has a significant health impact in obese individuals
(29, 30). Diet can be an effective strategy in weight-loss man-
agement (31) and risk reduction of cardiovascular disease (32).
This is consistent with the results of the current study, in which
individuals showed improvements in cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors after 6 mo of a dietary intervention. However, the findings
showed that ABO blood group did not modify the association
between the diet and biomarkers to any extent, even in a health-
compromised population.
As one of the earliest and probably most well-known genetic
traits identified in modern medicine (33), ABO blood group
has been investigated as a possible genetic trait that confers ad-
vantage over human diseases. Although certain observational
studies have shown that individuals with certain blood groups
might be at increased risk of different diseases (2–10), there have
been no studies, to our knowledge, showing that an individual’
s
blood group could modify the effects of diet on any disease. The
lack of association between ABO blood group, diet, and disease
risk is not surprising. Physiologically, RBCs are not involved
in diet digestion, absorption, or metabolism. Although certain
observational studies have shown that ABO blood group may
be associated with different concentrations of intestinal phos-
phatase (11) and different compositions of gut microbiome (16),
these studies did not measure any meaningful clinical outcomes.
Therefore, the current literature has provided no scientific basis
for the blood-type diet to date. Any nonscientific extrapolation
on this issue is beyond the scope of this epidemiologic study.
The present study has some limitations. The use of FFQs for
dietary assessment could result in some measurement error and
cannot give a precise estimate of the absolute intake of food
items. However, an FFQ is considered a valid instrument for
providing relative estimates of food intake in large populations
(34). Although the 196-item FFQ does not contain all the items
mentioned in the blood-type diet, which lists frogs, turtles, squir-
rels, and other exotic animal food products, the tool does cap-
ture major foods that are commonly consumed in North Amer-
ica and its results have been validated against other dietary as-
sessment methods (35, 36). The FFQ includes several food items
that contain a variety of ingredients or are considered processed
in nature, which are not listed in Eat Right 4 Your Type; how-
ever, consuming any of these foods would not increase the diet
adherence score, because a neutral or negative score was as-
signed in these cases. By assigning points on the basis of quantity
of consumption for each specific food item, our scoring system
is continuously scaled and normally distributed. Furthermore,
despite examining the diet at 2 different time points, the current
study is not a longitudinal study. However, the current study is
the only one available that examined the association between
blood group, change in dietary pattern, and health risks. Al-
though the intervention was not designed specifically to increase
adherence to any of the blood-type diets, the average adherence
score for each of the diets did change. For some people, their
adherence to a particular diet increased, whereas their adher-
ence to other diets decreased. This natural experiment enabled

 us to test whether changes in any of the blood-type diet scores
were associated with improved cardiometabolic outcomes. The
derived results suggest that individuals, regardless of having the
matched blood group or not, benefited to the same extent from
adhering to a certain blood-type diet. This may explain anec-
dotal evidence showing improvements after a blood-type diet.
Evidence to the contrary would require an individual attempt-
ing to adhere to one of the blood-type diets that differs from
their own blood group, which is not likely to be attempted.
In summary, the present study is the first analysis that used
data from a clinical trial to test the validity of the blood-type diet
in overweight or obese adults. The findings showed that high ad-
herence to certain blood-type diets and increases in adherence
in general were both associated with favorable cardiometabolic
disease risk profiles. These improvements may explain anecdo-
tal evidence supporting these diets, which are generally prudent
diets on their own. However, the observed associations were in-
dependent of ABO blood group.
