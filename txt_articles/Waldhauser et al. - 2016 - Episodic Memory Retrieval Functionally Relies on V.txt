Episodic memory retrieval is assumed to rely on the rapid reactivation of sensory information that was present during encoding, a
process termed “ecphory.” We investigated the functional relevance of this scarcely understood process in two experiments in human

Introduction
Perceived information can reverberate with stored memory
traces (Tulving et al., 1983). This fast and involuntary process is
considered a decisive ingredient for the “mental time travel” im-
plied in episodic memory retrieval, reinstating sensory features of
study episodes and biasing subsequent retrieval processes leading
to the experience of recollection (Tulving, 1983; Tulving et al.,
1983). This fundamental memory mechanism, termed “ec-
phory,” has long been described phenomenologically and studied
behaviorally (Semon, 1911; Tulving, 1976; 1982). Neurophysio-
logical evidence for such fast reinstatement processes has not
emerged until recently (Waldhauser et al., 2012; Wimber et al.,
2012; Jafarpour et al., 2014). Using electrophysiological methods,
these recent studies show that a reactivation of sensory memory
traces can occur very rapidly, within 500 ms after onset of a re-
trieval cue. However, whether this early reactivation process
functionally drives episodic memory retrieval, as assumed in the
theoretical idea of ecphory, remains unclear. We used a visual-
half field paradigm to identify the oscillatory signature of early
reactivation (Experiment 1) and, moreover, to show that ec-
phoric reactivation is functionally relevant for episodic memory
retrieval (Experiment 2).
Retrieval from episodic memory leads to a reactivation of sen-
sory memory traces in the hemisphere contralateral to the visual

Significance Statement
Remembering personal experiences requires a “mental time travel” to revisit sensory information perceived in the past. This
process is typically described as a controlled, relatively slow process. However, by using electroencephalography to measure
neural activity with a high time resolution, we show that such episodic retrieval entails a very rapid reactivation of sensory brain
areas.Usingtranscranialmagneticstimulationtoalterbrainfunctionduringretrievalrevealedthatthisearlysensoryreactivation
is causally relevant for conscious remembering. These results give first neural evidence for a functional, preconscious component
of episodic remembering. This provides new insight into the nature of human memory and may help in the understanding of
psychiatric conditions that involve the automatic intrusion of unwanted memories.

 field of initial presentation (Slotnick and Schacter, 2006; Wald-
hauser et al., 2012). We made use of this principle to track the
rapid reactivation of individual memory representations, mea-
suring and modulating brain oscillatory activity by means of
electroencephalography (EEG, Experiment 1) and rhythmic
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, Experiment 2). Partic-
ipants were engaged in instructed or noninstructed encoding of
everyday objects presented either in the left or right visual field
(LVF/RVF; see Fig. 1). In a subsequent retrieval task, memory
cues were presented at the center of the screen and participants
engaged in item recognition followed by a source memory task.
Source memory was examined to test for the ability to retrieve
contextual details of the study episode, which is considered a
hallmark of episodic memory (Tulving, 1983).
Previous studies were able to localize memory reactivation
effects during retrieval to lateralized visual cortical areas active
during encoding (Gratton, 1998; Slotnick, 2004; Slotnick and
Schacter, 2006) and investigated the timing of lateral reactivation
in terms of event-related potential effects (Gratton, 1998; Slot-
nick and Schacter, 2010). However, it still remains unclear
whether and how rapid visual cortical reactivation is causally
relevant to explicit episodic memory (Slotnick and Schacter,
2010; Thakral et al., 2013), leaving a fundamental question of
memory theory unanswered. To shed light on these questions, we
investigated brain oscillations as a highly sensitive, physiologi-
cally relevant measure of cortical activity. Following recent ideas
(Hanslmayr et al., 2012), a desynchronization of oscillatory
power in the �/� frequency bands indicates an increase in the
complexity of firing patterns, thereby allowing for higher infor-
mation coding capacity during memory encoding and retrieval.
Thus, we expected a specific decrease of �/� oscillations in the
brain hemisphere contralateral to the visual field of encoding as a
marker of memory reactivation. In line with the theoretical no-
tion of ecphory, this �/� power decrease was hypothesized to
occur very rapidly (i.e., within 500 ms) (Tulving et al., 1983;
Waldhauser et al., 2012; Jafarpour et al., 2014), before the occur-
rence of signatures of recollection and controlled retrieval pro-
cesses (Rugg and Curran, 2007). Applying rTMS at the neural
sources, in the time range, and with a frequency as identified in
the first experiment was expected to counteract the rapid reacti-
vation of visual cortical areas and lead to disrupt source memory
performance. This would give strong evidence for the functional
relevance of ecphoric processes for episodic remembering.
Materials and Methods
Materials and procedure
Materials, behavioral task, trial timing, and basic procedure were identi-
cal for Experiments 1 and 2 (see Fig. 1). The study was approved by the
Ethical Review Board at the University of Konstanz.
Stimulus material. A total of 240 everyday objects (Rossion and Pour-
tois, 2004) were used in each experiment. Half of these items were pre-
sented during encoding, serving as old items during retrieval. Objects
subtended a visual angle of 5.6° � 4° and were presented to the left or
right visual field (LVF/RVF), 4° below and 6° lateral from central fixation.
Items were preselected into 8 sets, so that semantic categories of the
depicted objects, frequency of occurrence, vividness, visibility, and ori-
entation (portrait vs landscape) were balanced across conditions.
Procedure. The experiment was performed in two blocks, pertaining to
the two encoding conditions (instructed and noninstructed encoding).
Each block comprised the encoding phase, a distracter task, and a final
retrieval phase. In the noninstructed encoding condition, participants
were supposed to engage in judging the size of each object. In the inten-
tional encoding condition, subjects were simply instructed to intention-
ally encode each object the best they could for later retrieval. During
encoding, participants responded with the index and middle finger of the
right hand whether an item was larger or smaller than a shoebox or
whether the item was easy or difficult to encode. Allocation of response
buttons to index or middle finger was counterbalanced across subjects.
The encoding phase was followed by a 3 min distracter task to prevent
selective rehearsal, consisting of counting backwards aloud from a three
digit number in steps of three. During the subsequent retrieval task, 60
encoded items were presented at the center of the screen as old items
together with the same amount of new items. Participants were in-
structed to first engage in an old/new recognition test and subsequently
tested for source memory, indicating whether an item was presented to
the left or right visual field during encoding. Participants responded with
the index and middle finger of the right hand whether an item was old or
new and whether the item was endorsed as old, whether the item was
initially presented to right or left of fixation. Allocation of response but-
tons to index or middle finger was counterbalanced across subjects in the
old/new task, but the middle finger was always used to indicate source
endorsement to the RVF and the index finger was used to indicate LVF
presentation. Succession of encoding conditions, old/new status of items,

Experimental procedure for Experiments 1 and 2. Pictures of everyday objects were presented to the left or right of fixation at encoding, followed by a response task according to
encoding condition (instructed vs noninstructed). Instructed encoding required participants to intentionally encode the presented object and to judge the difficulty to do so. For noninstructed
encoding, participants were requested to estimate whether or not the depicted object would fit into a shoebox. During retrieval, all previously shown old items were presented together with the

 and presentation of the old items to the left or right visual field during
encoding were counterbalanced across subjects.
Presentation of items within encoding phases was randomized so that
each VF condition was followed by an item from the same or opposite VF
condition with equal probability and under the constraint that the same
VF could occur twice in a row. During retrieval, the sequence of items
encoded in the left and right VF was also randomized under the same
constraint (no more than two items from the same VF condition in a
row). Additionally, old items were randomly intermixed with new items
so that no more than four old or new items could occur in a row.
Analysis of behavioral data. Behavioral data during the final memory
test were analyzed based on (1) hits (i.e., the number of correctly identi-
fied old items) and (2) source hits (i.e., the number of hits for which VF
of presentation was correctly identified in addition to correct item rec-
ognition). Number of hits and source hits were each divided by the
number of all old items for each subject. Arguably, dividing the number
of source hits by the number of hits would give a cleaner measure of pure
source memory performance in addition to simple item recognition.
However, we assumed that source memory performance is already con-
strained by item memory performance in our case, so that a “new” re-
sponse to an old item (i.e., miss) prevents a correct source memory
judgment, as only an “old” response prompts a subsequent source mem-
ory task. In addition, item recognition performance may already be bi-
ased by source memory demands so that only items are endorsed as hits
if a correct source memory judgment can be made. As a consequence of
our calculation method, source hit rates may appear rather low. Chance
level for source hits is �50% because the probability to endorse an item
as being presented in the LVF or RVF already depends on the probability
to endorse an item as old or new (for detailed discussion, see, e.g., Cyco-
wicz et al., 2001; Batchelder and Riefer, 1990). In addition to the different
types of hits, we report false alarms (new items that were incorrectly
classified as old). For Experiment 2, we also investigated source false
alarms (new items that were incorrectly endorsed as old and for which a
source memory judgment was given). This analysis was conducted to
determine whether rTMS affects the tendency to misattribute a new item
to the VF contralateral or ipsilateral of stimulation. Behavioral data were
analyzed in uncorrected repeated-measures ANOVAs or uncorrected
two-sided paired t tests.
Experiment 1
Participants. Sixteen right-handed (Oldfield, 1971) subjects (11 female)
with a mean age of 24 years (range 21–37 years), normal or corrected-to-
normal vision, and no history of neurological of psychiatric disease par-
ticipated in this study. Participants received course credit or a monetary
reward of 20 € for participating in the experiment. Informed consent was
acquired from each participant before the experiment.
Data analysis. EEG was recorded using equidistant 128 Ag/AgCl scalp
electrodes (DC-100 Hz, 512 Hz sampling rate) referenced to common
average. A time-frequency representation of the EEG signal (1–30 Hz)
was derived by means of Morlet wavelets (width 5). Because we had no
hypotheses concerning the different encoding tasks and because no sta-
tistical differences between encoding tasks were obtained (see Results;
Table 1), EEG power was collapsed across encoding tasks. To quantify
event-related signal changes on sensor level, poststimulus power change
was calculated in relation to a prestimulus baseline period (�500 to 0 ms)
for both encoding and retrieval phases. No significant electrode clusters
emerged between conditions in the baseline interval in a fieldtrip cluster
statistic calculated at all electrodes for the frequency ranges of interest
during encoding and retrieval.
To identify time windows and the frequency range of interest, EEG
power during encoding was first compared between LVF and RVF con-
ditions in a sliding-time window fieldtrip cluster statistic (Maris and
Oostenveld, 2007). Here, we continuously applied cluster statistics for
time and frequency windows of 200 ms and 2 Hz in steps of 100 ms and
1 Hz to the data from 1 to 30 Hz and from 0 to 1500 ms (Staudigl and
Hanslmayr, 2013). Following our hypotheses, we directly compared pos-
terior electrodes over the respective hemisphere contralateral to the VF of
presentation between LVF and RVF conditions. We did so by inverting
EEG power values in the RVF condition for each time and frequency
point at left-hemispheric parieto-occipital sensors through multiplica-
tion with �1. Then, we compared the result in each time-frequency
window with the corresponding (noninverted) power values at right-
hemispheric sensors for the LVF condition. Each cluster statistic then
reveals whether there is a contralateral power decrease, with the highest
likelihood of significant effects if there is a strong contralateral decrease
in both LVF and RVF conditions. To correct for multiple comparisons,
the resulting 630 p values were adjusted following the false discovery rate
procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Benjamini and Yekutieli,
2001). The result of this analysis indicated electrode clusters yielding
significant EEG power differences between LVF and RVF conditions over
the respective contralateral hemispheres in the alpha/ lower beta range
(8–20 Hz), most prominent between 200 and 700 ms after stimulus
presentation (see Fig. 3A, top).
However, the sliding cluster analyses can only suggest the presence of
a statistical difference between VF conditions at the contralateral hemi-
spheres, but it is not able to reliably show the actual topographical clus-
ters that differ between VF conditions and to take into account ipsilateral
and contralateral sensors. To this end, we subtracted noninverted data in
the RVF from the LVF condition and calculated a fieldtrip cluster statistic
in the time (200–700 ms) and frequency (8–20 Hz) window suggested by
the sliding analysis, allowing us to identify significant electrode clusters
in each hemisphere (see Fig. 3A, middle). The mean EEG power at these
clusters interacted significantly between VF (LVF/RVF) and left and right
brain hemispheres (LH/RH; see Fig. 3A, bottom), as indicated by a two-
way ANOVA.
To investigate lateralized activity during retrieval, EEG power differ-
ences between contralateral and ipsilateral electrode clusters identified
during encoding were averaged over LVF and RVF conditions and com-
pared over time in a frequency range between 1 and 30 Hz. Results were
masked by the results of running Wilcoxon signed-rank test applied at
each time (�50 ms) and frequency (�0.5 Hz) bin resulting from the
Morlet wavelet time-frequency transformation. Because our hypotheses
were concerned with rapid contralateral decreases in �/� power, we fo-
cused on early (�500 ms) interaction effects as indicators for ecphoric
processes. Negative values in Figure 3B (top) indicate uncorrected signif-
icant (p � 0.05) differences between contralateral � ipsilateral elec-
trodes collapsed across both VF conditions. Based on the results of this
exploratory analysis, the interaction between VF (LVF/RVF) and left and
right brain hemispheres was tested in an uncorrected two-way repeated-
measures ANOVA taking into account mean EEG power (10–25 Hz,
100–200 ms) at the LH/RH clusters identified during encoding (see Fig.
3B, bottom, for mean power depending on condition and hemisphere
and Fig. 3B, middle, for topographical distribution of mean EEG power).
To shed light on hemisphere specificity of these effects (see Fig. 4), addi-
tional two-sided t tests were performed in the 100–200 ms time window,
comparing LVF-RVF differences in the hemisphere-specific peak fre-
quencies at the LH and RH electrode clusters.
To test whether reinstatement strength reflecting in a contralateral �/�
power decrease is linked to behavioral performance, we compared the
amount of lateralization between source hits and source misses in a two-
sided t test. Lateralization was defined as the mean difference between the
contralateral � ipsilateral electrode clusters in the 10–25 Hz frequency
band from 100 to 200 ms. We expected lateralization to be more negative
for source hits than source misses. In a second step, we also investigated
whether single trials could be identified as source hits and source misses
(i.e., hits that were incorrectly attributed to the VF opposite to the VF of
actual presentation) based on the amount of contralateral � ipsilateral
lateralization at the electrode clusters in the 10–25 Hz frequency band by
means of a contingency table (Table 2). In this approach, EEG signals
were not baseline corrected to avoid misclassification of trials due to
potentially higher baseline noise in nonaveraged single trials. Instead, a
lateralization index was estimated for each trial by correcting for the total
power at the contralateral and ipsilateral electrodes (lateralization in-
dex � contralateral � ipsilateral/contralateral � ipsilateral) (compare
Ha
¨ndel et al., 2011). A lateralization index �0 signifies a trial as having a
relative power decrease at contralateral electrodes. We hypothesized that
such trials would be classified as source hits with a frequency above
chance, whereas trials with a lateralization index �0 would more often be

 classified as source misses. We tested this assumption by means of a � 2
test for all trials from all participants (i.e., fixed-effects analysis). To make
the data more accessible, we also report classification performance in
percentage ((correctly classified source hits � correctly classified source
misses)/all items) � 100). In addition, we also tested whether the mean
differences between observed cell frequencies and expected cell frequen-
cies in � 2 tests across all participants were significantly different from
zero on the group level by means of a one-sample t test (i.e., random-
effects analysis).
To identify sources of oscillatory activity, we used the Dynamic Imag-
ing of Coherent Sources beam-forming approach after calculating the
cross-spectral density matrix. We used individual electrode positions as
acquired with a sensor digitization tool (Xensor; www.ant-neuro.com)
and the FieldTrip standard MRI. Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources
constructs adaptive spatial filters to localize power for each grid point in
the entire brain (Gross et al., 2001; Gross et al., 2003). For each individual
and the time periods of interest during encoding and retrieval, filters
were calculated using activity following the encoding stimulus and the
recognition cue, respectively, and baseline periods corresponding to the
length of the poststimulus period of interest (Dalal et al., 2008), including
the trials from both LVF and RVF conditions. For encoding data, a base-
line period from �500 to 0 ms and poststimulus period from 200 to 700
ms were chosen. For retrieval data, a baseline period of �100 to 0 ms and
a poststimulus period of 100 to 200 ms were chosen. Cross-spectral den-
sity and source power were estimated using frequency analysis with Sle-
pian multitapers as implemented in FieldTrip (Oostenveld et al., 2011)
for the frequency range observed at sensor level (i.e., 8–20 Hz for encod-
ing and 10–25 Hz for retrieval). The resulting average source estimate for
each condition in the time intervals of interest was corrected for source
activity in the baseline interval and subsequently statistically compared
with the other condition and interpolated to the standard MNI brain. In
a final step, we aimed at identifying the voxels that differentiated with
most sensitivity between conditions across both hemispheres. To this
end, we statistically compared the RVF-LVF power difference in the right
hemisphere with the corresponding effect in the left hemisphere in a
one-sided FieldTrip source cluster statistic. This was done again for both
encoding and retrieval effects. The results were again interpolated to the
standard MNI brain (see Fig. 5). The obtained maximum interhemi-
spheric difference between conditions during retrieval was determined at
MNI coordinates �40, �78, 0. Source localization results were visualized
using the Caret software (http://brainvis.wustl.edu).
Experiment 2
Participants. Twenty-four right-handed subjects (14 female) with a mean
age of 23 years (range 18–27 years) and normal or corrected-to-normal
vision completed the experiment. In addition to a general assessment of
history of neurological and psychiatric disease and medication, an addi-
tional TMS screening was conducted before the experiment (Rossi et al.,
2011). Furthermore, a detailed explanation of the TMS method and its
risks was provided for the subjects (Rossi et al., 2009). Informed consent
was acquired from each participant before the experiment. One partici-
pant was excluded before the start of the study due to unclear status of
inner ear damage, and one further person aborted the experiment be-
cause of neck pain during phosphene stimulation. Participants received
course credit or a monetary reward of 20 € for participating in the exper-
iment and an extra 10 € for taking part in structural MRI assessment.
Procedure. Behavioral task and procedure were almost identical to
Experiment 1. Stimulation conditions were applied in a within-subject
fashion during the retrieval phase of both blocks. This required pausing
the procedure every 40 trials to relocate the coil between the hemispheres
and change the tilt of the coil according to TMS and sham conditions.
Old, new, LVF, and RVF items were equally distributed between these
segments of 40 trials. Four subjects received only 36 trials per stimulation
block due to experimental error, but counterbalancing and matching of
condition and stimulus material were preserved. rTMS was applied to the
right and left hemisphere during each of the two retrieval phases. Sham
was applied to only one hemisphere during a particular retrieval block to
keep the blocks at reasonable size and length. Succession of rTMS and
Sham conditions was counterbalanced across subjects so that stimulation
conditions and hemispheres were equally often followed and preceded by
the other conditions.
TMS was applied with a Magstim Rapid 2 Transcranial Magnetic Stim-
ulator via a Magstim figure-of-eight coil. At the beginning of an experi-
mental session, phosphene threshold (PT) was identified in each subject,
using the modified binary search procedure (Tyrrell and Owens, 1988;
Anderson and Johnson, 2006; Romei et al., 2010). To this end, subjects
were blindfolded and single TMS pulses were applied with the coil cen-
tered midline 2 cm above the inion. Participants had to indicate the
presence or absence of a phosphene by answering “yes” or “no.” PT is
defined as the percentage of maximum stimulator output above which
subjects consistently report seeing phosphenes. PT served as an individ-
ual marker of cortical excitability and was used to determine stimulator
output during the experiment. rTMS was applied with 90% PT output,
which corresponded to a mean stimulator output of 61.3% (SD 7.44%).
If no reliable PT could be determined (n � 3), a fixed stimulator output
of 60% was used (Romei et al., 2010). No participant reported perception
of phosphenes during the experiment.
To deliver magnetic pulses with high anatomical precision, rTMS was
guided by a neuronavigation system, which coregisters the indivi-
dual MRI with the position of the TMS coil using a 3D tracking device
(ANTVisor; www.ant-neuro.com). Individual high-resolution T1-
weighted MRIs were acquired from a Siemens Skyra 3 T scanner (flip
angle � 7°; TR � 2500 ms; TE � 4.06 ms) or based on other structural
MRI scans from various sources if already existing for the participant.
Maximum magnetic field strength was applied to the neural source of
�/� oscillatory decreases in the lateral occipital cortex as identified dur-
ing retrieval in Experiment 1 (MNI coordinates: �40, �78, 0). Four TMS
pulses were applied with a duration of 57 ms between pulses, with appli-
cation starting at 33.5 ms and lasting until 204.5 ms after cue presenta-
tion, corresponding to a frequency of 17.5 Hz (see Fig. 6A).
Sham was applied by tilting the TMS coil in an angle of �60° away
from the scalp surface but still touching the head. Thereby, participants
still experienced clicking noise and slight vibrating sensation at the scalp
surface (Sauseng et al., 2009).
Results
Episodic memory retrieval is accompanied by a rapid decrease
of �/� oscillatory power
In Experiment 1 (Fig. 1), high-density EEG was measured during
encoding and retrieval to reveal the oscillatory signature of mem-
ory reactivation. In a first step, we aimed at identifying encoding-
related lateralized brain activity. On a behavioral level, no
difference between encoding tasks (instructed vs noninstructed)
or visual field conditions (LVF vs RVF) were obtained, on either
item recognition or on source memory performance (all t(15) �
1.361, p � 0.05; Table 1). In addition, there was no difference
between blocks determined by encoding conditions in terms of
false alarm rates (t(15) � 1.156, p � 0.266; instructed: mean � SD,
11.6 � 8.91%; noninstructed: 14.1 � 8.65%). This allowed us to
collapse the EEG data across encoding instructions to enhance

 signal-to-noise ratio and to directly compare VF conditions on a
neural level. We compared EEG activity between RVF and LVF
conditions at the respective left- or right-hemispheric posterior
contralateral electrodes in a sliding cluster statistic (see Materials
and Methods; Fig. 2) to isolate the time and frequency windows
most sensitive to the expected contralateral power decreases at
encoding. This was achieved by inverting power values for the
RVF condition at the left-hemispheric electrodes and comparing
them with power at right-hemispheric electrodes for the LVF
condition. This analysis indicated maximum power differences at
contralateral electrodes between the VF conditions from 200–
700 ms in the �/� range (8–20 Hz, padj � 0.05, FDR corrected;
Fig. 3A, top) (Genovese et al., 2002). Although this result pin-
pointed the time and frequency range of lateral differences be-
tween VF conditions, the analysis could neither indicate whether
the effect is stronger on contralateral than ipsilateral electrodes
nor answer exactly which electrodes are most sensitive to hemi-
sphere and VF-specific effects. Thus, we subtracted power in the
LVF condition from power in the RVF condition in the identified
time-frequency range, such that positive values reflect a stronger
�/� power decrease in the RVF condition, whereas negative val-
ues reflect a power decrease in the LVF condition (Fig. 3A, mid-
dle). We calculated a cluster statistic on all electrodes to identify
the clusters most sensitive to VF specific decreases (Maris and
Oostenveld, 2007). In line with our hypothesis, this analysis re-
vealed one left-hemispheric and one right-hemispheric electrode
cluster (left: p � 0.038; right: p � 0.006), each most sensitive to a
power decrease in the contralateral VF (Fig. 3A, middle). This
VF � Hemisphere interaction was supplemented by a two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA taking into account mean power at
the identified electrode clusters (F(1,15) � 62.039, p � 0.001),
suggesting a significant power decrease at contralateral electrodes
differing from ipsilateral activity for each VF condition (see Fig.
3A, bottom). Finally, we conducted a beamformer source analysis
of the 8–20 Hz �/� oscillatory activity between 200 and 700 ms
(Gross et al., 2001; Gross et al., 2003). To obtain the maximum
interhemispheric difference between conditions, we subtracted
the interpolated RVF-LVF power difference at source level in the
right hemisphere from the effect in the left hemisphere and vice
versa. The source analysis, localizing the maximum difference
between contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres, revealed neu-
ral generators of the EEG effect in the lateral (middle and infe-
rior) occipital gyrus (LOC, BA 18/19; see Fig. 5).
To reveal the neural signature of memory reactivation, we
performed statistical analyses on those electrode clusters showing
significant lateralization differences between LVF and RVF at
encoding. Following previous EEG studies of memory reactiva-
tion (Wimber et al., 2012; Jafarpour et al., 2014; Johnson et al.,
2015) and in line with the theoretical notion of ecphory (Tulving
et al., 1983), we focused our analysis at retrieval on a time-range
preceding the typical timing of recollection effects, before 500 ms
after presentation of the retrieval cue. As indicated by a continu-
ous Wilcoxon sign-rank test, a significant difference between ip-
silateral and contralateral electrode clusters emerged very early,
100–200 ms after cue presentation (p � 0.05), and in a similar
frequency band as during encoding, between 10 and 25 Hz (Fig.
3B, top). This difference, again, was due to a power decrease at the
electrode cluster contralateral to the VF of presentation during
encoding, as indicated by a significant VF � hemisphere interac-
tion (F(1,15) � 8.773, p � 0.01, see Fig. 3B). This effect appeared to
be different between hemispheres in terms of peak frequencies.
As shown in Figure 4A, differences between VF conditions were
clustered �20 Hz in the RH cluster, whereas the LH cluster dis-
played a more specific effect at �10 Hz. Frequency specificity of
the two hemispheres was confirmed in a statistical analysis, show-
ing that only the LH cluster showed a significant VF difference at
10 Hz (t(15) � 2.332, p � 0.034) and only the RH cluster showed
a significant VF difference at 20 Hz (t(15) � 2.616, p � 0.02; Fig.
4B). However, based on our previous studies and following the
idea that we tap into similar oscillatory processes in the two hemi-
spheres, we continued our analyses with data integrated over the
whole frequency range showing a mean contralateral versus ipsi-
lateral difference (Waldhauser et al., 2012).
To check whether contralateral versus ipsilateral differences in
the 10–25 Hz frequency range are indeed due to a poststimulus
decrease, and not due to a prestimulus shift of attention, we re-
peated the same analysis taking into account the raw data from
the baseline (�500 to 0 ms) interval. This analysis yielded no
significant results (F(1,15) � 3.554, p � 0.05).
According to theories on episodic memory, an ecphoric reac-
tivation of trace information is a prerequisite for the recollection
of details of an episode. Thus, we expected it to be most pro-
nounced for source hits, for which the source of encoding could
be correctly remembered. In line with this idea, the contralateral
versus ipsilateral �/� power decrease was significantly greater for
source hits (�7.13 � 9.631%), compared with source misses
(t(15) � 4.061, p � 0.001), the latter actually showing a relative
power increase at contralateral electrodes (7.27 � 12.534%). The
lateralization effects for source hits and source misses were both
significantly different from zero (source hits: t(15) � �2.962, p �
0.01; source misses: t(15) � 2.320, p � 0.035). These results sug-
gest that the laterality of EEG power predicts to which VF an item
is attributed to, in a way that subjects tend to attribute an item to
the VF that is contralateral to the hemisphere displaying a power
decrease. As shown in Table 2, this was also the case on a single-
trial level. Source hit trials more often showed a negative lateral-
ization index (i.e., a power decrease at electrodes contralateral to
the VF in which the item was actually presented during encod-
ing). Source miss trials more often showed a positive lateraliza-
tion index (i.e., a power decrease over the ipsilateral hemisphere)
(Table 2). A dependency of lateralization and response was con-
firmed statistically in a fixed-effects analysis ��1
2 � 4.731, p �
0.03), showing that 53% of all items were classified correctly as
source hits and source misses based on EEG lateralization. This
statistical dependency was also confirmed in a random-effects
analysis on group level, with the mean difference between ob-
served and expected cell values being significantly greater than
zero (0.951 � 1.6374; t(15) � 2.25, p � 0.04). Notably, 11 (of 16)
participants numerically showed this classification pattern (i.e.,

ing individual differences between ex-
pected and observed frequencies against

Finally, we aimed at localizing the
neural generators of �/� power de-
creases for source hits. Neural genera-
tors of this EEG effect corresponded
closely to the sources observed during
encoding, localized to the middle and
inferior LOC (BA 18/19; Fig. 5).

power decrease in the �/� frequency band.
Source analysis suggests that �/� decreases
can be localized to the LOC, a region that is
known to be constitutive for object recogni-
tion during perception and encoding
(Konen and Kastner, 2008) and that is sen-
sitive to hemisphere-specific retrieval of lat-
eralized visual memory traces (Slotnick,
2004; Slotnick and Schacter, 2006).

emergence of �/� oscillatory decreases
during retrieval is in line with previous
EEG studies of early reactivation (Wim-

Johnson et al., 2015) and suggests that
retrieval correlates with a rapidly occur-
ringecphoricprocess.However,itisunclear
whether such early reactivations are func-
tionally relevant to successful episodic re-
trieval.
Theoretically,
these
early
reactivation signatures could accompany
memory retrieval, but they might not be
causally relevant to the retrieval process. To
investigate this question, we tested whether
counteracting early sensory cortical activity
with rTMS in the hemisphere contralateral
to the site of encoding reduces retrieval of
the episodic memory trace.

reduces episodic memory
Behavioral task and procedures in Experiment 2 were identical to
Experiment 1 (Fig. 1), except that, instead of measuring EEG,
rTMS and Sham stimulation were applied during the retrieval
phase of the experiment. Small breaks during the retrieval phases
were used to relocate the TMS coil for the stimulation conditions
(Sham, TMS) on the different stimulation sites, left hemisphere
(LH) or right hemisphere (RH) in each subject. rTMS was ap-
plied at the average center EEG frequency observed during
retrieval (17.5 Hz) at the neural sources of the EEG retrieval effect
obtained in Experiment 1 via a neuronavigation system
(ANT-Visor; www.ant-neuro.com). rTMS was centered at the
timeintervalofmaximumEEGdifferencesbetween100and200ms.
Driving neural assemblies in the LOC at �/� frequencies with 17.5
Hz rTMS (Thut et al., 2011; Hanslmayr et al., 2014) should counter-
act the decrease of �/� power observed in Experiment 1 and there-
fore impair episodic memory retrieval (Waldhauser et al., 2012).
As in Experiment 1, encoding condition (instructed vs nonin-
structed) had no effect on later item recognition or source
memory performance, nor did visual field at encoding (all t(23) �
1.686, p � 0.05; Table 1). Thus, behavioral data were again
collapsed across these encoding conditions. In addition, we col-

 lapsed memory performance for items for which TMS was ap-
plied to the hemisphere contralateral versus ipsilateral to the VF
of presentation during encoding. We assumed that rTMS should
specifically decrease episodic memory performance for items that
were presented contralateral to the hemisphere of stimulation. A
two-way ANOVA on the percentage of correct source hits on all
old items revealed a significant interaction between Stimulation
(Sham vs rTMS) and Hemisphere (contralateral vs ipsilateral to
VF of presentation; F(1,23) � 4.617, p � 0.042; Table 3; Fig. 6B).
No main effect for Stimulation or Hemisphere occurred in this
analysis (F(1,23) � 3.449, p � 0.05). Source memory performance
was significantly lower when rTMS was applied at the hemisphere
contralateral to the VF of encoding compared with contralateral
source memory performance in the Sham condition (t(23) �
2.410, p � 0.024; Table 3; Fig. 6B). No difference between rTMS
and Sham was found for ipsilateral stimulation (t(23) � 0.160, p �
0.874, not significant; Table 3; Fig. 6B). Source hits did not differ
between contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres when analyz-
ing rTMS and Sham stimulation data separately (t(23) � 1.973,
p � 0.05; compare Table 3).
No main or interaction effects were obtained for item recog-
nition as measured in hit rates, regardless of source memory per-
formance (F(1,23) � 2.474, p � 0.05; Table 3), suggesting that
rTMS only had an influence on source memory but not item
memory. However, there was no significant evidence (F(1,23) �
0.013, p � 0.911) that rTMS affected source hits to a larger extent
than hits as tested in a 2 � 2 � 2 ANOVA with factors Type
(source hits vs hits), Stimulation (Sham vs rTMS), and Hemi-
sphere (contralateral vs ipsilateral), possibly because both mea-
sures are not fully independent from each other. To further
explore the nature of the rTMS effect on memory, several control
analyses were performed. For instance, we investigated in how far
rTMS introduced a response bias. To this end, we tested whether
rTMS increased false alarm rates and whether a potential effect
would be dependent on the hemisphere of stimulation in a
two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with factors Stimulation
(rTMS, Sham) and Hemisphere (LH, RH). There was no signifi-
cant main or interaction effect differentiating false alarm rates
during LH (mean � SD, 9.5 � 9.00%) or RH (9.1 � 4.28%),
rTMS and LH (8.4 � 8.29%) or RH (9.0 � 7.15%) Sham stimu-
lation (all F(1,23) � 0.449, p � 0.05). Second, we tested whether
rTMS increased or decreased the tendency to attribute false
alarms to the visual field contralateral to the site of stimulation
(Table 3, source false alarms). Again, no significant main or in-
teraction effect emerged in the two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA with factors Stimulation (rTMS vs Sham) and Hemi-
sphere (contralateral vs ipsilateral; all F(1,23) � 3.206, p � 0.05).

 Together, these analyses show that rTMS specifically affects
source memory performance for items previously presented in the
VFcontralateraltothestimulatedhemispherecomparedwithSham
stimulation. Such an effect could not be observed for hits regardless
of source memory performance, but the reduction in source hit per-
formance was not significantly different from performance for hits

for episodic memory through providing rapid sensory reactivation
as a basis for later source memory performance.
Discussion
We here show that very rapid reactivation of sensory information
is functionally relevant for episodic memory retrieval. This con-
clusion is supported by the results of two independent experi-
ments described above. First, lateralized encoding patterns of �/�
power decreases reemerge rapidly in visual cortical areas during
retrieval. Second, interfering with these early reactivation pat-
terns reduces episodic memory retrieval. These findings add to
the literature in demonstrating very rapid, context-specific mem-
ory reactivation, termed ecphory (Waldhauser et al., 2012; Wim-
ber et al., 2012; Jafarpour et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2015). Our
results go one critical step beyond the previous findings in show-
ing that these rapid reactivations of sensory memory traces are
functionally relevant for episodic memory retrieval and directly
affect the ability to retrieve contextual details of the study epi-
sode. These findings are a major conceptual advance for episodic
memory research, providing first evidence that ecphoric pro-
cesses are causally related to episodic memory retrieval.
Ecphoryhaslongbeensuggestedasaprerequisiteforthe“mental
time travel” implied in retrieval from episodic memory (Tulving et
al., 1983). It is assumed that incoming sensory information from
retrieval cues reverberates with stored memory traces, leading to
their immediate and involuntary reactivation (Tulving, 1982).
While the theoretical idea has a long tradition in cognitive psychol-
ogy (Semon, 1911) and is corroborated by behavioral data (Sheldon
and Moscovitch, 2010), neural evidence for this process has been
sparse. Typically, neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval
were identified in a time range not before �300 ms after onset of a
retrieval cue (Rugg and Curran, 2007). However, recent studies
showed early reactivation patterns during episodic retrieval that are
inlinewithourresults(Waldhauseretal.,2012;Wimberetal.,2012;
Jafarpour et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2015). Albeit using different
analysis strategies and stimuli, these studies show that a replay of
context information can occur rapidly, well within 500 ms after pre-
sentation of a retrieval cue. The exact neural mechanisms of this
sensoryreactivationanditsinteractionwithcontrolledretrievalpro-
cesses are still unclear and deserve further investigation. According
to cognitive theories, ecphory is a necessary but not sufficient pre-
requisite for episodic retrieval (Tulving, 1982, 1983; Moscovitch,
2008). The sensory information needs to be further processed by
higher retrieval mechanisms, possibly through hippocampal-
neocortical loops (Horner et al., 2012; Staresina et al., 2012) and
potentially guided by prefrontal and parietal control (Ranganath
andPaller,1999;Cabezaetal.,2008).Asourdatasuggest,disrupting
early sensory reactivation via external stimulation negatively affects
therecollection(i.e.,retrievalofcontextualdetails)ofepisodicmem-
ories. Interestingly, our results match closely with one of our earlier
studies that showed that inhibiting retrieval of interfering informa-
tion leads to an increase in �/� oscillatory power in the hemisphere
housing unwanted memory traces that interfere with the retrieval of
a target memory trace (Waldhauser et al., 2012). This suggests that
early modulations of �/� power are a decisive ingredient of success-
ful remembering and can already act in concert with retrieval goals
and be biased by higher-order cognitive control mechanisms.
Discussing the possible involvement of prefrontal control
processes calls into question whether “ecphory” is the right label
for the early sensory reactivation effects observed in the present
data. However, as already mentioned in early papers on this topic,
higher-order control mechanisms are likely to interact with rapid
sensory reactivation during ecphory (Tulving et al., 1983; John-
son, 1992; Lepage et al., 2000; Rugg and Wilding, 2000). Recent
neuroscientific studies also suggest that it is difficult to view these

 processes in separation, even at early stages of memory process-
ing and during involuntary retrieval (Kompus, 2011; Kompus et
al., 2011; Waldhauser et al., 2012).
In line with our hypothesis, a decrease of �/� oscillatory
power at the hemisphere contralateral to the VF of encoding was
most pronounced for source hits, to the extent that single trials
could be classified as source hits or source misses on the basis of
EEG lateralization. In the same vein, rTMS had a selective influ-
ence on source memory performance (albeit not to the extent of
yielding significant differences between source hits, and hits; i.e.,
item memory). This pattern of results suggests that �/� power
decreases are particularly relevant for source memory perfor-
mance, which is in accordance with the theoretical notion of
ecphory because correct source memory judgments require the
highest amount of ecphoric information (Tulving et al., 1983).
Unexpectedly, in the EEG analysis, source misses showed �/�
lateralization in the opposite direction compared with source
hits. Interpretation of this result has to remain speculative at this
point. It appears that visual cortical activity predicted later mem-
ory decisions, such that a retrieved memory representation is
attributed to the VF contralateral to the hemisphere where a de-
crease of �/� power occurred. It could be the case that memory
representations attributed to the wrong VF were initially stored
in the ipsilateral hemisphere during encoding. Alternatively, this
misattribution may be due to nonsystematic fluctuations in �/�
activity that led to illusory recollection of the wrong hemifield
(e.g., Lange et al., 2014). Finally, it might be the case that EEG
lateralization in general reflects a process of source reconstruction,
and not sensory reactivation. However, this possibility seems rather
unlikely because reconstructive processes during memory retrieval
are more effortful and typically observed later (�600 ms) during
retrieval processing (Johansson and Mecklinger, 2003; Herron,
2007). Future studies, possibly combining EEG and high-resolution
fMRI or using electrophysiological methods that allow for assessing
gamma oscillations (see below), might allow to distinguish between
true versus false source memories in this paradigm (Slotnick and
Schacter, 2004; Sederberg et al., 2007).
Our findings are in line with the idea that �/� power decre-
ases reflect sensory information of episodic memory traces
(Hanslmayr et al., 2012). However, we cannot conclude that
these are the only frequency bands that are involved in ecphoric
processing because we restrained analyses to low frequencies up
to 30 Hz because EEG is not ideally suited to pick up the presum-
ably very local high-frequency activities in the gamma range
(Lopes da Silva, 2013). Furthermore, we restrained rTMS to the
center frequency of the �/� range observed in Experiment 1 but
did not apply stimulation with another frequency. Thus, al-
though we have strong reason to assume that �/� power in visual
cortex plays a decisive role for ecphoric processes, we cannot
conclude that ecphory is specific to the �/� range. It might be that
gamma, together with theta and alpha oscillations, also plays a
decisive role in ecphoric processes (Osipova et al., 2006; Osipova
et al., 2008). These are important questions that are beyond
the scope of our study and should be addressed by future studies
using techniques that allow for investigating these high-
frequency activities (MEG or intracranial EEG) and applying dif-
ferent control frequencies in stimulation protocols (using TMS
or transcranial alternating current stimulation). Another inter-
esting question that is beyond the scope of our study is the role of
hippocampal-neocortical interactions during early retrieval pro-
cesses. For instance, does the rapid reactivation of sensory infor-
mation depend on the hippocampus or is it a purely cortical or
thalamocortical phenomenon (Staudigl et al., 2012; Headley and
Weinberger, 2015; Ketz et al., 2015)? Our results add an impor-
tant angle to this research topic by suggesting that the earliest
interactions between sensory information and stored memory
traces may occur in the �/� oscillatory band, beyond the long-
discussed role of theta and gamma oscillations for memory pro-
cessing. Finally, another open question is whether similar results
would be observed in different sensory modalities or with differ-
ent visual stimuli. Future studies, together with past research
using different stimulus material and different experimental ma-
nipulations, are required to generalize our findings (Gratton et
al., 1997; Wheeler and Buckner, 2003; Slotnick and Schacter,
2006; Waldhauser et al., 2012).
Together, our results show that retrieval from episodic mem-
ory leads to a very rapid reactivation of encoding activity, which is
visible in �/� power decreases in visual brain regions. Affecting
the cortical generators of the �/� power decrease with rTMS in
the same frequency range hampered episodic memory retrieval.
These observations suggest that episodic memory retrieval relies
on ecphoric processes. A deeper understanding of ecphory and its
manipulation with cortical stimulation techniques potentially of-
fers new perspectives for the treatment of neuropsychiatric dis-
orders (McNamara et al., 2001). For example, patients suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from the rapid intru-
sive reactivation of sensory memories pertaining to their trau-
matic experiences (Reynolds and Brewin, 1999). Treating
memory intrusion through the external induction of oscillatory
activity could be an important future therapeutic mean to assist
patients in controlling unwanted memories.
