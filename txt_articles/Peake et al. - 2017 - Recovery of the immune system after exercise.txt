longed, intense exercise causes an “open window” of immunodepression during
recovery after exercise is well accepted. Repeated exercise bouts or intensified
training without sufficient recovery may increase the risk of illness. However,
except for salivary IgA, clear and consistent markers of this immunodepression
remain elusive. Exercise increases circulating neutrophil and monocyte counts and
reduces circulating lymphocyte count during recovery. This lymphopenia results
from preferential egress of lymphocyte subtypes with potent effector functions
[e.g., natural killer (NK) cells, �� T cells, and CD8� T cells]. These lymphocytes
most likely translocate to peripheral sites of potential antigen encounter (e.g., lungs
and gut). This redeployment of effector lymphocytes is an integral part of the
physiological stress response to exercise. Current knowledge about changes in
immune function during recovery from exercise is derived from assessment at the
cell population level of isolated cells ex vivo or in blood. This assessment can be
biased by large changes in the distribution of immune cells between blood and
peripheral tissues during and after exercise. Some evidence suggests that reduced
immune cell function in vitro may coincide with changes in vivo and rates of illness
after exercise, but more work is required to substantiate this notion. Among the
various nutritional strategies and physical therapies that athletes use to recover from
exercise, carbohydrate supplementation is the most effective for minimizing im-
mune disturbances during exercise recovery. Sleep is an important aspect of
recovery, but more research is needed to determine how sleep disruption influences
the immune system of athletes.

THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS INTEGRAL to the body’s defense against
infection. It also influences other physiological systems and
processes, including tissue repair, metabolism, thermoregula-
tion, sleep/fatigue, and mental health. Over the past 40 years,
exercise immunology has developed into its own discipline
based on the recognition that the immune system mediates
many exercise effects and that stress responses mediated
through the nervous and endocrine systems play a key role in
determining exercise-induced immune changes (84). A classic
paradigm in exercise immunology is that an “open window” of
immunodepression can occur during recovery from intense
exercise. In particular, this paradigm proposes that after intense
exercise, some immune variables (e.g., lymphocyte and natural
killer cell numbers and antibody production) transiently de-
crease below preexercise levels. As a result of this immunode-
pression, microbial agents, especially viruses, may invade the
host or reactivate from a latent state, leading to infection and
illness (87). If exercise is repeated again while the immune
system is still depressed, this could lead to a greater degree of
immunodepression and potentially a longer window of oppor-
tunity for infection (87).
Exercise-induced fatigue exists on a continuum. Repeated
bouts of intense exercise on the same day or over several days
may cause acute fatigue, as indicated by an inability to main-
tain exercise workloads (64). An athlete who trains intensely
for 1�2 wk may experience a state of “functional overreach-
ing,” which is associated with a temporary performance dec-
rement, followed by improved performance. Intense training
over an extended period without sufficient balance between
training and recovery may lead to “nonfunctional overreach-
ing” (NFOR; 64). This condition is typically characterized by
persistent fatigue, performance decrement, muscle soreness,

 and psychological and hormonal disturbances that can last for
weeks or months. Depending on the time needed to recover
from NFOR, an athlete may be diagnosed (retrospectively) as
experiencing “overtraining syndrome” (64).
Recognition of the link between excessive training and risk
of illness has stimulated interest in nutritional supplements and
physical therapies to counteract immunodepression and to
restore immune function after exercise training. In this mini-
review, we update the current state of knowledge about the
temporal changes in the immune system following exercise;
how repeated bouts of exercise on the same day, extended
periods of intense training, and sleep disruption influence the
immune system; and the efficacy of various strategies for
restoring immune function after exercise.
Leukocyte Redeployment During Exercise and Recovery
A single exercise bout causes profound changes in the
number and composition of blood leukocytes that may persist
long into exercise recovery. All major leukocyte subpopula-
tions tend to increase in number during exercise as a result of
hemodynamic shear stress and/or catecholamines acting on
leukocyte �2-adrenergic receptors (126). The postexercise re-
covery period is marked by opposite effects on blood neutro-
phil and lymphocyte numbers. Neutrophil number (and, con-
sequently, the total leukocyte count) often continues to in-
crease long into the recovery period (up to 6 h after exercise
cessation), particularly if the exercise bout is prolonged (�2 h;
86). This sustained “neutrophilia” is characterized by an in-
creased presence of immature, less differentiated, precursor
neutrophils in the blood (117), most likely in response to the
increased plasma levels of soluble agents including glucocor-
ticoids, growth hormone, and cytokines such as IL-6 and
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which mobilize myeloid
cells from the bone marrow (117). Although this neutrophilia
following prolonged exercise is akin to that observed during
bacterial infection (�7.0 � 106/ml), 24 h of recovery are
usually sufficient for neutrophil number to return to normal
(126). A delayed monocytosis is sometimes observed within
1�2 h after very prolonged exercise, but monocyte number
typically returns to the resting level within 6 h after exercise
cessation (126).
By contrast, lymphocyte number decreases rapidly after
exercise. Following prolonged and/or high-intensity exercise in
particular, lymphocyte number commonly decreases to below
the preexercise value within as little as 30 min (126). This
“lymphopenia” can often reach levels typical of clinical lym-
phopenia (�1.0 � 106/ml), but the lymphocyte count is usu-
ally restored to both the resting and clinically normal level
within 4�6 h of recovery (126). After prolonged bouts of
exercise (e.g., 2-h cycling), natural killer (NK) cells (which
account for most of the exercise-induced lymphocytosis) may
be �40% lower than the baseline value for up to 7 days after
exercise (104). Exercise-induced lymphopenia reflects the
preferential movement of lymphocyte subtypes with potent
effector functions (e.g., NK cells, �� T cells, and CD8� T
cells) out of the blood. Even within these subsets, there is a
preferential egress of discrete subtypes of highly differentiated
NK cells, �� T cells, and CD8� T cells with phenotypes
associated with tissue-migrating potential and effector capabil-
ities (107).
The rapid lymphopenia observed during the early stage of
exercise recovery was initially of concern, particularly because
early studies reported large rates of lymphocyte apoptosis
(programmed cell death) after exhaustive exercise (62). How-
ever, these findings have not been substantiated. Subsequent
studies have reported lymphocyte apoptosis of the order of
0�2% after exercise, even though the blood lymphocyte count
was up to 30�40% lower than at rest (66, 105). Lymphocytes
and monocytes leave the blood in large numbers during exer-
cise recovery under the influence of glucocorticoids. Lympho-
cyte subtypes that preferentially egress the peripheral blood
during exercise recovery also have phenotypes consistent with
tissue migration (e.g., expression of surface adhesion mole-
cules and chemokine receptors; 108). These lymphocytes most
likely translocate to peripheral sites of potential antigen en-
counter, such as the lungs or the gut (48).
The skin has long been considered a likely destination for
effector lymphocytes in response to exercise and stress in
general (24). However, recent evidence indicates that CD8� T
cells and NK cells mobilized by exercise do not express
cutaneous homing receptors on their surface (121). Exercise
appears to “prime” effector T cells, thereby allowing them to
transmigrate to the peripheral tissues that require enhanced
immune surveillance following physical stress (54). Compared
with the resting condition, the percentage of circulating lym-
phocytes expressing effector cytokines is lower following pro-
longed exercise (115), but it is unknown whether this decline
reflects impairment at the individual cell level or preferential
movement of effector T cells into peripheral tissues (e.g., lungs
and gut). Recent evidence showing that exercise redeploys T
cells that are specific to latent herpesviruses such as cytomeg-
alovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; 111, 112) sug-
gests that this response may be a countermeasure against
stress-induced viral reactivation (107). Exercise may also mo-
bilize “older” functionally exhausted/senescent lymphocytes to
undergo apoptosis in the tissues and allow new “recruits” to
take their place (106, 107).
Monocytes mobilized by exercise are likely to infiltrate
skeletal muscle and differentiate into tissue-resident macro-
phages that facilitate repair and regeneration, particularly fol-
lowing arduous bouts of exercise that cause significant skeletal
muscle damage (85). Monocytes with effector phenotypes are
also preferentially redeployed after exercise. The CD14�/
CD16� “proinflammatory” monocytes are preferentially mo-
bilized over their CD14�/CD16� counterparts (109). Mono-
cyte expression of pathogen recognition receptors [e.g., toll-
like receptors (TLRs)] tends to decrease in response to
moderate-intensity exercise (109). Conversely, prolonged, in-
tense exercise (60-km cycling time trial) increases TLR2 and
TLR4 expression on monocytes, which may indicate a height-
ened proinflammatory state (11). A recent study showed that
acute exercise mobilizes angiogenic T cells, which may facil-
itate vascular remodeling during exercise recovery (53). Exer-
cise is also known to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells, which
may participate in skeletal muscle repair and regeneration after
exercise (25, 49). It has been suggested that exercise may have
a role as an adjuvant to mobilize stem cells in donors for
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (25).
In addition to cellular redeployment, the recovery phase of
exercise, especially following very prolonged bouts of endur-
ance-based exercise, is marked by striking alterations in the

 functional capacity of several blood leukocyte populations.
Neutrophil bactericidal activity is greatly influenced by the
intensity and duration of exercise. For example, 1 h of cycling
at 50 vs. 80% of V
˙ O2max increases and reduces neutrophil
oxidative burst activity, respectively (94). During the early
stages of recovery after exercise, neutrophil bactericidal activ-
ity continues to increase after 40 min to 1 h of moderate-
intensity exercise, whereas it remains impaired after exhaustive
or prolonged exercise (86). NK cell cytotoxicity after exercise
bouts of relatively short duration tends to remain unchanged on
a per cell basis during recovery (81) but may decline after very
prolonged bouts (33). T cell proliferation in response to mito-
gen stimulation typically decreases both during and after ex-
ercise, regardless of exercise modality, intensity, or duration
(126). Prolonged exercise may also reduce T cell homing and
migration (8), lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine secretion
by monocytes (113), and the percentage of T cells producing
effector cytokines in response to mitogen stimulation (115).
Thus the general trend during exercise recovery is that short
bouts of moderate-intensity exercise have little effect on (or
might even enhance) cellular immune function, whereas pro-
longed bouts (�1.5 h) of heavy exertion appear to reduce the
normal functioning of all major immune cell subtypes. These
effects may leave athletes susceptible to illness during recovery
from competition or heavy training (87).
Repeated Exercise Bouts and Extended Periods of
Intense Training
The repeated-bout paradigm (87) proposes that compared
with a single bout of exercise, repeated exercise bouts on the
same day (27, 73, 96, 102) or over several days (43) cause
different changes in circulating cell counts, lymphocyte prolif-
eration, and NK cytotoxicity. Subsequent research has inves-
tigated changes in other immune responses to repeated exercise
bouts on the same day with short vs. long recovery and
intensified training over weeks or months. Figure 1 summa-
rizes the evidence for changes in the immune system after
repeated exercise bouts and days to months of intense training.
One vs. two bouts of exercise per day. Studies on the effects
of one vs. two bouts of exercise on a single day have included
physically active (56–58, 63, 96, 102), highly trained (23, 88),
or elite (12, 73, 98, 99) participants. The exercises involved
cycling (12, 27, 56–58, 63, 96, 98, 99, 102), running (23, 88),
or rowing (73). The duration and intensity ranged from �15
min at maximal intensity (27, 73) up to 2 h at medium-high
intensity (i.e., 60�75% V
˙ O2max; 56, 96). The recovery period
between exercise bouts was most commonly 3�4 h but ranged
from 45 min (102) to 12 h (88). Compared with the initial bout
of exercise, the following immune variables typically show
either a greater relative change or a higher absolute value after
a second bout of exercise: total leukocyte count (57, 63, 99,
102), neutrophil count (23, 73, 96, 99, 102), oxidative burst
(per neutrophil; 12), elastase release (per neutrophil; 57),
CD4� T cell count (73, 99, 102), whole blood IL-8 production
(23), and NK cell activation (represented by CD69 expression;
99). Conversely, lymphocyte proliferation (96, 102) and whole
blood IL-6 production (23) are typically lower following a
second bout compared with the first bout of exercise.
Short vs. long recovery. Three studies on the effects of
recovery duration between two bouts of exercise included
highly trained or elite athletes who cycled for 65 min at 75%
V
˙ O2max, twice each day, with either 3 or 6 h between the
exercise bouts (12, 97, 98). A short recovery period (i.e., 3 h)
induces either a greater relative increase or higher absolute
values for neutrophil count (12, 97), oxidative burst activity per
neutrophil (12), and CD8� T cell and NK cell counts (97) after
the second bout of exercise. Exercise-induced changes in
lymphocyte (97), monocyte, and eosinophil (12) counts; abso-
lute oxidative burst activity (12); NK cytotoxicity (97); and
plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1ra (98) do not differ
after a short vs. long recovery period.
Consecutive or multiple days of exercise. Studies detailing
how the immune system responds to exercise repeated on
consecutive days or every second day have included untrained
or physically active participants (43, 116, 118) or well-trained
or elite athletes (60, 73, 77, 79). Exercise included 3 � 6-min
maximal rowing, repeated twice over 2 days (73), and 1�3-h
cycling (77, 79, 118) or running (60) at 50�70% V
˙ O2max
repeated over 3 days, every second day for 3 days (43), or daily
for 7 days (116). Exercise-induced changes in plasma cytokine
and elastase concentrations and cytokine mRNA expression in
leukocytes and muscle diminish over consecutive days (77,
118). By contrast, changes in total leukocyte, neutrophil, and
monocyte counts (73, 116, 118), lymphocyte proliferation (79),
neutrophil chemotaxis (116), leukocyte IL-1ra mRNA expres-
sion (77), plasma myeloperoxidase concentration, and salivary
IgA secretion rate (79) do not change over time. Changes in
lymphocyte subsets (43, 73), oxidative burst activity (79, 116,
118), salivary IgA secretion rate (60, 77), and NK cell count
and cytotoxicity (73, 79) over consecutive days are more
variable.
Immune changes associated with overreaching and overtraining.
Studies on short periods (2�4 wk) of functional overreaching
have reported decreases in resting neutrophil degranulation
(95), lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody production (124).
Neutrophil count, plasma cytokine concentrations, CD4-to-
CD8 T cell ratio, and salivary IgA concentration are more
variable (or do not change) in response to functional overreach-
ing (39, 95, 124). Athletes who exhibit signs of nonfunctional
overreaching and/or frequent upper respiratory illness present
with lower salivary IgA concentration (26, 35, 60); lower
cytokine production by monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic
cells (67); and a greater number of activated (CD25�) lym-
phocytes (29). Changes in differential blood cell counts, lym-
phocyte subsets, and NK cell count following extended periods
of intensified training are variable (29, 35, 61). Studies of
athletes exhibiting the hallmarks of overtraining syndrome
(including illness) have not revealed any consistent or charac-
teristic immune profile (30, 101).
Sleep Disturbance and Immune Function
Sleep disturbances influence immunity via activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic ner-
vous system (46). Chronic sleep disturbance and disruption to
the normal circadian rhythm are associated with inflammation
and desynchronization of rhythmic immune variables. These
responses likely contribute to increased risk of infection, car-
diovascular disease, and cancer in shift workers (21, 68).
Despite evidence that athletes experience poor sleep patterns
compared with nonathletes (16, 55), surprisingly little is known

 about how sleep disturbance influences the immune responses
to exercise. Compared with normal sleep, a disrupted night’s
sleep appears to prime the immune system and enhance im-
munosurveillance by stimulating total lymphocytes, CD8� T
cells, NK cells, and �� T cells to leave the blood and migrate
to potential sites of infection during the early recovery period
after exercise (45). By contrast, other studies indicate that a
night without sleep does not influence leukocyte trafficking,
neutrophil degranulation, or mucosal immunity at rest or after
exercise (31, 93). Subtle immune changes have been observed
after a night without sleep, including a shift toward a T helper
2 cytokine profile (46).
It is uncertain whether these subtle immune modifications
with acute sleep loss are clinically meaningful. When consid-
ering the potential effects of poor sleep on immunity in
athletes, it is important to distinguish between acute and
chronic sleep disturbance. Chronic sleep disturbance (12
nights, 50% sleep loss) increases the plasma inflammation
markers C-reactive protein and IL-6 (38). However, interven-
ing daytime naps can counter this apparent inflammatory re-
sponse (103). Short sleep duration (�7 h/night for 7 days)
decreases the response to hepatitis B vaccination and the
likelihood of clinical protection (90). Similarly, a night of
wakefulness after hepatitis A vaccination decreases the specific
antibody response 2�4 mo later (52). People who experience
poor-quality sleep and/or regular sleep deprivation also have a
4�5 times greater risk of developing the common cold (16,
91). Continued research efforts should be directed toward
monitoring and improving sleep in athletes and understanding
the implications for immune health.

 Nutritional Interventions for Restoring Immune Function
After Exercise
Research over the last 30 years has investigated whether
nutritional strategies counteract exercise-induced immunode-
pression and systemic inflammation (32, 125). A comprehen-
sive review of the literature on these is beyond the scope of this
mini-review; other, more detailed reviews on this topic are
available [e.g., Gleeson (32) and Walsh et al. (125)]. Here, we
focus on the most effective nutritional strategies (primarily
carbohydrate ingestion) for restoring systemic immune func-
tion in the first few hours after exercise (9, 10, 19, 51, 65, 76,
78, 82, 83) and over consecutive days (7). We also assess
whether the timing of nutritional interventions (i.e., before,
during, or after exercise) influences their effectiveness (50, 59).
Carbohydrate supplementation before and/or during
exercise. Carbohydrate supplementation during prolonged, in-
tense exercise consistently attenuates exercise-induced in-
creases in circulating cytokines (74, 125) and the redistribution
of neutrophils (74, 76, 78), monocytes (76, 82), natural killer
cells (78), and lymphocytes (51). The immunomodulatory
effects of carbohydrates arise from better maintenance of blood
glucose concentrations and blunted release of stress hormones
such as catecholamines and glucocorticoids during and after
exercise (51, 76, 78, 82, 83). Although the systemic release of
IL-6 during exercise is related to muscle glycogen depletion
(114), the precise mechanism by which carbohydrate supple-
mentation reduces systemic IL-6 release from contracting mus-
cle during exercise is not clear, because carbohydrate supple-
mentation does not alter muscle glycogen content (75).
In several studies, the immunomodulatory effects of carbo-
hydrate supplementation were observed to “carry over” into the
recovery period (i.e., �2 h postexercise; 51, 76, 78, 82, 83).
Nieman et al. reported that carbohydrate supplementation dur-
ing 2.5-h high-intensity running reduces the number of neutro-
phils (immediately and 1.5 h postexercise), monocytes (imme-
diately and 6 h postexercise), and lymphocytes (immediately
and 3 h postexercise) (76, 78). Extending carbohydrate inges-
tion to the postexercise recovery period also reduces neu-
trophil count (74) and blood granulocyte and monocyte
phagocytosis 6 h postexercise (82). Lancaster et al. showed
that carbohydrate consumption (30 and 60 g/h) during 2.5-h
cycling minimized the suppression of CD4� and CD8� T
lymphocytes, which express and produce IFN�, during the
2 h following exercise (51).
Considering that exercise-induced responses of the adaptive
immune system are relatively slow (125), it is important to
assess whether these effects are maintained over consecutive
days of exercise. Carbohydrate ingestion before, during, and
after two exercise bouts on 2 consecutive days attenuated the
decrease in antigen-stimulated proliferative lymphocyte re-
sponses before exercise on the second day (7). Carbohydrate
ingestion also enhanced lymphocyte proliferative responses to
mitogen stimulation postexercise on the second day (7). These
findings suggest that carbohydrates may help to diminish
potential cumulative immunodepression over consecutive days
of exercise.
The immunomodulatory effects of carbohydrate may depend
on the timing of carbohydrate intake. The ingestion of a
glucose solution 15 min, but not 75 min, before 1-h high-
intensity cycling prevented immunoendocrine perturbations
(50). The lack of an effect of carbohydrates ingested 75 min
preexercise was potentially associated with an insulin-induced
decrease in the plasma glucose concentration before exercise,
which, in turn, might have enhanced immunoendocrine re-
sponses (50). Carbohydrate ingestion during either the first or
the second of two 90-min bouts of cycling on the same day
better maintained plasma glucose and attenuated plasma stress
hormone responses to the second bout (59). By contrast,
carbohydrate ingestion during the 2-h recovery period between
these exercise bouts had no such effects (59). These findings
suggest beneficial effects of a timely carbohydrate supplemen-
tation (i.e., shortly before and/or during exercise) on immune
responses to exercise. This may be particularly relevant with
more prolonged and/or intense exercise protocols and when the
recovery duration between two consecutive exercise bouts is
short.
Carbohydrate ingestion does not influence all aspects of the
immune system. For example, carbohydrate supplementation
does not alter the exercise-induced suppression of natural killer
cell function (78) or salivary IgA secretion (18). Importantly, it
remains unclear whether the immunomodulatory effects of
carbohydrates have clinical relevance for resistance to illness
or adaptation of the immune system to regular exercise stress
(32, 125). Recent evidence indicates that carbohydrate supple-
mentation during prolonged exercise blunts exercise-induced
immune-endocrine perturbations but does not prevent the sup-
pression of in vivo immunity (22). More research is required to
examine the effects of carbohydrates (or other nutritional
strategies) on in vivo immune function in response to acute and
chronic exercise.
Dietary carbohydrate intake after glycogen depletion. Some
studies have investigated the effects of dietary carbohydrate
intake on immune responses to consecutive days of exercise
intended to deplete muscle glycogen (9, 10, 34, 65). A higher
carbohydrate intake consistently attenuated certain compo-
nents of immunodepression well into the recovery period (i.e.,
�2 h postexercise) after the second exercise session (10, 34,
65). Athletic training often involves conditions of low carbo-
hydrate availability, e.g., due to abbreviated recovery periods
and/or as part of a “train low-compete high” training regime
(41, 42). These investigations therefore have particular practi-
cal implications. Compared with a higher carbohydrate intake
(8 g·kg�1·day�1), very low carbohydrate intake (0.5
g·kg�1·day�1) leads to greater perturbation in leukocyte sub-
sets during recovery from exercise (65). These effects may be
related to sustained elevation of plasma cortisol concentration
(65). Bishop et al. observed that compared with a low-
carbohydrate diet (1.1 g·kg�1·day�1), a high-carbohydrate diet
(8.4 g·kg�1·day�1) for 3 days after glycogen-lowering cycling
attenuated plasma cortisol and cytokine concentrations and
circulating total leukocyte and neutrophil counts following
subsequent exercise (10).
Consuming a high-carbohydrate diet (8.5 g·kg�1·day�1) also
reduces overreaching symptoms during 11 days of intense
training, compared with moderate carbohydrate consumption
(5.5 g·kg�1·day�1; 1). The periodic implementation of “train-
low” strategies (e.g., by commencing training with low muscle
glycogen stores) may further amplify metabolic adaptations in
skeletal muscle (41, 42). When considering their dietary car-
bohydrate intake, athletes should aim to achieve a balance
between minimizing immunodepression and maximizing met-

 abolic adaptations in skeletal muscle. In view of the detrimen-
tal effects of low carbohydrate availability on the immune
system, chronic carbohydrate restriction should be avoided
during intense periods of training (32, 41). Additional research
is warranted to better understand the effect of long-term train-
ing consisting of intermittent train-low sessions on immune
function and susceptibility to illness.
Dietary protein intake and postexercise protein supplementation.
Recognizing the importance of protein for immunocompetence
(15), there are benefits of postexercise protein ingestion (18,
19, 69) or a diet high in protein (128) on immune responses to
exercise. On the basis of previous results indicating that exer-
cise-induced lymphocyte trafficking was impaired during high-
intensity training, Witard et al. examined whether a high-
protein diet can restore these impaired immune responses
(128). Consuming a high-protein diet (3 g·kg�1·day�1) helped
to minimize exercise-induced changes in lymphocyte distribu-
tion during a period of intense training (128). Interestingly, an
energy- and carbohydrate-matched normal protein diet (1.5
g·kg�1·day�1) failed to provide the same benefit (128). The
high-protein diet was also associated with fewer self-reported
upper respiratory illnesses (128). Another study demonstrated
that protein and leucine supplementation for 1–3 h postexercise
during 6 days of high-intensity training enhanced neutrophil
respiratory burst activity after the last exercise session (69).
Consuming a carbohydrate-protein solution immediately, but
not 1 h, after exercise prevents a decrease in neutrophil de-
granulation during the postexercise recovery period (19).
Recent research has shown that the timing, distribution, and
amount of postexercise protein intake modulate the blood and
tissue availability of protein/amino acids and adaptive re-
sponses of skeletal muscle (3, 42). Notably, amino acid-
sensitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is
also a key mechanism underlying leukocyte trafficking (110).
More studies are therefore needed to examine whether different
postexercise protein feeding patterns influence immune func-
tion during recovery from exercise.
Antioxidants and phytochemicals. Except for carbohydrate
supplementation, evidence for effective nutritional counter-
measures to exercise-induced immune alterations is limited
(32, 125). Among other types of nutritional supplements [e.g.,
probiotics and vitamin D; for reviews, see Gleeson (32) and
Walsh et al. (125)], antioxidants and phytochemicals such as
quercetin have been studied for their potential capacity to
minimize immune perturbations, particularly during exercise
recovery (75, 77, 79, 80). Some data point toward beneficial
effects of quercetin supplementation on immune health after
intense exercise (77, 79). Other findings suggest an increased
need for nutritional antioxidants during the first 24 h of
recovery from intense exercise lasting several hours such as an
Ironman triathlon (71). However, taken together, the present
literature is not sufficiently robust to recommend supplemen-
tation with phytochemicals or antioxidants to prevent immune
suppression and illness in athletes and exercising individuals.
Athletes often take high doses of antioxidant/phytochemical
supplements in the belief that this will reduce their risk of
illness (47). However, high doses of antioxidant/phytochemical
supplements can interfere with training adaptations (42, 72). A
natural diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts
delivers antioxidants and phytochemicals in physiologically
effective amounts that are most likely sufficient to help main-
tain immune function following exercise and during exercise
training (32, 72, 125).
Other Strategies for Restoring Immune Function
After Exercise
In addition to nutritional interventions, other research has
examined the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and various physical therapies for restoring immune
function after exercise. Some studies (13, 20, 70, 89, 120, 127)
have shown effects of NSAIDs, but other human studies have
failed to demonstrate any effects of NSAIDs (122, 123),
cryotherapy (44), compression garments (5, 37, 92), active
recovery (2, 119), or other physical therapies (28) on immune
responses during recovery from exercise (Fig. 2). Despite this
lack of empirical evidence for the benefits of NSAIDs and
physical therapies for restoring immune function after exercise,
some of these treatments are associated with positive psycho-
logical outcomes and other effects not related to immune
function after exercise (4, 17). Therefore, although the physi-
ological effects of these physical treatments are not understood
fully at the present time, they may confer some important
benefits for athletes, which may involve the immune system,
perhaps indirectly.
Theoretical and Practical Considerations
The redeployment of effector lymphocytes from blood to
peripheral tissues is seen as an integral part of the physiological
stress response and the immune system’s response to prepare
the body for potential injury by mobilizing its “troops” (cells)
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:
• no Δ inflammatory cells, cytokine mRNA expression,
NF-κB binding activity in muscle
• ↑ IL-6 release from tendons
Massage: ↓ NF-κB (p65) accumulation, IL-6 and TNFα protein
expression in muscle
Vibration therapy: ↑ blood neutrophils, ↓ blood lymphocytes
and plasma IL-6 concentration
Electrical stimulation: no Δ plasma IL-6 concentration
Cold water immersion: ↓ blood neutrophils and monocytes;
no Δ plasma IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10
Icing: ↓ plasma IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6 and TNFα
Cryotherapy: ↓ plasma IL-1β; ↑ plasma IL-1ra
Compression garments: no Δ plasma IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα
Active recovery:
• ↑ blood neutrophils; ↓ blood lymphocytes
• no Δ plasma cytokines, C-reactive protein, complement

 to increase immunosurveillance (24). Therefore immune integ-
rity during exercise recovery may be characterized by the
host’s ability to redeploy effector lymphocytes effectively to
the peripheral tissues. Lymphocyte redeployment may be im-
paired following very prolonged bouts of exercise or in athletes
who are overreaching. The redeployment of CD8� T cells both
during and after exercise is significantly reduced after 1 wk of
high-intensity training compared with normal training (129).
Specifically, the egress of CD8� T cells was 1.4-fold higher
after normal compared with high-intensity training.
Considering other evidence that stress-induced leukocyte
redeployment is linked to poor clinical outcomes following
surgery (100), immune cell redistribution and infection risk
after exercise warrant further investigation. High-volume ex-
ercise training may impair the redeployment of viral-specific T
cells and NK cells, thereby reducing antiviral “patrolling”
during exercise recovery (Fig. 3). Herpes viruses such as EBV
and CMV are highly prevalent in the population, and reacti-
vation of these viruses from a latent state is indicative of
systemic immunodepression (107). EBV viral DNA is present
in saliva from athletes after even short periods of high-intensity
training (36), but it is unknown whether this reflects training-
induced impairment in the trafficking of virus-fighting lym-
phocytes.
Cellular immune function in response to exercise is typically
assessed in isolated cells ex vivo or at the cell population level
in the blood compartment. This approach can make it difficult
to interpret changes in immune cell function after exercise
because of the massive alterations in the cellular composition
of discrete leukocyte subtypes. On the one hand, it seems
intuitive to interpret lower immune cell function measured in
blood during the early stages of exercise recovery as indicative
of immunodepression. On the other hand, it is equally possible
that after exercise, the most functional immune cells (i.e., those
with effector phenotypes and high tissue-migrating potential)
are redeployed to other areas of the body where they are
needed. If true, this suggests that systemic immunosurveillance
may be enhanced during exercise recovery, despite an apparent
depressed profile in the blood compartment.
It is difficult to determine the biological significance of
exercise-induced changes in immune cell function when as-
sessed in vitro. This is because cell function is typically
assessed relative to the total cell population (e.g., percentage of
T cells responding to mitogen stimulation, number of target
cells killed per NK cell, oxidative burst activity per neutrophil,
etc.) without accounting for exercise-induced changes in the
subset composition of these cell populations. For example, the
proportion of NK cells expressing the activating receptor,
NKG2C, is markedly elevated during exercise recovery (6). As
a result, NK cell cytotoxic activity for the total NK cell
population increases markedly when an NKG2C-sensitive tar-
get cell is used to assess NK cell function (6). Conversely,
when an NKG2C-insensitive target cell line (K562) is used,
NK cell killing is not affected by exercise (6). Therefore the
proportional shifts in the composition of cell subtypes should
be considered when interpreting exercise-induced changes in
immune cell function at the total cell population level in vitro.
Moreover, assessment of in vitro immune cell function using
venous blood samples does not account for the complex inter-
actions among immune cells and soluble factors within tissues
(e.g., gut, lungs, and skin). However, some evidence suggests
that reduced immune cell function in vitro may coincide with
changes in vivo and rates of illness (14, 40).
The validity of the original paradigm of cumulative immu-
nodepression with repeated bouts of exercise (87) is somewhat
difficult to assess. Months of intense training increase the
incidence of illness in elite athletes (26, 30, 35). However, on
the basis of these studies, we can only assume, but not assert,
that increased incidence of illness results from an imbalance
between training and recovery. Research that has systemati-
cally manipulated the balance between training and recovery
has not identified any immune variables that are consistently
depressed as a result of insufficient recovery after exercise.
However, with one exception (79), these studies have not
tracked the incidence of illness after repeated bouts of exercise.
Reduced salivary IgA concentration and secretion rate
(amount of IgA secreted over a fixed period) may predispose
athletes to illness in the long term (26, 35). IgA binds micro-
Fig. 3. Overreaching or heavy training is associated with
impaired cellular immune function and latent viral reactiva-
tion. Reduction in lymphocyte trafficking and function dur-
ing exercise recovery impairs immune surveillance, which
may increase susceptibility to opportunistic infection. Low-
ered immunity may also allow previously acquired viruses to
reactivate from a latent state, which may cause further im-
munodepression and increase susceptibility to infection.

 organisms such as bacteria and viruses in the mucosa so that
they can be destroyed by immune cells. However, short-term
changes in salivary IgA concentration and secretion rate after
repeated bouts of exercise are variable (56, 58, 60, 79). Sali-
vary IgA concentration and secretion rate may decrease incre-
mentally over longer periods. The repeated exercise models
used in many of the studies described above induce only acute
fatigue (64). Accordingly, smaller exercise-induced changes in
immune variables following repeated bouts of exercise may
actually represent positive adaptation of the immune system, as
opposed to depression of immunity that may lead to illness.
Pedersen et al. (87) suggested that there is a critical thresh-
old for exercise intensity and duration that determines the risk
of immunodepression after repeated bouts of exercise. How-
ever, no studies have systematically determined the effects of
repeated exercise bouts of different intensity and duration.
There are also no data on the effects of repeated bouts of
anaerobic or resistance/strength exercise, or a combination of
different types of exercise on the same day. The large gaps in
Fig. 1 show that much remains to be learned about the effects
of repeated bouts of exercise on the immune system.
Among various nutritional interventions that have been
studied to counteract immunodepression during exercise recov-
ery, carbohydrate supplementation has proven the most effec-
tive. A balanced and well-diversified diet that meets the energy
demands in athletes and exercising individuals is certainly a
key component to maintain immune function in response to
strenuous exercise and intense periods of training. Additional
research is warranted to investigate how the timing and pattern
in the ingestion of nutrients, particularly carbohydrates and
protein/amino acids, influence recovery of the immune system
after exercise.
Sleep disturbances can depress immunity, increase inflam-
mation, and promote adverse health outcomes in the general
population. However, the limited data available on how sleep
disturbances influence immune responses to exercise are in-
consistent. Physical treatments that are used after exercise
(e.g., hydrotherapy and massage) may enhance the athlete’s
sense of well-being and should be considered as adjunct
therapies for maintaining immune health.
