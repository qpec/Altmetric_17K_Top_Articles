Research impact: a narrative review
Trisha Greenhalgh1*, James Raftery2, Steve Hanney3 and Matthew Glover3
Abstract
Impact occurs when research generates benefits (health, economic, cultural) in addition to building the academic
knowledge base. Its mechanisms are complex and reflect the multiple ways in which knowledge is generated and
utilised. Much progress has been made in measuring both the outcomes of research and the processes and
activities through which these are achieved, though the measurement of impact is not without its critics. We
review the strengths and limitations of six established approaches (Payback, Research Impact Framework, Canadian
Academy of Health Sciences, monetisation, societal impact assessment, UK Research Excellence Framework) plus
recently developed and largely untested ones (including metrics and electronic databases). We conclude that (1)
different approaches to impact assessment are appropriate in different circumstances; (2) the most robust and
sophisticated approaches are labour-intensive and not always feasible or affordable; (3) whilst most metrics tend
to capture direct and proximate impacts, more indirect and diffuse elements of the research-impact link can and
should be measured; and (4) research on research impact is a rapidly developing field with new methodologies
on the horizon.

Background
This paper addresses the question: ‘What is research
impact and how might we measure it?’. It has two main
aims, first, to introduce the general reader to a new and
somewhat specialised literature on the science of re-
search impact assessment and, second, to contribute to
the development of theory and the taxonomy of method
in this complex and rapidly growing field of inquiry.
Summarising evidence from previous systematic and
narrative reviews [1–7], including new reviews from our
own team [1, 5], we consider definitions of impact and
its conceptual and philosophical basis before reviewing
the strengths and limitations of different approaches to
its assessment. We conclude by suggesting where future
research on research impact might be directed.
Research impact has many definitions (Box 1). Its
measurement is important considering that researchers
are increasingly expected to be accountable and produce
value for money, especially when their work is funded
from the public purse [8]. Further, funders seek to
demonstrate the benefits from their research spending
[9] and there is pressure to reduce waste in research
[10]. By highlighting how (and how effectively) resources
are being used, impact assessment can inform strategic
planning by both funding bodies and research institu-
tions [1, 11].
We draw in particular on a recent meta-synthesis of
studies of research impact funded by the UK Health
Technology Assessment Programme (HTA review) cov-
ering literature mainly published between 2005 and 2014
[1]. The HTA review was based on a systematic search
of eight databases (including grey literature) plus hand
searching and reference checking, and identified over 20
different impact models and frameworks and 110 studies
describing their empirical applications (as single or mul-
tiple case studies), although only a handful had proven
robust and flexible across a range of examples. The ma-
terial presented in this summary paper, based on much
more extensive work, is inevitably somewhat eclectic.
Four of the six approaches we selected as ‘established’
were the ones most widely used in the 110 published
empirical studies. Additionally, we included the Soci-
etal Impact Assessment despite it being less widely
used since it has recently been the subject of a major

 EU-funded workstream (across a range of fields) and the
UK Research Excellence Framework (REF; on which em-
pirical work post-dated our review) because of the size
and uniqueness of the dataset and its significant (?) inter-
national interest. The approaches we selected as showing
promise for the future were chosen more subjectively on
the grounds that there is currently considerable academic
and/or policy interest in them.
Different approaches to assessing research impact
make different assumptions about the nature of research
knowledge, the purpose of research, the definition of
research quality, the role of values in research and its
implementation, the mechanisms by which impact is
achieved, and the implications for how impact is mea-
sured (Table 1). Short-term proximate impacts are easier
to attribute, but benefits from complementary assets
(such as the development of research infrastructure, pol-
itical support or key partnerships [8]) may accumulate in
the longer term but are more difficult – and sometimes
impossible – to fully capture.
Knowledge is intertwined with politics and persuasion.
If stakeholders agree on what the problem is and what a
solution would look like, the research-impact link will
tend to turn on the strength of research evidence in
favour of each potential decision option, as depicted in
column 2 of Table 1 [12]. However, in many fields – for
example, public policymaking, social sciences, applied
public health and the study of how knowledge is dis-
tributed and negotiated in multi-stakeholder collabo-
rations – the links between research and impact are
complex, indirect and hard to attribute (for an ex-
ample, see Kogan and Henkel’s rich ethnographic
study of the Rothschild experiment in the 1970s,
which sought – and failed – to rationalize the links be-
tween research and policy [13]). In policymaking, research
evidence is rather more often used conceptually (for gen-
eral enlightenment) or symbolically (to justify a chosen
course of action) than instrumentally (feeding directly into
Box 1: Definitions of research impact
Impact is the effect research has beyond academia and
consists of “….benefits to one or more areas of the
economy, society, culture, public policy and services,
health, production, environment, international
development or quality of life, whether locally,
regionally, nationally or internationally” (paragraph 62)
and as “…manifested in a wide variety of ways
including, but not limited to: the many types of
beneficiary (individuals, organisations, communities,
regions and other entities); impacts on products,
processes, behaviours, policies, practices; and avoidance
of harm or the waste of resources.” (paragraph 63)
UK 2014 Research Excellence Framework [65]
“‘Health impacts’ can be defined as changes in the
healthy functioning of individuals (physical,
psychological, and social aspects of their health),
changes to health services, or changes to the broader
determinants of health. ‘Social impacts’ are changes
that are broader than simply those to health noted
above, and include changes to working systems, ethical
understanding of health interventions, or population
interactions. ‘Economic impacts’ can be regarded as
the benefits from commercialization, the net monetary
value of improved health, and the benefits from
performing health research.”
Canadian Academy of Health Sciences [33] (p. 51)
Academic impact is “The demonstrable contribution
that excellent research makes to academic advances,
across and within disciplines, including significant
advances in understanding, methods, theory and
application.” Economic and societal impact is
“fostering global economic performance, and
specifically the economic competitiveness of the UK,
increasing the effectiveness of public services and
policy, [and] enhancing quality of life, health and
creative output.”
Research Councils UK Pathways to Impact
(http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/innovation/impacts/)
“A research impact is a recorded or otherwise
auditable occasion of influence from academic
research on another actor or organization. […] It is not
the same thing as a change in outputs or activities as
a result of that influence, still less a change in social
outcomes. Changes in organizational outputs and
social outcomes are always attributable to multiple
forces and influences. Consequently, verified causal
links from one author or piece of work to output
changes or to social outcomes cannot realistically be
made or measured in the current state of knowledge.
[…] However, secondary impacts from research can
sometimes be traced at a much more aggregate level,
and some macro-evaluations of the economic net bene-
fits of university research are feasible. Improving our
knowledge of primary impacts as occasions of influence
is the best route to expanding what can be achieved
here.”

Science can never be
value-neutral; the researcher’s
perspective must be made
explicit
Facts are interpreted and used
by people who bring particular

it and the interests it serves
Controversial; arguably,
Actor-Network Theory is
consistent with a value-laden
view of science
Assumed mechanism
through which impact is
achieved
Direct (new knowledge will
influence practice and policy if
the principles and methods of
implementation science are
followed)
Mainly indirect (e.g. via
interaction/enlightenment of
policymakers and influencing
the ‘mindlines’ of clinicians)
Interaction between reasoning
(of policymakers, practitioners,
etc.) and resources available for
implementing findings
Development of critical
consciousness; partnership-
building; lobbying; advocacy
‘Translations’ (stable changes
in the actor-network), achieved
by actors who mobilise other
actors into new configurations
Implications for the study
of research impact
‘Logic models’ will track how
research findings (transferable
facts about what works) are
disseminated, taken up and
used for societal benefit
Outcomes of social
interventions are
unpredictable; impact studies
should focus on ‘activities
and interactions’ to build
relations with policymakers
Impact studies should address
variability in uptake and use of
research by exploring context-
mechanism-outcome-impact
configurations
Impact has a political dimension;
research may challenge the
status quo; some stakeholders
stand to lose power, whereas
others may gain
For research to have impact,
a re-alignment of actors
(human/technological) is
needed; focus on the changing
‘actor-scenario’ and how this
gets stabilised in the network

 a particular policy decision) [12, 14], as shown empirically
by Amara et al.’s large quantitative survey of how US gov-
ernment agencies drew on university research [15]. Social
science research is more likely to illuminate the com-
plexity of a phenomenon than produce a simple, ‘imple-
mentable’ solution that can be driven into practice by
incorporation into a guideline or protocol [16, 17], as was
shown by Dopson and Fitzgerald’s detailed ethnographic
case studies of the implementation of evidence-based
healthcare in healthcare organisations [18]. In such
situations, the research-impact relationship may be pro-
ductively explored using approaches that emphasise the
fluidity of knowledge and the multiple ways in which it
may be generated, assigned more or less credibility and
value, and utilised (columns 3 to 6 in Table 1) [12, 19].
Many approaches to assessing research impact com-
bine a logic model (to depict input-activities-output-
impact links) with a ‘case study’ description to capture the
often complex processes and interactions through which
knowledge is produced (perhaps collaboratively and/or
with end-user input to study design), interpreted and
shared (for example, through engagement activities,
audience targeting and the use of champions, boundary
spanners and knowledge brokers [20–24]). A nuanced
narrative may be essential to depict the non-linear links
between upstream research and distal outcomes and/
or help explain why research findings were not taken
up and implemented despite investment in knowledge
translation efforts [4, 6].
Below, we describe six approaches that have proved
robust and useful for measuring research impact and
some additional ones introduced more recently. Table 2
lists examples of applications of the main approaches
reviewed in this paper.
Established approaches to measuring research
impact
The Payback Framework
Developed by Buxton and Hanney in 1996 [25], the Pay-
back Framework (Fig. 1) remains the most widely used
approach. It was used by 27 of the 110 empirical applica-
tion studies in the recent HTA review [1]. Despite its
name, it does not measure impact in monetary terms. It
consists of two elements: a logic model of the seven
stages of research from conceptualisation to impact,
and five categories to classify the paybacks – knowledge
(e.g. academic publications), benefits to future research
(e.g. training new researchers), benefits to policy (e.g. in-
formation base for clinical policies), benefits to health and
the health system (including cost savings and greater
equity), and broader economic benefits (e.g. commercial
spin-outs). Two interfaces for interaction between resear-
chers and potential users of research (‘project specifi-
cation, selection and commissioning’ and ‘dissemination’)
and various feedback loops connecting the stages are seen
as crucial.
The elements and categories in the Payback Frame-
work were designed to capture the diverse ways in which
impact may arise, notably the bidirectional interactions
between researchers and users at all stages in the re-
search process from agenda setting to dissemination and
implementation. The Payback Framework encourages an
assessment of the knowledge base at the time a piece of
research is commissioned – data that might help with
issues of attribution (did research A cause impact B?)
and/or reveal a counterfactual (what other work was oc-
curring in the relevant field at the time?).
Applying the Payback Framework through case studies
is labour intensive: researcher interviews are combined
with document analysis and verification of claimed im-
pacts to prepare a detailed case study containing both
qualitative and quantitative information. Not all research
groups or funders will be sufficiently well resourced to
produce this level of detail for every project – nor is it
always necessary to do so. Some authors have adapted
the Payback Framework methodology to reduce the
workload of impact assessment (for example, a recent
European Commission evaluation populated the categories
mainly by analysis of published documents [26]); neverthe-
less, it is not known how or to what extent such changes
would compromise the data. Impacts may be short or long
term [27], so (as with any approach) the time window
covered by data collection will be critical.
Another potential limitation of the Payback Framework
is that it is generally project-focused (commencing with a
particular funded study) and is therefore less able to ex-
plore the impact of the sum total of activities of a research
group that attracted funding from a number of sources.
As Meagher et al. concluded in their study of ESRC-
funded responsive mode psychology projects, “In most
cases it was extremely difficult to attribute with certainty a
particular impact to a particular project’s research find-
ings. It was often more feasible to attach an impact to a
particular researcher’s full body of research, as it seemed
to be the depth and credibility of an ongoing body of
research that registered with users” [28] (p. 170).
Similarly, the impact of programmes of research may
be greater than the sum of their parts due to economic
and intellectual synergies, and therefore project-focused
impact models may systematically underestimate impact.
Application of the Payback Framework may include
supplementary approaches such as targeted stakeholder
interviews to fully capture the synergies of programme-
level funding [29, 30].
Research Impact Framework
The Research Impact Framework was the second most
widely used approach in the HTA review of impact

Comment
Payback Framework
Kwan et al., 2007 [67]
(Hong Kong)
Surveyed 205 projects funded by
the Health and Health Services
Research fund; used main Payback
categories and framework processes
Between a third and a half of principal
investigators claimed impact on policy,
practice and health service benefit; liaison
with potential users and participation
in policy committees was significantly
associated with achieving wider impacts
Multivariate analysis of data enabled
identification of factors associated with
impact; however, study relied solely
on self-reported data from researchers
Hanney et al., 2007
[7] (UK)
16 case studies randomly selected
from wider survey of all projects
funded by the NHS Health Technology
Assessment (HTA) programme
1993–2003; survey data supplemented
by documentary and bibliometric
analysis and researcher interviews
Survey showed considerable impact
in knowledge production (publications),
changes in policy (73 % of projects) and
behaviour (42 %); case studies showed
diversity in levels and forms of impacts
and ways in which they arose; studies
commissioned for policy customers
showed highest policy impact
All case studies were written up around
stages of Payback, which facilitated
cross-case analysis; affirmed the value
of agenda setting to meet needs of
healthcare system
Scott et al., 2011 [68]
(USA) (methods) and
Madrillon Group,
2011 [69] (findings)
Assessed impact of National Institutes
of Health’s (NIH) Mind Body Interactions
and Health programme; for centres
and projects: documentary review,
bibliometric and database analysis,
interviews; impact of centres scored
using Payback scales
Findings covered programme as a whole,
centres, and research projects; study
demonstrated that centres and projects
had produced clear and positive impacts
across all five Payback categories; for
projects, 34 % claimed impact on policies,
48 % led to improved health
Payback was adaptable to meet needs
of specific evaluation, covering different
levels; assessment occurred too early to
capture many of the ‘latent’ outcomes
Hanney et al., 2013
[70] (UK)
Assessed impact of Asthma UK’s
portfolio of funding including projects,
fellowships, professorial chairs and a
new collaborative centre; surveys to
163 researchers, interviews, documentary
analysis, 14 purposively selected case
studies
Findings highlighted academic
publications, and considerable leverage
of follow-on funding; each of the wider
impacts (informing guidelines, product
development, improved health) achieved
by only a small number of projects or
fellowships – but some significant
examples, especially from chairs
The charity used the findings to inform
their research strategy, notably in
relation to centres; many impacts were
felt to be at an early stage
Donovan et al., 2014
[71] (Australia)
Assessed impact of research funded
by National Breast Cancer Foundation;
survey of 242 researchers, document
analysis plus 16 purposively selected
case studies; considered basic and
applied research and infrastructure;
cross-case analysis
Impacts included academic publications,
research training, research capacity
building, leveraged additional funding,
changed policy (10 %, though 29 %
expected to do so), new product
development (11 %), changed clinical
practice (14 %)
The charity considered that findings
would help to inform their research
strategy; many projects recently
completed, hence emphasis on
expected impacts
Wooding et al., 2014
[72] (Australia,
Canada, UK)
29 case studies randomly selected from
cardiovascular/stroke research funders,
scored using Payback categories;
compared impact scores with features
of research processes
Wide range of impacts; some projects
scored very high, others very low; basic
research had higher academic impacts,
clinical had more impact beyond
academia; engagement with
practitioners/patients linked to
academic and wider impacts
Payback enabled collection of data
about a wide range of impacts plus
processes/features of each project;
this facilitated innovative analysis of
factors associated with impact
Research Impact Framework
Kuruvilla et al., 2007
[32] (UK)
Pilot study, 11 projects; used
semi-structured interview and document
analysis, leading to one-page
‘researcher narrative’ that was
sent to the researcher for validation
Interviews with researchers allowed
them to articulate and make sense of
multiple impact channels and activities;
the structured researcher narratives,
which were objectively verifiable,
facilitated comparison across projects
Applied a wider range of impact
categories than the Payback Framework;
approach was adaptable and acceptable
to researchers, however, it was only a
small pilot conducted in the researchers’
group
Canadian Academy of Health Sciences (CAHS) Framework
Montague and
Valentim, 2010
[73] (Canada)
Applied the CAHS Framework to assess
the impact of a large randomised trial
of a new treatment for breast cancer;
divided the impacts into proximate
(e.g. changes in awareness) and more
long-term (including changes in breast
cancer mortality)
Numerous impacts were documented
at different levels of the CAHS
Framework; findings suggested a direct
link between publication of the trial,
change in clinical practice and subsequent
reduction in morbidity and mortality
Published as an early worked example
of how CAHS can inform the systematic
documentation of impacts

 Table 2 Examples of applications of research impact assessment frameworks (Continued)
Adam et al., 2012
[74] (Catalonia)
Applied the CAHS Framework to assess
the impact of clinical and health services
research funded by the main Catalan
agency; included bibiliometric analysis,
surveys to 99 researchers with 70
responses, interviews with researchers
and decision-makers, in-depth case
study of translation pathways, as well as
a focus on intended impacts
In the CAHS category of informing
decision-making by policymakers,
managers, professionals, patients,
etc. 40 out of 70 claimed decision-
making changes were induced by
research results: 29 said changed clinical
practice, 16 said organisational/policy
changes; interactions in projects with
healthcare and policy decision-makers
was crucial
The study provided both knowledge to
inform the funding agency’s subsequent
actions and a basis on which to
advocate for targeted research to fill
knowledge gaps; the team noted
limitations in relation to attribution,
time lags and the counterfactual
Graham et al., 2012
[75] (Canada)
Adapted and applied CAHS to
assess impact of research funded by a
not-for-profit research and innovation
organization in Alberta, Canada
After a formal adaptation phase,
CAHS proved flexible and robust both
retrospectively (to map pre-existing data)
and prospectively (to track new
programmes); some new categories
were added
Had a particular focus on developing
data capture approaches for the many
indicators identified; also a focus on
how the research funding organisation
could measure its own contribution to
achieving health system impacts
Cohen et al., 2015
[76] (Australia)
Adapted categories from Payback and
CAHS; mixed method sequential
methodology; surveys and interviews
of lead researchers (final sample of 50);
data from surveys, interviews and
documents collated into case studies
which were scored by an expert panel
using criteria from the UK Research
Excellence Framework (REF)
19 of 50 cases had policy and practice
impacts with an even distribution of
high, medium and low impact scores
across the (REF-based) criteria of
corroboration, attribution, reach and
importance; showed that real world
impacts can occur from single
intervention studies
Innovative approach by blending
existing frameworks; limitations
included not always being able to
obtain documentary evidence to
corroborate researcher accounts
Monetisation Models
Johnston et al., 2006
[34] (USA)
Collated data on 28 Phase III clinical
trials funded by the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke up to
2000; compared monetised health gains
achieved by use of new healthcare
interventions (measured in QALYs and
valued at GDP per head) to investment
in research, using cost-utility analyses
and actual usage
$335 m research investment generated
470,000 QALYs 10 years post funding;
return on investment was 46 % per year
Used a bottom-up approach to quantify
health gains through individual
healthcare interventions; assumed that
all changes in usage were prompted by
NIH phase III trials; no explicit time-lag;
highlights data difficulties in bottom-up
approach, as required data were only
available for eight trials
Access Economics,
2008 [39] (Australia)
Quantified returns from all Australian
health R&D funding between 1992/3
and 2004/5. Monetised health gains
estimated as predicted DALYs averted
in 2033–45 compared to 1993
(valued at willingness to pay for a
statistical life-year)
Return on investment of 110 % from
private and public R&D; assumed that
50 % of health gains are attributable to
R&D, of which 3.04 % is Australian R&D
Top-down approach; high uncertainty
and sensitivity of results in 50 %
assumption; forecasted future health
gains
Buxton et al., 2008
[38] (UK)
Estimated returns from UK public
and charitably funded cardiovascular
research 1975–1988; data from cost-
utility studies and individual intervention
usage; health gains expressed as
monetised QALYs (valued at healthcare
service opportunity cost) net costs of
delivery for years 1986–2005
Internal rate of return of 9 % a year,
plus a component added for non-health
economic ‘spill-over’ effects of 30 %;
assumed a 17 year lag between investment
and health gains (based on guideline
analysis – knowledge cycle time), and 17 %
of health gains attributable to UK research
Bottom-up approach; judgement
on which interventions to include
was required; explicit investigation
of time-lag
Deloitte Access
Economics,
2011 [35] (Australia)
Applied same methods as Access
Economics (2008); quantified returns
from National Health and Medical
Research Council funding 2000–2010,
focusing on five burdensome disease
areas; monetised health gains estimated
as predicted DALYs averted in 2040–50
compared to 2000, valued at willingness
to pay for a statistical life-year
Return on investment ranged from
509 % in cardiovascular disease to –30 %
for muscular dystrophy research;
assumed that 50 % of health gains are
attributable to R&D, of which 3.14 % was
Australian R&D and 35 % of that is
NHMRC; assumed time lag of 40 years
between investment and benefit
Top-down approach; added layer
in attribution problem (because it
was a programme rather than
totality of research funding)

Societal Impact Assessment and Related Approaches
Spaapen et al., 2007
[46] (Netherlands)
Mainly a methodological report on the
Sci-Quest Framework with brief case
examples including one in pharmaceutical
sciences; proposed mixed-method case
studies using qualitative methods, a
quantitative instrument called contextual
response analysis and quantitative
assessment of financial interactions (grants,
spin-outs, etc.). Produced a bespoke
Research Embedment and Performance
Profile (REPP) for each project
Productive interactions (direct, indirect,
financial) must happen for impact to
occur; there are three social domains:
science/certified knowledge, industry/
market and policy/societal; REPP in
pharmaceutical sciences example
developed 15 benchmarks (five for each
domain) and scored on 5-point scale
Illustrates ‘performative’ approach
to impact (column 6 in Table 1);
ERiC (Evaluating Research in Context)
programme, focuses assessment on the
context and is designed to overcome
what were seen as the linear and
deterministic assumptions of logic
models, but complex to apply
Molas-Gallart and
Tang, 2011 [77] (UK)
Applied SIAMPI Framework to assess
how social science research in a Welsh
university supports local businesses; case
study approach using two structured
questionnaires – one for researchers
and one for stakeholders
Authors found few, if any, examples of
linear research-impact links but “a mesh
of formal and informal collaborations in
which academics are providing support
for the development of specific business
models in emerging areas, many of which
have not yet yielded identifiable impacts”
Good example from outside the
medical field of how SIAMPI
Framework can map the processes
of interaction between researchers
and stakeholders
UK Research Excellence Framework (secondary analyses of REF impact case study database)
Hinrichs and Grant,
2015 [78] (UK)
Preliminary analysis of all 6679
non-redacted impact case studies in
REF 2014, based mainly but not
exclusively on automated text mining
Text mining identified 60 different kinds
of impact and 3709 ‘pathways to impact’
through which these had (according to
the authors) been achieved; researchers’
efforts to monetise health gains (e.g. as
QALYs) appeared crude and speculative,
though in some cases the evaluation
team were able (with additional efforts)

Realist Evaluation
Rycroft-Malone et al.,
2015 [56] (UK)
In the national evaluation of first-wave
Collaborations for Leadership in Applied
Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs),
qualitative methods (chiefly, a series of
stakeholder interviews undertaken as the
studies unfolded) were used to tease
out actors’ theories of change and
explore how context shaped and
constrained their efforts to both generate
and apply research knowledge
Impact in the applied setting of
CLAHRCs requires commitment to the
principle of collaborative knowledge
production, facilitative leadership and
acknowledgement by all parties that
knowledge comes in different forms;
impacts are contingent and appear to
depend heavily on how different
partners view the co-production task

 assessment, accounting for seven out of 110 applications
[1], but in these studies it was mostly used in combin-
ation with other frameworks (especially Payback) rather
than as a stand-alone approach. It was originally devel-
oped by and for academics who were interested in meas-
uring and monitoring the impact of their own research.
As such, it is a ‘light touch’ checklist intended for use by
individual researchers who seek to identify and select
impacts from their work “without requiring specialist
skill in the field of research impact assessment” [31]
(p. 136). The checklist, designed to prompt reflection
and discussion, includes research-related impacts, pol-
icy and practice impacts, service (including health)
impacts, and an additional ‘societal impact’ category
with seven sub-categories. In a pilot study, its authors
found that participating researchers engaged readily
with the Research Impact Framework and were able
to use it to identify and reflect on different kinds of
impact from their research [31, 32]. Because of its
(intentional) trade-off between comprehensiveness and
practicality, it generally produces a less thorough assess-
ment than the Payback Framework and was not designed
to be used in formal impact assessment studies by third
parties.
Canadian Academy of Health Sciences (CAHS) Framework
The most widely used adaptation of the Payback Frame-
work is the CAHS Framework (Fig. 2), which informed
six of the 110 application studies in the HTA review
[33]. Its architects claim to have shaped the Payback
Framework into a ‘systems approach’ that takes greater
account of the various non-linear influences at play in
contemporary
health
research
systems.
CAHS
was
constructed collaboratively by a panel of international ex-
perts (academics, policymakers, university heads), en-
dorsed by 28 stakeholder bodies across Canada (including
research funders, policymakers, professional organisations
and government) and refined through public consultation
[33]. The authors emphasise that the consensus-building
process that generated the model was as important as the
model itself.
CAHS encourages a careful assessment of context and
the subsequent consideration of impacts under five
categories: advancing knowledge (measures of research
quality, activity, outreach and structure), capacity-building
(developing
researchers
and
research
infrastructure),
informing decision-making (decisions about health and
healthcare, including public health and social care, deci-
sions about future research investment, and decisions by
public and citizens), health impacts (including health
status, determinants of health – including individual risk
factors and environmental and social determinants – and
health system changes), and economic and social benefits
(including commercialization, cultural outcomes, socio-
economic
implications
and
public
understanding
of
science).
For each category, a menu of metrics and measures
(66 in total) is offered, and users are encouraged to
draw on these flexibly to suit their circumstances. By
choosing appropriate sets of indicators, CAHS can be
used to track impacts within any of the four ‘pillars’
of health research (basic biomedical, applied clinical,
health services and systems, and population health –
or within domains that cut across these pillars) and
at various levels (individual, institutional, regional, na-
tional or international).

 Despite their differences, Payback and CAHS have
much in common, especially in how they define impact
and their proposed categories for assessing it. Whilst
CAHS
appears
broader
in
scope
and
emphasises
‘complex system’ elements, both frameworks are de-
signed as a pragmatic and flexible adaptation of the
research-into-practice logic model. One key difference
is that CAHS’ category ‘decision-making’ incorporates
both policy-level decisions and the behaviour of indi-
vidual clinicians, whereas Payback collects data separ-
ately on individual clinical decisions on the grounds
that, if they are measurable, decisions by clinicians to
change behaviour feed indirectly into the improved health
category.
As with Payback (but perhaps even more so, since
CAHS is in many ways more comprehensive), the ap-
plication of CAHS is a complex and specialist task
that is likely to be highly labour-intensive and hence
prohibitively expensive in some circumstances.
Monetisation models
A significant innovation in recent years has been the
development of logic models to monetise (that is, express
in terms of currency) both the health and the non-health
returns from research. Of the 110 empirical applications
of impact assessment approaches in our HTA review, six
used monetization. Such models tend to operate at a
much higher level of aggregation than Payback or CAHS
– typically seeking to track all the outputs of a research
council [34, 35], national research into a broad disease
area (e.g. cardiovascular disease, cancer) [36–38], or even
an entire national medical research budget [39].
Monetisation models express returns in various ways,
including as cost savings, the money value of net health
gains via cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using
the willingness-to-pay or opportunity cost established by
NICE or similar bodies [40], and internal rates of return
(return on investment as an annual percentage yield).
These models draw largely from the economic evalu-
ation literature and differ principally in terms of which
costs and benefits (health and non-health) they include
and in the valuation of seemingly non-monetary com-
ponents of the estimation. A national research call, for
example, may fund several programmes of work in dif-
ferent universities and industry partnerships, subsequently
producing net health gains (monetised as the value of
QALYs or disability-adjusted life-years), cost savings to
the health service (and to patients), commercialisation
(patents, spin-outs, intellectual property), leveraging of re-
search funds from other sources, and so on.

Page 9 of 16
 A major challenge in monetisation studies is that, in
order to produce a quantitative measure of economic
impact or rate of return, a number of simplifying as-
sumptions must be made, especially in relation to the
appropriate time lag between research and impact and
what proportion of a particular benefit should be attrib-
uted to the funded research programme as opposed to all
the other factors involved (e.g. social trends, emergence of
new interventions, other research programmes occurring
in parallel). Methods are being developed to address some
of these issues [27]; however, whilst the estimates pro-
duced in monetised models are quantitative, those figures
depend on subjective, qualitative judgements.
A key debate in the literature on monetisation of
research impact addresses the level of aggregation. First
applied to major research budgets in a ‘top-down’ or
macro approach [39], whereby total health gains are ap-
portioned to a particular research investment, the princi-
ples of monetisation are increasingly being used in a
‘bottom-up’ [34, 36–38] manner to collect data on specific
project or programme research outputs. The benefits of
new treatments and their usage in clinical practice can be
built up to estimate returns from a body of research. By
including only research-driven interventions and using
cost-effectiveness or cost-utility data to estimate incre-
mental benefits, this method goes some way to dealing
with the issue of attribution. Some impact assessment
models combine a monetisation component alongside an
assessment of processes and/or non-monetised impacts,
such as environmental impacts and an expanded know-
ledge base [41].
Societal impact assessment
Societal impact assessment, used in social sciences and
public health, emphasises impacts beyond health and is
built on constructivist and performative philosophical
assumptions (columns 3 and 6 in Table 1). Some form of
societal impact assessment was used in three of the 110
empirical studies identified in our HTA review. Its pro-
tagonists distinguish the social relevance of knowledge
from its monetised impacts, arguing that the intrinsic
value of knowledge may be less significant than the varied
and changing social configurations that enable its produc-
tion, transformation and use [42].
An early approach to measuring societal impact was
developed by Spaapen and Sylvain in the early 1990s
[43], and subsequently refined by the Royal Netherlands
Academy of Arts and Science [44]. An important com-
ponent is self-evaluation by a research team of the rela-
tionships, interactions and interdependencies that link it
to other elements of the research ecosystem (e.g. nature
and strength of links with clinicians, policymakers and
industry), as well as external peer review of these links.
Spaapen
et
al.
subsequently
conducted
a
research
programme, Evaluating Research in Context (ERiC) [45],
which produced the Sci-Quest model [46]. Later, they
collaborated with researchers (who had led a major UK
ESRC-funded study on societal impact [47]) to produce
the
EU-funded
SIAMPI
(Social
Impact
Assessment
Methods through the study of Productive Interactions)
Framework [48].
Sci-Quest was described by its authors as a ‘fourth-gen-
eration’ approach to impact assessment – the previous
three generations having been characterised, respectively,
by measurement (e.g. an unenhanced logic model), de-
scription (e.g. the narrative accompanying a logic model)
and judgement (e.g. an assessment of whether the impact
was socially useful or not). Fourth-generation impact as-
sessment, they suggest, is fundamentally a social, political
and value-oriented activity and involves reflexivity on the
part of researchers to identify and evaluate their own re-
search goals and key relationships [46].
Sci-Quest methodology requires a detailed assessment
of the research programme in context and the develop-
ment of bespoke metrics (both qualitative and quantita-
tive) to assess its interactions, outputs and outcomes,
which are presented in a unique Research Embedment
and Performance Profile, visualised in a radar chart.
SIAMPI uses a mixed-methods case study approach to
map three categories of productive interaction: direct per-
sonal contacts, indirect contacts such as publications, and
financial or material links. These approaches have theoret-
ical elegance, and some detailed empirical analyses were
published as part of the SIAMPI final report [48]. How-
ever, neither approach has had significant uptake else-
where in health research – perhaps because both are
complex, resource-intensive and do not allow easy com-
parison across projects or programmes.
Whilst extending impact to include broader societal
categories is appealing, the range of societal impacts
described in different publications, and the weights
assigned to them, vary widely; much depends on the re-
searchers’ own subjective ratings. An attempt to capture
societal impact (the Research Quality Framework) in
Australia in the mid-2000s was planned but later aban-
doned following a change of government [49].
UK Research Excellence Framework
The 2014 REF – an extensive exercise to assess UK
universities’ research performance – allocated 20 % of
the total score to research impact [50]. Each institution
submitted an impact template describing its strategy and
infrastructure for achieving impact, along with several
four-page impact case studies, each of which described a
programme of research, claimed impacts and supporting
evidence. These narratives, which were required to
follow a linear and time-bound structure (describing
research undertaken between 1993 and 2013, followed
Greenhalgh et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:78 
Page 10 of 16
 by a description of impact occurring between 2008 and
2013) were peer-reviewed by an intersectoral assessment
panel representing academia and research users (indus-
try and policymakers) [50]. Other countries are looking
to emulate the REF model [51].
An independent evaluation of the REF impact assess-
ment process by RAND Europe (based on focus groups,
interviews, survey and documentary analysis) concluded
that panel members perceived it as fair and robust and
valued the intersectoral discussions, though many felt
the somewhat crude scoring system (in which most case
studies were awarded 3, 3.5 or 4 points) lacked granularity
[52]. The 6679 non-redacted impact case studies submit-
ted to the REF (1594 in medically-related fields) were
placed in the public domain (http://results.ref.ac.uk) and
provide a unique dataset for further analysis.
In its review of the REF, the members of Main Panel
A, which covered biomedical and health research, noted
that “International MPA [Main Panel A] members cau-
tioned against attempts to ‘metricise’ the evaluation of the
many superb and well-told narrations describing the evo-
lution of basic discovery to health, economic and societal
impact” [50].
Approaches with potential for the future
The approaches in this section, most of which have been
recently developed, have not been widely tested but may
hold promise for the future.
Electronic databases
Research funders increasingly require principal investi-
gators to provide an annual return of impact data on an
online third-party database. In the UK, for example,
Researchfish® (formerly MRC e-Val but now described as
a ‘federated system’ with over 100 participating organisa-
tions) allows funders to connect outputs to awards,
thereby allowing aggregation of all outputs and impacts
from an entire funding stream. The software contains 11
categories: publications, collaborations, further funding,
next destination (career progression), engagement activ-
ities, influence on policy and practice, research materials,
intellectual property, development of products or inter-
ventions, impacts on the private sector, and awards and
recognition.
Provided that researchers complete the annual return
consistently and accurately, such databases may overcome
some of the limitations of one-off, resource-intensive case
study approaches. However, the design (and business
model) of Researchfish® is such that the only funding
streams captured are from organisations prepared to pay
the membership fee, thereby potentially distorting the
picture of whose input accounts for a research team’s
outputs.
Researchfish® collects data both ‘top-down’ (from fun-
ders) and ‘bottom-up’ (from individual research teams).
A comparable US model is the High Impacts Tracking
System, a web-based software tool developed by the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; it
imports data from existing National Institutes of Health
databases of grant information as well as the texts of
progress reports and notes of programme managers [53].
Whilst electronic databases are increasingly main-
streamed in national research policy (Researchfish®
was used, for example, to populate the Framework on
Economic Impacts described by the UK Department
of Business, Innovation and Skills [54]), we were un-
able to identify any published independent evaluations
of their use.
Realist evaluation
Realist evaluation, designed to address the question
“what works for whom in what circumstances”, rests on
the assumption that different research inputs and pro-
cesses in different contexts may generate different out-
comes (column 4 in Table 1) [55]. A new approach,
developed to assess and summarise impact in the na-
tional evaluation of UK Collaborations for Leadership in
Applied Health Research and Care, is shown in Fig. 3
[56]. Whilst considered useful in that evaluation, it was
resource-intensive to apply.
Contribution mapping
Kok and Schuit describe the research ecosystem as a
complex and unstable network of people and technolo-
gies [57]. They depict the achievement of impact as
shifting and stabilising the network’s configuration by
mobilising people and resources (including knowledge in
material forms, such as guidelines or software) and en-
rolling them in changing ‘actor scenarios’. In this model,
the focus is shifted from attribution to contribution –
that is, on the activities and alignment efforts of different
actors (linked to the research and, more distantly, un-
linked to it) in the three phases of the research process
(formulation, production and extension; Fig. 4). Contri-
bution mapping, which can be thought of as a variation
on the Dutch approaches to societal impact assessment
described above, uses in-depth case study methods but
differs from more mainstream approaches in its philo-
sophical and theoretical basis (column 6 in Table 1), in
its focus on processes and activities, and in its goal of
producing an account of how the network of actors and
artefacts shifts and stabilises (or not). Its empirical appli-
cation to date has been limited.
The SPIRIT Action Framework
The SPIRIT Action Framework, recently published by
Australia’s Sax Institute [58], retains a logic model
Greenhalgh et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:78 
Page 11 of 16
 structure but places more emphasis on engagement and
capacity-building activities in organisations and acknowl-
edges the messiness of, and multiple influences on, the
policy process (Fig. 5). Unusually, the ‘logic model’ focuses
not on the research but on the receiving organisation’s
need for research. We understand that it is currently being
empirically tested but evaluations have not yet been
published.
Participatory research impact model
Community-based participatory research is predicated on
a critical philosophy that emphasises social justice and the

 value of knowledge in liberating the disadvantaged from
oppression (column 5 in Table 1) [59]. Cacari-Stone et al.’s
model depicts the complex and contingent relationship
between a community-campus partnership and the policy-
making process [60]. Research impact is depicted in
synergistic terms as progressive strengthening of the
partnership and its consequent ability to influence policy
decisions. The paper introducing the model includes a
detailed account of its application (Table 2), but beyond
those, it has not yet been empirically tested.
Discussion
This review of research impact assessment, which has
sought to supplement rather than duplicate more ex-
tended overviews [1–7], prompts four main conclusions.
First, one size does not fit all. Different approaches to
measuring research impact are designed for different
purposes. Logic models can be very useful for tracking
the impacts of a funding stream from award to quanti-
tised (and perhaps monetised) impacts. However, when
exploring less directly attributable aspects of the research-
impact link, narrative accounts of how these links emerged
and developed are invariably needed.
Second, the perfect is the enemy of the good. Producing
detailed and validated case studies with a full assessment
of context and all major claims independently verified,
takes work and skill. There is a trade-off between the
quality, completeness and timeliness of the data informing
an impact assessment, on the one hand, and the cost and
feasibility of generating such data on the other. It is no

Page 13 of 16
 accident that some of the most theoretically elegant
approaches to impact assessment have (ironically) had
limited influence on the assessment of impact in practice.
Third, warnings from critics that focusing on short-
term, proximal impacts (however accurately measured)
could create a perverse incentive against more complex
and/or politically sensitive research whose impacts are
likely to be indirect and hard to measure [61–63] should
be taken seriously. However, as the science of how to
measure intervening processes and activities advances, it
may be possible to use such metrics creatively to support
and incentivise the development of complementary
assets of various kinds.
Fourth, change is afoot. Driven by both technological
advances and the mounting economic pressures on the
research community, labour-intensive impact models
that require manual assessment of documents, researcher
interviews and a bespoke narrative may be overtaken in the
future by more automated approaches. The potential for
‘big data’ linkage (for example, supplementing Researchfish®
entries with bibliometrics on research citations) may be
considerable, though its benefits are currently speculative
(and the risks unknown).
Conclusions
As
the
studies
presented
in
this
review
illustrate,
research on research impact is a rapidly growing inter-
disciplinary field, spanning evidence-based medicine (via
sub-fields such as knowledge translation and implemen-
tation science), health services research, economics, in-
formatics, sociology of science and higher education
studies. One priority for research in this field is an as-
sessment of how far the newer approaches that rely on
regular updating of electronic databases are able to pro-
vide the breadth of understanding about the nature of
the impacts, and how they arise, that can come for the
more established and more ‘manual’ approaches. Future
research should also address the topical question of
whether research impact tools could be used to help target
resources and reduce waste in research (for example, to
decide whether to commission a new clinical trial or a
meta-analysis of existing trials); we note, for example, the
efforts of the UK National Institute for Health Research in
this regard [64].
Once methods for assessing research impact have been
developed, it is likely that they will be used. As the range
of approaches grows, the challenge is to ensure that the
most appropriate one is selected for each of the many
different circumstances in which (and the different pur-
poses for which) people may seek to measure impact. It
is also worth noting that existing empirical studies have
been undertaken primarily in high-income countries and
relate to health research systems in North America, Eur-
ope
and
Australasia.
The
extent
to
which
these
frameworks are transferable to low- or middle-income
countries or to the Asian setting should be explored
further.
