IMPORTANCE Bereavement after spousal suicide has been linked to mental disorders;
however, a comprehensive assessment of the effect of spousal suicide is needed.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether bereavement after spousal suicide was linked to an
excessive risk of mental, physical, and social health outcomes when compared with the
general population and spouses bereaved by other manners.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationwide, register-based cohort study conducted
in Denmark of 6.7 million individuals aged 18 years and older from 1980 to 2014 covered
more than 136 million person-years and compared people bereaved by spousal suicide with
the general population and people bereaved by other manners of death. Incidence rate ratios
were calculated using Poisson regressions while adjusting for sociodemographic
characteristics and the presence of mental and physical disorders.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mental disorders (any disorder, mood, posttraumatic stress
disorder, anxiety, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, and self-harm); physical disorders
(cancers, diabetes, sleep disorder, cardiovascular diseases, chronic lower respiratory tract
diseases, liver cirrhosis, and spinal disc herniation); causes of mortality (all-cause, natural,
unintentional, suicide, and homicide); social health outcomes; and health care use.
RESULTS The total study population included 3 491 939 men, 4814 of whom were bereaved
by spousal suicide, and 3 514 959 women, 10 793 of whom were bereaved by spousal suicide.
Spouses bereaved by a partner’
s suicide had higher risks of developing mental disorders
within 5 years of the loss (men: incidence rate ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.6-2.0; women: incidence
rate ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.8) than the general population. Elevated risks for developing
physical disorders, such as cirrhosis and sleep disorders, were also noted as well as the use
of more municipal support, sick leave benefits, and disability pension funds than the general
population. Compared with spouses bereaved by other manners of death, those bereaved by
suicide had higher risks for developing mental disorders (men: incidence rate ratio, 1.7; 95%
CI, 1.5-1.9; women: incidence rate ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.9-2.2), suicidal behaviors, mortality,
and municipal support. Additionally, a higher level of mental health care use was noted.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exposure to suicide is stressful and affects the bereaved
spouse on a broad range of outcomes. The excess risks of mental, physical, and social health
outcomes highlight a need for more support directed toward spouses bereaved by suicide.

E
ach year, more than 800 000 people die by suicide,1
each person leaving behind up to 60 relatives and
friends directly affected.2 The emotional response to
suicide loss may include shock, denial, anger, guilt, shame, or
relief, and complicated grief might arise.3,4 Support pro-
grams exist but are not broadly available and, to our knowl-
edge, many have not been evaluated.5,6
Stress has been defined as situations in which “environ-
mental demands tax or exceed the adaptive capacity of an or-
ganism, resulting in psychological and biological changes that
may place persons at risk for disease.”7 Psychological stress-
ors, such as bereavement by suicide, might lead to mental dis-
orders such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD), and psychosis as well as self-harm and death by
suicide.8-13 Assortative mating might further exacerbate the ef-
fect of a suicide loss.12 Through various mechanisms, psycho-
logical stress has been linked to physical disorders,7,14,15 such
as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, infections, type 2 diabe-
tes, sleep disorders, and disorders related to alcohol misuse,
suchaslivercirrohsis.14,16-19Furthermore,increasedhealthcare
useandhigherrisksofmortalityhavebeenobserved.12,20Stud-
ies have linked mental health outcomes to spousal suicide and
evidence of an effect on physical and social health outcomes
is lacking.12,21-23 Also, those bereaved by other causes of sud-
den death experience mental disorders.24 To our knowledge,
however, whether any aspects of loss by suicide are worse than
bereavement in general remains unexamined.
The purpose of this study was to examine whether spou-
sal suicide is linked to adverse mental, physical, and social
health outcomes when compared with the general popula-
tion and people bereaved by other manners of death.
Methods
A cohort study design was applied to individual-level data on
all people aged 18 years or older living in Denmark during 1980
to2014(n = 7 006 898).Datafromthefollowingregistrieswere
linked using a unique, personal identifier: the Civil Registra-
tion System,25 the Cause of Death Registry,26 the Psychiatric
Central Research Register,27 the National Hospital Registry,28
and the Registry of Social Pension and Income.29 The unique
identifier is assigned at birth or first entry into the country.30
The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency
and informed consent was waived.
Exposed
People who died by suicide since 1970 were identified in the
Cause of Death Registry using the International Classification
of Diseases, Eighth and Tenth Revision (ICD-8 and ICD-10).31,32
Data were linked to surviving spouses, defined as those mar-
ried, cohabiting, or living in a registered partnership as of Janu-
ary 1 of the calendar year when the death took place, to iden-
tify those bereaved by suicide.33
Unexposed
Two comparison groups were formed: (1) the general popu-
lation consisting of all people in the study population,
regardless of civil status, who were not bereaved by suicide
but could be bereaved by other manners of death (group A)
and (2) people bereaved by spousal death because of any
other manner who were identified in similar manners as
described earlier (group B).
Outcomes
The examined outcomes included mental disorders (any dis-
order, mood, PTSD, anxiety, alcohol use disorders, drug use
disorders, and self-harm); physical disorders (cancers, diabe-
tes, sleep disorders, cardiovascular diseases, chronic lower re-
spiratory tract diseases, liver cirrhosis, and spinal disc hernia-
tion); causes of mortality (all causes, natural, unintentional,
suicide, and homicide); social health outcomes (divorce, chil-
drenplacedoutsidethehome,aneedformunicipalfamilysup-
port, sick leave, unemployment, and disability pension); and
health care utilization. Detailed specifications of the exam-
ined outcomes are listed in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Diagnoses from the Psychiatric Central Research Register
and the National Hospital Registry were used as markers of
mental and physical disorders. Additionally, data from the
Prescription Registry were assessed to identify people with
prescriptions for antidepressants. Causes of death were iden-
tified in the Cause of Death register. The examined social out-
comes were based on data from municipal records and in-
come registers. Finally, data on health care use were derived
from hospital and Health Service registers.
Follow-up
All persons aged 18 years or older on January 1, 1980, were fol-
lowed up until December 31, 2014. People who later migrated
intothecountryorhadtheir18thbirthdayafterJanuary1,1980,
entered the study population on the date of the respective
event.Peoplewereconsideredunexposeduntilthedateoftheir
spouse’
s suicide. Similarly, those bereaved because of other
manners of death were included in group B at the date of spou-
sal death. The follow-up period ended at date of the outcome
of interest, emigration, death, or the end of the study.
Statistical Analyses
We used a Poisson regression analysis to compare the inci-
dence rates among the exposed relatives with those of groups
A and B. Results were expressed as incidence rate ratios (IRRs)
with 95% confidence intervals.
Key Points
Question Does the suicide of a spouse affect the health of the
surviving partner?
Findings In this nationwide register-based cohort study, an
increased risk of mental and physical disorders, mortality, and
adverse social events were noted among people bereaved by
spousal suicide. Bereavement by suicide differed from
bereavement by other manners of death.
Meaning Surviving partners are affected on a broad range of
mental, physical, and social health outcomes, suggesting a need
for more proactive outreach.

Only the first onset of any outcome was considered. Long-
term models assessed the effect of spousal suicide from the
date of bereavement until the end of observation while mod-
els with a 5-year follow-up measured more immediate ef-
fects. Multivariate regression models were adjusted for calen-
darperiod,countryofbirth,age,civilstatus,householdincome
level, presence of chronic physical disorders,34 mental disor-
ders, and self-harm. Time-varying covariates were used while
the presence of mental disorders and self-harm were mea-
sured at baseline. The unit of measurement was person-days
expressed as person-years.
The distribution in risk over time was assessed by calcu-
lating Kaplan-Meier survival curves for a subset of outcomes.
The statistical analyses were carried out using SAS ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Global).35
Results
The total study population consisted of 3 491 939 men and
3 514 959 women who were observed over 79 050 358 and
81 033 322 person-years, respectively. In all, 4814 men (mean
age [SD], 54.0 [14.2]) and 10 793 women (mean age [SD], 49.6
[15.2]) bereaved by a spouse’
s suicide were followed up over
75 683 and 184 863 person-years.
The general population, group A, was followed up over
79 126 041 person-years for men and 81 218 1853 for women.
GroupB,peoplebereavedbyspousaldeathsotherthansuicide,

and6 396 101person-years,respectively.Characteristicsforthe
participants are detailed in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Comparison With the General Population (Group A)
Multivariateregressionsshowedthatpeoplebereavedbyspou-
sal suicide had an elevated risk of a mental disorder (IRR: men,
1.8; 95% CI, 1.6-2.0; IRR: women, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.8) when
compared with the general population (Table 1 and 2). Excess
risks were noted for mood disorders, PTSD, anxiety disor-
ders, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, receiving pre-
scriptions for antidepressants, and self-harm.
Those bereaved by spousal suicide had an increased risk
of cancer, cirrhosis, and spinal disc herniation. Over the 5-year
follow-up,diabetes,cardiovasculardiseases,andchroniclower
respiratory tract diseases were observed significantly less fre-
quently among those bereaved by suicide. Over the long-
term follow-up, increased risks of sleep disorders were noted
as well as an increased risk of chronic lower respiratory tract
diseases among women.
Among those bereaved by a partner’
s suicide, men had
higher risks of dying by any cause (men: IRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-
1.4; women: IRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.3) and men had higher risks
of dying by natural causes (men: IRR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2; wom-
en: IRR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.1) than the general population. A 6-
to 8-fold (men: IRR, 6.4; 95% CI, 5.3-7.8; women: IRR, 8.5; 95%
CI, 7.0-10.5) higher risk of suicide was also noted in the first 5
years as well as a higher risk of death by homicide for women,
while few events were observed for men.
After a spouse’
s suicide, people who later remarried
were less likely to get a divorce than members of the general
population after adjusting for civil status. People bereaved
by suicide were more likely to require municipal-directed
family support and have a child placed outside the home by
authorities. Additionally, extended periods of sick leave
from work, unemployment, and the use of disability pen-
sions were observed.
People bereaved by a spouse’
s suicide were more likely to
be admitted to psychiatric hospitals and attend therapy ses-
sions with privately practicing psychologists or psychiatrists.
Women bereaved by suicide were less likely to be hospital-
ized for somatic disorders and see general practitioners.
Comparison With People Bereaved by Other Manners
of Death (Group B)
When comparing spouses bereaved by a partner’
s suicide with
spouses bereaved by other outcomes in Figure 1 and 2, a higher
risk of mental disorders was observed (men: IRR, 1.7; 95% CI,
1.5-1.9; women: IRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.8-2.2). There was an ex-
cess risk for the following disorders after bereavement by a
spouse’
s suicide: mood disorders (men: IRR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-
2.1;women:IRR,1.3;95%CI,1.2-1.5),PTSD(men:IRR,5.6;95%
CI, 2.7-11.4; women: IRR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.3-5.5), anxiety (men:
IRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9; women: IRR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3), drug
use disorders (men: IRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; women: IRR, 1.0;
95% CI, 0.8-1.3), and deliberate self-harm (men: IRR, 1.3; 95%
CI, 1.0-1.8; women: IRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8).
Spousal suicide was linked to a lower risk of spouses re-
ceiving a subsequent diagnosis of cancers (men: IRR, 0.8; 95%
CI, 0.7-0.9; women: IRR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9), diabetes (men:
IRR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7; women: IRR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5-0.8),
cardiovascular (men: IRR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9; women: IRR,
0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-1.0), and chronic lower respiratory tract dis-
orders (men: IRR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-1.0; women: IRR, 0.7; 95%
CI, 0.6-0.8). Those recently bereaved by a spouse’
s suicide had
elevated risks of dying by any cause (men: IRR, 1.2; 95% CI,
1.1-1.3; women: IRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.5), but the risk was ac-
centuated for suicide (men: IRR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.8-4.3; wom-
en: IRR, 4.2; 95% CI, 3.3-5.2) and women faced an increased
risk of dying by homicide (IRR, 33.8; 95% CI, 22.0 to 51.8).
While women bereaved by suicide were less likely to get
a divorce after remarrying than those bereaved by other dis-
orders (IRR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9), they were somewhat more
likely to require municipal intervention (IRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-
1.5). People bereaved by suicide were less likely to take sick
leave (men: IRR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9; women: IRR, 0.8; 95%
CI, 0.7-0.8) or experience unemployment (men: IRR, 0.9; 95%
CI, 0.8-1.0; women: IRR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9).
An increased use of psychiatric in patient care was noted
among people bereaved by a spouse’
s suicide (men: IRR, 1.5;
95% CI, 1.1-2.0; women: IRR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-1.9) as well as 1
or more appointments with private psychiatrists or psycholo-
gists (men: IRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5; women: IRR, 1.7; 95% CI,
1.5-1.9).Somatichospitalusewaslessforwomen(IRR,0.9;95%
CI, 0.8 to 1.0), while men were less likely to see a general prac-
titioner than those bereaved by other manners of death (IRR,
0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-1.0).

a Multivariate models were adjusted for calendar period, country of birth, age
groups, civil status, household income level, presence of chronic physical
disorders (measured using the Charlson Index), previous psychiatric
hospitalization, and previous records of self-harm.
bAs a person could have been diagnosed with more than 1 mental disorder, the
total number of people with any mental disorder is smaller than the sum of
people with specific disorders.
c The examined physical disorder is included in the Charlson Index, so an
adaptation of the Charlson Index without the specific physical disorder was
used for the multivariate model.

Mental Health
Spouses bereaved by suicide had higher risks for all exam-
ined mental disorders, including deliberate self-harm, when
compared with the general population. While previous stud-
ies have linked spousal suicide to depression and death by
suicide,12,22 the current study extends our knowledge of which
mental disorders might arise after the suicide of a spouse.
Excess risks of mood disorders and PTSD were found
when comparing spouses bereaved by suicide with those
bereaved by other manners. Previous studies of similar
groups are limited to measuring depression.22,24 No differ-
ences were noted for alcohol and drug use disorders, which
suggests that these may be pervasive across all types of
bereavement.36

Physical Health
Spousal suicide has, to our knowledge, not previously been
linked to physical disorders. The excess risks of cancer and cir-
rhosis, as well as sleep disorders and chronic lower respira-
tory tract diseases (long-term), might be attributed to un-
healthy coping styles, such as alcohol use disorder, or a
weakening of the immune system, both related to psychoso-
cial stress.14,37 A spouse’
s death by any cause has previously
been linked to smoking and alcohol consumption.38
The elevated risk of spinal disc herniation could be spu-
rious,however,theassociationremainedsignificantacrosssex
and follow-up periods. Although conflicting evidence exists,
an association between levels of stress, pain pressure sensi-
tivity, and depressive symptoms could indicate an increased
pain sensitivity among bereaved people.39,40 Additionally, be-
reavement is associated with weight loss, and unexpected
weight loss may precede back pain.41,42
A lower risk of some physical diagnoses was noted for
spousesbereavedbyapartner’
ssuicide,particularlywithinthe
first 5 years, although there was an excess in overall mortal-
ity. People bereaved by a spouse’
s suicide might be less in-
clined to seek medical attention for health concerns (eg, being
distracted by their grief to a degree of self-neglect),4 and the
partially lower use of somatic hospitals supports this notion.
Competing risks, as reflected in the elevated risk of mortality,
is another possible explanation.
Mortality
Thosebereavedbysuicidehadhigherrateratiosofoverallmor-
tality than the general population and those bereaved by other
manners. To our knowledge, excess mortality has not been
studied among spouses bereaved by suicide, but has been
shown to exist among bereaved spouses generally.38 Most of
these deaths were natural deaths (men: 81%; women: 75%);
thus, a person’
s neglect of his or her health could be a poten-
tial explanation.
The excess risk of suicide is supported by previous
studies.12,24 Exposure to a loss by suicide might lessen barri-
ers to engage in suicidal behavior.43 Assortative mating is an-
other option,12 which is supported by higher suicide risks
among spouses bereaved by suicide than other family
members.44
The increased risk of dying by homicide is, to our knowl-
edge, a new observation. Although homicides recorded on the
same or following day after a spouse’
s suicide were not in-
cluded, some of these cases might be dyadic suicides.45
Social Health
Increasedrisksofhavingasinglemaritalstatus,lowincome,and
criminal conduct have been reported for parents and children
bereaved by suicide, but we have no information on the social
health of spouses.11,20 The observed lower risk of getting a di-
vorce could imply a more precautious partner selection. The

fewer episodes of taking sick leave days or experiencing unem-
ploymentwhencomparedwithpeoplebereavedbyotherman-
ners might relate to the social stigmatization of suicide.42 The
mean age (>67 years) for those bereaved by other manners of
death implies that only a subsample were working and assor-
tative mating might have increased their rate of absence.
Health Care Use
Increased mental health care use was noted. The reduced
use of somatic hospitals is contradictive to the excess mor-
tality among spouses bereaved by suicide and raises con-
cerns regarding the identification and the treatment of
health conditions.
Clinical Implications
It is important to note that most people bereaved by suicide
do not experience health complications; 1 in 200 spouses be-
reaved by suicide received a diagnosis of a mood disorder com-
pared with 1 in 500 among the general population.
Women bereaved by suicide had less contact with their
general practitioners than the general population, and men be-
reaved by suicide had less primary care contact than those be-
reaved by other manners of death. This is concerning, as pri-
mary care could provide an access point for support and
suggests the need for more aggressive outreach following be-
reavement by suicide.
Studies have linked spousal bereavement to compli-
cated grief.4 Furthermore, this association could be medi-
ated through other mental disorders.46 An elevated risk of
misuse disorders was noted for people bereaved by suicide.
Future research might address whether mental disorders
following bereavement could be an indication of a compli-
cated grief.36

comes illustrates the high societal costs and need for profes-
sional help. Still, most support for those bereaved by suicide is
left for volunteer organizations.49
Strengths and Limitations
Nationwide register data were collected on a uniform basis for
both exposed and unexposed people, which improved inter-
nal validity and avoided recall bias. By including all spouses
bereaved by suicide, the selection bias noted in previous stud-
ies was avoided.24 Longitudinal data on civil statuses and
household identifiers let us identify those living together at
the time of bereavement. Additionally, the large sample size,
thelongobservationperiod,andnolosstofollow-upwereother
strengths.

Limitations include that only people who had entered
a formal union or cohabitation were considered. Danish
suicide records might underestimate the actual figure,
although a recent study noted a good reliability.50 Also,
hospital diagnoses might represent underestimates of actual
incidences.51 The effect of stressful exposures might
be modified through personality traits, individual coping
strategies, the presence of children and social support or
intensified though multimorbidity.52 Although the analysis
was adjusted for relevant covariates, unmeasured con-
founders cannot be excluded. Similarly, type I errors are
possible. The findings are representative of Scandinavia but
might also apply to other countries with different social
structures and cultural values, or different ethnic or racial
composition.
Conclusions
Bereavement following suicide constitutes a psychological
stressor and remains a public health burden. The excess risk
of mental disorders, select physical disorders, mortality, and
adverse social events illustrate the breadth of consequences
of bereavement by spousal suicide. Furthermore, we find in-
dications that people bereaved by spousal suicide had higher
risks of mental disorders, mortality, and mental health care use
than people bereaved by other manners of death. Higher risks
of drug and alcohol use disorder were noted for people be-
reaved by suicide. More proactive outreach and linkage to sup-
port mechanisms is needed for people bereaved by spousal
suicide to help them navigate their grief.
