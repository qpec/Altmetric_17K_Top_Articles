BACKGROUND
Since 2004, a regimen of 6 months of treatment with oxaliplatin plus a fluoropy-
rimidine has been standard adjuvant therapy in patients with stage III colon cancer. 
However, since oxaliplatin is associated with cumulative neurotoxicity, a shorter 
duration of therapy could spare toxic effects and health expenditures.
METHODS
We performed a prospective, preplanned, pooled analysis of six randomized, phase 
3 trials that were conducted concurrently to evaluate the noninferiority of adjuvant 
therapy with either FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or CAPOX 
(capecitabine and oxaliplatin) administered for 3 months, as compared with 6 months. 
The primary end point was the rate of disease-free survival at 3 years. Noninferior-
ity of 3 months versus 6 months of therapy could be claimed if the upper limit of 
the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio did not exceed 1.12.
RESULTS
After 3263 events of disease recurrence or death had been reported in 12,834 patients, 
the noninferiority of 3 months of treatment versus 6 months was not confirmed in the 
overall study population (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 1.15). 
Noninferiority of the shorter regimen was seen for CAPOX (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 
0.85 to 1.06) but not for FOLFOX (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.26). In an ex-
ploratory analysis of the combined regimens, among the patients with T1, T2, or T3 
and N1 cancers, 3 months of therapy was noninferior to 6 months, with a 3-year rate 
of disease-free survival of 83.1% and 83.3%, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 
0.90 to 1.12). Among patients with cancers that were classified as T4, N2, or both, the 
disease-free survival rate for a 6-month duration of therapy was superior to that for a 
3-month duration (64.4% vs. 62.7%) for the combined treatments (hazard ratio, 1.12; 
95% CI, 1.03 to 1.23; P 
= 
0.01 for superiority).
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with stage III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy with 
 
FOLFOX or CAPOX, noninferiority of 3 months of therapy, as compared with 
 
6 months, was not confirmed in the overall population. However, in patients treated 
with CAPOX, 3 months of therapy was as effective as 6 months, particularly in the 
lower-risk subgroup. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
S
ince 2004, oxaliplatin with a fluo-
ropyrimidine has been standard adjuvant 
chemotherapy in patients with stage III 
colon cancer. Three phase 3 trials convincingly 
showed that the addition of oxaliplatin improved 
disease-free survival; with longer follow-up, these 
findings were extended to overall survival.1-5 Ac-
cordingly, a 6-month regimen of FOLFOX (fluoro-
uracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or CAPOX 
(capecitabine and oxaliplatin) became the stan-
dard adjuvant therapy in stage III disease.
The risk of oxaliplatin-based sensory neuro-
toxicity depends on the cumulatively administered 
dose of the drug. Neurotoxicity often peaks sev-
eral months after the last oxaliplatin exposure, 
which makes empirical dose individualization dif-
ficult. Such toxic effects can be severe and persist 
long beyond the actual treatment, which poten-
tially affects patients’ activities of daily living for 
the rest of their lives.6
Given the cumulative nature of oxaliplatin-
mediated neurotoxicity, shorter adjuvant therapy 
would be beneficial for patients and reduce the 
use of health care resources if efficacy were main-
tained. A prospective investigation with a suffi-
ciently powered noninferiority design would re-
quire the enrollment of a large number of patients 
and a small noninferiority margin to reliably 
conclude that the clinical outcome was not mean-
ingfully compromised. Thus, the International 
Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Therapy (IDEA) 
collaboration was formed with the goal of pro-
spectively pooling data from six clinical trials of 
adjuvant therapy involving patients with stage III 
colon cancer to evaluate the primary hypothesis 
that 3 months of FOLFOX or CAPOX therapy would 
be noninferior to 6 months of therapy in the rate 
of disease-free survival at 3 years. Noninferiority 
of 3 months versus 6 months of therapy could be 
claimed if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval of the hazard ratio did not 
exceed 1.12. This margin was chosen on the basis 
of clinical acceptability, since it corresponded to 
a worsening of 2.7 percentage points in the 3-year 
rate of disease-free survival (from 72% to 69.3%), 
as determined by consensus among the IDEA 
collaborators.7
Methods
Clinical Trials and Patients
Established in 2006, IDEA was an academic col-
laboration of clinicians and statisticians who were 
involved in six randomized, phase 3 clinical tri-
als enrolling patients with stage III colon cancer 
in 12 countries (Table 1).7 The trials were CALGB/
SWOG (Cancer and Leukemia Group B/South-
west Oncology Group) 80702 (ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT01150045), IDEA France (EudraCT 
number, 2009-010384-16), SCOT (Short Course 
Oncology Treatment) (NCT00749450; Current 
Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN59757862, and 
EudraCT number, 2007-003957-10), ACHIEVE 
(Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Colon Cancer with 
High Evidence) (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry 
number, UMIN000008543), TOSCA (Three or Six 
Colon Adjuvant) (OsSC number, 2007-000354-31), 
and HORG (Hellenic Oncology Research Group) 
(NCT01308086). The research protocol was ap-
proved by the relevant institutional review board 
or ethics committee at each site and is available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. All 
the patients provided written informed consent.
Each trial investigated the effect of the dura-
tion of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based therapy on dis-
ease-free survival, with patients randomly assigned 
to receive 3 months or 6 months of therapy. Sev-
eral trials included additional features (e.g., the 
inclusion of patients with stage II or rectal can-
cers) or the use of other adjuvant therapies (e.g., 
celecoxib or bevacizumab) (Table S1 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). 
However, this report includes only the findings 
with respect to patients with stage III colon can-
cer. Five of the six trials allowed the use of either 
FOLFOX41 or modified FOLFOX68,9 (fluorouracil, 
leucovorin, and oxaliplatin administered in dif-
ferent doses and methods in the two regimens) 
or CAPOX.3,9 The trial conducted in the United 
States and Canada allowed the use of only modi-
fied FOLFOX6 and not CAPOX. The nonrandom-
ized choice of therapy was made by the treating 
physicians.
Each trial provided individual patient data to 
the independent statistical center at Mayo Clinic 
Rochester. Three trials (TOSCA, IDEA France, and 
HORG) were inadvertently registered in databases 
that were not compliant with the criteria of the 
International Committee of Medical Journal Edi-
tors because of an administrative error, which 
was corrected after 212 patients (1.7% of the 
study population) had been enrolled in the trials.
Primary End Point and Treatment
The primary end point of the six trials was dis-
ease-free survival, which was defined as the time

from the date of randomization to the date of a 
first relapse, the diagnosis of a secondary colorec-
tal cancer after the initial diagnosis, or death 
from any cause, whichever occurred first. The 
doses and delivery schedules of the oxaliplatin-
based adjuvant treatment options have been 
described previously.7 The reference duration of 
6 months was chosen in accordance with piv-
otal trials in which the efficacy of the duration 
had been established.1,3,8-11
Statistical Analysis
We used a modified intention-to-treat method to 
conduct the primary analysis, which included all 
the patients who had undergone randomization 
and had received at least one dose of a trial drug 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
analysis was conducted according to the patients’ 
original randomization assignments. We deter-
mined that 3390 events of disease recurrence or 
death would provide a power of 90% to declare 
noninferiority for 3 months versus 6 months of 
therapy, given the predefined noninferiority mar-
gin at a one-sided type I error rate of 0.025 and 
assuming a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 72% 
in the 6-month therapy group. An independent 
statistician planned and conducted one interim 
analysis for futility (i.e., to determine inferiority 
of 3 months of therapy) using the Lan–DeMets 
implementation of the O’Brien–Fleming stopping 
boundaries. For disease-free survival, we used a 
Cox regression model stratified according to 
each trial to estimate hazard ratios and two-
sided 95% confidence intervals for the compari-
son of 3 months versus 6 months of therapy.
Preplanned analyses included assessments of 
noninferiority of 3 months versus 6 months of 
therapy within subgroups that were defined ac-
cording to the stage of tumor penetration (T) 
and nodal status (N) (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix) and chemotherapy regimen 
(FOLFOX or CAPOX). The proportional-hazards 
assumption for the stratified Cox model was ex-
amined with the use of scaled Schoenfeld residu-
als.12 Q statistics and I2 values were used to assess 
the potential heterogeneity of trial-specific haz-
ard ratios comparing disease-free survival between 
3 months and 6 months of therapy. A P value that 
was associated with a Q statistic of less than 
0.05 was considered to indicate significant het-
erogeneity, and an I2 value of close to 1 was 
considered to indicate an increased degree of 
heterogeneity. Preplanned analyses were not af-
fected by interim analyses of the individual tri-
als. Adjustment for multiple testing was per-
formed if interaction results were significant.
Results
Patients
From June 2007 through December 2015, a total 
of 13,025 patients with stage III colon cancer 
were enrolled in six concurrently conducted 
phase 3 trials. Of these patients, 12,834 met the 
criteria for the modified intention-to-treat analy-
sis. Table 1 lists pertinent characteristics of the 
patients in each trial and in the modified inten-
tion-to-treat analysis. Although most of the 
characteristics of the patients and their tumors 
were similar, some differences were notable 
among the trials. The percentage of patients 
with T4 tumors (in which the lesion penetrates 
to the surface of the visceral peritoneum or is 
adherent to adjacent organs) varied from 12.1% 
(in TOSCA) to 29.5% (in SCOT). The percentage 
of patients with N2 tumors (involving ≥4 nodes) 
varied from 25.2% (in IDEA France) to 32.5% (in 
HORG). Perhaps most important, the use of 
CAPOX or FOLFOX varied greatly. Although 
CALGB/SWOG restricted treatment to FOLFOX 
and only 10% of the patients in IDEA France 
received CAPOX, the majority of patients in 
SCOT (66.5%) and ACHIEVE (75.1%) received 
CAPOX. Overall, about 40% of patients received 
CAPOX, and 60% FOLFOX. Table S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix lists the characteristics of 
the patients and the tumors according to treat-
ment. At the time of the data cutoff (February 
2017), the median follow-up varied from 34.9 
months in CALGB/SWOG to 61.7 months in 
TOSCA. Each trial defined individual follow-up 
intervals.
Treatment Adherence
As expected, treatment adherence (i.e., the per-
centage of patients who received all planned 
therapy) was lower in the 6-month therapy group 
than in the 3-month therapy group (Table 2). For 
fluorouracil and capecitabine, the mean percent-
age of doses that were delivered was 92.4% and 
91.2%, respectively, in the 3-month therapy 
group, as compared with 81.6% and 78.0% in 
the 6-month therapy group. For oxaliplatin, the 
mean percentage of FOLFOX and CAPOX doses

were 91.4% and 89.8%, respectively, in the 3-month 
therapy group, as compared with 72.8% and 69.3% 
in the 6-month therapy group (P<0.001).
Primary End Point
At the time of the database lock, 3263 events of 
disease recurrence or death (96.3% of the esti-
mated events) had occurred. This occurrence 
resulted in a retained statistical power of 89% 
for the noninferiority analysis. At a median fol-
low-up of 41.8 months, noninferiority of 3 months 
of therapy versus 6 months was not confirmed in 
the modified intention-to-treat population (haz-
ard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 
to 1.15; P 
= 
0.11 for noninferiority of 3-month 
therapy; P 
= 
0.045 for superiority of 6-month ther-
apy) (Fig. 1A). The 3-year rates of disease-free 
survival were 74.6% (95% CI, 73.5 to 75.7) in the 
3-month therapy group as compared with 75.5% 
(95% CI, 74.4 to 76.7) in the 6-month therapy 
group. No violation of the proportional-hazards 
assumption (P>0.10) and no meaningful hetero-
geneities (I2<0.26, P>0.17 in Q statistics after ad-
justment for false discovery rate) in hazard ratios 
across individual trials were detected in the over-
all population or in key subgroups.
Adverse Events
A shorter duration of adjuvant therapy was as-
sociated with significantly lower rates of adverse 
events than a longer duration, independent of 
the chemotherapy regimen (Table 3, and Table 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Neurotoxic-
ity of grade 2 or higher during active therapy and 
in the month after cessation of treatment was 
substantially lower in the 3-month therapy group 
(16.6% with FOLFOX and 14.2% with CAPOX) 
than in the 6-month therapy group (47.7% with 
FOLFOX and 44.9% with CAPOX). In addition, 
rates of diarrhea, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
nausea, mucositis, fatigue, and the hand–foot syn-
drome were also substantially lower with a shorter 
treatment duration.
Subgroup Analysis According to Treatment
Although noninferiority of 3 months, as compared 
with 6 months, of therapy could not be confirmed 
in the overall population, prespecified subgroup 
analyses revealed clinically relevant findings ac-
cording to treatment. Among the patients who 
received FOLFOX, 6 months of adjuvant therapy 
was superior to 3 months (hazard ratio, 1.16; 
95% CI, 1.06 to 1.26; P 
= 
0.001 for superiority of 
6-month therapy) (Fig. 1B, and Fig. S5A in the 
Supplementary Appendix), with a difference in 
3-year disease-free survival rate of 2.4 percent-
age points for all stages combined (73.6% vs. 
76.0%). However, among the patients who re-
ceived CAPOX, the hazard ratio for disease-free 
survival for 3 months versus 6 months was 0.95 
(95% CI, 0.85 to 1.06), which met the prespeci-
fied margin for noninferiority (Fig. 1B, and Fig. 
S5B in the Supplementary Appendix). The 3-year 
rates of disease-free survival were 75.9% and 
74.8% for 3 months and 6 months of therapy 
with CAPOX, respectively. The interaction test 
according to treatment was highly significant 
(P 
= 
0.006) (Fig. 2), with a P value of 0.02 after 
adjustment for multiple comparisons. Patients 
who received CAPOX versus FOLFOX had a higher 
rate of T4 disease (24.3% vs. 18.6%, P<0.001), but 
no significant differences were seen in the nodal 
stage, sex, or the number of lymph nodes that 
were examined.
Subgroup Analysis According to Tumor  
and Nodal Stage
There was no significant difference in the ob-
served hazard ratio for 3 months versus 6 months 
of therapy between patients with N1 tumors 
(involving ≤3 positive nodes) (hazard ratio, 1.07; 
95% CI, 0.97 to 1.17) and those with N2 tumors 
(involving ≥4 nodes) (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 
0.96 to 1.19; P 
= 
0.91 for interaction) (Fig. 2). In 
patients with T4 cancers, a therapy duration of 
3 months was inferior to a duration of 6 months 
(hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.31). Among 
all the patients with T1, T2, or T3 cancers, the 
upper boundary of the two-sided 95% confi-
dence interval for 3 months of therapy was 0.01 
higher than the prespecified noninferiority mar-
gin (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.13) 
(Fig. 1B, and Fig. S5C and S5D in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The interaction between the 
duration of therapy and T stage was not signifi-
cant (P 
= 
0.14 for interaction).
Since patients with T4 or N2 cancers had a 
very similar, poor prognosis (3-year disease-free 
survival of approximately 60% vs. 80% for other 
stages), in an exploratory analysis, we investi-
gated the effect of a shorter duration of therapy 
among patients at low risk (T1, T2, or T3 and 
N1 cancers, in 58.7% of patients) and among 
those at high risk (T4, N2, or both, in 41.3%)

Panel A shows the distribution of disease-free survival in the overall modified intention-to-treat population. At a 
median follow-up of 41.8 months, noninferiority of 3 months of treatment versus 6 months was not confirmed (haz-

for superiority), even though the absolute differ-
ence in the 3-year rate of disease-free survival 
was 1.7 percentage points between 3 months 
(62.7%; 95% CI, 60.8 to 64.6) and 6 months 
(64.4%; 95% CI, 62.6 to 66.4) (Fig. 1B, and Fig. 
S5E in the Supplementary Appendix). Of note, 
the interaction between therapy duration and 
risk group was not significant (P 
= 
0.11 for inter-
action) (Fig. 2).
Subgroup Analysis According to Treatment 
and Risk Group
Among the patients with low-risk tumors, 
 
3 months of therapy with CAPOX was noninfe-
rior to 6 months, with a 3-year rate of disease-
free survival of 85.0% versus 83.1% (hazard ratio, 
0.85; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.01). Even among the pa-
tients with high-risk tumors, 3 months of therapy 
with CAPOX compared favorably with 6 months 
but missed the noninferiority margin, possibly 
owing to the number of patients in the group, 
with a 3-year rate of disease-free survival of 
64.1% versus 64.0% (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 
0.89 to 1.17) (Table S5 and Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Independent of risk group, 
outcomes after 3 months of FOLFOX therapy 
were worse than those after 6 months. Among 
the patients with high-risk tumors, 6 months of 
therapy with FOLFOX was superior to 3 months, 
with a 3-year rate of disease-free survival of 
61.5% versus 64.7% (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 
1.07 to 1.3). The results were largely consistent 
among the individual trials (Fig. S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Discussion
The IDEA collaboration was a prospectively con-
ducted study involving 12,834 patients with 
stage III colon cancer who were enrolled in six 
individual trials and randomly assigned to re-
ceive either 3 months or 6 months of adjuvant 
therapy with oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine. 
Robust data were generated regarding benefits 
and risks according to the duration of therapy in 
these patients. As expected, a shorter duration of 
adjuvant therapy was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower incidence and severity of adverse 
events, especially neurotoxicity, but also symp-
tomatic side effects such as the hand–foot syn-
drome, mucositis, nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea. 
These benefits have to be counterbalanced against

any potential loss of efficacy. In this regard, al-
though noninferiority was not confirmed for 
 
3 months of therapy in the overall cohort, the 
difference in the 3-year rate of disease-free sur-
vival between 3 months and 6 months of therapy 
was 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 0.6) 
in favor of longer therapy, which is a difference 
of limited clinical relevance. The definitive body 
of evidence provided by IDEA allows for the in-
dividualization of treatment duration on the 
basis of treatment, patient preference, and dis-
ease characteristics.
Noninferiority of a 3-month therapy duration 
was documented in subgroups on the basis of 
treatment (CAPOX or FOLFOX) and underlying 
risk. For all the patients who received CAPOX, a 
therapy duration of 3 months of adjuvant therapy 
was noninferior to a duration of 6 months, inde-
pendent of disease stage and risk group. For 
FOLFOX, a therapy duration of 3 months was 
inferior to a duration of 6 months when all 
stages and risk groups were combined (Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
The difference in the performance of the 
CAPOX and FOLFOX treatment regimens was an 
unexpected finding. Since no randomization ac-
cording to treatment was performed, no clear 
statement can be made about whether either ad-
juvant treatment was superior. However, in con-
sistent findings across the trials and tumor stag-
es, an additional 3 months of CAPOX did not 
improve survival outcomes. For patients receiv-
ing FOLFOX, a longer duration of therapy in-
creased the rate of disease-free survival, particu-
larly among patients with high-risk cancers. One 
hypothesis is that adherence and the overall dose 
intensity of a 6-month duration of an oral therapy 
might attenuate over time, so that the absence of 
difference between 3 months and 6 months of 
CAPOX might be due to a reduced overall dose 
intensity in the 6-month therapy group. In IDEA, 
the documented dose intensity of capecitabine in 
the 6-month therapy group did not differ sig-
nificantly from that of fluorouracil, but the data 
were not based on rigorous diary-based documen-
tation. An alternative explanation relates to the 
specific dosing schedule of oxaliplatin (130 mg 
per square meter of body-surface area every 
 
3 weeks with CAPOX versus 85 mg per square 
meter every 2 weeks with FOLFOX) and espe-
Figure 2. Disease-free Survival with 3 Months versus 6 Months of Therapy, According to Subgroup.
Among the subgroups of patients who were evaluated for disease-free survival, noninferiority of 3 months of thera-
py versus 6 months was confirmed only in the patients who had received CAPOX (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85 
to 1.06) in the main analysis and in the patients at low risk (T1, T2, or T3 N1 disease) (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 
0.90 to 1.12) in an exploratory analysis. The test for interaction according to treatment was highly significant 
(P = 0.006), but the overall test for interaction according to risk group was not (P = 0.11). The interaction with thera-
py duration was not significant for tumor stage (P = 0.14) or for nodal stage (P = 0.91). The dashed vertical line indi-
cates the noninferiority margin of 1.12 for the upper boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence interval.

Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage III Colon Cancer
cially the fluoropyrimidine regimen (capecitabine 
twice daily for 2 of every 3 weeks with CAPOX 
vs. a 46-hour infusion of fluorouracil every 2 weeks 
with FOLFOX). The protracted delivery of a fluo-
ropyrimidine with CAPOX might have been more 
effective than the twice-monthly infusions with 
FOLFOX as an adjuvant therapy, a hypothesis 
that has been supported in previous prospective 
trials.13,14 Further propensity analyses will address 
potential selection biases regarding the choice 
of adjuvant therapy regimen. Of note, none of 
the patients who were treated at centers in the 
United States received CAPOX. Given the docu-
mented side effects of oral fluoropyrimidines 
among U.S. patients,15 the use of CAPOX in these 
patients will require careful monitoring.
Our exploratory analysis suggests that a risk-
based approach toward determining the dura-
tion of adjuvant therapy may be warranted. In a 
lower-risk group (defined as patients with T1, 
T2, or T3 N1 disease), 3 months of adjuvant 
therapy appeared to be sufficient, especially when 
CAPOX was chosen. In a higher-risk group (pa-
tients with T4, N2, or both), longer treatment 
may be appropriate, especially when FOLFOX is 
the chosen regimen.
Our study has several limitations. The six tri-
als were conducted in heterogeneous settings, in 
different countries, and by independent clinical 
trial groups. Subgroup analyses were performed 
without adjustment for multiplicity. According to 
the study design, we did not test the discontinu-
ation of oxaliplatin at 3 months while continu-
ing a fluoropyrimidine, a common clinical prac-
tice. The study design did not call for patients to 
undergo a secondary randomization to CAPOX 
or FOLFOX, since no significant difference in 
effect was expected. This lack of randomization 
resulted in substantial differences in the use of 
the two treatments among the trials. Also, in the 
six trials, there were no standardized follow-up 
procedures, including intervals of imaging and 
laboratory assessments. In addition, there were 
substantial differences in the duration of follow-
up, so that the contribution of events to the over-
all analysis were not homogeneously distributed 
among the trials over time. Since every trial met 
a median 3-year follow-up time for disease-free 
survival, the 3-year rate of disease-free survival 
can be used as a reasonable estimate for the per-
formance of the drugs in the overall study group. 
Although data on overall survival are not yet 
mature, the 3-year rate of disease-free survival 
has been shown to be a surrogate for the 5-year 
rate of overall survival in a pooled analysis of 
adjuvant trials and is accepted as a regulatory 
end point.16
The data presented here provide a framework 
for individual discussions between patients and 
oncologists regarding potential trade-offs be-
tween side effects and efficacy of adjuvant ther-
apy. IDEA represents an academic collaboration 
with an independent data center, without com-
mercial support. The results are relevant for the 
400,000 patients worldwide in whom stage III 
colon cancer is diagnosed annually and for 
whom adjuvant oxaliplatin-based therapy can be 
considered.
In conclusion, among patients with stage III 
colon cancer who were receiving adjuvant thera-
py with FOLFOX or CAPOX, the noninferiority of 
a 3-month duration of therapy, as compared 
with a 6-month duration, was not confirmed. 
However, the results were strongly affected by 
the selected treatment and risk group. In pa-
tients treated with CAPOX, 3 months of therapy 
was as effective as 6 months, particularly in the 
lower-risk subgroup. In patients treated with 
FOLFOX, 6 months of therapy resulted in a higher 
rate of disease-free survival, particularly in the 
high-risk subgroup. These data suggest that 
the choice of treatment regimen, duration of 
therapy, and characteristics of the patients may 
be balanced against the substantial risk of in-
creased toxicity of longer oxaliplatin-based ther-
apy, including persistent neurotoxicity.
