Abstract
Long-term neurological deficits due to immature cortical development are emerging as a major 
challenge in congenital heart disease (CHD). However, cellular mechanisms underlying 
dysregulation of perinatal corticogenesis in CHD remain elusive. The subventricular zone (SVZ) 
represents the largest postnatal niche of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). We show that the 
piglet SVZ resembles its human counterpart and displays robust postnatal neurogenesis. We 
present evidence that SVZ-NSPCs migrate to the frontal cortex and differentiate into interneurons

 in a region-specific manner. Hypoxic exposure of the gyrencephalic piglet brain recapitulates 
CHD-induced impaired cortical development. Hypoxia reduces proliferation and neurogenesis in 
the SVZ, which is accompanied by reduced cortical growth. We demonstrate a similar reduction in 
neuroblasts within the SVZ of human infants born with CHD. Our findings demonstrate that SVZ-
NSPCs contribute to perinatal corticogenesis and suggest that restoration of SVZ-NSPCs’ 
neurogenic potential is a candidate therapeutic target for improving cortical growth in CHD.
Introduction
Within the postnatal and adult mammalian brain, the subventricular/subependymal zone 
(SVZ/SEZ) represents the largest source of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs)(1). Under 
normal physiological conditions, adult NSPCs in the rodent continuously generate 
interneurons, which migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory 
bulb where they integrate into the existing circuitry(2, 3). However, in various pathologies of 
the developing brain including traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, and seizures, NSPCs 
can exit the rostral migratory stream and migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged or 
lost neurons(4, 5). To functionally replace damaged or lost neurons, SVZ-derived NSPCs 
must proliferate, migrate to the correct site, differentiate into the appropriate type of neuron, 
and integrate into the local circuitry(5). Because these cells retain their regenerative capacity 
throughout life, a more complete understanding of endogenous SVZ NSPCs may foster 
regenerative strategies for the treatment of neurological disorders(3, 6).
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common major birth defect and often results in 
an array of neurological deficits throughout life including behavioral, cognitive, social, 
motor, and attention disorders(7–10). Genetic, environmental, pre-, intra-, peri-, and post-
operative factors are associated with poor neurological outcomes in CHD(11). Severe delays 
in cortical gray and white matter development have been identified in fetuses and neonates 
with complex CHD(12–15); one converging etiology of these impairments includes a 
reduced supply of cerebral oxygen associated with cardiac anomalies(11, 16, 17). Advanced 
fetal brain imaging has revealed reduced cortical expansion and gyrification during the third 
trimester, a period when the brain undergoes robust synapse formation, requiring high 
oxygen demands(18, 19). However, the effects of CHD-induced brain injury at the cellular 
level, specifically during early life when the brain is rapidly expanding and vulnerable to the 
manifestation of neurological impairments, are unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown how 
CHD affects NSPCs within the SVZ, a highly vascularized niche for brain development and 
regeneration(20–23).
Analyses of postmortem tissue have provided insights into the cellular composition of the 
developing human brain, though seminal findings from these studies often require further 
validation in rodent models where cell dynamic studies, genetic manipulations, and 
mechanistic investigations can be performed(24). However, there are strong dissimilarities 
between the human and rodent brain: (i) humans have a highly evolved, gyrencephalic 
neocortex; (ii) 50% of human brain volume is white matter; (iii) the human SVZ has laminar 
organization; and (iv) humans have an expansive outer SVZ densely populated with radial 
glia(25–33). In addition, a limited window of neurogenesis is present in the human infant

 SVZ, and these newborn neurons migrate not only to the olfactory bulb but also to the 
prefrontal cortex(34). Although the importance of NSPCs in the SVZ during normal 
development as well as their response to several pathological conditions has been 
extensively studied in rodent models, there is a need for additional animal models suitable 
for dynamic cellular and physiological studies.
Though non-human primates share some key structural characteristics with the human SVZ, 
direct investigations of non-human primates are often limited in number due to challenging 
technical and ethical scrutiny(35). Piglets are powerful model organisms in which to study 
human brain development because they possess a highly evolved, gyrencephalic neocortex. 
Unlike rodents, the progression of porcine white matter development parallels its human 
counterpart(36, 37). In the present study, we show that the cytoarchitecture of the porcine 
SVZ is similar to the human SVZ. Through multidisciplinary approaches, we demonstrate 
that the SVZ plays a role in gyrencephalic neocortical growth during postnatal life. Using a 
chronic hypoxia model, we challenge the growth of this key structure and confirm our 
findings in SVZ specimens from human infants born with complex CHD to reveal insights 
into the cellular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced brain injury and dysmaturation.
Results
The anterior-dorsolateral region is the most active neurogenic niche in the postnatal 
porcine SVZ
In the human brain, specific differences have been identified in the structural and cellular 
properties of subregions of the SVZ(27, 34). To account for regional differences in the 
porcine SVZ, we first divided this region into four rostrocaudal domains as previously 
described in the human brain(27) (Fig. 1A–E). Within the anterior-end (AE)-, anterior (A)-, 
and middle (M)-SVZ, the SVZ was further subdivided into lateral and dorsolateral regions 
based on studies in rodents(38) (Fig. 1F). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the 
A-lateral-SVZ had a laminar organization composed of four distinct layers (Fig. 1G–I). The 
presence of neuroblasts in layer II and an astrocyte ribbon in layer III have been reported as 
unique features of the infant and adult human SVZ, respectively(28, 31). As seen in human 
neonates, the ventral region of the piglet AE-lateral-SVZ lacked laminar organization and an 
astrocyte ribbon(34) (fig. S1A–D). Within the A-SVZ, glial fibrillary acidic protein positive 
(GFAP+) processes were immuno-positive for the neuroepithelial marker vimentin (Vim) 
(fig. S1E–H). Furthermore, the thickness of the astrocyte ribbon varied as seen in 
humans(27) (fig. S1I–L), demonstrating that the early postnatal porcine SVZ shares 
structural features with the postnatal human SVZ.
During development, two features of the SVZ are evident in many gyrencephalic species: the 
outer-radial glia (oRG), and an expansive outer region termed outer-SVZ(29, 30). Both 
features were present within the porcine posterior (P)-SVZ (Fig. 1J–M). In addition, oRG 
exhibited Vim+GFAP+ processes that lined the lateral ventricle and extended radially (figs. 
S1M–P and S2A–G); this mesh-like distribution has also been reported in human 
fetuses(39).

 We next assessed the proliferative capacity of NSPCs in distinct SVZ regions during 
postnatal development. In the P-SVZ, NSPCs and proliferating NSPCs were less abundant 
when compared to other regions (Fig. 1N,O and fig. S3A–K). The outer-SVZ is an important 
cell source during early human fetal life(30). Within the P-SVZ, NSPCs of the outer-SVZ 
were significantly less abundant and prolific compared with the inner-SVZ (Sox2+: P = 
0.0115; Sox2+Ki67+: P = 0.0009) (Fig. 1P,Q), suggesting that, in contrast to early human 
fetal development, the outer-SVZ is not the predominant proliferating region in the postnatal 
piglet brain.
Because the A-SVZ displayed the most proliferating NSPCs and resembles the human SVZ 
(Fig. 1 F–I,O and fig. S3K), we next determined the density and proliferative capacity of 
NSPCs in different SVZ subregions throughout postnatal development. NSPCs were more 
abundant and proliferative in the dorsolateral-SVZ as compared with the lateral-SVZ at early 
developmental stages (Fig. 1, R and S). However, the number and proliferative activity of 
NSPCs significantly declined with age (Fig. 1R,S and fig. S3L). We found an interaction 
between age and sub-region (Fig. 1, R and S), and there were more NSPCs in the A-
dorsolateral-SVZ than the A-lateral-SVZ at all ages (Fig. 1R). When a neurosphere assay 
was performed to further characterize the intrinsic developmental potential of porcine SVZ 
NSPCs, cells isolated at postnatal day 2 (p2) generated more spheres than at p14 (Fig. 1, T 
and U). The neurospheres generated from the A-SVZ at p2 achieved larger sizes than those 
from p14 (Fig. 1V and fig. S4). Altogether, these findings indicated that the porcine SVZ 
resembles its human counterpart and the A-dorsolateral-SVZ is the most prolific NSPC pool 
during early postnatal porcine development.
The SVZ supplies the frontal cortex with GABAergic interneurons during postnatal porcine 
development
In the developing piglet brain, immunohistochemical analysis revealed several clusters of 
doublcortin (Dcx+) neuroblasts coexpressing the neuronal cell migration marker 
polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) surrounding the SVZ (fig. S5). 
In addition, we identified many elongated Dcx+PSA-NCAM+ cells extending laterally, 
streaming from the SVZ to the cortex (Fig. 2A–C and fig. S6). To better visualize these 
abundant populations of neuroblasts, we developed a protocol to optically clear thick (3 mm) 
postnatal porcine brain slices. Three-dimensional (3D) segmentation and rendering of 
immunolabeled cells revealed complex patterns of Dcx+ neuroblasts (Fig. 2D–H): (i) 
streaming medially, adjacent to the lateral ventricle (Fig. 2E); (ii) clustered in the SVZ and 
projecting/streaming rostrally (Fig. 2F); (iii) throughout the subcortical white matter (Fig. 
2G); and (iv) fanning laterally to the upper layers of the frontal cortex (Fig. 2H).
To determine the destination and fate of SVZ-derived cells, we used focal tracers. Cell-
Tracker Green (CTG) was injected into the A-dorsolateral-SVZ (Fig. 3A) during the 
observed peak of NSPCs generation (Fig. 1R). One week post-injection (1 wpi), CTG+ cells 
were seen tangentially and rostrally through the SVZ (Fig. 3B–D). Further analysis near the 
injection site revealed that the majority of CTG+ cells were present in the SVZ and co-
labeled with the neuroblast marker Dcx (Fig. 3E–I). A minimal percentage of CTG+ cells 
co-expressed ganglionic eminence markers within the AE-SVZ (Table S1). We also

 observed CTG+ cells in the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, and caudate on 
the plane of the injection site (A-SVZ) (Fig. 3F). On the plane of the AE-SVZ, rostral to the 
injection site (Fig. 3, A and D), CTG+Dcx+ cells were seen in the rostral migratory stream 
(Fig. 3J), periventricular white matter (Fig. 3K), and CTG+ cells were seen in the subcortical 
white matter (Fig. 3L) underlying the frontal cortex. In addition, SVZ-derived cells 
expressing the postmitotic neuronal marker NeuN were observed in the frontal cortex (Fig. 
3M), demonstrating that the postnatal SVZ supplied the developing cortex with newly 
generated neurons.
We analyzed long-term migration and cell fate using superparamagnetic-iron-oxide (SPIO) 
nanoparticles that are visualized using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
microscopy(40) (Fig. 4A and fig. S7A). We focused our analyses on SVZ-derived cells 
populating the frontal cortex. SPIO+Dcx+ neuroblasts were detected not only in the SVZ and 
white matter, but also in layers II/III of the frontal cortex at 2 wpi (fig. S7, B and C). Long 
chains of SPIO+Dcx+ cells were also present in the white matter underlying the prefrontal 
cortex (Fig. S7, D and E). T2* weighted MRI scans indicated that SPIO nanoparticles, seen 
as hypointense voxels, were present in several frontal cortices at 4 wpi (Fig. 4A and fig. S8). 
The majority of SVZ-derived cells were seen in the prefrontal (67%) and somatosensory 
(22%) cortices during early postnatal development (Fig. 4B). Several SPIO signals were also 
seen in the piglet brain within the anatomical equivalent of the human ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex (Fig. 4A), a known destination for migrating immature neurons during 
human infancy(34). Together, our results suggest that newly generated neurons migrate from 
the SVZ to specific cortices - primarily the prefrontal cortex.
Based on these findings, we next analyzed the cell fate of SVZ-derived cells within the 
upper and lower layers of the prefrontal, primary somatosensory, and insular cortex. 
Quantification of SPIO+ cells within the upper and lower layers and subcortical white matter 
of the prefrontal cortex revealed that the majority of SPIO+ cells were located in the upper 
layers (Fig. 4C). Because our findings using CTG labeling demonstrated that SVZ-derived 
cells were primarily neuroblasts and GFAP+ cells - as opposed to oligodendrocytes or 
microglia (Fig. 3F–I) - we restricted our cell fate analyses to neurons, interneurons, and 
astrocytes. We found that somatostatin (SST+) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-
expressing (VIP+) interneurons were scarce compared to calretinin (Calr) and parvalbumin 
(PPV)-positive interneurons (fig. S9); therefore, SPIO+ cells co-labeled with NeuN, Calr, 
PPV, and GFAP were quantified throughout the frontal cortex. SPIO+Calr+NeuN+ gamma-
Aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) interneurons and SPIO+Calr−NeuN+ neurons were seen 
throughout the prefrontal cortex and SPIO+GFAP+ cells were less common (Fig 4, C–F). 
SPIO+Calr+NeuN+ GABAergic interneurons were also visible in the primary somatosensory 
and insular cortex (Fig. 4, C and G). Quantification revealed that the majority of SPIO+ cells 
were within the upper layers of the prefrontal cortex (Fig. 4, C and H). Calr+NeuN+ 
GABAergic interneurons within the upper layers of the prefrontal cortex were most 
abundant, with the upper layers of the somatosensory cortex showing the second highest 
concentration of these cells (Fig. 4C and table S2). Calr−NeuN+ neurons within the upper 
layers of the prefrontal cortex were the second most prominent type of SPIO+ cells identified 
(Fig. 4I and table S2). We did not find any SPIO+PPV+ interneurons in our analyses.

 To determine multipotent differentiation potential and assess regional heterogeneity of the 
intrinsic cell fate of NSPCs, we analyzed non-dissociated neurospheres from different SVZ 
subregions. Spheres generated from the A-SVZ primarily differentiated into neurons, when 
compared to the P-SVZ (Fig. 4, J and K), indicating that the rostral SVZ is more neurogenic 
than the caudal SVZ during early postnatal development. Consistent with our analysis of the 
proliferative capacity of SVZ NSPCs (Fig. 1V), neuroblasts were most abundant at 1 week 
of age within the A-dorsolateral-SVZ and abundance declined with age (Fig. 4L and fig. 
S10A–F). Altogether, these findings indicate that the A-SVZ is a source of newborn neurons 
destined to populate the upper layers of the cortex.
Chronic hypoxia in piglets recapitulates impaired cortical development in human CHD and 
reduces NPC proliferation and neurogenesis in the SVZ
To assess the effects of chronic hypoxia on the developing gyrencephalic cortex, we used a 
porcine model of hypoxia injury (fig. S11A). Brains from hypoxic animals were smaller, 
weighed significantly less than controls, and exhibited a significant reduction in cortical gray 
matter volume (weight: P < 0.0001; volume: P = 0.0248) (Fig. 5A–F). Animals exposed to 
hypoxia showed a reduced gyrification index (GI) compared to controls (Fig. 5G–I). The GIs 
of control and hypoxic animals in our experimental paradigm were nearly identical to those 
of normal and CHD human fetuses near the end of the 3rd trimester, respectively(18) .
Similar to CHD brains, the lateral ventricles of the piglet brain underlying the A-
dorsolateral-SVZ were enlarged after hypoxia compared to controls (Fig. 5, J and K). 
Hypoxia reduced the width of the SVZ, the size of the NSPC pool, and the length of GFAP+ 
processes in the A-dorsolateral-SVZ (Fig. 5L–O and fig. S11B,C). We found a significant 
reduction in proliferation in the A-dorsolateral-SVZ (P = 0.0294) (fig. S11D), but no 
differences in cell death within the SVZ in hypoxic brains (fig. S11, E and F). Consistent 
with this finding, we also observed a significant decrease in the number of Sox2+ (P = 
0.0284) and Sox2+Ki67+ NSPCs in the same region after hypoxia (Sox2+: P = 0.0284; 
Sox2+Ki67+: P = 0.0122) (Fig. 5P–U). Similar effects of prolonged hypoxia on the NSPC 
niche were also found in the AE-SVZ (fig. S12A–H), but these alterations were not 
displayed in the A-lateral-SVZ (Fig. 5, R and U), suggesting a region-specific effect. Finally, 
we observed a significant reduction in the number of Dcx+ cells after hypoxia, specifically in 
the A-dorsolateral-SVZ (P = 0.0125) (Fig. 5V–X). Taken together, these data demonstrated 
that hypoxia reduced neurogenesis and progenitor numbers, particularly within the largest 
NSPC pool (A-dorsolateral-SVZ) of the postnatal porcine brain.
Congenital heart disease disrupts the cytoarchitecture and reduces neuroblast numbers in 
the SVZ of human infants
Immature cortical development is common in CHD patients, yet the state of the neuroblast 
supply within the SVZ in this population remains unknown. In parallel with our 
investigation of the hypoxic piglet brain, we analyzed brain specimens from human infants 
who experienced a reduction of cerebral oxygen supply during gestation due to complex 
CHD (table S3). These CHD specimens were compared to specimens from infants born with 
normal fetal cerebral circulation (no CHD) (table S3).

 We analyzed the SVZ underlying the frontal cortex and found a global reduction in the 
average length of GFAP+ processes spanning layer II, a measure of laminar thickness, in the 
dorsolateral (DL-) and lateral (L-) SVZ in CHD infants (n=4) compared to no CHD (n=5) 
(Fig. 6A–K). In addition, we found a reduction in the number of Dcx+ neuroblasts within the 
L-SVZ in CHD infants compared with no CHD (Fig. 6L–T). Infants without CHD (n=4) had 
an abundance of Dcx+ neuroblasts within the DL- and L-SVZ and the density of this cell 
population was inversely proportional to age, specifically in the DL-SVZ (Fig. 6U–V). CHD 
infants (n=3) displayed a reduction in Dcx+ neuroblasts within the SVZ independent of age 
(Fig. 6U–V).
Chronic hypoxia impairs SVZ-derived cellular generation and migration in piglets
Based on our finding that SVZ-derived cells populate the frontal cortex in neonatal piglets 
during normal development, we hypothesized that a reduction in neuroblast numbers in the 
SVZ could play a role in the immature cortical expansion seen in human CHD patients. To 
determine if reduced cerebral oxygenation altered the cortical contribution of SVZ-derived 
cells, we performed cell fate analysis on piglets undergoing chronic hypoxic exposure (Fig. 
7). We assessed the effects of hypoxia on cell migration from the A-dorsolateral-SVZ within 
the AE-SVZ (Fig. 7A–D). After hypoxia, nearly all CTG+ cells originating from the site of 
injection were of the neuronal lineage (Fig. 7E–J and fig. S12I–P), similar to normoxic 
conditions; however, a significant decrease in the number of CTG+ cells and CTG+ 
neuroblasts rostral (AE-SVZ) to the site of injection was noted in hypoxia (CTG+: P = 
0.0253; CTG+Dcx+: P = 0.0051) (Fig. 7K,L). Nearly all CTG+Dcx+ cells co-expressed the 
cell migration-associated marker PSA-NCAM (Fig. 7, G and J), indicating that these cells 
are likely migrating immature neurons. When the effects of hypoxia on the regional 
distribution of SVZ-derived neuroblasts were determined with MRI, SPIO signals were seen 
throughout the forebrain, primarily in the prefrontal and somatosensory cortices in hypoxic 
and normoxic groups (Fig. 7M). A slight decrease in the percentage of SPIO+ SVZ-derived 
cells was observed in the insular cortex, and there were no differences in the overall regional 
distribution of nanoparticles within the cortex after hypoxia (Fig. 7M).
Chronic hypoxia alters interneuron and excitatory neuronal cell populations in the cortex 
and limits cortical expansion in a region-specific manner
To further understand the relationship between immature cortical development and the 
depletion of neuroblasts, we analyzed immature and mature neuronal populations within the 
cortex. We found a significant reduction in the number of Dcx+ immature neurons in layers 
II/III of the frontal cortex after hypoxia, independent of apoptotic cell death (P = 0.0191) 
(Fig. 8A–G and fig. S13A–C), indicating that apoptotic cell death is not a major underlying 
mechanism in the reduction of cortical neuroblasts. When hypoxia-induced changes of 
immature neuronal numbers were analyzed between distinct cortical areas, a significant 
decrease in neuroblasts in layers II/III was seen specifically in the prefrontal and insular 
cortices (prefrontal: P = 0.0345 ; insular: P = 0.0243) (Fig. 8D). In addition, a significant 
reduction in white matter neuroblasts was displayed in the prefrontal cortex (P = 0.0412) 
(Fig. 8H). Together, these findings suggested that impaired neurogenesis within the SVZ 
represents a cellular mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced, region-specific reduction in

 immature neurons in the cortex and that the prefrontal cortex is most affected by this 
pathological insult.
We next analyzed the effects of chronic hypoxia on mature excitatory and inhibitory 
neuronal populations throughout the upper (II/III) and lower layers of the cortex. In contrast 
with the reduced density of immature neurons (Fig. 8D,H and fig. S13A), there were no 
differences in NeuN+ cell density in layers II/III of the cortex between normoxic and 
hypoxic conditions (tables S4 and S5). However, we found a significant reduction in the 
number of mature neurons throughout layers II/III of the frontal cortices after hypoxia, 
paired with a significant reduction in cortical volume (NeuN+: P = 0.0065; volume: P = 
0.0050) (Fig. 8I,J and tables S4,5). Within individual cortical regions, the prefrontal and 
insular cortices had significantly fewer NeuN+ neurons and less volume after hypoxia 
(prefrontal: P = 0.0017; insular: P = 0.0145) (Fig. 8K,L and tables S4,5).
Consistent with our aforementioned findings, chronic hypoxia reduced the number of Calr+ 
and Calr+NeuN+ GABAergic interneurons in layers II/III of the prefrontal cortex (Fig. 8M 
and tables S4,5). There was also a significant reduction in the percentage of Calr+ 
interneurons (Calr+/NeuN+) in the upper layers of the prefrontal cortex after hypoxia (P = 
0.0234) (tables S4 and S5). We found no difference in the number of T-box, brain 1 
(Tbr1)+NeuN+ excitatory neurons throughout the frontal cortex (tables S4 and S5). However, 
there was an increase in excitatory neuron cell density in the upper layers of the cortex, 
specifically the somatosensory cortex (Fig. 8N and tables S4,5).
We found fewer alterations in the lower layers of the cortex after hypoxic exposure, 
including a significant decrease in the lower layer volume of the prefrontal cortex (P = 
0.0093) (Fig. 8O and tables S4,5). We also found a significant reduction in the number and 
density of NeuN+ cells within the prefrontal cortex after hypoxia (cell number: P = 0.0004; 
cell density: P = 0.0205) (Fig. 8P and tables S4,5). On the other hand, there were no 
differences in Calr+ interneurons or Tbr1+ excitatory neurons throughout the lower layers of 
the cortex (Fig. 8Q and tables S4,5).
Discussion
This study addressed the relationship between the SVZ and cortical growth in CHD. We 
demonstrated that newly generated neurons in the postnatal SVZ migrated to frontal cortices 
and differentiated into interneurons in a gyrencephalic brain. We also challenged this process 
through chronic hypoxic exposure, which severely impaired neurogenesis within the SVZ, 
resulting in a depletion of a source of interneurons destined to populate and potentially fine-
tune the postnatal frontal cortex. This pathology limited cortical expansion and gyrencephaly 
and mirrored the brain signatures seen in CHD patients. Consistent with these findings, we 
demonstrated that an even more drastic depletion of neuroblasts within the SVZ – 
particularly the A-lateral-SVZ - of infants born with complex CHD, associated with 
abnormal blood flow essential for cerebral oxygen and nutrient delivery, experienced a 
depletion of neuroblasts within the SVZ – particularly the A-lateral-SVZ. We identified the 
A-dorsolateral-SVZ as a contributor to postnatal cortical development in piglets – at an age

 similar to human infancy - and demonstrated that NSPCs within the A-dorsolateral-SVZ 
region were vulnerable to the hypoxic conditions seen in CHD patients.
Cortical development is a dynamic and complex process and proper cognitive function 
requires a balance of excitation from pyramidal neurons and inhibition from GABAergic 
interneurons(41–43). Little is known regarding the contribution of the SVZ to cortical 
growth in gyrencephalic species during the early postnatal stages of life(44, 45). Here, we 
have shown that the A-dorsolateral-SVZ is a source of Calr+ interneurons during postnatal 
development in neonatal piglets. This study revealed the region-specific contributions of 
SVZ-derived cells to cortical growth during early postnatal life in a gyrencephalic mammal 
under normal as well as pathological conditions. We demonstrated that neuroblasts in the 
SVZ migrated postnatally to frontal cortices, where they differentiated primarily into Calr+ 
interneurons. There is growing evidence to support the presence of neuroblasts in the 
postnatal and adult cortex of the human and non-human primate(46–49). These studies 
commonly report neuroblasts in the upper layers of the frontal cortex, a phenomenon also 
seen in our study. Our analysis performed in piglets supports the possibility that newly born 
neurons seen in the human frontal cortex are generated within the postnatal SVZ, as 
observed in the porcine brain.
Our findings supported the notion that exploration of porcine SVZ development is relevant 
to elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SVZ development in the 
perinatal human brain. In this study, we were unable to define the embryonic origin of Calr+ 
interneurons, as only a small percentage (<2%) of CTG+ cells expressed ganglionic 
eminence markers within the AE-SVZ at this developmental time window. To define the 
fetal origin of interneurons, new approaches will need to be developed in the porcine model, 
such as viral delivery to label specific cell populations within the ganglionic eminences in 
utero and subsequent postnatal analyses. Future advances of such innovative techniques in 
the porcine developmental model should provide a more complete picture of the 
complexities of brain development and pathologies in gyrencephalic species.
There are many spatiotemporal similarities between human and porcine brain development; 
for example, both achieve a maximal phase of brain growth and peak myelination near birth 
(50, 51). The gyrification index of a 2 week old piglet is similar to that of a human fetus in 
the late 3rd trimester(18). The reduction in the gyrification index seen in piglets after 
hypoxic exposure at 2 weeks of age corresponds to the decline in gyrencephaly seen in 
human CHD fetuses in the late 3rd trimester(18). We show that the SVZ of a 7 week old 
piglet shares similarities to the human fetus, infant, neonate, and adult (27–29, 31, 34, 49). 
In the context of neuroblast populations, both the 1 week old piglet and the human neonate 
have an abundance of neuroblasts in layer II of the SVZ. The onset of hypoxia at 3 days of 
age in piglets corresponds to the late 3rd trimester human fetus, and our findings regarding 
the influence of hypoxia at 2 weeks of age reflect the developmental equivalence of a human 
neonate.
Genetic links between abnormal heart and brain development have recently been brought 
into focus(52); cardiac anomalies also reduce the supply of blood flow and cerebral oxygen 
throughout the postnatal period (11, 16, 17). Underdevelopment of the frontal cortex is a

 distinct structural phenotype of the developing brain that is seen in many neonates with 
complex CHD(53). Our study indicates that delayed cortical expansion in a porcine model of 
CHD was due, in part, to depletion of NSPCs within the SVZ. We showed that depletion of 
NSPCs was specific to certain SVZ subregions in piglets (DL- vs. L-) and was associated 
with reduced interneuron populations within particular frontal cortices, primarily the 
prefrontal cortex. In addition our data in human tissue indicated that complex CHD is 
associated with a near depletion of neuroblasts within the SVZ. Altogether, these findings 
suggest that diminished SVZ neurogenesis caused by chronic hypoxia may represent a 
cellular mechanism underlying immature cortical development in the CHD population.
We cannot conclude that the reduction in cortical growth seen after hypoxic conditions was 
solely due to depletion of NSPCs within the A-SVZ and we do not rule out the possibility 
that other factors and sources of NSPCs could play roles in this pathology. Future studies 
focused on NSPCs within select subregions of the postnatal SVZ under normal conditions 
and after different pathological insults will be invaluable in understanding the regional 
heterogeneity of the regenerative capacity of NSPCs. In the present study, we showed that 
NSPCs within the DL-SVZ in piglets are particularly vulnerable at an age corresponding to 
human infancy.
Impairments in executive functions, a set of higher order cognitive functions involving the 
prefrontal cortex, are commonly associated with CHD(54). Our multilevel cortical analyses 
demonstrated that cellular alterations were most common in the prefrontal cortex after 
hypoxia. Hypoxic exposure resulted in region-specific imbalances in excitatory and 
inhibitory neurons throughout the cortex. An increase in excitatory neuronal density in the 
absence of changes in cell numbers in the somatosensory cortex after hypoxia was also seen 
in an ovine prenatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia model of preterm birth(55). Imbalances 
between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the frontal cortex are associated with 
behavioral and intellectual disabilities including attention deficits, hyperactivity, as well as 
learning and working memory impairments(56, 57). Many CHD children are affected by 
such behavioral and intellectual alterations(8–10). Our findings suggest it is plausible that 
developmental defects in interneurons and excitatory neurons play an important role in 
behavioral and intellectual deficits seen in CHD.
Our preliminary findings demonstrated alterations in the SVZ cytoarchitecture and 
neuroblast numbers associated with CHD. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that 
complicated surgical procedures contributed to the brain injury noted in human specimens. 
Postmortem human CHD and age-matched control samples are rare, which precludes 
extensive cellular analyses. The recent developments and expansion of banking and indexing 
human infant and neonatal brain tissue across hospitals will enable these analyses and 
greatly enhance our understanding of CHD-induced brain injury. Additional human cases 
and future studies comparing preoperative and postoperative CHD brain tissues will be 
necessary to conclude that these aberrations in the SVZ are specific to fetal and early 
postnatal cerebral hypoxia.
Our piglet model enabled us to reproduce several pathological signatures of the fetal/
neonatal human brain with CHD: reduced brain weight, cortical volume, and

 gyrencephaly(15, 18, 58). However, our model does not completely reflect the clinical state 
of abnormal physiology in fetal CHD, such as altered cerebral blood flow and 
cerebrovascular resistance. The bilateral carotid occlusion fetal sheep hypoxia-ischemia 
model of preterm brain injury does include cerebral hypoperfusion(55, 59, 60): however, this 
model also requires maternal anesthesia and the surgery induces inflammation. Both animal 
models reproduce brain alterations, such as a reduction in cortical volume, that are similar to 
those seen in CHD patients (55). To our knowledge, there are no well-established, large-
animal, genetic models of severe or complex CHD. Such models will be essential in 
reproducing the fetal cerebral circulation defects seen in CHD. Because alterations of the 
developing piglet brain due to hypoxia are very similar to those observed in newborns with 
CHD, we are confident that many cellular events in the human fetal brain with CHD can be 
reproduced in the proposed animal models. With the growing availability of genetic tools 
such as CRISPR, future studies aimed at generating large animal genetic models are 
achievable and will aid in understanding brain injuries associated with abnormal fetal 
circulation.
Current knowledge of the cellular processes governing unfavorable neurological outcomes in 
humans is primarily associative and indirect. Therefore, elucidating the cellular and 
molecular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced immature cortical growth is not only a 
fundamental research endeavor, but also is vital for the healthcare of this growing 
community of patients; complimentary animal models and integrative approaches that 
recapitulate clinical findings will be necessary to accomplish this goal. Our porcine model 
allows us to gain insight into the effects of CHD on immature brain development at the 
cellular level, and demonstrates that the analysis of hypoxia-induced brain injury in the 
piglet can help fill current gaps in knowledge. Future studies addressing different lengths 
and severity of hypoxic exposure in animals at different ages will be invaluable in 
determining regional and temporal vulnerability and therapeutic windows. There are no 
treatments for immature cortical development caused by CHD or for prolonged neurological 
impairments in this population, which represent substantial socioeconomic and management 
challenges for patients, families, and society(8–10, 61). Our findings indicate that treatments 
designed to protect or restore the neurogenic potential of NSPCs within the SVZ offer a 
promising avenue to improve neurological deficits in individuals with CHD by preventing or 
reversing immature or delayed brain development.
Materials and Methods
Study design
This study was designed to determine the potential deleterious cellular outcomes of 
subnormal cerebral oxygenation commonly associated with complex CHD. Because the 
porcine species shares many similarities to human brain structure and development - as well 
as physiology - we utilized a chronic hypoxia model in the piglet to mimic cerebral hypoxia 
in CHD. We utilized several in vivo approaches to assess the outcome of perinatal chronic 
hypoxia at the macroscructrual and cellular level; in addition, we examined human tissue 
from postmortem CHD patients and controls to compare and validate our salient cellular 
findings in the piglet SVZ. Sample sizes were chosen based on the standard used in the field

 and on previous experience with analyzing similar data sets. Animals were randomly housed 
in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Inclusion criteria for human postmortem tissue was: (i) 
human infants who suffered a reduction of cerebral oxygen supply during gestation due to 
congenital heart disease; and (ii) human infants who did not suffer a reduction of cerebral 
oxygen supply; for immunohistochemistry analysis of Dcx+ cells, two samples (1 CHD, 1 
No CHD) were excluded because of a lack of antibody penetrance. All animals were 
included in this study; there were no inclusion/exclusion criteria for animals. For 
neurosphere analysis: contaminated tissue culture samples were not analyzed; random 
images were acquired and quantified; for differentiation potential, unbiased random 
sampling was performed with a Stereo Investigator (MicroBrightField, Inc.) system with the 
optical fractionator probe. Investigators were blinded in MRI volumetric analysis, SPIO 
analysis, human tissue analysis, and in animal cellular analysis. Full details for the methods 
used for sample preparation, hypoxia studies, and image analysis can be found in the 
supplementary materials.
Statistical analysis
A two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test was performed for single comparisons; data were 
considered significantly different if P < 0.05. For multiple comparisons, a one-way or two-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied with Bonferroni post-hoc test; p < 0.05 
determined significance. GraphPad Prism software was used to run Student’s t-tests and 
ANOVAs. For neurosphere diameter frequencies, an ordinal logistic regression model with a 
likelihood ratio test was performed using International Business Machines Corporation 
SPSS Statistics software, version 23.0 (IBM). P values not listed in the main text are listed in 
table S6; P values less than 5 significant digits are listed as P < 0.0001.
