Abstract 
Catalytic anticancer metallodrugs active at low doses could minimise side-effects, introduce 
novel mechanisms of action which combat resistance, and widen the spectrum of anticancer 
drug activity. Here we use highly-stable chiral half-sandwich organometallic Os(II) arene 
sulfonyl diamine complexes, [Os(arene)(TsDPEN)] to achieve highly enantioselective 
reduction of pyruvate, a key intermediate in metabolic pathways, both in aqueous model 
systems and in human cancer cells, using non-toxic concentrations of sodium formate as a 
hydride source. The catalytic mechanism generates selectivity towards ovarian cancer cells 
versus non-cancerous fibroblasts (both ovarian and lung), which are commonly used as models 
of healthy proliferating cells. The formate precursor N-formylmethionine was explored as an 
alternative to formate in PC3 prostate cancer cells, which are known to over-express a 
deformylase enzyme. Transfer hydrogenation catalysts generating reductive stress in cancer 
cells offer a ground-breaking new approach to cancer therapy.

Introduction 
Catalytic metallodrugs might be able to achieve high efficacy at low dosages and combat 
resistance through a multi-targeted mechanism of action. These are currently unmet clinical 
needs, and a problem for non-catalytic drugs, such as the platinum anticancer complex cisplatin 
[PtCl2(NH3)2], yet platinum compounds are used in more than 50% of current 
chemotherapeutic treatments.1,2 Over the last decade, catalytic complexes of ruthenium,3-5 
iridium,6 and more recently osmium,7 have attracted attention, allowing access to unique 
architectures and redox potentials, with the possibility of avoiding platinum-drug resistance, 
reducing side-effects, and widening the spectrum of activity.8 The development of bio-
compatible catalytic metallodrugs is however subject to hindrance by catalyst deactivation.5 
Unlike metalloenzymes which protect metal ions within cavities of the protein, metal centres 
in small-molecule catalysts are relatively exposed. Nevertheless, metallodrugs have been 
reported to catalyse a variety of bio-orthogonal transformations in cells including C-C bond 
formation and functional group modifications.5 Complexes of ruthenium have been used in the 
deprotection of alloc/allyl-protected substrates,9-11 and to carry out olefin metathesis in cells.12 
Metal-based catalysts have also been used to induce cell damage in the treatment of cancer. 
For example, organotelluride catalysts can generate hydrogen peroxide, inducing cancer cell 
death by oxidative stress.13 Other complexes containing amino-terminal copper/nickel binding 
motifs can selectively cleave G-quadruplex telomeric DNA, inducing apoptosis in cancer 
cells.14 We have recently reported the reduction of the cofactor nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH inside cancer cells using non-chiral ruthenium5 and rhodium15 
catalysts [M(arene)Cl(TsEn)], TsEn = N-tosyl-ethylenediamine. This new approach to killing 
cancer cells targets their inherent redox vulnerability, which results from dysfunctional 
mitochondria. Molecular mimics of NADH can be regenerated by iridium ‘piano-stool’ 
catalysts in aqueous media and, in tandem with a NADH-dependent enzymatic reaction, yield 
 3 
 
chiral products with high conversion and enantiomeric excess.16 Artificial transfer 
hydrogenation enzymes have been developed by Ward et al by introducing biotinylated 
iridium,17 ruthenium3 and rhodium18 piano-stool complexes within streptavidin to achieve high 
enantioselectivity for the reduction of prochiral imines and ketones, but have not been used to 
reduce intracellular targets directly. We now show for the first time that asymmetric transfer 
hydrogenation of pyruvate to D-lactate can be achieved in both model aqueous systems, and in 
cancer cells, using a novel synthetic chiral organo-osmium catalyst and sodium formate as a 
hydride source. 
 
Results 
A successful catalyst for use in cells must be highly stable with respect to deactivation in the 
complex chemical environment of the cell. Transfer hydrogenation reactions are commonly 
achieved using bifunctional catalysts, such as the tosyl diamine complexes of ruthenium, 
rhodium or iridium reported by Noyori and co-workers.19-22 Such catalysts can transfer 
hydrogen from a donor molecule (formic acid) to an acceptor (ketone) with high 
enantioselectivity. However, they require first the dissociation of a chloride ligand from the 
pre-catalyst. We recently reported chiral 16-electron osmium(II) complexes (Figure 1), 
analogous to the Noyori ruthenium(II) complexes, which are highly stable even in the 
catalytically-active 16-electron state, and have comparable efficiency to Ru(II) compounds.23 
As well as stability upon isolation and storage, we now find that these osmium complexes are 
particularly stable in aqueous media (phosphate-buffered saline) and also in DMSO, as studied 
by UV-visible and 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2b and Supplementary Figure 4). This high 
stability suggested that it may be possible to deliver intact active organo-osmium catalysts 
inside cells and for them to remain functional in order to carry out catalytic reactions. 
 4 
 
A series of sulfonyl-substituted p-cymene complexes (3-6) was synthesised with the view to 
optimise both catalytic and biological activities. The complexes retained the high stability of 
parent tosyl compound 2 in DMSO (Supplementary Figure 4) and biological media (Figure 
2b), however catalytic efficiencies also remained very similar for the reduction of 
acetophenone, a widely-used test substrate in transfer hydrogenation (Table 1). Interestingly, 
all osmium complexes reduced acetophenone at higher rates (up to 3.5 × maximum turnover 
frequency, TOFmax) than the Noyori Ru catalyst (9) under identical conditions (Table 1). As an 
alternative approach to increase biological activity, the arene substituent (p-cymene) was 
exchanged for extended arenes (biphenyl and m-terphenyl) which increase the lipophilicity of 
piano-stool structures. Increased lipophilicity usually promotes increased uptake of 
metallodrugs by cells, hence increasing anticancer activity.24 Single crystals of both 
enantiomers of biphenyl complex 7 suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained as chloroform 
solvates (Figure 1b and Supplementary Figures 1-2). These confirmed the 16-electron nature 
of the catalysts, and are similar to those of 2.23   
The antiproliferative activities of complexes 2-8 against A2780 cancer cells ranged from 
moderate to high (IC50 = 4-30 µM) and were not statistically different between enantiomers 
(Table 1). The antiproliferative activity of 2 was re-determined after 24 h incubation in RPMI-
1640 medium and did not differ significantly from the activity determined with freshly-
prepared solutions, suggesting that p-cymene complex 2 remains highly stable in the cell 
culture medium. Total Os accumulation (ng Os × 106 cells) in A2780 cancer cells after 24 h 
drug exposure ranged from 4.8 to 31.9 ng Os  106 cells (Supplementary Table 3). Further 
studies showed that the efflux of R,R-2 occurred only slowly, and significant amounts of Os 
still remain in cells after 72 h (ca. 15 % of total Os; Supplementary Figure 5 and Supplementary 
Table 5). As a measure of hydrophobicity, partition coefficients (Log P) were also determined 
for complexes 2-8, and range from 0.18 to 2.3 (Supplementary Table 3), and increase with 
 5 
 
arene extension: p-cymene < biphenyl < m-terphenyl, as expected. In addition, there is an 
evident correlation between antiproliferative activities, or total metal accumulation, and 
partition coefficients (Pearson’s r = -0.92 and r = 0.77 respectively) for the sulfonamide series 
2-8 (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7).  
Cell fractionation experiments using A2780 cancer cells treated with complex 2 provided 
evidence for the presence of Os in the cytoplasmic (47 ± 2 %) and membrane/organelle (48 ± 
3 %) fractions, Supplementary Table 4). Cell cycle analysis of A2780 cancer cells 
(Supplementary Table 6), induction of apoptosis (Supplementary Table 7), and membrane 
integrity (Supplementary Table 8) were assessed after 24 h drug exposure to compound 2. The 
complex caused G1 arrest in A2780 cancer cells, but did not induce apoptosis, nor was the 
cellular membrane compromised by exposure to the osmium catalyst. The experiment was 
repeated to include 72 h of cell recovery time after drug exposure, but the results were not 
statistically different (Supplementary Tables 6-8). 
The stability, high cellular metal accumulation (30 ± 2 ng Os × 106 cells) and relatively low 
cytotoxicity (15.5 ± 0.5 μM) made complex 2 a suitable candidate for in-cell catalysis studies, 
as a high cytoplasmic drug availability could be achieved (ca. 50 % of total accumulated Os, 
Supplementary Table 4) without causing cell death before initiation of catalysis. There appear 
to be no reports of the asymmetric reduction of the pro-chiral biomolecule pyruvate, a key 
metabolite in cells, by an external synthetic catalyst (Figure 2a). We first explored the reduction 
of pyruvate in formic acid using each enantiomer of complex 2; confirming the formation of 
lactate by 1H-NMR (Figure 2c). We then repeated the experiment in phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS), using sodium formate as a hydride source to model our cell experiments. The rate (TOF 
/ h-1) of catalysis in aqueous medium was monitored by 1H-NMR, and was found to be highly 
dependent on the concentration of formate; giving ca. 10× rate enhancement upon increasing 
formate concentration from 2 mol equiv. to 15 mol  equiv. compared to pyruvate concentration 
 6 
 
(Supplementary Figure 8, Supplementary Table 9). To determine enantiomeric excess, the 
concentrations of each enantiomer of lactate were determined using enantio-specific enzymatic 
assay kits. Remarkably, the catalysts retained asymmetric activity, and a large enantiomeric 
excess was generated using each catalyst (e.e. = 83 %). (R,R)-2 formed D-lactate, and (S,S)-2 
formed L-lactate, respectively (Figure 2d, Supplementary Table 10).  
After the successful catalysis by osmium of the asymmetric reduction of pyruvate in the model 
aqueous system with high enantioselectivity, we investigated whether the reduction could be 
detected in cancer cells. A2780 human ovarian cancer cells were exposed to equipotent 
concentrations of 2 or 7 (arene = p-cymene or biphenyl, respectively) together with a non-toxic 
concentration of sodium formate (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 11) as a hydride source. 
Sodium formate significantly enhanced (P<0.01) the activities of the complexes in A2780 
cancer cells by up to 13×. The decrease of cell proliferation with increase in formate 
concentration was similar for both enantiomers of p-cymene complex 2, and unaffected for 
cells treated with sodium formate alone. Sodium formate did not significantly affect the degree 
of cellular accumulation of osmium in cells treated with either complex 2 or 7 (P>0.77; Figure 
3a, Supplementary Table 13). We investigated selectivity in non-cancerous cells from the same 
tissue type (HOF human ovarian fibroblasts, Figure 3c) as well as normal cells from a different 
tissue (MRC5 lung fibroblasts, Figure 3d) using equimolar drug concentrations as in 
experiments with A2780 cells. Proliferation in both ovarian and lung primary fibroblasts was 
not significantly affected at the 95% confidence level, suggesting that such an anticancer 
treatment could selectively kill ovarian cancer cells with respect to healthy cells. Catalyst co-
administration with sodium acetate instead of formate was also studied, but acetate had no 
effect on the activity of the complexes (Figure 3b, Supplementary Table 12). This is consistent 
with formate, but not acetate, being able to act as a hydride donor to the osmium catalyst.  
 7 
 
Induction of apoptosis and membrane integrity in A2780 cancer cells were re-assessed upon 
co-administration of complex 2 with sodium formate (2 mM) and did not statistically differ 
from experiments conducted without formate (Supplementary Tables 7-8). Cells treated with 
osmium complex 2 and sodium formate exhibited slightly increased G1 cell cycle arrest 
(Supplementary Table 6). 
We also explored the possibility of substituting sodium formate by N-formylmethionine (fMet), 
a formate precursor and substrate for the enzyme peptide deformylase (PDF), which is 
overexpressed in some cancer cell lines, including PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Cleavage 
of fMet by peptide deformylase in cells would be expected to generate formate as hydride 
donor and co-catalyst.  IC50 values for complex 2 and 7 in PC3 cells were found to be similar 
to those determined in A2780 cancer cells (Supplementary Table 3).  Co-administration of 
osmium catalyst with N-formylmethionine to PC3 cells achieved a ca. 20% reduction in 
normalised proliferation relative to the normalised cells treated with only osmium complex 2, 
without N-formylmethionine (Supplementary Table 14). Conversely, co-administration of N-
acetyl-methionine (which cannot release formate) in place of formylmethionine, had no 
significant effect on cellular proliferation (Supplementary Table 14).  
Potentiation of the antiproliferative activity of complexes 2 and 7 with non-toxic concentrations 
of sodium formate suggested that the drugs are likely to act as catalysts inside cells. Next we 
determined whether osmium-catalysed transfer hydrogenation inside cells occurs with high 
enantioselectivity, as observed in model experiments. In nature, pyruvate is selectively reduced 
to L-lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in the cytosol. D-lactate is also present in 
cells, but only at low concentrations,25 and therefore increased D-lactate levels are readily 
identifiable. A2780 cancer cells were exposed to each enantiomer of complex 2, in the presence 
or absence of sodium formate, and intracellular D-lactate concentrations were determined using 
an enantioselective assay kit. The combination of R,R-2 and sodium formate significantly 
 8 
 
enhanced the concentration of D-lactate in cells relative to the Os-free controls (P<0.02) and 
R,R-2 without formate (P=0.0474), whereas sodium formate alone did not increase the 
intracellular concentration (P=0.7259). Interestingly, R,R-2 produced significantly higher 
levels of D-lactate than S,S-2 (P=0.0452; Figure 4a, Supplementary Tables 15 and 16), 
suggesting that the enantioselectivity of lactate reduction observed in the aqueous model is 
maintained in vitro.  
The extracellular D-lactate concentration was also determined (Supplementary Figure 8 and 
Supplementary Table 17), and was not influenced by either enantiomer of catalyst in the 
presence or absence of formate, or in the catalyst-free control (P>0.1; Supplementary Table 18 
for full statistical analysis). These results are a clear indication that the reduction of pyruvate 
to D-lactate by catalyst R,R-2 occurs intracellularly. 
 
Discussion 
Platinum-based therapies are typically DNA-targeting and provide little specific differentiation 
between cancer cells and healthy cells. New chemotherapies that target biochemical traits that 
are unique to cancer cells might have significant advantages. Our work recognizes two key 
vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Firstly, glycolysis is up-regulated in cancer cells (resulting in 
increased lactate accumulation, a phenomenon known as the Warburg Effect).26 Lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyses the inter-conversion of pyruvate and lactate,27 and its 
overexpression in cancer cells has been linked to a high likelihood of metastases, and poor 
clinical prognosis.28,29 Catalysing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate with an external 
synthetic catalyst and hydride source threatens the ability of cancer cells to harness energy and 
essential metabolites, such as NAD+. Secondly, cancer cells are under redox stress due to the 
metabolic demands of rapid proliferation.30 In contrast to cancer cells, healthy proliferating 
 9 
 
cells have fully-functional mitochondria, and can recover from redox stress, and avoid 
damage.31 Performing transfer hydrogenation reactions inside cancer cells can therefore 
perturb the delicate redox balance.  
Complexes of the third-row transition low-spin 5d6 metal ion Os(II) are usually more 
kinetically inert than those of the second-row ion Ru(II); for example hydrolysis of the 
ethylenediamine (En) complex [Os(biphenyl)(En)Cl]+ is ca. 40× slower than for Ru(II), despite 
both being isostructural.32 Such behaviour and expectation of a less favorable catalytic 
performance may have previously deterred studies of osmium arene catalysts, but are likely to 
be favourable when considering the delivery of an active catalyst to cells, without deactivation. 
Osmium catalyst 2 displays properties which are compatible with biological use, including high 
stability both in aqueous solution and in the presence of DMSO, and the absence of degradation 
or inactivation by components of cell culture media over a 24 h period (310 K). Interestingly, 
osmium catalysis of acetophenone reduction occurs more rapidly than that of the Noyori-type 
ruthenium pre-catalysts, from which chloride must first dissociate to generate the active 
catalyst. Even after allowing the Ru(II) active catalyst to form in situ, the efficiency of the 
Os(II) complexes is higher than that of the ruthenium catalysts under identical conditions.  
The established anticancer compound cisplatin, and traditional organo-metallic ‘piano-stool’ 
chlorido complexes, undergo activation by hydrolysis of a metal-halide bond as a crucial step 
in their mechanism of action,33-35 but such an activation step is not required for activity of the 
16-electron osmium catalysts used here. Cellular accumulation experiments demonstrate that 
complexes with higher hydrophobicity exhibit increased cellular osmium accumulation, as well 
as higher potency towards cancer cells (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). The cellular 
distribution of Os studied for complex 2 showed that ca. 50% of the total osmium accumulated 
is present in the cytoplasm. However, the detection of osmium by ICP-MS does not give 
information regarding the speciation of the metal complex (i.e. cannot distinguish between 
 10 
 
intact and poisoned catalyst). Interactions with cellular proteins and small biomolecules36 are 
likely to cause catalyst deactivation and therefore the effective concentration of active catalyst 
in the cytosol is likely to be significantly lower.  
Co-administration of an osmium complex (2 or 7) with increasing concentrations of sodium 
formate significantly decreased proliferation of A2780 cancer cells (P<0.001, Figure 3a). No 
significant change in cellular proliferation was observed in osmium-free experiments, 
indicating that the potency increase requires both osmium complex and formate. Experiments 
using acetate in place of formate showed no decrease in proliferation suggesting that hydride 
transfer from formate to osmium and catalytic hydrogenation is involved. Even at 0.5 mM, 
formate is in molar excess of the osmium complex, and therefore further increases in osmium 
potency at formate concentrations (Figure 3a) suggests that the mechanism of action is 
catalytic. The accumulation of osmium in cancer cells is not significantly affected by co-
administration of sodium formate. Hence, decreased proliferation is not the result of increased 
osmium uptake (Figure 3a). Rather, increased potency can be attributed to a synergistic effect, 
in particular in-cell catalysis, involving both the osmium complex and formate. Importantly, 
we observed significant selectivity of antiproliferative activity towards ovarian cancer cells 
compared to healthy ovarian or lung cells. Modulation of antiproliferative activity by co-
administration of the complexes with sodium formate was significantly more pronounced in 
A2780 cancer cells (ca. 85% decrease) than in MRC5 lung fibroblasts (ca. 15% decrease) and 
HOF ovarian fibroblasts (ca. 5% decrease). 
The induction of apoptosis and membrane integrity in A2780 cancer cells treated with complex 
2 did not differ in the presence of sodium formate (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Co-
administration of formate increased the population of cells in G1 cell cycle arrest 
(Supplementary Table 6). These data suggest that co-administration of formate does not change 
the mechanism of action, but instead enhances the effect. G1 arrest has been associated as an 
 11 
 
anti-apoptotic response to metabolic stress.37 Together, these experiments suggest a highly 
cytostatic component of the mechanism of action (which is enhanced by the presence of 
formate). Existing platinum-based therapies induce apoptosis in cancer cells, which exhibit 
S/G2M arrest resulting from DNA damage.2,38 Considering the low nuclear accumulation of 
osmium and absence of S/G2M cell cycle arrest, it seems likely that DNA damage is not 
involved in the mechanism of action of the sulfonamide complexes, which therefore differs 
significantly from that of Pt drugs.  
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of the use of a Noyori-type transfer 
hydrogenation catalyst to convert pyruvate to lactate, and importantly, the first demonstration 
of the enantioselective reduction of pyruvate by an external synthetic catalyst inside cells. D-
lactate is produced in cytosol of cells by the glyoxylase pathway,39 and is present only at low 
concentrations, compared to the major enantiomer, L-lactate. Additional D-lactate produced 
using the osmium complexes was therefore readily detected. R,R-2 in combination with 
formate, produced significantly higher levels of D-lactate in cells than R,R-2 without formate 
(P=0.0474; Figure 4a), showing that the enantioselectivity of reduction is maintained inside 
cells. In the earliest molecular modelling studies on the Noyori catalysts, a concerted transition 
state for hydrogen transfer was proposed, with enantioselectivity attributed to a favourable 
interaction between an aromatic ring in the substrate and the η6-arene of the catalyst (‘C-H---
‘ interaction), with additional contributions from dispersion and steric effects.40,41 In more 
recent studies, including the specific involvement of solvent, the mechanism has been shown 
to be more likely stepwise in nature, with additional destabilisation of the disfavoured transition 
state by an unfavourable interaction with the SO2 group on the ligand.42-44 Other studies have 
revealed that multiple oxygen atoms in a substrate can engage in a process similar to the C-H-
-- interaction, i.e. where the electron-rich oxygen atoms take the place of the arene, in 
enantioselective reductions with Noyori catalysts.45 Although we do not have direct evidence 
 12 
 
for the proposed transition state, the absolute sense of reduction of pyruvate suggests that the 
carboxylate fulfils the same role as the electron-rich arene or multiple oxygen atoms in the 
substrate by engaging in a similar favourable interaction with the H atoms on the 6-arene 
ligand (Figure 4b).  
Whereas the intracellular D-lactate concentration was significantly modulated after treatment 
with R,R-2 and formate, the extracellular D-lactate concentration was unaffected. Also osmium 
efflux from cells occurs only slowly (compared for example with some Ru complexes11), and 
therefore these data are indicative of in-cell reduction, as opposed to on-cell catalysis (which 
would involve efflux of pyruvate into the extracellular matrix containing the catalyst and 
formate, followed by uptake of D-lactate, since pyruvate is not present in the culture medium). 
Determination of the catalyst turnover number (TON) inside cells is complicated by several 
factors. The rate of transfer hydrogenation is limited by the available formate concentration, as 
shown in the model aqueous system (Supplementary Table 9). Also, the effective active 
concentration of catalysts is likely to be lowered by interactions with other biomolecules, 
including proteins. If for example a 5% availability of active catalyst is assumed, then the TON 
would be ca. 13.  
Lactate production is unlikely to be the direct cause of cell death, since neither D- or L-lactate 
were not toxic to cells up to 2 mM (Supplementary Table 2). However, cells are dynamic 
systems, and therefore, perturbing local concentrations of either lactate enantiomer (or 
depletion of pyruvate) even at low levels might have a major effect on cell pathways, 
particularly if lactate can act as a strong inhibitor of other pathways (binding constant in 
micromolar or lower range).46 Furthermore, it is possible that other unsaturated substrates may 
also be targeted by the Os catalyst, yielding a multi-targeted mechanism of action for the drug. 
Importantly, the experiments described here demonstrate that enantiomerically-selective 
 13 
 
reduction of pyruvate to lactate can be achieved in cells, which now becomes a new cellular 
target worthy of further exploration. 
 
Conclusion 
We have shown that novel organo-osmium catalysts which are highly stable in aqueous media 
show promise not only as highly active transfer hydrogenation catalysts that out-perform 
ruthenium analogues under similar conditions, but also as cancer-cell-selective asymmetric 
catalysts with novel mechanisms of anticancer activity. Such new design concepts provide wide 
scope for further research into bio-compatible metallo-catalysts for use in the treatment of 
disease. Our work appears to provide the first example of both aqueous, and in-cell asymmetric 
transfer hydrogenation of pyruvate, with high enantioselectivity. Our studies demonstrate that 
an external catalyst may be used to produce a specific lactate enantiomer inside cells, 
depending on the chosen configuration of the catalyst chirality. Effective co-administration of 
catalyst and reducing agent might be achieved using nanoparticle encapsulation or polymeric 
micelles. Additionally, the use of formylmethionine as a hydride source is of great interest, as 
it can release formate when catabolised by the deformylase enzyme, which is overexpressed in 
certain cancer cells. Interactions of chiral biomolecules with enantioselective enzymes are 
crucial to cell metabolism and survival, and manipulation of enantiomeric ratios inside cells 
could provide a new strategy for fighting intractable diseases. 
 
Experimental 
Methods 
 14 
 
The synthesis of sulfonamide ligands, osmium dimers and complexes, the instrumentation 
used, additional methods and numerical data are described in the Supplementary Information. 
 
Catalytic reductions in cell-free aqueous media. Osmium complexes R,R-2 or S,S-2 were 
incubated with sodium pyruvate in PBS, in the presence / absence of sodium formate. Final 
concentrations: osmium complex = 15 µM (IC50 concentration determined in A2780); sodium 
pyruvate = 1 mM; sodium formate = 2 mM. After 24 h incubation at 310 K, concentrations of 
D and L-lactate were measured individually using enantio-specific detection assay kits 
(Cayman Chemical) as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence (λex: 530-
540 nm, λem: 585-595 nm) was read using a Promega GloMax Multi+ microplate reader. 
Samples were measured in quadruplicate, and standard deviations calculated.  
 
In vitro growth inhibition assay. 5000 cells (A2780, HOF, MRC5 or PC3 cancer cells) were 
seeded per well (150 μL) in 96-well plates. The cells were pre-incubated in drug-free media at 
310 K for 48 h before adding different concentrations of the compounds to be tested. Stock 
solutions (100 μM) of the osmium complexes were prepared in DMSO (5% v/v) and medium 
(95% v/v), and then further diluted in culture medium until working concentrations were 
achieved. Drug stock solutions were concentration-adjusted after ICP-OES analysis. The drug 
exposure period was 24 h. After this, supernatants were removed by suction and each well was 
washed with PBS. A further 72 h was allowed for the cells to recover in drug-free medium at 
310 K. The SRB assay was used to determine cell viability.47 Absorbance measurements of the 
solubilised dye (on a BioRad iMark microplate reader using a 470 nm filter) allowed the 
determination of viable treated cells compared to untreated controls. IC50 values 
 15 
 
(concentrations which caused 50% of cell death), were determined as duplicates of triplicates 
in two independent sets of experiments and their standard deviations were calculated.   
 
Co-administration of formate. Cell proliferation assays were carried out as described above 
with the following experimental modifications: A fixed (equipotent) concentration of each 
osmium complex was used, corresponding to ½ × IC50 concentration.  Stock solutions of 
osmium complexes were prepared as described previously (Os concentration in drug stock 
solution was determined by ICP-OES before adminstration to cells, see SI). This stock solution 
was further diluted using the corresponding medium until working concentrations were 
achieved. Sodium formate was co-administered at three different concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 
2.0 mM). Both solutions were added to each well of cells independently, but within 5 min of 
each other. Cell viability was determined using the SRB assay as duplicates of triplicates. Cell 
viability modulation experiments were repeated using sodium acetate (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mM) in 
place of sodium formate. N-formylmethionine modulation experiments were carried out 
similarly, using three concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mM) in PC3 human prostate cancer cells, 
which are known to overexpress the peptide deformylase (PDF) enzyme. 
 
Metal accumulation in cancer cells.  The accumulation of osmium complexes in A2780 
human ovarian cancer cells was studied. Briefly, 4 x 106 cells were seeded on a 6-well plate. 
After 24 h of pre-incubation time in drug-free medium at 310 K, the complexes were added to 
give final concentrations equal to IC50 / 3 (Os determined by ICP-OES before administration 
to cells) and a further 24 h of drug exposure was allowed, with no recovery time (with the 
exception of efflux experiments, in which cells were allowed to recover in drug-free medium 
for up to 72 h). After this time, cells were treated with trypsin, counted, and cell pellets were 
collected. Each pellet was digested overnight in concentrated nitric acid (72%) at 353 K; the 
 16 
 
resulting solutions were diluted using doubly-distilled water containing thiourea (10 mM) and 
ascorbic acid (100 mg/L).48 Concentrations were adjusted to give a final acid concentration of 
3.6% v/v HNO3 and the amount of Os taken up by digested cells was determined by ICP-MS 
in no-gas mode (see supplementary information). Experiments did not include recovery time 
in drug-free media; they were carried out in triplicate and the standard deviations were 
calculated. Statistical significances were determined using Welch’s unpaired t-test. 
 
Metal distribution in cancer cells. Cell pellets, obtained in triplicate (as described for metal 
accumulation studies) were fractioned using the Fraction PREP kit (BioVision). Samples were 
digested overnight in nitric acid (200 µL, 72% v/v) at 343 K, then diluted to achieve a final 
working acid concentration of 3.6% v/v (taking into account the volume of the sample: 
cytosolic and membrane fractions = 400 µL, nucleic fraction = 200 µL). Metal concentration 
in digested samples was determined by ICP-MS in no-gas mode. 
 
Reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cells. The D-lactate assay detection kit (Cayman 
Chemical) was stored at 255 K before use. Complexes R,R-2 and S,S-2 were selected for 
screening. 30 × 106 A2780 human ovarian cancer cells were seeded in T75 flasks with 24 h 
pre-incubation. After this time, solutions of Os complexes and sodium formate were added 
independently, but within 5 min of each other (final working concentrations: IC50 concentration 
of the osmium complex, 2 mM sodium formate) with 24 h drug exposure. The supernatant was 
collected to determine the extracellular D-lactate concentration. The cells were then washed 
twice with PBS, detached using trypsin / EDTA, counted and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min 
to obtain cell pellets of 40 × 106 cells to determine the intracellular D-lactate concentration. 
Samples were processed per the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence (λex: 530-540 nm, 
λem: 585-595 nm) was read using a Promega GloMax Multi+ microplate reader. Samples were 
 17 
 
measured in triplicate, and standard deviations calculated. Statistics were calculated using 
Welch’s t-test at the 95% confidence limit.

Summary of article for table of contents 
 19 
 
Intracellular asymmetric transfer hydrogenation catalysis is demonstrated. Enantiomers of 
Os(II) arene catalysts can penetrate cell membranes, achieving reduction of pyruvate to D- or 
L-lactate using formate as a hydride source, with high enantioselectivity. The mechanism is 
selective for cancer versus normal cells and offers a new approach to cancer therapy.
