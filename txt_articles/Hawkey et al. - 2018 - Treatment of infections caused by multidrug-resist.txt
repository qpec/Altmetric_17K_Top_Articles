The Working Party makes more than 100 tabulated recommendations in antimicrobial prescribing for the treatment
of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and suggest further research, and
algorithms for hospital and community antimicrobial usage in urinary infection. The international definition of MDR is
complex, unsatisfactory and hinders the setting and monitoring of improvement programmes. We give a new defini-
tion of multiresistance. The background information on the mechanisms, global spread and UK prevalence of antibi-
otic prescribing and resistance has been systematically reviewed. The treatment options available in hospitals using
intravenous antibiotics and in primary care using oral agents have been reviewed, ending with a consideration of
antibiotic stewardship and recommendations. The guidance has been derived from current peer-reviewed publica-
tions and expert opinion with open consultation. Methods for systematic review were NICE compliant and in accord-
ance with the SIGN 50 Handbook; critical appraisal was applied using AGREE II. Published guidelines were used as
part of the evidence base and to support expert consensus. The guidance includes recommendations for stakehold-
ers (including prescribers) and antibiotic-specific recommendations. The clinical efficacy of different agents is crit-
ically reviewed. We found there are very few good-quality comparative randomized clinical trials to support
treatment regimens, particularly for licensed older agents. Susceptibility testing of MDR GNB causing infection to
guide treatment needs critical enhancements. Meropenem- or imipenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae should have
their carbapenem MICs tested urgently, and any carbapenemase class should be identified: mandatory reporting of
these isolates from all anatomical sites and specimens would improve risk assessments. Broth microdilution meth-
ods should be adopted for colistin susceptibility testing. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes should be instituted
in all care settings, based on resistance rates and audit of compliance with guidelines, but should be augmented by
improved surveillance of outcome in Gram-negative bacteraemia, and feedback to prescribers. Local and national
surveillance of antibiotic use, resistance and outcomes should be supported and antibiotic prescribing guidelines
should be informed by these data. The diagnosis and treatment of both presumptive and confirmed cases of infec-
tion by GNB should be improved. This guidance, with infection control to arrest increases in MDR, should be used to
improve the outcome of infections with such strains. Anticipated users include medical, scientific, nursing, antimicro-
bial pharmacy and paramedical staff where they can be adapted for local use.

Lay summary
Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are bac-
teria (or germs) that remain susceptible to only one or two antibi-
otics. Gram-negative bacteria usually live in the gut (or in the
environment), where they do no harm, but can appear and cause
infection at other body sites that normally lack any bacteria, for
example in the bladder or blood. This especially occurs in patients
who are made vulnerable by underlying disease, injury or hospital-
ization. MDR GNB may be acquired from other patients who have

 received antibiotics. Infections caused by MDR GNB are difficult to
treat and so may cause more prolonged symptoms in the site of
infection and can cause additional complications such as pneumo-
nia or infection in the blood. This can prolong the length of stay in
hospital, and in some cases can cause death. Some types of MDR
GNB, Acinetobacter spp. for example, can be carried on the skin
rather than in the gut, again with no obvious signs or symptoms.
‘Colonization’ describes carriage of bacteria on body surfaces or in
the gut without infection. When patients develop infection and
require antibiotic treatment, selecting the correct antibiotic can be
difficult. This report provides advice on the best choices among the
antibiotics currently available.
1. Introduction
This guidance has been prepared by a joint Working Party of the
British
Society for
Antimicrobial
Chemotherapy (BSAC), the
Healthcare Infection Society (HIS) and the British Infection
Association (BIA) to advise on the treatment of infections caused
by MDR Gram-negative bacteria. It also describes best practice in
antimicrobial prescribing. There is an accompanying guideline
describing appropriate infection prevention and control precau-
tions, including hand hygiene, equipment and environmental
cleaning and guidance on screening for MDR GNB.3 The infection
control and prevention guideline should be used in conjunction
with the present document. There is a glossary of technical terms
(Appendix 1, available as Supplementary data at JAC Online).
The Working Party comprised a group of medical microbiolo-
gists and scientists, infectious disease physicians, infection con-
trol practitioners, epidemiologists, and patient representatives
nominated by the Societies. The patient representatives were lay
members and had direct experience of the treatment of
healthcare-associated infections through personal experience,
membership of SURF (Healthcare-acquired Infection Service
Users Research Forum), patient charities or through involvement
in the development of NICE guidelines. The representatives were:
Susan Bennett, Member of Health Care Acquired Infections,
Service Users Research Forum, Leicester, UK; Jennifer Bostock,
Member of Health Care Acquired Infections, Service Users
Research Forum, Leicester, UK; and Maria Cann, Trustee, MRSA
Action, Kirkham, UK
They were involved in the preparation of the remit of the
Working Party (Supplementary data Appendix 3), were invited to
all meetings, invited to comment on the final draft prepared by the
authors and endorsed the final version.

3. The Working Party Report
Date of publication: March 2018.
3.1 What is the Working Party Report?
This Report is a set of recommendations covering the treatment of
infections caused by MDR GNB (i.e. herein defined as susceptible to
only one or two different antibiotics). Strains internationally
defined as MDR GNB by possession of resistance to three or more
classes of antibiotics can nevertheless be treated with a wide
range of antibiotics so we argue the case for a re-definition below
(see Section 6.2).
The Working Party recommendations have been developed
systematically through a multi-professional group and are based
on published evidence. They should be used to develop local proto-
cols for acute and long-term healthcare settings.
3.2 Why do we need a Working Party Report for
these infections?
MDR GNB have become more prevalent internationally, including
in the UK and Europe. The increased use of broad-spectrum agents
encourages their proliferation.4 The spread of these bacteria
causes infections that can increase the length of hospital stay and
adversely affect the quality of life of patients. Public awareness
has been increasing, and the relative lack of new antimicrobial
agents to treat infections due to GNB has resulted in the formula-
tion of the 5 year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy by the UK
Department of Health.5 Outbreaks are associated with consider-
able physical, psychological and financial costs. Evidence-based
treatment regimens are effective in improving the outcome of
infections due to these bacteria.
3.3 What is the purpose of the Report’s
recommendations?
The Report describes appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy for
infections due to MDR GNB.
3.4 What is the scope of these guidelines?
We examine the background information on the mechanisms,
global spread, and UK prevalence of resistance, prescribing, and
then discuss treatment (i) in hospitals using antibiotics intrave-
nously and (ii) in primary care using agents given orally, ending
with a consideration of antibiotic stewardship. Data (and doses,
where given) usually refer to adults as there are few data for chil-
dren and neonates. Extrapolation from adult data for b-lactams
seems reasonably secure but this is not necessarily the case for
other agents. Another set of guidelines considers appropriate
infection control principles, best practice hand hygiene, screening
and environmental cleaning.3 For the detailed scope for this guide-
line see Appendix 2.5 and for the review questions see Appendix 3.7
(both in the Supplementary data).

 3.5 What is the evidence for these guidelines?
In the preparation of these recommendations, systematic reviews
were performed of peer-reviewed research using the searches
show in Appendix 4. Expert opinion was also derived from pub-
lished guidelines subjected to validated appraisal.2 Evidence was
assessed for methodological quality and clinical applicability
according to protocols of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines
Network (SIGN) initially using SIGN 20111 guidelines and then
updating this as the work continued in order to comply with the
SIGN 2014 guidance.6
3.6 Who developed these guidelines?
A group of medical microbiologists, scientists, infectious disease
physicians, infection control practitioners, epidemiologists and
patient representatives.
3.7 Who are these guidelines for?
Any hospital or general practitioner can use these guidelines and
adapt them for local use. Expected users include clinical medical,
nursing, antimicrobial pharmacy and paramedical staff. Paediatric
licences and formulation may limit the suitability of some of the
discussed agents for children and neonates. Where there are spe-
cific issues relating to dosage, outcome or toxicity that are outside
current licence information, these are discussed. The guidelines
should be used to improve the treatment of both presumptive and
confirmed cases of infection by MDR GNB.
3.8 How are the guidelines structured?
Most areas (defined by questions) comprise an introduction, a
summary of the evidence base with levels and a recommendation
graded according to the available evidence. The guidelines are not
organized by clinical indication.
3.9 How frequently are the guidelines reviewed
and updated?
The guidelines will be reviewed and updated every 4 years if war-
ranted by sufficient changes in the evidence or by the availability
of new agents or formulations.
3.10 Aim
The primary aim of the review was to assess the current evidence
for antimicrobial prescribing in the treatment of MDR Gram-negative
infections. The secondary aims were: (i) to evaluate the efficacy of
antibiotics to treat community and hospital infections caused by
MDR GNB; and (ii) to evaluate the impact of educating and providing
support to professionals and patients to reduce unnecessary use of
antibiotics, leading to a reduction in the selective pressure for resist-
ance, thereby assisting antibiotic stewardship.
4. Summary of guidelines
The guidance has been derived from current best peer-reviewed
publications and expert opinion. Each recommendation is graded
according to standard grades1 and is associated with a class of
supporting evidence, or it is presented as a Good Practice Point.
General recommendations for stakeholders, including prescribers,
are made in Table 1. Specific antibiotic recommendations are
made in Table 2.
4.1 How can the guidelines be used to improve
clinical effectiveness?
The guidelines can be used to direct and formulate antibiotic poli-
cies and to aid the prescribing practice of infection specialists and
other clinicians. They provide a framework for clinical audit tools
for quality improvement.
4.2 How much will implementation of the
guidelines cost?
The majority of the antimicrobial agents that are described in
these guidelines are generic and are currently widely used. Newer
b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLIs) are more expensive
than older BL/BLIs and most alternatives to carbapenems against
MDR GNB are also more expensive. Extra financial support will be
required for the surveillance of outcomes of bacteraemia.
Implementation of these guidelines should enable better-focused
therapy, with no increase in drug utilization and possibly a modest
decrease.
4.3 Summary of suggested audit measures
Patients with infections with MDR GNB should receive empirical
(best guess) or definitive (i.e. after results of laboratory tests)
appropriate antibiotic treatment (alone or in combination) and the
former should be active in at least 80% of cases. It is important to
note that the basis on which resistance was defined was changed
by EUCAST from predicting failed clinical response to deviation
from the normal susceptibility of the species. In an era of multiple
resistance, continuing to select for such resistant strains even
when the patient has clinically responded to antibiotics to which
the organism is resistant is undesirable. Control groups with infec-
tions at the same site and caused by the same species, but not
MDR, or infections without known aetiology should not receive
definitive treatment reserved for patients with MDR GNB. This audit
should be conducted first for bacteraemias.
To reduce total antibiotic consumption, measured as defined
daily doses.
Quarterly use of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam
should be reduced if either is in the top quintile/1000 patient days
as assessed in each quarter. Specialist and tertiary care units may
have special needs and should be excluded from the quintile
assessment. Reductions of use in such units should be undertaken
but should be tailored by consideration of their speciality case mix.
Trimethoprim use should be reduced and nitrofurantoin use
increased in primary care.
Risk assessment tools for colonization and infection with MDR
GNB in patients should be developed for the UK and put in place
in all settings. Only infected patients known to be, or at risk of
being (by these assessments), colonized with these bacteria
should receive empirical treatment with drugs reserved for
MDR GNB.
No antibiotic prescriptions for treating the elderly with asymp-
tomatic bacteriuria (ASB), or urinary tract infection (UTI) in the

Organization
Recommendation
Strength
Central public
health
authorities
Central public health departments or the Chief Medical Officers should receive bacteraemia data from
the jurisdictions of trusts and CCGs or equivalent primary care organizations bacteraemia data in
their localities annually. They should ensure computerized record linkage to provide dates of death.
They should ensure information is categorized by locality (separately for hospitals and for com-
munity with associated separate wider healthcare data), date of onset or acquisition, organism,
specific antibiotic resistance and pattern, and mortality rate. These data should be made available,
for open interrogation, with rolling cumulative data within the health service.
Strong for
Make publicly available tabulated incidence and outcome data for bacteraemia giving hospital onset
data by region and hospital, and for community and wider healthcare onset data by CCG or equiva-
lent primary care organizations. Correlate these data with similar analysed and tabulated annual
data on total antibiotic use and organisms and antibiotic resistance in clinical infections.
Good practice
Consider central production of unbiased national or regional data on true resistance rates in commun-
ity-onset localized or systemic infections to guide national community antibiotic
recommendations.
Strong for
Commissioning
and quality
organizations
Continuously monitor bacteraemia outcomes and antibiotic resistance by organism and devise
improvement programmes for both.
Good practice
Provide and use active feedback of monitoring to prescribers and nursing staff, ensuring optimization
of clinical, microbiological and antimicrobial prescribing outcomes. Use audit and feedback to
reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use in the community and wider healthcare.
Conditional for
Use persuasive and restrictive interventions to reduce the total antibiotic consumption, particularly
broad-spectrum antibiotics in the community and care home setting.
Strong
Ensure production of local guidelines for empirical and definitive antibiotic use, regularly updated for
community-, wider healthcare- and hospital-onset infections and audit compliance with these.
Conditional for
Hospital and pri-
mary care:
general
Provide an ongoing antimicrobial stewardship programme in all care settings, based on resistance
rates, with audit of compliance, with guidelines, surveillance of outcome and active feedback.
Strong
Identify through horizon scanning and make available new antimicrobials that may be required to
treat MDR GNB. Monitor use through formulary/drug and therapeutics committees.
Conditional for
Use restrictive prescribing policies to acutely reduce the incidence of infection or colonization with
MDR GNB; thereafter, maintain persuasive and restrictive approaches and monitor to check
whether gains persist.
Strong for
Integrate hospital IT to deliver annually linked data for each bacteraemia, including patient demo-
graphics, whether the bacteraemia’s onset was in the community, wider healthcare or hospital,
antibiotic resistances of isolate, antibiotics prescribed, and maximum early warning score or occur-
rence of septic shock, and if possible defined time-limited (not admission-limited) mortality. Use
these integrated data to review the adequacy of treatment of infection in communities and
hospitals.
Good practice
Hospital and pri-
mary care
treatment of
UTI
Inspect up-to-date national and local antibiotic surveillance when compiling local antibiotic guide-
lines on treatment of UTI. Follow local guidance on what antibiotics to prescribe.
Strong for
For an elderly patient, do NOT send urine for culture or start empirical antibiotics unless there are spe-
cific symptoms or signs of UTI and none elsewhere. Use the algorithm in Figure 5 to decide whether
to do this in elderly patients, especially in those with dementia.
Conditional for
Do not prescribe antibiotics in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in the elderly with, or without, an
indwelling catheter.
Strong for
Always consider the positive and negative predictive value of specific symptoms before sending urine
for culture or starting antibiotics for a UTI. Base decision on when to prescribe (whatever the age)
primarily on symptoms. Use dipstick tests, if no catheter is present, to confirm the diagnosis, before
prescribing, especially when symptoms are mild or not localized.
Strong for
If there are risk factors for MDR GNB or previous presence of MDR GNB and the patient is symptomatic,
send a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility.
Strong for
Building on previous work, predictive scoring should be developed for the presence of ESBL-producing
E. coli in primary care and on admission to hospital to restrict the need to prescribe carbapenems
and other antimicrobial agents generally active against ESBLs.

Recommendation
Strength
Need to quantify risks of infection with/carriage of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli and of Klebsiella
spp. resistant to all antibiotics and relate to time since travel to countries with high prevalence of
MDR GNB and incorporate in risk assessments for clinical infection with MDR GNB in the community
and on admission to hospital to guide therapy.
Strong for
If defined risk factors for MDR GNB are present avoid cephalosporins, quinolones, trimethoprim and
co-amoxiclav in treatment of lower UTIs unless the pathogens are confirmed to be susceptible.
Strong for
Personalize empirical chemotherapy for each patient by considering current features of bacteraemia,
risk factors for antibiotic resistance and past susceptibility testing, including the presence of MDR
GNB in the patient, hospital unit, nursing home or community.
Conditional for
In pyelonephritis always collect a urine sample before treatment. MDR GNB are unlikely to respond to
oral treatment so consider risk factors for MDR GNB, including travel. Use an active oral agent only
if patient is well enough and if known to have had ciprofloxacin-, trimethoprim- or co-amoxiclav-
susceptible MDR GNB in last month.
Conditional for
If the patient has pyelonephritis and risk factors for MDR GNB, start, if hospitalization not required,
empirical intravenous therapy with ertapenem if OPAT therapy available. This will treat ESBL- and
AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. If hospitalization required for this or OPAT not available,
admit for meropenem, temocillin or ceftolozane/tazobactam if no evidence of CPE organism. If the
patient is penicillin hypersensitive then the hospital may use amikacin or meropenem, or if only
susceptible isolates in the past, gentamicin. If carbapenem-resistant bacteria are, or have been,
present, base treatment on susceptibility testing of recent or current isolates.
Strong for
Locally assess the true rate of resistance and determine from this when changes to guideline recom-
mendations for empirical therapy for UTI in guidelines are necessary, including recommendations
where the risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteraemia is high.
Conditional for
Primary care
prescriber for
UTI
Always inform the patient or their carer(s) on what to look out for and how to re-consult if symptoms
worsen or do not improve as community-onset E. coli bacteraemias of urinary origin are increasing.
Strong for
In younger women with acute uncomplicated UTI, only consider MDR GNB in choosing empirical treat-
ment if there are risk factors (see Section 8.4) or recent foreign travel to countries where such
strains are highly prevalent.
Strong for
Use fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin or pivmecillinam, guided where possible (i) by susceptibility testing
and (ii) by this guideline’s recommendation on choice, dosing and duration, for uncomplicated
lower UTI where MDR GNB are suspected.
Strong for
Use nitrofurantoin for 5 days with MDR GNB. Alternatively use fosfomycin trometamol 3 g orally as sin-
gle dose, and repeat on third day only if MDR GNB confirmed to improve bacteriological cure.
Pivmecillinam alone at 200 mg three times daily for 7 days may be a third-line choice but consider
combination use with amoxicillin/clavulanate depending on clinical trial results at the time.
Conditional for
Review outcome data linked to antibiotic prescribing to improve quality of care in the community and
care homes.
Conditional for
To reduce recurrent UTI, consider firstly the option of pre-prescribed standby antibiotics to take when
symptoms begin, rather than daily or post-coital antibiotic prophylaxis. Where prophylaxis is used
successfully for recurrent infection in adults limit use to 6 months.
Conditional for
Avoid antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary catheter insertion or changes unless there is previous history
of symptomatic UTI with the procedure, insertion of incontinence implant, or trauma at
catheterization.

Recommendation
Grading
Amikacin
Modernize use of amikacin, which has improved activity, with development of validated nomo-
grams. Ensure assays are readily available before repeat doses and consider, because of the
risks of toxicity, the practicality of monitoring with audiograms.
Conditional for
Amoxicillin/clavulanate
Use for lower UTI due to known ESBL-producing bacteria only if current isolates, or if using
empirically, recent isolates, are fully susceptible.
Conditional for
Ampicillin/sulbactam
Could use against some carbapenem-resistant apparently sulbactam-susceptible A. baumannii
isolates. Caution needed in the UK because of a higher range of MICs. Absence of a break-
point prevents categorization as susceptible/resistant.
Conditional for
Aztreonam
Do not use aztreonam alone empirically if MDR GNB or Gram-positive or anaerobic pathogens
are suspected.
Strong against
Do not use aztreonam for CTX-M ESBL- or AmpC-producing bacteria even if these appear sus-
ceptible in vitro.
Strong against
Use aztreonam for MBL- or OXA-48-producing strains if it is certain that they do not produce
ESBLs or AmpC.
Strong for
Research usefulness of aztreonam in combination with avibactam for bacteria producing MBLs
with ESBL/AmpC enzymes and for those with other carbapenemases.
Conditional for
research
Cefepime
Could use cefepime to treat infection caused by ESBL- or AmpC-producing bacteria if suscepti-
ble at the EUCAST breakpoint of MIC �1 mg/L
Conditional for
Do not use cefepime even at increased dose for isolates with (i) MIC of 2–8 mg/L (CLSI ‘suscep-
tible dose dependent’) or (ii) MIC 2–4 mg/L (EUCAST intermediate), or (iii) strains with stable
derepression of AmpC or (iv) strains that produce both AmpC and ESBLs.
Strong against
Do not use cefepime to treat infection caused by CPE.
Strong against
Cefixime and other oral
cephalosporins
Do not used for treating infection caused by ESBL, AmpC and CPE.
Conditional
Cefoxitin
Confirmation needed of its usefulness as a carbapenem-sparing agent for inpatients to empiri-
cally treat urinary infection or use definitively for infections caused by CTX-M-15-producing
E. coli; its short serum half-life means it is unsuitable for OPAT and probably it has insufficient
advantage to displace existing agents.
Research and trials
Ceftazidime
Use ceftazidime for susceptible infections with P. aeruginosa including quinolone-resistant or
some imipenem-resistant strains.
Strong for
Do not use ceftazidime to treat infections due to ESBL- or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae
or CPE (other than OXA-48 producers), even if in vitro tests suggest the isolate is susceptible.
Conditional against
Ceftazidime/avibactam
Could use ceftazidime/avibactam as an alternative to carbapenems for infection with ESBL-
and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae but alternatives may be cheaper.

Fosfomycin
Use in the treatment of lower UTI due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae. Oral formulation available is
useful for ESBL producers after repeated recurrence after nitrofurantoin and potentially for
carbapenemase producers.
Conditional for
Consider dosage and trials of oral formulation for upper UTI.
Research and trials
Consider parenteral fosfomycin, probably in combination, as part of salvage treatment for sus-
ceptible MDR GNB; clear indications for use are not yet established. Potential drug of last
resort.
Research and trials
Need comparative clinical trials to establish optimal indications for, and optimal use of, oral
and parenteral drug.
Research and trials
Carry out ongoing local and national surveillance of use and resistance because of previous
emergence of bacterial resistance in populations and the drug’s potential as an important
parenteral agent.
Strong for
Gentamicin
Could use gentamicin empirically in the UK if the likelihood of MDR GNB is low.
Conditional for
Could use gentamicin as a carbapenem-sparing agent for urinary, intra-abdominal and bacter-
aemic infections due to ESBL-producing E. coli when susceptibility is confirmed but do not
use empirically if the risk of MDR GNB is raised.
Conditional for
Could use gentamicin in combinations for urinary, intra-abdominal and bacteraemic infections
due to gentamicin-susceptible KPC-producing Klebsiella spp. if strain is resistant to colistin
and meropenem (see Section 7.18).
Conditional for
Use once-daily dosage of gentamicin or tobramycin if no renal impairment, followed by meas-
urement of levels 6–14 h post-dose and adjust repeat dosage by reference to the appropri-
ate 7 or 5 mg/kg nomogram. Consider increased risks of toxicity if there is co-administration

Introduce in the UK mandatory reporting of meropenem- or imipenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae from all anatomical sites and specimens.
Strong for
Test all meropenem- or imipenem- resistant isolates of Enterobacteriaceae immediately for
the precise level of resistance and for an indication of the responsible class of carbapene-
mase. Submit to agreed reference laboratories to determine susceptibility to a wide range of
potentially active agents, including, as appropriate, colistin, ceftazidime/avibactam, temocil-
lin, aminoglycosides, fosfomycin and tigecycline.
Strong for
Consider use of continuous infusion meropenem in combination at dose determined by nomo-
gram if infection with KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella with MIC of .8 and ,64mg/L.
Research and trials
Nitrofurantoin
Could use nitrofurantoin for 5 days to treat uncomplicated, lower UTIs with nitrofurantoin-sus-
ceptible MDR E. coli (not Proteeae or P. aeruginosa).
Strong for
Do not use repeatedly if there is moderate renal impairment (eGFR ,45 mL/min/1.73 m2), or in
long-term courses, as these are associated with rare unwanted pulmonary effects.
Conditional against
Use alternative agents if there are repeated recurrences with MDR GNB but do not anticipate
the emergence of resistance in E. coli infections on a single recurrence as selection for resist-
ant strains in the urine or faecal flora is rare.

Pivmecillinam
Consideration should be given to reducing the mecillinam EUCAST breakpoint for classification
of susceptibility.
Conditional for
Treat lower UTI due to ESBL-negative E. coli with pivmecillinam at 200 mg three times daily; do
not use for infections caused by Proteeae, Klebsiella or Pseudomonas.
Conditional for
Some ESBL-producing E. coli respond, but efficacy is poor against CTX-M-15 and OXA-1 enzyme
producers: dosing at 400 mg three times daily may be no more effective. Consider combina-
tion of the lower dose with 375 mg three times daily amoxicillin/clavulanate for follow-on to
parenteral therapy for such infections in hospital or OPAT.
Conditional for
Requires clinical comparative trials in the public interest (i) alone or together with amoxicillin/
clavulanate for UTIs due to ESBL-producing organisms, including particularly those produc-
ing CTX-M-15 enzymes, (ii) in uncomplicated lower UTI generally against fosfomycin trome-
tamol and nitrofurantoin as the relative advantages of these drugs have not been directly
compared over the last 10 years as MDR GNB have become more problematic.
Trials and research
Polymyxins (including
colistin)
Reserve intravenous colistin for infections due to polymyxin-susceptible but multiresistant bac-
teria and preferably use in combination with other agents.
Conditional for
Give careful consideration to use of higher dosage regimens in critically ill patients.
Conditional for
Use colistin with meropenem to treat susceptible KPC-producing Klebsiella spp. if the merope-
nem MIC is �8 mg/L and consider higher meropenem dose by continuous infusion if the MIC
is .8 and �32 mg/L.

other carbapenemases, which are susceptible to these but resistant to meropenem with
MIC .32 mg/L.
Conditional for
Closely monitor renal function especially in the elderly, those receiving high intravenous doses
for prolonged periods and those on concomitant nephrotoxic agents, e.g. aminoglycosides.
Strong for
Reconsider use of polymyxins in selective digestive decontamination regimens as these agents
are now important last therapeutic options against CPE and are more threatened by resist-
ance than previously appreciated.
Good practice
Need research on optimal rapid and practical methods of susceptibility testing outside intrinsi-
cally resistant groups such as Proteeae and Serratia spp.

5. Methodology
5.1 Evidence appraisal
Methods were in accordance with SIGN 50 and Cochrane
Collaboration criteria1,7 and critical appraisal was applied using
AGREE II.2 Accepted guidelines were used as part of the evidence
base and to support expert consensus. Questions for review (see
Appendix 3.7) were derived from the Working Party Group, which
included patient representatives in accordance with Patient
Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO).6
K. Soares-Wiesner of Enhance Reviews Ltd and Dr P. Wiffen of
Pain Research and Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences,
Oxford University, used a systematic review process. Guidelines
and research studies were identified for each search question.
Systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and obser-
vational studies were included. The latter comprised cohort non-
RCTs, controlled ‘before and after’ studies, and interrupted time
series. All languages were searched. Search strategies for each
area are given in the sections below and in Appendix 4. MeSH
headings and free-text terms were used in the Cochrane Library
(Issue 11, 2012), Medline (1946–2012), Embase (1980–2012) and
Cumulated Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)
(1984–2012). On 23 May 2014, an update search was conducted
on Medline alone using the same strategy for references after
1 January 2013. Reference lists of included studies were searched.
Additional references were added in October 2016 and June 2017
to cover specific issues. Two review authors independently
screened all citations and abstracts identified, and screened full
reports of potentially eligible studies (those that addressed the
review questions in primary or systematic secondary research, or a
clinical, in vitro or in-use study). Disagreements were resolved by
discussion, and rationales for exclusion of studies were docu-
mented. Pre-tested data extraction forms were used, and study
characteristics and results collected. Data were extracted from
observational studies for multiple effect estimates: these included
the number of cases analysed, adjusted and unadjusted effect
estimates, with standard error or 95% CI, confounding variables
and methods used to adjust the analysis. If available, data were
extracted from contingency tables. Risk of bias was assessed using
SIGN critical appraisal checklists. Interrupted time series were
assessed using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of
Care (EPOC) Group.6,8 Quality was judged by report of details
of protection against secular changes (intervention independent
of other changes) and detection bias (blinded assessment of pri-
mary outcomes and completeness of data). For outbreak patterns
associated with particular pathogens, the Working Party made
additional searches of descriptive studies to extract effective treat-
ments for infections caused by bacteria with specific resistance.
5.2 Data analysis and interpretation
Clinical outcomes were mortality, effectiveness of treatment and
length of hospital stay. Microbial outcome measures were
decreases in the prevalence of MDR GNB or decreases in coloniza-
tion or infection by specific GNB. Risk ratios (RRs) were used for
dichotomous variables, and mean differences with 95% CI were
used for continuous variables.9 Analyses were performed in
Revman 5.22.10 SIGN summary tables were used. Evidence tables
and judgement reports were presented and discussed by the
Working Party and the guidelines were prepared according to the
nature and applicability of the evidence, patient preference and
acceptability and likely costs. The level of evidence was as defined
by SIGN (Table 3), and the strength of recommendation was based
upon Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
and Evaluation (GRADE) (Table 4).11 The grading relates to the
strength of the supporting evidence and predictive power of the

tion. Any disagreements between members were resolved by dis-
cussion. For some areas and recommendations, only expert
opinion is available; in such cases, a good practice recommenda-
tion has been made. A flow chart of the systematic review process
is given in Figure 1.
5.3 Consultation process
These guidelines were opened to consultation with circulation to
the stakeholders listed (see Appendix 6). The draft report was
placed on the BSAC web site for 1 month in June 2016 for open
consultation. Views were invited on format, content, local applic-
ability, patient acceptability and recommendations. The Working
Party considered and collated comments, and agreed revisions.
6. Rationale for recommendations
6.1 Usage
It is beyond the scope of this guideline to define optimal quantita-
tive usage of antibiotics by hospital beds or community popula-
tions and the UK is not an exceptionally high antibiotic user in
international terms. Equally, measures to reduce antibiotic usage
will depend on what apparent over-usage is occurring in any com-
munity or hospital department. For this reason, the assessment of
reduction measures whilst based on comparative epidemiology
must also consider both clinical outcome measures and usage at
the local level. Suggestions for reducing overall usage must there-
fore be largely implemented at the local level where risk to
patients and benefit can be adequately assessed, and they lie
beyond the practical scope of this guideline.
6.2 What is the definition of multidrug-resistant
Gram-negative bacteria?
Multidrug resistant (MDR) is a vexed term. From 1980 it was used
to mean ‘resistant to multiple agents’ without the number or types
of agents being specified. More recently the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has attempted to formalize
the term as ‘resistant to three or more antibiotic classes’, whilst
extremely drug resistant (XDR) is ‘susceptible only to one or two
drug classes. These definitions, based on those for tuberculosis, are
epidemiologically attractive, but can prove to be impractical. An
international consensus is difficult to achieve, as not all products
are available and tested by laboratories in all countries, and
there is no universal testing policy for laboratories (which make

 pragmatic decisions on what to test). Some antibiotic resistances
are now very common and stable, e.g. to ampicillin and sulphona-
mides, so they are seldom tested for, but if they are present the
organism needs only one further resistance to count as MDR GNB
by the ‘three classes of resistance’ rule. There also is scope for dis-
agreement on which antibiotics should be considered as separate
classes; for example, monobactams behave similarly to oxyimino-
cephalosporins in respect of most resistance mechanisms but very
differently in the case of metallo-lactamases (MBLs).
Difficulties arise also if in vitro ‘susceptibility’ is poorly defined, e.g.
with the absence of EUCAST breakpoints, as for e.g. (i) Acinetobacter
spp. and sulbactam, and (ii) temocillin. Furthermore, differences
between European (EUCAST) and US (CLSI or FDA) breakpoints can
affect fundamentally whether isolates are regarded as MDR or XDR.
These inconsistencies will have an effect on the recruitment and
classification of patients in clinical trials. Separate breakpoints for uri-
nary isolates, although needed to take account of high urinary con-
centrations with some antibiotics, also complicate assessments.
Lack of laboratory uniformity in breakpoints can make comparisons
and data aggregation meaningless. For example, EUCAST and CLSI
breakpoints differ for piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavu-
lanate. EUCAST defines Enterobacteriaceae isolates as piperacillin/
tazobactam susceptible if they have an MIC �8mg/L [resistance (R)
.16mg/L] compared with �16!4mg/L (R �128!4mg/L) in CLSI
guidance. For amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility is defined by
EUCAST as �8!2mg/L (R .8mg/L (or 32!2mg/L for uncompli-
cated UTI) and by CLSI as �8!4mg/L (R �32!16mg/L). The FDA
regard Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates as susceptible to piperacil-
lin/tazobactam if the MIC is �64mg/L (the historical CLSI breakpoint
for piperacillin) whereas EUCAST and CLSI now consider the break-
point should be susceptibility (S) �16!4mg/L. The EUCAST and CLSI
definitions have changed with time and from previous national
guidelines, e.g. the pre-EUCAST BSAC breakpoint for amoxicillin/clav-
ulanate in systemic infections was 8!4mg/L. Cefepime is a further
example of an antibiotic with breakpoint changes: the old CLSI
breakpoint for Enterobacteriaceae was �8mg/L but is now �2mg/L
based on 1g twice daily doses. Organisms with MICs of 4 or 8mg/L
are viewed as being ‘susceptible but dose-dependent’ by CLSI.
EUCAST categorizes an MIC �1mg/L as susceptible and .4mg/L as
resistant. A failure rate of 83% in a prospective trial of cephalospor-
ins for ‘susceptible’ serious infections due to ESBL-producing
Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli partly reflected the use of high
breakpoints.12 Breakpoint differences and changes over time in the
categorization of isolates with the same MIC as ‘susceptible’ or

 ‘resistant’ profoundly challenge conclusions in the clinical literature,
including reports of regulatory trials on the response to be expected
of infections due to ‘susceptible’ or ‘resistant’ strains or indeed which
patients have been included in trials where susceptibility of the
organism is a selection criterion.
For all these reasons, the international definitions have not led
to better surveillance of MDR strains and their usefulness must still
be questioned. In our literature search routines, we have employed
the international definitions but have had to augment these with
literature on specific resistances. A useful pragmatic approach to
the definition of MDR is to consider oral and parenteral drugs sepa-
rately. The reason being that oral drugs will be largely used in the
primary care setting and parenteral drugs in secondary care.
Furthermore, one should base definitions on susceptibility rather
than resistance as the former is more likely to be sought clinically
by further testing with MDR strains. This gives a basis for alternative
definitions for MDR. For oral drugs, multiresistance can usefully be
defined as a bacterium susceptible to only one or no readily avail-
able oral agent active against infections systemically or in the
upper urinary tract. This definition is vulnerable to the introduction
of new, or newly re-licensed, oral agents, but this is appropriate
and may emphasize the importance of new agents to the licensing
authorities. By this definition the following would be classed as
multiresistant isolates for the community: (i) E. coli resistant to co-
amoxiclav (amoxicillin with clavulanic acid), oral cephalosporins,
quinolones and trimethoprim but susceptible to nitrofurantoin,
mecillinam and fosfomycin. Although providing options in cystitis,
these oral agents lack evidence of achieving systemically active
concentrations and efficacy in upper and complicated UTIs, which
is particularly relevant if these are caused by ESBL- and AmpC-
producing strains; (ii) P. aeruginosa resistant to quinolones. This
approach could be modified to exclude agents where the mutation
frequency is sufficiently high so that resistance commonly
emerges during treatment.
For parenteral antibiotics a similar approach can be considered.
Susceptibility to oral agents that have no licensed, or available,
parenteral form, e.g. pivmecillinam and nitrofurantoin, should
not be taken into account. Specific agents to which impaired sus-
ceptibility might be significant include carbapenems, relevant
cephalosporins (cefotaxime for Enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime
for P. aeruginosa), aztreonam, ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazi-
dime/avibactam, temocillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, colistin, qui-
nolones, fosfomycin, tigecycline and aminoglycosides (including
amikacin). Given this greater number of agents and the paucity of
new pipeline antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacteria, it is
pragmatic to consider ‘multiresistant’ as isolates where only two,
or fewer, unrelated antibiotics are active against the bacterium. By
such a definition the following would be considered multiresistant
isolates in hospitals:
(i) Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible to two or fewer of mer-
openem or imipenem, (third-generation cephalosporins),
piperacillin/tazobactam, (tigecycline), aminoglycosides, qui-
nolones, (trimethoprim), colistin, where agents in brackets
lack EUCAST breakpoints.
(ii) Klebsiella
spp.,
Enterobacter
spp.,
Serratia
spp.
and
Citrobacter spp. that are susceptible to two or fewer of
carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins, including
with b-lactamase inhibitors, piperacillin/tazobactam,
temocillin, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, quinolones, trime-
thoprim or colistin.
(iii) Proteus spp., Morganella spp. and Providencia spp. that are
resistant to third-generation cephalosporin, piperacillin/tazo-
bactam, and aminoglycosides and susceptible only to carba-
penems, and the new BL/BLI combinations (ceftolozane/
tazobactam or ceftazidime/avibactam). Unlike the species
considered in (ii) above, these Proteeae are inherently resist-
ant to tigecycline and colistin.
The following would not be regarded as multiresistant:
(i) E. coli that is susceptible to carbapenems, ceftolozane/tazo-
bactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, colistin and fosfomycin
but resistant to unprotected third-generation cephalosporins,
co-amoxiclav, piperacillin/tazobactam, quinolones and
trimethoprim.
The effect of new parenteral antibiotic introductions on the def-
inition of MDR GNB in hospitals is illustrated by the licensing of cef-
tazidime/avibactam and the availability of parenteral fosfomycin.
Both drugs join temocillin, tigecycline or colistin as potentially
effective agents against some Enterobacteriaceae with KPC carba-
penemases. Such strains would no longer be classified as MDR GNB
by our definition. Clearly, acquired resistance of KPC-producing
strains to colistin, ceftazidime/avibactam, fosfomycin and tigecy-
cline may all arise so some will be MDR GNB and some will not.
From a therapeutic view this is probably appropriate, although all
should remain major targets for infection control, given the cost of
new agents and the need to conserve their usefulness, along with
plasmid-mediated transmission of blaKPC gene and transmission
of their host strains. The use of alternative b-lactams or new
BL/BLIs rather than carbapenems may be expensive but might
reduce the selective pressure for carbapenem-resistant MDR
GNB. These antimicrobials, with activities against organisms with
different b-lactamases, may have differential effects on the preva-
lence of particular b-lactamases and other carbapenem-resistant
bacteria. They may select more for MBLs that are particularly
resistant to b-lactams, which will limit their ultimate usefulness in
a locality. The activity of different b-lactamase inhibitors against,
and stability of b-lactams to, different b-lactamases is shown
in Table 5.
The difficulty in international surveillance of MDR GNB need not
preclude the establishment of surveillance for specific organism–
antibiotic resistance combinations. This has been adopted by PHE
for the English Surveillance Programme for Antibiotic Use and
Resistance (ESPAUR) and is weighted towards resistance to third-
generation cephalosporins, quinolones and carbapenems of E. coli,
Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa.
6.3 What is the global epidemiology of MDR GNB?
6.3.1 Origins and impact of multiresistance
Resistance to multiple agents can develop via successive muta-
tions, through the dissemination of multiresistance plasmids/
genes (e.g. transposons), or through a combination of both proc-
esses. Resistance narrows antibiotic choices for definitive therapy.
More critically, it increases the likelihood that empirical therapy
will prove ineffective, increasing mortality in septic patients.

 Plasmids are the main source of MDR in Enterobacteriaceae and
Acinetobacter spp., except for mutations in DNA gyrase genes
gyrA/B conferring fluoroquinolone resistance, mutational up-
regulation of arcA/B-mediated efflux compromising tigecycline,
and for mutational derepression of AmpC b-lactamases giving
resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Enterobacter spp.,
Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp. and Morganella morganii.13,14 By con-
trast, sequential accumulation of mutations is paramount in
Pseudomonas spp.
A recent review has discussed the emergence of specific resist-
ant lineages and the role of different plasmid groups in emerging
resistance problems in E. coli.15 Some clones have spread widely
for reasons that are not clear. Resistance may increase their com-
petitiveness, but some strains are adept at acquiring MDR. Several
strands of evidence support this view. First, some ‘high-risk
clones’, e.g. E. coli ST131, frequently acquire diverse resistance
determinants, including different ESBLs, AmpC and even carbape-
nemases.16 Second, there is co-selection of hypermutability with
resistance in P. aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis, facilitat-
ing development of further resistance. Third, it is commonplace
for plasmids and resistance islands to carry multiple genes
encoding resistance to an antibiotic via two or more different
mechanisms not all of which can remain under effective selection
pressure. Fourth, the presence of toxin–antitoxin systems in plas-
mids may prevent loss of plasmids even when selective pressure
is removed.17 Fifth, integrons, which provide efficient gene-
capture and expression systems, and which are now frequent in
plasmids but were not present prior to the widespread use of anti-
biotics, provide a mechanism whereby resistance acquisition has
accelerated. Finally, the presence of MDR GNB in the environment,
including foodstuffs and water sources, provides important path-
ways for amplification and the spread of some resistance genes
to man.18,19,20–23
Until recently, environmental sources of carbapenemase genes
did not appear to exist but the description of high levels of NDM-
producing E. coli in chicken in China24 suggests this position will not
be maintained with current international practices and biosecurity
of food as a source. Surprisingly, the ST131 clone of E. coli did not
seem to have significant environmental sources in its initial spread,
although it has now been described occasionally in chickens.25,26
6.3.2 Epidemiological trends among MDR
Enterobacteriaceae: cephalosporin and
quinolone resistance
Countries historically varied in the prevalence of different CTX-M
ESBLs conferring cephalosporin resistance and in the plasmids
encoding these enzymes.27 The prevalence of different CTX-M
enzymes has changed with time and latterly in Europe and North
America CTX-M-15 has become the dominant enzyme, often asso-
ciated with E. coli ST131.28 Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) sug-
gests that the acquisition of CTX-M enzymes occurred a number of
times in clade C of E. coli ST131.29 Frequent co-carriage of OXA-1
penicillinases impairs susceptibility to combinations of clavulanate
and tazobactam with penicillins. Ceftolozane appears stable to
this OXA-1 enzyme. Other factors associated with the rise of MDR
Enterobacteriaceae include the spread of plasmids encoding
AmpC b-lactamase. These seem around 10-fold less frequent than
plasmids encoding ESBLs in the UK,30 although more recently in
Canada a plasmid-mediated AmpC enzyme (CMY-2, which shares
a promoter gene, ISEcp1, with CTX-M-15) was almost half as com-
mon as ESBL production and one-third of such strains belonged to
E. coli ST131.31 Distinguishing AmpC and ESBL cephalosporin-
resistant strains is important epidemiologically and in routine test-
ing, although both EUCAST and CLSI do not recommend it for
guiding treatment.32 However early information on AmpC/ESBL
status in Enterobacteriaceae may predict resistance/susceptibility
to ceftolozane/tazobactam. Mutations can augment MDR: for
example, porin loss can engender resistance to ertapenem (and,
sometimes, other carbapenems) in ESBL- and AmpC-producing
Enterobacteriaceae.
6.3.3 Carbapenem resistance
Carbapenem
resistance
was
initially
slow
to
emerge
in
Enterobacteriaceae but is now steadily increasing, and mediated
more and more by acquired carbapenemases (predominantly by
KPC, VIM, IMP, NDM and OXA-48-like types).33–36 Internationally
there has been a considerable spread of K. pneumoniae clonal
complex (CC) 258 isolates with KPC carbapenemases. The rise of
NDM and OXA-48 carbapenemases is more often associated with
the spread of their encoding plasmids or transposons among bac-
terial strains. Carbapenem resistance due to ESBL or AmpC
enzymes combined with OmpK35 porin loss may lead to treat-
ment failure but is often unstable and may impose a fitness cost
on bacteria, meaning that spread of such strains among patients is
rare, though not unknown.33 Loss of the OmpK36 porin conferred
resistance to new carbapenem–b-lactamase inhibitor combina-
tions, relebactam with imipenem/cilastatin37 and meropenem
with vaborbactam.38 Resistance conferred by acquired carbapene-
mases is of much greater concern, and is generally associated with
considerable resistance to other agents.
Data
from
EARS-Net
suggest
that
the
prevalence
of
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae causing bacteraemia
markedly increased in most parts of Europe between 2013
and
2015.39
European
prevalence
of
carbapenem-resistant
K. pneumoniae was higher than 5% in 2015 (and much higher in
some of the countries)40 in Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Romania. In
Greece, the proportion of bloodstream K. pneumoniae isolates
resistant to carbapenems increased from 27.8% in 2005 to 62.3%
in 2014. VIM enzymes dominated early in this period but were
replaced by KPC types, often carried by CC258. The rise of
carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in Italy has been dramatic
and recent: from 1% of bacteraemias in 2009 to 15% in 2010
and 32.3% in 2014. This increase again is mainly due to CC258
K. pneumoniae with KPC enzymes.41 This clone also spread widely
earlier in the USA42 and then in Israel,43 where an aggressive,
nationwide infection control intervention was successful in
bringing it under control.44,45 In Romania the major problem is
K. pneumoniae producing OXA-48 carbapenemase.46
Outbreaks of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
(CPE) have been reported in many other parts of the world, includ-
ing all US states47 (where KPC enzymes dominate), South Asia
(predominantly NDM enzymes), the Middle East (OXA-48), Brazil
and Colombia (KPC).36,48 The MBL IMP-4 has spread widely in
China, often together with KPC-2. IMP-4, without KPC, is the domi-
nant carbapenemase in Australia. Further global spread is to be
expected49 as IMP-4 has now been observed in South London

 (unpublished observations, D. M. Livermore). In the absence of
comprehensive international prevalence data for infection and
carriage, risk factors for CPE are difficult to derive, but seem to
include travel to high-prevalence areas, notably including the
Indian subcontinent for NDM producers, and exposure to health-
care and antimicrobials.33 Travel locations are becoming conver-
gent with those where ESBLs are prevalent. Case-number trigger
points for carbapenem-resistant isolates and regional coordination
in control action has recently been modelled in the USA to
show the high importance of early intervention with effective
control
measures50
for
K.
pneumoniae
strains
and
other
Enterobacteriaceae. Carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteria-
ceae has been associated with increased attributable mortality,
probably owing to the greater likelihood that initial empirical ther-
apy proves inadequate.33,51,52
6.3.4 Global resistance issues with oral drugs with low
resistance rates in the UK
A 2008 study of clinical isolates from women aged 18–65years
with symptoms of uncomplicated lower UTI in 10 countries found
susceptibility rates above 90% only for fosfomycin (98%), mecilli-
nam (96%) and nitrofurantoin (95%).53 Nitrofurantoin resistance
in E. coli as assessed in European and Canadian isolates collected
in 1999–2000 and 2007–08 was associated with a very diverse
range of sequence types, although many strains showed multiple
resistances: mecillinam resistance was similarly diverse but not
associated with multiple resistance.54 A further study from
Munster and Seattle suggests nitrofurantoin resistance is particu-
larly common in ST58.55 Nitrofurantoin resistance is now described
in 11% of the dominant H30 sub-clone of ST131,56 suggesting the
drug may be selective in the upper intestine, although this drug
does not usually eliminate Enterobacteriaceae from the faecal
flora of patients receiving it. In Canada, nitrofurantoin resistance
rates in ESBL-producing E. coli were 16% but in ESBL-producing
Klebsiella spp. were 71% (nosocomial) and 93% (non-nosoco-
mial).57 Well-described mutations in nitrofuran reductases confer
resistance and plasmid-mediated resistance due to an efflux
pump (oqxAB) has recently been described from Hong Kong.58 This
efflux pump and its encoding plasmid (with the oqxAB gene
flanked by IS26 insertion sequences) was found in 26/103
nitrofurantoin-resistant or -intermediate human isolates (by CLSI
criteria) and was more common in ESBL-producing isolates. The
combination of oqxAB with the nitroreductase genes caused high-
level nitrofurantoin resistance. This two-level resistance process is
analogous to the hypothetical role of AAC-60-Ib-cr in aiding the
emergence of quinolone resistance by chromosomal mutation.
Notably, oqxAB also mediates resistance to mequindox, which is
used in China as a growth promoter in animal feed. In China
322/1123 veterinary isolates of E. coli carried this gene but these
mainly belonged to phylogroups A and B1, which are less associ-
ated with extraintestinal pathogenicity in man.59
Fosfomycin use has been complicated by the emergence of
resistance in some populations.60 In Spain, when use increased
some 50% between 2005 and 2008, resistance rates in CTX-M-15
ESBL-producing E. coli rose to 16% and among all ESBL-producing
isolates increased from 4.4% in 2005 to 11.4% in 2009. The
increase was particularly associated with nursing homes.61
Fosfomycin resistance developed in E. coli ST131 (previously
present there but not typed)62 and was not associated with
described mutational mechanisms of fosfomycin resistance.63
Such mutations involve inactivation of genes encoding the hexose
and triose sugar phosphate transport, impairing drug uptake.
A different mechanism is present in the acquired fosA gene, which
encodes a drug-inactivating metalloglutathione transferase.60
Fosfomycin resistance was present in 2009–10 in 7.8% of human
E. coli in mainland China and approximately half of this was due to
fosA3.64 A recent survey of food animals in Hong Kong found
plasmid-mediated fosA to be increasing in frequency and associ-
ated with CTX-M ESBL-encoding plasmids.65 A recent Chinese sur-
vey of isolates collected from 2010 to 2013 detected fosfomycin
resistance in 12% of ESBL-producing Klebsiella and 169/278 (61%)
of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae: 94 KPC-producing strains carried
fosA3 flanked by two IS26 insertions and were clonally related.66
Similar genetic findings were made in non-clonally related E. coli
and Klebsiella sp. in Korea.67
Mecillinam resistance is said to remain uncommon in the
clinic, at 5%–7% of ESBL-producing E. coli in Sweden.68 In a wider
European study overall susceptibility was similar, with 4.8%
resistance in E. coli from uncomplicated UTI, although gradually
rising,69 notably in Spain, where the proportion of resistant strains
rose from 1% in 2000 to 6.5% in 2014.
6.4 How do MDR Enterobacteriaceae differ from non-
fermenters in terms of their prevalence and associated
resistance genes?
Carbapenem resistance is more common in non-fermenting GNB
than in Enterobacteriaceae. In A. baumannii, by the year 2000 it was
common to encounter isolates resistant to all treatment options
except carbapenems, colistin and tigecycline. Subsequently, carba-
penem resistance has proliferated, reaching �30% of bloodstream
isolates. It is largely associated with acquired OXA-23, -40 or -58-like
carbapenemases or with insertion-sequence-mediated up-regula-
tion of the chromosomal OXA-51-like carbapenemase. The strain
structure of A. baumannii is extremely clonal, making it difficult,
without a history of patient transfers, to distinguish place-to-place
spread from repeated independent selection of lineage variants
that were previously circulating at low frequency. UK A. baumannii
isolates producing OXA-23 carbapenemases often co-produce
ArmA-encoded
16S
ribosomal
methyltransferases
conferring
pan-aminoglycoside resistance. MDR Acinetobacter spp. largely
cause outbreaks in ICU settings,70–72 whereas carbapenem-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae, principally E. coli and Klebsiella spp.,
cause infection in a wider group of patients, and have far greater
potential to spread rapidly when introduced into wider patient
populations.36,44,45,48,73,74
Most UK P. aeruginosa remain susceptible to b-lactams, includ-
ing
ceftazidime,
piperacillin/tazobactam
and
carbapenems,
aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, with resistance rates of
5%–10% for these agents; and ,1% for ceftolozane/tazobactam.75
Nevertheless, single MDR lineages, some with carbapenemases,
have persisted in a few UK hospitals for up to 9years, causing multi-
ple infections widely scattered over time and possibly reflecting col-
onization of the hospital water systems. The most frequently
encountered carbapenemase is VIM, which may be plasmid medi-
ated, with multiple gene copies conferring high-level meropenem
resistance,76 but is usually integron associated. IMP-9, another

 MBL, is as common as VIM in China,77 and has been shown to be
derived (as probably are many carbapenemase genes) from envi-
ronmental bacteria by horizontal gene transfer.78 MDR is also a
major problem in P. aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis patients, with
resistance increasing over time in the individual patient’s lung
microflora. MDR profiles are extremely variable even within widely
successful cystic fibrosis lineages, e.g. the Liverpool Epidemic Strain,
which has circulated in multiple cystic fibrosis patients and units.
Rates of carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa vary greatly across
Europe, with high rates in Eastern Europe; Lithuania, Poland,
Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece all have
rates of resistance .25% and sometimes .50%.40 More generally,
these rates of resistance show a gradient, rising from north-west
to south-east Europe, with extensive spread of carbapenemase-
producing clones in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, which
are
outside
the
EU
surveillance
area.79
In
contrast
to
Enterobacteriaceae, rates of resistance to carbapenems are gener-
ally higher than those to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam or
aminoglycosides.
6.5 Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative
bacilli in the UK and relevant antibiotic prescribing
There are no epidemiological reports in the UK that specifically
study defined MDR GNB. In this section, we discuss information on
resistance to individual antibiotics and, where available, their asso-
ciated resistances. Analysis is complex. Different reports from
English, Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish devolved administra-
tions need to be drawn together to give a UK summary: bacteria
and antibiotic resistances do not respect national boundaries.
Reduced prescribing may be followed by reduced resistance
(see Section 11.1) but this is not invariable at a national level. Such
reduced resistance has not occurred as older antibiotics (e.g. sul-
phonamides and streptomycin) have been abandoned,80 perhaps
because of resistance linkage and for reasons already discussed
(see Section 6.3). Reduced prescribing may reduce the likelihood of
new resistance becoming prevalent but this is only a hypothesis
set within the modern issues of travel and migration, which may
import and spread resistance. Overall antibiotic consumption in
England has fallen by 4.5% between 2012 and 2015 to 21.8 DDDs/
1000 population/day. It has yet to decline in general practice to
the levels seen in 2010. After 5 years of increases in prescribing,
hospital antibiotic use declined by 5% in 2014 from 5190 to
4933 DDDs/1000 admissions and is now at approximately
2010 and 2011 levels. This decrease is concentrated in teaching
hospitals, which may reflect their case-mix or different pressures
in other hospitals.4
In Scotland antibiotic use in primary care fell for the third con-
secutive year in 2015 (by 2.4%) and is now 9.5% lower than the
peak rate of use in 2012. The level of prescribing was related to
population deprivation scores and to residence in nursing homes
where antibiotic use among those aged over 65years was 83%
higher than for similarly aged patients not resident in nursing
homes.81 Since 2012, antibiotic use in Scottish nursing homes has
fallen by 7.8% compared with 5.1% in all patients aged .65years.
Nevertheless, hospital use rose by 3.5% and is now 9.9% higher
than it was in 2012. The rate of 5880 DDDs/1000 admissions is
now 19% higher than in England.81 Of course, this may reflect use
of
less-selective
combination
regimens
such
as
penicillin,
metronidazole and gentamicin rather than the number of days a
patient receives antibiotics, which is a weakness both of using
DDDs and the number of admissions to estimate the number of
people exposed to an individual antibiotic. Although England has
the lowest antibiotic consumption in the UK, Scottish hospitals
show significantly less consumption of carbapenems and pipera-
cillin/tazobactam.
Information on primary and secondary care prescribing for Wales
for 201582,83 is only available at the level of health board and hospi-
tal, respectively, and has not been reported as aggregate totals.
An overview of current antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative
serious infections in the UK can be secured in various ways.
The BSAC Bacteraemia Surveillance Programme (http://www.bsac
surv.org) provides historical and current information with a marked
time lag for centrally tested isolates from a restricted sample of
24–40 hospitals and can be examined on a national or regional
basis by species. It has an archive of organisms that can be studied
in retrospect, which is an important strength. Other surveillance
depends on collection of local data rather than isolates. In England
reporting is mandatory for all cases of E. coli bacteraemia which
has improved case ascertainment. Mandatory data are needed for
Klebsiella, other Enterobacteriaceae and Proteeae, Acinetobacter
spp. and P. aeruginosa if early national interventions in emerging
problems are to be reliably assessed. Mandatory reporting of MRSA
bacteraemia in England was established in 2001 and has improved
with more comprehensive data capture from 2005 onwards.
Health Protection Scotland now has mandatory reporting of E. coli
bacteraemia but other species of Gram-negative bacilli are only
reported across the UK on a voluntary basis. Such voluntary labora-
tory reporting of all bacteraemias has been in place since the
Devonport incident of contaminated intravenous infusions in 1972
and is believed now to capture data for 82% of all bacteraemias.
These data include antibiotic susceptibility data that have not been
present in mandatory data. The collection of voluntary and man-
datory data suggests that voluntary reporting should be replaced
by mandatory reporting as soon as possible to reduce the labora-
tory workload. Most laboratories in England and Wales examining
human samples now download bacteria identified and their antibi-
otic susceptibilities irrespective of anatomical site to regional and
national repositories, where trends but not additional information,
e.g. demographic details of patients’ residence etc., can be
analysed.
Bacteraemia due to E. coli has increased over the last 10years in
England and Wales, and analysis of the dataset showed that receipt
of antibiotics in the 4weeks preceding bacteraemia was the most
important risk factor, followed by age over 65years, and occurrence
during summer months.84 A study by the E. coli subgroup of the UK
Department of Health’s Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial
Prescribing, Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infection on the
first 891 cases of E. coli bacteraemia with enhanced surveillance
data are available in Committee papers for 28 March 2014 online.85
This showed that urinary catheterization was a factor in only 10% of
cases but that 72% of episodes from a urogenital source involved
individuals aged �65years. A urogenital infection had been treated
in 310/891 (34.8%) cases in the 4weeks preceding bacteraemia
and this sub-population differed very significantly in its antibiotic
resistances. Resistance in this subpopulation to ciprofloxacin was
80% versus 17% overall, 76.9% versus 39% to trimethoprim, and
49.3%
versus
45%
to
co-amoxiclav.
The

 cephalosporin resistance rate in the population overall was 10% but
no figure was provided for the resistance rate in this sub-population
treated. Although the rates for ciprofloxacin seem surprising, the fig-
ures show a marked selection for multiply resistant, if not necessa-
rily MDR, strains because of either failed treatment that did not
cover the multiresistant organisms or selection of resistant organ-
isms in the gut flora that subsequently caused a urinary infection
that then progressed to bacteraemia. Approximately half of the bac-
teraemias appeared to be associated only with a lower UTI but this
probably represents symptomatically silent upper UTI giving rise to
bacteraemia, either initially or through spread to the upper tract
despite treatment. The implication of this important study is that
failure to give effective antibiotics may be the reason for 70% of
E. coli bacteraemias, whilst 30% of cases are associated with antibi-
otic resistance and, possibly, directly with treatment failure. The for-
mer requires detailed study, which is beyond the scope of this
guideline. The consistent use of an active antibiotic regimen for
those either aged .65years or with signs and symptoms of an
upper UTI would make a sizeable contribution to the target of a
50% reduction in the rate of in E. coli bacteraemias by 2020 that
was announced by the then UK Prime Minister at the Japan 2016 G7
meeting.86 This enhanced surveillance study has now been ana-
lysed and published.87 Most patients (69.6%) were aged over
65years. Most patients (68.3%) had a positive blood culture taken
within 24h of admission but 46.7% of these had a healthcare expo-
sure within the previous month and 546 out of these 930 (58.7% of
this subgroup, 31.5% overall) had received antibiotics in the preced-
ing month. In 281 there was a clear urinary focus for the bacterae-
mia, for which 145 had received antibiotics (most commonly
trimethoprim or co-amoxiclav). The largest independent risk factor
for a bacteraemia’s focus being the urogenital tract was previous
treatment for UTI within 4weeks of the bacteraemia’s onset
[adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 10.7 (95% CI 3.6–8.1)] but details of anti-
biotic resistance in this subpopulation for the whole study was not
given. Twenty one percent of patients had either a urinary catheter
in situ or had one inserted, removed or manipulated in the previous
7days. Since the 2014 initial report, PHE has changed its recommen-
dation for first-line treatment of UTI in all but those under 50years
from trimethoprim to nitrofurantoin, which is a urinary antiseptic
that is only effective for treating lower UTI, although it can be effec-
tive for preventing pyelonephritis associated with bacteriuria of
pregnancy. It is too early to tell whether this will be effective in
reducing bacteraemia or whether an oral combination regimen that
attains systemically active concentrations will be necessary to
achieve the desired outcome. The UK Advisory Committee on
Antimicrobial Prescribing, Resistance, and Healthcare Associated
Infection (APRHAI) on 28 March 2014 opined that in suspected pye-
lonephritis or upper UTI the patient should be admitted if (i) cipro-
floxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam or co-amoxiclav had been used in
the previous 2months and (ii) the patient’s symptoms worsened or
did not improve in the 12–48h after prescription. In UK strains of
E. coli ST131 from various sources collected in 2011–12, when
O16 and non-typeable strains are excluded, there is evidence that
trimethoprim resistance occurs in at least 69% of CTX-M-positive
strains, which constituted 32% of recent UK strains studied but 39%,
at most, of CTX-M-negative strains.88 All CTX-M producers were
ciprofloxacin resistant and 71% of non-CTX-M producers were qui-
nolone resistant. Quinolones are not therefore useful if ST131 strains
are prevalent even if these strains are not carrying ESBLs.
A study reported that sequence-typed E. coli isolates from the
BSAC Bacteraemia Surveillance Programme showed that the sig-
nificant change in E. coli bacteraemia was almost exclusively due
to an increase in clonal complexes 12, 69, 73, 95 and 131.84 This
reflects the sequence types in these clonal complexes. The clonal
complexes, which each may contain more than one sequence
type, belong to phylogroups B2 and D, which have the virulence
factors associated with extraintestinal spread. Phylogroup A and
B1 strains, which may be more antibiotic resistant, are usually con-
fined to the gut and lack these virulence factors. CC131, unlike the
other CCs, includes multiresistant isolates (of ST131) hosting CTX-
M ESBLs, almost invariably now with resistance to quinolones.84 In
a 2010–12 Yorkshire study of bacteraemias 129/768 were ST131
(39/129 ESBL producers), confirming the importance of ST131
strains even in the absence of production of ESBLs. One hundred
and forty-two of 768 were ST73 (3/142 ESBL producers), 81 were
ST69 (1 an ESBL producer), 73 were ST95 (1 an ESBL producer),
31 were ST12 (no ESBL producer, quinolone-resistant) and
27 ST127 (no ESBL producers or quinolone-resistant strains).89
Phylogroup D-ST69 strains (which include the previously desig-
nated clonal group A) were not fluoroquinolone resistant in a
recent Italian study,90 although they were commonly detected in
Italy in a previous cystitis study.91 ST69 is usually ampicillin, trime-
thoprim and sulfamethoxazole resistant. Quinolone-resistant
D-ST69 strains were also uncommon in a Spanish survey with iso-
lates from 2009 accounting for 3% of quinolone-resistant strains
respectively, compared with 26% for O25:H4-B2 ST131 strains.92
We did not consider it feasible to introduce control measures for
ST131 when preparing our earlier guidance on infection control3
and indeed cephalosporin resistance has spread into many
other STs.93
More recent data from 2012 to 2014 on antibiotic resistance in
E. coli bacteraemia in England were collected on 82% (54301/
66512) of cases recorded by mandatory surveillance by record-
linking with the national records of all bacterial isolates. Seventy-
four percent were classified as community onset whereas 16% of
cases occurred 7 or more days after hospital admission. Antibiotic
resistances reported were 8439 (18.4%) to ciprofloxacin, 4256
(10.4%) to third-generation cephalosporin, 4694 (10.2%) to piper-
acillin/tazobactam, 4770 (9.7%) to gentamicin and 91 (0.2%) to
carbapenems.94 Non-susceptibility to quinolones and cephalo-
sporins decreased by 10% and 11% respectively over the 2 years in
hospital-onset cases, whereas third-generation cephalosporin
resistance increased by 10% in community-onset cases. Trends
in hospital or community onset changes in antibiotic susceptibility
in other species, such as Klebsiella, are precluded by lack of manda-
tory surveillance of bacteraemia.
A 12year single-centre study in England suggested that the
increase in E. coli bacteraemias was essentially confined to cipro-
floxacin, co-amoxiclav, cefotaxime and aminoglycoside resistance
and accompanied a similar change in urinary isolates.95 The major
rise in cephalosporin and MDR E. coli in the UK occurred between
2000 and 2007, largely reflecting the spread of IncF (pEK499 or
similar) plasmids, and was associated initially with the internation-
ally

coli

lineage
with
chromosomal
fluoroquinolone resistance. These IncF plasmids encoding the
CTX-M-15 b-lactamase, along with resistances to trimethoprim,

ated with aac(60)-Ib-cr, also augmenting ciprofloxacin resistance],

types
and
other
Enterobacteriaceae, notably K. pneumoniae. Since approximately
2007 (the date varies with the species and resistance) the rise of
cephalosporin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
has slowed and fluctuated (E. coli) or reversed (Klebsiella spp. and
Enterobacter spp.) in the UK, though not in continental Europe.96
This shift in percentage resistance may reflect the reduction in pre-
scribing of cephalosporins and quinolones in the UK, predicated
not only by the Enterobacteriaceae problem but also by concern
about Clostridium difficile. It is important to know if this reflects an
absolute decrease in numbers. Some data suggest that increased
quinolone use largely mirrored the selection of such strains.97 An
increase in quinolone resistance in bacteraemias preceded the
arrival of ESBL-producing strains. Cephalosporin use in England is
now reported to be the lowest in Europe.4,98 Cephalosporin usage
fell by a further 9.2% between 2012 and 2015 following larger pre-
vious declines from a peak in 2006–07 because of the national
C. difficile problems. From 2012 to 2015, oral cefalexin use fell by
25.7% but parenteral cefotaxime use by only 1.6%, whilst paren-
teral ceftriaxone use increased by 37.4%, probably reflecting use of
this once-daily antibiotic in outpatient parenteral antibiotic ther-
apy.4 The microbiological need for preferring this broad-spectrum
agent to teicoplanin or daptomycin, which are only active against
Gram-positive bacteria, should be critically reassessed.
General practice quinolone use in terms of DDDs/1000 inhabi-
tants/day has fallen consistently since 2012, reducing by 3.6%
between 2014 and 2015. However, the national overall usage of
ciprofloxacin has declined only slightly, from approximately
0.48DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day in 2012 to 0.43 in 2015: quino-
lone use in hospitals has increased despite an 18.4% incidence of
ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli bacteraemia.94 A 53.6% rise in the
respiratory quinolone levofloxacin, which is the L-isomer of ofloxa-
cin, seems unjustifiable but reflects a recommendation for use in
penicillin-allergic patients with pneumonia. A similar increase
(50.3%) was seen in Scotland, accompanied by a 17% increase in
ofloxacin use. An English target of a 10% reduction on 2013–14
levels of cephalosporin, quinolone and co-amoxiclav use in primary
care or a reduction in use to be below the 2013–14 median value
(11.3%) of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) for antibiotic pre-
scribing of these agents, was achieved in 189/209 CCGs.4
Prescribing of these antibiotics is substantially lower in Scotland
and is not the subject of targets. Scottish reductions in primary
care use in 2015 were 4.9% for co-amoxiclav, 5.8% for fluoroqui-
nolones and 6.0% for cephalosporins, with an 8% overall reduction
in use.81
Despite these reductions, cephalosporin and quinolone resis-
tances continue to be seen frequently in UK bloodstream and uri-
nary E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, with significant circulation
in older patients who move between hospitals, nursing homes and
the community, and who have frequent exposure to cross-
infection and antibiotics. Resistance to both quinolones and third-
generation cephalosporins in E. coli bacteraemias is concentrated
in those aged �65years in England and is at least twice as preva-
lent in those aged over 74years compared with those aged
65–74years.4 An Italian scoring system for carriage of ESBL-
producing organisms has not been tested in the UK or modelled to
see if the group of patients at risk of carrying these strains on
admission to hospital is increasing.99
The total number of E. coli bacteraemias in England, and there-
fore the absolute burden of resistance, continues to rise – by 4.6%
from 35659 to 37310 between 2014 and 2015 in England.4 The
same publication notes an increase in Klebsiella bacteraemias by
9% over the same period. Over the period from 2000 to 2014 the
incidence of E. coli bacteraemia in England has risen inexorably
from 20 to 50 cases/100000 population.94
In England, rates of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam are
said to have increased in E. coli bacteraemias from 8.5% to 11.7%
and in Klebsiella spp. bacteraemias from 12.6% to 18.5% over the
period from 2011 to 2015.4 Equivalent rises in resistance to co-
amoxiclav from 31% to 42% in E. coli bacteraemias and 18.7% to

 28.2% in Klebsiella spp. bacteraemias have occurred over the
same period.
Record linkage for E. coli bacteraemias between 2012 and 2014
showed piperacillin/tazobactam resistance increasing by 15.1%
for hospital-onset cases compared with 8.7% for community-
onset cases.94 This study also revealed significant variations in
resistance rates by age and sex. Similar trends were seen in
Scotland, with an 8.6% increase for piperacillin tazobactam resist-
ance and 6.1% for co-amoxiclav resistance in E. coli bloodstream
isolates and 14.8% and 28.7%, respectively in Klebsiella spp. in
2015. Changes from CLSI to EUCAST criteria may have produced
these large rises in resistance in Scotland (see Section 6.2), but
there were no changes in EUCAST criteria for these antibiotics
between 2013 and 201581 and in England few laboratories use
CLSI criteria. In Wales 11/18 hospitals in 2015 recorded an increase
in piperacillin/tazobactam resistance in E. coli.100 In England piper-
acillin/tazobactam use rose linearly by 62% between 2010 and
2015 to 135 DDDs/1000 admissions across all hospital types.4
In Scotland, use fell by 7.9% in 2015.81
These changes are important. The main antibiotics used in a
recent prospective study in 10 English hospitals of treatment of
Gram-negative bacteraemia were co-amoxiclav in 32% of patients
and piperacillin/tazobactam in 34%.101 Despite empirical therapy
being inactive against responsible organisms based on in vitro
tests in 34% of cases, all-cause mortality was said to be low,
8% assessed at 7 days and 15% at 30days. Given the increasing
resistance rates and use, explorations of comparative outcome in
relation to resistance and use are needed at each national level
and also by source of infection (see Section 11.2). Mortality in E. coli
bacteraemia
throughout
England
was
measured
between
July 2011 and June 2012 as 18.2% at 30days or 10.34/100000
population in 1 year. These data were derived by record linkage of
E coli bacteraemia cases mandatorily reported to PHE, voluntary
reporting of antibiotic susceptibilities on all isolates to PHE, and
records at the Office for National Statistics Death Registrations and
at the NHS Spine.102 Mortality is high as compared with Finland
(8%) and inpatient-only mortality in Canada (11%) and New
Zealand (9%). Analysis showed important associated features:
30% of deaths occurred on, or on the day after, the blood sample
was taken and 76.3% within 14days making the separate mortal-
ity analysis of community-onset and hospital-onset bacteraemia
important. Overall 19174/26216 (73.1%) patients had their bac-
teraemia recorded within 1 day of admission. Mortality was higher
(34.0%) if a respiratory focus of infection was diagnosed or the
focus of infection was unknown (25.9%) than if a urogenital focus
was diagnosed (13.2%). No information was available on the anti-
biotics prescribed, precluding any test of whether higher mortality
was correlated with failure to provide adequate Gram-negative
cover in suspected respiratory or unknown foci of infection; more-
over, there were no audit data to show if the reported foci of infec-
tion were supported by evidence. A recent audit of coding and
diagnosis of pneumonia by the British Thoracic Society did not sup-
port the diagnosis in 15.8% of cases and noted a 14.3% rate of
mortality in this group.103 At a population level the high burden of
urogenital-related infection for E. coli was such as to make this the
largest cause of deaths, even though mortality in this group was
lower. The lower rate of mortality with urogenital infection
correlates with information in an earlier study, which showed that
the
excess
mortality for
bacteraemia with
ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriaceae was confined to non-urinary infections.104 The
study by Abernethy and colleagues102 identified a urogenital
source for 55.3% of community-onset cases of bacteraemia and
45.1% of healthcare-onset cases. In 17.3% of cases the source
was unknown. Mortality was lowest in those aged 1–44years
(5.4%) versus those aged 45–84 (17.9%) and .85years (25.2%).
Mortality rates varied by the susceptibility of the isolated
causative bacterium; ciprofloxacin susceptible 17.0% (95% CI
16.4%–17.5%), ciprofloxacin intermediate or resistant 21.9%
(95% CI 20.5%–23.2%); cephalosporin susceptible 17.5% (95% CI
16.9%–18.1%), cephalosporin intermediate or resistant 21.3%
(95% CI 19.4%–23.2%). The inclusion of a factor in the adjusted
model to allow for hospital- and case-mix-related mortality
eliminated any significance from the difference in mortality by
cephalosporin susceptibility. Cephalosporins are unlikely to have
been used in infections due to ESBL-producing organisms in
England, but piperacillin/tazobactam may have been used and the
absence of a difference in mortality may reflect some improved
outcome in urinary infection, despite the presence of bacteraemia.
Different
cephalosporins
are
not
equally
associated
with
C. difficile.105 Oral first-generation cephalosporins would be useful
in early treatment. It might be appropriate, whilst keeping
C. difficile under review, to abandon downward pressure on the
whole class of antibiotics and introduce a cephalosporin-specific
approach. There were no data on mortality in relation to suscepti-
bility to piperacillin/tazobactam, co-amoxiclav or aminoglycosides:
carbapenem resistance rates were too low for robust assessment.
Resistance to any one of quinolones, cephalosporins or carba-
penems was associated with a 30% increase in mortality. The
association of increased mortality in quinolone-resistant strains
needs explanation and it is not clear if this relates to hospital
case-mix. Furthermore, if reduced use of oral quinolones is
attempted, care is needed in the controversial area of prophylaxis
in neutropenia, where quinolones are widely used. Studies of
withdrawing quinolones for this indication show an increase in
Gram-negative bacteraemia with susceptible strains without
any diminution, at least initially, in resistant strains,106–108 and
recent Cochrane reviews support the efficacy of quinolone
prophylaxis.109,110
Rates of carbapenemase production by Enterobacteriaceae
(,2%) remain low in the UK but reference laboratory submissions
of these organisms are growing annually (Figure 2), with many of
the isolates coming from clinical rather than screening samples.
It is noteworthy that surveillance of carbapenem-resistant strains
depends on voluntary submission to reference laboratories and
that regional molecular testing necessary for rapid turnaround has
not been converted into national surveillance.4 Given the impor-
tance of reducing carbapenem resistance, consideration should be
given to introducing mandatory reporting of all isolates of
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae so the evolving picture
can be properly assessed. English data suggest the proportion of
carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella spp. rose from 0.2% to 1.1%
between 2011 and 2015.4 There are pockets of local endemicity,
especially of K. pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae, with
KPC enzymes around Manchester or with VIM and OXA-48 in north
Cheshire. These have persisted for 5–6 years (D. M. Livermore,
unpublished data). Many other sites, notably London teaching hos-
pitals, are currently being repeatedly challenged with a diversity of
carbapenemase producers, many imported from overseas. CC258

 K. pneumoniae with KPC carbapenemase remains rare in the UK,
despite repeated introduction, and the greater issue, particularly in
north-west England, is dissemination of plasmids encoding
KPC carbapenemases among different K. pneumoniae and
Enterobacteriaceae. Carbapenem-resistant isolates submitted to
reference laboratories in Scotland increased from 47 in 2014 to 63
in 2015.81 The dual loss of both quinolone and cephalosporin sus-
ceptibility has driven increased usage of carbapenems, particularly
meropenem, from some 75DDDs/1000 admissions in 2010 to
104DDDs/1000 admissions in 2015 in England, a 38.6% increase,
but in 2015 the increase was only 1%.4,81 In Scotland the picture is
different; there was a 6.5% increase in use of carbapenems between
2014 and 2015 but this is now only 9.3% higher than in 2012.
Phenotypic information on aminoglycoside susceptibility is
available. Frequent gentamicin resistance was noted in ESBL-
producing strains of E. coli from all sites in one region, representa-
tive of the UK, with resistance rates of 48.7% for E. coli ST131 and
55.1% for E. coli non-ST131.93 The record linkage data previously
discussed shows that overall gentamicin resistance rates (i.e. irre-
spective of ESBL production) varied by region between 5.5% and
15.4% in the years 2012–14 and that the overall rate in
community-onset cases was 8.6%.94 The region with lowest rate
of resistance had a 34% higher incidence of E. coli bacteraemias
than that with the highest rates, which suggests the possibility of
dilution of the denominator by an increase in more susceptible
bacteraemias (e.g. ST73 in northern England). In Wales in 2015
only 5/18 hospitals reported gentamicin resistance rates less than
8.6% in E. coli bacteraemia and two had rates over 20%.100 Rates
of 8.6%–15% would seem too high for empirical use of gentamicin
alone. However, the 8.6% rate of gentamicin resistance in com-
munity-onset bacteraemia is very similar to the 8.7% resistance
rate to piperacillin/tazobactam, which is widely used alone.94
National data on amikacin are hard to interpret because fewer lab-
oratories test it in addition to gentamicin and the amount of test-
ing that is second line because of resistance on first-line testing
remains unresolved, potentially skewing the data. Nevertheless, as
expected, amikacin resistance is rarer than gentamicin resistance
(2% in 2015) in England.4
Rates of co-resistance in bacteraemia isolates for 2015 for gen-
tamicin and third-generation cephalosporins were 4.6% for E. coli
and 5.9% for Klebsiella spp. compared with resistance rates to
third-generation cephalosporins alone of 7.5% and 5.2%, suggest-
ing some useful activity for gentamicin against ESBL-producing
E. coli but less against ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. Rates of
co-resistance in bacteraemia isolates for 2015 to gentamicin with
co-amoxiclav are 7.8% in both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. compared
with resistance rates to co-amoxiclav alone of 35.2% and 19.3%.4
This confirms the potential utility of an aminoglycoside compared
with co-amoxiclav alone for both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. bacter-
aemias. The same data source indicates a somewhat different sit-
uation with ciprofloxacin/gentamicin combinations. For E. coli and
Klebsiella spp. rates of co-resistance were respectively 6.8% and
5.8% whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin alone occurred in 11.8%
and 5.0%, suggesting that addition of an aminoglycoside was
seldom advantageous in Klebsiella infection. Overall these co-re-
sistance data4 suggest only a modest improvement on gentamicin
monotherapy and the benefit compared with the harm of continu-
ing selection of resistance by the non-aminoglycoside may not be
great.
Consumption of aminoglycosides is now low in England in hos-
pital inpatients (approximately 0.08DDDs/1000 population/day)
and fell in 2015. By contrast, use rose in Scotland by 5.9%, becom-
ing 16.9% more frequent than in 2012. Falls in use are likely to
reflect concern about resistance in ESBL producers and about
potential toxicity; they may also reflect a change in clinical con-
tacts with microbiologists as antibiotic assays are increasingly
undertaken by clinical chemistry departments. A comparison with
Scotland to understand the differences would be informative.
Bacteraemia represents a group of community infections
selected for virulence factors sometimes but not always by antibi-
otics. Antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative infections in the com-
munity was thought, even a decade ago, to be quite uncommon in
the UK. A historical European study of acute, community-acquired,
uncomplicated, non-recurrent UTI in 2008 caused by E. coli
involved 12 general practices in the UK and enrolled 200 unse-
lected women aged 18–65years. Resistance was rare to mecilli-
nam (1%), nitrofurantoin (0%), fosfomycin (0.5%) amoxicillin/
clavulanic acid (2.0%) and ciprofloxacin (0.5%), but commoner to
amoxicillin (32%), sulfamethoxazole (26%), trimethoprim (15%)
and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (14%).111 In that survey the
co-amoxiclav resistance rate seems low in relation to the amoxicil-
lin resistance rate. Reported resistance rates to co-amoxiclav in
lower urinary infections have increased since the time of that study
partly because of the substitution of EUCAST’s (32!2 mg/L) break-
point for the previous BSAC (16!8 mg/L) value. A contemporane-
ous UK study with a large community sample reported 12.0%
resistance to co-amoxiclav versus 54% for ampicillin.112 Welsh
data in 2014 report the following resistance rates in ‘coliforms’
from
urine
in
different
communities:
co-amoxiclav
12.9%
(range 5.1%–25.4%), third-generation cephalosporin (ESBL) 6.8%
(range 3.3%–17.9%), nitrofurantoin 10.0% (range 8.7%–22.4%),
trimethoprim 36.7% (range 30.3–41.8%) and fluoroquinolone
10% (range 7.6%–16.4%).113 A 2010–13 large UK study114 of all
community urinary isolates from a UK region with a population of
5.6 million found that by 2013 resistance to third-generation ceph-
alosporins in E. coli had risen to 5.5% and ciprofloxacin resistance
to 15.5%; for Klebsiella spp. the cephalosporin resistance rate was
higher at 10.1%. Only 0.06% of the E. coli isolates were reported as
resistant to one or more carbapenems, as were 0.32% of the
Klebsiella spp. isolates. In this regional survey, VIM enzymes
were found in Pseudomonas spp., whereas among E. coli and
Klebsiella spp. 16 had NDM genes, 5 KPC and 2 OXA-48. These find-
ings support the view that carbapenemases are rare in the com-
munity in the UK. A further study of isolates in the same English
region over the period 2007–14 showed, after de-duplication,
69 with blaNDM, 26 with blaKPC, 16 with blaOXA-48-like and 7 with
blaVIM.115
A historical audit of urine samples taken at presentation from
primary and secondary care in South London before the widest dis-
semination of ESBL-positive E. coli ST131 occurred, found that
22.6% of isolates were resistant to trimethoprim, 43.3% to amoxi-
cillin and 10.3% to nitrofurantoin.116 Since this audit, resistance to
trimethoprim has slowly risen across the UK, and in Wales is signifi-
cantly commoner in isolates from patients over 65years.
Trimethoprim resistance rates vary widely by CCG in England.
In 2011 it ranged in these from 16.3% to 66.7% but by 2015 in
86% of CCGs it was .25% with an almost uniform median of 29%
in CCGs.4,82 The reason for these variations in a minority of CCGs

 remains uncertain. In Wales resistance rates of 38.2% overall are
currently reported. A caveat is that high resistance rates may
reflect selective testing of previously treated patients in the com-
munity and different local policies for submitting samples, and the
true rate of resistance to trimethoprim in patients presenting in
the community with uncomplicated UTI may be lower than cur-
rent figures suggest.117 Trimethoprim use in England fell by 14.5%
between 2014 and 2015, reversing the increase seen between
2012 and 2014. This fall should be many times larger in 2016 if
there is expeditious compliance with the PHE recommendation in
2014 to substitute nitrofurantoin for trimethoprim as the first-line
antimicrobial
for
cystitis
in
the
older
patient.
A
Swedish
trimethoprim-sparing switch in one region resulted in an 86%
decline in trimethoprim use between 2004 and 2006.118 In 2015 in
England rates of trimethoprim prescribing were approximately
1.1 DDDs/1000 population/day compared with 0.8 DDDs/1000
population for nitrofurantoin.4
UK data on resistance to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and mecilli-
nam is scanty. In a single-centre study nitrofurantoin resistance
was commoner in Klebsiella spp. of community origin (around 15%)
than in E. coli (3%).119 English national data for the second quarter
of 2016 suggest resistance in E. coli in community UTIs varied with
CCG between 0.3% and 12.8% with a median of 3.8%,4 whilst in
Scotland 5.9% of isolates tested in 2015 showed nitrofurantoin
resistance.81 Nitrofurantoin resistance is also common in UK CPE iso-
lates.120 Proteeae are inherently resistant to nitrofurantoin and
data on their prevalence in UTI and resistance linkage for nitrofuran-
toin resistance in England are needed given the recommendation
to use this antimicrobial first line (see Section 9.1 for previous experi-
ence of changes in prevalent phylogroups and STs of E. coli). There
are no recent data on fosfomycin resistance in the UK. A survey of
fosfomycin resistance in Leeds found fosA in two urinary tract iso-
lates collected months after its UK introduction in 1994 despite a
lack of use in the study hospital.121 In the same publication, a study
of foods in Leeds in 1995 identified two Enterobacteriaceae isolates
carrying fosA in vegetables imported from Spain. Fosfomycin
resistance (MIC �64mg/L was present in 32/81 strains of CPE
in 2011; 27 of these were Klebsiella spp.120 In Wales, only 6.2% of
cefpodoxime-resistant E. coli (i.e. probably ESBL- and AmpC-
producing strains) were apparently resistant to mecillinam,122 but
this is discussed further later in the article (see Section 9.4).
The impact of the successful clone ST131 clone of E. coli on multi-
ple resistances has been assessed. In one 2011 UK study, resistance
rates in ESBL-producing E. coli ST131 (mostly with CTX-M-15
enzyme) compared with non-ST131 (producing CTX-M-15 or
CTX-M-14) were 99% versus 83%, respectively, for ciprofloxacin and
92% versus 86% for trimethoprim.93 Fluoroquinolone resistance
alleles gyrA/B and parC are characteristic on WGS of the Clade C of
E. coli ST131, which is almost exclusively the clade carrying CTX-M
ESBLs.29
There is no reliable information on acquired colistin resistance.
Usage sharply increased by 30% between 2013 and 2015 in
England, entirely in specialist and teaching hospitals.4 Given: (i) the
growing use of colistin as a drug of last resort; (ii) the prevalence
of colistin resistance in KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae,
especially in Italy, but also in the USA; (iii) the lack of mandatory
surveillance of Klebsiella spp.; and (iv) the recognition of plasmid-
mediated colistin resistance due to mcr1 and mcr2, there is an
urgent need for enhanced surveillance of colistin resistance at a
national level.4 mcr1 has been found in isolates from British pigs123
but is widespread in the European food chain, including addition-
ally turkeys and veal calves,124 and mcr2 has been found in pork
and cattle products.125
6.6 What impact have returning travellers made on
UK epidemiology?
Whilst mutational resistances often emerge locally, strains with
acquired resistance genes are often clearly imported to the UK
from other countries. Examples include MDR K. pneumoniae with
OXA-48 carbapenemases with Libyan conflict casualties and with
patient transfers from elsewhere in the Middle East; K. pneumoniae
with KPC carbapenemases from Greece and Israel and, most sig-
nificantly, Enterobacteriaceae with the NDM MBL from south Asia
and China.126 Colonization of travellers may be frequent, although
precise rates are largely unknown. A systematic review confirms
travel to certain areas is a significant risk factor.127 Most data
concern ESBL-producing strains and there is a notable dearth of
information on other important resistances, including to aminogly-
cosides, carbapenems, colistin and fosfomycin. Nevertheless, an
Australian study suggests that travel-associated aminoglycoside
and quinolone resistance may be even commoner than travel-
associated cephalosporin resistance.128 Interestingly, prolonged
carriage was significantly associated with the pathogenic phy-
logroups B2 and D rather than A and B1 but strains of ST131 were
rare even with Asian travel. A Canadian study showed that bacter-
aemia due to CTX-M-14 ESBL-producing E. coli was associated with
travel to Europe and Africa whilst CTX-M-15-producing strains
were associated with travel to Asia.129 Analysis of risk factors in
Norway for new cases of ESBL-producing infection was undertaken
in a case–control study of adults who had been resident for 1 year
or more, with no previous hospital or nursing home residence
.24h in the previous 31days. It identified as risk factors travel to
Asia, the Middle East or Africa within the past 6 weeks (OR 21, 95%
CI 4.5–97) or 6 weeks to 24months (OR 2.3, 95% CI1.1–4.4), recent
use of fluoroquinolones (OR 16, 95% CI 3.2–80) or recent use of
b-lactams other than pivmecillinam (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.1–12),
diabetes (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.0–11) and freshwater swimming in the
last year (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0–4.0) were all associated with UTI due
to ESBL-producing E. coli or Klebsiella spp. Factors associated with
decreased risk were the number of fish meals/week (OR 0.68/fish
meal, 95% CI 0.51–0.90) and increasing age (OR 0.89/5year
increase, 95% CI 0.82–0.97). Almost 1 in 4 (23%) ESBL-positive
patients had travelled to the risk countries within the previous
6 weeks and 39% in the 6 week to 24month period compared with
1% and 19%, respectively. Travel to Europe (11% and 67% in ESBL
producers and 7% and 57% in non-ESBL producers), America or
Oceania (including Japan) was not a risk factor.130 This emphasizes
that there is a longer-term effect of travel or migration that is often
not considered. A placebo-controlled trial of ciprofloxacin to pre-
vent traveller’s diarrhoea showed that prophylaxis selected for qui-
nolone-

where resistance is prevalent is a risk factor for acquired MDR bac-
teria and should be considered in respect of empirical therapy.
However, many patients with MDR organisms lack any relevant
travel and it is not known if their organisms represent spread
from carriers, especially in the same household, who have a history

 of high-risk travel,132–134 or who have asymptomatically acquired
the organism in hospital.
The most significant impact that the movement of people can
have on the problem of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is the
maintenance of higher levels of resistance in commensal bacteria
after return from high-incidence areas. Data on faecal carriage rates
may mislead when compared with correlates of clinical infection
since it will include phylogroup A and B1 strains of lower pathogenic-
itythanthe B2and Dstrains seen commonly in urinary and bacterae-
mia.135 Tangden in Sweden showed that 7/8 previously uncolonized
travellers to South Asia and 10/32 to East Asia returned with carriage
of ESBL E. coli.136 One study in Birmingham (UK) showed that 22% of
individuals with names of Middle Eastern or south Asian origin had
faecal carriage of CTX-M ESBL-producing E. coli compared with 8.1%
in those with names of European origin.137 A recent large-scale sur-
vey studying 2430 healthy individuals in four areas in England found
similar carriage rates of 25% and 5.6%, respectively. In a multivari-
able logistic regression model the percentage contribution made to
risk of colonization was apportioned. Being born in South Asia (India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh) or coming from those countries contributed
26.6%, and travel to those countries 12.1%. In contrast, being born in
UK of UK origin contributed 9.9% and travel to all other parts of the
world 17.8%.519 Hence, the choice of antibiotics for empirical treat-
ment may need to take into account recent travel history and cul-
tural background.
The second ESPAUR report (2016)4 includes details from a
research study of faecal carriage rates of ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriaceae in England. This showed variations in carriage
from 4.9% in Shropshire to 16% in Heart of Birmingham Primary
Care Trust with intermediate rates in Southampton and Newham
(East London). Risk factors in this study included birth in India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan (which collectively
accounted for 24% of all carriage) or the Middle East (including
Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Persian Gulf)
and travel in the last year to Africa, South Asia (Indian subconti-
nent
and
Afghanistan),
South-East
Asia
[Thailand,
Burma,
Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore or Pacific Asia (including
Vietnam, Koreas, China)] or South or Central America (WHO
regions). Until control measures reduce prevalence the following
countries are also risk factors for either ESBL carriage or carbapene-
mase acquisition or both: the Eastern Mediterranean (the Balkans,
Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, and Syria) and Eastern Europe and Russia,
Belarus and Kazakhstan, and Italy.
There is a need for further studies with controls (non-travellers
from different households of the same ethnic background) on the
carriage of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, with strain typing and phy-
logroup allocation to better predict the potential for extraintestinal
infection. This is further reviewed elsewhere. Studies are needed
also of Klebsiella spp. and on the time elapsed since travel to speci-
fied locations of high prevalence. Information on healthcare and
antibiotic exposure is required as well as details of many non-ESBL
antibiotic resistance mechanisms.
Evidence
There is a clear indication of association of infection with ESBL-
producing E. coli and travel. There is no information on other
antibiotic resistances in association with travel and minimal infor-
mation on carriage duration after travel.
Evidence level: 3
Recommendation
Need to quantify risks of infection with/carriage of extraintestinal
pathogenic E. coli and of Klebsiella spp. resistant to all antibiotics
and relate to time since travel to countries with high prevalence of
MDR GNB and incorporate in risk assessments for clinical infection
with MDR GNB in the community and on admission to hospital to
guide therapy.

6.7 What is the clinical importance of carbapenemase-
versus CTX-M- and AmpC-producing strains?
ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, MDR P. aeruginosa, and
A. baumannii are associated with increased mortality, length of
stay and expense in most but not all studies evaluating the impact
of antibiotic resistance in GNB.138,139 Nevertheless, variability in the
setting (mainly ICU), study design, organisms included (most nota-
bly, which Enterobacteriaceae species), resistance profile and
site of infection make the studies difficult to compare.138,139
Fluoroquinolone resistance in P. aeruginosa was associated with
increased hospital costs, and, if associated with imipenem resist-
ance (MDR strains), increased mortality.140 Four of eight studies in
one review of MDR strains of P. aeruginosa showed increased
mortality.138 With A. baumannii, carbapenem resistance was gen-
erally associated with increased length of stay and expense of
care; mortality was generally increased, most clearly if blood-
stream infection was involved.138,139 However, two studies of MDR
(but carbapenem-susceptible) A. baumannii did not identify a sig-
nificant increase in mortality, whereas studies of carbapenem
resistance in A. baumannii consistently identify a significant
increase in mortality only partly due to use of inactive carbape-
nems.139,141–143
More recently, studies have emerged evaluating the impact of
carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.144 Pooled analysis
of nine studies comparing mortality in Enterobacteriaceae infec-
tions including bacteraemia found that mortality was more than
2-fold higher when infections were caused by CPE. Broad-
spectrum antibiotics other than carbapenems can select for colo-
nization (detectable by active surveillance) that precedes later
infection with bacteria resistant to a range of other antibiotics
because
of
linkage
with
multiple
resistance
factors.145–149
Carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp. is similarly linked
with multiple resistances that can be selected for by antibiotics
that are not carbapenems, and can be detected as colonization
prior to development of infection;150 this is likely to be the case
with Enterobacteriaceae.
Carbapenem resistance is an increasing problem in Enterobacter
spp. in the absence of carbapenemases. In E. aerogenes ertapenem
resistance is associated with loss of Omp35, a porin, and merope-
nem resistance with loss of Omp36 together with derepressed over-
production of AmpC.151
Bacteria producing CTX-M are of international importance.
In the community they are usually MDR with few and hitherto

 little-used antibiotics offering the sole effective treatment.
The spread of these strains requires widespread changes in pri-
mary care prescribing practice, which can be slow to take effect.
Further, systemic infection with these strains usually requires
parenteral drugs involving additional hospital admissions or outpa-
tient parenteral antibiotics. Particular successful clones such as
E. coli ST131 and ST69 are frequently involved. The fundamental
reason for the success of these clones remains obscure and strat-
egies to counter their spread nationally and internationally have
so far been based on antibiotic restriction alone.
AmpC-producing strains of Enterobacteriaceae were a problem
when third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams were
widely used because stable derepression of this enzyme occurred
by mutation at the regulatory gene ampD13 in Enterobacter spp.,
Serratia spp.,
Citrobacter freundii
and Morganella
morganii.
Selection of such mutants during cephalosporin treatment of bac-
teraemia with these species can cause treatment failure.152,153
Amoxicillin/clavulanate, both components of which are strong
inducers of AmpC in such species, is not active against such species
but piperacillin, although inactive against derepressed mutants,
seems less prone than third-generation cephalosporins to select
such strains from the induced population. Genes encoding AmpC
enzymes have also escaped to plasmids that have spread into
E. coli; such plasmid-carrying strains are widespread in foodstuffs.
The main enzyme is CMY-2. In the UK it remains considerably rarer
than ESBLs.30 Cefepime is more stable to AmpC than other third-
generation cephalosporins but in Enterobacter cloacae high-level
cefepime resistance is associated with mutation in AmpC.151
Carbapenems and temocillin are active against AmpC-b-lacta-
mase whether of chromosomal or plasmid origin but ertapenem is
more labile and, if OmpK35 porin loss occurs, resistance arises
from this enzyme’s action.
7. Intravenous treatment options for MDR
GNB: what is the efficacy of carbapenems,
temocillin, fosfomycin, colistin and other
antibiotics against specific MDR GNB and
what are the recommended antibiotics for
secondary/tertiary care?
The evidence base (and grading) for all agents is generally weak,
as most studies were retrospective case series, only rarely includ-
ing
a
comparator
agent.
Our
suggestions for
intravenous
treatment are summarized in the algorithm in Figure 3. Each intra-
venous agent is further considered individually.
7.1 Carbapenems
Carbapenems should be regarded as the drugs of choice for serious
infections with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae154 and they
are the drugs of choice for the empirical therapy of patients with
serious sepsis caused by GNB, depending on local resistance rates
and clinical experience.
Meropenem was found to be narrowly superior to imipenem/
cilastatin (cilastatin prevents degradation of imipenem by urinary
and ileal dehydropeptidase) in both clinical and bacteriological
outcomes in one meta-analysis of 27 RCTs.155 The clinical response
rates (complete remission or improvement in signs and symptoms
of sepsis) for meropenem and imipenem were 91.4% and 87.2%,
whereas bacteriological response rates were 85.1% and 82.8%,
respectively. There was no significant difference in mortality in the
nine trials reporting data (7.4% for meropenem, 9.7% for imipe-
nem). Meropenem and imipenem (sometimes referred to as
‘Group 2’ carbapenems, based upon activity against Gram-
negative non-fermentative bacteria) are typically preferred to
ertapenem for the empirical treatment of bacteraemias (often
arising from the urinary tract) because of their broader spectrum
(see below). A switch to ertapenem may be rational with suscepti-
ble isolates if it leads to earlier discharge with outpatient paren-
teral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) but without this it is not a
mechanism for reducing selection for carbapenem resistance.
In Singapore, de-escalation of meropenem regimens by infectious
disease physicians (including, in a small proportion, de-escalation
to ertapenem) was associated with no increase in clinical failure
rates or hospital mortality, reduced duration of carbapenem treat-
ment from 8 to 6 days, less diarrhoea and C. difficile infection and
less acquisition of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.156
Meropenem or imipenem select respectively for carbapenem-
resistant Gram-negative organisms, including pre-existing carba-
penem-resistant A. baumannii,157 and porin oprD mutants, the
commonest mechanism of imipenem resistance, arising during
imipenem treatment of P. aeruginosa.158 Overproduction of
AmpC-type enzymes, and efflux pumps (which are common), are
implicated in meropenem resistance in P. aeruginosa: MBLs, usu-
ally of a VIM type, occur but are much less common.159 A multi-
centre Spanish study of isolates in 2008 from P. aeruginosa
bacteraemia showed similar resistance rates to piperacillin/tazo-
bactam, ceftazidime and meropenem. Meropenem resistance
was more commonly associated with MexB or MexY and AmpC
overexpression whereas resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam and
ceftazidime was more commonly associated with AmpC overex-
pression alone, making non-carbapenems preferable agents for
avoidance of MDR strains. Nevertheless, AmpC overexpression was
associated with quinolone resistance, which, with aminoglycoside
resistance, is already known to be associated with efflux pumps.160
Whilst both imipenem and meropenem have a similar spectrum of
activity, use of imipenem has declined and meropenem is now the
most widely prescribed carbapenem in the UK.154
Widespread usage, particularly internationally, has driven the
emergence of resistance and careful and considered empirical
usage is essential. If the bacteria responsible for the infection
are subsequently shown to produce neither ESBLs nor AmpC
b-lactamase, carbapenem use should reasonably be stepped
down to narrower-spectrum agents. An Italian cohort study across
five hospitals showed that rectal carriage of KPC-producing
Klebsiella was predictive of bacteraemia with such strains in the
subsequent 2 years; sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 42%
respectively; positive and negative predictive values were 29% and
93% respectively. Bacteraemia was associated with ICU admis-
sion, invasive abdominal procedures, cancer chemotherapy or
radiation therapy and the number of colonization sites.161
This suggests that screening may play a role in anticipating a
requirement for treatment other than carbapenems active against
such strains, but this will not necessarily apply to other bacteria
with carbapenemases.

 clinical importance of such resistance and the need to know the
resistance mechanism so that appropriate chemotherapy can be
used, mean that an accurate overall view of the emerging picture
is essential if appropriate action is to be taken. We include recom-
mendations on this epidemiological matter because of its impor-
tance. We recommend the introduction of mandatory reporting of
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from all anatomical
sites and specimens. Such isolates should be tested contempora-
neously to determine the responsible carbapenemase and the
meropenem MIC. Isolates should be submitted to reference labo-
ratories to determine susceptibility to a wider range of appropriate
agents and for those agents, such as colistin or ceftazidime/avi-
bactam, for which susceptibility testing is technically demanding.
The determination of susceptibilities is a part of essential
surveillance. Appropriate patient treatment also depends on per-
forming these susceptibility tests in an expeditious manner but the
methodology required may be beyond the scope of most routine
diagnostic laboratories.
Ertapenem is licensed in Europe for the treatment of intra-
abdominal and gynaecological infections and community-
acquired pneumonia. In the rest of the world, including in the
USA, it is also licensed for skin and skin structure infections and for
complicated UTIs (for which it is widely used ‘off-label’ in the UK).
Ertapenem shares the broad spectrum of imipenem and merope-
nem against Enterobacteriaceae, some Gram-positive species
and anaerobes, but is inactive against Acinetobacter spp. and
P. aeruginosa.162 It is sometimes called a Group 1 carbapenem
on this basis. Its main benefit is its once-daily mode of
administration.
Use of ertapenem for the treatment of infections caused by
Enterobacteriaceae is less well established than for imipenem or
meropenem but it has good in vitro activity. A retrospective cohort
study compared outcomes of bacteraemias due to ESBL-
producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae treated with ertapenem and
Group 2 carbapenems. Outcomes were equivalent between
patients (mortality rates of 6% and 18%, respectively; P " 0.18).

 However, more patients treated with Group 2 carbapenems had
severe sepsis/septic shock/multi-organ failure: 5/49 (10.2%) for
ertapenem versus 36/109 (33.3%) for other carbapenems (OR
0.23, 95% CI 0.08–0.62; P , 0.002), suggesting clinicians were
more likely to treat ‘sicker’ patients with a Group 2 carbapenem
than ertapenem.163 A retrospective study in Taiwan evaluated
251 patients with bacteraemia caused by ESBL-producing E. coli
and K. pneumoniae isolates treated with a carbapenem.164 Two
hundred and thirty patients received carbapenems appropriately
(57 ertapenem, 136 imipenem and 37 meropenem): 21 received
carbapenems inappropriately (18 received ertapenem and 3 imi-
penem when the MICs were respectively .0.5 and .1 mg/L).
Among the isolates, rates of susceptibility to ertapenem (MIC
�0.5 mg/L EUCAST) were 83.8% in E. coli and 76.4% in Klebsiella
spp. and those to meropenem were 100% and 99.3%. Sepsis-
related mortality varied if the lower CLSI breakpoint for susceptibil-
ity (�0.25mg/L) was used. By this criterion, mortality was 5.3%
(3/57) in those patients infected with an ertapenem-susceptible
strain versus 33% (6/18) for an ertapenem non-susceptible isolate
if they were treated with ertapenem. If categorization was based
on the EUCAST MIC breakpoints �0.5 or .0.5 mg/L, there was no
significant difference in mortality. Propensity matching of patients
showed that patients with isolates that were ertapenem non-
susceptible by CLSI criteria had a similar raised mortality if treated
with imipenem or meropenem but numbers were small. A recently
published multinational retrospective cohort study of 195 patients
given empirical carbapenem and 509 given targeted therapy for
bacteraemia with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae found erta-
penem to be equivalent to other carbapenems.165 The authors rec-
ognized that as in other similar studies ertapenem was more
frequently used in lower-risk patients and that more studies are
needed in severely ill patient populations.
Resistance (MIC �1mg/L) and high-level resistance (taken here
as MIC 16mg/L) by EUCAST breakpoints to ertapenem in Klebsiella
spp. and Enterobacter spp. were well recognized before CPE
began to spread and were associated with combinations of a b-lac-
tamase (often a CTX-M ESBL in Klebsiella spp. or AmpC in
Enterobacter spp.) plus impermeability due to OmpK35 porin loss.
Despite the results of Lee et al.,164 imipenem and meropenem
appear to remain active against most isolates with low-level ertape-
nem resistance caused by these mechanisms but with raised MICs
compared with normal levels for the species. An in vitro study
showed the frequent emergence of this type of resistance in ESBL-
producing E. coli in a pharmacokinetic model166 but most resist-
ant isolates are Klebsiella spp. or Enterobacter spp., not E. coli. In
a survey of UK isolates in 2007 only one of 95 ertapenem-
resistant isolates of K. pneumoniae produced a defined carbape-
nemase, namely IMP-1, with the remainder inferred to have
impermeability-mediated resistance (porin loss).167 However,
this situation has changed radically as KPC, OXA-48 and NDM
are enzymes now regularly encountered in the UK.168,169 A ret-
rospective case–control study from the eastern USA found that
risk
factors
for
infection
caused
by
ertapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae with such impermeability-mediated resist-
ance included exposure to any antibiotic (not just b-lactams
and carbapenems) during the 30 days before a positive culture
result.170 A study from Singapore found that hospitalization and
fluoroquinolone treatment were predictors for the appearance
of ertapenem-resistant imipenem-susceptible variants.171
The use of ertapenem has no detrimental effect in terms of
selecting for P. aeruginosa.172 Results from 10 clinical studies
showed that use of ertapenem did not result in decreased suscept-
ibility to carbapenems in Pseudomonas spp. This was confirmed in
a study of hospitals in Queensland.173A further study found that
one hospital’s use of ertapenem was balanced by less use of imi-
penem and ciprofloxacin, and this may have contributed to a
reduced prevalence of resistance of P. aeruginosa to imipenem.174
In contrast to these findings a study in Singapore associated
increasing consumption of ertapenem with a rising incidence den-
sity of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa.175 Ertapenem use had
no impact on the susceptibility of A. baumannii to imipenem.176
Prolonged infusion therapy with meropenem for MDR GNB
including carbapenem-resistant organisms has been advocated on
pharmacokinetic grounds in children for A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa
and Enterobacteriaceae with meropenem MICs up to 8mg/L.177
There is a general trend towards considering continuous infusion of
b-lactams in critically ill patients with severe Gram-negative sepsis
(see Section 7.18).178 Continuous infusion meropenem has been
assessed in 375 obese patients for its ability to produce steady-state
levels above the MIC at levels from 2 to .16mg/L.179 Dosing nomo-
grams to sustain this had previously been constructed in critical care
patients.180
Meropenem

vaborbactam
(RPX7009),
a
boronic-acid-derived b-lactamase inhibitor, is progressing through
Phase 3 trials and may cover Enterobacteriaceae strains producing
KPC carbapenemases but not those with MBLs or OXA-48-like
enzymes. Some isolates with OmpK36 porin loss (see Sections
6.3.3 and 6.7) are resistant.38 Relebactam in combination with imi-
penem/cilastatin is entering Phase 3 trials with trials against
imipenem-resistant bacteria compared with a combination of coli-
stin and imipenem/cilastatin and a comparative study against
piperacillin/tazobactam
in
ventilator-associated
pneumonia.
Phase 2 studies are as yet unpublished. In vitro studies show no
enhanced activity against Acinetobacter spp. but activity against
KPC-producing K. pneumoniae (unless it has an OmpK36 porin loss,
which is responsible for meropenem resistance; see Sections 6.3.3
and 6.7), and many but not all P. aeruginosa with enhanced AmpC
production and depressed oprD.37

-27 and -9 enzymes predominate in parts of China (and Spain) and
have weak activity against ceftazidime as compared with CTX-M-15
enzymes with lower ceftazidime MICs. The higher CLSI susceptible
breakpoint (�4mg/L) was found to classify 34% of CTX-M-positive
E. coli as susceptible to ceftazidime with normal inocula. Most CTX-M-
14 isolates became resistant at higher inocula.185 The EUCAST

Ceftazidime is active against some OXA-48-producing CPE, principally
those that do not co-produce ESBLs or AmpC enzymes. Ceftazidime
retains activity against many isolates of P. aeruginosa, including in the
presence of mutation to imipenem or ciprofloxacin resistance.187
However, strains with derepressed class C (AmpC) b-lactamases or
strongly up-regulated efflux mechanisms are resistant, as are strains
producingMBLs, other carbapenemases or ESBLs.

penemase-producing strains.

7.3 Ceftazidime/avibactam
Ceftazidime has recently beencombined withthe b-lactamase inhib-
itor avibactam. This combination has broad Gram-negative activity
including
Enterobacteriaceae
and
P.
aeruginosa.
Ceftazidime-
susceptible bacteria remain susceptible to the combination, but avi-
bactam protects additionally against class A (TEM, SHV, CTX-M, KPC)
class C (AmpC) and some class D (OXA) b-lactamases.188–192
Ceftazidime/avibactam has no inhibitory activity against the MBLs
(NDM-1, IMP and VIM) but it is the first BL/BLI combination to retain
activity against KPC-2 carbapenemase-producing and most OXA-48
carbapenemase-producing strains. Ceftazidime/avibactam has mini-
mal activity against Acinetobacter spp., anaerobic or Gram-positive
organisms.190,193,194 A recent susceptibility study that included 120
KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae collected from US hospitals found
that ceftazidime/avibactam had MIC50/90 values of 0.5/2mg/L.195
The first case series of use of ceftazidime/avibactam against
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has recently been pub-
lished.196 Among 37 patients with severe infections due to these
organisms, 31 had strains with KPC carbapenemases. Resistance to
ceftazidime/avibactam emerged independently in three cases
infected by K. pneumoniae ST258 with KPC-3 enzymes. In two of
these isolates meropenem MICs were reduced �4-fold to the sus-
ceptible range in parallel with the rise in ceftazidime/avibactam
MICs. The overall clinical success rate was 59% of patients whilst
microbiological failure occurred in 10 patients, including the 3
patients where resistantmutants were selected. Anearlierepidemio-
logical study had shown that ceftazidime/avibactam median MICs of
ceftazidime/avibactam are higher for KPC-3-producing isolates than
those with KPC-2 enzymes, although it was unclear if this represents
enzyme specificity or quantity.197 Isolates that produce KPC-3
enzyme are internationally widespread, including in South America
and Southern Europe. Ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant isolates with
similar or identical mutations can be selected in vitro.198 The mecha-
nism involves the enzyme becoming a stronger ceftazidime-
destroying enzyme, not in it becoming avibactam resistant. The
licensing of avibactam (a non-b-lactam b-lactamase inhibitor) with
ceftazidime offers a new choice where organisms that produce both
AmpC and an ESBL, or KPC2 carbapenemase cause systemic
infection.
In Phase 2 double-blind randomized trials, the efficacy of ceftazi-
dime/avibactam was similar to that of imipenem/cilastatin in the
treatment of complicated UTI (19/27 and 21/35 respectively).199

plicated UTI or pyelonephritis, with patients not selected for antibi-

son of meropenem against ceftazidime/avibactam with metronida-
zole in 1066 complicated intra-abdominal infections, with the
exclusion of a standardized set of highest-mortality surgical indica-
tions, again showed equivalence.202 On ITT analysis response rates
were 82.5% to the ceftazidime/avibactam or metronidazole combi-
nation and 84.9% to meropenem. There was no difference in
patient outcome in the combination arm if a ceftazidime-resistant
strain of Enterobacteriaceae was present or absent. Only one case
of C. difficile was recognized in either arm of the study. An RCT of cef-
tazidime/avibactam and metronidazole against meropenem of 333
patients, largely with patients with complicated UTI but with some
patients treated for intra-abdominal infections, all with infections
with ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa,
showed 91% response rates at a test-of-cure visit.203 None of these
patients was infected with carbapenemase-producing strains.
Evidence
Ceftazidime/avibactam has similar efficacy to carbapenems in
abdominal and complicated UTI, the former requiring combination
of ceftazidime/avibactam with metronidazole.
Evidence level: 1!
Although clinical experience is limited in MDR GNB largely to
ceftazidime-resistant organisms in complicated UTI, it would be
expected to be effective when OXA-48-producing MDR GNB cause
infection.
Evidence level: 4
Clinical experience against Klebsiella spp. producing KPC carba-
penemase is limited but, ominously, efficacy is only some 60%

7.4 Ceftolozane/tazobactam
Ceftolozane is an oxyimino-cephalosporin that has been combined
with tazobactam. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is active against many
Gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacteriaceae and
P. aeruginosa.193,204,205 It is active against P. aeruginosa isolates
that are resistant to standard agents such as ceftazidime because
of derepressed AmpC b-lactamases or up-regulated efflux. In
terms of MIC, ceftolozane is the most active b-lactam against
P. aeruginosa, with resistance (MIC 4 mg/L EUCAST) largely con-
fined to those with MBLs or unusual ESBLs such as VEB and GES
types. MIC50/90 values against 310 MDR isolates of P. aeruginosa
were 2/8 mg/L.205 Activity against Acinetobacter spp. is variable.193
Ceftolozane/tazobactam has in vitro activity against Enterobacter-
iaceae producing ESBLs including most TEM, SHV, and CTX-M
types.205–207 Since oxyimino-cephalosporins are stable to the
inhibitor-resistant OXA-1 enzyme, ceftolozane is not compromised
by co-production of this enzyme in CTX-M-15-producing Entero-
bacteriaceae as happens with piperacillin/tazobactam. Activity is
less against ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp., possibly owing to high
ESBL levels arising from production of additional SHV enzymes.208
Activity against Enterobacteriaceae with copious AmpC enzyme is
variable, but many Enterobacter spp. with derepressed AmpC are
resistant. The combination has no activity against strains with
MBLs (NDM-1, IMP and VIM) or against those with KPC carbapene-
mases. Ceftazidime-resistant strains with OXA-48-like enzymes
are mostly resistant: ceftazidime-susceptible OXA-48 producers
are susceptible to ceftolozane/tazobactam (D. M. Livermore,
unpublished data).
Ceftolozane/tazobactam therefore has potentially different
uses from ceftazidime/avibactam and should not be used in infec-
tions due to AmpC- or KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The
absence of clinical comparisons of piperacillin/tazobactam and
ceftolozane/tazobactam means that choices must be made on
in vitro grounds. The apparent enhanced activity of ceftolozane/
tazobactam against strains that co-produce the enzyme OXA-1,
including the internationally prevalent E. coli ST131 lineage, needs
full laboratory and clinical verification but may make this drug
more likely to produce clinical cure. Caution on clinical outcome is
necessary because of the potential, as with ceftazidime/avibac-
tam, for superinfection with C. difficile. Ceftolozane activity against
P. aeruginosa including ceftazidime-resistant strains in vitro may
offer clinical advantages where MDR Pseudomonas infections are a
problem, such as in cystic fibrosis,209 but this needs confirmation in
a clinical trial. Optimal dosing in cystic fibrosis needs to be estab-
lished but the drug’s pharmacokinetics appears to be the same as
in unaffected patients.210
Ceftolozane/tazobactam is licensed, at present, for compli-
cated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract
infection.211 In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial,
993 hospitalized patients with complicated intra-abdominal infec-
tion received either ceftolozane/tazobactam (1.5 g q8h iv) plus
metronidazole, or meropenem (1g q8h iv) for 4–14days.212 Non-
inferiority was demonstrated overall and MIC was not related to
outcome. In 50 patients an ESBL-producing organism was iso-
lated. In these patients, the clinical cure rate was 95.8% (23/24) in
the ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole group and 88.5%
(23/26) in the meropenem group. In patients with CTX-M-14/15
ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, clinical cure was observed in
13 of 13 (100%) and 8 of 11 (72.7%) patients, respectively.
A double-dummy, double-blinded RCT compared ceftolozane/
tazobactam against levofloxacin in 1083 patients with complicated
UTI.213 Patients received ceftolozane/tazobactam (1.5 g q8h iv) or
intravenous levofloxacin (750 mg q24h). The majority of partici-
pants (82%) had pyelonephritis. Overall, ceftolozane/tazobactam
was found to be non-inferior in clinical and superior in microbiologi-
cal outcome to levofloxacin therapy. In the ITT population, 20/731
(2.7%) of Gram-negative pathogens were resistant to ceftolozane/
tazobactam at baseline, whereas 195/731 (26.7%) were resistant
to levofloxacin. Two (0.3%) of 594 E. coli isolates were resistant to

 ceftolozane/tazobactam and 144/594 (24.2%) were resistant to
levofloxacin. For patients with levofloxacin-resistant uropathogens
(based on CLSI criteria) clinical cure was seen in 90 (90.0%) of 100
patients in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group compared (surpris-
ingly) with 86/112 (76.8%) in the levofloxacin group. In patients
with ESBL-producing uropathogens, cure with ceftolozane/tazo-
bactam was 55/61 (90.2%) compared with 42/57 (73.7%) for levo-
floxacin (95% CI 2.6–30.2). Treatment choice in complicated UTI
and pyelonephritis involving MDR GNB between piperacillin/tazo-
bactam, carbapenems, ceftolozane/tazobactam, temocillin or cef-
tazidime/avibactam depends on the bacteria present and their
patterns of susceptibility.
Evidence
Ceftolozane/tazobactam is not active against CPE strains, except-
ing ceftazidime-susceptible OXA-48 producers, but otherwise,
when combined with metronidazole, is non-inferior to meropenem
in intra-abdominal infection.

7.5 Aztreonam
Aztreonam is labile to AmpC and ESBL enzymes. It is stable to MBLs
and OXA-48-like carbapenemases but most Enterobacteriaceae
with these enzymes also express ESBLs or AmpC, which confer
resistance.214,215 Isolates with MBLs or OXA-48 and no ESBL or
AmpC production may be susceptible (those with OXA-48 alone are
likely also to be susceptible to ceftazidime and ceftolozane/tazobac-
tam). At EUCAST breakpoints (S �1mg/L, R .16mg/L) most P. aeru-
ginosa are intermediate in susceptibility and the drug is usually less
active than ceftazidime or ceftolozane/tazobactam except against
MBL producers resistant to all other b-lactams, which may be inter-
mediate (rarely susceptible) to aztreonam.
An aztreonam/avibactam combination is in Phase 2 develop-
ment. This creates a combination with very promising activity
against Enterobacteriaceae with MBLs, OXA-48, AmpC, ESBLs and
other
b-lactamases
(including
AmpC,
OXA-1
and
CTX-M
class).214,215,216
Evidence
Aztreonam is not active against Gram-negative bacteria producing
ESBLs, AmpC or KPC carbapenemase; it is only moderately active
against P. aeruginosa.

It is stable to MBLs but strains possessing these often have ESBL
or AmpC as well, resulting in resistance. Similar limitations apply to
strains with OXA-48-like enzymes.

Combination with a b-lactamase inhibitor such as avibactam
would potentially make aztreonam useful against MBL (NDM, IMP
and VIM)-producing bacteria that also have ESBLs or AmpC
enzymes.

teria even if these appear susceptible in vitro.

7.6 Cefepime
Cefepime is not available in the UK. It appeared to be active in vitro
against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, especially when the
old NCCLS/CLSI breakpoint of �8 mg/L was used. A retrospective,
case-controlled study compared the clinical and microbiological
responses for 10 infections due to ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp.
and E. coli from a non-urinary source with 20 matched controls
receiving cefepime for non-ESBL strains. Four patients with ESBL
producers had strains that were resistant to cefepime by broth
microdilution MIC, one of whom responded: three of the remaining
six with strains then regarded as susceptible (NCCLS/CLSI break-
point MIC �8 mg/L) failed on treatment. Patients receiving cefe-
pime for infection with ESBL-producing bacteria were 9.7 times
more likely to have an unsuccessful clinical and microbiological
response
than
those
with
non-ESBL-producing
bacteria.217
A randomized evaluator-controlled trial of ICU patients compared
cefepime with imipenem for the treatment of hospital-acquired
pneumonia. The failure rate was 31% in the cefepime group com-
pared with 0% in the imipenem group. Cefepime MICs of 2–4 mg/L,
then interpreted as susceptible by the NCCLS/CLSI breakpoint of
�8 mg/L but now regarded as susceptible dose-dependent by

 current CLSI and intermediate by EUCAST criteria, were noted in
strains from treatment failures.218 A retrospective case–control
study of cefepime-susceptible bacteraemia caused by ESBL pro-
ducers in the period 2012–17 compared 30day mortality amongst
17 patients treated with cefepime versus 161 cases treated with a
carbapenem.219 Mortality in the cefepime group was 58.8% versus
16.8% for carbapenem treatment and, in multivariate analysis,
cefepime treatment was strongly associated with mortality
(OR 9.9, 95% CI 2.8–319; P " 0.001). Mortality with cefepime in
definitive treatment was also related to MIC, being 16.7% (1/6) in
those with an MIC �1 mg/L, 45% (5/11) in those with an MIC of
2–8 mg/L and 100% (4/4) in those with an MIC of �16mg/L.220 In
a retrospective study of 305 adults with monomicrobial E. cloacae
infections, those with MICs of 4–8 mg/L (i.e. with CLSI dose-
dependent susceptibility and straddling the EUCAST intermediate/
resistant breakpoint) had significantly higher mortality than those
treated with a carbapenem (71.4% versus 18.2%; P "0.045).14
Fifty-eight percent of strains in the cefepime-treated group pro-
duced an ESBL in addition to AmpC. In those definitively treated
with cefepime, ESBL production (16/40 versus 3/32; P " 0.006) and
susceptible dose-dependent strains (10/16 versus 9/56; P � 0.001)
were independently associated on multivariate analysis with
increased mortality.14 ESBL production was more frequent in those
strains with cefepime MICs of 4–8 mg/L (32/36 compared with
61/138 with MIC �2 mg/L; P � 0.001). Mortality was not reduced
even when high-dose regimens (2g q8h iv) were used. Mortality in
infections due to ESBL non-producers (with median MICs of
0.5 mg/L) treated with definitive cefepime was similar to that in
those that received definitive carbapenem therapy (9/56 versus
16/72; P " 0.5). This study demonstrates the efficacy of cefepime
against the presumptive AmpC producer E. cloacae but only in the
absence of additional ESBL production or absence of MIC 2 mg/L.
Nevertheless, in another retrospective study between 2005
and 2007, for bacteraemia due to ESBL-producing pathogens,
receipt of empirical cefepime alone (n " 43) was associated
with increased mortality compared with cefepime combination
(n " 69) or carbapenem combination (n " 44) regimens: mortality
was unlinked to MIC, being 5/13 for those with organisms having
MIC �2 mg/L, 2/6 for those having MICs of 4 or 8 mg/L and 10/24
for those having MICs �16mg/L.221
The concept of ‘susceptible dose dependent’ isolates of
Enterobacteriaceae was suggested by CLSI in order to maximize
cefepime use and spare carbapenems, but these findings suggest
this is unwise. A recent systematic review did not support the
use of cefepime in empirical therapy of critically ill patients when
ESBL-producing E coli or Klebsiella spp. infection is suspected. Even
in patients with ESBL strains susceptible to cefepime (�2 mg/L
CLSI; ,1 mg/L EUCAST), treatment failure can be seen.220
Evidence
Cefepime has a higher failure rate in treatment of infections due to
ESBL-producing GNB than carbapenems unless cefepime MICs are
�1 mg/L.
Evidence level: 2!
Bacteraemia due to E. cloacae strains without ESBLs and with
MIC �2 mg/L ,8 mg/L can be successfully treated with cefepime.

7.7 Cefoxitin
Cefoxitin, the original parenteral cephamycin, was developed by
Merck and is now a generic. It is no longer available in Europe but
has several suppliers in the USA. Cefoxitin was licensed at the same
time as second-generation cephalosporins such as cefuroxime but
differs in having activity against gut Bacteroides spp. but minimal
activity against Haemophilus influenzae. Cefoxitin is on the list of for-
gotten antibiotics that may be useful against MDR GNB.222 It is active
against ESBL-producing E. coli but is not active against AmpC-
inducible species of Enterobacteriaceae, e.g. Enterobacter spp.,
C. freundii, Serratia spp., M. morganii and Providencia stuartii, nor
against P. aeruginosa. Cefoxitin differs from temocillin (which has a
6-a-methoxy group corresponding to the 7-a-methoxy group of
cefoxitin) in having activity against Gram-positive bacteria including
penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-
susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, which may be advantageous if a
urinary infection is diagnosed but the patient actually has infection
due to these organisms elsewhere.
EUCAST no longer cites MIC breakpoints but BSAC had a break-
point of S ,8mg/L and R .8mg/L. Typical MICs for E. coli and
Klebsiella spp. are slightly below this level, meaning that small
reductions in susceptibility can confer resistance. These can arise by
reductions in permeability or (in E. coli only) by mutation in promoter
or attenuator sequences for ampC. Cefoxitin resistance is very com-
mon in the Middle East, India and China. In a multicentre study of
1762 isolates from urinary infection in the Asia–Pacific region 50.3%
of strains were resistant to cefoxitin.223 Resistance also occurs in E.
coli and Klebsiella spp., from plasmid-mediated AmpC production.
Porin loss combined with other mechanisms of b-lactam resistance,
such as ESBL production, is described as emerging during treatment
of some Klebsiella infections (see Sections 6.3.3 and 6.7).
Cefoxitin is used in selective media for C. difficile and would be
expected to trigger infection with this pathogen. In one recent
study antibiotic prophylaxis with cefoxitin was an independent risk
factor for C. difficile infection.224 The absolute frequency at which
this will occur relative to other antibiotics is not known.
In murine models of pyelonephritis cefoxitin was effective
against an OXA-1- and CTX-M-15-producing transconjugant
E. coli225 and in combination with fosfomycin prevented selec-
tion for fosfomycin-resistant mutants.226 Only one human trial
of cefoxitin against current ESBL producers has been reported.
In that 2015 French study, largely of urinary and catheter-
related bacteraemia, 30/33 patients responded in the first 48 h
and 20/24 patients responded who were evaluable at follow-
up.

 emergence of resistance in two patients with Klebsiella infec-
tion.227 A pharmacological model suggests 1 h infusion of 2 g
four times daily would be effective.228
Although cefoxitin appears active against CTX-M-15-producing
E. coli and Klebsiella spp., it lacks temocillin’s activity against strains
with copious inducible, derepressed229 or plasmid-mediated AmpC.
Cefoxitin may be more prone than temocillin to select C. difficile.230
Temocillin, unlike cefoxitin, has no Gram-positive spectrum so in
empirical use in the elderly where it is not clear if the urinary tract or
the chest/skin is the source of infection, it may need supplementa-
tion with another antibiotic. It is not clear if cefoxitin’s reintroduction
would offer any sustainable or competitive advantage apart from
its carbapenem-sparing capacity as its four-times daily intravenous
dosing makes it only usable in inpatient treatment, not OPAT.
Evidence
Cefoxitin is an intravenous cephamycin antibiotic, formerly
licensed in the UK. Inducible, derepressed or plasmid-mediated
AmpC production confers resistance, as does porin loss, especially
in association with ESBL production. Nevertheless, in vitro, animal
and human studies indicate activity against ESBL-producing
strains of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Treatment can be complicated
by emergence of resistance due to porin loss.
Evidence level: 3.
Recommendations
• Could use as a carbapenem-sparing agent for infections caused
by CTX-M-15-producing E. coli but is only suitable for inpatient
use, not OPAT, because of the short serum half-life. Narrower
Gram-negative spectrum than temocillin so less suitable for
empirical use in UTI.

tional recommendation for use restricted to trials
7.8 Temocillin
Temocillin is a semi-synthetic 6-a-methoxy derivative of ticarcillin
that is highly stable to most b-lactamases except MBLs (e.g. IMP,
NDM and VIM) and OXA-48-like enzymes. It lacks activity against
anaerobes, Gram-positive bacteria and most Gram-negative non-
fermenters
such
as
P.
aeruginosa
and
Acinetobacter
spp.
It retains in vitro activity against ESBL- and AmpC-producing
Enterobacteriaceae231,232 and some KPC-producing E. coli and
Klebsiella pneumoniae,233 and Burkholderia cepacia complex.234 It is
active against Enterobacteriaceae strains whose AmpC production
is stably derepressed.235 No EUCAST breakpoint for susceptibility to
the drug has yet been published but the CA-SFM has a rate of
S�8mg/L, R.8mg/L and the BSAC had a systemic value of S
�8mg/L, R .8mg/L and an uncomplicated UTI value of S�32mg/L,
R. 32 mg/L. MICs of temocillin for KPC-producing bacteria are in the
range of 4–32mg/L (mode 16mg/L). In a lethal mouse model of
intra-abdominal infection using strains of KPC-producing E. coli,
temocillin was effective against KPC-2.236 Temocillin has poor activ-
ity against carbapenem-resistant isolates of Enterobacteriaceae
lacking carbapenemases—presumptively due to porin loss.237 This
antibiotic has no activity against OXA-48- or MBL-producing
strains.238 Caution is also needed in predicting results of treatment
of systemic infections from in vitro susceptibility and further trials of
temocillin alone at defined and possibly greater doses than the
licensed 2g twice daily are necessary. Outcomes should be corre-
lated with MIC.
At present, clinical studies are limited to non-comparative ser-
ies. The largest multicentre study (non-randomized retrospective
case series) involved 92 patients who were treated with at least
3 days of therapy.239 Urinary tract and bacteraemia (42 episodes
each) were the most frequent indications followed by hospital-
acquired pneumonia. Dosages of �4 g/day, rather than 1 g twice
daily, were associated with improved outcome. Patients with
strains producing AmpC or ESBL enzymes responded microbiologi-
cally in 23/27 or 18/22 cases in respectively UTI or bacteraemia.
Higher dosage regimens, including 2 g three times daily and 6 g by
continuous infusion, and use in veno-venous haemofiltration
are reported in the literature with suggestions that these improve
efficacy in critically ill patients. These data have led to a modifi-
cation of the licensed posology with the usual dose increased to
4 g/day and the higher dose, particularly in critically ill patients,
to 6 g/day.240 In a retrospective case review of bacteraemia
caused by KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 14/14 patients
treated with temocillin either alone or in combination survived,
whereas 6/30 treated similarly with tigecycline died.241 Two stud-
ies have been published on the use of temocillin in cystic fibrosis
patients with B. cepacia complex and sometimes P. aeruginosa.
Both were retrospective non-randomized audits, the first showing
equivalence of combinations of temocillin with tobramycin versus
other agents with tobramycin against Burkholderia cenocepacia
and the second showing that 18/32 courses of temocillin resulted
in improvement in the patient’s infection.242,243
Evidence
Temocillin at a dose of 2g twice daily is an effective and well toler-
ated drug for UTI and bacteraemia with AmpC- or ESBL-producing
bacterial infection.
Evidence level: 3
Although in vitro work suggests activity against many KPC-
producing bacteria, there is little published clinical evidence to support
this. Respiratory infections, including CF infections with B. cepacia,
and other sites of systemic infection requires further clinical trials.

7.9 Ampicillin/sulbactam
Sulbactam has in vitro microbiological activity against some strains
of A. baumannii, including some carbapenem-resistant lineages.

 Microbiological studies showed that sulbactam alone (without
ampicillin) was active against these bacteria.244 In an uncontrolled
study, 42 patients with infections caused by MDR A. baumannii
were treated with sulbactam or ampicillin/sulbactam. Eighteen
received sulbactam alone and 24 received ampicillin/sulbactam;
no difference in cure rate was observed between the two groups.
Another study compared ampicillin/sulbactam with colistin ther-
apy in a retrospective review of patients who had nosocomial
infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp.
from 1996 to 2004.245 Eighty-two patients received polymyxins
and 85 were treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. The authors con-
cluded that ampicillin/sulbactam appeared to be more efficacious
than polymyxins. More generally, and predictably, multivariate
analysis found that prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality
were older age, septic shock and higher APACHE II score. A small
retrospective non-blinded trial compared treatment with ampicil-
lin/sulbactam versus imipenem and tried also to address the bene-
fit of combining ampicillin/sulbactam with colistin. There was no
difference in outcome.246,247 Two small RCTs have tried to assess
differences in dosing regimens and efficacy compared with coli-
stin.248,249 Overall the evidence base is poor and interpretation is
difficult without consideration of the MIC for the organism. In con-
text, sulbactam MICs for most UK isolates of carbapenem-
resistant A. baumannii are 16–32mg/L, implying poor rates of sus-
ceptibility (D. M. Livermore, unpublished data).
Evidence
Ampicillin/sulbactam appears effective in treating infections due
to some carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. but many iso-
lates in the UK have relatively high sulbactam MICs.
Evidence level: 3
Recommendations
• Could use against some carbapenem-resistant, apparently
sulbactam-susceptible A. baumannii isolates. Caution needed
in the UK because of a higher range of MICs. Absence of a
breakpoint prevents categorization as susceptible/resistant.

7.10 Co-amoxiclav
Co-amoxiclav is a combination of the broad-spectrum amoxicillin
with the b-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. Co-amoxiclav
is known to select for Enterobacteriaceae resistant to the clavula-
nate component as well as amoxicillin in the gastrointestinal
flora.250 Co-amoxiclav has been successfully used to treat UTIs
due to ESBL producers, as described in case reports and an obser-
vational study.251,252 The cure rate among 37 patients with cystitis
treated with co-amoxiclav was 93% for those with susceptible
isolates (MIC �8 mg/L) and 56% for those with intermediate or
resistant isolates (MIC �16mg/L) (P " 0.02).251 The study was
performed in Spain, where many ESBL producers have CTX-M-14
enzyme;
in
the
UK
more
have
CTX-M-15
and
many
of
these co-produce OXA-1, an inhibitor-resistant penicillinase,
raising co-amoxiclav MICs to the intermediate or resistant
range. Furthermore, MIC determinations were done with a
b-lactam:b-lactamase inhibitor ratio of 2:1 and higher MICs would
likely be obtained using the fixed clavulanate concentration of
2 mg/L now advocated by EUCAST. The outcomes for bacterae-
mias treated with co-amoxiclav or piperacillin/tazobactam have
been reviewed and the findings are discussed in the section on
piperacillin/tazobactam (Section 7.11).253
Evidence
These studies suggest that co-amoxiclav is effective in lower UTIs
caused by ESBL-producing bacteria but efficacy was only reliably
predicted in strains where these organisms were fully susceptible
in vitro and lacked co-production of OXA-1 b-lactamase.
Evidence level: 3
Recommendations
• Use for lower UTI due to known ESBL-producing bacteria only if
current isolates, or, if using empirically, recent isolates, are fully
susceptible.
Grading: Conditional recommendation for
7.11 Piperacillin/tazobactam
Different susceptibility standards are used worldwide and so corre-
lations of mortality with in vitro susceptibility cannot be reliably
transferred between countries. EUCAST regards more isolates as
resistant than CLSI. Some countries, such as the UK, have a higher
prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae with CTX-M-15 and, in E. coli,
OXA-1 b-lactamase, and these are more resistant than the CTX-M-
14 ESBL producers circulating, for example, in Spain. This may
critically affect the validity of evidence collected from different lab-
oratories and hospitals about the adequacy of these combinations
against ESBL-producing bacteria.
The use of piperacillin/tazobactam for treating bacteraemias
caused by ESBL-producing bacteria consequently remains conten-
tious. One recent retrospective analysis of 331 patients in a US hos-
pital with bacteraemia due to ESBL-producing bacteria suggested
carbapenems were superior to piperacillin/tazobactam.254 One
hundred and three (48%) patients received piperacillin/tazobac-
tam empirically and 110 (52%) received carbapenems empirically.
The adjusted risk of death was 1.92 times higher for patients
receiving empirical piperacillin/tazobactam compared with empiri-
cal carbapenem therapy. Another retrospective study of bacterae-
mic patients with ESBL-producing P. mirabilis compared the
outcomes of patients treated with piperacillin/tazobactam or a
carbapenem for at least 48h.255 Forty-seven patients with avail-
able clinical data were studied, of whom 34 were included. Only
11% of strains were imipenem susceptible but MICs of the drug for
Proteeae typically clustered around the breakpoint. The overall
30day mortality rate was 29.8%. Three of 21 patients treated with
carbapenems (all imipenem) died within 30days (all in hospital)
versus 4/13 treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, a non-significant
difference. Furthermore, among those treated with piperacillin/
tazobactam, the mortality rate was lower in those infected by the
isolates with lower piperacillin/tazobactam MICs (�0.5/4 mg/L)
when compared with isolates with MICs of �1/4 mg/L (0/7 versus
3/5; P " 0.045). A study of 39 episodes of bacteraemia due to ESBL-
producing E. coli from Spain found a statistically significant reduc-
tion in 30day mortality in infections from non-urinary sources if
the MIC was �2 mg/L (0/11) compared with those strains with
higher MIC (7/17).256 This suggests that even the current EUCAST

 breakpoints (S ,8 mg/L, R .16mg/L) are too high to give guidance
on clinical response. An analysis of patients with bacteraemias due
to ESBL-producing E. coli was performed to assess the efficacy of
combinations of piperacillin/tazobactam or co-amoxiclav com-
pared with carbapenems.253 Mortality in patients treated with
such BL/BLI combinations or carbapenem was compared in two
cohorts: empirical therapy and definitive therapy. Mortality rates
at day 30 for those treated with BL/BLI versus carbapenems were
9.7% versus 19.4% for empirical therapy and 9.3% versus 16.7%
for definitive therapy respectively. After adjustment for confound-
ers, no association was found between either empirical therapy or
definitive therapy and increased mortality. The study suggested
that co-amoxiclav and piperacillin/tazobactam may be suitable
alternatives to carbapenems for treating patients with bacterae-
mias due to ESBL-producing E. coli but only in the minority that
were susceptible in vitro. The study was not randomized, and con-
founding due to unmeasured variables may have occurred. This
retrospective observational study has been repeated on a multina-
tional basis and extended to 627 patients and showed that BL/BLI
combinations were statistically as effective as carbapenems in
empirical and directed therapy against ESBL-producing Gram-neg-
ative bacteraemia.257 A subset of 207 patients had the ESBL genes
of their pathogens examined by PCR: 42 were identified as CTX-M-
15, 27 as CTX-M-1, 31 as CTX-M-14 and 18 as CTX-M-9. No details
were given of response rates in relation to the presence of specific
resistance genes and co-production of OXA enzymes was not
sought. In another study co-amoxiclav and piperacillin/tazobac-
tam susceptibility of the bacteria causing bacteraemia, particularly
for E. coli ST131, were not correlated: 51% of the isolates also had
OXA-1 and 90% of isolates were reported susceptible to piperacil-
lin/tazobactam versus 26% susceptible to co-amoxiclav by CLSI
criteria.258 Such discrepancies with different BL/BLIs may relate to
whether the EUCAST or CLSI breakpoints are used, as the MICs for
many isolates with a combination of CTX-M-15 and OXA-1
enzymes cluster around 16mg/L. The relationship of the BL/BLI
used and its MIC for the infecting strain with efficacy in lower UTIs
(where urinary concentrations are higher than in serum) or bacter-
aemia needs to be established. More generally, individual drug/
inhibitor combinations must be separately studied for efficacy, and
related to both the b-lactamase genes present and in vitro sus-
ceptibility. As American commentators have pointed out,259 it is
important to note the dosing regimen when considering the
response to piperacillin/tazobactam of many ESBLs. Many Spanish
studies used piperacillin/tazobactam at 4.5 g q6h, not the usual
licensed UK dose of 4.5 g q8h. For b-lactams, increasing the time
above the MIC substantially decreases mortality.260 It is possible
that more frequent dosing would achieve this. More materially,
this can be achieved with continuous infusion, albeit with higher
daily drug dosage (which might breach targets to reduce use) and
could be considered to increase efficacy of piperacillin/tazobac-
tam. It cannot be anticipated with biliary excretion whether this
will change selection pressure for superinfecting organisms or
C. difficile in the gastrointestinal flora.
A retrospective case review of empirical treatment of bacterae-
mia caused by ESBL-producing E. coli or ESBL-producing Klebsiella
spp. showed a mortality rate of 18/70 (25.7%) when patients
received carbapenems. If they received piperacillin/tazobactam
8/44 (18.2%) died if the strain was retrospectively susceptible by
CLSI criteria, but 3/6 died if the strain was resistant or intermediate.
Similarly, if they received co-amoxiclav 3/40 (7.5%) died if the
strain was retrospectively susceptible by CLSI criteria, but 10/27
(37%) died if the strain was resistant or intermediate to piperacil-
lin/tazobactam.261 Data on the genotypes of the ESBL producers
present were not provided.
The findings of all these studies cannot be simply applied to the
UK, where many ESBL-producing strains are more resistant than
CTX-M-14, as they co-produce CTX-M-15 and OXA-1 b-lactamases,
with the latter enzyme compromising susceptibility to piperacillin/
tazobactam. Variable dosing further complicates the picture.
Piperacillin/tazobactam is commonly used to treat infections
caused by P. aeruginosa. A retrospective cohort study of bacterae-
mic patients showed that in 34 episodes of bacteraemia caused by
strains with a piperacillin/tazobactam MIC of 32 or 64mg/L, the
30day mortality was significantly greater than that for controls
given other appropriate therapy.262 At the time, CLSI defined
strains as susceptible if they had an MIC of �64mg/L whereas
EUCAST, then as now, has a breakpoint for susceptibility of
�16!4 mg/L and for resistance .16!4 mg/L.
Evidence
Could use piperacillin/tazobactam in some bloodstream infections
where ESBL producers appear susceptible in vitro but mortality
may be higher than with carbapenems.

broad-spectrum
aminoglycosides
are
potentially
important carbapenem-sparing drugs for infections due to MDR-
GNB. Three such antibiotics, gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin,

 remain available in the UK following the withdrawal of netilmicin
and sisomicin. These antibiotics have intrinsic activity against all
P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacteriaceae, but
plasmid-borne
resistance
(and
chromosomal
resistance
in
Providencia spp. and Serratia spp.) now limits their spectrum.
Resistance is mostly due to: (i) bacterial aminoglycoside-modifying
enzymes, which acetylate, phosphorylate or adenylate vulnerable
hydroxyl or amino groups; or (ii) 16S ribosomal methyltransfer-
ases, which alter the binding site for aminoglycosides. The latter
mechanism produces pan-resistance to aminoglycosides except
the veterinary product apramycin.263 By contrast, the vulnerability
of aminoglycosides to modifying enzymes varies, with amikacin
inactivated by fewer enzymes than gentamicin or tobramycin.264
Initially aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were restricted to
certain species but integron and transposon carriage have medi-
ated their wide dissemination.
Amikacin evades AAC(3) and AAC(20) enzymes but remains vul-
nerable to AAC(60)-I as does tobramycin. AAC(60)-Ib-cr arose from
AAC(60)-Ib by the substitutions Trp102Arg and Asp179Tyr and can
acetylate ciprofloxacin (but not levofloxacin) as well as aminogly-
cosides causing their deactivation. This enzyme, formerly rare in
the UK,265 is commonly found in E. coli ST131. Amikacin MICs typi-
cally are raised to just below the susceptible breakpoint. Such
reductions nevertheless may be important since efficacy of amino-
glycosides is proportional to the ratio of peak concentration to
MIC.266 EUCAST currently suggests that reports on isolates with this
enzyme are edited to amikacin resistant but this is under review.
In contrast to other common aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes,
AAC(60)-I spares gentamicin. Aminoglycoside-nucleotidyl transfer-
ases (ANT-6, ANT-9, ANT-40, ANT-200 and ANT-300) do not confer
amikacin resistance nor [except APH (3)-V1, which is mostly con-
fined to A. baumannii] do aminoglycoside phosphotransferases in
Gram-negative species.
Overall the resistance rate to gentamicin in community-onset
E. coli bacteraemia in 2012–14 was 8.6%. This is a similar figure to
the 8.7% resistance rate to piperacillin/tazobactam in community-
onset cases. Such data must be considered when empirically treat-
ing probable Gram-negative bacteraemia of likely urinary or
unknown origin.94 In the 1980s, parenteral aminoglycoside ther-
apy rarely selected for resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the gut
flora,267 but oral aminoglycosides given for selective digestive
decontamination in haematological malignancy frequently did
so268 and continued to do so over a 20year period once resistance
emerged, even when combined with oral colistin.269
There is limited surveillance of the genotypic distribution of
aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes except in specific strains and
in those with other resistances (e.g. ESBL producers). Little is
known of travel associations beyond those with gentamicin and
tobramycin (but to a lesser extent amikacin) associated with
acquisition of ESBL or carbapenemase producers, for which there
are clear links with travel.270
Aminoglycoside activity against P. aeruginosa varies between
patients with cystic fibrosis, where aminoglycosides continue to be
heavily used, and patients with other comorbidities. Resistance
due to efflux pumps and permeability defects is common, as well
as aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Tobramycin, which has
greater intrinsic activity than gentamicin against this species (off-
setting its lower activity against Enterobacteriaceae) and which
causes less toxicity than gentamicin, continues to be the
aminoglycoside most likely to remain active. A recent meta-
analysis continues to suggest that use of b-lactam/aminoglyco-
side combinations in the absence of cystic fibrosis offers no statisti-
cally significant advantage in terms of outcome compared with
use of an active b-lactam alone.271
A
new
aminoglycoside,
plazomicin
(ACHN
490,
Achaeogen),272,273,274 has completed clinical trials. This evades
modification by almost all aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes
except the AAC(20) chromosomal enzymes of Providencia spp. It is,
however, compromised by the plasmid-mediated ArmA and Rmt
16S ribosomal methyltransferases, which are currently rare in
UK MDR GNB except in Enterobacteriaceae strains producing
NDM-1 carbapenemase263 or OXA-23 carbapenemase-producing
A. baumannii, which have spread globally over the last 10years.
Aminoglycosides have a narrow margin between being effec-
tive and toxic to the auditory and vestibular apparatus or to the
kidneys. They fell from favour as broader-spectrum b-lactams
were developed. For acceptably safe use, intervals between doses
are increased, usually to a minimum of once daily, but with doses
related to renal clearance and MIC and the presumption of a post-
antibiotic effect. If the dosage is based on the patient’s weight it is
possible, using a nomogram, to model the likely blood concentra-
tion at varying intervals after the dose. Measuring plasma levels
between 6 and 14h after the dose, usually now by immunoassay,
and relating these levels to the nomogram permits more precise
dosing intervals than those determined by measuring renal func-
tion. Nomograms for gentamicin and tobramycin at doses of
7 mg/kg275 and 5 mg/kg276 in adults have been constructed and
their use is associated with a low incidence of detected ototoxicity
(3/2184 cases in the former). The dosage recommendation for
amikacin is 15mg/kg/day, reflecting that amikacin MICs are 2- to
4-fold higher than gentamicin MICs for susceptible strains. Much
higher incidences of toxicity with all aminoglycosides are well
recorded and it is still common to encounter in the UK deficiencies
in: (i) weight-related dosage; (ii) dosage interval, especially if there
is renal impairment; (iii) measuring levels in every case; and
(iv) taking blood for assay at the correct interval after dosing and
recording both the time of administration and time of sample col-
lection to enable later interpretation of assay results by other staff.
Validation of expected and achieved serum levels has been under-
taken for the 7 mg/kg dose but not for the 5 mg/kg dose, which is
based on exclusion of some patients considered in the former
study. There is no validated nomogram for amikacin277 and immu-
noassays for this antibiotic are not widely available on automated
immunoassay platforms. There are no trial data on amikacin use
in E. coli ST131. Vestibular toxicity with all aminoglycosides com-
monly presents after the drug has been stopped and the patient
has left hospital.278,279 Toxicity can occur after normal courses of
five daily doses or even a single dose.278 Auditory toxicity is initially
often subclinical, requiring audiograms to detect it. The true inci-
dence of toxicity is difficult to determine. Renal toxicity can be
measured by quantitative renal function tests or qualitative urinary
renal tubular enzymes. These critical steps to safe use, as deter-
mined by case follow-up after the patient has left hospital, have
not yet been assessed for plazomicin, although there are no
described cases of toxicity yet in clinical trials. In older studies
before the adoption of once-daily regimens and weight-related
dosage, auditory toxicity appears to have been commoner with
amikacin than gentamicin, whilst vestibular toxicity rates were not

 significantly different;280 toxicity was commoner with increasing
age, paralleling a decline in renal function.281 This creates an issue,
insofar as infections with MDR GNB and ESBL producers occur more
frequently among those aged over 65years and especially over
75years. It is noteworthy that one recent Scottish national inter-
vention in surgery as part of targeted antimicrobial stewardship
measures to reduce the incidence of C. difficile by 30% in 2 years
was to substitute use of gentamicin for cephalosporins in prophy-
laxis in surgery. In Tayside, an interrupted time series with seg-
mented regression in 7666 patients undergoing orthopaedic
surgery (excluding fractured neck of femur), where two doses of
flucloxacillin 1 g and one dose of 4 mg/kg gentamicin were substi-
tuted for cefuroxime was performed. An unacceptable 94%
increase in acute kidney injury in gentamicin-treated patients
occurred and the gentamicin use was stopped.282 Patients under-
going implant surgery had a mean age of 71years and 36% had
received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the last year
and 38% received a diuretic, which are known cofactors for genta-
micin nephrotoxicity, but this was adjusted for in the study. One-
year mortality was higher in the acute kidney injury group (20.8%
versus 8.2%). There was no association of acute kidney injury in a
further 4816 patients in other surgical specialties where gentami-
cin was substituted. It is not certain whether the effect was due to
gentamicin, flucloxacillin, or the combination, or whether all
patients additionally received gentamicin bone cement.
Evidence
Aminoglycosides retain activity against a similar proportion of
Enterobacteriaceae
to
piperacillin/tazobactam
(8.6%–8.7%).
However, approximately 50% of ESBL-producing E. coli in the UK
are resistant to gentamicin and more to tobramycin.
Evidence level: 3
Overall resistance rates to amikacin are lower than to gentami-
cin and tobramycin in the UK. However, bacteria producing AAC(60)
are usually amikacin resistant and bacteria producing the AAC(60)-
Ib-cr enzymes, including many E. coli ST131, often have reduced
amikacin susceptibility. Strains producing NDM carbapenemase
often carry 16S ribosomal methyltransferases that confer high-
level pan-resistance to aminoglycosides, including amikacin and
plazomicin. 16S ribosomal methyltransferases are also frequent in
UK A. baumannii.

Phase 3 RCT with superiority to meropenem in complicated UTI, so
far reported only in a press release.
Evidence level: 3
Historically, parenteral aminoglycosides rarely proved selective
for resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in the faecal flora.
However, because of resistance linkage and carriage on transpo-
sons and integrons, aminoglycoside resistance may be selected by
use of other antibiotics.
Evidence level: 3
Evidence from travel-associated ESBL producers suggests that
aminoglycoside resistance may also be travel associated. The co-
carriage of 16S ribosomal methyltransferases by strains with NDM
carbapenemase linked to the Indian subcontinent is noteworthy.
Evidence level: 3
The narrow therapeutic index of aminoglycosides demands
attention to the detail of weight-related dosing and frequency
of doses, collection of blood at an appropriate time for assays,
and the careful interpretation of antibiotic assays by nomograms.
These actions are essential for adequately safe management of
patients treated with gentamicin and tobramycin. Similar modern
safety measures are likely to be necessary for amikacin and plazo-
micin but nomograms are not, and assays may not be widely
available.
Evidence level: 4
When strains are susceptible and safety measures are well
organized and reviewed in hospitals, gentamicin and tobramycin
are useful carbapenem-sparing agents for definitive treatment.

7.13 Polymyxins
The polymyxins are a group of five chemically different bactericidal
antibiotics (polymyxins A to E). Only polymyxin B and polymyxin E
(colistin) have been used in clinical practice. Intravenously admin-
istered colistin methane sulfonate is most widely used, and
requires conversion in the body to the active colistin molecule.

Gram-negative organisms, including most Enterobacteriaceae,
A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,
but are inactive against B. cepacia, Proteus spp., Providencia spp.,
Morganella spp. and Serratia marcescens. Resistance to colistin
occurs in some P. aeruginosa isolates283 but remains rare and
almost exclusive to cystic fibrosis isolates. Acquired colistin resist-
ance is generally rare but has become common in K. pneumoniae
in Italy. Colistin heteroresistance is defined as the emergence of
resistance to colistin in a subpopulation of an otherwise suscepti-
ble (MIC of �2 mg/L) population.284 This may be related to expo-
sure to suboptimal polymyxin concentrations. Detection of
resistance or heteroresistance is difficult,506 and is reviewed
elsewhere.507

tion (BMD) was made with VITEK2V

R and VITEK2V
R performed poorly against BMD
with very major error (VME) rates of 12% (EtestV
R) and 36%
(VITEK2V
R) for colistin.508 Poor performance of both PhoenixV
R and
VITEK2V
R with substantial under-reporting of resistance has been
reported when using these systems for testing Acinetobacter
baumanii.509
The difficulty of detecting colistin resistance in routine laborato-
ries was evident in a recent US study.287 Resistance to gentamicin
was rarer and tigecycline resistance commoner in colistin-
resistant isolates. Colistin resistance was associated with increased
hospital mortality. Most colistin resistance is chromosomally medi-
ated, involving various mutations that modulate two-component
regulatory
systems
(e.g.
pmrAB,
phoPQ
and
its
negative
regulator mgrB in the case of K. pneumoniae), leading to modifica-
tion of lipid A with moieties such as phosphoethanolamine or
4-amino-4-arabinose, or in rare instances to total loss of the lipo-
polysaccharide.288 Of concern is the recent reporting of plasmid-
mediated polymyxin resistance lipid A-modifying enzymes (MCR-1
and -2) that confer resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.24 MCR-1 was
first found in China but is now being detected worldwide, mainly in
Enterobacteriaceae of animal origin but also in occasional human
isolates. It remains much rarer than mutational resistance. China
plans to stop use of 8000tons of colistin in animal feed from April
2017. A recent study shows mcr-1 genes are very widespread
(50%–100%) in chicken in hatcheries, commercial farms and
supermarkets and a slaughterhouse in Shandong. Although
testing
of
hatcheries
was
negative,
NDM
carbapenemase-
producing E. coli were recovered from 21.8% of samples; 23% of
carbapenem-resistant E. coli tested MCR-1 positive and multiple
sequence types and NDM subtypes were found.289 There are wide-
spread reports of MCR-1 in the European (including UK) food
chain.510
Synergy studies suggested many years ago290–294 that poly-
myxins, trimethoprim and sulphonamides might be useful
together in therapy, and these studies need repeating with other
agents and newer strains.
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data have been lim-
ited, particularly in critically ill patients. Polymyxins were developed
before the advent of contemporary drug evaluation. Colistin meth-
ane sulfonate is an inactive prodrug converted in vivo to the active
drug and different brands may produce different concentrations of
active drug. Data suggested drug concentrations are very variable
and dosing in excess of data-sheet recommendations may be
required commonly on the basis of pharmacokinetic parame-
ters.295 Recently the FDA and EMA have made new, but different,
recommendations for intravenous colistin in patients with various
degrees of renal function. These have been assessed using data
from 162 adult critically ill patients with varying renal function.
A comparison showed that adequate serum levels with impaired
renal function were more likely to be attained with European
guidelines and a later paper suggests that in the critically ill target
concentrations are difficult to achieve if creatinine clearance is
�80mL/min/1.73 m2.296,297 Data are also now available on the
implications of haemodialysis.298 Therapeutic drug monitoring is
advisable, if available, and depends critically on maintaining stabil-
ity of the drug in separated plasma.
Colistin can be given intravenously, or in respiratory infection via
the aerosol route (typically in patients with cystic fibrosis, either
alone
or
combined
with
intravenous
administration),
or
intrathecally.
Polymyxin B or colistin sulphate can be given orally as a non-
absorbed major component of selective digestive decontamina-
tion regimens. Selective digestive decontamination has been
widely used for general infection prevention in neutropenia and
intensive care. Polymyxins given orally were widely added in hae-
matology to aminoglycosides, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole299
or ciprofloxacin269 to prevent emergence of resistance and in ICUs
to parenteral cephalosporins and oral tobramycin.300 Recent find-
ings that colistin resistance is difficult to detect accurately and that
its frequency is usually underestimated, the clear emergence in
China and elsewhere of plasmid-mediated resistance and the
emergence of colistin resistance in KPC-producing Klebsiella spp. in
Italy, China and the USA imply that it can no longer be relied on to
prevent emergence of resistant strains in patients who have
strains that are already frequently resistant to the drugs to which it
was added for protection. Use of colistin in all patients in such a
unit might well now become a mechanism for selection for XDR
GNB or indeed pan-drug resistant MDR GNB in the critical care and
haematology units where it is used. This is an enduringly contro-
versial area301 which we do not have space to fully review, but
such selection of colistin resistance in ESBL-producing Klebsiella
spp. in an ICU has already been reported.302 We consider that con-
tinued use of colistin-containing decontamination regimens
should be reviewed urgently within specialties303 and at the local
level, and in our judgement its use is now unwise.
Clinical reports and reviews of experience with colistin are rela-
tively encouraging, with side effects (principally nephrotoxicity and
neurotoxicity) observed less often than expected from historical
data.304–309 These studies are summarized in Table 6. In Italy strict
rules for the use of colistin are advocated to stop the spread of
colistin-resistant
KPC-producing
Klebsiella
spp.,
which
have
increased 3-fold in 4 years among bacteraemic patients. A case–
control study of this guidance showed associations of resistance
with previous colistin therapy, previous colonization or infection
with KPC-producing Klebsiella spp., and a Charlson comorbidity
score .3 (all of which were associated with mortality) and also
with neutropenia and more than three hospitalizations.310

 ventilator-associated pneumonia in several studies. Korbila and
colleagues311 demonstrated an improvement in outcome with the
addition of aerosolized colistin but no benefit was demonstrated in
another study.312 Both had methodological flaws. NICE has
recently reviewed the usefulness of aerosolized colistin or tobra-
mycin dry powders in patients with cystic fibrosis and concluded
there were some patients who would benefit from colistin dry
powder and there would be cost reduction.313
Polymyxin B is more toxic than colistin (polymyxin E) but has
the advantage of not requiring subject-variable conversion to an
active form. A recent retrospective cohort study compared
45 patients with P. aeruginosa bacteraemia treated with poly-
myxin B at a median dose of 141
+54mg/day usually in two div-
ided doses: 11 received .200 mg/day. Eighty-eight patients were
treated with a comparator (typically a b-lactam). The in-hospital
mortality was 66% in the arm treated with polymyxin B versus
28% for those treated with a comparator, even when matched for
mechanical ventilation and sepsis score, suggesting polymyxin B
was inferior.314 This was regardless of dosing regimens. A higher
dose (�200 mg/day) of polymyxin B was found to be associated
with reduced mortality but increased renal impairment in another
retrospective cohort study.315 We do not recommend use of poly-
myxin B in the light of these results.
Combinations including colistin are more effective than mono-
therapy in treating infections with K. pneumoniae carbapenemase
(KPC)-producing organisms (see Section 7.18).316,317
Nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity are the principal side effects
associated with parenteral administration of polymyxins. The tox-
icity demonstrated in earlier studies was almost certainly related
to lack of understanding of the drug’s pharmacokinetics/pharma-
codynamics (PK/PD) and the use of inappropriate doses.318 Studies
now suggest that age, high doses, prolonged courses, concomitant
vancomycin, hypoalbuminaemia and non-steroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs, are independent risk factors for nephrotoxic-
ity319,320 and it is likely that other nephrotoxic drugs are also
associated. Monitoring renal function closely is essential for
patients receiving colistin. Recent expert opinion suggests the risk–
benefit ratio should be carefully considered, with strategies applied
to reduce toxicity.321 There is no information on the relationship of
dose with reversible neurotoxicity or encephalopathy; in a recent
large paediatric series they occurred in 2% of patients.322
There are gaps in our knowledge about these agents. Although
they were developed some 70years ago they have only recently
been used extensively. Much of the current knowledge is summar-
ized in the Prato consensus report.323
Dosing of intravenous colistin remains contentious. In adult
cystic fibrosis patients, colistin is typically given at a standard dose
of 2 MU q8h. However, evidence is emerging that higher-dose regi-
mens may be more appropriate in the ICU setting (with therapeu-
tic drug monitoring: to target a peak of 5–15mg/L and a trough of
2–6 mg/L). A recent study of significant infections caused by a
range of MDR GNB suggested that a loading dose of 9 MU followed
by 4.5 MU q12h (reduced in renal impairment) was effective
(23/28 responses) and resulted in a reversible mild renal injury in
only five patients.324 Further clinical and PK/PD studies are required
to confirm appropriate regimens, including in relation to a loading
dose, combination therapy and the need for monitoring. In the
meantime EMA guidance should be followed.
Evidence
Colistin is effective in treatment of infections caused by MDR GNB
with low mortality at higher-than-previous, but well-controlled
dosage.
Evidence level: 3
The role of loading doses of colistin, monitoring of serum levels
and optimal combination therapy are inadequately researched.

7.14 Fluoroquinolones
Fluoroquinolones
suppress
susceptible
Enterobacteriaceae
in
the intestinal flora and also select for quinolone-resistant MDR
GNB.250,131 Such suppression has been used in neutropenic patients
alone or with colistin.269 The continued efficacy of this combination
in suppression and non-selection of resistance to either agent needs
re-establishing, with the increasing recognition of colistin resistance
that may well emerge alongside existing quinolone resistance.
Prophylaxis with quinolones alone in neutropenia against suscepti-
ble bacteraemia seems effective even when quinolone resistance
levels in the treated population reach a high level. Trials of with-
drawing prophylaxis have been reported and show problematic
increases in Gram-negative bacteraemia (see Section 6.5).
Fluoroquinolones (intravenous and oral) may be suitable for
complicated UTIs due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae if
there is no resistance in vitro; however, most ESBL-producing
strains in the UK are resistant to fluoroquinolones, including cipro-
floxacin and levofloxacin. Furthermore, quinolone resistance with-
out ESBL production is now frequent, particularly in the multiply
resistant if not MDR E. coli ST131.89 Newer quinolones in develop-
ment are unlikely to provide substantial additional benefits over
ciprofloxacin for infections due to Gram-negative pathogens.
Three observational clinical studies have assessed the relative
merits of quinolones and carbapenems for serious infections due
to ESBL-producing organisms.181,325,326 Two of these found that
carbapenems were superior to quinolones, although most strains
were quinolone susceptible, whereas one study found equivalent
effectiveness.
Fluoroquinolones have been used to treat infections caused by
S. maltophilia; however, resistance is not uncommon, so combina-
tion with one or more of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ceftazi-
dime or tigecycline has been proposed.327 These combinations
have not been shown to offer any advantages over trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole alone.
A wide range of resistance mechanisms exist; high-level resist-
ance almost always involves mutations in the genes encoding sub-
units of the target enzymes, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV
(gyrA and parC respectively), but reduced susceptibility can arise
from plasmid-acquired genes e.g. aac(60)-Ib-cr, oqxAB, qnrA, etc. or
via up-regulation of outer-membrane efflux pumps and porin
loss.328
Evidence
Quinolones are effective in treatment of complicated UTI caused
by susceptible ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria, but resist-
ance is common and limits their usefulness.
Evidence level: 2!
Recommendations
• Could use orally to treat UTI caused by MDR GNB that are sus-
ceptible.
Grading: Conditional recommendation for
7.15 Tigecycline and eravacycline
Tigecycline is a semisynthetic glycylglycine derivative of minocy-
cline and like other tetracyclines is bacteriostatic.329 The main
determinant of acquired plasmid-mediated resistance to older tet-
racyclines in Gram-negative bacteria, namely active efflux by
Tet pumps, is overcome by steric hindrance by a large substituent
group. Tigecycline has in vitro activity against most Enterobacteria-
ceae except Proteeae, i.e. Proteus spp., Providencia spp. and
M. morganii. MICs for A. baumannii (including many carbapenem-
resistant strains) and S. maltophilia are low (mostly 0.25–2 mg/L)
but there are no breakpoints or convincing efficacy studies. In com-
mon with other tetracyclines, tigecycline lacks useful activity
against P. aeruginosa. Tigecycline is vulnerable to the chromoso-
mal resistance–nodulation–cell division (RND) multidrug efflux
pumps, including MexXY–OprM of P. aeruginosa, and the AcrAB
pump found in Proteus mirabilis, which explains the intrinsic resist-
ance of these species.330,331
Whilst tigecycline-resistant isolates of Enterobacteriaceae have
been described from treatment-naive patients, another potential
problem is the development of resistance during treatment of
infections with Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp. by the
mutational up-regulation of RND pumps, but the frequency is
unclear, particularly when used in combination.332–336 Use of
tigecycline
is

 different

regimens
and in combination
with other
agents. Tigecycline has a potential to favour superinfections by
P. aeruginosa, Proteeae338 and sometimes Klebsiella spp.;337,339
again, these aspects require further investigation.
Subject to the earlier caveat about the lack of breakpoints, tige-
cycline has in vitro activity against S. maltophilia, and susceptibility
rates of .87% have been reported.340 However, there is little clini-
cal experience with the drug in treating infections caused by this
organism.
Intravenous tigecycline is licensed for the treatment of compli-
cated skin and soft tissue infections and complicated intra-
abdominal infections.341,342 However, the US FDA issued a warning
describing an increased mortality risk with its use when compared
with other drugs.343,344 The highest risk was in patients treated for
ventilator-associated pneumonia, which was not a licensed indica-
tion. However even in FDA-approved uses there was a higher risk of
death among patients given tigecycline compared with those
given other antibacterial drugs.345,346 There are no RCTs compar-
ing tigecycline with polymyxins, fosfomycin, sulbactam and
other antibiotics against infections due to MDR GNB, alone or in
combinations.347 Several meta-analyses examine the efficacy and
safety of tigecycline in general (not just against MDR GNB) and
these reported conflicting findings. One very recent analysis
reviews the earlier studies and includes a number of new trials.
Clinical success rates were lower than comparator for hospital-
acquired pneumonia and diabetic foot infection, with increased
gastrointestinal adverse events and higher all-cause mortality,
probably due to reduced efficacy.348
Further work on tigecycline is needed, as its efficacy in ventila-
tor-associated pneumonia might be improved using higher doses
(i.e. 200 mg initially and then 100 mg twice daily); an increase in
adverse events was not seen with this regimen.349 Tigecycline in
combination with other antibiotics (e.g. carbapenems and poly-
myxins) is a potentially valuable approach for infections caused by
carbapenemase-producing
Klebsiella
spp.,
as
shown
by
Tumbarello et al.350 In this retrospective cohort study, largely of
infections due to strains with KPC-3 carbapenemase, 9/19 patients
survived on tigecycline monotherapy, 0/11 on colistin monother-
apy and 16/23 with tigecycline and colistin combinations. Two
comparisons of monotherapy and combination therapy for infec-
tions with carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. give further
survival data on monotherapy: survival in one study was 71/116
for tigecycline and 70/132 for colistin316 and in the other study 16/
27 for tigecycline and 12/22 for colistin.351
Whilst the in vitro data support use of tigecycline in respiratory
infection, there is poor correlation between the laboratory results
and clinical outcome.334,352,353
Eravacycline is a novel intravenous fluorocycline with a similar
spectrum to tigecycline. It showed non-inferiority to ertapenem in
a Phase 3 trial of complicated intra-abdominal infection but failed
to show non-inferiority to levofloxacin in an intravenous/oral
switch Phase 3 trial of complicated UTI.354–356

tions due to MDR GNB.

7.16 Fosfomycin
Fosfomycin, a strongly hydrophilic phosphonic acid (unrelated to
aminoglycoside or macrolide antibiotics), inhibits the addition of
phosphoenol-pyruvate to N-acetyl-glucosamine in synthesis of
the bacterial cell wall. Fosfomycin MICs for E. coli vary from 1 to
4 mg/L: those for Klebsiella spp. are higher at 2–64mg/L. EUCAST
breakpoints for both intravenous and oral formulations are
S �32mg/L, R .32mg/L, available for E. coli only. M. morganii and
Bacteroides
spp.
are
inherently
resistant
and
activity
against P. aeruginosa is controversial, particularly in combination.
The drug is otherwise very broad in its spectrum. Fosfomycin was
active against 72% of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to carbape-
nems in a German study.357 In vitro testing with discs required the
addition of glucose-6-phosphate to the disc. In this study there
were 22% major discrepancies between agar dilution in medium
containing glucose-6-phosphate and disc or Etest testing and it is
not clear if glucose-6-phosphate was present in discs and MIC gra-
dient strips, an area for quality control development. There are
similarly no published details on the reliability of automated sus-
ceptibility testing methods.
Fosfomycin trometamol is used as an oral treatment for
patients with uncomplicated lower UTI due to fosfomycin-
susceptible organisms resistant to first-line agents. At the conven-
tional dosage of 3 g on a single occasion, this oral formulation gives
an adequate urinary concentration for 2 days (see Section 9.3). An
earlier oral product was a calcium salt, only 30%–40% of which
was absorbed: this gave peak plasma levels of 7–9 mg/L 4 h after a
3 g dose. The trometamol salt that replaced this is better absorbed
(60% bioavailable), reaching peak plasma levels of 32mg/L 2 h
after a 3 g dose).
Experience with intravenous fosfomycin disodium (not a trome-
tamol formulation) is limited in the UK, where it has only recently
been introduced, specifically for treatment of infection with multi-
resistant bacteria. It has been more widely used elsewhere in
Europe. The intravenous sodium salt reaches levels of 25mg/L

 after a 1 g dose. A very early single open comparison of 38 patients
with acute pyelonephritis showed that 7 days of intravenous fosfo-
mycin 2 g q6h achieved only a 44% response rate;358 the authors
therefore concluded the drug had no role in pyelonephritis; the
oral trometamol salt has never been examined for pyelonephritis.
Intravenous dosage with MDR GNB is now usually at 24g/day in
three divided doses but dosage reduction is needed in renal impair-
ment as the drug is exclusively renally excreted, unchanged. The
formulation has a high sodium load and the most frequently
encountered side effect is hypokalaemia (26% patients).359
Fosfomycin exhibits excellent penetration into tissue after an intra-
venous dose as it is a small (138Da) molecule with negligible pro-
tein binding; it also has a long serum half-life of 4–8 h.360
A prospective salvage study of 11 ICU patients with serious
infections
caused
by
carbapenem-resistant
K.
pneumoniae
reported an all-cause mortality of 2/11, although analysis of the
claimed successes is complicated because six patients were also
treated with colistin and three with gentamicin.361 A larger out-
come study of 48 patients (mainly with ventilator-associated
pneumonia) infected with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and to a
lesser extent VIM-producing P. aeruginosa reported clinical success
when fosfomycin was used mainly in combination with colistin or
tigecycline in 54.2% patients and 28day all-cause mortality
of 37.5%.362 Of 15 patients with colistin-, tigecycline-, aminoglyco-
side- and carbapenem-resistant KPC-producing Klebsiella infection
(one with an additional carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa), 9
responded to fosfomycin combinations and in 8 microbiological
eradiation was achieved.
The use of intravenous fosfomycin has been reviewed exten-
sively. Clinical cure was described in 1242/1529 patients (81.2%)
overall (for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens).363
Most of the Gram-negative infections in this series were due to
P. aeruginosa (which most would regard as resistant), but also
included infections due to Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., E. coli,
Proteus spp. and Salmonella typhi. Most patients also received con-
comitant antibiotics, so again interpretation is difficult. A wide vari-
ety of infections was treated and fosfomycin was well tolerated.
Despite in vitro resistance to fosfomycin, most patients with infec-
tions caused by P. aeruginosa improved, although this may reflect
concomitant antibiotics.
Further detailed studies of the parenteral form used alone in
single indications (such as UTI and ventilator-associated pneumo-
nia) are required to establish its relative efficacy and usefulness for
specific MDR GNB. Similarly, in combination therapy comparisons
of specific combinations are required.
Evidence
Further details and regimens for the oral formulation are given in
Section 9.3.
The parenteral formulation may be a valuable treatment alter-
native for infections due to MDR GNB including carbapenemase-
and MBL-producing strains. However, further detailed comparative
trial experience is necessary to determine its optimal use.

7.17 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (available as intravenous and
oral formulations) has in vitro activity against S. maltophilia340 and
some less-frequently encountered non-fermenting Gram-nega-
tive bacilli (e.g. Achromobacter spp., Alcaligenes spp., Burkholderia
spp., Chryseobacterium spp. and Elizabethkingia spp.).364 These
species have inherent resistance to most other antibiotics and
often produce MBLs. Stenotrophomonas spp. typically have similar
percentage susceptibility at the CLSI breakpoint to sulphonamides
alone and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole but are resistant to tri-
methoprim alone. The combination has greater in vitro potency
than either trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole. A similar comment
applies to Achromobacter spp. and with few exceptions to
Alcaligenes spp., Chryseobacterium spp. and Elizabethkingia spp.364
These genera are susceptible to trimethoprim and more strains of
these genera and Burkholderia spp. are susceptible to trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole than either component alone.364 The clini-
cal use of sulphonamides alone against non-fermenters has not
been explored and the combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethox-
azole is usually used in S. maltophilia infections and, for simplicity,
against those due to these other unusual species. Problems occur
with disc susceptibility testing of S. maltophilia and there are few
data on the performance of automated susceptibility systems.
Trailing endpoints are frequent and results vary with the tempera-
ture of incubation and the susceptibility testing medium used.
Occasional resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is not
well understood in these non-fermenters but resistance to trime-
thoprim/sulfamethoxazole caused via the sulI gene has been
described repeatedly in S. maltophilia.365 A recent systematic
review suggested that some strains of Acinetobacter spp. are sus-
ceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and that use against
this genus can be guided by in vitro testing.366 However, over half
the UK strains of A. baumannii show high-level resistance.364
Evidence
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has wide in vitro activity against
S. maltophilia, Achromobacter spp., Alcaligenes spp., Burkholderia
spp., Chryseobacterium spp. and Elizabethkingia spp. Susceptibility
testing methods for these organisms are not well established but
some S. maltophilia have resistance to trimethoprim and sulfame-
thoxazole. Carbapenem resistance is inherent to most of these
species.

7.18 Intravenous combination therapy for infections
due to carbapenemase producers
Although results of RCTs will become available, most of the current
evidence
for
the
advantage
of
combination
therapy
for
carbapenem-resistant infections derives from observational studies
and reports mainly focus on severely ill patients or those where the
pathogen has reduced susceptibility to colistin.367 An international
working group report recommended combinations including a car-
bapenem as optimal treatment but only in settings where NDM car-
bapenemases are infrequent.368 However, retrospective studies are
liable to bias in that investigators have no control over antibiotic use.
Different studies and reviews of combination therapy have
reached contradictory conclusions. One systematic review identi-
fied that evidence for combination treatment was poor quality
and inherently biased, being based on small observational studies
with heterogeneity of: (i) antibiotic choice and activity against
responsible pathogens; (ii) antibiotic dosage; and (iii) severity of ill-
ness.369 These authors concluded that any benefit in outcome
between monotherapy with colistin and combination of colistin
with other agents (aminoglycoside, tigecycline, carbapenem or
rifampicin) was uncertain. There were methodological problems in
the studies reviewed. Another systematic review370 which lacked
quality assessments likewise found only observational studies
with marked heterogeneity, and suggested no proven benefit in
terms of mortality between combination treatment and mono-
therapy except for three more homogeneous studies exclusively of
bacteraemias due to KPC-producing Klebsiella spp. in critically ill
patients, which are worth detailed consideration.350,371,372
Firstly, Tumbarello et al.350 in a three-centre retrospective
cohort study found 16/23 patients survived with tigecycline and
colistin combinations and 12/14 with colistin/tigecycline/carbape-
nem combinations compared with 11/22 with colistin monother-
apy and 10/19 with tigecycline monotherapy. Secondly, Qureshi
et al.371 in a two-centre retrospective cohort study showed that
3/7 receiving polymyxin monotherapy, 1/5 receiving tigecycline
monotherapy, 2/4 receiving carbapenem monotherapy and 2/3
other antibiotics as monotherapy survived 28days compared with
5/6 receiving colistin combinations and 6/6 receiving tigecycline
combinations. Thirdly, Zarkotou et al.372 noted 3/7 survivals with
colistin, 3/5 with tigecycline and 0/1 on carbapenem, all as mono-
therapy, compared with 9/9 receiving combined tigecycline and
colistin, 3/3 receiving tigecycline and carbapenems and 8/8 among
those treated with other combinations. Two studies of bacterae-
mias involving VIM-1 producers considered in this review produced
even less interpretable results. A third systematic review of poly-
myxin treatment found mortality at 30days was lower in patients
given combination treatment.373 A 2017 systematic review and
meta-analysis favours combination use of polymyxins.374
Given this background, conclusions from further individual non-
RCT studies must be interpreted with caution, but some support
combination treatment. A larger retrospective cohort study of 661
infections caused by KPC carbapenemase-producing strains of K.
pneumoniae reported improved survival in patients treated with
two or more active drugs versus those given monotherapy.316
Mortality at 14days in bacteraemias with an unknown or non-
urinary source was 52.8% with monotherapy and 34.1% with
combination treatment. A similar result with 49.1% and 24.8%
mortality respectively was seen with lower respiratory tract infec-
tion. There was no significant difference in bacteraemias from a
known urinary source. Overall death rates on monotherapy were
62/132 (47%) with colistin, 45/116 (39%) with tigecycline and
28/70 (40%) with gentamicin. With two-drug therapy mortality
was 38/134 (28%) and with three-drug therapy it was 67/217
(31%). Only the use of meropenem in a combination produced a
statistically significant improvement to 54/205 (26%). Use of mer-
openem was associated with lower mortality only if the MIC was
�8 mg/L, as was the case for 37% of the isolates. Colistin resist-
ance was significantly associated with increased mortality.
Overall, combinations including tigecycline, colistin and merope-
nem were associated with the lowest mortality (12.5%, OR 0.11,
95% CI 0.02–0.69). Epidemiologically, overall colistin, tigecycline
and gentamicin resistance rates were 11%, 9% and 6% in 2010
but by 2014 were 21%, 27% and 25%.
A further review including some previously reviewed studies
suggested superiority of combination therapy over monotherapy,
with mortality rates of 27.4% versus 38.7% respectively. Again,
carbapenem-containing regimens had the lowest mortality
(18.8%) and this was associated with isolates that were not resist-
ant by the EUCAST breakpoint.375 Similar findings were reported in
a retrospective observational study of 205 bacteraemias caused
by carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae.351 Combination
therapy was associated with a lower mortality rate of 27% com-
pared with 44% for monotherapy, 11/27 with tigecycline, 10/22
with colistin and 7/12 with carbapenems. The difference in mortal-
ity was most marked in the more severe cases. Furthermore, mor-
tality with a carbapenem-containing combination was 19.3%
(6/31) compared with 30.6% (22/72) without a carbapenem (5/16
in those treated with tigecycline and colistin alone). Mortality on
carbapenem-containing regimens in this study was lower only if
the carbapenem MIC was �8 mg/L. The authors comment that
40% of isolates with MICs by Etest �8 mg/L were found resistant
by automated testing. These studies suggest: (i) that KPC-
carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. commonly appear mer-
openem susceptible in vitro; and (ii) that treatment combinations
containing conventionally dosed carbapenems are advisable in
such cases with lower MICs.
Much higher doses of meropenem by continuous infusion can
also be used (see Section 7.1). This extends the MIC range of strains
that can be treated. Continuous infusion therapy of meropenem
with doses up to 13.2 g daily with levels optimized by therapeutic
drug monitoring when used in combinations (mainly with colistin
and tigecycline) were associated with 73% clinical cures in patients
with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae with MIC 16 to ,64mg/L.376
These are better outcomes in treatment of more-resistant KPC-
producing Klebsiella than apparent in earlier studies of these
more-resistant KPC-producing Klebsiella. Direct comparisons have
not been made including comparison with high-dose continuous
infusion meropenem alone. The application of this approach to
other carbapenem-resistant isolates with MICs within the attain-
able range has not been assessed.
Anecdotal reports suggest double carbapenem combinations
of ertapenem plus either meropenem or doripenem can be effec-
tive as last-resort treatment for infections due to K. pneumoniae
producing KPC carbapenemase but not those with NDM enzymes.
Hawkey et al.
iii42

 This is perhaps because ertapenem binds tightly to the KPC
enzyme, acting as an inhibitory substrate and thereby protecting
the meropenem or doripenem.377,378
In cases where the Klebsiella spp. strain was resistant to colistin
and carbapenems, the use of gentamicin in combination with vari-
ous agents was independently associated with reduced mortality
in a retrospective cohort study.379 However, this was in the
epidemiological context of a clonal K. pneumoniae ST512 (CC258)
lineage with a KPC enzyme. This lineage commonly has the
AAC(60)-Ib enzyme, which confers resistance to amikacin but
largely spares gentamicin; it is unlikely to be true for isolates with
NDM carbapenemases, which mostly have ArmA or Rmt ribosomal
methyltransferases, conferring high-level resistance to all stand-
ard
aminoglycosides,
including
gentamicin
and
plazomicin.
Plazomicin might have a future role with non-NDM-producing,
gentamicin-resistant strains.
Evidence for efficacy of tigecycline in combination largely derives
from observational studies but microbiological cure rates with mono-
therapy are lower than clinical cure rates and mortality rates are
high. Pooled results from five observational studies suggested a clini-
cal response rate of 77% (567/733) for all patients and 81%
(329/408) for tigecycline monotherapy in the treatment of compli-
cated intra-abdominal infection.380 Another review of five observa-
tional studies of uncomplicated soft tissue and intra-abdominal
infection
with
tigecycline
similarly
found
monotherapy
was
effective.381 These studies contain no data on response by resistan-
ces present and studies were with the licensed dose of 50mg twice
daily.
In an open-label RCT of treatment of ventilator-associated or
hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by MDR Acinetobacter spp.,
addition of rifampicin to colistin did not affect 30day mortality or
length of hospital stay, but was associated with a higher rate of
microbiological eradication.382 A retrospective observational study
of 251 bloodstream infections treated with colistin, colistin/sulbac-
tam, colistin/carbapenem or another colistin combination reached
the similar conclusion that mortality was not affected but micro-
biological eradication was higher with combination treatment.383
Another
observational
study
of
101
patients
with
MDR
Acinetobacter infections did not show any improvement in mortal-
ity rates for combination therapy (e.g. colistin plus tigecycline or
carbapenem plus tigecycline) over a single agent (usually colistin)
but the group size in this study was small.384
In the case of MDR Pseudomonas infections a prospective
cohort study showed no outcome advantage in combination ver-
sus monotherapy.385 Combination therapy with aminoglycosides
did not reduce the development of resistance.386 Fosfomycin in
combination with tigecycline or colistin was effective in 54% of
48 patients with infections with MDR GNB, some of whom had
Pseudomonas infection.362
The recent introduction of ceftazidime/avibactam and the pos-
sibilities of using this in treatment may change the need to use
combination treatment for some KPC- or ceftazidime-resistant
OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing strains.
Evidence
Two of four systematic reviews do not show a benefit of combina-
tion therapy over monotherapy.
Evidence level: 2!!
In infections with KPC-carbapenemase producing Klebsiella spp.,
combination therapy including meropenem is associated with lower
mortality than colistin monotherapy if the meropenem MIC is
,8mg/L but this was not the case with strains with higher MICs
unless continuous infusion therapy with higher than licensed doses
was used (see Section 7.1). Combinations with other agents such as
tigecycline or an aminoglycoside to which carbapenemase-
producing strains are susceptible also seem advantageous, but only
the expected results of a new RCT will resolve this.
Evidence level: 3
Paul et al.369 detail the hazards of bias in favour of combination
therapy that arise without an RCT. Data from a subset with bacter-
aemia with Klebsiella spp. producing KPC carbapenemases in the
second systematic review performed by Falagas et al.370 suggest
that in treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
infection, colistin used in combination with other agents is associ-
ated with a lower mortality than colistin alone, and this is also a
finding in the review of Ni et al.373
Evidence level: 1!
The evidence that tigecycline combinations, including other
antibiotics active against Enterobacteriaceae, are more effective
than tigecycline alone in intra-abdominal infections is poor.

Ertapenem in combination with meropenem may be effective
as salvage therapy for infections with KPC carbapenemase pro-
ducers but the evidence is very weak.

care treatment
8.1 Mecillinam and pivmecillinam
Pivmecillinam (the oral form of mecillinam) can be considered
alone as oral therapy for lower UTI caused by AmpC-producing
Enterobacteriaceae. The antibiotic is not active against carbapene-
mase producers. It has been suggested to be active against ESBL-
producing E. coli. Patients with infections with such strains referred
from the community for intravenous treatment with carbapenems

 might be considered for oral follow-on therapy with pivmecillinam
alone for UTI because of mecillinam’s apparent activity in vitro.
However, additional measures are desirable and this oral treat-
ment is dealt with under community use (see Section 9.4 for more
detail). Patients should be carefully monitored both clinically and
microbiologically if pivmecillinam is prescribed alone in hospital for
infections involving ESBL producers as treatment failure is a risk.
8.2 Cefixime and oral cephalosporins
Cefixime is an oral third-generation cephalosporin that has been
used as an oral switch for patients with pyelonephritis. Among uro-
pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae, it is not active alone against ESBL-
producing E. coli because of their multiple resistances, including qui-
nolones,387 but is useful if ESBL-producing organisms or CPE are not
present. Cefixime could be used in combination with co-amoxiclav
against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, as supported by in vitro
data.388 Data from transconjugant E. coli further suggest that cefix-
ime plus clavulanate is effective against strains producing CTX-M-15
enzyme, which have higher cefixime MICs than strains producing
CTX-M-9 enzyme.389 Other oral cephalosporins, including cefdinir,
ceftibuten and cefpodoxime, also showed synergy with clavulanate,
whereas sulbactam was less effective as a potentiator. Cefixime,
with or without clavulanate, was not active against AmpC-
producing organisms nor would it be expected to be active against
CPE. Consequently cefixime/co-amoxiclav combinations should not
be used against cephalosporin-resistant organisms without tests to
distinguish AmpC and ESBL production. No clinical trials of cefixime
together with clavulanate or amoxicillin/clavulanate against ESBL-
producing E. coli have been published. Cefixime is detectable in fae-
ces after administration. Other cephalosporins, e.g. cefalexin, which
are fully absorbed, are not detectable in faeces and less frequently
provoke C. difficile, may be better partners for clavulanate, although
in vitro data to support this combination are lacking.105 Synergy
in vitro between cephalosporins and mecillinam because of their dif-
ferent target penicillin-binding proteins is likely, and synergy of cefa-
lexin with fosfomycin (earlier known as alafosfalin or fosfonomycin),
another cell-wall active antibiotic, is also recorded.390
Evidence
Cefixime with clavulanate, which is not available commercially,
has reliable in vitro activity against ESBL-producing E. coli and
Klebsiella spp. (not Enterobacter spp., where AmpC will cause
resistance). Cefixime is not useful alone against MDR GNB and no
clinical studies with oral cephalosporins and clavulanate or amoxi-
cillin/clavulanate have been published.
Evidence level: 3
Recommendations
• Do not use cefixime or other oral cephalosporins alone for
treating infections caused by ESBL-, AmpC- or carbapenemase-
producing Enterobacteriaceae.
Grading: Conditional recommendation against use
• Oral cephalosporins need clinical trials with clavulanate (alone
or with amoxicillin) against ESBL-producing E. coli UTI.

8.3 What are the recommended antibiotics for
community care, including care homes?
Most MDR GNB infections encountered in the community involve
the urinary tract. As described earlier, ESBL-producing isolates of
Enterobacteriaceae are a significant and growing problem,
whereas there are few community infections in the UK involving
CPE. There are no published RCTs of antibiotic treatment of UTIs
due to ESBL-producing organisms in the community or care
homes. Recommendations must rely on observational studies of
ESBL-producing GNB, or RCTs of effectiveness of antibiotics against
UTIs caused by GNB lacking ESBLs.
8.4 What are the risk factors for patients with urinary
tract infections caused by MDR GNB in the UK?
In order to help the assessment of patients we reviewed risk factors
for MDR GNB and suitable oral agents for acute uncomplicated and
complicated UTIs. Prospective and retrospective epidemiological
studies identified several risk factors for carriage of ESBL-producing
E. coli.99,136,184,391–393,394,395 Patients are at increased risk if
they have:
• Recurrent UTI
• Persistent urinary symptoms after an initial antibiotic
• Over 7 days hospital admission in the last 6 months
• Residence in a care home
• Recent travel and especially healthcare in a country with
increased antimicrobial resistance.
• Previously known UTI (within 1 year) caused by bacteria resist-
ant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins or quinolone or
recent treatment with these agents.396
There are no UK data validating an Italian scoring system
devised and tested in 2009 for carriage of ESBL-producing bacteria
on admission to hospital or incorporating information on travel,
overseas healthcare in the previous 2 years or migration. The
Italian scoring system identifies risk based on hospitalization
within the previous 12months (OR 5.69, 95% CI 2.94–10.99),
transfer from another healthcare facility (OR 5.61, 95% CI
1.65–19.08), Charlson comorbidity score .4 (OR 3.80, 95% CI
1.90–7.59), b-lactam or fluoroquinolone prescription within the
previous 3 months (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.96–6.91), recent urinary
catheterization (OR 3.52, 95% CI 1.96–6.91) and age .70years
(OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.79–5.70).99 This model of risk factors has been
re-assessed in the USA to see if it can be used to realistically restrict
the need for carbapenem treatment to an identifiable high-risk
subgroup.397 In the US evaluation, risk factors for community-
onset clinical infection involving MDR GNB diagnosed within 48h of
admission were: hospitalization (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.323–5.41),
inter-hospital transfer (OR 5.30, 95% CI 2.67–10.71), urinary cathe-
terization (OR 6.89, 95% CI 3.62–13.38), b-lactam or quinolone
prescription (OR 3.47, 95% CI 1.91–6.41) and additionally immuno-
suppression in the preceding 3 months (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.14–4.8).
Age over 70 was not a risk factor but age was not examined as a
continuous variable. In this model, the sensitivity and specificity
were �94% and �65% for scores of �3 and �58% and �95% for
scores of 8 or above. Urinary catheterization was also a risk factor

 in a Spanish study.398 A further paired US retrospective case–
control study compared infections with CTX-M ESBL-producing
E. coli infections with E. coli lacking CTX-M enzymes with uninfected
controls; carbapenemase producers were excluded. Patients with
infections with CTX-M producers were more likely to be male, have
dementia or dependency, have higher median Charlson scores,
receive H2 antagonists and have exposure to healthcare set-
tings.393 Recent antibiotics did not differ between the two groups,
except that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole use was commoner
in the non CTX-M-producing group. Exposure to immunosuppres-
sives was also commoner in the CTX-M group. A similar 75%–77%
of strains were present within 48h of admission. When patients
with strains producing CTX-M-ESBLs were compared with controls,
the former had a higher incidence of comorbidity (Charlson score
�5), and were more often resident in nursing homes with greater
exposure to healthcare and more indwelling urinary catheters.
They were more likely to be receiving H2 antagonists or proton
pump inhibitors and to have exposure to oxyimino cephalosporins
within the last 3 months.
Evidence
Quoted rates of resistance in the community are biased to an
unknown extent by infection occurring shortly after hospital dis-
charge, care home cross-infection, an excess of treatment failures
represented in the samples tested and an unknown proportion of
patients with risk factors and recent antibiotic use.

9. Which oral antibiotics are preferred for use
in treating uncomplicated UTIs due to MDR
GNB in the community?
9.1 Trimethoprim
Owing to increasing resistance, trimethoprim is no longer the sug-
gested first-line empirical therapy for post-menopausal women
and older men in PHE guidance and nitrofurantoin is advised
instead. In Wales trimethoprim remained until 2016 the sug-
gested first-line empirical therapy for uncomplicated UTI in the
community except for the elderly and for patients who have
received antibiotics in the preceding 3 months.
Following advice to decrease trimethoprim use, an 86% reduc-
tion in trimethoprim use was seen in a Swedish region (hospitals
and community) from 2004 to 2006 with a compensatory increase
in nitrofurantoin, pivmecillinam and ciprofloxacin use. This pro-
gramme resulted in no overall change in trimethoprim resistance.
Before the intervention, trimethoprim resistance was more preva-
lent in E. coli phylogroups A, B1 and D than in phylogroup B2 strains,
although rates were high in ST131, which belongs to phylogroup
B2.There was a marked change after the intervention in the distri-
bution
of
resistance
between
phylogroups
and
associated
sequence types, with an increase in the trimethoprim resistance in
phylogroup B2 (including ST131) and a decrease in trimethoprim
resistance in phylogroup A and B1 strains (which seldom cause
extraintestinal infection) and to a lesser extent in phylogroup D.
Trimethoprim resistance was associated with a change in preva-
lence of dfrA1. Resistance to other antibiotics, including those sub-
stituted for trimethoprim increased in phylogroup A and B1
strains.118 Amongst 273 urine isolates of E. coli collected in 2006
versus the same number collected in 2004, strains of ST69 (which
includes the former clonal group A), ST12 and unusual strains
became more prevalent, increasing respectively from 4.8% to
8.1%, from 2.6% to 4.8% and from 42% to 51%. By contrast strains
of ST131, ST127, and ST80 declined in prevalence from 4.8% to
2.2%, 8.1% to 3.7% and 5.1% to 1.1%. There were statistically sig-
nificant increases in trimethoprim resistance rates in the strains of
ST131 and ST127. This would suggest that in types ST131 and
ST127 susceptible strains were eliminated by the antibiotics substi-
tuted for trimethoprim (quinolones, pivmecillinam and nitrofuran-
toin) but because of resistance linkage trimethoprim resistance
increased in these sequence types. Information is lacking on ST80.
The increase in strains ST69 and ST12 suggests they may have
been selected by the antibiotics substituted for trimethoprim, but it
is not clear which antibiotics would have this effect as these STs are
usually only resistant to ampicillin and, in the case of ST69, trime-
thoprim. In a structured survey of extraintestinal strains from US
veterans in 2011, quinolone-resistant ST131 accounted for 78% of
quinolone-resistant strains, which constituted 29% of reported
strains overall. It accounted for 56% of trimethoprim-resistant
strains
and 52%
of
quinolone-
and
trimethoprim-resistant
strains.399 This suggests that quinolones have the potential to
select against trimethoprim-susceptible ST131 strains, decreasing
in the Swedish intervention study the overall prevalence at that
time but potentially selecting for later increased prevalence of the
ST131. Thus, because of resistance linkage, community-wide
change in use of a single antibiotic may unpredictably change the
epidemiology and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in more

 pathogenic phylogroups. It cannot be assumed that risk factors for
multiresistance or the likelihood of success with an antibiotic in
reinfection or recurrent infection will stay the same after abandon-
ment of trimethoprim as a first-line agent. This aspect of change
needs urgent study.
Trimethoprim-resistant strains are much more frequently
resistant to amoxicillin than trimethoprim-susceptible strains and
this is a feature of ST69. Trimethoprim resistance rates in ESBL-
producing E. coli in 2010 in the West Midlands were between 86%
and 92% depending on whether the strain was not, or was,
ST131. Ciprofloxacin resistance is also usual in these strains.93
Trimethoprim consequently is a poor choice for patients with treat-
ment failures on amoxicillin with, or without, clavulanate, cephalo-
sporins or quinolones who require an urgent prescription before
samples can be tested for antibiotic susceptibilities.
More generally, trimethoprim should not be used as empirical
treatment for UTI if there are risk factors for an antibiotic-resistant
bacterium unless: (i) susceptibility has been confirmed in the pre-
vious month; (ii) there are no new risk factors for resistance; and
(iii) there have been no treatment failures with trimethoprim. In
the absence of resistance, trimethoprim attains excellent bacterio-
logical cure: 2 weeks after completion of treatment 94% of women
using a 3 day course achieved bacteriological cure compared with
97% of those using a 10day course (n " 135).400
Evidence
Trimethoprim use has not been explored as a risk factor for MDR
GNB infection but resistance is common generally and very com-
mon in ESBL-producing bacteria. Trimethoprim is no longer recom-
mended as a first-line antibiotic choice for post-menopausal
women and older men with UTI and has little place in treatment of
infection due to MDR GNB.
Evidence level: 3
3 day courses are almost as effective as longer courses in bac-
teriological cure of susceptible infections.
Evidence level: 1!
Recommendations
• Do not use trimethoprim in treating MDR GNB or treatment fail-
ures with other agents unless in vitro susceptibility has been
demonstrated.
Grading: Strong recommendation against use
• Do not use trimethoprim to treat lower UTIs as a first-line agent
if �50 years old. Only consider use if there are no risk factors for
resistance, or if in vitro susceptibility is confirmed.
Grading: Conditional recommendation against use
9.2 Nitrofurantoin
Nitrofurantoin is widely used for acute uncomplicated UTI in the
community, and is now the recommended first-line treatment in
England. It attains only low concentrations in renal tissue and the
bloodstream and should not be used if pyelonephritis or bacterae-
mia is suspected; treatment may fail if used for ascending infec-
tion.401 Nitrofurantoin resistance is inherent in Proteus spp.,
M. morganii, Providencia spp. and Serratia spp. and the drug may not
be effective in the alkaline urine produced by urease-producing bac-
teria such as these and possibly Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
which is apparently susceptible in vitro but also produces large
amounts of urease. Nitrofurantoin resistance is very common in
CPE.120
In early studies nitrofurantoin had a minimal effect on rectal
flora and a recent metagenomics study supports this.402,403
Resistant strains of E. coli and increased numbers of Proteeae may
be detected in the faecal flora404,405 but UTIs breaking through
prophylaxis in recurrent infection are usually due to strains that
remain susceptible, unlike the situation with trimethoprim.404,405
Recurrent UTIs after nitrofurantoin treatment of ESBL-producing
E. coli may reflect relapse or recurrent infection arising from persis-
tent carriage in the gastrointestinal flora; these possibilities cannot
easily be distinguished. Frequent recurrence of UTI due to ESBL
strains may justify using an alternative antibiotic regimen such as
fosfomycin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate with pivmecillinam, with a
greater theoretical chance of changing the gastrointestinal flora,
which may act as the source for reinfection.
If a patient has a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), uri-
nary concentrations of nitrofurantoin may be too low to be effec-
tive. Estimated GFR (eGFR) frequently declines with age, on
average by between 6 and 9 mL/min/1.73m2 per decade. Around
half of women over 75years and men over 85years have an eGFR
under 60mL/min/1.73m2, which used to be the lower limit for use
of nitrofurantoin.401 In a cohort study of lower UTI in 21317
women treated with nitrofurantoin and 7926 treated with trime-
thoprim, there was no greater risk of nitrofurantoin treatment fail-
ure in patients with creatinine clearance of 30–50mL/min;
however, the risk of pulmonary adverse events was significantly
increased with creatinine clearance ,50mL/min (HR 4.1, 95% CI
0.31–13.09).406 In 2014, and in the context of increasing antibiotic
resistance to trimethoprim in the UK, the Medicine and Healthcare
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reviewed the evidence for use of
nitrofurantoin in reduced renal function.407 They concluded on
evidence401,406 that the eGFR below which nitrofurantoin should
not be used could be lowered to 45mL/min/1.73m2. The MHRA
further stated that a short course (3–7 days) may be used with
caution in patients with an eGFR of 30–44mL/min/1.73m2, but
only advocates prescribing in such patients for lower UTIs with sus-
pected or proven MDR pathogens when the benefits of nitrofuran-
toin are considered to outweigh the risks of side effects. Long-term
or repeated courses of nitrofurantoin are associated with severe
pulmonary fibrosis.408 Nevertheless, 219 courses of prophylaxis for
1 year for recurrent UTI in normal patients were not associated
with a single case, so this unwanted effect may be rare under
controlled
conditions
where
the
drug
is
very
effective.405
Nitrofurantoin is poorly tolerated by some patients, but the modi-
fied-release form has fewer side effects.409 When used in this for-
mulation, an open RCT over 20years ago (n " 538) found that
nitrofurantoin had equivalent clinical cure rates to trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (both given for 7 days) in a
group of patients with acute uncomplicated lower UTI.409 The rate
of gastrointestinal adverse effects was similar between groups
(7%–8%). At this time the rate of nitrofurantoin resistance across
all pathogens isolated was 3.9% whereas the rate of trimethoprim
resistance was 12.5%. Trimethoprim but not nitrofurantoin resist-
ance is now far commoner.
A recent review and meta-analysis suggested nitrofurantoin
had a similar clinical cure rate to comparators but with a 5 rather
than 3 day course for nitrofurantoin apparently producing better

 cure rates.410 However 5 and 3 day courses have not been directly
compared in adequate numbers and the PHE has not recom-
mended 5 day courses. We consider in MDR GNB UTI that course
lengths should be those that produce the best rates of bacteriolog-
ical cure. There is no convincing evidence that shorter courses are
equivalent to longer courses specifically in MDR GNB infections nor
that the risk of serious unwanted effects is increased with longer
courses. Whether such longer courses should be used more gener-
ally for nitrofurantoin is therefore unresolved. Unwanted effects in
the systematic review were mainly gastrointestinal and no pulmo-
nary events were reported, although this may reflect short follow-
up periods.410 There are no specific studies of nitrofurantoin in UTI
caused by ESBL-producing organisms, but UTIs that are suscepti-
ble to nitrofurantoin have a similar response rate irrespective of
ESBL production. However, ESBL-producing members of the E. coli
ST131 clone, which are common in the UK and elsewhere, often
have urinary virulence factors that are associated with recurrence,
infection of the upper urinary tract and bacteraemia,411 and when
infection reaches the upper tract nitrofurantoin is ineffective.
Nitrofurantoin resistance has appeared in this sequence type (see
Section 6.3.4). Further comparative studies in UTIs due to ESBL-
producing E. coli are needed.
Evidence
Nitrofurantoinis effective inlower, uncomplicatedUTI and resistance
rates remain low in E. coli, although new plasmid-mediated mecha-
nisms of resistance are now described. Mechanisms of acquired
resistance in the UK, including in travellers, have not been studied
recently. Resistance is intrinsic in Proteus spp. and Serratia spp.
Evidence level: 1!
There is usually no change in faecal Enterobacteriaceae during
or immediately after use. Breakthrough infection, when the
drug is used prophylactically, remains susceptible, unlike with
trimethoprim.

Nitrofurantoin’s activity is reduced in alkaline urine.

Use of nitrofurantoin in moderate renal impairment, as seen
with increasing age, has been controversial, but unrestricted use

9.3 Fosfomycin trometamol
Fosfomycin has not been widely used in the UK, where the oral
form was available between February 1994 and 1996; it was there-
after withdrawn and not marketed for nearly two decades until
2013. Its use elsewhere in Europe has been associated with clinical
success in lower UTIs. Fosfomycin suppresses Enterobacteriaceae
in the faecal flora of 60% of patients by day 3 after a single dose
but this rapidly drops to 30% at days 10–14: in contrast, nitrofuran-
toin does not suppress these organisms.403
Oral fosfomycin should be administered while fasting or 2 or 3 h
before meals, as food can slow its absorption, leading to lower con-
centrations in the urine.412 Oral fosfomycin is licensed solely for
the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. A single oral dose of 3 g
results in a plasma Cmax of 22–32mg/L and a urine maximum con-
centration (Umax) of 1053–445 mg/L.413 The urinary concentration
remains inhibitory for E. coli for at least 48h. In elderly patients
with a mean GFR of 40mL/min, concentrations after 24h
exceeded those reported for healthy young subjects but there was
considerable variation in excretion rates.414
Treatment with a 3 g single dose of fosfomycin trometamol
was associated with clinical success rates (defined as the resolu-
tion of symptoms after treatment) between 77.8% and 94.2% in
four observational studies (some complicated and some receiving
more than one dose) of treatment of lower UTI due to multiresist-
ant bacteria.415 Oral fosfomycin trometamol has been used suc-
cessfully for prophylaxis of pyelonephritis in patients with ASB in
pregnancy, and there are reports of its use, sometimes in combina-
tion, in chronic prostatitis. The use and kinetics of fosfomycin have
recently been extensively reviewed following its re-introduction to
Canada.413
Evidence
Fosfomycin is effective and well tolerated in treatment of UTI but
the oral drug has only been studied in lower UTI.
Evidence level: 2!!
Plasmid and chromosomally mediated resistance has emerged
in populations where fosfomycin is widely used.

9.4 Mecillinam and pivmecillinam
Pivmecillinam is an oral inactive ester and prodrug that is con-
verted to microbiologically active mecillinam after intestinal
absorption.
Mecillinam
has
in
vitro
activity
against
most
Enterobacteriaceae (including those with copious AmpC and some
with ESBLs), but innate resistance occurs in Proteus spp.,
M. morganii, Providencia spp., some Serratia spp. and most non-
fermenters, including Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa.
Mecillinam has no activity against enterococci or S. saprophyticus.
Some TEM and SHV ESBLs confer clear resistance389,416 and an
inoculum effect on testing is common for other ESBL producers.417
In one study of ESBL-producing E. coli the MIC50 by agar dilution
was 1 mg/L with an inoculum of 104 cfu/spot but the MIC90 was
4 mg/L.418 Experiments with E. coli transconjugants showed that
mecillinam MICs rose to 8 mg/L when CTX-M-15 or -3 was present
but only to 0.25–0.5 mg/L with CTX-M-9 or -14. Combination with
clavulanate reduced all mecillinam MICs for ESBL producers
(except SHV-4) to �4 mg/L at high inocula and �2 mg/L with the
usual light inocula.389 In another study of combination with clavu-
lanate,418 47/48 ESBL producers were susceptible to mecillinam.
Most of these produced CTX-M-3 (found in Northern Ireland) not
the commoner CTX-M-15 enzymes usual in England, Wales and
Scotland. There was no difference between the MICs for transcon-
jugants producing CTX-M-3 and -15 in the earlier study. Synergy
with clavulanate was detected in 40%–60.4% of ESBL-producing
isolates depending on the method of assessment. When a high
inoculum was used, there was a marked inoculum effect, raising
the MIC of mecillinam alone but not that of mecillinam plus clavu-
lanate. This study needs to be repeated with E. coli ST131 strains
producing CTX-M-15 enzyme and also often OXA-1, which is not
inhibited by clavulanate but said to have little activity against
mecillinam
Mutants resistant to mecillinam by non-ESBL mechanisms can
readily be obtained by laboratory selection. These show mutations
in many different cellular functions.68 However, a recent study of
mecillinam-resistant clinical isolates found them all to have muta-
tions leading to inactivation of the cysB gene. Reduced cysteine
biosynthesis results in accumulation of the transcriptional regula-
tor guanosine 30-diphosphate 50-diphosphate (ppGpp) so that the
mecillinam-targeted PBP2 becomes non-essential.419 Addition of
cysteine to the growth medium in vitro reversed the resistance to
mecillinam for such mutants, raising possible issues with regard to
current in vitro testing media.
Mecillinam is inactive against Enterobacteriaceae with KPC
enzymes but some published data suggest in vitro activity against
isolates with OXA-48-like enzymes68,389 and even some with
NDM-1 enzymes, as reflected in an MIC50 of 4 mg/L for NDM
carbapenemase-producing E. coli,420 although this low value is dis-
puted by others (D. M. Livermore, unpublished data).
Pivmecillinam at 200 mg three times daily only produces sus-
tained inhibition in Monte Carlo simulations if the mecillinam MIC is
�0.25mg/L, suggesting a higher dose or lower EUCAST breakpoint
may be required to produce and predict clinical response,
respectively.421
Pivmecillinam is used mainly for lower UTI, where it has similar
short-term symptomatic efficacy to amoxicillin and trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole if organisms are susceptible422,423 and also to
norfloxacin in 3 or 7 day regimens.424 Seven day pivmecillinam
regimens are associated with more frequent clinical success than
3 day regimens.425 Pivmecillinam prophylaxis in children with vesi-
coureteric reflux markedly reduced faecal E. coli and urinary break-
through with E. coli; unlike nitrofurantoin, breakthrough infection
with enterococci was common, reflecting different in vitro resist-
ance.426 Urinary concentrations are very high.427
Clinical
trials
of
pivmecillinam
against
ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriaceae are limited to case series. In one small trial piv-
mecillinam was used alone with 30/39 patients receiving 400 mg
three times daily and 9/39 receiving 200 mg three times daily.
Dosage did not clearly affect the cure rates regardless of whether
the UTI was complicated. Twenty-eight patients were noted to
have calculi, prostatic hypertrophy or urinary catheters (i.e. compli-
cated UTI) and six of these were bacteriological failures. Two
other bacteriological failures were seen among the remaining
11 patients. Bacteriological cure was attained in 31/39 (79% over-
all), but five relapsed; clinical cure was attained in 16/19 patients
but the rest were lost to follow-up.428 There is no theoretical, trial
or practice evidence to support a regimen with a loading dose of
400 mg followed by 200 mg three times daily, which has been rec-
ommended in the UK as a compromise.429 A population-based
Norwegian study of pivmecillinam treatment of community-
acquired UTIs examined the impact of MICs and ESBL production
in E. coli; it is not clear whether this was restricted to uncompli-
cated lower UTIs, for which, alone, pivmecillinam is licensed.430
A total of 343 patients were included, of whom 158 (46%) were
treated with pivmecillinam. Eighty-one patients had infections
caused by ESBL-producing E. coli, and 41 (51%) received pivmecilli-
nam as the primary treatment, usually at a dose of 200 mg three
times daily for at least 7 days. Mecillinam MICs were higher for
ESBL producers than non-producers: 68% of strains had CTX-M
Group 1 enzymes (including CTX-M-15) and 28% had Group 9
enzymes (including CTX-M-9 and -14). Treatment failure was
(atypically) defined as a new antibiotic prescription appropriate for
UTI within 2 weeks of the initial therapy or failure to clinically
improve. Clinical treatment failure with pivmecillinam was
observed in 18 (44%) patients infected by ESBL-producing strains
and in 16 (14%) patients with ESBL non-producing strains.
Mecillinam MICs for isolates from treatment failures (n " 34, 18
ESBLs) averaged 2 mg/L (range 1–4 mg/L) compared with MICs of
,1 mg/L for all isolates from treatment successes (n " 124, 23
ESBLs). Treatment failures occurred in 50% of cases with mecilli-
nam MICs of 2 mg/L, rising to 63% at MICs of 4 mg/L This compares
with a EUCAST breakpoint of S �8 mg/L, R .8 mg/L for mecillinam,
again suggesting inadequate levels or too high a breakpoint.
Multivariate analysis showed that ESBL status (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3–
7.8; P " 0.009) and increased MIC of mecillinam (OR 2.0 for each
doubling value of MIC, 95% CI 1.4–3.0; P , 0.001) were associated
with pivmecillinam treatment failure. Treatment failure rates
above 25% were associated with mecillinam MICs �2 mg/L for
ESBL producers and .4 mg/L for isolates lacking ESBL. From the
transconjugant study cited earlier it is likely that UK CTX-M-15-
producing isolates will be in this more-resistant category and will

 respond poorly if pivmecillinam is used alone. This study must be
seen also in the context of the earlier studies on the doses neces-
sary to achieve adequate urinary concentrations.
There has been controversy over whether studies should be
repeated with higher doses, such as 400 mg three times daily, but
a more effective action to improve cure rates may be combined
use of a regimen of 200 mg three times daily together with amoxi-
cillin/clavulanate at 375 mg three times daily. We recommend this
combination if oral pivmecillinam follow-on therapy is prescribed
following hospital or OPAT intravenous treatment for UTI involving
an ESBL producer. Co-administration of amoxicillin/clavulanate
may not only provide efficacy via inhibition of ESBL but also 10- to
100-fold bactericidal synergy by combining amoxicillin’s action on
PBP1 and 3 and mecillinam’s action on PBP2.431
Future use of co-amoxiclav, rather than clavulanate without
amoxicillin, in combination with mecillinam is partly supported by
a high-quality double-blind multicentre RCT of mecillinam and
ampicillin-congeners without clavulanate in pyelonephritis in
1995, in the era before CTX-M enzymes. Equivalent results to cefo-
taxime/cefadroxil were achieved with an oral switch from
parenteral mecillinam (no longer available) and ampicillin to
pivmecillinam (at 400 mg three times daily) plus an oral ampicillin
prodrug, suggesting that synergy of amoxicillin and pivmecillinam
potentially would be clinically useful in follow-on therapy for pye-
lonephritis. In modern circumstances, including against ESBL pro-
ducers, this efficacy might be restored by protecting both
mecillinam and amoxicillin by using them with clavulanate. A clini-
cal success rate of 93% for pivmecillinam as against 53% with piv-
ampicillin in a study in 1986 of pyelonephritis suggests the drug
has activity in the upper urinary tract.432 However, it is important
to note that clinical trials of the combination of amoxicillin/clavula-
nate with pivmecillinam have never been undertaken in pyelo-
nephritis, and pivmecillinam has no licence for pyelonephritis.
Further clinical comparative studies with outcome data are
urgently required for pivmecillinam, with and without clavulanate
(probably administered as amoxicillin/clavulanate), for both com-
plicated (including upper urinary tract) and lower UTI against ESBL
producers. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, unlike clavulanate alone, is
available and licensed for upper UTI. These trials would determine
pivmecillinam’s role and its potential to reduce the need for hospi-
talization or OPAT admissions to administer intravenous agents
active against ESBL producers.
Pivmecillinam is claimed to have a minimal effect on the intesti-
nal and vaginal flora of the host with little selection for resistant
bacteria, vaginal Candida or C. difficile.433 However, the earlier
study426 suggests it markedly reduces faecal E. coli, at least in chil-
dren. In an in vitro human gut model, it did not elicit C. difficile ger-
mination,
proliferation
or
toxin
production,
suggesting
that
superinfection with this pathogen should be rare if the drug is used
alone.434 Clinical studies with pivmecillinam/amoxicillin/clavulanate
regimens should include studies on persistence of ESBL-producing
E. coli gut colonization and new infections with C. difficile.
Overall there are uncertainties about how pivmecillinam should
best be used in the modern era. The drug has very valuable poten-
tial and these uncertainties need resolution by large clinical trials,
which are now urgent. Selection for resistant strains (such as SHV
producers) in the interim would be unfortunate and for this reason
we await further substantive trials and action and do not include
its use alone in our general recommendations.
Evidence
Pivmecillinam is a prodrug for mecillinam and is the sole oral b-lac-
tam (excluding tebipenem and faropenem, which are available
only in Asia) with some activity against ESBL- and AmpC-
producing organisms. It has a European licence, and is widely and
effectively used for lower UTI in some countries. Parenteral mecilli-
nam has been manufactured in the past but is now unavailable.
Evidence level: 2!!
Pivmecillinam has no published clinical trials against CPE and
in vitro activity appears poor or non-existent.
Evidence level: 4
Urinary levels following doses of 200 mg three times daily are
inadequate to inhibit some ESBL-producing MDR GNB, including
some with CTX-M-15 considered susceptible by the current
EUCAST breakpoint (S �8 mg/L).
Evidence level: 3
Failure rates with 200 mg of pivmecillinam three times daily
used alone against lower UTIs due to ESBL-producing E. coli are too
high to recommend regular use in such infections. A higher dose,
400 mg three times daily, has been proposed but there is no con-
vincing evidence to show it is more effective. Comparative studies
with fosfomycin have not been reported but there are no sugges-
tions of such ESBL-related failures in existing fosfomycin studies in
the absence of resistance.
Evidence level: 3
There are inadequate trial data to support the use of pivmecilli-
nam in Klebsiella infection, especially where the strain responsible
produces ESBLs.
Evidence level: 4
In vitro evidence and early trials of combination with ampicillin
or pivampicillin suggest that a useful measure to increase efficacy
would be combination with amoxicillin as well as clavulanate (see
below).
Evidence level: 2!
In vitro studies suggest that clavulanate (available clinically
only as amoxicillin/clavulanate) would protect mecillinam from
destruction by ESBLs and lower its MICs for Enterobacteriaceae. If
pivmecillinam is prescribed as follow-on to OPAT or inpatient treat-
ment, use of the combination is recommended.
Evidence level: 3
Clinical trials of pivmecillinam alone versus pivmecillinam with
amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower UTI would be in the public interest.
These should be sized to give information on efficacy against ESBL-
producing bacteria and should include studies on the bowel flora
and associated recurrence rates and C. difficile. If results of combi-
nation treatment are satisfactory, consideration should be given
to trials in upper UTI, including economic assessment against
OPAT treatment. Comparative trials with nitrofurantoin or fosfo-
mycin trometamol for MDR GNB lower UTI are also required.

10. Managing urinary tract infection
10.1 Diagnosis and the need for treatment
or prophylaxis
Because UTIs are the major group of infections due to antibiotic-
resistant Gram-negative infections in primary care, we have
chosen to make specific recommendations about their diagnosis
and about specific antibiotic stewardship.
Good practice in differentiating urinary infections from other
infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria is vital to reduce the
unnecessary use of antibiotics. When clinical variables were exam-
ined in a validation study435 of a previously derived predictive dip-
stick rule, based on having nitrite or both leucocytes and blood,436
the positive predictive value for urinary infection was 82% for
women with all three of cloudy urine, dysuria and nocturia. The
negative predictive value for urinary infection was 67% when none
of these three features was present.436 When individual clinical
features were considered alone, cloudy urine or dysuria was pre-
dictive of UTI, but nocturia or smelly urine was not,435 which brings
into question its value in the assessment above of the combination
of cloudy urine, dysuria and nocturia. In women aged 17–70years
with uncomplicated UTI, the negative predictive value when
nitrite, leucocytes and blood are ALL negative was 76%.435 The
positive predictive value for having nitrite alone or nitrite together
with either blood or leucocytes was 92%.435 A systematic review of
diagnostic studies found that the presence of vaginal discharge or
vaginal irritation reduced the probability of urinary infection to
20%–30%.437
Several different studies have shown the prevalence of asymp-
tomatic bacteriuria is about 6% in men and 16% in women aged
over 65years438 and is higher in older age groups and in the institu-
tionalized elderly. In a cohort study, 1173 elderly female residents
without catheters in care homes were followed for 9 years with
urine cultures every 6 months.439 No relationship was found
between ever having had asymptomatic bacteriuria and death
after adjusting for covariates (HR 1.10, 95% CI, 0.78–1.55). The
death rate in the group who never had asymptomatic bacteriuria
was similar to that in those who had bacteriuria but either received
no treatment or were treated (P . 0.2).439 The lack of benefit in
treating asymptomatic bacteriuria was confirmed in another
smaller study: neither mortality nor the frequency of symptomatic
episodes was reduced, but for every three women with asympto-
matic bacteriuria in a care home given antibiotics (the type was
not specified in this study), one experienced adverse effects (such
as rash or gastrointestinal symptoms).440 Cumulatively, 3%–6% of
people acquire bacteriuria per day of urinary catheterization even
with best practice for insertion and care of the catheter, and
therefore many older people with long-term catheters have
bacteriuria.441,442 Intermittent catheterization is associated with a
lower incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria than long-term
catheterization.443 Catheterized patients should only receive anti-
biotic treatment when they are systemically symptomatic, to
reduce the risk of colonization by antibiotic-resistant bacte-
ria.441,442 Differentiating UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria can
be particularly challenging in elderly patients with dementia as
they cannot always describe their symptoms. A positive urine cul-
ture or dipstick test will not differentiate between UTI and ASB.439
Patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria may have white blood
cells in the urine just as in true infection. In older patients, including
those with dementia, diagnosis should be based on a full clinical
assessment, including vital signs.
A Canadian RCT of a diagnostic and treatment algorithm for UTI
implemented in care homes, using a multifaceted approach,
reduced antibiotics for urinary indications by 31% compared with
control care homes, with no increase in hospital admissions or
mortality.444 Patients were considered for antibiotic treatment
based primarily on presence of fever greater than 37.9�C or 1.5�C
increase above baseline on at least two occasions over last 12h
and one or more signs of UTI.444 The full algorithm used is shown
in Figure 5. Fewer courses of antibiotics for suspected UTIs per
1000 resident days were prescribed in the intervention nursing
homes than in control care homes (1.17 versus 1.59 courses per
1000 resident days). Antimicrobials for suspected UTI represented
28.4% of all courses of drugs prescribed in the intervention nursing
homes compared with 38.6% prescribed in the control care homes
(weighted mean difference –9.6%, 95% CI #16.9% to –2.4%). No
significant difference was found in admissions to hospital or mor-
tality between the study arms.
In recurrent UTI, deciding whether to give prophylaxis is a bal-
ance between the benefits of reducing symptomatic relapse and
pyelonephritis versus side effects and the risks of selecting antibi-
otic resistance. Guidance is based on a systematic review of 19 tri-
als. Nightly prophylaxis in non-pregnant women with recurrent
urinary infection showed that prophylaxis reduced the relative risk
(RR) of having one microbiological recurrence by 5-fold (RR 0.21,
95% CI 0.13–0.34), giving a number-needed to treat (NNT) of 1.85
over 6–12months.445 However, adverse effects occurred, particu-
larly following nitrofurantoin, and 30% of women did not adhere
to treatment. Any benefit was lost as soon as the prophylaxis
stopped. Post-coital antibiotics were equally effective as nightly
prophylaxis.445,446 Previous studies before the rise in resistance
showed the same effect with post-coital single-dose cefalexin
when used for recurrent urinary infection in pregnancy.447 If recur-
rence is not too frequent it may be better to provide the patient
with standby nitrofurantoin, to take as soon as symptoms occur;
this approach was shown to result in less use of antibiotics and
intuitively should result in less antibiotic resistance. Studies with
cefalexin before the rise of ESBLs showed a slight increase in use,
with post-coital cefalexin offset considerably by antibiotics used in
treatment of UTI recurrences.448 The offset needs to be taken into

 account in individual patients if standby nitrofurantoin is used.
Prophylaxis, if used, can usually be stopped after a year without a
resumption of the recurrences405 and there are now European
guidelines that this review should be made at 6 months.449 The
increase in trimethoprim resistance makes prophylaxis with this
drug less suitable than it was and prolonged nitrofurantoin is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of unwanted pulmonary damage,
although this is rare. Patients on prophylaxis for .6 months should
be reviewed. If the patient wishes to continue with a prophylactic
regimen, consideration should be given in advance as to which
antibiotic would be appropriately substituted for trimethoprim,
nitrofurantoin or indeed ciprofloxacin (which can also be used in
prophylaxis), if resistance develops or a breakthrough infection
occurs. Persisting with an agent where breakthrough with a resist-
ant strain has occurred will be ineffective. Cranberry juice prophy-
laxis is less effective in preventing breakthrough infection but
co-trimoxazole generates more multiple resistance in break-
through strains.450 Prophylaxis with b-lactam antibiotics com-
monly selects for resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the faecal flora
and is not recommended.451 There are relevant studies of prophy-
laxis after symptomatic UTI in infants who show similar problems
with emergence of resistance on continuous prophylactic antibiot-
ics,
including
resistance
to
cephalosporins
due
to
ESBL
production.452,511
NICE notes that prophylactic antibiotics given at catheter
change or insertion do not reduce infections in those with uro-
logical conditions and recommends that they should not be
used;453 such use for any indication contributes to pressure on
emergence of resistance and should be avoided. NICE recom-
mends that clinicians should consider antibiotic prophylaxis at
change of catheter for patients who: (i) have a history of symp-
tomatic UTI after catheter change; or (ii) experience trauma
during catheterization (frank haematuria after catheterization
or two or more attempts of catheterization). Placement of an
incontinence implant is also an indication for short-term pro-
phylaxis but the recent insertion of an orthopaedic implant
is not.
Evidence
Specific symptoms and signs hitherto accepted as characteristic of
urinary infection have different predictive values.
Evidence level: 1!
In women with uncomplicated urinary infection the highest
positive predictive value for strip testing was for having nitrite
alone or nitrite with either positive leucocyte esterase or blood.
Evidence level 1!
There is no patient benefit in treating asymptomatic bacteriuria
except in pregnancy.
Evidence level: 1!
Using an algorithm based on fever and at least one sign of uri-
nary infection reduces the number of antibiotic prescriptions in
nursing homes.
Evidence level: 3
Treatment or prophylaxis with antibiotics in catheterized
patients increases colonization by antibiotic-resistant strains.
Evidence level: 1!
Prophylactic antibiotics given short-term at catheter change or
insertion do not reduce infections but are indicated with specific
criteria of: (i) traumatic catheterization; (ii) previous severe symp-
tomatic infection on catheter change; or (iii) to cover placement of
a urinary continence implant.
Evidence level: 4
In recurrent UTI, antibiotic prophylaxis is very effective whether
given daily (Evidence level: 1!!) or post-coitally (Evidence level:
1!) but an alternative is to consider pre-prescribed standby antibi-
otics to take at the onset of symptoms.
Evidence level 4.
If prophylaxis is used and effective it should be usually
restricted to 6 months prescription.
Evidence level 3
Previous resistances or breakthrough of resistant isolates on
prophylaxis should preclude use of an agent and consideration
should be given to unwanted effects with long courses and what
antibiotic would be chosen for breakthroughs.
Evidence level 4
Recommendations
• Always consider the positive and negative predictive value of
specific symptoms before sending urine for culture or starting
antibiotics for a UTI. Use dipstick tests, if no catheter is present,
to confirm the diagnosis before prescribing, especially when
symptoms are mild or not localized.
Grading: Strong recommendation for
• For an elderly patient, do NOT send urine for culture or start
empirical antibiotics unless there are specific symptoms or
signs of UTI and none elsewhere. Use the algorithm in Figure 5
to decide whether to do this in elderly patients, especially in
those with dementia.
Grading: Conditional recommendation for
• Do not prescribe antibiotics in ASB in the elderly with or without
an indwelling catheter.
Grading: Strong recommendation for
• Avoid antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary catheter insertion or
changes unless there is previous history of symptomatic UTI
with the procedure, insertion of incontinence implant, or
trauma at catheterization.
Grading: Conditional recommendation for
• To reduce recurrent UTI, consider first the option of pre-
prescribed standby antibiotics to take when symptoms begin,
rather than daily or post-coital antibiotic prophylaxis.
Grading: Conditional recommendation for
• Where prophylaxis is used successfully for recurrent infection in
adults limit use to 6 months.

10.2 Choosing a suitable antibiotic
Choosing an antibiotic to which a uropathogen is susceptible is
important, as UTI symptoms resolve more slowly when an inap-
propriate antibiotic is given.454 All patients should be given advice
on when to seek further medical advice, i.e. if their symptoms wor-
sen (even if, after taking antibiotics, on the same day) or do not
improve after several days. Treating patients with infections due to
MDR GNB in the community is a challenge as oral antimicrobial
treatment is preferred. ESBL-producing bacteria are generally
resistant to trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin and cephalo-
sporins; susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate is variable and

 interpretation by the laboratory is affected by different breakpoints
used formerly by BSAC, and currently by EUCAST, or CLSI.
Local community antibiotic guidance should be informed by
national and local surveillance data. An algorithm on choices based
on the individual agents discussed is given in Figure 4. Choosing
between fosfomycin, pivmecillinam and nitrofurantoin is difficult as
there are no direct comparisons of these three antibiotics in infec-
tions due to ESBL-producing organisms. High failure rates with piv-
mecillinam may be due to the precise ESBL present and not using
the drug in combination with amoxicillin/clavulanate, or possibly
inadequate dosage: optimal ways to use the drug now in the UK
have not been proven. In urinary infections due to non-ESBL-
producing organisms, nitrofurantoin for 3 days (or 7days, which is
not significantly different from the results of a 5day course)410 and
a single dose of fosfomycin have similar efficacy.455,456
In a systematic review of the length of antibiotic treatment for
acute uncomplicated urinary infection before the rise in prevalence
of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, therapy for 3days, delivered
in the case of fosfomycin trometamol by a single 3g dose, was simi-
larly effective to prolonged therapy in achieving symptomatic cure
for cystitis.512 However, in this systematic review bacteriological fail-
ure rates in the subgroup of trials where the same antibiotic was
used in both short and long treatment arms of the trial were higher
in the short-duration arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07–1.74; P" 0.01).
After a single dose of fosfomycin, high concentrations are usually
maintained in the urine for 2days. This is usually curative in uncom-
plicated UTI in women, but for infection due to confirmed ESBL pro-
ducers, or in males, a second dose on the third day has been
suggested to promote bacteriological cure.457 On the same basis
7 not 3days of nitrofurantoin would be recommended for con-
firmed ESBL-producing bacteria and 7days for pivmecillinam regi-
mens. Although frequently used as an endpoint in regulatory trials,
it is uncertain if bacteriological cure immediately after treatment is
of any long-term clinical or bacteriological significance in patients
with UTIs involving MDR GNB, but the precautionary principle of
adequate elimination of infections with MDR GNB would suggest
regimens for best bacteriological cure should be followed in such
cases. Eight studies in the systematic review included pivmecillinam
at various doses and durations. An analysis of E. coli strains from per-
sistent or relapsed infection after pivmecillinam showed an
increased frequency of phylogenetic group B2 (which includes
ST131) and showed that, when matched by virulence factors, 7days
of treatment was preferable to 3days of therapy because it was less
likely to be followed by persistence or relapse.458 Studies of urinary
infection with strains producing the CTX-M-15-ESBL suggest that
pivmecillinam alone at 200mg three times daily is inadequate treat-
ment. In vitro studies suggesting use with amoxicillin/clavulanate
have not been followed by clinical trials.
Based on evidence collected before the spread of ESBL-
producing strains, nitrofurantoin (100mg twice daily) should be
given for 3 days, not 7 days, for fully susceptible strains. No trials of
nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily with ESBL-producing strains
have been published, although the antibiotic is widely used.
Efficacy, relapse/recurrence rates or incidence of spread to the
upper urinary tract or bloodstream are all uncertain and no studies
have been published on the emergence of resistance during or
after treatment or in relapses. MDR Klebsiella spp., but not E. coli,
are commonly resistant to nitrofurantoin but the mechanisms for
resistance in the UK have not been investigated recently.
Evidence
Local community antibiotic guidance on empirical treatment of
urinary infection should be informed by national and local surveil-
lance data.
Evidence level: 4
In lower uncomplicated UTI where risk factors for MDR GNB are
present these four treatment options can be used rather than
trimethoprim:
(i)
Fosfomycin trometamol.
Evidence level: 2!
(ii) Nitrofurantoin (unless patient’s eGFR is less than
45mL/min/1.73m2).
Evidence level: 2!
(iii) Pivmecillinam, but in vitro and clinical data suggest
this is less successful than fosfomycin trometamol or
nitrofurantoin for ESBL-producing bacteria likely to be
present in the UK.

(iv) Another other relevant antibiotic if the causative organism
is confirmed as susceptible.

when compiling local antibiotic guidelines on treatment of UTI.

GNB are suspected.
Grading: Strong recommendation for
• Use nitrofurantoin for 5 days with MDR GNB. Alternatively
use fosfomycin trometamol 3 g orally as a single dose, and
repeat on the third day only if MDR GNB are confirmed to
improve bacteriological cure. Pivmecillinam at 200 mg three
times daily for 7 days may be a third-line choice but consider
combination use with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Clinical trial
results on pivmecillinam for MDR GNB in the UK are urgently
required.

10.3 Treatment of pyelonephritis and complicated UTI
caused by MDR GNB
Whenever resistant pathogens are anticipated, it is essential
to send a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing
before empirical treatment and such specimens will be useful in
this condition even if resistant pathogens are not anticipated.

 As nitrofurantoin, pivmecillinam and oral fosfomycin are currently
considered inappropriate in suspected or confirmed pyelonephritis,
intravenous ertapenem (unlicensed in Europe for this indication)
should be given in an OPAT setting to treat patients with pyelo-
nephritis confirmed or suspected to be caused by ESBL-producing
pathogens
that
are
resistant to trimethoprim
and quino-
lones.163,164 If the patient requires admission to hospital, merope-
nem or, depending on costs and local policy, ceftolozane/
tazobactam or temocillin should be given for infection due to
ESBL-producing strains. Piperacillin/tazobactam may be consid-
ered if the isolate has been shown to be susceptible. Amikacin
might be considered but activity may be impaired if AAC(60)-Ib-cr is
produced. In practice strains with this enzyme may be reported as
either susceptible or resistant and the enzyme cannot easily be
detected: no trials of amikacin use against such strains have been
reported. Measuring amikacin levels promptly and adjusting doses
is less likely to be easily supportable than use of gentamicin, but
the latter is unsuitable for infection with ESBL producers unless
susceptibility is known.
Ceftazidime/avibactam or non-b-lactam agents in combination
perhaps with meropenem should be considered for infections with
CPE (Figure 4). Temocillin may have a place for more susceptible
strains with KPC carbapenemases but this has not been estab-
lished by trials; it does not have a role against strains with MBLs or
OXA-48-like carbapenemases. Such factors and choices are impor-
tant when empirically treating pyelonephritis caused by probable

 If a patient with pyelonephritis due to ESBL-producing bacteria
has penicillin or cephalosporin hypersensitivity, there are two alter-
native strategies. Firstly meropenem can be given despite a risk of
cross-allergenicity, which is now thought to be largely hypotheti-
cal. In this case caution must be exercised, with appropriate drugs
ready to treat any severe acute reaction. This seems to be safe.154
Alternatively, urgent susceptibility tests by automated methods
should be performed. Depending on any previous results for the
patient’s isolates, intravenous gentamicin or amikacin (which has
more auditory than vestibular toxicity but a lower resistance rate
than gentamicin) may initially be used until a less-toxic antibiotic
can be identified from the concurrent susceptibility testing.
Trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin or co-amoxiclav can be used in pyelo-
nephritis if the pathogen is known to be susceptible (or a suscepti-
ble organism has been isolated in the preceding month with a

 community-onset acute pyelonephritis due to ESBL-producing
E.coli compared 85patients receiving carbapenems with67 receiv-
ing other agents to which the infecting bacterium was susceptible
in vitro. There was no difference in rates of clinical or microbiologi-
cal failure.459 A randomized double-blind controlled trial showed
that 7 days of ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily was as effective as
14days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against susceptible
organisms. However, trimethoprim and quinolone resistance are
now common and therefore none of these agents remains suit-
able for empirical use in any case of pyelonephritis.460 The substi-
tution of OPAT therapy for oral antibiotic use in early pyelonephritis
has not been costed for its effects on services.
Evidence
Pending antibiotic susceptibility testing, patients at increased risk
of MDR GNB and suspected of pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs
(i.e. indwelling catheter, recent urinary instrumentation, renal
stones, prostatic obstruction, diabetes, immunosuppression, preg-
nancy, functional or anatomical urological abnormality)437 can be
treated empirically with:
(i) OPAT with intravenous ertapenem.
Evidence level: 2!
(ii) Admission for (a) intravenous meropenem, temocillin or cef-
tolozane/tazobactam if infected by ESBL-producing E. coli or
Klebsiella spp.; (b) intravenous fosfomycin and colistin with or
without meropenem or ceftazidime/avibactam therapy if
infected by a susceptible carbapenemase producer.

caution or gentamicin (if no past evidence of resistance) or

(iii) Trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin or co-amoxiclav if urine testing
shows an organism that was susceptible in the preceding
month and there has been no history of clinical failure.
Evidence level: 1!
Recommendations
• In pyelonephritis always collect a urine sample before treat-
ment. MDR GNB are unlikely to respond to oral treatment so
consider risk factors for an MDR isolate, including travel. Use an
active oral agent only if the patient is well enough and if known
to have had ciprofloxacin-, trimethoprim- or co-amoxiclav-
susceptible MDR GNB in last month.
Grading: Conditional recommendation for
• If the patient has pyelonephritis and risk factors for MDR GNB,
start, if hospitalization not required, empirical intravenous ther-
apy with ertapenem if OPAT therapy available. This will treat
ESBL- and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. If the patient
needs hospitalization, or OPAT is not available, admit for mero-
penem, temocillin or ceftolozane/tazobactam if no evidence of
a CPE organism. If the patient is penicillin hypersensitive then
the hospital may use amikacin or meropenem, or if only sus-
ceptible isolates in the past, gentamicin. If carbapenem-
resistant bacteria are, or have been, present, base treatment
on susceptibility testing of recent or current isolates.

10.4 What is the threshold level of resistance for
changing the choice of empirical treatment for UTIs?
Most patients with UTI are treated empirically, particularly in a first
episode of lower UTI. Failure of empirical therapy, particularly in
complicated UTI (e.g. pyelonephritis), is a common source of Gram-
negative bacteraemia where increased 30 day mortality is associ-
ated with ineffective empirical therapy,256,461 though perhaps only
in patients with sepsis syndrome. The probability of ineffective
empirical therapy would be predicted to increase as the proportion
of ESBL-producing, or carbapenem-resistant, bacteria rises. Older
narrower-spectrum antibiotics may be recommended for empirical
use in order to slow the emergence of resistance. One group of
authors asserts that the right of future patients to come to less
harm outweighs the right of the present patient to share in deci-
sions on antibiotic treatment,462 but this is a view many do not
share. There is no agreement within the Working Party on the
threshold resistance rate to an antibiotic that would justify substitu-
tion of other agents, nor on the degree to which routine laboratory
testing of submitted samples overestimates the ‘true’ resistance
rate.463 Rates of 20% have been suggested as justifying a change
of empirical treatment in UTI. Confounders are: (i) that resistance
rates are affected by duplicates within the series, including when
infection control sampling is intensive;464 (ii) a bias towards per-
forming culture and susceptibility only for difficult/unresponsive
cases; (iii) sequential testing of second-line agents only for resistant
strains according to local laboratory policy;117 and (iv) differences in
breakpoints between laboratories. These sources of variation may
justify central susceptibility testing of all UTI from sentinel groups of
general practitioners (GPs) in regions for national surveillance pur-
poses or requirements for national notification and annual updat-
ing of method changes and assessment of their effects.465 Local
and regional variations exist in resistance rates for ESBLs as demon-
strated by regional and national surveys. Quinolone resistance
rates in E. coli are below 20% in most reported susceptibility surveys
but resistance in bacteraemia is associated with increased mortal-
ity and with the ST131 group of strains, which have an unrivalled
ability to acquire other resistances. The risk of selection for resist-
ance with a switch from trimethoprim leads us not to recommend
their widespread use.
When the probability of bacteraemia arising from UTI rises, a
lower threshold for altering normal treatment to cover a resistant
strain is needed owing to the greater risk to the individual patient.
A threshold of ,5% resistance may be appropriate for higher-risk
situations.
Evidence
There are no accurate current figures on the prevalence of antibi-
otic resistance in UTI. Routine clinical data are subject to sample
bias. These probably lead to overestimated resistance.
Evidence level: 2#
A threshold of 20% true resistance has been suggested as an
indication to change ‘first-line’ empirical treatment of lower UTI. A
lower threshold of, perhaps, 5% is appropriate when the risk of
the patient becoming bacteraemic is increased. The Working
Party consider that, in the absence of accurate national resistance
surveillance, these or similar thresholds presently can only be
applied at a local laboratory level with (i) careful de-duplication,

11. What effect does good antibiotic
stewardship have on rates of MDR GNB?
11.1 The impact of good antibiotic stewardship in
secondary/tertiary care facilities
The evidence base and practice of antibiotic stewardship in the UK
has been recently promulgated in the PHE ‘Guidelines for
Antimicrobial Prescribing and Stewardship Competencies’466 and
the guidance from NICE Guideline 15 ‘Antimicrobial stewardship:
systems and processes for effective antimicrobial medicine
use’.467 This report will focus on aspects of stewardship that per-
tain to MDR GNB: more general aspects can be found also in the
above sources. A Cochrane systematic review showed that inter-
ventions to reduce excessive antibiotic prescribing to hospital
inpatients might reduce antimicrobial resistance and that inter-
ventions to increase effective prescribing can improve clinical
outcome.468 Of the 89 studies cited to 2009 (reporting 95 interven-
tions), 56 were interrupted time series (ITS), 25 were RCTs, 5 were
controlled before–after studies (CBAs) and three were controlled
clinical trials (CCTs). The reporting of outcomes was very variable
(only 13/25 RCTs reported on mortality and only 5 on readmis-
sions), complicating the comparative assessment of studies.
Interventions that enhanced the quality of prescribing in patients
(defined softly as prescribing in accordance with guidelines)
with any infection had no effect on mortality whereas interven-
tions to increase compliance with evidence-based guidelines in
community-acquired pneumonia, usually due to Gram-positive
S. pneumoniae, were associated with reduced mortality. Reducing
prescribing for all indications, determined as excessive by refer-
ence to evidence-based guidelines, was associated with increased
re-admission but not with increased mortality or length of stay.
Restrictive and persuasive interventions were associated with
improved prescribing outcomes based on median outcome effect
(proportion of subjects with an improvement or change in antibi-
otic selection, dose, route or duration versus control). Multifaceted
interventions were common but not necessarily more effective
than simple interactions. Most (80/95, 84%) of the interventions
targeted the antibiotic prescribed (choice of antibiotic, timing of
first dose and route of administration). The remaining 15/95 inter-
ventions aimed to change exposure of patients to antibiotics by
targeting the decision to treat or the duration of treatment. Only
nine studies reported the effect of interventions on colonization or
infection with antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Seven
of these were ITSs, with a median effect size of 47%.469–474
Although most studies reported .25% reduction in coloniza-
tion/infection with resistant Gram-negative bacteria, the confi-
dence intervals were wide and in two studies the effects were not
statistically significant471,475 and one crossover study of cycling
empirical gentamicin, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam
showed an unintended increase of 39% in colonization with GNB
resistant to any of the target drugs.476 One cluster CCT in neonatal
units showed, as intended, a reduction from baseline in coloniza-
tion/infection of 68% by cefotaxime-resistant organisms, predomi-
nantly E. cloacae, when the initial empirical treatment was
penicillin and tobramycin rather than ampicillin/cefotaxime.477
That study, the only one of the nine to report on mortality, showed
a small increase in mortality when penicillin and tobramycin was
substituted for cefotaxime/ampicillin in matched neonatal units.
A 2017 update of this Cochrane review478 concluded that there
was still no statistically significant evidence that antibiotic stew-
ardship reduced multiple antibiotic resistance, although the
impact on C. difficile is undoubted. Additionally this updated
unwanted effects from stewardship interventions, including an
aminoglycoside substitution producing acute kidney injury282 (see
Section 7.12) and studies where there was consequent delay in
instituting antibiotics. Furthermore, some studies reported a dis-
ruption of interaction between physicians and infection specialists
as guidelines were used more frequently. Nevertheless, an edito-
rial on this review called for stewardship to be adopted in every
healthcare institution.479 One must now consider the homogene-
ity and quality of local hospital guidelines, given guideline compli-
ance is being used as a criterion of good stewardship.
In the 2013 Cochrane review,468 11 studies of attempts to
reduce excessive prescribing reported data on mortality with no
significant overall effect seen (and this continued to be the case in
the 2017 revision).513 Interestingly, one of the ITS studies exam-
ined the impact of a switch from penicillin and gentamicin to peni-
cillin and amikacin in a neonatal unit with gentamicin-resistant
E. cloacae infections and showed a reduction in gentamicin-
resistant E. cloacae but an increase is E. aerogenes and
enterococci.474
Kaki et al.480 produced another systematic review of antibiotic
stewardship programmes, limited to the critical care unit. These
included three RCTs, three ITSs and 18 uncontrolled before-and-
after studies. Introduction of various antibiotic stewardship inter-
ventions led to 11%–38% reductions in antimicrobial DDDs/1000
patient-days (except in a single study that found an increase of
6%), and lower total antimicrobial costs. Stewardship programmes
led to shorter average duration of antibiotic therapy, less inappro-
priate use and fewer antibiotic-related adverse events. They also
found some reductions in antimicrobial resistance rates extending
beyond 6 months.
A meta-analysis of 52 ITSs was used to compare restrictive ver-
sus persuasive interventions.468 Restrictive interventions had sig-
nificantly greater impact on prescribing outcomes at 1 month
(32%, 95% CI 2%–61%; P " 0.03) and on microbial outcomes at
6 months (53%, 95% CI 31%–75%; P " 0.001) but there were no
significant differences at 12 or 24months. Clinical outcome data
were limited, with 11 studies reporting on all-cause mortality but
with no defined time-boundary, 4 studies showing increased

 mortality and 7 finding decreased mortality, giving a non-
significant overall effect (0.92, 95% CI 0.81–1.06; P " 0.25).
In the USA, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently
commissioned a systematic review of antimicrobial stewardship
programmes (ASPs).481,482 The key findings have been published
and the reader is referred to these publications for details.483,484 To
avoid duplication, the VA systematic review only included papers
meeting their eligibility criteria but not included in the 2013
Cochrane review. The review reported mixed results for clinical/
microbial outcomes and overall improvement in prescribing.
Because (i) few studies of different interventions reported each
outcome, (ii) there was inconsistency across studies and (iii) there
was medium/high risk of bias, the strength of evidence for all clini-
cal outcomes was low: no single ASP was found to be superior but
amongst studies since 2000 the greatest body of evidence of
effectiveness was for decreasing inappropriate or increasing
appropriate antibiotic use. Effects were seen across all species of
Gram-negative bacteria and broad-spectrum antimicrobials.
There are individual studies of high quality. Introduction of a
stewardship programme in one US hospital reduced the use of
broad-spectrum agents, and was associated with a reduction in
hospital-acquired infections caused by MDR GNB from 37% to 8%
over 6 years.485 Similarly, resistance in P. aeruginosa declined
when state guidelines on stewardship were implemented using a
computerized programme in an Australian ICU.486 In another
study in Israel, a carbapenem-restriction policy was used as part of
a successful infection control strategy also including emergency
department flagging of colonized or infected patients, building an
isolation facility, eradication of clusters, and environmental and
personnel hand cultures, with rectal screening of 8376 patients.
This was effective in controlling an outbreak of carbapenem-
resistant K. pneumoniae. Although there was a significant reduc-
tion in meropenem use, prescription of colistin rose.487 Restriction
of use of some antibiotics may need, or lead to, use of a diversity of
other agents and even introduction of newly available antibiotics
or appropriate use of older agents. These aspects also need to be
subject to stewardship with appropriate actions in responsible
bodies within hospitals and reporting to users. This can be complex
and time consuming. Some effective interventions are simple; for
example, a high-quality study compared 8 and 15day antibiotic
treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (n " 401) and did
not find any difference in mortality or unfavourable outcome.
Patients who received 8 days of treatment had significantly less
emergence of MDR pathogens (42% versus 62%; P " 0.04) but had
a higher recurrence rate if they initially had non-fermenting organ-
isms as pathogen [40.6% versus 25.4% (risk difference 15.2%),
95% CI 3.9%–26.6%].488
Effective antibiotic stewardship requires the use of timely bac-
terial antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Relatively simple pheno-
typic tests, such as a comprehensive antibiogram by automated
methods, screening for resistance in bacteraemia isolates by direct
disc testing,514 double disc diffusion tests for ESBL, and biochemi-
cal carbapenemase detection, can provide useful information for
treatment and infection control purposes.515 Automated diagnos-
tic
tests
for
bacterial
identification
(e.g.
MALDI-TOF)
and
PCR-based resistance gene detection (e.g. CepheidV
R for carbapene-
mase and ESBL detection) can provide even more detailed infor-
mation within the same day for MDR GNB. More rapid susceptibility
testing methods for resistance detection are being developed.
Further information may be found in recent reviews.515–518
This information together with promptly administered appro-
priate antibiotics is likely to improve prognosis. All UK laboratories
should have access to the phenotypic and basic genotypic meth-
ods described above within their resources. As a performance
measure, overall time elapsed from sample collection to adminis-
tration of treatment appropriate to the bacterial susceptibility
can and should be assessed and repeatedly audited against
what could best be achieved with modern methods. Particular
attention should be paid to MDR GNB as defined either for com-
munity- or hospital-originating strains. Audit of outcomes associ-
ated
with
bacteraemia
provides
an
objective
measure
of
the appropriateness of antimicrobial treatment, particularly for
MDR GNB.
The deployment of antibiotic stewardship programmes is varia-
ble, as shown by a survey of 660 hospitals in 67 countries.489 That
study included the first data from sites in Asia, Africa and South
America, many with considerable problems with MDR GNB. There
is an urgent need for the adoption of an international antibiotic
stewardship timetable.
Evidence
Up-to-date local resistance and outcome surveillance data are
needed to inform guidelines on empirical antibiotic advice and
must be persuasive to medical and nursing staff, to all prescribers
and to pharmacists advising on guidelines.
Evidence level: 4
Interventions intended to decrease prescribing that is exces-
sive (by reference to guidelines) for specific antibiotics have
been associated with reductions in both colonization and infec-
tions caused by carbapenem, aminoglycoside or cephalosporin-
resistant bacteria, but this is not a consistent finding across all
stewardship initiatives.
Evidence level: 2!!
Restrictive rather than persuasive prescribing interventions
cause a significant short-term change in prescribing and there is
scanty evidence that they may contribute to reductions in the
prevalence of resistant GNB. Persuasive prescribing interventions
should also be used and are as effective over a 1–2 year period.
Evidence level: 2!!
Clinical outcome data on infections that is linked to antibiotic
prescribing should be collected as well as data on resistance and
prescriptions of antimicrobials to ensure stewardship approaches
do not degrade outcomes, and ensure high and consistent stand-
ards between hospitals.
Evidence level: 2!!
Audit and feedback should be used to reduce antimicrobial use
in hospitals. Local and national advice on which antibiotics to pre-
scribe are a useful standard against which to conduct audits and
to explore clinical and microbiological outcomes.
Evidence level: 4

in all care settings, based on resistance rates, with audit of

11.2 The national monitoring of good antibiotic
stewardship in secondary/tertiary care facilities
Antibiotic therapy differs from other treatment in man in being
directed against diverse and frequently unknown organisms and
in exercising selection for resistant organisms; these change the
potential target for drug action and may then cause infection
either in the same or other patients. Treatment options for infec-
tions due to MDR GNB are restricted and failure to deploy appropri-
ate treatment in these infections may be associated with a poor
outcome whereas excessive use of a single agent in a hospital or
unit is more likely to select for superinfection caused by resistant
organisms. The clinical governance of antibiotic policies is there-
fore a balance between treatment of the individual and manage-
ment of the community’s antibiotic armamentarium.
Antibiotic use and the prevalence of MDR GNB are now widely
monitored in communities and hospitals but (i) monitoring use
does not indicate whether use was appropriate, and (ii) monitoring
the accumulative prevalence of resistant strains is no guide to the
incidence rate of new cases caused by MDR GNB. Root cause analy-
sis of individual cases is burdensome and very complex if it is
intended to relate to outcome. It also runs the risk of bias with
regard to outcome unless the proportions of resistant or suscepti-
ble organisms that are examined match the overall population. It
does not produce reliable statistically comparable data between
institutions to support good practice. Nevertheless, such compari-
sons were used with MRSA bacteraemia and C. difficile in the past
in the UK, but these are acute events unlike the chronic prevalence
of antibiotic-resistant strains.
Clinical trials early in a product’s availability offer guidance on
efficacy against susceptible organisms and, with some agents, an
indication of potential for selection for resistance. However, antibi-
otic efficacy is not usually sustained as resistance emerges, and
unlike other classes of drug, early clinical trials become less rele-
vant with the passage of time. Anticipating when empirical ther-
apy should include coverage against MDR GNB is difficult but is a
key part of local guidelines. Recommendations that (i) limit use of
broad-spectrum drugs such as carbapenems or (ii) reserve particu-
lar agents for patients with MDR GNB present in infections that
have a potential high mortality need also to consider the potential
hazard of poor clinical outcomes.
Despite assistance from other professions, deployment of infec-
tion and microbiology specialists into surveillance and away from
patient care is frequent, and mundane tasks in surveillance
employing specialists should be reduced to a minimum, without
excessively compromising data quality. Routine national reporting
systems on bacteraemia in the UK should be routinely linked to
public health date-of-death data held nationally for each person
by the Office for National Statistics, as has been described in one
study restricted to E. coli bacteraemia.102 Such linked information
should be fed back annually to, and within, individual hospitals and
summarized findings should be provided to hospitals to enable
comparisons of performance. Incidence and mortality rates in bac-
teraemia at the local level would provide key assurance on the pre-
vention of systemic infections and the quality of outcomes. If
these data on outcome were provided by patients, it would provide
a focus to examine and attempt to reduce the increasing incidence
of bacteraemias and their associated mortality. Furthermore,
these data would ensure locally that overall and specific audit
could be made of the antibiotic resistance in organisms and the
antibiotics actually deployed to treat the serious infections that
they caused. Added to existing data, such audit and source infor-
mation could nationally and locally identify locations where there
is high mortality either in primary or secondary/tertiary care, ena-
bling appropriate investigation and action to be taken locally. A
crucial foundation has already been organized in England and
Scotland via mandatory reporting of bacteraemia data for E. coli
which specifically include, inter alia, data on community or hospital
onset and nursing home residency entered locally by laboratories.
In England, laboratories voluntarily and automatically (via com-
puter links) submit antibiotic susceptibility data for 82% (54301/
66512 over 2 years) of cases of E. coli bacteraemia reported by the
mandatory programme, which does not itself capture susceptibil-
ity data. This could be built upon to deliver local and nationally use-
ful data on outcome by antibiotic resistance.94 Furthermore, this
process should be expanded to capture mortality information on
other important bacteraemias, e.g. Klebsiella spp., where preva-
lence is increasing and resistance is a major global threat, or
indeed to all bacteraemias. Reduction in the absolute number of
associated deaths from bacteraemia may well involve changes
other than in chemotherapy, provided audit suggests chemother-
apy is actively employed and appropriate. This requires multidisci-
plinary joint engagement and clinical management expertise in
the community quite as much as in hospital to avoid sepsis and
improve its management. A decrease in prevalence of bacterae-
mia and MDR within such infections is one aspect of this.
Quantitative reduction in the number of deaths, and not changes
in the comparative position of hospitals and communities in their
respective peer groups, should be the focus.
Bacteraemias should be assigned reliably as being of commun-
ity-, wider healthcare- or hospital-onset so that responsibility can
be assigned and accepted for performance by relevant commis-
sioning groups, public health services and hospitals. Whilst the
date of sampling of bacteraemia can be recorded, patients may
become colonized by the causative bacterium much earlier and
the exact timing of acquisition usually cannot be proven from
existing laboratory records. IT coordination and shared responsibil-
ity across the health economy is needed to access the last date of
discharge from hospital, which may be a practical proxy for date of
colonization in cases of apparent community acquisition that are
actually hospital-acquired. Where care does not involve transfer to
a tertiary centre and the patient is not being admitted to multiple
hospitals in a conurbation, such information should already be
available in many localities, but non-automated extraction is time
consuming. It is important for securing improvement that the

 bacteria isolated from bacteraemias can be related to likely
acquisition in hospital, wider healthcare or community and not
simply to onset in hospital or community and that responsibility for
resistant strains falls accurately on hospitals or community com-
missioners of healthcare. Targeting reductions in MDR GNB in
potentially life-threatening infection is problematic because of var-
iations between community populations in ethnic origin associ-
ated
apparently
with
antibiotic
resistance
such
as
ESBL
production.4,137 For this reason a simple process of commissioned
reduction in resistance may be unachievable in some communities
and their associated hospitals.
Residence in a nursing home is a marker of healthcare acquisi-
tion, not general community acquisition, and nursing-home
patients should be separately and reliably categorized. Dates of
hospital discharge of patients admitted from nursing homes may
be relevant to intervention if the patient has moved between the
nursing home and hospital recently—say within the last 2 years.
Tertiary and international referral in some hospitals (including
referrals from armed forces deployed overseas490), even if the hos-
pitals are not formally categorized as specialist hospitals, may also
skew their resistance profile towards multiple resistance,491,492 so
it is important to keep a balance between recognizing that this
may be a reason for high resistance rates and ensuring that such
resistant strains should be, as they always have been, a target for
effective infection control. Again for this reason, targeting antibi-
otic resistance reduction appropriately within a national context
may be more straightforward if it is directed at a local level.
Dates of collection of blood cultures, as recorded in laboratory
computer systems, may be distorted by entry of default dates of
registration on Monday mornings after submission of samples
from Friday night on wards. There is no information on the fre-
quency of this problem but it is time consuming to retrospectively
correct or prospectively avoid. An interval of ,3 days since admis-
sion is recommended for defining ‘community onset’ as more
practical than the 48h limit suggested internationally and prob-
ably without important consequence, if permitted. This should be
investigated if the mandatory programme is expanded as recom-
mended. Laboratory data should not be reported multiple times
and should utilize as little manual entry as possible and hospital
trusts should ensure the automated transfer of data from labora-
tory systems to monitoring bodies. Information transfer should be
frequent. However in the presence of good infection control and
absence of an ongoing MDR GNB outbreak, annual batch process-
ing of mortality linkage and annual central audit should be
adequate in most hospitals for governance monitoring of hospi-
tals, and this would be adequate to support changes to infection
management, including antibiotic policy (which are seldom made
more frequently). Not only good performance in reducing antibi-
otic use but also better-than-average performance in bacteraemia
reduction and better outcomes in bacteraemia (including that
which is antibiotic resistant) should be rewarded.
Such laboratory-based extended surveillance of all bacterae-
mias would address: (i) the diversity of organisms and, at a local
level, the match to antibiotics prescribed (which itself could be cen-
trally reported, if pharmacy systems and laboratory systems are
linked by patient/NHS number and then ordered by concatenated
patient/NHS number and reversed Julian date); (ii) the usual, but
not invariable, progression in antibiotic resistance rates; and
(iii) the need for organizations to make changes to prescribing
policy with document control, feedback to clinicians and corporate
responsibility of CCGs and hospitals for infection management. To
address bacterial species- and resistance-specific aspects in any
locality, analysis (including trend analysis) of data cumulated over
5 years may be needed to avoid problems with small numbers of
some pathogens. Individual hospitals need more local as well as
the existing national data to systematically analyse, explain and
address unsatisfactory outcomes. The already striking increase in
incidence of E. coli bacteraemia, often in patients being admitted
from the community, will probably increase further with better
ascertainment of sepsis. Commissioning attention needs to be
paid to the appropriateness of prior chemotherapy (i.e. for UTIs in
the community) to attempt to reduce such rising incidence and
associated mortality. Owing to the rise of MDR GNB, central moni-
toring of, and action on, informatics is required in all hospitals.
Collation of information is required to explain clinical and resist-
ance outcomes by patient and to plan action in hospital- and com-
munity-onset cases. Early Warning Scores, which are required for
such analysis, are frequently now available on computerized sys-
tems to monitor vital signs. Separate patient-based prescribing
systems record the date of prescription and antibiotics given.
Laboratory data systems record: (i) the date of collection of the
first positive blood culture for an organism-episode from a patient;
and (ii) the organism and its antimicrobial susceptibilities. These
datasets should be linked electronically along with, from hospital
patient administration systems, the admission date, the date of
last hospital discharge and place of residence (i.e. home or residen-
tial care). Early Warning Scores of 6 or more within 3 days of the
bacteraemia indicate a poorer prognosis in bacteraemia, but these
data are collected continuously and may be difficult to link as sin-
gle values. The most difficult area to address is usually the
unequivocal assessment of outcome. Mortality is associated with
poor functional state and comorbidities, which may link to age and
have been assessed automatically from computerized discharge
records of diagnoses (ICDs or diagnosis-related group codes) in the
USA493 and France.494 Defining mortality at a point less than
30days after bacteraemia could tighten linkages to resistance and
inappropriate prescribing, and should be studied. Acute renal injury
is also a useful outcome measure, as is subsequent development
of C. difficile infection within 28days. Sometimes these linkages
can be made expediently without linking systems by exporting
data and linking it in databases or spreadsheets, but the mechan-
ics of this should not be dependent directly and solely on infection
specialists, although they must advise on what should be done.
Quality and commissioning organizations should ensure hospi-
tals are collecting and analysing all such data to explain and
improve their results in the treatment of serious infections such as
bacteraemia, not just those with MDR GNB. Particular scrutiny of
year-on-year improvement in outcome of bacteraemia and reduc-
tion in prevalence according to onset in hospital or the community
is needed both in CCGs and hospitals. Application of enhanced defi-
nitions of place of likely acquisition, together with the Working
Party’s definitions of multiresistance as applied to hospitals and
the community and within the context of the local communities
population make-up, may explain the reasons for, and sometimes
enable multifaceted action on, problematic multiple resistance as
a whole health economy approach. Hospital-, community–health-
care- and community-onset bacteraemia therefore require sepa-
rate analysis.

 Evidence
Key components of an effective antimicrobial stewardship pro-
gramme are consistent effort and audit of outcome by specialists
with full communication and support from electronic prescribing/
laboratory and clinical records. Computerized systems can and
should be integrated. Also required are full accountability of
responsible organizations for occurrence of serious infections and
the outcomes of treating them. Accurate information is required
on serious infections with MDR GNB but must not be assessed in
isolation.
Evidence level: 2!
Hospital or community antibiotic use (by DDDs, or perhaps bet-
ter in the context of resistance selection, number of patients
exposed to each agent) should be reviewed locally together with
antibiotic resistance data. These datasets are available from phar-
macy and microbiology systems respectively. Audit on compliance
with local guidelines can be undertaken, but this provides no assur-
ance on clinical outcome in severe infections; these require com-
parison with performance of other similar institutions and analysis
to ensure the quality of care.
Evidence level: 2!!
Extended surveillance of bacteraemia with appropriate record
linkage both centrally and in the hospital would provide clinical
outcome assurance in the most severe infections and also a
means of comparing improvement in hospitals and communities.
Furthermore, this would lead to a sharp focus on improvements to
antibiotic guidance, usage and infection control

and, if possible, defined time-limited (not admission-limited)

treatment of infection in communities and hospitals.

otic resistance and pattern, date of collection, nursing home
residency, and optionally local records on last hospital dis-
charge before bacteraemia. These data should be made avail-
able, for open interrogation and downloading, with rolling
cumulative data within the health service. They should ensure
mortality rate is categorized by locality (separately for hospitals
and for community with associated separate wider healthcare
data).

11.3 Antibiotic stewardship in the community and care
homes to reduce MDR Gram-negative infections
Several RCTs in UK communities have shown that prescribing has
been
improved
by
multifaceted
interventions
that
included
(i) general practice staff education and (ii) education of the patient
through improving communication during the doctor–patient con-
sultation.495,496 There have also been several Cochrane reviews that
included studies in hospitals, but which should be transferable to
the community and care homes, aiming to improve antibiotic pre-
scribing. In one Cochrane review, restrictive interventions (selective
reporting of laboratory susceptibilities, formulary restriction, and
antibiotic policy change strategies) had a greater effect in the short
term in reducing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics than persuasive
interventions (distribution of educational materials; educational
meetings; local consensus processes; educational outreach visits;
local opinion leaders; reminders provided verbally, on paper or on
computer; audit and feedback). However, both were equally effec-
tive in controlling antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance after
6months.468 In a separate Cochrane review, printed educational
materials alone had an effect on the practice of healthcare profes-
sionals and patient health outcomes.497 Based on seven RCTs and
54 outcomes, the median absolute risk difference in categorical
practice outcomes was 0.02 when printed educational materials
were compared with no intervention (range from 0 to !0.11).497
Other Cochrane reviews show multifaceted interventions are more
effective. Moreover, interventions that are based on cognitive theo-
ries and consider personal attitudes, subjective norms and perceived
behavioural controls (confidence and other barriers) are more likely
to be successful, e.g. posters raise awareness and change subjective
norms but are ineffective when used alone.
In an audit and feedback process, an individual’s professional
practice or performance is measured and then compared with pro-
fessional standards or targets. The results of this comparison are
then fed back to the individual. In general practices this will prob-
ably be via the medicine manager, local GP prescribing champions
or in collaboration with local microbiologists. The aim is to encour-
age the individual to follow professional standards.498 A Cochrane
review considered 82 comparisons from 49 studies of any health-
care interventions in which audit and feedback were core and eval-
uated effects on professional practice.498 There was a median

 4.3% increase in healthcare professionals’ compliance with desired
practice (IQR 0.5%–16%) when: (i) baseline performance was low;
(ii) the source was a supervisor or colleague; (iii) it was provided
more than once; (iv) it was delivered in both verbal and written for-
mats; and (v) when it included both explicit targets and an action
plan. In addition, the effect size varied based on the clinical behav-
iour targeted by the intervention.498 An RCT evaluating a multifac-
eted intervention in English general practice that was aimed at
improving antibiotic prescribing included feedback of practice level
data on antibiotic prescribing and resistance: this led to a 4.2% fall
in total antibiotic use.495 In some parts of the UK, audit with action
plans, and intense infection control measures, have been associ-
ated with falls in quinolone and cephalosporin use and resist-
ance.4,499 Incentives attached to action plans can be very effective
but, without personal attitude changes, the change may reverse
when the incentive is reduced.500 Any audit indicators need to be
well monitored, as implementation of an effective multiple-
intervention strategy achieved no reduction of antibiotic prescrip-
tion rates when deployed at a larger scale in general practice: the
authors attributed the failure to a less tight monitoring of the inter-
vention and audit.501 It is necessary to demonstrate by further
study that such interventions can be effective at practice or hospi-
tal unit/hospital level.
Relevant outcomes, which should be monitored, include mor-
tality from systemic infections such as bacteraemia, hospital
admission, emergency room attendance, requirement for outpa-
tient parenteral antibiotic therapy, re-consultation in person or by
telephone, time-limited re-prescription of antibiotics and microbio-
logical and clinical persistence of infection.

12. Conclusions
The selection of antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused
by GNB has always been difficult. Following the introduction of the
first antibiotics with activity against GNB, such as tetracycline,
chloramphenicol and streptomycin, introduced in the late 1940s,
resistance in E. coli causing UTI was observed at rates of 5%–10%
as early as 1953.502 Subsequently it emerged that Enterobacteria-
ceae can exchange and re-assort antibiotic resistance genes with
great ease via plasmids, transposons, integrons and other mobile,
or potentially mobile, genetic elements. This meant that resistan-
ces to antimicrobials no longer being used were easily and stably
maintained as the relevant resistance genes commonly become
genetically linked. These linked resistances became transferable to
a wider and more versatile range of strains.
As each class of new agent was introduced, so resistance
negated its reliable empirical use for the treatment of serious sep-
sis and also undermined any future reliance on the older agents.
This is exemplified in the UK by the rise of plasmid-mediated TEM
b-lactamase conferring resistance to ampicillin in the 1960s,
aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes conferring gentamicin resist-
ance in the 1970s, extended-spectrum TEM and SHV b-lactamases
conferring cephalosporin resistance in the 1980s and, beginning in
the 1990s, CTX-M ESBLs, DNA gyrase mutations and dihydrofolate
reductases conferring resistance to third-generation cephalospor-
ins, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim, respectively. We are now
facing a similar process with carbapenems and polymyxins.
The bacterial ability to maintain older resistances may under-
mine any benefit from the introduction of more resolute antibiotic
stewardship. Over-reliance on stewardship as the sole strategy for
reducing MDR GNB may not be productive, although reductions in
antibiotic use, if they are substantial enough to reduce selection in
the human microflora for resistant strains, are welcome. Use of a
diversity of agents focused on proven bacterial infection may be
more important than restricting478 entirely the use of certain anti-
biotics and classes. Empirical prescribing based on generic clinical
diagnoses will also need to be safely reduced.
Because of widely differing usage of antibiotics active against
GNB in both medicine and agriculture in different parts of the globe
since the 1980s, we have created widely differing rates of occur-
rence of MDR GNB in these different locations and in some cases
between food animals and man. Furthermore, the increasing rec-
ognition of reservoirs of pathogenic E. coli and Klebsiella spp. in dif-
ferent animal species suggests that animal husbandry quality and
control of these strains may be variable. Higher rates of MDR GNB
pose therapeutic problems for these countries. In addition, over
the last decade the movement of people, goods and food has
resulted in countries such as the UK meeting unpredictable and
alarming appearances of MDR GNB by importation.49 Imported
food-producing animals from overseas founder stock, and food-
stuffs, need to be free of important antibiotic resistance in GNB to
just as great an extent as returned travellers for biosecurity and as
a foundation for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship.
In order to produce relevant guidelines for the empirical treat-
ment of infections caused by MDR GNB, an understanding of the

 local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns is essential. The
unpredictability of horizontal gene transfer and nosocomial spread
may necessitate specific guidelines being produced for individual
hospitals/communities. The present guideline has attempted to
assess the relative clinical efficacy of different agents. We have
found very few good-quality clinical trials to support treatment
regimens, particularly for licensed older agents, formerly little
used, that have been re-introduced into regular use. Finding a
mechanism to address this deficit in trials much more rapidly is an
important overarching research objective as the existing pattern of
industry-sponsored initial regulatory trials fails to address the
need.
It is self-evident that selection of antibiotic treatment based on
susceptibility testing is the optimum strategy for treating infections
caused by MDR GNB. The initiative to develop and deploy molecular
and rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing methods will help refine
antibiotic usage. Any additional expense must be funded within
the healthcare system for these to be introduced. Risk factor, rule-
based prescribing for MDR GNB is unlikely to be sufficiently predic-
tive alone for the reasons outlined above but risk assessment of
travel, household spread, and screening on admission to hospitals
needs urgent improvement. However, we have attempted to
present an evidence base and suggestions to support the develop-
ment of local prescribing policies and possibly for the future appli-
cation of such technologies and overall improvement in outcomes.
Over-reliance on empirical piperacillin/tazobactam and, for
treatment failure, meropenem has driven and will drive selection
for resistance to these agents, and UK health policy is attempting
to contain this upsurge in usage. For patients presenting with seri-
ous sepsis convincingly caused by GNB and in the absence of prior
exposure to healthcare in countries/hospitals with endemic CPE,
carbapenems remain the best empirical therapy, with early and
embedded shift to alternative definitive treatment. The overall
prevalence of resistance in E. coli alone to piperacillin/tazobactam
or gentamicin (approximately 10%) is the basis for this superiority
of carbapenems, although factors such as aminoglycoside toxicity
and C. difficile risk must be considered. Combinations of these
agents or cephalosporins without b-lactamase inhibitors increase
antibiotic use and are unlikely to produce adequate activity against
ESBLs because of resistance linkage. Algorithms for predicting
accurately the presence of ESBLs need urgent validation in the UK
health service so piperacillin/tazobactam or gentamicin can be
safely used to provide Gram-negative cover in their absence, and
cephalosporin/BLI combinations in their presence thus diversify
antibiotic use in serious infections within a stewardship framework.
Use of piperacillin/tazobactam or existing licensed aminoglyco-
sides as empirical therapy where ESBL-producing strains are
prevalent, such as after overseas travel or hospitalization, in com-
munities where such travel has been frequent, and with hospital or
nursing home exposure, is unwise. Historical evidence suggests
these agents continue to be appropriate for sepsis if these risk fac-
tors are not implicated.
In England, use of the Commissioning for Quality and
Innovation (CQUIN) payments framework (or public health control
of institutions and community healthcare) needs to be sensitive to
the requirement to have safe effective antibiotics to use in sepsis
caused by non-MDR GNB, which remain the majority of GNB caus-
ing serious infections in UK hospitals. The role and utility of the lat-
est generation of BL/BLI combinations is yet to fully emerge. The
early reports of emergence of resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam
in KPC-3-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is
ominous.503 Nevertheless, at the moment new BL/BLIs and fosfo-
mycin offer the only immediate new help to treat the latest MDR
GNB,
particularly
for
carbapenemase
producers
and
ESBL-
producing GNB. Further development of BLI combinations for oral
use is an urgent need in primary care.
Initiatives are being put in place to address the paucity of new
agents but it will take time for these agents to be produced and
their success is by no means inevitable. A greater emphasis in com-
munities should be given to the better use of existing treatments
for effective treatment of complicated and upper UTI with preven-
tion of bacteraemia, and in hospitals to an auditable improved out-
come in well-defined groups of patients with life-threatening
Gram-negative infections such as bacteraemia. This effort should
match the attention given to reducing inappropriate use of wide-
spectrum agents for less important infections and should ensure
that reductions in antibiotic use are appropriate and do not
adversely affect patients. Computerized support to spare infection
professional time is necessary locally for surveillance of bacterae-
mia to focus attention on improvements in performance in life-
threatening infection.
Greater research and deployment efforts in the area of very
rapid diagnostics to guide immediate prescribing are needed. In
the healthcare environment, stopping spread of infection with
MDR GNBs is of paramount importance and such infection control
measures have been dealt with comprehensively in another
Working Party publication.3
The greatest long-term threat arises from the fundamental epi-
demiology of GNB, with their large faecal reservoirs in both
humans and food animals leading to dissemination into the envi-
ronment.21 This leads to unpredictable acquisition by individuals,
with high rates of commensal carriage and subsequent infection.
Not only antibiotic control in man but parallel control of use of the
same agents in food animals is important. This is exemplified by
use of colistin, mequindox and fosfomycin504 in food animals in
China and other parts of the world, and consequent emergence of
plasmid-mediated colistin, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin resist-
ance mediated by mcr-1, oqxAB and modified nitroreductases,
and fosA as discussed previously (see Section 6.3.4). The close
association of NDM MBL with connections with the Indian subcon-
tinent is likely to change with the demonstration of this carbapene-
mase in poultry, farm workers, flies and wild birds in Shandong,
China.289 Practical measures to contain human importations of
carbapenemases but also assessment and potentially prevention
of any spread in foodstuffs are urgent at this early stage.
Variations in the prevalence of MDR GNB in different localities and
cultural backgrounds even within the UK need to be further
explored and considered in empirical therapy. Separate effects of
migration, travel, household cross-colonization/infection and food
consumption need to be rapidly studied to make risk assessments
practical and effective.
Internationally, public health hygiene measures to reduce
faecal–oral transmission, such as clean water initiatives and sewer-
age and irrigation systems to prevent transmission, are of major
importance. Foodstuffs, including imports, should be regulated for
the presence of GNB resistant to third-generation cephalosporins,
quinolones and possibly in the future carbapenems. Failure to
address these under-recognized threats will undo our ability to treat

 infections caused by MDR GNB. If we do not control human and agri-
cultural use of antibiotics and the spread of MDR GNB from faeces
back into humans and food animals as a consistent multifaceted,
global-scale public-health programme we will suffer greatly.
13. Further research and development
Apart from research needed for new compounds and formulations
in the antibiotic pipeline, there are numerous areas which require
research with a 5 year horizon for completion.
• Diagnostic tests and/or serum markers should be formally and
comprehensively assessed for safety and efficacy as aids in
deciding when to start and stop antimicrobial treatment, par-
ticularly in critically ill patients and those with haematological
malignancies.
• Develop and introduce new cheap, rapid, and preferably bed-
side, diagnostic tests for important multiple antibiotic-resistant
organisms in urine and blood.
• Undertake RCT studies of antimicrobial agents (both new and
old) in the treatment of Gram-negative infection in areas where
multiresistance is likely, e.g. admissions units, critical care and
urology in hospitals and in treatment of infections due to ESBL-
producing bacteria in the community. Identified research areas
in this guideline include:
(i) Use of continuous-infusion meropenem at dose determined
by nomogram if infection with KPC carbapenemase-produc-
ing Klebsiella with MIC of .8 and ,64mg/L.
(ii) Use of temocillin for non-urinary infections with trials to
establish the optimal dosage.
(iii) Use of temocillin alone, or in combination, in UTIs caused by
Enterobacteriaceae with KPC enzyme.
(iv) Use of ceftazidime/avibactam alone when non-MBL carba-
penemase-producing organisms cause infection in compari-
son with alternatives, including combination therapy.
(v) Use of ceftolozane/tazobactam in P. aeruginosa infections in
cystic fibrosis.
(vi) In vitro and in vivo research to identify the usefulness of
aztreonam in combination with avibactam for infections
due to Enterobacteriaceae with MBLs and other
carbapenemases.
(vii) Research into the role of loading doses of colistin, monitor-
ing of serum levels and optimal combination therapy.
(viii) Research into use of polymyxin-containing and non-
containing selective digestive decontamination regimens
and the prevalence of newly identified polymyxin resistance
mechanisms.
(ix) Optimal rapid and practical methods of colistin susceptibility
testing outside intrinsically resistant species such as
Proteeae and Serratia spp.
(x) Higher dosing studies with tigecycline to investigate if the
unexpectedly high mortality in infections with strains that
are apparently susceptible in vitro can be reduced.
(xi) Optimal use of high-dose tigecycline in combinations in
hospital-acquired respiratory infections.
(xii) Specific system-based and resistance-mechanism-based
indications for use of parenteral fosfomycin, in infections
due to MDR GNB.
(xiii) Cefixime (or other oral cephalosporin) with clavulanate
(alone or with amoxicillin) against ESBL-producing E. coli
UTI.
(xiv) Nitrofurantoin versus fosfomycin trometamol versus pivme-
cillinam (with or without amoxicillin/clavulanate) in patients
with ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp.
(xv) Use of meropenem, temocillin or ceftolozane/tazobactam
in community-onset pyelonephritis where hospitalization is
required and where MDR GNB excluding CPE are, or are likely
to be, present. These studies should include assessment of
meropenem or aminoglycosides if the patient describes
penicillin hypersensitivity.
• Undertake surveillance in both the hospital and community
populations, and households of newly detected colonized indi-
viduals, for incidence of known mechanisms of resistance and
the emergence of novel resistance mechanisms to currently
used antimicrobials. Link this surveillance to travel, prior hospi-
talization as inpatient, or residential healthcare.
• Develop new models of licensing and funding of antimicrobials
for treating MDR GNB infections. Develop non-microbial thera-
pies for MRGNB (e.g. phage, antibacterial peptides, etc.)
