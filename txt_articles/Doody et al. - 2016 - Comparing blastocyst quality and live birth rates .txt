Abstract
Purpose The purpose of this study is to to compare the effi-
cacy of intravaginal culture (IVC) of embryos in INVOcell™
(INVO Bioscience, MA, USA) to traditional in vitro fertiliza-
tion (IVF) incubators in a laboratory setting using a mild pre-
determined stimulation regimen based solely on anti-
mullerian hormone (AMH) and body weight with minimal
ultrasound monitoring. The primary endpoint examined was
total quality blastocysts expressed as a percentage of total
oocytes placed in incubation. Secondary endpoints included
percentage of quality blastocysts transferred, pregnancy, and
live birth rates.
Methods In this prospective randomized open-label con-
trolled single-center study, 40 women aged <38 years of age
with a body mass index (BMI) of <36 and an AMH of
1–3 ng/mL were randomized prior to trigger to receive either
IVC or IVF. Controlled ovarian stimulation was administered
with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) in a fixed
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist cycle
based solely on AMH and body weight. A single
ultrasound-monitoring visit was performed on the 10th day
of stimulation. One or two embryos were transferred follow-
ing 5 days of culture.
Results IVF produced a greater percentage of total quality
embryos as compared to IVC (50.6 vs. 30.7 %, p=0.0007,
respectively). There was no significant difference between in
IVF and IVC in the percentage of quality blastocysts trans-
ferred (97.5 vs. 84.9 %, p=0.09) or live birth rate (60 % IVF,
55 % IVC).
Conclusions IVF was shown to be superior to IVC in creating
quality blastocysts. However, both IVF and IVC produced
identical blastocysts for transfer resulting in similar live birth
rates. IVC using INVOcell™ is effective and may broaden
access to fertility care in selected patient populations by ame-
liorating the need for a traditional IVF laboratory setting.
Further studies will help elucidate the potential physiological,
psychological, geographic, and financial impact of IVC on the
delivery of fertility care.

Introduction
The process of in vitro fertilization (IVF) where oocytes and
sperm are incubated in a laboratory setting is necessary to
achieve pregnancy for many patients with infertility.
Unfortunately, the expense and overall burden of IVF signif-
icantly restricts access to assisted reproductive technologies
(ART) [1]. The modern IVF laboratory requires expensive
air filtration systems [2], as the embryo has no lung, kidney,
or liver to filter air contaminants including volatile organic
compounds. Incubators require alarm systems, daily quality
control checks, and 24/7 monitoring. In addition, if
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or similar microma-
nipulation is offered, highly trained embryologists with
Capsule IVF was superior to IVC in generating quality blastocysts.
However, IVF and IVC produced equivalent blastocysts for transfer and
similar live birth rates.

 specialized skills enabling those procedures must be available.
As a result, access to fertility programs offering IVF is gener-
ally restricted from a geographic perspective to large urban
centers and from a financial perspective to those who can
afford this treatment.
Intravaginal culture (IVC) was proposed nearly 30 years
ago as a means to reduce the overall burden and increase
access to reproductive care [3]. The IVC technique places
oocytes and sperm into a gas permeable culture device
(INVOcell™, INVO Bioscience, MA, USA), which is then
inserted in the vaginal cavity for incubation allowing fertiliza-
tion and embryo development to occur [4].
IVC therefore has the potential to remove the need for a
sophisticated and costly IVF laboratory as well as reducing
overall embryologist intervention. The associated reduced
capital costs and operating expenses may improve affordabil-
ity and access to ART services.
Two prospective non-randomized studies and one ran-
domized investigation have examined the efficacy of
IVC using INVOcell™ which augmented early studies
utilizing prototype devices [5–9]. Lucena and colleagues
employing a mild stimulation protocol found that in
125 cycles, IVC yielded a cleavage rate of 63 % and
an ongoing pregnancy rate of 40 % [10]. The second
prospective non-randomized study found that IVC/ICSI
produced a cleavage rate of 79 % and a live birth rate
of 53 %. This was found similar to an internal matched
IVF/ICSI control group of 74 cycles, which generated a
cleavage rate of 76 % and a live birth rate 58 % [11].
The third study examined sister oocytes from 10 women
who were randomized to receive either IVC or IVF.
Cleavage rates were found to be similar for both IVC
(97 %) and IVF (93 %); however, IVC yielded a signif-
icantly lower total number of embryos suitable for trans-
fer. The study was limited in that only IVC embryos
were transferred and thus comparative pregnancy rates
were not possible. The investigators found IVC produced
a 30% clinical pregnancy rate [12].
The effectiveness of IVC to reduce the burden of fer-
tility care can only be determined once its efficacy is
compared directly to the traditional incubators used in
IVF in a randomized controlled fashion. This randomized
prospective open-label trial is the first to compare the
blastocyst quality and resultant live birth rates of IVC to
IVF. The primary endpoint examined was the total num-
ber of day 5 embryos of “good quality” defined as 2BB or
greater (expansion of embryos 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 and inner
cell mass and trophectoderm grades of A or B) or higher
using a modified Gardner Grading System [13] expressed
as a percentage of total number of oocytes placed in in-
cubation. Secondary endpoints were also examined and
included percentage of quality embryos transferred and
live birth rates.
Methods
Study setting
The study was carried out at C.A.R.E., Bedford, TX, USA.
The study was a prospective randomized open-label trial.
Ethics approval was obtained from an external Research
Ethics Board (IRB Services, www.irbservices.com).
Study population
From November 2012 until December 2013, a total of 40
infertile couples were enrolled into the study. Women present-
ing to the clinic between the ages of 18 and 38 years, who had
failed to conceive after 1 year of unprotected intercourse, had
a normal recent uterine cavity evaluation, and in which IVF
was to be the next treatment, were invited to participate in the
study. Male partners were required to have normal or only
mildly abnormal semen parameters or better. Couples with a
severely abnormal semen analysis (less than five million pro-
gressively motile sperm in the ejaculate) were excluded.
Exclusion criteria included chronic illness, vaginal inflamma-
tion, infection, uterine anatomic abnormalities, or allergy to
plastics. Other exclusion factors included severe endometri-
osis, untreated hydrosalpinx, BMI greater than or equal to 36,
use of donor sperm or eggs, low ovarian reserve
(AMH<1 ng/ml), polycystic ovaries, prior history of ovarian
hyperstimulation, inability to wear a diaphragm, smokers,
drug or alcohol abuse, and two or more failed previous IVF
cycles or an IVF cycle with where fertilization did not occur.
Stimulation and monitoring
Oral contraceptives were used to program the cycle and over-
lapped with leuprolide acetate 1 mg/day. Leuprolide acetate
was continued for 7–14 days and then decreased to 0.5 mg/
day prior to stimulation. Sonogram was used to confirm ab-
sence of follicular cysts prior to starting leuprolide and prior to
initiation of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). hMG
(Ferring, NJ, USA) was used at a starting dose of 150 or
225 IU per day beginning on a Saturday such that monitoring,
egg retrieval, and embryo transfer on weekends could be pre-
dictably avoided. The gonadotropin dose was either main-
tained or “stepped down” to 150 IU after one or more days,
taking into account the AMH and body weight. A single
sonogram-monitoring visit performed on the 10th day of stim-
ulation. By study design, hCG trigger was limited to only
three possible days. The decision to trigger on stimulation
days 10, 11, or 12 (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday) was
based on measurements of follicle size on day 10. Egg retriev-
al (scheduled for a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday) was per-
formed 36 h following trigger.

 Patient randomization
Patients were randomized on day 10 following their sonogram
to receive either IVC or IVF with a single or double embryo
transfer on day 5. Randomization was done through lottery
system where 20 IVF and 20 IVC cards were placed in an
opaque envelope and a single card was drawn by the clinical
nurse coordinator for each patient. Forty-four patients were
enrolled and four patients declined to move forward for person-
al reasons during the consenting process. The remaining 40
patients, 20 in each arm represented complete enrollment as
per study protocol, and all 40 completed the study. Because
randomization was done following the day 10 sonogram, prior
to retrieval, neither the physician nor embryologist was blinded
with regard to oocyte assessment and blastocyst scoring.
Oocyte culture
Up to 10 oocytes (as per the Instructions For Use included with
the device) were co-incubated with sperm for 2 to 4 hours.
These oocytes were then cultured in traditional tri-gas incuba-
tors or the vaginal culture device INVOcell™ (INVO
Bioscience, MA, USA) for 5 days in continuous culture media
and serum substitute supplement (both Irvine Scientific, Santa
Ana, CA, USA) and in the case of IVC culture 0.3-mL oil for
embryo culture (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA, USA). If
more than 10 oocytes were obtained, the extra oocytes were
vitrified or discarded. The study protocol was designed to min-
imize the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
such that all embryos would be vitrified and embryo transfer
would be deferred if more than 20 oocytes were obtained.
Embryo transfer
After 5 days of continuous culture, the embryos were removed
from the INVOcell™ or traditional incubators and carefully
identified and scored according to the Gardner Scoring
System. One or two selected embryos were loaded and trans-
ferred into the uterus using a standard embryo transfer catheter
and ultrasound guidance. The decision to transfer either one or
two embryos was made by the patient after consideration of
patient age, embryo quality, and the availability of additional
embryos for cryopreservation in accordance with the guide-
lines published by the American Society of Reproductive
Medicine [14]. Multiple embryologists were utilized for both
IVF and IVC cycles, and care was taken to ensure concordant
scoring via ongoing internal quality control measures.
Pregnancy assessment
All patients were monitored for chemical pregnancy nine or
more days after embryo transfer and sonographically assessed
after 6 weeks gestation for fetal heart. Patients were contacted
following 9 months gestation to collect the live birth data.
Outcome measures and statistical analysis
The primary endpoint was total quality blastocysts expressed as
percentage of oocytes incubated. Secondary outcome measures
included percentage of quality embryos transferred as well as
pregnancy and live birth rates. Statistical analysis was performed
using Z test 2 population proportions (comparative embryo data)
and Student’s t test (comparative patient data, with the exception
of embryos transferred which was not normally distributed and
so a Mann-Whitney U test was deployed). P<0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. The sample size of total blastocysts
required per treatment group was calculated to be 84 assuming
an error rate of 0.05%, a power of 0.90, and an effect size of 0.5.
Results
Forty (40) stimulation cycles were performed, and a total of
314 oocytes were collected. One hundred percent of cycles
yielded 1 or more oocyte, and all cycles went to retrieval.
One hundred and twenty seven (127) oocytes were placed in
the vaginal culture device INVOcell™, and 156 oocytes were
incubated in a traditional IVF culture system. Eighty-seven
(87) of the 127 vaginally cultured oocytes (69%) were noted
to have developed beyond the one cell stage. In contrast, the
oocytes cultured in the conventional incubators had an 88%
cleavage rate, producing 115 embryos from 131 oocytes.

 Additional comparative patient, oocyte, and embryo data is
presented in Table 1.
Thirty-nine (39) embryos generated from the 127 vaginally
cultured oocytes (31%) were graded greater than or equal to
2BB based on the Gardner Scoring System. In contrast, 79 of
the 156 (51%) IVF cultured embryos were graded greater than
or equal to 2BB (Fig. 1). The difference between IVC and IVF
was found to be statistically significant (p=0.0007).
When examining those embryos that were transferred,
however, the statistically significant difference was not ob-
served between IVC and IVF embryos with 87.9 and 97.2 %
scoring greater than or equal to 2BB, respectively (p=0.09,
Fig. 2). Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of embryos’ grades
across both IVC and IVF. Only IVC generated the highest
graded 6AA embryos in 2 cycles. In grades 4 and 3, IVF
produced greater numbers of embryos relative to IVC.
All 40 cycles went to embryo transfer with either a single or
double embryo transfer performed. All cycles were assessed to
a minimum of fetal heart confirmation on week 6 by sonogram.
The 20 IVC cycles produced 14 biochemical pregnancies, 13
clinical pregnancies, and 11 pregnancies resulting in live
birth(s). A total of 16 live born infants (5 sets of twins) were
observed with an average birth weight of 5.84 lb. Similarly, the
20 IVF cycles produced 14 biochemical pregnancies, 13 clini-
cal pregnancies, and 12 pregnancies resulting in live birth(s). A
total of 15 live born infants (3 sets of twins) were observed with
an average birth weight of 5.94 lb. Comparative pregnancy
rates between IVC and IVF are presented in Fig. 4.
No cycle produced more than 18 oocytes. Thus, no cycle
required “freeze-all” to reduce the risk of OHSS. Similarly, no
patient experienced significant OHSS symptoms requiring ad-
ditional office visits or intervention. Additionally, no patients
reported losing INVOcell™ from the vaginal cavity. The most
common reported adverse events captured in a post cycle
questionnaire which was administered to the couples in the
IVC arm were vaginal discharge (45 %), discomfort related to
the device (15 %), device becoming dislodged requiring repo-
sitioning (15 %), itching (15 %), and spotting (10%).

 degree been consolidated into substantial facilities in large
urban centers providing ever increasingly costly IVF- and
IVF-related procedures [15]. To reduce the burden of care
ideally all three barriers: time, geographical constraints, and
cost are adequately addressed. Recently, a simplified culture
system was proposed which sought to reduce the cost of IVF
by replacing a full laboratory with a so-called shoebox-sized
environment. In validating the simplified approach, Van
Blerkom and colleagues reported an implantation rate of
35 % and seven healthy live births [16]. Another simplified
form of IVF, which also sought to replace the complex IVF
laboratory, has been proposed which uses intravaginal culture
(IVC) [4]. Specifically, a gas permeable medical device
(INVOcell™, INVO Bioscience, MA, USA) containing cul-
ture media with spermatozoa and oocytes and placed in the
vaginal cavity acts as the necessary pCO2/pO2 incubator [17],
supplying the environment and temperature to facilitate fertil-
ization and early embryo development. IVC procedures have
been performed in a number of countries with pregnancy rates
ranging from 20 to 59 % [3, 13, 15–18].
Despite the increasing adoption of IVC as a complementa-
ry approach to IVF, to date an adequate comparison to IVF has
not yet been performed. The study presented here is the first to
compare IVC to IVF in a randomized fashion and demon-
strates that IVF is superior to IVC in generating day 5 embryos
of quality greater than or equal to 2BB as per the Gardner
Scoring System (50.6 vs. 30.7 %, p=0.0007, respectively).
However, when considering the quality of the embryos trans-
ferred, IVF and IVC had similar percentages of embryos grad-
ed 2BB or greater (97.2 and 87.9 %, respectively), resulting in
near identical live birth rates (60 % for IVF and 55 % for IVC).
Utilizing the vaginal cavity to maintain temperature and
provide the appropriate low oxygen and high CO2 environ-
ment has clear advantages in terms of reducing both the geo-
graphic restriction and cost as it ameliorates the need to build
and maintain a full IVF laboratory significantly reducing the
size and thus cost of a facility providing IVF services. Further
optimal embryo development has been shown to be influ-
enced by even minor changes in environmental conditions
such as pH, temperature, and oxygen concentration [19].
IVC has the advantage of eliminating potential fluctuations
in those parameters as the frequent assessments of embryo
development have been shown to negatively affect embryo
development [18]. While IVC does not allow monitoring or
adjustments to either O2 or CO2 concentrations, it has been
shown to maintain levels of relatively high CO2 levels and low
pH by equilibration of the culture medium with intraepithelial
vaginal gas even in metabolically active medium containing
sperm and oocytes [20].
Artificial environments, which seek to mimic the in vivo
environment, have been shown to improve embryo develop-
ment [21]. IVC allows developing embryos to be exposed to
these natural rhythms, which may positively enhance embryo
development. It is important to note that this potential benefit
needs to be balanced with an inability of the IVC process to
allow the assessment of early fertilization development. It is
interesting that only IVC, in two cycles, generated the highest
quality 6AA embryo on day 5. Further utilization of IVC and
refinement of protocols will aid in determining if natural body
rhythms and associated microfluidic environment of IVC is
potentially a superior incubating system to traditional IVF
systems.
This study suggests that IVC using INVOcell™ is a viable
alternative option for assisted reproduction. Additional studies
validating IVC as a treatment option for infertile patients are
required to fully elucidate the ideal patient profile and gain a
better understanding of the cumulative pregnancy rate of IVC
as compared to IVF as significant differences were noted be-
tween total quality embryos generated.
