through lymphatic vessels and is reduced in aged

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been commonly accepted to drain through arachnoid projec-
tions from the subarachnoid space to the dural venous sinuses. However, a lymphatic
component to CSF outflow has long been known. Here, we utilize lymphatic-reporter mice
and high-resolution stereomicroscopy to characterize the anatomical routes and dynamics of
outflow of CSF. After infusion into a lateral ventricle, tracers spread into the paravascular
spaces of the pia mater and cortex of the brain. Tracers also rapidly reach lymph nodes using
perineural routes through foramina in the skull. Using noninvasive imaging techniques that
can quantify the transport of tracers to the blood and lymph nodes, we find that lymphatic
vessels are the major outflow pathway for both large and small molecular tracers in mice. A
significant decline in CSF lymphatic outflow is found in aged compared to young mice,
suggesting that the lymphatic system may represent a target for age-associated neurological
conditions.

erebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered to be produced
primarily by the choroid plexus and to flow through the
ventricular system to reach the subarachnoid space (SAS)
of the skull and spinal column1. An additional source of CSF is
the interstitial fluid (ISF) from the brain tissue that is produced at
the blood–brain barrier and may account for around 10% of the
total volume of CSF2. Three layers of meninges surround the
central nervous system (CNS), the pia mater that covers the brain
and spinal cord parenchyma, and the arachnoid and dura mater
layers, which line the skull and vertebral canal. The CSF flows
through the SAS between the pia mater, which is semi-permeable,
and the arachnoid, which forms a tight barrier to prevent flow
into the dura mater3,4. Within the CNS itself, lymphatic vessels
are believed to be absent, instead a system of paravascular spaces
(historically known as Virchow–Robin spaces but recently
described as part of the “glymphatic system”) is thought to pro-
vide channels for the movement of fluid and solutes from the
brain interstitial space and to the CSF and vice versa5.
Based upon work in the early part of the twentieth century, the
predominant outflow of CSF from the SAS is accepted to take
place through arachnoid villi or granulations that project into the
dural venous sinuses1,6,7. These structures are described as a
series of tubules within an outgrowth of arachnoid tissue that are
continuous with the CSF of the SAS of the cranium and the
spine8,9. They were initially believed to act as one-way valves for a
pressure-driven flow from CSF to venous blood10; however, evi-
dence from electron microscopy later indicated the presence of an
intact barrier of endothelial cells8,11. Extensive research has not
led to a consensus on the exact mechanism for flow through
arachnoid villi and granulations and, despite their widespread
acceptance as major outflow sites of CSF, direct in vivo physio-
logical evidence of their function is lacking12–14.
Since an original report by Schwalbe in 1869, a large body of
work in many different species has indicated a role for lymphatic
vessels draining CSF in both cranial and spinal regions15–17.
Attempts to quantify the proportion of CSF drained by the
lymphatic system using cannulation of deep cervical lymphatic
vessels and radiolabeled tracers have indicated that, in some
species such as rabbit and sheep, lymphatic vessels were
responsible for around 30–50% of total outflow, with the
remainder assumed to be drained through arachnoid villi18,19.
The outflow pathways were defined using tracers to be within
sheaths around cranial nerves, with the cribriform plate route
along olfactory nerves that extends to lymphatic vessels in the
nasal mucosa deemed especially important17,20,21. These sheaths
enclose extensions of the SAS that project extracranially with the
nerves through foramina of the skull. At these locations, it was
suggested that there are pathways for tracers to penetrate the
arachnoid membrane to reach interstitial spaces20,22–25 or pos-
sibly directly to lymphatic vessels outside the skull21,26,27. Addi-
tional outflow pathways were found to be present around spinal
nerve roots to reach lymphatic vessels in epidural tissue28,29. Two
recent reports in mice have indicated that the dura mater of the
CNS is endowed with a network of lymphatic vessels capable of
draining CSF or brain ISF30,31. However, this potential route for
drainage of CSF is controversial in light of the existence of the
arachnoid barrier layer between the SAS and the dura mater4.
Thus, the current paradigm suggests a dual-outflow system for
CSF to reach the blood circulation, one directly to venous blood
through arachnoid projections and one indirectly through the
lymphatic system7. At this point, however, there is a lack of
consensus on what the relative contribution for each of these
outflow pathways is to total outflow of CSF. It is also not clear
which pathways to reach the lymphatic system are most impor-
tant. These are key questions as a functioning lymphatic vascular
system draining CSF and brain ISF could be essential for many
aspects of neurology including immune function and clearance of
toxic proteins such as amyloid beta. As many neurological con-
ditions are associated with the aging process, it is also critical to
determine if lymphatic outflow of CSF is altered in aged
conditions.
We have recently developed near-infrared (NIR) tracers that in
conjunction with lymphatic vessel reporter mice, allow high-
resolution imaging and quantification of the anatomy and func-
tion of lymphatic vessels32,33. These bright pegylated NIR dyes
avoid many of the complications of other tracers, such as direct
blood vessel uptake, adherence to tissue components, or phago-
cytosis by macrophages, allowing quantification of lymphatic flow

 from the interstitial tissue of many different organs34,35. In this
study, we first aim to use these tracers to define the major flow
routes of CSF after infusion into a lateral ventricle in mice. Next,
we use a recently developed tracer transport to blood assay to
evaluate the dynamics of CSF outflow to the systemic circulation
in comparison to visualization of outflow to collecting veins or
lymphatic vessels in an attempt to shed light on the relative
contribution of each pathway to total CSF outflow.
We find that the major outflow pathway from CSF for both
large and small molecular tracers in mice is through perineural
routes to reach the lymphatic system. Furthermore, we demon-
strate significantly slower dynamics of CSF outflow in aged 18-
month-old mice compared to young 2-month-old controls. Our
findings implicate that the lymphatic system has a greater than
previously acknowledged role in many neurological conditions.
Results
Characterization of CSF flow routes within the cranium. As
CSF is considered to be produced primarily by the choroid
plexuses that line the ventricular system, we aimed to detail the
flow of the tracer after intraventricular infusions of 40 kDa sized
poly(ethylene) glycol IRDye680 (P40D680), a pegylated NIR
tracer32. Using a stereotactic injector, 2.5 μL of 200 μM P40D680
was delivered to the right lateral ventricle over the course of
2.5 min in Prox1-GFP mice, a reporter line for lymphatic vas-
culature (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). A quality check of the ven-
tricle
infusion
was
performed
after
completion
of
each
experiment by fluorescence imaging of serial 100 μm sections of
the brain under a stereomicroscope (Supplementary Fig. 1d–g). A
successful ventricular infusion showed a remnant of tracer from
the needle penetration through the cortex with no tracer
remaining within or lining the ventricles. Mice with a tracer depot
present in brain parenchymal tissue were assumed to be mis-
injected and were excluded from further analysis.
In initial experiments, we euthanized groups of mice after 10,
30, and 60 min (n = 5 each) to determine the pattern of spread of
P40D680. As early as 10 min after the infusion, we observed that
a portion of the intraventricularly infused tracer appeared to
localize along the paravascular spaces of arteries within the SAS at
the circle of Willis at the base of the brain with spreading within
this space along the middle cerebral artery and its branches over
the convexities of the cortical hemispheres (Fig. 1a–c). With
increasing time, the filling of the paravascular spaces became
more extensive with almost complete coverage of the blood
vessels, both arteries and veins, apparent at 1 h after infusion
(Fig.
1d–g).
There
was
also
entry
of
tracer
into
the
Virchow–Robin spaces around penetrating arteries (Fig. 1h),
similar to the “glymphatic flow” described by Iliff et al.5
Lymphatic routes of CSF from the cranial cavity. After eutha-
nizing mice at 10, 30, and 60 min after infusion, we assessed the
dynamics of the P40D680 signal within the deep cervical and
mandibular lymph nodes of the neck. Deep cervical nodes already
had signal at 10 min after the completion of the infusion, as
shown in representative images of the left cervical nodes at this
time point in Fig. 2a. The signals steadily increased with time,
with significantly more tracer found in the nodes at 60 min when
compared to 10 min (25,916 ± 10,741 vs. 7723 ± 3333 counts, p <
0.05; one-way ANOVA, Fig. 2b). Although the mandibular lymph
nodes had slightly delayed dynamics, all mice had tracer within
the nodes at 30 min after infusion (Fig. 2c). A significantly
increased amount of tracer was found at 60 min compared to
10 min after infusion (28,544 ± 11,942 vs. 2382 ± 1214 counts, p
< 0.01; one-way ANOVA, Fig. 2d). These findings suggest that
lymphatic outflow from the CSF is rapid and sustained during the
time points examined.
We next aimed to characterize the lymphatic outflow routes
from the murine skull. As perineural outflow pathways have been
described in other species, we looked for P40D680 tracer near
cranial nerve exit routes from the skull at 60 min after
intraventricular infusion in Prox1-GFP mice14,16. Examination
of the base of the skull demonstrated accumulation of the tracer
around the optic and trigeminal nerves (CN II and V) as they exit
the skull (Fig. 3a, c). Tracer was also apparent at the cribriform

 plate that separates the cranial and nasal cavities, indicating that
outflow had also occurred along the olfactory nerves (CN I).
Removal of the skin around the eye allowed visualization of a
dense plexus of tracer-filled lymphatic vessels exiting the orbit
that coalesced into one collecting vessel coursing along the
anterior facial vein towards the mandibular lymph nodes (Fig. 3b,
d). There were often vessels that joined into or ran along this
collecting vessel that originated from the nasal region. By
extraction of the lower jaw and removal of the tongue, esophagus,
and trachea, we were able to observe bright signal in the nasal
cavity through the palate and tracer emanating from a plexus of
lymphatic vessels on the pharynx, which tracked towards the deep
cervical lymph nodes (Fig. 4a, d). We exposed the deep cervical
region and observed tracer-filled lymphatic vessels stemming
from the jugular foramen on the medial side of the tympanic
bulla close to where the glossopharyngeal (CN IX), vagus (CN X),
and accessory (CN XI) nerves emerge (Fig. 4b, d). These vessels
then proceeded toward the deep cervical lymph nodes. An
additional location that tracer appeared to flow out of the skull
was found on the lateral side of the tympanic bulla at the
stylomastoid foramen where the facial nerve (CN VII) exits
(Fig. 4c, d). Drainage from this exit point proceeded towards both
mandibular and deep cervical lymph nodes. There was extreme
variability between mice in the collecting vessels in the deep
cervical region (Supplementary Fig. 2), with several afferent
collecting vessels tracking towards up to three deep cervical
lymph nodes on each side. In some cases, it appeared as though
collecting vessels were skipping the deep cervical node and that
there were also connections from the deep cervical region to the
mandibular nodes. A cartoon demonstrating the typical lympha-
tic outflow routes for tracer in the deep cervical region is shown
in Fig. 4d.
As dural lymphatic vessels have been proposed to drain CSF
within the cranial cavity, we also examined the lymphatic vessels
along the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses within the
meninges adhered to the dorsal aspect of the skull30,31. These
vessels were easily identifiable in situ by their Prox1-GFP signals.
At all the examined time points, we were unable to observe any
filling of the P40D680 tracer into these vessels despite the obvious
presence of tracer in the SAS of these regions (Supplementary
Fig. 3a–d). Additional lymphatic vessels were found in proximity
to the optic nerve at the base of the skull. These vessels also did
not
show
obvious
tracer
uptake,
despite
clear
perineural
localization of tracer in the immediate vicinity (Supplementary
Fig. 3e). Indeed, the lymphatic vessels generally had very small
diameters and often formed a discontinuous network (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3f–h).

 approaches18,19,36,37. Our above findings have revealed that the
multiple routes of lymphatic flow and the anatomical variation
between animals indicate that such previous approaches would be
limited. Therefore, we aimed to apply a technique recently
developed in our lab, which allows quantification of lymphatic
transport from an organ by measurement in a peripheral blood
vessel of an interstitially injected tracer35. This approach assumes
that the tracer is lymphatic-specific for the tissue of interest and
that the tracer is not retained in the tissue or within draining
lymph nodes by phagocytosis. The P40D680 tracer that we have
used in the anatomical studies was shown to be highly sensitive
for this assay with a direct linear relationship between the amount
of intravenously infused tracer and saphenous vein signal, and a
detection threshold of ~0.2% of the injected dose in blood

 (Supplementary Fig. 4). We therefore tested whether we could
quantify outflow from the CSF after intraventricular infusion
using this technique.
We infused 2.5 μL of P40D680 into the right lateral ventricle
and after 5 min initiated noninvasive imaging of the saphenous
vein with NIR stereomicroscopy (Fig. 5a). The venous signal
pattern demonstrated an approximate 25 min delay before signal
was seen and a steady increase thereafter (Fig. 5b; Supplementary
Movie 1). This pattern is indicative of lymph outflow as
previously observed in the subcutaneous tissue and the peritoneal
cavity35. Unlike these tissues, however, outflow was robust from
the CSF even under anesthesia, with an estimated 21.6% ± 6.0%
(n = 5 mice) of the infused dose within the bloodstream at 60 min
based on the calibration curve shown in Supplementary Fig. 4a.
If the delay in the initial signal increase in the saphenous vein
was due to lymphatic outflow then functional lymphatic transport
should be apparent at earlier time points. As the mandibular
lymph nodes are located directly under the skin, we speculated
that we would be able to noninvasively visualize these nodes with
NIR imaging similar to a previous report38. As before, we infused
P40D680 into the lateral ventricle and placed the Prox1-GFP
mice under the stereomicroscope with a region of interest on the
shaved neck skin (Fig. 5c). We could easily noninvasively
visualize tracer transport within collecting lymphatic vessels
and into the lymph nodes as early as 11 min after the infusion
(Fig. 5d; Supplementary Movie 2). In n = 5 mice that were imaged
with each protocol, we detected an average initial signal increase
at 15.9 ± 3.4 min (transit time to nodes) in the draining lymph
nodes, which was significantly earlier than the increase at 25.3 ±
2.8 min representing the transit time to blood (Fig. 5e). Active
contractility of the afferent collecting lymphatic vessels of the
mandibular lymph nodes was also observed with contraction
frequencies of 13.88 ± 2.36 per min (Fig. 5f). Although they could
not be visualized in a similar manner noninvasively, the deep
cervical lymphatic trunks were also transporting fluid at early
time points as signal increases were often detected in videos in the
more caudal mandibular nodes before superficial afferent vessels
were observed, demonstrating a functional connection from the
deeper network. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2b above, deep
cervical node signal was apparent in situ in all mice when
euthanized 10 min after the infusion.
The delay in the time for the signal to be apparent in the blood
suggested that there did not appear to be rapid venous uptake of
the tracer, implying that direct routes into the blood may not be
active under these conditions. To provide further evidence for
this, we tested whether we could detect a direct blood outflow of

 the tracer by imaging the posterior facial vein (Supplementary
Fig. 5a). In rodents, the major venous outflow routes for blood
from the brain and the dural sinuses exit the skull through the
postglenoid (or “spurious” jugular) foramina and drain into the
posterior facial veins to reach the external jugular veins, as
opposed to the internal jugular veins which act in this capacity in
larger mammalian species including humans39–41. Infusions into
the lateral ventricle were performed in n = 5 mice and an incision
of the skin on the lateral aspect of the head was made to expose
the posterior facial vein. Imaging was initiated at 10 min after the
completion of the infusion and continued for 20 min. At no point
was tracer apparent within the posterior facial vein (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5b, c; Supplementary Movie 3) until around 25 min after
infusion at which point an increase in signal was detected. The
time point of this signal increase and the overall signal
enhancement at 30 min were directly comparable to the values
detected at the saphenous vein, indicating that a systemic blood
signal increase had occurred. We validated at this point that there
was signal within the saphenous vein as well as within the
lymphatic vessels leading to the mandibular and cervical lymph
nodes (Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). On the basis of our dynamic
imaging data, we conclude that lymph transport was the main
route for tracer movement from the CSF into the systemic
bloodstream rather than direct blood outflow through the
posterior facial vein.
CSF outflow of small molecules through the lymphatic system.
We next determined whether small molecular tracers would
exhibit similar outflow patterns compared to P40D680. Three
fluorescent small molecular tracers with excitation and emission
wavelength properties similar to P40D680 were utilized: Evans
blue (EB), IRDye680CW, and a 3 kDa dextran conjugated to
AlexaFluor680 (3kDa-AF680). Initial experiments were per-
formed to establish comparable doses for intraventricular infu-
sion as well as to test the sensitivity of detection in the saphenous
region. It was observed during these studies that although both
IRDye680CW and 3kDa-AF680 were not retained within the
blood compartment after intravenous injection, they leaked
rapidly in sufficient quantities within the skin above the saphe-
nous vein to be detected with high sensitivity (Supplementary
Fig. 6). In groups of n = 4 mice, we infused 2.5 μL of either 0.6%
EB, 200 μM IRDye680CW, or 1.6 mg/ml 3kDa-AF680 into the
right lateral ventricle and initiated imaging of the saphenous vein.
Surprisingly, we could not detect immediate blood uptake of any
tracer, with the patterns exhibiting delays before signal could be
detected peripherally (Fig. 6a). After euthanization, we confirmed
that lymphatic outflow of the tracers was occurring with similar
routing to lymph nodes as P40D680 (Fig. 6b, c). With the small
molecules, obvious transport through foramina of the cribriform
plate occurred with strong signals in this region (Fig. 6d). There
was also signal apparent around the optic nerves (Fig. 6d) with
outflow from the orbit similar to P40D680 (Fig. 6e). Noticeably,
less EB reached the bloodstream compared to the other two small
molecular tracers. Upon examination of brain sections, EB
appeared to directly enter the parenchyma of the brain through
the ependymal lining of the ventricles (Supplementary Fig. 7a) in
more significant quantities than IRDye680CW and 3kDa-AF680.
Fluorescence imaging indicated more significant accumulation of
EB and IRDye680CW around arteries compared to veins (Sup-
plementary Fig. 7b), rather than the paravascular spreading

 pattern that was observed around both blood vessel types with
P40D680. Both EB and IRDye680CW appeared to bind strongly
to the arteries surrounding the SAS (Supplementary Fig. 7c). On
the other hand, 3kDa-AF680 showed less specific binding to
arteries with distribution of the tracer within regions between
arteries and veins of the pia mater. In summary, the results
indicate that despite evidence of varying degrees of retention of
these small molecular tracers within the CNS, the CSF outflow
routes through lymphatics and the dynamics of transport to
systemic blood were similar to those of a macromolecular tracer.
Reduced lymphatic outflow from CSF in aged mice. The inci-
dence of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias and many
other neurodegenerative diseases increases with age. Recently, a
hypothesis for the development of these disorders was proposed
that toxic proteins such as amyloid beta and tau may accumulate
in the brain due to reduced clearance42. Earlier studies have
shown a reduced turnover of CSF and removal of labeled pro-
teins, including amyloid beta, after ventricular-cisternal perfusion
in aged rats43. Therefore, we tested whether lymphatic outflow
from CSF was reduced in aged mice and would be similar to prior
observations of reduced peripheral lymphatic transport in aged
mice34,35,44. We first tested whether we could detect differences in
CSF transport to blood after ventricular infusion of P40D680 in
18-month-old (aged) and 2-month-old (young) C57BL/6J-Tyrc-J
albino mice. After 60 min, we observed less P40D680 signal in the
saphenous vein of aged mice compared with the young controls
(Fig. 7a, b). Dynamic imaging (Fig. 7c; Supplementary Movies 4
and 5) showed a significant increase in the transit time to blood in

 aged mice (37.5 ± 8.4 vs. 24.2 ± 2.1 min, p = 0.0085; t-tailed Stu-
dent’s t-test, Fig. 7d) compared with young mice. The signal
enhancement at 60 min in aged mice was significantly reduced
compared with young mice (1600 ± 1160 vs. 5580 ± 1285 counts,
respectively; p = 0.0009; two-tailed Student’s t-test, Fig. 7e), as
was the slope of enhancement from 45 to 60 min (64.1 ± 38.0 vs.
214.9 ± 42.5 counts/min, p = 0.0004; two-tailed Student’s t-test,
Fig. 7f). These results indicate that the dynamics of CSF outflow
to blood were slower in aged mice.
We next tested whether less lymphatic outflow from CSF to the
submandibular lymph nodes also occurred in aged mice. As
before, we infused P40D680 into the right ventricle and imaged
the submandibular lymph node region through the skin. There
was less signal seen in the lymph nodes of aged mice at 30 min
compared to young controls (Fig. 7g, h). Quantification from
dynamic imaging (Fig. 7i) revealed a significantly increased
transit time to the lymph nodes in aged mice compared to young
mice (20.7 ± 2.3 vs. 12.4 ± 1.5 min, p < 0.0001; two-tailed Stu-
dent’s t-test, Fig. 7j). Signal detected in the mandibular nodes at
30 min was markedly reduced (aged: 8567 ± 5273 vs. young:
32173 ± 9617 counts; p = 0.0003; two-tailed Student’s t-test,
Fig. 7k). The slope of signal increase during the last 5 min of
imaging (aged: 1136 ± 637 vs. young: 2027 ± 795 counts/min; p =
0.056; two-tailed Student’s t-test, Fig. 7l) was not significantly
different. Further analysis after euthanizing the mice showed that
less signal was also apparent in the deep cervical lymph nodes at
30 min in aged mice (aged: 7780 ± 2781 vs. young: 15123 ± 4756
counts; p = 0.006; two-tailed Student’s t-test, Supplementary
Fig. 8). However, no significant difference could be seen at
60 min indicating a delayed outflow pattern in aged mice.
As the delay of outflow that was observed after intraventricular
infusion could possibly be due to altered transport from the
lateral ventricle to the SAS in aged animals, we also tested for a
reduction in lymphatic outflow in aged mice after cisterna magna
infusion. Cisterna magna infusions of 5 μL of 100 μM P40D680
were performed in 18-month-old (aged) and 2-month-old
(young) C57BL/6J-Tyrc-J albino mice. The infusion cannula
was kept in place for 10 min to limit the backflow of tracer from
the CSF and imaging was initiated at 15 min after the completion
of the infusion. Once again, aged mice demonstrated a reduction
in CSF outflow with lower signals apparent in the systemic blood
at 60 min (Supplementary Fig. 9). Quantification revealed an
increased transport time, decreased signal in blood at 60 min, and
a lower slope of enhancement from 45 to 60 min in aged mice
compared to younger controls. In sum, the imaging data after
both intraventricular and cisternal infusions indicated signifi-
cantly slower CSF outflow into lymphatic vessels of aged mice.
Discussion
We have elucidated a complex flow pattern of CSF after ven-
tricular infusion of tracers in mice, demonstrating various peri-
neural outflow routes from the mouse cranial cavity, as well as
flow from the ventricles to the SAS and into the nervous tissue of
the brain via paravascular spaces. Dynamic imaging suggested
that lymphatic outflow was the major outflow route for CSF
rather than venous routes, with even small molecular tracers not
demonstrating
immediate
blood
uptake.
Finally,
we
have
demonstrated a significant decline in CSF outflow in aged mice, a
finding that may have significance for many aging-associated
neurological disorders.
Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to characterize in
detail the lymphatic outflow pathways of CSF from the skull in
mice (Supplementary Fig. 10). Our use of pegylated and small
molecular NIR tracers and lymphatic-specific reporter mice
combined with high-resolution stereomicroscopy have allowed an
in-depth analysis of perineural outflow pathways and routing to
CSF-draining lymph nodes. We found an extensive network of
lymphatic vessels outside the CNS that transported tracer from
the CSF to both mandibular and deep cervical lymph node groups
within 30 min after intraventricular infusion. Our findings of
perineural outflow largely agree with a wide-ranging body of
research in many species dating back to Schwalbe in 1869 that
detail the major outflow pathways from the skull to reach the
lymphatic system15,17. Most previous researchers have come to
the conclusion that perineural drainage along the olfactory nerve
(CN I) through the cribriform plate to reach the nasal mucosa is
the most important CSF lymphatic outflow route in several spe-
cies17,20,21,45. Although we were able to confirm that this pathway
was active, we also highlighted several other perineural routes that
appear to complement the nasal route in mice. In agreement with
previous literature, the perineural pathways along the optic (CN
II) nerve through the orbit appeared to be important22–24.
However, we have shown that the trigeminal nerve (CN V) also
exhibited a perineural pattern and, therefore, may represent
another pathway from the cranial SAS to the orbit. We also
detected tracer emanating from the jugular foramina along the
glossopharyngeal (CN IX), vagus (CN X), and accessory (CN XI)
nerves, as well as outflow from the stylomastoid foramina along
the facial nerve (CN VII), two locations that are in close proxi-
mity to the deep cervical lymph nodes. Interestingly, jugular
outflow was detected in the early study in dogs by Schwalbe,
however, these specific pathways through the base of the skull
have otherwise been identified in only a few previous stu-
dies15,29,46,47. In sum, we found evidence of tracer exiting along
several cranial nerves in mice after intraventricular infusion.
The recent rediscovery of dural lymphatic vessels has attracted
a great deal of attention on a role for a functional lymphatic
system within the central nervous system30,31. Although these
vessels have been previously observed in many species, these
earlier findings have been largely ignored21,48–51. In the current
study, we were not able to observe any apparent uptake of the
P40D680 tracer into the dural lymphatic vessels within the skull
near the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses, or near the optic
nerve at several different time points after infusion. We found
that these lymphatic vessels were frequently discontinuous, had
small diameters and, as previously reported30,31, lack intraluminal
valves (except at the base of the skull), indicating that they are
different from conventional lymphatic networks. One possible
objection to a functional role for these vessels draining CSF is the
presence of an arachnoid barrier layer between the CSF and the
dura mater4,52,53. Similar to the barriers at the endothelium of the
brain capillaries and at the epithelial lining of the choroid plexus3,
there exists a barrier layer that consists of arachnoid cells con-
taining tight junctions that serves to isolate the CSF within the
SAS from the interstitial fluid of the dura mater4,52,53. As the
blood vessels of the dura mater tissue are fenestrated4, it is pos-
sible that the dural lymphatic vessels exist to drain this tissue. A
previous study found the presence of horseradish peroxidase in
dural lymphatic vessels of the cat only under high injection
pressures indicating that physical disruption of the arachnoid
barrier must occur in order for CSF to reach the dura mater
tissue50. Others have discussed that dural lymphatics must have a
minor or accessory role to the main perineural outflow path-
ways21,54. Interestingly, anatomical studies have demonstrated
lymphatic vessels in the dura around the optic and facial nerves
and at the cribriform plate and jugular foramen, indicating that
lymphatic uptake of CSF may occur as the cranial nerves exit the
skull31,49,55,56. Clearly, more research is needed to determine the
importance of the dural lymphatic route for CSF outflow in
comparison to the more established perineural pathways to reach
extracranial lymphatic vessels.

 Our development of NIR dynamic imaging approaches has
allowed real-time quantitative assessments of both lymphatic
outflow and transport to blood of CSF-infused tracers that were
not previously possible in animals without cannulation. The
dynamic imaging results after CSF infusions of macromolecular
and small molecular fluorescent tracers strongly suggest that
lymphatic transport is the predominant CSF outflow pathway in
mice. Supporting evidence for this conclusion is (1) the similarity
of the CSF outflow pattern to patterns of lymphatic transport to
blood from other tissues such as skin and peritoneal cavity35, with
a delay in the appearance of the signal in blood followed by a
steady linear increase; (2) the presence of significant levels of
tracer within the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes draining the
skull before any appearance of signal in the blood; (3) the lack of
any evident signal during direct imaging of the posterior facial
vein which receives the blood from the transverse sinus in
rodents39,40; and (4) the confirmation of an active pumping
mechanism of collecting lymphatic vessels draining CSF that
serves to propel the lymphatic fluid towards the venous system
even under anesthesia. These results, indicating a lymphatic-
predominant drainage of CSF, are largely in agreement with work
from the group of Miles Johnston who reached a similar con-
clusion54,57. Starting in the late 1990s, a series of elegant quan-
titative studies in sheep and rats from this group demonstrated
that radiolabeled tracers could be recovered in sufficient quan-
tities from cannulated lymphatic vessels to account for over half
of the tracers estimated within the bloodstream17,19. The robust
outflow through lymphatic vessels under anesthesia observed in
the current study is likely due to a favorable pressure gradient
driving flow from the SAS within the rigid cranial cavity to the
lymphatic vessels outside the skull. Measurements in other spe-
cies have indicated that pressure within the SAS may be 3 or more
times that of the cervical lymphatic system58. Although we have
shown previously that lymphatic transport is reduced under
anesthesia due to lack of uptake into initial vessels35, the pressure
gradient between the skull and surrounding tissue may overcome
the need for muscular movement that normally drives lymph
formation. Nonetheless, the question whether CSF lymphatic
outflow is increased or decreased during awake conditions
remains to be answered.
These findings call into question the role of arachnoid villi or
other possible direct venous connections as outflow routes of
solutes from the CSF. It is perhaps not surprising, due to their
location within the skull, that no direct in vivo proof of arachnoid
villi uptake has ever been demonstrated. Supporting evidence for
the importance of these structures draining CSF have mostly
relied on examination of post-mortem tissue6,59 or on ex vivo
studies, which have shown in isolated arachnoid villi that particles
as big as erythrocytes could pass through60. However, since a
continuous lining of endothelial cells with tight junctions was
found to exist on the villus8,11, it is still unclear how macro-
molecules are transported7,12,61. Previous studies have attempted
to use the dynamics of accumulation of intraventricular-injected
macromolecular tracers into the blood or urine as evidence of
arachnoid villi transport62–64. In these studies there were often
delays until tracer was apparent in the blood or urine compared
to when the tracers were injected intravenously, similar to our
findings of a delayed transport to blood. We were also unable to
provide evidence of a direct route from the CSF to blood by
dynamic imaging of the posterior facial vein that collects blood
from the transverse sinus in mice within the first 30 min after
infusion despite the presence of high levels of tracer within
lymphatic vessels. These results are similar to an early cannula-
tion study in dogs65. Studies from the group of McComb under
various CSF pressure conditions were unable to detect increased
tracer levels in the superior sagittal sinus compared to peripheral
blood in rabbits, cats, and primates64,66,67. In rats, direct blood
uptake was detected after intraventricular infusions of inulin or
polystyrene beads only after reaching CSF pressures of seven to
eight times normal levels68. Studies in sheep by the Johnston
group determined that pressures of around threefold higher than
normal levels were necessary to detect direct blood uptake13.
Therefore, it appears that plenty of doubt exists regarding the role
of the arachnoid projections in the drainage of fluid and mac-
romolecules from the CSF in many species beyond mice, and that
it may be time for a reexamination of this widely accepted con-
cept. Although the present experiments cannot explicitly rule out
a direct connection from CSF to blood, particularly one that is
active at later time points or under high intracranial pressure,
they are strongly indicative that the lymphatic outflow pathways
are much more important than originally envisioned and that the
lymphatic system may represent the major site between the CSF
and blood compartments.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate a
reduction of lymphatic outflow of CSF with aging. One previous
study has shown less outflow of radiolabeled tracers to the nasal
turbinates in aged rats but did not quantify outflow to the lym-
phatic system or the systemic blood69. Since under homeostatic
conditions, CSF inflow must equal CSF outflow, this decreased
outflow in aged mice may be at least in part due to reduced CSF
production by the choroid plexus or by sources from within the
interstitial tissue such as the blood–brain barrier16,70. The chor-
oid plexus has been shown to undergo age-related morphological
alterations in its epithelial lining as well as a thickening of the
basement
membrane43.
An additional
explanation
for the
reduced CSF outflow observed during the current study could be
previous data from humans and rats showing an increased CSF
volume with aging, which would indicate that the infused tracer
may have been more diluted in the CSF of aged mice43,71. It will
be interesting to test whether a more accelerated decrease in CSF
lymphatic outflow exists in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease
and whether a functional decline is associated with the develop-
ment of amyloid beta plaques. If so, the lymphatic system may
represent a possible new therapeutic target with the aim to
enhance the clearance of toxic proteins from the CSF and the
brain.
In conclusion, we have identified many perineural sites for the
egress of CSF from the cranium of mice. Most importantly,
through NIR dynamic imaging, we have presented evidence that
these outflow pathways to reach the lymphatic system appear to
represent the major exit routes for both macromolecular and
small molecule tracers from the CSF, rather than the commonly
accepted venous route. Although demonstration of this phe-
nomenon in humans still awaits, this study sets the stage for
investigation of a potentially important role for the lymphatic
system in a multitude of CNS-related pathologies. In addition,
there may be potential for clinical translation of the imaging
technique since noninvasive monitoring of NIR tracers in the
blood already exists in the clinic72. Therefore, quantification of
CSF outflow after intrathecal administration of NIR tracers in
patients suffering from neurological disorders may be possible.
Methods
Mice. All mouse experiments were approved by Kantonales Veterinaramt Zurich
(license numbers 185/13, 196/13, and 161/16). Female C57BL/6J-Tyrc-J albino mice
(Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and Prox1-GFP mice73 on the C57BL/6J
background were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions and used for
experimental studies at the age of 2–3 months. For aging studies, female C57BL/6J-
Tyrc-J mice were aged in-house to 18 months of age and compared with young
animals from the same colony. After the completion of imaging experiments, the
mice were euthanized with an overdose of anesthesia (1000 mg/kg ketamine;
3.5 mg/kg medetomidine).

 Infusion of tracers into lateral ventricle or cisterna magna. Mice were anes-
thetized (80 mg/kg ketamine; 0.2 mg/kg medetomidine) and fixed in a stereotaxic
frame (RWD, San Diego, CA). The skull was thinned with a dental drill (RWD) at a
location 0.95 mm lateral and 0.22 mm caudal to the bregma. A 33 G steel needle
was inserted into the right lateral ventricle 2.35 mm ventral to the skull surface.
Infusion of 2.5 µL of 200 μM P40D680 tracer32 (provided by Dr. J.-C. Leroux, ETH
Zurich), 0.6% Evans blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), IRDye680CW NHS ester (LI-
COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), or 3kDa-AF680 (Thermo Fischer) at the speed of
1 µL/min was then performed with a syringe pump (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). The
needle was left in place for 2.5 min and then slowly removed while observing if any
significant backflow occurred.
For cisterna magna infusion, mice were anesthetized as above and a surgical
procedure to access this structure was performed74. After a small skin incision over
the occipital bone/cervical spinal cord was performed, the three covering muscle
layers were carefully dissected under a stereomicroscope using fine forceps and
scissors. Subsequently, the atlanto-occipital membrane (AOM), covering the
cisterna magna, was pre-punctured using a 34 G cannula. The infusion cannula was
then inserted through this opening to a depth of 250 µm. A droplet of histoacryl
was added to the interface of cannula and AOM to avoid reflux of CSF/tracer
during the infusion. Overall, 5 µL of 100 μM P40D680 tracer was infused at the
speed of 1 µL/min. After the infusion, the cannula was left in place for 10 min to
avoid reflux. After withdrawal of the cannula, a droplet of histoacryl was finally
added to ensure no CSF fistula.
Dynamic NIR imaging of CSF outflow. For noninvasive imaging of tracer signals
in blood35, fur above the saphenous vein region was shaved with a razor and
depilation cream before the ventricular or cisternal infusion. After removal of the
needle from the skull or the cisterna magna, the mice were quickly positioned
under a Zeiss StereoLumar.V12 stereomicroscope with AxioVision software (Carl
Zeiss, Feldbach, Switzerland) and a Photometrics Evolve 512 camera (Photo-
metrics, Tuscon, AZ) in a supine position on a heating pad to maintain body
temperature. The autofluorescence signal on the GFP channel was used to position
the saphenous blood vessels at ×25 zoom. Dynamic imaging was initiated 5 min
after the completion of the ventricle infusion and 15 min after completion of the
cisterna infusion by acquisition of a sequence of images (1 image every 15 s for
55 min) with a Cy5 filter set to monitor the NIR signal of the saphenous vein.
Exposure time and camera gain settings were 200 ms and 200, respectively.
For noninvasive imaging of the lymphatic flow32 in the shaved neck region, the
ventricular infusion procedure was the same as above and image acquisition was
performed with the following modifications: magnification of the imaging was at
×6 zoom on the neck region and dynamic imaging was performed for 25 min with
a sequence of 1 image per 1 s.
For noninvasive imaging of potential tracer outflow to the posterior facial vein,
the same ventricular infusion procedure was followed, but immediately afterwards,
an incision to the lateral skin of the head was made to expose the junction of the
internal maxillary vein with the posterior facial vein. Dynamic imaging was
initiated at 10 min after injection and continued for 20 min with 1 image acquired
every 15 s at ×22 zoom.
Assessment of transport to blood and lymph nodes. Using AxioVision software,
a circular region of interest of radius 100 μm was placed over the saphenous vein
on the acquired videos. Using the Measure Profile function, a table of fluorescence
intensity in counts vs. time was exported into Microsoft Excel. As there was a loss
of signal at the beginning of the scans due to photobleaching of tissue auto-
fluorescence, baseline intensity in counts was calculated as an average signal of the
lowest ten consecutive imaging frames. This baseline intensity was then subtracted
from the fluorescence intensity values to plot fluorescent signal enhancement vs.
time in min. For quantification of transport to blood, three assessments were made
from the data of signal enhancement vs. time. These were the NIR fluorescent
signal enhancement value in counts at t = 60 min, the linear slope of signal
enhancement from t = 45 to 60 min after infusion in counts/min and the transit
time in min of the arrival of tracer to the blood circulation (set at a threshold of 100
counts of signal enhancement).
For assessment of transport to mandibular lymph nodes, the procedure was the
same excepting that the circular region of interest was of radius 500 μm over the
mandibular lymph node. The linear slope was calculated as the signal enhancement
from t = 25 to 30 min after infusion and the threshold for signal enhancement to
determine the transit time was set to 300 counts. The quantifications of one lymph
node on each side were averaged to generate one value per mouse.
Assessment of collecting lymphatic vessel contractility. Contractility was
assessed based on our published methods33. In short, in AxioVision software, on
each video of dynamic imaging of mandibular lymph nodes, a region of interest of
radius 200 μm was drawn over the afferent collecting vessel on each side of the
mouse. The data in mean fluorescent intensity values over time was then exported
in .xml format. Contractility measures were determined for a 5 min period between
25 and 30 min after infusion using a Matlab algorithm for the frequency in con-
tractions per min. Values from the two vessels were then averaged to obtain one
value for each measure per mouse.
Intravenous infusions for tracer dose calibration. A custom-designed catheter of
polyethylene (PE)—10 tubing (SCI, Lake Havasu City, AZ) and a 30 G needle was
placed into the tail vein of C57BL/6 J mice. An infusion pump (PHD2000, Harvard
Apparatus, Cambridge, MA) connected to the catheter was used for consistent
infusions of tracer. For demonstration of the linear relationship between tracer
dose and venous signal, either 10 μL of the P40D680 tracer (at 1 μM) or Evans blue
(at 0.003%) was infused every 3 min using a stepwise infusion program. To
determine the threshold amounts for detection in blood, P40D680 was diluted to
0.05 μM and Evans blue to 0.00015%, and infused in a similar manner. The number
of infusions before increasing signal was detected in the blood was determined to
be the threshold for detection.
In situ analysis of CSF flow and lymphatic outflow. Anatomical mapping of the
outflow pathways in Prox1-GFP mice was performed in three groups of n = 5 mice
at time points of euthanization at 10, 30, and 60 min after intraventricular infusion
of P40D680. Images of P40D680 tracer spread on the surfaces of the brain, peri-
neural exit points, and within the lymphatic vasculature were acquired with a Zeiss
AxioZoom V16 microscope and a QImaging OptiMOS sCMOS camera (QImaging,
Surrey, Canada) combined with a light-emitting diode illumination system pE-
4000 (CoolLED Ltd, Andover, UK). To compare signals within lymph nodes at
different time points, images were acquired at identical zoom factors (×25), and
exposure times (200 ms). As there were no consistent differences in signal in the
lymph nodes on the injected and contralateral sides, the average value of the nodes
on each side was used.
Brain sections. Mouse brains were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C over-
night. A section of the brain between 1 mm cranial and 1 mm caudal to the needle
insertion site was cut out by razor blade and imbedded with 2% low melt agarose
(BIO-RAD). Cross sections were made from dorsal to ventral side at a thickness of
100 µm with Vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT1000 S). Images were acquired
with a Zeiss AxioZoom V16 microscope.
Statistics. For the studies to assess paravascular spread and CSF outflow at dif-
ferent time points, mice were randomly allocated to different experimental groups.
Owing to the nature of the aging studies, neither randomization nor blinding of
investigators was possible. Group sizes were estimated based on pilot studies to
determine the success rate and reproducibility of the intraventricular and cisterna
magna infusions. All data are presented as mean ± SD. All groups were found to be
normally distributed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test. Means of two
groups were compared using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Means of three groups
were compared with one-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s multiple comparison post
hoc test. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V5.0 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA) and p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
