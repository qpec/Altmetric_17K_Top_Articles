ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND GLORIA-AF (Global Registry on Long-Term Oral Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients with Atrial
Fibrillation) is a prospective, global registry program describing antithrombotic treatment patterns in patients with newly
diagnosed nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at risk of stroke. Phase 2 began when dabigatran, the first non–vitamin K
antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), became available.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to describe phase 2 baseline data and compare these with the pre-NOAC era collected
during phase 1.
METHODS During phase 2, 15,641 consenting patients were enrolled (November 2011 to December 2014); 15,092 were
eligible. This pre-specified cross-sectional analysis describes eligible patients’ baseline characteristics. Atrial
fibrillation disease characteristics, medical outcomes, and concomitant diseases and medications were collected. Data
were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS Of the total patients, 45.5% were female; median age was 71 (interquartile range: 64, 78) years. Patients were
from Europe (47.1%), North America (22.5%), Asia (20.3%), Latin America (6.0%), and the Middle East/Africa (4.0%).
Most had high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc [Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age $75 years, Diabetes mellitus,
previous Stroke, Vascular disease, Age 65 to 74 years, Sex category] score $2; 86.1%); 13.9% had moderate risk
(CHA2DS2-VASc ¼ 1). Overall, 79.9% received oral anticoagulants, of whom 47.6% received NOAC and 32.3% vitamin K
antagonists (VKA); 12.1% received antiplatelet agents; 7.8% received no antithrombotic treatment. For comparison, the
proportion of phase 1 patients (of N ¼ 1,063 all eligible) prescribed VKA was 32.8%, acetylsalicylic acid 41.7%, and no
therapy 20.2%. In Europe in phase 2, treatment with NOAC was more common than VKA (52.3% and 37.8%,
respectively); 6.0% of patients received antiplatelet treatment; and 3.8% received no antithrombotic treatment. In
North America, 52.1%, 26.2%, and 14.0% of patients received NOAC, VKA, and antiplatelet drugs, respectively; 7.5%
received no antithrombotic treatment. NOAC use was less common in Asia (27.7%), where 27.5% of patients received
VKA, 25.0% antiplatelet drugs, and 19.8% no antithrombotic treatment.
CONCLUSIONS The baseline data from GLORIA-AF phase 2 demonstrate that in newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation patients, NOAC have been highly adopted into practice, becoming more frequently prescribed than VKA
in Europe and North America. Worldwide, however, a large proportion of patients remain undertreated, particularly
in Asia and North America. (Global Registry on Long-Term Oral Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients With Atrial

 A
trial
fibrillation (AF)
is
the
most
common cardiac arrhythmia world-
wide. It increases the risk of stroke
up to 5-fold (1,2). Oral anticoagulants (OAC),
and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in partic-
ular, have long been the cornerstone of treat-
ment
for
patients
with
AF,
providing
a
64% reduction in risk of ischemic stroke
and a 26% reduction in all-cause mortality
compared
with
control
or
placebo
when
assessed
in
clinical
trials
according
to
intention-to-treat (3).
Until 6 years ago, the only OAC available
were VKA (e.g., warfarin). Due to interpatient
and intrapatient variability in their anticoagulant
effect, many physicians were reluctant to prescribe
VKA for fear of bleeding and due to misperception of
the thrombotic risk for individual patients (2). Thus,
up to 50% of AF patients did not receive OAC to pre-
vent ischemic stroke (3). Non–vitamin K antagonist
oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are equal to or more
effective than VKA for stroke prevention in patients
with
nonvalvular
AF
(4–8).
Whereas
they
have
changed practice, the extent to which various anti-
coagulant drugs are prescribed is uncertain in some
regions of the world, as is the manner in which phy-
sicians use indexes of risk, particularly the CHADS2
(Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age $75
years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke), CHA2DS2-
VASc
(Congestive
heart
failure,
Hypertension,
Age $75 years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke,
Vascular disease, Age 65 to 74 years, Sex category),
and HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver
function,
Stroke,
Bleeding,
Labile
international
normalized ratio, Elderly [age >65 years], previous
Drug, alcohol, or medication usage) scores, that have
been incorporated into guidelines.
Data to address these issues are available from the
GLORIA-AF
(Global
Registry

Long-Term
Oral
Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients With Atrial
Fibrillation)
registry
program,
a
comprehensive
worldwide registry program of AF patients developed
to evaluate 3 phases of anticoagulant practice, as
follows: phase 1: before the availability of NOAC;
phase
2:
following
the
availability
of
the
direct
thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, the first NOAC; and
phase 3: when data from phase 2 indicate that char-
acteristics of patients receiving dabigatran treatment
overlap sufficiently with those given VKA treatment
in a given region to support further statistical com-
parisons. In this paper, we report on patient charac-
teristics
and
antithrombotic
prescribing
patterns

 globally and regionally at baseline in phase 2, which
was initiated when dabigatran became available, and
compare the phase 2 data with the pre-NOAC era data
(phase 1).
METHODS
DESIGN. This registry program entails ongoing data
collection from patients with newly diagnosed non-
valvular AF during 3 separate phases (9) (Figure 1).
The results of phase 1, conducted before approval of
NOAC in each region, have been published (10). Dur-
ing phase 2, which began in each country when
dabigatran was approved, cross-sectional data were
collected at baseline for all enrolled patients with
newly diagnosed AF. The data included AF disease
characteristics, medical conditions including con-
comitant diseases, and medications. No additional
procedures, apart from assessments performed as
part of routine clinical practice, were required.
DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY CONTROL. All clinical
data were collected using a validated web-based sys-
tem to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The study
staff at each site entered data over a secure network.
A complete electronic audit trail was maintained, with
data quality being monitored on an ongoing basis,
with a subset of sites audited onsite. Data quality and
queries were addressed using bimonthly telephone
calls to all sites and quarterly review meetings were
held to assess aggregate data and address systematic
issues. Data quality measures were implemented on
an ongoing basis through automatic programmed
data checks, manual data reviews conducted on a
bimonthly
basis,
and
quarterly
medical
quality
reviews of aggregate data to address any systematic
data issues identified (e.g., trends for missing data).
A subset of sites was monitored with onsite source
data verification and a different subset of sites was
audited onsite by sponsor audit representatives.
PATIENTS. The registry program includes consecutive
patients age $18 years with CHA2DS2-VASc scores $1
and
nonvalvular
AF
diagnosed
within
3
months
before the first visit. Patients with mechanical heart
valves, previous VKA therapy for >60 days, and AF
due to a generally reversible cause were excluded.
The term nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) was

 used in this registry (and others) as this was used in
the randomized trials and contemporary guidelines
when GLORIA-AF was designed and ongoing. This
excludes valvular AF, which refers to AF in associa-
tion with prosthetic mechanical heart valves or he-
modynamically
significant
native
valvular
heart
disease where an intervention was to be performed
(e.g., valve surgery) or there was an impact on the
patient’s likelihood of survival.
To be included, the patient’s AF had to be docu-
mented by 12-lead electrocardiography, electrocar-
diographic
rhythm
strip,
pacemaker/implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator electrocardiogram, or Hol-
ter electrocardiography. Patients were recruited from
a variety of outpatient settings including university
hospitals, community hospitals, specialist offices, and
general practice offices. Centers were selected to
reflect physicians who typically identify and manage
new AF cases in a given country. Patients were
excluded for the following reasons: mechanical heart
valves or valve disease expected to require valve
replacement during the course of the registry; >60
days
of
VKA
treatment
for
any
indication
in
their lifetime; AF with a generally reversible cause,
life expectancy <1 year; or an indication for OAC other
than
AF.
Standard
electronic

report
forms
were used to record baseline clinical and demographic
characteristics,
type
of
AF,
and
management
approach. Patients without important protocol viola-
tions and who met data cleaning criteria for analysis
were considered eligible for inclusion. Bleeding risk
was assessed by the HAS-BLED score (11).

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Data are summarized by
median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous
variables and by frequencies and percentages for
categorical variables. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using SAS software version 9.4, (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, North Carolina). This is a descriptive
study—no inferential statistical analyses were made.
No statistical hypothesis tests were performed.
RESULTS
PATIENTS. From November 2011 to December 2014, a
total of 15,641 patients at 984 centers in 44 countries
were enrolled in phase 2. Of these, 15,092 were eligible
for analysis (did not have important protocol viola-
tions and met data cleaning criteria for analysis), with
the following distribution across regions: Europe 7,108
(47.1%); North America 3,403 (22.5%); Asia 3,071
(20.3%); Latin America 913 (6.0%); and Africa/Middle
East 597 (4.0%). In phase 1, 1,063 patients were
included as eligible for the analysis, from some centers
that were not the same as phase 2 (10). The partici-
pating countries in phase 2 per region, as well as the
regional contributions, are summarized in Figure 2.
DEMOGRAPHICS AND COMORBIDITIES. The major-
ity of participating sites were university hospitals
(33.7%), followed by specialist offices (30.3%), com-
munity
hospitals
(26.3%),
primary
care
(6.4%),
outpatient clinics or anticoagulation clinics (2.5%),
and “other” site types not specified (0.8%). The me-
dian age at enrollment was 71 years (IQR: 64, 78),
similar
to
phase
1
(70
years)
(10).
Patient
de-
mographics and comorbidities are shown in Table 1.
The most prevalent comorbidities at baseline were

hyperlipidemia
(39.9%),
heart
failure
(24.2%),
diabetes
mellitus
(23.1%), left ventricular hypertrophy (20.3%), and
coronary artery disease (20.3%). In phase 1, the most
common comorbidities were hypertension (74.8%),
coronary artery disease (24.1%), congestive heart
failure (24.1%), and diabetes mellitus (22.6%) (10).
Paroxysmal AF was present in 53.4% of patients,
35.5% had persistent AF, and 11.1% had permanent
AF, compared with 62.6%, 33.8%, and 3.7%, respec-
tively, in phase 1 (10) (Figure 3). AF was symptomatic
in 28.2% of patients and minimally symptomatic or
asymptomatic in 71.8%; in phase 1, AF was symp-
tomatic in 62.2% (10) (Figure 3).

The GLORIA-AF Registry Phase 2 Baseline Results
781
 (IQR: 2 to 4). The median CHADS2 score was 2 (IQR: 1
to 3) and more than one-half of the patients (57.8%)
had CHADS2 scores of $2. The median HAS-BLED
score was 1 (IQR: 1 to 2), with scores <3 in most pa-
tients (n ¼ 11,927; 79.0%). These median scores were
all similar to those observed in phase 1 (10).
ANTITHROMBOTIC
THERAPY. Overall,
OAC
was
prescribed in 79.9% of patients. Nearly one-half
(47.6%) received a NOAC, while 32.3% received a
VKA, and 12.1% either received acetylsalicylic acid
(ASA) or another antiplatelet agent alone or in com-
bination with ASA. A total of 7.8% of patients received
no antithrombotic agent (Figure 4). Among patients
with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 1, 19.3% received ASA
and 14.1% received no antithrombotic treatment,
whereas 10.0% of those with CHA2DS2-VASc scores $2
received
ASA
and
6.8%
received
no
treatment
(Figure 5). These figures contrast with phase 1 results,
in which ASA was most commonly prescribed (41.7%),
followed by VKA (32.8%), and other antiplatelet
agents (3.4%); 20.2% did not receive antithrombotic
therapy (10).
REGIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS. In the Euro-
pean cohort, the median age was 73.0 (IQR: 66.0 to
79.0) years and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score was
3 (IQR: 2 to 4). The most prevalent comorbidities were
diabetes (21.2%), left ventricular hypertrophy (22.0%),
heart failure (23.4%), hyperlipidemia (36.5%), and
hypertension (73.4%). In North America, the median
age was 71.0 (IQR: 64.0 to 79.0) years and the median
CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3 (IQR: 2 to 4). The most
prevalent comorbidities were chronic gastrointestinal
disease (22.0%), coronary artery disease (27.0%), dia-
betes (27.1%), hyperlipidemia (61.3%), and hyperten-
sion (80.5%). In Asia, the median age was 68.0 (IQR:
60.0 to 76.0), the median CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3
(IQR: 2 to 4), and the most prevalent comorbidities
were diabetes (20.2%), hyperlipidemia (26.7%), heart
failure (27.3%), and hypertension (69.4%).
REGIONAL PATTERNS OF ANITHROMBOTIC THERAPY.
Antithrombotic treatment choices at baseline in the 5
participating regions are summarized in the Central
Illustration. Regions with the greatest number of pa-
tients were Europe, North America, and Asia, which
together provided 90.0% of all patients in the registry
program. In European centers, more patients were
treated with NOAC (52.3%) than with VKA (37.8%).
ASA or other antiplatelet treatments were given to
6.0% of patients, whereas 3.8% received no anti-
thrombotic treatment. Similarly, in North American
centers, more than one-half of the patients were
treated with a NOAC (52.1%), VKA was prescribed in
26.2%, 14.0% received antiplatelet treatment, and
7.5% received no antithrombotic treatment. In Asia,
27.5% of patients received VKA and 27.7% NOAC.
Antiplatelet treatment was given to 25.0%, whereas
19.8% received no antithrombotic treatment.
DISCUSSION
In the first few years after approval of dabigatran, and
later following other NOAC, the overall uptake of
NOAC was observed to be more frequent than that of

 VKA in all regions except Asia. In addition, particu-
larly in Europe, Latin America, and Africa/Middle
East, the majority of patients received OAC. Whereas
OAC therapy was also commonly prescribed in North
America, antiplatelet therapy use was higher than in
Europe, Latin America, or Africa/Middle East. In Asia,
the use of OAC therapy, either with NOAC or VKA,
was increasing; however, 1 in 5 patients of this high-
risk population (CHA2DS2-VASc $2) still received no
adequate therapy for stroke prevention.
Nearly
80.0%
of
patients
received
an
OAC,
compared with 64.0% during phase 1, when no NOAC
were available (10). In phase 2, nearly one-half of
patients (47.6%) received a NOAC, whereas 32.3%
received a VKA, and 12.1% ASA or another antiplatelet
drug, but 7.8% received no treatment. For compari-
son, the proportion of phase 1 patients prescribed
VKA was 32.8%, ASA 41.7%, and no therapy 20.2%. In
Europe in phase 1, OAC (essentially VKA) were pre-
scribed in 63.9%, ASA in 25.4%, and no therapy in
8.6%. In Europe, the use of antiplatelet treatment
decreased from 27.1% in phase 1 to 6.0% in phase 2.
Similarly,
the
percentage
of
European
patients
receiving no antithrombotic therapy decreased from
8.6% in phase 1 to 3.8% in phase 2.
These observations offer important insights into
how clinical practice has been changed by the advent
of NOAC, as well as the different evolution in interna-
tional guidelines on the management of AF (12–15). In
North America, nearly 80.0% of patients received OAC,
more than 50.0% received NOAC but 14.0% received
antiplatelet therapy. This pattern may reflect the U.S.
guidelines, which advised antiplatelet therapy or no
antithrombotic therapy as an alternative to OAC in
patients with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 1 (16,17).
Phase
2
of
GLORIA-AF
provides
data
shortly
after the launch of NOAC in a given region. Other
registries have reported data describing treatment
patterns in AF patients, but comparisons across regis-
tries can be challenging for a variety of reasons.
Differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria, partici-
pating physician specialties, and practice settings
(e.g., academic vs. community hospitals) can result
in
substantially
different
patient
populations
or
treatment preferences. Also, different time frames for
enrollment compared with approval dates of available
treatments (i.e., uptake of new treatments in the
context of marketing approvals and availabilities) can
result in different treatment patterns in a given region.
Antithrombotic
therapy
differs
considerably
by
region; hence the number of patients contributed by
different regions affects the overall treatment pattern.
One registry has been collecting data during a time
frame that overlapped GLORIA-AF. In the EORP-AF
(EurObservational
Research
Programme
on
Atrial
Fibrillation) registry, more than 3,000 patients were
enrolled from February 2012 to March 2013 indepen-
dent of NOAC approval status in the respective country
(18). In this registry, patients had electrocardiogram-
documented AF in the year before enrollment, unlike
GLORIA-AF, which enrolled only incident AF cases
with a new diagnosis of AF within the past 3 months.
OAC therapy was prescribed in 80.0% of patients, most
often VKA (71.6%), with NOAC used in 8.4%. Of note,
the first NOAC became registered in most European
countries in 2012, with subsequent approvals for
additional NOAC in 2013 and later. Therefore, more
than one-third of patients enrolled in EORP-AF came
from countries where NOAC were not yet approved
during the enrollment time, which explains the low
use of NOAC in EORP-AF compared with GLORIA-AF.
In addition, in GLORIA-AF, patients were enrolled
from a broad range of practice settings and physician
specialties
until
December
2014,
potentially
also
contributing to the lower use of NOAC in the EORP-AF
registry, which enrolled patients from cardiology
practices only. In the EORP-AF study, antiplatelet
therapy was used in one-third of patients. The mean
CHA2DS2-VASc score in EORP-AF was 3.2, with 3.2 also
the mean score in GLORIA-AF.

 STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. As a conse-
quence of the design, there are considerable limita-
tions
for
generalizability
of
these
data,
when
considering all patients with NVAF. The GLORIA-AF
study includes only patients at participating sites,
and the overall majority of patients came from car-
diology practices. Consequently, treatment patterns
could be influenced by site selection. Moreover,
patients had to give informed consent, which is
another selection factor. However, patients enrolled
were consecutive at each center. It is possible that
obtaining informed consent resulted in a higher
percentage of participating patients receiving oral
anticoagulant treatment than the proportion seen
among all patients. Sixty percent of study centers
were either university hospitals or community hos-
pitals, which may have increased the prevalence of
patients
treated
with
either
dabigatran
or
other
NOAC. Nonetheless our results may not be repre-
sentative of the overall general AF population but
are as representative as other registries of the newly
diagnosed NVAF patient population as defined in the
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
We tried to reduce selection factors within sites
by asking participating sites to include consecutive
patients, a point that is emphasized in the study
protocol.
Although
training
was
provided
to
in-
vestigators and site personnel on this point, we
could not verify adherence to this protocol for each
site in phase 2, as screening logs were not imple-
mented. As a result of recruitment of newly diag-
nosed AF, a relatively high percentage of patients
had paroxysmal AF. This would therefore
differ
from registries that enroll pre-existing NVAF pa-
tients and in addition do not consider NOAC avail-
ability in a country, for example, patients from
countries are included where no NOAC was avail-
able at that time.
Our broad reach of many centers and countries in
this
global
registry,
as
well
as
the
inclusion
of
recently
diagnosed
patients
(<3
months),
are
strengths, as is the timing of data collection in phase
2, which was initiated immediately after the launch
of the first NOAC in a given country. As a result, it is
difficult
to
disentangle
change
among
enrolled
patients over time from changes in the site makeup
over time.
CONCLUSIONS
The baseline phase 2 data from GLORIA-AF demon-
strate that in newly diagnosed NVAF patients there is

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE: Non-
vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) were widely
adopted in clinical practice for patients with recently identified
NVAF in the first years after their introduction, becoming more
frequently prescribed than VKA in Europe and North America, but
less so in Asia. Despite these trends, antiplatelet drugs or no
antithrombotic therapy were still relatively common even for
patients with CHA2DS2-VASc scores $1.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The next phase of this global
registry program will address the comparative follow-up of
patients in the later phase of market maturation, once those
selected for therapy with dabigatran are demographically com-
parable to those given VKA.
