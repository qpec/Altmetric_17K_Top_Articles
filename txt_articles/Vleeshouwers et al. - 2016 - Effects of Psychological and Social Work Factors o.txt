Study Objectives: This prospective cohort study examined previously underexplored relations between psychological/social work factors and troubled sleep 
in order to provide practical information about specific, modifiable factors at work.
Methods: A comprehensive evaluation of a range of psychological/social work factors was obtained by several designs; i.e., cross-sectional analyses 
at baseline and follow-up, prospective analyses with baseline predictors (T1), prospective analyses with average exposure across waves as predictor 
([T1 + T2] / 2), and prospective analyses with change in exposure from baseline to follow-up as predictor. Participants consisted of a sample of Norwegian 
employees from a broad spectrum of occupations, who completed a questionnaire at two points in time, approximately two years apart. Cross-sectional 
analyses at T1 comprised 7,459 participants, cross-sectional analyses at T2 included 6,688 participants. Prospective analyses comprised a sample 5,070 of 
participants who responded at both T1 and T2. Univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regressions were performed.
Results: Thirteen psychological/social work factors and two aspects of troubled sleep, namely difficulties initiating sleep and disturbed sleep, were 
studied. Ordinal logistic regressions revealed statistically significant associations for all psychological and social work factors in at least one of the analyses. 
Psychological and social work factors predicted sleep problems in the short term as well as the long term.
Conclusions: All work factors investigated showed statistically significant associations with both sleep items, however quantitative job demands, decision 
control, role conflict, and support from superior were the most robust predictors and may therefore be suitable targets of interventions aimed at improving 
employee sleep.

INTRODUCTION
Sleeping problems may affect many aspects of daily life, in-
cluding job performance, mood state, social functioning, and 
physical and mental health.1–4 Cost estimates for troubled 
sleep in Norway do not currently exist, but a 2011 US study 
estimated the socioeconomic costs roughly between 63 and 91 
billion dollars per year.5 The aim of the present study was to 
determine contributions of psychological work factors to sleep 
problems in working individuals.
There are over 80 different sleep disorders according to 
the International Classification of Sleep Disorders.6 How-
ever, many may suffer considerable consequences of sleeping 
problems that are not diagnosed. Many people suffering from 
troubled sleep may not seek medical help, and physicians may 
not enquire about sleep problems.7 Additionally, even when 
quality of life is affected by troubled sleep, sufferers may not 
satisfy criteria for diagnosis with a specific sleep disorder. The 
current study investigated sleep problems that may affect ev-
eryday life in Norwegian employees, whether this involves a 
diagnosed sleep problem or not.
Considering the magnitude of the problem (estimated prev-
alence rates of sleep problems in adults range from 11% to 
33%8,9) surprisingly little research seems to have focused on 
potentially preventable causes of sleep problems. Psycholog-
ical and social work factors may represent a significant source 
of such preventable causes. A large number of studies have

Significance
The results of the present study are of a clear practical and theoretical significance by disclosing relationships of several underexplored psychological 
and social work factors with difficulties initiating sleep and disturbed sleep. Factors such as quantitative job demands, decision control, role conflict, and 
support from superior should be modifiable, and thus suitable targets for interventions aimed at improving sleep. While the present study demonstrated 
both short-term effects, as well as effects after a two-year interval, little is known about the specific mechanisms through which work may affect sleep. 
Hence, future research should explore in detail how work may affect sleep and when effects occur, possibly through time-series design.
considered the effects of shift work on sleep or included only 
a single organization or a single type of work.10–12 The current 
study incorporated a large number of organizations, covering a 
wide variety of jobs, comprising a diverse large sample. More-
over, most studies investigating psychological/social work 
factors and sleep have been cross-sectional, while the current 
study utilized a full panel prospective design in order to com-
prehensively explore relationships between work factors and 
self-reported difficulties initiating sleep and disturbed sleep, 
cross-sectionally as well prospectively.
The Demand-Control-(Support) Model (DCS)13 is often 
referred to when explaining adverse health effects of psycho-
logical work factors, such as poor sleep.9,14,15 According to the 
DCS theory, the interaction between job demands and job 
control determines psychological well-being and health com-
plaints. More specifically, a combination of high job demands 
and low job control may result in negative health effects. How-
ever, this relationship is buffered by social and instrumental 
support from supervisors and/or colleagues. Research on the 
effects of work factors on sleep has almost exclusively been 
based on the DCS model; proposing that job strain (a combina-
tion of high job demands and low job control) and social sup-
port affect sleep.16–21
In one of the few longitudinal studies investigating work 
factors and sleep, Magnusson Hanson et al. reported a weak 
relationship between job demands and subsequent sleep.22 Ota

Psychosocial Work Factors and Sleep—Vleeshouwers et al.
and colleagues found that overcommitment to work (a trait-like 
factor) and high job strain (the combination of high demands 
and low control) increased the persistence of sleep problems 
in insomnia patients.23 However, the causal directions of these 
associations remain largely unknown, and sleep problems 
may influence the perception, appraisal, and reporting of work 
(“reverse” causality).22
The present study considered the relations between psycho-
logical/social work factors and sleep problems. A comprehen-
sive set of possible predictors was included, some of which 
have been associated with other health outcomes in the pre-
vious studies,24–28 and some of which are relatively novel in this 
field. While most previous studies have focused on a small set 
of fairly general and abstract factors (“stress,” demand, con-
trol), the current study focused on specific factors that should 
be amendable to modification, and could therefore be targeted 
in employee health and well-being interventions. Furthermore, 
the present study incorporated the two separate outcomes “dif-
ficulties initiating sleep” and “disturbed sleep” to reflect dif-
ferent aspects of sleep problems, both of which are considered 
symptoms of insomnia.6
The study adopted both univariable and multivariable 
cross-sectional and prospective regression models to explore 
possible effects over time within the complex relationship be-
tween work factors and sleep. Therefore analyses with baseline 
exposure as predictor, analyses with average exposure across 
two waves as predictor, and analyses with change in exposure 
between two waves as predictor were included.
METHODS
Design
This two-wave prospective study was part of the research 
project “The new workplace: Work, health, and participation 
in the new work life”—a project carried out by the Norwegian 
National Institute of Occupational Health. It is a repeated-mea-
sures web-based survey, encompassing data on background 
information, work organization, psychological and social work 
factors, coping strategies, attitudes towards work, personality 
dispositions, and mental and somatic health complaints. The 
current study is based on parts of this questionnaire. Within 
this project several work factors have been associated with 
health outcomes such as neck and back pain, headache, and 
mental distress.24–28
The mechanisms of putative impacts of psychological and 
social work factors on sleep are unknown and most likely di-
verse, and the nature of longitudinal effects of work factors 
on sleep are still underexplored.9,14,22 Moreover, the duration 
of exposure needed to produce effects is unknown—as is the 
expected duration of troubled sleep after exposure is discon-
tinued. Furthermore, these time periods may vary depending 
on the work factor. In order to capture some of this complexity 
both prospective and cross-sectional analyses were performed, 
with different ways of modeling exposure, which will be de-
scribed below.
Baseline (T1) data were collected from November 2004 
until November 2012, and follow-up data (T2) data were col-
lected from September 2006 until November 2014. For all 
participants follow-up data were collected approximately 2 
years after baseline.
Ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Com-
mittee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK), and the 
study followed strict guidelines as set by the Norwegian Data 
inspectorate, who approved the data collection and storage.
Participants
Data included respondents from 63 different companies, cov-
ering a wide range of job types. Participants were recruited at 
the organizational level. Participating organizations received 
reports and presentations both before and after measurements. 
Oral presentations of the general aims of the comprehensive 
research project were delivered prior to the survey, and stan-
dardized written reports, as well as oral presentations of results 
were given after the completion of the survey. The reports were 
generated by the same template for all organizations and did 
not focus specifically on sleep problems. Organizations may 
use information as developmental tools in order to improve the 
working conditions, but the researchers were not involved in 
any interventions.
Participants received an information letter including a 
unique code to complete the survey online or a paper version 
of the survey with a return envelope. Questionnaires could be 
completed at work or from home, although all participating 
companies were obligated to provide opportunities and time 
for their employees to complete the questionnaire during 
working hours.
At the time of analysis, a total of 12,659 participants had 
been invited to participate at both baseline and follow-up. Of 
the baseline respondent group, 7,459 (58.9%) completed at 
least one sleep item. These respondents formed the sample for 
the first cross-sectional analysis. Of the follow-up respondent 
group, 6,688 (52.8%) completed at least one sleep item. This 
group formed the sample for the second cross-sectional anal-
ysis. A total of 5,070 (40.1%) participants responded at both 
baseline and follow-up, of whom 44.9% were male and 55.1% 
were female (see Table 1 for sample characteristics).
Outcome: Sleep Measures
The two aspects of troubled sleep that were measured were 
(1) difficulties initiating sleep and (2) disturbed sleep. Items 
were measured and analyzed separately since these items re-
flect two distinctly separate symptoms within sleep disorder 
and insomnia research.6,29
The sleep question was worded as follows: “Have you ex-
perienced the following symptoms in the last 4 weeks?” with 
the following two items: “difficulties falling asleep” and “dis-
turbed sleep.” Response alternatives were as follows: “0 times,” 
“1–3 times per month,” “1–2 times per week,” “3–5 times per 
week,” and “6–7 times per week.” The two sleep items were 
highly correlated with a baseline correlation of ρ 0.68, P < 0.01.
Exposure Measures
Psychological and social work factors were measured with 
the General Nordic Questionnaire for Psychological and So-
cial Factors at Work (QPSNordic).30 The following factors were 
investigated: quantitative job demands (4 items, α coefficient

at baseline = 0.75 and α coefficient at follow-up = 0.76), deci-
sion demands (3 items, α = 0.63 and α = 0.63), decision con-
trol (5 items, α = 0.74 and α = 0.73), control of work pacing (4 
items, α = 0.82 and α = 0.82), role clarity (3 items, α = 0.82 and 
α = 0.81), role conflict (3 items, α = 0.70 and α = 0.70), predict-
ability during the next month (3 items, α = 0.62 and α = 0.65), 
support from superior (3 items, α = 0.86 and α = 0.73), empow-
ering leadership (3 items, α = 0.87 and α = 0.88), fair leader-
ship (3 items, α = 0.81 and α = 0.82), social climate (3 items, 
α = 0.71 and α = 0.72), commitment to the organization (3 items, 
α = 0.86 and α = 0.87), and positive challenges at work (3 items, 
α = 0.78 and α = 0.79). Items were measured with a 5-point 
Likert scale of frequency of occurrence ranging from “1 = very 
seldom or never” to “5 = very often or always,” with the excep-
tion of social climate which has answer categories ranging from 
“1 = very little or not at all” to “5 = very much,” and commit-
ment to the organization with answer categories from “1 = com-
pletely disagree” to “5 = completely agree.” In order to compare 
effects of the different levels of exposure, the scores were cate-
gorized as follows; scores between 1.00 and 1.80 received value 
“1,” 1.81–2.60 received value “2,” 2.61–3.40 received value “3,” 
3.41–4.20 received value “4,” and 4.21–5.00 received value “5.”
Confounders
Age, sex, skill level, and baseline levels of outcome mea-
sures were entered a priori in all regression analyses as po-
tential confounders. Age was categorized into 5 separate age 
groups; < 30, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and > 59. Skill level was 
determined through classification of occupation, and reflects 
the corresponding level of education or equivalent level of 
working experience for said occupation as described in the 
STYRK classifications, developed by Statistics Norway and 
based on the International Standard for Classification of Edu-
cation (ISCED-ISCO88). Categories ranged from occupations 
that require no more than 9 years of primary education to occu-
pations that normally require a first or postgraduate University 
degree, or college exams based on a similar length of study 
(> 15 years of education). Unspecified educations were also 
accounted for within a category, which is why skill level was 
treated as a nominal variable.
Prior to the main analyses steps were taken in order to es-
tablish the extent to which possible confounding work factors 
influenced the analyses. The procedure followed was recom-
mended by Rothman31 and is described by Christensen and 
Knardahl24,25 in similar studies. For both baseline sleep items, 
a series of separate univariable logistic regressions were con-
ducted with each exposure variable at baseline as predictor. 
After this, regressions were run with all other exposure vari-
ables entered separately for each single exposure variable. Odds 
ratios from the univariable and bivariable regressions were then 
compared and changes of 10% or more in the odds ratios when 
including another exposure variable would lead to that expo-
sure variable being treated as a confounder in all subsequent 
multivariable analyses for the relevant exposure measure.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics, ver-
sion 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Because of the large number of 
exposure measures and the multiple testing within the present 
study the risk of type I error increased. In order to attenuate 
the likelihood of type I error, 99% confidence intervals were 
increased and Bonferroni-adjusted, calculated as the overall 
significance level divided by the number of factors studied (i.e., 
0.01/13 = 0.0008); P values were also reported.
Cross-sectional analyses were conducted at baseline as well 
as follow-up. First univariable ordinal logistic regressions 
were performed for each exposure variable individually and 
for both outcome measures, after which multivariable ordinal 
logistic regressions, using the generalized linear models option 
within SPSS, were performed for both baseline and follow-up 
data and for both outcome measures.
Main analyses included prospective analyses with baseline 
exposure measures as predictors, average exposure as predic-
tors, and change in exposure as predictors (see details below). 
Estimated confounders as well as age, sex, skill level, and base-
line levels of outcome were included in multivariable analyses.

Psychosocial Work Factors and Sleep—Vleeshouwers et al.
In order to explore the effects of exposure over time, average 
exposure to the individual psychological/social work factors 
from baseline to follow-up was calculated by adding values 
at T1 to values at T2 and dividing these by 2. Additionally, in 
order to explore how increased, decreased, or unchanged dif-
ferent levels of exposure from baseline to follow-up affected 
difficulties initiating sleep and sleep disturbance, univariable 
and multivariable analyses were also carried out with change 
in exposure from baseline to follow-up as predictor. First, mea-
sures were trichotomized into “low” (scores of 1 and 2 on the 
categorized exposure variable), “middle” (scores of 3), and 
“high” (scores of 4 and 5), after which change within these cat-
egories between baseline and follow-up were reflected in the 
following categories: “constant low,” “constant middle,” “con-
stant high,” “decrease,” and “increase.”
RESULTS
Non-Response Analysis
A non-response analysis using binary logistic regression with 
sex and age as predictors showed that being in one of the age 
groups > 30 (e.g., age 30–39 OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.18–1.44) and 
being female (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.20–1.28) statistically signifi-
cantly (P < 0.05) increased the odds of responding to at least 
one sleep item at baseline (analyses not shown).
Attrition Analysis
A multivariable binary logistic regression with age, sex, sleep 
items at baseline, and all work factors as predictors showed a 
significant decrease in the odds of responding at both baseline 
and follow-up for those who had also responded at baseline, 
in the first two age groups (< 30 OR 0.68 and 30–39 OR 0.79) 
(analyses not shown). Decision demands (category 2 and 4), 
control of work pacing (category 1–2), role clarity (category 4), 
positive challenges at work (category 4), role conflict (cat-
egory 4), social climate (categories 2–4), and commitment to 
the organization (category 3–4) all exhibited independent, 
statistically significant positive associations with response at 
follow-up. Sex, difficulties initiating sleep, and disturbed sleep 
did not significantly alter the odds of responding at follow-up.
Cross-Sectional Analyses
Univariable regressions at baseline and follow-up were per-
formed, and details of which work factors showed significant 
associations can be found in the overview table (Table 2).
Multivariable regressions for “difficulties initiating sleep” at 
baseline (see Table S1A in the supplemental material) showed 
statistically significant associations (P < 0.01) for 10 of the 13 
work factors, of which 8 remained statistically significant after 
Bonferroni correction. At follow-up the same work factors 
showed statistically significant (P < 0.01) associations, with 
the addition of control of work pacing and positive challenges 
at work. Eight work factors remained statistically significant 
after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.0008). ORs were lowest for 
support from superior (OR 0.34, 99% CI 0.25–0.47 in category 
5 at baseline and OR 0.31, 99% CI 0.22–0.43 in category 5 at 
follow-up) and highest for role conflict (OR 4.75, 99% CI 3.36–
6.73 in category 5 at baseline and OR 4.27, 99% CI 2.88–6.32 
in category 5 at follow-up).
Multivariable regressions for sleep item “disturbed sleep” 
(see Table S1B in the supplemental material) at baseline 
showed statistically significant (P < 0.01) associations for all 
work factors apart from social climate. Two factors did not re-
main significant after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.0008). The 
same work factors showed statistically significant (P < 0.0008) 
associations at follow-up, apart from fair leadership (P > 0.01). 
All work factors remained statistically significant at follow-up 
after Bonferroni corrections. ORs were lowest for support from

and OR 0.29, 99% CI 0.21–0.41 in category 5 at follow-up) and 
highest for role conflict (OR 4.75, 99% CI 3.36–6.73 in cat-
egory 5 at baseline and OR 3.17, 99% CI 2.16–4.66 in category 
5 at follow-up).
Prospective Analyses
Baseline Exposure
Univariable regressions with baseline exposures as predictors 
were performed for both outcome measures, and showed sta-
tistically significant (P < 0.01) prospective associations with all 
work factors for “difficulties initiating sleep,” and for all work 
factors, except for control of work pacing for “disturbed sleep.” 
After Bonferroni corrections (P < 0.0008), 9 factors remained 
statistically significant for “difficulties initiating sleep,” while 
8 remained significant for “disturbed sleep.”
Multivariable regressions for “difficulties initiating sleep” 
with baseline exposure as predictor showed statistically sig-
nificant (P < 0.01) associations for quantitative job demands 
(OR 1.52, 99% CI 1.03–2.23), decision control (OR 0.53, 99% 
CI 0.35–0.82), role conflict (OR 2.04, 99% CI 1.28–3.25), and 
support from superior (OR 0.90, 99% CI 0.82–0.98) (Table 3A). 
However, quantitative job demands and support from supe-
rior did not remain statistically significant at P < 0.0008. ORs 
ranged from 0.53 at category 5 for decision control to 2.04 at 
category 5 for role conflict.
Multivariable regressions for “disturbed sleep” (Table 3B) 
with baseline exposure as predictor showed statistically sig-
nificant (P < 0.01) associations for quantitative job demands 
(OR 1.52, 99% CI 1.05–2.21), decision control (OR 0.71, 99% 
CI 0.52–0.96), role conflict (OR 1.73, 99% CI 1.09–2.74), and 
support from superior (OR 0.86, 99% CI 0.79–0.93). How-
ever, quantitative job demands and decision control did not 
remain statistically significant after Bonferroni correction 
(P < 0.0008). ORs ranged from 0.86 at category 5 for support 
from superior to 1.73 at category 5 for role conflict.
Average Exposure
Univariable logistic regressions were performed with average 
exposures as predictors for each follow-up sleep item. All av-
eraged work showed statistically significant (P < 0.01) asso-
ciations with both “difficulties initiating sleep” and “disturbed 
sleep.” Decision demands did not remain statistically signifi-
cantly associated with “difficulties initiating sleep” and “dis-
turbed sleep” at P < 0.0008, while predictability during the 
next month and social climate did not remain statistically sig-
nificantly associated with “disturbed sleep” at P < 0.0008.
Multivariable regressions for both “difficulties initiating 
sleep” and “disturbed sleep” with averaged exposures as pre-
dictors showed statistically significant (P < 0.01) associations 
for 7 out of 13 work factors (Table 3A and 3B). Of these quan-
titative job demands (OR 2.29, 99% CI 1.42–3.71), decision de-
mands (OR 1.19, 99% CI 1.05–1.34), role conflict (OR 3.75, 99% 
CI 1.87–7.52), and support from superior (e.g. OR 0.39, 99% CI 
0.22–0.70) remained statistically significantly associated with 
“difficulties initiating sleep” at P < 0.0008, while quantitative 
job demands (OR 2.35, 99% CI 1.47–3.77), decision control 
(0.57, 99% 0.40–0.81), role conflict (OR 2.88, 99% CI 1.47–
5.62), and support from superior (OR 0.33, 99% CI 0.19–0.59) 
remained statistically significantly associated with “disturbed 
sleep.” ORs for “difficulties initiating sleep” ranged from 0.39 
at category 5 for support from superior to 3.75 at category 5 
for role conflict. ORs for “disturbed sleep” ranged from 0.33 at 
category 5 for support from superior to 2.88 at category 5 for 
role conflict.
Change in Exposure
Univariable regressions with change in exposure as predictors 
and “difficulties initiating sleep” as outcome showed statisti-
cally significant associations for all work factors, even after 
Bonferroni corrections, except for decision demands, which 
remained statistically significant at P < 0.01. ORs ranged from 
0.60 (99% CI 0.46–0.80) for constant high social climate to 
1.84 (99% CI 1.26–2.68) for constant low support for superior. 
Univariable regressions with change in exposure as predictor 
and “disturbed sleep” as outcome showed statistically signifi-
cant associations for all work factors, however after Bonferroni 
corrections decision demands, control of work pacing, and so-
cial climate did not remain significant. ORs ranged from 0.66 
(99% CI 0.59–0.74) for constant high support from superior to 
1.98 (99% CI 1.44–2.70) for constant high role conflict.
Multivariable ordinal logistic regressions with change in 
exposure as predictor and “difficulties initiating sleep” as out-
come (Table 4) revealed significant associations for 6 of the 13 
work factors, and quantitative job demands (constant high, OR 
1.72, 99% CI 1.37–2.17), role conflict (constant high, OR 2.08, 
99% CI 1.45–2.96), and support from superior (constant high, 
OR 0.51, 99% CI 0.33–0.79) showed to be most robust asso-
ciations as these factors remained statistically significant after 
Bonferroni corrections.
The same analyses but with “disturbed sleep” as outcome 
(see Table 4), revealed significant associations for 5 of the 13 
work factors, with quantitative job demands (constant high, 
OR 1.60, 99% CI 1.28–2.01), decision control (constant high, 
OR 0.71, 99% CI 0.58–0.89), role conflict (constant high, OR 
1.83, CI 1.23–2.60), and support from superior (constant high, 
OR 0.52, 99% CI 0.34–0.80) remaining statistically significant 
after Bonferroni corrections.
An overview of statistically significant associations can be 
found in Table 2.
DISCUSSION
This study incorporated a broad range of analyses and utilized 
a full-panel prospective design in order to investigate the ex-
tent to which many specific psychological and social work fac-
tors predicted two elements of troubled sleep. Of the 13 work 
factors investigated, quantitative job demands, decision con-
trol, role conflict, and support from superior most consistently 
predicted sleep problems, as these factors exhibited robust sta-
tistically significant associations across all analyses. Commit-
ment to the organization was also a robust predictor of troubled 
sleep, showing significant associations in 9 of the total 10 anal-
yses. Decision demands, control of work pacing, role clarity, 
fair leadership, social climate, and positive challenges at work 
on the other hand show significant associations in 4 to 7 of the

10 analyses, but may nonetheless still be important predictors 
of troubled sleep.
While the diverse analyses have shown some minor dif-
ferences in associations between the work factors and the 
two measures of troubled sleep (e.g. social climate shows 
statistically significant associations with “difficulties initi-
ating sleep” in 7 of 10 analyses, but only shows statistically 
significant associations with “disturbed sleep” in 5 of 10 
analyses), there are no major differential effects, and the four 
strongest predictors are equally robust for both measures of 
sleeping problems.
Although previous studies have explored relations between 
work factors and sleep, to our knowledge this study is the 
first to reflect such a broad range of psychological/social work

factors and occupations while incorporating cross-sectional as 
well as prospective designs to investigate the effects over time. 
Findings from the present study showed that a number of dif-
ferent psychological and social work factors predicted difficul-
ties falling asleep and disturbed sleep.
Strengths of the present study are the broad set of specific 
psychological/social work factors and the large amount of 
different organizations and occupations included. Addition-
ally, the cross-sectional and prospective analyses of the present 
study explored different time frames of effects of the work fac-
tors on sleep, testing both immediate and longer-term effects.
Sleep may influence work factors, i.e., poor sleep may influ-
ence mood state and thus influence perceptions of work fac-
tors; however the prospective design used in the present study

troubled sleep. In fact, these two work factors were statistically 
significant in all our analyses, and quantitative job demands 
remained significant at P < 0.0008 in 9 of 10 analyses for both 
sleep outcome measures. Magnusson Hanson et al.22 discov-
ered positive associations between demands and subsequent 
sleep problems. However, they did not observe an effect of 
decision authority, while in the present study decision control 
was one of the strongest predictors of sleep problems.
While in the current study support from supervisor pre-
dicted subsequent disturbed sleep and difficulties initiating 
sleep, Ota and colleagues, and Magnusson Hanson and col-
leagues both did not find statistically significant effects of 
support on future sleep problems. However, Ota and col-
leagues suggested that support may predict persistence of in-
somnia when sleep problems already exist, while Magnusson 
Hanson and colleagues found effects of support on subse-
quent awakening problems.
Role conflict, the last of the four most consistent predictors 
identified within this study, has also been linked to sleep prob-
lems before. Nixon and colleagues in their meta-analysis of 79 
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies identified role conflict 
as significantly related to troubled sleep.32 However, only four 
studies with role conflict as a predictor had been analyzed, uti-
lizing a combined sample size of only 487 participants. More-
over, it is unclear if any of the studies analyzed are longitudinal. 
Therefore, examining effects of role conflict on sleep problems 
in a prospective analysis represented an important contribu-
tion to existing research.
As mentioned before, the present study was part of a large 
project carried out by the Norwegian National Institute of Oc-
cupational Health. Previous studies from this project have 
found associations between work factors and health outcomes 
such as neck and back pain, headache, and mental distress.24–28 
While some work factors seem to have associations with all 
investigated health outcomes, such as decision control, other 
work factors which the present study has found to be a strong 
predictor, such as quantitative job demands, do not show asso-
ciations with other health outcomes. Future research may want 
to explore interactions between work factors, sleep, and other 
health outcomes such as pain.

Psychosocial Work Factors and Sleep—Vleeshouwers et al.
The design of the QPSNordic (i.e., reversed items and scales 
based on frequency of occurrence) should have relieved poten-
tial issues with reporting bias. Type II error may have occurred 
due to possible over-adjustment, while on the other hand, in-
corporating continuous predictors in the prospective analyses 
should lower chances of type II error.
A priori power calculations were not conducted, since the 
dataset was available before commencement of the study. The 
sample was large, but there may be issues of power to detect 
statistically significant associations in some cases, particularly 
with categorical variables, as categorization results in informa-
tion loss. In the prospective analyses with “baseline exposure” 
and “average exposure,” we included analyses of exposure 
measures as continuous variables. In some cases, the contin-
uous exposure measures indicated effects that were not evident 
from the corresponding categorized exposure measures. For 
instance, when observing the effect of baseline levels of sup-
port from superior on difficulties initiating sleep (Table 3A), 
it seems reasonable to suspect that the nonsignificance of ef-
fects of specific levels of exposure is partly due to the limited 
number of employees reporting low support.
Effects on difficulties initiating sleep and sleep disturbance 
could occur at a threshold of the outcome variable. That is, the 
effect of aversive working conditions can be thought to mani-
fest only as severe sleep problems, such as insomnia, rather 
than rare or occasional sleeping difficulties. However, prior to 
analyses assumptions of ordinal logistic regression were tested, 
including the assumption of proportional odds, indicating that 
the difference in risk was proportional across all cut points of 
the outcome. Moreover, multinomial logistic regressions were 
performed for each separate exposure variable with every 
outcome category compared to “never” as reference category. 
Results indicated that there is a consistent incline in ORs for 
each level of the outcome variables, with no clear cutoff point, 
suggesting a linear change in risk.
An additional issue could be that there may be other fac-
tors at play, such as family life, economic situation, depres-
sion, or personality, which could have affected perceptions of 
work factors and therefore influenced sleep. While the present 
study has corrected for a large amount of confounding fac-
tors, future research may wish to incorporate other relevant 
confounders. For example, impaired daytime functioning, a 
key factor of insomnia, may be involved in the relationship 
between work factors and troubled sleep.33 Impaired daytime 
functioning may influence appraisal of working conditions, 
as well as interpersonal relationships and execution of tasks, 
which in turn may affect sleep. The scope of the current study 
did not permit detailed investigation of reciprocal causal pro-
cesses, so this remains an important task for future projects, 
and daytime functioning is one factor that could be included in 
such investigations. Also, assessing daytime functioning will 
provide valuable insight regarding the extent to which sleep 
problems affect health and quality of life.
Participating companies received reports and presentations 
of findings after each round of data collection. It is possible 
that organizations used this information to improve working 
conditions after T1, which could have had an effect on expo-
sure measures at T2. In order to take into account possible 
changes in exposure measures from T1 to T2, we incorporated 
the “average exposure as predictor” and “change in exposure” 
analyses. However, post hoc analyses revealed no significant 
differences in exposure measures between T1 and T2 in the 
overall sample (analyses not shown).
Associations found in change in exposure as a predictor 
may be interpreted in different ways. For example, constant 
high levels of quantitative job demands significantly predict 
troubled sleep. One could argue that this finding is irrelevant, 
as cross-sectional analyses had already established relations 
between quantitative job demands and the two sleep items. 
Constant high quantitative job demands could simply pick up 
the relation between high job demands at T2 and sleep at T2. 
However, when comparing the ORs of cross-sectional anal-
yses at follow-up to ORs of prospective analyses with change 
in exposure as predictor, the ORs for change in exposure are 
slightly higher (1.72 as compared to 1.29 for difficulties initi-
ating sleep, and 1.60 as compared to 1.32 for disturbed sleep). 
This may indicate the importance of work factors at baseline 
on future troubled sleep. Moreover, prospective effects of 
quantitative job demands were established in baseline expo-
sure as predictor and average exposure as predictor analyses. 
Change in exposure then gives insight in how adapting psy-
chological and social work factors may improve sleep, e.g., an 
increase in support from superior may improve difficulties 
initiating sleep (OR 0.53, 99% 0.34–0.83), while an increase 
in support from superior may improve disturbed sleep (OR 
0.63, 99% 0.40–0.97). Additionally, the effect of constant high 
demands was stronger than that of an increase, i.e., the ef-
fect of high exposure at both time points is stronger than the 
effect of high exposure only at follow-up. This suggests that 
repeated high exposure has greater consequences for sleep 
than high exposure at one time point, further strengthening 
assumptions of causality.
Åkerstedt and colleagues also investigated the effects of 
change in work factors over time on sleep, and suggested that 
constant high or an increase in demands may predict future 
sleep problems 5 years later.15 While the present study did find 
that constant high quantitative demands may predict both dif-
ficulties initiating and disturbed sleep, no significant results 
were found for increase in quantitative demands. Moreover, 
while Åkerstedt and colleagues concluded that change in con-
trol at work did not predict later onset of sleep difficulties, the 
present study found that constant low decision control may in 
fact predict future difficulties initiating and future disturbed 
sleep. Differences in findings may be due to the use of dif-
ferent timespans. The present findings are in concordance 
with those of Jansson and Linton,34 who discovered that high 
work demands and low influence over decisions were associ-
ated with the continuation of self-reported insomnia over the 
course of one year, and suggested these work factors, along 
with leader support, may predict onset and continuation of 
insomnia.
Although the present study with two-year interval indicated 
that work factors predict troubled sleep disturbance over time, 
the change in exposure analyses did not contain information 
about when or how such changes occurred. Gradual change 
from, e.g., high levels of role conflict to lower levels of role

conflict could have occurred due to an employee getting more 
acquainted with their role and what is expected from him/her, 
but immediate change could have also occurred, for instance 
due to a new superior or new role descriptions. Immediate 
change may have occurred directly after T1 measurements 
or right before T2 measurements. Potentially, the effects of 
change in work factors on sleep may weaken over time; how-
ever, it was outside the scope of the present study to test this. 
Future research should explore the details of how change in 
work factors may affect sleep, potentially through the use of 
time-series design.
In conclusion, findings from this prospective cohort study 
suggest that modifiable psychological and social work fac-
tors affect sleep, both short-term as well as over time. While 
quantitative job demands, decision control, role conflict, and 
support from superior were found to be the most robust predic-
tors of sleep problems, potential interventions to change em-
ployees’ appraisals of all work factors investigated may lead 
to improved sleep, which could in turn affect health, sickness 
absence, and productivity.
