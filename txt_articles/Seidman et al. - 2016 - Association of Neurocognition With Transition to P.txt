Abstract
Importance—Neurocognition is a central characteristic of schizophrenia and other psychotic 
disorders. Identifying the pattern and severity of neurocognitive functioning during the “near-
psychotic”, prodromal, clinical high-risk (CHR) state is necessary to develop accurate predictors 
of psychosis and more effective and potentially preventative treatments.

 Objective—Identify core neurocognitive dysfunctions associated with the CHR phase, and 
measure the ability of neurocognitive tests to predict the transition to psychosis. Determine if the 
neurocognitive deficits are robust or explained by potential confounders.
Design—Case control study. Baseline neurocognitive functioning collected from 2008–2012 in 
the second phase of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS-2).
Setting—A consortium of eight university-based, outpatient programs studying the psychosis 
prodrome in North America.
Participants—CHR individuals (n=689) and healthy controls (HCs, n=264) consisting of 137 
male and 127 female HC and 398 male and 291 female CHR individuals ages 12–35.
Interventions or Exposures—A naturalistic, observational study.
Main Outcome and Measure(s)—Neurocognitive differences between those who did and did 
not transition to psychosis, differences between medicated and unmedicated groups, and time to 
conversion. Nineteen neuropsychological tests and four factors derived from factor analysis.
Results—The factors were Executive Function/Visual-Spatial, Verbal, Attention/Working 
Memory, and Declarative Memory. Amongst widespread mild to moderate impairments, CHR 
individuals were significantly impaired compared to HCs on Attention/Working Memory and 
Declarative Memory. CHR converters had large Declarative Memory and Attention/Working 
Memory deficits (Cohen’s d = ~0.8, p <.001) compared with controls and were significantly worse 
on these dimensions than non-converters. In Cox regression, impaired Declarative Memory and 
high Verbal (premorbid) ability in addition to age, site and positive psychotic symptoms, 
significantly predicted time to conversion in those who later transitioned to psychosis. The pattern 
of impairments could not be accounted for by premorbid or current general cognitive ability, 
medications, current depression, alcohol or cannabis abuse.
Conclusions and Relevance—Neurocognitive impairment is a robust characteristic of CHR 
individuals, especially those who later develop psychosis. Tests tapping verbal and visual 
declarative memory and attention/working memory were most sensitive to imminent psychosis 
amongst those at CHR. Interventions targeting the enhancement of neurocognitive functioning are 
warranted in this population.

INTRODUCTION
Neurocognitive dysfunction is a hallmark feature of schizophrenia1–5 and, to a lesser extent, 
of other psychoses6; a conceptualization originating roughly 100 years ago7 with Kraepelin8 
and Bleuler9. There is ample evidence of significant but milder impairments during the 
premorbid phase10–12, greater deficits during the prodromal or clinical high risk (CHR) 
period,13–15 culminating in relatively severe deficits in the first episode16 and chronic 
phases17. This suggests an evolution of neurocognitive dysfunction in individuals developing 
psychosis, especially schizophrenia10,14,18,19. The CHR20 period is of considerable interest

 because it offers a temporal window into the changes occurring during the “near-psychotic” 
state, before confounders such as chronicity and long-term medication use cloud the picture.
A substantial body of neurocognitive research in CHR populations has been summarized in 
a number of meta-analyses13–15. “Small-to-medium effect size (ES) impairments across 
most neurocognitive domains studied (Cohen’s d = −0.26 to −0.67) and small-to-large ESs 
(d = −0.35 to −0.84) in those who convert to psychosis (CHR+C)” have been reported14. 
Verbal memory and processing speed have emerged as relatively strong predictors of 
psychosis13,14,21–24. However, small samples, different measures, and variable reporting of 
sample characteristics limit the reliability of these findings. In this second phase of the North 
American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS-2), we assessed the largest CHR sample to 
date.
First, we sought to identify the key neurocognitive functions impaired in the CHR stage, 
especially in those who later convert to psychosis. Descriptions of schizophrenia place 
considerable emphasis on the centrality of dysfunctions in attention1,2,25,26 and working 
memory27,28. Evidence of severe deficits in declarative memory29 has more recently 
emerged in first episode16,30,31 and CHR14,21,22 samples. Olfactory identification deficits 
have also been touted as a possible risk factor32,33 and processing speed34 and general 
cognitive ability have been shown to be robustly impaired in persons who later develop 
schizophrenia.10,14 We chose to provide extensive coverage of neurocognitive dimensions 
thought a priori to mark the evolution into frank psychosis.
Second, we investigated if the neurocognitive profiles were characterized by a general deficit 
syndrome or specific impairments35. This is of particular relevance for those individuals 
who transition to psychotic disorders as it provides critical information about the nature of 
neurocognition in the earliest phase of psychosis36. We hypothesized that the CHR+C group 
would be characterized by especially salient deficits against a background of general 
impairments.
Third, we examined differences between medicated and unmedicated CHR individuals. 
Many of these young people take a range of medications including antipsychotics.37 Such 
medications could improve or impair cognition idiosyncratically. Prior CHR neurocognitive 
studies have not systematically addressed medication status. The large sample in NAPLS-2 
enabled an investigation of a sizeable subgroup of CHR+C individuals who have never been 
medicated, and thus help to identify an unadulterated picture of neurocognitive function.
Finally, we explored the potential usefulness of neurocognition for predicting transition to 
psychosis. While it is unlikely that neurocognitive measures will be highly predictive by 
themselves of conversion to psychosis, in part because they are impaired in many 
neuropsychiatric disorders38,39, knowing their relative sensitivities in combination with 
clinical features may help in the real-world prediction of psychosis or disability24,40,41.

 METHODS
Participants
NAPLS-2 is a consortium of eight programs studying the psychosis prodrome in North 
America, as in NAPLS-1. The methodology and clinical features of the NAPLS-2 study are 
detailed elsewhere42,43. From a sample of 764 CHR participants and 279 healthy controls 
(HCs) ranging in age from 12–35, 689 CHR and 264 HC participants provided baseline 
neurocognitive data. The study protocols and informed consents were approved by the 
ethical review boards of all sites, and all procedures comply with the ethical standards of the 
relevant committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration, as revised 
in 2008.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The CHR sample met the Criteria of Prodromal Syndromes (COPS)20, based on the 
Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes (SIPS)20, or if under age 19, criteria for 
schizotypal personality disorder (n=21) or COPS. Participants were excluded if they had a 
lifetime Axis I psychotic disorder, estimated IQ’s < 70 on both measures of IQ, a central 
nervous system disorder, or DSM-IV substance dependence in the past 6 months. Other non-
psychotic DSM-IV disorders were not exclusionary (e.g., substance abuse disorder, major 
depression) unless they clearly caused or better accounted for prodromal symptoms. 
Antipsychotic medications were allowed, provided there was clear evidence that psychotic 
symptoms were not present when the medication was started. HCs could not meet criteria 
for any prodromal syndrome, current or past psychotic or Cluster A personality disorder, or 
have first-degree relatives with a history of psychotic disorder or psychotic symptoms.
Measures
The SCID was used to rule out psychosis and to identify DSM-IV Axis I or cluster A 
disorders.44 For some analyses, we used a rescaled sum of unusual thought content/
delusional ideas (P1) and suspiciousness/persecutory ideas items (P2) from the SIPS positive 
symptoms45. Transition to psychosis was determined by meeting SIPS Presence of Psychotic 
Symptoms (POPS) criteria20. Assessments were at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Current 
alcohol and marijuana use was assessed with the Alcohol and Drug Use Scale (AUS/
DUS46). The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS47,48) was used to assess 
depression.
The neuropsychological battery was designed to cover a range of functions using well-
established clinical neuropsychological tests, as well as experimental measures of sensory, 
perceptual, or cognitive functions hypothesized to be important indicators of CHR status or 
conversion to psychosis. These included the MATRICS battery49–52, the Wechsler 
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) for general intellectual ability53 and the Wide 
Range Achievement Test-4 (WRAT-4) reading task to estimate premorbid ability54. 
Experimental measures included the Babble test (for auditory perception55), the University 
of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT56) for olfactory identification, a visual and 
verbal paired associate memory test (PAM57), and three auditory attention & working 
memory continuous performance tests (ACPT58–60). One summary measure from each test

 was chosen a priori as the best estimate of the function of that test. We factor analyzed (FA) 
the test battery to reduce the number of variables. Supplementary (S) text and Table S1 
provide extensive detail on the battery.
Statistical Analysis
We examined missing data prior to implementing multiple imputation (MI)61,62. From a 
sample of 1043, 953 received baseline neurocognitive testing (91.4%). Of the CHR sample 
that transitioned to psychosis during the two-year follow-up (n=93), 89 received testing 
(95.7%). Overall data completeness for the tested sample (n=953) was 96.6% for 19 test 
variables. After MI, we conducted a FA of the 19 neurocognitive variables (see 
Supplementary text). All analyses were done with SPSS, version 23.63
Groups were HCs, CHR converters (CHR+C) and non-converters (CHR-NC). T-tests, 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z and Chi Square tests were used to assess demographic 
comparability. Due to differences in age and maternal education, we controlled for both 
using MANCOVA and also controlled for site as a random effects factor with a linear mixed 
model. We covaried for estimated and premorbid IQ to test the role of general intellectual 
ability in cognitive dysfunctions. We compared medicated vs. nonmedicated groups of CHR
+C vs HC, and CHR+C vs CHR-NC by conducting MANOVA with planned comparisons 
using residualized factor scores generated from the linear mixed models.
To examine group cognitive profiles we residualized out age and maternal education from all 
neurocognitive indices (four factors derived from FA). Area under the curve (AUC) was 
calculated by the ROC program in SPSS. Prediction of conversion to psychosis and time to 
conversion was assessed by logistic and Cox regression. Covariates were selected based on 
similar prediction analyses conducted in NAPLS-164 and NAPLS-245 and entered into the 
model if they were associated with survival time and predicted conversion status in logistic 
regression. Survival time was time to the last SIPS interview or conversion, whichever 
occurred first. Candidate covariates were added to the model as a block then subjected to 
backward selection with a criterion p value of 0.10. Candidates that survived at p ≤ .05 
within domain were entered into an omnibus model. ESs were calculated with Cohen’s d. 
Bonferroni corrected significance for mean comparisons was set for individual tests at p<.
00263 (.05/19) and for factors at p< .0125 (.05/4).
RESULTS
Demographics (Table 1)
There were 137 male and 127 female HCs and 398 male and 291 female CHR individuals. 
HCs were significantly older, had significantly more education, and HC mothers had 
significantly more education. The groups did not differ in sex or race distribution, father’s 
education, or ethnicity. There were no significant differences on any demographic 
characteristic between CHR+C and CHR-NC groups.

 Clinical (Table 1)
Groups did not significantly differ in frequency of alcohol or marijuana use or on 
depression. There were no significant correlations between these clinical characteristics and 
neurocognitive factors. The CHR+C group had a significantly shorter follow-up period than 
the CHR-NC subgroup, reflecting time to conversion and attrition. CHR+C and CHR-NC 
subjects received a variety of medications including anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, 
stimulants, and others, but there were no significant differences in rates between the two 
CHR groups.
Factor Analysis (Table 2)
Supplementary text explains factor selection. The factors (F) were: F1 – Executive Function 
(EF)/Visual-Spatial; F2 – Verbal; F3 – Attention/Working Memory (WM); F4- Declarative 
Memory. Two tests laden with sensory-perceptual processes (olfaction and audition) had 
very low (UPSIT) or negligible loadings (Babble) initially and were dropped from the FA. 
They were analyzed with the other individual tests. The bivariate correlations among tests 
are in Table S2.
Neurocognition Group Comparisons: CHR vs. Controls (Table 3)
The CHR group performed significantly worse than HCs on all 19 tests combined 
(MANOVA F [19, 933] = 6.71, p < .001), on the four factors combined (F [4, 948] = 24.18, 
p < .001) and controlling for age, maternal education, and site on 2/4 factors, Attention/WM 
[1,948]=56.52, p< .001; Declarative Memory F[1,948]=22.83, p<.001) and on 14/19 
individual tests. The largest ES (Attention/WM) was of moderate magnitude. The average 
ES across the 19 tests was small, d = 0.30. Model-corrected profiles are shown in Figure 1. 
Controlling separately for WASI IQ and WRAT4 Reading, Attention/WM and Declarative 
Memory factors remained significantly different between groups. CHR-HC differences 
remained significant on 12/14 individual tests covarying WRAT Reading. Covarying WASI 
IQ yielded fewer significant differences.
CHR+C vs. Controls
CHR+C participants performed significantly worse than HCs (F [19,333] =5.95, p < .001) 
using all tests. The four factor MANOVA (F [4, 348] = 22.82, p < .001) showed significant 
differences. In models controlling for age, site, and maternal education, CHR+C subjects 
performed significantly worse on 3/4 factors: Attention/WM (d = 0.80), Declarative Memory 
(d = 0.77), and EF/Visual-Spatial (d = 0.36). The average ES across the 19 tests was d= 0.47. 
Figure 2 illustrates model adjusted ESs. CHR+C subjects performed significantly worse on 
Attention/WM, Verbal, and Declarative Memory and 12/14 individual tests after controlling 
for WRAT Reading. They showed fewer significant test differences after covarying WASI 
IQ.
Impairments were comparable comparing 252 currently unmedicated HCs with 51 
unmedicated CHR+Cs, with 38 currently medicated CHR+Cs, and between 236 never 
medicated HCs with 29 never medicated CHR+Cs. The smaller group of CHR+C’s on 
antipsychotic medications was significantly impaired on Attention/WM and Declarative 
Memory compared to HCs. Moreover, there were no significant cognitive differences

 between currently unmedicated CHR+Cs vs. medicated CHR+Cs, or between never 
medicated CHR+Cs vs. medicated CHR+Cs, or between CHR+Cs with and without 
antipsychotic medications. (Supplementary Text, Table S3 and Figure S1 for details).
CHR+C vs. CHR-NC (table 3)
The CHR+C group performed significantly worse than CHR-NC (MANOVA F [19,669] = 
1.90, p = .01; four factor MANOVA F [4, 684] = 6.51, p < .001), specifically on Attention/
Working Memory (d=.28) and Declarative Memory (d = 0.48) after controlling for age, site, 
and maternal education. CHR+C performed significantly worse in mixed linear model 
contrasts only on BVMT-R (d = 0.40) and PAM (d = 0.39). The average ES across the 19 
tests was d = 0.20. Covarying WASI IQ and WRAT Reading, CHR+C’s performed 
significantly better on Verbal, and worse on Declarative Memory, and on the BVMT-R and 
PAM tasks.
Prediction Analyses (see Supplementary text)
After exploring a range of possible predictors, Age (b = −.10, Hazard Ratio [HR] = .90, 95% 
Confidence Interval [CI] = .84–.97, p = .003, P1/P2 symptoms (b = .44, HR = 1.56, 95% CI 
= 1.36–1.78, p <.001) and dummy codes for 3 sites were retained. The Verbal (b = .40, HR = 
1.48, 95% CI = 1.08–2.04, p =.02) and Declarative Memory (b = −.87, HR = .42, 95% CR 
= .31–.56, p <.001) factors were retained. Similar results were observed in logistic 
regression analyses predicting conversion. Cox regression was then run with strongest 
loading individual component tests (BVMT-R, HVLT-R, and PAM for Declarative Memory; 
WRAT4 Reading and WASI-Vocabulary for Verbal). All covariates were retained, as were 
BVMT-R (b = .05, HR = .95, 95% CI = .91–.99, p = .009), HVLT-R (b = −.05, HR = .95, 
95% CI = .91–1.00, p = .04), WRAT4 Reading (b = .05, HR = 1.05, 95% CR = 1.01–1.10, p 
= .009) and PAM (b = −1.83, HR = .16, 95% CI = .05–.54, p = .003). Declarative Memory 
had the highest AUC (.624) followed by Attention/WM (AUC = .568). The highest AUCs 
for Declarative Memory tests were PAM (.607), BVMT-R (.604), and HVLT-R (.576) and 
for Attention/WM were BACS Symbol Coding (.584), Trails A (.582), ACPT Q3A Memory 
(.579) and ACPT QA Vigilance (.568) (Table S4).
DISCUSSION
In the largest and most detailed study of CHR prodromal cases, using a multi-site, case-
control design and standardized assessments, we demonstrated that individuals at CHR were 
impaired in virtually all neurocognitive dimensions compared to controls, and this could not 
be accounted for by premorbid or current general cognitive ability, current depression, 
medications, alcohol or cannabis abuse. ESs in comparison to HCs for Declarative Memory 
and Attention/WM were large (d=~0.8) for CHR+C participants. Compared to CHR-NC, 
CHR+C participants were significantly impaired in Attention/WM and Declarative Memory, 
the latter significantly predicting conversion to psychosis and time to event in concert with 
positive symptoms. Comparable impairments were observed in never-medicated and 
currently unmedicated CHR-NCs and CHR+C’s. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of 
neurocognitive function as a component risk marker for psychosis.

 Our findings support theoretical models hypothesizing Attention/WM impairments, and 
even more strongly, impaired Declarative Memory, as central to the CHR stage.20–22 The 
results are consistent with NAPLS-1, in which Declarative Memory had the largest ES 
decrement and roughly the same magnitude in CHR+C.13,14 The distinct profile of 
performance across domains, especially in CHR+C, suggests that at the incipient psychotic 
phase, specific forms of neurocognition are affected and are predictive of later psychosis.
Within CHR participants, there was considerable variability in neurocognitive performance. 
CHR-NC’s impairments (mean d = 0.30), were on the order of other psychiatric disorders in 
young people, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)65. CHR+Cs 
impairments (mean d = 0.47) were approximately 57% larger, although smaller than those 
observed in first episode schizophrenia16 (Table S5). Analyses of individual variability and 
longitudinal analyses are needed to identify how profile and severity differ according to 
comorbid disorders, final diagnoses (e.g., schizophrenia vs. bipolar psychosis) and pre- and 
post-conversion.
A key question was how neurocognitive deficits are associated with medication status. 
Psychotropic-naive and unmedicated subgroups had significant impairments comparable to 
the overall CHR subgroups. Treated groups, including with antipsychotic medications, were 
largely comparable to those without treatment, except they had somewhat greater 
Attention/WM impairment. These observations emphasize the essential nature of 
neurocognitive impairment in the CHR stage and de-emphasize the role of medications as 
confounders in our results. Our design precludes conclusions about causality and future 
work should study the effect of medications on neurocognition in CHR populations in a 
prospective design.
There were a number of other potentially important observations. The unexpectedly higher 
Verbal score (reflecting WRAT4 Reading) that was retained in logistic and Cox regressions 
in concert with impaired Declarative Memory was not a significant predictor in univariate 
comparisons. This pattern of high verbal premorbid ability and impaired memory, coupled 
with P1/P2 composite appears to be a pernicious combination predicting conversion and 
needs replication. Importantly, the BVMT-R (a visual-memory test) showed comparably 
large impairments as the two verbal memory tasks, highlighting that Declarative Memory 
deficits in CHR are not solely verbal, and that Declarative Memory impairments are key 
neurocognitive risk markers66.
Neurocognitive tests used in concert with other clinical and psychobiological measures may 
enhance prediction of psychosis or functional outcome. For example, in analyses limited to 
two tests selected from literature review14 prior to these neuropsychological analyses, 
NAPLS-2 investigators found that the HVLT-R and BACS Symbol Coding added modest but 
significant independent predictive power above the clinical measures in a risk calculator 
algorithm for psychosis conversion45 and this was replicated in an independent non-NAPLS 
sample67. Similar results have been observed in other studies24,40,41. In this study, we 
showed that other tests, including BVMT-R, PAM, and ACPT QA Vigil added significant 
independent variance beyond P1-P2 symptoms, augmenting the importance of 
neurocognitive markers.

 Strengths and Limitations
NAPLS-2, because of its large sample from diverse geographical areas, extensive 
neurocognitive coverage, remarkably complete neurocognitive dataset, and large never-
medicated sample, allowed for a strong confirmation of neurocognitive hypotheses. The 
NAPLS-2 study built upon and improved the NAPLS-1 assessment, confirming and 
expanding prior results (Table S5). This broad range of measures expanded the scope of 
what is known about CHR neurocognition.
Limitations include the fact that most of these tests and factors are complex. Thus, while 
Declarative Memory is clearly affected, the tasks tapping this domain cannot parse the 
specific mechanisms underlying the deficits. Further research with more molecular measures 
of cognition, such as those developed by CENTRACS68, may allow specification of the 
cognitive processes underlying the deficits. We did not randomize or counterbalance the 
order of tests, so we cannot rule out order effects. However, the most impaired tasks were 
spread out across the battery from the sixth to the last tests in the battery so there is no 
obvious fatigue effect.
Conclusions
Neurocognitive impairment is common in CHR individuals, and of clinically meaningful 
magnitude, especially in those who later develop psychosis. Declarative Memory and 
Attention/WM are important targets for early cognitive enhancing interventions with this 
population69–73.

1Nineteen tests were administered in the study. The Babble task did not correlate meaningfully with any of the other tasks, and the UPSIT was 
weakly correlated. Both loaded very weakly in initial Factor Analyses, and thus they were both excluded from the final Factor Analysis.
Bolded numbers are those with factor loadings of .40 or larger
Factor 1: Executive/Visual-Spatial
Factor 2: Verbal
Factor 3: Attention/Working Memory
Factor 4: Declarative Memory
