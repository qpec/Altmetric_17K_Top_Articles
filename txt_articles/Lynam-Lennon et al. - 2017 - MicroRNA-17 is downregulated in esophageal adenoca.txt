ABSTRACT
Resistance to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) remains a critical 
barrier to the effective treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Cancer stem-
like cells (CSCs) are a distinct subpopulation of cells implicated in the resistance 
of tumors to anti-cancer therapy. However, their role in the resistance of EAC to 
CRT is largely unknown. In this study, using a novel in vitro isogenic model of 
radioresistant EAC, we demonstrate that radioresistant EAC cells have enhanced 
tumorigenicity in vivo, increased expression of CSC-associated markers and enhanced 
holoclone forming ability. Further investigation identified a subpopulation of cells 
that are characterised by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, enhanced 
radioresistance and decreased expression of miR-17-5p. In vitro, miR-17-5p was 
demonstrated to significantly sensitise radioresistant cells to X-ray radiation and 
promoted the repression of genes with miR-17-5p binding sites, such as C6orf120. 
In vivo, miR-17-5p was significantly decreased, whilst C6orf120 was significantly 
increased, in pre-treatment EAC tumour samples from patients who demonstrated 
a poor response to neoadjuvant CRT. This study sheds novel insights into the role 
of CSCs in the resistance of EAC to CRT and highlights miR-17-5p as a potential 
biomarker of CRT sensitivity and novel therapeutic target in treatment resistant EAC.
INTRODUCTION
Esophageal cancer occurs worldwide and confers 
a dismal prognosis. In recent decades, there has been 
a dramatic epidemiological shift in the incidence of 
esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), with rates rising 
by 600% over the last 30 years [1]. EAC is now the 
predominant histological subtype in Europe and the 
United States. This increase is linked to key lifestyle 
factors, such as obesity, and incidence is expected to 
increase at a similar rate in the coming decades [2]. 
Despite improvements in surveillance and diagnosis, the 
overall cure rate for esophageal cancer is less than 17%, 
and 39% for localized disease, and results in over 400,000 
estimated deaths globally each year [1].
Consequently, a multi-modal approach to treatment 
has been developed, with neoadjuvant chemoradiation 
therapy (CRT) followed by surgery increasingly becoming 
a standard of care in North America and Europe [3]. 
The tumor response to neoadjuvant CRT is currently 
the best predictor of overall and disease-free survival, 
with the attainment of a complete pathological response 
(pCR) associated with a five-year survival rate of up 
to 60% [4]. Whilst higher pCR rates are achieved with 
CRT than with induction chemotherapy alone [5, 6], 
unfortunately, approximately 70% of patients receiving 
neoadjuvant treatment show moderate or no response [7]. 
Consequently, this sub-group of patients are unnecessarily 
subjected to CRT-associated adverse events, including 
an increased risk of surgical complications [8, 9], as

well as a delay to surgery, which can ultimately worsen 
prognosis and increase clinical expense [10]. Presently, 
standard clinicopathological factors do not predict 
treatment response and there are currently no predictive 
markers used routinely in the clinic. In addition, for those 
majority of EAC patients resistant to current standard CRT 
regimens, there are no alternative treatment strategies. 
Therefore, the need for both validated biomarkers 
predicting response to treatment and the development 
of novel treatment strategies to boost tumor responses to 
neoadjuvant CRT is currently unmet.
Current standard anti-cancer therapies, such as 
neoadjuvant CRT, have been developed and evaluated 
for their effectiveness in debulking the primary tumor. 
However, increasing evidence supports the hierarchical 
organization of cancers with a low frequency minority 
population of cancer cells with stem-like properties, 
currently termed cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). These 
CSCs are considered critical in the maintenance of tumors, 
and can be characterised predominantly by their ability to 
self-renew, repopulate a tumor following treatment with 
conventional cytotoxics and radiation and initiate and 
promote metastatic growth [11]. CSCs represent a distinct 
cell population, which have been clearly demonstrated 
to be a predominant cause of tumor resistance to CRT 
treatment [12]. Increasing evidence supports a role for 
CSCs in the pathogenesis and prognosis of esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma [13–15], however, the role of 
CSCs in EAC is largely undetermined. The elucidation 
of CSC-related molecular pathways associated with 
resistance to CRT may identify both novel biomarkers 
predicting treatment response and novel therapeutic targets 
for improved treatment strategies in EAC. Increasing 
evidence suggests that the pro-tumorigenic properties of 
CSCs may result from epigenetic and post-transcriptional 
alterations, which alter multiple signalling pathways [16, 
17]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of novel non-
coding RNA, which function to regulate gene expression 
[18]. MiRNA expression is intimately involved in 
tumorigenesis and cancer biology [18, 19] and evidence 
supports their role as regulators of the CSC phenotype 
[20]. We have previously demonstrated a role for miRNAs 
in the response of EAC to both X-ray radiation and 
chemotherapy [21–23], highlighting miRNAs as both 
potential predictive biomarkers of response and novel 
therapeutic targets to enhance the tumor response to 
treatment in EAC. However, the contribution of miRNAs 
in regulating CSC properties in EAC is largely unknown.
This study investigated the role of CSCs in the 
treatment resistance of EAC, utilising both novel in vitro 
models of radioresistant and chemoresistant EAC and 
tumour biopsies from EAC patients. The data demonstrate 
that radioresistant EAC cells have enhanced tumorigenicity 
in vivo, increased expression of CSC-associated markers 
and enhanced holoclone forming ability. Furthermore, this 
study identifies for the first time, a subpopulation of CSCs 
in EAC, which are characterised by increased ALDH 
activity, enhanced resistance to radiation and decreased 
expression of miR-17-5p. We also demonstrate for the first 
time that miR-17-5p functionally modulates sensitivity to 
radiation in vitro in EAC cells and alters expression of 
predicted miR-17-5p target genes, such as C6orf120. In 
vivo, miR-17-5p is significantly decreased, whilst target 
gene expression is significantly increased in pre-treatment 
tumour biopsies from patients who have a poor response 
to neoadjuvant CRT. Our data highlight a potential role 
for miR-17-5p as a predictive marker of response to 
neoadjuvant CRT and novel therapeutic target to enhance 
efficacy of CRT in EAC.
RESULTS
Radioresistant OE33 R cells demonstrate 
enhanced tumorigenicity in mice
To investigate the role of CSCs in the 
radioresistance of EAC, we utilised an isogenic cell line 
model of radioresistant EAC, previously generated in our 
laboratory [24]. The radioresistant OE33 R subline, which 
was generated by chronic irradiation with clinically-
relevant fractionated doses of 2 Gy X-ray radiation, 
displays significantly enhanced resistance to radiation, 
when compared to its radiosensitive OE33 parent (OE33 
P) cell line [24]. These two cell lines, of the same origin 
but with distinctly different radiosensitivities, provide a 
unique model with which to investigate the molecular 
determinants of response to radiation in EAC.
To investigate the tumorigenicity of this novel 
isogenic model in vivo, OE33 P and OE33 R cells 
were transplanted subcutaneously into the flank 
of immunocompromised NOD SCID mice. Mice 
were monitored weekly for tumor growth. OE33 R 
cells demonstrated higher tumorigenic potential; 
this manifested as higher graft success rates and 
corresponded to shorter latency and larger tumor 
volumes with respect to time, when compared to OE33 
P cells (Figure 1A and 1B).
OE33 R cells produced palpable tumors in all 
animals transplanted (n=3) by day 30 post transplantation. 
By day 78 post transplantation, OE33 R cells had 
produced tumors with an average diameter of 9.8 mm. In 
contrast, OE33 P cells produced a palpable tumor in only 
one of the 3 transplanted animals, which at day 78 post 
transplantation had reached an average tumor diameter of 
1 mm. As this isogenic model of radioresistance originates 
from the same OE33 cell line, the inherent genetic 
variation between OE33 P and OE33 R is reduced, when 
compared to using cell lines of different origin. Therefore, 
this may suggest that the enhanced tumorigenicity 
 Oncotarget

demonstrated by OE33 R cells is due to alterations in the 
biology of the population of cells, or a subpopulation of 
cells, such as CSCs, which have the ability to drive tumor 
growth, rather than alterations in specific gene/protein 
drivers of oncogenesis.
Radioresistant OE33 R cells demonstrate 
enhanced ‘stemness’ properties
To investigate if the enhanced tumorigenicity 
demonstrated by OE33 R cells in vivo may indeed be 
due to an enriched CSC population, we assessed several 
‘stemness’ properties in OE33 R and OE33 P cells. 
Expression of the putative CSC markers ALDH1 and 
β-catenin, which are implicated in the regulation of CSCs 
[25], was investigated in OE33 P and OE33 R cells by 
qPCR. Expression of both ALDH1 and β-catenin was 
significantly increased in OE33 R cells, when compared 
to OE33 P (Figure 2A and Figure 2B), suggesting 
an enrichment of CSCs in the OE33 R cell line. To 
further investigate this, the holoclone forming ability of 
OE33 P and OE33 R cells was assessed at basal level 
and following irradiation with 2 Gy X-ray radiation. 
Holoclones are colonies with distinct morphology, which 
are capable of extensive proliferation and self-renewal and 
are demonstrated to be enriched for CSCs [26]. Both OE33 
P and OE33 R cells formed holoclones, which displayed 
characteristic morphology (Figure 2C). However, the 
potential for holoclone formation was significantly 
higher in radioresistant OE33 R cells, when compared to 
radiosensitive OE33 P cells, both basally and following 
irradiation with 2 Gy (Figure 2D). Together, these data 
suggest that OE33 R cells are enriched for CSCs, which 
may be an important feature underlying their enhanced 
tumorigenicity in vivo and resistance to X-ray radiation 
in vitro.
Radioresistant and chemoresistant EAC cells are 
enriched for an ALDH+ve cell population
Given the significantly increased expression of 
ALDH1 mRNA in OE33 R cells (Figure 2A), we assessed 
if ALDH activity was also increased in OE33 R cells, 
using flow cytometry. Supporting the alterations at mRNA 
level, radioresistant OE33 R had a significantly higher 
percentage of ALDH+ve cells (49%), when compared to 
radiosensitive OE33 P (32%) (Figure 3A and 3B), again 
suggesting that OE33 R cells are enriched for CSCs. To 
investigate if this increase in ALDH+ve cells was specific 
to radioresistant cells, we also assessed ALDH activity in 
an isogenic EAC cell line model of cisplatin resistance. To 
generate this isogenic model of cisplatin resistance, OE33 
cells were treated with 1 μM cisplatin until the emergence 
of a cisplatin resistant sub-line, termed OE33 CisR, having 
received 21 cycles of cisplatin treatment. OE33 CisR cells 
demonstrated a significant increase in surviving fraction 
following treatment with 1 μM cisplatin, when compared to 
their vehicle controlled age- and passage-matched cisplatin 
sensitive counterpart, termed OE33 CisP (Supplementary 
Figure 1). Interestingly, OE33 CisR cells demonstrated a 
significantly higher percentage of ALDH+ve cells (56%), 
when compared to OE33 CisP cells (25%) (Figure 3C), 
supporting a role for ALDH+ve CSCs in the resistance of 
these cells to cisplatin. Importantly, when ALDH activity 
was assessed in OE33 cells that received only 15 cycles 
of cisplatin treatment (OE33 Cis15), and do not display 
resistance to cisplatin compared with control (data not 
shown), there was no significant increase in ALDH activity 
(Figure 3C), further supporting a role for ALDH activity 
in the acquired resistance to cisplatin in EAC cells. Taken 
together, these data suggest that enrichment of ALDH+ve 
CSCs is associated with resistance to X-ray radiation and 
cisplatin in EAC cells.

OE33 R ALDH+ve cells demonstrate enhanced 
radioresistance compared with OE33 R ALDH-
ve cells
To investigate if the ALDH+ve population may 
be involved in the radioresistance phenotype displayed 
by OE33 R cells, ALDH+ve and ALDH-ve populations 
from both OE33 P and OE33 R cells were separated 
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and comparative 
radiosensitivity was assessed using the gold standard 
clonogenic assay. ALDH+ve populations isolated from 
OE33 R cells were demonstrated to be significantly more 
resistant to radiation at a clinically-relevant dose of 2 Gy, 
when compared to the ALDH-ve populations (Figure 3D), 
suggesting that this minority subpopulation may be the 
effectors of the enhanced radioresistance of the OE33 R 
cell line. Interestingly, ALDH+ve cells from OE33 R cells 
also demonstrated significantly higher survival following 
2 Gy, when compared to ALDH+ve populations from 
OE33 P cells (Figure 3D), suggesting that the ALDH+ve 
population in OE33 R cells has additional molecular 
alterations that promote enhanced resistance to radiation.
miR-17-5p is decreased in radioresistant OE33 R 
ALDH+ve populations
To investigate potential molecular mechanisms 
underlying the enhanced radioresistance of OE33 R 
ALDH+ve cells, digital gene expression profiling of OE33 
R ALDH+ve and OE33 R ALDH-ve cells was performed. 
Interestingly, 8 miRNAs were identified as being 
significantly altered between relatively radiosensitive 
ALDH-ve and radioresistant ALDH+ve populations from 
OE33 R, supporting a role for miRNAs in the regulation 
of these distinct cellular subpopulations. Of particular 
interest, several members of the miR-17~92 cluster (miR-
17-5p, miR-17HG, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b1, miR-
20A and miR-92a1) (Figure 4A), were demonstrated 
to be significantly decreased in radioresistant OE33 R 
ALDH+ve cells, when compared to OE33 R ALDH-
ve cells (Fragments per kilobase of exon per million 
fragments mapped (FPKM) of 4.76 versus 57.10, 
respectively). We have previously demonstrated one of 
these miRNAs, miR-17-5p, to be significantly decreased 
in pre-treatment diagnostic tumor biopsies from EAC 
patients (patient characteristics outlined in Table 1) who 
subsequently have a poor response to neoadjuvant CRT 
[23] (Figure 4B), supporting a role for miR-17-5p in 
the tumor response to treatment. Taken together, these 
data suggest that the downregulation of miR-17-5p in 
radioresistant OE33R ALDH+ve cells, may provide a 
mechanism underlying their resistance to radiation.
miR-17-5p overexpression sensitises 
radioresistant EAC cells to radiation and results 
in repression of predicted gene targets
The significant decrease in miR-17-5p expression 
in radioresistant OE33 R ALDH+ve cells and tumors 
from EAC patients resistant to CRT [23], suggests that 
downregulation of miR-17-5p may provide a mechanism 
supporting radioresistance in EAC. To investigate 
if miR-17-5p plays a functional role in modulating 
radiosensitivity, transient overexpression of miR-
17-5p was performed in radioresistant OE33 R cells. 
Overexpression of miR-17-5p in transfected cells was

Student’s t-test, *p < 0.05.

confirmed by qPCR (Supplementary Figure 2). OE33 R 
cells overexpressing miR-17-5p were demonstrated to be 
significantly more sensitive to a clinically-relevant dose 
of 2 Gy X-ray radiation, when compared to a scrambled 
non-targeting control (Figure 5A), thus supporting a 
functional role for miR-17-5p in the response of EAC to 
X-ray radiation and further supporting downregulation as 
a mechanism for radioresistance in OE33 R ALDH+ve 
cells and poor responder tumors.
To investigate if this sensitising effect was specific 
to X-ray radiation, transient overexpression of miR-17-
5p was performed in cisplatin-resistant OE33 CisR cells 
and the sensitivity to cisplatin (1 μM) was assessed. OE33 
CisR cells overexpressing miR-17-5p did not demonstrate 
any significantly altered sensitivity to cisplatin (Figure 
5B), suggesting that, in vitro, miR-17-5p does not play 
a functional role in modulating the response to cisplatin 
in EAC cells. To elucidate potential gene targets of miR-
17-5p, the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program 
was used to identify gene targets with predicted miR-
17-5p binding sites. PRKACB and C6orf120 were two 
genes identified to have highly predicted miR-17-5p 
binding sites, suggesting the potential post-transcriptional 
regulation of these genes by miR-17-5p. Expression of 
PRKACB (Figure 5C) and C6orf120 (Figure 5D) was 
assessed in cells overexpressing miR-17-5p and both 
genes were demonstrated to be significantly decreased in 
OE33 R cells overexpressing miR-17-5p, when compared 
to a scrambled non-targeting control, supporting miR-17-
5p-mediated negative regulation of gene targets.
C6orf120 is significantly increased in EAC 
tumors resistant to neoadjuvant CRT
Given that miR-17-5p expression is significantly 
lower in pre-treatment tumor biopsies from EAC patients 
who subsequently have a poor response to neoadjuvant 
CRT ([23] and Figure 4A), we hypothesised that C6orf120 
and PRKACB would consequently be upregulated in 
poor responder tumors. The expression of C6orf120 and 
PRKACB was assessed by qPCR in pre-treatment tumor 
biopsies from EAC patients (n=30), who subsequently 
received neoadjuvant CRT. Of the 30 patients, 37% were 
classified as good responders (TRG 1 and 2), whilst 
63% were classified as poor responders (TRG 3, 4 and 
5). Again, patient characteristics are outlined in Table 
1. PRKACB demonstrated a trend towards increased 
expression in poor responders (p < 0.10), when compared 
to good responders, while, this was not statistically 
significant (Figure 6A). However, C6orf120 expression 
was demonstrated to be significantly increased in tumor 
biopsies from patients who had a poor response to 
neoadjuvant CRT, when compared to good responders 
(Figure 6B), suggesting that the decreased expression

DISCUSSION
The 
identification 
of 
biomarkers 
predicting 
therapeutic response and novel therapeutic targets to 
enhance response to neoadjuvant CRT in EAC is crucial 
to improving treatment efficacy and survival for patients. 
CSCs are identified as a distinct tumor cell population, 
implicated in playing a causative role in inherent tumor 
resistance to conventional anti-cancer treatments, such as 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy [12], and in accelerated 
repopulation and acquired resistance post treatment, 
highlighting their potential as novel predictors of response 
and a putative therapeutic target. However, the role of CSCs 
in the resistance of EAC to treatment is largely unknown.
In this study, we utilised an isogenic model of 
radioresistant EAC previously generated in our laboratory 
[24] to investigate the potential role of CSCs in the 
resistance to radiation treatment in EAC. Radioresistant 
OE33 R cells were demonstrated to have enhanced 
tumorigenicity in mice, increased expression of CSC-
associated markers and enhanced holoclone forming 
potential when compared to radiosensitive OE33 P cells, 
supporting a role for CSCs in this radioresistant EAC cell 
line. This supports several previous studies, which have 
highlighted a role for CSCs in the pathogenesis of EAC 
[27–29].
The identification and isolation of CSCs can present 
a challenge [30]. ALDH activity has been successfully 
used as a CSC marker in a number of solid tumors, 
including esophageal [27, 29], breast [31], lung [32], and 
prostate [33]. Here, we demonstrate that ALDH activity 
correlates with acquired resistance to both X-ray radiation 
and cisplatin in vitro in EAC cells, supporting a role for 
this ALDH positive (ALDH+ve) subpopulation in the 
resistance of EAC cells to both cytotoxic treatments. 
Furthermore, functional analysis of these distinct ALDH 
negative (ALDH-ve) and ALDH+ve subpopulations from 
both radioresistant and radiosensitive cells, demonstrated 
they had different relative radiosensitivities. Notably, the 
minority ALDH+ve subpopulation of cells isolated from 
the radioresistant OE33 R cell line were significantly more 
resistant to a clinically-relevant dose of 2 Gy radiation, 
when compared to the majority ALDH-ve subpopulation 
in OE33 R, suggesting this population as a predominant 
underlying cause of radioresistance in these cells. This 
supports two recent studies in prostate [34] and head and 
neck cancer [35], which demonstrated that cells with high 
ALDH activity have enhanced resistance to radiation and 
maintain their tumorigenic properties, when compared to 
ALDH-ve cells. Furthermore, a recent study by Ajani and 
colleagues demonstrated that high ALDH1 expression in 
pre-treatment EAC biopsies is associated with subsequent 
resistance to neoadjuvant CRT and is increased in vitro 
in chemoresistant EAC cells [29]. However, this study is 
the first to demonstrate the enhanced radioresistance of 
ALDH+ve cells in EAC. In this study we also demonstrate 
that ALDH+ve cells isolated from the radioresistant 
OE33 R line are significantly more resistant to 2 Gy 
radiation, when compared to ALDH+ve populations from 
radiosensitive OE33 P cells. This may suggest that the 
ALDH+ve population in OE33 R cells have undergone 
additional molecular alterations that result in enhanced 
resistance to radiation, and that the ALDH+ve population 
can potentially be further segregated into distinct sub-
subpopulations. This is supported by a previous study 
in pancreatic cancer, which demonstrated that CSC 
populations derived from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) 
models are heterogenous, with subpopulations of CSCs 
demonstrating different quiescent and chemoresistance 
profiles 
[36]. 
The 
fundamental 
mechanisms 
of 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance are likely to 
be polygenic in nature. Therefore, it must be considered 
that additional mutational and genetic events are also 
likely involved in the resistance of these isogenic cell line 
models of radioresistant and chemoresistant EAC.
Several studies have demonstrated that whilst 
CSCs and their non-tumorigenic progenies often share 
a common genotype, they display altered epigenetic 
profiles, which can result in altered phenotypes [20, 37, 
38]. This suggests that molecular reprogramming could 
be a fundamental mechanism underpinning the observed 
enhancement of radioresistance in the OE33 R ALDH+ve 
cells. Supporting this, 8 miRNAs were demonstrated to 
be significantly altered between ALDH+ve and ALDH-ve 
populations from OE33 R, suggesting a role for miRNAs 
in the enhanced radioresistance of the OE33 R ALDH+ve 
population. Interestingly, several members of the miR-
17~92 family (miR-17-5p, miR-17HG, miR-18a, miR-19a, 
miR-19b1, miR-20A and miR-92a1) were demonstrated 
to be significantly decreased in radioresistant OE33 R 
ALDH+ve cells, when compared to radiosensitive OE33 R 
ALDH-ve populations. The miR-17~92 cluster is located 
on chromosome 13q31, and is transcribed as a single 
primary transcript, which is processed to produce distinct, 
individual miR-17~92 members [39]. Evidence suggests 
a dual role for the miR-17~92 cluster in tumorigenesis, 
with evidence to support both oncogenic [40, 41] and 
tumor suppressive [42, 43] roles, suggesting a tumor/
tissue-specific role for these miRNAs. Interestingly, we 
have previously demonstrated that one of these altered 
miRNAs, miR-17-5p, is significantly decreased in 
pre-treatment EAC tumor biopsies from patients who 
subsequently have a poor response to neoadjuvant CRT 
[23], supporting loss of miR-17-5p as a potential driver 
mechanism of resistance to radiation both in vitro and 
in vivo. Supporting this, miR-17-5p was demonstrated 
to play a functional role in modulating sensitivity to 
radiation, significantly sensitising radioresistant OE33 
R cells to 2 Gy X-ray radiation in vitro. miR-17-5p 
 Oncotarget

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
overexpression did not alter sensitivity to cisplatin, 
suggesting that miR-17-5p may play a predominant role 
in the response to radiation. This suggests that whilst 
ALDH activity may be a general CSC marker, commonly 
applicable to both cisplatin- and radiation-resistant cells, 
miR-17-5p expression might further delineate the CSC 
populations, with downregulation of miR-17-5p specific 
to a radioresistant phenotype. As EAC biopsies are taken 
routinely at diagnosis, this suggests that expression 
of miR-17-5p could potentially be incorporated into a 
‘companion diagnostic’ prior to initiation of neoadjuvant 
CRT to aid in the identification of the most responsive 
patient subgroup, allowing for a more personalized 
approach to treatment. However, further validation of 
miR-17-5p as a predictive marker of CRT response in a 
larger patient cohort is required.
Our 
data 
suggest 
that 
in 
EAC 
tumors, 
downregulation of miR-17-5p provides a mechanism for 
resistance to neoadjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. 
This is supported by a study in esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma, which demonstrated downregulation of 
miR-17 in a model of acquired radioresistance [44]. In 
addition, a recent study in breast cancer demonstrated 
that overexpression of miR-17 enhances sensitivity to 
UV radiation and chemotherapy [45]. Furthermore, in 
pancreatic cancer, expression of the miR-17~92 cluster 
is decreased in chemoresistant CSCs and overexpression 
enhances sensitivity to gemcitabine [36]. Consistent 
with our results, the region encoding miR-17 has been 
demonstrated to undergo loss of heterozygosity in a 
number of tumor types [46, 47]. Moreover, several 
studies have highlighted a role for mutations and genomic 
rearrangements in the pathogenesis of EAC [48, 49], 
with both losses and gains at 13q highlighted [50, 51], 
suggesting that genomic alterations may provide a 
mechanism for the decreased miR-17-5p expression 
demonstrated here in tumors of poorly responding patients.
Interestingly, miR-17-5p overexpression resulted in 
a downregulation of PRKACB and C6orf120, which are 
predicted to have binding sites for miR-17-5p, supporting 
miR-17-5p-mediated negative gene regulation. Supporting 
our in vitro results, C6orf120 was demonstrated to be 
significantly increased in tumors from poor responders. 
C6orf120 encodes an N-glycosylated protein, of which 
the function is largely unknown. A previous study 
demonstrated that C6orf120 is secreted from HepG2 liver 
cancer cells via the classical ER-Golgi secretory pathway 
[52]. Furthermore, C6orf120 was demonstrated to induce 
endoplasmic 
reticulum 
stress-associated 
apoptosis 
in CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells, suggesting an 
immunoregulatory function for this protein [52]. It is 
now well established that the immune system plays an 
important role in the tumor response to radiation, with 
radiation therapy augmenting the anti-tumor immune 
response [53, 54]. Whilst traditionally anti-tumor immune 
responses have been largely attributed to CD8+ T cells, 
increasing evidence supports a role for CD4+ T cells in 
the anti-tumor response [55, 56]. Supporting this, activated 
CD4+ T cells have been demonstrated to sensitise cervical 
cancer and glioma cells to the effects of γ-radiation in 
vitro, supporting a role for CD4+ T cells in the tumor 
response to radiation [57]. Taken together, our data may 
suggest that EAC tumors demonstrating decreased miR-
17-5p expression and concomitantly increased C6orf120 
expression will have a poor response to radiation via 
C6orf120-mediated immunosuppression of CD4+ T cells. 
However, further work is required to fully elucidate the 
mechanism of this resistance to neoadjuvant CRT.
This study provides evidence that a subpopulation 
of cells with CSC properties exists in EAC, which are 
characterised by increased ALDH activity, enhanced 
resistance to radiation and decreased expression of miR-
17-5p. For the first time, we demonstrate that miR-17-5p 
is a functional modulator of radioresistance in vitro, and is 
decreased in EAC tumours from patients who have a poor 
response to neoadjuvant CRT. This study highlights for the 
first time a potential role for miR-17-5p as a biomarker 
predicting response to neoadjuvant CRT in EAC, which 
would facilitate improved patient stratification, as well as a 
novel therapeutic target to boost the efficacy of CRT in EAC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance 
with the ethical standards according to the Declaration 
of Helsinki and according to national and international 
guidelines and has been approved by the authors' 
institutional review board.
Cells lines and cell culture
The human EAC line OE33 was obtained from the 
European collection of cell cultures. OE33 P and OE33 
R cells were generated and cultured in our laboratory 
as previously described [24]. Briefly, OE33 cells were 
chronically irradiated with 2 Gy X-ray radiation every 
~7-10 days, until a radioresistant subline (OE33 R) 
was generated, having received a cumulative dose of 
50 Gy. Radiosensitivity was assessed by clonogenic 
assay. Parental cells (OE33 P) were mock irradiated. 
The cisplatin resistant variant of the OE33 cell line 
(OE33 CisR) was derived from the original parent cell 
line (OE33). Cells were treated with 1 μM cisplatin 
or PBS (NaCl) vehicle control for 72 h. Treatment was 
then discarded and replaced with complete media for 
72 h, and this cyclic treatment regimen was repeated 
for approximately 6-months. During this time, cells 
were subcultured at 80-90% confluence and cisplatin

sensitivity was assessed throughout the 6-month period 
via clonogenic assay.
Animal experiments
All animal experiments were approved by the 
Ethics Board of Trinity College Dublin and licensed by 
the Health Products Regulatory Authority. Experiments 
were carried out in line with the United Kingdom Co-
ordinating Committee on Cancer Research (UKCCCR) 
guidelines. Female 7-9 week old NOD SCID (NOD.
CB17-Prkdcscid/NCrHsd) mice were obtained from Harlan 
Laboratories. Mice were subcutaneously injected, above 
the right hind-limb, with 1 x 103 cells (either OE33 P or 
OE33 R) in a 100 μl volume of 20% high concentration 
Matrigel (Corning) and 80% Ham’s F12 media (Lonza). 
Mice were monitored 2-3 times per week for indications of 
tumor development and tumor growth was measured using 
calipers. Tumors were measured on 2 perpendicular axes, 
to account for irregular tumour dimensions and the mean 
of these measurements was used to calculate the mean 
tumor diameter. Animals were sacrificed when tumors 
reached a mean tumor diameter of 10 mm, and individual 
replicates varied slightly in time taken to reach the 10 mm 
end-point. Growth of OE33 R tumors was terminated at 
78 days post-injection, whilst OE33 P tumor growth was 
terminated at 108 days post-injection, coinciding with the 
maximum mean tumor diameter limit.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated from cells using a miRNeasy 
Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Total RNA and miRNAs were isolated from patient 
samples using an All-in-One purification kit (Norgen 
Biotek), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was 
quantified using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer v3.3 
(Thermo Scientific).
Quantitative PCR
For assessment of gene expression in cell lines and 
patient samples, total RNA was reverse transcribed to 
cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription 
Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or random hexamers 
(Invitrogen) and Bioscript enzyme (Bioline), respectively. 
qPCR was performed using a TaqMan® assay kit (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) and 18S was used as an endogenous 
control for data normalization. qPCR was performed 
using an ABI Prism 7900HT real-time thermal cycler or 
QuantStudio 5 PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
qPCR data were analysed by the 2-ΔΔCt (Livak) method [58].
Holoclone generation
Holoclones were generated as previously described 
[59]. Briefly, a sterile solution of agarose (1% w/v) and 
sodium chloride (1% w/v) was added to 10 cm petri dishes 
(10 mL/dish) and allowed to set at room temperature for 
20 min. Petri dishes were supplemented with complete 
RPMI-1640 media (20 mL). Cells were seeded at a density 
of 1 x 106 cells/dish and were maintained at 37°C in 95% 
humidified air containing 5% CO2. Resulting holoclones 
were examined microscopically to confirm holoclone 
morphology [59].
Aldehyde dehydrogenase assay and cell sorting
Aldehyde 
dehydrogenase 
(ALDH) 
enzyme 
activity was assessed using the Aldefluor® assay (Stem 
Cell Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Briefly, cells were trypsinised and 
resuspended at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL in Aldefluor® 
assay buffer containing ALDH substrate (bodipy-
aminoacetaldehyde) (5 μL/mL). Immediately following 
this, half of the resuspended cells were added to a tube 
containing the ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde 
(DEAB), to provide a negative control. All samples 
were incubated for 45 min at 37°C with mild agitation. 
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 
Aldefluor® assay buffer and analysed using a CyAn flow 
cytometer (Beckman Coulter). For cell sorting assays, 
cells were filtered using cell strainers (70 μm) and sorted 
into Aldefluor positive (ALDH+ve) and Aldefluor negative 
(ALDH-ve) cells using a MoFlow cell sorter (Beckman 
Coulter).
Irradiation
Irradiation was performed using a Gulmay Medical 
RS 225 X-ray generator (Gulmay Medical), at a dose rate 
of 3.25 Gy per min.
Clonogenic assay
For ALDH-associated irradiation experiments, 
ALDH+ve and ALDH-ve sorted cell populations were 
seeded at optimized clonogenic cell seeding densities 
(1.5 × 103 and 3 × 103 cells/well for control and irradiated 
cells, respectively) in 6-well plates. Cells were allowed 
to adhere overnight and were irradiated with 2 Gy X-ray 
radiation, whilst controls were mock-irradiated. For miR-
17-5p overexpression irradiation experiments, transfected 
cells were irradiated with 2 Gy X-ray radiation, whilst 
controls were mock-irradiated, at 24 h post transfection 
and seeded at optimised clonogenic densities (as described 
above) in 6-well plates at 1 h post irradiation. For miR-17-
5p overexpression cisplatin experiments, cells were seeded 
at optimised clonogenic densities (as described above) 
in 6-well plates at 24 h post transfection and allowed to 
adhere for 24 h. Cells were treated with 1 μM cisplatin or 
NaCl vehicle control and the medium replaced 24 h post 
treatment.
 Oncotarget

For all clonogenics experiments, cells were then 
incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2/95% air for 8-14 days to 
allow colonies to form. Colonies were fixed and stained 
with crystal violet (70% methanol, 30% H2O, 0.1% w/v 
crystal violet) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 
destaining in H2O. Air-dried plates were imaged and 
colonies were counted using a Colcount instrument 
(Oxford Optronics). The surviving fraction was calculated 
as previously described [24].
Digital gene expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted from OE33 R ALDH-ve 
and OE33 R ALDH+ve sorted cells and 1.5 μg prepared 
for shipping as advised by LC Sciences, Texas, USA. 
LC Sciences performed whole transcriptome digital 
RNA-seq using Illumina sequencing by synthesis 
technology. Briefly, for sequencing library preparation 
1.5 μg total RNA was purified for poly-A containing 
mRNA molecules using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic 
beads from the mRNA-Seq sample preparation kit. 
Subsequently mRNA was fragmented, phosphatase and 
PNK treated, and 3’ and 5’ adapters ligated to the RNAs 
in preparation for cDNA synthesis. Following reverse 
transcription and amplification to selectively enrich 
fragments with 3’ and 5’ adapters, samples underwent 
DNA fragment enrichment via first and second PCR clean 
up. Resultant sample libraries were quality controlled 
using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyser. Sequencing was 
performed on a HiSeq 2500 platform using 50 bp SE cycle 
runs. For data processing, after removing the 3’ adapter 
(TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG), reads with a length 
of less than 10 nt were excluded. The remaining reads 
were considered mappable reads. Mappable reads were 
aligned to genome using Tophat_v2.0.13. For pairwise 
differential gene expression analysis abundance was 
normalised and evaluated in FPKM using the Cuffdiff 
module of Cufflinks_v2.2.1. For gene ontology (GO) 
analysis of genes demonstrating a significant difference 
a q-value representing a false discovery rate adjusted 
p-value of <0.05 was employed. Analysed data sets 
including GO and KEGG analysis were provided by LC 
Sciences.
miR-17-5p transfection
Transient overexpression of miR-17-5p was 
performed by reverse transfection of Pre-miR-17-5p 
or scrambled non-targeting control miRNA precursor 
molecules (5 nM) (Ambion), using Lipofectamine 2000 
transfection reagent (Invitrogen), as per the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Cells were transfected at a seeding density of 
2.4 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate.
Patients, treatment and histology
Following ethical approval (Joint St James’s 
Hospital/AMNCH ethical review board) and written 
informed consent, diagnostic biopsy specimens were 
obtained from patients with a diagnosis of operable EAC, 
prior to neoadjuvant therapy. All patients included in the 
study received a complete course of neoadjuvant CRT. 
Chemotherapy consisted of 2 courses of 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU) and cisplatin, as previously described [60]. 
Patients received 40.05 Gy in 15 daily fractions (2.67 
Gy/fraction) over 3-weeks as previously described [60]. 
Surgical resection involved transthoracic esophagectomy, 
including en-bloc lymphadenectomy of the abdominal 
and mediastinal nodes, and was performed approximately 
1-month following completion of the CRT regimen. All 
resected oesophagectomy specimens were routinely 
assessed by an experienced pathologist. Tumor response 
to treatment was assigned 1 of 5 tumor regression grades 
(TRG), TRG 1 (complete regression) to TRG 5 (no 
regression) based on the presence of residual cancer cells 
and the degree of fibrotic change, as previously described 
[61]. Responders were classified as patients achieving a 
TRG of 1 or 2, whilst non-responders were classified as 
patients having a TRG of 3, 4 or 5, as previously described 
[22].
Tissue collection
Diagnostic endoscopic biopsies were obtained 
by a qualified endoscopist prior to neoadjuvant 
therapy. Immediately adjacent tissue was taken for 
histologic confirmation, which was performed using 
routine hematoxylin and eosin staining. Specimens 
were immediately placed in RNA later (Ambion) and 
refrigerated for 24 h, before removal of RNA later and 
storage in a designated institutional biorepository at -80°C.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad 
InStat v3 (GraphPad software Inc). All data are expressed 
as mean ± the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical 
analysis was performed using a 2-tailed Student’s t-test, 
one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test or Mann-
Whitney U non-parametrical testing. For all statistical 
analyses, differences were considered to be statistically 
significant at p ≤ 0.05.
