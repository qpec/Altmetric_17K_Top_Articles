zithromycin is a widely prescribed broad-spectrum mac-
rolide used mainly for the treatment of respiratory and 
urinary tract bacterial infections. Concerns have been 
raised recently regarding its arrhythmogenic potential, a risk 
already known to be associated with the first marketed macro-
lide, erythromycin.1–6 Several case reports have described QT-
interval prolongation,7–9 torsades de pointes10–12 and polymor-
phic ventricular tachycardia13 following use of azithromycin. 
Many observational studies have reported conflicting results 
about the association between azithromycin use and cardiovas-
cular death.14–21 Because the known azithromycin-related cardiac 
events are related to QT-interval prolongation, torsades de 
pointes and ventricular arrhythmia,18,19 these observational stud-
ies are limited by the broad category of cardiovascular death 
used as an outcome, which likely only partially captured cardiac 
risk associated with azithromycin use. To date, only 1 observa-
tional study has investigated the association between azithro-
mycin use and ventricular arrhythmia specifically.22 
Given the conflicting findings regarding this widely used anti-
biotic and the lack of data on ventricular arrhythmia specifically, 
we aimed to quantify the association between azithromycin use 
and the risk of ventricular arrhythmia using data from a network 
of 7 health care databases from 5 European countries.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: There are conflicting 
findings from observational studies of 
the arrhythrogenic potential of azithro-
mycin. Our aim was to quantify the asso-
ciation between azithromycin use and 
the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case–
control study within a cohort of new anti-
biotic users identified from a network of 
7 population-based health care data-
bases in Denmark, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands and the United Kingdom for 
the period 1997–2010. Up to 100 controls 
per case were selected and matched by 
age, sex and  
database. Recency of antibi-
otic use and type of drug (azithromycin 
was the exposure of interest) at the index 
date (occurrence of ventricular arrhyth-
mia) were identified. We estimated the 
odds of ventricular arrhythmia associ-
ated with current azithromycin use rela-
tive to current amoxicillin use or nonuse 
of anti 
biotics (≥ 365 d without antibiotic 
exposure) using conditional logistic 
regression, adjusting for confounders.
RESULTS: We identified 14 040 688 new 
antibiotic users who met the inclusion 
criteria. Ventricular arrhythmia devel-
oped in 12 874, of whom 30 were current 
azithromycin users. The mean age of the 
cases and controls was 63 years, and 
two-thirds were male. In the pooled data 
analyses across databases, azithromycin 
use was associated with an increased 
risk of ventricular arrhythmia relative to 
nonuse of antibiotics (adjusted odds 
 
ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.35–2.86). This increased risk disap-
peared when current amoxicillin use was 
the comparator (adjusted OR 0.90, 95% 
CI 0.48–1.71). Database-specific esti-
mates and meta-analysis confirmed re-
sults from the pooled data analysis.
INTERPRETATION: Current azithromycin 
use was associated with an increased 
risk of ventricular arrhythmia when 
compared with nonuse of antibiotics, 
but not when compared with current 
amoxicillin use. The decreased risk with 
an active comparator suggests signifi-
cant confounding by indication.

ipated in the ARITMO (Arrhythmogenic Potential of Drugs) 
study.23 The ARITMO study was conducted from Jan. 1, 1997, to 
Dec. 31, 2010, and the databases covered a total population of 
about 28 million.
The individual databases were the Health Search Database 
 
Cegedim Strategic Data Longitudinal Patient Database (Italy), the 
Integrated Primary Care Information Database (the Netherlands), 
The Health Improvement Network (United Kingdom), the PHARMO 
Database Network (the Netherlands), the Aarhus University Hospital 
Database (northern and central regions of Denmark), the German 
Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (Germany) and the 
Emilia-Romagna Database (Emiglia-Romagna region of Italy) 
(Table 1). Harmonized data extraction, quality assurance and analy-
ses when combining multiple health care databases for drug safety 
studies have been described elsewhere.24 
The databases in the ARITMO network have been used pre-
viously in pharmacoepidemiologic studies,25 and trends in anti-
biotic use across databases have been investigated.26 The 
ARITMO studies are registered in the ENCePP (European Network 
of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance) 
registry of studies held at the European Medicines Agency (www.
encepp.eu/encepp/viewResource.htm?id=4669).
Study population
We included patients 85 years of age or younger who were new 
antibiotic users (no antibiotic use in the prior year). Cohort entry 
occurred on the date of the first recorded antibiotic prescription 
among patients with at least 1 year of database history.
We excluded patients over 85 years of age to avoid immortal 
time bias. We excluded patients with malignant cancer because 
they may have been admitted to hospital for long periods, which 
would preclude full capture of their medical history. In addition, 
we excluded, wherever possible, people with a record of hospital 
admission.
We followed patients from the first antibiotic prescription to 
the earliest of the following: end of study, occurrence of ventricu-
lar arrhythmia, transfer out of database, diagnosis of malignant 
cancer, 85th birthday or death.
Cases and controls
For cases, we identified patients with the primary outcome of ven-
tricular arrhythmia (the case definition and coding algorithms are 
reported in Appendix 1, eFigure 1 and eTable1, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160355/-/DC1). Outcome 
validation was conducted in every database for a random sample 
of 200 cases through independent manual review of medical 
records by 2 experts per database who were blind to drug expo-
sure. In the Integrated Primary Care Information database, manual 
validation of all automatically detected cases was performed 
because of extensive use of unstructured, free-text patient notes. A 
positive predictive value of 90% or higher was achieved.24 We 
excluded cases if they were current users of azithromycin and 
another antibiotic concomitantly; we also excluded cases if they 
were not current, recent or past users of azithromycin.
We selected up to 100 controls per case and matched them by 
year of birth (within 1 yr), sex, index date and database using 
incidence density sampling.
Exposure
We obtained data on antibiotics (Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical 
classification codes J01*) from the electronic drug prescription/
dispensing records in the study databases. We calculated the

exposure period by dividing the total number of units prescribed 
or dispensed by the daily number of units taken (or the defined 
daily dose if the prescribed dosage was unavailable). 
Exposure to antibiotics was categorized as current, recent or 
past. Current exposure was defined as the period covering the 
index date (occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia), or ending 
within 7 days before the index date to account for lack of compli-
ance with treatment or late registration of ventricular arrhythmia 
(i.e., to reduce exposure misclassification and outcome misclas-
sification). Recent exposure was defined as the period ending 
between 7 and 89 days before the index date (complications of 
severe infections or delayed effects of antibiotic exposure may 
have an effect on the occurrence of the primary outcome). Past 
exposure was defined as the period ending between 90 and 364 
days before the index date (both antibiotic exposure and infec-
tion are likely to have no effect on occurrence of the outcome). 
To take into account the baseline risk of ventricular arrrhythmia, 
we defined a non-exposure category as no antibiotic exposure 
within 365 days before the index date.
Covariates
We considered the following risk factors of ventricular arrhyth-
mia as covariates: age and sex; cardiovascular diseases; meta-
bolic diseases; other diseases potentially related to increased 
risk of ventricular arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation or flutter and 
cardiomyopathies); prior use of anti-arrhythmia drugs, and con-
comitant use (defined as use within 90 d before index date) of 
medications known to induce hypokalemia or QT-interval–
prolonging drugs (i.e., drugs with established torsadogenic risk 
according to the CredibleMeds list27). (The covariates and coding 
algorithms are reported in Appendix 1, eTables 2–5, using the 
harmonization process that has been described before.24)
Statistical analysis
Data were extracted locally and transformed into a simple com-
mon data model according to a process described previously.28 
Data were then transformed locally from the common input files 
into fully anonymized data sets with use of the custom-built 
JAVA-based software Jerboa.29
We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression 
analysis for current, recent and past use of azithromycin, with 
current use of amoxicillin as the primary comparator. We also 
calculated ORs for current, recent and past use of azithromycin, 
amoxicillin and other antibiotics using non-exposure to antibiot-
ics as a secondary comparator.
Confounders included in the final models were selected 
through a stepwise approach. Well-known risk factors for ven-
tricular arrhythmia were included a priori as confounders in the 
final multivariate model (Appendix 1, eTable 2). Other potential 
confounders were included if they had a prevalence greater 
than 5% among the controls and were associated with the out-
come in the univariate model. All analyses were conducted in 
each database, and a meta-analysis of risk estimates from the 
individual databases was carried out. Heterogeneity across 
databases was estimated with use of the Cochran Q statistic. 
The I2 statistic was then used to express the percentage varia-
tion across the databases due to heterogeneity, with values 
greater than 75% considered to denote a high level of hetero-
geneity. As a conservative approach, we used a 2-stage random-
effects model for the meta-analysis of pooled data.30 Only data-
bases with 3 or more cases currently using azithromycin were 
included in the meta-analysis.
We performed 2 sensitivity analyses. In one, we changed the 
definition of current antibiotic exposure by excluding the 7-day 
carry-over period that was used to account for lack of compli-
ance or late registration of ventricular arrhythmia. In another, 
we excluded all patients who had a diagnosis of acute myo-
cardial infarction reported within 15 days before the index date, 
to test for confounding owing to recent acute myocardial 
infarction.
Ethics approval
This study was not conducted with direct patient involvement, 
and all data were analyzed retrospectively. Prior ethics approval 
for the study was obtained in line with national regulations.
Results
In the source population of 28 760 406 people, we identified 
14 040 688 (48.8%) new antibiotic users who met the inclusion 
criteria. Ventricular arrhythmia developed in 12 874 (0.1%) and 
1 240 431 (8.8%) were selected as matched controls (Figure 1). 
The mean age of the cases and controls was 63 years, and two-
thirds were male (Table 2). Well-known risk factors for ventricu-
lar arrhythmia were all more frequent among cases than among 
controls. 
Of the cases, 30 were current azithromycin users, matched to 
1344 controls. In the primary analysis, we found no significant 
increase in risk of ventricular arrhythmia associated with current 
use of azithromycin versus current use of amoxicillin (adjusted 
OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.50–1.77) (Table 3). The risk was decreased 
among recent and past users of azithromycin versus amoxicillin 
(adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38–0.87, and 0.52, 95% CI 0.37–0.73, 
respectively).
Compared with nonuse of antibiotics, current use of azithro-
mycin was associated with an increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmia, which was decreased substantially but remained sig-
nificant after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted OR 
1.97, 95% CI 1.35–2.86) (Table 4). There was no increased risk of 
ventricular arrhythmia among recent and past users of azithro-
mycin compared with nonuse of antibiotics (adjusted OR 1.12, 
95% CI 0.92–1.37, and 1.10, 95% CI 0.95–1.28, respectively). Use 
of other antibiotics (excluding azithromycin and amoxicillin) was 
associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia com-
pared with nonuse of antibiotics (adjusted OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.71–
1.97). An increased risk was also associated with recent and past 
use of other antibitiocs, but the effect was smaller (adjusted OR 
1.32, 95% CI 1.25–1.39, for recent use, and 1.11, 95% CI 1.06–1.16, 
for past use).
For the 2-stage meta-analysis, we used data from only the

Database, the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Data-
base and the Emilia-Romagna Database, because the other data-
bases had fewer than 3 cases who were current azithromycin 
users. Heterogeneity among databases was low and nonsignifi-
cant (Q statistic 3.39; p = 0.3; I2 = 11%). The comparison of current 
azithromycin use and current amoxicillin use showed no 
increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.38–
2.64) (Figure 2). However, the pooled estimate showed an 
increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia associated with current 
azithromycin use compared with nonuse of antibiotics (OR 2.44, 
95% CI 1.61–3.69) (Figure 3).
The findings were similar to those of the primary analysis 
when we excluded the 7-day carry-over period: compared with 
nonuse of antibiotics, current azithromycin use and current 
amoxicillin use were associated with a similar increased risk of 
ventricular arrhythmia (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.1, and 1.9, 
95% CI 2.5–2.3, respectively). When we excluded patients with a 
diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction within 15 days before 
the index date, both azithromycin and amoxicillin use were asso-
ciated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia compared 
with nonuse of antibiotics (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, and 
1.9, 95%CI 1.7–2.2, respectively).
Interpretation
Our study showed an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia 
associated with current azithromycin use compared with nonuse 
of antibiotics. Confounding by indication likely played a major 
role in the assessment of these associations, because the 
increased risk disappeared when current amoxicillin use was the 
comparator. This result was consistent across separate databases 
as well as in the 1- and 2-stage pooled analyses. Confounding by 
indication in the context of current azithromycin use versus non-
use of antibiotics refers to the increased baseline risk of ventricu-
lar arrhythmia associated with the indication of the antibiotic use 
(i.e., the infection) rather than the exposure itself (i.e., azithromy-
cin). The comparison between amoxicillin and azithromycin is 
more likely a true reflection of the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. 
The rationale behind our use of amoxicillin as a control is there-
fore twofold: (a) it is not expected to have an increased risk of 
ventricular arrhythmia; and (b) it would avoid introducing con-
founding by indication because both amoxicillin and azithromy-
cin have a similar indication of use and spectrum of action. The 
above is not true of a comparison between azithromycin use and 
nonuse of antibiotics. Amoxicillin has been used as a comparator 
in similar studies previously.14,17
Given the upper limit of the 95% CI and the crude incidence 
rate of ventricular arrhythmia in the general population in all 
7 databases, we would expect at most 8.07 excess cases of ven-
tricular arrhythmia to be associated with azithromycin use per 
100 000 person-years compared with nonuse of antibiotics.
There are conflicting results from large epidemiologic studies 
reporting the risk of cardiovascular death and, more rarely, car-
diac arrhythmia. A US cohort study reported a 2.5- and 2.9-fold 
increased risk of cardiovascular death compared with amoxicillin 
and nonuse of antibiotics, respectively, among Medicare benefi-
ciaries.14 Following publication of these data, the US Food and 
Drug Administration issued a safety warning about azithromycin-
related cardiovascular death.15 A subsequent Danish study 
showed that the increased risk of cardiovascular death associ-
ated with azithromycin use compared with nonuse of antibiotics 
(rate ratio 2.85, 95% CI 1.13–7.24) disappeared when use of peni-
cillin V was the comparator (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.56–1.55).16

reported an almost twofold increased risk of serious arrhythmia 
associated with current azithromycin use compared with current 
amoxicillin use.17
In 2014, a US study reported that, among older patients ad-
mitted to hospital with pneumonia, azithromycin use was associ-
ated with a small increased risk of myocardial infarction among 
azithromycin users compared with nonusers, but no effect on 
cardiac arrhythmias was observed.20 
The findings among outpatients from the US studies14,17,20 con-
flict with our findings and those reported by Svanström and col-
leagues.16 A possible explanation for this is that Medicaid benefi-
ciaries and retired veterans may have a more marked presence of 
multiple confounders such as older age, lower socioeconomic 
status, increased number of comorbidities, obesity, current smok-
ing status and disability, which may make them more vulnerable 
to the cardiovascular adverse effects of azithromycin than other 
populations, or increase the impact of residual confounding.
Our findings are in agreement with those from a cohort study 
involving older patients in Canada (specifically Ontario), which 
found no increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia associated with 
macrolide use compared with no macrolide use.21 The study was 
based on the assumption that an increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmia is a class effect, potentially masking the risk of ven-
tricular arrhythmia associated with individual agents.

That the risk of ventricular arrhythmia for macrolides as a 
class does not necessarily reflect the risk of individual macrolide 
antibiotics was illustrated by Chou and colleagues,22 who con-
ducted the only published cohort study to date investigating the 
association between ventricular arrhythmia and azithromycin 
use, set in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Elec-
trophysiologic evidence supports our findings and suggests that 
azithromycin lacks arrhythmogenic potential at therapeutic 
doses.31,32 Fever itself may be a risk factor for arrhythmia, and 
therefore confounding by indication is pronounced when anti-
biotics are used in patients with high fever.33
Strengths and limitations
Main strengths of our study include the size of the database net-
work used, since ventricular arrhythmia is a rare outcome, and 
the common methodology used. All of the databases except the

Emiglia-Romagna Database and the Aarhus University Hospital 
Database are representative of the countries from which data 
were drawn. In addition, exposure to individual antibiotics was 
identified in such a way that only users of a single antibiotic were 
included in the analyses.
Results from the 1-stage pooling were confirmed in the meta-
analysis (2-stage pooling) of risk estimates from the individual 
databases. Taken together, these factors substantially increase 
the reliability of the study findings. Although it may be consid-
ered a limitation that 3 of the databases were excluded from the 
2-stage pooling analysis owing to the low number of cases, all 
7 databases were included in the 1-stage pooling analysis.
Our study has some other limitations. Exposure misclassifica-
tion was possible if patients did not fill their prescriptions or take 
their medications. However, risk estimates were consistent 
across databases, which suggests a negligible effect of this bias. 
In addition, exclusion of the 7-day carry-over period to take into 
account lack of compliance yielded results similar to those of the 
primary analysis.
The exclusion of cancer patients and those 85 years and older 
may be considered a limitation; however, the latter approach has 
been used previously.34,35 
Findings from our study may not be directly extrapolated to 
the hospital setting, because the health status of patients and 
the nature of antibiotic use in the community setting is likely to 
be very different.
Conclusion
In this large population-based study of data from 7 European 
countries, current azithromycin use was associated with an 
increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia when compared with 
nonuse of antibiotics, but not when compared with current 
amoxicillin use. The decreased risk with an active comparator 
suggests significant confounding by indication.
