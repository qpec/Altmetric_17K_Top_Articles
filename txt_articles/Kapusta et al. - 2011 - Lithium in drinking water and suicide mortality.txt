 Natural lithium traces in water were considered by John Cade in
1949 to have the potential to influence mental health.1 Meanwhile,
the mood-stabilising effects of lithium are widely recognised by
the psychiatric community2 and its suicide preventive properties
are well documented.3 Although the effects of therapeutic doses
of lithium are well established, little is known about the health
effects of natural lithium intake.
As a natural trace element, lithium is mobilised by rain from
rock and soil and dissolves in ground and drinking water. In some
geographic regions, its concentrations may reach up to 5.2 mg/l,
reflecting a natural daily intake of lithium of up to 10 mg/day.4,5
Although such daily doses of lithium are considerably lower than
those used therapeutically, it is unknown to what extent intake of
natural lithium may influence mental health or suicide mortality.
Only one randomised placebo-controlled study showed favourable
effects of low-dose lithium supplementation (0.4 mg daily) on
mood, in a small sample of former drug users.6 However, evidence
from ecological studies indicates that lithium levels in drinking
water may be associated with regional suicide mortality. The first
study was carried out in Texas in 1990 and demonstrated that
counties with higher lithium levels in municipal water supplies
had lower suicide and crime rates.7 A more recent report from
Japan showed an inverse relationship between lithium levels in
tap water and suicide mortality in Oita prefecture.8 However, this
report has been criticised for being based on unreliable lithium
measures,9 and for omitting socioeconomic confounders such as
poverty and economic issues.10 In order to replicate the report
of Ohgami et al8 on the basis of data originating from a different
country, and to address the criticisms mentioned above, we
extended the design of the study by Ohgami and colleagues and
used a large data source of lithium levels in drinking water. To
challenge the hypothesis that lithium levels in drinking water are
inversely associated with suicide mortality, we adjusted for
regional socioeconomic conditions and the availability of mental
health service providers. These factors were recently shown to
influence suicide mortality in Austria.11
Method
Statistics Austria provided the official Austrian mortality database
for suicides in 17 age groups and both genders for 99 Austrian
districts and for each year in the time period 2005–2009.
Comprehensive data on population density, average income per
capita and the proportion of Roman Catholics were obtained from
the official Austrian population census 2001 (www.statistik.at).
The unemployment rates were obtained from the Austrian
Public Employment Service (AMS) (M. Eichinger, personal
communication, 2009) and were averaged for the available years
2005–2008.
All
consecutive
years
were
strongly
correlated
(r40.9). The density of general practitioners (GPs) and psychiatrists
per 10 000 population for each district were available for the year
2007 from the Austrian Medical Chamber (A. Sinabell, personal
communication, 2009). The Austrian Institute of Health (O
¨ BIG)12
provided figures on the density of psychotherapists per 100 000 for
the year 2005. Austria had an average population of 8 297 964
(s.d.= 65 050) during the examined time period 2005–2009. The
average population per district was 83 818 (s.d.= 165 643), with
a range of 1714 to 1 667 878 inhabitants (capital city Vienna).
Excluding Vienna (by far the largest region) produced an average
population per district of 67 654 (s.d.= 39 852).
To account for the distributions of gender and age in each
district, we calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for
suicide for each district using the indirect method, by taking the
gender and age composition of the general population as a
standard. Although using SMR is formally more appropriate than
computing with suicide rates per 100 000 in epidemiological and
ecological studies,13 we applied both methods for each district
to allow discussion of estimated effects as recently suggested.9
Lithium levels were obtained from AQA GmbH, an Austrian
company engaged in the collection and the analysis of drinking
water samples and applied scientific research. The samples were
analysed

Background
There is some evidence that natural levels of lithium in
drinking water may have a protective effect on suicide
mortality.
Aims
To evaluate the association between local lithium levels in
drinking water and suicide mortality at district level in
Austria.
Method
A nationwide sample of 6460 lithium measurements was
examined for association with suicide rates per 100 000
population and suicide standardised mortality ratios across
all 99 Austrian districts. Multivariate regression models were
adjusted for well-known socioeconomic factors known to
influence suicide mortality in Austria (population density, per
capita income, proportion of Roman Catholics, as well as the
availability of mental health service providers). Sensitivity
analyses and weighted least squares regression were used
to challenge the robustness of the results.
Results
The overall suicide rate (R2 = 0.15, b = 70.39, t = 74.14,
P = 0.000073) as well as the suicide mortality ratio (R2 = 0.17,
b = 70.41, t = 74.38, P = 0.000030) were inversely associated
with lithium levels in drinking water and remained significant
after sensitivity analyses and adjustment for socioeconomic
factors.
Conclusions
In replicating and extending previous results, this study
provides strong evidence that geographic regions with higher
natural lithium concentrations in drinking water are
associated with lower suicide mortality rates.

 spectrometry, a method for the determination of dissolved
inorganic, organic and other compounds in water samples.14
The sample data were collected between 2005 and autumn 2010.
In total, 6460 water samples from drinking water supplies from
all 99 districts were analysed for lithium (see online Figs DS1
and DS2). The average was 65.3 samples per district (range 1–
312). The lowest measurable threshold lithium level by inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry was 0.0033 mg/l.
Subthreshold values were found in seven districts. For the
statistical calculations, lithium levels were averaged per district.
The
mean
lithium
level
in
Austrian
drinking
water
was
0.0113 mg/l (s.d.= 0.027). The highest single lithium level was
found in Graz-vicinity (1.3 mg/l), and the district with the highest
mean level was Mistelbach (0.0823 mg/l).
To allow for comparison with the results of the Japanese
study,8 we used similar statistical methods; although more
elaborated methods for the analysis of geographical data have
already been applied.11 Because of the skewness of the distribution
of lithium levels (skewness 4.606, kurtosis 27.134), the population
density, the density of psychiatrists, psychotherapists and GPs, the
variables were log-transformed to fit non-parametric tests. Prior
to
the
log-transformation,
we
also
applied
a
conservative
sensitivity analysis of the crude regression model of overall suicide
rates as well as SMRs for suicide and lithium levels by inspection
of scatter plots and boxplots for the identification of outliers. In
total, seven possible outlier districts were identified: Rust-city,
Eisenstadt-vicinity, Oberwart, Bruck an der Leitha, Hollabrunn,
Korneuburg and Mistelbach. However, exclusion of these outliers
did not alter the direction of the association between suicide rates
or SMR for suicide and lithium levels nor exceeded the
significance level set at alpha 0.05 for all analyses. The same was
true when districts with less than five water samples were excluded,
or Vienna, the largest city, was excluded (these complementary
analyses are not reported in the results). Therefore, all further
regression models were based on log-transformed data of all 99
districts.
Weighted least squared (WLS) regression analyses adjusted for
the size of the population per district were employed to test for the
robustness of univariate and multivariate statistics. Multivariate
regression
models
incorporated
those
covariates
that
were
significantly correlated with SMR for suicide (Table 1) in
correlation tests. The residuals in the regression models were
inspected in plots and tested with the Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test
for normality. Possible auto-regression of data was analysed using
the Durbin–Watson tests. Multivariate models were tested for
multicollinearity by calculating tolerance values and the condition
index. Data analysis was performed on SPSS 17.0 for Windows.
Results
Suicide mortality was significantly correlated with mean lithium
levels per district, population density, per capita income, the
proportion of Roman Catholics, as well as with the density of
psychiatrists, psychotherapists and GPs. Unemployment did not
correlate with suicide mortality (Table 1).
Univariate regression
The univariate regression parameters for the untransformed
lithium levels as the independent variable were similar for the
overall suicide rate per 100 000 (R2 = 0.15, b= 70.39, t= 74.14,
P = 0.000073), suicide rates for males (R2 = 0.12, b= –0.35,
t = 73.64,
P= 0.00043)
and
females
(R2 = 0.08;
b = 70.28,
t = 72.82, P= 0.0058) (online Fig. DS3). The results were
comparable when SMRs were used instead of suicide rates: overall
(R2 = 0.17, b= 70.41, t= 74.38, P= 0.000030), male (R2 = 0.13;
b = 70.36, t= 73.84, P= 0.00022) and female SMR (R2 = 0.08,
b = 70.29, t= 72.96, P= 0.0038) (Fig. 1).
Log-transformed regressions
All further analyses were based on log-transformed data (online
Fig. DS4 and Fig. 2). The univariate regression estimates of
lithium as a predictor were comparable for overall (R2 = 0.14,
b = 70.38, t= 74.01, P= 0.00012), male (R2 = 0.11, b= 70.33,
t = 73.39, P= 0.00098) and female SMRs (R2 = 0.09; b = 70.29,
t = 73.02, P= 0.0032). Weighting (WLS) for the number of
inhabitants per district revealed significant associations for the
overall
SMR
(R2 = 0.05,
b= 70.22,
P= 0.029),
females
(R2 = 0.04,
b= 70.21,
P= 0.037)
and
a
trend
for
males
(R2 = 0.03, b= –0.18, P= 0.083).
Multivariate regression
Lithium levels remained as a significant predictor in the
unweighted multivariate model (Table 2). Lithium also remained

Both multivariate models (Table 2) were tested for multi-

revealed no autocorrelation of data.
Discussion
The results of this study indicate that lithium levels in drinking
water are inversely associated with suicide rates and SMRs for
suicide. We improved Ohgami et al’s model and replicated their
findings of inverse association between suicide mortality and
lithium levels in Oita prefecture on the basis of Austrian data. A
strength of our study is that data on lithium concentrations were
based on 6460 water measurements in comparison to 79.8
Together with suicide SMRs, they were aggregated to 99 data-pairs
– in contrast to 27 and 18 in previous studies.7,8 Sensitivity
analyses of the univariate models did not challenge the robustness
of the findings. Also, adjustment for well-known socioeconomic
confounders, which previously have been shown to be important
predictors of suicide mortality in Austria,11 did not affect the
association with lithium concentrations in drinking water. The
WLS procedure produced distortions of regression estimates
especially in the separate gender analyses. The effects of lithium
in drinking water on males and females were marginally
significant. It has to be noted that the variables such as lithium
levels, per capita income, proportion of Roman Catholics and
the availability of mental health providers could not be stratified
by gender for separate analyses, thus the estimates for both
genders in our study and also in the Japanese study8 are likely
to be biased. Therefore marginal significance may be considered
as a sign of robustness. Also, a further stratification of the data,
for example by age groups, would lead to a further collapse of
the power of the analysis due to decreasing cell counts per
stratum.
Sources of lithium intake
Although it can be assumed that lithium in drinking water
explains a part of the variance in suicide mortality, other possible
lithium sources should be mentioned. Ohgami and colleagues8
were criticised for having omitted consideration of individuals’
intake of bottled mineral water,9 which may contain high levels
of lithium.15 They were also criticised for not having accounted
for the consumption of vegetables,16 which absorb lithium from
the soil and may be a complimentary lithium source.4 For obvious
reasons, data for both of these factors are not available at aggregate
levels; hence we were unable to consider these factors. It has also
been considered that lithium could play a role during the cooking
process.15 Indeed, lithium as a salt is likely to be taken up from
drinking water into vegetables and animal-derived food and vice
versa during osmotic processes. Lithium levels in food would then
regress to the levels of local cooking/drinking water. A further
source of lithium intake has not been mentioned in this
discussion. It has not been considered before that tap water is also
used for personal hygiene and it is known that lithium may be
taken up percutaneously.17 Therefore it needs to be considered
whether the large water volumes used during bathing and
showering could be an additional source of natural lithium. It is
likely that transdermal and per os intake of lithium reflects local
water lithium levels in Austria.
Lithium intake and excretion
It has been demonstrated that urinary excretion of lithium
correlates with rainfall, due to a dilution effect of rainfall on
ground water18 and that urinary lithium levels correlate with
lithium levels in drinking water and the amount of water
consumed per day.5 Lithium is absorbed via sodium channels in
the small intestine and uniformly distributed in body water,
although others have found differences in lithium levels between
tissues4 and plasma and brain concentrations.19 Because renal
clearance is not dependent on plasma lithium levels, plasma levels
are proportional to daily intake.20 Although excreted mainly by
the kidney, approximately 80% of lithium is reabsorbed by the
proximal renal tubule.21 Excretion of lithium is dependent on
the glomerular filtration rate and therefore affected by renal
diseases and age, conditions in which plasma lithium increases.
On the other hand, dehydration (and loss of salt) decreases the
clearance of lithium.19 These considerations suggest that water
intake has at least a twofold effect on plasma lithium levels, and
that lithium retention is probable when intake of water is reduced.
Estimated effects
Lithium concentrations in drinking water vary considerably by
geographic region4,5 and correlate with natural lithium resources.
In northern Chile, a region with one of the largest lithium
resources in the world located in the Salar de Atacama,22 the
natural concentrations of lithium in ground water may reach up
to 5.2 mg/l, leading to a natural daily intake of lithium of up to
10 mg/day.4,5 This is relatively high in comparison to the highest
level of 1.3 mg/l measured in Austria. In our study, regional
lithium concentrations explained only one part of the suicide
mortality variance, namely up to 17% in the crude model and
3.9% in the adjusted and weighted model. Although the direction
of the association and the significance of the statistical models
were
robust
after
sensitivity
analyses
and
adjustment
for
confounders, the explained variance varied between the models.
Adding variables to the multivariate models increased the total
variance explained and suppressed the variance explained by
lithium, although multicollinearity was absent. Finally, there is still
considerable unexplained variance that is unaccounted for. It has
to be noted that ecological studies per se are designed to establish
hypotheses rather then proving cause, and their results are not
applicable to individual cases (ecological fallacy). Thus, although
informative, the estimates should be interpreted with caution
due to the aggregated nature of data. In the crude model (online
Fig. DS3), an increase of lithium concentration in drinking water
by 0.01 mg/l was associated with a decrease in the suicide rate of
1.4 per 100 000 or a 7.2% reduction in the SMR for suicide. This
would correspond to one conventional lithium pill (75 mg) in
7400 l
(1955
gallons)
of
drinking
water.
Despite
evolving
evidence, the debate on whether continuous low-level lithium
intake has protective effects on mental health and suicide risk
should be further pursued. Although national suicide prevention
programmes are increasingly implemented by politicians in many
countries and researchers are seeking for effective preventive
interventions,23 it is a highly controversial question whether
349
 Kapusta et al
adding lithium to tap water would reduce suicide mortality as
previously
suggested.24
It
has
to
be
noted
that
lithium
concentrations increase in the brain during the first trimester of
gestation4 and early exposure to lithium may cause damage in
human brain neurodevelopment.25 Lithium acts on mood and
suicidality via complex interactions with the serotoninergic
system26 and more recent studies suggest that lithium has
stimulating effects on neurogenesis,27 which could explain both
toxicity during neurodevelopment as well as antidepressive/
antisuicidal effects. Therefore, currently, not enough is known
about the effects of natural lithium on the prevalence of
neurodevelopmental disorders to consider artificially increasing
its levels in drinking water as a method of universal prevention.
Implications
Owing to the sizeable magnitude of our finding, we provide
conclusive evidence that lithium concentrations in drinking water
are inversely correlated with suicide rates. Starting with anecdotic
reports about the beneficial effects of lithium in drinking water on
mental health in 1949 and earlier,1 there is increasing evidence
from three independent countries and continents that lithium in
drinking water is associated with reduced mortality from suicide.
In Texas, USA, lithium levels in drinking water were shown to be
inversely
associated
with
admissions
and
readmissions
for
psychoses, neuroses and personality disorders in state mental
hospitals, as well as with homicide rates,18,28 suicide and crime
rates.7 In Oita prefecture in Japan, lithium levels in tap water
supplies were recently shown to be inversely associated with
suicide mortality.8 Of note, in 1969, lithium in drinking water
was
widely
discussed
as
possibly
having
an
impact
on
atherosclerotic heart disease29,30 but this has not led to preventive
supplementation of lithium in drinking water. Certainly, with
these findings in mind, the true effects of chronic low-lithium
intake on health and suicide should be investigated further.31
