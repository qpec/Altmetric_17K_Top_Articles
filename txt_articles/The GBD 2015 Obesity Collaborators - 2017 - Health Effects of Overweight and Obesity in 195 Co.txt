BACKGROUND
Although the rising pandemic of obesity has received major attention in many 
countries, the effects of this attention on trends and the disease burden of obe-
sity remain uncertain.
METHODS
We analyzed data from 68.5 million persons to assess the trends in the prevalence 
of overweight and obesity among children and adults between 1980 and 2015. Using 
the Global Burden of Disease study data and methods, we also quantified the 
burden of disease related to high body-mass index (BMI), according to age, sex, 
cause, and BMI in 195 countries between 1990 and 2015.
RESULTS
In 2015, a total of 107.7 million children and 603.7 million adults were obese. 
Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries and 
has continuously increased in most other countries. Although the prevalence of 
obesity among children has been lower than that among adults, the rate of in-
crease in childhood obesity in many countries has been greater than the rate of 
increase in adult obesity. High BMI accounted for 4.0 million deaths globally, 
nearly 40% of which occurred in persons who were not obese. More than two 
thirds of deaths related to high BMI were due to cardiovascular disease. The dis-
ease burden related to high BMI has increased since 1990; however, the rate of this 
increase has been attenuated owing to decreases in underlying rates of death from 
cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS
The rapid increase in the prevalence and disease burden of elevated BMI highlights 
the need for continued focus on surveillance of BMI and identification, implemen-
tation, and evaluation of evidence-based interventions to address this problem.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
he prevalence of overweight and 
obesity is increasing worldwide.1 Epidemio-
logic studies have identified high body-
mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms di-
vided by the square of the height in meters) as a 
risk factor for an expanding set of chronic dis-
eases, including cardiovascular disease,2,3 diabe-
tes mellitus, chronic kidney disease,2 many can-
cers,4 and an array of musculoskeletal disorders.5,6 
As the global health community works to develop 
treatments and prevention policies to address 
obesity, timely information about levels of high 
BMI and health effects at the population level is 
needed.
In recent years, increasing efforts have been 
made to assess the trends in BMI within and 
across nations.7,8 Other studies have quantified 
the potential effects of high BMI on a variety of 
health outcomes.2,4 These efforts, while useful, 
did not consider the relationship of high BMI 
with broader socioeconomic development; they 
also excluded many data sources, focused exclu-
sively on adults, inadequately captured the skewed 
distribution of BMI, did not capture emerging 
evidence on additional outcomes, and did not 
assess the effect of epidemiologic and demo-
graphic transition on disease burden. The BMI 
that is associated with the lowest risk of death 
has also been questioned.9,10
To address these gaps in knowledge, we sys-
tematically evaluated the trends in the prevalence 
of overweight and obesity as well as the patterns 
of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years related 
to high BMI, according to age and sex, in 195 
countries. This analysis supersedes all previous 
results from the Global Burden of Disease study 
with respect to high BMI by comprehensively 
reanalyzing all data from 1990 through 2015 
using consistent methods and definitions.
Methods
Prevalence and Disease Burden  
of Overweight and Obesity
We systematically estimated the prevalence of 
overweight and obesity among children (<20 years 
of age) and adults between 1980 and 2015. Using 
the comparative-risk-assessment approach from 
the Global Burden of Disease study, we also 
quantified the burden of disease related to high 
BMI during the period from 1990 through 2015. 
The burden of disease was assessed by deaths 
and disability-adjusted life-years, a composite 
metric computed as the sum of years lived with 
disability and years of life lost due to high BMI. 
In this analysis, we used the distribution of BMI 
according to age, sex, country, and year; the ef-
fect size of the change in BMI on disease end 
points; the BMI associated with the lowest risk 
of death from all causes; and disease-specific 
mortality and morbidity according to age, sex, 
country, and year.
Global Distribution of BMI
We systematically searched Medline for studies 
that provide nationally or subnationally represen-
tative estimates of BMI, overweight, or obesity 
among children or adults. We included studies if 
they used standard cutoff points of BMI to de-
fine overweight (BMI, 25 to 29) and obesity 
(BMI, ≥30) among adults or standards of the 
International Obesity Task Force to define over-
weight and obesity among children. The search 
terms, selection criteria, and flow diagrams of 
screening are provided in the Methods section in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org. In addition, 
we searched the Global Health Data Exchange 
(http://ghdx 
. 
healthdata 
. 
org) for multicountry sur-
vey programs, national surveys, and longitudinal 
studies that provide self-reported or measured 
data on height and weight for children or adults.
With respect to data regarding adults, we 
identified 1276 unique data sources (855 mea-
sured and 421 self-report) from 176 countries 
that provide data on BMI, 1333 sources (802 
measured and 531 self-report) from 176 countries 
that provide data on overweight, and 1514 sources 
(713 measured and 801 self-report) from 174 
countries that provide data on obesity. With re-
spect to data regarding children, we identified 
1211 unique data sources (800 measured and 
411 self-report) from 173 countries that provide 
data on BMI, 1236 sources (832 measured and 
404 self-report) from 174 countries that provide 
data on overweight, and 1437 sources (928 mea-
sured and 509 self-report) from 175 countries 
that provide data on obesity. Using mixed-effects 
linear-regression models, we separately estimated 
and corrected for self-reporting bias among men 
and women according to geographic region and 
age group. We characterized the age and sex pat-
terns for BMI, overweight, and obesity and ap-
plied these patterns to split aggregated data into

Health Effects of Overweight and Obesity in 195 Countries
5-year age groups according to sex (see the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).
We used spatiotemporal Gaussian process re-
gression to estimate the mean prevalence of obe-
sity and overweight.11 To improve our estimates 
in data-sparse countries, we tested a wide range 
of covariates with plausible relationships to over-
weight and obesity. We selected three country-
level covariates with best fit and coefficients in 
the expected direction, as have been used in 
other studies.8 These factors included 10-year 
lag-distributed energy intake (i.e., time-weighted 
average of daily energy intake) per capita, the 
absolute latitude of the country, and the propor-
tion of persons living in urban areas. To estimate 
the mean BMI, we first used mixed-effects linear 
regression to characterize the relationship be-
tween BMI, overweight, and obesity in sources 
containing information on all three measures. 
We applied the coefficients of this regression to 
the prevalence of overweight and of obesity gen-
erated through spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression to estimate the mean BMI for each 
country, according to age, sex, and year. Among 
the 195 countries and territories that are included 
in the present study, data regarding overweight, 
obesity, or BMI were unavailable for only 8: 
Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Brunei, Northern 
Mariana Islands, Saint Vincent and the Grena-
dines, the Bahamas, Turkmenistan, and Vene-
zuela. The estimates in these countries were 
constructed purely from the covariates used in 
the estimation of the linear model and the weight-
ed and smoothed residuals from data for neigh-
boring countries.
To identify the appropriate distribution of 
BMI at the population level, we examined how 
various distributions (i.e., log-normal, gamma, 
inverse Gaussian, and beta) approximated the 
distribution of actual data from national surveys 
in six countries; the best fit was provided by the 
beta distribution.12 We characterized the shape 
of the beta distribution on the basis of the mean 
BMI and the prevalence of overweight and obe-
sity in each country according to age, sex, and 
year. Details of this approach have been de-
scribed previously.12
Effect of High BMI on Health Outcomes
We used Bradford Hill’s criteria for causation 
and the evidence-grading criteria of the World 
Cancer Research Fund to systematically evaluate 
epidemiologic evidence supporting the causal re-
lationship between high BMI and various disease 
end points among adults 25 years of age or older.13 
We found convincing or probable evidence for an 
association with 20 health outcomes (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). For each outcome, 
we obtained the relative risk from a dose–response 
meta-analysis of prospective observational stud-
ies (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Using pooled analyses of prospective cohort 
studies, we estimated the relative risk associated 
with a change of five units of BMI in 5-year age 
groups for ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, 
hemorrhagic stroke, hypertensive heart disease, 
and diabetes mellitus. For breast cancer, we cal-
culated the relative risk for premenopausal and 
postmenopausal women according to region (as 
specified in the Global Burden of Disease study) 
because of evidence that overweight and obesity 
have a protective effect against breast cancer in 
premenopausal women in all countries except for 
the Asia–Pacific regions,14,15 whereas a positive 
association between high BMI and the incidence 
of postmenopausal breast cancer has been ob-
served worldwide.15
The Lowest-Risk BMI
We used the most recent pooled analysis of pro-
spective observational studies to determine the 
BMI associated with the lowest overall risk of 
death.9 To address the limitations of previous 
studies on this topic, which have included re-
sidual confounding among smokers and reverse 
causation due to preexisting chronic diseases,10 
the analysis was restricted to never-smokers 
without identified chronic diseases who survived 
5 years after recruitment. The lowest overall risk 
of death was observed for a BMI of 20 to 25.
Statistical Analysis
To quantify the burden of disease related to high 
BMI for each disease end point, we calculated 
the population attributable fraction according to 
country, age, sex, and year.16 We computed the 
numbers of deaths and disability-adjusted life-
years related to high BMI for each country, ac-
cording to age, sex, year, and cause, by multiply-
ing the population attributable fraction by the 
total number of deaths or disability-adjusted life-
years, as estimated in the Global Burden of Dis-
ease study for that country, age, sex, year, and 
cause. We calculated the total disease burden

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
related to high BMI as the sum of disease-specific 
burdens. To understand where in the distribu-
tion of BMI most of the burden occurs, we es-
timated population attributable fractions for 
three ranges of BMI (20 to 24, 25 to 29, and ≥30) 
and for five groups of disease end points (car-
diovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic 
kidney disease, cancers, and musculoskeletal dis-
orders).
Using the methods developed by Das Gupta,17 
we broke down the change in the numbers of 
deaths and the numbers of disability-adjusted 
life-years that are attributed to high BMI be-
tween population growth, population age struc-
ture, risk exposure to high BMI, and rates of 
risk-deleted mortality and disability-adjusted life-
years. (Risk-deleted rates are the burden of dis-
ease in the absence of the risk factor — for ex-
ample, rates of death from cardiovascular disease 
that would have been observed if everyone had 
been at the lowest-risk BMI.)
We computed 95% uncertainty intervals for 
all results using Monte Carlo simulations, keep-
ing 1000 draws of each quantity of interest to 
propagate uncertainty into final estimates. The 
model included uncertainty from examination 
surveys, the relative risks for each outcome from 
the pooled analyses or meta-analyses of cohorts, 
the lowest-risk BMI, and the number of deaths 
and disability-adjusted life-years estimated for 
each country, age, sex, year, and outcome from 
the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study. Ac-
cording to the methods outlined in that study, 
we used a sociodemographic index (SDI) — a 
summary measure of lag-distributed income per 
capita, average educational attainment among 
persons over the age of 15 years, and total fertil-
ity rate — to position countries on the develop-
ment continuum. We then generated quintiles of 
SDI to categorize countries as low, low-middle, 
middle, high-middle, and high development level 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).13
Results
Prevalence of Obesity (1980–2015)
Global Level
In 2015, we estimated that 107.7 million children 
(uncertainty interval, 101.1 to 115.1) and 603.7 mil-
lion adults (uncertainty interval, 592.9 to 615.6) 
were obese worldwide. The overall prevalence of 
obesity was 5.0% among children and 12.0% 
among adults. Among adults, the prevalence of 
obesity was generally higher among women than 
among men in all age brackets (Fig. 1). The peak 
in the prevalence of obesity was observed between 
the ages of 60 and 64 years among women and 
between the ages of 50 and 54 years among 
men. The rates of increase in obesity between 
1980 and 2015 did not differ significantly be-
tween women and men in any age bracket; for 
both groups, the rates of increase were highest 
in early adulthood. Among children, the preva-
lence of obesity in 2015 decreased with age until 
the age of 14 years and then increased; no sex 
differences were observed in obesity prevalence 
before the age of 20 years. Between 1980 and 
2015, the rates of increase in global childhood 
obesity were equal for boys and girls in all age 
brackets.
SDI Level
In 2015, at all SDI levels and for all age groups, 
the prevalence of obesity was generally higher for 
women than for men, with the highest preva-
lence among women between the ages of 60 to 64 
years living in countries with a high SDI (Fig. 1). 
In general, the prevalence of obesity among both 
women and men increased with the increase in 
the SDI across all age groups. An exception was 
the prevalence of obesity among women living in 
countries with a low SDI, since after the age of 
55 years, the prevalence was higher than that 
observed for women in countries with a low-
middle SDI (Fig. 1). During the period from 1980 
to 2015, the most rapid relative increase in the 
prevalence of obesity occurred among men be-
tween the ages of 25 and 29 years who were 
living in countries with a low-middle SDI — 
from 1.1% (uncertainty interval, 0.9 to 1.5) in 
1980 to 3.8% (95% uncertainty interval, 3.1 to 
4.8) in 2015. During the same time period, the 
prevalence of obesity increased by a factor of 1.7 
among both men and women in countries with 
a low-middle SDI.

Health Effects of Overweight and Obesity in 195 Countries
Among children, the prevalence of obesity 
was greater in countries with higher SDI levels 
(Fig. 1). At most SDI levels, the prevalence of 
obesity was lowest among both boys and girls 
between ages of 10 and 14 years. In countries 
with high and high-middle SDI levels, the preva-
lence was generally greater among boys than 
among girls, although this difference reversed 
beginning with late adolescence (Fig. 1). Between 
1980 and 2015, there was a significant relative 
increase of 20.0% (95% uncertainty interval, 5.5 
to 35.3) in the prevalence of obesity in countries 
with a low SDI among both girls and boys. Dur-
ing that period, the highest rates of increase 
were observed in countries with a middle SDI 
among both girls and boys.
National Level
The prevalence of obesity among children and 
adults has doubled in 73 countries since 1980 
and has shown a continuous increase in most 
other countries. Although the prevalence of 
childhood obesity has been lower than the 
prevalence of adult obesity, the rate of increase 
in childhood obesity in many countries has been 
greater than the rate of increase in adult obesity. 
The estimated age-standardized prevalence of 
overweight and obesity among children and 
adults for all 195 countries and territories is 
provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. A complete data set of all results for 
each country according to age, sex, and year is 
available on the Global Health Data Exchange 
website (http://ghdx 
. 
healthdata 
. 
org/ 
), and an in-
teractive data visualization of the prevalence of 
overweight and obesity is provided online (https:/ 
/ 
vizhub 
. 
healthdata 
. 
org/ 
obesity/ 
). Here we high-
light the findings related to obesity in the most 
populous countries (Fig. 2).
In 2015, among the 20 most populous coun-
tries, the highest level of age-standardized adult 
obesity was observed in Egypt (35.3%; 95% un-
certainty interval, 33.6 to 37.1), and the highest 
level of age-standardized childhood obesity was 
observed in the United States (12.7%; 95% un-
certainty interval, 12.2 to 13.2). The prevalence 
was lowest among adults in Vietnam (1.6%; 95% 
uncertainty interval, 1.4 to 2.0) and among chil-
dren in Bangladesh (1.2%; 95% uncertainty in-
terval, 0.9 to 1.7). Between 1980 and 2015, the 
age-standardized prevalence of obesity increased 
by a factor of 2 or more in 13 of the 20 coun-
tries; only the Democratic Republic of Congo 
had no increase (Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). In 2015, China and India 
had the highest numbers of obese children, 
whereas the United States and China had the 
highest numbers of obese adults.
Burden of Disease Related to High BMI  
(1990–2015)
Global Level
In 2015, high BMI contributed to 4.0 million 
deaths (95% uncertainty interval, 2.7 to 5.3), 
which represented 7.1% (95% uncertainty inter-
val, 4.9 to 9.6) of the deaths from any cause; it 
also contributed to 120 million disability-adjust-
ed life-years (95% uncertainty interval, 84 to 
158), which represented 4.9% (95% uncertainty 
interval, 3.5 to 6.4) of disability-adjusted life-
years from any cause among adults globally. A 
total of 39% of the deaths and 37% of the dis-
ability-adjusted life-years that were related to 
high BMI occurred in persons with a BMI of less 
than 30 (Fig. 3).
Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause 
of death and disability-adjusted life-years related 
to high BMI and accounted for 2.7 million 
deaths (95% uncertainty interval, 1.8 to 3.7) and 
66.3 million disability-adjusted life-years (95% 
uncertainty interval, 45.3 to 88.5) (Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Globally, 41% of 
BMI-related deaths and 34% of BMI-related dis-
ability-adjusted life-years were due to cardiovas-
cular disease among obese persons. Diabetes 
was the second leading cause of BMI-related 
deaths in 2015 and contributed to 0.6 million 
deaths (95% uncertainty interval, 0.4 to 0.7) and

Health Effects of Overweight and Obesity in 195 Countries
30.4 million disability-adjusted life-years (95% 
uncertainty interval, 21.5 to 39.9); among all 
BMI-related deaths that were due to diabetes, 
9.5% occurred at a BMI of 30 or more and 4.5% 
occurred at a BMI of less than 30. Chronic kid-
ney disease was the second leading cause of 
BMI-related disability-adjusted life-years in 2015; 
18.0% of disability-adjusted life-years occurred 
at a BMI of 30 or more and 7.2% at a BMI of less 
than 30. Chronic kidney disease and cancers 
each accounted for less than 10% of all BMI-re-
lated deaths in 2015, whereas cancers, diabetes, 
and musculoskeletal disorders each contributed 
less than 10% of BMI-related disability-adjusted 
life-years (Fig. 3).
High BMI also accounted for 28.6 million years 
lived with disability (95% uncertainty interval, 
17.8 to 41.4), which accounted for 3.6% (95% 
uncertainty interval, 2.7 to 4.6) of years lived 
with disability due to any cause globally. Diabe-
tes was the leading cause of years lived with 
disability related to BMI (17.1 million; 95% uncer-
tainty interval, 10.6 to 24.4), followed by musculo-
skeletal disorders (5.7 million; 95% uncertainty 
interval, 3.4 to 8.8) and cardiovascular disease 
(3.3 million; 95% uncertainty interval, 2.0 to 4.9).
From 1990 through 2015, there was a relative 
increase of 28.3% in the global rate of death 
related to high BMI, from 41.9 deaths per 
100,000 population in 1990 to 53.7 deaths per 
100,000 population in 2015. However, there was 
no significant change in age-standardized rates 
of death during this period, with a rate of 64.0 
(95% uncertainty interval, 41.7 to 89.7) per 
100,000 population in 1990 and 60.2 (95% un-
certainty interval, 41.4 to 81.5) per 100,000 
population in 2015. Similarly, during the same 
period, there was a relative increase of 35.8% in 
the rate of BMI-related disability-adjusted life-
years, from 1200 per 100,000 population to 1630 
per 100,000 population, whereas there was no 
significant change in age-standardized rates. 
Globally, the increases in BMI-related deaths and 
disability-adjusted life-years due to population 
growth, population aging, and increasing risk 
exposure were partially offset by reductions in 
underlying rates of death and disability-adjusted 
life-years (Fig. 4). Of the disease end points that

were considered in this study, decreases in risk-
deleted rates of death from cardiovascular disease 
contributed the most to this pattern. Changes that 
were due to the risk of exposure to elevated BMI 
and aging of the population were roughly equal in 
terms of their contribution to the percent changes 
in BMI-related deaths and disability-adjusted life-
years globally from 1990 through 2015.
SDI Level
In 2015, the age-standardized rates of BMI-related 
deaths and disability-adjusted life-years were 
greatest in countries with high-middle SDI levels, 
with a rate of death of 68.1 (95% uncertainty 
interval, 47.1 to 91.6) per 100,000 population 
and a rate of disability-adjusted life-years of 
1890 (95% uncertainty interval, 1330 to 2460) 
per 100,000 population. The rates of both mea-
sures were lowest in countries with high SDI 
levels, with a rate of death of 52.6 (95% uncer-
tainty interval, 38.7 to 67.9) per 100,000 popula-
tion and a rate of disability-adjusted life-years of 
1530 (95% uncertainty interval, 1160 to 1920) 
per 100,000 population. The rate of BMI-related 
deaths increased between 1990 and 2015 at all 
SDI levels, with the highest observed rate of 90.6 
(95% uncertainty interval, 65.8 to 117.3) per 
100,000 population occurring in countries with 
a high SDI in 2005. The age-standardized rates 
of death in countries with high or high-middle 
SDI decreased between 1990 and 2015; in the 
lowest quintiles of SDI, age-standardized BMI-
related rates of death increased. With increasing 
SDI levels, the contribution of risk-deleted mortal-
ity to the percent change in BMI-related deaths 
increased, whereas the contribution of popula-
tion growth to the percent change in BMI-related 
deaths decreased (Fig. 4). The contribution of risk 
exposure to the percent change in BMI-related 
deaths was also generally inversely related to the 
SDI. Patterns in the breakdown of the sources of 
change in BMI-related disability-adjusted life-
years were parallel to those observed for mortal-
ity. In a disease-specific breakdown, risk-deleted 
mortality and disability-adjusted life-years showed 
a declining trend for most causes across all SDI 
levels (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The largest decreases in the risk-deleted rates of 
death and disability-adjusted life-years were ob-
served for cardiovascular disease, whereas can-
cers and musculoskeletal disorders showed the 
least decline.
National Level
In 2015, among the 20 most populous countries, 
the highest rates of BMI-related death and dis-
ability-adjusted life-years were observed in Russia, 
and the lowest rates were observed in the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo (Fig. S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Between 1990 and 2015, the 
greatest percent changes in age-standardized BMI-
related deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
occurred in Bangladesh, with relative increases 
of 133.6% (95% uncertainty interval, 66.3 to 
265.7) and 139.4% (95% uncertainty interval, 
77.2 to 273.0), respectively. During the same 
period, Turkey had the largest significant de-
crease in age-standardized BMI-related burden, 
with a decrease of 43.7% (95% uncertainty interval, 
36.9 to 49.8) in deaths and 37.2% (95% uncertainty 
interval, 29.9 to 44.0) in disability-adjusted life-
years (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In our systematic evaluation of the health effects 
of high BMI, we found that excess body weight 
accounted for about 4 million deaths and 120 
million disability-adjusted life-years worldwide in 
2015. Nearly 70% of the deaths that were related 
to high BMI were due to cardiovascular disease, 
and more than 60% of those deaths occurred 
among obese persons. The prevalence of obesity 
has increased during the past three decades and 
at a faster pace than the related disease burden. 
However, both the trend and magnitude of the 
BMI-related disease burden vary widely across 
countries.
Among the leading health risks that were 
assessed in the Global Burden of Disease 2015 
study, high BMI continues to have one of the 
highest rates of increase. Across levels of devel-
opment, the prevalence of obesity has increased 
over recent decades, which indicates that the 
problem is not simply a function of income or 
wealth.13 Changes in the food environment and 
food systems are probably major drivers.18 In-
creased availability, accessibility, and affordabil-
ity of energy-dense foods, along with intense 
marketing of such foods, could explain excess 
energy intake and weight gain among different 
populations.18 The reduced opportunities for phys-
ical activity that have followed urbanization and 
other changes in the built environment have also 
been considered as potential drivers; however,

Health Effects of Overweight and Obesity in 195 Countries
these changes generally preceded the global in-
crease in obesity and are less likely to be major 
contributors.18
During the past decade, researchers have pro-
posed a range of interventions to reduce obe-
sity.19 Among such interventions are restricting 
the advertisement of unhealthy foods to children, 
improving school meals, using taxation to re-
duce consumption of unhealthy foods and pro-
viding subsidies to increase intake of healthy 
foods, and using supply-chain incentives to in-
crease the production of healthy foods.19 How-
ever, the effectiveness, feasibility of widespread 
implementation, and sustainability of such inter-
ventions need to be evaluated in various settings. 
In recent years, some countries have started to 
implement some of these policies,1 but no major 
population success has yet been shown. Many of 
the countries with the highest increases in the 
prevalence of obesity are those that have a low 
or middle SDI and simultaneously have high rates 
of other forms of malnutrition. These countries 
generally have limited financial resources for 
nutrition programs and mostly rely on external 
donors whose programs often preferentially tar-
get undernutrition; consequently, food security 
frequently takes precedence over obesity in these 
countries.20 In 2013, the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) called for zero increase in the preva-
lence of overweight among children and in the 
prevalence of obesity among adults.21 However, 
given the current pace of increase and the exist-
ing challenges in implementing food policies, 
achieving this goal appears unlikely in the near 
future.
Our study showed a greater increase in the 
rate of exposure to high BMI than in the rate of 
the related disease burden. This difference was 
driven mainly by the decline in risk-deleted mor-
tality, particularly for cardiovascular disease; fac-
tors such as improved treatment or changes in 
other risks have resulted in decreases in the rate 
of cardiovascular disease despite increases in BMI. 
Existing evidence-based policies, even if fully 
implemented, are unlikely to rapidly reduce the 
prevalence of obesity. Clinical interventions, how-
ever, have proved to be effective in controlling 
high levels of systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, 
and fasting plasma glucose — the major risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease.22 The expand-
ed use of such interventions among overweight 
and obese persons could effectively reduce the 
disease burden related to high BMI. A recent 
pooled cohort analysis involving 1.8 million par-
ticipants showed that nearly half the excess risk 
for ischemic heart disease and more than 75% 
of the excess risk for stroke that was related to 
high BMI were mediated through a combination 
of raised levels of blood pressure, total serum 
cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose.23 To-
gether, these findings suggest that clinical inter-
ventions to reduce the underlying rate of cardio-
vascular disease could substantially reduce the 
burden of disease related to high BMI, although 
maintaining a normal body weight remains nec-
essary to achieve full benefit.
Globally, 39% of deaths and 37% of disability-
adjusted life-years that were related to high BMI 
occurred among nonobese persons. Although 
some studies have suggested that overweight is 
associated with a lower risk of death from any 
cause than is a normal range of BMI (18 to 
25),2,10 recent evidence from a meta-analysis14 and 
pooled analysis9 of prospective observational 
studies showed a continuous increase in the risk 
of death associated with a BMI of more than 25. 
These studies are particularly notable since they 
addressed major sources of bias in previous stud-
ies (i.e., residual confounding due to smoking 
and reverse causation due to preexisting chronic 
disease) by restricting the analysis to persons 
who had never smoked and who did not have 
chronic diseases. In addition, the pooled-cohort 
analysis controlled for the same set of covariates, 
provided cause-specific relative risks, and evalu-
ated the relationship between BMI and mortality 
across different regions. The balance of evidence 
thus supports our minimum risk level of 20 to 
25 for BMI. At the same time, to date, there re-
mains insufficient evidence to support the argu-
ment that the most beneficial level of BMI should 
vary according to geographic location or ethnic 
group9 because of differences in the relationship 
between BMI and body-fat distribution.
We found that 5% of the disability-adjusted 
life-years that were related to high BMI were 
from musculoskeletal disorders. Although high 
BMI is a major risk factor contributing to years 
lived with disability globally, and the economic 
costs associated with treatment are substantial,24 
these nonfatal but debilitating health outcomes 
have received comparatively little policy attention. 
Weight loss is beneficial in the prevention and 
treatment of musculoskeletal pain.25 A combina-

tion of modest weight loss and moderate exer-
cise provides better overall improvement in mus-
culoskeletal pain than either intervention alone26; 
however, surgical interventions may be most 
effective for the morbidly obese.27
Our systematic evaluation of prospective ob-
servational studies showed sufficient evidence 
supporting a causal relationship between high 
BMI and cancers of the esophagus, colon and 
rectum, liver, gallbladder and biliary tract, pan-
creas, breast, uterus, ovary, kidney, and thyroid, 
along with leukemia. A recent review by the Inter-
national Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)4 
comes to largely similar conclusions, except with 
respect to leukemia. (We included leukemia on 
the basis of a systematic review and meta-analy-
sis of 21 prospective cohort studies.28) In addition, 
even though the IARC report acknowledged con-
sistent inverse associations between BMI and the 
risk of premenopausal breast cancer, inconsistent 
findings from studies that evaluated the effect 
of waist circumference or body-weight gain re-
sulted in the exclusion of premenopausal breast 
cancer from its list. However, since high BMI 
was the exposure of interest in our analysis, we 
included the protective effect of high BMI on 
breast cancer in premenopausal women. We did 
not evaluate the effect of high BMI on gastric 
cancer (cardia) and meningioma because of a 
lack of sufficient data to separately estimate the 
incidence and mortality of these cancers at the 
population level.
Our study has several important strengths. 
We have addressed the major limitations of pre-
vious studies by including more data sources 
and quantifying the prevalence of obesity among 
children. We also systematically evaluated the 
strength of evidence for the causal relationship 
between high BMI and health outcomes and in-
cluded all BMI–outcome pairs for which suffi-
cient evidence with respect to causal relationship 
was available. We used a beta distribution to 
characterize the distribution of BMI at the popu-
lation level, a method that captures the propor-
tion of the population with high BMI more accu-
rately than other distributions.12 We used the best 
available evidence to determine the lowest-risk 
BMI. We quantified the trends in high BMI and 
the associated disease burden across levels of 
development and estimated the contribution of 
demographic transition and epidemiologic tran-
sition to changes in BMI-related burden.
The potential limitations of our study should 
also be considered. We used both self-reported 
and measured data with respect to height and 
weight and corrected the bias in self-reported 
data using measured data at each age, sex, and 
geographic region. To apply a consistent defini-
tion for childhood overweight and obesity across 
sources, we used the definition of the Interna-
tional Obesity Task Force and excluded studies 
that used the WHO definition. We did not propa-
gate the uncertainty in the age pattern and sex 
pattern that were used to split the aggregated 
data. We did not incorporate the uncertainty of 
the BMI regression coefficients in our analysis. 
Data were sparse for some locations, particularly 
in earlier years, and estimates in these locations 
were based on country-level covariates and re-
gional data. We did not identify a consistent 
pattern in the relationship between nationally 
representative data and data representing only 
urban or rural areas and were not able to correct 
those data for potential bias. We did not evaluate 
the trends in other measures of adiposity that 
may better relate to specific health outcomes, 
including waist circumference and waist-to-hip 
ratio. Since we obtained the effect size of BMI 
on health outcomes from prospective observa-
tional studies, the possibility of confounding by 
lifestyle habits cannot be excluded. Our estima-
tion of relative risks did not capture possible 
differences owing to ethnic group and did not 
account for the possibility of geographic varia-
tion in relative-risk curves or the lowest-risk 
BMI. In addition, these studies generally ex-
cluded people with prevalent chronic diseases 
from the analysis of relative-risk estimation. 
Thus, our estimates represent the effect of BMI 
among persons without underlying diseases. 
This issue might be particularly important for 
older age groups, in which the prevalence of 
chronic disease increases. Final 
ly, other prob-
able complications or forms of BMI-related bur-
den (e.g., disease burden in children) were not 
included.
In conclusion, our study provides a compre-
hensive assessment of the trends in high BMI 
and the associated disease burden. Our results 
show that both the prevalence and disease bur-
den of high BMI are increasing globally. These 
findings highlight the need for implementation 
of multicomponent interventions to reduce the 
prevalence and disease burden of high BMI.
