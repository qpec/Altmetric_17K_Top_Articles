Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and
Recent Acute Coronary Syndromes
From the EXAMINE Trial
Diabetes Care 2016;39:1267–1273 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0303
OBJECTIVE
We evaluated the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death in all Examination of Cardio-
vascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) study par-
ticipants and in those who experienced an on-study, major nonfatal CV event.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The study randomly assigned 5,380 patients with type 2 diabetes to alogliptin or
placebo within 15 to 90 days of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Deaths and
nonfatal CV events (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, hospitalized heart failure
[HHF], and hospitalization for unstable angina [UA]) were adjudicated. Patients
were monitored until censoring or death, regardless of a prior postrandomized
nonfatal CV event. Time-updated multivariable Cox models were used to estimate
the risk of death in the absence of or after each nonfatal event.
RESULTS
Rates of CV death were 4.1% for alogliptin and 4.9% for placebo (hazard ratio [HR]
0.85; 95% CI 0.66, 1.10). A total of 736 patients (13.7%) experienced a first nonfatal
CV event (5.9% MI, 1.1% stroke, 3.0% HHF, and 3.8% UA). Compared with patients
not experiencing a nonfatal event, the adjusted HR (95% CI) for death was 3.12
after MI (2.13, 4.58; P < 0.0001) 4.96 after HHF (3.29, 7.47; P < 0.0001), 3.08 after
stroke (1.29, 7.37; P = 0.011), and 1.66 after UA (0.81, 3.37; P = 0.164). Mortality
rates after a nonfatal event were comparable for alogliptin and placebo.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with type 2 diabetes and a recent ACS, the risk of CV death was higher
after a postrandomization, nonfatal CV event, particularly heart failure, compared
with those who did not experience a CV event. The risk of CV death was similar
between alogliptin and placebo.
Type 2 diabetes is associated with excess cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality
due to myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke (1,2). Heart failure is also a significant CV
morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes that is associated with an increased risk of
death (3). Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated higher mortality rates in patients
with diabetes experiencing an MI, stroke, heart failure, and end-stage kidney disease
(4–6) aswell as inpatients with type2 diabetes, chronic kidneydisease,and/orvascular
diseases (7). The relative effect of nonfatal CV events on survival in patients with type 2
diabetes and acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) is not well studied.

CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC RISK
 The primary results of the Examina-
tion of Cardiovascular Outcomes with
Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EX-
AMINE) trial showed that the dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor alogliptin
was comparable to placebo on risk of
death and major nonfatal CV events
(MI, stroke, and hospitalized heart fail-
ure [HHF]) in patients with type 2 diabe-
tes at very high CV riskdthose with
recent ACS (8,9). Fatal outcomes in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes and a first
nonfatal MI, hospitalization for unstable
angina (UA) or HHF, or stroke were com-
pared with those of patients who did not
have a major nonfatal CV event in the
EXAMINE trial (9).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients
The details, design, and primary results
of EXAMINE have been published pre-
viously (8,9). Briefly, patients were
eligible for enrollment if they had a di-
agnosis of type 2 diabetes, were receiv-
ing antihyperglycemic therapy (with
the exception of a DPP-4 inhibitor or
glucagon-like peptide 1 analog), and
had a history of ACS within 15 to 90 days
before randomization. Further criteria
for type 2 diabetes included a glycated
hemoglobin value between 6.5% (48
mmol/mol) and 11.0% (97 mmol/mol),
inclusive, at screening, but if the antidi-
abetic regimen included insulin, the pa-
tient was required to have a glycated
hemoglobin value between 7.0% (53
mmol/mol) and 11.0% (97 mmol/mol).
ACSs were explicitly defined as diagno-
ses of acute MI or hospitalization with
UA, with objective evidence of myocar-
dial ischemia (8). Major exclusion criteria
included a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes,
unstable cardiac disorders, such as New
York Heart Association Functional Classi-
fication IV heart failure, refractory angina,
uncontrolled arrhythmias, critical valvular
heart disease, severe uncontrolled hy-
pertension, and dialysis within 14 days
of screening.
Patients were randomly assigned to
receive alogliptin or placebo, adminis-
tered in a double-blind fashion, in addi-
tion to standard-of-care treatment, for
type 2 diabetes. Throughout the study,
patients were required to receive stan-
dard of care for treatment of type 2 di-
abetes and CV risk factors according to
regional guidelines. Outpatient visits were
scheduled at screening and randomization
and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after ran-
domizationduringthefirstyearofthestudy
and every 4 months during subsequent
years of participation.
CV Adjudication
CV death was defined as death from car-
diac and cerebrovascular causes and any
death without another known cause. All
deaths not meeting these diagnoses
were considered non-CV in nature.
Deaths and the nonfatal CV events (MI,
UA, heart failure, and stroke) were ad-
judicated by an independent CV end
points committee blind to treatment as-
signment, according to prespecified cri-
teria. An MI was defined by ischemic
symptoms or new ischemic electrocar-
diographic changes accompanied by el-
evated cardiac biomarkers (troponin
and/or creatine kinase-MB). Hospitali-
zation for UA was defined by ischemic
symptoms with evidence of ischemic
electrocardiographic changes not accom-
panied by elevated cardiac biomarkers.
HHF was defined as presentation to a
hospital or acute heart failure center re-
quiring hospitalization due to an unex-
pected exacerbation of heart failure
that required treatment with parenteral
diuretics, inotropes, mechanical fluid re-
moval, or intraaortic balloon pump inser-
tion for maintenance of hemodynamic
compromise. A stroke was defined as a
focal neurologic deficit lasting 24 h or
longer, preferably with imaging confirma-
tion of infarction of the brain or an intra-
cranial hemorrhage not secondary to
trauma.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics of the EXAMINE
study population are presented accord-
ing to the first nonfatal CV event as
frequencies and percentages for cate-
gorical variables and as means with
standard deviation or medians with
interquartile range for continuous vari-
ables. These characteristics were com-
pared using the x2 test for categorical
variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum
test or t test for continuous variables
according to the distribution. Cox pro-
portional hazards models were used to
analyze the time to the occurrence of CV
deaths for all randomized patients. The
consistency of effects on CV mortality
was explored in a variety of subgroups
without adjustment for multiple com-
parisons. CV mortality was assessed
and tabulated after a major nonfatal
CV event (acute MI, HHF, and stroke)
in the entire cohort and by treatment
assignment. The adjusted association
between the incidence of the first non-
fatal event and the instantaneous risk
(hazard) of death was assessed with
the use of a time-dependent Cox pro-
portional hazards model. The incidence
of first stroke, MI, HHF, and UA were ex-
amined as a categorical time-dependent
variable; at baseline, all patients
were classified as not having any non-
fatal events. The hazard ratios (HRs)
were further adjusted by the baseline
covariates of age, treatment assign-
ment, sex, estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate (eGFR), duration of diabetes,
BMI, race, medical history of hyperten-
sion, MI, coronary revascularization,
heart failure, peripheral arterial disease,
index type of ACS, and time to postindex
ACS before randomization. Data were
stratified by baseline renal function
and geographic region. All statistical anal-
yses were assessed at a two-sided signif-
icance level of 5%, and all CIs are reported
as two-sided values with a confidence
level of 95%. We performed all analyses
for the intention-to-treat cohort. Analy-
ses were performed using SAS 9.4 soft-
ware (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
General Mortality Findings
This analysis by randomized treatment
included 2,701 patients in the alogliptin
group and 2,679 in the placebo group.
A total of 326 deaths occurred in the
EXAMINE trial. Death from any cause
occurred in 153 patients on alogliptin
(5.7%) and 173 patients on placebo
(6.5%) (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71, 1.09)
(Fig. 1A). For CV causes of death, rates
on alogliptin (112 [4.1%]) and placebo
(130 [4.9%]) (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.66,
1.10) were comparable (Fig. 1B). Sudden
cardiac death, the most prevalent adju-
dicated cause of CV death, occurred in
59 patients on alogliptin (2.2%) versus
73 patients on placebo (2.7%) (HR
0.80; 95% CI 0.57, 1.12) (Fig. 1C).
When explored by subgroups, results
for CV mortality showed heterogeneity
for some of the baseline factors (Fig. 2).
None of the interactions was associated
with an increase in mortality on alogliptin
versus placebo in any of the comparative
subgroups. CV death rates were lower in
women (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40, 0.91), pa-
tients with eGFR $60 mL/min/1.73 m2

 (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.46, 0.98), and
those with a history of type 2 diabetes
for less than 5 years (HR 0.61; 95% CI
0.37, 1.00) on alogliptin versus placebo.
Death rates for alogliptin and placebo
did not differ according to age, race,
BMI, type of ACS, or baseline glycated
hemoglobin level (Fig. 2).
CV Mortality Findings After Nonfatal
Major CV Events
The first nonfatal CV event was MI in
316 patients (5.9%), HHF in 159 (3.0%),

 nonfatal stroke in 57 (1.1%), and hospi-
talization for UA in 204 (3.8%) during a
median follow-up of 18.8 months. There
were 4,644 patients (86.3%) who did not
experience any of the major nonfatal CV
events, and of these, 233 (5.0%) died,
with 172 of these (74%) of CV causes.
The baseline characteristics of pa-
tients according to those without a non-
fatal CV event and those with a first type
of major nonfatal CV events are report-
ed in Table 1. Several characteristics
were different for patients with no non-
fatal event versus those with nonfatal
CV events, including age, duration of
diabetes, BMI, likelihood of having cor-
onary revascularization, rates of periph-
eral artery disease, and eGFR. Patients
with an HHF event were older, had a
longer duration of diabetes, were more
likely to have had coronary revasculari-
zation, had reduced eGFR, and were
more likely to have a history of conges-
tive heart failure compared with the
other groups.
Mortality rates after a first CV event
were higher in patients who had experi-
enced an HHF first, followed by stroke
and MI, compared with those who did
not experience any major CV event (Ta-
ble 2). By the end of follow-up, the rate
of death was highest in those who had
an admission for heart failure, followed
by those with a stroke and MI, versus
those who had none of these events
during follow-up. The rates of CV death
for those with hospitalization for UA
were comparable to those patients
who did not have a nonfatal event after
randomization (Fig. 3). Compared with
patients who did not experience a non-
fatal event, the adjusted HR for CV death
was 3.12 (95% CI 2.13, 4.58; P , 0.0001)
after MI, 4.96 (95% CI 3.29, 7.47; P ,
0.0001)afterHHF, 3.08(95% CI 1.29, 7.37;
P = 0.011) after stroke, and 1.66 (95% CI
0.81, 3.37; P = 0.164) after admission for
UA. Mortality rates in patients who did
not have a postrandomization nonfatal
CV event were comparable on alogliptin
and placebo (4.5% and 5.8%; adjusted HR
0.81; 95% CI 0.63, 1.05). Subsequent mor-
tality rates after HHF were 22.7% in pa-
tients randomized to alogliptin and 34.1%
in patients randomized to placebo (ad-
justed HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.51, 2.02).
CONCLUSIONS
The EXAMINE trial showed that the DPP-4
inhibitor alogliptin resulted in rates of
mortality that were similar to rates with
placebo among patients with type 2 di-
abetes and a high burden of CV disease
and risk. There were similar rates of sud-
den cardiac death onalogliptinversuspla-
cebo, the most commonly adjudicated
cause of death in the trial. Most of the
CV deaths in EXAMINE occurred in pa-
tients who did not have a postrandomiza-
tion, nonfatal CV event first. However, for
those patients with a HHF, the subse-
quent mortality due to CV causes was
more than fourfold higher than for pa-
tients who did not have a nonfatal CV
event. For those patients with an initial

 MI or stroke, subsequent rates of CV mor-
tality also were much higher than for pa-
tients without a CV event.
The rates of all-cause mortality, CV
mortality, and non-CV mortality, whether
after a nonfatal CV event or not, were
comparable in patients randomized to
alogliptin and placebo. The number of
deaths in patients randomized to alogliptin
was nominally lower than those ran-
domized to placebo, but in none of these
analyses were the findings statistically
significant. Because EXAMINE had a me-
dian duration of ;18 months, these mor-
tality findings do not rule out longer-term
benefits (or risks) of alogliptin in patients
with type 2 diabetes and high degrees of
CV risk. Other major trials of the DPP-4
inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes
and CV disease or elevated risk that are
of longer duration support the findings
ofouranalysisinEXAMINE. IntheSaxagliptin
Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Re-
corded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus-
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction
(SAVOR TIMI 53) trial (10), with ;2 years
of median follow-up, death from any
cause occurred in 4.9% of patients ran-
domized to saxagliptin versus 4.2% on
placebo (HR 1.11, P = 0.15), and this find-
ing was driven primarily by rates of death
from CV causes (3.2% on saxagliptin vs.
3.4% on placebo). Similarly, in the Trial
Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes
with Sitagliptin (TECOS) (11), with ;3
years of median duration, rates of all-
cause mortality occurred in 7.5% of pa-
tients randomized to sitagliptin versus
7.3% randomized to placebo (HR 1.01,
P = 0.875) with CV death rates of 5.2%
on sitagliptin versus 5.0% on placebo.
The noninferiority of alogliptin to pla-
cebo with respect to CV death was het-
erogeneous in three subgroups (P , 0.05
for the interaction). This included sex, the
duration of diabetes, and geographic re-
gion of study conduct. Given the number
of subgroup tests performed, these find-
ings may have been due to chance. The
number of events contributing to these
differences was fairly small, and the CIs
were wide, particularly for geographic re-
gion. Nevertheless, these results do raise
questions about whether differences ac-
cording to these subgroups influenced
the effects of the randomly assigned
drug on CV mortality.

 The severity of CV disease in EXAMINE
was high, most deaths occurred in those
patients who did not experience a non-
fatal CV event first, and most were due
to CV causes, as has been the case with
other studies (7,11–13). The rates of all-
cause and death from CV causes in
EXAMINE were higher than those ob-
served in SAVOR TIMI 53 (10) and TECOS
(11) and similar to those in the Evalua-
tion of LIXisenatide in Acute coronary
syndrome (ELIXA) trial (14). This is likely
explained by the requirement of a re-
cent ACS for inclusion into EXAMINE
and ELIXA, whereas the acuity of CV
disease was less in the other trials of
incretin-based therapies (9–11,14). MI
accounted for the highest proportion
of the nonfatal CV events in EXAMINE,
consistent with a cohort of patients with
recent ACS and type 2 diabetes. The
numbers of patients with heart failure
and UA hospitalizations were similar,
but stroke was relatively infrequent in
this trial. There were also few deaths
occurring after an initial stroke in the
trial. However, because CV diseases
will develop in approximately half of all
patients with type 2 diabetes during
their lifetime (15), our findings do apply
to a broader population with type 2
diabetes.
Although the development of heart
failure in EXAMINE was lower than that
of MI, the subsequent rate of death was
much greater in those with HHF than
other types of CV events. As previously
noted by us (16) and others in recent
studies of heart failure outcomes in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes (3,7,17), the
finding of a substantially higher mortal-
ity rate for patients progressing to HHF
demonstrate that heart failure should
be a standard CV outcome, along with
MI and stroke, in studies of patients with
type 2 diabetes. This observation has
not yet led into a concerted effort for
reducing the incidence of heart failure
in patients with type 2 diabetes; how-
ever, there is evidence from the recently
completed Empaglifozin Cardiovascular
Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes
Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME)
(18) in patients with type 2 diabetes and
the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention
Trial (SPRINT) (19) in patients without
type 2 diabetes that reductions in the pri-
mary end points were driven by reduc-
tions in HHF and death from CV causes.
In both trials, the prominent use of drugs
that reduce plasma volume appears to be
the most likely reason for success in the
studies at reducing heart failure– related
mortality.
Our study is limited by the lack of for-
mal assessment of type of MI (ST seg-
ment elevation vs. non-ST segment
elevation) and type of heart failure (re-
duced systolic function vs. preserved
systolic function) at baseline. However,
all CV events were formally adjudicated
by an independent end points commit-
tee blinded to treatment assignment. In
addition, our analysis is unique consid-
ering that patients randomized with
type 2 diabetes had an ACS just before
randomization, making the population
at high risk for future events in the trial.
Figure 3—Kaplan-Meier curves representing the increase in instantaneous risk (hazard) of CV death with the incidence of corresponding nonfatal CV
events vs. no incidence of a nonfatal CV event. Time of follow-up starts at randomization for the “no CV event” group (172 CV deaths) and at the
time of the corresponding first nonfatal CV event for nonfatal MI (26 CV deaths), stroke (5 CV deaths), HHF (32 CV deaths), and hospitalization for
UA (7 CV deaths).

Cardiovascular Mortality in the EXAMINE Trial
Diabetes Care Volume 39, July 2016
 In conclusion, mortality, including CV
mortality, in the EXAMINE trial was com-
parable for alogliptin versus placebo
over 18 months of follow-up. The occur-
rence of an additional nonfatal CV event
(i.e., postrandomization, after the index
ACS) during the trial was common and
increased the risk of death, particularly
after an admission to the hospital for
heart failure. Hence, the potential to re-
duce mortality through aggressive use
of evidence-based secondary preven-
tive therapies remains substantial and
should be considered a standard in the
clinical management of high CV risk pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes.
