ABSTRACT  
Histone lysine methylation, mediated by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins, is 
now known to be critical in the regulation of gene expression, genomic stability, cell 
cycle and nuclear architecture. Despite being postulated as essential for normal 
development, little is known about the specific functions of the different MLL lysine 
methyltransferases. Here we report heterozygous variants in the gene KMT2B (also 
known as MLL4) in 27 unrelated individuals with a complex progressive childhood-
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
onset dystonia, often associated with a typical facial appearance and characteristic 
brain magnetic resonance imaging findings. Over time, the majority of affected 
individuals developed prominent cervical, cranial and laryngeal dystonia. Marked 
clinical benefit, including the restoration of independent ambulation in some cases, 
was observed following deep brain stimulation (DBS). These findings highlight a 
clinically recognizable and potentially treatable form of genetic dystonia, 
demonstrating the crucial role of KMT2B in the physiological control of voluntary 
movement. 
 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The control of voluntary movement is governed by interactive neural networks 
within the brain involving the basal ganglia, sensorimotor cortex, cerebellum and 
thalamus1. Disruption of these pathways can lead to a variety of movement 
disorders. Dystonia is characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle 
contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements and postures affecting 
the limbs, trunk, neck and face. Dystonic movements are typically patterned, 
twisting, and may be tremulous, often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and 
associated with overflow muscle activation2. 
Dystonia is described in a broad spectrum of genetic and acquired disorders, either 
in isolation or combined with other neurological and systemic features1-5. Despite 
genetic advances, the underlying cause remains elusive for a significant proportion 
of individuals with childhood-onset dystonia, hindering future prognostication and 
treatment strategies6. We report 27 individuals with an early-onset, complex, 
combined progressive dystonia associated with mono-allelic variants in KMT2B 
(MLL4, NM_014727.2). KMT2B encodes a lysine histone methyltransferase, 
involved in H3K4 methylation, an important epigenetic modification associated with 
active gene transcription.

RESULTS 
Chromosomal microdeletions and intragenic KMT2B sequence variants in 
early-onset dystonia 
We identified 34 individuals with undiagnosed childhood-onset dystonia for 
molecular genetic investigation (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 1, 
Supplementary Fig. 1). On routine diagnostic testing, one case (Patient 1) was 
found to have a microdeletion at 19q13.12 of undetermined significance7. 
Diagnostic chromosomal microarray was performed in 23/34 individuals and 
overlapping microdeletions were detected in a further 5 cases (Supplementary 
Table 1, Patients 2-6). Using established external networks (Online Methods, 
Supplementary Fig. 1), 4 more cases (Patients 7-10) with microdeletions were 
identified. In total, 10 patients (Patients 1-10) had overlapping heterozygous 
interstitial microdeletions at 19q13.11-19q13.12 (Table 1, Fig. 1a). Microdeletions 
detected on diagnostic microarray were verified by established laboratory protocols 
and confirmed as de novo where parental testing was possible (Supplementary 
Table 2). The smallest region of overlap extended from 36,191,100-36,229,548bp 
(GRCh37/hg19), encompassing two HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee 
curated genes, ZBTB32 (zinc finger and BTB domain containing 32) and KMT2B 
(MLL4) (Fig. 1a).  
For the remaining 28 cases without a 19q microdeletion, we performed either whole 
exome (n=6) or genome sequencing (n=9) in 15 (Online Methods). Heterozygous 
sequence variants within KMT2B were identified in 6/15 cases (Patients 13, 14, 17, 
21, 22, 27). Sanger sequencing of KMT2B in the other 13 individuals identified one 
additional mutation-positive case (Patient 16). Through national and international 
collaborations (Online Methods, Supplementary Fig. 1), a further 10 cases 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
(Patients 11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26a) were subsequently ascertained. 
Overall, a total of 17 patients with intragenic heterozygous KMT2B variants were 
identified (Table 1, Fig.1b). These frameshift insertions (n=1), frameshift deletions 
(n=6), splice site (n=1), stop-gain (n=2) and missense (n=7) variants were 
confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 2, 3). Whole exome and 
genome analysis did not identify pathogenic variants in (i) ZBTB32, (ii) known 
dystonia genes and (iii) genes causing other neurodevelopmental disorders. Where 
possible, mutations in TOR1A (NM_000113.2), THAP1 (NM_018105.2) and GNAL 
(NM_182978.3) were excluded by diagnostic single gene testing, next generation 
multiple gene panels and research Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 4). 
Parental DNA was available for 23/27 cases, and familial segregation studies 
verified that interstitial deletions or intragenic variants had arisen de novo in 20 
patients (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2). Three patients had 
maternally inherited missense variants (Patient 22, 26a and 27). The KMT2B 
variant identified in Patient 26a had occurred de novo in his symptomatic mother 
(Patient 26b) (Supplementary Table 2).  
Phenotypic characterization of patients with KMT2B variants 
We identified 27 patients (current age 6-40 years, 14 female, 13 male) with KMT2B 
variants, who presented with clinical symptoms in childhood (Table 1, Table 2, 
Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Videos 1-7). Individuals presenting in 
early childhood (1-9 years, median age 4 years) had either limb or cranio-cervical 
symptoms. Clinical presentation for those with microdeletions, frameshift, splice-site 
and stop-gain mutations occurred significantly earlier (mean age 4.1 years) than for 
those with intragenic missense variants (mean age 6.4 years) (p-value 0.0223)

(Supplementary Fig. 3). Most patients (21/27) had lower limb symptoms at 
disease onset, leading to foot posturing, toe-walking and gait disturbance (Fig. 2a). 
4/27 patients presented initially with upper limb symptoms associated with 
abnormal postures (Fig. 2b,c) and dystonic tremor, leading to reduced dexterity 
and handwriting difficulties (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). With increasing age, 
cervical symptoms (torticollis, retrocollis) (Fig. 2d,e) and cranial involvement (facial 
dystonia, oromandibular involvement with dysarthria/anarthria and difficulties in 
chewing/swallowing) became prominent features in the majority of patients. In many 
patients, progressively severe dysphonia was suggestive of laryngeal involvement. 
None of the patients had airway compromise and videostroboscopy was not 
undertaken. Over time, most patients (24/27) developed progressive, generalized 
dystonia, 2-11 years after initial presentation (Fig. 2f). The dystonia was persistent 
in nature, absent in sleep, worsened by voluntary action and associated with 
overflow muscle activation. Some patients had dystonic tremor. Sudden, brief, 
involuntary muscle jerks, clinically consistent with myoclonus, were evident in 2 
cases (Patients 14 and 27). For a few subjects, dystonia was exacerbated when 
systemically unwell. Stepwise deterioration following intercurrent illness was 
particularly evident in Patient 14, and status dystonicus, triggered by a urinary tract 
infection, was reported in Patient 3. 
Many patients with KMT2B variants had additional clinical findings, including 
microcephaly, seizures, spasticity and eye movement abnormalities (strabismus, 
saccade initiation failure and oculomotor apraxia) (Table 2). Dysmorphic features 
and characteristic facial appearance (elongated face and bulbous nasal tip) (Fig. 
2g, Table 2) were commonly reported. Developmental delay, intellectual disability, 
systemic (dermatological, renal, respiratory) features and psychiatric symptoms 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
were also present in some individuals (Table 2, Supplementary Table 5, 
Supplementary Fig. 4c). Malignancies were not reported in any patients. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitter analysis, undertaken in 13 patients 
revealed no major derangement of monoamine metabolites (Supplementary Table 
6). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a characteristic signature in 17/22 
patients who had imaging sequences suitable for assessment (Supplementary 
Table 7). Subtle, symmetrical hypointensity of the globus pallidi (with a hypointense 
streak of bilateral globus pallidus externa) was evident on MR images known to 
demonstrate the magnetic resonance phenomenon of susceptibility (T2, T2*-, 
susceptibility- and echo-planar imaging b0-diffusion-imaging datasets) (Fig. 3). 
Mean age at neuroimaging was significantly lower for patients with MR 
abnormalities (11.7 years) than for those with normal brain scans (19.0 years) (p-
value 0.0167) (Supplementary Fig. 5a-c). Single positron emission tomography 
using 123I (DaTSCANTM) and 18F-FDG-PET-CT glucose uptake studies, each 
undertaken in 3 patients, were normal (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary 
Fig. 5d). 
Deep brain stimulation: clinical benefit in KMT2B-dystonia 
Overall, medical therapies were not clinically beneficial. None of the patients had a 
sustained response to levodopa treatment, nor other commonly used anti-dystonic 
agents (Table 1). Ten patients had symptomatic treatment with bilateral globus 
pallidus interna-deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) (Table 1). All showed clinical 
benefit, which was particularly striking in some of the younger patients. Patient 6 
showed significant reduction of torticollis and retrocollis, with improvements in 
motor function and gait. Patient 8 showed a sustained clinical response 6 years 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
after DBS insertion, with improvement of dystonia, even more evident after 
replacement of a faulty right DBS lead. Patient 9 had generalized dystonia and 
could not walk independently prior to DBS. Two weeks after DBS insertion, he 
dramatically regained independent ambulation with marked improvement of 
dystonic symptoms (Supplementary Video 8). Patient 17 and 21 were 
predominantly wheelchair-dependent prior to DBS insertion, but both patients 
showed restoration of independent walking and improvement of dystonia after DBS 
(Supplementary Video 9, 10). Patient 19 had amelioration of oromandibular 
symptoms with DBS. Patient 20 had DBS inserted at age 32 years and although 
most benefits were only transient, sustained improvement of foot posture was 
reported. Patient 23 had significant reduction of dystonic symptoms after DBS 
insertion. Patient 22, 9 months after DBS insertion (Supplementary Video 11) and 
Patient 25, 4 months after DBS insertion, have both shown significant gains in hand 
function and independent walking with improvement of dystonia. Five patients are 
now over three years post-DBS insertion, and all report a sustained reduction in 
dystonia, with restoration of function and prevention of progressive disability. 
KMT2B is constrained for missense and predicted protein truncating variants 
Patient 13, 14, 17 and 21 had whole genome sequencing as part of the NIHR-
funded BioResource-Rare Disease project. Enrichment analysis was undertaken in 
this cohort to determine whether predicted protein truncating variants (PPTVs) in 
KMT2B were observed more frequently in patients than would be expected by 
chance. Given the size and sequence context of KMT2B, 5.73x10-03 de novo 
KMT2B PPTVs would be expected to occur by chance in the subset of the NIHR 
BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort with pediatric onset neurological disease, but 3 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
PPTVs were observed. This represents a significant enrichment (p-value 3.12x10-
08). Furthermore in ExAC, KMT2B is highly constrained for PPTVs (accessed July 
2016)8 providing supportive evidence of its potential involvement in disease. 712 
KMT2B missense variants are reported in the ExAC database. Most of these are 
rare, as expected for a cohort of this size, and the median CADD score9 for these 
variants is 22.9. The median CADD score for missense variants identified in our 
KMT2B-dystonia cohort is significantly higher at 29.1 (p-value 0.0001364; 
Supplementary Table 3). Given the size and sequence context of KMT2B, 956 
missense variants are predicted to occur by chance, suggesting that KMT2B may 
also be constrained for missense variation (z=4.06)8. 
KMT2B variants are predicted to destabilize protein structure 
In silico homology modelling studies were undertaken to generate hypotheses 
regarding the predicted effects of sequence variants on KMT2B (NP_055542.1) 
structure-function properties (Supplementary Notes). Based on Pfam domain 
assignments, KMT2B has a CXXC zinc finger domain, multiple PHD domains, an 
F/Y rich N-terminus (FYRN), FYRC (F/Y rich C-terminus) domain and a C-terminal 
SET domain (Fig. 4a). The modelled variants occurred in residues within the PHD-
like, FYRN, SET and FYRC-SET linking domains (Fig. 4b-d). Evaluation of a 
number of variants using MAESTRO10 and DUET11 suggests a change in the free 
energy, with a predicted structure destabilizing effect (Supplementary Notes). 
p.Phe1662Leu and p.Gly1652Asp occur within a PHD-like domain (residues 1574-
1688), predicted to facilitate interaction with DNA, protein-protein interaction and 
recognition of 
methylated/unmethylated lysines12-14. 
Extensive 
hydrophobic 
interactions hold the globular structure of this region, which is important for its 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
function12. Phe1662 is fully buried at the core, stabilizing the structure of this PHD-
like domain while Gly1652 is partially buried (Fig. 4b,e,f). Phe1662 is involved in 
multiple hydrophobic contacts at the core of the PHD domain, and exchange for 
leucine is predicted to cause loss of contacts at the core (Fig. 4g). Gly1652 is 
located on a loop (Fig. 4e) and substitution to aspartic acid is predicted to alter 
surface charge, with possible effects on the interaction network in the vicinity, 
involving a positively charged Arg1635 which is part of the helix α3 implicated in 
DNA binding12. Arg1762 and Leu1781 occur in a FYRN domain. FYRN and FYRC 
regions, particularly common in MLL histone methyltransferases, interact to form a 
compact structural unit (Fig. 4c,h) important in maintaining the active structure15,16. 
Arg1762 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carboxyls of Arg2463 and 
Leu2464 of FYRC domain. Substitution of Arg1762 by cysteine is predicted to 
abolish these contacts and hence contribute to destabilization of FYRC-FYRN 
association. Leu1781, at the interface between FYRN and FYRC (Fig. 4h,i) is 
surface exposed and involved in backbone hydrogen bonds stabilizing the beta 
sheet formed together by the two domains. Substitution to proline (p.Leu1781Pro) is 
predicted to disrupt the backbone hydrogen bond at this position, because it lacks 
one hydrogen bond donor and its backbone torsion angles are not compatible with 
that of a beta sheet. This predicts a destabilizing effect on sheet structure, 
potentially affecting the normal association of FYRN and FYRC domains. Arg2517 
resides in the region linking FYRC and SET domains, known to bind WDR5, an 
effector required for trimethylation of histone H317, presenting methylated histone 
H3 substrates to the MLL complex for further methylation18. Arg2517 is thought to 
be involved in a salt-bridge interaction with Asp172 of WDR5 (NP_438172.1) (Fig. 
4j) and Arg2517Trp is predicted to lead to loss of this interaction. Ile2674, Tyr2688 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
and Ile2694 all occur in the catalytic methyltransferase SET domain common to 
histone lysine methyltransferases. Ile2674 is buried in the hydrophobic core, 
adjacent to the catalytic site (Fig. 4d,k). Substitution to threonine is predicted to 
lead to loss of contacts at the core of the domain (due to the shorter side chain) and 
also introduces a buried polar group (Fig. 4l). p.Tyr2688Thr occurs at the core of 
SET domain involving extensive hydrophobic interactions and a hydrogen bond 
interaction with Ser2661 (Fig. 4m). The frameshift mutation p.Tyr2688Thrfs*50, 
with insertion of 50 additional residues, is predicted to destabilise the core and 
affect contacts due to the substitution with a shorter non-aromatic side-chain. 
Ile2694 is involved in the extensive hydrophobic contacts stabilizing the core of this 
domain. In silico analysis predicts that the frameshift mutation p.Ile2694Serfs*44 
will disrupt the domain fold and affect methyltransferase activity. 
KMT2B is ubiquitously expressed with reduced expression in KMT2B-
dystonia 
We confirmed widespread KMT2B expression in a variety of control fetal and adult 
human tissues (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 6). Moreover, KMT2B is ubiquitously 
expressed in the brain with higher expression in the cerebellum than in any other 
region (Fig. 5b). We ascertained fibroblasts from all patients consented for 
research testing (Patients 2, 13, 14, 16, all with microdeletions or PPTVs in KMT2B) 
and detected a statistically significant decrease in fibroblast KMT2B expression on 
quantitative RT-PCR when compared to control fibroblasts (Fig. 5c).  
Histone H3K4 methylation is not globally reduced in KMT2B-dystonia  
To determine the effect of KMT2B variants on methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 
(H3K4 methylation), we assayed tri-methylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) and di-
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
methylated H3K4 (H3K4me2). Immunoblotting of histones extracted from fibroblasts 
of Patients 14 and 16 showed no significant reduction in H3K4me3 or H3K4me2 
relative to control samples (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 7a). A Dictyostelium 
discoideum model was used to test the effect of SET domain variant p.Ile2647Thr 
on in vivo histone methyltransferase activity. The SET domain of KMT2B shares 
56% sequence identity with the Dictyostelium orthologue DdSet1, and Ile2647 is 
conserved (corresponding residue in Dictyostelium is Ile1447, XP_636258.1) 
(Supplementary Fig. 8f). DdSet1 is the only H3K4 methyltransferase in 
Dictyostelium and targeted knockout of DdSet1 (set1-) results in loss of all 
methylation at H3K419. We constitutively expressed wild-type DdSet1 (WT-DdSet1) 
and mutant-DdSet1 (m-DdSet1), both with N-terminal GFP fusions, in set1- 
Dictyostelium cells and compared the resulting levels of H3K4 methylation. 
Expression of either GFP-WT-DdSet1 or GFP-mDdSet1 in set1- cells resulted in 
rescue of H3K4 tri-methylation to wild type levels (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 
7b,c). 
Altered gene and protein expression in KMT2B-dystonia 
In order to determine whether KMT2B-dystonia is associated with dysregulation of 
specific genes and proteins, we investigated (i) gene and protein expression 
profiles for THAP1 and Torsin-1A in cultured patient fibroblasts from Patients 2, 13, 
14 and 16 and (ii) tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) protein 
levels in cerebrospinal fluid from Patients 2 and 16 (Supplementary Notes, 
Supplementary Fig. 9, Supplementary Fig. 10). We found significantly reduced 
transcript levels of THAP1 and TOR1A when compared to control fibroblasts 
(Supplementary Fig. 11a). Fibroblast immunoblotting studies showed a statistically 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
significant reduction in THAP1 protein expression in all 4 patients when compared 
to control samples (Supplementary Fig. 11b). A statistically significant reduction in 
Torsin-1A was evident in Patient 14, though not in other patients (Supplementary 
Fig. 11c). CSF immunoblotting revealed significantly reduced levels of dopamine 2 
receptor (D2R) and increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels (Supplementary 
Fig. 11d). 
 
DISCUSSION 
We report 27 individuals with heterozygous variants in the lysine methyltransferase 
gene, KMT2B, and define a new genetic movement disorder that, importantly, is 
amenable to treatment with DBS. Using the current classification system2, KMT2B-
dystonia is defined as an inherited autosomal dominant, complex, combined 
dystonia usually of infantile or childhood-onset. In most patients, the dystonia is 
persistent and progressive in nature. Most individuals develop 4-limb dystonia with 
particularly prominent cervical, laryngeal and oromandibular symptoms. Whilst the 
majority of patients seem to follow this disease trajectory, we also report one young 
case (Patient 10, age 7 years) with developmental delay and intermittent toe-
walking only. Furthermore, we describe atypical cases with mainly oromandibular 
features (Patient 18) or paroxysmal cervical dystonia (Patient 26a) and relatively 
little upper or lower limb involvement. 
For many patients, KMT2B-dystonia is associated with a number of additional 
clinical features including other neurological symptoms, intellectual disability, 
psychiatric co-morbidity, dysmorphia, skin lesions and other systemic signs. Given 
the association with active gene expression, it is conceivable that KMT2B variants 
could account for these additional disease features. For Patients 1-10, other genes 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
within the 19q microdeletion may also contribute to aspects of their clinical 
phenotype20. KMT2B variants therefore cause a complex dystonia, and affected 
patients should have close surveillance of development during childhood, regular 
neurology assessments, routine dermatological review and formal neuropsychiatric 
testing. 
In KMT2B-dystonia, the majority of patients had a characteristic pattern on MR 
imaging, with subtle, low pallidal signal on T2*-, diffusion- and susceptibility-
weighted sequences, particularly affecting the lateral aspect of the globus pallidus 
externa (Fig. 3). Genotype did not appear to influence MR findings. However, those 
with abnormal imaging had scans undertaken at a significantly younger age than 
those with normal imaging. MR abnormalities may possibly be an age-dependent 
phenomenon, perhaps becoming less apparent with increasing age, as evident in 
serial imaging from Patient 22 (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Fig. 
5b,c). The overall significance of these neuroradiological abnormalities remains 
unclear. Such findings are reminiscent of, but subtly different to, those reported in 
Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) syndromes21,22. Similar 
non-specific features of T2*-weighted hypointensity are increasingly recognized in 
other neurological conditions, including Huntington’s disease, TUBB4A-related 
disorders, GM1 gangliosidosis, alpha-fucosidosis and mitochondriocytopathies. 
KMT2B variants were identified in 13/34 (38%) individuals with a relatively 
homogenous phenotype of early onset progressive dystonia. For externally 
screened cohorts, detection rates varied from 1.3-30% according to the phenotypic 
focus of the cohort (Supplementary Fig. 1). For cases where KMT2B mutations 
were not detected, it is likely that another etiology accounts for their symptoms. 
However, it is possible that KMT2B mutations may have been missed as (i) 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
single/multiple exon KMT2B deletions and duplications may not be detected on 
microarray, Sanger sequencing and whole exome/genome sequencing and (ii) 
promoter mutations and intronic KMT2B variants may not have been identified by 
whole exome and Sanger sequencing. 
The majority of individuals with KMT2B variants (Patients 1-20) had either 
heterozygous interstitial microdeletions leading to KMT2B haploinsufficiency or 
variants predicted to cause protein truncation, protein elongation, splicing defects or 
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The remaining 7 patients (Patients 21-27) had 
non-synonymous variants of KMT2B. Although a degree of caution must be 
exercised for missense variants, those identified in our cohort are (i) described in 
patients with a compatible phenotype, (ii) predicted to affect conserved residues 
within key protein domains for 5/7 cases (Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary 
Fig. 12) and (iii) predicted by in silico tools to be deleterious with a destabilizing 
effect on protein structure (Supplementary Table 3). Initial disease presentation 
was significantly earlier in those with missense variants (Supplementary Fig. 3) 
though genotype did not seem to influence subsequent rate of symptom evolution, 
disease severity or DBS response. 
For the majority of patients, KMT2B variants were confirmed as de novo where 
parental testing could be undertaken. In our cohort, 3 patients had missense 
changes that were maternally inherited (Patient 22, 26a, 27). The possibility of 
imprinting at the disease locus was considered, but deemed unlikely, given that (i) 
de novo microdeletions in Patients 2 and 10 occurred on paternally inherited alleles 
and (ii) there is bi-allelic expression of KMT2B single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
human tissues, including brain (Supplementary Fig. 13). Importantly, whole exome 
sequence analysis undertaken in Patients 22, 26a and 27 did not identify other rare 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
or de novo variants to account for disease. Interestingly, Patient 26a inherited 
p.Arg2517Trp from his symptomatic mother (26b) in whom the change occurred de 
novo (Supplementary Fig. 2). She was more mildly affected, with onset of 
symptoms in early adulthood, reporting gait abnormalities, progressive inability to 
run and periodic paroxysmal upper limb and neck dystonia. Both had similar facial 
appearances to others in the cohort (Fig. 2g). In contrast, the mothers of Patients 
22 and 27 were clinically examined and neither had evidence of a motor phenotype, 
intellectual disability, other neurological features, neuropsychiatric symptoms, facial 
dysmorphia, skin lesions or other systemic signs. The identification of both 
symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers suggests either ‘apparent’ incomplete 
penetrance, due to parental mosaicism, or true incomplete disease penetrance, a 
phenomenon 
commonly 
reported 
in 
other 
autosomal 
dominant 
genetic 
dystonias23,24. Other genetic, epigenetic and environmental modifiers may also 
influence disease penetrance and phenotypic presentation in KMT2B-dystonia. 
KMT2B encodes a ubiquitously expressed lysine methyltransferase specifically 
involved in H3K4 methylation25,26, an important epigenetic modification associated 
with active transcription. H3K4me3 is enriched at promoters, marking transcription 
start sites of actively transcribed genes, whereas H3K4me1 is associated with 
active enhancer sequences27. H3K4me2 is less specifically localized, but may be 
enriched at transcription factor binding sites28. Members of the SET/MLL protein 
family, including KMT2B, are responsible for the generation of H3K4me1, 
H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 which are essential for gene activation in normal 
development29. Using patient-derived fibroblasts and a Dictyostelium discoideum 
model, we demonstrated that KMT2B variants are not associated with widespread 
alterations in overall levels of H3K4 methylation. This is not surprising, given that 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
haploinsufficiency of other MLL family members have not been convincingly shown 
to affect global H3K4 levels. The fundamental physiological role of MLL proteins is 
affirmed by the observation that loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in MLL-
encoding genes are reported in a number of human developmental disorders30, 
namely Wiedemann Steiner (KMT2A, MLL1)31, Kleefstra-like (KMT2C, MLL3)32 and 
Kabuki (KMT2D, MLL2)33 syndromes, and most recently SETD1A-related disease 
(KMT2F)34. Although physiological functions of MLL proteins are yet to be fully 
characterized, the observation that mutations in different MLL genes cause 
phenotypically distinct syndromes (Supplementary Table 8) suggests that each 
MLL protein has a unique role, regulating the expression of a specific set of 
genes35,36. 
Amongst the previously reported MLL-gene disorders, dystonia appears fairly 
specific to KMT2B-related disease and is not commonly described in other MLL 
syndromes (Supplementary Table 8), providing further evidence that different MLL 
proteins mediate the activation and transcription of a specific set of genes, with 
temporal and cellular context37. In order to determine downstream effects of KMT2B 
mutations, we investigated expression profiles of specific genes and proteins 
implicated in the pathogenesis of dystonia using patient-derived fibroblasts and 
CSF (Supplementary Notes; Supplementary Fig. 9-11). We detected a 
statistically significant reduction of THAP1 and TOR1A gene expression and 
decreased THAP1 protein expression in fibroblasts. CSF immunoblotting studies 
revealed reduction of D2R protein and increase in TH levels in two patients with 
KMT2B-dystonia when compared to control CSF samples. The mechanisms 
causing such alterations in KMT2B-dystonia remain yet to be elucidated. Whilst 
H3K4 methylation is clearly associated with the process of active transcription, 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
several studies have shown that H3K4 methylation is required, not for absolute 
transcriptional output, but rather for transcription stability or consistency38,39, so the 
effects of KMT2B haploinsufficiency could conceivably operate via an intermediary 
sensitive to stochastic fluctuations. It is highly likely that dysregulation of other 
genes and proteins are also involved in the disease pathophysiology of KMT2B-
dystonia. Further studies will determine whether expression profiles of other genes 
and proteins are affected in KMT2B-dystonia and contributory to the phenotype. 
In conclusion, we report KMT2B variants in 27 patients with a clinically recognizable 
form of dystonia. To date, the underlying genetic etiology is only resolved in a 
minority of childhood-onset cases of dystonia, which precludes confirmatory 
diagnosis, accurate disease prognostication and selection of appropriate treatment 
strategies. We have shown that many patients with KMT2B-dystonia have 
significant, sustained clinical improvement with DBS. Referral for DBS assessment 
should therefore be considered for this group. Identification of additional cases will 
allow further characterization of the full phenotypic disease spectrum. Our report 
highlights mutations in KMT2B as a new and important cause of complex early-
onset dystonia, emphasizing the crucial role of KMT2B in the control of voluntary 
movement.

Comparative Modelling of KMT2B Protein Structure 
(a) Schematic domain architecture of KMT2B. (b-d) Degree of amino conservation is 
displayed in the structural models for different domains. Red to blue indicates increasing 
conservation. (b) Model of PHD-like domain shows Gly1652 and Phe1662. (c) Model of 
FYRN domain presents position and conservation of Arg1762 and Leu1781. (d) Model of 
the SET methyltransferase domain indicates position and conservation of Ile2674, 
Tyr2688 and Ile2694. (e) Location of Gly1652 in the PHD-like domain model and the 
hydrogen bond network in the vicinity (α3 helix is indicated). (f) Hydrophobic packing 
involving Phe1662. (g) Change to leucine at 1662 is predicted to cause loss of contacts 
within the hydrophobic core. Residue side chains are presented as spheres highlighting 
van der Waals contacts. (h) Interactions involving Arg1762 from FYRN with Arg2463 and 
Leu2464 of FYRC. The hydrogen bond interactions and distances are highlighted. (i) 
Leu1781 shown at the interface of FYRN (orange)/FYRC (magenta) domains. The 
backbone hydrogen bonds stabilizing the sheet structure are highlighted. (j) Interactions

involving Arg2517 and WDR5 (beige). The salt bridge interaction between Arg2517 of 
KMT2B and Asp172 of WDR5 is highlighted. (k) Location and contacts involving Ile2674 in 
the hydrophobic core of the SET domain (SAH is indicated). (l) Substitution with threonine 
at 2674 is predicted to result in loss of contacts in the hydrophobic core. (m) Interactions 
involving Tyr2688 and Ile2694 in the core of the SET domain. The hydrogen bond 
between Tyr2688 and Ser2661 is highlighted. 
 
Figure 5: 
KMT2B Expression and Effects on Histone H3K4 Methylation 
(a) PCR analysis of human fetal and adult cDNA for expression of KMT2B (cropped gel 
image; for uncropped image see Supplementary Fig. 6). KMT2B is widely expressed in 
human tissues, including fibroblasts, brain tissue and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. (b) 
Box plots of KMT2B mRNA expression levels in 10 adult brain regions (source: 
BRAINEAC; http://www.braineac.org/). Expression levels are based on exon array 
experiments as previously described and plotted on a log2 scale (y axis)40. KMT2B is 
ubiquitously expressed across all 10 brain regions analyzed, with expression highest in the 
cerebellum. Putamen (PUTM), frontal cortex (FCTX), temporal cortex (TCTX), occipital 
cortex (OCTX). hippocampus (HIPP), substantia nigra (SNIG), medulla (specifically inferior 
olivary nucleus, MEDU), intralobular white matter (WHMT), thalamus (THAL), and 
cerebellar cortex (CRBL). “N” indicates the number of brain samples analyzed to generate 
the results for each brain region. Whiskers extend from the box to 1.53 the interquartile 
range. (c) Quantitative RT-PCR indicates that patients with KMT2B mutations (n = 4) have 
significantly decreased fibroblast mRNA levels of KMT2B when compared to controls (n = 
2) (Controls = 1.01±0.16SD; Patients = 0.57±0.12SD). n = 3 technical replicates were 
analyzed per sample. Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-test: *P = 0.0182 (t = 
3.856, df = 4). No significant difference in variances between the groups was detected by

F-test. (d) Histone methylation was assayed independently in three samples (n = 3; 
technical replicates) taken from each patient-derived fibroblast cell line (n = 2; Patient 14 
and 16) on different days, and compared with control cell lines (n = 2). Methylation values 
are normalized to pan-histone H3 levels. Individual data-points are plotted with center bar 
showing mean and error bars showing standard deviation. Differences between control 
and patient-derived samples are not significant (H3K4me3 (left): Controls = 
96.63±19.98SD; Patient 16 = 104.1±40.31SD; Patient 14 = 94.75±38.36SD; H3K4me2 
(right): Controls = 94.33±19.25SD; Patient 16 = 127.8±20.79SD; Patient 14 = 
80.23±31.09SD). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA: H3K4me3: P = 0.9196 (F = 
0.08462, DFn = 2, DFd = 9); H3K4me2: P = 0.0727 (F = 3.557, DFn = 2, DFd = 9). (e) 
Quantification of immunoblotting of tri-methyl H3K4 in Dictyostelium cell lysates. Tri-methyl 
H3K4 intensity values are normalized against levels of total histone H3. H3K4 tri-
methylation is impaired in set1- cells compared to wild type. Expression of GFP-DdSet1 or 
GFP-DdSet1(I1447T) in set1- cells rescues levels of H3K4Me3. Three independent point-
mutant cell lines (GFP-DdSet1(I1447T) 1-3) were created using the same point-mutant 
DNA construct. Individual data-points (three independently prepared samples taken from 
each cell line; n= 3, technical replicates) are plotted with center bar showing mean and 
error bars showing standard deviation (Wild type = 115±48.25SD; set1- = 5.94±9.37SD; 
set1- GFP-DdSet1(I1447T) 1 = 133.7±38.11SD; set1- GFP-DdSet1(I1447T) 2 = 
129.8±42.34SD; set1- GFP-DdSet1(I1447T) 3 = 96.07±31.82SD; set1- GFP-DdSet1 = 
110.5±12.02SD). No statistical testing was applied.

ONLINE METHODS 
(1) Case Ascertainment 
Case 
ascertainment 
is 
summarized 
in 
Supplementary 
Table 
1 
and 
Supplementary Fig. 1. At Great Ormond Street-Institute of Child Health (GOS-
ICH), we identified 34 patients referred to our center with undiagnosed dystonia 
(Supplementary Table 1). All patients (median age 13.5 years), presented with 
progressive dystonia, with disease onset in childhood. None had a clinical history or 
neuroimaging compatible with acquired dystonia, nor blood, urine or CSF biomarker 
evidence of an underlying neurometabolic disorder. We used established national 
and international clinical genetic and pediatric neurology networks to identify further 
patients with microdeletions similar to those detected in the GOS-ICH cohort 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We also collaborated with research groups undertaking 
whole exome sequencing in patients with early-onset dystonia (Supplementary 
Fig. 1).

Research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Additional 
consent for publication of photographs and videos was provided. 
Chromosomal Microarray 
Patients were analyzed for copy number variants using chromosomal microarray by 
standard diagnostic techniques (Supplementary Table 2). Data is presented as 
minimum coordinates in GRCh37/hg19. 
Whole Exome and Genome Sequencing (WES/WGS) 
WES/WGS was undertaken using center-specific protocols (see below). Reads 
were aligned to the reference genome GRCh37/hg19. Detailed variant analysis was 
performed for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion/deletions 
(indels) that (i) passed standard local quality filters, (ii) were predicted to alter 
protein sequence in conserved residues, (iii) were predicted deleterious by 
bioinformatics tools (including SIFT, PolyPhen-2, LRT, Mutation Taster, CADD), (iv) 
had an allele frequency <0.01 in 1000 Genomes41, NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing 
Project, UK10K42, Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database8 and internal 
control exomes/genomes. Data analysis was initially undertaken for known disease-
causing genes prior to analysis for autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance 
models. 
NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases (NIHRBR-RD) Study: WGS was undertaken 
using the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation kit (Illumina Inc., 
San Diego, CA, USA) on Illumina Hiseq 2500, generating minimum coverage of 
15X for ~95% of the genome, and average coverage of ~30X. Reads were aligned 
using Isaac aligner (version 01.14) (Illumina Inc, Great Chesterford, UK)43. SNVs 
and indels were identified using Isaac variant caller (version 2.0.17).  
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
Wellcome Trust UK10K Rare Diseases project: DNA samples were captured using 
Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment V5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, 
USA) pull-down array. WES was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. 
Reads were aligned using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool. SNVs and indels 
were identified with SAMtools44,45. Variants were identified for each sample using 
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) Unified Genotyper46 and annotated with vcf-
annotate47 and Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor v73 (VEP)48.  
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda: Exome sequencing was completed using 
the TruSeqV2 exome capture kit. Data was aligned and processed as previously 
decribed49-51.  
Institute of Human Genetics, Erlangen: Exome sequencing was performed on a 
HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) platform with 125 bp paired-end sequencing using 
SureSelect v.5 capturing reagents (Agilent).  
Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen: Exome sequencing was undertaken 
using Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit, with sequencing on SOLiD 
5500XL, producing an average sequence depth of 91X and average coverage of at 
least 20X for 89% of targets. For calling and annotation of variants, a custom in-
house diagnostic pipeline was deployed52. 
UCL-Institute of Neurology, London: Exome sequencing was performed using 
Illumina’s Nextera Rapid Capture. Indexed and pooled libraries were sequenced on 
Illumina’s HiSeq3000 (100bp, paired-end). Reads were aligned with Novoalign. 
Duplicate read removal, format conversion, and indexing were performed with 
Picard. GATK was used to recalibrate base quality scores, perform local 
realignments around possible indels, and to call (HaplotypeCaller) and filter (VQSR) 
variants46. Annotated variant files were generated using ANNOVAR53.  
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
Deciphering Developmental Disorders study: Exome sequencing of family triomes 
was performed using Agilent SureSelect Exome bait design (Agilent Human All-
Exon V3 Plus with custom ELID C0338371 and Agilent Human All-Exon V5 Plus 
with custom ELID C0338371) on a Illumina HiSeq at the Wellcome Trust Sanger 
Institute as previously described54,55. Data is currently available on 4,295 triomes 
which were interrogated via a DDD complementary research proposal (CAP#120). 
Sanger Sequencing for Variant Validation and Gene Screening 
Direct sequencing was undertaken to (i) screen the entire coding region of KMT2B 
for 13 cases from the GOS-ICH cohort (Supplementary Table 1), (ii) confirm 
variants identified on next generation sequencing and (iii) establish familial 
segregation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Additionally, cDNA from fibroblasts and 
patient derived dopaminergic neurons were sequenced for a common SNP in exon 
30 (rs231591). Primer pairs for all 37 coding exons and exon/intron boundaries of 
KMT2B (Ensembl ENSG00000272333, transcript ENST00000420124) were 
designed with Primer3 (Supplementary Table 9)56,57. PCR conditions can be 
provided on request. PCR products were cleaned up (MicroCLEAN, Web Scientific) 
and sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Applied 
Biosystems Inc.). Sequencing reactions were run on an ABI PRISM 3730 DNA 
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and analyzed using Chromas.  
Enrichment Analysis 
The number of de novo predicted protein truncating variants (PPTVs) in KMT2B 
expected to be seen by chance in a subset of the NIHR BioResource–Rare 
Diseases cohort with pediatric onset neurological disease (n=272), was calculated 
using published gene-specific mutation rates58 and scaled to account for frameshift, 
nonsense and essential splice site variants58. To assess significance, the expected 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
number of de novo PPTVs were compared to the observed number, assuming a 
Poisson distribution. 
(3) CSF Neurotransmitter Analysis 
CSF was collected by lumbar puncture and diagnostically analyzed for 
neurotransmitter monoamine metabolites in specialist laboratories (London, 
Barcelona, Sydney, Jerusalem) by high performance liquid chromatography59.60  
(4) Comparative Modelling 
In silico homology modeling was utilized to predict putative effects of KMT2B 
variants. The Pfam database61 was used to assign known domains to the full-length 
sequence of KMT2B. Evolutionary conservation of residues in the sequence was 
quantified using Consurf server62, based on alignment with a set of homologous 
sequences, which share 35%-95% sequence identity with KMT2B. HHpred63 was 
utilized to identify proteins or domains with known structure that have similar 
sequence and structural features to KMT2B. Selected templates had more than 
99% probability (based on HHpred alignment score) of being related structurally to 
specific domain segments of KMT2B. MODELLER64 was employed for different 
regions of KMT2B and HHpred alignments were used to dictate residue 
equivalences with the template. For each domain, 150 models were generated with 
MODELLER loop optimization protocol and the best model was selected based on 
the normalized DOPE score65. The effect of a point substitution on the stability of 
the domain structure was evaluated using DUET11 and MAESTRO10. Visualization 
and analysis of amino acid interactions and generation of mutant models were done 
with UCSF Chimera66.

(5) Histone Methylation Assays 
H3K4 Methylation  
Histones were extracted from fibroblasts using a modified version of a published 
protocol67. Cells were lysed by rotating at 4°C in hypotonic lysis buffer (10mM Tris-
Cl pH8.0, 1mM KCl, 1.5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, Roche complete protease inhibitors). 
Intact nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.2N HCl. 
Following overnight histone extraction by rotating at 4°C, nuclear debris was 
removed by centrifugation and soluble histones precipitated by dropwise addition of 
TCA to a final concentration of 33%. Following one hour precipitation on ice, 
histones were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with acetone before 
resuspension in Milli-Q water.  
Expression of p.Ile1447Thr Set1 Point Substitution in Dictyostelium 
Dictyostelium discoideum cells were grown as previously described68. They are not 
listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by ICLAC. 
Dictyostelium strains69 included wild type—AX2 (DBS0238015) and set1-KO—set1- 
(DBS0236928). DdSet1 has Dictybase gene ID DDB_G0289257 and Uniprot ID 
Q54HS3. p.Ile1447Thr was created by substituting ATT for ACT in a DdSet1 
genomic clone by PCR (Supplementary Table 10). The product containing this 
substitution was cloned as a ClaI/EcoRI fragment replacing the equivalent region of 
a wild type DdSet1 genomic clone. This region was subsequently subcloned as a 
ClaI/AccI fragment into a pDEXH70 based integrating plasmid containing GFP-
DdSet1 under control of the DdAct15 promoter and a G418 selection marker – 
replacing the same region of the wild type DdSet1 cDNA sequence. The presence 
of p.Ile1447Thr in the resulting plasmid, pJN106, was confirmed by Sanger 
sequencing. Constructs for expression of GFP-DdSet1(p.Ile1447Thr) (pJN106) and 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
wild type GFP-DdSet1 (pJRC18) were transformed into set1- Dictyostelium cells71 
as previously described68. Transformants were selected by addition of 10ug/ml 
Geneticin (Gibco) to growth medium. Expression of full-length wild type and point 
mutant GFP-DdSet1 was confirmed by anti-GFP immunoblotting. 
Immunoblot Analysis of Histone Methylation 
Fibroblast histone samples were diluted in SDS sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 
5% [v/v] β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors (Roche Complete), separated 
by SDS-PAGE, then blotted onto nitrocellulose. Histone H3 and methylated K4 
variants were detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3 (Abcam ab1791, 
1:1000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3 tri-methyl K4 (Abcam ab8580, 
1:1000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3 di-methyl K4 (Millipore 07-030, 
1:2000 dilution). Secondary antibody used was donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRP-
conjugated (GE Healthcare NA934V; for Histone H3 and tri-methyl K4 detection 
1:30000 dilution, for di-methyl K4 detection 1:20000 dilution). Following detection 
using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo) and CL-
Xposure film (Thermo), densitometry was performed using ImageJ72. 
Dictyostelium cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in KK2 
buffer68 before lysis in SDS sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% [v/v] β-
mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors (Roche Complete). Immunoblotting for 
GFP-DdSet1 expression was assayed as above, using a mouse IgG monoclonal 
anti-GFP primary (Roche 11814460001, 1:500 dilution) and anti-mouse IgG HRP-
conjugated 
secondary 
antibody 
(BioRad 
170-6516, 
1:20000 
dilution). 
Immunoblotting for Histone H3 and tri-methyl H3K4 was conducted as for 
fibroblasts (with the modification: anti-histone H3 tri-methyl K4 dilution 1:3000).

(6) RNA and Protein Measurements  
Fibroblast RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis 
Skin biopsies from Patients 2, 13, 14 and 16 were taken for fibroblast culture, and 
grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Sigma) with 4.5g/L glucose, 
4mM L-glutamine, and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) 
and maintained in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Fibroblasts from two age-
matched controls were supplied by the Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre Biobank 
(GOS-ICH). Cultures were checked for mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert 
Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Lonza). As fibroblast cultures were derived from human 
skin biopsies, no authentication was undertaken. Furthermore these cell lines do 
not belong to the commonly misidentified cell lines listed in the database 
maintained by ICLAC. RNA was extracted from fibroblasts of T75 cell culture flasks 
using the RNeasy Mini Kit from QIAGEN. First-Strand cDNA synthesis was carried 
out with SuperScript® III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 500ng total RNA 
per reaction and Oligo (dT) primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  
Generation of Dopaminergic Neurons, RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis 
Fibroblasts from a KMT2B-negative individual were reprogrammed into induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using an established Sendai virus protocol 
(CytoTune®-iPS Reprogramming Kit, Invitrogen)73. iPSC lines were stringently 
tested for pluripotency using established methods74 before differentiation into 
dopaminergic neurons75. After 60 days of differentiation, dopaminergic identity was 
confirmed by immunofluorescence for neuronal marker, MAP2, (mouse monoclonal 
anti-MAP2, Sigma, M9942, 1:400 dilution) and dopaminergic marker, TH (chicken 
polyclonal anti-TH, Aves labs, TYH, 1;400 dilution). Nuclei were contrasted with 
DAPI. Microscopic images were captured (Zeiss LSM710 Confocal) and analyzed 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
using ImageJ72. Neuronal differentiation efficiency was determined by calculating 
the number of MAP2/TH positive cells relative to MAP2-positive cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 14). RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis was carried out as 
described for fibroblasts. 
PCR Analysis 
We investigated tissue expression of KMT2B in (i) human fetal cDNA samples 
(Moore fetal tissue cohort)76, (ii) a human cDNA panel (Clontech), (iii) human 
fibroblasts and (iv) dopaminergic neurons differentiated from human iPSC. PCR 
amplification of cDNA (Supplementary Table 11) was performed with BioMix™ 
Red (Bioline Ltd, conditions available on request). PCR products were separated on 
a 2% agarose gel containing Ethidium bromide (Sigma) and visualized with Gel 
Doc™ XR+ System (Bio Rad). 
Changes in relative expression of KMT2B, THAP1 and TOR1A, were measured by 
quantitative RT-PCR on a StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied 
Biosystems). RT-PCR reactions comprised 1x MESA Blue qPCR MasterMix Plus 
for SYBR® Assay (Eurogentec), 0.1µl ROX Reference Dye (Invitrogen), 9μL cDNA 
(of a dilution 1:25) and 500nM of each primer (Supplementary Table 11). RT-PCR 
conditions are available on request. Relative quantification of gene expression was 
determined 
using 
the 
2−∆∆Ct 
method77, 
with 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a reference gene. 
Fibroblast Protein Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis 
Fibroblasts grown in T25 cell culture flasks were washed with cold PBS and 
incubated with lysis buffer [150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris pH8, 1% NP40 and 1x 
cOmplete™ Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)] for 30 minutes on ice. Lysed 
cells were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes to remove cell debris. Protein 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
concentrations of the cell lysates were measured with the Pierce™ BCA Protein 
Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 5-10ng protein were prepared with 
1x Laemmli buffer and 0.5M DTT and boiled for 5 minutes at 100°C for denaturing. 
Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX 
Stain-Free™ Protein Gels (Bio Rad) by applying 300V for ~17 minutes. Proteins 
were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio Rad) using 
the Trans-Blot® Turbo™ Transfer System (Bio Rad). Membranes were incubated 
for 1 hour at room temperature in blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk in 
Phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20, PBS-T) and then probed with polyclonal 
rabbit anti-THAP1 (Cambridge Bioscience [Supplier: Proteintech], 12584-1-AP, 
1:1500 dilution) and monoclonal mouse anti-TorsinA (Cell Signaling, D-M2A8, 
1:1000 dilution), respectively, in blocking buffer (1% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T; 
except THAP1 antibody which was diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T) for 
approximately 16 hours at 4°C. Following three washing steps with PBS-T, 
membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling, #7074, 
1:3000 dilution) and HRP-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cell 
Signaling, #7076, 1:3000 dilution), respectively. Afterwards the blot was washed 
three times with PBS-T and signals were visualized with ClarityTM ECL Western 
Blotting Substrate (Bio Rad) on a Gel Doc™ XR+ System (Bio Rad). To confirm 
equivalent loading, blots were stripped at 37°C for 15 minutes in RestoreTM Western 
blot Stripping buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), blocked for 1 hour, and reprobed 
with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-β-Tubulin (Cell Signaling, 9F3, 1:1000 dilution). For 
quantification, intensity values of control and patient bands were determined using 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
Fiji software78 and normalized against the intensity value of the reference protein 
band. 
CSF Immunoblotting 
CSF protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine receptor D2 (D2R) 
were analyzed. CSF samples were available from two patients (Patients 2 and 16) 
and four gender and age-matched controls (patients with no history of movement 
disorder, on no medication). Immunoblotting was carried out as described above. 
For the detection of TH and D2R the membranes were incubated with polyclonal 
rabbit anti-TH (Millipore, AB152, 1:1000 dilution) and polyclonal rabbit anti-D2R 
(Millipore, AB5084P, 1:1000 dilution), respectively, followed by 2 hours incubation 
with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling, #7074, 1:3000 
dilution). As an internal control for loading monoclonal mouse anti-Transferrin 
(Santa Cruz, E-8, 1:1000 dilution) followed by HRP-conjugated horse anti-mouse 
IgG antibody (Cell Signaling, #7076, 1:3000 dilution) were used. 
(7) Statistics 
The statistical analyses for the histone methylation assays were conducted using 
GraphPad Prism v7.01 and for the analyses of the fibroblast cell lines and CSF 
immunoblotting using GraphPad v5. The final data are represented with the mean 
and the standard deviation as error bars. For multiple comparisons one-way 
ANOVA was performed whereas for dual comparisons unpaired two-tailed 
Student’s t test were employed. P < 0.05 was considered significant: *P < 0.05, **P 
< 0.01, ***P < 0.001. The F test was utilized to compare the variances between the 
groups in dual comparisons. 
We assume that technical replicates of immunoblot assays using the same cell 
lines will be normally distributed. For the fibroblast histone methylation assay the 
 KMT2B Dystonia 
Meyer et al 2016 
 
 
Brown-Forsythe test was used to check differences in variance between the groups 
compared, and no significant differences was found in standard deviation 
(H3K4Me3: p = 0.7567 [F = 0.2877, DFn = 2, DFd = 9]; H3K4me2: p=0.8446 [F = 
0.1721, DFn = 2, DFd = 9]). For the remaining experiments data distribution was 
not tested but was assumed to be normal. Blinding was not applied for data 
collection and analysis.
