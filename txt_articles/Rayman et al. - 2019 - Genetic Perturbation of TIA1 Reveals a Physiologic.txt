In Brief
Rayman et al. show that TIA1 regulates
avoidance behavior and fear memory in a
partly sex-dependent manner in mice and
controls a vast network of immune
system genes with overlapping roles in
synaptic plasticity and behavior. These
findings may be relevant to fear-related
psychopathologies, such as PTSD and
anxiety.

SUMMARY
TIA1 is a prion-related RNA-binding protein whose
capacity to form various types of intracellular aggre-
gates has been implicated in neurodegenerative
disease. However, its role in normal brain function
is poorly understood. Here, we show that TIA1 bidi-
rectionally modulates stress-dependent synaptic
plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain region involved
in fear memory and olfactory discrimination learning.
At the behavioral level, conditioned odor avoidance
is potentiated by TIA1 deletion, whereas overexpres-
sion of TIA1 in the ventral hippocampus inhibits both
contextual fear memory and avoidance. However,
the latter genetic manipulations have little impact
on other hippocampus-dependent tasks. Transcrip-
tional profiling indicates that TIA1 presides over a
large network of immune system genes with modula-
tory roles in synaptic plasticity and long-term mem-
ory. Our results uncover a physiological and partly
sex-dependent function for TIA1 in fear memory
and may provide molecular insight into stress-
related psychiatric conditions, such as post-trau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety.
INTRODUCTION
TIA1 is a prion-related RNA-binding protein that is a key compo-
nent of stress granules, non-membranous foci that assemble in
the cytoplasm in response to oxidative stress, viral infection,
and other environmental challenges (Kedersha et al., 2013).
These dynamic structures serve as temporary storage depots
for non-essential mRNAs, thus allowing stress-related tran-
scripts to have priority access to the translational machinery
(Anderson and Kedersha, 2008; Buchan and Parker, 2009;
Kedersha et al., 2013). In addition, stress granules modulate
the flow of cellular information by sequestering important
signaling proteins during stress (Arimoto et al., 2008; Kedersha
et al., 2013; Wippich et al., 2013). Thus, the formation of stress
granules represents an adaptive cellular response that promotes
homeostasis in the face of environmental adversity.
Recruitment of TIA1 into stress granules is correlated with
self-multimerization and phase separation (Mackenzie et al.,
2017; Rayman et al., 2018) and is dependent on the C-terminal
prion-related domain (Gilks et al., 2004). Enrichment of glutamine
and asparagine residues in prion-related domains gives rise
to intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are a feature of
aggregation-prone proteins, such as TIA1. Under physiological
conditions, proteins with IDRs undergo phase separation and
aggregation in a regulated manner to promote the assembly
of membraneless organelles with distinct cellular functions,
including stress granules, P-bodies, and nucleoli (Shin and
Brangwynne, 2017). More recently, mutations that alter the
phase separation properties of IDR-containing proteins, such
as TIA1, have been linked to various neurodegenerative condi-
tions, including spinal muscular atrophy (Howell et al., 2017),
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal demen-
tia (FTD) (Mackenzie et al., 2017). Furthermore, TIA1 and stress
granules have been implicated in Welander distal myopathy
(Hackman et al., 2013; Klar et al., 2013) and tau pathophysiology
(Vanderweyde et al., 2016; Vanderweyde et al., 2012). In trans-
genic P301S Tau mice, reduction of TIA1 protects against neuro-
degeneration and rescues behavioral deficits (Apicco et al.,
2018). These studies collectively indicate that IDR-containing
proteins, such as TIA1, may contribute to the formation of recal-
citrant aggregates that can compromise neuronal function and
drive neurodegeneration.
Although there is much evidence implicating TIA1 in neuropa-
thology, it is clear that TIA1 also contributes to normal cellular
physiology. For example, at the molecular level, TIA1 is a splicing
factor that binds to U-rich motifs downstream of 50 splice sites
and facilitates alternative splice site recognition of pre-mRNAs
(Aznarez et al., 2008; Del Gatto-Konczak et al., 2000). In addition,
TIA1 represses translation of target mRNAs containing adenine-
and uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 30 UTR (Anderson and
Kedersha, 2002; Dixon et al., 2003). At the cellular level, TIA1 reg-
ulates lipid storage and membrane dynamics (Heck et al.,
2014), recruitment of the protein synthesis machinery to the
tubulin cytoskeleton (Li et al., 2014), cell cycle progression
(Meyer et al., 2018; Sa

 and mitochondrial function (Carrascoso et al., 2017; Tak et al.,
2017). Furthermore, these functions of TIA1 are not necessarily
intertwined with its role as a component in stress granules during
exogenously applied stress. However, the potential contribu-
tions of TIA1 to normal brain function, synaptic plasticity, and
behavior remain to be elucidated.
We were initially motivated to study the function of TIA1 in the
brain given our long-standing interest in the contribution of prion-
related proteins to learning and memory, in particular, ApCPEB
in Aplysia (Si et al., 2010) and CPEB3 in mouse (Fioriti et al.,
2015). Because TIA1 is highly expressed in the rodent hippo-
campus, we wondered if genetic perturbation of TIA1 might
impact hippocampus-dependent behavior. Here, we describe
a role for hippocampal TIA1 in conditioned odor avoidance,
contextual fear memory, and glucocorticoid-dependent long-
term potentiation (LTP). These studies may provide molecular
insights into the etiology of human psychiatric disorders that
are both heritable and stress-dependent, such as post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety states.
RESULTS
Expression of TIA1 in Hippocampus and Initial
Characterization of TIA1 Knockout Mice
TIA1 is expressed in the mouse brain (Beck et al., 1996) but is
particularly abundant in neurons of the pyramidal cell layer and
dentate gyrus in the hippocampus (Figures S1A, S1B, and
S1D). To begin to explore the potential contributions of TIA1 to
hippocampus-dependent behavior, we generated TIA1 knockout
(KO) mice and wild-type (WT) control littermates by crossing TIA1
heterozygous (Het) mice (Figures S1B and S1C). In contrast to
earlier studies (Piecyk et al., 2000), we did not observe embryonic
lethality among TIA1 KO pups. Moreover, TIA1 KO mice exhibited
grossly normal hippocampal cytoarchitecture (Figure S1B) and
were completely indistinguishable from WT littermates with
respect to appearance and general disposition during handling.
We also did not observe differences in body weight in female
TIA1 KO mice (Howell et al., 2017) (Figure S2A). These apparent
discrepancies with previous studies may be explained, in part,
by differences in genetic background and breeding strategies
(Howell et al., 2017). Finally, both male and female mice were uti-
lized in the behavioral and electrophysiological experiments. The
C57BL/6J background is relatively insulated from the effects of
estrous phase in the types of behaviors investigated in our study
(Keiser et al., 2017; Meziane et al., 2007), so female mice were not
rigorously monitored for estrous cycle by cytological methods.
Nevertheless, visual determination of estrous cycle phase (Byers
et al., 2012) did not reveal differences in phase distribution among
genotypes when ascertained in conjunction with behavioral
experiments (Figure S2B; data not shown). Finally, we note that
expression of TIA1 in the hippocampus was roughly 40% higher
in females than in males, suggesting the possibility of estrogen-
dependent regulation of TIA1 transcription (Figure S1E).
Conditioned Odor Avoidance Is Regulated by TIA1 in
Female Mice
The dorsal hippocampus is traditionally thought to contribute to
spatial learning and cognitive function, whereas the ventral hip-
pocampus (vHPC) regulates stress and emotion (Fanselow and
Dong, 2010). In addition, both hippocampal subdivisions also
contribute to non-spatial memory, including odor discrimination
learning and olfactory memory (Hess et al., 1995; Knafo et al.,
2004; Levita and Muzzio, 2010). In surveying potential behavioral
consequences of TIA1 deletion, we subjected TIA1 KO mice to
a battery of hippocampus-dependent tests that addressed
various aspects of hippocampal function over a range of time-
scales. One of many possibilities that we investigated was
whether TIA1 deletion might impact performance in olfactory-
based tasks. In the conditioned odor avoidance task (Pamplona
et al., 2011) (Figure 1A), mice are initially exposed to contextual
fear conditioning (CFC) in the presence of an odorant (e.g.,
70% ethanol) that is normally innocuous. However, a previously
neutral odor acquires salience when present during administra-
tion of an aversive stimulus, thus contributing to a multimodal
sensory representation of the aversive event. We hypothesized
that re-exposing mice to ethanol odor in a context otherwise
distinct from that of the fear conditioning chamber might reveal
genotype-dependent differences in avoidance behavior.
In this task, we detected a significant interaction between
treatment, genotype, and sex (p < 0.05, 3-way ANOVA) (Fig-
ure 1B). Post hoc comparisons revealed significant increases
in conditioned odor avoidance behavior in male mice at three
weeks after initial odor-shock pairing, independent of TIA1 geno-
type (p < 0.05 for effect of CFC for both WT and KO males)
(Figure 1B, left bars). In contrast, WT females showed essentially
no conditioned odor avoidance, whereas TIA1 KO females ex-
hibited avoidance behavior comparable to that observed in
males (p < 0.01 for WT versus KO females exposed to CFC
and p < 0.001 for effect of CFC on KO mice) (Figure 1B, right
bars). Alternatively, when the behavioral data were analyzed in
terms of actual time spent in each chamber rather than avoid-
ance index, WT females spent a comparable amount of time in
each test chamber at 3 weeks after fear conditioning, whereas
KO females spent significantly more time in the neutral odor
chamber than the conditioned odor chamber (p < 0.0001) (Fig-
ure S3A). Similar effects were observed for distanced traveled
in each chamber (Figure S3B). We conclude that avoidance
behavior is enhanced in TIA1 KO females in comparison to WT
controls.
Avoidance behavior in WT females was also absent at 24 h
after initial training (Figure S3C), indicating that the lack of avoid-
ance behavior at 3 weeks was not caused by failure to retrieve a
previously consolidated memory. Interestingly, WT female mice
exposed to CFC traveled significantly less in the conditioned
odor compartment versus in the neutral odor compartment at
24 h after training (p < 0.0001 for main effect of CFC, 2-way
ANOVA; p < 0.05 for neutral versus conditioned odor compart-
ments for mice exposed to CFC) (Figure S3D), which was
accompanied by a modest effect on actual time spent in each
chamber (Figure S3E). These observations suggest that female
mice were nevertheless capable of forming an association
between ethanol odor and foot shock, as evidenced by a selec-
tive reduction in distance traveled in the conditioned odor
compartment, despite not showing avoidance behavior. In other
words, although the behavioral outputs of WT and KO females
differed in this task, we conclude that both genotypes were
Cell Reports 26, 2970–2983, March 12, 2019
2971
 capable of detecting the presence of ethanol odor. Control mice,
which were neither exposed to CFC nor to ethanol, showed no
preference for either chamber and performed similarly to mice
exposed to ethanol in the absence of foot shocks (Figures 1B
and S3C; data not shown). Together, these findings identify a
sex difference in conditioned odor avoidance, in which WT and
KO males displayed odor avoidance behavior that was detect-
able for at least 3 weeks after conditioning, whereas WT females
showed little evidence of avoidance, at either early or extended
time intervals. Yet, deletion of TIA1 in females enabled the devel-
opment of conditioned odor avoidance that was otherwise not
observed in WT controls.

 In other hippocampus-dependent paradigms that we evalu-
ated, including open field, elevated-plus maze, forced-swim
test, and CFC (Deacon and Rawlins, 2005; Goeldner et al.,
2010; Kjelstrup et al., 2002), we did not detect any sex- or geno-
type-dependent differences in performance in TIA1 KO mice.
Specifically, all four groups of mice (WT female, TIA1 KO female,
WT male, and TIA1 KO male) exhibited normal CFC at both
remote (3 weeks) and recent (24 h) time points (Figures 1C and
S3F). All experimental groups spent a comparable amount of
time in the center of the open field arena (Figure 1D) or in the
open arms of the elevated-plus maze (Figure 1E), indicating no
genotype-dependent differences in anxiety-related or explor-
atory behavior. Mobility in the open field was also unaffected
by TIA1 deletion (Figure S3G), which is important to establish
given that TIA1 KO mice have been reported to develop a mild
arthritic phenotype (Phillips et al., 2004) that might prevent
interpretation of locomotion-dependent tasks. Deletion of TIA1
also had no impact on immobility in the forced-swim test (Fig-
ure 1F), indicating no differences in learned helplessness or
despair-like behavior. Within a broad range of behavioral tests
evaluated so far, these results in female mice suggest that the
consequences of TIA1 deletion are limited to conditioned odor
avoidance.
KO Females Exhibit Aberrant Stress- and
Corticosterone-Dependent LTP in the vHPC
The vHPC plays a critical role in regulation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and control of emotion and anxiety
(Adhikari et al., 2010; Calfa et al., 2007; Fanselow and Dong,
2010; Kheirbek et al., 2013). Earlier work also implicates the
vHPC in odor discrimination learning and olfactory memory (Lev-
ita and Muzzio, 2010). However, although much is known about
the role of the dorsal hippocampus in learning and memory,
comparatively little is known about the vHPC. Given the odor
avoidance phenotype of TIA1 KO female mice, we decided to
focus on the vHPC to identify potential electrophysiological
correlates of our behavioral data.
Because conditioned odor avoidance entails prior exposure to
CFC, we first investigated the impact of fear conditioning on LTP
in area CA3-CA1 of the vHPC. Slices prepared from naive ani-
mals performed similarly to those from mice exposed to ethanol
odor in the absence of shock pairing (Figure S4) and were used
as controls to maintain consistency throughout subsequent
in vitro manipulations. We found that male slices obtained after
fear conditioning exhibited LTP that was indistinguishable from
that in control slices, with no effect of TIA1 genotype (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, control slices from female mice of both genotypes
exhibited comparable magnitudes of LTP induction (Figure 2B).
However, slices prepared from WT females at 30 min after fear
conditioning exhibited reduced maintenance of LTP that was
not observed in KO slices (p < 0.05 for control versus fear condi-
tioned WT females) (Figure 2B). We did not formally assess the
potential contribution of sex differences by 3-way ANOVA
because of a prohibitively large sample size requirement (Heo
and Leon, 2010). Nevertheless, these electrophysiological
signatures correlated well with the behavioral data, with only
WT females showing a reduction in both avoidance behavior
and LTP maintenance in response to fear conditioning.
Intensely aversive paradigms, such as fear conditioning, lead
to systemic glucocorticoid release (GR) and consolidation of
fear memory (de Kloet et al., 2005; de Quervain et al., 2017).
Thus, we investigated the possibility that the relatively lower
magnitude of LTP observed in the WT vHPC of females after
fear conditioning might depend on glucocorticoid signaling.
Specifically, we prepared hippocampal slices from naive mice
and induced LTP with a 1 3 100 Hz tetanus, followed approxi-
mately 5–10 min later by bath application of corticosterone
(CORT), the major glucocorticoid in rodents. In our studies, the
timing of LTP induction and CORT administration was based
on the premise that LTP is induced in hippocampal circuits
shortly after an animal is placed into a novel environment and
that CORT is not detectable in hippocampal dialysates until
several min after foot shock (Pre
´ v^
ot et al., 2017). With this proto-
col, CORT treatment had no significant effect on KO slices from
males of either genotypes (Figure 2C), in agreement with the fear
conditioning data (Figure 2A). However, we found that CORT
produced significant downregulation of LTP in slices from naive
WT females (p < 0.05 for effect of CORT treatment) (Figure 2D),
comparable to the effect of fear conditioning (Figure 2B).
To confirm involvement of the GR in WT female slices, we
induced LTP followed by CORT treatment in the presence of
the GR antagonist RU486. The normal reduction in LTP mainte-
nance in female slices treated with CORT was blocked by
pre-incubation with RU486, consistent with GR-dependent
modulation of synaptic plasticity (control versus CORT, p <
0.05; control versus RU486+CORT, p > 0.05) (Figure 2D, left
graph). In all of the latter electrophysiological preparations, basal
synaptic transmission was similar (Figure 2E). These results sug-
gest that, within the parameters used in the electrophysiological
field recordings, LTP in the vHPC is CORT- and GR-dependent
only in WT females.
Finally, we attempted to rescue the electrophysiological
phenotype of TIA1 KO slices by re-introducing TIA1 by viral
transduction. However, we were unable to restore CORT-
dependent LTP in the female vHPC by using an adeno-associ-
ated virus (AAV)-TIA1-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-GFP
construct (Figure 2F), suggesting that TIA1 deletion may promote
compensatory developmental changes that bypass the effects
of reintroduced protein or that concurrent expression of both
major TIA1 isoforms may be necessary for rescue. In exploring
the former possibility, we found that deletion of TIA1 was not
associated with significant upregulation of the TIA1-related
protein TIAR (Figure 2G), which serves partially redundant func-
tions with TIA1 (Lo
´ pez de Silanes et al., 2005; Piecyk et al., 2000).
Thus, any potential compensatory effects of TIAR in the TIA1
KO background are not apparent at the protein level.

 Overexpression of TIA1 in the vHPC Enhances
CORT-Dependent Inhibition of LTP
To assess the specific functional contributions of TIA1 in the
vHPC by using an alternative strategy, we overexpressed full-
length untagged TIA1 in the WT hippocampus by stereotactic
injection of AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP or control AAV-IRES-GFP, tar-
geting primarily ventral CA1 (Figure S5A). Transduction of
hippocampal
neurons
with
AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP
produced
qualitative upregulation of TIA1 immunoreactivity and nuclear
localization in comparison to control neurons transduced with
AAV-IRES-GFP (Figure S5B).
In agreement with earlier data, male slices transduced with
AAV-IRES-GFP did not exhibit CORT-dependent reduction in
LTP maintenance (Figures 2C, 3A, and 3B). However, overex-
pression of TIA1 in male slices conferred sensitivity to CORT
that was otherwise not elicited with a 1 3 100 Hz tetanus

and

Again
consistent
with
previous observations, CORT treatment
caused a significant reduction in LTP
maintenance in female slices transduced
with AAV-IRES-GFP, which, in turn was
further potentiated by transduction of
AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP (p < 0.05 for effect
of CORT on slices transduced with AAV-
IRES-GFP, and p < 0.05 for effect of viral
construct with CORT treatment) (Figures

viral
construct
exhibited
comparable
input-output relationships of the CA3-
CA1 circuit within the range of stimulus
voltages used in the LTP experiments
(5–10 V) (Figure 3E). Together, these
electrophysiological data indicate that bidirectional genetic
perturbation of TIA1 can exert opposing effects on CORT-
dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.
Overexpression of TIA1 in the vHPC Inhibits Contextual
Fear Memory and Avoidance Behavior
As determined earlier, male mice exhibited conditioned odor
avoidanceirrespectiveofTIA1genotype,which,inturn,correlated
with persistent, CORT-insensitive LTP. Given that overexpression
ofTIA1 inthemale vHPCconferredsensitivitytoCORT (Figure3A),
we hypothesized that such a manipulation could reverse the
avoidance phenotype of males. Indeed, WT mice transduced
with AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP versus AAV-IRES-GFP no longer
exhibited conditioned odor avoidance (control versus CFC for
AAV-IRES-GFP, p < 0.05, and p > 0.05 for effect of CFC in animals
transduced with AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP) (Figures 4A and 4B).
To assess the behavioral specificity of TIA1 overexpression,
we next investigated whether other hippocampus-dependent
Cell Reports 26, 2970–2983, March 12, 2019
2975
 behaviors might be affected by this manipulation. In CFC exper-
iments, WT male mice transduced with AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP
exhibited a striking reduction in long-term memory, with essen-
tially no remote fear memory evident at 3 weeks after training (p <
0.0001 for AAV-IRES-GFP versus AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP at 24 h
and 3 weeks after training) (Figure 4C). Similar effects were
also observed in female mice (p < 0.0001 for AAV-IRES-GFP
versus AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP at 24 h and 3 weeks after training),
for which we also determined that short-term (2 h) contextual
fear memory was intact (Figure 4D). Thus, unlike the case of
global deletion of TIA1, overexpression in the WT vHPC had a
significant impact on long-term (24 h) and remote (3 wks) contex-
tual fear memory, as well as on avoidance behavior in males.
To determine whether the profound effects of TIA1 overex-
pression were specific to fear memory, we next subjected naive
mice to the novel object recognition task, a non-aversive behav-

ioral paradigm that depends on the vHPC
(Neugebauer et al., 2018). Transduction
of the vHPC with AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP
versus control virus failed to produce
any discernible effect on performance in
males or females (Figure 4E). In the
open field, another non-aversive behavioral paradigm, TIA1
overexpression likewise had little impact on performance (Fig-
ures 4F and 4G). Together, these behavioral and electrophysio-
logical findings are consistent with the notion that the functional
role of TIA1 in hippocampus-dependent behavior is restricted
to the processing or storage of aversive, stress-dependent
memories.
Enforced Expression of TIA1 in the vHPC Causes Global
Upregulation of Immune System Genes
Given the robust effects of TIA1 overexpression on contextual
fear memory, we performed transcriptional profiling of WT
vHPC tissue from virally transduced mice to gain molecular
insight into the electrophysiological and behavioral pheno-
types associated with TIA1 overexpression. Because CORT-
dependent electrophysiological phenotypes were apparent at
2976

 a relatively early time point and would proceed any de novo tran-
scriptional changes, we reasoned that TIA1 overexpression
might produce alterations in the transcriptome (at the level of
both gene expression and alternative splicing) that would be
evident in the naive animals.
Six biological replicates were prepared from vHPC slices from
each of two groups of female mice transduced with either AAV-
IRES-GFP or AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP, followed by RNA preparation
and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We identified 2,356 upregu-
lated genes and 264 downregulated genes in the AAV-TIA1-
IRES-GFP samples (Figures 5A and 5B). Gene enrichment
analysis revealed an overwhelming prevalence of immune-
related genes and processes (Figure 5C). In particular, the dra-
matic upregulation of cytokines, such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b),
IL-6, IFNg, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa)-related tran-
scripts was consistent with a pro-inflammatory response
(Table 1). Such an expression profile is reminiscent of what is
broadly observed in microglia (Das et al., 2015), retinal cells
(Qiu et al., 2017), and cortical neurons (Srinivasan et al., 2016)
exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Figure 5D), a bacterial
endotoxin commonly used to model neuroinflammation in ani-
mals (Hoogland et al., 2015). Notably, cytokines play important
roles in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-

and
Rivest,
2014;
Jones
and
Thomsen, 2013). Furthermore, overex-
pressing TIA1 in the vHPC altered exon us-
age of almost 3,000 genes in our dataset
(Figure 5B), of which approximately 38%
are potentially regulated by TIA1 in a direct
manner, based on intersection with human
protein-RNA interaction data from the
POSTAR2 database (Hu et al., 2017)
(data not shown).
Several of the top hits were validated at
the protein level by immunohistochem-
ical analysis. For example, we observed
TIA1-dependent enhancement of immunoreactivity for IL-1b
and complement C3 in pyramidal layer neurons (Figure 6A).
Also, immunostaining with the reactive microglia marker Iba1
revealed pronounced upregulation of immunoreactivity within
the pyramidal cell layer, despite little evidence of transduction
of Iba1-positive cells (weak or undetectable GFP signal) (Fig-
ure 6B), suggesting recruitment and/or activation of microglia
by TIA1-dependent intercellular signaling. These results support
the idea that TIA1 potentially regulates the expression and
alternative splicing patterns of a significant fraction of the
transcriptome, which, in turn, may be a reflection of direct
changes within transduced neurons as well as indirect effects
arising from the recruitment of non-transduced cells.
DISCUSSION
Avoidance behavior is an adaptive evolutionary response to a
potentially threatening environment. However, excessive or
inappropriate avoidance can be maladaptive and is recognized
as a core symptomatic dimension of PTSD (American Psychiat-
ric Association DSM-5 Task Force, 2013). Our results support
the idea that avoidance behavior is governed by competing
appraisal of safety cues and threatening stimuli and is shaped
Cell Reports 26, 2970–2983, March 12, 2019
2977
 by genes and experience. Avoidance behavior is among a reper-
toire of defensive strategies used by rodents confronted with a
threatening stimulus, while the specific choice of behavioral
response is also dependent on both sex and context (Albonetti
and Farabollini, 1995; Kalynchuk et al., 2004; Shansky, 2018).
Thus, the sensory modalities used to identify salient features of
a threatening environment or aversive experience are differen-
tially weighted in a sex- and context-dependent manner. Indeed,
among rodents, there are profound sex differences in both the
processing and use of olfactory cues (Manoli et al., 2013;
Stowers and Logan, 2010), which appear to be more enduring
and more salient for male mice than for females in the condi-
tioned odor avoidance paradigm described here, in line with
earlier work (Mihalick et al., 2000). However, deletion of TIA1
promotes odor avoidance behavior in female mice, which may
represent unmasking of a male-default olfactory circuit, a phe-
nomenon that has been described previously (Bakker et al.,
2002; Wesson et al., 2006). We propose that TIA1 contributes
to adaptive tuning of behavioral responses within the hippocam-
pus, which impacts both the storage of olfactory memory and the
choice of defensive strategy used by mice. These results build on
earlier work showing that the vHPC regulates conditioned defen-
sive behaviors in rodents (Pentkowski et al., 2006), which, in turn,
are deployed in a sex-dependent manner (Shansky, 2018).
In the most straightforward scenario, our results support a
general dose-dependent relationship between TIA1 expres-
sion in the vHPC, synaptic plasticity, and fear-related memory.
Deletion of TIA1 in females is associated with a ceiling-level of
avoidance behavior and CFC. At the normal expression level of
TIA1 found in WT males, TIA1 still has little impact on the latter
behaviors, although it contributes to other important biological
functions, such as innate immunity (Piecyk et al., 2000). At suc-
cessively higher levels of TIA1 expression found in the WT female
hippocampus, avoidance behavior (but not CFC) is inhibited and
is accompanied by a reduction in LTP maintenance in the vHPC.
Finally, at the highest levels of TIA1 expression, produced by viral
transduction of AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP, both avoidance and fear
conditioning are significantly reduced, along with maintenance
of LTP, in a sex-independent manner. We speculate that the
avoidance phenotype caused by TIA1 overexpression is sec-
ondary to the inhibition of fear memory consolidation, but that
it may be possible to dissociate performance in these behavioral
paradigms at a lower level of overexpression.
In attempting to reconcile the dissociability of avoidance and
contextual fear memory in female KO mice with the finding that
overexpression of TIA1 does not produce such dissociable
phenotypes, it is important to remember that these genetic ma-
nipulations are not entirely reciprocal. We cannot rule out the
possibility that the odor avoidance phenotype of TIA1 KO female
mice is dependent on extrahippocampal structures, given that
the gene is globally deleted and would likely alter functionality
of other brain regions as well. TIA1 deletion may also induce
compensatory developmental changes that influence pheno-
typic expression. Although the electrophysiological data are in
excellent agreement with the behavioral findings across a range
of experimental permutations, a definitive assessment of the role
of specific brain regions would require targeted deletion of TIA1.
Furthermore, although TIA1 may be dispensable for contextual
fear memory, overexpression of TIA1 could produce neomorphic
effects that impinge more broadly on associative fear memory
processes. An IDR-containing protein that is overexpressed
could potentially interact with other IDR-containing proteins,
thus altering the formation, dynamics, and function of phase-
separated condensates involved in a range of important cellular
functions (Plys and Kingston, 2018; Protter et al., 2018), which, in
turn, may not be sensitive to TIA1 deletion.
LTP is a cellular correlate of long-term memory, and numerous
studies have documented the ability of stress and glucocorti-
coids to modulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus
(Chaouloff and Groc, 2011; Maggio and Segal, 2007). Impor-
tantly, fear conditioning affected LTP in a manner identical to
CORT treatment, consistent with the idea that similar cellular
mechanisms may be recruited. CORT-dependent inhibition of
LTP in naive WT female slices further suggests that the attenua-
tion of LTP after fear conditioning is not caused by occlusion,
but is rather an active gating process that is driven by GR during
aversive stimulation. Also, because WT females exhibited a se-
lective reduction in ambulatory distance in the conditioned odor
compartment at 24 h after training, despite not showing avoid-
ance, we conclude that CORT- and GR-dependent inhibition of
LTP is not a reflection of an inability to establish an odor-shock
association but may represent inefficient encoding or attenuated
memory storage of particular contextual elements, such as odor.
Indeed, at 3 weeks after fear conditioning, only WT females failed
to show any indication of avoidance behavior, whereas explicit
fear memory was fully intact. These studies also suggest that
GR signaling in the female vHPC may be more critical for avoid-
ance behavior than for contextual fear memory.
Although the electrophysiological and behavioral data were
tightly correlated in our study, it remains to be determined
whether changes in CORT-dependent LTP in the vHPC are
required to support the behavioral phenotypes that we observed.
Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate the capacity of the vHPC
to exert dominant and specific effects on fear-related behavior.
Toward understanding the neural basis for the apparent speci-
ficity of TIA1 to fear memory, it will be informative to examine
how TIA1 might regulate functional connectivity between the
vHPC and key output structures, such as the amygdala, medial
prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus (Fanselow and Dong,
2010), particularly as the memory trace is subjected to systems
consolidation over remote time intervals.
An extensive literature has documented the profound ef-
fects of stress and glucocorticoids on learning and memory

 (Meir Drexler and Wolf, 2017; Schwabe et al., 2012). Because
prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids can have deleterious ef-
fects on these very processes, glucocorticoid activity is tightly
regulated by a number of positive and negative feedback path-
ways comprising the HPA axis (Herman et al., 2016; Silverman
and Sternberg, 2012; Wolkowitz et al., 2009). Our findings are
consistent with the idea that TIA1 is a component of one or
more regulatory loops that contribute to adaptive tuning of
glucocorticoid-dependent signaling during stress. Variations in
the activity state of TIA1 conceivably modulate this tuning
around an evolutionarily optimal set point. Interestingly, TIA1
has been implicated in alternative splicing of the GR (Rivers
et al., 2009), and it would be insightful to determine the compo-
sition of GR isoforms as a function of TIA1 genotype. Although
we did not find evidence of this possibility in the RNA-seq
data, a more sensitive method of detection may be required to
decipher the complexity of post-transcriptional regulation of
the GR.
In support of the behavioral and electrophysiological data,
transcriptional profiling suggests that TIA1 is a critical regulator
of a network of immune system genes that have additional roles
in learning and memory (Williamson and Bilbo, 2013), several of
which are specifically implicated in fear conditioning, including
IL-1b (Baartman et al., 2017; Goshen et al., 2007), IL-6
(Hu et al., 2018), IFN-g (Campos et al., 2014), and TNF-a (Jing
et al., 2015). Moreover, the absence of classical stress granules

 in hippocampal pyramidal neurons despite TIA1 overexpression
(Figure S5B) or fear conditioning (Figures S6) is consistent with
the notion that TIA1 functionality is not necessarily defined by
these canonical structures. Interestingly, administration of LPS
to rodents causes upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
leading to a constellation of phenotypes, such as decreased
mobility, reduced food intake, attenuation of hippocampal LTP,
and impaired performance in hippocampus-dependent tasks
(Dantzer and Kelley, 2007; Jo et al., 2001; Pugh et al., 1998;
Shaw et al., 2001). However, mice transduced with AAV-TIA1-
IRES-GFP in the vHPC (or those lacking TIA1 altogether) were
essentially indistinguishable from control littermates in the basal
state and only showed pronounced phenotypic changes in
response to aversive stress. LPS-induced ‘‘sickness behavior’’
may require GR as well as recruitment of other brain regions,
such as the hypothalamus (Thaler et al., 2009). There is substan-
tial crosstalk between stress response pathways and the im-
mune system (Bellavance and Rivest, 2014; Cain and Cidlowski,
2017; Frank et al., 2013), and our data indicate that the TIA1
regulatory network in the vHPC serves a modulatory rather
than executive role in memory formation. We also note that the
set of genes upregulated by TIA1 overexpression is much larger
than those of LPS-treated cells and that many other signaling
pathways may contribute to the electrophysiological and behav-
ioral phenotypes that we observe.
The molecular and cellular basis of how TIA1 overexpression
influences both synaptic plasticity and behavior is an important
open question and is likely to entail transcriptional, post-tran-
scriptional, and translational mechanisms, which, in turn,
interact with one another. For example, overexpression of TIA1
in neurons is associated with strongly enhanced immunoreac-
tivity in the nucleus (Figure S5B), which may potentiate its func-
tion as a regulator of alternative splicing, consistent with the
RNA-seq results. In turn, TIA1-dependent alterations in the
splicing patterns of transcription and translation factors may
promote differential gene expression of target genes. Whether
the effects are more indirect (e.g., activation of immune response
genes) or direct (e.g., alternative splicing of GR or other HPA-axis
related genes) merits further investigation. Given the vast num-
ber of changes in gene expression and exon use produced by
overexpression of TIA1, it is likely that the coordinated effects
of several TIA1-dependent metabolic pathways underlie the
observed behavioral and cellular phenotypes.
In conclusion, our studies have identified an unexpected link
between TIA1 function, stress-dependent synaptic plasticity
in the vHPC, and the processing of fear memory. We propose
that TIA1 is a genetic modifier of conditioned odor avoidance
behavior in mice, and our findings support the idea that TIA1
is a candidate susceptibility locus in stress-linked psychopa-
thology. Furthermore, because the behavioral phenotypes
associated with genetic perturbation of TIA1 are relatively
specific to fear memory, TIA1 may have utility as a therapeutic
target.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
All animal experiments were approved by, and conducted in accordance with the rules of, the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) at Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute. TIA1 KO mice (C57BL/6J) were obtained
from the laboratory of P.J.A. (Piecyk et al., 2000) to establish a breeding colony of TIA1 heterozygous mice at Columbia University.
Animals were genotyped for TIA1 by conventional PCR, using oligo pairs to distinguish the WT allele from a neoR cassette-bearing
KO allele. For behavioral and electrophysiological experiments involving TIA1 KO mice, all animals (3-6 mo. old) were obtained from
TIA1+/� crosses. For experiments involving viral manipulations, animals were WT C57BL/6J obtained from The Jackson Laboratory
(JAX). In behavioral and electrophysiological studies, both male and female mice were used, as specified in the figures and figure
legends. Female mice were used in transcriptional profiling studies and immunohistochemical analysis of immunological markers.

 METHOD DETAILS
Behavioral studies
CFC
Mice were given 2 3 2 s. foot shocks (.7 mA) during 3 min. exposure to the 70% ethanol-scrubbed chamber. Freezing behavior
was scored automatically by Video Freeze software (Med Associates). Re-exposure in the absence of additional foot shocks
was repeated at various intervals following training, using the same contextual conditions. Conditioned odor avoidance: Animals
were habituated in the center compartment of a 3-compartment enclosed apparatus (Kinder Scientific) with internal LEDs set to
50 lux. After 2 min. habituation in the center compartment, which was scrubbed with mild soap between runs, barriers were
removed to allow free exploration into differentially scented compartments (1% acetic acid and 70% ethanol, both freshly
deposited on new filter paper before each 5 min. run). Infrared beam breaks were used for automated scoring of animal move-
ment by MotorMonitor software (Kinder Scientific). To negate the potential effects of habituation, independent cohorts (before
versus after fear conditioning) were used in the CODA paradigm. Unless otherwise indicated, CODA experiments were per-
formed at 3 weeks after fear conditioning. Novel object recognition: On day 1, mice are habituated to the testing arena, a white
colored square open field box (46 X 46 cm), for 6 minutes. During the familiarization phase (day 2), two identical objects (gray
cuboids) were placed in two adjacent corners of the arena 9 cm from the nearest wall. Mice were introduced into the arena with
their head position opposite to the objects, and were allowed to explore for 6 minutes. On test day, one of the identical objects
was replaced by a novel object (metal cylinder), and the mice were allowed to explore the arena for 6 minutes. The arena and
the objects were cleaned with Virkon between runs. Sessions were recorded with EthoVision XT software (Noldus) and video
camera, scored by hand, and discrimination index (time spent with novel object - time spent with familiar object) / (time spent
exploring both objects) was calculated for each run. Open field: Mice were placed in the center of the open field apparatus
(Kinder Scientific) and movement (distance traveled) and % time in center versus periphery were automatically scored using
MotorMonitor software (Kinder Scientific) over the course of a 5 min. run. Elevated-plus maze: Mice were placed at the
intersection of a conventional apparatus facing an open arm away from the direction of the investigator. Video recordings
were performed using a video camera mounted above the apparatus, followed by manual scoring of time spent in the open
arms during a 5 min. run. Forced-swim test: 3 L transparent plastic beakers were filled with enough room temperature water
(�2 L) to prevent mouse tails from touching the bottom, but low enough to prevent climbing over the edge. Mice were gently
placed into the water, and movement during the 6 min. run was recorded by video. After the run, mice were removed from
the water, dried gently with paper towers, and placed into a heated cage (�33�C) for several minutes prior to being returned
to their home cages. Immobility (defined as cessation of essentially all movement except for respiration) was scored manually.
For all behavioral experiments, mice were allowed to acclimate to the test room for at least 1 h prior to testing, and were
immediately returned to their home cages after each run. Behavioral data acquisition and analysis were performed by
investigators with no prior knowledge of test subject genotype or viral manipulation.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (150 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively) and subjected to transcardial perfusion with
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline. After perfusion, brains were harvested, and 100 micron axial slices were
prepared using a Vibratome (Leica). Slices were blocked in Tris buffer with Triton X-100 (TBx) (.9% NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, and
0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with 3% BSA for 1 h at RT. Primary antibodies—anti-TIA1, anti-GFP, anti-complement C3, anti-
IL1beta—were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer and allowed to incubated overnight at 4 deg. Slices were then wash 3 3 10 min. with
TBx, and then incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in TBx + 3% BSA. Slices were again washed
3 3 10 min. with TBx, with Hoechst stain (10 mg/ml) added to the final wash. Slices were mounted on glass slides using FluorSave
reagent and imaged on an Olympus FluoView confocal microscope with a 40x 1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective. Raw data files (.oib)
were imported into NIH ImageJ to generate Z-sum projections.
Immunoblotting
Hippocampal tissue was harvested from WT and KO female mice (90 - 120 d old), and total protein extracts were prepared by incu-
bation in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Samples were resolved by standard SDS-PAGE,
transferred to Immobilon FL membrane (Millipore), and subjected to immunoblot using anti-TIA1, anti-TIAR, and anti-tubulin anti-
bodies. Samples were incubated with dye-conjugated secondary donkey anti-rabbit and anti-goat antibodies, followed by visualizing
and quantitation using a LI-COR Odyssey (LI-COR Biosciences).
Viral preparation and injections
Mouse full-length TIA1 cDNA was cloned into pAAV-CMV-IRES-GFP (Cell Biolabs) by conventional PCR-based cloning to generate
pAAV-CMV-TIA1-IRES-GFP, which was then used to generate high-titer AAV9 serotype virus (University of North Carolina Vector
Core). Control virus was generated using pAAV-CMV-IRES-GFP vector. Mouse surgeries were approved by the IACUC at the
New York State Psychiatric Institute and Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. At approximately 3 months
Cell Reports 26, 2970–2983.e1–e4, March 12, 2019
e2
 of age, mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine + 10 mg/kg xylazine (i.p.). Mice were immobilized in a stereotaxic frame,
an incision was made at the midline, and 1 mm burr holes were drilled into the pericranium to allow injection with a glass needle.
Holes were drilled bilaterally with the following coordinates: AP �3.08, LM +3.75/-3.88, DV 3.00. A total volume of 1-2 mL of virus
(4 3 1012 vg/ml) was infused at a rate of 0.5 mL / min. The needle was withdrawn 5 min. after completion of injection. Experiments
were started > 2 weeks later to allow for recovery from surgery.
Electrophysiology
3-7 mo. old mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, hippocampi were extracted, and 350 mm transverse slices were prepared
using a vibratome (Leica) with ice-cold dissection artificial cerebrospinal fluid (dACSF) (in mM: NaCl 10, sucrose 195, NaHCO3 25,
glucose 10, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.25, CaCl2 0.5, MgCl2 7) bubbled with 95% O2 / 5% CO2. Naturally cycling females were used,
but precautions were taken to mitigate the potential effects of proestrus (i.e., recording in the morning) (Warren et al., 1995). Slices
were transferred to holding tanks containing recording artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM: NaCl 125, NaHCO3 25, glucose 25,
KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.25, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1) and allowed to incubate for at least 60 min. at RT prior to experimentation, with continuous
bubbling of 95% O2 / 5% CO2. A glass recording electrode (.7-1.2 MU input resistance, filled with 1 M NaCl) and biconcentric stimulus
electrode were positioned in the stratum radiatum layer of CA3-CA1. Input-output relationship was determine by stimulating
slices with 5-30 V and recording field EPSPs. Stimulus voltage was established such that field EPSP slope was approximately
30% of that elicited by the maximal stimulus intensity. Once baseline signals remained stable for at least 20 min., LTP was induced
by a 1 s train at 1 3 100 Hz. For CORT experiments, 100 ng/ml final concentration of CORT was added to the ACSF perfusion reservoir
within 5 min. after LTP induction. Electrophysiological traces were analyzed using pCLAMP (Molecular Devices) to determine
average fEPSP slope across various conditions. The electrophysiology rig includes a Digidata 1500, Multiclamp 700B, and
MASTER-8 stimulus device.
Transcriptional profiling
Hippocampal slices from WT female mice (di- or metestrus) were harvested as if performing electrophysiological field
recordings. Expression of AAV-IRES-GFP or AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP was verified by examining GFP expression in each slice by
epifluorescence microscopy. Multiple GFP-positive slices from the ventral third of the hippocampus of a given animal were
pooled together. Slices were obtained from female mice transduced with either AAV-IRES-GFP or AAV-TIA1-IRES-GFP
(6 mice per virus).
RNA library preparation, sequencing reaction, and bioinformatics analysis were conducted at GENEWIZ, LLC. (South Plain-
field, NJ, USA). RNA samples were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNA
integrity was checked with Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). RNA sequencing library preparations
used the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina by following manufacturer’s recommendations (NEB, Ipswich,
MA, USA). Briefly, mRNA were first enriched with Oligod(T) beads. Enriched mRNAs were fragmented for 15 minutes at
94�C. First strand and second strand cDNA were subsequently synthesized. cDNA fragments were end repaired and adenylated
at 30ends, and universal adaptor was ligated to cDNA fragments, followed by index addition and library enrichment with
limited cycle PCR. The sequencing libraries were validated on the Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA,
USA), and quantified by using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as well as by quantitative PCR (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The sequencing libraries were clustered on one lane of a flowcell. After clustering, the flowcell was loaded on the Illumina HiSeq
instrument according to manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were sequenced using a 2x150 Paired End (PE) configuration.
Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HiSeq Control Software (HCS). Raw sequence data (.bcl files) generated
from Illumina HiSeq was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina’s bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mismatch
was allowed for index sequence identification.
After investigating the quality of the raw data, sequence reads were trimmed to remove possible adaptor sequences and
nucleotides with poor quality using Trimmomatic v.0.36. The trimmed reads were mapped to the Mus musculus GRCm38
reference genome available on ENSEMBL using the STAR aligner v.2.5.2b. The STAR aligner is uses a splice aligner that detects
splice junctions and incorporates them to help align the entire read sequences. BAM files were generated as a result of this
step. Unique gene hit counts were calculated by using Feature Counts from the Subread program v.1.5.2. Only unique reads that
fell within exon regions were counted.
After extraction of gene hit counts, the gene hit counts table was used for downstream differential expression analysis. Using
DESeq2, a comparison of gene expression between the groups of samples was performed. The Wald test was used to generate
p values and Log2 fold changes. Genes with adjusted p values < 0.05 and absolute log2 fold changes > 1 were called as differ-
entially expressed genes for each comparison. To estimate the expression levels of alternatively spliced transcripts, the splice
variant hit counts were extracted from the RNA-seq reads mapped to the genome. Differentially spliced genes were identified
for groups with more than one sample by testing for significant differences in read counts on exons (and junctions) of the genes
using DEXSeq. Gene ontology analysis of statistically significant hits was performed using DAVID Bioinformatics website (https://
david.ncifcrf.gov/).
