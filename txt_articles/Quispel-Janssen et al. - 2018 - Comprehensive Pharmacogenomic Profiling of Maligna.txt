Abstract
Purpose: Despite intense research, treatment options for
patients with mesothelioma are limited and offer only modest
survival advantage. We screened a large panel of compounds in
multiple mesothelioma models and correlated sensitivity with
a range of molecular features to detect biomarkers of drug
response.
Experimental design: We utilized a high-throughput chemical
inhibitor screen in a panel of 889 cancer cell lines, including both
immortalized and primary early-passage mesothelioma lines,
alongside comprehensive molecular characterization using Illu-
mina whole-exome sequencing, copy-number analysis and Affy-
metrix array whole transcriptome profiling. Subsequent valida-
tion was done using functional assays such as siRNA silencing and
mesothelioma mouse xenograft models.
Results: A subgroup of immortalized and primary MPM lines
appeared highly sensitive to FGFR inhibition. None of these lines
harbored genomic alterations of FGFR family members, but rather
BAP1 protein loss was associated with enhanced sensitivity to
FGFR inhibition. This was confirmed in an MPM mouse xenograft
model and by BAP1 knockdown and overexpression in cell line
models. Gene expression analyses revealed an association
between BAP1 loss and increased expression of the receptors
FGFR1/3 and ligands FGF9/18. BAP1 loss was associated with
activation of MAPK signaling. These associations were confirmed
in a cohort of MPM patient samples.
Conclusions: A subgroup of mesotheliomas cell lines
harbor sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. BAP1 protein loss
enriches for this subgroup and could serve as a potential
biomarker to select patients for FGFR inhibitor treatment.
These data identify a clinically relevant MPM subgroup for
consideration of FGFR therapeutics in future clinical studies.

Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a tumor arising
from the pleural cavity and is strongly associated with occupa-
tional exposure to asbestos. Although strict regulation is in place
in more than 50 countries, in parts of the world where there is still
widespread usage of asbestos, most notably in South America,
Russia, and states of the former Soviet Republic, China, and
South-East Asia, the incidence of this disease is rising (1, 2). MPM
is highly refractory to conventional anticancer therapies, and the
prognosis is poor; most patients die within a year of diagnosis.
Surgery with curative intent is only possible in a highly selected
group of patients and needs to be combined with chemotherapy.
The only approved treatment, a combination of the cytotoxic
agents cisplatin and pemetrexed, yields at best modest improve-
ments in survival (3, 4). Despite many clinical studies utilizing
novel biological therapies, there are as yet no effective targeted
therapies for this cancer (5, 6).
A recent comprehensive genomic analysis of 216 MPM
samples found BAP1, NF2, TP53, SETD2, and CDKN2A to be
recurrently mutated or structurally rearranged (7). The land-
scape is thus one of mutated tumor suppressor genes and
alterations in pathways as diverse as Hippo, mTOR, and TP53,
as well as histone methylation. Such loss-of-function oncogenic
events are typically considered "undruggable," but downstream
programs of genes, activated as a consequence of such muta-
tions, may themselves be tractable therapeutic targets. This is
illustrated by NF2-deficient tumors with activated focal adhe-
sion kinase (FAK). Defactinib, a FAK inhibitor, demonstrated
efficacy in NF2-deficient tumors in vitro (8) but a subsequent
clinical trial in mesothelioma was halted due to lack of efficacy.
Other drugs tested to date that have failed to improve the
outcome in MPM include EGFR inhibitors (9), Bcr–Abl

 inhibitors (10), thalidomide (11), bortezomib (12), and vor-
inostat (13). In many of these studies, a subgroup of patients
appeared to derive some benefit. However, in MPM, it has been
difficult to elucidate reproducible biomarkers that identify
these sensitive subgroups. Some research groups have demon-
strated coactivation of multiple RTK pathways in MPM tumors,
which may provide a rationale for combination therapies with
kinase inhibitors (14).
We aimed to utilize high-throughput chemical screening plat-
forms alongside molecular characterization of immortalized and
early-passage cell line models of MPM to uncover critical signaling
pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic interrogation.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines and tissue culture
Cells are grown and maintained in either RPMI or DMEM F/12
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Cell lines were maintained at 37�C at 5% CO2. All cell lines have
been verified by genotyping using short tandem repeat (STRs)
profiling and Sequenom profiling of a panel of 92 single-nucle-
otide polymorphisms.
Cell viability assays
Cells are trypsinized and counted before seeding at the optimal
density for the well size (either 96- or 384-well plates were used)
and duration of the assay. Seeding density was optimized by
titration of the cells such that upon visual inspection of the control
wells at the end of the assay, a confluency of 70% to 90% was
observed allowing cells to grow in a linear phase. Adherent cell
lines were seeded 24 hours before drug addition. The high-
throughput chemical inhibitor screen was carried out using
384-well plates, and viability was measured 72 hours after drug
addition with a 5-point serial fourfold concentration range of
265 compounds. All other viability assays were carried out using
96-well plates and a 9-point twofold dilution of the drugs. Drugs
were all dissolved in DMSO, and DMSO was used only as a
control condition. At the end of the experiment, cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde. Following two washes with dH2O,
100 mL of Syto60 nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) was added to a
final concentration of 1 mmol/L (a 1/5,000 stock dilution), and
plates were fixed for 1 hour at room temperature. Quantification
of fluorescent signal was achieved using a Paradigm (BD) plate
reader using excitation/emission wavelengths of 630/695 nm.
Data were analyzed by adjusting for background signals and
normalizing each well to the DMSO-treated control.
High-throughput screening compounds
Compounds were acquired from academic collaborators or
commercial vendors. Each compound, its therapeutically relevant
target substrate and pathway, and the minimum and maximum
screening concentrations are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Compounds were stored as 10 mmol/L aliquots at �80�C and
were subjected to a maximum of 5 freeze–thaw cycles. Each of
the agents was screened at a 5-point serial fourfold dilution to
provide a 256-fold range from the lowest to highest concentra-
tion. The concentrations selected for each compound were based
on in vitro data to cover the range of concentrations known to
inhibit relevant kinase activity and cell viability.
Apoptosis assay
Cells were seeded in a flat-bottom 384 wells plate at optimal
cell density. After 24 hours, PD173074 and AZD 4547 in a
concentration range between 0.007813 and 1 mmol/L were added
using a Tecan HP D300 Digital Dispenser. Five replicate wells were
assayed for each condition. Phenylarsine oxide (20 mmol/L) was
used as positive control condition. To assess apoptosis, 5 mmol/L
of IncuCyte caspase-3/7 green apoptosis assay reagent was
added to the cells. Confluence and apoptosis levels were quan-
tified by IncuCyte Zoom live-cell imaging systems from Essen
Bioscience. Relative apoptosis was calculated by dividing the
confluence of fluorescent apoptotic cells by total confluence and
normalized to the positive control condition.
Western blots
Cell monolayers were lysed on ice in NP40 Cell Lysis Buffer
(Invitrogen) containing fresh protease and phosphatase in-
hibitors (Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
10 minutes and the supernatant used for analyses. Protein
concentration was calculated from a standard curve of BSA
using the BCA assay (calbiotech) according to the manufac-
turer's instructions. Equal protein concentrations were loaded
on pre-cast 4% to 12% Bis–Tris SDS-PAGE Gels (Invitrogen),
run at 200 V for 1 hour. Proteins were transferred onto a
methanol activated PVDF membrane at 100 V for 1 hour or
overnight at 30 V. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk for
1 hour before the addition of primary antibody at a concen-
tration recommended. After overnight incubation with the
primary antibody at 4�C, the membrane was washed three
times in 0.1% TBS-T followed by incubation with the second-
ary antibody according to the supplier's description at 1/2,500
dilution). Immunoblots were imaged using Pierce Supersignal
Plus chemiluminescent kit on a gel imager (Syngene). Anti-
bodies against BAP1, pERK, ERK, pFGFR (total), and pFGFR1
(all from Cell Signaling Technologies) and the polyclonal
p-FGFR3 antibody sc-33041 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
used. Beta Tubulin was used as a loading control for Western
blots. Phospho-RTK arrays (RD Systems) and caspase-Glo 3/7
assay were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Translational Relevance
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has limited treat-
ment options and a dismal prognosis. To date, targeted ther-
apies have proved ineffective, and no druggable genetic altera-
tions have been identified. Selecting compounds for further
clinical evaluation in this small and heterogeneous patient
group is challenging. By combining high-throughput drug
screens, comprehensive molecular characterization and func-
tional assays in multiple mesothelioma models, we were able
to identify an FGFR inhibitor–sensitive subgroup with BAP1
loss as a potential predictive biomarker. Loss of BAP1 is found
in up to 64% of MPM tumors. These data suggest that a
significant group of patients with mesothelioma may benefit
from FGFR inhibition.

 biopsies, and germline DNA. Diagnosis was made on tumor
biopsies according to local IHC protocols and confirmed by the
Dutch mesothelioma panel, a national expert panel of certified
pathologists that evaluate all suspected mesothelioma patient
samples. Early-passage primary mesothelioma cultures were gen-
erated from tumor cells isolated from pleural fluid of patients at
the Netherlands Cancer Institute. The pleural fluid was centri-
fuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature. Erythro-
cyte lysis buffer was used to remove erythrocytes if many were
present. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with peniciline/strepto-
mycin and 8% fetal calf serum. The cells were seeded in T75 flasks
at a density of 1 � 106 cells/mL and incubated at 37�C at a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Medium was refreshed depend-
ing on cell growth, usually twice a week. At seeding and during the
first two passages, cytospins were made and stained with HE and
reviewed by our pathologist to determine the percentage of tumor
cells. If the tumor percentage was over 70%, usually reached after
one passage, living cell cultures were transported to the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute within 6 hours for drug screening and
genetic analysis. Cells were cultured for a maximum period of
4 weeks.
RNA interference and transfection
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermofisher) was used according
to product guidelines for transfection with siRNA against FGFR3
(Thermo Fisher Silencer Select s5167 and s5169) or BAP1
(s15822) utilizing the protocol "forward transfection of mam-
malian cell lines." KIF11 siRNA (s7902) was used as a transfection
(positive) control. Viability or protein expression was assayed as
described above, at specified time points. H226 cell expressing a
BAP1 stable construct, and BAP1 C91A mutant lines were a kind
gift from K Kolluri (UCL, London).
Gene expression analyses
Microarray data were generated on the Human Genome
U219 96-Array Plate using the Gene Titan MC instrument
(Affymetrix). The robust multi-array analysis (RMA) algorithm
(15) was used to establish intensity values for each of 18562
loci (BrainArray v.10). We discarded transcripts with low sam-
ple variance and consolidated duplicated genes by averaging
their expression values across duplicates. The resulting data
were subsequently normalized (m ¼ 0; s ¼ 1) sample-wise and
gene-median centered. Raw data were deposited in ArrayEx-
press (accession E-MTAB-3610).
The RMA processed dataset is available at www.cancerrxgene.
org/gdsc1000/GDSC1000_WebResources/Home.html.
The expression-level signal of each gene was normalized using a
nonparametric kernel estimation of its cumulative density func-
tion as described in ref. 16. Additionally, the normalized expres-
sion values were further tissue-centered using as grouping factors
the cell line tissue labels of ref. 17.
MPM mouse xenograft models
All animal experiments were conducted according to institu-
tional guidelines under protocol approved by the animal ethics
committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute. To establish
xenografts, 3 million human mesothelioma cells (H2731 and
MSTO211H) were implanted subcutaneously into the right dorsal
flank of 6- to 7-week-old female nude SCID mice. Mice were
randomized into vehicle and drugs treatment groups, and treat-
ment was initiated once the tumor volumes reached approxi-
mately 200 mm3. Tumor size was measured with calipers twice a
week, and tumor volume was determined as a � b2 � 0.5, where a
and b were the large and small diameters, respectively.
Results
High-throughput chemical inhibitor screens in immortalized
cell lines
A panel of 889 cancer cell lines was screened with 265 com-
pounds that included targeted and cytotoxic compounds (for
detail see http://www.cancerrxgene.org/). It was observed that
three of 19 MPM lines (H2795, H2591, and MSTO-211H) had
IC50 values among the top 5% of cell lines showing highest
sensitivity to the compound PD-173074, an FGFR1 and FGFR3
kinase inhibitor (Fig. 1A; ref. 15). These three cell lines, together
with two additional MPM lines (NCI-H28, resistant; MPP-89,
partially sensitive) and an FGFR-dependent lung cancer cell line
harboring amplification of FGFR1 (NCI-H1581), were rescreened
with PD-173074 and were as sensitive to PD-173074 as the
FGFR1-dependent lung cancer line NCI-1581 (Fig. 1B). Further-
more, this sensitivity was also seen with two more selective FGFR
inhibitors, NVP-BGJ398 and AZD4547 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Sensitivity to PD-173074 in the MPM cell lines was confirmed by
clonogenic survival assays (Fig. 1C). Although some sensitive
lines died by apoptosis, as is shown by activated caspase activity
with both PD-173074 and the multi–FGFR-targeted inhibitor
AZD4547 (Fig. 1D and E), not all sensitive lines showed a dose
incremental increase in this marker.
These data confirm previous findings (18) that a subset of MPM
cell lines require FGF pathway activation for growth and survival,
and that targeting this pathway could be a critical step in the
control of these tumors.
Drug sensitivity in early-passage MPM cultures
To test whether these observations could be reproduced in an
independent cohort of primary mesothelioma cell lines, a panel
of 11 pleural fluid-derived early-passage cultures from patients
with MPM tumors were obtained and screened for viability using a
panel of 48 small molecule inhibitors including PD-173074.
Most of the early-passage cultures were resistant to virtually
all agents (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, one MPM early-
passage culture (NKI04) did demonstrate marked sensitivity to
PD-173074. The sensitivity of NKI04 to FGFR inhibition was
confirmed in a longer duration clonogenic survival assay, and
the effect on cell viability was comparable with that seen in the
FGFR1-amplified NCI-H1581 lung cancer cell line (Fig. 2A–C).
Molecular characterization of FGF pathway signaling in cell
lines and patient samples
In order to understand the basis for the observed sensitivity to
FGFR inhibition, we analyzed whole-exome sequence and copy
number array data for 21 MPM lines (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/
cell_lines). There was no evidence of activating mutations or
whole gene amplifications in any FGFR family member. RNA
sequencing has been undertaken and shows no evidence of a
fusion transcript involving any member of the FGFR family in any
of the MPM cell lines (personal communication, M. Garnett). We
then analyzed the corresponding gene expression data and
focused on differential expression of FGFR and FGF family mem-
bers in PD-173074-sensitive and -resistant MPM cell lines.

 Normalized expression of each of the FGF and FGFR family genes
was correlated with sensitivity to PD-173074 to explore whether
the variation in any single family member, either ligand or
receptor, was associated with response to FGFR inhibition. We
found a statistically significant correlation between elevated FGF9
mRNA expression and response to PD-173074 (P ¼ 0.0148) and
AZD4547 treatment (P0.0098; Fig. 3A). FGF9 is a secreted, high-
affinity ligand for the FGFR3 receptor, with low affinity for the
FGFR1 and FGFR2 receptors (19). To determine whether a subset
of MPM exhibits elevated expression of the FGF9 ligand in
patients, we analyzed gene expression from a panel of 53 assorted
MPM and matched normal lung clinical samples (Fig. 3B; ref. 20).
Overall, we observed significantly higher FGF9 transcript levels in
MPM tumors compared with pleura and lung normal tissue (P <
0.0001). Therefore, similar to our observation in the MPM cell
lines, a subset of patient samples also demonstrates high levels of
FGF9 expression.
Modulation of FGF/FGFR function in MPM lines
A possible premise for the observed sensitivity of MPM lines
that express high levels of FGF9 would be activation of the FGFR3
receptor kinase in an autocrine loop and subsequent engage-
ment of prosurvival downstream signaling pathways. Indeed, a
comparison of phosphorylation status of 42 receptor tyrosine
kinases between a small sample of MPM cell lines demonstrated
increased phosphorylation of FGFR3 in the sensitive line H2795
but not in resistant lines Met-5A and NCI-H28 (Fig. 3C).
To further confirm a critical role for FGFR3, this transcript
was silenced by siRNA in a panel of MPM cell lines and the
direct effect on cell viability was measured. Transient siRNA-
mediated silencing of the FGFR3 transcript reduced cell viabil-
ity in all 3 FGFR inhibitor–sensitive cell lines, but not in the
FGFR inhibitor–resistant lines. This indicates a dependency on
FGFR3 mediated signaling of the FGFR inhibitor–sensitive lines
(Fig. 3D). As would be expected, inhibition of FGFR3 by the
specific inhibitors AZD4547 and BJG398 decreased pERK
levels (Fig. 3E), and this was also seen following siRNA-medi-
ated silencing of FGFR3 in H2795 and MSTO-211H (Fig. 3F).
The addition of the FGF9 ligand to MPM cells lacking baseline
FGFR3 activation was able to induce phosphorylation of
FGFR3 and a change in the growth kinetics of this cell line in
a dose-dependent fashion (Supplementary Fig. S5).

 Role of BAP1 in modulating FGF pathway signaling
Although we failed to identify genomic alterations in any
member of the FGFR family that might explain the sensitivity
to FGFR inhibition, we reasoned that this dependency might
also be the consequence of other gene aberrations up- or
downstream of FGFR3 signaling. We evaluated the gene expres-
sion and mutation database for other statistical associations
explaining sensitivity to the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 in the
panel of MPM cell lines. We focused on driver mutations or
copy-number alterations in three of the most frequently mutat-
ed genes in MPM, namely, BAP1, NF2, and CDKN2A (7). We
detected
a
weak
but
nonsignificant
association
between
AZD4547 sensitivity and BAP1 mutations in the sensitive cell
lines (Fig. 4A). Given that loss of BAP1 protein expression
might also occur through nonmutational mechanisms as pre-
viously described (21), we additionally characterized BAP1

 protein status in these lines by Western blot analysis (Supple-
mentary Figs. S3 and S4). When sensitivity to the AZD4547 was
correlated with BAP1 protein expression (low/absent vs.
expressed), there was a significant correlation between loss of
BAP1 expression and sensitivity (P ¼ 0.0208; Fig. 4B).
Functional consequences of BAP1 modulation on FGFR
signaling.
Because silencing FGFR3 reduced cell viability in a subset of
MPM lines, we next investigated whether this dependency on
FGFR signaling was regulated by BAP1. BAP1 is a nuclear deubi-
quitinating enzyme with many unelucidated functions that might
include modulation of the FGFR pathway. Silencing of BAP1
expression resulted in increased phosphorylation of FGFR3
(Fig. 4C). Conversely, restoring BAP1 expression in the BAP1-
null MPM line (Fig. 4D) H226 resulted in a decrease in pFGFR and
a modest increase in resistance to the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547
(Fig. 4E).
We observed increased expression at the protein level in the
BAP1 mutant cell lines of other RTK receptor genes and their
appropriate ligands also known to be important in cell survival
signaling in MPM such as PDGFRB, IGF1-R, and MET (22) using
phospho-RTK arrays (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). The
H226-null MPM cell line was transfected with a wild-type BAP1
construct and a functionally inactive C91A-mutant BAP1 con-
struct. Gene expression analysis on these two lines was performed
and Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) of the data (Sup-
plementary Table S) demonstrated that among the most signif-
icantly activated pathways in BAP1-inactive cells is the "Bladder
Cancer" pathway including FGFR3 (arrow, Supplementary Fig.
S6A) illustrated in Supplementary Figure S6B (23). In summary,
the gene expression analysis demonstrates that BAP1 loss of
function is associated with a transcriptional response upregulat-
ing not only FGFR signaling but also other RTKs such as PDGFRB,
CMET, and IGF1R, that may be important mediators of cell
growth and survival. However, only FGFR inhibitors showed a
significant viability effect as single agents. We analyzed gene
expression data from a study of 51 mesothelioma tumor samples
to see if a similar effect on the FGFR pathway was seen in vivo (40
BAP1 wild-type and 11 mutant; GEO GSE29354; ref. 24).
Amongst members of the FGFR signaling family, BAP1-mutant
tumors did indeed demonstrate increased expression of FGF18,
FGFR2, and FGFR3 relative to BAP1 wild-type tumors (Supple-
mentary Table). To explore this association further in human
tumors, we analyzed the available TCGA data and looked for the
incidence of genetic and mRNA alterations of these genes in MPM
tumors by BAP1 status (Fig. 4F). This showed the majority of
dysregulation (10 of 14) events in FGF9, FGF18, and FGFR3
occurred in the context of BAP1 gene or mRNA dysregulation.
FGFR inhibition in MPM xenograft model
To assess the in vivo efficacy of targeting FGFR in MPM, we
established a xenograft model using the FGFR inhibitor–sensitive
MPM lines H2795 and MSTO-211H. Mice were treated with
AZD4547, a selective inhibitor of FGFR1/2/3, which is currently
being evaluated in clinical trials. We observed that treatment
with AZD4547 resulted in significant growth inhibition in the
H2795- and MSTO-211H–derived tumors (Fig. 5A). Further-
more, AZD45457 treated tumors showed a reduction in pERK
signaling by immunohistochemistry compared with vehicle con-
trol-treated tumors (Fig. 5B), indicating target engagement by the
drug in this model. Caspase activation was also seen in drug-
treated tumors suggesting apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Combination therapeutic screen
As the single-agent efficacy of FGFR inhibition was seen only
in a subset of MPM cell lines, and because persistent pAKT
pathway activation was seen in cell lines not responsive to
FGFR inhibition, we hypothesized that a combination screen
utilizing a PI3 kinase inhibitor may reveal useful synergies. We
undertook an anchor-based combination screen in 15 MPM cell
lines using 95 small-molecule inhibitors (see Supplementary
Table for details) selected to target many critical pathways in
cancer, both as single agents and in combination with a fixed
dose of the PI3 Kinase inhibitor AZD6482. The resulting
difference in area under the curve (AUC) between single agent
small-molecule inhibitor and the combination with AZD6482
was used to calculate synergy. The most recurrent synergistic
interactions were seen with IGF1R inhibitor BMS-536924
and FGFR inhibitor PD-173074 (Supplementary Fig. S8A) with
synergy observed in seven and six of 15 lines, respectively.
Supplementary Fig. S8B shows a validation dose–response
curve of the FGFRi-resistant NCI H28 cell lines showing min-
imal effect of BMS 536824 or AZD6482 alone, but reduced
viability and pAKT reduction with the combination. This cyto-
toxicity is not seen in the mesothelial control cell line Met5a,
suggesting that the synergy is not generic but cell line specific.
Discussion
Because MPM is a rare and heterogeneous tumor, it is notori-
ously difficult to identify and characterize responding subgroups
in clinical trials. Our work illustrates the application and possi-
bilities of comprehensive pharmacogenomic profiling appro-
aches in intractable cancers such as MPM. The finding of FGFR
inhibitor sensitivity in a subgroup of immortalized MPM cell
lines represents a potentially novel therapeutic approach for this
tumor type. As immortalized cell lines may undergo genetic
drift, we also confirmed our findings in primary mesothelioma
early-passage lines.
Dysregulation of the FGFR pathway has been described in
many cancer types (25, 26). FGF9 signaling through FGFR3 has
been shown to have a role in the development and progression
of tumor cells in mouse models for NSCLC and prostate cancer
(27). In MPM cell line models, we observed that high levels of
the ligand FGF9 were strongly correlated with sensitivity to the
FGFR inhibitor PD-173074 and AZD4547. We hypothesize that
the effects of FGF9 are mediated through FGFR3 signaling, as
illustrated by modulation of downstream ERK phosphorylation
upon chemical inhibition with small-molecule inhibitors of
FGFR3 and knockdown of FGFR3. FGFR3 is conversely not
phosphorylated in cell lines insensitive to FGFRi, and this
phosphorylation can be induced by the addition of synthetic
FGF9 ligand. Interestingly, there was variability in FGF9 mRNA
expression levels among the MPM cell lines, similar to what is
observed in tumors in previously published studies. Recently,
other groups demonstrated efficacy of FGFR inhibition in
preclinical models of MPM mediated by other FGF-pathway
members such as FGFR1 (18, 28, 29). We confirm the efficacy of
a clinically utilized FGFR inhibitors including AZD4547 in vivo
in MPM xenograft models. Furthermore, since undertaking
these studies, early-phase clinical work with pharmacokinetic

 data has been published (30, 31) on AZD4547 and BGJ398.
These have confirmed that the doses used in the in vitro work
(100 nmol/L to 1 mnmol/L) here are achievable in plasma in
vivo and are able to modulate the target, with pharmacody-
namic end points of target engagement with FRS2 downregula-
tion and changes in serum phosphate levels seen.
FGF receptors and ligands are being targeted in clinical trials by
both selective and nonselective FGFR TKI's and monoclonal
antibodies (32) and AZD4547 has shown modest clinical activity
in tumors with FGFR pathway aberrant activation (33). In MPM
dovitinib, a multitargeting kinase inhibitor with activity against
FGFR has been trialed and has failed in small cohort of patients
with MPM (34). Because the data across tumor types demonstrate
only a small group of patients responds to FGFR inhibition, it is
crucial to find biomarkers that predict response to FGFR inhibi-
tion. Guagnano et al. integrated genomic and transcriptomic data
of about 500 tumor cell lines with drug-sensitivity data to find
predictive biomarkers for response to FGFR inhibitor NVP-
BGJ398. A genetic alteration in one of the four FGF receptors was
found in 7% of cell lines, but only about half of the cell lines with
such an alteration was found to be sensitive (35).
We did not find any mutation, amplification, or fusion tran-
scripts of the FGFR family in the inhibitor-sensitive MPM cell
lines. The genes that were most recurrently altered in our MPM cell
lines include CDKN2A, BAP1, and NF2. The frequency at which
these genes were mutated is broadly similar to those previously
described in clinical MPM samples (6, 7).
We show that loss of BAP1 expression was associated with
sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. This finding was further validated
with modulation of pFGFR signaling and dose–response kinetics
to FGFR inhibition following siRNA-mediated knockdown and
BAP1 overexpression in MPM cell lines. Caveats with this asso-
ciation were also observed: NCI-H28 was one of the most resistant
cell lines to FGFR inhibition but carried a BAP1 homozygous
deletion, suggesting that BAP1 loss may enrich for FGFR inhib-
itor–sensitive cell lines but that some heterogeneity of drug
response may still be observed. BAP1 (BRCA-associated protein
1) is a nuclear deubiquinating enzyme that controls gene expres-
sion by interaction with numerous transcription factors and other
complexes, including those of the double strand DNA-break
repair machinery (36). BAP1 thus influences cell-cycle progres-
sion (37) and double-strand DNA break repair (38). We show
here that its loss may also affect gene expression of FGF pathway
members, thereby enhancing signaling through this pathway.
The BAP1 gene is inactivated by somatic mutation in 23% to
64% of patients with MPM and between 1% and 47% in other
tumor types (24, 39-43). Furthermore, BAP1 protein levels are
undetectable in about 25% of MPM with normal BAP1 gene
status, likely by epigenetic modification (24). BAP1 loss was
observed to enrich for FGFR inhibitor–sensitive MPM lines, and

 expression of C91 hydrolase inactive mutant versus wild-type
BAP1 protein in the H226 cell line induced activation of FGFR3
signaling. We hypothesize that inactivation of BAP1 in MPM,
possibly through its function as a ubiquitin hydrolase, induces
changes in gene expression of both FGF family ligands and
receptors to stimulate cell growth and survival.
We performed a combination drug screen to assess the impact
of novel combinations oftargeted therapies on MPM cell lines. On
the 15 MPM cell lines screened, we found that FGFR and IGF1R
inhibitors were the most recurrently synergistic with the PI3-
kinase inhibitor AZD6482. This is the first time, to our knowledge,
that both a single agent and combination therapeutic screen have
been performed, which point to the primacy of the FGFR signaling
pathway in MPM. Interestingly, one of the most resistant cell lines
to FGFR inhibition was amenable to treatment with AZD6482
plus IGF1R inhibition with evidence of ablation of pAKT with the
combination of drugs but not with either alone, implying true
synergy. Previous studies have identified that multiple RTK's are
active in MPM (14), and this has provided some rationale to
consider combination therapies to overcome innate resistance to
targeted therapies. It is also interesting to speculate as to whether
IGF1R plus Pi3K inhibition would be of use in acquired resistance
to FGFR inhibitors.
Conclusion
High-throughput drug screening revealed a subset of both
immortalized and primary mesothelioma cell lines to be highly
sensitive to FGFR inhibition. This sensitivity was mediated
through FGFR3 and was associated with loss of BAP1 protein
expression. The high incidence of BAP1 protein loss in MPM
tumors implies potential benefit from FGFR inhibition for
a substantial subset of this patient group. In addition, our
anchor-based screens revealed synergistic combinations that
helped to overcome innate resistance to FGFR inhibition.
