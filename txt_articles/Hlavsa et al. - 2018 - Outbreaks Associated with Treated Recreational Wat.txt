Outbreaks associated with exposure to treated recreational 
water can be caused by pathogens or chemicals in venues such 
as pools, hot tubs/spas, and interactive water play venues (i.e., 
water playgrounds). During 2000–2014, public health officials 
from 46 states and Puerto Rico reported 493 outbreaks associated 
with treated recreational water. These outbreaks resulted in at 
least 27,219 cases and eight deaths. Among the 363 outbreaks 
with a confirmed infectious etiology, 212 (58%) were caused by 
Cryptosporidium (which causes predominantly gastrointestinal 
illness), 57 (16%) by Legionella (which causes Legionnaires’ 
disease, a severe pneumonia, and Pontiac fever, a milder illness 
with flu-like symptoms), and 47 (13%) by Pseudomonas (which 
causes folliculitis [“hot tub rash”] and otitis externa [“swimmers’ 
ear”]). Investigations of the 363 outbreaks identified 24,453 
cases; 21,766 (89%) were caused by Cryptosporidium, 920 (4%) 
by Pseudomonas, and 624 (3%) by Legionella. At least six of the 
eight reported deaths occurred in persons affected by outbreaks 
caused by Legionella. Hotels were the leading setting, associated 
with 157 (32%) of the 493 outbreaks. Overall, the outbreaks had 
a bimodal temporal distribution: 275 (56%) outbreaks started 
during June–August and 46 (9%) in March. Assessment of trends 
in the annual counts of outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium, 
Legionella, or Pseudomonas indicate mixed progress in preventing 
transmission. Pathogens able to evade chlorine inactivation have 
become leading outbreak etiologies. The consequent outbreak 
and case counts and mortality underscore the utility of CDC’s 
Model Aquatic Health Code (https://www.cdc.gov/mahc) to 
prevent outbreaks associated with treated recreational water.
An outbreak associated with recreational water is the occurrence 
of similar illnesses in two or more persons, epidemiologically 
linked by location and time of exposure to recreational water or 
to pathogens or chemicals aerosolized or volatilized from recre-
ational water into the surrounding air. Public health officials in 
the 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Freely 
Associated States* voluntarily report outbreaks associated with 
recreational water to CDC. This report focuses on data in two 
groups of outbreaks associated with treated recreational water: 
1) those that started during 2000–2012 and were previously sum-
marized (1) and 2) those that started during 2013–2014 and were

electronically reported to the Waterborne Disease and Outbreak 
Surveillance System (WBDOSS)† by December 31, 2015 (https://
www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveillance/rec-water-tables-figures.
html). Data on each outbreak included case count,§ number of 
deaths, etiology, setting (e.g., hotel) and venue (e.g., pool, hot tub/
spa) where the exposure occurred, and earliest illness onset date. 
Poisson regression analysis was conducted to assess the trend in the 
annual counts of outbreaks, except when overdispersion required 
the use of negative binomial regression analysis.
During 2000–2014, public health officials from 46 states and 
Puerto Rico reported 493 outbreaks associated with treated recre-
ational water, which resulted in at least 27,219 cases (Table) and 
eight deaths. Etiology was confirmed for 385 (78%) outbreaks. 
Among these, 363 (94%) were caused by pathogens (including 
four caused by both Cryptosporidium and Giardia) and resulted 
in at least 24,453 cases. Twenty-two (6%) outbreaks were caused 
by chemicals and resulted in at least 1,028 cases. Among the 
363 outbreaks with a confirmed infectious etiology, 212 (58%) 
were caused by Cryptosporidium, 57 (16%) by Legionella, and 
47 (13%) by Pseudomonas. Of the 24,453 cases, 21,766 (89%) 
were caused by Cryptosporidium, 920 (4%) by Pseudomonas, 
and 624 (3%) by Legionella. Of the 212 outbreaks caused by 
Cryptosporidium, 24 (11%) each affected >100 persons; four of 
these outbreaks each affected ≥2,000 persons. At least six of the 
eight deaths,¶ which all occurred after 2004, were in persons 
affected by outbreaks caused by Legionella.
Hotels** (i.e., hotels, motels, lodges, or inns) were the leading 
setting associated with 157 (32%) of the 493 outbreaks. Of 
 † 2013–2014 were the last years for which finalized data were available. For 
more information on WBDOSS, visit https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/
surveillance/index.html; outbreaks resulting from recreational water exposures 
on cruise ships are not reported to WBDOSS.
 § Based on the estimated number of primary cases. For outbreaks that started before 
2009, if both the actual and estimated case counts were reported, the estimated 
case count was used if the population was sampled randomly or the estimated 
count was calculated by applying the attack rate to a standardized population.
 ¶ The two remaining deaths were in persons affected by an outbreak caused by 
an etiology that was unidentified but suspected to be Legionella.
 
** Other settings: community/municipality/public park (115 [23%] outbreaks), 
club/recreational facility (68 [14%]), waterpark (54 [11%]), private residence 
(31 [6%]), subdivision/neighborhood (21 [4%]), school/college/university 
(14 [3%]), unidentified (13 [3%]), camp/cabin setting (nine [2%]), child 
care/daycare center/day camp (six [1%]), health care facility (three [1%]), and 
other (two [0%]). Categories were not consistently used or defined over the 
study period.

the 157 hotel-related outbreaks, 94 (60%)†† had a confirmed 
infectious etiology, 40 (43%) were caused by Pseudomonas, 
29 (31%) by Legionella, and 17 (18%) by Cryptosporidium.§§ 
Sixty-five (41%) hotel-related outbreaks were associated with 
hot tubs/spas, and 47 (30%) started during February–March. 
Among all 493 outbreaks, a bimodal temporal distribution 
was observed. The 275 (56%) outbreaks that started during 
June–August were predominantly caused by Cryptosporidium, 
whereas the 46 (9%) that started in March were predominantly 
caused by an unidentified etiology or pathogens other than 
Cryptosporidium (Figure 1). Negative binomial regression 
analysis indicated that during 2000–2007, the annual number 
of outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium increased by an aver-
age of 25% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7%–45%) per 
year (Figure 2). No significant trend was found after 2007.¶¶ 
Poisson regression analysis indicated that during 2000–2014 
the annual number of outbreaks caused by Legionella increased 
by an average of 13% (95% CI = 6%–21%) per year, and the 
annual number of Pseudomonas folliculitis outbreaks (a total 
of 41 outbreaks during 2000–2014) decreased by an average 
of 22% (95% CI = 14%–29%) per year.***
Discussion
Approximately 500 outbreaks associated with treated recre-
ational water occurred in the United States during 2000–2014. 
The most frequently reported outbreak setting was hotels. 
Approximately half of the outbreaks started during June–
August, followed by a smaller peak in March. The second peak 
might reflect swimming’s transition from an only-summertime 
to a year-round activity, as the relative number of indoor ver-
sus outdoor treated recreational water venues increases. The 
aquatics sector and public health can voluntarily adopt CDC’s 
Model Aquatic Health Code to improve the design, construc-
tion, operation, and maintenance of public (nonbackyard) 
treated recreational water venues to prevent illness and injury.
 †† Approximately half (60 [56%]) of the 108 outbreaks with an unidentified etiology 
were associated with the hotel setting. Among the 60 outbreaks, 23 (38%) started 
during March–April; 41 (68%) were outbreaks of skin-related illness.
 §§ The remaining eight outbreaks were caused by norovirus (five [5%] 
outbreaks), Bacillus (one [1%]), nontuberculous mycobacterium (one [1%]), 
and Staphylococcus (one [1%]).
 ¶¶ The 2007 number of outbreaks associated with treated recreational water 
and caused by Cryptosporidium (40), and thus, of outbreaks overall might 
be outliers. For 2007, Utah reported a statewide outbreak primarily associated 
with treated recreational water and caused by Cryptosporidium; neighboring 
states reported additional outbreaks associated with recreational water and 
caused by Cryptosporidium. All of these individual outbreaks might have 
been a single multistate outbreak. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/
mmwrhtml/ss6012a1.htm.
 *** Because of concerns that folliculitis might not be cultured, which means the 
etiology cannot be identified, a Poisson regression analysis was conducted 
to assess the annual number of outbreaks of skin-related illness caused by 
Pseudomonas or an unidentified etiology. The annual number of outbreaks 
decreased by 5% (95% CI = 1%–9%).

* Not applicable because only one outbreak was nationally reported for that etiology. 
 ††† At water pH ≤7.5 and temperature ≥77°F (25°C).
Chlorine is the primary barrier to the transmission of patho-
gens in treated recreational water. At CDC-recommended 
concentrations of at least 1 ppm,††† free available chlorine 
inactivates most pathogens within minutes although extremely 
chlorine-tolerant Cryptosporidium can survive for >7 days (2,3). 
Cryptosporidium is transmitted when a diarrheal incident (i.e., 
a high-risk Cryptosporidium contamination event) occurs in the 
water and the contaminated water is ingested. The parasite’s 
extreme chlorine tolerance enables it to persist in water, cause 
outbreaks that sicken thousands, and spread to multiple rec-
reational water venues and other settings (e.g., child care set-
tings). Rates of individual cases caused by Cryptosporidium peak 
in the summer, coinciding with the summer swim season (4).
In contrast, Legionella and Pseudomonas are effectively 
controlled by halogens (e.g., chlorine and bromine) in well-
maintained treated venues. However, because these pathogens 
can persist in biofilm (where microbial cells inhabit a primarily 
polysaccharide matrix, the cells cannot be removed from a surface 
by gentle rinsing) (5), and they are protected from inactivation 
and amplify when disinfectant concentrations are not properly

maintained. Approximately 20% of 13,864 routine inspections 
of public hot tubs/spas conducted in 16 jurisdictions in 2013 
identified improper disinfectant concentrations (6). Legionella 
is typically transmitted when aerosolized water droplets (e.g., 
produced by hot tub/spa jets) containing this bacterium are 
inhaled, whereas Pseudomonas is transmitted when skin comes 
in contact with contaminated water. Multiple factors contribute 
to Legionella and Pseudomonas growth in hot tubs/spas, includ-
ing inadequate disinfectant concentration; warm (77°F–108°F 
[25°C–42°C]) water temperatures (which facilitate pathogen 
amplification and make it difficult to maintain adequate disin-
fectant concentration); water aeration (which depletes halogens); 
and the presence of biofilm on wet venue surfaces, scale, and sedi-
ment (7). The increasing annual rate of Legionnaires’ disease cases 
(286% during 2000–2014) (8), and possibly, the significantly 
increasing annual number of outbreaks caused by Legionella, 
might be associated with increasing size of susceptible populations 
(persons aged ≥50 years or those with chronic disease [particularly 
chronic lung disease] or who are immunocompromised; current 
or former smokers; or cancer patients), and increased Legionella 
growth in the environment, as well as increased awareness of the 
disease with improved testing and reporting (8). The significantly 
decreasing number of annual Pseudomonas folliculitis outbreaks 
might reflect an actual decrease or possibly focusing on hot tub/
spa remediation to prevent further transmission rather than 
outbreak investigation and reporting.
If a diarrheal incident occurs in treated recreational water or an 
outbreak at least suspected to be caused by Cryptosporidium occurs, 
CDC recommends hyperchlorination, i.e., chlorinating water to 
achieve 3-log10 (99.9%) Cryptosporidium inactivation§§§ (https://
www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/aquatics-professionals/fec-
alresponse.html). Alternatively, ultraviolet light or ozone systems 
can be added to inactivate Cryptosporidium, particularly in venues 
at increased risk for contamination (e.g., those intended for chil-
dren aged <5 years, who might have limited or no toileting skills). 
As in any public setting, treated venues in the hotel setting should 
be operated and maintained by a trained operator or responsible 
supervisor.¶¶¶ These and other recommendations can be found in 
CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code. CDC also provides specific 
recommendations for disinfecting hot tubs/spas contaminated 
with Legionella (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/downloads/
hot-tub-disinfection.pdf). Investigations of Legionnaires’ disease 
outbreaks indicate that effective water management programs for 
buildings and treated recreational water venues (e.g., hot tubs/
spas) at increased risk for Legionella growth and transmission can 
reduce the risk for Legionnaires’ disease (8,9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, the outbreak counts presented likely underestimate 
 §§§ At water pH ≤7.5 and temperature ≥77°F (25°C), 3-log10 Cryptosporidium 
inactivation can be achieved in the absence of cyanuric acid (which prevents 
chlorine degradation by the sun’s ultraviolet light but substantially delays 
pathogen inactivation) by maintaining free available chlorine at 20 ppm for 
12.75 hours and in the presence of 1–15 ppm cyanuric acid by maintaining 
free available chlorine at 20 ppm for 28 hours.
 ¶¶¶ Trained operators are those who have successfully completed an approved 
operator training course; responsible supervisors are those who can conduct 
and record results of water quality testing, properly maintain water quality, 
perform general maintenance procedures, and identify when to close venues 
to protect public health.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Outbreaks associated with treated recreational water can be 
caused by pathogens or chemicals.
What is added by this report?
During 2000–2014, 493 outbreaks associated with treated 
recreational water caused at least 27,219 cases and eight 
deaths. Outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium increased 25% 
per year during 2000–2006; however, no significant trend 
occurred after 2007. The number of outbreaks caused by 
Legionella increased 14% per year.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The aquatics sector, public health officials, bathers, and parents 
of young bathers can take steps to minimize risk for outbreaks. 
The halting of the increase in outbreaks caused by 
Cryptosporidium might be attributable to Healthy and Safe 
Swimming Week campaigns.
the actual incidence, in part because of variation in public health 
capacity and reporting requirements across jurisdictions. Second, 
reporting and review procedures (e.g., increased completeness 
of data on outbreaks caused by Legionella) changed over time, 
which affects the ability to compare data across years.
Addressing the challenges presented by chlorine-tolerant and 
biofilm-associated pathogens require sustained attention to 
improving design, construction, operation, and management of 
public treated recreational water venues. This includes educating 
the public. Preventing Cryptosporidium contamination is criti-
cal to preventing transmission. Thus, the key message to the 
public, particularly parents of young bathers, is “Don’t swim or 
let your kids swim if sick with diarrhea.” Preventing transmis-
sion of Legionella, Pseudomonas, and other chlorine-susceptible 
pathogens means educating bathers and parents of young bath-
ers to check the inspection scores of public treated recreational 
water venues and conduct their own mini-inspection before 
getting into the water (e.g., measure bromine or free chlorine 
level and pH with test strips, which can be purchased at pool 
supply, hardware, and big-box stores). Potential hot tub/spa users 
should know whether they are at increased risk for Legionnaires’ 
disease, so they can choose to avoid hot tubs/spas, as indicated 
(https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/downloads/fs-legionnaires.
pdf). The halting of the substantial increase in annual numbers 
of outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium might, at least in part, be 
because of local, state, and federal Healthy and Safe Swimming 
Week (the week before Memorial Day) campaigns (10). Thus, 
the focus of these campaigns could regularly be expanded beyond 
preventing Cryptosporidium transmission in an effort to prevent 
other recreational water outbreaks.
