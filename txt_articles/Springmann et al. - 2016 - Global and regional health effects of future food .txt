Abstract 
 
Background: One of the most important consequences of climate change could be its impact 
on agriculture. While much research has focused on questions of food security, less attention 
has been devoted to assessing the wider health impacts of future changes in agricultural 
production. We estimate excess mortality due to agriculturally mediated changes in dietary 
and weight-related risk factors by cause of death for 155 world regions in the year 2050. 
 
Methods: We linked a detailed agricultural modelling framework, the International Model for 
Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), to a comparative risk 
assessment of changes in fruit and vegetable consumption, red-meat consumption, and body 
weight for deaths from coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and an aggregate of other 
causes. We calculated the change in the number of deaths due to climate-related changes in 
weight and diets for the combination of four emissions and three socio-economic pathways, 
which each included six scenarios with variable climatic inputs.  
 
Findings: The model projects that by 2050 climate change will lead to per-capita reductions 
of 3.2% (± 0.4%), 4.0% (± 0.7%), and 0.7% (± 0.1) in global food availability, fruit and 
vegetable consumption, and red-meat consumption, respectively. Those changes were 
associated with 529,000 climate-related deaths globally (95% confidence interval (CI): 
314,000-736,000), representing a 28% (95% CI: 26-33%) reduction in the number of deaths 
that would be avoided due to changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors between 2010 
and 2050. Twice as many climate-related deaths were associated with reductions in fruit and 
vegetable consumption than with climate-related increases in the prevalence of underweight, 
and most climate-related deaths were projected to occur in South and East Asia. Adopting 
climate-stabilization pathways reduced the number of climate-related deaths by 29-71% 
depending on their stringency.  
 
Interpretation: The health impacts of climate change from changes in dietary and weight-
related risk factors could be significant, and exceed other climate-related health impacts that 
have been estimated. Climate change mitigation could prevent a substantial number of 
climate-related deaths. Strengthening public-health programmes aimed at preventing and 
treating diet and weight-related risk factors could be a suitable climate change adaptation 
strategy.

Introduction 
 
Climate change has been described as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.1 
Health can be affected by climate change in various ways: directly, due to changes in 
temperature, precipitation, and the occurrence of heat waves, floods, droughts, and fires; or 
indirectly, due to ecological and social disruptions, such as crop failures, shifting patterns of 
disease vectors, and displacement of people.2 The impacts on the food supply and food 
security may be one of the most important consequences of climate change due to the large 
number of people that may be affected.2–4 Climate change impacts are expected to reduce the 
quantity of food harvested,5 which could lead to higher food prices and reduced 
consumption,6 and to an increase in the number of malnourished people.7,8  
 
However, the relationship between agriculture and health goes beyond issues of food security 
and caloric availability.9–11 Agricultural production and regional food availability also 
influence the composition of diets, which can have major importance for health.12 The Global 
Burden of Disease study found that in 2010, the greatest number of deaths, worldwide and in 
most regions including developing countries, was attributable to dietary risk factors associated 
with imbalanced diets, such as those low in fruits and vegetables and high in red and 
processed meat.13 In comparison, about ten percent more disability-adjusted life-years and 
seven times more deaths were attributed to dietary risk factors than to the common food 
security indicator of child and maternal undernutrition, up from ratios of one half and two, 
respectively, in 1990.13 The growing importance of dietary risk factors reflects a general trend 
away from communicable diseases associated with undernutrition and poor sanitation to non-
communicable diseases associated with high body weight and unbalanced diets.14  
 
Here we present a first quantitative analysis of the global health implications of such dietary 
and weight changes in light of climate change and agricultural production. We estimate the 
impacts of climate change on dietary and weight-related health risks and associated cause-
specific mortalities for 155 world regions in the year 2050.  
 
 
Methods 
 
The way future climate change impacts health via changes in food consumption and dietary 
and weight-related risk factors can be conceptualised as follows. Future food production and 
consumption is expected to increase, driven by population and income growth and mediated 
by market responses, such as changes in prices and management practices.33,34 Relative to 
that, climate change leads to changes in temperature and precipitation, which is expected to 
reduce global crop productivity,5,15 and via market responses, lead to changes in management 
intensity, cropping area, consumption, and international trade.6 From a health perspective, 
changes in food availability and consumption affect dietary and weigh-related risk factors 
associated with an increased incidence of non-communicable diseases and mortality, such as 
low fruit and vegetable consumption,16–18 high red meat consumption,18–20 and increased body 
weight.21,22 
 4 
 
 
In line with the conceptual framework, we devised a multi-step methodology, depicted in 
Figure 1, which leads from climate-change impacts on agricultural yields, through changes in 
food production and consumption, to changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors and 
associated mortalities. For that purpose, we linked a detailed agricultural modelling 
framework to a comparative risk assessment of dietary and weight-related risk factors for 
cardiovascular diseases and cancer.  
 
Agricultural modelling framework 
 
The agricultural modelling framework relied on the International Model for Policy Analysis 
of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) which uses economic, water, and crop 
models to simulate global food production, consumption, and trade of 62 agricultural 
commodities for 159 world regions. A detailed description of the IMPACT model is provided 
in Appendix A1 and elsewhere.23,24 We used the IMPACT model to produce global food 
scenarios for the year 2050. Building on methods developed by the Agricultural Model 
Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP),6 we analysed the range of potential 
climate impacts by comparing a reference “middle-of-the-road” development scenario without 
climate-change impacts to scenarios with high climate-change impacts. Panel 1 discusses the 
socio-economic and emissions pathways adopted, and Appendix A2 provides additional detail 
on the model inputs used for constructing the model scenarios.  
 
The IMPACT model estimates commodity-specific food availability at the country level, 
which we used in a comparative risk assessment to analyse changes in the exposure of dietary 
and weight-related risks. For the dietary risk assessment, we converted the food availability 
estimates for fruit and vegetables and for red meat into food consumption estimates by using 
regional data on food wastage at the consumption level, combined with conversion factors 
into edible matter (see Appendix A3).25 For the weight-related risk assessment, we estimated 
changes in weight as shifts in the baseline weight distribution by using the historical 
relationship between national food availability and mean body mass index (BMI). We 
estimated the baseline distribution by fitting a log-normal distribution to estimates from the 
World Health Organization (WHO) of mean BMI and the prevalence of overweight and 
obesity using a cross-entropy method,26 which jointly minimizes the deviation of the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity for each mean BMI estimate (see Appendix A4). We 
derived the shifts in the weight distribution related to changes in food availability by pairing 
food availability data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO) for the years 1980-2009 with WHO data on mean BMI for the same period, using a 
polynomial trend to describe their relationship (R2 = 0·46; p < 0.001) (see Appendix A4). 
 
Health modelling framework 
 
We analysed the health impacts associated with changes in food consumption by using a 
comparative risk assessment framework with four disease states and six diet and weight-
related risk factors. The disease states included coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cancer 
 5 
 
(which is an aggregate of site-specific cancers), and an aggregate for all other causes. The 
three specific disease states accounted for about 60% of deaths from non-communicable 
diseases and for about 40% of deaths globally in 2010.14 The weight-related risk factors 
corresponded to the four weight classes of underweight (BMI<18·5), normal weight 
(18·5<BMI<25), overweight (25<BMI<30), and obesity (BMI>30), and the diet-related risk 
factors included fruit and vegetable consumption and red meat consumption which, together, 
accounted for more than half of all deaths that were attributable to diet-related risks in 2010.13 
The dietary and weight-related risk factors included in this study accounted for 18% of all 
deaths in 2010 and for 33% of deaths attributed to specific causes.13  
 
We estimated the mortality and disease burden attributable to dietary and weight-related risk 
factors by calculating population attributable fractions (PAFs). PAFs represent the proportions 
of disease cases that would be avoided when the risk exposure was changed from a baseline 
situation (the reference scenario without climate change) to a counterfactual situation (the 
climate change scenarios). For calculating PAFs, we used the general formula:13,27 
 
 
𝑃𝐴𝐹 = ∫ 𝑅𝑅(𝑥)𝑃(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 − ∫ 𝑅𝑅(𝑥)𝑃′(𝑥)𝑑𝑥
∫ 𝑅𝑅(𝑥)𝑃(𝑥)𝑑𝑥
 
(1) 
 
where 𝑅𝑅(𝑥) is the relative risk of disease for risk factor level 𝑥, 𝑃(𝑥) is the number of 
people in the population with risk factor level 𝑥 in the baseline scenario, and 𝑃′(𝑥) is the 
number of people in the population with risk factor level 𝑥 in the counterfactual scenario (see 
Appendix A5 for a detailed description). We assumed that changes in relative risks follow a 
dose-response relationship,13,28 and that PAFs combine multiplicatively,13,29 i.e. 𝑃𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑂𝑇 =
1 − ∏ (1 − 𝑃𝐴𝐹
𝑖)
𝑖
 where the i’s denote independent risk factors.  
 
We used publically available data sources to parameterize the comparative risk analysis. 
Population and mortality data by region and 5-year age group for the year 2050 were adopted 
from IIASA and the United Nations Population Division, respectively. All-cause mortality 
rates for 2050 were decomposed into cause-specific ones for CHD, stroke, an aggregate of 
cancers, and an aggregate of all other causes by using burden of disease estimates for WHO 
member states in 2008, projected forward to 2050 for the dietary and weight-related risk 
factors focussed on here. Given that dietary and weight-related risk factors are predominantly 
associated with chronic, non-communicable disease mortality, we focused on the health 
implications of changes in those risk factors for adults (aged 20 and older). We restricted the 
selection of relative risk parameters to meta-analyses and pooled prospective cohort studies 
(see Appendix A6). The diet and weight-related relative risk parameters were adopted from 
pooled analyses of prospective cohort studies,21,22 and from meta-analysis of prospective 
cohort and case-control studies.19,20,16–18 The cancer associations have been judged as 
probable or convincing by the World Cancer Research Fund, and in each case a dose-response 
relationship was apparent and consistent evidence suggests plausible mechanisms.18

Uncertainty analysis 
 
We undertook a comprehensive set of sensitivity analyses to quantify the main uncertainties 
associated with each model component, including climatic, socio-economic, and 
epidemiological uncertainties (Table A2.1 in Appendix A2). We quantified the climatic 
uncertainties associated with each socio-economic and emissions pathway by calculating the 
mean and standard deviation of six climate scenarios which represented the cross-section of 
three general circulation models and two crop models. For each climate scenario, we 
quantified the epidemiological uncertainties by calculating uncertainty intervals based on 
1,000 iterations of a Monte Carlo analysis which randomly drew the relative risk parameters 
from their log-normal distributions. In a sensitivity analysis, we analysed the uncertainty 
associated with socio-economic development and emissions pathways by considering twelve 
combinations of three different socio-economic pathways and four different emissions 
pathways, which forms the complete set of common pathways developed by the climate 
change research community (Panel 1).

Results 
 
Food availability and consumption 
 
Table 1 lists global and regional food availability and consumption in the baseline of 2010, 
for the reference scenario without climate change in 2050, and for the mean of the main 
climate change scenarios in 2050. Without climate change, the agriculture-economic model 
projects an increase in global food availability of 289 kilocalories per person per day 
(kcal/cap/day) between the years 2010 and 2050 (10·3%); global fruit and vegetable 
consumption, net of food waste, is projected to increase by 35·8 grams per person per day 
(g/cap/day), and global red meat consumption, net of food waste, to increase by 3·9 
g/cap/day. Consumption changes in terms of million tonnes per year are larger, agree with the 
current range of projections,30 and are reported in Appendix A8.  
 
In line with previous estimates,6,30 the agriculture-economic model projects that climate 
change will lead to reduced food availability, which mitigates the increases in food 
availability that are projected to occur between 2010 and 2050. The model scenarios with 
climate change project a relative reduction of global food availability, fruit and vegetable 
consumption, and red meat consumption in 2050 by 99 kcal/cap/day (3·2%; standard 
deviation of climate change scenarios (CC SD): 11 kcal/cap/day, 0.4%), 15·0 g/cap/day 
 7 
 
(4·0%; CC SD: 2.7 g/cap/day, 0.7%), and 0·5 g/cap/day (0·7%; CC SD: 0.1 g/cap/day, 0.1%), 
respectively, when compared to the 2050 reference scenario without climate change. 
Consumption changes for other food items are reported in Appendix A8.  
 
The climatic impacts on food availability and consumption were subject to large regional 
variation. Regional food availability was reduced above average in the low and middle-
income countries of Africa (122 kcal/day (4·2%); CC SD: 13 kcal/day), South-East Asia (116 
kcal/day (4·1%); CC SD: 13 kcal/day) and the Western-Pacific (111 kcal/day (3·2%); CC SD: 
16 kcal/day); regional fruit and vegetable consumption was reduced above average in the low 
and middle-income countries of the Western Pacific (23·0 g/cap/day (3.8%); CC SD: 4·3 
g/cap/day) and in high-income countries (15·4 g/cap/day (3·9%); CC SD: 2·7 g/cap/day); and 
regional red-meat consumption was reduced above average in high-income countries (1·1 
g/cap/day (0·7%); CC SD: 0·2 g/cap/day), and in the low and middle-income countries of 
America (0·9 g/cap/day (0·9%); CC SD: 0·1 g/cap/day), the Western Pacific (0·6 g/cap/day 
(0·5%); CC SD: 0·1 g/cap/day), and Europe (0·6 g/cap/day (0·8%); CC SD: 0·1 g/cap/day). 
Country-level results are listed in Tables A8.3-A8.5 in Appendix A8.  
 
Health impacts 
 
Table A9.1 in Appendix A9 lists the health impacts associated with the changes in food 
availability and consumption for the future consumption scenarios with and without climate 
change. The basis for comparison is a baseline with 2010 levels of food consumption and 
weight levels, but with all-cause death rates and population structures of 2050. Adopting this 
baseline allowed us to isolate the health impacts of changes in dietary and weight-related risk 
factors between 2010 and 2050 when comparing it to the reference and climate change 
scenarios, and to estimate the impacts of climate change in 2050 by calculating the difference 
between the reference scenario and the climate-change scenarios. The increases in food 
availability and consumption in the reference scenario without climate change resulted in 1·9 
million avoided deaths (95% confidence interval of the relative risk distribution (CI): 0·9-2·8 
million) in 2050 compared to the baseline with 2010-levels of food availability and 
consumption. Climate change reduced the number of avoided deaths by 28% (95% CI: 26-
33%), which lead to 529,000 climate-related deaths (95% confidence interval of the relative 
risk distribution averaged over all climate scenarios: 314,000-736,000; CC SD: 105,000) 
compared to the reference scenario in 2050 (Figure 2). Most climate-related deaths occurred 
in the low and middle-income countries of the Western Pacific (264,000; 95% CI: 178,000-
354,000; CC SD: 53,000) and South-East Asia (164,000; 95% CI: 102,000-216,000; CC SD: 
29,000). 
 
Underlying the changes in the number of deaths are changes in specific risk factors in each 
region. Figure 2 shows the individual contribution of the specific risk factors. Globally, the 
greatest contributor to the climate-related deaths were changes in dietary risk factors. The 
negative health impacts associated with reductions in fruit and vegetable consumption led to 
534,000 climate-related deaths (95% CI: 365,000-699,000; CC SD: 100,000), which far 
outweighed the health benefits associated with reductions in red meat consumption (29,000 
 8 
 
avoided deaths; 95% CI: 27,000-32,000; CC SD: 4,000). Weight-related changes in the 
number of deaths were balanced globally. Lower caloric availability due to climate change 
increased the total number of underweight people, which led to 266,000 additional deaths 
(95% CI: 203,000-329,000; CC SD: 32,000), but it also reduced the number of overweight 
and obese people, which led to 35,000 avoided deaths (95% CI: -13,000-84,000; CC SD: 
5,000) and 225,000 avoided deaths (95% CI: 198,000-254,000; CC SD: 26,000), respectively. 
Figure A9.1 in Appendix A9 details the associated causes of death. 
 
The climate-related changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors vary greatly by region 
and income group (Figure 2). Corresponding to the changes in food availability and 
consumption (Table 1), changes in fruit and vegetable consumption were the primary risk 
factor for climate-related death in high-income countries (accounting for 58% of all changes 
in deaths; 95% CI: 49-64%) and in the low and middle-income countries of the Western 
Pacific (74%; 95% CI: 65-79%), Europe (60%; 95% CI: 46-69%), and the Eastern 
Mediterranean (42%; 95% CI: 29-51%). Changes in the prevalence of underweight were the 
primary risk factor in the low and middle-income countries of Africa (49%; 95% CI: 40-53%) 
and South-East Asia (47%; 95% CI: 39-51%), where the additional deaths due to more 
underweight exceeded the deaths avoided due to less overweight and obesity. Changes in the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity were the primary risk factors in the low and middle-
income countries of America (44%; 95% CI: 35-55%), and the deaths avoided due to less 
overweight and obesity exceeded the additional deaths due to more underweight in several 
other regions, such as high-income countries (23-29% versus 6-12%) and in the low and 
middle-income countries of the Eastern Mediterranean (27-53% versus 16-20%), Europe (22-
42% versus 1-3%), and partly the Western Pacific (6-23% versus 8-11%).  
 
Figure 3 provides an overview of the climate-related deaths by country on a per-capita basis. 
Most countries (118 out of 155) experienced a climate-related increase in the number of 
deaths (Figure 3, upper panel, red shading), in particular in the Western Pacific and in South-
East Asia. A high number of climate-related deaths per capita occurred in China (231 per 
million; 95% CI: 157-308 per million; CC SD: 47 per million) and India (105 per million; 
95% CI: 68-136 per million; CC SD: 19 per million), the two countries with the highest 
number of absolute deaths (Table A9.2 in Appendix A9), but also in Vietnam (126 per 
million; 95% CI: 78-168 per million; CC SD: 23 per million), Greece (124 per million; 95% 
CI: 77-167 per million; CC SD: 26 per million), and South Korea (119 per million; 95% CI: 
84-148 per million; CC SD: 25 per million) (Table A9.3 in Appendix A9). A smaller number 
of countries (37 out of 155) experienced a climate-related decrease in the number deaths 
(Figure 3, upper panel, green shading), in particular in Central and South America, the 
Eastern Mediterranean, and parts of Africa. In those regions, the changes in weight-related 
deaths exceeded the changes in consumption-related deaths (66 out of 155 countries) (Figure 
3, middle panel), and the number of avoided deaths due to reductions in overweight and 
obesity exceeded the number of deaths related to increases in underweight (119 out of 155 
countries) (Figure 3, lower panel). The total number of avoided deaths amounted to five 
thousand, which is less than one percent of all positive and negative changes in the number of 
 9 
 
climate-related deaths. Tables A9.3-A9.6 in Appendix 9 contain additional results by country 
in absolute and per-capita terms and by risk factor. 
 
Sensitivity analysis 
 
The magnitude of climate change impacts depends, among others, on assumptions about 
future emissions trajectories and socio-economic development. The main results were based 
on a “middle-of-the-road” development scenario, and compared a scenario without climate 
change to scenarios which follow a high emissions pathway. Table 2 lists the changes in diet 
and weight-related mortality for different socio-economic and emissions pathways. The 
different pathways are described in Panel 1 and Appendix A2. Compared to the main 
scenario, more ‘sustainable’ development (SSP1) led to more avoided deaths in 2050, and 
more ‘fragmented’ development (SSP3) led to less avoided deaths. However, the number of 
climate-related deaths, i.e. the difference between the reference scenario and the climate 
change scenarios, did not change substantially. For example, the mean and standard deviation 
(SSP SD) of climate-related deaths in all socio-economic pathways for the high emissions 
pathway (RCP8·5) was 552,000 and 27,000, respectively. In contrast, the number of climate-
related deaths was substantially reduced when lower emissions pathways were adopted. 
Compared to the highest emissions pathway (RCP8·5), the number of climate-related deaths 
were reduced by 29% (SSP SD: 3%) and 32% (SSP SD: 2%) to 390,000 (SSP SD: 34,000) 
and 376,000 (SSP SD: 31,000) in two medium climate-stabilization scenarios (RCP6·0, 
RCP4·5), and by 71% (SSP SD: 1%) to 158,000 (SSP SD: 11,000) in a stringent climate-
stabilization scenario (RCP2·6).  
  
 
 
Discussion 
 
Climate change leads to changes in temperature and precipitation which are expected to 
reduce global crop productivity,5,15 lead to changes in food production and consumption,6 and 
impact health by altering the composition of diets and, with it, the profile of dietary and 
weight-related risk factors and associated mortalities.13 The results of this study indicate that 
even relative modest reductions in per-capita food availability could lead to changes in the 
energy content and composition of diets that are associated with significant, negative health 
implications. Whilst food availability and consumption is projected to be higher in 2050 than 
in 2010, we found that by 2050, climate change could lead to relative reductions of 3.2% (± 
0.4%), 4.0% (± 0.7%), and 0.7% (± 0.1) in global food availability, fruit and vegetable 
consumption, and red meat consumption, respectively, compared to a projection without 
climate change. Based on the modelling exercise, those changes could lead to 529,000 
climate-related deaths globally (95% CI: 314,000-736,000) due to changes in dietary and 
weight-related risk factors among the adult populations of 155 world regions.   
 
The estimate of climate-related deaths represents a significant reduction in the progress 
towards greater food and nutrition security that is projected to occur until 2050. In our model 
projections, it amounts to a 28% (95% CI: 26-33%) reduction in the number of deaths that are 
 10 
 
avoided due to changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors between 2010 and 2050, and 
it far exceeds other climate-related health impacts that are projected to occur in 2050 (Panel 2 
and Appendix A10). The sensitivity analysis indicated that climate change mitigation could 
substantially reduce the number of climate-related deaths. However, a negative net impact 
would remain even in a stringent climate-stabilization pathway which incorporates negative 
emissions.  
 
Strengthening public-health programmes aimed at preventing and treating diet and weight-
related risk factors could be a suitable climate change adaptation strategy aimed at reducing 
climate-related health impacts. We found that health impacts were highly differentiated by 
region and risk factors. Twice as many climate-related deaths were associated with changes in 
dietary risk factors, in particular with reductions in fruit and vegetable consumption, than with 
climate-related increases in the prevalence of underweight; and most climate-related deaths 
were projected to occur in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific, in particular in China and 
India. Health-related adaptation programmes should be region-specific and take into account 
both the scale and the composition of climate-sensitive risk factors (Panel 2). 
 
Although we found that our overall estimate is robust with respect to changes in climatic, 
biophysical, socio-economic, and epidemiological parameters, several caveats apply. First, 
there is general agreement about the negative impacts that climate change is expected to have 
on major staple crops, in particular at low latitudes and at high levels of warming.5 However, 
the impacts that climatic changes could have on crops that are relatively less important based 
on their land coverage and production, but of increased importance for health, such as fruits 
and vegetables, would greatly benefit from further research. The current state of global crop 
modelling allowed us to directly model climate change effects on most major crops, such as 
groundnuts, maize, potatoes, rice, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat,5,15 but the impacts on other 
crops had to be inferred from biophysical similarities.6,15   
 
Second, the economic responses of agricultural commodity markets to climatic shocks are 
subject to high uncertainty. A recent comparison of global economic models of agriculture 
showed a wide range of projections of production and consumption across models.6,30 We 
used the harmonized scenario inputs developed for the comparison, and we adopted an 
economic model whose demand projections fell within the middle two quartiles of the range 
of model results.30 This means that our economic analysis represents average economic 
impacts without economic uncertainty intervals. Adopting a suite of economic models would 
have allowed us to quantify the uncertainties related to projections of food demand. However, 
generating custom results with the IMPACT model as input for our health analysis allowed 
for greater regional detail and crop differentiation, and for more sensitivity analyses than 
would have been possible if we had relied on the necessarily more aggregated results from a 
model intercomparison or suite of models. Future economic model intercomparisons with 
greater regional and commodity-level aggregation are highly encouraged. 
 
Third, a number of caveats apply to the comparative risk analysis framework.28 For our 
analysis of weight-related risk factors, we derived future weight distributions based on the 
 11 
 
historical relationship between mean BMI and food availability. However, the relationship 
between changes in body weight and caloric availability might change in the future if other 
parameters, such as the amount of food waste is not controlled for. Our use of globally 
comparable waste percentages explicitly accounts for absolute changes in the amount of food 
wasted in response to changes in food availability, but it is possible that also the percentage of 
food waste changes.31 We captured this effect indirectly by using a non-linear 
parameterization of the relationship between mean BMI and food availability. Using 
metabolic models of weight change would have been preferable, but current estimates of food 
consumption and waste are too imprecise to apply such models on the global level.10,25,32,33 
 
Final caveats apply to the global databases used for our analysis, such as the food balance 
sheets produced by the FAO, which were used to calibrate the IMPACT model, and the health 
parameters adopted from the Global Health Observatory of the WHO, which were used in the 
health analysis. In producing a coherent global database, both databases have been subject to 
considerable adjustment.10,32 In addition, their country-level aggregation might hide intra-
regional inequalities that, when disaggregated, could increase the spread of results for specific 
regions and globally. For example, it is likely that different groups within a population would 
react differently to price increases, and that relatively food-secure subgroups can compensate 
for changes in food price without substantially changing food consumption (see Appendix 
A11 for a discussion on this point related to our weight estimates). Projections based on 
global databases can therefore best be seen as ballpark estimates of general magnitudes, and 
more detailed regional studies are encouraged to increase the evidence base.  
 
Several factors not included in this analysis could change future estimates of climate-related 
mortality from dietary and weight-related risk factors. We summarize those in Appendix A11. 
They include explicit analyses of climate extremes, climatic impacts on fisheries and 
aquaculture, direct heat and water stress on livestock, climate impacts on the nutritional 
quality of foods, shocks to the food system not presently captured in the socio-economic and 
emissions pathways used, and longer-term analyses of climate impacts. Most of those factors 
can be expected to increase the climate-related health burden estimated in this study.

Panel 1: Future pathways of emissions and socio-economic development 
 
In the lead up to the publication of the Fifth Assessment Report of the International Panel and Climate 
Change (IPCC), the research community developed a set of global scenarios which can be used by 
researchers of various disciplines to analyse the impacts of climate change under different assumption 
underlying the dynamics of the earth system and socio-economic developments.34 A scenario matrix 
architecture was developed which allows researchers to construct climate change scenarios based on 
the combination of representative concentration pathways (RCPs), which describe emissions 
trajectories, and shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs), which describe development trajectories, 
including different approaches/challenges to climate-change mitigation and adaptation.35   
 
For this study’s main scenarios, we adopted a “middle-of-the-road” socioeconomic trajectory (SSP2), 
using GDP projections developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) and population projections developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems 
Analysis (IIASA).36,37 For analysing the sensitivity to different socio-economic pathways, we adopted 
two alternative socio-economic pathways in the sensitivity analysis: a “Sustainability”-termed socio-
economic pathway (SSP1) which is characterized by medium to high economic growth and low 
population growth, and a “Fragmentation”-termed socio-economic pathway (SSP3) which is 
characterized by slow economic growth and high population growth.38 The challenges to mitigation 
and adaptation increase when going from SSP1 to SSP3. Table A2.1 in Appendix A2 provides an 
overview of this study’s model inputs and scenarios, Table A2.2 details the storylines associated with 
each socio-economic pathway, and Table A2.3 lists the associated GDP and population estimates. 
 
In the main climate change scenarios, we adopted the highest emissions pathway (RCP8·5) to scope 
the full range of potential climate change impacts. That pathway leads to an increase in the global 
mean surface air temperature of 2·0 degrees C in 2046-2065 compared to the period 1986-2005.39 For 
analysing the sensitivity to different emissions pathways, we adopted three alternative emissions 
trajectories in the sensitivity analysis: two medium climate-stabilization scenarios (RCP4·5, RCP6), 
and one stringent climate-stabilization scenario (RCP2·6) that is based, in part, on the use of negative 
emissions technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and bio-energy.40 The increases in 
global mean surface air temperature from the period 1986-2005 to 2046-2065 are 1·3 degrees C and 
1·4 degrees C in the medium stabilization scenarios (RCP6·0, RCP4·5), and 1·0 degree C in the 
stringent stabilization scenario (RCP2·6). The changes in precipitation for a given change in 
temperature increase when going from the low emissions scenario to the higher emissions scenarios 
(from RCP2·6 to to RCP8·5).39 
 
Regional projections of the agricultural impacts of climate change are subject to significant 
uncertainty.5 We therefore used different combinations of general circulation models (GCMs), which 
project changes in temperature and precipitation, and crop models, which use those changes to project 
biophysical changes in crop yields, to generate a spread of input parameters for our agriculture and 
health assessment. The GCMs include HadGEM2-ES,41 IPSL-CM5A-LR,42 and MIROC-ESM-
CHEM;43 and the crop models include DSSAT and LPJmL.44,45 The pair-wise combination of GCMs 
with crop models resulted in six climate change scenarios for each socio-economic and emissions 
pathway. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of the scenario endpoints (changes in food 
 16 
 
availability and consumption, and changes in mortality) that are associated with the different climate 
change scenarios, and we report those in the main text to simplify exposition.  
 
 
Panel 2: Research in context 
 
Systematic review: 
 
Previous studies of the health impacts of climate change have either analysed complementary causes 
of death, or focused on the impacts of climate change on agriculture and health in terms of changes in 
food security and caloric availability.2,3 A recent WHO report integrated several analyses that 
quantified climate-related mortality caused by heat, coastal flooding, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, 
dengue and undernutrition in 2050.46 In the WHO report, it was projected that the most substantial 
health impacts of climate change in 2050 would be caused by heat (95,000 deaths) and undernutrition 
(85,000 deaths). The report, in particular the analysis of climate-related deaths caused by 
undernutrition, used a methodology similar to ours (including the same agricultural economic model), 
but it relied on older climate and socio-economic inputs that have been developed for the Third and 
Fourth Assessment Reports of the IPCC, compared to the ones developed for the Fifth Assessment 
Report used in this study. 
 
Interpretation: 
 
This study is novel, because it broadened the focus to include the composition of diets, in addition to 
caloric availability, as risk factor for climate-related health impacts. Figure A10 in Appendix A10 
adopts the WHO report’s central estimates and compares those to our results to illustrate the relevance 
of our focus. Our estimate of climate-related deaths due to changes in dietary and weight-related risks 
far exceeds the WHO estimate for the two greatest causes of climate-related deaths, even under a 
stringent climate-stabilization pathway. The estimate for a medium climate-stabilization pathway 
(RCP6·0), which is most similar to the emissions pathway used in the WHO report, exceeds the WHO 
estimate for the two greatest causes of climate-related deaths, heat and undernutrition, by factors of 
4·1 to 4·6, and it is 1·6 times larger than the total sum of all causes of death considered in the WHO 
report. This suggests that the health impacts of climate change that are due to changes in dietary and 
weight-related risk factors, as estimated in this study, could be among the largest health impacts of 
climate change.  
 
The WHO report and this study are complementary in the consideration or risk factors, the regional 
distribution of impacts, and with respect to the age groups included. The WHO report projected that 
most heat-related deaths would occur in high-income countries and in South and East Asia, and most 
undernutrition-related deaths among children would occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and in South Asia.46 
Corroborating the burden of heat stress and child undernutrition, our analysis projected that most diet-
related deaths would occur in the Western Pacific (equivalent to East Asia in the classification of the 
WHO report), and most underweight-related deaths among adults would occur in South-East Asia and 
Africa (Figure 2). The presence of multiple burdens suggest that health-related climate-change 
adaptation programmes could leverage synergies, e.g. when addressing the exposure to heat and 
changes in fruit and vegetable consumption, or between child undernutrition and adult underweight. 
More broadly, our study also projected that a large number of climate-related deaths would be offset 
by climate-related reductions in obesity (also in regions with large numbers of underweight-related 
deaths, Figure 2) – something health-related climate-change adaptation programmes could take into 
 17 
 
account by adopting a more general focus on weight-related risk factors which would include both 
underweight and obesity.

Figure 1: Overview of modelling framework. General circulation models (GCMs) were used to 
project changes in temperature and precipitation associated with different emissions (radiative forcing) 
pathways. The changes in temperature and precipitation were used by globally gridded crop models 
(GGCMs) to project changes in biophysical crop yields. The changes in biophysical crop yields were 
transferred to the IMPACT global economic model to estimate the market responses to yield changes, 
including changes in agricultural prices, management intensity, land use, consumption, and 
international trade, subject to assumptions on socio-economic development. Finally, changes in food 
consumption were used in a purpose-built global health model to estimate changes in mortality 
associated with changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors, concentrating on changes in the 
consumption of fruits and vegetables, and red meat, and on changes in body weight associated with 
changes in overall caloric availability.

Figure 2: Climate-related deaths (in thousands) in 2050 by risk factor and region. The risk factors 
include changes in fruit and vegetable consumption (FVC), red-meat consumption (MTC), and the 
prevalence of underweight (UND), overweight (OVW) and obesity (OBS). The regional aggregates 
include all regions (Global), high-income countries (HIC), and low and middle-income countries of 
Africa (AFR_LMIC), the Americas (AMR_LMIC), the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR_LMIC), 
Europe (EUR_LMIC), South-East Asia (SEA_LMIC), and the Western Pacific Region (WPR_LMIC). 
Confidence intervals are listed in Table A9.4 in Appendix A9.
