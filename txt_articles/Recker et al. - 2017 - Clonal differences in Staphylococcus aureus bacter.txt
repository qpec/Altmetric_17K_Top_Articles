Abstract 
2 
The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen, where the emergence of 
3 
antibiotic resistance is a global public-health concern. Infection severity, and in particular 
4 
bacteraemia-associated mortality, has been attributed to several host-related factors, such 
5 
as age and the presence of co-morbidities. The role of the bacterium in infection severity is 
6 
less well understood as it is complicated by the multi-faceted nature of bacterial virulence, 
7 
which has so far prevented a robust mapping between genotype, phenotype and infection 
8 
outcome. To investigate the role of bacterial factors in contributing to bacteraemia-
9 
associated mortality we phenotyped a collection of sequenced clinical S. aureus isolates from 
10 
patients with bloodstream infections, representing two globally important clonal types (CC22 
11 
and CC30). By adopting a GWAS approach we identified and functionally verified several 
12 
genetic loci that affect the expression of cytolytic toxicity and biofilm formation. By analysing 
13 
the pooled data comprising bacterial genotype and phenotype together with clinical meta-
14 
data within a machine-learning framework we found significant clonal differences in the 
15 
determinants most predictive of poor infection outcome. Whereas elevated cytolytic toxicity 
16 
in combination with low levels of biofilm formation was predictive of an increased risk of 
17 
mortality in infections by strains of a CC22 background, these virulence-specific factors had 
18 
little influence on mortality rates associated with CC30 infections. Our results therefore 
19 
suggest that different clones may have adopted different strategies to overcome host 
20 
responses and cause severe pathology. Our study further demonstrates the use of a 
21 
combined genomics and data analytic approach to enhance our understanding of bacterial 
22 
pathogenesis at the individual level, which will be an important step towards personalised 
23 
medicine and infectious disease management.

Introduction 
1 
Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) is a significant global health problem1 and is 
2 
exacerbated by the emergence and widespread circulation of drug resistant strains, such as 
3 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)2. Mandatory surveillance of SAB has been implemented 
4 
in several countries, with many reporting a decline in the incidence of methicillin-resistant 
5 
SAB3-5. However, in the UK the incidence of methicillin-susceptible SAB   has been increasing 
6 
year on year, with an overall increase of more than 15% since reporting became mandatory 
7 
in 2011/20123. Furthermore, the 30 day (all-cause) mortality rate for SAB has not significantly 
8 
changed over the last two decades and appears to have plateaued at approximately 20%6. 
9 
This strongly suggests that existing infection control and treatment options are insufficient to 
10 
tackle this important health problem and that a better understanding of the factors that 
11 
contribute to bacteraemia-associated morbidity is crucially needed. 
12 
 
13 
To date, many host risk factors have been identified for both the occurrence of and treatment 
14 
failure following SAB6. However, the contribution of the bacterium is only partially 
15 
understood and is largely informed by experimental animal studies. These model systems 
16 
come with their own set of limitations, and many observations contrast with those from 
17 
human studies. For example, whereas cytolytic toxins have previously been shown to enhance 
18 
disease severity in animal models of SAB7,8, isolates from invasive diseases in humans, such 
19 
as bacteraemia and pneumonia, were recently found to be significantly less toxic than those 
20 
isolated from skin and soft tissue infections or even those of healthy volunteers9-12. This raises 
21 
the question as to whether animal models are adequate to study bacterial virulence in human 
22 
SAB infections, or whether there is an important distinction between the role of toxicity in 
23 
the development of bacteraemia and its pathogenic effect once bacteraemia has been 
24 
  
4 
established. Either way, human-based approaches are essential to close this gap in our 
1 
knowledge. 
2 
 
3 
Our understanding of the pathogenesis of SAB has been further limited by the fact that that 
4 
most studies so far have focused on only a single or small number of factors in isolation. For 
5 
example, several studies have found increased mortality rates associated with methicillin-
6 
resistant SAB compared to methicillin-susceptible SAB13,14. However, patients with co-
7 
morbidities are more likely to develop methicillin-resistant bacteraemia due to their impaired 
8 
health and longer time spent in healthcare facilities compared to those without co-
9 
morbidities. When subsequent studies considered both methicillin resistance and the 
10 
presence of co-morbidities together no difference in mortality was associated with the 
11 
methicillin resistance status of the infecting bacterium15. This clearly illustrates that multiple 
12 
host and bacterial factors, as well as their possible interactions, have to be taken into 
13 
consideration when investigating the outcome of an individual infection. 
14 
 
15 
We have previously demonstrated how genotype-phenotype mapping in S. aureus has the 
16 
potential to provide sufficient information to enable predictions of the level of virulence 
17 
expressed by the infecting microorganism16. Here, we have expanded this whole-genome 
18 
approach to a set of clinical isolates from S. aureus bacteraemic patients, representing two 
19 
different clonal backgrounds (CC22 and CC30), and determined a number of genetic loci that 
20 
affect the bacteria’s cytolytic toxicity and biofilm formation, both of which are important 
21 
virulence factors. Using a predictive modelling framework on pooled data comprising genetic, 
22 
phenotypic and clinical factors we identified stark differences in the bacterial and host factors 
23 
most associated with patient death. Our results imply that the clonal background of the 
24 
  
5 
infecting microorganism has a more important role in determining the outcome of an 
1 
infection than previously recognised.

Material and Methods. 
4 
Strain and clinical metadata collection. All isolates were collected from patients admitted to 
5 
a single hospital with their first episode of SAB between 2006 and 2012, and were stored in 
6 
glycerol at -80°C. Samples were collected during an observational cohort study of adults with 
7 
SAB at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK between 2006 and 2012. These isolates 
8 
represented the genetic diversity present across the British Society for Antimicrobial 
9 
Chemotherapy collection of sequenced CC22 and CC30 isolates collected from multiple sites 
10 
across the UK and Ireland since 2008. Written informed consent was not required as the study 
11 
was conducted as part of a service evaluation of the management of SAB. Ethical approval 
12 
was obtained from the University of Cambridge Human Biology Research Ethics Committee 
13 
(reference HBREC.2013.05) and the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 
14 
Research and Development Department (reference A092869).  Study definitions have been 
15 
defined previously17 and were used to determine the focus of the bacteraemia, classify the 
16 
bacteraemia as community-acquired, hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated, and to 
17 
report outcomes, including death at 30 days. The previously defined definitions17 were placed 
18 
into eight categories; intravascular catheter infection (SAB caused from a central or peripheral 
19 
venous catheter), bone and joint infection (SAB due to a native joint infection), deep tissue 
20 
abscess (infection due to lung infection, deep tissue abscesses, mycotic aneurysms and 
21 
lesions in the central nervous system), infective endocarditis, infection due to a prosthetic 
22 
device (including prosthetic joints, implanted vascular devices, prosthetic cardiac valves), skin 
23 
  
6 
and soft tissue infection, disease of the urogenital tract, or an unknown focus of infection. 
1 
The presence of comorbidities was assessed using the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and 
2 
were dichotomized into scores of <3 or ≥3 18,19, as detailed in Supplementary Table 1. 
3 
Genome Sequencing. Bacterial DNA extraction was carried out on a QIAxtractor (Qiagen), and 
4 
library preparation was performed as previously described20. Index-tagged libraries were 
5 
created, and 96 separated libraries were sequenced in each of eight channels using the 
6 
Illumina HiSeq platform (Illumina) to generate 100-bp paired-end reads at the Wellcome Trust 
7 
Sanger Institute, UK. Paired-end reads for these isolates were mapped to either the 
8 
ST22/EMRSA15 reference strain, HO 5096 041221, or the CC30/EMRSA16 reference strain 
9 
MRSA25222 and SNPs were identified as described previously21. The accession number for the 
10 
sequence data for each of these isolates is listed in Supplementary Table 1. 
11 
Cytotoxicity Assay. Overnight S. aureus cultures were diluted 1:1000 into fresh tryptone soya 
12 
broth and incubated for 18 h at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm in 30 mL glass tubes. S. aureus 
13 
supernatants were harvested from 18 h cultures by centrifugation at 14,600 rpm for 10 min. 
14 
The THP-1 human monocyte-macrophage cell line (ATCC#TIB-202, which was  authenticated 
15 
and if they were tested for mycoplasma) was routinely grown in suspension in 30 mL of of 
16 
RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 μM L-
17 
glutamine, 200 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 
18 
incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were routinely viewed microscopically every 48–60 h and 
19 
harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature and re-suspended 
20 
to a final density of 1–1.2 x 106 cells/mL in tissue-grade phosphate buffered saline. This 
21 
procedure typically yielded >95% viability of cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion and 
22 
easyCyte flow cytometry. To evaluate S. aureus toxicity, for the CC30 isolates undiluted 
23 
supernatant was used, but due to the higher level of toxicity of the CC22 isolated the 
24 
  
7 
supernatant was diluted to 30% of the original volume in TSB.  The neat and diluted bacterial 
1 
supernatants (20µL) were incubated with 20 µL of washed THP-1 cells for 12 min at 37°C 
2 
under static conditions. Cell death was quantified by easyCyte (Millipore) flow cytometry 
3 
using the Guava Viability stain (Millipore) according to manufacturer’s instructions, with the 
4 
toxicity of each isolate quantified in triplicate and the mean of this presented (listed in 
5 
Supplementary Table 1). 
6 
Biofilm assay. Biofilm formation was quantified using a 1:40 dilution from overnight cultures 
7 
into 100 µL of fresh tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.5% sterile filtered glucose (TSBG) 
8 
in 96-well polystyrene plate (Costar). Perimeter wells of the 96-well plate were filled with 
9 
sterile H2O and plates were placed in a separate plastic container inside a 37°C incubator and 
10 
grown for 24 h under static conditions. For the transposon mutants, erythromycin (5 µg/mL) 
11 
was added to the growth medium. Semi-quantitative measurements of biofilm formation on 
12 
96-well polystyrene plates was determined based on the method of Ziebuhr et al23. Following 
13 
24-h growth, plates were washed vigorously five times in PBS, dried and stained with 150 μL 
14 
of 1% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. Following five washes of PBS, wells were 
15 
re-suspended in 200 μL of 7% acetic acid, and optical density at 595 nm was recorded using a 
16 
Fluorimeter plate reader (BMG Labtech). To control for day to day variability, for the clinical 
17 
isolates a control strain (E-MRSA15) was included on each plate in triplicate, and absorbance 
18 
values were normalised against this (listed in Additional Table 1). For the transposon mutants, 
19 
as JE2 is the wild type strain this was used as the control strain, and the effect of mutating the 
20 
loci made relative to this. For this experiment the assays were performed in triplicate on each 
21 
plate and repeated four times.  
22 
Genome wide association study (GWAS). The genome of the reference strains HO 5096 0412 
23 
and MRSA252 was split loci corresponding to coding region and intergenic regions, and loci 
24 
  
8 
containing SNPs relative to the reference genome were identified. Annotated intergenic 
1 
elements such as miscellaneous RNAs were considered separate loci. Synonymous SNPs in 
2 
coding regions and SNPs in known mobile genetic elements and repeat regions were not 
3 
considered. The resulting loci were named allele_X where X refers to the position of the SNP 
4 
at the 5’ end of that block, relative to the origin of replication. Each of these alleles in each 
5 
isolate was scored as 1 if it differed from the reference and 0 if it didn’t. These allele scores 
6 
for each isolate were used as the genotypic information for the following analysis. Significant 
7 
associations between bacterial genotype and either phenotype (toxicity and biofilm 
8 
formation) were identified by fitting an analysis of variance model (ANOVA) in R24 and using 
9 
a minor allele frequency cut-off of 5%. The reported P values are not corrected for multiple 
10 
testing; the Bonferroni statistical significance threshold is instead provided in fig. 3. 
11 
Predictive modelling. We employed a Random Forests25 machine learning approach, using 
12 
the randomForest package in R26, to identify the most important and clone-specific 
13 
determinants for host mortality based on the genotype, phenotype and clinical meta-data 
14 
(see supplementary file S1_RF_analysis.pdf for full details). The input variables were thus 
15 
taken from the pooled set of SNP data, relative cytolytic toxicity, relative biofilm formation 
16 
and infection/patient-specific data for each isolate. Due to the genetic differences between 
17 
CC22 and CC30, where only a small proportion of SNP positions overlapped, we carried out 
18 
the analysis for both clones separately. 
19 
Predictive accuracy. To assess the models’ predictive accuracies we employed two different 
20 
measures: (i) the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is generated by plotting 
21 
the true positive rate against the false positive rate (i.e. the observed incidence against the 
22 
false predicted incidence) at various threshold settings and where the area under the curve 
23 
(AUC) is a measure of predictive accuracy, with an AUC=1 equating to zero error and an 
24 
  
9 
AUC=0.5 equating to random guessing; and (ii) by means of a confusion matrix, which 
1 
contrasts the instances of the predicted classes (alive or death) against the actually observed 
2 
classes. The misclassification-rates reported here are based on the so-called out-of-bag 
3 
errors26, which are derived by iteratively testing the models’ performances against subsets of 
4 
data left out during the fitting processes and thus provide a measure of how well the models 
5 
would fare against unknown data. 
6 
Feature selection. Due to the high dimensionality of the combined dataset including 
7 
genotype, phenotype and clinical data, where the number of features significantly 
8 
outweighed the number of clinical samples, we performed a feature selection procedure 
9 
using the VSURF27 R package nested within a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The VSURF 
10 
algorithm selects features based on step-wise introduction of predictors in order of their 
11 
importance ranking with regards to their contribution to model performance. At each fold a 
12 
small number of features (in our case between 3 and 20) are selected, from which we then 
13 
took only those that were selected more than once to form our final feature set. This 
14 
procedure reduces the risk of overfitting and ensures that only those features are considered 
15 
that are important across a wide range of isolates. The Supplementary Note provides a 
16 
detailed overview of our analysis, including the feature selection procedure and parameter 
17 
settings.  
18 
Capsule dot-blots. Bacterial were grown overnight in TSB at 37oC with shaking. 5l of 
19 
overnight culture was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and the membranes dried for 
20 
10 minutes at 65oC. The membranes were washed three times in PBS and then once for 1hr 
21 
at 37oC in PBS with 2mg/ml trypsin. Membranes were then blocked in 0.05% skim milk for 
22 
1hr, and washed three times in PBS with 0.05% Tween (PBS-tween). Anti-Cap5 antiserum (a 
23 
generous gift from Prof. Jean Lee, Harvard) was diluted 1:1000 in the PBS-tween buffer and 
24 
  
10 
the membrane was incubated in this with gentle agitation for 1hr at room temperature. The 
1 
membranes were washed three time in PBS-tween. The protein A-HRP conjugate was diluted 
2 
1:1000 in PBS-tween and the membrane was incubated in this with gentle agitation for 1hr at 
3 
room temperature.  The membranes were washed and the reactivity of the antiserum 
4 
detected using the colorimetric substrate 4-chloro-1-napthol. The blots were scanned and 
5 
density of capsule anti-serum reactivity quantified using the ImageJ software. Each strain was 
6 
blotted three times and the average density of the three repeats for each isolate is presented. 
7 
Opsinophagocytosis assays. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from healthy human 
8 
volunteers were separated from heparinized blood by density centrifugation. The cells were 
9 
washed and resuspended at a density of 107 cells per ml. The opsinophagocytosis killing 
10 
assays were performed in 5X 106 PMNs, 10% (vol/vol) human serum and 106 cfu of each of 
11 
the S. aureus isolates. This was incubated with gentle agitation for 2hr at 37oC followed by 
12 
diluting and plating onto TSA plates to enumerate the live bacteria. The data presented is the 
13 
% killed bacteria for each of the 24 clinical isolates in triplicate.  
14

Results 
1 
Virulence-specific traits show significant intra- and inter-clonal variation.  To elucidate the 
2 
role of bacterial factors in human SAB we studied a collection of 300 S. aureus isolates 
3 
belonging to either the multi-locus defined clonal complex 22 or 30 (CC22, n=135; CC30, 
4 
n=165) and containing both methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) 
5 
isolates. Each isolate was quantitatively phenotyped with respect to cytolytic activity (the 
6 
ability to lyse a monocyte cell line, THP-1) and biofilm formation. Both traits are major 
7 
virulence determinants implicated in S. aureus disease1,2: cytolytic toxins enable the evasion 
8 
of cellular aspects of host immunity, release nutrient from host cells and are responsible for 
9 
much of the purulent tissue damage associated of S. aureus infections1,2, whereas biofilm 
10 
formation enables the bacteria to colonise foreign material and medical devices, protects it 
11 
from many aspects of host immunity and renders some antibiotics less effective1,2.  
12 
 
13 
Despite the close genetic and geographic relationship between the isolates there was 
14 
considerable variability with regards to cytolytic toxicity and biofilm formation within the two 
15 
clonal backgrounds (fig. 1). We mapped the level of toxicity and biofilm onto maximum 
16 
likelihood trees for both collections, which revealed no obvious clustering with respect to 
17 
genetic relationship and virulence traits (Suppl. Figs. 1 and 2). The distribution in biofilm 
18 
formation, here normalised relative to a single control strain, was mostly comparable 
19 
between the two clones and no apparent difference between methicillin resistant (MRSA) 
20 
and susceptible (MSSA) strains was observed (fig. 1a and b).  
21 
 
22 
Toxicity, on the other hand, was found to be significantly higher in CC22 isolates. We 
23 
therefore had to dilute the CC22 supernatants to 30% in fresh TSB to see the variability within 
24 
  
12 
this clone, whereas the toxicity assay for CC30 isolates was performed on undiluted 
1 
supernatant. Although toxicity could not be compared directly between the two clones, it is 
2 
clear that the distribution in this virulence-associated trait is much more bimodal for bacteria 
3 
of the CC22 background, with strains showing either very high or very low levels of cytolytic 
4 
toxicity (fig. 1c), which contrasts with the more uniform distribution in toxicity of CC30 
5 
isolates (fig. 1d). As with biofilm, no association was found between methicillin susceptibility 
6 
and this particular virulence phenotype in the CC22 isolates. It has previously been reported 
7 
that methicillin resistance conferred by the type II SCCmec element in the CC30 clonal 
8 
background significantly alters the ability of the bacteria to secrete toxins and form 
9 
biofilm28,29; here we could only confirm its effect on toxicity, with MSSA isolates showing 
10 
significantly elevated levels of cytolytic activity (means of 42% for MRSA and 74% for MSSA, 
11 
P<1E-8, Welch’s two sample t-test). 
12 
 
13 
Genome-wide association scan identifies bacterial virulence-affecting loci. As the genome 
14 
sequence for each isolate in these two collections was available, we sought to examine 
15 
whether the phenotypic and genotypic data presented here would contain sufficient 
16 
information to enable us to identify toxicity and biofilm affecting loci. We performed a 
17 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) on both the CC22 and CC30 collection, where 
18 
associations were tested at an uncorrected (P<0.05) and a Bonferroni corrected (P<4.6x10-5) 
19 
significance threshold (fig. 2a and b). For biofilm formation, no loci reached significance levels 
20 
above the Bonferroni threshold for the CC30, whereas 20 loci reached this threshold within 
21 
the CC22 collection, (fig. 2a and b).  Of these, we were able to functionally verify the effect of 
22 
five loci using transposon mutant from the Nebraska library32 (fig. 2c; Table 1). For toxicity no 
23 
loci reached significance levels above the Bonferroni threshold for the CC22 collection, and 
24 
  
13 
95 loci reached it for the CC30 collection, however, of these we were only able to verify the 
1 
effects of five (fig. 2d; Table 1).  
2 
 
3 
Mortality-associated determinants crucially depend on clonal background. For 160 of the 
4 
300 bacteraemic patients we had access to their 30-day mortality data, as well as access to 
5 
some of the established host risk factors for mortality including age, comorbidity index and 
6 
whether the bacteraemia developed in the community or a healthcare setting (Supp. Table 
7 
1). With these data and our bacterial genotypic and phenotypic data we sought to determine 
8 
which factors were predictive of infection outcome in those 160 patients. Due to the high 
9 
dimensionality and high number of possible interactions between the various host and 
10 
bacterial factors we employed a random forests machine learning approach25,26. We analysed 
11 
the data both in a stratified and in a combined way, i.e. we fitted models to each of the 
12 
phenotype, genotype and clinical / patient data separately before fitting a model to the 
13 
pooled data.  
14 
Overall, we found that good predictive accuracy could be achieved by fitting a model to the 
15 
various subsets of data for both the CC22 and CC30 isolates, as shown by receiver operator 
16 
characteristic (ROC) curves (fig. 3a and b). However, the particular features, or predictors, 
17 
that the models revealed as most important for distinguishing cases where patients died or 
18 
survived for at least 30 days were crucially dependent on clonal background of the infecting 
19 
strain.  
20 
For the CC22 collection we found that the bacterial phenotype was more predictive than the 
21 
host risk factors for which we had data (AUC=0.75 compared to AUC=0.66), whereas the 
22 
model including all available data showed the best performance, with misclassification rates 
23 
as low as 22% (fig 3c). Looking at the variable importance scores (fig. 3e), a measure of the 
24 
  
14 
contribution of the individual features to model performance, confirms that both virulence 
1 
factors (toxicity and biofilm) of the infecting bacteria together with the patient’s co-
2 
morbidities are the principal predictors of poor infection outcome. Interestingly, although 
3 
patient age was selected as one of the more important variables by our feature selection 
4 
procedure, its power to differentiate between outcomes of infection by strains of this clonal 
5 
lineage was significantly less that of the bacteria’s phenotype. Supplementary figure 3 shows 
6 
how the interactions between toxicity, biofilm, co-morbidity and patient age determine the 
7 
risk of SAB-associated mortality for this clone, which clearly highlights how the combination 
8 
of high toxicity or low biofilm with patient age and co-morbidities significantly increase the 
9 
risk of poor infection outcomes in this collection of isolates. 
10 
For our CC30 collection we also found good predictive accuracy but in this case the factors 
11 
contributing to model performance were very different. In this case, neither the bacterial 
12 
phenotype nor the data relating to common host risk factors were sufficient to predict 30-
13 
day mortality (fig. 3b). The model performance significantly improved by considering the 
14 
bacteria genotype, either by itself or in combination with the other data, and resulted in 
15 
relatively low misclassification errors, although specificity with respect to patient death was 
16 
not as what we achieved for the CC22 collection (64% vs. 74%). The lack of importance of the 
17 
phenotype and clinical data in predicting the outcome of CC30-associated bacteraemia is 
18 
further highlighted in the variable importance plot in fig. 3f, with the majority of features 
19 
being related to the bacterial genotype.   
20 
It is interesting to note that when the methicillin resistance status of the bacteria was 
21 
considered in isolation, it was significantly associated with mortality (26% death amongst the 
22 
MRSA Vs 14% death amongst the MSSA infected patients for the CC22 collection and 22% Vs 
23 
15% for the CC30 collection). However, the model did not identify it as predictive when 
24 
  
15 
considered alongside host features, such as co-morbidity. What this suggests is that patients 
1 
with higher co-morbidity scores are more likely to be infected by MRSA, but their mortality is 
2 
affected more by their underlying health than the methicillin resistance status of the infecting 
3 
bacteria, demonstrating the importance of adopting a multi-variant approach. More 
4 
importantly however, is that what is very clear from this work is that the clonal background 
5 
of the infecting bacterium has a much greater influence on the severity of infection, and 
6 
bacteraemia-associated mortality in particular, than previously appreciated.  
7 
 
8 
Functional verification of mortality-associated locus. Although the feature selection 
9 
procedure we employed should reduce the false-discovery rate, false-positive findings cannot 
10 
be ruled out without an independent validation dataset. We therefore sought to functionally 
11 
verify true virulence affecting polymorphisms. Of the 16 loci selected by the model to be 
12 
predictive of mortality within both the CC22 and CC30 collections, only one encoded a known 
13 
virulence factors for S. aureus, CapA. The capA gene encodes an enzyme involved in the 
14 
capsule biosynthesis, which is responsible for protecting the bacteria from many aspect of 
15 
host immunity, and has been shown in animal models to significantly affect disease severity 
16 
following bacteraemia30,31. Given its role in protecting the bacteria during infection we 
17 
hypothesised that variability in capA may affect capsule production and as a consequence 
18 
affect infection outcome.  
19 
Within the CC22 collection there were six non-synonymous and one synonymous SNP in this 
20 
gene. Of these, only one SNP (at position 142543) was distributed disproportionately 
21 
between those isolates from patients who died and those who survived, thus providing the 
22 
mortality-related signal detected by the model. SNP142543 affects the substitution of a 
23 
proline at position 146 in the protein with a serine. That all six incidences occurred in isolates 
24 
  
16 
from patients who survived their bacteraemia suggests that this substitution may alter 
1 
capsule quantity or quality to lessen its protective effect. To test this we performed dot-blots 
2 
on whole bacterial cells using anti-sera raised against capsule (see Material & Methods). 
3 
Alongside the appropriate controls we examined capsule production of 12 isolates from 
4 
patients who died, all of which had the proline at position 146, and 12 isolates from patients 
5 
who survived, half of which had the serine substitution. As demonstrated in fig. 4a and b, 
6 
isolates expressing CapA with a serine at position 146 showed a lack of reactivity to the 
7 
antisera, suggesting that these isolates either produce less capsule or that the capsule is 
8 
sufficiently different in structure to evade antibody recognition.  
9 
As capsule is known to protect S. aureus from killing by phagocytes, we also performed 
10 
opsinophagocytosis killing (OPK) assays on these 24 clinical isolates, and demonstrate that 
11 
the isolates with a serine at position 146 of CapA were killed more effectively than those with 
12 
a proline at this site. While a definitive demonstration of the effect of this substitution would 
13 
require the construction of isogenic mutants, our aim here was to verify the findings of the 
14 
predictive model. That capsule production and survival upon exposure to phagocytes, 
15 
established features that protects the bacteria during infection, are affected in all of the 
16 
strains with this substitution and none of the 18 without it provides functional support for 
17 
the sensitivity of the predictive model.  
18 
 
19 
Discussion 
20 
In this study we have demonstrated how S. aureus bacteraemia-associated mortality is 
21 
crucially influenced by a variety of host and bacteria-related factors, where our findings 
22 
suggest that of the host and bacterial features we had access to, the bacterial phenotype and 
23 
genotype were the most predictive of infection outcome. From the host perspective, age and 
24 
  
17 
co-morbidities were the only factors that we found to be predictive of mortality of patients 
1 
infected with bacteria of the CC22 clonal background. For the CC30 strains, on the other hand, 
2 
patient age or co-morbidities only played a marginal role for correctly distinguishing infection 
3 
outcomes. The lack of a greater effect of co-morbidities for these isolates may be explained 
4 
by a difference in their prevalence in patients, as within our collection we found that patients 
5 
with CC22-associated bacteraemia had higher CCI scores on average than those with a 
6 
bacteraemia caused by a CC30 isolate (3.7 and 2.4 respectively, P=0.005, Welch’s Two Sample 
7 
t-test). Furthermore, patients infected with CC22 strains were also significantly older on 
8 
average (43 years compared to 32 years, P<1E-4, Welch’s Two Sample t-test). It is therefore 
9 
possible that amongst those infected with a CC30 strain the existence of co-morbidities was 
10 
less discriminating than for those infected with a CC22 isolates.  
11 
 
12 
Of the bacterial factors we examined we found significant variability in biofilm formation 
13 
within the CC22 and CC30 clones but not between them. Animal studies on the role of biofilm 
14 
in virulence have demonstrated that it is specific to certain types of infection. That is, it may 
15 
contribute positively to infectious processes involving indwelling catheters but negatively to 
16 
virulence in sepsis models. Our CC22 data supports these findings, where low levels of biofilm 
17 
was associated with mortality. Unlike with the CC30 collection, where neither high or low 
18 
levels of biofilm were predictive of patient mortality.  
19 
 
20 
Bacterial toxicity was highly predictive of mortality amongst the CC22 infected patients, 
21 
whereas for the CC30 infected patient it was not. This may be explained by the relatively low 
22 
level of toxicity we and others have reported for this clone28,34,35. We have previously 
23 
reported that the antibiotic resistant conferring type II SCCmec element affects the ability of 
24 
  
18 
MRSA to secrete toxins28, and we see this effect again here where the mean toxicity for the 
1 
CC30 MRSA was significantly lower than for MSSA. However, even the MSSA belonging to this 
2 
clone were less toxic than either methicillin-resistant or susceptible isolates from the CC22 
3 
collection, which could be a consequence of clonally associated polymorphisms in regulators 
4 
of toxicity, such as Agr34. This clone appears therefore to be inherently constrained in its 
5 
ability to produce toxins, and as such must utilize alternative and as yet to be elucidated 
6 
means of causing damage to their host. Our result from the two clones studied here contrasts 
7 
with those of another study which also looked at toxicity (although they used the term “agr 
8 
dysfunction”), where they found that low levels of toxicity was associated with increased 
9 
mortality amongst the most severely ill patients in their study36.  This study contained multiple 
10 
S. aureus clones, and so it would be interesting to see if the effect they found was specific to 
11 
individual clones. 
12 
 
13 
The multivariate approach taken here also provides some clues on other bacterial factors 
14 
linked to mortality of bacteraemic patients. We functionally verified the effect of one of 
15 
those: the polymorphism in the capA gene that appears to affect capsule production and 
16 
consequently the ability of the bacteria to protect itself from host immunity. For the CC30 
17 
collection the polymorphisms in the drp35 gene were the most predictive of mortality, and 
18 
this gene has been shown to be up regulated in response to exposure to specific antibiotics37, 
19 
suggesting that enhanced ability to survive such pressures may increase the ability of the 
20 
bacteria to kill their host. 
21 
 
22 
In additional to identifying factors that affect mortality, we have also used our bacterial 
23 
phenotypic and genotypic data to identify effectors of toxicity and biofilm by adopting a 
24 
  
19 
GWAS approach, and verified their effect using transposon mutants (fig. 2; Table 1). Helicases 
1 
are involved in unwinding DNA for processes such as transcription. Given that the loss of this 
2 
gene (NE513) results in a decrease in biofilm formation, this suggests that this helicase may 
3 
be responsible for unwinding genes involved in increasing the amount of biofilm a bacterium 
4 
produces. The involvement of the quinolone efflux pump NorA (NE1034) is intriguing, given 
5 
the co-incidence of biofilm with increased antibiotic resistance. The inactivation of the 
6 
peptidase (NE1455) also causes an increase in biofilm formation, and it is thus possible that 
7 
it may have a direct effect on breaking down of the proteinaceous components of biofilm. 
8 
The role of the other genes in toxicity and biofilm formation is currently unclear, but work to 
9 
elucidate this is underway.  
10 
 
11 
GWAS in any species is prone to produce spurious associations, and on this dataset our 
12 
approach generated a 70% (14/20) false positive rate for biofilm formation and 95% for 
13 
toxicity (90/95). It is clear that there is significant variability in success rates of this approach, 
14 
and this may be due to the presence of loci with varying effects on the phenotype in question. 
15 
However, given that these can be readily identified and discounted in bacteria using mutants 
16 
from transposon libraries, we believe that it is still a suitable approach to identify candidate 
17 
loci whilst avoiding the need to screen entire mutant libraries consisting of thousands of 
18 
individual mutants. 
19 
 
20 
It is likely that other factors not considered here may also contribute to a patient’s risk of 
21 
death following SAB. Apart from patient care, host genotype and other bacterial phenotypes 
22 
could have a significant effect on infection outcome. A larger, more detailed dataset may 
23 
enable us to fully identify these factors and unravel their interactions to predict mortality with 
24 
  
20 
even higher accuracy. However, given the general complexity of this type of disease and its 
1 
epidemiology, where older patients with co-morbidities are the most susceptible, it might 
2 
never be feasible to fully predict infection outcome.  
3 
 
4 
With the growing global problem of antimicrobial resistance, alternative intervention and 
5 
control strategies are needed. These include the development of vaccines and identification 
6 
of drugs that attenuate the virulence of pathogens. However, without a full understanding of 
7 
how the bacterial targets for these strategies are involved in causing disease in humans, there 
8 
is a significant risk of investing in and pursuing unsuccessful lines of therapeutic development. 
9 
For example, our findings suggest that cytolytic toxins, components of biofilm and capsules 
10 
are unlikely to be good targets, due to their disparate roles in different stages of disease and 
11 
their highly variable expression between and even within closely related bacterial clones. 
12 
With the move towards the introduction of microbial genome sequencing into routine 
13 
diagnostic settings, the ability to use such information to inform clinicians on the likely 
14 
outcome of an infection for individual patients would allow them to tailor treatment to that 
15 
individual. Our work therefore has the potential to make a significant contribution towards 
16 
the implementation of personalised medicine and infectious disease management.

Biofilm forming abilities were quantified relative to a control included in each assay in a static

difference between methicillin-resistant (MRSA, grey circles) and methicillin-susceptible

(MSSA, black circles) isolates. Isolates of the CC22 (a, n=136) and CC30 (b, n=164) backgrounds

supernatant of the CC30 isolates was used undiluted. Apart from differences in baseline

using ANOVA in R) for both biofilm (left-hand side) and toxicity (right-hand side), performed 
21 
on the bacteraemia isolates of the CC22 (a) and CC30 (b) background. For toxicity, only two 
22 
polymorphic loci were significantly associated using an uncorrected threshold (indicated by 
23 
the red vertical dashed line), one in the agrC gene and the other in a gene encoding a putative 
24 
membrane protein. These loci are indicated with red circles, the top dot corresponding to agrC 
25 
and the bottom the membrane protein. For biofilm, 20 loci were significantly associated with 
26 
toxicity when Bonferroni was used to correct for multiple comparisons (indicated by the green 
27 
vertical dotted line). (c, d) Functional validation of the effects of five biofilm-associated loci (c) 
28 
and five toxicity-associated loci (d) in CC22 bacteria using transposon insertion and compared 
29 
to the wild-type (JE2) (Welch’s two-sided t-test, with *: P<2E-2, **: P<2E-4, ***: P<2E-6).

Results are based on four biological replicates per strain that were repeated three times each.

The medians are presented as horizontal bars, with the boxes and whiskers showing the 1st 
32 
and 3rd quartile and interquartile ranges.

Figure 3. Predictive model performance and variable importance. Random forests were 
36 
fitted against different subsets of data and the combined data for both the CC22 isolates (top) 
37 
and CC30 isolates (bottom). (a, b) Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of the random 
38 
forests fit to four sets of variables consisting of host risk factors (clin, red line), genotype data 
39 
(geno, blue line), phenotype data (pheno, black line) and all available variables (all, cyan line). 
40 
As indicated by the area under curve (AUC), the model fit to a combination of all available data 
41 
results in the highest predictive accuracy. The dotted black line denotes the expected result 
42 
by random guessing (AUC=0.5).  (c, d) Confusion matrices demonstrating the model’s 
43 
accuracies in predicting 30-day mortality when fitted against all data. The out-of-bag 
44 
classification and misclassification rates are illustrated as dark-blue/diagonal and light-
45 
blue/off-diagonal wedges, respectively. (e, f) Relative importance scores, as measures of a 
46 
  
27 
variable’s influence on the model’s predictive performance, of the most predictive features

(red circles: mean, errorbars: standard deviation); a detailed list of the genetic loci is provided

as Supplementary Table 1 and 2.

Figure 4. Capsule production is affected in CC22 isolates containing a mortality-predicting 
7 
SNP. A: The production of capsule was compared between 24 CC22 isolates using anti-serum 
8 
raised against a type 5 S. aureus capsule by dot-blotting (a representative blot is presented). 
9 
Twelve of the isolates were those from patients who survived their bacteraemia (alive) and 12 
10 
from patients who did not survive their bacteraemia (dead). Of the strains from patient who 
11 
survived, 6 contained a proline (P) at position 146 of CapA, while the other 6 contained a serine 
12 
(S). B: The dot-blots were performed three times and the intensity of the reaction of each 
13 
strain quantified. Mean intensity for each isolate is presented, where the isolates containing 
14 
the serine were significantly less reactive to the antiserum. C: To compare the protective 
15 
qualities of the capsule we performed opsinophagocytosis assays using human PMNs with 
16 
each of the 24 isolates. The data presented is the % killed bacteria for each of the 24 clinical 
17 
isolates which were performed in triplicate. (Welch’s two-sided t-test, with *: P<2E-2, **: 
18 
P<2E-4, ***: P<2E-6).
