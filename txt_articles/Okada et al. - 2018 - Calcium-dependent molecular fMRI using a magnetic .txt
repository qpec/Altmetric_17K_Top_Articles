Abstract
Calcium ions are ubiquitous signaling molecules in all multicellular organisms, where they 
mediate diverse aspects of intracellular and extracellular communication over widely varying 
temporal and spatial scales1. Although techniques for mapping calcium-related activity at high 
resolution by optical means are well established, there is currently no reliable method to measure 
calcium dynamics over large volumes in intact tissue2. Here we address this need by introducing a 
family of magnetic calcium-responsive nanoparticles (MaCaReNas) that can be detected by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MaCaReNas respond within seconds to [Ca2+] changes in the 
0.1-1.0 mM range, suitable for monitoring extracellular calcium signaling processes in the brain. 
We show that the probes permit repeated detection of brain activation in response to diverse 
stimuli in vivo. MaCaReNas thus provide a tool for calcium activity mapping in deep tissue and 
offer a precedent for development of further nanoparticle-based sensors for dynamic molecular 
imaging with MRI.

 In the brain, variations in extracellular calcium ion concentrations ([Ca2+]o) are associated 
with synaptic activity, in which voltage-triggered influx of extracellular Ca2+ is involved in 
electrical and chemical signaling3,4. Consequent reduction of [Ca2+]o from resting levels 
near 1 mM in turn tends to depress synaptic activity via the extracellular calcium-sensing 
receptor5,6 or through direct interactions with glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid receptor 
subtypes7. Regional extracellular calcium levels are anticorrelated with population-wide 
intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), though [Ca2+]o exhibits slower and more 
diffuse dynamics than [Ca2+]i3,8,9. Behaviorally-relevant extracellular calcium changes can 
last for tens of seconds, with activity-dependent fluctuations that push [Ca2+]o to 
concentrations as low as 100 μM6; even slower variations of [Ca2+]o correlate to sleep-wake 
transitions10. Abnormal Ca2+ signaling has been implicated in numerous brain disorders, 
such as epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease11, but despite its significance in normal and 
pathological brain function, basic questions about the phenomenology and mechanisms 
associated with extracellular Ca2+ remain.
An imaging probe for measuring extracellular calcium in vivo could be of great value in 
both basic scientific and medical contexts. Of particular interest is the possibility of using 
such a probe to map brain activity; this could constitute a molecularly-specific analog to 
functional MRI (fMRI), a widely used brain imaging approach that usually detects 
neurophysiology indirectly, via changes in blood flow2. Fluorescent Ca2+ sensors can be 
used to measure [Ca2+]o levels, but most existing compounds have binding constants too 
high for optimal sensing in the 0.1-1.0 mM range; like other optical probes, they are also 
unsuitable for typical applications in deep tissue. MRI-detectable calcium probes, including 
calcium-responsive nanoparticle sensors tuned to other [Ca2+] ranges, have been developed 
for noninvasive applications12–14, but none has yet been shown to reveal calcium dynamics 
in vivo. One of the challenges in constructing a calcium sensor suitable for monitoring 
[Ca2+]o is the need for a sensor mechanism that transduces relatively modest analyte 
fluctuations into discernable image signal changes. Such sensitivity is particularly hard to 
achieve using small molecule sensors, which usually exhibit binding isotherms that span two 
orders of magnitude in [Ca2+]15. For this reason, we sought to improve on previous 
approaches by exploiting the highly cooperative sensing mechanism afforded by reversible 
magnetic nanoparticle clustering, which can produce large changes in T2-weighted MRI 
signals over relatively narrow ionic concentration ranges2.
To achieve appropriate sensitivity, a new MaCaReNa probe was engineered using 
synaptotagmin proteins, which are components of synaptic neurotransmitter release 
machinery that naturally respond to 0.1-1.0 mM changes in [Ca2+]1 and that have not 
previously been applied for MRI calcium sensing. Each synaptotagmin monomer contains 
two ~15 kDa calcium-binding C2 domains. Calcium binding to these domains promotes 
further complex formation with the anionic lipid phosphatidylserine (PS), a component of 
the plasma membrane inner leaflet. This interaction can drive clustering of PS-containing 
lipid vesicles at Ca2+ concentrations above ~0.2 mM16, suitable for monitoring [Ca2+]o.
MaCaReNa sensors based on this effect were prepared by mixing the fused C2 domains of 
synaptotagmin 1 (C2AB) with lipid-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (LCIOs) (Figure 1a). 
The C2AB moieties were expressed and purified from bacteria17 and the nanoparticles were

 prepared by coating oleate-stabilized magnetic iron oxide cores with a 7:3 mixture of 
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PS (see Methods). Initial tests were performed with 
combinations containing 1 nM nanoparticles (100 μM Fe) and 2.5 μM C2AB. Ca2+-
dependent aggregation of the sensor components was measured by dynamic light scattering 
(DLS) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) with or without 1 mM Ca2+. Observed 
hydrodynamic diameters were 35 ± 1 and 262 ± 14 nm, respectively, in low vs. high calcium 
conditions. Mg2+ concentration changes produced no discernable effects in DLS, 
demonstrating specificity of Ca2+ dependence (Supplementary Figure S1). Atomic force 
microscopy (AFM) images further confirmed nanoparticle aggregation in the presence of 
Ca2+ (Figure 1b).
MaCaReNa responses were readily detectable by MRI, with a calcium-dependent increase in 
the strength of the contrast agent (transverse relaxivity, r2) from 151 ± 15 mM−1 s−1 at 0 mM 
Ca2+ to 261 ± 21 mM−1 s−1at 1.2 mM Ca2+ (Figure 1c). This increase in r2 is consistent with 
expected consequences of aggregation for magnetic nanoparticles with diameter below ~30 
nm18. Half-maximal r2 changes were observed at 0.43 mM Ca2+. Calcium-dependent r2 
changes could not be observed samples containing LCIOs without C2AB, or LCIOs mixed 
with a C2AB variant (C2ABCa−) engineered to lack calcium binding affinity (Supplementary 
Table 1 and Figure S2). These controls demonstrate specificity of calcium detection by the 
MaCaReNa mechanism. Raw images of samples containing MaCaReNas or control 
mixtures show corresponding T2-weighted MRI signal changes in each case (Figure 1d). 
Importantly, calcium-dependent r2 changes could be reversed by subsequent addition of 
excess ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and restored again by further addition of 
excess CaCl2 (Figure 1e).
Response kinetics of the MaCaReNa probes are important for dynamic calcium sensing. To 
measure sensor response times, we performed DLS experiments in which calcium 
concentrations were rapidly increased or decreased by addition of Ca2+ or a chelator, 
respectively, to MaCaReNa samples again containing 1 nM LCIOs and 2.5 μM C2AB 
(Supplementary Figure S3a). Results indicated substantial changes in light scattering 
reflecting clustering and unclustering of the sensors within the experimental dead time of 
~20 s. Kinetic measurements of the LCIO-C2AB interaction on a faster time scale were 
obtained by measuring biolayer interferometry (BLI) changes following rapid immersion of 
a surface conjugated to C2AB into a solution containing LCIO particles (Supplementary 
Figure S3b). Observed time intervals for half maximal binding or dissociation of the 
particles were 4.9 ± 1.0 s and 4.1 ± 0.4 s, respectively. These results indicate that 
MaCaReNas formed from C2AB and LCIOs can achieve response rates suitable for 
calcium-dependent molecular-level functional MRI (molecular fMRI) on the time scale of 
seconds2.
To ascertain whether aggregated versus disaggregated probe states could be distinguished by 
MRI in living tissue, we intracranially injected rats over one hour with a total of 7.2 μL of 1 
nM LCIOs in the presence or absence of 2.5 μM C2AB. To prevent agglomeration of 
particles before or during brain infusion, sensors and control samples were formulated in 
calcium-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-
aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Volumetric analysis of T2-weighted

 MRI scans showed detectable contrast effects over regions of 80 ± 60 μL3 (Supplementary 
Figure S4), demonstrating that distribution of MaCaReNas over sizeable measurement 
volumes in vivo is feasible. The region of contrast created by nanoparticle injection arose 
from convective spreading under the injection conditions we employed; because of 
parenchymal geometric constraints19 and the relatively slow predicted diffusion of both 
MaCaReNa components20, passive transport is unlikely to contribute significantly to probe 
distribution or to separation of LCIO and C2AB species from one another. T2-weighted MRI 
signal in areas infused with MaCaReNas was considerably lower than in areas infused with 
LCIO only (Figure 2a). A mean MRI signal decrease with respect to background of 42 ± 4% 
was observed in brain areas infused with MaCaReNas; this was significantly greater (t-test p 
≤ 0.023, n ≥ 4) than signal changes observed in areas injected with LCIOs only (21 ± 8%) or 
with LCIOs mixed with C2ABCa− (24 ± 6%) (Figure 2b). These results suggest functionality 
of the MaCaReNa calcium-responsive mechanism in the living tissue.
To assess the ability of MaCaReNas to report dynamic changes in [Ca2+]o evoked by neural 
activity, probes were injected intracranially into the rat striatum, followed by chemical 
neurostimulation using 0.6 μL pulses of 100 mM KCl in aCSF. A similar K+ infusion 
paradigm has been used previously to induce neural activity changes with a radius of over 
1.5 mm21. In our experiments, K+ stimulation produced notable signal increases exclusively 
within areas infused with MaCaReNas (Figure 3a), consistent with the expected suppression 
of [Ca2+]o by stimulation and consequent decrease in r2 due to disaggregation of the calcium 
sensors. Stimulus-dependent signal changes were reversible and could be repeated over 
multiple cycles of K+ stimulation and recovery with no apparent decrease in response 
amplitudes over the repeated treatments (Figure 3b,c). Observed rise times and decay times 
on the order of minutes likely reflect a mixture of K+ infusion dynamics, neural activity time 
courses, and sensor response characteristics. Corresponding K+-induced MRI changes could 
not be observed in the presence of control sensors formulated with C2ABCa− or lacking 
C2AB entirely (Figure 3b). Similarly, signal changes were not observed following mock 
stimulation by infusion of aCSF supplemented by 100 mM NaCl in place of KCl (Figure 
3a,b). Brain stimulation with 0.6 μL pulses of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate22 (1 
mM) also produced clear and repeatable signal increases in the presence of MaCaReNa 
sensors that could not be observed with C2ABCa− control probes (Figure 3d and 
Supplementary Figure S5). Neither K+ nor glutamate-dependent responses could be 
explained by direct effects of these stimulants on the MaCaReNas themselves 
(Supplementary Figure S6). These measurements therefore indicate the ability of 
MaCaReNas to report neural activity-dependent [Ca2+]o fluctuations in the absence of 
artifacts from endogenous blood flow or other confounding factors.
Molecular fMRI signal changes induced by K+ stimulation in the presence of MaCaReNas 
(18 ± 5%) were significantly greater than signal changes induced by Na+ infusion in the 
presence of MaCaReNas (t-test p = 0.027, n = 4) or K+ stimulation in the presence of control 
sensors formulated with C2ABCa− (t-test p = 0.0099, n = 4) (Figure 3e). Glutamate-induced 
signal changes (10 ± 1%) were also significantly greater in the presence of MaCaReNas than 
in the presence of LCIO/C2ABCa− mixtures (t-test p = 0.0008, n = 4) (Figure 3e). Varying 
effects of K+ and glutamate stimulation were also reflected by differences in the slopes of 
the onset of signal changes observed during and after stimulation (Figure 3f). Potassium

 stimulation evoked a sharper rise in MRI signal, consistent with the greater magnitude of its 
effect, but its decline to baseline was also faster as a percentage of its rise time (−30 ± 4% 
min−1 for K+ vs. −2 ± 4% min−1 for glutamate), consistent with the possibility that 
glutamate-induced [Ca2+]o depression might persist longer in the brain.
To probe the ability of MaCaReNas to detect more physiological neuronal activation on a 
faster time scale, we applied the probes in conjunction with medial forebrain bundle (MFB) 
electrical stimulation23, a neural activation paradigm used commonly in addiction research 
(Figure 4a). Stimulation parameters chosen for the experiments were within range of 
previous studies24,25, and suitable for evoking robust self-stimulation behavior in a standard 
operant paradigm (Supplementary Figure S7), demonstrating their relevance to naturalistic 
behavior and its underlying neurophysiology. To measure calcium responses to the 
stimulation, MaCaReNas were infused into dorsal striatum and then imaged using a block 
design paradigm26 in conjunction with T2-weighted spin echo echo planar imaging 
performed with a frame rate of 0.25 Hz, which is characteristic also of conventional 
hemodynamic fMRI. Image contrast changes were observed only when functional 
MaCaReNas were infused ipsilaterally to the stimulated MFB, and not under control 
conditions with contralateral stimulation or calcium-insensitive LCIOs (Figure 4b–d). The 
magnitude of the average observed response was 13 ± 2%, comparable to the chemical 
stimulation paradigms of Figure 3, but here the response was evoked within seconds and 
peaked near the stimulus offset time (Figure 4c). This onset profile is similar to that reported 
previously using a closely-related stimulation paradigm in conjunction with a dopamine-
sensitive MRI contrast agent24, reflecting the possibility that activation of MFB dopamine 
fibers contributes substantially to the observed calcium response.
Unlike dopamine time courses, which return to baseline shortly after MFB stimulation, the 
calcium-dependent signal remained elevated above baseline for several minutes before 
decreasing again, suggesting that [Ca2+]o stays suppressed over this time. To determine 
whether this prolonged effect is truly indicative of underlying cellular activity, we recorded 
single unit activity from dorsal striatum during the same stimulus paradigm used for the 
molecular fMRI experiments. Measurements revealed that many striatal neurons experienced 
firing rate changes that persisted for about 2-3 mins following the MFB stimulus, paralleling 
the MRI results (Figure 4e). While subsets of the neuronal population showed increases or 
decreases in activity, the overall population showed a 26% increase in mean firing rate, 
which was highly significant with t-test p < 0.0001 (Figure 4f). Comparisons between pre- 
and post-stimulus average spike rates were highly significant in all three groups, with t-test p 
< 0.0001. The trends in neural spike rates we observed were qualitatively comparable to 
previously published recordings that demonstrated protracted changes in neuronal firing in 
multiple brain regions following MFB stimulation27,28. These results thus suggest that the 
time course of MaCaReNa responses primarily reflects the natural dynamics of neural 
activity elicited by MFB stimulation, perhaps arising in part from postsynaptic striatal 
dopamine receptor activation, rather than kinetic characteristics of the sensors themselves.
Our findings thus demonstrate a molecular imaging paradigm suitable for monitoring 
[Ca2+]o dynamics in the interstitial space of the brain over biologically-relevant intervals 
ranging from seconds to hours4,10. In doing so, the work extends an emerging set of methods

 available for molecular fMRI2. In addition, the results establish that magnetic nanoparticle 
aggregation-based MRI sensors can function reversibly in complex biological tissue, a 
principle that can apply to mechanistically-related probes29. Although biological side-effects 
of MaCaReNas were not explicitly ruled out, the probe doses used here were too low to 
substantially perturb [Ca2+]o homeostasis through buffering (Ca2+ binding capacity of 
injected sensors was < 10 μM), and previous studies have found that coated nanoparticles in 
the applied concentration range exhibit little toxicity30.
Future applications of MaCaReNa imaging could include characterization of extracellular 
calcium signaling in animal models, mechanisms that govern [Ca2+]o fluctuations, and 
relationships of extracellular calcium to diverse biological phenomena in the brain and other 
organs. Future work should also address current challenges of the method, such as a need for 
faster measurements and more rigorous quantification of [Ca2+]o. Building on the initial 
results presented here, MaCaReNas could be further optimized for neuroimaging 
applications by tuning their Ca2+ affinities more precisely to concentrations in the 0.8-1.2 
mM range and by reducing the particle size to promote faster response kinetics and 
improved probe distribution. Minimally invasive or fully non-invasive probe delivery 
methods, such as those employing ultrasound-assisted or receptor-mediated trans-blood-
brain barrier transport, will also be important for applications that take full advantage of the 
whole-brain imaging capabilities of MRI.
METHODS
Animals
All animal experiments were performed following approval of the MIT Committee on 
Animal Care, and in accordance with Institutional and NIH guidelines. A total of 26 rats 
were used for data presented in this paper. All animals were male Sprague-Dawley rats, 8-10 
weeks of age; they were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Animals were housed 
and maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Sample 
sizes for all animal experiments were chosen such that between-group comparisons provided 
a power of 0.8 when detecting 10% signal differences between groups using two-tailed t-
tests with α = 0.05, assuming within-group standard deviations of approximately 5%.
Atomic force microscopy
30 μL of a sample solution was deposited onto a V-1 quality muscovite mica disc (Electron 
Microscopy Sciences) freshly cleaved using adhesive tape. The mica was incubated in a 
Petri dish for 30 min, rinsed with 1 mL of deionized water, and then dried initially with 
compressed air. The mica was further dried overnight at room temperature and protected 
from dust contamination. The prepared sample was measured in air using a Multimode 8 
atomic force microscope equipped with a SCANASYST-AIR cantilever (Bruker 
Instruments) operated in soft tapping mode.

 Dynamic light scattering
Dynamic light scattering was performed using a DynaPro DLS system (Wyatt Technology) 
with a 1 s integration time at 22 °C. The laser power was adjusted so that all the samples 
gave scattering light intensity the order of 105 counts s−1.
Preparation of lipid-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (LCIOs)
4.5 mg of L-α-phosphatidylcholine from hen egg (Avanti Polar Lipids) and 1.5 mg of L-α-
phosphatidylserine from porcine brain (Avanti Polar Lipids) were dissolved in 250 μL of 
chloroform. 50 μL of 5 mg Fe/mL iron oxide nanoparticle solution (10 nm with oleic acid 
coating in chloroform, Ocean NanoTech) was mixed with the lipid solution and the mixture 
was thoroughly evaporated to obtain an even brown lipid film. 200 μL of 10 mM HEPES 
buffer (pH 7.4) was added into the lipid film and sonicated until the entire brown layer was 
homogenously dispersed into the buffer, yielding a brown transparent solution. The mixture 
was applied into a magnetic μ column placed into a μMACS magnetic separator (Miltenyi 
Biotec), and washed four times with 50 μL buffer aliquots. Purified solution was eluted by 
removing the column from the magnet and adding 150 μL of the buffer. The eluate was 
centrifuged at 6000g for 10 min to remove large aggregates and then the supernatant was 
filtered using a 0.1 μm syringe top filter. The final resulting concentration of LCIOs was 
quantified from absorbance at 450 nm using a molar absorbance coefficient ε450 = 690 (M 
Fe)−1 cm−1, which in turn was determined by a colorimetric assay using 
bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid31.
Purification of C2AB
Escherichia coli (BL21) expressing 6xHis-tagged C2AB was generously provided by Dr. 
Jihye Lee and Prof. J. Troy Littleton (MIT). 6xHis-tagged C2AB was purified according to 
published procedures17, with minor modifications. Briefly, E. coli cells harboring the tagged 
C2AB gene were grown in 5 mL of LB medium with 50 μg/mL of ampicillin at 37 °C 
overnight. 100 mL of LB/ampicillin medium was inoculated with 1 mL of the overnight 
culture and grown to OD600 = 0.6 for 2–3 h at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by 
adding 1 mL of 1 M isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) during vigorous 
shaking. 4 hours after adding IPTG, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 20 
min at 4 °C. The obtained cell pellet (~ 1 g) was stored at −80 °C overnight and 
subsequently lysed by addition of 5 mL of BugBuster reagent (EMD Millipore), 10 μL of 
Lysonase Bioprocessing Reagent (EMD Millipore), and 50 μL of P8849 protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lysate was vortexed quickly and nutated gently for 15 
min at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12000g for 20 min at 4 °C to 
pellet insoluble material. Collected supernatant was added to a column partially filled with 1 
mL of Ni-NTA Superflow Resin (Qiagen) and previously pre-equilibrated with binding 
buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). The loaded column 
was nutated for 1 h at 4 °C to promote protein binding. The resin was washed four times 
using 5 mL of wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.1% 
Tween 20, pH 8.0) and four times using 5 mL of wash buffer without Tween 20. Then 
protein was eluted by addition of 1 mL of elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 
250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). The eluate was concentrated and exchanged into experimental

 buffer conditions using a 10K Amicon Ultra filter (EMD Millipore). Protein purity was 
assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein 
concentration was determined using the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific).
Cloning of C2ABCa−
The calcium binding sites of C2AB were determined from structural data32 and Ca2+ 
binding residues were mutated to alanine in silico using Serial Cloner software 
(www.serialbasics.free.fr). The resulting mutant sequence was ordered as a synthetic DNA 
fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies). The fragment was ligated into the original C2AB 
plasmid using, NEBuilder assembly enzymes (New England Biolabs).
Biolayer interferometry
BLI was performed on an Octet Red biolayer interferometry instrument (Pall ForteBio). 
C2AB was attached to the sensor probes via adhesion to an Ni-NTA coated tip. Binding 
kinetics were monitored following submersion of the C2AB-bound tip in aCSF containing 
1.2 mM Ca2+ and 1 nM LCIOs (100 μM Fe). Dissociation rates were measured by then 
transferring the tips to calcium-free aCSF after briefly washing excess LCIOs off in 
complete aCSF. Kinetics data was analyzed using custom written MATLAB (MathWorks) 
scripts.
In vitro MRI
In vitro magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed with a 7 T Biospec MRI scanner 
(Bruker). Samples were arrayed into bisected 384-well microtiter plates and imaged using a 
volume tranceiver coil. A multislice multiecho (MSME) pulse sequence was used to obtain 
T2-weighted images, with typical parameters including matrix size = 256 × 256, field of 
view (FOV) = 5 cm × 5 cm, slice thickness = 2 mm, repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, echo 
spacing with echo time (TE) = 8 ms, and number of echoes = 30. T2 values were obtained by 
exponential fitting to MRI intensities as a function of echo time. Relaxivity (r2) values were 
defined by two-point measurements of the slopes between 1/T2 of aCSF without 
nanoparticles and 1/T2 of aCSF containing 100 μM Fe nanoparticles, and are reported as the 
mean and standard errors of the mean (SEM) of measurements performed in triplicate. 
Relaxivity titrations were performed in aCSF with varying concentrations of calcium. 
Measurement of the reversibility of r2 changes was performed in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM 
NaCl, pH 7.4, with addition of excesses of CaCl2 and EDTA to achieve alternation between 
0 mM and 1 mM Ca2+. Use of a lower ionic strength buffer for this experiment limited 
effects of the accumulation of CaCl2 and EDTA throughout the procedure but resulted in 
slightly greater r2 values than observed in aCSF under high calcium conditions.
Ex vivo MRI and analysis of nanoparticle infusion
To measure brain volumes affected by infusion of nanoparticle mixtures, animals were 
injected with 200/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine after MRI experiments and cardiac perfused 
with cold phosphate buffered saline with 10 units/mL heparin followed by 4% 
paraformaldehyde. Animals were then prepared for high resolution postmortem imaging

 according to published procedures33. Animals were decapitated and tissue was stripped from 
skull before incubating in 1 mM gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for 96 h at 
4 °C. The resulting fixed, contrast enhanced samples were then scanned with 100 μm 
isotropic resolution using a gradient echo pulse sequence implemented with TR/TE = 250/35 
ms on the 7 T scanner. Rat brains were manually segmented for analysis and areas of 
hypointensity were further segmented from the 3D datasets by placing a seed value at the 
center of the injection area and thresholding at ±10% of the seed signal intensity. All 3D 
analysis was done using the segmentation editor in FIJI (http://fiji.sc/).
Cannula implantation and brain infusion of nanoparticle mixtures
Nanoparticle mixtures formulated for brain infusion included 1 nM LCIOs (100 μM Fe) 
alone or mixed with 2.5 μM C2AB protein (for MaCaReNas), 2.5 μM C2ABCa− (for control 
LCIO/C2ABCa− mixtures). All of these mixtures were formulated in calcium-free aCSF 
(125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3), 
supplemented with 5 mM EGTA. Prior to infusion of these solutions, animals were 
anesthetized with ~2% isoflurane, shaved, and mounted in a rodent stereotaxic device 
(David Kopf Instruments); heart rates and blood oxygenation were monitored by a pulse 
oximeter (Nonin Medical). Each animal’s scalp was retracted and 28G holes were drilled 
into the skull above desired injection sites. 28G cannula guides that projected 2 mm below 
the surface of the skull (Plastics One) were implanted using SEcure light curing dental 
cement (Parkell, Inc.) and 33G metal injection cannulae that projected 5 mm below the skull 
were lowered to the appropriate depth through the holes. All injections were targeted to the 
caudate nucleus, coordinates 1 mm anterior, 3 mm lateral, and 5 mm ventral to bregma as 
chosen based on a standard rat brain atlas34. Nanoparticle infusions were performed using an 
injection rate of 0.12 μL/min for 1 h with control vs. test sides alternated for each 
experiment to negate potential artifacts or bias. Metal cannulae were then removed and 
animals were transferred to an MRI rat imaging cradle (Bruker). Plastic cannulae for 
delivery of control and stimulatory agents during MRI were then lowered bilaterally through 
the guide cannulae to the contrast agent delivery sites, and subsequently fixed in place with 
ETC light curing dental cement (Parkell).
Calcium-dependent molecular fMRI with chemical brain stimulation
In vivo MRI measurements were obtained using a 9.4 T Biospec MRI scanner (Bruker) 
operating with a cross coil volume transmit, surface receive configuration. Rapid acquisition 
with refocused echoes (RARE) pulse sequences were used to acquire T2-weighted 
anatomical and functional images. Imaging parameters for anatomical images included 
number of averages = 6, matrix size = 300 × 200, FOV = 3 cm × 2 cm, slice thickness = 1.2 
mm, TR = 5000 ms, effective TE = 60 ms, RARE factor = 8. Imaging parameters for 
functional imaging scan series were matrix size = 75 × 50, FOV = 3 cm × 2 cm, slice 
thickness = 1.2 mm, TR = 3000 ms, effective TE = 90, RARE factor = 8. Acquisition time 
per image frame was 12 s. Chemical stimuli delivered during molecular fMRI experiments 
consisted of pulsed injections of complete aCSF supplemented by 100 mM KCl, 100 mM 
NaCl (control), or 1 mM glutamate, and delivered at a rate of 0.12 μL/min during continuous 
image acquisition. Each experiment consisted of a two minute pre-stimulation period,

 followed by 5 min of stimulation and 10 min of rest. Three stimulations were performed for 
each animal.
Calcium-dependent molecular fMRI with electrical brain stimulation
Rats were purchased with pre-implanted jugular catheters (Charles River). After 
acclimation, unipolar electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the MFB. Guide cannulae 
for striatal sensor infusion were implanted as described above, and headposts to fix their 
heads in place during imaging were attached above the sagittal suture using dental cement. 
The rats were allowed 3-7 days for recovery then anesthetized and infused with MaCaReNa 
sensor doses as per previous methods. Animals were then intubated via a tracheotomy, 
transferred to lighter chemical anesthesia with medetomidine (1 mg/kg IP), and paralyzed 
with pancuronium (2 mg/kg IP) to prevent motion artifacts during stimulation. Upon 
paralysis, animals were transferred to a small animal respirator (Inspira; Harvard 
Apparatus), and fixed via their headposts into a custom built cradle for imaging. Once 
positioned in the magnet, medetomidine (1 mg/kg/h) and pancuronium (2 mg/kg/h) were 
delivered continuously via an IP catheter, along with Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-
NAME, 100 mg/kg/h IV) to suppress the hemodynamic signals. After 45 min of acclimation 
to these conditions, functional imaging was performed using T2 weighted spin echo echo 
planar imaging (TE = 60 ms, TR = 4 s). During each animal’s scan session, stimulation was 
applied in five epochs consisting of two minutes baseline, 24 s MFB stimulation (0.3 mA, 
200 Hz, 1 ms pulses, 75% duty cycle consisting of 3 s trains separated by 1 s between trains) 
and then five minutes of recovery before the next epoch.
Electrophysiology with electrical brain stimulation
Animals were prepared similarly to MRI studies. Immediately after implantation of the 
stimulation electrodes, animals were paralyzed, and anesthesia was switched to 
medetomidine. Using a micromanipulator (MP-285; Sutter Instrument Company), a 16 
channel laminar probe (A1x16-10mm-100-177-A16; Neuronexus Technologies) was 
lowered into the dorsal striatum (~5 mm) through a previously drilled craniotomy (0.2 mm 
anterior and 3.0 mm lateral to bregma). Extracellular signals recorded via the electrodes 
were amplified using a 1x gain headstage (model E2a; Plexon Inc.) connected to a 50x 
preamp (PBX-247; Plexon) and digitalized at 50 kHz. A 250 Hz high-pass filtered was 
applied on the raw signal and single units were sorted using the Offline Sorter software 
(Plexon) based on their principal components, peak-valley, and non-linear energy ratio prior 
to sorting units. Time stamps of the sorted units were exported to MATLAB and post-
stimulus time histograms and further statistics were computed using custom procedures. The 
sample size of neurons were chosen such that between-group comparisons provided a power 
of 0.95 and significance defined by two-tailed t-tests with α = 0.05.
Behavioral assessment of intracranial self-stimulation
Behavior experiments were performed in a plexiglass operant chamber (28 × 21 × 21 cm; 
Lafayette Instruments). One infrared nose poke sensor was positioned at one end of the 
operant chamber. Input from the nose poke sensor was recorded via a digital input/output 
interface (National Instruments). Such input triggered MFB stimulation in 3 s trains of 200 
Hz, 0.3 mA, 1 ms electrical pulses, identical to the stimuli used in the fMRI experiments.

 Two animals were shaped to the task and then tested over ten 60 s trials each, with an inter-
trial interval of 10 s. Input and output events for every trial were recorded and analyzed by 
custom-written computer scripts implemented in C and MATLAB to generate data presented 
in Supplementary Figure S7.
MRI data analysis
Images were reconstructed using Paravision software (Bruker) and further analyzed using 
custom routines implemented in MATLAB. For quantitative analysis of signal changes 
induced by injection of MaCaReNas, LCIOs, or LCIO/C2ABCa− mixtures (Figure 2), 
regions of interest (ROIs) were determined by manually selecting the centroids of apparent 
nanoparticle-induced hypointensity from MRI images. Signal change values were 
determined by averaging observed intensities within a 3 × 3 pixel (1.2 × 1.2 mm) square 
around these centroids. In each case, the percent signal change (%SC) was determined as the 
difference between mean MRI intensity in each injection site ROI (Sinj) and the mean 
intensity in a reference ROI positioned medial to the infusion zones (Sref), such that %SC = 
100 • (Sinj − Sref)/Sref. Reported values are averaged over animals, with corresponding SEM.
Quantitative analysis of chemical stimulus-induced molecular fMRI signal changes (Figure 
3) was performed on data converted on a per-voxel basis to percent signal change from 
baseline, according to the following relationship: %SC = 100 • [S(t) − Sbase]/Sbase, where 
S(t) is the signal at any arbitrary time point and Sbase is the mean signal observed during the 
two minute pre-stimulation period. Signal time courses for each animal were determined by 
manually selecting a brain hemisphere and then using an operator-blind algorithm to identify 
the centroids of apparent nanoparticle-induced hypointensity from MRI images. This ROI 
was defined around the pixel of peak signal change averaged over two minutes centered at 
the endpoint of injection, and averaging %SC values around this pixel over a 1.2 × 1.2 mm 
square ROI. These time courses were temporally smoothed over a moving window of 1 min, 
baseline corrected to remove linear drift (for multiple stimulus experiments only), and each 
series of stimulus responses was averaged over multiple animals to obtain mean time courses 
and corresponding error margins (SEMs) for each experimental condition. Percent signal 
change amplitudes for each stimulus type were defined as follows: %SC = 100 • (Sstim − 
Sbase)/Sbase, where Sbase is the MRI signal intensity observed during the 2 min pre-stimulus 
baseline and Sstim is the MRI signal observed during a 2 min window around the stimulant 
infusion offset time. Signal change slopes associated with response to and recovery from 
stimulation were determined by linear fitting to the 5 minute stimulant infusion periods and 
10 min post-infusion periods, respectively. The distribution of signal change amplitudes and 
slope values from multiple animals are presented as box plots. Only experimental sessions 
that were prematurely terminated due to major technical failures were excluded from 
analysis.
For the MFB stimulation experiments of Figure 4, baseline measurements, conversion to 
%SC, and ROI selection were again performed as described above. Responses to all five 
stimuli presented to each animal were averaged together before ROI analysis, and ROIs were 
centered around the pixel of maximum response within a 20 s window centered about the 
endpoint of stimulation. Stimulation traces from each animal were averaged and smoothed

 over a 20 s window; traces presented in Figure 4c represent the mean and SEM time courses 
from multiple animals. Percent signal change amplitudes presented in Figure 4d were 
defined as %SC = 100 • (Sstim − Sbase)/Sbase, where Sbase is the mean baseline MRI signal 
intensity and Sstim is the MRI signal observed during a 60 s window beginning at the 
stimulus offset time; box plots depict data from multiple animals.

 Figure 3. MaCaReNas report dynamic Ca2+ fluctuations in living rat brains
(a) K+ infusion (100 mM, 0.12 μL/min) induces molecular fMRI signal increases in the 
presence of MaCaReNa sensors (right) but not calcium-insensitive LCIO/C2ABCa− controls 
(left). Signal change amplitudes indicated by the color scale are superimposed on a 
grayscale anatomical image for a representative rat (out of 4). (b) Signal change time 
courses near areas of contrast agent delivery show that K+ infusion (gray shading) in the 
presence of MaCaReNas induces clear responses (red trace), while 100 mM Na+ infusion in 
the presence of MaCaReNas (purple trace) and K+ infusion in the presence of LCIO/
C2ABCa− controls (blue trace) barely affects MRI signal. (c) Average time course (red trace) 
of three consecutive K+ stimuli (gray shading) shows reproducibility of MaCaReNa 
responses (n = 4). Images above the trace correspond to dotted box in (a) and illustrate mean 
signal change from pre-stimulus baseline as a function of time (1.4 min average per image 
frame). (d) Dynamic signal changes in response to brain stimulation by glutamate infusion 
(1 mM, 0.12 μL/min) in the presence of MaCaReNas (red trace) and in the presence of 
LCIO/C2ABCa− (blue trace). (e) Average signal changes (response at stimulus offset time, 
minus baseline) measured under each of the stimulation conditions in (b) and (d). 
MaCaReNas (M) in the presence of K+ or glutamate (Glu) were significantly different from 
LCIO/C2ABCa− controls (LC) and MaCaReNas in the presence of Na+ (p ≤ 0.027 and n = 4 
for all groups). (f) Comparison of slopes for response onset (dark red) and recovery (light 
red) for K+ and glutamate stimulation. Recovery slopes were significantly less negative for 
glutamate stimulation, indicative of longer lasting [Ca2+]o depression (p = 0.04, n = 4). All 
shading indicates SEM; box plots indicate median (center line), first quartiles (box edges),

ipsilateral stimulation in the presence of control LCIO particles (gray). Stimulus pulse trains 
indicated by green vertical lines; shaded regions indicate SEM over multiple animals (n = 4 
for MaCaReNas, n = 3 for controls). (d) Mean signal changes during the immediate post-
stimulus interval for all conditions. MaCaReNas with ipsilateral stimulation were 
significantly different from both the contralateral stimulation condition and with the LCIO 
control result (p < 0.05). (e) Single unit recordings in dorsal striatum using the MFB 
stimulus paradigm. Prolonged post-stimulus excitation (top) or depression (bottom) of 
subpopulations of units parallels the molecular fMRI time course. Mean spike rates shown 
with SEM over units (shading); representative rasters shown above each time course. (f) 
Mean spike rates before vs. after MFB stimulation for excited units (n = 9), inhibited units 
(n = 12), and all units (n = 38) recorded from two animals. All differences were significant 
with p < 0.0001 when comparing 30 two-second bins before vs. after stimulation. Box plots 
indicate median (center line), first quartiles (box edges), and second quartiles (whiskers); red
