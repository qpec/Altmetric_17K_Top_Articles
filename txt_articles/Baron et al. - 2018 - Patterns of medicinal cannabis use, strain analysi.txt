Abstract
Background: Medicinal cannabis registries typically report pain as the most common reason for use. It would be
clinically useful to identify patterns of cannabis treatment in migraine and headache, as compared to arthritis and
chronic pain, and to analyze preferred cannabis strains, biochemical profiles, and prescription medication
substitutions with cannabis.
Methods: Via electronic survey in medicinal cannabis patients with headache, arthritis, and chronic pain,
demographics and patterns of cannabis use including methods, frequency, quantity, preferred strains, cannabinoid
and terpene profiles, and prescription substitutions were recorded. Cannabis use for migraine among headache
patients was assessed via the ID Migraine™ questionnaire, a validated screen used to predict the probability of
migraine.
Results: Of 2032 patients, 21 illnesses were treated with cannabis. Pain syndromes accounted for 42.4% (n = 861)
overall; chronic pain 29.4% (n = 598;), arthritis 9.3% (n = 188), and headache 3.7% (n = 75;). Across all 21 illnesses,
headache was a symptom treated with cannabis in 24.9% (n = 505). These patients were given the ID Migraine™
questionnaire, with 68% (n = 343) giving 3 “Yes” responses, 20% (n = 102) giving 2 “Yes” responses (97% and 93%
probability of migraine, respectively). Therefore, 88% (n = 445) of headache patients were treating probable
migraine with cannabis. Hybrid strains were most preferred across all pain subtypes, with “OG Shark” the most
preferred strain in the ID Migraine™ and headache groups. Many pain patients substituted prescription medications
with cannabis (41.2–59.5%), most commonly opiates/opioids (40.5–72.8%). Prescription substitution in headache
patients included opiates/opioids (43.4%), anti-depressant/anti-anxiety (39%), NSAIDs (21%), triptans (8.1%), anti-
convulsants (7.7%), muscle relaxers (7%), ergots (0.4%).

Conclusions: Chronic pain was the most common reason for cannabis use, consistent with most registries. The
majority of headache patients treating with cannabis were positive for migraine. Hybrid strains were preferred in ID
Migraine™, headache, and most pain groups, with “OG Shark”, a high THC (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol)/THCA
(tetrahydrocannabinolic acid), low CBD (cannabidiol)/CBDA (cannabidiolic acid), strain with predominant terpenes β-
caryophyllene and β-myrcene, most preferred in the headache and ID Migraine™ groups. This could reflect the
potent analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-emetic properties of THC, with anti-inflammatory and analgesic
properties of β-caryophyllene and β-myrcene. Opiates/opioids were most commonly substituted with cannabis.
Prospective studies are needed, but results may provide early insight into optimizing crossbred cannabis strains,
synergistic biochemical profiles, dosing, and patterns of use in the treatment of headache, migraine, and chronic
pain syndromes.

Background
The legal use of medicinal cannabis continues to in-
crease globally, including the United States. At the time
of this writing, there are currently 29 states which have
legalized medicinal cannabis, 9 states and Washington
DC which have legalized both medicinal and recreational
cannabis use, and 18 states which have legalized canna-
bidiol (CBD)-only bills.
The use of medicinal cannabis for a multitude of
health maladies, particularly chronic pain, has been well
described through ancient, historical, and current times,
and well supported through the medical literature [1–28].
In 2017, The National Academies of Sciences, Engineer-
ing, and Medicine published a statement that the use of
cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-
controlled clinical trials and that there is substantial evi-
dence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic
pain in adults [24]. In 2014, the Canadian Pain Society
revised their consensus statement to recommend cannabi-
noids as a third-level therapy for chronic neuropathic pain
given the evidence of cannabinoid efficacy in the treat-
ment of pain with a combined number needed to treat
(NNT) of 3.4 [25]. Most medicinal cannabis registries
report that chronic pain is the most common indication
for use [29–39]. However, most of these registries do
not further differentiate chronic pain into different
pain subsets.
Supporting evidence also exists for cannabis/cannabi-
noids in the treatment of migraine and/or chronic migraine
[1, 40–56], cluster headache [56–59], chronic headaches
[13, 44, 60, 61], medication overuse headache [62], idio-
pathic intracranial hypertension [63], and multiple sclerosis
associated trigeminal neuralgia [64]. Publications detailing
this headache, migraine, and facial pain literature, as well as
described mechanisms of pain relief with cannabis and
cannabinoids are available and should be reviewed, but are
beyond the scope of this paper [1, 2, 28, 51, 65]. At the time
of this writing, the limited supporting headache literature
consists of one retrospective analysis, numerous case series,
case studies, and case reports, clinical/anecdotal reports,
and surveys. There are no placebo-controlled studies of
cannabis for headache disorders, although a multicenter,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy
and safety of a synthetic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
Dronabinol, in a metered dose inhaler for the treatment of
migraine with and without aura has been completed, but
results
not
available
[66].
There
are
only
two
prospective trials containing a control group evaluating
the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of headache
disorders, specifically chronic migraine, cluster headache,
and medication overuse headache [56, 62].
The first of these two prospective trials was a random-
ized, double-blind, active-controlled crossover trial with
treatment
refractory
medication
overuse
headache
(MOH) with daily analgesic intake for at least 5 years
and several failed detoxification attempts. Patients com-
pleted a course of either Ibuprofen 400 mg or Nabilone
0.5 mg daily for 8 weeks, had a 1 week washout, then a
second 8 weeks of the other medication. Results showed
that Nabilone 0.5 mg daily, a synthetic cannabinoid, was
superior in reducing daily analgesic intake, pain intensity,
level of medication dependence, and improved quality of
life in these patients [62].
The second prospective trial evaluated the use of
cannabinoids as both a prophylaxis and acute treatment
for both chronic migraine and chronic cluster headache
[56]. Patients were given one of two compounds con-
taining 19% THC or a combination of 0.4% THC + 9%
CBD. In phase 1, dose finding observations to determine
effective dosing was performed with a group of 48
chronic migraineurs. It was found that doses less than
100 mg produced no benefit, while an oral dose of
200 mg administered during a migraine attack decreased
acute pain intensity by 55%, which was the dose used in
phase 2. In phase 2, chronic migraine patients were
assigned to 3 months prophylaxis treatment with either

Page 2 of 28
 25 mg per day of Amitriptyline or THC + CBD 200 mg
per day. Chronic cluster headache patients were assigned
to 1 month prophylaxis treatment with either Verapamil
480 mg per day or THC + CBD 200 mg per day. For
acute pain attacks, additional dosing of THC + CBD
200 mg was allowed in both groups. In the migraine
patients, the THC + CBD 200 mg prophylaxis provided a
40.4% improvement versus 40.1% with Amitriptyline. In
the cluster headache patients, the THC + CBD 200 mg
prophylaxis gave minimal to no benefit. Additional acute
THC + CBD 200 mg dosing decreased pain intensity in
migraine patients by 43.5%. This same result was seen in
cluster headache patients, but only if they had a history
of migraine in childhood. In cluster headache patients
without a previous history of childhood migraine, the
additional THC-CBD 200 mg abortive treatment pro-
vided no benefit as an acute treatment.
It is unclear whether certain types of pain may re-
spond better to certain cannabis strains with specific
combinations of cannabinoids, terpenes, or other bio-
chemical properties. There have been a multitude of
studies showing benefit in many forms of chronic pain,
but there have been no studies attempting to differenti-
ate which types and strains of cannabis along with asso-
ciated compositions of cannabinoids and terpenes may
be more effective for certain subsets of pain. This infor-
mation would be of great clinical use in providing
direction for treatment recommendations by healthcare
providers.
Methods
Appropriate Investigational Review Boards approved the
survey. A French and English electronic survey was sent
to 16,675 Tilray medicinal cannabis patients. Tilray is a
federally authorized medical cannabis production, distri-
bution, and research company in Nanaimo, British
Columbia. Data gathering was performed with REDCap
(Research Electronic Data Capture), a HIPAA and
PIPEDA compliant secure web application for building
and managing online surveys and databases. A $10
account credit was offered to each patient completing
the online survey, funded by Tilray. There was a re-
sponse of 3405 (3390 English and 15 French), 2032 of
which provided a verifiable Tilray patient number and
were therefore included in the final analysis. The re-
sponses represent 12% of those reached. Recruitment
was deliberately halted at 2000 (overlap with additional
32 subjects represents participants who were in the mid-
dle of completing the survey when it was halted). The
survey launched at 9 AM PST on Monday January 9th
2017 and closed on Wednesday January 11th 2017 at
5 PM PST. The limit to responses was due to financial
constraints, and patients were informed that the survey
would be available for a two-week period or until limit
was reached, whichever came first.
An estimation of migraine prevalence among those
surveyed was obtained by incorporating the ID Mi-
graine™ questionnaire [67] into the survey, which is
used to predict the probability of migraine. In the ID
Migraine™ questionnaire, the patient is given 3 questions.
If the patient answers “Yes” to 3 of these questions, there
is a 97% chance they have migraine. If they answer “Yes”
to 2 of these questions, there is a 93% chance they have
migraine. The questions are: 1) Have your headaches
interfered with your ability to work, study, or do what you
needed to do? 2) Have you felt nauseated or sick to your
stomach when you have a headache? 3) Does light bother
you when you have a headache (a lot more than when you
don’t have a headache)?
Patients were asked a multitude of additional ques-
tions involving demographics, primary illnesses and
symptoms treated with cannabis, frequency and quantity
of use, favorite cannabis types and strains, methods of
use, and prescription drugs substituted with cannabis.
Patients who reported headache as the primary illness
were compared with each patient group reporting a
diagnosis other than headache as the primary illness.
Separately, patients who reported headache as the pri-
mary symptom (regardless of diagnosis) were compared
with each patient group who both reported a diagnosis
other than headache as the primary illness and also did
not report headache as the primary symptom. Statistical
methods were the same for each set of comparisons.
Pearson chi-squared tests, or Fisher’s exact tests where
appropriate, were used to compare headache patients
with each non-headache patient group, with regards to
five cannabis strains: Hybrid, Indica, Sativa, 3:1 CBD:
THC, and 1:1 CBD:THC. Significance for omnibus chi-
squared tests was designated by p < .05. When omnibus
chi-squared tests were found to be significant, pairwise
comparisons were carried out using a Bonferroni correc-
tion. Given ten pairwise comparisons per omnibus test,
significance for each pairwise comparison was indicated
by p < .005. Methods chosen to control for multiple
comparisons allow a moderately conservative level of
control, and reflect the exploratory nature of the study.
Analyses were two-tailed and performed using SAS
Studio v 3.5.
Results
Of the 2032 patients included in the survey, 1271 (62.6%)
were male, 758 (37.3%) were female, and 3 (0.15%) did not
specify gender. Ages ranged from 9 to 85 years old, with
an average age of 40. Reported ethnicities in the overall
cohort revealed 1839 (90.5%) Caucasian, 62 (3.1%)

patients reporting more than one ethnicity. Relation-
ship status showed 833 (41%) were married, 507
(25%) were single and never married, 274 (13.5%)
were in a domestic partnership or civil union, 203
(10%) were single but cohabiting with a significant

Habitation
showed 883 (43.5%) to be living in an urban area,
795 (39.1%) in a suburban area, and 354 (17.4%) in a
rural or remote area.
There were 21 primary illnesses that were reported as
being treated with medicinal cannabis, as seen in Table 1.
The subsets analyzed further were headache, chronic
pain, and arthritis. Chronic pain was the most frequently
reported primary illness for which medicinal cannabis
was being used at 29.4% (n = 598), arthritis was 9.3%
(n = 188), and headache was 3.7% (n = 75). Notably,
when combined these three categories of pain syn-
dromes accounted for 42.4% (n = 861) of the entire
medicinal cannabis users.
Headache was then evaluated as a primary symptom
being treated by medicinal cannabis across all primary
illnesses
(headache
was
the
major
symptom
being
treated with medicinal cannabis, among the primary ill-
ness categories), as seen in Table 2. There were 505
patients within the entire group surveyed (24.9%) who
reported headache as a primary symptom for which they
were using medicinal cannabis across all primary illness
categories. Of these patients, 262 (51.9%) were male, 241
(47.7%) were female, and 2 (0.40%) did not specify gen-
der. Ages ranged from 10 to 86 years old with an average
age of 38. Reported ethnicities revealed 453 (89.7%)
Caucasian, 23 (4.6%) Metis, 21 (4.2%) Aboriginal/First
Nation, 12 (2.4%) Other, 11 (2.2%) Hispanic (Mexican,
Central American, South America, etc.), 10 (2%) Asian
(Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, etc.), 8 (1.6%)
South Asian (East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, etc.),
and 4 (0.8%) Black (African, Caribbean, etc.), with many
patients reporting more than one ethnicity. Relationship
status showed 181 (36%) were married, 125 (24.8%) were
single and never married, 88 (17.4%) were in a domestic
partnership or civil union, 62 (12.3%) were single but
cohabiting with a significant other, 28 (5.5%) were
divorced, 18 (3.6%) were separated, and 3 (0.6%) were

 widowed. Habitation showed 218 (43.2%) to be living in
an urban area, 205 (40.6%) in a suburban area, and 82
(16.2%) in a rural or remote area. Chronic pain was the
most common primary illness in which headache was
reported to be a primary symptom being treated with
medicinal cannabis (29.3%), followed by mental health
condition (25.9%) and headache (14.9%).
The 505 patients who reported headache as a primary
symptom being treated by medicinal cannabis were then an-
alyzed to estimate how many of those patients had probable
migraine, and thus, how many were using medicinal canna-
bis for probable migraine management. This data was
obtained via responses to the ID Migraine™ questionnaire.
There were 343 (68%) who gave 3 “Yes” responses, and 102
(20%) who gave 2 “Yes” responses. Based on these re-
sponses, 445 of these 505 patients (88%) had a very high
probability between 93 and 97% that the headaches they
were treating with medicinal cannabis represented migraine.
Data was collected among patients to determine the
most commonly used and preferred types of cannabis, as
well as preferred specific strains. The preferred types of
cannabis included Indica, Sativa, Hybrid, 3:1 CBD:THC,
or 1:1 CBD:THC. Indicas, Sativas and Hybrids were all
high THC/low CBD strains or extracts, while 1:1 and 3:1
strains and extracts represent the CBD:THC ratio, and
were considered high CBD strains. The Indica, Sativa,
and Hybrid types were further divided into specific
strains within each of these cannabis types.
There were 42 different preferred treatment strains re-
ported by patients and these included: Afghani, Afghani
CBD, Alien OG, Barbara Bud, Black Tuna, Blueberry,
Bubba Kush, Cannatonic, CBD House Blend, Cheese,
Churchill, Dig Weed, Elwyn, Green Cush, Girl Scout
Cookies (GSC), Harmony, Headband, Hybrid House
Blend, Indica House Blend, Island Sweet Skunk, Jack
Herer, Jean Guy, Lemon Sour Diesel, Limonene House
Blend, Mango, Master Kush, Myrcene Blend, OG Kush,
OG Shark, Pinene House Blend, Pink Kush, Purple
Kush, Rockstar, Sativa House Blend, Sirius, Strawberry
Cough (SBC), Skywalker OG, Sour Diesel, Sweet Skunk
CBD, Warlock CBD, Watermelon, and White Widow.
Preferred cannabis types and strains were first ana-
lyzed between the headache as primary symptom, head-
ache as primary illness, chronic pain as primary illness,
and arthritis as primary illness groups. Hybrid strains
were the most commonly preferred cannabis types
across all pain groups. However, when patients with
headache as a primary symptom were excluded from the
groups, the arthritis group preferred Indica strains, while
the others still preferred Hybrid strains. The top 15 pre-
ferred cannabis strains within each of these pain groups
are seen in Tables 3 and 5. Preferred cannabis types and

 strains were then analyzed in the positive ID Migraine™
patients who answered 3 “Yes” responses (343), 2 “Yes”
responses (102), or combined 3 + 2 “Yes” responses
(445) to the ID Migraine™ questionnaire. Thus, they
were the most probable group of headache patients who
were treating migraine with medicinal cannabis. Hybrid
strains were the most commonly preferred cannabis
types across the positive ID Migraine™ groups with the
exception that the 2 “Yes” group had a slight preference
for Sativa, followed by Hybrid strains. The top 15
preferred cannabis strains within each positive ID Mi-
graine™ group are seen in Table 3. “OG Shark” was the
most commonly preferred strain across all of the positive
ID Migraine™ and headache as primary symptom groups.
Quantification and comparison of the cannabinoids and
terpenes present in these top 15 preferred strains is seen
in
Table
4.
The
cannabinoids
analyzed
were
Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC),
tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid (THCA), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabidiolic acid
(CBDA). The terpenes analyzed were α-pinene, β-
myrcene, D-limonene, linalool, β-caryophyllene, humu-
lene,
trans-nerolidol,
and
bisabolol.
Notably,
“OG
Shark”, a high THC/THCA, low CBD/CBDA strain with
β-caryophyllene followed by β-myrcene as the predom-
inant terpenes, was the most preferred strain in both
the positive ID Migraine™ and headache as primary
symptom groups.
For further comparison purposes, preferred cannabis
types and strains were also analyzed for the three most
common non-pain subsets of patients, which included
mental health condition/PTSD, insomnia/sleep disorder,
gastrointestinal disorder/Crohn’s Disease, and the overall
patient cohort, as seen in Table 5. Indica strains were
preferred in the insomnia/sleep disorders group, Sativa
strains in the mental health condition/PTSD group, and
Hybrid strains in the gastrointestinal disorder/Crohn’s
Disease group, regardless of whether patients with head-
ache as a primary symptom were included or not. Table 6
shows these same groups, as well as the arthritis and
chronic pain groups, with all groups excluding patients
with headache as a primary symptom.
Statistical analysis was performed to determine if there
were significant differences in preferred cannabis types
reported by headache patients. The data were insuffi-
cient for statistical analysis of specific strain preferences.
There were no statistically significant differences found
between patients with headache as primary illness and
those with chronic pain, arthritis, or mental health
condition/PTSD. When compared to insomnia/sleep dis-
order patients, headache as primary illness patients were
7.7 times as likely to prefer 3:1 CBD:THC over Indica
(OR 7.7, 95% CI 1.7-35.11, p = .003).
Patients with headache as primary symptom were 2.7
times as likely to prefer Sativa over 1:1 CBD:THC (OR
2.66, 95% CI 1.52-4.66, p < .001) when compared to
chronic pain patients. When compared to arthritis pa-
tients, headache as primary symptom patients were 3.4
times as likely to prefer Sativa over 1:1: CBD:THC
(OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.57-7.12, p = .001). When compared
to insomnia patients, headache as primary symptom

 patients were over twice as likely to prefer Sativa over
Indica (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.52, p = .001) and 8.7
times as likely to prefer 3:1 CBD:THC over Indica (OR
8.74, 95% CI 2.04-37.37, p < .001). When compared to
gastrointestinal
disorder/Crohn’s
disease
patients,
headache as primary symptom patients were almost
three times as likely to prefer Indica over Hybrid (OR
2.88, 95% CI 1.37-6.05, p = .004), 4.2 times as likely to
prefer Indica over 3:1 CBD:THC (OR 4.24, 95% CI
1.63-10.98, p = .002), and 5.8 times as likely to prefer
Indica over 1:1 THC:CBD (OR 5.76, 95% CI 2.17-15.26,
p < .001). There were no statistically significant differences
found between headache as primary symptom patients
and mental health condition/PTSD patients, nor between
all non-headache patients as a group.
A number of variables were assessed across all pain
groups. These variables included primary method of
cannabis use, prevalence of cannabis extract (drops,
capsules) use and preferences, cannabis quantity and
frequency of use, highest level of education com-
pleted, employment status, and prescription medica-
tions replaced with medicinal cannabis. The most
common primary methods of use across all pain
groups were vaporizing and joint use, although add-
itional methods included waterpipe/bong, oral (edibles
such as oil drops/extracts, baked goods, butter, tinc-
ture), pipe, juicing, tea, or topical use, as seen in
Table 7. In the 505 patients with headache as a pri-
mary symptom, the most common primary methods
of use were joint in 170 (33.7%), and vaporizing in
162 (32.1%), and this pattern was similar in the posi-
tive
ID
Migraine™
groups.
In
general,
primary
methods of use were similar to the top non-pain re-
lated primary illnesses, and the overall patient cohort.
The majority of patients using cannabis extracts
(drops, capsules) across pain groups preferred the 3:1
CBD:THC extract with the exception that the chronic
pain group preferred 1:1 CBD:THC extract, the 3 “Yes”
positive ID Migraine™ group preferred Indica extract,
and the combined 3 + 2 “Yes” positive ID Migraine™
group
equally
preferred
3:1
CBD:THC
and
Indica
extracts, as seen in Table 8. Overall, in the headache as
primary symptom group, 195 (38.6%) were using canna-
bis extracts, and the 3:1 CBD:THC extract was most
commonly used in 53 (27.2%) followed by the Indica
extract in 51 (26.2%).
Quantity of cannabis used was estimated as one
joint = 0.3-0.5 g, one eighth = 3.5 g, one quarter = 7 g,
and one ounce = 28 g. The quantity and frequency of
medicinal cannabis use across the groups ranged from
9.6-11.4 g/week, 1.4-1.7 g/day, 0.58-0.76 g/treatment,
5.9-6.5 days/week and 3.2-3.9 times/day. The quantity
of medicinal cannabis use in the headache group av-
eraged 11.4 g/week, 1.7 g/day, and 0.66 g/treatment,
with a frequency of 6.4 days/week, and 3.9 times/day.
The positive ID Migraine™ patients averaged similar
patterns of use, although at the upper ranges of use.
These results can all be seen in Table 9.

 The highest level of education completed across medi-
cinal cannabis user groups can be seen in Table 10.
Options included graduate degree, university degree
(Bachelors’ degree or equivalent), some college/univer-
sity but no degree/certificate, technical/non-university
degree, high school degree or equivalent (GED), and less
than high school degree. The most common education
level completed across all pain groups was technical/
non-university degree, including the headache group,
n = 158 (31.3%). The exception was in the 2 “Yes” posi-
tive ID Migraine™ group, which most commonly re-
ported some college/university but no degree/certificate.
Employment status among medicinal cannabis users
was assessed, and can be seen in Table 10. The options
were employed working full-time, employed working
part-time, retired, not employed looking for work, not
employed not looking for work, and disabled not able to
work. The vast majority of patients across all pain
groups were employed working full time, including the
headache group, n = 268 (53.1%).
Prescription medications that were replaced with medi-
cinal cannabis were also recorded, as seen in Table 11, and
included
opiates/opioids,
NSAIDs/analgesics,
triptans,
ergots, anti-depressant/anti-anxiety, anti-convulsant, and
muscle relaxers. Many patients across all groups had re-
placed prescription medications with medicinal cannabis,
including headache as primary symptom n = 272 (53.9%).
Ranges of prescription medication replacement across
pain groups varied between 41.2%-59.5% of patients. The
most common prescription medications replaced by medi-
cinal cannabis were opiates/opioids in every pain group,
including headache as primary symptom n = 118 (43.4%).
Ranges of opiate/opioid replacement across pain groups
varied between 40.5%-72.8% of patients. Notably, add-
itional prescription medications replaced by medicinal
cannabis in headache patients included 106 (39%) anti-
depressant/anti-anxiety, 57 (21%) NSAIDs, 22 (8.1%)
triptans, 21 (7.7%) anticonvulsants, 19 (7%) muscle re-
laxers, and 1 (0.4%) ergots.
Discussion
The neurobiological pathways of cannabinoids and pain,
including migraine and headache, have been detailed, sum-
marized and should be reviewed [1, 2, 51, 65, 68–70].
Briefly, the endocannabinoid system is distributed through-
out the central and peripheral nervous system, is involved

 in inflammatory and pain processing, and plays regu-
latory physiological roles across virtually every organ
system [19, 46, 71–74]. The endocannabinoid system
interacts within its own pathways, as well as within major
endogenous pain pathways, including inflammatory, endor-
phin/enkephalin,
vanilloid/transient
receptor
potential
cation channel subfamily V (TRPV), subfamily M (TRPM),
subfamily A (TRPA), and nuclear receptors/transcription
factors
called
the
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptors (PPAR) [75].
The activities of the endocannabinoid system are based
on the pre-synaptic G protein-coupled cannabinoid 1
(CB1) and 2 (CB2) receptors [76]. There is also a presumed
third cannabinoid receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 55
(GPR55), termed CB3 [77]. The primary endogenous can-
nabinoid receptor ligands (endogenous cannabinoids, or
endocannabinoids) are arachidonic acid derivatives, and
they work via retrograde signaling receptor activation.
The primary mediator of endocannabinoid signaling is
N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, or AEA),
and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is another primary
endocannabinoid [71, 78–80]. Cannabis-based phyto-
cannabinoids, as well as inherent endocannabinoids
interact at the CB1 and CB2 receptors with variable
affinities and actions [81–83].
The CB1 receptor is the most abundant G protein-
coupled receptor in the brain and one of the most abun-
dant in both the peripheral and central nervous system
[81]. CB1 receptors are expressed primarily on presynap-
tic peripheral and central nerve terminals, and are found
extensively through the anatomical pain pathways as well
as
many
other
neurological
central
and
peripheral

 locations [19, 84–87]. CB1 receptors are associated with
the “high” felt with some cannabis strains, activated by
THC.
Activation leads to hyperpolarization of the
pre-synaptic terminal, closing of calcium channels
with subsequent inhibition of released stored inhibi-
tory and excitatory neurotransmitters, including glu-
tamate,
5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-HT;
serotonin),
gamma-aminobutyric
acid
(GABA),
noradrenaline,
dopamine, acetylcholine, D-aspartate, and cholecystokinin
at inhibitory and excitatory synapses [19, 71, 73, 80, 86,
88–90], and can modulate pain pathways involving opioid,
serotonin, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors
through other indirect mechanisms [91].
The CB2 receptors are located primarily in the periph-
eral tissues and immune cells where they influence the
release of cytokines, chemokines, and cell migration in-
cluding neutrophils and macrophages, but do have some
presence in the central nervous system [18, 86, 92–95],
and may also contribute to pain relief by dopamine
release modulation [96, 97].
Over 540 phytochemicals have been described in canna-
bis [98], 18 different chemical classes, and more than 100
different phytocannabinoids, although some are break-
down products [99, 100]. THC and CBD have been the
most researched and are considered the major cannabi-
noids. There are many additional cannabinoids referred to
as minor cannabinoids. The quantities of major and minor
cannabinoids are widely variable between different types
of cannabis strains. There is evidence for analgesic and
anti-inflammatory effects in many of the cannabinoids,
and this publication will focus primarily on these proper-
ties for the cannabinoids assessed in this study. However,
a more extensive discussion and a comprehensive review
of other medicinal properties of these, as well as many
other cannabinoids, has been summarized and is available
[28]. The cannabinoids analyzed in this study were limited
to THC, THCA, CBD, and CBDA.
THC is one of the most researched cannabinoids, and
the cause of the psychoactive side effects of cannabis,
suspected from modulation of glutamate and GABA
systems [18, 83, 101–103]. It is a partial agonist at CB1
greater than CB2 receptors, which are its primary mech-
anisms of action. However, other mechanisms of action
reflect its activity as an agonist at the PPAR-γ and
TRPA1 receptors [83], a 5HT3A antagonist, a glycine re-
ceptor activation enhancer via allosteric modification, re-
duces elevated intracellular calcium levels from TRPM8
activity (cold and menthol receptor 1 (CMR1)), elevates
calcium levels by TRPA1 or TRPV2, and stimulates G Pro-
tein Receptor 18 and other nuclear receptors [104–113]. It
reduces NMDA responses by 30-40% [114–116], blocks
capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia [117], inhibits CGRP activ-
ity [118], increases cerebral 5HT production, decreases
5HT reuptake, and inhibits 5HT release from platelets, all
of which may influence trigeminovascular migraine cir-
cuitry [1, 68, 69, 119]. THC enhances analgesia from
kappa opioid receptor agonist medications [120–123],
stimulates production of beta-endorphin and increases
proenkephalin mRNA levels in brainstem regions in-
volved in pain processing [124–126], and intraventricu-
lar and intrathecal administration of THC produces
analgesia similar to opioids [127].
THC is 20 times more anti-inflammatory than aspirin,
twice as anti-inflammatory as hydrocortisone [128], and
has well documented analgesic and anti-inflammatory
benefits including arthritic and inflammatory conditions
[83, 114, 127, 129–156]. There have been many positive
studies across various chronic pain syndromes, showing
benefit of THC in trials with smoked or vaporized canna-
bis comparing between different doses of THC, with

 benefit often noted at higher percentages [28, 47, 157–
169]. However, compositions of other cannabinoids in-
cluding CBD, minor cannabinoids, and other import-
ant compounds such as terpenes were not assessed in
most of these trials. Given the entourage effects of
cannabis [100, 170], where cannabinoids and terpenes
influence activity of one another, resulting in strain-
specific characteristics, effects and responses, it is
often unclear if these studies showing positive (or
negative) effects of cannabis are due to the THC
alone, or due to synergy between undefined composi-
tions of other cannabinoids and terpenes.
There have been a multitude of studies confirming
benefit in various chronic pain syndromes with an oral-
mucosal spray called Nabiximols (Sativex) [171–196],
approved in 30 countries for various neurological symp-
toms. This is a tincture of cannabis made from cannabis
plants [197]. Each spray delivers a standardized dose of
2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD, along with additional
cannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes in unmeasured
small amounts. Despite the standardized THC:CBD
ratio, the actual concentrations of terpenes and other
compounds are unknown. This again creates uncertainty
as to what components are providing most of the bene-
fit, although entourage effects are again suspected. There
was also a study comparing between three varieties of
this spray; 1:1 THC:CBD vs. THC alone vs. CBD alone
and the sprays that contained THC showed the most
pain benefit, over CBD alone [179]. Other cannabis
extract studies of only THC and CBD in varying doses
also showed pain benefit, although these did not evalu-
ate each cannabinoid individually [187, 198].
The strong anti-emetic benefits of THC have also been
well documented in adults [26, 83, 129, 130, 199–238]
and children [235, 239–241], and migraine associated
nausea and vomiting would certainly be another benefit
of THC. In fact, the FDA has approved two synthetic
forms of THC in the treatment of chemotherapy related
nausea and vomiting; Dronabinol [242] and Nabilone
[243]. Notably, these synthetic THC medications have
also shown analgesic effects [55, 57, 62, 188, 244–256].
Besides THC, CBD is the other major cannabinoid. It
has gained a lot of attention over the past several years
due to its lack of any psychoactivity, as opposed to THC.
In November 2017, The World Health Organization
announced that in humans, CBD exhibits no evidence
for abuse or dependence potential, and there is no evi-
dence of public health related problems associated with
the use of pure CBD [257]. In January 2018, the World
Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) removed CBD from their
prohibited list, no longer banning use by athletes [258].
CBD has powerful analgesic
and anti-inflammatory
effects [23, 83, 114, 129–131, 137–140, 149, 259–281]
mediated by both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase
inhibition. Its anti-inflammatory effect is several hun-
dred times more potent than aspirin [128, 282], although
to date, there have been no clinical studies evaluating
pure CBD in headache or chronic pain disorders. CBD
has much lower affinity for CB1 or CB2 receptors, and
acts as an antagonist of CB1 and CB2 agonists such as
THC [276]. At low concentrations, its antagonism of
CB1 underlies its neutralizing effects on the CB1 agonist
THC side effects such as anxiety, tachycardia, and sed-
ation [283–288]. CBD appears to attenuate some of
these negative side effects of THC when the CBD:THC
ratio is at least 8:1 (± 11.1), but may potentiate some of
the THC side effects when the CBD:THC ratio is around
2:1 (± 1.4) [286, 288]. It is also an inverse agonist at the
CB2
receptor,
which
may
contribute
to
its
anti-
inflammatory effects [276].
CBD also interacts with a multitude of ion channels, en-
zymes, and other receptors [18, 83, 129, 130, 225, 259]. It
acts as a TRPV1 agonist, similar to capsaicin, although
without the noxious sides effects, and also inhibits AEA
uptake and metabolism [108–110, 289, 290]. It acts as a
positive allosteric modulator at α1 and α1β glycine recep-
tors [291], suggested to play a role in chronic pain after
inflammation or nerve injury since glycine acts as an in-
hibitory postsynaptic neurotransmitter in the dorsal horn
of the spinal cord. CBD acts as a μ opioid receptor ligand
and a positive allosteric modulator at μ and δ opioid re-
ceptors suggesting that it may enhance opiate effects [83].
Additional mechanisms of action suggested to reflect its
anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, as well as other
medicinal benefits, include TRPA1 agonist, TRPV1 agon-
ist, TRPM8 antagonist [108–110], TRPV2 agonist in which
it may mediate CGRP release from dorsal root ganglion
neurons [292], T-type calcium2+ channel inhibitor [293],
suppression of tryptophan degradation (precursor to 5HT)
[294], phospholipase A2 modulator [295], 5-HT1A agonist
[83, 296], regulator of intracellular calcium2+ [297, 298],
fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH; breaks down AEA)
inhibition [290], GPR55 antagonist [77], adenosine
uptake competitive inhibitor [299], PPARγ agonist [300],
5-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase inhibitors [301], and
antagonism of the abnormal-CBD receptor [83, 302].
Cannabinoid acids are the precursors to the cannabi-
noids in raw and live cannabis, and have no psychotropic
qualities. They are decarboxylated by heat, UV exposure,
and prolonged storage to form the active cannabinoids,
although heat such as from smoking or vaporizing is the
primary conversion factor. The two cannabinoid acids
assessed in this study were THCA, which converts to
THC, and CBDA, which converts to CBD.
THCA is a TRPA1 partial agonist [108], and TRPM8 an-
tagonist [108] which may underlie a potential role in anal-
gesia, and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory
[140] and anti-nausea properties [303]. CBDA is often

 obtained through consumption of raw cannabis juice. It is
a TRPA1 agonist [108], TRPV1 agonist [290], and
TRPM8 antagonist [108] which may also reflect its
potential as an analgesic. It is also anti-inflammatory
[130, 140, 304] via selective COX2 inhibition, and has
anti-nausea properties [237, 305].
The terpenes, or terpenoids, form the largest group of
phytochemicals [99], and account for some pharmaco-
logical properties of cannabis, as well as many medicinal
herbs, plants and essential oils. They are the source of
flavors, aromas, and other characteristics that help dif-
ferentiate cannabis strains. The terms terpenes and ter-
penoids are often used interchangeably in the literature,
although technically, terpenes are basic hydrocarbons,
while terpenoids contain extra functional groups of a
wide range of chemical elements. Cannabis contains up
to 200 different terpenes [100], and they are generally
classified as primary and secondary terpenes, based on
how frequent they occur in cannabis. They are lipophilic
with wide ranging mechanisms of action sites including
neurotransmitter receptors, G-protein receptors, muscle
and neuronal ion channels, enzymes, cell membranes,
and second messenger systems [100, 306, 307]. The ter-
penes work synergistically with the cannabinoids for a
variety of therapeutic effects, and this phenomenon is
known as the cannabis entourage effects [100, 170].
They have shown many medicinal benefits, including
anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties [308]. This
publication
will
focus
primarily
on
the
anti-
inflammatory and analgesic evidence for the terpenes
analyzed in this study, although a more extensive discus-
sion and a comprehensive review of other medicinal
properties of these, as well as many other terpenes has
been summarized and is available [28]. The majority of
this data comes from preclinical studies involving animal
models or in vitro studies, and some of the reported
benefits attributed to individual terpenes come from
studies evaluating whole essential oils or plants in which
the specified terpene may be a predominant constituent.
However, therapeutic contribution from some of the
other terpenes in some of these studies cannot be
excluded. The terpenes analyzed in this study were lim-
ited to α-pinene, β-myrcene, D-limonene, linalool, β-
caryophyllene, humulene, trans-nerolidol, and bisabolol.
Alpha-pinene (α-pinene) is the most commonly occur-
ring terpene in nature [309], and accounts for the aroma
of fresh sage, pine needles, and conifers, but is produced
by many herbs such as basil, parsley, and dill as well. It
has anti-inflammatory effects in human chondrocytes,
suggesting anti-osteoarthritic activity [310, 311], anti-
inflammatory effects by PGE-1 [312], and anti-nociception
properties [313].
Beta-myrcene (β-myrcene), or myrcene, is common in
lemongrass, basil, bay leaves, wild thyme, parsley,
hops, and tropical fruits such as mango. It has potent
anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties
[314–316], and has benefit in muscle relaxation [317],
and
prominent
sedation/hypnotic,
helpful
in
sleep
[317, 318]. Its analgesic effects were antagonized by
naloxone suggesting an opioid-mediated mechanism
[315, 316]. Its significant anti-inflammatory effects
[319] occur via prostaglandin E2 [315] and it has
anti-catabolic effects in human chondrocytes suggest-
ing anti-osteoarthritic activity and the ability to halt
or slow down cartilage destruction and osteoarthritis
progression [320].
D-limonene (limonene) is prominent in the rinds of
citrus fruits, and the second most commonly occurring
terpene in nature [309]. It has analgesic [321], anti-
inflammatory [320, 322–325], and antidepressant effects
[321, 326]. It contributes to muscle relaxation and sleep
[317], and is a powerful anxiolytic [327–330], which ex-
tended anxiolytic benefit to patients with chronic mye-
loid leukemia (CML) [331]. It increases the metabolic
turnover of dopamine in the hippocampus and serotonin
in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, suggesting that
anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects may occur by
the suppression of dopamine activity related to enhanced
serotonergic neurons, especially via 5-HT1A [332].
Linalool is found in flowers and spices including cit-
rus, lavender, rosewood, birch trees, and coriander. It ex-
hibits anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity [333–335]
as well as anti-nociception via activation of opioidergic
and cholinergic systems [333], anticonvulsant via anti-
glutamatergic
and
GABA
neurotransmitter
systems
[336–340], anti-anxiety/stress [341–344], sedation [343,
345–347], and anti-insomnia properties [100]. Its local
anesthetic effects [348] were equivalent to procaine and
menthol [349], and analgesic effects have been attributed
to adenosine A2A activity [350] and ionotropic glutamate
receptors including AMPA, NMDA and kainate [351].
Morphine opioid usage in gastric banding surgical
patients was significantly decreased following lavender
inhalation vs. placebo, and this was attributed to the
linalool concentration [352].
Beta-caryophyllene (β-caryophyllene) is found in spices
and plants including cloves, cinnamon, black pepper,
hops, rosemary, oregano, and basil. It has analgesic effects
in inflammatory and neuropathic pain [353], and has po-
tent
anti-inflammatory
effects
[354–357],
with
local
anesthetic properties [358]. Anti-inflammatory effects
appear to occur via PGE-1 [359], with similar efficacy as
indomethacin and etodolac [360, 361], and comparable to
phenylbutazone [359, 360]. β-caryophyllene is a selective
cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonist [362–364]. CB2 re-
ceptors have been implicated in anxiety and depression,
and β-caryophyllene has shown anxiolytic and antidepres-
sant effects [365].

 Humulene
(α-caryophyllene)
is
an
isomer
of
β-
caryophyllene and plays a role in many of the distinguish-
ing characteristics between different cannabis strains. It is
found in herbs and spices such as clove, basil, hops, sage,
spearmint and ginseng, in addition to some vegetables
and fruits. It has strong anti-inflammatory properties
comparable to dexamethasone systemically, topically, and
in allergic airway inflammation [354–356, 366, 367], as
well as anti-nociceptive and analgesic properties [367].
Nerolidol (trans-nerolidol) is found in many herbs and
spices including lavender, lemon grass, ginger, jasmine,
tea tree, oranges, and present in orange and other citrus
peels. It has anti-insomnia and sedative properties [368].
Alpha-bisabolol (α-bisabolol, bisabolol, levomenol) is
produced by some flowers used in making tea, such as the
chamomile flower. It has anti-inflammatory effects in the
skin [369], as well as anti-nociceptive properties [370].
Cannabis sativa strains are generally described by pa-
tients as uplifting, energetic, creative, euphoria, spacey,
cerebrally-focused effects, and better for day use, while
Cannabis indica strains are typically described as calm-
ing, relaxing, sedative, full body effects such as “body
buzz”, and better for night use. Research suggests these
effects are not likely due purely to CBD:THC ratios, as
there are no significant differences in CBD:THC ratios
between Sativa and Indica strains. Rather these different
subjective effects are likely due to varying ratios of major
cannabinoids as well as minor cannabinoids, terpenes
and probably additional phytochemicals [100, 371–374].
High CBD strains are Sativa or Indica strains that have
been crossed with high CBD hemp strains (1:1 CBD:
THC up to approximately 5:1 CBD:THC), while pure
CBD strains (ratios of > 10:1 CBD:THC, which can be
up to approximately 50:1 CBD:THC) are considered
hemp strains. Most strains utilized today are Hybrids
designed with standardized ratios of CBD, THC, other
cannabinoids, and other compounds such as terpenes
and flavonoids, targeting specific symptoms, responses,
and end user effects.
Although not of statistical significance, there were
some pattern use trends noted. The majority of patients
across all pain groups including the positive ID Mi-
graine™, headache as primary symptom, chronic pain,
and arthritis groups all preferred Hybrid cannabis strains
followed by Indica, Sativa, and higher CBD strains (1:1
CBD:THC, 3:1 CBD:THC) when patients with headache
as primary symptom were included. However, when
these patients were excluded, the arthritis group pre-
ferred Indica strains. When comparing headache and
migraine to non-headache groups, Indica strains were
preferred in the insomnia/sleep disorders group, Sativa
strains in the mental health condition/PTSD group, and
Hybrid strains were still preferred in the gastrointestinal
disorder/Crohn’s Disease group. Perhaps the headache,
chronic
pain,
and
gastrointestinal
disorder/Crohn’s
groups preferred similar Hybrid strains due to under-
lying inflammatory pathophysiology. The positive ID
Migraine™ and headache as primary symptom patients
most commonly preferred the “OG Shark” Hybrid strain
specifically, although this pattern was also noted in the
chronic pain and arthritis groups, so was not unique to
headache and migraine. This is a high THC/THCA, low
CBD/CBDA strain with β-caryophyllene followed by β-
myrcene as the predominant terpenes. This could reflect
the potent analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-emetic
properties
of
THC,
along
with
documented
anti-
inflammatory and analgesic properties of β-caryophyllene
and β-myrcene. Given the prominent features of pain with
nausea and vomiting in migraine headache, the fact that
headache and migraine patients preferred a strain such as
this, with its associated cannabinoid and terpene profile,
would make sense given the known therapeutic effects of
this cannabinoid and these terpenes. Furthermore, there
were additional terpenes present in this strain of lower
percentages, some of which also have analgesic and anti-
inflammatory properties.
Substituting cannabis for alcohol, illicit drugs and/
or prescription medications has been commonly ob-
served in cross sectional surveys, suggesting a harm
reduction role in the use of these substances, as well
as implications for abstinence-based substance use
treatment strategies [375–377]. The “opioid-sparing
effect” of cannabinoids has been well described with
extensive supporting evidence showing that combining
cannabis with opiates decreases opiate dose require-
ments [166, 378]. CB1 receptors are 10 times more
concentrated then mu-opioid receptors in the brain,
and cannabinoid receptors co-localize with opioid re-
ceptors in many regions involved in pain pathways.
This is suspected to contribute to synergistic augmen-
tation of the analgesic opioid effects and decreased
opioid dose requirements [8, 122–125, 166, 379–384],
and studies have shown cannabis use did not affect
blood levels
of
oxycodone or morphine
[8,
166].
Cannabinoid receptor agonists increase endogenous
opioid peptide release, and chronic THC use increases
endogenous
opioid
precursor
gene
expression
in
supraspinal and spinal structures involved in pain per-
ception [119, 126, 166, 379].
The synergistic effect of concomitant cannabis/canna-
binoids and opioids in lowering both pain and opioid
dose requirements without affecting serum opioid levels
has been demonstrated prospectively [166]. A large
meta-analysis showed that 17 of 19 pre-clinical studies
provided good evidence of these synergistic effects from
opioid and cannabinoid co-administration and that the
median effective dose (ED50) of morphine administered
with THC is 3.6 times lower than the ED50 of morphine
Baron et al. The Journal of Headache and Pain  (2018) 19:37 
Page 18 of 28
 alone, while the ED50 for codeine administered with
THC was 9.5 times lower than the ED50 of codeine
alone [378]. The combination of cannabis/cannabinoids
and opioids appears to allow for opioid treatment at
lower doses with fewer side effects, allowing easier de-
toxification and weaning due to lessening of tolerance
and withdrawal from opiates, and rekindling of opiate
analgesia after prior dosages have worn off [124]. Some
pain specialists have suggested the use of medicinal can-
nabis treatment in addition to or in replacement of opi-
ate treatments to help reduce overdose mortality and
morbidity associated with opiate use [385]. Prospective
studies have shown that chronic pain patients who use
cannabis have improved pain and functional outcomes,
and a significant reduction in opioid use [386], and med-
ical cannabis use was associated with decreased opiate
use, improvement in quality of life, and better side effect
profile
in
a
retrospective
cross-sectional
survey
of
chronic pain patients [387].
Notably, the most common prescription medications
replaced by medicinal cannabis in this study were opi-
ates/opioids in a large percentage within every pain
group, up to 72.8% of patients in the chronic pain as
primary illness group. Given the opioid epidemic, par-
ticularly in the United States, cannabis has been dis-
cussed as an option that may help in the opioid/opiate
detoxification and weaning process and perhaps assist
in combating the epidemic of opioid related death
[377, 385, 388–390]. States with medicinal cannabis
laws have been shown to have a 24.8% decreased annual
opioid overdose mortality rate compared with states with-
out medicinal cannabis laws. The association between
medicinal cannabis law implementation and decrease in
annual opioid overdose mortality strengthened over time
to a decrease of 33.7% by year 5 [391].
The synergistic interactions between the phytocanna-
binoids, terpenes and other cannabis compounds result-
ing in various therapeutic benefits and responses have
been termed the cannabis entourage effects [100, 170].
This synergy between the cannabinoids, terpenes, and
other compounds leads to variable benefits, user effects,
and strain characteristics. In addition, synergistic inter-
actions between cannabis and opioid pathways may be a
promising new weapon in the battle of the opioid epi-
demic. Further study is needed to determine optimal
combinations for specific synergies and composition ra-
tios of the cannabis constituents to best target different
symptoms and diseases. Medicinal cannabis production
has become a very sterile, scientific, standardized pro-
duction process, and an emerging new industry. Similar
to the broad category of anticonvulsants with many
varieties targeting variable neurochemical pathways and
channels with different responses and side effects, can-
nabis should also be thought of a broad category of
medicine, of which further therapeutic delineations and
disease
targeting
differentiations
between
strains
is
necessary.
There are multiple limitations to this study beginning
with its survey design and inherent limitations. Many of
the patients who reported headache as a primary symp-
tom for which they were treating with medicinal canna-
bis, had also reported other diseases or symptoms that
they were using medicinal cannabis for. So, some of the
answers provided may not have been specific for only
headache treatment, but potentially other symptoms or
a combination of symptoms including headache. This
could also influence reported preferred strains being
used since some strains are used more commonly for
some symptoms, while other strains may be used for
other symptoms. There may be some inaccuracy of pa-
tient numbers within the different pain groups of
chronic pain, arthritis, and headache. For example, some
patients who reported chronic pain as the primary ill-
ness for which they were using medicinal cannabis did
not specify their type of chronic pain further. It is un-
known if some of these patients may have been treating
chronic pain of arthritis or headache types, but reporting
it as chronic pain, and therefore some of these patients
may have been more accurately listed in a different more
specific category. Variability in patients’ cannabis know-
ledge could potentially influence self-reporting accuracy.
When documenting the preferred cannabis types and
strains within each of the pain and non-pain groups,
many patients did not provide an answer for their pre-
ferred type or strain. If a preferred cannabis type was
not provided, but a preferred strain was provided, then
their preferred type was presumed to correlate to their
reported preferred strain, and counted as such. In
addition, reported preferred cannabis types and strains
sometimes did not correlate (reported strain did not fall
under the correct reported type). Therefore, the pre-
ferred cannabis types and strains listed within each
category, and their inferred potential benefits, may be in-
accurate based on this inconsistent reporting by some
patients, and the validity of the preferred cannabis type
and strain data requires prospective validation.
Conclusions
Chronic pain was the most common reason for use of
medicinal cannabis, consistent with the statistics of most
registries. Identifying differences in use patterns between
migraine, headache, arthritis, and chronic pain syn-
dromes may be helpful in optimizing crossbred cannabis
strains, synergistic biochemical profiles, or dosing differ-
ences between these pain subsets. The majority of
patients treating headache with medicinal cannabis were

 Migraine™ questionnaire. This suggests that most head-
aches being treated with medicinal cannabis were likely
of migrainous pathophysiology.
Hybrid cannabis strains were preferred across most
pain groups. “OG Shark”, a high THC/THCA, low CBD/
CBDA
strain
with
β-caryophyllene
followed
by
β-
myrcene as the predominant terpenes, was the most pre-
ferred strain in the positive ID Migraine™ and headache
as primary symptom groups. This could reflect the
potent
analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-emetic
properties
of
THC,
along
with
documented
anti-inflammatory
and
analgesic
properties
of
β-
caryophyllene and β-myrcene. Since migraines also in-
volve nausea and vomiting, the potent antiemetic prop-
erties of THC may be a reason for this preference.
Vaporizing or joint use were the primary methods of use
across all groups, including migraine and headache,
likely reflecting the need for a quick acting inhaled or
non-orally ingested therapy in migraine attacks before
severe pain and nausea/vomiting become prominent.
Most patients in the pain groups reported replacing
prescription medications with medicinal cannabis, the
most common of which were opiates/opioids across all
pain groups. This is notable given the well-described
“opioid-sparing effect” of cannabinoids and growing
abundance of literature suggesting that cannabis may
help in weaning from these medications and perhaps
providing a means of combating the opioid epidemic.
There are several limitations to the data in this study,
and these results require further confirmation with more
sophisticated prospective study methods. However, these
results may provide early insight and a framework for
direction into optimizing crossbred cannabis strains,
synergistic biochemical profiles, dosing, and patterns of
use that may be of clinical benefit in the treatment of
headache and migraine, as well as other chronic pain
syndromes.
