Investigation performed at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota
Background: Although obesity is associated with increased complication rates after lower-extremity arthroplasty, there
is a relative paucity of studies examining the effect of body mass index (BMI) on shoulder arthroplasty. The purpose of this
investigation was to evaluate the effect of BMI on implant survival and the rate of complications after shoulder
arthroplasty.
Methods: Using an institutional total joint registry, 4,567 consecutive shoulder arthroplasty cases from 1970 to 2013
were studied. The mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m2 (range, 14 to 66 kg/m2), with 1,622 patients (36%) with a BMI of 30 to 40
kg/m2 and 297 patients (7%) with a BMI of >40 kg/m2. There were 2,493 female patients (55%). BMI was dichotomized
after examination of the smoothing spline curve. The associations of factors and complications were assessed using Cox
proportional hazard regression analysis.
Results: Increasing BMI was associated with an increased risk of a revision surgical procedure, reoperation, revision for
mechanical failure, and superficial infection, and it was negatively associated with risk of a periprosthetic fracture. The risk of
a revision surgical procedure increased in a linear fashion with increasing BMI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05, or a 5% increased risk
per 1 unit of BMI; p = 0.03). Increased BMI was also associated with an increased risk of revision for mechanical failure (HR,
1.05; p = 0.004). In a multivariate model, the association of BMI and risk of a revision for any reason, revision for mechanical
failure, and reoperation maintained significance (p £ 0.02). The most marked association between increasing BMI and any
complication in shoulder arthroplasty was its association with superficial wound infection (HR, 1.09; p = 0.03).
Conclusions: Increasing BMI is strongly associated with increased rates of revision surgical procedures and postop-
erative complications after shoulder arthroplasty. It is important to consider these findings when counseling patients,
estimating risks, and estimating complication risks in policy decisions.
Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
T
he prevalence of obesity has risen to record numbers in
recent years
1-3, with 35% of adults in the United States
and 30% of the worldwide adult population having a
body mass index (BMI) of ‡30 kg/m2. This increase in obese
patients has led to a marked impact on health-care resource
utilization in the United States, with a yearly cost of >$100
billion attributed to obesity4.
Morbid obesity is linked to increased rates of complica-
tions after lower-extremity arthroplasty, including superficial
wound infections, hip dislocations, venous thromboembolism,
and revision for aseptic loosening
5-14. To our knowledge, there has
been a paucity of studies examining the effects of obesity on
upper-extremity arthroplasty. The few studies examining obesity
in orthopaedic procedures have examined the effect of BMI using
specific World Health Organization (WHO)-defined ranges. The
purpose of this investigation was to quantify implant survival and
the rate of complications after shoulder arthroplasty considering
BMI as a continuous variable.

 Materials and Methods
T
he study was carried out using the total joint registry of a single institu-
tion15 after approval by the institutional review board. This registry pro-
spectively captures numerous patient and clinical variables before and after
total joint arthroplasty at specific time intervals
16. Each author certifies that his
or her institution approved the human protocol for this investigation and that
all investigations were conducted in conformity with ethical principles of
research.
Demographic Characteristics
All patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty from 1970 to 2013 at a single
institution were included. Patients were excluded who declined or were too
young (<18 years of age) for research authorization, did not have BMI recorded
in their medical record, underwent shoulder arthroplasty for tumor resection
or acute proximal humeral fracture, or had humeral-head resurfacing. The
patient demographic characteristics are summarized in Table I.
Outcomes
The outcomes analyzed in this investigation included a revision surgical pro-
cedure for any reason, reoperation for any reason, dislocation, any infection
(superficial or deep), superficial infection, periprosthetic fracture, and venous
thromboembolism. Deep infection was defined as a periprosthetic infection
and was categorized into acute (£10 weeks postoperatively) or chronic (>10
weeks postoperatively). Subgroup analysis of a revision surgical procedure for
mechanical failure, including aseptic loosening, wear, and fractured compo-
nents, was performed. A revision surgical procedure was defined as the removal
of any implant. Dislocation was defined as dislocation demonstrated on
imaging evaluation diagnosed by the treating surgeon. We examined the effect
of multiple variables including age, sex, surgical diagnosis (including rotator
cuff arthropathy), and year in which the surgical procedure was performed. The
year of the surgical procedure was considered to account for changes in implant
design and surgical technique, including 1970 to 1994 (monoblock humeral
heads), 1995 to 2000 (modular humeral heads), and 2001 to 2013 (modular and
eccentric heads with offset). We performed an additional analysis of only an-
atomic shoulder arthroplasties, analyzing metal-backed compared with all-
polyethylene glenoids and the association of BMI and complications in this
subgroup. We also analyzed the association of diabetes mellitus as a potential
confounding factor among the 3,730 patients for whom information on dia-
betic status was available.
Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier survival method was used to estimate survival at 5, 10, and
20 years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess the
association of outcomes with BMI. These associations were parameterized
using a smoothing spline model, adjusting for correlated shoulders. This
methodology plots hazard ratios (HRs) as a function of BMI, taking into ac-
count follow-up to each end point. Results are reported as HRs with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). The graphs were plotted to demonstrate HRs as a
function of BMI. We examined BMIs between 20 and 50 kg/m2. Given the
limited number of patients with the extremes of BMI, patients with BMI
of <20 kg/m2 were set as having a BMI equal to 20 kg/m2 and patients
with BMI of >50 kg/m2 were set as having a BMI equal to 50 kg/m2.
A secondary analysis was performed using the WHO criteria for BMI as
non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2), obese (BMI between 30 and 40 kg/m2), and
morbidly obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2). Another secondary analysis was performed
examining patients who had diabetes mellitus.
Multivariate analysis included sex, age, surgical indication, and date
of the surgical procedure (1970 to 1994, 1995 to 2000, or 2001 to 2013). The
surgical indications considered included posttraumatic arthritis, inflammatory
arthritis, rotator cuff tear arthropathy, or osteoarthritis. Subgroup analyses were
performed excluding rotator cuff arthropathy, as well as separating hemiar-
throplasty, anatomic arthroplasty, and reverse arthroplasty. Significance was
set at p < 0.05.

 Results
O
f the 4,567 shoulder arthroplasty cases, 302 cases required
a revision surgical procedure that was captured in our
registry and 62 additional cases required a non-revision reop-
eration. We identified 61 dislocations, 62 infections (14 su-
perficial, 14 acute deep periprosthetic, and 34 chronic deep
periprosthetic), 203 periprosthetic fractures, and 23 venous
thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis or pulmo-
nary embolism). There were 124 revision surgical procedures
for mechanical failure (aseptic mechanical reasons for implant
failure), including 63 for aseptic loosening only, 37 for poly-
ethylene wear only, 4 for a fractured component only, and 20
for multiple aseptic mechanical failure etiologies. For those 4,265
patients who did not undergo an implant revision surgical pro-
cedure, the mean follow-up was 8 years (range, 0.1 to 40 years).
The Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of implant survival free of
revision were 94% (95% CI, 93% to 95%) at 5 years, 90% (95%
CI, 88% to 91%) at 10 years, and 80% (95% CI, 75% to 85%) at
20 years. When cases with rotator cuff arthropathy were excluded,
the implant survival free of a revision surgical procedure was 94%
at 5 years, 90% at 10 years, and 82% at 20 years.
Reoperation Other Than Revision
There was a significant association (p = 0.02) between BMI
and risk of any ipsilateral shoulder reoperation (Fig. 1). The
smoothing spline curve illustrates the 5% increased risk of any
reoperation per 1 unit of BMI ‡ 35 kg/m2 (HR, 1.05; p = 0.02)
among all shoulder arthroplasties (Table II) and among those
with rotator cuff arthropathy excluded (see Appendix). Al-
ternatively, when compared with non-obese patients, morbid
obesity increased the risk of reoperation by 46% (HR, 1.46;
p = 0.06) (Table III). The significant association between BMI
as a continuous variable and reoperation remained after taking
into account sex, age, surgical indication, and date of the surgical
procedure (HR, 1.05; p = 0.02). When examining the effect of
implant type, increasing BMIwas associated with an increased risk
of reoperation for hemiarthroplasty (HR, 1.08; p = 0.02), total
shoulder arthroplasty (HR, 1.03; p = 0.25), and reverse shoulder
arthroplasty (HR, 1.08; p = 0.35). The association with BMI and
reoperation in anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty remained
similar in the multivariate model when accounting for sex, age,
surgical indication, and type of glenoid (metal-backed compared
with all-polyethylene) (HR, 1.04; p = 0.14).

OUTCOMES AFTER SHOULDER ARTHROPLA STY
 Implant Revision Surgical Procedure
There was a strong association between BMI and the risk of an
implant revision surgical procedure (Fig. 2). Examining BMI
using the smoothing spline, there was a 5% increased risk per
1 unit of BMI ‡ 35 kg/m2 (HR, 1.05; p = 0.03) (Table II). There
was a similar relationship when excluding rotator cuff ar-
thropathy (HR, 1.05; p = 0.03) (see Appendix). When exam-
ining the effect of BMI using the standard WHO criteria for
non-obese (<30 kg/m2), obese (30 to 40 kg/m2), and morbidly
obese (>40 kg/m2) individuals, there was an increased risk of a
revision surgical procedure for obese patients (HR, 1.17 [a 17%
increased risk]; p = 0.22) and for morbidly obese patients (HR,
1.48 [almost a 50% increased risk]; p = 0.16) relative to non-
obese patients, but these outcomes did not reach significance
(Table III). This association was similar for those without rotator
cuff arthropathy (see Appendix). On the basis of the multivariate
analysis taking into account age, sex, surgical indication, and
date of the surgical procedure, the increased risk of a revision
surgical procedure remained significantly associated with BMI
(HR, 1.05, 5% increased risk per 1 unit; p = 0.02). In a subgroup
analysis, BMI was also associated with increased risks of a revi-
sion surgical procedure for hemiarthroplasty (HR, 1.05; p =
0.14), anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (HR, 1.04; p = 0.18),
and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (HR, 1.12; p = 0.15). The
association between BMI and a revision surgical procedure after
anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty was similar in the multivar-
iate model when accounting for sex, age, surgical indication, and
type of glenoid (metal-backed compared with all-polyethylene)
(HR, 1.05; p = 0.09).
Revision for Mechanical Failure
There also was a significant association between BMI and revision
for mechanical failure (aseptic loosening, polyethylene wear, or
implant fracture) (Fig. 3). For every 1-unit increase in BMI
‡ 30 kg/m2, there was a 5% increased risk of a revision surgical

 procedure for mechanical failure (HR, 1.05; p = 0.004) (Table II);
this was reduced to 4% when excluding rotator cuff arthropathy
(HR, 1.04; p = 0.01) (see Appendix). Categories of mechanical
implant failure were analyzed, demonstrating a 7% increase in
the risk of revision for aseptic loosening for each unit increase in
BMI ‡ 30 kg/m2 (HR, 1.07, 7% increased risk per 1 unit of BMI;
p = 0.003) (Fig. 3). There was an increased risk of revision for a
fractured component (HR, 1.09; p = 0.006) and a nonsignificantly
increased risk of revision for wear (HR, 1.02; p = 0.07). These
associations were also examined assessing BMI categorized with
WHO criteria. There was a significantly increased risk of a revi-
sion for mechanical failure in obese patients (HR, 1.63; 63%
increased risk per 1 unit of BMI, p = 0.01) and a nonsignificantly
increased risk for morbidly obese patients (HR, 1.63; p = 0.18)
(Table III). There were similar associations when excluding ro-
tator cuff arthropathy (see Appendix). Additionally, the risk of
revision for aseptic loosening increased by 60% for obese patients
(HR, 1.60; p = 0.05) and by 122% for morbidly obese patients
(HR, 2.22; p = 0.04). On the basis of the multivariate analysis,
when including sex, age, surgical indication, and date of the
surgical procedure, the increased risk of mechanical failure (HR,
1.07 per 1 unit; p < 0.001) continued to be associated with BMI.
Comparing the different types of arthroplasty, BMI was associ-
ated with increased risks of mechanical failure for hemiarthro-
plasty (HR, 1.10; p = 0.01), anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty
(HR, 1.04; p = 0.18), and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (HR, 1.11;
p = 0.12). The association between BMI and revision for me-
chanical failure after anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty was
similar in the multivariate model when accounting for sex, age,
surgical indication, and type of glenoid (metal-backed compared
with all-polyethylene) (HR, 1.05; p = 0.09).
Infection
Although there was a nonsignificantly increased risk of the
development of any infection with increasing BMI (p > 0.05),
there was a stronger association between BMI and superficial
wound infection (Fig. 4). The smoothing spline illustrates a 3%
increased risk of any infection (HR, 1.03; p = 0.10) and a 9%
increased risk of a superficial infection (HR, 1.09; p = 0.03) for
each unit increase in BMI. There was no association be-
tween deep periprosthetic infection and BMI in the acute
setting (£10 weeks postoperatively) or the chronic setting
(>10 weeks postoperatively). The risk of infection with in-
creasing BMI was most apparent among morbidly obese
patients, with an 82% increased risk of any infection relative
to non-obese patients (HR, 1.82; p = 0.18) and a >300%
increased risk of superficial wound infection (HR, 4.10; p = 0.04)
(Table III). However, there was no association between morbid
obesity and deep periprosthetic infection.
Dislocation, Thromboembolism, and Periprosthetic Fracture
When examining BMI as a continuous variable, there was no
association between BMI and instability in the entire study cohort
(p = 0.83) (Fig. 5), as well as when rotator cuff arthropathy was
excluded (see Appendix). Non-obese, obese, and morbidly obese
patients did not have a significant difference (p > 0.05) in the risk
of dislocation with or without rotator cuff arthropathy included.
There was a negative association between BMI and the
risk of periprosthetic fracture (Fig. 5). For patients with a BMI
< 25 kg/m2, there was a significantly increased riskof periprosthetic
fracture for patients with lower BMIs overall (HR, 1.12 per 1 unit of
BMI below 25 kg/m2; p = 0.01) and for those without rotator cuff
arthropathy (HR, 1.11; p = 0.03). However, again examining the
risk for a periprosthetic fracture among the categories of non-
obese, obese, and morbidly obese, there was no significant asso-
ciation overall (p ‡ 0.52) or without rotator cuff arthropathy (p ‡
0.42). Similarly, the association between BMI and periprosthetic
fracture was not significant in the multivariate model taking
into account age, sex, surgical indication, and date of the surgical
procedure (p = 0.66). When examining the type of arthroplasty,
anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (HR, 1.24; p < 0.001) had
a higher prevalence of periprosthetic fractures in patients with

 BMI < 25 kg/m2, but there were no associations seen in reverse
shoulder arthroplasty (p = 0.96) or hemiarthroplasty (p = 0.68).
There was no significant association (p = 0.39) between
BMI and the risk of a postoperative thromboembolism (Table II).
Diabetes Mellitus
Given that obesity is often associated with diabetes mellitus, we
examined the effects of diabetes mellitus on overall outcomes
and when separated by specific type of arthroplasty. Of the
3,730 patients for whom we had information on diabetic status,
203 (5.4%) had diabetes mellitus at the time of the surgical
procedure. Diabetes mellitus generally had no significant im-
pact (p > 0.05) on the outcomes after shoulder arthroplasty
(see Appendix). In particular, there was no increased risk of any
infection (HR, 1.71; p = 0.37) (see Appendix) or deep peri-
prosthetic joint infection (HR, 1.60; p = 0.52) in patients with
diabetes mellitus. The only significant finding was the increased
risk of periprosthetic fractures in patients undergoing hemi-
arthroplasty (p = 0.003). Furthermore, when including dia-
betes mellitus into the multivariate model analysis of the
impact of BMI, it did not change the association between BMI
and reoperation (HR, 1.05; p = 0.02), revision (HR, 1.05; p =
0.02), revision for mechanical failure (HR, 1.06; p = 0.008), and
dislocation (HR, 0.99; p = 0.81), but did lessen the impact of
BMI on periprosthetic fracture (HR, 1.06; p = 0.27).
Discussion
A
s the mean BMI around the world continues to increase, the
effect of obesity on health and surgical procedures will
continue to be critical to understand
4,17. Morbid obesity increases
the risk of complications, such as infections, dislocations, and
reoperations, after total hip or knee arthroplasty
5-13. This increase
in complications is associated with increased health-care burden
and patient morbidity and has a negative effect on outcomes
after these highly successful procedures. In recent years, studies
have begun to examine the effects of obesity in shoulder ar-
throplasty18-27. There remains no consensus on the overall effects
of obesity on shoulder arthroplasty. Furthermore, all of these
studies use traditional thresholds of BMI to examine the effect
on complications. We examined BMI as a continuous variable in
shoulder arthroplasty, determining the associated the risk of a
revision surgical procedure, reoperation, and postoperative
complications after shoulder arthroplasty.
In this large series of 4,567 shoulder arthroplasties from
1970 to 2013, our findings demonstrate that BMI ‡ 35 kg/m2 is
associated with an increased risk of a revision surgical procedure,
reoperations, and superficial infection. Increasing BMI is asso-
ciated with a progressively increased risk of complications, with a
very pronounced increase in the overall risk for morbidly obese
patients. BMI was not associated with other complications in-
cluding the risk of dislocations or thromboembolism. However,
patients with lower BMIs had an increased risk of periprosthetic
fractures.
Implant survival rates in shoulder arthroplasty are de-
pendent on a variety of patient and surgical factors, such as
patient sex, young age, or surgical indication
26,28-32. Currently, to
our knowledge, there is no consensus on the impact of obesity
on implant survival in shoulder arthroplasty. Although there
are studies that show higher short-term complication rates in
obese or morbidly obese patients18,20,21, most studies have not
found any significant impact on implant failure rates22,24,25,27,30.
The lack of a consensus is likely attributable to the small overall
number of shoulders and relatively short-term follow-up in
many of these studies. In a previous study that utilized the same
registry as this current study, Singh et al. performed a long-
term follow-up after humeral-head replacement over a 32-year
period and similarly found that higher BMIs were associated
with increased risk of a revision surgical procedure
26.
Logically, it would make sense that increasing BMI might
be associated with having a larger arm and that raising a dis-
proportionately heavy arm would place greater stresses on the
implants. Our results demonstrate that increasing BMI does
increase the rates of implant failure. Furthermore, increasing
BMI was also associated with increased rates of revision for
mechanical failure, such as aseptic loosening. These findings
support the notion that increasing BMI increases the stresses
on the implant, leading to higher rates of implant failure. Other
explanations for increased implant failure also potentially include
the higher rates of deep infection, implant malposition secondary
to difficult surgical exposure, and other comorbidities in patients
with increasing BMI, as well as other factors that were not ex-
amined. Interestingly, the association of BMI with outcomes and
complications after shoulder arthroplasty was most marked when
BMI was analyzed as a continuous variable. Analysis using the
WHO criteria for obesity demonstrated a reduced association
between BMI and a revision surgical procedure.
Although the reasons for underlying infections are com-
plex, certain patient factors, such as male sex, younger age, and
surgical indication, have been associated with an increased risk
of a prosthetic joint infection
23,31. To our knowledge, studies of
shoulder arthroplasty up to this point have failed to demonstrate
a link between periprosthetic joint infection and obesity
18,22-25,31.
However, intuitively it seems that the large adipose layer present
in obese patients, as well as associated comorbidities (such as
diabetes mellitus), would increase the risk of periprosthetic joint
infection. Our series suggests that greater BMI is associated with
a higher rate of superficial infections. There was a striking as-
sociation between superficial wound infections and increasing
BMI; there was no association between deep periprosthetic in-
fections (acute or chronic) and BMI.
The findings of this study should be interpreted in the
light of certain limitations. First, the duration of follow-up was
limited in some patients, thus making their arthroplasties less
relevant in the Kaplan-Meier models than others with longer
follow-up. We included all patients as we used Kaplan-Meier
survivorship that accounts for patient follow-up. Additionally,
we were not able to take into account all of the different types
and variations of implant design, possibly allowing certain
implant design flaws to bias our findings. Finally, although we
were able to account for sex, diagnosis, BMI, and surgical in-
dications, we did not account for all comorbidities or surgical
factors.

 The strengths of this study include prospective data col-
lection, a long period of analysis, completeness of follow-up for
specific end points, and a very large patient population. Fur-
thermore, the novel analysis of this series examining BMI as a
continuous variable, as well as the multiple outcomes included
in this analysis, contributes to our understanding of the associ-
ation between BMI and outcome of shoulder arthroplasty.
In conclusion, these findings contribute to our under-
standing of the relationship of BMI to the risk of revision, reop-
eration, and complications after shoulder arthroplasty. Increasing
BMI was associated with increasing rates of revision surgical
procedures, reoperations, and infection, in a greater than linear
fashion. These data can be utilized by physicians, orthopaedic
surgeons, and patients to make informed decisions concerning the
relative risks and benefits of elective shoulder arthroplasty
in patients with different BMIs. It also lays the framework for
potential future studies into the efficacy of collaborative efforts
among care providers to modify these preoperative risk factors.
Given the increased risks associated with increased BMI, we hope
that the evolution of the health-care delivery model will include
preoperative risk stratification, incentivizing surgeons to take care
of more complex patients with higher risks of postoperative
complications, such as morbidly obese patients.
