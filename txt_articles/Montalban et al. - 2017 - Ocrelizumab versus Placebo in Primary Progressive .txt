WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
5.1 
Infusion Reactions 
 Rituxan can cause severe, including fatal, infusion reactions.  Severe reactions 
typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30−120 minutes.  
Rituxan-induced infusion reactions and sequelae include urticaria, hypotension, 
angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, 
anaphylactoid events, or death. 
 Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to dosing.  
For RA patients, methylprednisolone 100 mg IV or its equivalent is recommended 
30 minutes prior to each infusion.  Institute medical management (e.g. 
glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or oxygen) for infusion reactions as 
needed.  Depending on the severity of the infusion reaction and the required 
interventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue Rituxan. Resume infusion at a 
minimum 50% reduction in rate after symptoms have resolved.  Closely monitor the 
following patients: those with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those 
who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions, and those with high 
numbers of circulating malignant cells ( ≥ 25,000/mm3). [See Boxed Warning, 
Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1).] 
5.2 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
 Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or 
hyperphosphatemia from tumor lysis, some fatal, can occur within 12−24 hours after

the first infusion of Rituxan in patients with NHL.  A high number of circulating 
malignant cells ( ≥ 25,000/mm3) or high tumor burden, confers a greater risk of TLS.   
 Administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti-hyperuricemic therapy in 
patients at high risk for TLS.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal 
function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as 
indicated. [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].] 
5.3 
Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions  
 Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, can occur in patients treated 
with Rituxan.  These reactions include paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis.  The onset of these reactions has varied from 1−13 weeks following 
Rituxan exposure.  Discontinue Rituxan in patients who experience a severe 
mucocutaneous reaction.  The safety of readministration of Rituxan to patients with 
severe mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined. [See Boxed Warning, 
Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.4).] 
5.4 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
 JC virus infection resulting in PML and death can occur in Rituxan-treated patients 
with hematologic malignancies or with autoimmune diseases.  The majority of 
patients with hematologic malignancies diagnosed with PML received Rituxan in 
combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  
The patients with autoimmune diseases had prior or concurrent immunosuppressive 
therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of their last infusion of 
Rituxan. 
 Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset 
neurologic manifestations.  Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, 
consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture.  Discontinue 
Rituxan and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy 
or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML. [See Boxed Warning, 
Adverse Reactions (6.4).] 
5.5 
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation 
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and 
death can occur in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with Rituxan.  The 
median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately 4 months after the 
initiation of Rituxan and approximately one month after the last dose. 
 Screen patients at high risk of HBV infection before initiation of Rituxan.  Closely 
monitor carriers of hepatitis B for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV 
infection for several months following Rituxan therapy.  Discontinue Rituxan and any 
concomitant chemotherapy in patients who develop viral hepatitis, and institute 
appropriate treatment including antiviral therapy.  Insufficient data exist regarding the 
safety of resuming Rituxan in patients who develop hepatitis subsequent to HBV 
reactivation. [See Adverse Reactions (6.4).] 
5.6 
Infections 
 Serious, including fatal, bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections  
can occur during and up to one year following the completion of Rituxan-based 
therapy.  New or reactivated viral infections included cytomegalovirus, herpes 
simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B 
and C.  Discontinue Rituxan for serious infections and institute appropriate anti-
infective therapy. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.4).]

Cardiovascular 
 Discontinue infusions for serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  Perform 
cardiac monitoring during and after all infusions of Rituxan for patients who develop 
clinically significant arrhythmias, or who have a history of arrhythmia or angina. 
[See Adverse Reactions (6.4).] 
5.8 
Renal 
 Severe, including fatal, renal toxicity can occur after Rituxan administration in 
patients with NHL.  Renal toxicity has occurred in patients who experience tumor 
lysis syndrome and in patients with NHL administered concomitant cisplatin therapy 
during clinical trials.  The combination of cisplatin and Rituxan is not an approved 
treatment regimen.  Monitor closely for signs of renal failure and discontinue Rituxan 
in patients with a rising serum creatinine or oliguria. [See Warnings and 
Precautions (5.2).] 
5.9 
Bowel Obstruction and Perforation 
 Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases leading to death, 
can occur in patients receiving Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy.  In 
postmarketing reports, the mean time to documented gastrointestinal perforation was 
6 (range 1−77) days in patients with NHL.  Perform a thorough diagnostic evaluation 
and institute appropriate treatment for complaints of abdominal pain. [See Adverse 
Reactions (6.4).] 
5.10 
Immunization 
 The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following Rituxan therapy has 
not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. 
 
For RA patients, physicians should follow current immunization guidelines and 
administer non-live vaccines at least 4 weeks prior to a course of Rituxan. 
 
The effect of Rituxan on immune responses was assessed in a randomized, 
controlled study in patients with RA treated with Rituxan and methotrexate (MTX) 
compared to patients treated with MTX alone. 
 
A response to pneumococcal vaccination (a T-cell independent antigen) as 
measured by an increase in antibody titers to at least 6 of 12 serotypes was lower in 
patients treated with Rituxan plus MTX as compared to patients treated with MTX 
alone (19% vs. 61%).  A lower proportion of patients in the Rituxan plus MTX group 
developed detectable levels of anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin antibodies (a novel 
protein antigen) after vaccination compared to patients on MTX alone (47% vs. 93%). 
 
A positive response to tetanus toxoid vaccine (a T-cell dependent antigen with 
existing immunity) was similar in patients treated with Rituxan plus MTX compared 
to patients on MTX alone (39% vs. 42%).  The proportion of patients maintaining a 
positive Candida skin test (to evaluate delayed type hypersensitivity) was also similar 
(77% of patients on Rituxan plus MTX vs. 70% of patients on MTX alone). 
 
Most patients in the Rituxan-treated group had B-cell counts below the lower limit 
of normal at the time of immunization.  The clinical implications of these findings are 
not known. 
5.11 
Laboratory Monitoring 
 In patients with lymphoid malignancies, during treatment with Rituxan 
monotherapy, obtain complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet counts prior to each 
Rituxan course.  During treatment with Rituxan and chemotherapy, obtain CBC and 
platelet counts at weekly to monthly intervals  and more frequently in patients who 
develop cytopenias [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  In patients with RA obtain CBC 
and platelet counts at two to four month intervals during Rituxan therapy.  The

duration of cytopenias caused by Rituxan can extend months beyond the treatment 
period. 
5.12 
Concomitant Use with Biologic Agents and DMARDS other than 
Methotrexate in RA 
 Limited data are available on the safety of the use of biologic agents or DMARDs 
other than methotrexate in patients exhibiting peripheral B-cell depletion following 
treatment with rituximab.  Observe patients closely for signs of infection if biologic 
agents and/or DMARDs are used concomitantly. 
5.13 
Use in RA Patients Who Have Not Had Prior Inadequate Response to 
Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Antagonists 
 While the efficacy of Rituxan was supported in four controlled trials in patients 
with RA with prior inadequate responses to non-biologic DMARDs, and in a 
controlled trial in MTX-naïve patients, a favorable risk-benefit relationship has not 
been established in these populations.  The use of Rituxan in patients with RA who 
have not had prior inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonists is not 
recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

 The most common adverse reactions of Rituxan (incidence  ≥ 25%) observed in 
clinical trials of patients with NHL were infusion reactions, fever, lymphopenia, 
chills, infection, and asthenia. 
 The most common adverse reactions of Rituxan (incidence ≥ 25%) observed in 
clinical trials of patients with CLL were: infusion reactions and neutropenia. 
6.1 
Clinical Trials Experience in Lymphoid Malignancies 
 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse 
reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to 
rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in 
practice. 
 The data described below reflect exposure to Rituxan in 2282 patients, with 
exposures ranging from a single infusion up to 6−8 months.  Rituxan was studied in 
both single-agent and active-controlled trials (n = 356 and n = 1926).  The population 
included 679 patients with low-grade follicular lymphoma, 927 patients with DLBCL, 
and 676 patients with CLL.  Most NHL patients received Rituxan as an infusion of 
375 mg/m2 per infusion, given as a single agent weekly for up to 8 doses, in 
combination with chemotherapy for up to 8 doses, or following chemotherapy for up 
to 16 doses.  CLL patients received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 as an initial infusion followed

by 500 mg/m2 for up to 5 doses, in combination with fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide.  Seventy-one percent of CLL patients received 6 cycles and 90% 
received at least 3 cycles of Rituxan-based therapy. 
Infusion Reactions 
 In the majority of patients with NHL, infusion reactions consisting of fever, 
chills/rigors, nausea, pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, 
urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, or hypertension occurred during the first 
Rituxan infusion.  Infusion reactions typically occurred within 30 to 120 minutes of 
beginning the first infusion and resolved with slowing or interruption of the Rituxan 
infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, and intravenous 
saline).  The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion 
(77%) and decreased with each subsequent infusion.  [See Boxed Warning, Warnings 
and Precautions (5.1).] 
Infections 
 Serious infections (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, occurred in less 
than 5% of patients with NHL in the single-arm studies.  The overall incidence of 
infections was 31% (bacterial 19%, viral 10%, unknown 6%, and fungal 1%).  [See 
Warnings and Precautions (5.4), (5.5), (5.6).] 
 In randomized, controlled studies where Rituxan was administered following 
chemotherapy for the treatment of follicular or low-grade NHL, the rate of infection 
was higher among patients who received Rituxan. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
patients, viral infections occurred more frequently in those who received Rituxan. 
Cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia 
 In patients with NHL receiving rituximab monotherapy, NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4 
cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients.  These included lymphopenia (40%), 
neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The 
median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1−588 days) and of neutropenia 
was 13 days (range, 2−116 days).  A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia 
(pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following Rituxan 
therapy occurred during the single-arm studies. 
 In studies of monotherapy, Rituxan-induced B-cell depletion occurred in 70% to 
80% of patients with NHL.  Decreased IgM and IgG serum levels occurred in 14% of 
these patients. 
Relapsed or Refractory, Low-Grade NHL 
 Adverse reactions in Table 1 occurred in 356 patients with relapsed or refractory, 
low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL treated in single-arm studies of 
Rituxan administered as a single agent [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].  Most patients 
received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 doses.

 In these single-arm Rituxan studies, bronchiolitis obliterans occurred during and up 
to 6 months after Rituxan infusion. 
Previously Untreated Low-Grade NHL 
 In Study 4, patients in the R-CVP arm experienced a higher incidence of infusional 
toxicity and neutropenia compared to patients in the CVP arm.  The following 
adverse reactions occurred more frequently (≥ 5%) in patients receiving R-CVP 
compared to CVP alone:  rash (17% vs. 5%), cough (15% vs. 6%), flushing (14% vs. 
3%), rigors (10% vs. 2%), pruritus (10% vs. 1%), neutropenia (8% vs. 3%), and chest 
tightness (7% vs. 1%).  [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] 
 In Study 5, the following adverse reactions were reported more frequently ( ≥ 5%) 
in patients receiving Rituxan following CVP compared to patients who received no 
further therapy:  fatigue (39% vs. 14%), anemia (35% vs. 20%), peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (30% vs. 18%), infections (19% vs. 9%), pulmonary toxicity (18% vs. 
10%), hepato-biliary toxicity (17% vs. 7%), rash and/or pruritus (17% vs. 5%), 
arthralgia (12% vs. 3%), and weight gain (11% vs. 4%).  Neutropenia was the only 
Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction that occurred more frequently (≥ 2%) in the Rituxan 
arm compared with those who received no further therapy (4% vs. 1%).  [See Clinical 
Studies (14.3).] 
DLBCL 
 In Studies 6 and 7, [see Clinical Studies (14.4)], the following adverse reactions, 
regardless of severity, were reported more frequently ( ≥ 5%) in patients age 
 ≥ 60 years receiving R-CHOP as compared to CHOP alone: pyrexia (56% vs. 46%), 
lung disorder (31% vs. 24%), cardiac disorder (29% vs. 21%), and chills (13% vs. 
4%).  Detailed safety data collection in these studies was primarily limited to Grade 3 
and 4 adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions.

 In Study 7, a review of cardiac toxicity determined that supraventricular 
arrhythmias or tachycardia accounted for most of the difference in cardiac disorders 
(4.5% for R-CHOP vs. 1.0% for CHOP). 
 The following Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred more frequently among 
patients in the R-CHOP arm compared with those in the CHOP arm: 
thrombocytopenia (9% vs. 7%) and lung disorder (6% vs. 3%).  Other Grade 3 or 4 
adverse reactions occurring more frequently among patients receiving R-CHOP were 
viral infection (Study 7), neutropenia (Studies 7 and 8), and anemia (Study 8). 
CLL 
 The data below reflect exposure to Rituxan in combination with fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide in 676 patients with CLL in Study 9 or Study 10 [see Clinical 
Studies (14.5)].  The age range was 30−83 years and 71% were men.  Detailed safety 
data collection in Study 9 was limited to Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions and serious 
adverse reactions. 
 Infusion-related adverse reactions were defined by any of the following adverse 
events occurring during or within 24 hours of the start of infusion: nausea, pyrexia, 
chills, hypotension, vomiting, and dyspnea. 
 
In Study 9, the following Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred more 
frequently in R-FC-treated patients compared to FC-treated patients: infusion 
reactions (9% in R-FC arm), neutropenia (30% vs. 19%), febrile neutropenia 
(9% vs. 6%), leukopenia (23% vs. 12%), and pancytopenia (3% vs. 1%). 
 In Study 10, the following Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred more frequently 
in R-FC-treated patients compared to FC-treated patients: infusion reactions (7% in 
R-FC arm), neutropenia (49% vs. 44%), febrile neutropenia (15% vs. 12%), 
thrombocytopenia (11% vs. 9%), hypotension (2% vs. 0%), and hepatitis B 
(2% vs. < 1%).  Fifty-nine percent of R-FC-treated patients experienced an infusion 
reaction of any severity. 
6.2 
Clinical Trials Experience in Rheumatoid Arthritis 
 
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse 
reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates 
in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
 The data presented below reflect the experience in 2578 RA patients treated with 
Rituxan in controlled and long-term studies with a total exposure of 5014 patient-
years. 
 Among all exposed patients, adverse reactions reported in greater than 10% of 
patients include infusion related reactions, upper respiratory tract infection, 
nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and bronchitis. 
 In placebo-controlled studies, patients received 2 × 500 mg or 2 × 1000 mg 
intravenous infusions of Rituxan or placebo, in combination with methotrexate, 
during a 24-week period. From these studies, 938 patients treated with Rituxan 
(2 × 1000 mg) or placebo have been pooled (see Table 2).  Adverse reactions reported 
in ≥ 5% of patients were hypertension, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, 
arthralgia, pyrexia and pruritus (see Table 2). The rates and types of adverse reactions 
in patients who received Rituxan 2 × 500 mg were similar to those observed in 
patients who received Rituxan 2 × 1000 mg.

Infusion Reactions 
 In the Rituxan RA pooled placebo-controlled studies, 32% of Rituxan-treated 
patients experienced an adverse reaction during or within 24 hours following their 
first infusion, compared to 23% of placebo-treated patients receiving their first 
infusion.  The incidence of adverse reactions during the 24-hour period following the 
second infusion, Rituxan or placebo, decreased to 11% and 13%, respectively.  Acute 
infusion reactions (manifested by fever, chills, rigors, pruritus, urticaria/rash, 
angioedema, sneezing, throat irritation, cough, and/or bronchospasm, with or without 
associated hypotension or hypertension) were experienced by 27% of Rituxan-treated 
patients following their first infusion, compared to 19% of placebo-treated patients 
receiving their first placebo infusion.  The incidence of these acute infusion reactions 
following the second infusion of Rituxan or placebo decreased to 9% and 11%, 
respectively.  Serious acute infusion reactions were experienced by  < 1% of patients 
in either treatment group.  Acute infusion reactions required dose modification 
(stopping, slowing, or interruption of the infusion) in 10% and 2% of patients 
receiving rituximab or placebo, respectively, after the first course.  The proportion of 
patients experiencing acute infusion reactions decreased with subsequent courses of 
Rituxan.  The administration of intravenous glucocorticoids prior to Rituxan infusions 
reduced the incidence and severity of such reactions, however, there was no clear 
benefit from the administration of oral glucocorticoids for the prevention of acute 
infusion reactions.  Patients in clinical studies also received antihistamines and 
acetaminophen prior to Rituxan infusions.

Infections 
 In the pooled, placebo-controlled studies, 39% of patients in the Rituxan group 
experienced an infection of any type compared to 34% of patients in the placebo 
group.  The most common infections were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract 
infections, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and sinusitis. 
 The incidence of serious infections was 2% in the Rituxan-treated patients and 1% 
in the placebo group. 
 In the experience with Rituxan in 2578 RA patients, the rate of serious infections 
was 4.31 per 100 patient years.  The most common serious infections ( ≥ 0.5%) were 
pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infections, cellulitis and urinary tract infections. 
Fatal serious infections included pneumonia, sepsis and colitis.  Rates of serious 
infection remained stable in patients receiving subsequent courses.  In 185 Rituxan-
treated RA patients with active disease, subsequent treatment with a biologic 
DMARD, the majority of which were TNF antagonists, did not appear to increase the 
rate of serious infection.  Thirteen serious infections were observed in 186.1 patient 
years (6.99 per 100 patient years) prior to exposure and 10 were observed in 
182.3 patient years (5.49 per 100 patient years). 
Cardiac Adverse Reactions 
 In the pooled, placebo-controlled studies, the proportion of patients with serious 
cardiovascular reactions was 1.7% and 1.3% in the Rituxan and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively.  Three cardiovascular deaths occurred during the double-blind 
period of the RA studies including all rituximab regimens (3/769 = 0.4%) as 
compared to none in the placebo treatment group (0/389). 
 In the experience with Rituxan in 2578 RA patients, the rate of serious cardiac 
reactions was 1.93 per 100 patient years.  The rate of myocardial infarction (MI) was 
0.56 per 100 patient years (28 events in 26 patients), which is consistent with MI rates 
in the general RA population.  These rates did not increase over three courses of 
Rituxan. 
 Since patients with RA are at increased risk for cardiovascular events compared 
with the general population, patients with RA should be monitored throughout the 
infusion and Rituxan should be discontinued in the event of a serious or 
life-threatening cardiac event. 
Hypophosphatemia and hyperuricemia 
 In the pooled, placebo-controlled studies, newly-occurring hypophosphatemia 
(<2.0 mg/dl) was observed in 12% (67/540) of patients on Rituxan versus 10% 
(39/398) of patients on placebo.  Hypophosphatemia was more common in patients 
who received corticosteroids. Newly-occurring hyperuricemia (>10 mg/dl) was 
observed in 1.5% (8/540) of patients on Rituxan versus 0.3% (1/398) of patients on 
placebo. 
 In the experience with Rituxan in RA patients, newly-occurring hypophosphatemia 
was observed in 21% (528/2570) of patients and newly-occurring hyperuricemia was 
observed in 2% (56/2570) of patients.  The majority of the observed 
hypophosphatemia occurred at the time of the infusions and was transient. 
Retreatment in Patients with RA 
 In the experience with Rituxan in RA patients, 2578 patients have been exposed to 
Rituxan and have received up to 10 courses of Rituxan in RA clinical trials, with 
1890, 1043, and 425 patients having received at least two, three, and four courses, 
respectively. Most of the patients who received additional courses did so 24 weeks or 
more after the previous course and none were retreated sooner than 16 weeks.  The

rates and types of adverse reactions reported for subsequent courses of Rituxan were 
similar to rates and types seen for a single course of Rituxan. 
 
In RA Study 2, where all patients initially received Rituxan, the safety profile of 
patients who were retreated with Rituxan was similar to those who were retreated 
with placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.6), and Dosage and Administration (2.5).] 
6.3 
Immunogenicity 
 As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.  The 
observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an 
assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and 
specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, 
concomitant medications, and underlying disease.  For these reasons, comparison of 
the incidence of antibodies to Rituxan with the incidence of antibodies to other 
products may be misleading. 
 Using an ELISA assay, anti-human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) was detected 
in 4 of 356 (1.1%) patients with low-grade or follicular NHL receiving single-agent 
Rituxan.  Three of the four patients had an objective clinical response. 
 A total of 273/2578 (11%) patients with RA tested positive for HACA at any time 
after receiving Rituxan.  HACA positivity was not associated with increased infusion 
reactions or other adverse reactions.  Upon further treatment, the proportions of 
patients with infusion reactions were similar between HACA positive and negative 
patients, and most reactions were mild to moderate.  Four HACA positive patients 
had serious infusion reactions, and the temporal relationship between HACA 
positivity and infusion reaction was variable.  The clinical relevance of HACA 
formation in Rituxan-treated patients is unclear. 
6.4 
Postmarketing Experience 
 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of 
Rituxan in hematologic malignancies.  Because these reactions are reported 
voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably 
estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.  
Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of 
the following factors:  (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or 
(3) strength of causal connection to Rituxan. 
• 
Hematologic:  prolonged pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late-onset 
neutropenia, hyperviscosity syndrome in Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. 
• 
Cardiac:  fatal cardiac failure. 
• 
Immune/Autoimmune Events:  uveitis, optic neuritis, systemic vasculitis, 
pleuritis, lupus-like syndrome, serum sickness, polyarticular arthritis, and 
vasculitis with rash. 
• 
Infection:  viral infections, including progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), increase in fatal infections in HIV-associated 
lymphoma, and a reported increased incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections in 
patients with previously treated lymphoma without known HIV infection. 
• 
Neoplasia:  disease progression of Kaposi’s sarcoma. 
• 
Skin:  severe mucocutaneous reactions. 
• 
Gastrointestinal:  bowel obstruction and perforation. 
• 
Pulmonary:  fatal bronchiolitis obliterans and pneumonitis (including 
interstitial pneumonitis).

DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with Rituxan.  In patients 
with CLL, Rituxan did not alter systemic exposure to fludarabine or 
cyclophosphamide.  In clinical trials of patients with RA, concomitant administration 
of methotrexate or cyclophosphamide did not alter the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. 
8 
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
8.1 
Pregnancy 
 
Category C:  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of rituximab in 
pregnant women.  Postmarketing data indicate that B-cell lymphocytopenia generally 
lasting less than six months can occur in infants exposed to rituximab in-utero.  
Rituximab was detected postnatally in the serum of infants exposed in-utero.   
 Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and moderate-severe rheumatoid arthritis are serious 
conditions that require treatment.  Rituximab should be used during pregnancy only if 
the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
 Reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys at maternal exposures similar to 
human therapeutic exposures showed no evidence of teratogenic effects.  However, 
B-cell lymphoid tissue was reduced in the offspring of treated dams.  The B-cell 
counts returned to normal levels, and immunologic function was restored within 
6 months of birth. 
8.3 
Nursing Mothers 
 It is not known whether Rituxan is secreted into human milk.  However, Rituxan is 
secreted in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys, and IgG is excreted in human 
milk.  Published data suggest that antibodies in breast milk do not enter the neonatal 
and infant circulations in substantial amounts.  The unknown risks to the infant from 
oral ingestion of Rituxan should be weighed against the known benefits of 
breastfeeding. 
8.4 
Pediatric Use 
 
FDA has not required pediatric studies in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (PJIA) patients ages 0 to 16 due to concerns regarding the potential for 
prolonged immunosuppression as a result of B cell depletion in the developing 
juvenile immune system. 
 The safety and effectiveness of Rituxan in pediatric patients have not been 
established. 
8.5 
Geriatric Use 
Diffuse Large B-Cell NHL 
 Among patients with DLBCL evaluated in three randomized, active-controlled 
trials, 927 patients received Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy.  Of these, 
396 (43%) were age 65 or greater and 123 (13%) were age 75 or greater.  No overall 
differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger 
patients.  Cardiac adverse reactions, mostly supraventricular arrhythmias, occurred 
more frequently among elderly patients.  Serious pulmonary adverse reactions were 
also more common among the elderly, including pneumonia and pneumonitis. 
Low-Grade or Follicular Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
 Clinical studies of Rituxan in low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL 
did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether 
they respond differently from younger subjects.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  
 Among patients with CLL evaluated in two randomized active-controlled trials, 
243 of 676 Rituxan-treated patients (36%) were 65 years of age or older; of these, 
100 Rituxan-treated patients (15%) were 70 years of age or older.  
 In exploratory analyses defined by age, there was no observed benefit from the 
addition of Rituxan to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide among patients 70 years of 
age or older in Study 9 or in Study 10; there was also no observed benefit from the 
addition of Rituxan to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide among patients 65 years of 
age or older in Study 10 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].  Patients 70 years or older 
received lower dose intensity of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide compared to 
younger patients, regardless of the addition of Rituxan.  In Study 9, the dose intensity 
of Rituxan was similar in older and younger patients, however in Study 10 older 
patients received a lower dose intensity of Rituxan.  
 The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions was higher among patients 
receiving R-FC who were 70 years or older compared to younger patients for 
neutropenia [44% vs. 31% (Study 9); 56% vs. 39% (Study 10)], febrile neutropenia 
[16% vs. 6% (Study 9)], anemia [5% vs. 2% (Study 9); 21% vs. 10% (Study 10)], 
thrombocytopenia [19% vs. 8% (Study 10)], pancytopenia [7% vs. 2% (Study 9); 
7% vs. 2% (Study 10)] and infections [30% vs. 14% (Study 10)]. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
 
Among the 2578 patients in global RA studies completed to date, 12% were 
65−75 years old and 2% were 75 years old and older.  The incidences of adverse 
reactions were similar between older and younger patients.  The rates of serious 
adverse reactions, including serious infections, malignancies, and cardiovascular 
events were higher in older patients.

OVERDOSAGE 
 There has been no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials.  Single 
doses of up to 500 mg/m2 have been administered in clinical trials. 
11 
DESCRIPTION 
 Rituxan® (rituximab) is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human 
monoclonal IgG1 kappa antibody directed against the CD20 antigen.  Rituximab has 
an approximate molecular weight of 145 kD.  Rituximab has a binding affinity for the 
CD20 antigen of approximately 8.0 nM. 
 Rituximab is produced by mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) suspension 
culture in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin.  Gentamicin is not 
detectable in the final product.  Rituxan is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free 
liquid concentrate for intravenous administration.  Rituxan is supplied at a 
concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use 
vials.  The product is formulated in 9 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium 
citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and Water for Injection.  The pH is 6.5. 
12 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
12.1 
Mechanism of Action 
 Rituximab binds specifically to the antigen CD20 (human B-lymphocyte-restricted 
differentiation antigen, Bp35), a hydrophobic transmembrane protein with a 
molecular weight of approximately 35 kD located on pre-B and mature B 
lymphocytes.  The antigen is expressed on  > 90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, 
pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues.  CD20 regulates an early

step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and 
possibly functions as a calcium ion channel.  CD20 is not shed from the cell surface 
and does not internalize upon antibody binding.  Free CD20 antigen is not found in 
the circulation. 
 B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
and associated chronic synovitis.  In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple 
sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of 
rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell 
activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production. 
 Mechanism of Action:  The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on 
B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate 
B-cell lysis in vitro.  Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC).  The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the 
DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line. 
 Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity:  Rituximab binding was observed on lymphoid 
cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in 
peripheral blood and lymph nodes.  Little or no binding was observed in the 
non-lymphoid tissues examined. 
12.2 
Pharmacodynamics 
 In NHL patients, administration of Rituxan resulted in depletion of circulating and 
tissue-based B cells.  Among 166 patients in Study 1, circulating CD19-positive B 
cells were depleted within the first three weeks with sustained depletion for up to 
6 to 9 months posttreatment in 83% of patients.  B-cell recovery began at 
approximately 6 months and median B-cell levels returned to normal by 12 months 
following completion of treatment. 
 There were sustained and statistically significant reductions in both IgM and IgG 
serum levels observed from 5 through 11 months following rituximab administration; 
14% of patients had IgM and/or IgG serum levels below the normal range. 
 In RA patients, treatment with Rituxan induced depletion of peripheral B 
lymphocytes, with the majority of patients demonstrating near complete depletion 
(CD19 counts below the lower limit of quantification, 20 cells/μl) within 2 weeks 
after receiving the first dose of Rituxan.  The majority of patients showed peripheral 
B-cell depletion for at least 6 months.  A small proportion of patients (~4%) had 
prolonged peripheral B-cell depletion lasting more than 3 years after a single course 
of treatment. 
 Total serum immunoglobulin levels, IgM, IgG, and IgA were reduced at 6 months 
with the greatest change observed in IgM.  At Week 24 of the first course of Rituxan 
treatment, small proportions of patients experienced decreases in IgM (10%), IgG 
(2.8%), and IgA (0.8%) levels below the lower limit of normal (LLN).  In the 
experience with Rituxan in RA patients during repeated Rituxan treatment, 23.3%, 
5.5%, and 0.5% of patients experienced decreases in IgM, IgG, and IgA 
concentrations below LLN at any time after receiving Rituxan, respectively.  The 
clinical consequences of decreases in immunoglobulin levels in RA patients treated 
with Rituxan are unclear. 
 Treatment with rituximab in patients with RA was associated with reduction of 
certain biologic markers of inflammation such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive 
protein (CRP), serum amyloid protein (SAA), S100 A8/S100 A9 heterodimer 
complex (S100 A8/9), anti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), and RF.

Pharmacokinetics 
 Pharmacokinetics were characterized in 203 NHL patients receiving 375 mg/m2 
Rituxan weekly by IV infusion for 4 doses.  Rituximab was detectable in the serum of 
patients 3 to 6 months after completion of treatment. 
 The pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 
375 mg/m2 in combination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that 
seen with rituximab alone. 
 Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from 298 NHL patients 
who received rituximab once weekly or once every three weeks, the estimated median 
terminal elimination half-life was 22 days (range, 6.1 to 52 days).  Patients with 
higher CD19-positive cell counts or larger measurable tumor lesions at pretreatment 
had a higher clearance.  However, dose adjustment for pretreatment CD19 count or 
size of tumor lesion is not necessary.  Age and gender had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of rituximab. 
 Pharmacokinetics were characterized in 21 patients with CLL receiving rituximab 
according to the recommended dose and schedule.  The estimated median terminal 
half-life of rituximab was 32 days (range, 14 to 62 days). 
 
Following administration of 2 doses of Rituxan in patients with RA, the mean 
( ± S.D.; % CV) concentrations after the first infusion (Cmax first) and second 
infusion (Cmax second) were 157 ( ± 46; 29%) and 183 ( ± 55; 30%) mcg/mL, and 
318 ( ± 86; 27%) and 381 ( ± 98; 26%) mcg/mL for the 2 × 500 mg and 2 × 1000 mg 
doses, respectively. 
 Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from 2005 RA patients 
who received Rituxan, the estimated clearance of rituximab was 0.335 L/day; volume 
of distribution was 3.1 L and mean terminal elimination half-life was 18.0 days 
(range, 5.17 to 77.5 days).  Age, weight and gender had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of rituximab in RA patients. 
 
The pharmacokinetics of rituximab have not been studied in children and 
adolescents.  No formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of either renal 
or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab.

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
13.1 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
 No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic or 
mutagenic potential of Rituxan or to determine potential effects on fertility in males 
or females. 
13.2 
Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology 
Reproductive Toxicology Studies 
 An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys.  Pregnant animals received rituximab via the intravenous route 
during early gestation (organogenesis period; post-coitum days 20 through 50).  
Rituximab was administered as loading doses on post-coitum (PC) days 20, 21 and 
22, at 15, 37.5 or 75 mg/kg/day, and then weekly on PC Days 29, 36, 43 and 50, at 
20, 50 or 100 mg/kg/week.  The 100 mg/kg/week dose resulted in 80% of the 
exposure (based on AUC) of those achieved following a dose of 2 grams in humans. 
Rituximab crosses the monkey placenta.  Exposed offspring did not exhibit any 
teratogenic effects but did have decreased lymphoid tissue B cells. 
 A subsequent pre- and postnatal reproductive toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys was completed to assess developmental effects including the recovery of 
B cells and immune function in infants exposed to rituximab in utero.  Animals were

treated with a loading dose of 0, 15, or 75 mg/kg every day for 3 days, followed by 
weekly dosing with 0, 20, or 100 mg/kg dose. Subsets of pregnant females were 
treated from PC Day 20 through postpartum Day 78, PC Day 76 through PC Day 134, 
and from PC Day 132 through delivery and postpartum Day 28. Regardless of the 
timing of treatment, decreased B cells and immunosuppression were noted in the 
offspring of rituximab-treated pregnant animals.  The B-cell counts returned to 
normal levels, and immunologic function was restored within 6 months postpartum.

CLINICAL STUDIES 
14.1 
Relapsed or Refractory, Low-Grade or Follicular, CD20-Positive, B-Cell 
NHL 
 The safety and effectiveness of Rituxan in relapsed, refractory CD20+ NHL were 
demonstrated in 3 single-arm studies enrolling 296 patients. 
Study 1 
 A multicenter, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in 166 patients with 
relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, B-cell NHL who received 375 mg/m2 
of Rituxan given as an intravenous infusion weekly for 4 doses.  Patients with tumor 
masses > 10 cm or with > 5000 lymphocytes/μL in the peripheral blood were 
excluded from the study. 
 Results are summarized in Table 3.  The median time to onset of response was 
50 days. Disease-related signs and symptoms (including B-symptoms) resolved in 
64% (25/39) of those patients with such symptoms at study entry. 
Study 2 
 In a multicenter, single-arm study, 37 patients with relapsed or refractory, 
low-grade NHL received 375 mg/m2 of Rituxan weekly for 8 doses.  Results are 
summarized in Table 3. 
Study 3 
 In a multicenter, single-arm study, 60 patients received 375 mg/m2 of Rituxan 
weekly for 4 doses.  All patients had relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, 
B-cell NHL and had achieved an objective clinical response to Rituxan administered 
3.8−35.6 months (median 14.5 months) prior to retreatment with Rituxan.  Of these 
60 patients, 5 received more than one additional course of Rituxan.  Results are 
summarized in Table 3. 
Bulky Disease 
 In pooled data from studies 1 and 3, 39 patients with bulky (single lesion  > 10 cm 
in diameter) and relapsed or refractory, low-grade NHL received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 
weekly for 4 doses.  Results are summarized in Table 3.

Previously Untreated, Follicular, CD20-Positive, B-Cell NHL 
Study 4 
 A total of 322 patients with previously untreated follicular NHL were randomized 
(1:1) to receive up to eight 3-week cycles of CVP chemotherapy alone (CVP) or in 
combination with Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each cycle (R-CVP) in an 
open-label, multicenter study.  The main outcome measure of the study was 
progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first of 
progression, relapse, or death. 
 Twenty-six percent of the study population was  > 60 years of age, 99% had 
Stage III or IV disease, and 50% had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score 
 ≥ 2.  The results for PFS as determined by a blinded, independent assessment of 
progression are presented in Table 4.  The point estimates may be influenced by the 
presence of informative censoring.  The PFS results based on investigator assessment 
of progression were similar to those obtained by the independent review assessment.

Study 5 
 A total of 322 patients with previously untreated low-grade, B-cell NHL who did 
not progress after 6 or 8 cycles of CVP chemotherapy were enrolled in an open-label, 
multicenter, randomized trial.  Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive Rituxan, 
375 mg/m2 intravenous infusion, once weekly for 4 doses every 6 months for up to 
16 doses or no further therapeutic intervention.  The main outcome measure of the 
study was progression-free survival defined as the time from randomization to

progression, relapse, or death.  Thirty-seven percent of the study population was 
 > 60 years of age, 99% had Stage III or IV disease, and 63% had an IPI score  ≥ 2.   
 There was a reduction in the risk of progression, relapse, or death (hazard ratio 
estimate in the range of 0.36 to 0.49) for patients randomized to Rituxan as compared 
to those who received no additional treatment.

Diffuse Large B-Cell NHL (DLBCL) 
 The safety and effectiveness of Rituxan were evaluated in three randomized, 
active-controlled, open-label, multicenter studies with a collective enrollment of 
1854 patients.  Patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell NHL received 
Rituxan in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. 
Study 6 
 A total of 632 patients age  ≥ 60 years with DLBCL (including primary mediastinal 
B-cell lymphoma) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with CHOP or 
R-CHOP.  Patients received 6 or 8 cycles of CHOP, each cycle lasting 21 days.  All 
patients in the R-CHOP arm received 4 doses of Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on Days −7 and 
−3 (prior to Cycle 1) and 48−72 hours prior to Cycles 3 and 5.  Patients who received 
8 cycles of CHOP also received Rituxan prior to Cycle 7.  The main outcome 
measure of the study was progression-free survival, defined as the time from 
randomization to the first of progression, relapse, or death.  Responding patients 
underwent a second randomization to receive Rituxan or no further therapy. 
 Among all enrolled patients, 62% had centrally confirmed DLBCL histology, 73% 
had Stage III−IV disease, 56% had IPI scores  ≥ 2, 86% had ECOG performance 
status of  < 2, 57% had elevated LDH levels, and 30% had two or more extranodal 
disease sites involved.  Efficacy results are presented in Table 5.  These results reflect 
a statistical approach which allows for an evaluation of Rituxan administered in the 
induction setting that excludes any potential impact of Rituxan given after the second 
randomization. 
 Analysis of results after the second randomization in Study 6 demonstrates that for 
patients randomized to R-CHOP, additional Rituxan exposure beyond induction was 
not associated with further improvements in progression-free survival or overall 
survival. 
Study 7 
 A total of 399 patients with DLBCL, age  ≥ 60 years, were randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive CHOP or R-CHOP.  All patients received up to eight 3-week 
cycles of CHOP induction; patients in the R-CHOP arm received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 
on Day 1 of each cycle.  The main outcome measure of the study was event-free 
survival, defined as the time from randomization to relapse, progression, change in 
therapy, or death from any cause.  Among all enrolled patients, 80% had Stage III or 
IV disease, 60% of patients had an age-adjusted IPI  ≥ 2, 80% had ECOG 
performance status scores  < 2, 66% had elevated LDH levels, and 52% had 
extranodal involvement in at least two sites.  Efficacy results are presented in Table 5. 
Study 8 
 A total of 823 patients with DLBCL, aged 18−60 years, were randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen alone or in 
combination with Rituxan.  The main outcome measure of the study was time to 
treatment failure, defined as time from randomization to the earliest of progressive 
disease, failure to achieve a complete response, relapse, or death.  Among all enrolled

and 34% had extranodal involvement.  Efficacy results are presented in Table 5.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) 
 The safety and effectiveness of Rituxan were evaluated in two randomized (1:1) 
multicenter open-label studies comparing FC alone or in combination with Rituxan 
for up to 6 cycles in patients with previously untreated CLL [Study 9 (n = 817)] or 
previously treated CLL [Study 10 (n = 552)].  Patients received fludarabine 
25 mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2 and 3 of each 
cycle, with or without Rituxan.  In both studies, seventy-one percent of CLL patients 
received 6 cycles and 90% received at least 3 cycles of Rituxan-based therapy. 
 In Study 9, 30% of patients were 65 years or older, 31% were Binet stage C, 45% 
had B symptoms, more than 99% had ECOG performance status (PS) 0−1, 74% were 
male, and 100% were White.  In Study 10, 44% of patients were 65 years or older, 
28% had B symptoms, 82% received a prior alkylating drug, 18% received prior 
fludarabine, 100% had ECOG PS 0−1, 67% were male and 98% were White. 
 The main outcome measure in both studies was progression-free survival (PFS), 
defined as the time from randomization to progression, relapse, or death, as 
determined by investigators (Study 9) or an independent review committee 
(Study 10).  The investigator assessed results in Study 10 were supportive of those 
obtained by the independent review committee.  Efficacy results are presented in

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) 
Reducing the Signs and Symptoms: Initial and Re-Treatment Courses 
 
The efficacy and safety of Rituxan were evaluated in two randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult patients with moderately to severely 
active RA who had a prior inadequate response to at least one TNF inhibitor.  Patients 
were 18 years of age or older, diagnosed with active RA according to American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and had at least 8 swollen and 8 tender 
joints. 
 In RA Study 1, patients were randomized to receive either Rituxan 
2 × 1000 mg + MTX or placebo + MTX for 24 weeks.  Further courses of Rituxan 
2 × 1000 mg + MTX were administered in an open label extension study at a 
frequency determined by clinical evaluation, but no sooner than 16 weeks after the 
preceding course of Rituxan.  In addition to the IV premedication, glucocorticoids 
were administered orally on a tapering schedule from baseline through Day 14.  The 
proportions of patients achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses at Week 24 of the 
placebo-controlled period are shown in Table 8.

 In RA Study 2, all patients received the first course of Rituxan 
2 × 1000 mg + MTX.  Patients who experienced ongoing disease activity were 
randomized to receive a second course of either Rituxan 2 × 1000 mg  MTX or 
placebo + MTX, the majority between Weeks 24–28.  The proportions of patients 
achieving ACR 20, 50, and 70 responses at Week 24, before the re-treatment course, 
and at Week 48, after retreatment, are shown in Table 8.

The time course of ACR 20 response for Study 1 is shown in Figure 1.  Although 
both treatment groups received a brief course of intravenous and oral glucocorticoids, 
resulting in similar benefits at Week 4, higher ACR 20 responses were observed for 
the Rituxan group by Week 8.  A similar proportion of patients achieved these 
responses through Week 24 after a single course of treatment (2 infusions) with 
Rituxan.  Similar patterns were demonstrated for ACR 50 and 70 responses.

Radiographic Response 
 
In RA Study 1, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and 
expressed as changes in Genant-modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its 
components, the erosion score (ES) and the joint space narrowing (JSN) score.  
Rituxan  + MTX slowed the progression of structural damage compared to placebo 
 + MTX after 1 year as shown in Table 10.

 In RA Study 1 and its open-label extension, 70% of patients initially randomized to 
Rituxan  + MTX and 72% of patients initially randomized to placebo  + MTX were 
evaluated radiographically at Year 2.  As shown in Table 10, progression of structural 
damage in Rituxan  + MTX patients was further reduced in the second year of 
treatment. 
 Following 2 years of treatment with Rituxan  + MTX, 57% of patients had no 
progression of structural damage.  During the first year, 60% of Rituxan  + MTX 
treated patients had no progression, defined as a change in TSS of zero or less 
compared to baseline, compared to 46% of placebo  + MTX treated patients.  In their 
second year of treatment with Rituxan  + MTX, more patients had no progression 
than in the first year (68% vs. 60%), and 87% of the Rituxan  + MTX treated patients 
who had no progression in the first year also had no progression in the second year. 
Lesser Efficacy of 500 Vs. 1000 mg Treatment Courses for Radiographic Outcomes 
 RA Study 3 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which 
evaluated the effect of placebo  + MTX compared to Rituxan 2 x 500 mg  + MTX and 
Rituxan 2 x 1000 mg  + MTX treatment courses in MTX-naïve RA patients with 
moderately to severely active disease.  Patients received a first course of two 
infusions of rituximab or placebo on Days 1 and 15. MTX was initiated at 
7.5 mg/week and escalated up to 20 mg/week by week 8 in all three treatment arms.  
After a minimum of 24 weeks, patients with ongoing disease activity were eligible to 
receive re-treatment with additional courses of their assigned treatment.  After one 
year of treatment, the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20/50/70 responses were 
similar in both Rituxan dose groups and were higher than in the placebo group.  
However, with respect to radiographic scores, only the Rituxan 1000 mg treatment 
group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in TSS: a change of 0.36 units 
compared to 1.08 units for the placebo group, a 67% reduction.

Physical Function Response 
 RA Study 4 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult RA 
patients with moderately to severely active disease with inadequate response to MTX.  
Patients were randomized to receive an initial course of Rituxan 500 mg, Rituxan 
1000 mg, or placebo in addition to background MTX. 
 Physical function was assessed at Weeks 24 and 48 using the Health Assessment 
Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). From baseline to Week 24, a greater 
proportion of Rituxan-treated patients had an improvement in HAQ-DI of at least 
0.22 (a minimal clinically important difference) and a greater mean 
HAQ-DI improvement compared to placebo, as shown in Table 11.  HAQ-DI results 
for the Rituxan 500 mg treatment group were similar to the Rituxan 1000 mg 
treatment group; however radiographic responses were not assessed (see Dosing 
Precaution in the Radiographic Responses section above).  These improvements were 
maintained at 48 weeks.

MEDICATION GUIDE 
RITUXAN® (ri-tuk´-san) 
(rituximab) 
for injection 
Read this Medication Guide before you start Rituxan and before each Rituxan 
infusion.  There may be new information.  This Medication Guide does not take the 
place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment.  
What is the most important information I should know about Rituxan? 
Rituxan can cause serious side effects that can lead to death, including: 
1. Infusion reactions. Infusion reactions are the most common side effect of 
966 
Rituxan treatment. Serious infusion reactions can happen during your infusion or 
within 24 hours after your infusion of Rituxan.  Your doctor should give you 
medicines before your infusion of Rituxan to decrease your chance of having a 
severe infusion reaction. 
Tell your doctor or get medical help right away if you get any of these symptoms 
during or after an infusion of Rituxan: 
• hives (red itchy welts) or rash 
• itching 
• swelling of your lips, tongue, throat or face 
• sudden cough 
• shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or wheezing 
• weakness 
• dizziness or feel faint 
• palpitations (feel like your heart is racing or fluttering) 
• chest pain 
2. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).  PML is a rare, serious 
982 
brain infection caused by a virus.  People with weakened immune system can get 
PML.  Your chance of getting PML may be higher if you are treated with Rituxan 
alone or with other medicines that weaken your immune system.  PML can result 
in death or severe disability.  There is no known treatment, prevention, or cure for 
PML. 
Tell your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms or if 
anyone close to you notices these symptoms: 
• confusion or problems thinking 
• loss of balance  
• change in the way you walk or talk 
• decreased strength or weakness on one side of your body 
• blurred vision or loss of vision 
3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS).  TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer 
995 
cells. TLS can cause you to have: 
• kidney failure and the need for dialysis treatment
