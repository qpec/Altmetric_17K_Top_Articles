Abstract
Background—The relationship between cannabis use and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) over 
time remains unclear. The current study used longitudinal data from adults in the United States 
(U.S.) to investigate the association between cannabis use and risk of onset and persistence of 
AUDs three years later.
Methods—The study used data from respondents who completed both waves of the National 
Epidemiological Study of Alcohol Use and Related Disorders (NESARC; Wave 1, 2001–2001; 
Wave 2, 2004–2005) and for whom the age of first cannabis use preceded the age of any AUD. 
Incident AUDs were examined among respondents with no lifetime AUD diagnosis at Wave 1 (n= 
27,461). Persistent AUDs were examined among respondents with a lifetime AUD diagnosis at 
Wave 1 (n=2,121).
Results—Among adults with no history of AUD, cannabis use at Wave 1 was associated with 
increased incidence of an AUD three years later relative to no cannabis use (Odds Ratio

 (OR)=5.43; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=4.54–6.49). Among adults with a history of AUD, 
cannabis use at Wave 1 was associated with increased likelihood of AUD persistence three years 
later relative to no cannabis use (OR=1.74; 95% CI=1.56–1.95). These relationships remained 
significant after controlling for demographics, psychiatric disorders, and other substance use 
disorders.
Conclusions—Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of AUD onset and persistence over 
the course of three years among U.S. adults. Community-based and clinical programs aimed at 
preventing or treating problematic alcohol use may benefit from integrating information about 
cannabis use in order to improve outcomes.

1. INTRODUCTION
Alcohol use-related disease and accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. 
(CDC, 2004; Stahre et al., 2014). For adults, there is a significant association between 
alcohol and cannabis use (e.g., Butterworth et al., 2014; Hyggen and Hammer, 2014) and 
use of alcohol and cannabis, compared to alcohol alone, is associated with heavier alcohol 
consumption and greater negative alcohol-related consequences (e.g., Hyggen and Hammer, 
2014; Midanik et al., 2007; Subbaraman and Kerr, 2015). Less is known about the 
association between cannabis use and alcohol use disorders (AUDs). In a study using Wave 
1 data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions 
(NESARC), cannabis dependence was significantly associated with a reduced likelihood of 
remission from alcohol dependence in univariate analyses (HR=0.55, 95% CI=0.32, 0.94), 
but this relationship was no longer significant in multivariate analyses (HR=0.64, 95% 
CI=0.37–1.13; Lopez-Quintero et al., 2011). It is not yet clear how cannabis use may be 
related to the onset and persistence of AUDs over time. Given the relationship of cannabis 
use to alcohol-related problems, it is important to gain a better understanding these potential 
relationships.
The current study used longitudinal data from a representative sample of U.S. adults to 
examine the association between cannabis use and the risk of onset and persistence of 
AUDs. It was expected that cannabis use among adults with no history of AUDs would be 
associated with greater risk of onset of AUDs three years later. It was also expected that 
cannabis use among adults with AUDs would be associated with greater risk of persistence 
of AUDs three years later. Further, the study explored whether the relationships between 
cannabis use and AUDs would persist after adjusting for demographics, psychiatric 
disorders, nicotine dependence, and other illicit drug use disorders
2. METHODS
2.1. Data Source and Study Population
The study used two waves of data from the National Epidemiological Study of Alcohol Use 
and Related Disorders (NESARC; Wave 1, 2001–2001, n=43,093; Wave 2, 2004–2005,

 n=34,653) which surveyed a population representative sample of civilian, non-
institutionalized, adults in the U.S. The study used a two-wave multistage stratified design in 
which primary sampling units, housing units, and group-quarter units were stratified to 
oversample certain under-represented socio-demographic groups, specifically, non-Hispanic 
Black, Hispanic, and young (ages 18–24) adults. The final data were weighted according to 
the demographic distribution of the U.S. population based on the 2000 census. Details 
regarding study design and administration have been described elsewhere (Grant et al., 2003; 
Grant and Kaplan, 2005).
2.2. Material and Methods
2.2.1. Alcohol use disorders—AUD diagnoses were determined using the NIAAA 
Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule–Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Version (AUDADIS-IV), 
a fully structured diagnostic interview instrument (Grant et al., 2001) with good to excellent 
reliability and validity (Grant et al., 1995). To preserve statistical power and be as consistent 
as possible with the criteria for substance use disorders in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), 
participants who received diagnoses of either alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence were 
classified as having an AUD.
2.2.2. Cannabis use and use disorder—Diagnosis of a cannabis use disorder was 
based on meeting criteria for items covering the DSM-IV criteria (APA, 1994). Cannabis use 
disorder was defined in the DSM-IV as increased tolerance, compulsive use, impaired 
control, and continued use despite physical and psychological problems caused or 
exacerbated by use during the year prior to the Wave 1 interview. Cannabis use was defined 
as any use of cannabis in the year prior to Wave 1 that did not meet criteria for a cannabis 
use disorder.
2.2.3. Socio-demographic covariates and other potential confounders—
Following previously established rationale (Miettinen and Cook, 1981), socio-demographic 
covariates included gender, age, level of education, race/ethnicity groups (Asian/Pacific 
Islander, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Native American/Alaskan, and non-Hispanic 
White), marital status (married/living with someone as married, widowed, divorced/
separated, single), and income. Gender, race/ethnicity, and marital status were discrete 
variables while age, education, and income were continuous variables.
A summary dichotomous variable was created to for the presence of lifetime psychiatric 
disorders as measured at Wave 1, including major depression, manic depression, dysthymia, 
hypomania, panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, agoraphobia, social and specific 
phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention deficit-
hyperactivity disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and 
schizotypal or narcissistic personality disorder. Also, a dichotomous variable was created to 
adjust for any co-morbid DSM-IV substance use disorder including nicotine, sedatives, 
tranquilizers, opioids, heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants/solvents, and 
other drugs.

 2.3. Statistical Analysis
2.3.1. Analytic samples—Our full analytic sample included respondents who completed 
both waves of data collection, responded to all questions regarding cannabis and alcohol, 
and for whom the age of first cannabis use preceded the age of any AUD (n= 29,582; 69% of 
the original Wave 1 sample). From this full analytic sample, two separate subsamples were 
created to address our study questions. To examine incident AUDs, the sample was restricted 
to respondents with no lifetime AUD diagnosis prior to the Wave 1 interview (n= 27,461; 
93% of the full analytic sample). To examine persistent AUD, the sample was restricted to 
respondents with a lifetime AUD diagnosis at Wave 1 (n=2,121; 7% of the full analytic 
sample).
2.3.2. Sample frequencies—The frequency of AUDs at Wave 2 was compared among 
those with and without Wave 1 cannabis use. Standard errors were computed using Taylor 
series linearization and frequency differences were tested using Rao Scott chi-squared tests 
to account for complex survey design. Due to the small number of participants who reported 
a Wave 1 cannabis use disorder (n=42 for participants with no Wave 1 AUD diagnosis and 
n=199 for participants with a Wave 1 AUD diagnosis), comparisons of Wave 2 AUD 
diagnoses by cannabis use disorder were not conducted.
2.3.3. Regression modeling—A series of logistic regression models were run to model 
the odds of Wave 1 cannabis use and Wave 2 AUD status. A crude model was run to 
determine the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of an AUD by cannabis use status (labeled as OR1 
in Table 2). Then, four additional models were run to control for potential confounders and 
covariates measured at Wave 1. The first adjusted model controlled for socio-demographic 
covariates (OR2). A second model adjusted for lifetime history of psychiatric disorders 
(OR3). The third model adjusted for lifetime nicotine dependence and other illicit drug use 
disorders (OR4), and the fourth model included all covariates from the three previous 
models (OR2 through OR4; labeled as OR5).
All tests were completed in STATA using weighted analysis (StataCorp, 2011) to account for 
residual differences between the sample and the population profile, according to the 2000 
United States Population Census, as well as to account for nonresponse and sample attrition.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Socio-demographics (Table 1)
Among respondents with no lifetime AUD diagnosis at Wave 1 (n=27,461), 27,301 
respondents (99.3%) reported no cannabis use while 160 respondents (0.7%) reported 
cannabis use in the year prior to the Wave 1 assessment. Wave 1 past year cannabis use was 
significantly higher among respondents who were: men, age 18–44, Native American/
Alaskan Native, never married, and those who had completed a high school education, 
compared with those who reported no cannabis use. There was no difference in cannabis use 
by income level. The prevalence of AUDs was highest among respondents who were men, 
age 18–29, Hispanic, never married, reported an income of less than 35,000, and completed 
high school.

 Among respondents who reported a lifetime AUD diagnosis at Wave 1 (n=2,121), 1,705 
respondents (78.4%) reported no cannabis use while 416 respondents (21.6%) reported 
cannabis use in the year prior to the Wave 1 assessment. Among those who reported a 
lifetime AUD diagnosis at Wave 1, Wave 1 past year cannabis use was significantly higher 
among respondents who were: men, age 18–29, Native American/Alaskan Native, never 
married, and those with less than a high school education and an income of $0–19,999, 
compared with those who did not use cannabis. The prevalence of AUDs followed the same 
general pattern as seen in cannabis use among this sample.
3.2. Wave 2 AUDs by Wave 1 cannabis use (Table 2)
Among those with no lifetime AUD at Wave 1, 23.3% of Wave 1 cannabis users reported a 
Wave 2 AUD compared to 5.3% of Wave 1 cannabis non-users. As shown in Table 2, Wave 
1 respondents with no history of AUD at Wave 1 who reported Wave 1 cannabis users were 
5.43 times more likely to report incident AUD compared to Wave 1 non-cannabis users 
(95% CI: 4.54–6.49). Wave 2 incident AUD was robust to adjustment in each of the separate 
and combined models. In the fully-adjusted model (OR5), Wave 1 cannabis users had a 2.12 
times greater odds of incident AUDs compared to Wave 1 non-users (95% CI: 1.70–2.64).
Among those with lifetime AUDs at Wave 1, 59.1% of cannabis users reported a Wave 1 
AUD compared to 45.4% of Wave 1 cannabis non-users. As shown in Table 2, among 
respondents with a lifetime diagnosis of an AUD at Wave 1, the unadjusted odds of a 
persistent AUD at Wave 2 were 1.74 times higher among cannabis users at Wave 1, 
compared with non-users at Wave 1 (95% CI: 1.56–1.95). The odds ratios were robust to 
adjustment by demographic covariates, Wave 1 lifetime psychiatric disorders, and Wave 1 
lifetime nicotine dependence and other illicit drug use disorders. Estimates did not 
appreciably change when the co-morbid substance use disorder covariate was dichotomized 
by injectable (e.g., heroin, cocaine) and non-injectable (e.g., sedatives, hallucinogens) 
substances (data not shown). The fully adjusted odds of persistent AUD were 1.32 times 
higher among Wave 1 cannabis users, compared with non-users (95% CI: 1.17–1.50).
4. DISCUSSION
The results from this study suggest a significant relationship between cannabis use and 
subsequent increased risk of AUDs for adults without a past AUD and risk of continued 
AUD for adults with an AUD. These relationships remain robust after controlling for 
demographics, psychiatric disorders, and other substance use disorders. From a public health 
standpoint, it may be important to conduct further research on the relationship between 
cannabis and AUDs as well as other problematic alcohol-related outcomes. From a clinical 
perspective, it may be useful for cannabis treatment programs to consider assessing and 
monitoring problematic alcohol use as well as integrating topics related to alcohol (e.g., 
reasons for use, methods to decrease or stop use) into their programs.
It is important to note limitations of this study. Use of alcohol, cannabis, and other drugs 
were self-reported and not biochemically confirmed which may have led to underreporting 
of substance use especially for illegal substances. Due to the small sample of participants 
who reported cannabis use, we were not able to reliably examine the associations between

 either the frequency of cannabis use or a cannabis use disorder diagnosis with AUDs. Future 
studies with larger samples of cannabis users should examine the association of frequency of 
cannabis use and a diagnosis of a cannabis use disorder to incident and persistent AUDs. 
Variables in the NESARC study were assessed at two time points and there was no 
information available regarding the timing or context of changes in cannabis or alcohol use 
behavior (e.g., the timing or context of the start of an AUD). It would be useful for future 
studies to examine contexts related to changes in the use of alcohol and cannabis and how 
changes in the use of cannabis (increases, decreases, initiation, and cessation) impacts 
changes in the use of alcohol. Finally, the NESARC study excluded individuals who were 
institutionalized, incarcerated, under the age of 18, or lived outside of the United States and 
results may not generalize to these groups.
In sum, our results suggest that cannabis use, compared to no cannabis use, is associated 
with increased risk of incident AUD among those without any history of AUD and an 
increased likelihood of persistence of AUD over a three-year period. Additional attention to 
alcohol use, alcohol use disorders, and alcohol-related problems among adults who use 
cannabis may be warranted.
