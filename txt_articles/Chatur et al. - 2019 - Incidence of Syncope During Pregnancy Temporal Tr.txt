Background-—We examined temporal trends, timing, and frequency, as well as adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes occurring
in the first year postpartum among women experiencing syncope during pregnancy.
Methods and Results-—This was a retrospective study of pregnancies between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, in the
province of Alberta, Canada. Of 481 930 pregnancies, 4667 had an episode of syncope. Poisson regression analysis found a 5%
increase/year (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04–1.06) in the age-adjusted incidence of syncope. Overall, 1506 (32.3%) of the syncope
episodes first occurred in the first trimester, 2058 (44.1%) in the second trimester, and 1103 (23.6%) in the third trimester; and 8%
(n=377) of pregnancies had >1 episode of syncope. Compared with women without syncope, women who experienced syncope
were younger (age <25 years; 34.7% versus 20.8%; P<0.001), and primiparous (52.1% versus 42.4%; P<0.001). The rate of preterm
birth was higher in pregnancies with syncope during the first trimester (18.3%), compared with the second (15.8%) and third
trimesters (14.2%) and pregnancies without syncope (15.0%; P<0.01). The incidence of congenital anomalies among children born
of pregnancies with multiple syncope episodes was significantly higher (4.9%) compared with children of pregnancies without
syncope (2.9%; P<0.01). Within 1 year after delivery, women with syncope during pregnancy had higher rates of cardiac
arrhythmias and syncope episodes than women with no syncope during pregnancy.
Conclusions-—Pregnant women with syncope, especially when the syncopal event occurs during the first trimester, may be
at a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as an increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmia and syncope postpartum.

yncope is the sudden, transient loss of consciousness
that occurs as a result of global cerebral hypoperfusion.1
It is a relatively common clinical problem, presenting in a
bimodal distribution, with the highest incidence occurring
between ages 10 to 30 and in patients older than 65 years.2
The most common cause of syncope in adolescents and
young adults, including women of childbearing age, is
vasovagal syncope.
Syncope may be a manifestation of a number of clinical
conditions occurring on a spectrum of severity from deadly
underlying heart conditions such as arrhythmia to benign
conditions such as vasovagal episodes. This is reflected in the
prognosis of 1-year mortality estimates ranging from as low
as 0% for vasovagal syncope up to 30% in the context of
cardiac syncope.3 Moreover, it has been shown that there is a
significant association between syncope and the presence of
cardiovascular disease, and the relationship appears to be
stronger among young people.4 The pregnant mother under-
goes a number of hemodynamic changes5 including reduced
systemic vascular resistance, increased blood volume and
heart rate, and eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle.
These changes may predispose her to the development of
syncope.6
There are currently limited data on the incidence of
syncope in pregnancy.7 Moreover, the effect of a transient fall
in blood pressure on maternal and fetal outcomes is not well
described. While most case reports suggest a benign course
for both mother and child, there are no long-term follow-up

 data. Given this paucity of evidence, we sought to describe
temporal trends in the incidence of syncope during pregnancy
using a large, contemporary, population-based cohort of
women in a defined geographic area with a single-payer
healthcare system with universal access. Additionally, neona-
tal outcomes, including rates of preterm birth, small for
gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age, and congen-
ital anomalies were examined, overall, and according to the
timing (first occurrence in first, second, or third trimester),
and number (≥1) of syncope episodes during pregnancy. The
frequency of syncope and other cardiovascular events in the
mother in the year following the delivery was also evaluated.
Methods
Data for the study were received from the Alberta Ministry of
Health (Alberta Health). The data are proprietary and not
available publicly. Aggregate data are available upon request.
Study approval was received from the University of Alberta
Ethics Board. Due to the retrospective, deidentified nature of
the study, informed consent from participants was not required.
Study Design and Data Source
This retrospective cohort study used the longitudinal Alberta
Pregnancy-Birth cohort,8 consisting of all live births between
January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, in the province of
Alberta, Canada. The cohort has been described in detail
previously.8–10 In brief, the cohort was identified from the
Alberta Vital Statistics—Birth Database, which contains
detailed birth information, including birth date, sex, birth
weight, gestational age, maternal age at delivery, singleton/
multiple birth status, and parity. Data from the Alberta Vital
Statistics—Birth Database were linked with the following data
for mothers and their offspring using a unique scrambled
identifier: (1) hospitalization data from the Discharge Abstract
Database; (2) ambulatory care data, including visits to the
emergency departments and hospital-based outpatient clinics,
from
the
National
Ambulatory
Care
Reporting
System
database; (3) physician office visits from the practitioners
claims database; (4) demographic data from the Alberta
Health Care Insurance Population registry; and (5) date of
death from the Vital Statistics—Death Database. Data on the
neighborhood-level household income were obtained from the
2010 Population Census data.11
Study Population
All pregnant women with a gestational age of 15 to 43 weeks
who delivered live births between January 1, 2005, and
December 31, 2014, and their offspring, were included in the
study. Women who were not residents of Alberta at the time
of delivery were excluded. A flowchart (diagram) of the study
cohort selection is provided as Figure S1. Women with
syncope during pregnancy were identified as those having an
International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
code 780.2 or Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code R55 in any
diagnosis field of their inpatient, outpatient, or physician
office visit record during the gestation period. The ICD-9 and
ICD-10 codes of syncope have a moderate sensitivity of 63%,
high specificity of 98% to 99%, and a positive predictive value
of 83% to 95%.12,13
Demographic, Clinical, and Obstetric Data
In addition to maternal age at the time of delivery, the Alberta
Health Care Insurance Population data were used to identify
women who had identified themselves as Status Aboriginal.
This flag was available for all residents before 2009.
Previously developed lists of surnames were applied to the
surnames in the Alberta Health Care Insurance Population
registry to identify pregnancies of women of South Asian and
Chinese ethnicity.14–16 These algorithms have been validated
against self-identified ethnicity in the Canadian Community
Health Survey. Based on the ethnic distribution of the
population of Alberta, women who were not South Asian or
Chinese were most likely white and categorized as General
Population.17 Women were categorized as living in rural or
urban areas based on the first numerical digit of their postal
code. The annual household income at the neighborhood level
from census data was used as a measure of socioeconomic
status.
Women with preexisting diabetes mellitus or cardiovascu-
lar disease or other medical conditions before pregnancy,
such as lupus, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, or liver disease, were identified on the basis of the
delivery hospitalization and any previous hospitalization
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Syncope during pregnancy, especially when it occurs during
the first trimester, may be associated with higher rates of
adverse outcomes including preterm births, congenital
anomalies, and an increased incidence of maternal cardiac
arrhythmias and syncope in the first-year postpartum.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Given the observed higher rates of adverse outcomes
among women experiencing syncope in pregnancy, closer
monitoring both during pregnancy and in the postpartum
period may be necessitated.

 (Discharge Abstract Database) or ambulatory (National Ambu-
latory Care Reporting System) record as of April 1, 1997.
Pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes mel-
litus and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (including
preeclampsia and eclampsia), were identified if they were
coded on the delivery hospitalization records. The complete
list of ICD codes used to identify clinical comorbidities is
provided in Table S1.
The delivery hospitalization record was used to identify
children who were born via cesarean section. On the basis of
previous studies, large for gestational age and SGA were
defined as birth weights <10% and >90%, respectively,
compared with neonates of the same gestational age and sex.18
Outcomes
We examined the annual incidence of syncope during
pregnancy, as well as its overall incidence by trimester.
Neonatal outcomes, including rates of preterm birth (defined
as gestational age <37 weeks), SGA, low birth weight
(defined as birth weight <2500 g), large for gestational age,
admission rates to the neonatal intensive care unit during the
delivery hospitalization, and congenital abnormalities were
compared in pregnancies with and without syncope, overall,
and by timing and frequency of syncope episodes. Maternal
outcomes of interest included the presentation of 1-year
postpregnancy syncope and cardiovascular events in the
mothers.
Statistical Analysis
The unit of analysis was the pregnancy, so women with >1
pregnancy within the study time period were included multiple
times. Pregnancies were first categorized into 2 groups
according to the presence or absence of syncope and then
further categorized as follows: (1) into 4 groups according to
the timing of the first syncope episode during pregnancy as
none, first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester;
and (2) into 3 groups based on the number of syncope
episodes during the pregnancy as none, 1, and >1 episode.
All categorical variables are described as percentages and
were compared across groups using chi-square tests. Con-
tinuous variables are presented as medians with interquartile
range and were compared between groups using a nonpara-
metric Mann–Whitney U test. We calculated incidence rates of
syncope during pregnancy per 1000 pregnancies for each
year of the study period. A Poisson regression model, with
year and maternal age as covariates, was used to assess
whether incidence rates had changed over time.
The unit of analysis for neonatal and congenital anomaly
outcomes was the child. The number of children included in
the study was larger than the number of pregnancies as a
result of nonsingleton pregnancies (ie, twins, triplets, etc).
Children were categorized according to whether they were
born to pregnancies of mothers with syncopal episodes, as
described above. All hospitalization (Discharge Abstract
Database), ambulatory (National Ambulatory Care Reporting
System), and practitioner claims records from birth to March
31, 2014, were examined to identify children with congenital
anomalies.
Because of the longitudinal nature of the pregnancy-birth
cohort, women may have had multiple pregnancies during the
study time period or may have had multiple births for the
same pregnancy. To account for correlations across pregnan-
cies, we conducted supplementary analyses using generalized
estimating equation models with binomial distribution and
logit function to examine the association between syncope
during pregnancy and neonatal and congenital anomaly
outcomes in the offspring (Data S1).
Finally, hospitalization (Discharge Abstract Database),
ambulatory (National Ambulatory Care Reporting System),
and practitioner claims records in the year after delivery were
used to examine 1-year postpartum rates of syncope and
other cardiovascular conditions (see Table S1 for full list of
codes).
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software
(Version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, there
were 496 159 live births in Alberta, Canada. After excluding
births of women who were not residents of Alberta (n=5747)
and births with incorrect or incomplete data (n=351), the final
study population consisted of 490 061 live births of 481 930
pregnancies (Figure S1).
Overall, 4667 of the 481 930 pregnancies had an episode
of syncope for an overall incidence rate of 9.7 per 1000
pregnancies (95% CI, 9.4–10.0 per 1000 pregnancies). The
incidence rate of syncope during pregnancy increased from
7.6 per 1000 pregnancies in 2005 to 11 per 1000 pregnan-
cies in 2014 (Figure 1), equivalent to an age-adjusted 5%
increase per year (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04–1.06;
P<0.01).

with syncope during pregnancy, there was no difference in the
rates of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy between the
2 groups (Table 3).
When grouped by timing of first episode of syncope, we
found that in 32.2% (1506) of pregnancies the first episode of
syncope occurred in the first trimester, in 44.1% (2058) it
occurred in the second trimester, and in 23.6% (1103) it

 occurred in the third trimester. Overall, 8% (377/4667) of
pregnancies with syncope had >1 episode.
Women experiencing a syncope episode had a higher rate
of preterm birth compared with women with no syncope
episode (16.3% versus 15.0%; P=0.02; Table 3). The rates of
preterm birth differed significantly by the time of the first
syncope episode: women who experienced syncope during
the first trimester had the highest rates of preterm birth
(18.3%) compared with those with syncope during the second
(15.8%) and third (14.2%) trimesters (P<0.01) (Figure 2).
Although higher than the rate of preterm birth in pregnancies
without syncope, there was no difference in preterm birth
rates among pregnancies with 1 versus >1 episode of
syncope.
With respect to neonatal outcomes, the slightly higher rates
of SGA and low birth weight in children of pregnancies with
syncope (10.5% and 7.5%, respectively) than in children of
pregnancies without syncope (9.7% and 6.8%, respectively) was
largely attributed to higher rates of these outcomes in
pregnancies with syncope in the first and second trimesters
(Table 2). Multiple episodes of syncope during pregnancy was
not associated with higher rates of adverse neonatal outcomes.
Looking beyond the neonatal period, over a median follow-
up period of 4.6 years (95% CI, 2.7–7.1 years) for children of
pregnancies with syncope and 5.1 years (95% CI, 2.9–
7.5 years) for children of pregnancies without syncope, the
rates of presentation of congenital anomalies was higher in the
former group (3.1%) than in the latter group (2.6%; P=0.023;
Table 2). The highest prevalence of congenital anomalies was
observed among children of pregnancies in which the first
episode of syncope occurred during the first trimester (3.4%)
(Table 2). The incidence of congenital anomalies was signif-
icantly higher in children of pregnancies with multiple syncope
episodes during pregnancy than children of pregnancies with
only one episode (4.9% versus 2.9%; P<0.01).
Overall, 130 317 women had >1 pregnancy or birth during
the study time period. Results of generalized estimating
equation
modeling
accounting for
correlations
between
outcomes of mothers with multiple pregnancies/births are
presented in Figure S2. These analyses, adjusted for maternal
age, confirmed that women who experience the first syncope
episode during the first trimester had higher odds of preterm
birth (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1, 1.4; P=0.001), SGA (odds
ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0, 1.4; P=0.04), and congenital anomalies
(odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0, 1.8; P=0.036) compared with
women with no syncope during pregnancy. The odds of
congenital anomalies were significantly higher in children of
pregnant women with multiple syncope episodes during
pregnancy than children of those with no syncope during
pregnancy (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3, 3.2; P=0.003).
Women with syncopal episodes during pregnancy had
higher rates of cardiac arrhythmias (0.8%) and syncope
episodes (1.4%) within 1 year following delivery compared
with women with pregnancies without syncope (0.2% for
cardiac arrhythmias and 0.2% for syncope; P<0.01 for both;

Discussion
In a population-based study of 481 930 pregnancies between
2005 and 2014, we found the incidence of syncope during
pregnancy to be �1.0% or 10 per 1000 pregnancies. The
incidence of syncope during pregnancy appears to be
increasing over time by 5% each year. The timing of syncope
during pregnancy may offer some prognostic information, as
rates of preterm birth were higher in pregnancies in which the
first episode of syncope occurred during the first trimester.
Although >1 syncope episode during pregnancy did not appear
to be associated with a higher rate of adverse neonatal
outcomes relative to pregnancies with only 1 syncopal episode,
the 5-year incidence of congenital anomalies was significantly
higher in the former group. Women with syncopal episodes

Syncope in Pregnancy

 during pregnancy had higher rates of cardiac arrhythmias and
syncope in the year after delivery compared with women with no
syncope during pregnancy.
Our study is the first to provide data on the population-level
incidence of syncope during pregnancy. The only other estimate
(published only in abstract form) is from a cross-sectional
survey of 174 postpartum women in which 4.6% self-report
experiencing syncope during pregnancy.7 However, no infor-
mation about the cohort that was surveyed is available. In our
population-based analysis, we found the incidence of syncope
during pregnancy to be �1.0% or 10 per 1000 pregnancies. In
7814 participants from the general population enrolled in the
Framingham study, Soteriades et al19 found 822 patient-
reported cases of syncope over a 17-year follow-up period,
for an age-adjusted incidence of first syncope of 7.2 per 1000
person-years. In this study, the incidence of syncope among
women aged 20 to 59 years ranged from 3.2 to 4.7 per
1000 person-years. More recently, Sandhu et al20 reported an
age-sex standardized hospitalization rate (for a primary diag-
nosis of syncope) of 0.54 per 1000 population. Our findings
suggest that the incidence of syncope during pregnancy may be
slightly higher than in the general population. The increased
rate of syncope in pregnancy may be attributable to physiolog-
ical changes occurring during pregnancy, but may also in part be
attributable to pregnant women being more likely to seek
medical attention for syncope during pregnancy.
We found a significant increase in the incidence of syncope
during pregnancy over time. This finding is consistent with
that reported in the general population. Ruwald et al4 found
that the incidence rate of syncope increased from 13.8 to
19.4 per 100 person-years over a 12-year study period from
1997 to 2009. The highest rates of syncope in the general
population are observed among young (<30 years) and older
(>65 years)
individuals.2
Although
mean
maternal
age
increased slightly over time (by 0.21 years per year in women
with syncope during pregnancy and 0.13 years per year in
women without syncope during pregnancy), there was no
significant increase in the comorbidity burden over time in our
cohort of relatively young pregnant women (data not shown).
During pregnancy, the maternal circulation undergoes
hemodynamic, electrical, and structural changes.5 These
include reduced systemic vascular resistance attributable to a
vasodilatory state, increased blood volume and heart rate, and
eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. These changes may
contribute to an exaggerated vasovagal response during
pregnancy.6 Other possible mechanisms include stimulation
of the nerve plexus located behind the uterus, causing reflex-
mediated tachycardia followed by bradycardia, or compression
of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus, causing reduced
venous return to the heart.21 More detailed clinical data are
needed to identify potential causes for the observed increase in
syncope during pregnancy in our study.
In the only case report to document adverse fetal outcome,
maternal vasovagal syncope was associated with severe
prenatal encephalopathy.22 Our data suggest that syncope
during pregnancy may not be a benign occurrence, as it was
found that syncope during the first trimester of pregnancy
was associated with higher rates of preterm birth, SGA, and
low birth weight. The exact mechanisms explaining the
association between syncope during the early stages of
pregnancy and adverse neonatal outcomes remain unclear. It
is known, however, that a hypoxic maternal environment may
be detrimental to placental development as well as fetal
growth and may lead to potential consequences, including
intrauterine fetal growth restriction, premature delivery, and
preeclampsia.23 Our findings of the long-term consequences
of syncope during pregnancy, including the higher incidence
of congenital anomalies among children of pregnancies with
multiple syncope episodes as well as the higher maternal
rates of cardiac arrhythmias in the year following delivery in
women with syncope during pregnancy, require further study
and confirmation in other independent cohorts.
Although our study provides novel real-world data on the
incidence of syncope during pregnancy in a large population-
based cohort with universal health, it has a few limitations.
Our study may underestimate the true incidence of syncope,
as it does not account for women with symptoms of syncope
who may not have sought medical attention. Our diagnosis of
syncope was based on algorithms using ICD codes with
moderate sensitivity in administrative data sets,12,13 and the
true incidence of syncope may thus have been underesti-
mated. Additionally, pregnancies that resulted in stillbirths or
miscarriages were not included in our database, thus leading
to potential further underestimation of the true incidence and
adverse neonatal outcomes of syncope in pregnancy.
Conclusions
In a large, contemporary, population-based cohort, we found
that the incidence of syncope during pregnancy is �1.0%, and
is increasing over time. Pregnancies with syncope, especially
when it occurs during the first trimester, may be associated
with higher rates of adverse outcomes, including higher rates
of preterm births and congenital anomalies and increased
incidence of maternal cardiac arrhythmia and syncope
postpartum. Whether women who experience syncope during
pregnancy may benefit from closer monitoring during the
obstetric and postpartum periods requires further study.

 Data S1. 
 
Supplemental Analysis 
 
Due to the longitudinal nature of the pregnancy-birth cohort, there were 130,317 women who had more 
than one pregnancy during the study time period.  In addition, there were 8161 pregnancies that 
resulted in multiple births and 55 women had more than one multiple birth pregnancy in our study.   
 
To account for correlations across pregnancies, we conducted supplementary analyses using 
generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with binomial distribution and logit function to examine 
the association between syncope during pregnancy and neonatal and congenital anomaly outcomes in 
the offspring.  
 
The GEE model accounts for multiple pregnancies from the same mother.  However, a pregnancy that 
resulted in multiple births is counted only once.  In the latter case, if any of the neonates born from the 
multiple pregnancy (i.e. twins, triplets) developed the outcome of interest, that pregnancy was 
considered to have the outcome. 
 
For each outcome of interest three separate GEE models, including maternal age at delivery as a 
covariate in the model, were executed: model 1 compared no syncope vs. syncope; model 2 compared 
no syncope vs. syncope during first, second and third trimester and model 3 compared no syncope vs.1 
syncope episode and >1 syncope episode. Results are presented in Figure S2.
