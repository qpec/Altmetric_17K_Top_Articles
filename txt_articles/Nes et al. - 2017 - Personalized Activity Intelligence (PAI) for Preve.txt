Abstract 
Purpose: To derive and validate a single metric of activity tracking that associates with lower 
risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. 
Methods: We derived an algorithm, Personalized Activity Intelligence (PAI), using the HUNT 
Fitness Study (n=4631), and validated it in the general HUNT population (n=39,298) aged 
20–74 years. The PAI was divided into three sex-specific groups (≤50, 51–99 and ≥100), and 
the inactive group (0 PAI) was used as the referent. Hazard ratios for all-cause and 
cardiovascular disease mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regressions. 
Results: After >1 million person-years of observations during a mean follow-up time of 26.2 
(SD, 5.9) years, there were 10,062 deaths, including 3867 deaths (2207 men and 1660 
women) from cardiovascular disease. Men and women with a PAI-level ≥100 had 17% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 7–27%), and 23% (95% CI, 4–38%) reduced risk of cardiovascular 
disease mortality compared to the inactive groups, respectively. Obtaining ≥100 PAI was 
associated with significantly lower risk for cardiovascular disease mortality in all pre-
specified age-groups, and in participants with known cardiovascular disease risk factors (all 
P-trends <0.01). Participants who did not obtain ≥100 PAI had increased risk of dying 
regardless of meeting the physical activity recommendations. 
Conclusion: PAI may have a huge potential to motivate people to become and stay physically 
active, as it is an easily understandable and scientifically proven metric that could inform 
potential users of how much physical activity is needed to reduce the risk of premature 
cardiovascular disease death.

Introduction 
Low levels of physical activity have reached pandemic proportions, contributing to >5 million 
deaths each year worldwide.1,2 Inadequate physical activity not only results in increased 
individual health burden,3 but also contributes to tremendous health care expenditures for the 
society.4,5 Therefore, promotion of physical activity is needed throughout the healthcare 
system.6,7 
Current recommendations of physical activity suggest that adults should engage in at least 150 
minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity per week, 
or any combination of activity that approximates the same total energy expenditure.8-10 Recent 
studies have also shown significant benefits at activity levels as low as half of the 
recommended quantity.11,12  
Evolving evidence suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness outperforms physical activity as a 
predictor of future health.13-15 Moreover, several studies suggest that people with established 
cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as high body mass index (BMI), hypertension or 
diabetes, but with high cardiorespiratory fitness, have highly attenuated risk of cardiovascular 
disease and premature mortality.13,14,16 
A major challenge in activity counseling and promotion of physical activity is to provide clear 
feedback to individuals with personalized and meaningful information that motivate 
individuals to increase or sustain physical activity.17,18 Goals such as ‘10,000 steps per day’ or 
’30-minutes of activity per day’ tend to be vague and misleading, as they do not reflect the 
body’s response to each activity. The most personalized, accurate way to track and measure 
the body’s response to activity is through monitoring a person’s heart rate.9 Unlike all other 
physical activity metrics, such as distance walked, number of steps, frequency or duration of 
activity, heart rate changes reflect the body’s response to physical activity regardless of the 
type of activity performed. However, there has never been a simple way to convert heart rate

changes during physical activity into a meaningful metric for understanding how much 
activity or exercise is necessary, and what intensity level is needed to achieve optimal health 
results.  
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a new single metric (Personalized 
Activity Intelligence, PAI) that can be integrated in self-assessment heart rate devices, and 
defines a weekly beneficial heart rate pattern during physical activity. Further, we aimed to 
assess whether PAI could translate into reduced long-term risk of premature cardiovascular 
disease and all-cause mortality.

Methods 
Derivation cohort 
The derivation cohort to develop PAI-algorithm consisted of participants in the HUNT Fitness 
Study (2006-08).19,20 In total, 4631 healthy subjects completed an individualized peak oxygen 
uptake (VO2peak) test running on a treadmill.19  
Clinical examinations 
VO2peak was measured by ergospirometry (MetaMax II; Cortex Biophysik GmbH, Leipzig, 
Germany). Maximal heart rate was defined as the highest heart rate obtained during peak 
exercise. Details about the test procedures are presented elsewhere.19 Trained nurses 
conducted other clinical examinations of standardized measurements of height, weight, blood 
pressure, and resting heart rate. 
Personalized Activity Intelligence (PAI) 
The purpose of the model design was to develop a generic algorithm suitable for real-time 
implementation on a device connected to, or integrated with, a continuous heart rate sensor. 
Previous studies on the same derivation cohort showed that a non-exercise model could be 
used to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness for individuals.21-23 The fundamental basis of PAI is 
to exchange the self-reported exercise level (intensity, duration and frequency) from these 
studies21-24 with measured heart rate. Further details of mathematical modeling to derive PAI 
are presented in the supplementary material.  
Validation cohort 
The validation cohort consisted of 70,535 participants aged 20-74 years in the first wave of 
HUNT (1984-86). After making multiple exclusions (see supplementary materials), a total of 
39,298 (20,029 women and 19,269 men) were included in the analyses of this study (sFigure 
1). We compared the 39,298 participants who were included with the 31,237 participants who 
 MANUSCRIPT

6 
 
were excluded. As expected, the excluded participants were older and had worse 
cardiovascular risk profiles than those who were included in the study (sTable 1). 
Questionnaire based information 
For validation cohort, information on exercise habits were collected through a questionnaire 
containing questions about frequency, duration and intensity of physical activity over a 
normal week. Numbers of exercise sessions were multiplied with the median duration to 
obtain an estimate of total time spent on exercise per week. Intensity of exercise stated as 
“How hard do you exercise?” contained three response options (“no sweat or heavy breath”, 
“heavy breath and some sweat” and “push myself to exhaustion”). Based on previous 
studies12,23,25,26 from our group using the HUNT Fitness population, these relative intensities 
corresponds to 44%, 73% and 83% of heart rate reserve (maximal heart rate – resting heart 
rate), respectively, which was used in the analysis. Questionnaire data were also collected for 
smoking status (smoker, non-smoker), education (total years of education), alcohol 
consumption (number of alcoholic drinks over two weeks), and a wide range of present 
diseases. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome of the validation study was death from cardiovascular disease (ICD9, 
390–459, ICD10, I00–99), and secondary outcome was death from all-causes. Data was 
linked to the National cause of death registry through the 11–digit Norwegian personal 
identification number allowing for virtually complete follow-up. All participants provided a 
written informed consent, and the study was approved by the regional committee for medical 
research ethics.

Statistical analyses 
PAI over one week was calculated for each participant in validation cohort on the basis of the 
algorithm provided from the derivation cohort. PAI was divided into three groups (≤50, 51–99 
and ≥100 PAI), and the inactive group (0 PAI) was used as the reference category. Person-
years were calculated from attendance date in HUNT-1 until date of death or end of follow-up 
31st December 2013, whichever came first. Rate of death for each PAI category was 
calculated per 1000 person-years. We then assessed hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) for death associated with PAI categories by Cox proportional hazard regression 
models. The age-adjusted models included attained age as the time scale while the multi-
adjusted models further included smoking, BMI, hypertension, alcohol consumption and 
education. We found no evidence for violation of the proportional hazards assumption 
examined by Schoenfeld residuals. In secondary analysis, we stratified participants by age-
group at baseline (<40, 40-55, or >55 years) and presence of overweight/obesity (BMI ≥25 
kg.m-2), smoking status, and hypertension (blood pressure≥140/90 mmHg and/or anti-
hypertensive medications). 
We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings by excluding the 
first 3 years of follow-up. In another analysis, we categorized the PAI into 2 groups, <100 and 
≥100, and  divided participants according to physical activity recommendations from AHA10, 
and assessed the isolated and combined associations of the PAI and physical activity 
recommendations after controlling for various confounders. In a separate analysis, we 
calculated years of life lost as a difference between the adjusted median life expectancy for 
PAI groups,27 where survival probabilities at each age for each individual were calculated, 
and then averaged to obtain an overall summary curve. All statistical tests were two sided and 
considered significant at a P<.05. All analyses were conducted using Stata (version 13.1 
StataCorp).

Results 
The distribution of clinical and demographic characteristics of participants in the validation 
cohort is presented in Table 1. Participants with ≥100 PAI corresponding to 40 minutes of 
high intensity (~85 % heart rate reserve) or 60 minutes of moderate intensity activity (~75 % 
heart rate reserve) in a week (26.6% men and 14.9% women) appeared to have a healthier 
lifestyle: lower prevalence of hypertension and smoking, and weighed less compared with 
other participants.  
After 1,029,684 person-years of observations during a mean follow-up of 26.2 (SD, 5.9) years 
in the validation cohort, there were 10,062 deaths, including 3867 deaths (2207 men and 1660 
women) from cardiovascular disease.  
In general, men and women with a PAI-level ≥100 had 17% (7–27%) and 23% (4–38%) 
reduced risk of cardiovascular disease mortality compared to the inactive groups, respectively 
(Table 2). The corresponding risk reduction for all-cause mortality was 13% (6–20%) and 
17% (6–26%) for men and women, respectively. No further risk reductions or loss of benefit 
were observed beyond obtaining a weekly 100 PAI (data not shown). 
Subgroup analyses 
Obtaining ≥100 PAI was associated with significantly lower risk for cardiovascular disease 
mortality compared to inactive groups in all pre-specified age-groups for men [<40 years; 
0.59 (0.38–0.92), 40–55 years; 0.62 (0.48–0.79); >55 years; 0.80 (0.69–0.93)] and women 
[40–55 years; 0.35 (0.19–0.65) and >55 years; 0.70 (0.55–0.89)] (Figure 1).  
Participants with presence of known cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as smoking, 
hypertension or overweight/obese, showed similar risk reductions by obtaining ≥100 PAI 
compared to the inactive groups (Figure 2). For example, men and women smokers with ≥100 
PAI had 21% (4–35%) and 42% (10–63%) lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality 
compared to the inactive group; while the corresponding risk reductions were 26% (14–35%)

and 37% (18–51%) in hypertensive men and women, and 22% (8–33%) and 39% (18–55%) 
in overweight/obese men and women, respectively. Similar patterns were observed for all-
cause mortality (Figure 2). The results of the analyses stratified by hypertension or diabetes 
status at baseline were not substantially different from the main analyses, where ≥100 PAI 
was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality (sTable 3).  
In a separate analysis, we assessed the hazard ratio for the combination of PAI and physical 
activity recommendations. Compared to the reference group of ≥100 PAI and meeting the 
recommendations, participants with ≥100 PAI and below the recommendations did not have a 
significantly increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease: 1.07 (0.87–1.31) (Table 3). 
The corresponding hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.06 (0.94–1.19). In participants 
who met the physical activity recommendations but had <100 PAI, the hazard ratio was 1.27 
(1.09–1.48) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 1.13 (1.02–1.24) for all-cause mortality. 
The multi-adjusted sensitivity analyses of PAI and physical activity showed that physical 
activity was clearly not significant (χ2 = 0.79, P > χ2 = 0.37 for all-cause, and χ2 = 0.01, P > χ2 
= 0.98 for cardiovascular disease mortality, sTable 4). The results were not substantially 
altered when we excluded the first 3 years of follow-up (sTable 5). 
We observed that <100 PAI was associated with an average 4.7 (4.4–5.0) years of life lost 
compared with participants obtaining ≥100 PAI. As shown in sFigure 2, these estimates were 
3.9 (3.6–4.2) years in women, and 6.0 (5.7–6.3) years in men. Also, the difference was more 
pronounced in middle age participants. For instance, ~7 years of life were lost in men aged 
56-60 years with PAI below 100.

Discussion 
We derived and validated a new personalized metric for physical activity tracking using large-
scale data of a healthy Norwegian population, including approximately 1 million person-years 
of observations over more than 26 years. The main finding of the study was that obtaining 
≥100 PAI significantly reduced the risk of dying prematurely from all causes and from 
cardiovascular disease among men and women, and in different disease subgroups. Of 
particular interest was the observation that obtaining a 100 PAI weekly gave similar reduction 
in risk of dying prematurely regardless of whether or not the current recommendation for 
physical activity was met, demonstrating that PAI may be a more relevant metric than current 
worldwide physical activity recommendations for determining whether an individual’s 
activity level is sufficient to achieve substantial health benefits.8,10 
The application and utility of PAI could be twofold: 1) prevention of premature 
cardiovascular disease and 2) promotion of physical activity. With advances in technology, 
which include multiple wearable devices and web-based applications, it is now much easier to 
self-monitor physical activity than it was a decade ago. In PAI, one could use an algorithm 
integrated into a health app or wearable device that measures heart rate continuously, and 
potentially made available to the general public world-wide, allowing individuals across the 
world to track their activity levels using a single, easily understandable metric. Not only could 
this allow individuals to determine if they are performing sufficient physical activity to 
achieve better health and longevity, but the use of PAI and readily available feedback could 
also motivate individuals to increase the quantity and/or intensity of their physical activity. 
Possibly, this practice could translate into prevention of premature cardiovascular disease and 
all-cause mortality. 
The finding that it is not necessary to exercise daily to obtain substantial health benefits, as 
long as one obtains 100 PAI weekly, is of particular interest, and in line with previous studies

reporting that fewer sessions, if performed at higher intensities, provide similar or larger 
health benefits compared to frequent, low intensity activity of longer duration12,28-30. 
Although, we acknowledge the concern that high-intensity activity may be less achievable for 
previously inactive people, highlighting the benefits of shorter bouts of higher intensity are 
important as lack of time for physical activity/exercise is the predominant reason for the 
majority of people not to be physically active on most days of the week31,32, making it 
difficult to fulfill current physical activity recommendations. The algorithm also incorporates 
the fact that the major reduction in mortality occurs between the least active and the less 
active people, and it is easier to earn the first 50 vs. the next 50 PAIs. The key is to 
accumulate adequate active time above the relative heart rate threshold in order to earn PAI, 
and higher the intensity the shorter the time needed to obtain 100 PAI. So far, this issue has 
been difficult to incorporate and promote through self-measurement devices that focus 
predominantly on number of steps or accumulated time in motion. In terms of risk, no further 
reductions in cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality were observed for scores 
progressively higher than 100 PAI.  
Strengths and limitations 
The main strengths of present study include a large population-based cohort of healthy men 
and women, the long term and virtually complete follow-up, and information on various 
confounding factors. A limitation of the study is that physical activity data in the validation 
cohort was obtained only at one time-point, which is inherently prone to classification bias. 
However, in prospective studies, the nature of the misclassification is most likely non-
differential in relation to future disease, and therefore likely to yield underestimates of the true 
effects. The HUNT study population is ethnically homogenous, predominantly Caucasian, and 
have a better baseline health profile than many other large populations. However, similar 
effect of physical activity on risk reduction has been demonstrated in the HUNT 
 MANUSCRIPT

population12,30 and studies from around the world9,11,28,29. Also, as heart rate (resting and 
maximal) seems to be consistent throughout the globe strengthen the chances for that PAI is 
universal across ethnicities. Nonetheless, the generalizability of the PAI algorithm in 
ethnically diverse populations with varying cardiovascular disease risk warrants investigation. 
Despite the large number of study participants, the number of deaths in certain subgroups was 
low, specifically age group <40 years in women. As a result, the corresponding effect 
estimates were not precise, and therefore, one should be careful in drawing firm conclusions 
related to these subgroups. We recognize that people could have changed their activity status, 
and hence PAI, during the follow-up time. However, this may be a potential strength of our 
validation study, stressing that a single measure of PAI at baseline is associated with long-
term cardiovascular disease mortality.  
Future perspectives 
The major strength of the PAI algorithm lies in its applicability when incorporated in self-
monitoring devices that allows for continuous measurement of heart rate. Future studies are 
warranted to validate the algorithm against continuous heart rate measurements, and 
ultimately in long term randomized trials to evaluate the effect on cardiorespiratory fitness, 
cardiovascular risk and adherence to physical activity in diverse populations. 
Conclusion 
PAI is associated with long-term cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality and could be 
incorporated in self-measurement instruments to provide an opportunity for promotion of 
physical activity, as it offers individuals a variety of options and choices relating to the 
quantity, quality or intensity of physical activity to achieve maximum health benefits. The use 
of PAI could help clinicians, healthy lifestyle industry, and worksite wellness initiatives 
worldwide in efforts to increase effective physical activity goals across the globe.

Clinical significance 
• Personalized Activity Intelligence (PAI), an easily understandable metric of physical 
activity is associated with reduced risk of dying prematurely from all-causes and from 
cardiovascular disease. 
• Obtaining 100 PAI over a week gave similar reduction in risk of dying regardless of 
meeting the current recommendation for physical activity or not. 
• PAI could be incorporated in self-assessment heart rate devices to self-monitor the 
activity levels needed to achieve maximum health benefits.
