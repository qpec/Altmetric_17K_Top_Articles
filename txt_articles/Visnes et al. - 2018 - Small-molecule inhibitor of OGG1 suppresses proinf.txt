One Sentence Summary: 
We developed an OGG1 inhibitor which decreases lung inflammation by a mechanism distinct from other 
anti-inflammatory drugs. 
 
Abstract 
The onset of inflammation is associated with reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage to 
macromolecules such as 8-oxoG in DNA. The OGG1 glycosylase binds 8-oxoG, and since the Ogg1−/− 
mice are resistant to acute and systemic inflammation, we hypothesized that OGG1 inhibition may 
represent a novel strategy to prevent and treat inflammation. We developed TH5487, a selective active site 
inhibitor of OGG1 that hampers OGG1 binding to and repair of 8-oxoG and is well tolerated by mice. 
TH5487 prevents TNF�-induced OGG1–DNA interactions at guanine-rich promoters of pro-inflammatory 
genes. This, in turn, decreases DNA occupancy of NF-�B and pro-inflammatory gene expression, 
resulting in decreased inflammatory cell recruitment to mouse lungs. Thus, we show in vivo proof-of-
concept of targeting oxidative DNA repair to alleviate inflammatory conditions.

Main Text: 
 
Upon exposure to pro-inflammatory agents, cells produce elevated levels of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), which induce oxidative DNA damage. Guanine is particularly vulnerable because 
it has the lowest oxidation potential among canonical DNA bases (1, 2), resulting primarily in 
7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) particularly at guanine-rich promoter regions (3, 4). 8-
oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) binds with high affinity to 8-oxoG in double-stranded 
DNA to initiate DNA base excision repair. In addition to this role, OGG1 has distinct signal 
transduction functions (5–7), interacts with 8-oxoG in gene regulatory regions, and facilitates 
gene expression (3, 7–12). These observations provide a potential explanation for the decreased 
inflammatory responses in Ogg1−/− mice (13–16), which are otherwise viable and largely healthy 
(17). Thus, we hypothesized that small molecule OGG1 inhibitors may be clinically useful for the 
alleviation of inflammatory processes while still being well tolerated.  
 
To screen for OGG1 inhibitors, we used a duplex oligonucleotide with the OGG1 
substrate 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyadenosine and an excess of AP endonuclease 1 (APE1), 
which acts downstream of OGG1 and stimulates its activity (18) (Fig. 1A and 1B). We screened a 
compound library containing 17,940 compounds (Table S1), and identified a hit molecule with an 
IC50 of 8.6 µM. During hit expansion, we developed TH5487 as a potent OGG1 inhibitor with an 
IC50 of 342 nM, whereas structurally similar analogues TH2840 and TH5411 were inactive with 
IC50 values exceeding 100 µM (Fig. 1C, 1D, S1, S2 and S3). This compound series was selective 
for OGG1 and did not affect the activity of other DNA glycosylases (Fig. S5A and Table S2), 
various Nudix hydrolases/diphosphatases (Table S3), and did not intercalate DNA (Fig. S5B). 
Previously, a hydrazide-based small molecule (O8) was reported to inhibit OGG1 with similar 
potency as TH5487 (19). O8 was found to inhibit catalytic imine formation in OGG1 (19), and 
we observed an increase in the potency of O8 by omitting APE1 from the reaction, in contrast to 
 4 
 
TH5487 (Table S4). APE1 readily released fluorescence from a natural AP-site, but only partially 
from an AP-site substrate pre-incubated with O8 (Fig. S5C). Thus, TH5487 primarily inhibited 
the DNA glycosylase activity of OGG1, whereas O8 appeared to interfere with downstream 
�-lyase activity. To further validate OGG1 inhibition by TH5487, we performed electrophoretic 
mobility shift assays (EMSAs). OGG1 bound to 8-oxoG:C-containing duplex oligonucleotide in 
a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. S4C).  The amount of OGG1–DNA complexes 
decreased in a dose-dependent manner upon addition of TH5487 (Fig. 1E), demonstrating that 
TH5487 precludes OGG1 from binding oxidized DNA in vitro. 
TH5487, but not the inactive analogs TH2840 and TH5411, increased the melting 
temperature for OGG1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1F). Thus, TH5487-mediated 
protein destabilization did not account for the observed decrease in enzyme activity, suggesting 
that TH5487 binds OGG1 similarly to 8-oxoG extruded from DNA.  Supporting this, treatment 
with TH5487 resulted in a lower deuteration for all peptides forming the active site cavity (Fig. 
1G and Table S5). Thus, TH5487 is a potent and selective active site inhibitor that prevents 
OGG1 from recognizing its DNA substrate.  
To identify the precise binding site for this class of inhibitors, we determined X-ray 
crystal structures of mouse OGG1 in complex with the more soluble analog TH5675 (Fig. 1H, S4 
and S6A-C, Table S6). TH5675 bound the active site (Fig S6D), albeit differently from the 
natural substrate (Fig S6E). Notably, the iodophenyl tail of TH5675 occupied the deeper 
hydrophobic pocket flanked by Phe319, Cys253, and Met257 and took the place of the 
8-oxoguanine base. The central piperidyl linker was stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the 
catalytic Lys249 and the backbone of Gly42, the residue that distinguishes 8-oxoguanine from 
guanine. The benzimidazolone core interacted with a lipophilic exo-site, stabilized by Ile152 and 
Leu323 in addition to a �-stacking interaction with His270 (20). Notably, the Asp322 side chain 
 5 
 
was within hydrogen bond distance of the solvent accessible amine, which corresponds to the 
bromine atom in TH5487 (Fig. S6F). These interactions were the result of a local conformational 
change where the active site closed around the ligand (Fig. S6G, Movie S1).  
For OGG1 inhibitors to be pharmacologically useful, they need to engage and inhibit 
OGG1 in cells. TH5487 increased the melting temperature of OGG1 in human cells (Fig. 2A), 
demonstrating that TH5487 engaged its intended target in living cells and protected it from 
thermal denaturation. Furthermore, TH5487 impaired repair of genomic 8-oxoG induced by 
KBrO3. TH5487 caused a significant increase in genomic 8-oxoG after 2.5 h (Fig. 2B and 2C) 
and at 24 h, 50% ± 8% of the 8-oxoG remained in the TH5487-treated cells (Fig. 2C), without 
disrupting proliferation (Fig S7A). Thus, genomic 8-oxoG and TH5487 were well tolerated by 
cells. Furthermore, the decrease in genomic 8-oxoG was a result of repair processes and not 
cellular replication. To further validate target engagement, we assessed the chromatin dynamics 
of OGG1–GFP fusion proteins. Cells were treated with KBrO3 and released into medium 
containing TH5487 or DMSO. Consistent with previous reports (21), OGG1–GFP fusion proteins 
were immobilized at genomic DNA lesions introduced by KBrO3. Treatment with TH5487 
increased the nuclear mobility of OGG1–GFP 3- and 5-h after KBrO3 exposure (Fig. 2D-E, S7B-
C), suggesting that TH5487 prevented OGG1 binding to its genomic substrate in living cells. 
OGG1 binds 8-oxoG at gene regulatory regions to mediate transcriptional activation in 
response to inflammatory stimuli (3, 7–11). In the absence of functional OGG1, a decreased 
inflammatory response is observed (3, 12–16, 22). Because TH5487 prevents OGG1 from 
binding 8-oxoG in DNA, we examined if TH5487 could suppress pro-inflammatory gene 
expression. In line with previous observations (12), HEK293T cells lacking OGG1 displayed a 
reduced induction of CXCL1 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1) mRNA following tumor 
necrosis factor  (TNF�) stimulation (Fig. 2F, S7D and S7E). Treatment with 5 µM TH5487 
 6 
 
decreased CXCL1 expression by > 50% in wild-type but not in OGG1-knockout cells (Fig. 2F). 
Thus, the compound may be used to specifically inhibit OGG1-dependent pro-inflammatory gene 
expression. Since respiratory epithelium is a key orchestrator of pulmonary innate immune 
responses (23), we stimulated a murine airway epithelial cell line (MLE 12) with TNF� (24), 
which increased the expression of an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines, C-C, and C-X-C 
chemokines (Fig. 3A-C and S8). Importantly, TH5487 decreased expression of the same genes to 
near pre-treatment levels (Fig. 3C, 3E, S8, S9, S10, S11 and S12). Inhibition was dose-dependent 
(Fig. 3D and S10) and observed also with the potent inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) (25) (Fig. 3F, S11 and S12). Crucially, TH5487 decreased TNF�- and LPS-induced gene 
expression also in diploid human airway epithelial cells (hSAECs; Fig. 3G-I, S9, S10 and S12).  
ROS generate a localized increase in OGG1 substrates in guanine-rich promoter regions 
(4, 6, 9, 10) including pro-inflammatory genes (3, 4, 12). Emerging evidence suggests that OGG1 
binding to gene regulatory regions exerts an epigenetic role for 8-oxoG causing OGG1 to act as a 
modulator of gene expression (3, 4, 6–11). Guanine oxidation leads to sequential recruitment of 
OGG1 and downstream transcriptional effectors (3, 8–11), such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-
�B), which is the main driver of both TNF�- and LPS-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression 
(26). Consistent with the observation that TH5487 prevents OGG1 from engaging damaged DNA 
in vitro and in cells (Fig. 1E, 2D and 2E), we observed that TH5487 decreased the recruitment of 
OGG1 to regulatory regions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in TNF�-challenged cells (Fig. 3J). 
Consequently, binding of NF-�B to the same regulatory regions was significantly decreased by 
TH5487 in the chromatin of TNF�-exposed cells (Fig. 3K) and to its recognition sequence in 
nuclear extracts from mouse and human cells by TH5487 (Fig. 3L and S13A-C). In the presence 
of OGG1, TH5487 decreased NF-�B occupancy on 8-oxoG-containing DNA, whereas TH5487 
alone was unable to inhibit NF-�B (Fig. S13D-E). Thus, TH5487 decreases pro-inflammatory 
 7 
 
gene expression by perturbing DNA occupancy of NF-�B and potentially other OGG1-dependent 
transacting factors (3, 8–11). TH5487 had no effect on the release of NF-�B from its inhibitory 
complex (Fig. S14A-C), but inhibited inflammatory gene expression similar to BMS-345541, an 
I�B kinase inhibitor (27) (Fig. S15A). Thus, both TH5847 and BMS-345541 inhibit NF-�B 
function: TH5487 by preventing NF-�B binding to promoters (Fig. 3K), and BMS-345541 by 
inhibiting NF-�B activation (Fig. S14A-C). This results in the same readout in the form of 
diminished induction of pro-inflammatory genes. The previously-developed OGG1 inhibitor O8 
(19) did not affect gene expression (Fig. S15A), possibly because, in contrast to TH5487, it 
allows OGG1 binding to damaged DNA (19) (Fig. S15B-C). 
In addition, TH5487 is metabolically relatively stable and well tolerated in mice (Table 
S7, S8, S9 and S10, Fig. S16A). To assess whether TH5487 could downregulate chemotactic (C-
C and C-X-C) mediators (28) in vivo, we challenged mouse lungs with TNF� and profiled the 
gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. TNF� robustly induced expression of pulmonary 
pro-inflammatory genes, but a prophylactic injection of TH5487 decreased the expression levels 
by twofold or greater (Fig. 4A and 4B). Challenge with TNF� or LPS induced the robust 
recruitment of neutrophils to the airways, which was decreased by up to 85% ± 5% by the 
prophylactic intraperitoneal administration of TH5487 (Fig. 4C and S16B-G). We then 
administered TH5487 at different time points before or after challenge with TNF� and found that 
TH5487 reduced the pulmonary neutrophil count even when administered up to 9 h after TNF� 
challenge (Figure 4D and S17). Thus, TH5487 is efficacious in vivo, suggesting that the 
compound could be used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Finally, during the 
revision stage of this manuscript, another potent and structurally distinct OGG1 inhibitor was 
published (29). Even this compound has comparable anti-inflammatory effects (Fig. S18).

Thus, we have developed a pharmacologically useful OGG1 inhibitor that is a potent and 
selective active site binder that prevents OGG1 from engaging damaged DNA in vitro and in 
cells, resulting in a decreased pro-inflammatory gene expression by a mechanism that is distinct 
from other established therapeutic agents (Fig. S19). This is translated into a reduced neutrophil 
infiltration in mouse lungs challenged with TNF� or LPS, demonstrating that OGG1 inhibition 
may be a potentially useful strategy for the treatment of inflammation.

Fig. 1: Development and validation of OGG1 inhibitors (A) A fluorophore and a quencher on 
opposite strands are separated upon OGG1-mediated excision of 8-oxoA and APE1 incision at 
the resulting apurinic site, causing a local melting of the DNA helix. (B) Excision of 8-oxoA:C, 
but not undamaged substrates by OGG1 in the presence of APE1. Data represent average ± SD of 
three technical replicates, representative of four independent experiments. (C) Chemical 
structures of the OGG1 inhibitors described herein. (D) Inhibition curves: 0.8 nM OGG1 and 2 
nM APE1 were incubated with 10 nM OGG1-substrate and different concentrations of the 
indicated compounds. Data are presented as average of four technical replicates from at least two 
independent experiments (n=2 for TH2840 and TH5411, n=33 for TH5487). (E) TH5487 
precludes binding of OGG1 to damaged DNA. 10 nM of an OGG1 substrate duplex 
oligonucleotide was incubated with 100 nM OGG1 and the indicated concentrations of TH5487. 
This prevented the formation of OGG1–DNA complexes in a dose-dependent manner. The figure 
is representative of three independent experiments. (F) Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF): 
OGG1 was incubated with SYPRO Orange and a dilution series of OGG1 inhibitors. TH5487, 
but not inactive analogues TH2840 and TH5411, confers the thermal stabilization of OGG1. Data 
are average ±SD of three technical replicates and are representative of three independent 
experiments. (G) Differences in deuterium uptake superimposed on an OGG1 model upon

dynamics. (A) Cellular thermal shift assay: Jurkat A3 cells were treated with 10 µM TH5487 and 
OGG1 thermal stability was analyzed by immunoblotting. Addition of 10 µM TH5487 to 
cultured cells increased the melting point of OGG1 by 3°C (n=2 independent experiments). (B) 
Induction of genomic 8-oxoG by KBrO3: duplicate cultures of Jurkat A3 cells were treated for 1 
h with 20 mM KBrO3, and the level of 8-oxoG in genomic DNA determined by LC-MS/MS. 
KBrO3 induced a >10-fold increase in genomic 8-oxoG. Data are presented as average ± SD of 
four replicates from two independent experiments. (C) Repair kinetics of genomic 8-oxoG: Cells 
treated with 20 mM KBrO3 for 1 h were washed and released into medium containing 10 µM 
TH5487 or 0.1% DMSO. Duplicate samples were taken at the indicated time points and genomic 
content of 8-oxoG determined as in C. TH5487 induced a notable delay in repair kinetics at 2.5-, 
5- and 24-h time points. Data are presented as average ± SD of four replicates from two 
independent experiments. (D) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP): Jurkat A3 
cells expressing OGG1–GFP were treated with 16 mM KBrO3, washed, and released into 
medium with 10 µM TH5487 or 0.1% DMSO. A nuclear region was bleached and recovery of 
fluorescence after photobleaching was recorded. Representative false-color images of DMSO- 
and TH5487-treated cells. (E) Quantification of FRAP experiments: 10 µM TH5487 increased 
the nuclear mobility of OGG1-GFP at 3 h and 5 h after KBrO3 treatment. Quantifications of two 
(0 h) or three (3 h and 5 h) independent experiments are shown. (F) TH5487 inhibits TNF�-
induced CXCL1 gene expression in wild-type, but not OGG1 knock out HEK293T cells. Cells 
were treated with 0.05% DMSO or 5 µM TH5487 for 1 h and TNF� (20 ng/ml) for 30 min. 
CXCL1 mRNA levels were determined with qPCR. Data are average�±�SD from three 
independent experiments.  *p�<�0.05, **p�<�0.01, ***p�<�0.001, using unpaired two-sided t-test.

Recombinant Proteins 
The cDNA of human recombinant APE1 cloned into pET14b vector with N-terminal 
His6-tag (a gift from Dr. Jason Parsons) was introduced into Escherichia coli strain 
BL21(DE3)pLysS. The transformed cells were grown in LB medium + 100 µg/ml 
ampicillin at 37°C overnight. LB medium was inoculated with the fresh overnight culture 
and bacteria were grown at 37°C to an A600 nm ≈ 0.8. Then, the temperature was decreased 
to 30°C, APE1 expression was induced by addition of IPTG to 0.5 mM and cultivation 
was continued at 30°C for another 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed 
in BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Millipore) supplemented with complete protease 
inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and Benzonase nuclease (Novagen) for 20 min at room 
temperature (RT). The suspension was centrifuged at 12000 × g for 20 min and the clear 
supernatant was loaded on a Ni–Sepharose column (HisTrap HP, GE Healthcare) 
equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol. 
Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of imidazole (40 mM–500 mM) and 
analyzed by SDS–PAGE. Fractions containing APE1 protein were combined, dialyzed 
against 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, loaded onto an SP cation 
exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 25 mM – 800 mM NaCl gradient in 
25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol. The purity of the final APE1 
fractions was assessed by SDS–PAGE (Fig. S20) and verified by MALDI–TOF mass 
spectrometry analysis. The fractions with purified APE1 were dialyzed against 50 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 20% glycerol and protein concentration was determined 
by the Bradford method using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent and BSA as 
protein standard (Thermo Scientific). Aliquots of purified APE1 proteins were stored at 
−80°C. 
The pNIC28–OGG1 construct expressing human recombinant OGG1 with N-
terminal His6-tag was transformed into Rosetta2pLysS E. coli competent cells. The 
transformed cells were grown in LB medium + 50 µg/ml kanamycin at 37 C overnight. 
Fresh overnight culture was inoculated into LB medium containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin, 
0.8% glycerol, and 0.4% glucose and grown at 37°C to an A600 nm ≈ 0.9 followed by a 
reduction in temperature to 18°C. After 1 h cultivation at 18°C, protein expression was 
induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. Protein expression was continued for 18 h at 18°C. 
Cells were lysed using BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Millipore) with complete 
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), benzonase nuclease (Novagen) and 0.25 mg/ml of 
lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich). After rotation for 20 min at RT, the suspension was 
centrifuged at 12000 × g for 20 min. The clear supernatant of cell lysate was loaded onto 
a Ni–Sepharose column (HisTrap HP, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mM 
potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and 5% glycerol buffer. 
The bound proteins were eluted with 50 mM–500 mM imidazole gradient in 25 mM 
potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol buffer. The protein fractions 
were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Mini-Protean 4%–15% TGX gel (Bio-Rad). The 
fractions with OGG1 protein were dialyzed against 25 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 
50 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol at 4°C overnight. They were then loaded onto a cation-
exchange column (SP HP, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted 
with 50 mM–800 mM NaCl gradient. The purity of OGG1 protein was checked by SDS–
  
 
3 
 
PAGE (Fig. S20) and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method with 
Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent and BSA as protein standard (Thermo Scientific). 
The sample with purified OGG1 protein was dialyzed against 25 mM potassium 
phosphate pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 40% glycerol, aliquoted and stored at −20°C.  
E.coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg, M0240), single-strand selective 
monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1, M0336), and methylpurine-DNA 
glycosylase (MPG, M0313) were purchased from New England Biolabs. ITPase, NEIL1, 
and TDG were purified by the Protein Science Facility at the Karolinska Institute, using 
C- and N-terminal histidine-tags, respectively. A synthetic gene fragment encoding 
mouse OGG1 was cloned into the pNIC28-vector and mouse OGG1 was purified as 
described for the human enzyme above. UNG2 was expressed from the pET28a vector 
(30) and purified essentially as described (34). Expression constructs of NUDT5, 
NUDT12, NUDT14, and NUDT15 in pNIC28 were kind gifts from SGC Stockholm. 
MTH1, SAMHD1, NUDT2, NUDT9 and NUDT18 were expressed from pET28a(+) 
(Novagen). Nudix proteins were expressed as N-terminally His-tagged in E. coli 
BL21(DE3) R3 pRARE2 at 18°C and were purified using HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) 
followed by gel filtration using HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) as decribed 
(32). NUDT2 was expressed at 18°C in BL21 DE3 (Life Technologies) and purified on 
HisTrap HP followed by cation exchange chromatography purification using HP monoQ 
column (GE Healthcare). dUTPase and dCTPase were expressed from pET28a(+) as N-
terminally His-tagged in BL21 DE3 and BL21 DE3 pLysS (Life Technologies), 
respectively, and purified using HisTrap HP followed by cation exchange 
chromatography using HP monoQ (GE Healthcare). Purity of protein preparations was 
analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Purified proteins were 
aliquoted and stored at −80°C. 
 
High throughput screening compatible OGG1 Glycosylase Activity Assay 
The OGG1 activity assay was performed in black 384-well plates (Optiplate, 
PerkinElmer) using final concentrations of 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 15 mM NaCl, 2 mM 
MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.0025% Tween-20, and 1:3000 dilution of dialyzed fish gelatin 
(Sigma G7765), 800 pM OGG1 enzyme, 2 nM APE1 and 10 nM 8-oxoA:C substrate in a 
final volume of 20 µl. The 8-oxodA:C substrate was a duplex oligonucleotide where 5�-
FAM-TCTG CCA 8CA CTG CGT CGA CCT G-3� was annealed to a 25% surplus of 5�-
CAG GTC GAC GCA GTG CTG GCA GT-Dab-3�. “8” signifies 8-oxoA and “FAM” 
and “Dab” signify fluorescein and dabcyl (TriLink Biotech). Briefly, compounds 
dissolved in DMSO were dispensed using an Echo 550 (Labcyte), followed by transfer of 
enzyme and substrate solutions by a FlexDrop (PerkinElmer). The reactions were stopped 
by dispensing an equal volume of 0.1% SDS and 1 mM EDTA and read in an Envision 
plate reader using a 485-nm filter with a bandwidth of 14 nm for excitation and a 535-nm 
filter with a bandwidth of 25 nm for emission.  
 
Compound Libraries 
The screening for inhibitors of OGG1 was done at the Laboratories of Chemical 
Biology Karolinska Institutet (LCBKI), part of Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden, 
using a compound concentration of 10 µM in 384-well microtiter plates (black 
Optiplates, PerkinElmer). Compounds originating from Enamine were screened, along 
with an LCBKI in-house compound library (donated by Biovitrum AB). All assay plates 
  
 
4 
 
contained test compounds in columns 1-22, whereas negative and positive controls in 
column 23 and column 24 were used for normalization. In this layout, the negative 
controls represent the uninhibited enzyme, corresponding to empty wells or wells with 
the equivalent amount of DMSO as the compound containing wells, whereas the positive 
controls represent the completely inhibited enzyme, corresponding to the lack of OGG1. 
 
Base Excision Repair Enzymes (BER) and DNA Intercalation Selectivity Assays 
BER enzymes were assayed with a similar strategy as OGG1, using identical DNA 
sequences surrounding the substrate lesion and the same reaction buffer containing 2 nM 
APE1. Briefly, for UNG2, we used uracil with adenine in the opposite strand, 500 nM 
substrate DNA, and 300 pM UNG2. For SMUG1 and TDG, we used 375 nM and 10 nM 
substrate, respectively, containing uracil opposite guanine and 0.3 U SMUG1 enzyme 
(M0336 from New England Biolabs) or 33 nM TDG. For Fpg and NEIL1 we used 
thymidine glycol opposite adenine, 10 and 20 nM substrate DNA, respectively and 0.2 U 
Fpg (New England Biolabs, M0240) or 10 nM NEIL1. For MPG we used a substrate 
containing inosine opposite thymine at 10 nM concentration and 0.3 U MPG (New 
England Biolabs, M0313). For APE1 we pre-treated the UNG2-substrate with E. coli 
Uracil-DNA glycosylase (New England Biolabs M0280) to generate an AP-site opposite 
adenine, which was used at 10 nM concentration in the presence of 0.1 nM APE1. All 
assays were in the linear range, and less than 40% of the total substrate had been 
consumed at readout. DNA intercalation was measured by incubating 10 nM unlabeled, 
undamaged oligonucleotides in OGG1 reaction buffer in the presence of 62.5 nM 
Thiazole Orange (Sigma Aldrich 390062) as described (33).  
 
NUDIX hydrolase, di- and triphosphatase selectivity assays  
Enzyme-catalysed hydrolysis reactions were coupled to inorganic pyrophosphatase 
(PPase) or alkaline phosphatase from bovine intestinal mucosa (BIP), thereby releasing 
inorganic phosphate. The produced free phosphate was then detected using the malachite 
green assay (34). These conditions gave robust assays with Z�-factors between 0.5 and 1, 
and signal to background ratios above 3. Substrate concentration at the Km value for the 
respective substrate was chosen if possible. Inhibition using 100 µM compound was 
tested in reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-Acetate pH 8.0, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 40 
mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.005% Tween-20) using conditions described in Table S3. 
Samplers were incubated with shaking at 22°C for 20 minutes. The reaction was then 
stopped by the addition of the malachite green reagent (34). SAMHD1 activity was 
measured following the established protocol (35). Absorbance was read at 630 nm using 
a Hidex Sense plate reader after a period of incubation with the MG reagent of 15 
minutes. The experiment was performed with data points in triplicate and percentage 
inhibition was calculated relative to the signal of a DMSO treated control.  
 
Target Engagement Assays 
Differential scanning fluorimetry (36) and cellular thermal shift assay (37) was 
performed as described previously.

Binding Site Characterization by HDX MS 
In-solution structural characterization of the OGG1/TH5487 complex was 
performed by comparing the local hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics between OGG1 
alone and in the presence of the small molecule. The method involves the following 
steps: 
Preparation of the OGG1/TH5487 complex. The OGG1/TH5487 interaction was 
initiated by mixing 48 µL of 0.3 mg/mL of OGG1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, pH 
7.5 with 1.4 µl of 1 mM TH5487 in DMSO (4× molar ligand excess), followed by 30 min 
incubating at room temperature. The control experiment was prepared in the same 
manner but using DMSO rather than TH5487. The HDX reaction was initiated by mixing 
2 �L of protein complex (or control) with 18 �l of deuterated buffer consisting of 50 mM 
Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 in D2O. The deuterium-labeling reaction was quenched 
by adding 30 �l of ice-cold 100 mM phosphate pH 2.3, 166 mM TCEP and 3.3 M urea. 
Each reaction was performed in triplicate using 30-sec, 1-min, 10-min, and 100-min 
deuteration labeling.  
Local Deuterium Uptake Measurement by HDX LC MS. Samples were analyzed in a 
semi-automated HDX-MS system in which manually injected samples were 
automatically digested, cleaned and separated at 2°C. Deuterated samples were digested 
using an in-house packed 2.1 × 30-mm immobilized pepsin column followed by a 3-min 
desalting step using 0.05% TFA at 350 µl/min. Peptic peptides were then separated by a 2 
mm I.D × 50-mm length HALO C18/1.8 µm column using a 20 min/2%–90% acetonitrile 
gradient in 0.3% formic acid at 100 µl/min. An Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) operated at 60,000 resolution at m/z 400 was used for analysis. The 
HDExaminer software (Sierra Analytics, USA) was used to process all HDX-MS data. 
Peptides exhibiting a statistically significant decrease in HDX kinetics in presence of the 
small molecule were identified as candidates for the binding site.  
 
X-ray crystallography 
Crystals of mOGG1 (20 mg/ml) were obtained from a sitting-drop vapor diffusion 
setup against 0.12 M Ethylene glycols, 0.1 M Buffer System 3 pH 8.5, and 50% v/v 
Precipitant Mix 4 (Morpheus screen (38), Molecular Dimensions, UK). Samples for co-
crystallization were prepared by pre-incubation of mOGG1 (18 mg/ml) with 2 mM–4 
mM of the ligands. The mOGG1:TH5675 complex was obtained with 0.09 M Halogens, 
0.1 M Buffer System 2 pH 7.5, 50 % v/v Precipitant Mix 3 (Morpheus screen (38), 
Molecular Dimensions, UK). A 200-nl drop of sample was mixed with an equal amount 
of reservoir and incubated at 16°C. Crystals grew within 1 week and were cryo-cooled in 
liquid nitrogen for data collection. Diffraction data were collected at station I04, and I24 
of Diamond Light Source (Oxon, UK). The complete dataset (between 2.06 and 2.5 Å) 
was collected from single crystals at 100 K for each complex. Raw data images were 
processed and scaled with xia2 (39), DIALS (40), and Aimless (41) using the CCP4 suite 
7.0 (42). Molecular replacement was performed with the coordinates of human OGG1 
(PDB code 1EBM), to determine initial phases for structure solution in Phaser (43). The 
working models were refined using Refmac5 (44) and manually adjusted with Coot (45). 
Validation was performed with MolProbity (46). Crystallographic data statistics are 
summarized in supplementary table S6. Figures were drawn with PyMOL (Schrödinger, 
LLC, New York).

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching 
Jurkat A3 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged wildtype OGG1 were centrifuged, 
resuspended in PBS and seeded onto Poly-L-Lysine coated µ-dish (ibidi). After 10 min, 
PBS was removed and fresh RPMI medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES and 16 
mM KBrO3 added to the cells for 1 h. A3 cells were subsequently released into medium 
containing either 0.1% DMSO or 10 �M TH5487 for indicated time periods and 
transferred to a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope equipped with a UV-transmitting 
Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.30 Oil DIC M27 objective. eGFP was excited with a 488 nm Ar 
laser line. The microscope was equipped with a heated environmental chamber set to 
37°C.  
For FRAP analysis, half of each nucleus was selected using the Regions tool of the 
ZEN software (ZEN, Zeiss, Germany) and photobleached with the 488 nm Ar-laser set to 
maximum power at 100% transmission using five iterations at scan speed 8 (5 µs). Before 
and after bleaching, confocal image series were recorded at 100 ms time intervals (20 
prebleach and 200 postbleach frames) with a frame size of 256 × 256 pixels and a pixel 
size of 110 nm, bidirectional scanning and a pinhole setting of 2.52 Airy units. Mean 
fluorescence intensities of the bleached region were corrected for background and for 
total nuclear loss of fluorescence over the time course. For the quantitative evaluation of 
photobleaching experiments, data of at least 19 nuclei from two or three independent 
experiments were averaged and the mean curve and the standard error of the mean 
calculated using Microsoft Excel software. Graphs were displayed using GraphPad 
Prism. 
 
Genomic 8-oxoG analysis 
Cells were treated with 20 mM KBrO3 for 1 h in complete medium and treated as 
indicated. Genomic DNA from 5 × 106 cells was purified using the EZNA tissue DNA kit 
(Omega Biotek, D3396). Prior to nucleoside analysis, RNA in the DNA isolates was 
degraded by incubating samples with 8 µg of RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 mM 
ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.0), 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM deferoxamine mesylate 
(DFO; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) at 37°C for 30 min. DFO chelates ferric iron, which 
can catalyze DNA oxidation by the Fenton reaction in vitro during sample preparation 
and result in artefactually high oxidative lesion levels. DFO is therefore used to reduce 
background 8-oxoG levels (47–49). Free nucleosides and nucleotides were then removed 
from samples by centrifugation through 30-kDa cut-off columns (Merck) and re-
dissolved in UHPLC-grade water. 
After RNAse pre-treatment, 15 µg DNA was hydrolyzed in 50 µl containing 0.8 U 
nuclease P1 from Penicillium citrinum (Sigma-Aldrich), 80 U Benzonase® nuclease 
(Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 U alkaline phosphatase from E. coli (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.25 
pmol 15N313C2-8-oxoG (Cambridge Isotopes) in 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 5.5), 1 
mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, and 0.4 mM DFO at 37°C for 1 h. The reactions were 
stopped by chilling on ice, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of three 
volumes ice-cold acetonitrile and centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The 
supernatants were then lyophilized at –80°C to dryness. Finally, the samples were re-
dissolved in 30 µl of water for LC/MS/MS analysis, of which 5 µl was diluted 5,000-fold 
  
 
7 
 
to measure unmodified nucleosides and 20 µl was used to measure 8-oxoG. All analyses 
were performed with an Agilent 6495 triple quadrupole LC/MS/MS system with an 
Agilent EclipsePlusC18 RRHD column (2.1 × 150 mm, 1.8-µm particle size). The mobile 
phases were (A) UHPLC-grade water and (B) UHPLC-grade methanol, both containing 
0.1 %UHPLC-grade formic acid. The unmodified nucleoside HPLC method used a flow 
rate of 300 µl/min with an isocratic flow of 24% B for 2.3 min. The 8-oxoG HPLC 
method used a flow rate of 300 µl/min with 5% B to 2.5 min, ramp to 13% B at 3 min, 
ramp to 17.16% B at 5.5 min, hold at 35 % B from 5.5 to 7 min, ramp to 5% at 8 min, 
and equilibration with 5% B from 7 to 11.5 min. The mass transitions used were 284.1 � 
168; 289.1 � 173; 252.1 � 136; 228.1 � 111.9; 268.1 � 152; and 243.1 � 127 m/z for 
8-oxoG, 15N313C2-8-oxoG, dA, dC, dG, and dT, respectively.

Abcam (ab124741, EPR4664(2)), or a rabbit polyclonal OGG1 antibody from Novus 
(NB100-106). Loading controls were monoclonal rabbit anti-GAPDH (CellSignaling 
Technologies Cat #2118, 14C10), or monoclonal mouse anti-actin from Abcam (ab6276, 
AC-15). OGG1 inhibitor O8 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat # SML1697), 
mouse anti-FLAG Ab M2 (MilliporeSigma (Cat # F1804); chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quality rabbit anti-NF-�B/RelA (Cat # sc-372X), and

O111:B4) and LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Cat # 20148) were purchased 
from ThermoFisher Scientific. 
 
Mammalian Expression  
The human OGG1 coding sequence excluding the stop codon was cloned from the 
pNIC28-OGG1 construct into the SalI-XhoI restriction site of the pENTR1A no CCDB 
(w48-1) vector (addgene # 17398), which had been modified to contain EGFP in the 
XhoI-XbaI site (a kind gift from Dr. P Herr). The K249Q mutation was created by site-
directed mutagenesis. Both constructs were transferred into the pLenti PGK Puro DEST 
(w529-2) (addgene # 19068), using the Gateway LR Clonase II system (Invitrogen # 
11791-020). The plasmids were packaged into lentiviral particles and transduced into 
Jurkat A3 cells and selected using 1 µg/ml puromycin for 7 days. The wild-type OGG1 
was cloned into pCMV-N-FLAG expression plasmid (MilliporeSigma) and the sequence 
identity of N-terminal FLAG-tagged OGG1 was confirmed by direct sequencing (50). 
Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the 
manufacturer’s instruction.

CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of OGG1 
OGG1 was knocked out essentially as described (51). Briefly, two OGG1 targeting 
sequences 5�-GATGCGGGCGATGTTGTTGTTGG-3� and 5�-
AACAACATCGCCCGCATCACTGG-3� were cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro 
plasmid. Following transfection into HEK293T cells, cells were treated with 2 �g/ml of 
puromycin for 96 h and re-seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 cells/well. Out of 
768 wells, 70 clones were established, of which three displayed reduced OGG1 
expression (Fig. S7D). Knockouts were validated by Sanger sequencing of the targeted 
region, followed by analysis using Tracking of Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) 
(https://tide.nki.nl/) (52). 
  
Cell culture and maintenance  
The A3 and MLE 12 cell lines were acquired from the American Type Culture 
Collection (ATCC). A3 (ATTC CRL-2570) was grown in RPMI medium supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). An immortalized type 2 mouse lung epithelial cell 
line (MLE 12; ATCC CRL-2110) was grown in DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS). FBS (HyClone Cat #: SH30084) was obtained from GE Healthcare Life 
Sciences. All media were supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml; Gibco, Life 
Technologies,Inc.) and streptomycin (100 g/ml; Gibco, Life Technologies, Inc.). The 
human telomerase and cyclin-dependent kinase 4-immortalized human normal small 
epithelial cell line (hSAEC) were kindly provided by Dr. JD Minna (Hamon Center for 
Therapeutic Oncology Research, Department of Internal Medicine Pharmacology, 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA). These cells display 
characteristics of normal airway epithelial cells including morphology, epithelial cell 
markers cytokeratins 7, 14, 17, and 19, the stem cell marker p63, p16(INK4a) and have 
an intact p53 checkpoint pathway (53). hSAECs were cultured in small airway epithelial 
growth media (SAGMTM, Cat # CC-3119), supplemented with Bulletkit (Cat # CC-4124) 
containing 52 �g/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal 
growth factor (EGF), 0.5 �g/ml epinephrine, 1 �g/ml hydrocortisone, 10 �g/ml 
transferrin, 5 �g/ml insulin, 0.1 ng/ml retinoic acid (RA), 6.5 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 50 
�g/ml gentamicin/amphotericin-B (GA-1000), and 50 �g/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum 
albumin (BSA). Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination 
(https://microbiology.utmb.edu/centers/tccf-tissue-culture-core-facility). Cell lines 
identity was determined using Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis 
(https://scmm.utmb.edu/cores/genomics-core/sequencing) as suggested by the ATCC 
Standard Development Organization. 
 
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) properties 
The kinetic solubility, utilizing test compound from 10 mM DMSO stock solution, 
was measured at a final compound concentration of 100 µM and 1% DMSO. The test 
compound was added to 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer and incubated at 37°C for 
at least 20 hours in a heater-shaker. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 
3,000 × g at 37°C for 30 min to pellet insoluble material and an aliquot of the supernatant 
was taken for analysis. After dilution of the sample, the concentration of dissolved 
compound was quantified by LC–MS/MS analysis.  
  
 
9 
 
Metabolic stability was determined in 0.5 mg/ml human (pooled) or mouse (pooled) 
liver microsomes at a compound concentration of 1 µM in 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 
7.4 in a total incubation volume of 500 µl. The reaction was initiated by addition of 1 
mM NADPH. At various incubation times (i.e., at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 min), a sample 
was withdrawn from the incubation and the reaction was terminated by addition of ice-
cold acetonitrile. The amount of parent compound remaining was analyzed by LC–
MS/MS.  
Plasma protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis of drug in plasma 
against an isotonic buffer. Pooled human plasma was provided by the Uppsala Academic 
Hospital and was collected from two male and two female donors (non-smoking). 0.2 ml 
of the plasma test solution (10 µM final compound concentration) was transferred to the 
membrane tube in a rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) insert. Isotonic phosphate buffer 
(0.35 ml) pH 7.4 was added to the other side of the membrane. The 96-well base plate is 
then sealed with an adhesive plastic film (Scotch Pad) to prevent evaporation. The sample 
is incubated with rapid rotation (900 rpm) on a Kisker rotational incubator at 37°C for 4 h 
to achieve equilibrium. After incubation, the contents of each plasma and buffer 
compartment were removed and mixed with equal volumes of control buffer or plasma as 
appropriate to maintain matrix similarity for analysis. The samples were then sealed, 
centrifuged and the supernatant is analyzed by mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The 
following LC–MS/MS system was used: Waters XEVO TQ triple-quadrupole mass 
spectrometer (electrospray ionization, ESI) coupled to a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters 
Corp.). For chromatographic separation a general gradient was used (1% mobile phase B 
to 90% over 2 min total run) on a C18 BEH 1.7 µm column 2 × 50mm (Waters Corp.). 
Mobile phase A consisted of 5% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B 100% 
acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. 5 µl of the sample were 
injected. When analyzing plasma protein binding and solubility samples a standard curve 
between 1 nM–1000 nM is prepared. 
 
Pharmacokinetics, blood and serum parameters 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in compliance with EU 2010/63 
directive and approved by the regional experimental animal ethical committee in 
Stockholm (N484/12). The animals were housed under sterile conditions and were 
provided with enrichment and free access to food and water. The environmental 
conditions, temperature, humidity, cage size and light cycle were according to laboratory 
animal guidelines and regulations. Animals were acclimatized for 1 week before 
initiation of study. Groups of 7-week-old female C57Bl/6N mice (Charles River 
laboratories) were administrated either one single dose orally (30 mg/kg) or intravenously 
(10 mg/kg), according to body weight. Blood was collected in EDTA-coated collection 
tubes (Sarstedt, Helsingborg, Sweden) at different time points. Three animals were used 
for each time point. Plasma was separated from by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using PK Solutions 2.0TM 
Noncompartmental Pharmacokinetics Data Analysis Software. 
To establish blood and serum parameters, six C57Bl/6N (Charles River laboratories, 
three male and three female) in vehicle and treatment group were administered either 
vehicle or 30 mg/kg TH5487 by intraperitoneal injection once a day for 5 consecutive 
days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, blood was collected by orbital bleeding 
  
 
10 
 
to measure whole blood parameters. Serum was subjected to various clinical chemistry 
assays to detect any toxic effects to major organs. Blood and serum profiles were 
measured by Adlego Biomedical AB, Solna, Sweden. 
 
In vivo inflammation experiments  
In vivo inflammation experiments were performed according to the NIH Guide for 
Care and Use of Experimental Animals and approved by the University Texas Medical 
Branch (UTMB) Animal Care and Use Committee (approval no. 0807044B). Eight-
week-old female and male BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, 
USA) housed in pathogen-free conditions in the animal research facility of the UTMB 
(Galveston, Texas) were used for these studies. Randomly selected groups of mice (50% 
� and 50%) were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with TNF� (20 ng per mouse) or 20 ng 
LPS, per lung in 60 µl of pH-balanced saline solution (pH: 7.4) under mild anesthesia 
(54) one hour after intraperitoneal administration of TH5487 (30, 15, and 8 mg per kg, in 
a 200-�l volume without anesthesia) or vehicle only (5% DMSO, 10% Tween 80 in 
saline). In controls, mice were challenged alone with TNF� (20 ng), LPS (100 ng) or 
saline (60 µl). Independent groups of mice were intraperitoneally injected with TH5487 
(30 mg per kg) dissolved in 5% DMSO and 10% Tween 80 in saline. During a 48-h 
observation period, there were no signs of toxicity observed as determined by well-
established clinical illness grading scale (0 = healthy; 1 = barely ruffled fur; 2 = ruffled 
fur but active; 3 = ruffled fur and inactive; 4 = ruffled fur, inactive, and hunched; 5 = 
dead).  
 
Evaluation of airway inflammation 
Evaluation of airway inflammation was performed essentially as described (22). 
Briefly, tracheae were cannulated, and lungs were lavaged by two instillations of 0.6 ml 
of ice-cold PBS. Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were centrifuged (800 × 
g for 5 min at 4oC), and the resulting supernatants were stored at −80°C for further 
analysis. Total cell counts in the BALF were determined from an aliquot of the cell 
suspension using a hemocytometer. Differential cell counts were performed on 
cytocentrifuge preparations (Shandon CytospinR 4 Cytocentrifuge, Thermo Scientific, 
Waltham, MA). Cells were stained with Modified Wright–Giemsa using HEMA-TEK 
2000 Slide Stainer (ProtocolTM) for differential cell counts. Differential cell counts were 
performed in a blind fashion by two independent researchers counting 1000 cells from 
each animal. Randomly selected fields were photographed using an OLYMPUS 
Microscope System BX53P microscope with a built-in digital CCD color camera 
DP73WDR.  
 
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) 
RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. Briefly, DNaseI-treated total RNA was loaded onto an RNeasy 
column and subjected to washes with RW1 and RPE buffers. RNA was eluted with the 
RNase-free water included in the kit. The RNA concentration was determined 
spectrophotometrically on an Epoch Take-3™ system (Biotek, Winooski, VT) using 
Gen5 v2.01 software. The quality of the total RNA was confirmed via the 260/280 nm 
ratio, which varied from 1.9 – 2.0. One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed using 
  
 
11 
 
a SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). qRT-
PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix 
(BioRad) in an CFX 96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio Rad). The transcript levels 
were evaluated using the 2-��Ct method (55) using Microsoft Excel. The validated primers 
were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (San Diego, CA USA) and the 
sequences may be found in Supplementary Table S11. 
 
Gene expression profiling 
Parallel cultures of cells were treated with TH5487 (5 �M) or mock-treated (0.05% 
DMSO) for 1 h and then exposed to TNF� for 30 minutes (20 ng/ml). Total RNA was 
isolated with RNeasy Mini Kit followed by DNase I treatment. RNA from three 
independent cultures were pooled and cDNA were synthesized using Superscript® III 
First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). cDNA was mixed with equal amounts of 2X 
iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) and 20 �l of reaction mixture was added 
to each well of the Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines & Receptors PCR Array (PAMM-
011ZA) to determine changes in mRNA levels. The qRT-PCR was performed using an 
ABI PRISM® 7000 Sequence Detection System. The normalization used the average of 
the following housekeeping genes: beta-D-glucuronidase (Gusb), beta-2 microglobulin 
(B2M), heat shock protein 90 Alpha (cytosolic) family class A member 1 (Hsp90ab1), 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), and actin cytoplasmic 1 (Actb). 
Target gene signals normalized to housekeeping genes as described above (55). The 
normalization and all the data analysis were performed according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions using their web-based software package: 
http://sabiosciences.com/pcrarraydataanalysis.php. The full lists of gene names are in the 
legend of Supplementary Figure S8. 
 
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) 
To evaluate OGG1 binding to damaged DNA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
were performed by incubating 10 nM duplex oligo containing 8-oxoG with 100 nM 
OGG1 enzyme in 25 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 15 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM DTT, 
supplemented with 5% glycerol and OrangeG as loading dye. The duplex oligo had the 
sequence 5�-FAM-TGT ATC GAT ACC XTC AAC CTC GAG GAA TT-3�, where “X” 
signifies 8-oxoG (GeneLink). The complementary sequence, in 25% excess, had the 
sequence 5�-AAT TCC TCG AGG TTG ACG GTA TCG ATA CA-3�. Samples were 
incubated with OGG1, TH5487, and DNA for 15 minutes on ice, then separated at 200 V 
for 45 minutes in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (0.5 × TBE, 5% glycerol). 
To assess NF-�B binding to synthetic DNA, mock- and TNF�-exposed cells were 
harvested and nuclear extracts (NEs) were prepared using CelLyticTM NuCLEARTM 
extraction kit (NXTRACT, MilliporeSigma) and EMSAs were performed as described 
(3). In brief, protein concentrations of NEs were assessed using the protein assay kit (Bio-
Rad). Probes (10 fmol) were mixed with NE (2 �g) in buffer containing 2 mM HEPES 
(pH 7.5), 4 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.25 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 
50 ng/�L of poly(dI-dC), and 1 mg/ml BSA. EMSAs for recombinant NF-�B subunits 
(RelA(p65R) and/or p50R) were first annealed in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM NaCl, 1 
mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mg/ml BSA at 37°C for 1 h. The mixture was incubated 
with 8-oxo(G) (G*) and NF-�B-binding site containing synthetic double-stranded 
  
 
12 
 
oligonucleotides DNA (probe; Dharmacon Inc, GE Healthcare, Lafayette, CO, USA) for 
15 min at 4°C (Supplementary Table S12). Unlabeled probe was used for competition 
experiments. Samples were resolved on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) in 0.25 × 
TBE buffer. Visualization of NF-�B-DNA complexes was carried out with LightShift 
chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific).  
To validate the effect of TH5487 on binding of OGG1 to the duplex DNA probe, 10 
nM OGG1 in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA were 
incubated with TH5487 for 30 min and mixture was added to duplex DNA probes (10 
fmol) lacking or containing 8-oxoG for 15 min at 4°C. Sequences of synthetic DNA are 
identical to those used in NF-�B EMSA. EMSA and visualization of OGG1-DNA 
complexes were carried out using LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo 
Scientific). Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ v1.51 (U. S. National Institutes 
of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). 
 
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting 
Cells (1×107 per time point) were exposed to TNF� (20 ng/ml) and lysed using 
buffer from Cell Signaling Technology (Cat # 9803; 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 
mM glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, and 20 �g/ml aprotin/leupeptin/ 
phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4°C for 
30 minutes. The pre-cleared (on protein A agarose; MilliporeSigma; Cat # 16-125; for 1 
h) supernatants were incubated with antibody against RelA for 12 h and then protein A 
agarose slurry (50%) for 3 h with continuous rotation. The immunoprecipitates were then 
washed with lysis buffer and resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacryamide gel 
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Proteins were transferred, and nitrocellulose membranes 
were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (20 mM Tris base, 500 mM NaCl, and 
0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.5) and then incubated for 3 h with anti-phospho-RelA antibody 
(1:1000 dilution) and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary 
antibody (1:4000 dilution; SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). The signals were 
detected using the ECL Plus chemiluminescent detection system (GE Life Sciences, 
Bucking Hampshire, UK). After stripping membranes were probed with antibody to RelA 
(Santa Cruz (Sc-8008). Even loading was confirmed using the GAPDH antibody (Cat # 
14C10; Cell Signaling Technology). 
 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)  
ChIP assays were performed as described by "ChIP-sequencing guidelines and 
practices” of the ENCODE (http://encodeproject.org/ENCODE/) and modENCODE 
consortia using slight modifications. Briefly, Flag-OGG1-transfected cells (107) (3) were 
stimulated with TNF� (20 ng/ml) for 0 or 30 min and DNA/protein were cross-linked 
with 1% paraformaldehyde and sheared (average 300 bp) with 30-second pulses using 
Cole-Parmer’s GEX 130 Ultrasonic processor (Vernon Hills, IL, USA) set to 30% of 
maximum power. DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using protein A- or 
G-agarose (Millipore, Corporation Billerica, MA, USA) with ChIP quality antibodies 
(Abs) [NF-�B-RelA, Cat # sc-372X; IgG, Cat # sc-2027; Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa 
Cruz, CA); anti-FLAG Ab, Cat # F1804, SigmaMillipore (Cambridge, MA)], using a 
ChIP-IT® Express Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kits (ActiveMotif, Cat # 53008). The 
  
 
13 
 
precipitates were washed three times, de-cross-linked and subjected to qPCR, using the 
primer sequences in Supplementary Table S13. ChIP-qPCR calculations were performed 
as described previously (56). In brief, the ChIP-ed DNA signal was divided by the IgG-
ChIP-ed signal, representing the ChIP-DNA signal as the fold increased relative to the 
IgG signal. This method was based on the assumption that the ChIP of a specific Ab 
contains both specific signal and background, whereas the ChIP of IgG represents the 
background alone. 
Synthetic Chemistry Experimental Section  
General Information.  
All reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Combi-Blocks, 
Thermo Fischer Scientific, or VWR and were used without purification. Unless otherwise 
stated, reactions were performed without care to exclude air or moisture. Analytical thin-
layer chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 F-254 plates (E. Merck) and 
visualized under a UV lamp. Flash column chromatography was performed in a Biotage® 
SP4 MPLC system using Merck silica gel 60 Å (40–63 µm mesh). 1H and 13C NMR 
spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are 
expressed in parts per million (ppm) and referenced to the residual solvent peak. 
Analytical LC–MS were performed on an Agilent MSD mass spectrometer connected to 
an Agilent 1100 system with: Method ST1090A3: Column ACE 3 C8 (50 × 3.0 mm); 
H2O (+ 0.1% TFA) and MeCN were used as mobile phases at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, 
with a gradient from 10% – 90% in 3 min; or Method B0597X3: Column Xterra MSC18 
(50 × 3.0 mm); H2O (containing 10 mM NH4HCO3; pH = 10) and MeCN were used as 
mobile phases at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with a gradient of 5% – 97% in 3 min. For LC–
MS, detection was made by UV (254 or 214 nm) and MS (ESI+). Preparative LC was 
performed on a Gilson system using Waters C18 OBD 5 µm column (30 × 75 mm) with 
water buffer (50 mM NH4HCO3 at pH 10) and acetonitrile as mobile phases using a flow 
rate of 45 ml/min. All final compounds were assessed to be >95% pure by LC–MS 
analysis.

mg, 4.61 mmol) and NiCl2 (120 mg. 0.922 mmol) was suspended in acetonitrile (20 ml) 
and water (2.0 ml) and cooled to 4°C, then NaBH4 (698 mg, 18.4 mmol) was added 
  
 
14 
 
portion wise. The mixture was then diluted with DCM (30 ml) and decanted. The mixture 
was poured into NaHCO3 (20 mL) and extracted with DCM (3 × 30 ml). The combined

Supplementary Fig. S5: Selectivity of OGG1 inhibitors on DNA repair enzymes and 
DNA intercalation. (A) Selectivity of TH5487 on DNA repair enzymes. The indicated 
base excision repair enzymes were incubated with a dilution series of TH5487 and 
suitable fluorescence reporter substrates. Fluorescence was recorded when total substrate 
conversion was less than 30%. Shown are average of duplicate reactions, representative 
of independent experiments (n=33 for hsOGG1, n=3 for UNG2, APE1, and NEIL1, n=2 
for Fpg, SMUG1, APE1, and MPG, and n=1 for TDG and mmOGG1). (B) DNA 
intercalation assay. 10 nM DNA oligo was incubated with 150 nM thiazole orange and 
the indicated concentrations of OGG1 inhibitors or propidium iodide as positive control. 
DNA intercalation causes a loss of fluorescence due to thiazole orange being out-
competed from binding DNA. The known intercalator propidium idodide (PI) was used 
as positive control. Data are average ± SD of three technical replicates, representative of 
two independent experiments. (C) O8 inhibits signal generation from AP-site substrates 
in the absence of OGG1. 10 nM AP-site substrate pre-incubated or not with 10 �M O8 
was digested with 1 nM APE1 enzyme and fluorescence were recorded as a function of 
time. Pre-incubation with 10 �M O8 resulted in a plateau in fluorescence values, 
indicating that the O8 compound may react with the aldehyde-containing AP-site 
substrate. The AP-site substrate was prepared from an identical substrate as that used in 
the OGG1 assay, except that 8-oxoA was replaced with uracil, which was subsequently 
converted into an AP-site using E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase. Data are average ± SD 
of three technical replicates and are representative of two independent experiments. (D) 
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 10 nM of a duplex oligonucleotide containing 8-
oxoG or a canonical guanine opposite cytosine was incubated with increasing 
concentrations of OGG1 and separated on a polyacrylamide gel. Binding of OGG1 to 
  
 
25 
 
damaged DNA results in a slower migrating band. 100 nM OGG1 was used in 
subsequent experiments.

Data are presented as average ± SD of 12 technical replicates, representative of two 
independent experiments. (D) Close-up view of ligand TH5675 (orange) binding to mOGG1. 
Important residues in the binding site are marked, hydrogen bond interactions are shown in black 
dashed line. Unbiased simulated annealing omit map for the ligand at 1�. (E) Comparison 
between the binding of ligand TH5675 (orange) and 8-oxoG-containing DNA (black). The 
structure of mOGG1:TH5675 was superposed with human OGG1 (PDB 1EBM) bound to a 
substrate oligonucleotide (cartoon depiction). The guanine base of TH5675 occupies a different 
position to what was observed in the substrate-bound structure (of PDB 1EBM). (F) 
Superposition of native mOGG1 structure (blue) with the TH5675 complex (gray). Binding of the 
inhibitor causes a local conformational change where the surrounding pocket closes around the 
ligand (Movie S1). In particular, residues H270, F319 and L323 are seen to change position. (G) 
Comparison of native mouse (blue) and human (gold, PDB 1KO9) OGG1 crystal structures. The 
two homologues share 90% sequence identity and have identical tertiary structure.

Supplementary Fig. S13: TH5487 decreases NF-�B DNA occupancy to 8-oxoG 
containing synthetic DNA in crude nuclear extracts (NE). (A) TH5487 decreases 
binding of NF-�B to 8-oxoG –containing oligo. MLE 12 and hSAECs were TNF� (20 
ng/ml) exposed for 30 min and nuclear extracts were isolated using CelLyticTM 
NuCLEARTM extraction kit (MilliporeSigma). Two micrograms of NE was incubated 
with the indicated concentrations TH5487 for 60 min and added to DNA probes 
containing 8-oxoG (10 fmol) for 15 min at 4°C. Samples were separated on a 6% non-
denaturing gel at 4°C. The DNA probes were visualized using LightShift 
chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific). The DNA sequence of the probe is 
based on the human TNF promoter (−224 to −193) and contains 8-oxoG in sense strand

8-bp upstream of an NF-�B binding site (Supplementary Table S12). (B and C), Binding 
of NF-�B to 8-oxoG–containing oligo based on the mouse Cxcl2 promoter. MLE 12 
cells and hSAECs were exposed to TNF� (20 ng/ml) for 30 min. NE from both cell lines 
were prepared as in panel a. Two micrograms of nuclear extracts from MLE 12 (B) or 
hSAEC (C) was incubated with the indicated doses TH5487 for 60 min and added to 
probe (10 fmol) and EMSA was carried out as in panel A. The DNA sequence is based on 
the sequence of the mouse Cxcl2 promoter (−65 to –34 bp) and contains 8-oxoG in anti-
sense strand 9 bp down-stream from an NF-�B binding site. Oligo sequences are shown 
in Supplementary Table S12. NS, non-specific. (D) OGG1 increases NF-�B binding to 
8-oxoG-containing DNA, whereas TH5487 perturbs it. OGG1, the indicated 
concentrations of TH5487, and homo- or heterodimeric NF-�B were added to 10 fmol of 
a 8-oxoG- and NF-�B binding motif-containing double stranded DNA probe for 10 min. 
and separated on a non-denaturating polyacrylamide gel. In lanes 1–4, equimolar 
amounts of recombinant p50 (55 fmol) and RelA(p65) (55 fmol) were annealed in 
binding buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA) at 
37°C for 60 min. OGG1 (10 nM) was incubated with the indicated doses TH5487 for 30 
min. In lane 5, NF-�B binding was competed out using 100-fold excess DNA without 8-
oxoG. In lane 6, OGG1 increased NF-kB DNA occupancy. In lane 7, NF-�B DNA 
occupancy in absence of OGG1. For more information, see (3). (E) In the absence of 
OGG1, TH5487 does not inhibit NF-�B binding to 8-oxoG-containing DNA. 
Equimolar amounts of recombinant p50 (55 fmol) and RelA(p65) (55 fmol) were 
annealed as in legend to D. A mixture of homo (p50–p50) and heterodimeric (p50–p65) 
NF-�B was incubated with various concentrations of TH5487 for 60 min and added to 8-
oxoG- and NF-�B binding motif-containing double stranded DNA probes (10 fmol) for 
10 min at 4oC. In lane 6, NF-�B binding was competed out by an 100-fold excess 
unlabeled probe. In D to E, samples were resolved on a 6% non-denaturing DNA 
retardation gel in Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer at 4°C. NF-�B-DNA complexes were 
visualized using LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific). NF-�B 
binding was competed out using 100-fold excess of unlabeled double stranded DNA 
probe. Probe sequence is derived from TNF promoter (Supplementary Table S12). NS, 
non-specific. For more information, see (3). Band intensities for the p50+p65 and

Supplementary Fig. S14: TH5487 does not inhibit NF-�B activation. (A) Direct 
assessment of NF-�B activation by determining changes in RelA phosphorylation at 
serine 276 in TH5487 treated cells. MLE 12 cells were treated with TH5487 (5 �M) or 
BSM345541 (5 �M) for 1h and TNF� (20 ng/ml) was added for the indicated times. 
Whole cell extracts were isolated and 20 �g protein per lane were fractionated by 4%–
20% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated RelA (serine residue at 276) (57) was detected by 
immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho RelA antibody. Loading controls were total 
RelA (anti-RelA Ab; middle panel) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH, lower panel). In controls, inhibition of I kappa B-alpha by BSM345541(27) 
prevented the release and phosphorylation of RelA. (B) Assessment of NF-�B activation 
via RelA phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation after TH5487 treatment of cells. 
MLE 12 cells were treated as in A. At indicated times, cell extracts were made and 
clarified by centrifugation. Then, 500 �g protein equivalent of supernatants were 
incubated with rabbit RelA antibody. Protein A agarose was subsequently added with 
continuous rotation. The immunoprecipitates were then washed and equal amounts were 
resolved by 4%–20% SDS–PAGE. Proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes were 
subjected to immunoblot analysis using a rabbit antibody to phospho-RelA (Fig. B upper 
panel). After stripping, membranes were probed with antibody to RelA (mouse, Fig. B 
middle panel). Even loading was confirmed by testing membranes with GAPDH antibody

Supplementary Fig. S16: Inhibition of TNF� and LPS-induced lung inflammation 
by TH5487. (A) Long term TH5487 administration does not affect mouse body weight. 
Mice were administered 20–40 mg/kg TH5487 orally once every day on weekdays. At 
the start of the treatment the dose was 20 mg/kg TH5487, which was subsequently raised 
to 40 mg/kg after the first week (n=3–6 per treatment group). Average values ± SD are 
shown. No overt behavioral changes or signs of toxicity were observed, and the 
experiment was not stopped due to toxicity in any of the groups. (B) Visual depiction of 
cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Challenge with TNF� (20 ng per lung) induces 
infiltration of neutrophils, whereas the samples from TH5487-treated animals are 
dominated by macrophages. Ten to sixteen randomly selected field of view per cytospon 
slide were photographed using a WHN10×/22 eyepiece and a 20× objective (field of view

(C to D), Inhibition of TNF�-induced lung inflammation by TH5487. TH5487 (30, 15, 
and 8 mg per kg) or equivalent volume of vehicle (saline containing 5% DMSO and 10% 
Tween 80) was administered to groups of mice (n=5–7) via intraperitoneal route (i.p.) 3 h 
and 1 h before lungs were challenged with TNF� (20 ng per lung) or vehicle (saline). 
Sixteen hours after challenge, the mice were euthanized and lavaged and the number of 
cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) was determined after Modified Wright–
Giemsa staining in a blinded fashion. At least 1,000 cells were counted per mouse. n = 9 
(vehicle), n = 12 (TNF� and 30 mg/kg), n = 10 (TNF� and 15 mg/kg), n = 9 (TNF� and 8 
mg/kg), n = 9 (TH5487 alone, 30 mg/kg), n = 12 (TNF� and vehicle). Panel C indicates 
the neutrophil count in the respective samples. Data are average ± SD, from two 
independent experiments. (E) Inhibition of LPS-induced airway inflammation by 
TH5487. TH5487 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline containing 5% DMSO and 10% Tween

route (i.p.) 3 h and 1 h before challenge of lungs with LPS (20 ng per lung) or vehicle 
(saline). Sixteen hours after challenge, the mice were euthanized, lavaged and the number 
cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids determined. Differential cell counts were 
performed after Modified Wright–Giemsa staining, as in the legend to S16B-D. Data are 
average ± SD, representative of six experimental animals from one experimental run. (F) 
Visual depiction of cell composition of BALF derived from mouse lungs. Mice were

Supplementary Fig. S17: TH5487 interrupts ongoing TNF�-induced lung 
inflammation 
(A) Recruitment kinetics of neutrophil into lungs after TNF� challenge. Parallel groups 
of mice (n =6) were intranasally challenged with TNF� (20 ng per lung). Mice were 
euthanized at the indicated times after challenge, lavaged and the number of cells in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) was determined. Differential cell counts were 
performed after Modified Wright–Giemsa staining on coded slides by two independent 
investigators in blinded fashion. Data are average ± SD from six individual animals per 
condition from one experimental run. (B and C) TH5487 interrupts ongoing 
inflammatory processes induced by TNF�. Randomly selected groups of mice (n = 6, 
50% � and 50% �) were challenged via nasal route with 40 �l vehicle or TNF� (20 ng 
per lung) in 40 �l of vehicle. TH5487 (30 mg/kg) in saline containing 5% DMSO and 
10% Tween 80 was administered i.p. 1 h before or 3 h, 6 h or 9 h after TNF� challenge. 
Sixteen hours after TNF� challenge, groups of mice were euthanized, and lavaged. The 
number of cells in BALF was determined as in legend to A. All values indicate average ± 
SD, from six individual animals per condition from one experimental run. *** signifies p 
< 0.001, using unpaired two-sided t-test.

Supplementary Fig. S18: Effect of SU268 on OGG1 activity, OGG1 thermal stability 
and pro-inflammatory gene expression. (A) Inhibition curve for SU268. Under these 
conditions, the compound inhibits OGG1 with an IC50-value of 340 nM. The line 
represents the average of two technical replicates (n=1). (B) OGG1 melting curve in the 
presence of the indicated OGG1 inhibitors. 100 µM of the indicated compounds were 
incubated with 4 µM OGG1 in the presence of SYPRO Orange. Thermal protein 
denaturation causes an increase in fluorescence, that is shifted by ~7°C by TH5487 and 
SU268 compared to DMSO (p<0.001, using unpaired, two-sided t-test). Data are 
presented as average ± SD of 12 technical replicates, representative of two independent 
experiments. (C) SU268 inhibits pro-inflammatory gene expression. MLE 12 cells were 
pre-incubated with DMSO or 5 µM SU268 for 1 h and stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNF� 
for 30 minutes. Expression levels of Ccl2, Il6 and Tnf were quantified with qRT-PCR. 
Data are displayed as average ± SD of three technical replicates and are representative of 
two independent experiments. * signifies p<0.05, and *** p<0.001, using unpaired, two-

Supplementary Fig. S19: Model of TH5487-mediated inhibition of pro-
inflammatory gene expression. The onset and ongoing inflammation is associated with 
generation of reactive oxygen species, causing damage to DNA in particular at guanine-
rich promoters. OGG1 binding to oxidized guanines at promoter regions facilitate 
recruitment of downstream transcription factors that drive pro-inflammatory gene 
expression, and a cellular inflammatory response. In the presence of TH5487, OGG1 can 
no longer interact with DNA substrates in promoters, so pro-inflammatory gene 
expression is inhibited, and the cellular inflammatory response is prevented.

Target 
Human recombinant OGG1 (O15527) 
 
Primary measurement 
Measure increase in fluorescence following 
cleavage of a duplex oligonucleotide containing 
fluorophore, quencher and an OGG1 substrate. An 
excessive amount of APE1 is present to cleave the 
backbone of the strand containing the substrate 
base, leading to a dissociation of the fluorophore 
from the quencher and an increase in signal. 
 
Key reagents  
OGG1 and APE1 recombinant enzymes, duplex 
oligonucleotide with modified base.
