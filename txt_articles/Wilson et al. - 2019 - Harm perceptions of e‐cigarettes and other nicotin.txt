ABSTRACT
Background and aims
E-cigarettes (EC) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are less harmful than smoking, but
misperceptions of relative harm are common. Aims were to (1) assess nicotine knowledge and perceptions of: harm of
EC and NRT relative to smoking, addictiveness of EC relative to smoking, and change in harm to user if smoking replaced
with EC; (2) define associations of these perceptions with respondent characteristics including nicotine knowledge; and (3)
explore perceived main harms of EC and whether these differ by vaping status. Design
Analyses were: (1) frequencies;
(2) logistic regressions of perceptions of relative harm, addictiveness and change in harm onto demographics, smoking
and vaping status and nicotine knowledge (attributing cancer or health risks of smoking to nicotine); and (3) frequencies
and χ2 statistics. Setting and participants
Participants were smokers and recent ex-smokers from one wave
(September 2017) of a longitudinal online survey in the United Kingdom (n = 1720). Measurements
Demographics
included gender, age, smoking status, vaping status and income. Survey questions collected data on nicotine knowledge
and harm perceptions of different products; the relative harm perceptions of NRT, EC and tobacco cigarettes; and
perceived main harms of EC. Findings
Relative to smoking, 57.3% perceived EC and 63.4% NRT to be less harmful;
25.4% perceived EC to be less addictive; and 32.2% thought replacing smoking with EC reduced health harms a great
deal. Participants were less likely to endorse these beliefs if they had never vaped, and participants who had inaccurate
nicotine knowledge were less likely to endorse all these beliefs apart from the addictiveness of EC. The main concerns
about EC were a lack of research (48.3%), regulation or quality control (37.8%) and harmfulness of chemicals (41.6%).
Conclusions
Large proportions of UK smokers and ex-smokers overestimate the relative harmfulness of e-cigarettes
and nicotine replacement therapy compared with smoking; misattributing smoking harms to nicotine is associated with
increased misperceptions.
Keywords

INTRODUCTION
Smoking tobacco cigarettes is one of the most dangerous
behaviours, as it kills more than half of those with
sustained use. There are many health harms from
smoking, such as increased risk of heart attack, stroke
and many cancers. Nicotine is the main addictive
substance in smoking, but it is the other constituents that
cause the harms [1]. Nicotine is also used in nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT), which does not have the same
level of health risks associated with smoking. For example,
the Royal College of Physicians report [2] found no
increased risk of heart attack, stroke or death from using
NRT when attempting to quit smoking. The Lung Health
study [3], a 5-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
a 7.5-year follow-up, found no link between NRT and
cancers, whereas there was a relationship between
smoking and cancer. Electronic cigarettes (EC) can
also contain nicotine and are less harmful than smoking
[2,4–6]; however, there are many misperceptions in the
community concerning the level of harm presented by
nicotine, and the relative harm of smoking tobacco
cigarettes versus NRT and EC [4,5,7,8]. It is possible that
misperceptions of nicotine’s risks are underpinning harm
perceptions of NRT and EC, but evidence on this potential
association is lacking.

RESEARCH REPORT
doi:10.1111/add.14502
This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium,
provided the original work is properly cited.
 It is currently unclear how harm misperceptions of dif-
ferent products affect their use, as findings have been
mixed. Brose et al. [9] looked at harm perceptions of
EC among past-year smokers, and found that perceiving
EC to be less harmful predicted subsequent initiation of
EC use. However, Black et al. [10] did not find a link be-
tween accurate nicotine knowledge and NRT usage.
Both internationally and among adults and youth in
Great Britain, harm perceptions of nicotine and EC were
not improving over time [4,11–14]. The 2014 Tobacco
Products Directive (revised EU TPD) placed regulations
on EC, such as restricting nicotine concentration and
the size of tanks and refill bottles [4]. These regulations,
which became applicable in the UK between 20 May
2016 and 20 May 2017, could potentially influence
smokers into believing EC are more harmful than they
are, or could reassure smokers about the safety of the
EC products on the market after EU TPD implementation.
This makes current harm perceptions highly relevant to
investigate.
This study used a web-based national sample of past-
year smokers from the general population in the UK and
aimed to (1) assess nicotine knowledge and perceptions of
harm of EC and NRT relative to smoking, addictiveness of
EC relative to smoking and change in harm to user if
smoking replaced with EC; (2) associations of these percep-
tions with respondent characteristics including nicotine
knowledge; and (3) explore perceived main harms of EC
and whether these differ by vaping status.
METHODS
Participants and design
Data from a UK longitudinal online survey were used.
Members of an online panel managed by Ipsos MORI were
invited by e-mail to participate in a study about smoking
by Ipsos Interactive Services in return for points, which
could be redeemed as shopping vouchers or used to
enter prize draws. At baseline, of the 23785 invited
participants, 6165 were eligible to participate, being
past-year
smokers,
i.e.
reported
that
they
smoked
cigarettes (including hand-rolled) every day or some days,
smoked tobacco of some kind (e.g. pipe or cigar) or had
stopped smoking completely in the past year [15]. To
ensure representativeness of the British population, quotas
were imposed based on age, gender and region at
recruitment. In November and December 2012, 5000
participants completed the baseline/wave 1 survey, 2182
of the original participants completed the survey in wave
2 (December 2013) and 1519 in wave 3 (December
2014). In wave 4 (May/June 2016), the sample was
replenished using the same approach as for wave 1, with
quotas again imposed based on age, gender and region,
resulting in 3334 survey completions (n = 931 continuing
from wave 1 and n = 2403 newly recruited). At wave 5
(September 2017), 1720 participants completed the
survey. This current paper analyses data from wave 5.
Measures
Demographics
Demographic variables included gender (male or female)
and age. Smoking status (daily, non-daily, other tobacco,
recent quit, quit more than 1 year ago) was recoded into
daily smoker, non-daily smoker and ex-smoker. Vaping sta-
tus (daily, non-daily, only a few times, recent quit, quit
more than 1 year ago, never vaped) was recoded into daily
vaper, non-daily vaper, trier, ex-vaper and never vaped. In-
come was grouped as low (under £15 000), moderate
(£15001–30000), high (more than £30 000) or not
disclosed. The wording of the measures is provided in
Supplementary table 1.
Nicotine knowledge and harm perceptions of different products
Four items from the survey assessed relative harm percep-
tions of NRT, EC, nicotine and tobacco cigarettes, and two
items assessed nicotine knowledge. Binary recoding cate-
gories were selected in which one category was deigned ac-
curate based on the Royal College of Physician’s report on
tobacco harm reduction (2016).
Items for nicotine knowledge were:
• ‘
According to what you know or believe, what portion of
the health risks of smoking comes from nicotine in to-
bacco cigarettes?’ Response options were: ‘none or very
small; some but well under half the risk; around half
the risk; much more than half the risk; nearly all the risk;
don’t know’. This was recoded as a binary variable with
two levels: none or very small risk (the correct answer)
versus all other response options.
• ‘The nicotine in tobacco cigarettes is the chemical that
causes most of the cancer.’ Response options were ‘true’
or ‘false’. False was the correct answer.
Items for the relative harm perceptions of NRT, EC and to-
bacco cigarettes were:
• ‘Do you think electronic cigarettes/vaping devices are
more harmful than smoking tobacco cigarettes, less
harmful, or are they equally harmful to health?’ Re-
sponse options were: ‘more harmful than tobacco ciga-
rettes; equally harmful; less harmful than tobacco
cigarettes; don’t know’. This was dichotomized into ‘EC
are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes’ (correct an-
swer) versus all other responses.
• ‘Do you think nicotine replacement therapies such as
gumsor patches are more harmful than smokingtobacco
cigarettes, less harmful, or are they equally harmful?’ Re-
sponse options were the same as the previous item. This
was dichotomized as NRT is less harmful than tobacco
cigarettes (correct answer) versus all other categories.

 • ‘Do you think electronic cigarettes/vaping devices
(with nicotine) are more addictive than tobacco ciga-
rettes, less addictive, or are they equally addictive?’
Response options were: ‘more addictive than tobacco
cigarettes; equally addictive; less addictive than tobacco
cigarettes; don’t know’. This variable was dichotomized
as less addictive versus all other responses.
• ‘Now imagine a smoker who smokes 10 tobacco ciga-
rettes a day stops smoking tobacco cigarettes altogether
and continues to use electronic cigarettes or vaping de-
vices daily. How would that change any harm to their
health from smoking and vaping?’ Response options
were: ‘would reduce health harms a lot; would reduce
health harms a little; would not change harm at all;
would increase health harms a little; would increase
health harms a lot; don’t know’. This was dichotomized
as would reduce health harms a lot versus all other re-
sponse options.
Perceived main harms of EC
Participants were asked: ‘What in your view are the main
harms, if any, of EC/vaping devices?’, followed by 11 op-
tions with yes/no responses: ‘there are no harms; they
may be addictive; they may explode or catch fire; they
may cause breathing/respiratory problems; they may
cause cancer; there has not been enough research done
to understand all the possible harms; the chemicals in the
liquid might be harmful; the nicotine; there is not enough
quality control or regulation—you don’t know exactly
what chemicals they may contain; they reinforce the
smoking habit; they may cause heart disease’. These items
represented a summary of concerns provided by partici-
pants in wave 4 to an open response item which asked
about the main harms of EC/vaping devices.
Data analysis
Data were analysed using Stata version 15. The analyses
involved a cross-sectional design using wave 5 data. Alpha
was set at 0.05. An attrition analysis examined differences
between respondents followed-up at wave 5 versus those
from wave 4 lost to attrition using Pearson’s χ2 analyses.
Aim 1: Nicotine knowledge and relative harm perceptions
of EC, NRT and smoking
Frequencies to the responses to the two nicotine knowl-
edge items and the four harm perception items were
calculated.
Aim 2: Associations of relative harm perceptions with
respondent characteristics including nicotine knowledge
Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used
to assess associations between harm perception and
demographics, smoking and EC use status and nicotine
knowledge.
Results from multivariable analyses are reported in the
table, and where bivariate results markedly differed this is
noted in text.
Aim 3: Perceived main harms of EC
Frequencies of the 11 items on the perceived main harms
of EC were calculated, and a χ2 analysis was conducted to
compare whether these frequencies differed based on
vaping status. Adjusted standardized residuals (greater
than 2 and 3 standard deviations marked) were used to ex-
plore where these differences were among the vaping sta-
tus categories.
RESULTS
Demographics
Our sample had a mean age of 49.4 years; other demo-
graphic, smoking and vaping characteristics are described
in Table 1. Respondents followed-up at wave 5 versus those
lost to attrition were significantly more likely to be older
age groups (χ2
(5) = 184.56, P < 0.001), more likely to have
never vaped and less likely to have vaped only a few times
(χ2
(5) = 34.66, P < 0.001), less likely to be non-daily
smokers (χ2
(5) = 27.50, P < 0.001) and less likely to have
a high income (χ2
(3) = 17.10, P = 0.001). They did not differ
on gender.

 Nicotine knowledge
For the portion of health risk which comes from nicotine in
cigarettes, 11.2% responded none or very small, 24.5%
responded some but well under half, 21.8% responded ap-
proximately half the risk, 16.3% responded much more
than half the risk, 11.5% responded nearly all the risk
and 14.8% responded that they did not know. In adjusted
analyses, being aged 55–64 or 35–44 years (versus 65+)
and being a daily vaper or vaping trier (versus never vaper)
were associated with higher odds of responding that a very
small proportion of the health risk in cigarettes comes from
nicotine (Table 2).
When asked whether the nicotine in tobacco cigarettes
is the chemical that causes most of the cancer, 39.2%
responded true (the incorrect response) and 60.8%
responded false (the accurate response). In adjusted analy-
ses, being aged 45–54 years (versus 65+), a daily vaper or
vaping trier (versus never vaper) were significantly associ-
ated with higher odds of endorsing that nicotine in ciga-
rettes is not what causes most of the cancer (Table 2).
Relative harm perceptions and addictiveness perceptions of
EC, NRT and smoking, and associations with respondent
characteristics
For the relative harmfulness of EC and tobacco cigarettes,
3.3% responded that EC were more harmful than tobacco
cigarettes, 21.8% responded equally harmful, 57.3%
responded less harmful and 17.6% responded they did
not know. In the multivariable analysis, being in any of
the age groups between 25–54 was associated with lesser
odds, and being an ex-smoker or having ever vaped were
associated with greater odds for perceiving EC as less harm-
ful than tobacco cigarettes versus all the other responses
(Table 3). Bivariate analyses did not find a difference for
ages 35–54.
For the relative harm of NRT and tobacco cigarettes,
1.9% responded that NRT was more harmful than tobacco
cigarettes, 15.2% responded equally harmful, 63.4%
responded less harmful and 19.5% responded that they
did not know. In the multivariable analysis, being aged
25–34 years was associated with lower odds, whereas try-
ing vaping or having a high income were associated with
greater odds, of rating NRT as less harmful than tobacco
cigarettes versus all other outcomes (Table 3).
When asked about the relative addictiveness of EC com-
pared to tobacco cigarettes, 4.7% responded that EC are
more addictive, 49.0% responded equally addictive, 25.4%
responded less addictive and 20.9% responded that they
did not know. Being male, or having ever rather than never
vaped, were associated with higher odds of responding that
EC are less addictive than tobacco cigarettes versus all other
outcomes in adjusted analyses (Table 3).
For the change in harm of stopping tobacco cigarettes
and using EC instead, 32.2% responded that this would re-
duce health harms a great deal, 33.0% responded that this
would reduce health harms a little, 13.0% responded this
would not change harm at all, 2.8% responded this would
increase health harms a little, 1.5% responded this would
increasehealthharmsagreat dealand17.5%didnotknow.

reduce health harms a great if a smoker stopped smoking
cigarettes and started using EC instead (Table 3).
Accurate nicotine knowledge was associated with
greater odds of responding that: EC are less harmful than
tobacco cigarettes; NRT are less harmful than tobacco cig-
arettes; health harms would reduce a great deal if a smoker
stopped smoking and used EC instead. Accurate nicotine
knowledge was not significantly associated with the odds
of responding that EC are less addictive than tobacco ciga-
rettes (Table 3).
Perceived main harms of EC
The top five concerns for participants around EC (at least
one-third of the sample) were: ‘not enough research has
been done to understand all the possible harms’; ‘chemicals
in the liquid might be harmful’; ‘not enough qualitycontrol
or regulation, ‘you don’t know exactly what you are get-
ting’; ‘they may be addictive’; and ‘they may explode or
catch fire’ (Table 4).
Perceived main harms differed significantly by vaping
status for most items (Table 4). A lower percentage of
non-daily vapers endorsed that there had not been enough
research to understand all possible harms. There was a
lower percentage of daily and non-daily vapers who en-
dorsed that the chemicals in the liquid might be harmful;
there is not enough quality control or regulation; EC may
explode or catch fire; and EC may reinforce the smoking
habit. A higher percentage of triers endorsed that the
chemicals in the liquid might be harmful; not enough qual-
ity control or regulation; EC may explode or catch fire; and
EC may cause breathing or respiratory problems. A higher
percentage of never vapers endorsed that there is not
enough quality control or regulation; EC may explode or
catch fire; EC may reinforce the smoking habit; and EC
maycause cancer.Therewasnosignificant difference based
onvaping status to being concerned about nicotine, that EC
may be addictive or that they may cause heart disease.

 to smoking, addictiveness of EC relative to smoking and
change in harm to user if smoking was replaced with EC.
Relative harm misperceptions of EC, NRT and tobacco cig-
arettes were common, with only approximately half believ-
ing accurately that EC were less harmful and just fewer
than two-thirds believing accurately that NRT was less
harmful than tobacco smoking. Approximately a quarter
perceived EC as less addictive than cigarettes.
The second aim was to see the associations of these
perceptions with respondent characteristics, including
nicotine
knowledge.
Perceptions
mainly
differed
by
vaping status; those who had never vaped were more
likely to have misperceptions about the relative harm
of EC and NRT compared with tobacco cigarettes.
There was also some variation based on smoking status,
age, gender and income. Knowledge of nicotine was
poor: just fewer than nine of 10 smokers and ex-smokers
misattributed a greater portion of the risk in smoking to
nicotine, and nearly four of 10 wrongly believed that
nicotine is what causes cancer from smoking. Both
inaccuracies were more common in those who had never
vaped and those over 65 years. Inaccurate nicotine
knowledge was associated with greater misperceptions
of the relative harm of EC, NRT and tobacco cigarettes;
however, inaccurate nicotine knowledge was not associ-
ated with perceiving EC as less addictive relative to to-
bacco cigarettes.
The third aim of the study was to explore main con-
cerns around EC. The main perceived concerns around
EC were that more research, regulation and quality control
were needed on EC and concerns around chemicals in the
liquid. These concerns were more likely among those who
had never used EC, or only tried them, as opposed to daily
and non-daily vapers.
What the results add to the literature
The results provide greater detail on perceptions of rela-
tive harm and the correlates of harm perception among
a general population sample of UK smokers and ex-
smokers. Given that vaping status was associated with
harm perceptions, it is possible that those who do not
vape may not be using EC due to concerns about poten-
tial harms. This is in line with previous findings that
fewer concerns about EC harms predicted EC use [9],
and also supports previous research which found that
users of nicotine products such as EC and NRT are more
likely to correctly perceive relative harmfulness [7,9].
Alongside earlier data from the same longitudinal survey
[9], which showed a decline in the proportion perceiving
EC to be less harmful than cigarettes between 2012 and
2014, the present findings suggest that this trend of in-
creased misperception has continued. It is unclear
whether these misperceptions have been impacted by

 the revised EU TPD. This paper provides new information
about NRT perceptions which, despite being licensed
medications and being on the market for decades, are still
perceived by more than a third of smokers and ex-
smokers as not less harmful than cigarettes.
Findings on inaccurate nicotine knowledge were in line
with previous research, such as Siahpush et al. [8], who re-
ported inaccurate understanding around links between
nicotine and cancer. The results suggest that nicotine mis-
perceptions may be related to misperceptions concerning
the relative harmfulness of EC, NRT and smoking.
Correcting
misperceptions
concerning
nicotine
may
therefore help with understanding about the relative risks
of different nicotine delivery products. Addictiveness per-
ceptions of EC versus smoking were not, however, related
to inaccurate knowledge. Perceptions have not always
been found to be associated with usage [10], as there
may be a complex interplay at work between accurate
knowledge, harm perceptions and usage. Further research
should examine in detail beliefs concerning nicotine and
their role in harm perceptions.
Limitations
This study recruited individuals who smoke currently, or
used to smoke; it does not include the perspective of the
small group of those who vape but have never smoked
[4,5]. In addition, participants in this study may differ from
the general population of smokers, as those who self-select
into research may have different views to those who do not
choose to participate in research. Also, the relative harm
perception items do not differentiate between harm to the
smoker/ex-smoker and others around the individual. Fu-
ture research should consider the perspective of only-
vapers and differentiate harm perceptions to smokers, ex-
smokers and never-smokers in future research. In particu-
lar, this sample had more older participants and fewer
younger ones, so it would be useful to conduct further re-
search looking at the harm perceptions of younger smokers
and vapers. In addition, due to attrition, the sample may
not be representative; however, as it was a large sample,
there was still a good spread across gender, income,
smoking and vaping status. Despite adjustment for key

 variables, a potential for unmeasured confounding re-
mains, e.g. one variable which may reasonably be expected
to be associated with harm perception is experience of
smoking-related illness by the respondent themselves or
those close to them.
Implications
It would be useful to explore why these misperceptions
exist. This may be influenced by conflicting media reports
on the topic and prominent reporting of malfunctioning
devices,
while
fewer
headlines
are
made
by
the
aproximately 1500 people who die from smoking-related
illness every week in England alone [4]. It might also be
that the increasing pressure to regulate e-cigarettes may
be contributing to the perception that ‘they are more
harmful’.
Furthermore, while many participants had inaccurate
perceptions, a substantial number of participants replied
they did not know, highlighting the need for more educa-
tion and awareness. Misperceptions of the relative harms
of EC and NRT compared with smoking tobacco cigarettes
need to be targeted in public awareness campaigns and
policy. In particular, public awareness campaigns should
differentiate the role of smoke constituents other than nic-
otine in causing the main health harms (cancer, heart at-
tacks, stroke) from the role of nicotine in continuing the
addiction yet not having the same main health harms. Fu-
ture research should also explore change mechanisms in
harm perceptions to understand how to reverse the shifts
in harm perceptions, and move towards more accurate un-
derstanding in the community. Accurate understanding is
likely to assist smokers in making informed decisions
around smoking, EC use and NRT in the aim to reduce
health harms related to smoking tobacco cigarettes.
CONCLUSION
The relative harms of EC and NRTcompared to smoking to-
bacco cigarettes and the role of nicotine in the main health
harms of smoking were overestimated by large proportions
of smokers and ex-smokers. These misperceptions have
increased over time, and those who have never vaped are
more likely to have misperceptions about relative harmful-
ness. Inaccurate nicotine knowledge was associated with
increased relative harm misperceptions of EC and NRT
compared to tobacco cigarettes.
