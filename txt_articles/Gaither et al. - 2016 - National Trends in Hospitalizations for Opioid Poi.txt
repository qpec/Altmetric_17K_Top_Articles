IMPORTANCE National data show a parallel relationship between recent trends in opioid
prescribing practices and hospitalizations for opioid poisonings in adults. No similar estimates
exist describing hospitalizations for opioid poisonings in children and adolescents.
OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence and characteristics of hospitalizations attributed to
opioid poisonings in children and adolescents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of serial cross-sectional data
from a nationally representative sample of US pediatric hospital discharge records collected
every 3 years from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2012. The Kids’ Inpatient Database
was used to identify 13 052 discharge records for patients aged 1 to 19 years who were
hospitalized for opioid poisonings. Data were analyzed within the collection time frame.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Poisonings attributed to prescription opioids were
identified by codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification. In adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, poisonings attributed to heroin were also
identified. Census estimates were used to calculate incidence per 100 000 population. The
Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to assess for changes in incidence over time.
RESULTS From 1997 to 2012, a total of 13 052 (95% CI, 12 500-13 604) hospitalizations for
prescription opioid poisonings were identified. The annual incidence of hospitalizations for
opioid poisonings per 100 000 children aged 1 to 19 years rose from 1.40 (95% CI, 1.24-1.56)
to 3.71 (95% CI, 3.44-3.98), an increase of 165% (P for trend, <.001). Among children 1 to 4
years of age, the incidence increased from 0.86 (95% CI, 0.60-1.12) to 2.62 (95% CI,
2.17-3.08), an increase of 205% (P for trend, <.001). For adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, the
incidence increased from 3.69 (95% CI, 3.20-4.17) to 10.17 (95% CI, 9.48-10.85), an increase
of 176% (P for trend, <.001). In this age group, poisonings from heroin increased from 0.96
(95% CI, 0.75-1.18) to 2.51 (95% CI, 2.21-2.80), an increase of 161% (P for trend, <.001);
poisonings involving methadone increased from 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.16) to 1.05 (95% CI,
0.87-1.23), an increase of 950% (P for trend, <.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE During the course of 16 years, hospitalizations attributed to
opioid poisonings rose nearly 2-fold in the pediatric population. Hospitalizations increased
across all age groups, yet young children and older adolescents were most vulnerable to the
risks of opioid exposure. Mitigating these risks will require comprehensive strategies that
target opioid storage, packaging, and misuse.

P
oisonings attributed to prescription drugs are now the
leading cause of injury-related mortality in the United
States1,2; this epidemic is driven by the increased use
ofopioidanalgesicstotreatchronicpain.3-6From1999to2010,
retailsalesofprescriptionopioidsquadrupled,4andduringthis
time, deaths attributed to opioid overdose rose 4-fold in those
15 to 64 years of age and 6-fold in those 15 to 24 years of age.7
In 2014 alone, opioids were blamed for 18 893 deaths in the
United States.8
These mortality data, however, represent only a fraction
of the serious adverse events attributed to prescription
opioids.5,9-16 The increased availability of these medications
has resulted in an unprecedented rise in opioid addiction and
nonfataloverdoses.5Emergencydepartment(ED)visitsforopi-
oid-related indications have risen substantially in children and
adults during the past 2 decades; ED visits for prescription opi-
oidoverdose,abuse,andmisusenowrivalthoseforillicitdrugs,
including heroin and cocaine.17-21 Even in children younger
than6years,opioids,followedcloselybybenzodiazepines,now
account for most of the drug poisonings in this age group18;
in nearly all these poisonings, the child was exposed to a pre-
scription intended for an adult in the household.22

year for opioid poisonings and how hospitalization rates have
changedovertimeremainunknown.Inyoungadultsandthose

related indications, such as for opioid dependence, abuse, and

Fromanationaldatabaseofpediatrichospitalizations,weiden-
tifiedchildrenandadolescentsadmittedtoUShospitalsforopi-
oid poisonings in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012. We
conductedaretrospectiveanalysisofserialcross-sectionaldata
abstracted from the Kids’Inpatient Database (KID).32 The KID,
createdbytheAgencyforHealthcareResearchandQualityaspart

tabase to provide all-payer data on pediatric services and clini-
cal outcomes for children admitted as inpatients, routinely or
through the ED.32,33 This study involved deidentified data and
was determined to be exempt from approval and the need for
informedconsentbytheYaleSchoolofMedicine’

The KID has been released every 3 years since 1997 and is
compiled from a random sample of pediatric discharge records

Identification of the Sample
We identified hospitalizations attributed to opioid poison-
ings using diagnostic codes from the International Classifica-
tion of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM).34 Admissions for prescription opioid poisonings
were identified by the following ICD-9-CM poisoning codes:
965.00 (opium), 965.02 (methadone), and 965.09 (other opi-
ates and narcotics). Among those 15 to 19 years of age, we also
identified admissions for illicit opioid poisonings using the
ICD-9-CM code 965.01 (heroin). We restricted the heroin and
methadoneanalysestothose15to19yearsofagebecausemost
of these poisonings occurred in this age group.
To further characterize poisonings, we used E codes for ex-
ternal causes of injury to establish intent. These codes in-
cludedE850.xtoE858.x(unintentional[ie,accidental]),E950.0
toE950.5(intentional[ie,suicideorself-inflicted]),andE980.x
(undetermined).
Key Points
Question How has the prescription opioid epidemic affected
pediatric hospitalization rates in the United States?
Findings This retrospective analysis of 13 052 national hospital
discharge records found that pediatric hospitalizations for opioid
poisonings increased nearly 2-fold from 1997 to 2012.
Hospitalization rates were highest in older adolescents, but the
largest percentage increase in hospitalizations over time occurred
among the youngest children (toddlers and preschoolers).
Meaning Reducing pediatric opioid exposure and misuse will
require a combination of public health interventions, policy
initiatives, and consumer-product regulations.

We restricted the sample to those 1 to 19 (inclusive) years
of age. Infants were excluded to primarily capture those poi-
sonings related to self-administration. To be consistent with
the age categories used by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention WISQARS (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and
Reporting System) for reporting fatal and nonfatal injuries,35
we grouped children into the following age categories: 1 to 4,
5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 19 years. The estimates for those aged
5 to 9 years (n = 135, unweighted), however, did not meet the
criteria36 for statistical reliability, and thus are not shown.
Statistical Analysis
Data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 1997, to De-
cember 31, 2012. Descriptive statistics were used to charac-
terize the sample according to each year of the KID. Differ-
ences according to demographic and clinical characteristics
were assessed with χ2 tests for categorical variables and, as ap-
propriate,2-tailedttests,analysisofvariance,orWilcoxonrank
sum tests for continuous variables.
Nationally representative estimates were calculated using
methodsthattakeintoaccountthecomplexsurveydesignofthe
KID. Specifically, we used weights, strata, and cluster variables
provided by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project to pro-
duce weighted estimates and SEs, which were then used to es-
tablish95%CIs.37Unlessotherwisenoted,allcounts,proportions,
and incidence rates are based on weighted estimates.
To calculate the annual incidence of hospitalizations, we
dividedtheweightednumberofhospitalizationsforopioidpoi-
sonings for a given year by the intercensal number of chil-
drenatriskinthatyear.38TheCochran-Armitagetestfortrend39
was used to assess changes in incidence over time.
All analyses were performed using SAS software (version
9.3; SAS Institute Inc). We applied a 2-sided statistical signifi-
cance level of .05 to all analyses.
Results
Demographic Characteristics
Among children and adolescents aged 1 to 19 years admitted
to US hospitals every 3 years from 1997 through 2012, we iden-
tified a total of 13 052 (95% CI, 12 500-13 604) hospitaliza-
tions for prescription opioid poisonings. Demographic char-
acteristics for each of the 6 assessment periods are shown in
the Table. Those in the oldest group accounted for the largest
proportion of poisonings, whereas those aged 5 to 9 years ac-
counted for the smallest. In 1997, males accounted for 34.7%
(95% CI, 31%-39%) of hospitalizations; by 2012, this propor-
tion was 47.4% (95% CI, 45%-50%). Children were predomi-
nately white (73.5%; 95% CI, 72%-75%) and covered by pri-
vate insurance (48.8%; 95% CI, 48%-50%); however, the
proportion insured by Medicaid increased from 24.1% (95% CI,
20%-28%) in 1997 to 44.0% (95% CI, 42%-46%) in 2012 (P for
trend, <.001). Across the 6 years of the KID, 176 children (1.3%;
95% CI, 1.1%-1.6%) died during hospitalization (in compli-
ance with Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project privacy pro-
tections, we do not present these data stratified by year be-
cause of small cell frequencies).

(P for trend, <.001). As shown in Figure 1 and eTable 1 in the
Supplement, when examined by age category, the greatest
change occurred among the group aged 1 to 4 years, among
whom the incidence rose from 0.86 (95% CI, 0.60-1.12) in 1997
to 2.62 (95% CI, 2.17-3.08) in 2012, an increase of 205% (P for

dence rose from 3.69 (95% CI, 3.20-4.17) in 1997 to 10.17 (95%
CI, 9.48-10.85) in 2012, an increase of 176% (P for trend, <.001).
When prescription opioid poisonings were examined by
intent, among children younger than 10 years, 16 poisonings
(0.92%;95%CI,0.37%-1.47%)wereattributedtosuicideorself-

age, the incidence of poisonings attributed to suicide or self-
inflictedinjuryincreasedfrom0.62(95%CI,0.44-0.79)in1997
to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.68-1.02) in 2012, an increase of 37% (P for

dental intent increased from 0.17 (95% CI, −0.04 to 0.39) in
1997 to 0.31 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.42) in 2012, an increase of 82%
(P for trend, <.001).
These trends were more marked in adolescents 15 to 19
years of age. Poisonings attributed to suicide or self-inflicted
injury increased by 140% (P for trend, <.001), whereas those
attributed to accidental intent increased 303% (P for trend,

Discussion
Using a nationally representative sample of pediatric hospital
discharge records, we found that the incidence of hospitaliza-
tions for prescription opioid poisonings among children and
adolescents 1 to 19 years of age increased nearly 2-fold from
1997 to 2012. Although rates increased across all age groups,
the largest percentage increase occurred among the youngest
children aged 1 to 4 years. The second largest increase oc-
curred among adolescents 15 to 19 years of age, among whom
hospitalizations for prescription opioid and heroin poisoning
increased. Adolescents in this age group had the highest inci-
dence overall for each of the 6 years examined.
In contrast to poisoning intent in younger children, poi-
sonings in those older than 10 years were primarily attributed
tosuicideorself-inflictedinjury.Duringthe16-yearperiod,poi-
sonings attributed to suicide or self-inflicted injury among
those aged 15 to 19 years increased by 140%. These data un-
derscore the dangers associated with the widespread avail-
ability of prescription opioids, particularly for adolescents at
risk for depression (many adolescents are also thought to self-
medicate with prescription opioids).16,40
Although poisonings attributed to suicide or self-inflicted
injury among those aged 15 to 19 years exceeded those attrib-
uted to accidental poisonings across all time points, acciden-
tal poisonings increased at a more rapid rate, 3-fold from 1997
to 2012. Increasing rates of prescription opioid misuse and
abuse, rather than therapeutic errors or adverse effects among
adolescentsprescribedopioidsforpainmanagement,arelikely
driving these trends in accidental poisonings.19
Mirroringdemographictrendsseeninadults,23,24wefound
that approximately three-quarters of hospitalizations oc-
curred in white individuals. Similarly, private insurers were
found to be the largest payer. However, the percentage of hos-
pitalizations covered by private payers decreased over time,
whereas the percentage paid by Medicaid increased. In 2012,
Medicaid covered 44.0% of hospitalizations for pediatric opi-
oid poisonings, up from 24.1% in 1997. This change may re-
flect trends in Medicaid payments for all hospitalizations; from
1997 to 2011, the percentage of hospitalizations where Med-
icaid was the primary payer increased by 34%.41 This in-
crease, however, has largely been attributed to a rise in hos-
pitalizations for a small number of conditions. Thus, the shift
over time in payers for opioid hospitalizations may instead be
indicative of the widening effect of opioid use across sociode-
mographic groups.
This study—to our knowledge, the first to extensively ex-
amine pediatric hospitalizations due to opioid poisonings—
contributes to a broader understanding of the public health cri-
sis caused by the now widespread availability of prescription
opioids in the United States. Our findings are consistent with
previous research demonstrating that as physicians have in-
creasingly relied on prescription opioids to treat chronic pain
duringthepast2decades,ratesforopioidpoisoningshaverisen
in tandem.1-4,9 For young children, calls to poisoning control
centers for opioid ingestion have increased markedly in re-
cent years,19,20,22 as have ED visits across all age groups.17-21
In addition, a number of studies have examined trends in ED
visits and subsequent hospitalizations for pharmaceutical poi-
sonings and found that prescription opioids were among the
most commonly implicated medications and that these poi-
sonings frequently resulted in hospital admission.17,19,20
Emerging data suggest that in recent years physicians have
been prescribing opioids less frequently. From 2011 to 2013,
the number of opioid prescriptions dispensed in the United
States slightly decreased.25,42 Our data show a similar mar-
ginal decrease in the overall incidence of hospitalizations for
prescriptionopioidpoisoningsfrom2009to2012.Thischange,
however, was driven entirely by a slight (7%) but statistically
significant decrease in hospitalizations among those aged 15
to 19 years. In contrast, in this age group, hospitalizations in-
volving heroin overdose continued to rise. This finding is con-
sistent with research suggesting that prescription opioid abuse
may be a precursor to initiation of heroin use,3,25-28 which can
be explained in part by the low cost of heroin compared with
opioid analgesics such as oxycodone.26-28

prescription opioid abuse, misuse, and diversion for nonmedi-
cal use have plateaued or decreased in the general adult
population.43 Declining rates for abuse and diversion have also
been seen among those aged 12 to 17 years.44
Nonmedical use of prescription opioids, nevertheless, re-
mains a substantial problem, particularly for adolescents. In 1
study,44,45nearly10%ofhighschoolseniorsreportedusingopi-
oids nonmedically. Although most acquired these medications
from family and friends, the source for nearly 40% of students
was their own prior prescription.46 This information is in keep-
ingwithfindingsthatadolescentsarefrequentlyprescribedopi-
oids for common injury- and non–injury-related indications.46
ArecentstudyofambulatorycarevisitsintheUnitedStates,for
example,reportsthatfrom2005to2007,opioidswereprescribed
at22%ofvisitsamongadolescentspresentingwithbackpain.47
A separate study of commercial medical and pharmacy claims
data from 2007 to 2008 found that nearly 50% of patients aged
13to17yearspresentingwithfirst-timecomplaintsofheadache

nearlyone-thirdreceived3ormoreprescriptions.31Ofnote,the
USFoodandDrugAdministrationrecentlyextendedtheoff-label
use of oxycodone for children as young as 11 years with certain
types of intractable pain—namely cancer pain.48 Despite these
trends,however,thenewnationalopioidprescribingguidelines49

recommendations for patients younger than 18 years.50
Limitations
This study has at least 4 limitations. The major limitation is
thatthenationalestimatesarebasedonICD-9-CMcodes,which
are subject to miscoding and errors of omission. Although lim-
ited data are available regarding the accuracy of opioid poi-
soning codes, validation studies involving other common pe-
diatric medications (eg, acetaminophen) support the use of
ICD-9-CM codes for identifying poisonings in children.51
Second, we were unable to provide a full clinical picture or psy-
chosocial profile (eg, the circumstances that led to the poison-
ing) of the children admitted for opioid poisonings or to vali-
date the poisoning codes with toxicologic results. Similarly, we
were not able to distinguish between opioids prescribed for
chronic pain and those, such as buprenorphine hydrochlo-
ride and methadone, prescribed for opioid dependence (ie,
methadonemaintenancetreatment).Third,eachrecordwithin
the KID represents a hospitalization; thus, children admitted
within a given year for 1 or more repeated opioid poisonings
would be counted multiple times. We believe, however, that
this limitation is minor because such instances are likely rare.
Finally, similar to other recent studies17,19,20 examining trends
in opioid poisonings in the young, we lacked the data to de-
termine whether the trends we report continued beyond 2012.
Conclusions
The current public health crisis caused by prescription opi-
oids is a systemic issue that affects individuals across the age
spectrum. To date, numerous initiatives at the local, state, and
federal levels have been implemented to combat prescrip-
tion opioid poisonings and overdose; most of these efforts,
however, have focused on modifying physician prescribing
practices for those treating adults with chronic pain.52 The full
effect of these initiatives remains to be seen, but recent data
indicate that the United States is making progress in gaining
control of the epidemic caused by opioid analgesics.3
Ourresearch,however,suggeststhatpoisoningsbyprescrip-
tionandillicitopioidsarelikelytoremainapersistentandgrow-
ingproblemintheyoungunlessgreaterattentionisdirectedto-
wardthepediatriccommunity,whomakeupnearlyone-quarter
of the US population. A combination of public health interven-
tions(eg,parentaleducation),policyinitiatives,andconsumer-
product regulations is needed to reduce pediatric exposure to
opioids.50,52Inaddition,furtherresourcesshouldbedirectedto-
ward addressing opioid misuse and abuse during adolescence.
Of particular importance are prevention programs that address
