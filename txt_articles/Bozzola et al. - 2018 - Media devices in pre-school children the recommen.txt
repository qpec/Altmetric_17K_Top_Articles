Abstract
Background: Young children are too often exposed to mobile devices (MD) and most of them had their own
device. The adverse effects of a early and prolonged exposure to digital technology on pre-school children has
been described by several studies.
Aim of the study is to analyze the consequences of MD exposure in pre-school children.
Methods: We analyzed the documented effects of media exposure on children’s mental and physical health.
Results: According to recent studies, MD may interfere with learning, children development, well being, sleep,
sight, listening, caregiver-child relationship.
Discussion: Pediatricians should be aware of both the beneficial and side effects of MD and give advice to the
families, according to children’s age.
Conclusion: In according to literature, the Italian Pediatric Society suggest that the media device exposure in
childhood should be modulated by supervisors.
Background
Technology progress is leading to an increase of media
use including broadcast and interactive media among
people, from toddlers to adults. In particular, broadcast
media include television and movies while interactive
ones include social media and video games.
Nowadays, even pre-school children are growing up in
environments satured with internet, computer and video
games that strongly catch their attention.
According to an American survey, the percentage of
children aged 0–8 years using a mobile device increased
from 38% in 2011 to 72% in 2013. Focusing on 2 years
old children the increment was even higher, moving
from 10% in 2011 to 38% in 2013 [1].
Smartphones and tablets are the most frequently used
device (51 and 44% respectively).
The mobile app used (educational games and creative
apps) has been also documented. Fully half (50%) of all
children ages 0 to 8 have used mobile apps, up from just
16% in 2011. In particular, these devices are used even by
younger kids. In fact, 13% of children younger than 1 year
used educational games and 19% creative apps [1].
A cross-sectional study on technology habits of 350
children aged 6 months- 4 years produced similar results.
In details, almost all children (96.6%) used mobile devices
(MD). Most of kids (92,2%) started using a mobile media
device before the age of 1 year. And at the age of 2 years,
most children used a device daily [2].
The adverse effects of a early and prolonged exposure
to digital technology on pre-school children has been
described by several studies [3–5].
Among the side effects, the most reported are interfer-
ences on neurocognitive development, learning, well-being,
sight and listening, metabolic and cardiological functions.
Recent studies have demonstrated that parental mobile
devices
usage
influences
child
safety,
emotional
well-being
and
family
interactions.

 distract parents-children dyad from face-to-face interac-
tions, having a great impact in cognitive, language, and
emotional development [6].
Moreover, MD may be used to placate or distract chil-
dren or as means to manage children’s behavior. Studies
revealed that parents often give children devices when
doing house chores, to keep them calm in public places,
during meals and/or at bedtime to put their child to
sleep [2, 7, 8].
Pre-school children have often at least one screen-based
electronic device in their own bedroom [9].
In Italy, few data are available on media use in children.
A recent survey described that 20% of children used a
smartphone for the first time during his first year of life.
Moreover, 80% of children from 3 to 5 years old is able to
use their parent’s smartphone. In addition, parents often
use media as pacifiers, giving mobile devices to their child
to keep them calm during the first (30%) and the second
(70%) year of life [10].
Aim
Aim of the study is to analyze the evidences of MD in
pre-school children.
Methods
For the purpose of the study, we investigated both bene-
ficial and negative effects of media on children’s mental
and physical health in order to discuss age-appropriate
child’s exposure to media.
Results
Learning
According to recent studies, touch screen usage may
interfere with infant and toddler learning development.
In fact, young children need direct first-hand experience
with materials and equipment that challenge their think-
ing and problem solving skills. Moreover, no substitute
for direct interaction with parents has been found [11].
On the other hand, children younger than 3 years old
can learn words through video if specific conditions are
fulfilled. In details, children would be able to learn from
video when the experimenter/parent/caregiver provide
additional verbal and non-verbal information during the
live action sequences [12]. In particular, speaker’s eye
gaze is an important communicative signal of non-verbal
caregiver-children interaction [13].
Mobile phones could be a tool to reinforce what chil-
dren are already learning at school. In particular, using
well-designed educational apps promote learning among
preschool and early-elementary-aged children [14]. Un-
fortunately, most of the downloaded apps are not de-
signed for a dual audience (both parent and child),
targets only rote academy skills and are not based on
established criteria from developmental specialist or
educators.
Better policies for the evaluation of content in various
app stores could be a means to create high quality edu-
cational apps for kids [14].
Development
Children’s development is also influenced by background
television: it has been proven to have negative effects in
young children’s brain development, reducing the amount
and quality of parents-children dyad interactions [5].
As reported by Pagani et al. high rates of screen time
are related to decrements in math and attention scores
but also to peer rejection experiences [4].
Drawing is an activity that allows child thinking and
creation of his own prospective of things [15, 16]. In this
context, drawing apps can play a positive role in child
development [17]. Drawing apps can be used as a sup-
plement to traditional crayons and chalk as they are safe
and easily to use [18].
Media devices use has been associated to task ineffi-
ciency, loss of attention, and safety hazards [3]. Thus,
media use by children and toddlers could have positive
effects only with right contents and parents’ interaction
presence [19].
Well-being
Electronic media use during early childhood for more
than 2 h per day has been linked to increased weight sta-
tus and to behavioral problems. In particular, well-being
can be conceptualized as constituting positive and ad-
verse psychological and social attributes and behaviors.
Poor levels of well-being during early childhood are as-
sociated with later outcomes, such as depression and
hostile and aggressive behavior [20]. Television viewing
and videogames are related to increased rates of obesity,
sedentary behaviors during childhood and wrong dietary
behaviors [21].
Some evidence suggested that there is an association
between physical discomfort and tablets usage, especially
involving neck and shoulders. In particular, children as
young as 8 years old are being treated for headaches,
neck and shoulder pain and poor posture as they spend
more time with screens, including mobile phones. The
Australian
Physiotherapists
Association
agreed
that
there is an emerging of physical problems among chil-
dren related to an abuse of media usage: the right bal-
ance between screen time and physical activity should
be obtained [22].
Sleep
Media usage may interfere with sleep quality through
the increase of psychophysiological arousal caused by
stimulating content watched, or through bright light
Bozzola et al. Italian Journal of Pediatrics  (2018) 44:69 
Page 2 of 5
 exposure [23]. Bright light may impact sleep by delaying
the circadian rhythm when exposure takes place in the
evening and also by causing an immediate activation in
itself [24, 25]. According to the model exposed, sleep
may also be negatively impacted by electromagnetic ra-
diation [23]. Another mechanism relates to physical dis-
comfort, such as muscular pain and headache, caused by
prolonged media use and inappropriate neck posture
during activities such as game playing [26]. Furthermore,
screen use over two hours per day is significantly associ-
ated with long sleep onset latency especially in children
that use more devices at the same time compared with
those using only one device [27].
A recent study, conclude that among children aged be-
tween 1 to 4 years old, the presence of a television in the
bedroom is associated with significantly reduced sleep
quality, sleep terrors, nightmares, and sleep talking [28].
Sight
A reduced blink rate during continuous smartphone use
causes faster evaporation of the tear film, which may
then lead to dry eye disease. Moreover, smartphones are
used with short watching distances due to their small
LED screens, thus inducing ocular fatigue, glare, and ir-
ritation [29].
Excessive smartphone use at a close reading distance
might influence the development of a condition called
acute acquired comitant exotropia that is an unusual
presentation of exotropia in older children. It can poten-
tially be induced by an increased tonus of medial rectus
muscles resulting from disrupted accommodation and
vergence by video Display work. In these cases, avoid
smartphone usage can decrease the amount of esodeviation
leading to successful management of residual exotropia and
restoration of binocularity [30].
Listening
The early and prolonged exposition of eardrums to in-
tense levels leads to a dangerous sound immersion with-
out a break period for ears. In fact, in this context,
speech and language development may be compromised.
Difficulties in socializing, communicating and interacting
with other kids may be possible side effects [31].
Caregiver-child interaction
Early and adequate children-caregivers interactions con-
tribute to behavioral and neurocognitive system develop-
ment. Eye contact, mutual gaze, or joint visual attention
between children and caregivers during emotionally
charged discussion are related to autonomous regulation
and development of healthy attachment relationships
[32]. Media use causes fewer verbal and nonverbal inter-
actions between parents and children dyad, parent-child
conflict oppositional defiant disorder and callous un-
emotional behaviors [32–34].
In this scenario, parents’ background television and
mobile devices usage, distracts from parent–child inter-
actions, child play and may affect child cognitive devel-
opment and concentration [5, 35].
Discussion
Pediatricians have an important role in advising the expos-
ure to MD in childhood. Nevertheless, according to a re-
cent study, only 16% of pediatricians ask families about
their media use and only about 29% of parents report rely-
ing on their pediatrician for advice about media [36].
On the contrary, pediatricians should explain to fam-
ilies both the beneficial and side effects of mobile device
according to children’s age. Devices can be used for enter-
tainment, social support, or access to educational materials
for children but they may cause side effects when not well
used.
Pediatricians
should
discuss
with
parents
about
healthy consequences related to MD usage such as inad-
equate sleep, reduced physical activity, parents-child
interaction, brain development. In particular, pediatri-
cians have a key role in educating parents about the im-
portance of hands-on, unstructured, and social play to
build language, cognitive, and social-emotional skills,
identifying areas in which good health and wellness can
be enhanced. Therefore, help parents in facing challenges,
such as setting limits and finding alternate activities to
calm their children.
Pediatrician and families should create a network to
manage the digital landscape involving their children.
Conclusion
In conclusion, in according to the American Academy of
Pediatrics and with the Australian guidelines we suggest
that the media device exposure in childhood should be
modulated on the basis of the clinical evidence [3, 9].
In details:
a) we recommend no media devices use:
– in children under 2 years of age
– during meals
– at least for 1 h before bedtime
– in case of fast-paced programs, apps with distracting
or violent content
– as a limit pacifier, to keep children quiet in public
places.
b) we suggest to limit media exposure:
– to less than 1 h per day in children aged 2–5 years,
– to less than 2 h per day in children aged 5–8 years
Bozzola et al. Italian Journal of Pediatrics  (2018) 44:69

 – to high-quality programming
– just in presence of an adult. Children should share
the use of media devices with caregiver in order to
promote child’s learning and interactions. In a world
where children are “growing up digital”, parents play
an important role in teaching them how to use
technology safely. Families should monitor children’s
media content and apps used or downloaded.
– to apps tested by a care-giver before the child usage.
More than 80,000 apps are labeled as educational,
but few researches have demonstrated their actual
quality. Parents should check age-appropriate apps,
games and programs to make the best choices for
their children. To make sure of the quality of media
used, parents can consult with pediatricians on what
kids are viewing and about any issues associated
with media
Finally, pediatricians must remember to families that
parents should be a good role model: children are great
mimics. For this reason, parents have to limit their own
media use. A more connection with children will be ob-
tained interacting, hugging and playing with them rather
than using media. Families don’t have to use media as an
emotional pacifier because it will limit children develop-
ment of his own emotion regulation.
Parents and children proactive interaction is likely the
best approach.
