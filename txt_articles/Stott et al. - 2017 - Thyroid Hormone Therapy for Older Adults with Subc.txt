BACKGROUND
The use of levothyroxine to treat subclinical hypothyroidism is controversial. We 
aimed to determine whether levothyroxine provided clinical benefits in older persons 
with this condition.
METHODS
We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial 
involving 737 adults who were at least 65 years of age and who had persisting sub-
clinical hypothyroidism (thyrotropin level, 4.60 to 19.99 mIU per liter; free thyroxine 
level within the reference range). A total of 368 patients were assigned to receive le-
vothyroxine (at a starting dose of 50 μg daily, or 25 μg if the body weight was <50 kg 
or the patient had coronary heart disease), with dose adjustment according to the 
thyrotropin level; 369 patients were assigned to receive placebo with mock dose ad-
justment. The two primary outcomes were the change in the Hypothyroid Symptoms 
score and Tiredness score on a thyroid-related quality-of-life questionnaire at 1 year 
(range of each scale is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms or 
tiredness, respectively; minimum clinically important difference, 9 points).
RESULTS
The mean age of the patients was 74.4 years, and 396 patients (53.7%) were women. 
The mean (±SD) thyrotropin level was 6.40±2.01 mIU per liter at baseline; at 1 year, 
this level had decreased to 5.48 mIU per liter in the placebo group, as compared with 
3.63 mIU per liter in the levothyroxine group (P<0.001), at a median dose of 50 μg. 
We found no differences in the mean change at 1 year in the Hypothyroid Symptoms 
score (0.2±15.3 in the placebo group and 0.2±14.4 in the levothyroxine group; be-
tween-group difference, 0.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.0 to 2.1) or the Tired-
ness score (3.2±17.7 and 3.8±18.4, respectively; between-group difference, 0.4; 95% 
CI, −2.1 to 2.9). No beneficial effects of levothyroxine were seen on secondary-out-
come measures. There was no significant excess of serious adverse events prespeci-
fied as being of special interest.
CONCLUSIONS
Levothyroxine provided no apparent benefits in older persons with subclinical hypo-
thyroidism. (Funded by European Union FP7 and others; TRUST ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT01660126.)

ubclinical hypothyroidism is de-
fined as an elevated serum thyrotropin level 
and a serum free thyroxine level within the 
reference range.1 Between 8% and 18% of adults 
65 years of age or older have these biochemical 
features, and the prevalence is higher among 
women than among men.2
Subclinical hypothyroidism is a possible con-
tributor to many problems in older persons. 
Thyroid hormones have multiple effects, since 
they act as an essential regulatory factor in nu-
merous physiological systems, including the vas-
cular tree and the heart,3 the brain (including 
cognition),4 skeletal muscle, and bone.5 Tired-
ness is the most important symptom of overt 
hypothyroidism,6 but most patients with sub-
clinical hypothyroidism have no symptoms or 
have nonspecific symptoms.7 There is a convinc-
ing epidemiologic association with subsequent 
coronary heart disease.8
Randomized, controlled trials of levothyrox-
ine replacement for the treatment of subclinical 
hypothyroidism have been small9,10 and have 
yielded only limited evidence regarding the pos-
sible benefits and risks of treatment.1 We aimed 
to determine whether there are clinical benefits 
from levothyroxine replacement in older persons 
with subclinical hypothyroidism.
Methods
Trial Overview
The trial protocol, which was published previ-
ously11 and is available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org, was approved by the relevant 
ethics committees and regulatory authorities in 
all the countries involved in the trial. Participants 
provided written informed consent.
The trial was conducted in accordance with 
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki12 
and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.13 The 
Robertson Centre for Biostatistics at the Univer-
sity of Glasgow was the trial data and biostatis-
tics center.
The European Union FP7 provided primary 
financial support for the conduct of the trial. 
Supplies of levothyroxine and matching placebo 
were provided free of charge by Merck (Darm-
stadt, Germany). The funder, the trial sponsors 
(NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board 
and University of Glasgow, United Kingdom; Uni-
versity College Cork, Ireland; Leiden University 
Medical Center, the Netherlands; and University 
of Bern and Bern University Hospital, Switzer-
land), and Merck played no role in the design, 
analysis, or reporting of the trial. The main 
sponsor (NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health 
Board) contributed to the writing of the protocol. 
None of the sponsors had any involvement in the 
analysis or the reporting of the results. The au-
thors vouch for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and analyses reported and for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Participants
Participants were identified from clinical labora-
tory and general practice databases and records. 
The inclusion criteria were an age of 65 years or 
more and persistent subclinical hypothyroidism, 
defined as an elevated thyrotropin level (4.60 to 
19.99 mIU per liter) that was measured on at least 
two occasions that were 3 months to 3 years 
apart, with the free thyroxine level within the 
reference range. The main exclusion criteria for 
the trial were a current prescription for levothy-
roxine, antithyroid drugs, amiodarone, or lithium; 
thyroid surgery or receipt of radioactive iodine 
within the previous 12 months; dementia; hos-
pitalization for a major illness or an elective sur-
gery within the previous 4 weeks; an acute coro-
nary syndrome (including myocardial infarction 
or unstable angina) within the previous 4 weeks; 
and terminal illness.11
Trial Design and Regimen
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, par-
allel-group trial of levothyroxine versus placebo. 
Patients underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio, 
with stratification according to country, sex, and 
starting dose, with the use of randomly permuted 
blocks.
The active intervention started with levothy-
roxine at a dose of 50 μg daily (or 25 μg in pa-
tients with a body weight of <50 kg or with 
known coronary heart disease [previous myocar-
dial infarction or symptoms of angina pectoris]) 
or matching placebo. Dose adjustment in the levo-
thyroxine group was aimed to result in a thyro-
tropin level within the reference range (0.40 to 
4.59 mIU per liter). Details regarding how the 
dose was adjusted and the mock adjustment in 
the placebo group are provided in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. All dose 
adjustments were generated and executed by 
means of computer without the intervention of 
a physician. The participants, investigators, and

Thyroid Hormone in Subclinical Hypothyroidism
treating physicians were unaware of the results 
of thyrotropin measurements throughout the 
course of the trial.
Procedures and Outcomes
The two primary outcomes for the trial were the 
change from baseline to 12 months in the Thyroid-
Related Quality-of-Life Patient-Reported Outcome 
measure (ThyPRO) Hypothyroid Symptoms score 
(4 items) and Tiredness score (7 items); each 
scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores 
indicating more symptoms and tiredness, respec-
tively.14 A recent systematic review recommended 
ThyPRO as the preferred measurement tool for 
the assessment of health-related quality of life 
in patients with benign thyroid disease.15 The 
ThyPRO and other instruments were adminis-
tered in English, French, German, or Dutch as 
appropriate. We had initially planned for cardio-
vascular events and thyroid-specific quality of life 
to be the two primary outcomes. However, this 
plan was modified during the trial to thyroid-
specific quality-of-life scores as the two primary 
outcomes and cardiovascular events as a second-
ary outcome when it became apparent that the 
trial would be underpowered for cardiovascular 
events owing to delays and difficulties in re-
cruitment.11
The secondary outcomes included changes 
from baseline in generic health-related quality of 
life (as assessed by the EuroQoL [EQ] Group 
5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire [EQ-5D]; 
scores on the EQ-5D descriptive index range 
from −0.59 to 1.00, and scores on the EQ visual-
analogue scale range from 0 to 100, with higher 
scores indicating better quality of life),16 compre-
hensive thyroid-related quality of life (as assessed 
by the ThyPRO-39 score, a shorter version of the 
ThyPRO measure,17 at final follow-up only), hand-
grip strength (as assessed by means of the Jamar 
isometric dynamometer, with the recorded score 
as the best of three measures in the dominant 
hand),18 executive cognitive function (as assessed 
with the letter–digit coding test, which indicates 
the speed of processing according to the number 
of correct responses in matching nine letters 
with nine digits in 90 seconds; minimum score, 
0, with higher scores indicating better executive 
cognitive function; there is no maximum score),19 
blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), weight, 
body-mass index, waist circumference, activities 
of daily living (as assessed by the Barthel Index of 
functional levels in activities of daily living, on 
a scale ranging from 0 to 20, with higher scores 
indicating better performance),20 the Instrumen-
tal Activities of Daily Living score (on a scale from 
0 to 14, with higher scores indicating better 
performance in activities of daily living),21 and 
fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. The 
minimum follow-up was 1 year, and the maxi-
mum follow-up was 3 years.
Safety and Recording of Adverse Events
Adverse events were assessed, managed, recorded, 
reported, and analyzed in accordance with the 
Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regu-
lations 2004 (as amended). Adverse events of 
special interest included new atrial fibrillation, 
heart failure, fracture, and new diagnosis of 
osteoporosis. The score on the ThyPRO Hyperthy-
roid Symptoms scale was recorded as a measure 
of possible adverse effects (on a scale from 0 to 
100, with higher scores indicating more symp-
toms; minimum clinically important difference 
has been estimated as 9 points).14
Statistical Analysis
The Hypothyroid Symptoms and Tiredness scores 
from the ThyPRO14 were the two primary out-
comes, with the required P value for statistical 
significance split equally to each test (0.05/2 
= 
0.025 
for each test). We assumed standard deviations 
for data at 1 year of 13.3 and 18.3 on the 
100-point scales, respectively, after adjustment 
for baseline values. These calculations provided 
the trial with 80% power to detect a change with 
levothyroxine treatment (vs. placebo) of 3.0 points 
on the Hypothyroid Symptoms score and 4.1 
points on the Tiredness score with our revised 
maximum expected number of recruited partici-
pants of 750, and with changes of 3.5 points and 
4.9 points, respectively, with our minimum ex-
pected number of 540 participants. Justification 
for these power calculations is provided in the 
trial protocol.11
The methods of analysis of the continuous 
efficacy outcomes involving measurements at 
baseline and follow-up were analyzed at each 
time point for the comparison of the two trial 
groups, with adjustment for stratification vari-
ables (country, sex, and starting dose of levothy-
roxine) and baseline levels of the same variable 
with the use of multivariate linear regression 
(see the Supplementary Appendix). The efficacy 
and safety analyses were carried out in a modi-
fied intention-to-treat population, which included

participants with data on the outcome of interest. 
Patients who discontinued the trial regimen con-
tinued to be followed for the modified intention-
to-treat analysis. These analyses were supported 
with sensitivity analyses that used mixed-effects 
models and multiple imputations for missing 
data. The primary and secondary outcomes at 12 
months were also analyzed in prespecified sub-
groups according to sex and baseline thyrotro-
pin level.11 Analyses were repeated in the per-
protocol population, which included participants 
who continued to take the trial regimen per the 
trial protocol.
Results
Trial Population
We screened 2647 community-dwelling persons 
who were at least 65 years of age and who were 
identified as having biochemical subclinical hypo-
thyroidism. A total of 737 participants underwent 
randomization, 369 of whom were assigned to 
receive placebo and 368 to receive levothyroxine 
(Fig. 1). The characteristics at baseline were 
similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean age 
of the patients was 74.4 years, and 396 patients 
(53.7%) were women. A score of 0 (indicating no 
symptoms) at baseline was observed in 199 of 
737 participants (27.0%) on the Hypothyroid 
Symptoms scale and in 64 (8.7%) on the Tired-
ness scale; 36 participants (4.9%) had a score of 
0 in both domains.
A total of 337 participants (91.3%) who were 
randomly assigned to the placebo group com-
pleted 12-month follow-up, as did 332 (90.2%) in 
the levothyroxine group. The median follow-up 
for all the participants who underwent random-
ization (including participants who discontinued 
the trial regimen) was 17.3 months (interquartile 
range, 12.0 to 24.4) in the placebo group and 
18.0 months (interquartile range, 11.0 to 25.4) 
in the levothyroxine group. The median dose of 
levothyroxine at 1 year was 50 μg. The numbers 
of patients who were included in the analyses 
are presented in Figure 1.
Thyroid-Function Tests
The mean (±SD) thyrotropin level at baseline was 
6.40±2.01 mIU per liter. The thyrotropin levels 
were reduced from baseline to a greater extent in 
the levothyroxine group than in the placebo group 
at all time points of review, with a mean between-
group difference of 2.29 mIU per liter at 6 to 
8 weeks after randomization (P<0.001) (Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). At 12 months, 
the mean thyrotropin level was 5.48±2.48 mIU 
per liter in the placebo group, as compared with 
3.63±2.11 mIU per liter in the levothyroxine 
group, resulting in a between-group difference of 
1.92 mIU per liter (P<0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). 
There was a significant interaction between the 
trial group and the office visit (P 
= 
0.03), with a 
Figure 1. Randomization, Follow-up, and Dose Levels.
Exclusions for other reasons included use of antithyroid medication (in 17 
persons), recent thyroid surgery (in 1), recent acute coronary syndrome (in 1), 
current participation in another trial (in 1), and adrenal insufficiency (in 1). 
Two patients who were excluded because the thyrotropin level reverted to 
less than 4.60 mIU per liter also had an additional exclusion of galactose 
intolerance. Extended follow-up beyond 12 months was conducted in a 
subgroup of patients, with a median duration of follow-up from baseline  
of 24.2 months (interquartile range, 18.4 to 30.3) in the placebo group and 
24.5 months (interquartile range, 18.4 to 30.5) in the levothyroxine group.

The Hypothyroid Symptoms score and the Tiredness score from the Thyroid-Related Quality of Life Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPRO) ques-
tionnaire are each assessed on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms and tiredness, respectively. The minimum 
clinically important difference for each score has been estimated as 9 points. The EuroQoL [EQ] Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire 
(EQ-5D) scores included both the EQ-5D descriptive index (on a scale from −0.59 to 1.00) and the score on the EQ visual-analogue scale (on a 
scale from 0 to 100); higher scores on each scale indicate better quality of life. The score on the letter–digit coding test (a test of executive cogni-
tive function) indicates the speed of processing according to the number of correct responses in matching nine letters with nine digits in 90 sec-
onds (minimum score is 0, with higher scores indicating better executive cognitive function; there is no maximum score). The body-mass index 
is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. The Barthel Index uses a scale from 0 to 20 points, with higher numbers 
indicating better performance on activities of daily living. The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale has a maximum score of 14 (range, 0 to 
14), with higher scores indicating better performance in activities of daily living.

Thyroid Hormone in Subclinical Hypothyroidism
reduction in the thyrotropin level being the 
greatest at 6 to 8 weeks.
Free thyroxine levels were not routinely mea-
sured, although the data were available in a sub-
group of patients. The mean free thyroxine level 
was 2.3 pmol per liter (0.2 ng per deciliter) higher 
in the levothyroxine group than in the placebo 
group both at 6 to 8 weeks and at 12 months 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Thyroid-Specific Quality of Life
The mean Hypothyroid Symptoms score at 12 
months (with adjustment for baseline score) was 
16.7±17.5 in the placebo group and 16.6±16.9 in 
the levothyroxine group (P 
= 
0.99). The mean 
Tiredness score was 28.6±19.5 in the placebo 
group and 28.7±20.2 in the levothyroxine group 
(P 
= 
0.77). We found no differences in the mean 
change at 1 year in the Hypothyroid Symptoms 
score (0.2±15.3 in the placebo group and 0.2±14.4 
in the levothyroxine group) or the Tiredness score 
(3.2±17.7 and 3.8±18.4, respectively) (Table 2). 
There were no significant between-group differ-
ences in either of these measures at 6 to 8 weeks 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). There 
was a small-magnitude between-group difference 
in the Tiredness score, with a lower value in the 
levothyroxine group than in the placebo group 
(difference, −3.49; P 
= 
0.05) at the extended follow-
up review (Table 2). Prespecified analyses accord-
ing to sex and baseline thyrotropin level did not 
reveal any subgroups of patients who benefited 
from treatment with levothyroxine. Per-protocol 
analyses and sensitivity analyses with the use of 
multiple imputation of missing values showed no 
significant differences between the levothyroxine 
group and the placebo group (Tables S4 and S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Other Outcome Measures
The EQ-5D descriptive index showed a small 
deterioration at 12 months (mean difference 
between the levothyroxine group and the placebo 
group, −0.025; P 
= 
0.05) but a minor improvement 
at extended follow-up (mean difference, 0.040; 
P 
= 
0.03); there were no significant between-
group differences at 6 to 8 weeks. There were no 
significant between-group differences in the score 
on the EQ visual-analogue scale (Table 2, and 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
No significant effects were seen in any of the 
*  
All these analyses were conducted in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all the participants who had undergone randomization (excluding those who had under-
gone randomization in error) for whom data was available on the outcome of interest. For analyses at the 12-month visit to be valid, they must have been conducted at 12 months 
(within a ±31-day window) after randomization. Results at 12 months, at the extended follow-up visit, and between-group differences are adjusted for stratification variables (country, 
sex, and starting dose of levothyroxine) and baseline levels of the same variable with the use of linear regression. Between-group differences are the value in the levothyroxine group 
 
minus the value in the placebo group. Data for the extended follow-up visit were additionally adjusted for time to visit. Data were missing for the following outcomes: for the thyrotropin 
level at 12 months for 7 patients in the placebo group and 1 in the levothyroxine group and at extended follow-up for 7 in the placebo group and 6 in the levothyroxine group; for the 
EQ-5D score at extended follow-up for 1 in the levothyroxine group; for the EQ visual-analogue scale (VAS) score at 12 months for 1 in the placebo group and at extended follow-up for 
1 in the levothyroxine group; for hand-grip strength at baseline for 11 in the placebo group and 10 in the levothyroxine group, at 12 months for 22 in the placebo group and 16 in the 
l 
evothyroxine group, and at extended follow-up for 14 in the placebo group and 8 in the levothyroxine group; for blood pressure at baseline and at 12 months for 1 in the placebo group 
and at extended follow-up for 5 in each group; on body-mass index at baseline for 1 in each group, at 12 months for 2 in the placebo group and 1 in the levothyroxine group, and at ex-
tended follow-up for 2 in the placebo group and 4 in the levothyroxine group; and for waist circumference at baseline for 1 in each group, at 12 months for 1 in the placebo group and  
2 in the levothyroxine group, and at extended follow-up for 2 in the placebo group and 4 in the levothyroxine group. CI denotes confidence interval.
†  
Extended follow-up beyond 12 months was performed in a subgroup of patients. The median duration of follow-up from baseline was 24.2 months (interquartile range, 18.4 to 30.3) in 
the placebo group and 24.5 months (interquartile range, 18.4 to 30.5) in the levothyroxine group.
‡  
The two primary outcomes were the Hypothyroid Symptoms score and the Tiredness score from the ThyPRO questionnaire at 12 months (adjusted as stated above). The range of each 
scale is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms. The minimum clinically important difference for each score has been estimated as 9 points.

The score on the Hyperthyroid Symptoms scale was recorded as a measure of possible adverse effects (on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms; mini-
mum clinically important difference has been estimated as 9 points).

other secondary-outcome measures, either in the 
modified intention-to-treat or per-protocol analy-
ses or in the prespecified subgroups (Table 2, 
and Tables S4, S6, S7, and S8 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Results regarding cardiovascular 
events and total and cardiovascular mortality are 
provided in Table 3 and in Figures S1 and S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Adverse Effects and Events
We found no significant difference in the Hyper-
thyroid Symptoms score (according to the ThyPRO 
assessment) with levothyroxine, as compared with 
placebo, at any time point (Table 2, and Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The incidence of 
serious adverse events of special interest (atrial 
fibrillation, heart failure, fracture, or new diag-
nosis of osteoporosis) was similar in the two 
groups (Table 3). The number of patients with at 
least one serious adverse event was slightly higher 
in the placebo group than in the levothyroxine 
group (P 
= 
0.049), as was the total number of 
serious adverse events. However, we observed no 
pattern of event type that contributed to this dif-
ference. The proportions of patients who discon-
tinued the trial regimen or who withdrew from 
follow-up were similar in the two groups (Table 3).
Discussion
In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving 
older participants with subclinical hypothyroid-
ism, treatment with levothyroxine was associated 
with a persistently lower serum thyrotropin level 
than was placebo (between-group difference, ap-
proximately 2 mIU per liter), with the maximum 
effects seen at time of first review (6 to 8 weeks). 
We found that levothyroxine had no consistent 
beneficial effect on thyroid-related symptoms. 
This finding was true in both older men and 
older women and for different thyrotropin levels 
at baseline. Our trial had good statistical power to 
detect a clinically meaningful effect on thyroid-
related quality of life, with 95% confidence inter-
vals that excluded a beneficial effect greater than 
2.1 points (on a scale from 0 to 100) in either of 
the two primary outcomes. If a symptom benefit 
was to have occurred, it would have been ex-
pected to be seen at 12 months.
The subsequent small-magnitude between-
group difference in tiredness with levothyroxine 
versus placebo in the subgroup of patients who 
had extended follow-up is likely to be a chance 
finding. In contrast, an observational study of 
the treatment of autoimmune hypothyroidism in 
middle-age participants (median baseline thyro-
tropin level, 8.1 mIU per liter) showed that the 
Tiredness score improved markedly (reduction of 
12 points at 6 months) and that the Hypothyroid 
Symptoms score also was reduced (by 2 points).22 
A small reduction in tiredness has previously 
been shown in a short-term trial of levothyroxine 
for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in 
120 middle-age participants.23 There are limited 
data from high-quality, randomized, controlled 
trials regarding the effects of levothyroxine re-
placement in older persons with subclinical hypo-
thyroidism.1 Studies have generally been small 
(≤120 participants) and underpowered, often fo-

pin level with the use of linear regression; data for the

Thyroid Hormone in Subclinical Hypothyroidism
cusing on younger participants and with a short 
duration of follow-up.9,10
Levothyroxine treatment yielded no signifi-
cant beneficial effects on a range of secondary-
outcome measures. We found a slight deteriora-
tion (of borderline statistical significance) in the 
EQ-5D descriptive index with levothyroxine versus 
placebo at 12 months but an improvement versus 
placebo in the subgroup of patients who com-
pleted extended follow-up (median, 24.5 months). 
The effects we observed were in opposite direc-
tions at these different time points and were of 
very small magnitude (−0.025 at 12 months and 
0.040 at extended follow-up), and therefore these 
are likely to be random chance findings. The 
estimated minimally important difference in the 
EQ-5D descriptive index that has been reported 
for other conditions is summarized in a recent 
review as being between 0.037 and 0.069.24 No 
effect of treatment was seen with regard to the 
EQ visual-analogue scale scores. Therefore, it 
appears that levothyroxine had no clinically sig-
nificant effects on generic health-related quality 
of life.
Muscle function has been described as being 
adversely affected by underactive thyroid.25 How-
ever, we found that hand-grip strength did not 
change from baseline significantly more with 
levothyroxine treatment than with placebo. Sim-
ilarly, it has been suggested that the speed of in-
formation processing is slowed in persons with 
subclinical hypothyroidism.4 However, we found 
no benefit with levothyroxine with regard to ex-
ecutive cognitive function as measured by the 
letter–digit coding test. There also was no effect 
of treatment on blood pressure, weight, waist 
circumference, body-mass index, or the Barthel 
Index or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living 
scores.
Participants were monitored closely for adverse 
effects from levothyroxine treatment. We found 
no increase in hyperthyroid symptoms after the 
initiation of treatment, and there was no signifi-
cant excess of serious adverse events of special 
interest, including atrial fibrillation, heart fail-
ure, fracture, or new diagnosis of osteoporosis. 
We believe that the slight excess of patients who 
had serious adverse events in the placebo group

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
is a chance finding; the events were spread 
among a range of body systems, and no particu-
lar pattern was observed. Observational studies 
also have not shown any association of treatment 
of subclinical hypothyroidism with an increased 
risk of adverse events.26
Many older persons with biochemical results 
that are consistent with subclinical hypothyroid-
ism will have reversion to a euthyroid state if 
they are followed up without treatment. In total, 
approximately three out of five persons that we 
screened for entry into the trial on the basis of 
previously elevated thyrotropin levels had rever-
sion to normal thyroid biochemical results and 
were therefore excluded from the trial. These data 
are consistent with several other observational 
and trial cohorts that showed a high proportion 
of participants with an elevated thyrotropin level 
having reversion to biochemical euthyroidism 
during follow-up.4,27,28
Our trial has certain strengths. The trial 
included a sufficient number of participants to 
provide good statistical power to show no bene-
fits regarding symptoms. We used validated 
measures of thyroid-specific quality of life that 
have been shown to be sensitive to change,14,17 as 
well as a range of secondary outcomes of clinical 
relevance. However, the trial also had certain 
limitations. First, we chose to set a thyrotropin 
target of 0.40 to 4.60 mIU per liter with levothy-
roxine treatment, which is an approach that re-
flects recent guidelines, particularly for older 
persons.7 However, some authorities have recom-
mended a lower thyrotropin target (e.g., 0.40 to 
2.50 mIU per liter).29 We cannot exclude the pos-
sibility that this more aggressive treatment ap-
proach might be beneficial. Second, since few 
participants had a baseline thyrotropin level of 
more than 10 mIU per liter, we cannot address 
whether there are benefits from treatment in this 
subgroup. Third, the symptom levels at trial entry 
were low, so we cannot exclude the possibility of 
benefit in persons with more marked symptoms. 
Fourth, we did not measure thyroid antibody 
levels. Antibody-positive patients are more likely 
than antibody-negative patients to have progres-
sive hypothyroidism and therefore may be more 
likely to have a benefit from long-term levothy-
roxine treatment.7 Finally, our trial was under-
powered to detect any effect of levothyroxine on 
the incidence of cardiovascular events or mortal-
ity. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility 
that treatment with levothyroxine may provide 
cardiovascular protection or cause harm.
In conclusion, this trial indicated that treat-
ment with levothyroxine in older persons with 
subclinical hypothyroidism provided no symp-
tomatic benefits.
