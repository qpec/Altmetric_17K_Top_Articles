ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To assess the association between anticoagulation, 
ischaemic stroke, gastrointestinal and cerebral 
haemorrhage, and all cause mortality in older people 
with atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease.
DESIGN
Propensity matched, population based, retrospective 
cohort analysis from January 2006 through December 
2016.
SETTING
The Royal College of General Practitioners Research 
and Surveillance Centre database population of 
almost 2.73 million patients from 110 general 
practices across England and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS
Patients aged 65 years and over with a new diagnosis 
of atrial fibrillation and estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) of <50 mL/min/1.73m2, calculated 
using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology 
collaboration creatinine equation. Patients with a 
previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or receiving 
anticoagulation in the preceding 120 days were 
excluded, as were patients requiring dialysis and 
recipients of renal transplants.
INTERVENTION
Receipt of an anticoagulant prescription within 60 
days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Ischaemic stroke, cerebral or gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, and all cause mortality.
RESULTS
6977 patients with chronic kidney disease and 
newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation were identified, 
of whom 2434 were on anticoagulants within 60 
days of diagnosis and 4543 were not. 2434 pairs 
were matched using propensity scores by exposure 
to anticoagulant or none and followed for a median 
of 506 days. The crude rates for ischaemic stroke 
and haemorrhage were 4.6 and 1.2 after taking 
anticoagulants and 1.5 and 0.4 in patients who 
were not taking anticoagulant per 100 person years, 
respectively. The hazard ratios for ischaemic stroke, 
haemorrhage, and all cause mortality for those on 
anticoagulants were 2.60 (95% confidence interval 
2.00 to 3.38), 2.42 (1.44 to 4.05), and 0.82 (0.74 
to 0.91) compared with those who received no 
anticoagulation.
CONCLUSION
Giving anticoagulants to older people with 
concomitant atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney 
disease was associated with an increased rate 
of ischaemic stroke and haemorrhage but a 
paradoxical lowered rate of all cause mortality. 
Careful consideration should be given before starting 
anticoagulants in older people with chronic kidney 
disease who develop atrial fibrillation. There remains 
an urgent need for adequately powered randomised 
trials in this population to explore these findings and 
to provide clarity on correct clinical management.
Introduction
Atrial fibrillation is the most frequently occurring 
sustained cardiac arrhythmia worldwide.1 2 It affects at 
least 33.5 million people aged over 55 years globally 
and is predicted to more than double over the next 50 
years. It is associated with increased morbidity from 
thromboembolic stroke and from cardiac failure, and 
all cause mortality.3-7 The economic burden of atrial 
fibrillation accounts for 1% of the NHS budget in the 
UK and up to $26bn (£19bn; €21bn) a year in the 
USA.8-10
Chronic kidney disease affects around 10-15% 
of adults globally. Around one third of cases have 
concomitant atrial fibrillation; shared risk factors 
include hypertension, dyslipidaemia, coronary artery 
disease, and diabetes mellitus.11-13 In this patient 
population, the risk of stroke and haemorrhage 
increases progressively as the estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) declines, which complicates 
the decision over whether to initiate anticoagulation. 
Research has focused more on end stage renal disease 
even though it accounts for less than 1% of atrial

Optimal management of older patients with chronic kidney disease not requiring 
dialysis and concomitant atrial fibrillation is hindered by a lack of high quality 
clinical guidelines or randomised controlled trial evidence to support clinical 
decision making
Risk of stroke and haemorrhage in this patient group increases progressively 
with declining renal function, which makes the decision over whether to start 
anticoagulants difficult

fibrillation cases.14 No randomised controlled trial has 
been performed in the patients with chronic kidney 
disease who are not on dialysis. The few observational 
studies of anticoagulation in patients with chronic 
kidney disease who are not on dialysis have yielded 
conflicting results and are hampered by modest 
sample size,14-19 highly selected populations,20 and 
suboptimal methods for identifying chronic kidney 
disease.18 21 22
Chronic kidney disease is most prevalent in older 
people. In the US, almost 40% of those aged over 
60 years have chronic kidney disease compared 
with 11% in the general population.23 In those aged 
65 and over, atrial fibrillation affects over 20% of 
patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease and 
27% of those with end stage renal disease, compared 
with only 6% in the general population.24 25 Taken 
together, older patients with chronic kidney disease 
and atrial fibrillation are an increasing healthcare 
burden yet are poorly studied.
In the absence of chronic kidney disease, 
anticoagulation confers protection against ischaemic 
stroke compared with no antithrombotic agent or 
antiplatelet agents alone.26 But the net clinical 
benefits in chronic kidney disease are less certain 
given the greater risk of haemorrhage and other effects 
on overall survival.27 Over a quarter of older patients 
discontinue warfarin in the first year of prescription 
because of perceived safety concerns.28 Older people 
are less likely to be offered anticoagulant drugs than 
are their younger counterparts, based on comorbidities 
and other personal characteristics, such as risk of 
falls, rather than on the results of established clinical 
scoring systems.29
Only two studies, both from Canada, have reported 
the outcomes of anticoagulating older people with atrial 
fibrillation and intercurrent non-end stage chronic 
kidney disease, with conflicting findings.30 31 The first, 
a population based study from Ontario, showed that 
anticoagulation did not prevent ischaemic stroke but 
was associated with a higher rate of haemorrhage and 
with improved survival. By contrast, data from the 
Alberta Kidney Disease Network showed that warfarin 
was associated with a significantly lower risk of a 
composite outcome (all cause death, ischaemic stroke, 
and transient ischaemic attack) at one year, with 
excess bleeding only seen in those with an eGFR of 
60-89 ml/min/1.73m2. Given the paucity of trial data, 
the conflicting outcome data from the small number 
of studies, and the lack of specific clinical practice 
guidelines in this important and frequently occurring 
clinical setting, we explored the association between 
ischaemic stroke, haemorrhage, and mortality in a 
large population of older patients with chronic kidney 
disease and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, some 
of whom were on anticoagulants.
Methods
Data source, study design, and ethics
We conducted this population based, retrospective, 
cohort study using the Royal College of General 
Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre 
database, one of the oldest primary care sentinel 
networks, comprising nearly 2.73 million patients 
across 110 general practices in the UK.32 The network 
monitors data from 1.7% of all general practices in 
England, with ongoing patient recruitment, and is 
representative of the general UK population.32 33
The study was tested against the Health Research 
Authority and Medical Research Council guidance for 
identifying research and was deemed to be an audit 
of current practice so specific ethical approval was 
not required. The protocol was approved by the RCGP. 
We adhered to the STROBE statement for reporting 
observational studies.34
Study population
The study spanned an 11 year period from 1 January 
2006 to 31 December 2016. We included patients 
aged 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of atrial 
fibrillation and eGFR <50 ml/min/1.73m2, calculated 
using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology 
collaboration creatinine equation with more than 
one eGFR value (fig 1).35 We chose this level of renal 
impairment to align our study with previous major 
phase III anticoagulation trials.36-39 We excluded 
patients with a previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, 
those in receipt of a prescription for anticoagulation 
in the 120 days before diagnosis, those on chronic 
dialysis, and recipients of renal transplants. Atrial 
fibrillation was defined by Read codes40 from the 
primary care database using diagnostic and process of 
care codes to maximise case identification.41 In the UK, 
patients can be registered with only a single primary 
care provider or general practice, and records of all 
secondary care events are sent to the patient’s general 
practitioner. Diagnoses are coded into the primary care 
record, so UK primary care records provide a robust 
list of a patient’s diagnoses made in both primary and 
secondary care.

Study design
Patients on anticoagulants entered the study (the time 
at which outcome ascertainment began) on the day 
they received their first anticoagulant prescription 
within 60 days of their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. 
Patients who received anticoagulation were propensity 
matched in a 1:1 ratio with those who were not 
anticoagulated and were alive at the time of the first 
dispensed prescription to their matched counterpart. 
To mitigate the effect of immortal time bias, the date 
that the patient who was not on an anticoagulant 
entered the study coincided with the date that they 
received a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation plus the time 
between their matched counterpart’s diagnosis of 
atrial fibrillation and first anticoagulant prescription 
(fig 2).31 42
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, 
or implementation of the study. No patients were asked 
to advise on interpretation or reporting the results. 
There are no plans to disseminate the results of the 
research to study participants or the relevant patient 
community.
Exposure and outcome measures
Exposure was defined as receipt of a prescription 
for anticoagulants within 60 days of receiving a 
diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Almost all anticoagulant 
prescriptions in the UK are issued from primary care 
and are, therefore, captured in the RCGP Research 
and Surveillance Centre database, except when the 
anticoagulant is started in hospital. The 60 day period 
allowed for the transfer of anticoagulant prescribing to 
primary care from secondary care.
Anticoagulants included vitamin K antagonists, 
direct oral anticoagulants, and heparin based 
compounds (full dose for anticoagulation). Outcomes 
were ischaemic stroke including transient ischaemic 
attack, gastrointestinal or cerebral haemorrhage, and 
all cause mortality, using previously published Read 
codes.43 44 Unclassified strokes were combined with 
ischaemic strokes, an approach used in other studies,45 
because about 87% of all strokes have ischaemic 
aetiology.46 Study participants were followed for 
ischaemic stroke, cerebral or gastrointestinal bleeding 
events, and death up to 31 December 2016. We censored 
patients who had an interval of greater than 60 days 
between anticoagulant prescriptions, a timeframe 
that reflects the typical duration of an anticoagulant 
prescription issued in UK primary care. Patients who 
were not on anticoagulants were censored at the time 
of receipt of first anticoagulant prescription.30
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using R (http://www.r-
project.org), version 2.15.0, and statistical significance 
was defined as a P value less than 0.05 with two 
sided testing. We used propensity score matching 
with demographic and clinical variables to adjust for 
potential confounding from imbalances in clinical 
characteristics between patients receiving and not 
receiving 
anticoagulation. 
Demographic 
variables 
were age, sex, year of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, and 
index of multiple deprivation (IMD) decile. The IMD 
is derived from patient postcode and is the official 
national measure of deprivation. It provides a combined 
measure of household income, education, healthcare 
provision, and living environment for the UK at small 
spatial scales.47 Clinical variables were smoking status, 
eGFR, comorbidities at baseline (myocardial infarction, 
coronary artery disease, cardiac failure, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, history of previous stroke 
or transient ischaemic attack, previous cerebral or 
gastrointestinal bleed, peripheral artery disease), and 
drugs at baseline (antiplatelet agents excluding aspirin, 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin 
II receptor blockers, lipid lowering drugs, β blockers, 
aspirin, potassium sparing diuretics, supraventricular 
and 
ventricular 
antiarrhythmic 
agents, 
thiazide 
diuretics, calcium channel blockers, β blockers, loop 
diuretics, insulin, metformin, cardiac glycosides).

Patients who received anticoagulation were matched 
in a 1:1 ratio with those who were not anticoagulated, 
and differences in clinical characteristics were 
assessed using standardised differences, with values 
<0.1 considered well balanced. We calculated the 
incidence of ischaemic stroke, haemorrhage, and 
all cause mortality per 100 person years of follow-
up. We generated Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 
the outcomes of interest grouped by anticoagulation 
status. Cox proportion regression were reported 
as adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence 
intervals. Because all baseline characteristics were 
balanced in the propensity matched model, receipt of 
anticoagulation was the only independent variable in 
our Cox regression model.
Sensitivity analyses
We undertook a series of sensitivity analyses to confirm 
our findings. We performed an intention to treat 
analysis, in which we did not censor patients after 
starting anticoagulants, irrespective of the time interval 
between anticoagulant prescriptions. We repeated the 
analysis censoring patients at an interval of 160 days 
between anticoagulation prescriptions (rather than 60 
days used in the primary analysis) to detect additional 
events after discontinuation of anticoagulation.
Results
Baseline characteristics of all patients
A total of 6977 patients met the inclusion criteria of 
being aged 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of 
atrial fibrillation and eGFR <50 ml/min/1.73m2 (fig 1). 
Of these, 2424 received an anticoagulant within 60 
days of diagnosis. The anticoagulants used were 
vitamin K antagonists (1739, 71.7%), rivaroxaban 
(307, 12.7%), apixaban (261, 10.8%), dabigatran (69, 
2.8%) unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin 
(44, 1.8%), and edoxaban (4, 0.17%). The mean 
number of days from atrial fibrillation diagnosis to first 
prescription of an anticoagulant was 17.8 (range 0-59, 
interquartile range 2-29).
Before matching, patients prescribed anticoagulants 
tended to be younger (mean 81.7 years v 83.2 years), 
female (54.7%), and not current smokers (8.6% v 
12.1%), compared with those not on anticoagulants 
(table 1). The groups were well matched in the index 
of deprivation decile. Patients on anticoagulants were 
less likely to have previous cerebral (0.7% v 1.6%) or 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage (2.8% v 5.1%). The mean 
CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, 
Age ≥75 years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke/
transient ischaemic attack, Vascular disease, Age 65-
74 years, Sex category; age≥75 years and previous 
stroke carry doubled risk weight) score of 4.2 (standard 
deviation ± 1.2) did not differ between the groups, and 
the mean eGFR was also similar in patients who did and 
did not receive anticoagulants (38.6 v 37.4). Coronary 
artery disease was more frequent in the anticoagulant 
group (14.0% v 10.2%), as was the prescription of 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (46.8% v 
34.9%), angiotensin II receptor blockers (11.4% v 
7.4%), β blockers (11.4% v 7.4%), β blockers (62.8% 
v 47.2%), thiazide diuretics (23.9% v 13.1%), calcium 
channel blockers (39.4% v 26.7%), lipid lowering 
agents (58.7% v 46.6%), metformin (11.1% v 7.2%), 
and aspirin (16.3% v 11.6%).
Propensity matched model
In the propensity score matched cohort of 2424 
pairs, we found no major differences between the two 
groups (table 1). The median follow-up duration was 
506 days (interquartile range 175-1131) for the 4848 
patients included in the analysis. There were a total 
of 309 ischaemic strokes (6.4%), 79 gastrointestinal 
or cerebral haemorrhage events (1.6%), and 1410 
all cause fatalities (29.1%). The crude rates for 
ischaemic stroke and haemorrhage were 4.6 and 1.2 
after anticoagulation, and 1.5 and 0.4 in patients 
who did not take anticoagulants per 100 person 
years, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves by receipt of 
anticoagulation for ischaemic stroke, haemorrhage, 
and all cause mortality are shown in figure 3. In the 
Cox proportion regression models, the hazard ratios 
for ischaemic stroke, haemorrhage and all cause 
mortality for patients on anticoagulants were 2.60 
(95% confidence interval 2.00 to 3.38), 2.42 (1.44 to 
4.05), and 0.82 (0.74 to 0.91) compared with those 
who received no anticoagulation.
These findings were consistent in the sensitivity 
analyses. 
In 
the 
intention 
to 
treat 
analysis, 
anticoagulation was associated with a higher hazard 
ratio for stroke (2.62, 2.04 to 3.46) and haemorrhage 
(2.46, 1.47 to 4.09), but was lower for all cause 
mortality (0.84, 0.75 to 0.93). Increased risk of stroke 
(2.59, 1.99 to 3.37) and haemorrhage (2.41, 1.44 to 
34.04) and reduced risk of all cause mortality (0.83, 
0.76 to 0.92) persisted when using a 160 day interval 
between prescriptions as a censoring event. We found 
no fault in the proportional hazards assumption using 
the method of Grambsch and Therneau.48
discussion
In this propensity matched, population based study 
of older people with chronic kidney disease and new 
onset atrial fibrillation, we found that anticoagulation 
was associated with an increased rate of ischaemic 
stroke and haemorrhage but a lower rate of all cause 
mortality. The crude rates of ischaemic stroke and 
haemorrhage were 4.6 and 1.2 after anticoagulation 
and 1.5 and 0.4 in patients with no anticoagulation 
per 100 person years, respectively. The hazard ratios 
for developing ischaemic stroke, haemorrhage, and 
all cause mortality in the anticoagulant group were 
2.60 (2.00 to 3.38), 2.42 (1.44 to 4.05), and 0.82 
(0.74 to 0.91) compared with their counterparts 
who did not receive anticoagulants. These findings 
were consistent after performing several sensitivity 
analyses.
For the general population, overwhelming evidence 
from large scale randomised controlled trials supports 
oral anticoagulation in the context of atrial fibrillation 
for stroke thromboprophylaxis, and this has been 
 on 2 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

50 However, this may not apply in patients with atrial 
fibrillation and concurrent chronic kidney disease. 
Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in patients 
requiring chronic dialysis is a contentious issue, 
lacking convincing data from randomised controlled 
trials.51 Large studies have shown a doubling in risk 
of stroke after anticoagulation52 53 and a heightened 
risk of intracranial haemorrhage and major systemic 
bleeding.54 55 Subsequent meta-analyses, however, 
have found no association between anticoagulation 
and ischaemic stroke, but a continued risk of major 
bleeding events remains.56 57
The role of anticoagulation in patients with chronic 
kidney disease not on dialysis is even less certain. 
In our cohort, 35% of patients were in receipt of an 
anticoagulant prescription, though rates of 23%-45% 
have been reported in the published literature.21 30 
31 Data on the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants 
in people with chronic kidney disease not requiring 
dialysis and concurrent atrial fibrillation are lacking 
(table 2). A study in this population from Danish 
national registries found that warfarin was not 
associated with a statistically significant decrease in 
risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism, but 
both warfarin and aspirin increased bleeding risk.21 
A limitation of the study, however, was the absence 
of data pertaining to the degree of renal impairment, 
with broad categorisation of patients into those with 
no renal impairment, those with chronic kidney 
disease not needing dialysis, or those requiring renal 
replacement therapy. Carrero and colleagues followed 
survivors of acute myocardial infarction with atrial 
fibrillation who were prescribed warfarin before being 
discharged from hospital.20 In this cohort, patients 
with all stages of chronic kidney disease, including 
those needing dialysis, who took anticoagulants had 
lower rates of ischaemic stroke and all cause mortality 
and no significant increased risk of major bleeding. 
This highly selected population, however, limits the 
generalisability of their observations.
Our study corroborates the results of a large 
prospective study that found that patients with 
chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation who 
received anticoagulants had reduced all cause 
mortality and increased bleeding.19 However, contrary 
to our findings, there was a reduction in the incidence 
of ischaemic strokes. A 15 year, register based, 
cohort study from Denmark found that warfarin was 
associated with a higher rate of bleeding in patients 
with chronic kidney disease, with the exception of 
those with stage I disease, and with a lower rate of 
stroke in non-end stage chronic kidney disease.22 
Results from a Canadian healthcare database indicated 
that giving anticoagulants to older patients with 
chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis and with 
an eGFR of ≤45 mL/min/1.73m2 did not reduce risk 
of ischaemic stroke and induced major haemorrhage 
but was associated with significantly less mortality. 
A time varying analysis of their cohort raised the 
possibility that anticoagulation might increase the risk 
of ischaemic stroke. Most recently, in a cohort of older 
patients, Jun and colleagues found that warfarin use 
was associated with a significantly lower risk of the one 
year composite outcome of all cause death, ischaemic 
stroke, and transient ischaemic attack across all 
eGFR strata. Unexpectedly, warfarin was associated 
with 5-29% fewer bleeding episodes, and excess 
haemorrhage noted only in patients with an eGFR 
of 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2. This may reflect residual 
confounding in the study or incomplete outcome data.
We describe for the first time a paradoxical increase 
in ischaemic stroke associated with the receipt of an 
anticoagulant prescription in patients with chronic

kidney disease not requiring dialysis and new onset 
atrial fibrillation. This finding had previously been 
reported only in end stage kidney disease complicated 
by atrial fibrillation and is at odds with a systematic 
review of observational studies of patients with chronic 
kidney disease and concomitant atrial fibrillation, 
which found an overall reduction in ischaemic stroke 
and thromboembolic events after anticoagulation.57 
Several possible explanations exist.
We focused on older people who are at the 
highest risk of experiencing complications related 
to 
anticoagulation, 
resulting 
in 
the 
frequent 
discontinuation of both warfarin and direct oral 
anticoagulants, owing to the safety concerns of 
prescribers.28 58 Our sensitivity analyses enabled 
us to detect events occurring up to 160 days after 
discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Some 
transient ischaemic attacks and ischaemic stroke 
events may have been subclinical and therefore not 
coded in the data, but we think that this is unlikely 
given that our event rates for all outcomes were 
comparable to similar studies in the literature.30
Vitamin K antagonists, used in over 70% of the 
patients on anticoagulants in our study, may accelerate 
the 
development 
and 
progression 
of 
vascular 
calcification through carboxylation of matrix gla 
protein, a potent tissue bound inhibitor of calcification 
in the arterial wall.59 This is especially relevant to older 
patients, who have the highest burden of vascular 
calcification. Furthermore, vascular calcification is 
markedly accelerated in chronic kidney disease and 
contributes to a higher rate of cardiovascular events 
and mortality.12 60 Vascular calcification in older 
patients on anticoagulants may plausibly have led to 
a greater incidence of ischaemic strokes or lacunar 
infarcts in watershed vascular territories, although 
this is not known with precision. Also of concern 
is the finding that patients with chronic kidney 
disease patients are at greater risk of developing 
warfarin related nephropathy,61 potentially further 
compromising kidney function and compounding the 
risk of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.62 Direct 
oral anticoagulants have also been associated with 
declining renal function.63
In the absence of cause specific death data, we 
can only speculate on the possible explanation for 
reduced all cause mortality in the patients taking 
anticoagulants. It may be attributable to a lower rate 
of fatal strokes and protection against subsequent 
myocardial events, a finding shown with both 
warfarin64 and rivaroxaban.65 Although our groups 
were well matched, we cannot exclude the possibility 
of residual confounding by receipt of anticoagulation. 
Our finding of increased haemorrhage in patients 
taking anticoagulants corroborates several existing 
studies.19 21 24 30 Haemostatic dysfunction occurs 
early in chronic kidney disease, with uraemic toxins 
augmenting bleeding risk by altering platelet function

both in terms of recruitment and activity, and this is 
accentuated by anticoagulation.12 25 66 67
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest 
study to consider the efficacy and safety of giving 
anticoagulants to older patients with atrial fibrillation 
and chronic kidney disease in terms of ischaemic stroke, 
risk of bleeding, and all cause mortality. We used an 
established sentinel network of 110 UK primary care 
practices spanning 2.73 million patients, known to be 
representative of the general UK population.32 33 The 
chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration 
creatinine equation was chosen as a surrogate marker 
of kidney function, now widely acknowledged as the 
most accurate marker currently available in routine 
clinical practice.68 A further strength was the relatively 
long follow-up period, almost twice as long as a 
comparable study in this clinical scenario.30
Our work is not without limitations. The study 
population was derived from real world evidence 
with the inherent limitations of diagnostic coding 
and case ascertainment.69 Misclassification bias 
may have occurred as we were unable to review 
electrocardiography and neuroimaging findings. We 
cannot exclude the possibility that some clinical coding 
was incomplete resulting in events being undetected. 
Reassuringly, our stroke and mortality rates are similar 
to a comparable study in this setting.30 Haemorrhage 
rates were lower in our work but we used restrictive 
code based definitions for gastrointestinal and cerebral 
bleeding, rather than non-specific indicators such as 
the need for a blood transfusion that are used in other 
studies.30 Severity of stroke is not readily available from 
the primary care record, so this could not be assessed.
Our study lacked the statistical power to undertake 
separate sub-analyses for gastrointestinal and cerebral 
bleeds. Despite well matched groups after propensity 
score matching, we cannot exclude that the reported 
associations were confounded by indication. Those 
taking anticoagulants may have had an inherent 
increased baseline rate of stroke. Furthermore, an 
assumption was that patients received adequate 
warfarin to put them in the therapeutic range of the 
international normal ratio, though this may be harder 
to achieve consistently in severe chronic kidney 
disease.70 We need robust randomised controlled trials 
to explore whether the reported associations in the 
present study are causal.
Our work is based on dispensed prescriptions 
for anticoagulant drugs; we did not examine data 
on patient adherence, so our findings should be 
interpreted with caution. Lastly, despite our large 
cohort, the proportion of patients receiving direct 
oral anticoagulants was small, so a comparison with 
vitamin K antagonists could not be undertaken. Future 
randomised controlled trials will provide clarity on 
this little studied management conundrum.71
Conclusions
Anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists and, 
more recently, direct oral anticoagulants has been 
clearly shown to mitigate the risk of thromboembolism 
in patients with atrial fibrillation in the general 
population. Applying this approach to older people 
with chronic kidney disease who develop atrial 
fibrillation may not be appropriate, because the present 
study shows a higher bleeding rate, and an increase, 
rather than reduction, in ischaemic stroke. The lower 
all cause mortality in those receiving anticoagulation 
in our study may reflect an undefined protective effect 
of anticoagulation.
The main clinical implication of our findings is the 
considerable uncertainty about the best approach to 
starting and managing anticoagulation in the setting 
of new onset atrial fibrillation in non-dialysis chronic 
kidney disease. Few reports are available, and their main 
findings are discordant, showing reduced stroke,31 no 
effect on stroke,21 30 and increased stroke in this present 
study. The most pressing need is for real world randomised 
controlled trials comparing no anticoagulation (placebo) 
with vitamin K antagonist or taking a hybrid approach of 
placebo versus direct oral anticoagulant versus vitamin 
K antagonists.71 Meanwhile, given the present lack of 
guidelines, the decision to start anticoagulant treatment 
in patients with new onset atrial fibrillation should be 
made on an individual basis, weighing up the known 
risks and potential benefits and, where possible, taking 
into account patients’ wishes.
