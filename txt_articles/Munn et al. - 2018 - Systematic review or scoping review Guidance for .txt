Abstract
Background: Scoping reviews are a relatively new approach to evidence synthesis and currently there exists little
guidance regarding the decision to choose between a systematic review or scoping review approach when
synthesising evidence. The purpose of this article is to clearly describe the differences in indications between
scoping reviews and systematic reviews and to provide guidance for when a scoping review is (and is not)
appropriate.
Results: Researchers may conduct scoping reviews instead of systematic reviews where the purpose of the
review is to identify knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify concepts or to investigate research
conduct. While useful in their own right, scoping reviews may also be helpful precursors to systematic reviews
and can be used to confirm the relevance of inclusion criteria and potential questions.
Conclusions: Scoping reviews are a useful tool in the ever increasing arsenal of evidence synthesis approaches.
Although conducted for different purposes compared to systematic reviews, scoping reviews still require rigorous
and transparent methods in their conduct to ensure that the results are trustworthy. Our hope is that with clear
guidance available regarding whether to conduct a scoping review or a systematic review, there will be less scoping
reviews being performed for inappropriate indications better served by a systematic review, and vice-versa.
Keywords: Systematic review, Scoping review, Evidence-based healthcare
Background
Systematic reviews in healthcare began to appear in pub-
lication in the 1970s and 1980s [1, 2]. With the emer-
gence of groups such as Cochrane and the Joanna Briggs
Institute (JBI) in the 1990s [3], reviews have exploded in
popularity both in terms of the number conducted [1],
and their uptake to inform policy and practice. Today,
systematic reviews are conducted for a wide range of
purposes across diverse fields of inquiry, different evi-
dence types and for different questions [4]. More re-
cently, the field of evidence synthesis has seen the
emergence of scoping reviews, which are similar to sys-
tematic reviews in that they follow a structured process,
however they are performed for different reasons and
have some key methodological differences [5–8]. Scop-
ing reviews are now seen as a valid approach in those
circumstances where systematic reviews are unable to
meet the necessary objectives or requirements of know-
ledge users. There now exists clear guidance regarding
the definition of scoping reviews, how to conduct scop-
ing reviews and the steps involved in the scoping review
process [6, 8]. However, the guidance regarding the key
indications or reasons why reviewers may choose to fol-
low a scoping review approach is not as straightforward,
with scoping reviews often conducted for purposes that
do not align with the original indications as proposed by
Arksey and O’Malley [5–10]. As editors and peer re-
viewers for various journals we have noticed that there
is inconsistency and confusion regarding the indications

 for scoping reviews and a lack of clarity for authors re-
garding when a scoping review should be performed as
opposed to a systematic review. The purpose of this art-
icle is to provide practical guidance for reviewers on
when to perform a systematic review or a scoping re-
view, supported with some key examples.
Indications for systematic reviews
Systematic reviews can be broadly defined as a type of
research synthesis that are conducted by review groups
with specialized skills, who set out to identify and re-
trieve international evidence that is relevant to a particu-
lar question or questions and to appraise and synthesize
the results of this search to inform practice, policy and
in some cases, further research [11–13]. According to
the Cochrane handbook, a systematic review ‘uses expli-
cit, systematic methods that are selected with a view to
minimizing bias, thus providing more reliable findings
from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions
made.’ [14] Systematic reviews follow a structured and
pre-defined process that requires rigorous methods to
ensure that the results are both reliable and meaningful
to end users. These reviews may be considered the pillar
of evidence-based healthcare [15] and are widely used to
inform the development of trustworthy clinical guide-
lines [11, 16, 17].
A systematic review may be undertaken to confirm or
refute whether or not current practice is based on rele-
vant evidence, to establish the quality of that evidence,
and to address any uncertainty or variation in practice
that may be occurring. Such variations in practice may
be due to conflicting evidence and undertaking a sys-
tematic review should (hopefully) resolve such conflicts.
Conducting a systematic review may also identify gaps,
deficiencies, and trends in the current evidence and can
help underpin and inform future research in the area.
Systematic reviews can be used to produce statements to
guide clinical decision-making, the delivery of care, as
well as policy development [12]. Broadly, indications for
systematic reviews are as follows [4]:
1. Uncover the international evidence
2. Confirm current practice/ address any variation/
identify new practices
3. Identify and inform areas for future research
4. Identify and investigate conflicting results
5. Produce statements to guide decision-making
Despite the utility of systematic reviews to address the
above indications, there are cases where systematic reviews
are unable to meet the necessary objectives or require-
ments of knowledge users or where a methodologically ro-
bust and structured preliminary searching and scoping
activity may be useful to inform the conduct of the
systematic reviews. As such, scoping reviews (which are
also sometimes called scoping exercises/scoping studies)
[8] have emerged as a valid approach with rather different
indications to those for systematic reviews. It is important
to note here that other approaches to evidence synthesis
have
also
emerged,
including
realist
reviews,
mixed
methods reviews, concept analyses and others [4, 18–20].
This article focuses specifically on the choice between a
systematic review or scoping review approach.
Indications for scoping reviews
True to their name, scoping reviews are an ideal tool to
determine the scope or coverage of a body of literature
on a given topic and give clear indication of the volume
of literature and studies available as well as an overview
(broad or detailed) of its focus. Scoping reviews are use-
ful for examining emerging evidence when it is still un-
clear what other, more specific questions can be posed
and valuably addressed by a more precise systematic re-
view [21]. They can report on the types of evidence that
address and inform practice in the field and the way the
research has been conducted.
The general purpose for conducting scoping reviews is
to identify and map the available evidence [5, 22]. Arskey
and O’Malley, authors of the seminal paper describing a
framework for scoping reviews, provided four specific
reasons why a scoping review may be conducted [5–7,
22]. Soon after, Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien further
clarified and extended this original framework [7]. These
authors acknowledged that at the time, there was no
universally recognized definition of scoping reviews nor
a commonly acknowledged purpose or indication for
conducting them. In 2015, a methodological working
group of the JBI produced formal guidance for conduct-
ing scoping reviews [6]. However, we have not previously
addressed and expanded upon the indications for scop-
ing reviews. Below, we build upon previously described
indications and suggest the following purposes for con-
ducting a scoping review:
� To identify the types of available evidence in a given
field
� To clarify key concepts/ definitions in the literature
� To examine how research is conducted on a certain
topic or field
� To identify key characteristics or factors related to a
concept
� As a precursor to a systematic review
� To identify and analyse knowledge gaps
Deciding between a systematic review and a
scoping review approach
Authors deciding between the systematic review or
scoping review approach should carefully consider the
Munn et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:143 
Page 2 of 7
 indications discussed above for each synthesis type and
determine exactly what question they are asking and
what purpose they are trying to achieve with their re-
view. We propose that the most important consideration
is whether or not the authors wish to use the results of
their review to answer a clinically meaningful question
or provide evidence to inform practice. If the authors
have a question addressing the feasibility, appropriate-
ness, meaningfulness or effectiveness of a certain treat-
ment or practice, then a systematic review is likely the
most valid approach [11, 23]. However, authors do not
always wish to ask such single or precise questions, and
may be more interested in the identification of certain
characteristics/concepts in papers or studies, and in the
mapping, reporting or discussion of these characteris-
tics/concepts. In these cases, a scoping review is the bet-
ter choice.
As scoping reviews do not aim to produce a critically
appraised and synthesised result/answer to a particular
question, and rather aim to provide an overview or map
of the evidence. Due to this, an assessment of methodo-
logical limitations or risk of bias of the evidence in-
cluded
within
a
scoping
review
is
generally
not
performed (unless there is a specific requirement due to
the nature of the scoping review aim) [6]. Given this as-
sessment of bias is not conducted, the implications for
practice (from a clinical or policy making point of view)
that arise from a scoping review are quite different com-
pared to those of a systematic review. In some cases,
there may be no need or impetus to make implications
for practice and if there is a need to do so, these implica-
tions may be significantly limited in terms of providing
concrete guidance from a clinical or policy making point
of view. Conversely, when we compare this to systematic
reviews, the provision of implications for practice is a
key feature of systematic reviews and is recommended
in reporting guidelines for systematic reviews [13].
Exemplars for different scoping review indications
In the following section, we elaborate on each of the in-
dications listed for scoping reviews and provide a num-
ber of examples for authors considering a scoping
review approach.
To identify the types of available evidence in a given field
Scoping reviews that seek to identify the types of evi-
dence in a given field share similarities with evidence
mapping activities as explained by Bragge and colleagues
in a paper on conducting scoping research in broad
topic areas [24]. Chambers and colleagues [25] con-
ducted a scoping review in order to identify current
knowledge translation resources (and any evaluations of
them) that use, adapt and present findings from system-
atic reviews to suit the needs of policy makers. Following
a comprehensive search across a range of databases,
organizational websites and conference abstract reposi-
tories based upon predetermined inclusion criteria, the
authors identified 20 knowledge translation resources
which they classified into three different types (over-
views, summaries and policy briefs) as well as seven
published and unpublished evaluations. The authors
concluded that evidence synthesists produce a range of
resources to assist policy makers to transfer and utilize
the findings of systematic reviews and that focussed
summaries are the most common. Similarly, a scoping
review was conducted by Challen and colleagues [26] in
order to determine the types of available evidence identi-
fying the source and quality of publications and grey lit-
erature for emergency planning. A comprehensive set of
databases and websites were investigated and 1603 rele-
vant sources of evidence were identified mainly address-
ing
emergency
planning
and
response
with
fewer
sources concerned with hazard analysis, mitigation and
capability assessment. Based on the results of the review,
the authors concluded that while there is a large body of
evidence in the field, issues with its generalizability and
validity are as yet largely unknown and that the exact
type and form of evidence that would be valuable to
knowledge users in the field is not yet understood.
To clarify key concepts/definitions in the literature
Scoping reviews are often performed to examine and
clarify definitions that are used in the literature. A scop-
ing review by Schaink and colleagues27 was performed
to investigate how the notion of “patient complexity”
had been defined, classified, and understood in the exist-
ing literature. A systematic search of healthcare data-
bases
was
conducted.
Articles
were
assessed
to
determine whether they met the inclusion criteria and
the findings of included articles were grouped into five
health dimensions. An overview of how complexity has
been described was presented, including the varying def-
initions and interpretations of the term. The results of
the scoping review enabled the authors to then develop
a complexity framework or model to assist in defining
and understanding patient complexity [27].
Hines et al. [28] provide a further example where a
scoping review has been conducted to define a concept, in
this case the condition bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The
authors revealed significant variation in how the condition
was defined across the literature, prompting the authors
to call for a ‘comprehensive and evidence-based defin-
ition’. [28]
To examine how research is conducted on a certain topic
Scoping reviews can be useful tools to investigate the de-
sign and conduct of research on a particular topic. A
scoping review by Callary and colleagues29 investigated
Munn et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:143 
Page 3 of 7
 the methodological design of studies assessing wear of a
certain type of hip replacement (highly crosslinked poly-
ethylene acetabular components) [29]. The aim of the
scoping review was to survey the literature to determine
how data pertinent to the measurement of hip replace-
ment wear had been reported in primary studies and
whether the methods were similar enough to allow for
comparison across studies. The scoping review revealed
that the methods to assess wear (radiostereometric ana-
lysis) varied significantly with many different approaches
being employed amongst the investigators. The results
of the scoping review led to the authors recommending
enhanced standardization in measurements and methods
for future research in this field [29].
There are other examples of scoping reviews investi-
gating research methodology, with perhaps the most
pertinent examples being two recent scoping reviews of
scoping review methods [9, 10]. Both of these scoping
reviews investigated how scoping reviews had been re-
ported and conducted, with both advocating for a need
for
clear
guidance
to
improve
standardization
of
methods [9, 10]. Similarly, a scoping review investigating
methodology was conducted by Tricco and colleagues30
on rapid review methods that have been evaluated, com-
pared, used or described in the literature. A variety of
rapid review approaches were identified with many in-
stances of poor reporting identified. The authors called
for prospective studies to compare results presented by
rapid reviews versus systematic reviews.
To identify key characteristics or factors related to a
concept
Scoping reviews can be conducted to identify and exam-
ine characteristics or factors related to a particular
concept. Harfield and colleagues (2015) conducted a
scoping review to identify the characteristics of indigen-
ous primary healthcare service delivery models [30–32].
A systematic search was conducted, followed by screen-
ing and study selection. Once relevant studies had been
identified, a process of data extraction commenced to
extract characteristics referred to in the included papers.
Over 1000 findings were eventually grouped into eight
key factors (accessible health services, community par-
ticipation, culturally appropriate and skilled workforce,
culture, continuous quality improvement, flexible ap-
proaches to care, holistic health care, self-determination
and empowerment). The results of this scoping review
have been able to inform a best practice model for indi-
genous primary healthcare services.
As a precursor to a systematic review
Scoping reviews conducted as precursors to systematic
reviews may enable authors to identify the nature of a
broad field of evidence so that ensuing reviews can be
assured of locating adequate numbers of relevant studies
for inclusion. They also enable the relevant outcomes
and target group or population for example for a par-
ticular intervention to be identified. This can have par-
ticular practical benefits for review teams undertaking
reviews on less familiar topics and can assist the team to
avoid undertaking an “empty” review [33]. Scoping re-
views of this kind may help reviewers to develop and
confirm their a priori inclusion criteria and ensure that
the questions to be posed by their subsequent systematic
review are able to be answered by available, relevant evi-
dence. In this way, systematic reviews are able to be
underpinned by a preliminary and evidence-based scop-
ing stage.
A scoping review commissioned by the United King-
dom Department for International Development was
undertaken to determine the scope and nature of litera-
ture on people’s experiences of microfinance. The results
of this scoping review were used to inform the develop-
ment of targeted systematic review questions that fo-
cussed upon areas of particular interest [34].
In their recent scoping review on the conduct and
reporting of scoping reviews, Tricco and colleagues10 re-
veal only 12% of scoping reviews contained recommen-
dations for the development of ensuing systematic
reviews, suggesting that the majority of scoping review
authors do not conduct scoping reviews as a precursor
to future systematic reviews.
To identify and analyze gaps in the knowledge base
Scoping reviews are rarely solely conducted to simply
identify and analyze gaps present in a given knowledge
base, as examination and presentation of what hasn’t
been investigated or reported generally requires exhaust-
ive examination of all of what is available. In any case,
because scoping reviews tend to be a useful approach for
reviewing evidence rapidly in emerging fields or topics,
identification and analysis of knowledge gaps is a com-
mon and valuable indication for conducting a scoping
review. A scoping review was recently conducted to re-
view current research and identify knowledge gaps on
the topic of “occupational balance”, or the balance of
work, rest, sleep, and play [35]. Following a systematic
search across a range of relevant databases, included
studies were selected and in line with predetermined in-
clusion criteria, were described and mapped to provide
both an overall picture of the current state of the evi-
dence in the field and to identify and highlight know-
ledge gaps in the area. The results of the scoping review
allowed the authors to illustrate several research ‘gaps’
,
including the absence of studies conducted outside of
western societies, the lack of knowledge around peoples’
levels of occupational balance, as well as a dearth of evi-
dence regarding how occupational balance may be

 enhanced. As with other scoping reviews focussed upon
identifying and analyzing knowledge gaps, results such
as these allow for the identification of future research
initiatives.
Discussion
Scoping reviews are now seen as a valid review approach
for certain indications. A key difference between scoping
reviews and systematic reviews is that in terms of a review
question, a scoping review will have a broader “scope”
than traditional systematic reviews with correspondingly
more expansive inclusion criteria. In addition, scoping re-
views differ from systematic reviews in their overriding
purpose. We have previously recommended the use of the
PCC mnemonic (Population, Concept and Context) to
guide question development [36]. The importance of
clearly defining the key questions and objectives of a scop-
ing review has been discussed previously by one of the au-
thors, as a lack of clarity can result in difficulties
encountered later on in the review process [36].
Considering their differences from systematic reviews,
scoping reviews should still not be confused with trad-
itional literature reviews. Traditional literature reviews
have been used as a means to summarise various publi-
cations or research on a particular topic for many years.
In these traditional reviews, authors examine research
reports in addition to conceptual or theoretical literature
that focuses on the history, importance, and collective
thinking around a topic, issue or concept. These types of
reviews can be considered subjective, due to their sub-
stantial reliance on the author’s pre-exiting knowledge
and experience and as they do not normally present an
unbiased, exhaustive and systematic summary of a topic
[12]. Regardless of some of these limitations, traditional
literature reviews may still have some use in terms of
providing an overview of a topic or issue. Scoping re-
views provide a useful alternative to literature reviews
when clarification around a concept or theory is re-
quired. If traditional literature reviews are contrasted
with scoping reviews, the latter [6]:
� Are informed by an a priori protocol
� Are systematic and often include exhaustive
searching for information
� Aim to be transparent and reproducible
� Include steps to reduce error and increase reliability
(such as the inclusion of multiple reviewers)
� Ensure data is extracted and presented in a
structured way
Another approach to evidence synthesis that has
emerged recently is the production of evidence maps
[37]. The purpose of these evidence maps is similar to
scoping reviews to identify and analyse gaps in the
knowledge base [37, 38]. In fact, most evidence mapping
articles cite seminal scoping review guidance for their
methods [38]. The two approaches therefore have many
similarities, with perhaps the most prominent difference
being the production of a visual database or schematic
(i.e. map) which assists the user in interpreting where
evidence exists and where there are gaps [38]. As
Miake-Lye states, at this stage ‘it is difficult to determine
where one method ends and the other begins.’ [38] Both
approaches may be valid when the indication is for de-
termining the extent of evidence on a particular topic,
particularly when highlighting gaps in the research.
A further popular method to define and scope con-
cepts, particularly in nursing, is through the conduct of
a concept analysis [39–42]. Formal concept analysis is ‘a
process whereby concepts are logically and systematic-
ally investigated to form clear and rigorously constructed
conceptual definitions,’ [42] which is similar to scoping
reviews where the indication is to clarify concepts in the
literature. There is limited methodological guidance on
how to conduct a concept analysis and recently they
have been critiqued for having no impact on practice
[39]. In our opinion, scoping reviews (where the purpose
is to systematically investigate a concept in the litera-
ture) offer a methodologically rigorous alternative to
concept analysis with their results perhaps being more
useful to inform practice.
Comparing and contrasting the characteristics of trad-
itional literature reviews, scoping reviews and systematic
reviews may help clarify the true essence of these differ-
ent types of reviews (see Table 1).
Rapid reviews are another emerging type of evidence
synthesis and a substantial amount of literature have ad-
dressed these types of reviews [43–47]. There are various
definitions for rapid reviews, and for simplification pur-
poses, we define these review types as ‘systematic re-
views with shortcuts.’ In this paper, we have not
discussed the choice between a rapid or systematic re-
view approach as we are of the opinion that perhaps the
major consideration for conducting a rapid review (as
compared to a systematic or scoping review) is not the
purpose/question itself, but the feasibility of conducting
a full review given financial/resource limitations and
time pressures. As such, a rapid review could potentially
be conducted for any of the indications listed above for
the scoping or systematic review, whilst shortening or
skipping entirely some steps in the standard systematic
or scoping review process.
There is some overlap across the six listed purposes
for conducting a scoping review described in this paper.
For example, it is logical to presume that if a review
group were aiming to identify the types of available evi-
dence in a field they would also be interested in identify-
ing and analysing gaps in the knowledge base. Other
Munn et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:143 
Page 5 of 7
 combinations of purposes for scoping reviews would also
make sense for certain questions/aims. However, we
have chosen to list them as discrete reasons in this paper
in an effort to provide some much needed clarity on the
appropriate purposes for conducting scoping reviews. As
such, scoping review authors should not interpret our
list of indications as a discrete list where only one pur-
pose can be identified.
It is important to mention some potential abuses of
scoping reviews. Reviewers may conduct a scoping re-
view as an alternative to a systematic review in order to
avoid the critical appraisal stage of the review and ex-
pedite the process, thinking that a scoping review may
be easier than a systematic review to conduct. Other re-
viewers may conduct a scoping review in order to ‘map’
the literature when there is no obvious need for ‘map-
ping’ in this particular subject area. Others may conduct
a scoping review with very broad questions as an alter-
native to investing the time and effort required to craft
the necessary specific questions required for undertaking
a systematic review. In these cases, scoping reviews are
not appropriate and authors should refer to our guid-
ance regarding whether they should be conducting a sys-
tematic review instead.
This article provides some clarification on when to
conduct a scoping review as compared to a systematic
review and clear guidance on the purposes for conduct-
ing a scoping review. We hope that this paper will pro-
vide a useful addition to this evolving methodology and
encourage others to review, modify and build upon these
indications as the approach matures. Further work in
scoping review methods is required, with perhaps the
most important advancement being the recent develop-
ment of an extension to the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
for scoping reviews [48] and the development of soft-
ware and training programs to support these reviews
[49, 50]. As the methodology advances, guidance for
scoping reviews (such as that included in the Joanna
Briggs Institute Reviewer’s Manual) will require revision,
refining and updating.
Conclusion
Scoping reviews are a useful tool in the ever increasing ar-
senal of evidence synthesis approaches. Researchers may
preference the conduct of a scoping review over a system-
atic review where the purpose of the review is to identify
knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify con-
cepts, investigate research conduct, or to inform a system-
atic review. Although conducted for different purposes
compared to systematic reviews, scoping reviews still re-
quire rigorous and transparent methods in their conduct
to ensure that the results are trustworthy. Our hope is that
with clear guidance available regarding whether to conduct
a scoping review or a systematic review, there will be less
scoping reviews being performed for inappropriate indica-
tions better served by a systematic review, and vice-versa.
