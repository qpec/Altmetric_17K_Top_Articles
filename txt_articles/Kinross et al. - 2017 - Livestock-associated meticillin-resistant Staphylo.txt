Currently, surveillance of livestock-associated meti-
cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in 
humans in Europe is not systematic but mainly event-
based. In September 2014, the European Centre for 
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) initiated a ques-
tionnaire to collect data on the number of LA-MRSA 
from human samples (one isolate per patient) from 
national/regional reference laboratories in European 
Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries 
in 2013. Identification of LA-MRSA as clonal complex 
(CC) 398 by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was 
preferred, although surrogate methods such as spa-
typing were also accepted. The questionnaire was 
returned by 28 laboratories in 27 EU/EEA countries. 
Overall, LA-MRSA represented 3.9% of 13,756 typed 
MRSA human isolates, but it represented ≥ 10% in five 
countries (Belgium, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands 
and Slovenia). Seven of the reference laboratories did 
not type MRSA isolates in 2013. To monitor the dis-
persion of LA-MRSA and facilitate targeted control 
measures, we advocate periodic systematic surveys or 
integrated multi-sectorial surveillance.
Introduction 
Staphylococcus aureus colonises the anterior nares of 
nearly all domesticated animals and ca 30% of humans 
[1-5]. 
Livestock-associated 
meticillin-resistant 
S. 
aureus (LA-MRSA) poses a zoonotic risk, particularly 
for those working in close contact with livestock [6]. 
The highest livestock densities in European Union/
European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries in 2013 
were in Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, 
and Luxembourg), Nordic countries (Denmark and 
Norway) and Mediterranean islands (Cyprus and Malta) 
[7]. Several lineages of LA-MRSA have been described 
[8-10]. The most widespread LA-MRSA lineage in Europe 
and North America is clonal complex (CC) 398 including 
multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST398, which is com-
monly associated with swine, but has also been iden-
tified in cattle and poultry [5,8,11]. Carriage of MRSA 
CC398 is common in individuals with frequent livestock 
contact, such as swine farmers and people living in 
areas with high livestock density [2,11]. The impact of 
this carriage on otherwise healthy persons appears to 
be low and LA-MRSA infections have a similar severity 
to that of other MRSA infections [2,11].
In 2014, the death of four individuals from LA-MRSA 
CC398 in Denmark led to considerable political and 
media attention in Nordic countries and the European 
Parliament regarding the potential burden of LA-MRSA 
in pigs and humans [12]. The risk management options 
for LA-MRSA include the identification of transmission 
chains to interrupt transmission. In addition, consist-
ently wearing face masks when working in pig stables 
has been shown to lower MRSA carriage rates by 37% 
[13].

the EU/EEA is included under the ‘special health issue’ 
of ‘Antimicrobial resistance’ [14]. The European Centre 
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) coordinates 
European surveillance of MRSA through the European 
Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-
Net), which collects national clinical laboratory data on 
invasive MRSA isolates in EU/EEA countries. However, 
subtyping information that would allow for identifica-
tion of LA-MRSA isolates is not collected as part of the 
routine antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance at 
the European level [15].
A survey conducted in 2006 to 2007 of 357 hospital-
serving laboratories in 26 European countries did 
not identify LA-MRSA among invasive MRSA isolates 
from humans [3]. In 2007, a survey acquired data on 
MRSA and LA-MRSA, including screening samples from 
21 staphylococcal reference laboratories in 15 coun-
tries. Eight countries reported LA-MRSA isolates from

humans, including clinical isolates; the proportion of 
MRSA that were LA-MRSA was above 2% in four coun-
tries and in one region in Germany [16].
In 2010, a survey of 29 European countries showed that 
19 had a system for surveillance of MRSA, of which 10 
had mandatory reporting of MRSA cases [17]. The most 
frequently used typing methods were DNA sequenc-
ing of the repeat region of the S. aureus protein A 
gene (spa-typing; n = 25), PFGE (n = 24), staphylococcal 
cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing (n = 24), 
multilocus sequence typing (MLST; n = 20), toxin gene 
profiling (n = 17) and multiple-loci variable number 
tandem repeat analysis (MLVA; n = 6) [17,18]. A labora-
tory-based system ‘Nordic MRSA’ contains comprehen-
sive spa, MLST and Pantone-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) 
data on isolates typed in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, 
Sweden and Norway from 2009 to 2014 and is updated 
regularly [19].
The inter-laboratory reproducibility of spa-typing in 
Europe has been long-established [1,4]. In 2010, 24 of 
29 European staphylococcal reference laboratories had 
access to equipment for spa-typing [17]. MLST is cur-
rently considered one of the gold standards in molecu-
lar typing techniques to investigate the evolution of S. 
aureus [20,21]. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is 
rapidly replacing MLST for more in-depth study of S. 
aureus, including its evolution [22,23].
In 2011, ECDC recruited 360 laboratories serving 450 
hospitals in 26 European countries to assess the fea-
sibility of linking clinical, epidemiological and spa-
typing data from S. aureus blood stream infections 
during a six-month investigation period. The common 
view of the participating European staphylococcal 
reference laboratories was that acquisition of linked 
clinical, epidemiological and typing data was not 
feasible due to the differences in national sampling 
strategies, the paucity of information provided by 
clinicians on laboratory request forms and the absence 
of ‘a systematic and consistent identification (through 
internationally agreed identifiers) of hospitals and 
diagnostic laboratories’ [17,18]. Therefore, monitor-
ing and assessing the public health threat posed by 
LA-MRSA in Europe relies on microbiological con-
firmations, rather than epidemiological case-based 
surveillance.
Given the sparse information available at the European 
level on the occurrence of LA-MRSA in humans, 
ECDC initiated this study to map the identification of 
LA-MRSA (i.e. CC398 and ‘other’ LA-MRSA) in EU/EEA 
countries and the MRSA subtyping capacity/availability 
in EU/EEA national/regional reference laboratories. The 
study also aimed to describe the detected LA-MRSA 
according to their site of isolation.
Methods 
Survey tool
A retrospective survey collected data on LA-MRSA sub-
types identified among MRSA isolates from humans 
by national or regional reference laboratories between 
1 January and 31 December 2013. The questionnaire 
requested data on the first MRSA-positive clinical sam-
ple collected from patients in 2013; screening sam-
ples (i.e. carriage) were also accepted. ‘All samples’ 
includes both clinical and screening samples. It then 
requested both the number of MRSA isolates that were 
ST398 and also the number that were ‘other LA-MRSA’. 
As not all reference laboratories perform MLST, the 
questionnaire included a list of spa types considered 
surrogates for ST398 and also accepted ‘PFGE non-
typeable strains (similar to MRSA ST398)’ as such.
The first 12 questions of the questionnaire requested 
quantitative data within three sections: A. Denominator 
data (i.e. the catchment population of the laboratory, 
supplemented by Eurostat mid-2013 population esti-
mates during analysis), the included sample type (i.e. 
clinical isolates or all isolates) and the microbiological 
typing method(s) used; B. Numerator data (e.g. total 
patients from whom a MRSA isolate was received, one 
isolate per patient during 2013); and C. the type of 
sample/body site from which the patient’s first posi-
tive MRSA isolate was obtained in 2013 (i.e. blood, 
wound, urine, respiratory tract, skin or mucosa, and

other clinical samples including isolates for which the 
body site was unknown). The questionnaire concluded 
with section D. containing two free text descriptions of 
(i) ‘other’ typing method and (ii) the MRSA subtypes 
considered by respondents to be ‘other LA-MRSA’. Chi-
squared tests were used to evaluate differences in the 
rate of isolation of MRSA between sub-categories of 
type of sample/body site of the sample.
The questionnaire was a direct update of that of the 
2007 survey [16], with only two changes: the addition 
of the microbiological typing method ‘other’ to section 
A. and collection of data on ‘other LA-MRSA types’, 
i.e. distinct from CC398, to sections B. and C.. The 
updated questionnaire was pilot tested in three coun-
tries (Denmark, France and Italy). The list of ST398-
surrogate spa types was subsequently updated (Box 1) 
and provided with the revised questionnaire. All three

participants in the pilot survey required less than two 
hours to acquire the necessary data. 
Identification of national contact persons.
In November 2014, ECDC National Focal Points for 
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in all 28 EU countries 
plus Iceland and Norway were invited to designate a 
primary and alternate contact person with expertise in 
molecular surveillance of MRSA for public health pur-
poses and with access to data for the survey in their 
respective countries. The questionnaire was emailed 
to the nominated contact persons, or to the countries’ 
National Focal Point for AMR if no contact person was 
designated.
Results 
Responses and catchment area
Twenty-eight reference laboratories from 27 of 30 EU/
EEA countries responded, 26 of which were national 
reference laboratories (NRLs) and two were regional ref-
erence laboratories. All respondents provided annual 
data for 2013, except Romania (data only provided for 
23 October 2013 to 24 December 2013) (Figure 1).
Data for the United Kingdom (UK) were only received 
for England (54 of the 64 million population). Data for 
Slovenia were received for 1.7 of the 2.1 million popu-
lation. Two university hospitals in Greece (population 
11.1 million) returned data for their respective catch-
ment areas: Thessalia (population 1.2 million) and 
Patras (population 1.0 million). Even though the ques-
tionnaire did not request this information, nine coun-
tries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Italy, 
Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain) indicated that 
their data were not nationally representative and/or 
non-systematic without further quantifying. Several of 
these respondents did qualify the non-representative-
ness. For example, in Belgium, laboratories are invited 
to send outbreak-causing strains to the NRL and are

most likely to do so if the epidemiological context is 
unusual (e.g. including animal contact).
MRSA typing data availability
Nine laboratories provided data from clinical samples 
only and 12 laboratories sent aggregated data from 
both clinical and screening samples. Seven countries 
(Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Malta and Slovakia) reported that no MRSA typing 
was performed in 2013, of which five (Croatia, Cyprus, 
Latvia, Malta and Slovakia) indicated that no typing 
was performed in their country (Table 1).
MRSA typing method
Spa-typing was the most widely used MRSA typ-
ing method in the responding reference laboratories 
(n = 21), followed by MLST (n = 15), PFGE (n = 11) and 
‘other’ (n = 9) (Table 1). The majority of these laborato-
ries had spa-typing available for routine use (n = 14/21), 
while MLST was only used routinely in Portugal (Figure 
2).
Typing of MRSA isolates
Overall, respondents reported receiving MRSA isolates 
from 14,291 patients in 2013, of which 13,756 (96.3%) 
were typed (Table 1).
LA-MRSA, both ST398 and other types, was identified 
by 17 of 19 countries with typing data (i.e. all participat-
ing countries that performed subtyping in 2013 except 
for Iceland and Portugal). The Netherlands, Denmark 
and Spain reported the largest numbers of LA-MRSA 
isolates (n = 164, 157 and 52, respectively; Table 
1, Figure 3).
Overall, the percentage of typed MRSA isolates that 
were LA-MRSA was 3.9% (n = 535/13,756). For the nine 
NRLs that reported data from clinical samples only (i.e. 
excluding screening samples), this percentage was 
9.0% (n = 417/4,612). In five NRLs (Belgium, Denmark, 
Spain, the Netherlands and Slovenia), LA-MRSA repre-
sented ≥ 10% typed MRSA isolates (Table 1).
Sweden also assessed the PVL status of its 14 MRSA 
that had an ST398-surrogate spa type and three of 
these were PVL-positive (all spa type t034), such that 
they were therefore not considered to be livestock-
associated. England reported that 11 of the 14 MRSA 
CC398 identified belonged to the ‘human-adapted’ 
rather than ‘livestock-adapted’ clade as they were 
positive for PVL and/or immune evasion cluster-positive 
and/or tetracycline susceptible. This assignment was 
confirmed through WGS (personal communication, 
Angela M Kearns, January 2015). Poland assessed that 
the detected MRSA ST398 isolate was spa type t034 
and PVL-negative, belonging to a ‘livestock-adapted’ 
clade that was immune evasion cluster-positive and 
tetracycline-resistant (personal communication, Joanna 
Empel, May 2016).
Other LA-MRSAs
Almost all LA-MRSA isolates were CC398 (n = 533/535, 
99.7%). Ten countries explicitly reported zero ‘other 
LA-MRSA’. Only Italy specified the non-CC398 subtypes 
that they considered to be LA-MRSA, i.e. two ST1 (t127) 
isolates from paediatric nasal screening samples.
Type of sample/body site of microbiological 
samples
The most common type of sample/body site for 
LA-MRSA-positive clinical samples was ‘other’, i.e. iso-
lates from body sites/tissues other than blood, wound, 
urine, the respiratory tract, skin, mucosa and unknown 
data (n = 127/401, 32%). Of these 127 isolates, 117 were 
reported by Denmark. The next most common type of 
sample/body site for positive clinical samples were 
wound and respiratory tract, both 25% (Table 2, Figure 
4). 
Overall, a greater proportion of LA-MRSA were iso-
lated (p < 0.001) from clinical respiratory tract sam-
ples (n = 99/401, 25%) than were non-LA-MRSA 
(n = 345/3,737, 9%). Eighty-seven (88%) of these 99 
LA-MRSA from clinical respiratory tract samples were 
reported by Denmark and the Netherlands. Inversely, a 
smaller proportion of LA-MRSA from all samples were 
isolated (p < 0.001) from blood samples (n = 20/514, 4%) 
than were non-LA-MRSA (n = 1,225/13 880, 9%) (Table 
2). When considering only clinical samples, a smaller 
proportion of LA-MRSA were isolated (p < 0.001) from 
skin or mucosa samples (n = 25/401, 6%) than were 
non-LA-MRSA (n = 678/3,737, 18%) (Table 2).
Discussion 
The high response rate in the survey is indicative of 
the perceived public health importance of LA-MRSA 
for EU/EEA countries. In a similar survey of 2007 data, 
only seven of 15 European countries reported LA-MRSA 
isolates. In the current survey of 2013 data, LA-MRSA

isolates were reported in all but two of the 20 coun-
tries that had MRSA typing data. Moreover, seven of 
11 countries that participated in both surveys identi-
fied an increase in the proportion of MRSA that were 
LA-MRSA (CC398) [16]. Notably, in 2013 five geograph-
ically-dispersed European NRLs reported that more 
than one in 10 typed MRSA isolates were LA-MRSA. In 
Iceland (population 320,000), LA-MRSA was reported 
in either in the 2007 nor the 2013 survey, although two 
cases of MRSA CC398 were subsequently reported in 
2014 [16,19].
CC398 remained the dominant LA-MRSA lineage of 
public health concern. Indeed, only one country listed 
another lineage that they considered to be LA-MRSA, 
ST1. Although the survey invited national respondents 
to use their considered expert opinion to specify non-
ST398 lineages of LA-MRSA, it is possible that some 
non-ST398 LA-MRSA were misclassified as being non-
LA-MRSA in some countries.
At least three countries performed additional labora-
tory tests to differentiate between ‘human-adapted’ 
and ‘livestock-adapted’ CC398 clades, e.g. by testing for 
PVL, presence of the immune evasion complex, tetracy-
cline susceptibility and by WGS, all of which are also 
used by public health laboratories in the United States 
[5,24,25]. Detection of single-nt polymorphisms (SNPs) 
for scn and tet(M) genes, by WGS for example, is also 
appropriate to differentiate between human-associated 
and livestock-associated clades, respectively [26].
Given the apparent upward trend and more widespread 
dispersion of MRSA CC398 in Europe, the absence of 
MRSA typing in NRLs in seven countries in 2013 is of 
concern. Of these seven countries, the Czech Republic 
and Latvia (n = 20 and n = 8 laboratories, respectively) 
did provide aggregated spa type data in a 2011 
subtyping pilot study in 26 European countries [18]. 
The Czech respondent confirmed that MLST and spa-
typing were performed on MRSA isolates from blood 
samples up until 2011, while Latvia was considering 
including MRSA typing in their updated national AMR 
action plan and Cyprus had no plan to initiate typing. 
In 2014, Croatia’s NRL received 140 MRSA isolates and 
all were characterised by spa, PVL, SCCmec typing and 
phenotypic susceptibility testing. None of the spa types 
were ST398 surrogates.
As in other surveys, LA-MRSA isolates were less likely 
to originate from blood than other MRSA isolates 
[13,16]. Fewer clinical samples skin or mucosa samples 
were positive for MRSA than ‘all samples’ as the lat-
ter included screening samples. The frequent detection 
of MRSA from respiratory tract samples relates to its 
prevalence in nares and the common use of this body 
site for screening.
More than half the countries that responded provided 
data on ‘all samples’ rather than solely clinical sam-
ples. It is suspected that the contribution of screening 
samples to the collated data are likely to have been 
sizable given that in 2013, clinical isolates comprised 
157 of 643 (24%) MRSA ST398 in Denmark and 10 of 
47 (21%) MRSA ST398 reported by Norway, with the 
remainder being screening samples (personal com-
munication, Kjersti W Larssen and Petter Elstrøm, May 
2016), [19,27].
The current study did not aim to provide information 
on the contribution of local and regional laboratories to 
national typing, although the contribution of the latter 
may have been notable in some European countries. 
For example, the Italian NRL provided typing data for

all MRSA isolates including screening samples, none 
of which were ST398. This contrasts with a multidis-
ciplinary investigation conducted in 2012–2013 in an 
Italian region where MRSA ST398 was identified from 
screening samples from rabbit holdings, including the 
holding’s workers and their relatives [28]. Systematic 
characterisation in 2010–2011 of all MRSA strains in a 
hospital in Lombardy, the region of Italy with the high-
est density of pig farming, identified MRSA ST398 in 5 
of 879 nasal swabs and an isolate from otitis externa 
[29]. Spain’s NRL reported 52 LA-MRSA isolates in this 
current survey, explicitly stating that isolate ascertain-
ment was neither nationally comprehensive nor sys-
tematic. In 2012–2013, a hospital in Catalonia reported 
11 LA-MRSA ST398 [30]. Germany’s NRL reported 28 
MRSA CC398 from clinical samples in 2013, while the 
University Hospital Münster, which has a catchment 
area with a high pig density in north-western Germany 
bordering the Netherlands, identified 267 MRSA ST398 
cases in 2013, including 13 from clinical samples. 
Systematic screening of patients for MRSA carriage at 
admission to this hospital showed an increasing pro-
portion of LA-MRSA carriers, from a first detection in 
2000 to 19% and 35% of MRSA-positive screening sam-
ples in 2007 and 2013, respectively [31]. A case–control 
study of this hospital’s patients in 2013–2014 identi-
fied that 62% of MRSA CC398 cases reported direct 
livestock contact [32]. In 2014, this hospital detected 
MRSA ST398 in 202 admitted patient’s screening sam-
ples [31].
Since this survey of 2013 data, additional reports 
have indicated a continuing spread of LA-MRSA across 
Europe. The ‘Nordic MRSA’ database [15] identified 
the first detection of MRSA ST398 in Iceland in 2014 
(n = 2) and an increase in MRSA ST398 detections 
between 2013 and 2014 in Denmark (from n = 643 to 
n = 1,276) and in Finland (n = 4 to n = 16). It also iden-
tified a decrease in Norway (n = 47 to n = 27). Not all 
MRSA ST398 in this database were livestock-associ-
ated (LA-MRSA). For example, the NRL in Sweden con-
sidered that only 10 of 13 MRSA ST398 in 2013 and 20 
of 24 MRSA ST398 in 2014 were LA-MRSA, as they were 
also PVL-negative [19].
In Denmark, 43% of 2,965 human MRSA isolates 
(screening and clinical samples) in 2014 were ST398, 
with 89% of individuals reporting direct contact with 
pigs or being secondary contacts [33]. In Germany, a 
national multidisciplinary survey conducted between 
2012 and 2015 in 17 equine hospitals and 39 veterinary 
practices identified MRSA ST398 in nasal swabs from 
82.7% of 272 equine isolates and 19.2% of 349 indi-
viduals working with horses. Most isolates shared the 
same strain-type that was rarely found in the human 
databases of the NRL in Germany, implying direct trans-
mission [34]. At a show-jumping event in Luxembourg 
in 2014, clones of MRSA ST398, confirmed by WGS, 
were detected in food and in throat swabs from cater-
ing staff [35]. In Sweden in 2014, a national survey of 
nucleus and multiplier pigs did not identify MRSA while 
MRSA ST398 was identified in horses and in 21 human 
cases [36].
Public health surveillance in Denmark and the 
Netherlands has detected LA-MRSA transmission 
without livestock contact with increasingly frequency 
[37,38]. Using next-generation sequencing to character-
ise MRSA isolates from 2003 to 2014, the Netherlands 
identified distinct lineages of LA-MRSA becoming 
more human-adapted, disseminating into the com-
munity [38]. In Denmark, a nationwide, retrospective 
temporo-spatial analysis of samples from 1999 to 2011 
also showed that MRSA ST398 was capable of onward 
transmission in the community. The majority of indi-
viduals in the later years of the analysis had no live-
stock contact but were often clustered around those 
with livestock contact. There was little sign of substan-
tial spread of MRSA ST398 in urban areas [33,37]. In 
February 2015, the detection of MRSA ST398 in two 
pre-packaged, processed pork products purchased 
from UK supermarkets and marked as UK farm origin 
attracted considerable media attention [39]. These 
findings, along with sporadic reports of MRSA CC398 
from livestock, show that LA-MRSA is being increas-
ingly found in the UK [40].
As was known at the outset, the results of this present 
study are not generalisable to European clinical labora-
tories, so the relative numbers of LA-MRSA identified 
by responding laboratories are not directly comparable 
and do not necessarily represent the national LA-MRSA 
prevalence. Sweden and England reported almost half 
of the typed MRSA isolates in this study; therefore, 
their surveillance data are over-represented. In Europe, 
there is considerable variability in sampling, criteria for 
referral to NRLs and typing strategies between coun-
tries [18]. Indeed, several participating NRLs empha-
sised that referrals for typing were neither systematic 
nor nationally representative. For example, the pro-
portion of typed isolates that were associated with 
outbreak investigations and/or taken for clinical diag-
nostic purposes is unclear. Furthermore, the absence 
of reliably definable catchment areas for all laborato-
ries hampers useful estimation of national or European 
LA-MRSA burden.
Linkage of clinical to microbiological and epidemio-
logical data is not currently feasible in all European 
countries, removing the possibility of measuring the 
epidemiological association of cases with livestock 
[18]. Indeed, the majority of responding NRLs did not 
have data to differentiate clinical from total isolates. 
We therefore stratified analyses to compare cases with 
similar clinical impact. Additionally, because not all 
responding NRLs reported using subtype analysis to 
differentiate LA-MRSA within MRSA ST398, our study of 
ST398 may have overestimated the LA-MRSA burden.
The decision to omit a specific definition of ‘other 
LA-MRSA’ from the questionnaire was intended to 
provide the responding national experts with the 
 11
www.eurosurveillance.org
opportunity to interpret ‘other’ broadly. No NRLs 
reported detection of ST9 or ST72, which are regularly 
detected in Asia, or other well-recognised LA-MRSA 
subtypes, such as ST5 [8-10]. Our approach may have 
kept respondents from stating more contentious inter-
pretations of ‘livestock-associated’, resulting in an 
underestimation of the burden of less common non-
ST398 LA-MRSAs.
In North America, livestock-associated meticillin-sensi-
tive S. aureus (LA-MSSA) are more relevant for public 
health than LA-MRSA, including strains that are ST398 
[5,24,25]. However, collection of MSSA data were out-
side the scope of the present study and may be worthy 
subject for a similar survey in Europe.
Conclusions 
The high response rate for this survey is indicative of 
the perceived public health importance of LA-MRSA in 
EU/EEA countries. The selection of a surveillance period 
before the increased media attention in Nordic coun-
tries in 2014 hopefully contributed to the comparability 
of the European data in the present study. This survey 
documents the increasing detection and geographical 
dispersion of LA-MRSA in humans in the EU/EEA since 
2007, and highlights the public health and veterinary 
importance of LA-MRSA as a One Health issue. In the 
light of the increasing spread of LA-MRSA in Europe 
shown herein, we advocate that EU/EEA countries 
consider periodically repeating this survey to monitor 
changes. It is also suggested that isolates from vet-
erinary sources be included in such monitoring to sys-
tematically map potential reservoirs and transmission 
pathways, thereby informing measures for prevention 
and control. Wherever practicable, attempts should be 
made to differentiate between ‘human-adapted’ and 
‘livestock-adapted’ clades of MRSA CC398. European 
countries without this capability could consider other 
options, including cross-border collaborations, to char-
acterise their MRSA isolates. We would also encour-
age linkage of multi-sectorial, One Health MRSA data 
to improve understanding of transmission pathways as 
well as to enable appropriate targeting and monitoring 
of the effectiveness of control measures.
