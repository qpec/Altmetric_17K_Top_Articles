In Brief
Schwarz, Mangan et al. show that
navigating ants align their body forward
to recognize the familiar visual scene and
correct their travel direction. However,
ants can transfer this egocentric
directional information into a compass
frame of reference. Subsequently, they
can follow this direction independently of
their body orientation.

SUMMARY
Ants can navigate over long distances between their
nest and food sites using visual cues [1, 2]. Recent
studies show that this capacity is undiminished
when walking backward while dragging a heavy
food item [3–5]. This challenges the idea that ants
use egocentric visual memories of the scene for
guidance [1, 2, 6]. Can ants use their visual memories
of the terrestrial cues when going backward? Our re-
sults suggest that ants do not adjust their direction of
travel based on the perceived scene while going
backward. Instead, they maintain a straight direction
using their celestial compass. This direction can be
dictated by their path integrator [5] but can also be
set using terrestrial visual cues after a forward
peek. If the food item is too heavy to enable body
rotations, ants moving backward drop their food on
occasion, rotate and walk a few steps forward, return
to the food, and drag it backward in a now-corrected
direction defined by terrestrial cues. Furthermore, we
show that ants can maintain their direction of travel
independently of their body orientation. It thus ap-
pears that egocentric retinal alignment is required
for visual scene recognition, but ants can translate
this acquired directional information into a holo-
nomic frame of reference, which enables them to
decouple their travel direction from their body orien-
tation and hence navigate backward. This reveals
substantial flexibility and communication between
different types of navigational information: from
terrestrial to celestial cues and from egocentric to
holonomic directional memories.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our experiment was conducted near Seville, in the natural envi-
ronment of the desert ant Cataglyphis velox. We buried barriers
around an active nest to constrain the foragers to navigate along
a one-way route of our design (Figure 1A). The barriers did not
interfere with the view perceived by the ants, with the surround-
ing scenery clearly visible. A feeder with small pieces of cookie
was provided to motivate the ants to run (forward) along our
route, which included several 90� turns and baffles to regulate
the ant paths. Each forager reaching the feeder was painted
with a unique color code and was allowed to travel on the sepa-
rated outbound and inbound routes to and from the feeder until
the full route was learned sufficiently well to avoid collisions with
the barriers or baffles. Experienced ants were then subjected to
one of three test conditions in which we recorded their heading
direction after 40 cm of travel.
Backward-Walking Ants Follow Their Path Integrator
Rather Than Their Visual Memories
We first tested how ants walking backward would negotiate a
sharp 90� turn along their familiar route. We captured experi-
enced ants after they had run 3 m along the first leg of the
outbound route (Figure 1A, CP1). They had thus accumulated a
path integrator (PI) homing vector of 3 m pointing southward.
Ants were transferred in the dark one by one, provided with either
a small or a large food item, and released on a homebound leg of
the route in front of a funnel-shaped baffle (Figure 1A, RP1). At
the release point, the route pointed southward but, immediately
after the funnel, presented a 90� turn right. We recorded their
heading direction at 40 cm after exiting the funnel.
Upon release, the ants carrying a small cookie, and thus able to
walk forward, initially dashed southward but then displayed a
sharp right turn at the exit of the funnel, pursuing the familiar route
westward rather than following the direction indicated by their PI
(Figure 1B, Forward; see Movie S1). Ants provided with a large
cookie behaved differently. The large cookie was too heavy to
be lifted, and these ants struggled for several seconds before
eventually starting to drag it backward, as observed in other
species [3, 4, 7]. We only analyzed the paths where the ants
continuously dragged the cookie backward (i.e., ants with antero-
posterior orientation within ±45� awayfrom the direction of travel).
Their initial direction pointed southward, too; however, at the exit
of the baffle, these backward-walking ants continued southward,
as indicated by their PI, and apparently uninfluenced by their
memoryofvisual terrestrialcues(Figure 1B, Backward;seeMovie
S1). When looking at their bearings 40 cm after the baffle, the dif-
ference between the forward and backward group was striking. In
fact, backward-walking ants behaved similarly whether released
on their familiar route or in a completely unfamiliar location (Fig-
ure S1B). It is known that backward-walking ants can follow their
PI [5], but our results additionally suggest that they are uninflu-
enced by the learned scenery of the route.

 Backward-Walking Zero-Vector Ants Do Not Use the
Learned Visual Scenery on a Familiar Route
Our first experiment showed that backward-walking ants are
guided by PI and are not influenced by terrestrial cues, but might
they rely on the visual scenery in the absence of a PI home vec-
tor? We note, for example, that in Ardin et al. [3], displaced back-
ward-walking ants with a somewhat shorter PI vector did not
follow their PI, but homed to the nest. To test for this, we
captured ants trained to our route a few centimeters before
they reached their nest (Figure 1A, CP2)—that is, as zero-vector
ants (ZV). We removed the small cookie that these ants were
carrying and, as previously, provided them instead with either
a big or small piece of cookie to induce backward or forward mo-
tion, respectively. This time, the ants were released further along
the route within a lampshade that blocked the view of the sur-
rounding scenery (Figure 1A, RP2). Ants were allowed to walk
for 10 cm in their chosen direction before the shade was lifted
to reveal the familiar scenery. Forward-running ants displayed
initially undirected headings but adjusted their course toward
the correct route direction as soon as the shade was lifted (Fig-
ure 1C). In contrast, the big-cookie backward-dragging ants did
not orient toward the route direction when the shade was lifted
(Figure 1C), despite the familiar visual scenery.
Although not the main focus of our study, it is interesting to
note that the direction taken by backward-walking ZV ants was
not random. We were surprised to find that they aimed, rather
consistently, southwest, a direction that corresponds to the
feeder-to-nest compass direction. This was clearly apparent
after 40 cm of travel, and even seemed to be the case at
10 cm, when they were within the lampshade (Figure 1C) from
which only the sky was visible, suggesting that this direction is
based on a celestial compass memory. Ants are known to store
such celestial compass-based vectors in long-term [8] or
medium/short-term memories [9], and it appears that in this
unfamiliar situation, the ZV backward ants recovered and used
such a vector to set their direction.
Backward-Walking Zero-Vector Ants Do Not Use the
Visual Scenery at a Novel Release Point
It has been suggested that ants may use different visual strate-
gies when on route, compared to novel locations off the route
[6, 10, 11]. Ants displaced off their route can use the surrounding

route depict baffles, and gray goniometer sketches indicate test locations. Arrowheads indicate the theoretical directions tested in (B)–(D), as indicated by the
path integration vector (black) and the correct route direction (gray). Note that backward zero-vector (ZV) ants appeared to be oriented toward the feeder-to-nest
compass direction (open arrowhead). Dashed arrows indicate capture (CP) or release (RP) points, and the panoramic images illustrate the scenery, as perceived
from the RPs. Images were taken with a Sony Bloggie, unwrapped and processed as in [6]. RP1: lower image represents view before baffle and upper image view
after baffle. RP2,3: lower and upper images represent views with and without lampshade. Note that the sky was still visible even with the lampshade in place; only
terrestrial visual cues were covered.

direction (open arrowhead) at 10 cm (only D) and 40 cm.

theoretical directions (arrowheads) indicate p < 0.001 against this direction as mean of the group distribution (S test, a non-parametric sign test for circular data,

 scenery to guide their path directly toward the nest (or the
familiar route) across novel terrain [6, 12, 13], as in models of vi-
sual homing [6, 14, 15]. Perhaps backward-walking ants cannot
use on-route strategies because it requires forward body align-
ment [2, 16–19] but can nonetheless use off-route strategies.
To test this, we repeated the previous experiment with the lamp-
shade, but this time ZV ants were released off route, at a novel
location (relative to their normal return route) �2 m to the side
of their nest (Figure 1A, RP3). Again, small-cookie forward-
walking ants corrected their heading toward the nest when the
lampshade was lifted (Figure 1D), showing that they could use
their memory of visual terrestrial cues to home from this novel
location. Backward-walking ants, however—as before—did
not move in the correct home direction but instead walked in
the feeder-to-nest compass direction and maintained that direc-
tion when the visual scenery was revealed (Figure 1D). That is,
they failed to use the visual scenery to correct their heading
toward the nest.
Ants Can Peek Forward to Set a Direction, Which They
Then Maintain Backward
If backward-walking ants do not use their memory of the visual
terrestrial cues, how can we explain their ability to home suc-
cessfully after being displaced to novel locations [3]? Pfeffer
and Wittlinger [5] noticed that ants walking backward on unfamil-
iar terrain occasionally dropped their food and searched around
before grabbing the food again. The authors noted that after
these searches some ants were more precisely oriented along
the feeder-to-nest direction. We were interested in investigating
whether ants might obtain information from the visual scenery
during such maneuvers. In our various experiments, roughly
one-third of our recorded ZV ants dropped their food items
and hence were not included in our previous analysis. These
ants (n = 13) displayed on our recording board what we will
call here a ‘‘peeking behavior’’: they stopped dragging, dropped
their cookie, turned around, took a few steps forward, turned
around, came back, grabbed the cookie again, and resumed
their backward motion—but this time along the route direction,
as taken by the forward ants (Figure 2; see Movie S2).
The peeking behavior is not stereotypical but varies across sit-
uations. Within the familiar surroundings of our setup, ants left
their cookie only for a short period of time (mean ± SD =
3.5 s ± 1.9 s) and displayed only a few steps forward (maximum
distance: mean ± SD = 4.2 cm ± 1.7 cm). In contrast, ants display
longer and tortuous searches in unfamiliar terrain, as observed in
Cataglyphis fortis [5]. Ants also sometimes attempted to face for-
ward with the food still in their mandibles, which, it appears, also
enables them to use their visual memories to adjust their walking
direction (Figure S1C). Such ‘‘glances back’’ could explain how
Myrmecia ants achieved ‘‘backward’’ homing [3] (Figure S2).
Note that none of the full vector (FV) ants we observed dropped
their cookie. This is different to Pfeffer and Wittlinger’s observa-
tion and might be due to our short period of observation. In gen-
eral, it seems clear that ants with shorter PI homing vectors are
more prone to display peeking behavior ([5] and Figure S2).
This could be because of the greater angular uncertainty of short
PI vectors [20] or because information from the visual scene (or
odors) is needed to pinpoint the exact nest location. Exactly
how many peeks would be required to recapitulate a route or
pinpoint the nest remains unknown.
Interestingly, the few steps forward displayed during the peek-
ing behaviors (in familiar surroundings) were oriented along the
correct route direction (Figure 2). Such a need to turn around
and face the route direction supports the idea that obtaining
directional information from terrestrial cues is an egocentric pro-
cess [2, 6, 10, 13, 17, 18, 21–25], where ants must align their view
to match their egocentric memories of the visual landscape.
Crucially, however, the direction obtained by this egocentric pro-
cess while facing forward can subsequently be maintained while
going backward (Figure 2). Thus, ants must somehow be able to
transfer the directional information based on terrestrial cues into
a different frame of reference, which we investigate next.
Backward-Walking Ants Use Their Celestial Compass to
Maintain a Straight Course
It is notable in all the above experiments that ants walking back-
ward maintained a straight course, even after peeking. Moving
straight is not a trivial task [26–28], particularly given the chaotic
step movements involved in ant backward locomotion [4]. In the-
ory, maintaining a straight path can be achieved in multiple ways:
by using proprioceptive information, rotational optic flow, or
celestial cues, or by memorizing the scene perceived (on adopt-
ing the backward course) to hold a good match while moving.
We decided to test whether ants maintain their backward
Figure 2. Peeking Behavior Enables Ants to Adjust Their Direction of
Travel
Angular error (angle away from the homing direction) of the direction of
backward travel 10 cm before and 10 cm after the peeking behavior. ‘‘Forward
during peek’’ corresponds to the direction of the furthest location away from
the dropped cookie reached by the ant during peeking behavior. Each line
corresponds to an individual ant (p values correspond to a paired sign tests).
Circular histograms show travel directions relative to the route direction
(arrowhead), with mean vector of the distribution (arrow) and 95% confidence
intervals (black circles). Numbers in circular sectors correspond to the number
of observations for this direction. Filled stars within the histograms depict
significantly oriented distributions (Rayleigh tests: before peek, p = 0.159;
peek, p < 0.001; after peek, p < 0.001). Lower sketches illustrate an example of
a peeking behavior sequence (dashed arrows depict direction of travel; see
also Movie S2).

 direction through celestial cues, as do dung beetles when push-
ing their dung ball backward with their hind legs [29–31]. We
used a century-old method: mirroring the sun so that it appeared
to be in the opposite half of the sky while hiding the direct sun
with an opaque board [32]. We waited for a rather overcast day
to limit the effect of blue sky polarization [33, 34] and performed
the manipulation when the sun was clearly visible. As soon as the
sun was mirrored, backward-walking ants displayed a turn and
moved in a different direction (Figure 3A). This was true for
both FV and ZV ants and whether before or after peeking, as
long as ants were not walking forward. As observed in previous
sun mirror manipulations [32, 34], the turns displayed here by

(natural) sun conditions, and solid lines represent path sections with the sun mirrored by 180� compared to the ant position. Small arrows indicate the direction of
the sun’s position in the sky, and black circles the start of the paths. The mirror manipulation was applied in backward-walking full-vector ants (vector direction
indicated by open arrowhead) and zero-vector ants before or after the ant had displayed a peeking behavior. The circular histograms show the relative distribution
of the travel direction of path segments sampled at two frames/s under direct natural sun (gray) and mirrored sun (white). The two associated vectors indicate the
mean vector of the circular distributions; the x and y axis length indicate a vector norm of 1.
(B) The angle turned by each individual (gray dots) is greater as a response to the manipulative change in sun direction than it is before or after the change,
indicating the use of a celestial compass. As depicted, individual paths were divided into four successive vectors of 8 cm each: two before the manipulation
(b2, b1) and two after (a1, a2). Angles turned correspond to the absolute angular difference between the vectors (before: jqb2 b1j; during: jqb1 a1j; after: jqa1 a2j).

(C) Example paths of single ants, traveling forward (with a small food item), backward, or in a combination of different body orientations (‘‘mixed,’’ with a big food
item). Head position (black dots) and head-to-tail orientation (black dashes) were extracted from the recorded paths (GoPro cameras) at five frames/s. Circular
histograms show distributions of the ants’ body orientations relative to their direction of travel (travel direction – body orientation), computed as the change in
location of the ants’ head from the current frame to the next (i.e., backward: BWD; forward: FWD; sideways: SWD; see also Movie S3). No correlation between
body orientation and direction of travel could be found for the mixed ants (circular-circular correlation, 0.13 < r < �0.11, p > 0.324).
(D) Distributions of directions of travel (path segments sampled at five frames/s of mixed ants shown in Figure 3C) for different categories of body orientations
show that ants can maintain an overall path direction (aligned at zero) independently of their body orientation. Dashed lines indicate the mean direction expected if
the ants were pulling backward. Filled and open dots indicate the means for the FV and ZV ants, respectively (see also Figure S2 for a similar analysis and result
with Myrmecia data).

 backward-walking ants were not exactly 180�. This may be due
to the conflicting influence of the remaining blue sky polarization,
which suggests that a variety of celestial cues are involved.
It seems clear that backward-walking ants use their celestial
compass to maintain a straight course. This does not refute
the possibility that self-motion or stabilization based on terres-
trial cues can be used too; however, celestial cues dominate.
Ants Can Maintain a Direction of Travel Independently of
their Body Orientation
Some of the ants dragging their large food item backward
managed nonetheless to rotate their body around while keeping
the food in their jaws (Figure 3C). These were removed from our
previous analysis because they did not travel solely backward.
Interestingly, these ants revealed their ability to decouple their
direction of travel from their current body orientation (see Fig-
ure S1C for the direction taken by these ants). That is, they could
maintain an absolute direction of travel whether moving back-
ward, forward, or sideways or rotating in any other intermediary
body orientation (Figure 3C; Movie S3). In other words, this
shows that ants’ directional memories can be stored and
retrieved within a holonomic frame of reference. In robotics,
‘‘holonomic’’ means that all degrees of freedom (x,y and the
body orientation q) are controllable, so the system can be
reduced to its position in space (the body orientation q is inte-
grable). For instance, holonomic wheels are wheels that, like
ants, can move in any direction independently of their orienta-
tion. In the vertebrate literature, this may be referred to as an
‘‘allocentric directional’’ reference frame [35]. We performed a
similar analysis using a dataset from previously published work
on the distantly related Myrmecia ants [3] and obtained compa-
rable results (Figure S2D). Similarly, flying hymenoptera can fly
sideways to maintain a compass direction despite cross-wind
[36], suggesting that this ability has evolved before the origin of
the ant taxa.
Such a holonomic system is ideal to integrate multiple sources
of directional information, as any directional input added to the
system can be taken into account independently of the insect’s
current body orientation. This not only explains how a direction
obtained when facing forward (e.g., during peeking) can subse-
quently be followed backward using celestial cues, but also how
ants can integrate egocentrically perceived wind directions [37]
or steer an intermediate course when the direction indicated
by terrestrial cues and path integration are set in conflict
[20, 38–41].
Neurobiological Implication
It is interesting to consider the implications for the neural cir-
cuitry underlying navigation [42]. The central complex has
been closely implicated in storing directional memories [43],
tracking body orientation from self-motion cues [44, 45], and us-
ing celestial cues as an external frame of reference [43, 46, 47].
The central complex thus possesses all the ingredients neces-
sary to integrate directional memories into a holonomic frame
of reference [42]. By contrast, a current hypothesis for visual
scene orientation is that it involves the comparison, by retino-
topic alignment, of the current egocentric view to egocentric
visual scene memories [2]: a function that can be plausibly map-
ped to the mushroom bodies [42, 48]. The ability of ants, as
shown here, to recover a direction using egocentric visual route
memories (when peeking forward) and subsequently follow that
direction using celestial cues independently of their body orien-
tation would then require a transfer of information, whether
direct or indirect, from the mushroom body to the central com-
plex. To date, surprisingly few connections between these
distinctive neuropils have been observed, but they could be
crucial to understanding navigation. Indeed, it may be more
appropriate to consider these brain areas as supporting
complementary computational processes, which can flexibly
interact to achieve complex navigational tasks, rather than
distinct behavioral competencies [42].
Conclusions
Ant navigation is often described as a tool kit of distinct
behavioral strategies, in which the use of celestial and terrestrial
cues (apart, perhaps, from wind [37, 49, 50]) are processed by
independent modules weighted by simple rules and gated by
simple motivational control [51–53]. The current results depict
a different story: ants walking backward must assess their accu-
mulating uncertainty and eventually drop their cookie to peek
forward for the time necessary to recover a direction; and this
direction, obtained by egocentric, rotationally dependent pro-
cesses based on memories of terrestrial visual cues, can be in-
tegrated (together with other directional information such as
the PI vector) in a holonomic frame of reference and followed
independently of the body orientation using the celestial com-
pass. Whether these two processes (i.e., peeking forward to
gather information using memories of the visual scene or moving
along the computed direction using the celestial compass) are
always achieved sequentially, or can be achieved simulta-
neously and continuously, remains to be seen. In any case, stra-
tegies of different kinds mingle, and navigational behavior
appears to be a product of remarkably flexible control.
