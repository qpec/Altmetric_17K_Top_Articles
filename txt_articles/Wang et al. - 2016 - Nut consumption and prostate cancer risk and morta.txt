Background: Little is known of the association between nut consumption, and prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and survivorship.
Methods: We conducted an incidence analysis and a case-only survival analysis in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study on the
associations of nut consumption (updated every 4 years) with PCa diagnosis, and PCa-specific and overall mortality.
Results: In 26 years, 6810 incident PCa cases were identified from 47 299 men. There was no association between nut consumption
and being diagnosed with PCa or PCa-specific mortality. However, patients who consumed nuts five or more times per week after
diagnosis had a significant 34% lower rate of overall mortality than those who consumed nuts less than once per month (HR ¼ 0.66,
95% CI: 0.52–0.83, P-trend ¼ 0.0005).
Conclusions: There were no statistically significant associations between nut consumption, and PCa incidence or PCa-specific
mortality. Frequent nut consumption after diagnosis was associated with significantly reduced overall mortality.
Nuts are rich in bioactive macronutrients, micronutrients, tocopher-
ols and phytochemicals (Ros et al, 2010). Current epidemiological
evidence has consistently linked increased nut consumption to
reduced risk of several chronic conditions including cardiovascular
diseases, type 2 diabetes, and inflammation (Ros, 2010; Afshin et al,
2014). In contrast, evidence on nut consumption and cancer risk has
been insufficient and equivocal (Gonza
´lez and Salas-Salvado
´, 2007).
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the leading cancer among US men (Siegel
et al, 2015), with B220 800 new PCa cases diagnosed in 2015
(American Cancer Society, 2015). Studies regarding nut intake
and PCa incidence are limited and have reported inconsistent results
(Mills et al, 1989; Hebert et al, 1998; Jain et al, 1999; Raimondi et al,
2010). Furthermore, few studies have investigated nut intake
in relation to survival among PCa patients and in one that has
the associations were suggestive, but not statistically significant
(Richman et al, 2013). Thus, in the current study, we prospectively
examined nut consumption in relation to PCa incidence and
PCa-specific mortality in a large cohort of male health professionals.

Study population. The Health Professionals Follow-up Study
(HPFS) is a prospective cohort study of US male health
professionals established in 1986 (Kenfield et al, 2014). After
exclusion criteria, the final incidence analysis included 47 299 men
and the final case-only survival analysis included 4346 PCa patients
without metastasis at diagnosis, followed through January 2012.
Assessment of dietary and non-dietary factors. Participants com-
pleted a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) at baseline and every 4 years thereafter. They were asked how

 often they consumed a serving (serving size, 28g (1oz)) of peanuts and
other nuts during the preceding year. Total nut consumption was
defined as the sum of peanut and other nut consumption. A validation
study of the FFQ indicated that nuts were reported reasonably
accurately (Salvini et al, 1989). We also obtained information on other
lifestyle factors and medical history.
Ascertainment of PCa. PCa diagnosis was confirmed with
medical records and pathology reports. Family reports and
National Death Index searches were used to identify deaths. We
examined hazard ratios (HR) with respect to the following
categories of PCa: total (excluding T1a cancers), advanced, lethal,
fatal, low-grade (Gleason score 2–6) and high-grade (Gleason
scoreX7). Advanced PCa was defined as stage T3b, T4, N1, or M1
at diagnosis, or lymph node metastases, distant metastases, or PCa
death during follow-up. Lethal cancer, the primary focus of our
study, was defined as cases that metastasised to distant organs at
diagnosis or over follow-up, or that caused PCa death. Fatal
cancers were defined as those that caused PCa death. We also
investigated post-diagnostic nut intake in relation to development
of lethal PCa, fatal PCa, and all-cause mortality among men
diagnosed with localised or regional PCa (clinical stage T1–T3a).
Statistical analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used
to estimate HR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
PCa incidence analysis. Men were followed from return of baseline
questionnaire until diagnosis, death, or 31 January 2012. Nut
consumption was presented as a cumulative average from 1986
to end of follow-up. In secondary analyses, we assessed interactions
by ethnicity, age, and BMI, added a 2-year lag period between nut-
intake assessment and each follow-up period, and further examined
baseline nut intake in relation to being diagnosed with PCa.
Case-only survival analysis. For lethal PCa, men were followed
from PCa diagnosis to metastases. For fatal PCa, men were followed
from PCa diagnosis to death from PCa. For all-cause mortality,
men were followed from PCa diagnosis until death by any cause or
31 January 2012. Nut consumption was presented as a cumulative

 average from the date of diagnosis to end of follow-up. The FFQ
immediately preceding diagnosis was used to classify the partici-
pants’ diet from the diagnosis date until the next available FFQ,
because it would better capture diet at the time of diagnosis without
the diagnosis having affected diet. Similar secondary analyses to
those above were performed. In addition, we included pre-diagnostic
nut consumption from the 1986 FFQ in the multivariable models to
mitigate the influence of pre-diagnostic diet.
RESULTS
Nut consumption and PCa incidence. During 26 years of follow-
up, 6810 men were diagnosed with PCa. At baseline, men with
higher nut consumption exercised more, took more vitamin
supplements, had higher Mediterranean diet scores and drank
more alcohol (Supplementary Table 1).
Nut consumption was not associated with being diagnosed with
PCa (Table 1). Similarly, no significant associations were observed
between peanut or other nut consumption and PCa incidence (data
not shown). The null effect association remained unchanged when
baseline nut intake was used as the main exposure, or after a 2-year
lag period was added between nut-intake assessment and each
follow-up period (data not shown). No significant interactions by
age, BMI, or ethnicity were identified (all P interactions 40.05).
Nut consumption and mortality in PCa patients. Among
the 4346 men diagnosed with non-metastatic PCa, 359 cases of
lethal PCa, 264 cases of fatal PCa, and 1285 total deaths were
identified. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.8 years for lethal
PCa and 10.3 years for fatal PCa. Compared with non-consumers,
patients with higher nut consumption were more likely to take
vitamin supplements, less likely to have high blood pressure,
consumed more alcohol, olive oil, and tomatoes, and had a higher
Mediterranean diet score (Supplementary Table 2).
There were no statistically significant associations between nut
consumption after diagnosis and development of lethal or fatal
PCa (Table 2). But patients who consumed nuts five or more times
per week had a 34% lower rate of overall mortality compared with
those who consumed less than once per month (HR: 0.66, 95%
CI: 0.52–0.83, P for trend ¼ 0.0005); (Table 2). We also observed
a statistically significant difference in overall survival across nut-
intake categories (Po0.0004, Supplementary Figure 1).
Further adjustment for pre-diagnostic baseline nut consumption
or adding a 2-year lag period did not alter these findings (data not
shown). No significant interactions by age, BMI, or ethnicity were
identified (all P interactions 40.05). Although we observed no
associations of peanuts or other nuts separately with lethal or fatal
PCa, the HRs for total mortality were 0.70 (95% CI: 0.52–0.95;
P for trend ¼ 0.003) for other nuts and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.59–1.06;
P for trend ¼ 0.01) for peanuts, comparing five or more servings
per week with less than once per month.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study to prospectively
assess the association of nut consumption with being diagnosed with
PCa, including subtypes of aggressive PCa. Our null effect results with
PCa incidence are consistent with those of the Adventists Health
Study (180 PCa cases and 6-year follow-up) (Mills et al, 1989),
although they did not examine different subtypes of PCa. In contrast,
two case–control studies reported inverse associations (Jain et al,
1999; Raimondi et al, 2010). However, case–control studies are prone

 to recall bias and do not have long-term and repeated measures
of dietary intake. In addition, Jain et al, (1999) combined nuts
with beans and lentils, which could also explain the difference in
results.
We observed a reasonably large, albeit non-significant, HR
of 0.62 between post-diagnosis nut consumption and fatal outcome
among PCa patients. This is consistent with a recent study that
found an 18% lower rate of lethal PCa (HR, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.67–1.01) per daily serving increase of nut intake after diagnosis
(Richman et al, 2013). In addition, our finding of a significant 34%
rate reduction in overall mortality is consistent with other
prospective studies, Richman et al, (2013) included, which have
found inverse associations between nuts and mortality, with HRs
ranging from 0.61 to 0.87 (Bao et al, 2013; Guasch-Ferre
´ and Bullo
´,
2013; Richman et al, 2013; Hshieh et al, 2015; Luu et al, 2015).
Our study suggests that nuts, although not associated with being
diagnosed with PCa, may still improve the overall survival of PCa
patients. Among PCa patients in the HPFS, cardiovascular disease was
the leading cause of death, accounting for nearly one-third of the deaths
(Richman et al, 2013; Kenfield et al, 2014). Large cohort studies have
consistently shown that increased nut consumption was associated with
reduced cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality (Hu, 2003; Kelly
and Sabate
´, 2007; Kris-Etherton et al, 2008). Nuts are dense in nutrients
and bioactive compounds that may confer cardio-protective, anti-
inflammatory, and antioxidant properties (Kris-Etherton et al, 2008;
Bao et al, 2013). Furthermore, nuts are rich in monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated fats, and replacement of carbohydrates and animal fat
with either unsaturated fats has been shown to reduce all-cause
mortality and lethal outcomes among men with non-metastatic PCa
(Richman et al, 2013).
The strengths of this study include its prospective design, large
sample size, long follow-up time with excellent retention, and
repeated measurement of diet and lifestyle factors. We were also
able to reduce random measurement error by averaging nut intake
cumulatively from multiple time points. However, there may still
be residual confounding, although we adjusted extensively for risk
factors for PCa development and survivorship.
In conclusion, nut consumption was not associated with PCa
incidence or PCa-specific mortality in this large and prospective
cohort of men. However, frequent nut consumption was associated
with significantly lower overall mortality rate among men
diagnosed with non-metastatic PCa.
