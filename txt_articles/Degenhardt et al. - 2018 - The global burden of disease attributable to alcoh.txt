The global burden of disease attributable to alcohol and drug 
use in 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic 
analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Alcohol and Drug Use Collaborators*
Summary
Background Alcohol and drug use can have negative consequences on the health, economy, productivity, and social 
aspects of communities. We aimed to use data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2016 to calculate global and regional estimates of the prevalence of alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, 
and opioid dependence, and to estimate global disease burden attributable to alcohol and drug use between 1990 and 
2016, and for 195 countries and territories within 21 regions, and within seven super-regions. We also aimed to 
examine the association between disease burden and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles.
Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases for original epidemiological studies on alcohol 
and drug use published between Jan 1, 1980, and Sept 7, 2016, without language restrictions, and used DisMod-MR 
2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to estimate population-level prevalence of substance use disorders. We combined 
these estimates with disability weights to calculate years of life lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), 
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 1990–2016. We also used a comparative assessment approach to estimate 
burden attributable to alcohol and drug use as risk factors for other health outcomes.
Findings Globally, alcohol use disorders were the most prevalent of all substance use disorders, with 100·4 million 
estimated cases in 2016 (age-standardised prevalence 1320·8 cases per 100 000 people, 95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 
1181·2–1468·0). The most common drug use disorders were cannabis dependence (22·1 million cases; age-standardised 
prevalence 289·7 cases per 100 000 people, 95% UI 248·9–339·1) and opioid dependence (26·8 million cases; age-
standardised prevalence 353·0 cases per 100 000 people, 309·9–405·9). Globally, in 2016, 99·2 million DALYs (95% UI 
88·3–111·2) and 4·2% of all DALYs (3·7–4·6) were attributable to alcohol use, and 31·8 million DALYs (27·4–36·6) and 
1·3% of all DALYs (1·2–1·5) were attributable to drug use as a risk factor. The burden of disease attributable to alcohol 
and drug use varied substantially across geographical locations, and much of this burden was due to the effect of 
substance use on other health outcomes. Contrasting patterns were observed for the association between total alcohol 
and drug-attributable burden and SDI: alcohol-attributable burden was highest in countries with a low SDI and middle-
high middle SDI, whereas the burden due to drugs increased with higher SDI level.
Interpretation Alcohol and drug use are important contributors to global disease burden. Effective interventions 
should be scaled up to prevent and reduce substance use disease burden.

Introduction
Alcohol and other drugs have long been consumed for 
recreational 
purposes.1 
So-called 
illicit 
drugs 
are 
substances for which extramedical use has been prohibited 
under international control systems.2 Illicit drugs include, 
but are not limited to, opioids including heroin, morphine, 
opium, and other pharmaceutical opioids; cannabis; 
amphetamines; and cocaine. Harms can also occur due to 
extramedical use of prescription drugs. In this Article, we 
will refer to all use of drugs as drug use.
Dependence on illicit and prescription drugs can 
develop among people who use them regularly over a 
sustained period, and is characterised by a loss of control 
over use and increased prominence of use of the 
substance in a person’s life. The ICD 10th edition 
definition,3 which was broadly similar to the American 
Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV definition,4 requires 
that at least three of the following criteria are met: a 
strong desire to take the substance; impaired control over 
use; a withdrawal syndrome on ceasing or reducing use; 
tolerance to the effects of the drug; a disproportionate 
amount of time spent by the user obtaining, using, and 
recovering from drug use; and continuing to take drugs 
despite the problems that occur.
Substance use also carries risks of other adverse health 
outcomes. For example, injection of drugs carries risks if 
non-sterile injecting equipment is used, because of 
potential exposure to HIV and viral hepatitis, other

infections, and other injection-related injuries and 
diseases such as sepsis, thrombosis, and endocarditis.5 
Alcohol use increases the risk of unintentional and 
intentional 
injury, 
and 
both 
non-communicable 
(eg, cancer, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular) and 
infectious (eg, tuberculosis and pneumonia) diseases.1,6 
Use of both alcohol and drugs can cause harm to others.7
Since 1993, estimates of the causes of global disease 
burden have used disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs),8 
which combines measures of disease burden caused by 
premature mortality (years of life lost [YLLs]) and burden 
due to disability (years of life lived with disability [YLDs]). 
The comparative risk assessment approach developed for 
GBD provides a conceptual framework for population risk 
assessment of exposures to risk factors and their 
attributable health burden;9 alcohol and drugs are included 
as risk factors in this approach. Each iteration of GBD has 
updated estimates of modelled prevalence of alcohol and 
drug use disorders, burden due to those disorders, and 
burden attributable to alcohol and drug use. Improved 
methods are used in each iteration of GBD, with increased 
data coverage, and better strategies to inform the 
modelling that occurs in GBD. In this Article, we use data 
from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2016, to estimate the prevalence of 
alcohol and drug use disorders, and to calculate the 
burden attributable to alcohol and drug use globally and 
for 195 countries and territories within 21 regions and 
seven super-regions between 1990 and 2016. We present 
global and regional estimates of alcohol, amphetamine, 
cannabis, cocaine, and opioid use disorders; report disease 
burden attributable to each of these disorders in terms of 
YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs; summarise burden due to 
alcohol and drug use as risk factors for other health 
outcomes; and analyse the association between alcohol-
attributable and drug-attributable burden and Socio-
demographic Index (SDI) quintiles.
Methods
Overview
All GBD 2016 analyses adhered to the Guidelines for 
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO 
for epidemiological studies of prevalence, incidence, remission, 
duration, and excess mortality associated with substance use 
and substance dependence published between Jan 1, 1980, and 
Sept 7, 2016, without language restrictions. Full search terms 
are listed in the appendix. We also searched grey literature, and 
supplemented our search through consultation with experts. 
Previous Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies have provided 
evidence on overall burden attributable to alcohol and drug use 
and more detailed assessment of alcohol and drug use burden, 
but with each iteration of GBD, new data and improvements to 
methods provides better estimates of this burden. Other 
organisations, including WHO and the UN Office on Drugs and 
Crime, periodically produce estimates of health consequences 
of alcohol and drug use. This GBD study provides the first 
detailed peer-reviewed estimates of attributable burden due to 
both alcohol and drug use available for all locations between 
1990 and 2016, directly contrasting the prevalence and burden 
due to these different substances.
Added value of this study
We provide clear comparative analysis of alcohol and drug 
epidemiology and attributable burden. The results of this study 
show that considerable geographical variation exists with 
regard to the magnitude and relative contribution of alcohol 
and drug use to disease burden. To the best of our knowledge, 
this study is the first to provide estimates of the association 
between alcohol and drug attributable burden and 
sociodemographic development. Our results show that burden 
attributable to alcohol and drug use is strongly associated with 
socioeconomic development, and its composition varied across 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles. Other consequences 
of alcohol use were much larger causes of disease burden than 
alcohol use disorders, and many of these were much more 
common in countries with a lower SDI than those with higher 
SDIs. Drug-attributable burden was higher in countries with 
higher SDI than those with a lower SDI, and most of this burden 
was attributable to drug use disorder, rather than other 
consequences of drug use such as HIV/AIDS, acute hepatitis, 
liver cancer, cirrhosis and other liver disease due to hepatitis, 
or self-harm.
Implications of all the available evidence
Alcohol and drug use cause substantial disease burden globally, 
and the composition and extent of this burden varies between 
countries and is strongly associated with sociodemographic 
development. Since 1990, there has been a considerable increase 
in the number of people with alcohol and drug use disorders 
globally, driven by population growth and population ageing. 
Age-standardised prevalence also increased for opioid, cocaine, 
and amphetamine use disorders. The prevalence of substance use 
disorders varied substantially by substance and across countries, 
with clear differences between different geographical regions. 
Alcohol and drug use contribute substantially to the global 
burden of disease, not only through substance use disorders but 
also from other disease consequences resulting from use. For 
example, a high proportion of disease burden attributable to 
alcohol was due to other outcomes, including unintentional 
injuries and suicide, cancers, and cirrhosis, and the 
consequences of chronic hepatitis C infection (ie, cirrhosis, 
cancer) make a substantial contribution to the burden 
attributable to drug use. Interventions that reduce the 
prevalence of these other health outcomes are available and 
need to be scaled up, but this scaling remains a challenge even 
in high-resource settings.

(GATHER).10 A suite of visualisation tools is available to 
explore GBD data inputs and outputs. Full details of the 
overall methods used to assess disorder prevalence,11 
burden of disorders (YLDs),11 mortality (YLLs),12 overall 
substance use disorder burden (DALYs), calculated by the 
equation DALYs = YLLs + YLDs,13 and burden attributable 
to risk factors, including alcohol and drug use (comparative 
risk assessment)14 have been described previously.
Disease burden was quantified by geography, for 23 age 
groups (0–6 days to >95 years), both sexes, and six 
timepoints between 1990 and 2016. The GBD 2016 
geographical hierarchy included 775 total geographies 
within 195 countries and territories, within 21 regions 
and seven super-regions. Comprehensive methods used 
in GBD 2016 for estimating YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs have 
been described previously, and the process used to 
estimate prevalence-based YLDs, YLLS, and DALYs is 
described in the appendix (p 2).
Case definition of substance use disorders
Substance use disorders were defined according to 
DSM-IV4 and ICD-10.3 Six substance use disorders were 
included: opioid dependence, cocaine dependence, 
amphetamine dependence, cannabis depen 
dence, alcohol 
dependence, and fetal alcohol syndrome (a disorder that 
affects offspring due to maternal alcohol use during 
pregnancy).15 A residual category of other drug use 
disorders was also included.
YLLs
Input data on causes of death were obtained from vital 
registration, verbal autopsy, and surveillance databases 
from 1980 to 2016.16 Normative life tables were generated 
using data on the lowest death rates for each age group 
within geographies with total populations of more than 
5 million. YLLs were then estimated by multiplying 
cause-specific deaths at a specific age by the standard life 
expectancy at that age obtained from normative life 
tables. Full details of all the modelling processes have 
been published previously.16
The Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) 
strategy was used to model cause of death data by location, 
age, sex, and year for each substance use disorder.12 The 
CODEm outputs for all GBD causes were then rescaled to 
establish estimates consistent with all-cause mortality 
levels for each age, sex, year, and location. Deaths coded 
as alcohol and drug poisonings were attributed to the 
relevant alcohol and drug use disorders.
YLDs
We did systematic reviews of the literature to compile 
data on the prevalence, incidence, remission, and excess 
mortality associated with each disorder. We searched 
PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases and grey 
literature sources in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) 
guidelines.17 For each epidemiological parameter, eligible 
estimates were derived from studies published since 
1980. Datapoints are summarised for each disorder in 
the appendix (p 5) and the data input tools are available 
elsewhere.
The epidemiological data obtained from our systematic 
literature reviews were modelled in DisMod-MR 2.1,18 a 
Bayesian meta-regression tool that pools datapoints from 
different sources and adjusts for known sources of 
variability (eg, differences in case definitions and sampling 
method) to produce internally consistent estimates of 
incidence, prevalence, remission, and excess mortality 
(appendix pp 6–31). Estimates are generated for locations 
where raw data are unavailable using the modelled output 
from surrounding regions. According to the GBD 
protocol, an uncertain estimate is preferable to no 
estimate, even when data are sparse or not available, 
because no estimate would result in no health loss 
from that condition in the location being estimated. 
DisMod-MR 2.1 also uses both study-level and location-level 
covariates to better inform the epidemio 
logical models. 
Study-level covariates adjust suboptimal data toward those 
considered to be the gold standard (eg, adjusting data 
from population surveys of opioid dependence toward 
estimates from so-called indirect estimates of opioid 
dependence, which were preferred), whereas location-
level covariates help DisMod-MR 2.1 better predict 
disorder distribution. DisMod-MR 2.1 analyses ran in a 
sequence of estimations at each level of the GBD 
geographic hierarchy (global, super-region, region, 
country, and if applicable, subnational locations) with 
consistency imposed between estimates at each level.
Although our inclusion criteria ensured minimum 
study quality, considerable variability was identified 
between studies that reflected the use of different 
methods and analyses.19 Data availability varied across 
disorders and regions (appendix p 5). Uncertainty in 
both the epidemiological data and in modelling was 
propagated to the final prevalence output used to 
calculate YLDs in addition to the uncertainty from fixed 
effects and random effects for country and regions.18
Disability weights
We used disability weights to quantify the severity of the 
health loss associated with a particular disease or injury, 
and disability weights for each injury or disease were 
applied to the prevalence of that condition.
In this study, we used disability weights generated by 
the general public, on the basis of the argument that 
their views are relevant in comparative assessments that 
inform public policy.20,21
In GBD 2016, disability weights were obtained from 
population surveys in various different countries 
(Bangladesh, Indonesia, Peru, Tanzania, USA, Hungary, 
Italy, Sweden, and the Netherlands) and from an 
open-access survey available in multiple languages in 
which lay participants were presented with pairs of 
short non-clinical descriptions of the health states of

two hypothetical individuals and asked to rate which they 
considered healthier.20,22 Participant responses were 
scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 1 (0=no loss of health; 
1=loss equivalent to death) using a series of questions 
comparing the benefits of lifesaving and disease-
prevention programmes for a number of health states. 
The pair-wise comparisons showed the relative position 
of health states to each other, and this additional step in 
the analysis was necessary to anchor those relative 
positions as values on a 0 to 1 scale. Disability weights 
were generated for all sequelae of diseases and injuries 
included in GBD. Further details regarding the 
calculation of disability weights have been published 
previously.20,22 Each country-specific, age-specific, sex-
specific, and year-specific prevalence derived by 
DisMod-MR 2.1 was multiplied by a disorder-specific 
disability weight to estimate YLDs.
For each substance use disorder, we estimated the 
proportion of cases that were asymptomatic using data 
from the US National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol 
and Related Conditions (NESARC) for the time periods 
2000–01 and 2004–05,23 and the Australian Comorbidity 
and Trauma Study (CATS) for opioid dependence 
(2005–08).24,25 These proportions were used to calculate a 
mean disability weight for each disorder across the 
different levels of severity in which asymptomatic cases 
were assigned a disability weight of 0. For all substance 
use disorders in GBD 2016, we removed the proportion 
of diagnosed individuals who reported no additional 
disability at the time of the survey. The remaining pro-
portion of individuals represented so-called asymptomatic 
cases (ie, people with substance use disorders who 
experienced no disability due to their disorder).11
Comorbidity
The burden due to each cause in the GBD study was 
estimated separately. Since individuals might have more 
than one disease or injury at a specific timepoint, a 
simulation method was used to adjust for presence of 
comorbidity. The co-occurrence of different diseases and 
injuries was estimated by simulating populations of 
40 000 individuals in each GBD location stratified by 
age, sex, and year. Hypothetical individuals within each 
population were exposed to the independent probability of 
having any combination of sequelae included in GBD 2016. 
The probability of being exposed to a sequela corresponded 
to its prevalence in the population. A combined disability 
weight to account for individuals with more than one 
condition was calculated by combining the disability 
weights, with the health loss associated with two disability 
weights multiplied together and then a weighted average 
of each constituent disability weight was calculated. The 
so-called GBD comorbidity correction was the difference 
between the average disability weight estimated for 
individuals with one sequela and the combined disability 
weight estimated for those with multiple sequelae. The 
average comorbidity correction estimated for each sequela 
was applied to the respective location-specific, age-specific, 
sex-specific, and year-specific YLDs. Although the prob-
ability of two sequelae co-occurring might be dependent, 
insufficient data were available to confidently estimate all 
dependent probabilities by age and sex in the GBD study. 
Thus, all probabilities of comorbidity were modelled as 
independent.
DALYs
We estimated burden by aggregating substance-use-
disorder-specific epidemiological data and disability 
weights to calculate prevalent YLDs; multiplying 
substance-use-disorder-specific estimates of mortality by 
standard life expectancy at the age of death to calculate 
YLLs; summing YLDs and YLLs to generate substance use 
disorder-specific DALYs; and estimating YLDs, YLLs, and 
DALYs attributable to alcohol and drug use as a risk factor 
for other health outcomes (comparative risk assessment).
DALYs were derived as the sum of YLD and YLLs for 
each disorder, location, age group, sex, and year. Age-
standardised prevalence, deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs 
were estimated using the GBD world population age 
standard. Uncertainty was derived for all estimates by 
simulating 1000 draws from each estimate’s posterior 
distribution, to calculate uncertainty arising from primary 
inputs, sample sizes in the data collected, adjustments 
made to the data during modelling, and model estimation. 
For YLLs, uncertainty estimates reflected uncertainty due 
to study sample sizes, adjustments made to the all-cause 
mortality data, and model estimation.
Comparative risk assessment
GBD 2016 also quantified burden attributable to alcohol 
and drug use as risk factors for other health outcomes 
in the comparative risk assessment.26 The comparative 
risk assessment method estimated the burden from a 
risk factor attributable to an exposure compared with an 
alternative (counterfactual) exposure distribution.9 For 
drugs, the counterfactual exposure distribution was no 
use of the substance in the population; for alcohol it was 
between 0–0·8 standard daily drinks. Literature reviews 
were done to estimate relative risks (RR) for dimensions 
of substance use as a risk factor for other health 
outcomes to which alcohol and drug use was considered 
causally linked for dimensions of alcohol and drug use 
as a risk factor for other health outcomes. Disease 
burden associated with the characteristics of alcohol 
consumption patterns has been explored in detailed 
elsewhere.27 Causality was established by standard 
epidemiological criteria with an attempt to be com-
paratively similar across all risk factors included in the 
GBD comparative risk assessment. On the basis of 
exposure and relative risk (RR), population attri 
butable 
fractions (PAFs) were calculated, which denote the 
burden of disease that could have been avoided 
if individuals were not exposed to substances.28 
The substance-attributable burden was calculated by

multi 
plying the attributable fractions with the respective 
burden estimates.
The alcohol and drug use risk factor outcome 
pairings included in GBD 2016 are summarised in the 
appendix (p 32). RR estimates were used together with a 
mixed effect meta-regression with age-integration from 
DisMod ordinary differential equations to calculate PAFs. 
PAFs were multiplied by relevant cause-specific DALYs to 
calculate attributable burden. Details of the comparative 
risk assessment modelling process have been published 
in full elsewhere.26
Comparative risk assessment requires exposure and 
relative risk for pairings that have been defined as causally 
linked. Alcohol exposure was modelled as a continuous

risk factor for the dimension of level of consumption, and 
for injury and coronary heart disease outcomes, patterns 
of drinking (binge drinking) were added as an additional 
dimension. Exposure to alcohol was based on a 
triangulation of survey and sales data,29 as described 
previously.14,27,30 For opioid, amphetamine, and cocaine as 
risk factors for suicide, dependent use of these substances 
(as modelled in GBD 2016) was the defined exposure.14 For 
injecting drug use as a risk factor for HIV, we extracted 
data on the proportion of notified HIV cases by trans-
mission route from global HIV surveillance agencies.14,31 
For injecting drug use as a risk factor for hepatitis C and 
hepatitis B viruses, we used a cohort method, estimating 
the accumulated risk of individuals having incident 
hepatitis B and C due to injecting drug use. We pooled 
data on injecting drug use in DisMod-MR 2.1, did a meta-
analysis of hepatitis B and hepatitis C incidence among 
people who inject drugs, and estimated the population-
level incidence of hepatitis B and C since 1960.14,31
Estimating association between burden and SDI
The SDI is the geometric mean of total fertility rate, 
income per capita, and mean years of education among 
individuals aged 15 years and older, which was included 
as a composite measure of developmental status in GBD 
2016. The index is similar to the human development 
index. SDI scores range from 0 to 1 (0=highest fertility, 
lowest income, and lowest education; 1=highest income, 
highest education, and lowest fertility). To calculate the 
SDI, these three attributes were rescaled whereby 0 was 
the lowest value observed between 1980 and 2016, and 
1 was the highest observed value. Each GBD location 
was allocated an SDI score for each year. In this study, 
we investigate the association between SDI and DALYs 
attributable to alcohol and drug use.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or the 
writing of the report. All authors had full access to the 
data in the study and final responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results
Prevalence of substance use disorders
Globally, alcohol dependence was the most prevalent of the 
substance use disorders (table 1), with 100·4 million 
estimated cases in 2016 (age-standardised prevalence 
1320·8 cases per 100 000 people, 95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 1181·2–1468·0). The most common drug use disorders 
in 2016 were cannabis dependence (22·1 million cases; 
age-standardised prevalence 289·7 cases per 100 000 people, 
95% UI 248·9–339·1) and opioid dependence (26·8 million 
cases; age-standardised prevalence 353·0 cases per 
100 000 people, 309·9–405·9). Amphetamine and cocaine 
dependence were less common, with cocaine dependence 
the least common. Across all substance use disorders,

age-standardised prevalence was significantly higher for 
men than women, with the exception of other drug use 
disorders.
Between 1990 and 2016, the global prevalence of all 
substance use disorders increased for both men and 
women (table 1). Conversely, age-standardised prevalence 
decreased for all substance use disorders, with the 
exception of the other drug use disorders group. The 
estimated decrease in age-standardised prevalence was 
greater among women than men for all substance use 
disorders. For all ages, the increase in prevalence of 
disorders was greater among men than women, with the 
exception of other drug use disorders, whereby the 
increase in prevalence was greater for women than men 
(table 1).
Substantial regional variations were observed in the 
estimated prevalence of substance use disorders 
(table 2). Australasia was among the regions with the 
highest age-standardised prevalence across all drug 
use disorders, and age-standardised prevalence of 
amphetamine depend 
ence was highest in this region. 
High-income North America had the highest prevalence 
of cannabis, cocaine, and opioid dependence. The 
prevalence of alcohol use disorders was highest in 
Eastern Europe.
The disease burden of substance use disorders 
varied substantially by region (appendix pp 34, 35) 
and country (appendix pp 36–46), reflecting variations 
in prevalence.
Burden due to substance use as risk factors for injuries 
and diseases
Global DALYs attributable to alcohol use were highest for 
injuries (21·0 million DALYs, 95% UI 15·9–26·3), 
cardiovascular diseases (20·8 million DALYs, 14·9–27·1), 
and cancers (14·8 million DALYs, 13·5–16·1; table 3; 
appendix p 47). Drug-attributable DALYs were highest for 
drug use disorders (20·4 million DALYs, 95% UI 
16·2–24·7), cancers (1·6 million DALYs, 1·4–1·9) and 
cirrhosis (4·8 million DALYs, 4·2–5·5) driven by chronic 
hepatitis C infection due to injecting drug use, and HIV 
(3·2 million DALYs, 2·6–3·9; table 4; appendix p 49). 
There were similar patterns for deaths, YLLs, and 
YLDs (table 3, table 4). Overall, 2·8 million deaths (95% UI 
2·4–3·3) were attributed to alcohol use, and 452 000 deaths 
(420 000–487 000) were attributed to drug use.

The estimated number of deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and 
DALYs attributed to alcohol and drug use varied 
considerably between regions (table 5; appendix 
pp 50, 51). The highest alcohol-attributable burdens were 
in Eastern Europe (4730·9 age-standardised DALYs per 
100 000 people [95% UI 3591·3−6104·9]) and Southern 
sub-Saharan Africa (3178·8 age-standardised DALYs per 
100 000 people [2599·8−3759·5]). The highest drug-
attributable burdens were in Eastern Europe (1252·3 age-
standardised DALYs per 100 000 people [95% UI 
1029·6−1498·4]) and high-income North America 
(1380·3 age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 people 
[1173·9−1579·0]). In terms of absolute burden, the largest 
number of alcohol-attributable DALYs were in East Asia, 
South Asia, Eastern Europe, and Tropical Latin America, 
and the largest number of drug-attributable DALYs were 
in East Asia, high-income North America, South Asia, 
and Eastern Europe.
Globally, in 2016, 99·2 million DALYs (95% UI 
88·3–111·2) and 4·2% of all DALYs (3·7–4·6) were 
attributable to alcohol use, and 31·8 million DALYs 
(27·4–36·6) and 1·3% of all DALYs (1·2–1·5) were 
attributable to drug use (table 5). Globally, alcohol 
accounted for around three-quarters (76%) of all 
substance-use-attributable DALYs. Drugs accounted for a 
higher percentage of substance-use-attributable DALYs 
than alcohol in two regions: high-income North America 
(53% of total alcohol and drug attributable DALYs) and 
North Africa and the Middle East (69% of total alcohol 
and drug attributable DALYs).
The proportion of DALYs attributable to alcohol and 
drug use, and the contribution of each to overall DALYs, 
varied substantially, both in the absolute and relative 
data, at the regional level. Alcohol attributable burden 
was largest for Eastern Europe (12·3 million DALYs, 
95% UI 9·3–16·1; 13·8% of all DALYs, 95% UI 11·3–16·7) 
and Central Europe (3·6 million DALYs, 2·7–4·5; 9·4% of 
all DALYs, 7·0–11·8), whereas alcohol attributable burden 
was smallest for North Africa and the Middle East 
(1·3 million DALYs, 1·1–1·6; 0·8% of all DALYs, 0·7–1·0) 
and Western sub-Saharan Africa (7·1 million DALYs, 
5·9–8·3; 1·7% of all DALYs, 1·4–2·1).
The regions where drug use accounted for the highest 
proportion of DALYs were high-income North America 
(5·2 million DALYs, 95% UI 4·4–5·9; 5·1% of all DALYs, 
4·5–5·6), Eastern Europe (3·0 million DALYs, 2·5–3·6;

all 
DALYs, 
3·0–3·7), 
and 
Australasia 
(203 000 DALYs (169 000–238 000; 3·1% of all DALYs, 
2·7–3·6). Drugs accounted for the smallest percentage of 
total DALYs in several regions in sub-Saharan Africa 
(table 5).
The overall disease burden attributable to alcohol 
and 
drugs 
(age-standardised 
DALY 
rates 
per 
100 000 population) varied substantially between countries 
(figure 1, 2). The countries with the highest alcohol-
attributable age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 people 
were in Eastern Europe (Russia [4942·7 DALYs, 95% UI 
3368·7 to 6832·1], Ukraine [4487·7 DALYs, 3241·2 to 
6034·9], and Belarus [3897·1 DALYs, 2864·9 to 4981·4), 
and sub-Saharan Africa (Lesotho [9387·2 DALYs, 6374·2 
to 12 638·7], Central African Republic [7091·6 DALYs, 
3752·8 to 10 694·0], and Burundi [6396·3 DALYs, 4976·1 
to 8121·1). Countries with the highest age-standardised 
DALYs per 100 000 people attributable to drug use 
were the USA (1460·3 DALYs, 1242·1 to 1666·3), Russia 
(1380·2 DALYs, 1089·6 to 1719·1), and Mongolia 
(1057·4 DALYs, 872·5 to 1259·5).
The distribution of diseases or injuries that contributed 
to alcohol and drug-attributable burden varied by GBD 
region (figure 3). HIV accounted for a large proportion of 
disease burden attributable to drug use in African regions. 
Drug use disorders were the largest contributor to drug-
attributable burden in almost all regions, particularly 
Australasia, 
high-income 
North 
America, 
and 
North Africa and the Middle East. Alcohol burden was 
attributed to a wider variety of diseases and injuries than 
drug burden (figure 3).
Disease burden attributable to alcohol and drug use was 
strongly associated with socioeconomic development, 
and burden composition varied across SDI quintiles

(figure 4). Alcohol use disorder was a much smaller cause 
of disease burden than other consequences of alcohol 
use, and many of these were much more common in 
countries with a low SDI (figure 4A, figure 4B). 
Tuberculosis and lower respiratory infections were 
considerable causes of burden due to alcohol use in low 
SDI countries, whereas middle SDI and high-middle SDI 
countries had larger alcohol-attributable cardiovascular 
disease burden. Drug-attributable burden was higher in 
countries with higher SDI (figure 4C, figure 4D), and 
most of this burden was due to drug use disorder. 
HIV
/AIDS was a larger cause of drug-attributable burden 
in low SDI countries than high-middle SDI countries, 
whereas the consequences of chronic hepatitis C virus 
infection (ie, cirrhosis and liver cancer) were greater in 
countries with higher SDI (figure 4C, figure 4D).
Discussion
Since 1990, the number of people with alcohol and drug 
use disorders has increased substantially, driven by pop-
ulation growth and population ageing. Age-standardised 
prevalence also increased for opioid, cocaine, and 
amphetamine use disorders. The prevalence of substance 
use disorders varied markedly by substance and across 
countries, with clear differences between different 
geographic regions.
Substance use disorders were not the only conditions 
that contributed to the global burden of disease attributed 
to alcohol and drug use. A high proportion of the disease 
burden attributable to alcohol was due to increased risk 
of other health outcomes, including unintentional injuries 
and suicide, cancers, and cirrhosis, and the consequences 
of chronic hepatitis C infection (ie, cirrhosis, cancer) 
make a sub 
stantial contribution to the disease burden 
attributable to drug use.
Disease burden attributable to alcohol and drugs 
and the composition of this burden varied substan-
tially across geographical locations. Eastern Europe had 
the highest age-standardised attributable burden for 
alcohol, followed by southern sub-Saharan Africa, and 
the highest age-standardised attributable burden for 
drug use was in high-income North America. The 
association between geographical differences in attribut-
able burden and SDI varied for alcohol and drugs. 
Countries in low SDI and middle SDI quintiles had the 
highest alcohol-attributable burdens, whereas countries 
in high SDI quintiles had the highest drug-attributable 
burden.
Globally, large variation in attributable burden has been 
observed within countries with the highest SDIs.32 In 
GBD 2013, in Finland, overall age-standardised alcohol-
attributable DALYs were 1567 per 100 000 in 2013, whereas 
in Norway, with the lowest burden, corresponding 
estimates were 698 per 100 000; DALYs in Denmark were 
1530 per 100 000 and in Sweden 950 per 100 000. All 
countries had a similar attributable disease pattern and 
the majority of alcohol-attributed DALYs were due to 
YLLs, mainly from alcohol use disorder, cirrhosis, 
transport injuries, self-harm, and violence.32
The high attributable burden, even in high-income 
countries, where a substantially higher proportion of 
health budgets are spent to address these issues,

deserves attention. Multiple factors might contribute to 
this burden, including low treatment rates, delays in 
initiating treatment, and stigma associated with alcohol 
and substance use disorders.33–35 A longstanding problem 
in most countries36 is also the poor availability of highly 
effective interventions that can address HIV and 
hepatitis C virus among people who inject drugs, such 
as needle and syringe programmes, HIV and hepatitis C 
virus treatment, and opioid sub 
stitution therapy.
The emergence of alcohol-attributable burden in 
Southern sub-Saharan Africa reflects the changing 
strategies of the alcohol industry, which has started to 
target Africa and other low-income and middle-income 
countries37–39 in the past few years to avoid the stricter 
regulation of the market and public health initiatives 
in high-income countries, where consumption has 
been steadily falling. This calls for the global health 
community to respond adequately to accelerate efforts 
toward development of a framework convention 
for alcohol control,40 similar to that which has been 
implemented to counter the harmful effects for tobacco 
consumption.

Many of the causes of alcohol and drug burden can 
be prevented or treated. Taxation and regulation of 
availability and marketing can substantially reduce harms 
associated with alcohol.41 Additionally, reducing the 
alcoholic strength of beverages and minimum pricing 
show promise in reducing alcohol-attributable harm.42,43 
Transport injuries are an important consequence of 
alcohol use that can be prevented via a range of 
interventions (seat belts, helmets, and implementation 
of blood alcohol limits for drivers and roadside alcohol 
testing of drivers).
Treatment and brief interventions have been shown to 
be effective with a potential public health impact,35 but of 
all mental health disorders, alcohol use disorder has the 
lowest treatment rates globally.44 Medications for alcohol 
dependence such as naltrexone have shown efficacy, but 
uptake and adherence are very low; for example, in 
Australia, only around 0·5% of people who are alcohol-
dependent are estimated to have been prescribed 
naltrexone or acamprosate for the recommended 3 month 
duration.45 Psychosocial interventions might assist people 
with cannabis and psychostimulant use disorders.46,47 
Opioid substitution therapy reduces opioid use and 
injecting risk, improves physical and mental wellbeing, 
and reduces mortality.48–50
Opioid overdose might also be reduced by distributing 
the opioid antagonist naloxone to reverse overdoses.51 Much 
of the burden due to infectious disease among people who 
inject drugs could be averted by scaling up needle and 
syringe programmes, opioid agonist therapy, and HIV 
antiretroviral therapy.52–55 However, coverage of these 
interventions remains low.56 The development of highly 
effective hepatitis C virus treat 
ments has the capacity to 
increase rates of hepatitis C virus treatment among people 
who inject drugs,57 and might produce secondary 
prevention benefits, similar to those observed with HIV 
treatment.57 One of the biggest barriers to the scale up of 
hepatitis C virus treatment will be the high cost of these 
medications. It is also crucial to acknowledge that for 
people who inject drugs, without coverage of blood borne 
virus prevention interventions, such as needles and syringe 
programmes and opioid agonist therapy, the preventive 
effects of hepatitis C virus treatment will be limited.
The limitations of the GBD approach have been 
described previously.11–14,16 Such limitations include gaps in 
data, variable data quality, and controversies with regard 
to disability weights used to estimate non-fatal disease 
burden. Although this study modelled results where data 
were not available, the gaps in data for many countries 
result in uncertainty around the modelled estimates, 
which can only be reduced by improved epidemiological 
evidence.
Alcohol consumption consists of recorded and unre-
corded consumption data and is subject to uncertainties. 
The absence of a gold standard method in measurement 
of the prevalence of drug use poses major challenges for 
cross-national comparisons.
An important limitation of all substance use cause of 
death estimates was variation in ICD-codes used to 
classify overdoses across countries (ie, some countries 
have additional codes that permit more accurate 
attribution of cause of death to specific substances and 
others do not), which will be improved in the next GBD.
The distribution of substance use disorders across levels 
of severity was informed by analyses of data from the USA 
(NESARC) and Australia (CATS). The extent to which the 
severity distribution of substance use disorder cases is 
consistent across countries is an important question. For 
example, in countries where patterns of use or effects of 
use on functioning are more severe, a greater proportion 
of disorders might be classified as severe, and potentially 
fewer people are classified as having no disability. Thus, 
our estimates might have underestimated burden 
associated with use disorders (or indeed over 
estimated 
such burden). Studies that investigate not only the 
prevalence of substance use disorders but also levels of 
severity of those cases across countries that vary culturally, 
economically, and socially are needed to ascertain whether 
the severity distribution of substance use disorder cases 
has been incorrectly estimated, and if so, the magnitude of 
the error.
The GBD uses the ICD-10 classification system for 
injuries and diseases. The introduction of the American 
Psychiatric Association’s DSM-5 included a shift from 
DSM-IV’s abuse and dependence,4 to a category of use 
disorder (with levels of severity defined as mild, moderate, 
and severe).58 There has been some discussion regarding 
the consistency of substance use disorder definitions used 
in DSM-5 compared with other classification systems, 
with results suggesting that moderate agreement exists 
between moderate to severe DSM-5 substance use 
disorders and ICD-10 dependence,59–61 but prevalence of 
DSM-5 moderate to severe substance use disorder might 
be higher than that of DSM-IV and ICD-10 dependence,59,62 
implying that estimates of substance use disorder burden 
might have been higher if DSM-5 prevalence estimates 
were used.
Research examining the methodology used in GBD to 
generate disability weights, namely paired comparison 
responses, has revealed the method suggests that the 
approach of simultaneous estimation of cardinal severity 
values from a pooled dataset with a combination of 
responses to chronic and temporary paired comparisons is 
a reasonable methodological choice.20,21 Disability weights 
can be generated by health-care professionals, individuals 
with the disorder, or the general public. Arguments can be 
made for each of these groups; these have been discussed 
in detail previously.20,21 The disability weights used in GBD 
1996 were generated by health-care professionals on the 
basis that they would have knowledge of a diverse set of 
health states and would be able to make comparative 
judgments. Individuals in a health state have the most 
intimate knowledge of the reductions in function 
associated with that state, but they will be less able to make

comparisons with other health states. Such individuals 
might have adapted to their health loss, and therefore not 
appreciate the extent to which their functioning has been 
impaired relative to a completely healthy individual.
Our comparative risk assessment of burden attributable 
to drug use is conservative because a range of potential 
health outcomes of drug use were not included. First, 
although unintentional injuries and homicide are often 
among the most prevalent causes of death among people 
who are dependent upon opioids, cocaine, and 
amphetamines,48 they have not yet been included as 
outcomes of these forms of drug dependence. We aim to 
present evidence that will warrant their inclusion in 
future iterations of GBD. Second, the evidence for a 
causal association between drug use and a range of 
possible outcomes (such as cannabis use and intentional 
injuries) was weak. However, the inclusion of these 
outcomes might be reconsidered in future iterations of 
GBD, since a 2016 WHO monograph63 on the health 
effects of cannabis use reported increasing evidence for a 
causal link between cannabis use and road traffic 
accidents. Third, many putative consequences of drug 
use exist, for which we did not attempt to quantify the 
magnitude of possible associations because the level of 
evidence was too low.2 These consequences included a 
range of health outcomes that are increased among 
people with drug dependence, such as mental disorders, 
myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular pathology.64 
Well designed prospective studies are needed to estimate 
the risks of these con 
sequences of drug use while 
controlling for confounding factors.
Finally, in GBD, the concept of disability is intended to 
only capture the health loss of an individual. Thus, 
disability does not include social or other impacts on 
non-drug users such as the family or the social and 
economic consequences of mental and substance use 
disorders. To that extent, our estimates of disease burden 
due to alcohol and drugs are partial estimates of the 
adverse impact of substance use on society.
Alcohol and drug use cause substantial disease burden 
globally, and the composition and extent of this burden 
varies substantially between countries, and is strongly 
associated with social development. Existing inter 
ventions 
that are known to reduce the varied causes of burden exist. 
These interventions need to be scaled up, which remains a 
challenge even in high-resource settings.
