The 21-gene Recurrence Score® (RS) assay is a validated prognostic/predictive tool in ER + early-stage breast cancer. However,
clinical outcome data from prospective studies in RS ≥ 11 patients are lacking, as are relevant real-life clinical practice data. In this
retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed registry, we evaluated treatments/clinical outcomes in patients undergoing RS-
testing through Clalit Health Services. The analysis included N0 ER + HER2-negative breast cancer patients who were RS-tested from
1/2006 through 12/2010. Medical records were reviewed to verify treatments/recurrences/survival. The cohort included 1801
patients (median follow-up, 6.2 years). Median age was 60 years, 50.4% were grade 2 and 81.1% had invasive ductal carcinoma;
48.9% had RS < 18, 40.7% RS 18–30, and 10.4% RS ≥ 31, with chemotherapy use of 1.4, 23.7, and 87.2%, respectively. The 5-year
Kaplan–Meier estimates for distant recurrence were 0.8, 3.0, and 8.6%, for patients with RS < 18, RS 18–30 and RS ≥ 31, respectively;
the corresponding 5-year Kaplan–Meier estimates for breast cancer death were 0.0, 0.9, and 6.2%. Chemotherapy-untreated
patients with RS < 11 (n = 304) and 11–25 (n = 1037) (TAILORx categorization) had 5-year Kaplan–Meier estimates for distant
recurrence risk/breast cancer death of 1.0%/0.0% and 1.3%/0.4%, respectively. Our results extend those of the prospective TAILORx
trial: the 5-year Kaplan–Meier estimates for distant recurrence and breast cancer death rate for the RS < 18 patients were very low
supporting the use of endocrine therapy alone. Furthermore, in chemotherapy-untreated patients with RS 11–25 (where TAILORx
patients were randomized to chemoendocrine or endocrine therapy alone), 5-year distant recurrence rates were also very low,
suggesting that chemotherapy would not have conferred clinically meaningful benefit.

INTRODUCTION
The 21-gene Recurrence Score® (RS) assay (Oncotype DX®,
Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, CA) is used to guide
treatment decisions in estrogen receptor (ER) + early-stage breast
cancer (BC) for more than a decade. The assay was initially
validated as a prognostic/predictive tool in multiple prospectively-
designed studies using archival specimens of clinical trials with
long-term follow-up.1–6 In the first validation study,1 RS risk groups
(low, <18; intermediate, 18–30; high, ≥ 31) were defined and
validated. The assay is now included in major international
guidelines.7–10
Prospective outcome data from patients treated based on their
RS results are currently limited to findings from 2 phase 3 trials;
TAILORx and West German Study Group (WSG) PlanB. TAILORx is a
non-inferiority trial comparing endocrine treatment alone to
chemoendocrine
treatment
in
patients
with
node-negative,
hormone receptor (HR)+, human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2)−negative BC and RS 11–25. Patients with RS > 25
received chemoendocrine therapy, and patients with RS < 11
received endocrine therapy alone. Recently published TAILORx
findings reported only on the RS < 11 patients (n = 1626), and
demonstrated very low recurrence rates (rate of freedom from
distant recurrence at 5 years: 99.3%; overall survival at 5 years,
98.0%).11 Prospective outcome data have also been presented
from the WSG PlanB trial, where patients with HR + HER2-negative
disease with node-positive or high risk node-negative early BC and
RS ≤ 11 were recommended to omit adjuvant chemotherapy. The
3-year disease-free survival for the 348 RS ≤ 11 chemotherapy-
untreated patients was 98%.12

 The TAILORx data from patients with RS 11–25 randomized to
chemoendocrine or endocrine therapy alone has yet to be
presented. While awaiting these results to clarify whether
chemotherapy benefits intermediate risk patients, prospective
data on recurrence rates in patients with RS ≥ 11 treated with
endocrine therapy alone are lacking, as are data from real-life
clinical practice where treatment decisions incorporated the RS.
The RS assay became commercially available in 2004. Clalit
Health Services (CHS), the largest health maintenance organiza-
tion (HMO) in Israel, approved assay reimbursement for node-
negative ER + patients in 1/2006 and extended its policy in 1/2008
to include node-positive (up to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes
including micrometastases) patients. Since its introduction in
Israel, approximately 11,600 patients have been RS-tested includ-
ing approximately 7300 CHS members. Here, we report the first
outcome results of a real-life contemporary practice CHS registry
analysis where all patients were RS-tested > 5 years ago. The
relationship between the RS, adjuvant treatments received, and
clinical outcomes across the entire range of RS results is reported.
Notably, this analysis complements another analysis focusing on
node-positive patients who were RS-tested through CHS.13
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Patient disposition is described in Fig. 1. Between 1/2006 and 12/
2010, 2061 CHS members with N0 BC were RS-tested. Recurrence
data were not available for 198 patients (<10%) for various reasons
(patients switched to another HMO, relocated to another country,
etc). In addition, 62 patients were excluded for other reasons
(Fig. 1). The final cohort included 1801 patients. The median
follow-up was 6.2 years.
Table 1 shows patient/tumor characteristics for the cohort. The
vast majority (99%) were female. Median age was 60 (interquartile-
range: 52–67) years, 83.6% were ≥ 50 years. Approximately half
(50.4%) had grade 2 tumors, 77.5% had tumors ≤ 2 cm in size, and
81.1% had invasive ductal carcinoma.
RS distribution and patient characteristics within RS subgroups
Of the 1801 patients, 880 (48.9%) had RS < 18, 733 (40.7%) had RS
18–30, and 188 (10.4%) had RS ≥ 31. A wide RS distribution was
observed within each level of clinicopathological characteristic
including age, tumor size, and tumor grade (Supplementary
Fig. S1 a–c). Patient characteristics in RS subgroups (<11, 11-<18,
18–25, 26–30, and ≥31) seemed similar with respect to age and
tumor size (Table 1). The lower RS groups had higher proportion of
grade 1 tumors and lower proportion of grade 3 tumors compared
with the higher RS groups. Patients with very low risk by
clinicopathological characteristics (grade 1 and tumor size ≤1
cm) were observed in all RS subgroups except for the RS ≥ 31
group (Table 1).
Adjuvant chemotherapy treatment
Chemotherapy use was consistent with the RS with 1.4% (12/880),
23.7% (174/733), and 87.2% (164/188) receiving adjuvant che-
motherapy in patients with RS < 18, 18–30, and ≥31, respectively.
The overall chemotherapy rate was 19.4%. Within the RS 18–30
group, chemotherapy use increased with increasing RS results
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Chemotherapy-treated and untreated
patients were overall similar with respect to clinicopathological
characteristics (Supplementary Table S1).
Distant recurrence rates
With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 71 distant recurrences were
documented; 18/880, 32/733, and 21/188 in patients with RS
results <18, 18–30, and ≥31, respectively. Kaplan–Meier (KM)
estimates for distant recurrence within 5 years differed signifi-
cantly (P < 0.001) between the RS groups with rates of 0.8% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.4–1.7%) in the RS < 18, 3.0% (95% CI,
2.0–4.5%) in the RS 18–30, and 8.6% (95% CI, 5.4–13.7%) in the
RS ≥ 31 group (Fig. 2a). Subgroup analyses by age, tumor size, and
tumor grade showed that the difference in distant recurrence risk
between the RS groups was statistically significant in all evaluated
clinicopathological subgroups, and that RS < 18 patients had low
distant recurrence risk regardless of age, tumor size and tumor
grade (Fig. 2b–d). Within the RS ≥ 18 group (where the recurrence
risk was higher across clinicopathological levels), larger tumor size
(>3 cm) seemed to be associated with higher distant recurrence
risk (Fig. 2d).
We divided the RS 18–30 group into two subgroups (using the
TAILORx RS cutoff value of 25): 18–25 and 26–30. KM estimates for
distant recurrence risk by chemotherapy use for each subgroup
are presented in Fig. 3. It should be emphasized that results are to
be interpreted cautiously, as patients were not randomized to
treatment (of the RS 18–30 patients, 174 were chemotherapy-
treated and 559 were untreated) and there is likely a selection bias
for choice of therapy. Within each of these subgroups, the KM
curves were similar and there was no statistically significant
difference in 5-year distant recurrence risk between treated and
untreated patients (P ≥ 0.4). As sensitivity analysis, propensity
score (PS) adjustment was utilized within three subgroups: N0
patients with RS 18–25, N0 patients with RS 26–30, and all patients
with RS 18–30. Age, tumor size, and grade were used for
calculating PS. The PS-adjusted models produced similar results
to the unadjusted models. In all cases, there were no significant
differences in time to distant recurrence between chemotherapy-
treated and untreated patients.
Additionally, the TAILORx categorization (<11, 11–25)11 was
used for distant recurrence risk analysis in N0 chemotherapy-
untreated patients (93% of patients with RS ≤ 25) (Fig. 4). The KM
estimate for distant recurrence risk at 5 years was very low in both
the RS < 11 and 11–25 categories (1.0% [95% CI, 0.3–3.1%] and
1.3% [95% CI, 0.8–2.2%], respectively) and consistent with the
TAILORx results for RS < 11.11
Breast cancer death rates
Twenty-nine BC deaths were documented (1/880, 11/733, and 17/
188 in the RS < 18, RS 18–30, and RS ≥ 31 groups, respectively). KM
estimates for the risk of BC death within 5 years differed
significantly (P < 0.001) between the RS groups (Fig. 5a); this risk
was 0.0% (no deaths reported in the first 5 years) in RS < 18, 0.9%
(95% CI, 0.4–1.9%) in RS 18–30, and 6.2% (95% CI, 3.5–10.9%) in
the RS ≥ 31 group. In an analysis using TAILORx categorization in

 for 5-year BC death risk was very low in both the RS < 11 and RS
11–25 TAILORx categories (0.0% [95% CI, 0.0–0.0%] and 0.4% [95%
CI, 0.2–1.1%], respectively).
Multivariable analysis
A multivariable regression analysis was performed on the entire
cohort and included the RS group (18–30 vs. <18, ≥31 vs. <18),
age (per year), size (≤2 vs. >2 cm), and histologic grade (2 vs. 3, 1
vs. 3). It showed that both the RS group and tumor size had a
significant association with distant recurrence risk. The hazard
ratio [HR] for RS 18–30 vs. RS < 18 was 2.0 (95% CI, 0.97–4.3), and
for RS ≥ 31 vs. RS < 18, 5.8 (95% CI, 2.6–12.9); P < 0.0001. For tumor
grade 1 vs. 3, it was 0.2 (95% CI, 0.02–1.5), and for grade 2 vs. 3, 1.3
(95% CI, 0.7–2.6); P = 0.118; for size, the HR was 2.3 (95% CI,
1.3–4.0), P = 0.006 for >2 vs. ≤2 cm (Supplementary Table S2).
DISCUSSION
These are the first clinical outcome data from an analysis of a large
prospectively designed registry investigating patients across the
full RS range, where the assay has been incorporated into real-life
clinical practice. We found that chemotherapy use was consistent
with the RS, and that clinical outcomes were very good overall and
excellent in chemotherapy-untreated patients with RS ≤ 25.
Our results are consistent with the original validation studies,2, 14
and complement recent findings from TAILORx, the SEER registry
analysis, and WSG PlanB.11, 12, 15 The 5-year KM recurrence rate in
patients with RS < 11 treated with endocrine alone was very
similar in our analysis and TAILORx (1.0 and 0.7%, respectively)
allowing us to assume that our population is similar to that in
TAILORx. Furthermore, the 5-year KM recurrence rate for the entire
RS < 18 group (which in our cohort included 1.4% chemotherapy-

 treated patients) was 0.8%, which is comparable to that reported
in TAILORx for RS < 11 (where all patients were chemotherapy-
untreated).11 Notably, our analysis included all N0 RS-tested
patients
regardless
of
tumor
size/grade,
whereas
TAILORx
included node-negative patients with a primary tumor size of
1.1–5.0 cm in the longest dimension (any grade) or those with
tumors 0.6–1.0 cm in the longest dimensions and grade 2 or 3.11
Despite the differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patho-
logical characteristics of the patients in our analysis and in
TAILORx are similar with respect to median tumor size and age.
Our cohort seems to have lower proportion of grade 1 tumors
compared
with
TAILORx.
Approximately
12%
of
our
chemotherapy-untreated patients would not have been eligible
for TAILORx. Our findings also complement the SEER analysis,
which was limited to survival data, and demonstrated excellent
(99.6%) 5-year BC-specific survival in >21,000 N0 HR + HER2-
negative BC patients with RS < 18.15 Our results are also consistent
with those reported for the WSG PlanB analysis where the patient
population had overall higher risk of recurrence based on
clinicopathological characteristics than in our patient popula-
tion.12 The PlanB analysis included HR + HER2-negative node-
positive or high-risk (T2, grade 2 or 3, high uPA/PAI-1, or <35 years
of age) node-negative patients. PlanB patients with RS ≤ 11 who
did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 348) had 3-year
disease-free survival of 98%, whereas those with RS 12–25 and
those with RS > 25 (all of whom received chemotherapy) had 3-
year disease-free survival of 98 and 92%, respectively.12
Prospective–retrospective
validation
studies
showed
that
RS < 18 patients gain minimal, if any, benefit from chemotherapy,
whereas for those with RS 18–30, some chemotherapy benefit
cannot be ruled out.3,
4 Our registry analysis supports using
endocrine therapy alone in RS < 18 patients. It is also consistent
with the decision by many physicians to spare chemotherapy in
certain patients with RS ≤ 25, as patients selected for endocrine
therapy alone in our cohort had excellent clinical outcomes
without adjuvant chemotherapy: 5-year KM-estimate for distant
recurrence rate of 1.0% for patients with RS < 11 and 1.3% for
patients with RS 11–25. Since the distant recurrence rate without
adjuvant chemotherapy is so low in this population, the absolute
benefit of chemotherapy is expected to be very small, and to be
outweighed
by
treatment-related
toxicity
and
mortality.
In
addition, our analysis of chemotherapy-treated vs. untreated
patients showing no significant difference in recurrence risk
between these groups supports treating these patients with
endocrine therapy alone. In the group of patients with RS 26–30,
no evidence of chemotherapy benefit was observed although the
number of patients and events in this group was small; in a post
hoc analysis of statistical power for detecting a difference in
outcome by treatment, we calculated less than 30% power in both
the RS 18–25 and RS 26–30 cohorts. Notably, our registry analysis
is impacted by selection bias as patients were not randomized to
chemoendocrine vs. endocrine therapy alone. For patients with RS
18–30, measured/unmeasured prognostic parameters associated
with higher risk maybe more common in those who were
recommended chemotherapy. The results from the randomized
arms in TAILORx will provide final evidence on whether endocrine
therapy alone is non-inferior to chemoendocrine therapy in this
patient population.
Although some subgroups are relatively small, our findings
suggest that RS ≥ 18, patients with larger tumors have worse
outcomes; however, we cannot predict whether these patients will
benefit
from
adjuvant
treatment
with
the
currently
used
chemotherapeutic agents.
Our data, showing that oncologists in Israel treat BC based on the
RS results, are consistent with decision impact studies conducted
worldwide (including in Israel).16–23 Within the RS 18–30 group, we
found
increased
chemotherapy
use
with
higher
RS
results,
suggesting that clinicians do not view this group as a uniform entity.
Notably, other genomic assays are also commercially available
and serve as prognostic tools in early BC. These include
MammaPrint® (Agendia BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Pro-
signa® (PAM50; NanoString Technologies Inc, Seattle WA), and

 EndoPredict® (Myriad Genetics Inc, Salt Lake City, UT). These assays
differ from each other and from the RS assay in the technological
platforms used, the specific genes included in the assay, and the
patient populations used for their development/validation.24–28
There are health economic (HE) implications associated with the
cost of the tests, from sparing chemotherapy among patients who
would not benefit from it, thereby decreasing acute/chronic
treatment-related morbidity, as well as from using chemotherapy
in patients who would benefit from it (i.e., preventing recur-
rences). The first 313 RS assays reimbursed by CHS were included
in HE analysis, which reported cost effectiveness.29 A formal cost-
effectiveness evaluation of using the RS assay in Israel is warranted
and planned. Notably, our distribution analyses demonstrated that
overall, estimating the RS from clinicopathological characteristics
is not feasible as the RS distribution was wide in all evaluated
subgroups, except for patients with grade 1 disease and tumors
≤1 cm where the proportion of patients with RS > 25 was low and
the baseline risk to which the RS adds prognostic information is
also low.
This is the first real-life large registry analysis that represents
clinical practice on a national level; no exclusion criteria with
respect to gender, age, location, socioeconomic status, or
comorbidities were applied and patients were treated in CHS-
affiliated centers and government hospitals throughout Israel.
Nonetheless, the analysis does have some limitations. It was not
randomized and patients were not treated uniformly (with respect
to chemotherapy/endocrine therapy regimens), and there may
have been selection bias in who was tested and in those not
receiving chemotherapy. We believe that the former was minimal
as >80% of eligible CHS patients are tested. Also, although the
sample size was approximately 1800 patients, the event rate was
very low, and therefore drawing more definitive conclusions for
smaller subgroups is not possible. The SEER analysis may provide
robust data in subgroups with less common clinicopathological
characteristics. Also, median follow-up of 6 years is relatively short
for N0 ER + patients; thus, our findings are limited to ‘early’ distant
recurrences, but this is also the timeframe when chemotherapy
benefit would be expected. Longer-term analysis (median of 10
years) is warranted and planned. The TAILORx randomized arms
are yet to be reported as the number of events has been low
(consistent with our findings).
In conclusion, this is the first analysis of a prospectively
designed registry evaluating clinical outcomes in N0 ER + HER2-
negative early BC patients for whom the RS was used in real-life
clinical practice. It extends the remarkable results from the
TAILORx-defined cohort (RS < 11) to include patients with RS < 18,
as in both studies, the 5-year risk of distant recurrence was very
low (≤1%). For selected patients with RS ≤ 25, the data suggest
that endocrine therapy alone may suffice.
METHODS
Patient population
Collecting clinical outcome data from all CHS RS-tested patients was
planned by CHS, in concert with assay reimbursement approval. This
retrospective analysis of the prospectively designed CHS registry investi-
gated the relationship between the RS, adjuvant treatments received, and
distant recurrence/survival in patients with ER + HER2-negative N0 BC in
real-life clinical practice. The analysis included all N0 CHS members who
were RS-tested between 1/2006 through 12/2010 to allow for ≥5 years of
follow-up. Patients who were ER-negative by immunohistochemistry (IHC;
cutoff: 0.5) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
which was performed as part of the 21-gene assay (cutoff: 6.5 units) were
excluded. Also, those who were HER2 + by IHC (cutoff: 3), fluorescence
in situ hybridization (ratio cutoff: 2.2), or RT-PCR performed as part of the
21-gene assay (cutoff: 10.7 units), and patients who received trastuzumab
adjuvantly were also excluded. Patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment,
those with metastatic disease at the time of testing, and patients recurring
within 6 months of testing (as it was assumed that they were metastatic at
diagnosis), as well as those with another malignancy for which they were
treated within 6 months of testing were also excluded.
This analysis was approved by the institutional review boards of the CHS
Community Division and participating medical centers and was granted a
waiver for obtaining patient consent.
Data source
RS results and patient/tumor characteristics were extracted from the Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Oncotest database. Clinical information (treat-
ments, death status) was extracted from CHS claims arm. Medical records
were used to verify treatments received and recurrence status (reviewers
were unaware of the RS results).
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis plan was pre-specified. Descriptive statistics were
used to summarize clinicopathological characteristics. The primary end-
point was 5-year KM distant recurrence estimates and 95% CI by RS risk
categories1 (<18, 18–30, ≥31). Patients without recurrence were censored
at the time of last follow-up (later of last follow-up or date that medical
records were reviewed) or at time of death (due to any cause). A secondary
endpoint was 5-year KM BC death estimates and 95% CI. Patients with
metastatic disease at the time of death were considered events; patients
were censored at the time of last follow-up or death from other causes,
and recurrences were ignored for purposes of this endpoint. Analysis was
also performed on intermediate risk1 subgroups (18–25, 25–30) and using
TAILORx11 RS categorization (<11 and 11–25). The log-rank test was used
to compare distant recurrence rates across RS groups. Cox proportional
hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association of RS

 group, age, size, and grade with distant recurrence. Univariate analysis
identified a set of prognostic baseline factors, and a full multivariable
model was fit. Non-significant covariates were removed from the final
model. For sensitivity analysis, two sets of prognostic models were fit: one
assessing fit with the three-category RS group, the other with continuous
RS result. Proportional hazards assumptions were assessed and met in the
final model. As sensitivity analysis, PS adjustments were performed to
account for lack of randomization. SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was
used for the analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
