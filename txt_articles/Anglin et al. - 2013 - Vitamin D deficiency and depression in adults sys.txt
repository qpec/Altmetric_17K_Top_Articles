 Depression is associated with significant disability, mortality and
healthcare costs. It is the third leading cause of disability in
high-income countries,1 and affects approximately 840 million
people
worldwide.2
Although
biological,
psychological
and
environmental theories have been advanced,3 the underlying
pathophysiology of depression remains unknown and it is
probable that several different mechanisms are involved. Vitamin
D is a unique neurosteroid hormone that may have an important
role in the development of depression. Receptors for vitamin D
are present on neurons and glia in many areas of the brain
including the cingulate cortex and hippocampus, which have been
implicated in the pathophysiology of depression.4 Vitamin D is
involved in numerous brain processes including neuroimmuno-
modulation, regulation of neurotrophic factors, neuroprotection,
neuroplasticity and brain development,5 making it biologically
plausible that this vitamin might be associated with depression
and that its supplementation might play an important part in
the treatment of depression. Over two-thirds of the populations
of the USA and Canada have suboptimal levels of vitamin D.6,7
Some studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between
vitamin D and depression,8,9 whereas others have shown no
relationship.10,11 To date there have been eight narrative reviews
on this topic,12–19 with the majority of reviews reporting that there
is insufficient evidence for an association between vitamin D and
depression. None of these reviews used a comprehensive search
strategy, provided inclusion or exclusion criteria, assessed risk of
bias or combined study findings. In addition, several recent
studies were not included in these reviews.9,10,20,21 Therefore, we
undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate
whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with depression in
adults in case–control and cross-sectional studies; whether
vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing depression in
cohort studies in adults; and whether vitamin D supplementation
improves depressive symptoms in adults with depression compared
with placebo, or prevents depression compared with placebo, in
healthy adults in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
Method
Search strategy
We searched the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO,
CINAHL, AMED and Cochrane CENTRAL (up to 2 February
2011) using separate comprehensive strategies developed in
consultation with an experienced research librarian (see online
supplement DS1). A separate search of PubMed identified articles
published electronically prior to print publication within 6
months of our search and therefore not available through
MEDLINE. The clinical trials registries clinicaltrials.gov and
Current Controlled Trials (controlled-trials.com) were searched
for unpublished data. The reference lists of identified articles were
reviewed for additional studies.
Eligibility criteria
The following study designs were included: RCTs, case–control
studies, cross-sectional studies and cohort studies. All studies
enrolled adults (age 18 years) and reported depression as the
outcome of interest and vitamin D measurements as a risk factor
or intervention. Cross-sectional and cohort studies were required
to report depression outcomes for participants with vitamin D
deficiency (as defined by each study, see Tables 1 and 2) compared
with those with normal vitamin D levels. There was no language
restriction. Eligibility criteria are detailed in online supplement
DS2.
Outcome
Our primary outcome for all studies was depression diagnosed
using one of the following:
(a) a standardised psychiatric interview for the DSM diagnoses of
depressive disorders (e.g. the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM Disorders) or ICD diagnoses of a depressive episode or

systematic review and meta-analysis
Rebecca E. S. Anglin, Zainab Samaan, Stephen D. Walter and Sarah D. McDonald
Background
There is conflicting evidence about the relationship between
vitamin D deficiency and depression, and a systematic
assessment of the literature has not been available.
Aims
To determine the relationship, if any, between vitamin D
deficiency and depression.
Method
A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational
studies and randomised controlled trials was conducted.
Results
One case–control study, ten cross-sectional studies and
three cohort studies with a total of 31 424 participants
were analysed. Lower vitamin D levels were found in
people with depression compared with controls (SMD = 0.60,
95% CI 0.23–0.97) and there was an increased odds ratio of
depression for the lowest v. highest vitamin D categories in
the cross-sectional studies (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.0–1.71). The
cohort studies showed a significantly increased hazard ratio
of depression for the lowest v. highest vitamin D categories
(HR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.40–3.49).
Conclusions
Our analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that low
vitamin D concentration is associated with depression, and
highlight the need for randomised controlled trials of vitamin
D for the prevention and treatment of depression to
determine whether this association is causal.

 depression (e.g. the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview);22,23
(b) a clinical diagnosis of a depressive disorder, depressive episode
or depression not otherwise specified;
(c) a diagnosis of depression using an established cut-off point on
a validated rating scale, such as a score of 516 on the Center
for Epidemiological Studies – Depression scale or 58 on the
Geriatric Depression Scale.24,25
For RCTs that enrolled patients with depression our secondary
outcome was change in depressive symptoms using a validated
rating scale. This secondary outcome was not used for RCTs
that enrolled non-depressed participants or other study designs
because it was not meaningful in those contexts.
Study selection and data abstraction
Two authors (R.A. and Z.S.) independently reviewed all titles
and abstracts identified by the search. Articles were selected for
full-text review if inclusion criteria were met or if either reviewer
considered them potentially relevant. Disagreements were resolved
by discussion between the two reviewers, and a third author
(S.M.) was available to determine eligibility if consensus could
not
be
reached.
Initial
agreement
was
assessed
using
an
unweighted k value. Data were extracted by two authors (R.A.
and Z.S.) independently using a form developed for this review,
with disagreements resolved as above. We attempted to contact
study authors for additional or missing information when needed.
Assessment of risk of bias
Two reviewers (R.A. and Z.S.) independently assessed the risk
of bias using a modified Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (see online
supplement DS3).26 In observational studies one of the main
sources of bias is confounding. Known confounders can be
statistically adjusted, but unknown confounders may still result
in bias. It was decided a priori that studies that adjusted for factors
shown elsewhere to affect vitamin D levels (chronic disease, body
mass
index,
geographical
location,
season
and
physical
activity)27,28 would be considered to have a low risk of bias,
studies that adjusted only for other potential confounders would
have an unclear risk of bias, and any studies that did not adjust
for any confounders would have a high risk of bias. Publication
bias was assessed using funnel plots.
Statistical analysis
Search results were compiled using citation management software
(RefWorks version 2.0; ProQuest, http://www.refworks.com).
Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager software
(Revman version 5.1; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK),
Epi Info version 6.0 (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, USA) and PASW
Statistics version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) for Mac.
Case–control studies
The standardised mean difference (SMD) of vitamin D levels
between the participants with depression and the healthy controls
was calculated. An SMD below 0.4 was considered small, 0.4–0.7
moderate and over 0.7 large.29 Our protocol proposed pooling
SMDs for meta-analysis using a random effects model.
Cross-sectional studies
Our protocol proposed examining adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of
depression for those with or without vitamin D deficiency (as
defined in each study) and the associated 95% confidence
intervals. We planned to pool the adjusted ORs for meta-analysis.
Unfortunately the cross-sectional studies used different reference
categories of vitamin D concentration (either 550 nmol/l or the
lowest and highest category) and presented data using different
quartiles, tertiles or categories. After protocol development, but
prior to analysing the data, we decided to use the adjusted OR
of depression for the lowest v. highest vitamin D categories
reported. The inverse variance method and random effects model
were used for all meta-analyses. A random effects model was
chosen because we anticipated heterogeneity among studies.
Where ORs were reported for subgroups of patients within a
single study, they were combined into a single OR for our
analysis.30
Cohort studies
As with the analysis of cross-sectional studies, the variability in
presentation of results of the cohort studies precluded the
calculation of a pooled adjusted OR. We therefore contacted the
authors of all three cohort studies to obtain the number of
depressed participants and the person-years of follow-up in each
category of vitamin D, and requested data using the cut-off point
of 50 nmol/l. This allowed us to calculate hazard rates for each
category, so that we could then account for losses to follow-up
and variable follow-up periods; also, by assuming a constant
hazard rate over time, we could pool hazard ratios using a cut-
off point of 50 nmol/l. All authors provided some data, but one
provided only data using the cut-off points of 37.5 nmol/l and
75 nmol/l.9 We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis using
these two cut-off points in a meta-analysis.
Additionally, we decided to analyse the cohort data using the
highest v. lowest vitamin D categories in order to use the adjusted
results and take confounding into account. For this analysis the
adjusted hazard ratios were used; the adjusted OR from one study
was converted first to a relative risk and then to a hazard ratio
(HR).10 Finally, we performed a third analysis in which we
calculated the increase in the natural logarithm of the hazard rate
(ln(HR)) of depression per 20 nmol/l decrease in vitamin D for
each study.31 The mid-point of each category of vitamin D was
calculated and half the width of the adjacent category was used
to define the corresponding point for open-ended categories.
The ln(HR) for each category was then regressed on the vitamin
D mid-points (divided by 20) using a linear model, with the data
weighted by the inverse variance of the ln(HR), to generate a
coefficient that represented the change in ln(HR) per 20 nmol/l
decrease in vitamin D and its associated standard error. The
coefficients for each study were then pooled for meta-analysis.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Heterogeneity between the studies was measured using Cochran’s
Q statistic, with a probability value of P50.05 (two-tailed)
considered statistically significant. The I 2 statistic was used to
quantify the degree of heterogeneity and we considered values
below 25% to be low, 25–50% moderate and over 50% high.32
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
We planned the following subgroup analyses a priori: gender, age
565 years, prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, proportion of
participants with a disease known to affect vitamin D, and
adjustment for different confounders. We planned a priori to
perform a sensitivity analysis excluding studies with a high risk
of bias. For the cohort studies we performed a sensitivity analysis
using the cut-off point of 37.5 nmol/l compared with 75 nmol/l for
the one study that did not provide data using our standard cut-off
101

point of 50 nmol/l. We also performed a sensitivity analysis for the
cross-sectional studies excluding one study that had recruited
participants aged 15–39 years33 (our inclusion criteria specified
adults aged 18 years).
Results
Our primary search identified 6675 citations (Fig. 1). No
additional article or abstract was selected from other sources. After
duplicates were removed 5484 citations remained for title and
abstract screening. Of these, 35 were identified and retrieved for
full-text screening; all were in English. After full text review, one
case–control study,34 three cohort studies,9,10,35 and ten cross-
sectional studies,8,11,20,21,30,33,36–39 met eligibility criteria and were
included (unweighted k = 0.75). Figure 1 lists the reasons for
excluding the other studies.19,40–58
Study characteristics
Baseline information on the case–control, cross-sectional and
cohort studies is presented in Tables 1 and 2. There were 31 424
participants in total. All studies were published between 2006
and 2011; study locations included the USA, Europe and East
Asia. Seven of the ten cross-sectional studies included older adults.
Risk of bias in included studies
Case–control study
The agreement between the reviewers in assessing the risk of
bias for the case–control study across the nine points of the
Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was 100%, with both reviewers assigning
the same four points. There was potential for selection bias as
participants were recruited through advertisements and were all
premenopausal women; also, the study did not control for known
confounders.
Cross-sectional studies
Agreement between the reviewers in assessing the risk of bias in
cross-sectional studies was 95%, unweighted k = 0.84. Four studies
were thought to be unrepresentative of the general population:
Johnson et al included only low-income older adults;20 Lee et al
included only elderly men;37 and the two studies by Wilkins et
al included only elderly participants, half of whom in the 2006
study were purposely selected to have Alzheimer’s disease, and
in the 2009 study were purposely selected to include African
Americans and European Americans in equal numbers.8,39 Seven
studies received a high risk of bias assignment for assessment of
outcome because they used cut-off points on self-reported
psychiatric rating scales. Two studies received an unclear risk of
bias assignment for using administered surveys, which were felt
to have an intermediate risk of bias between a self-report scale
and clinician-administered standardised psychiatric interview.
All studies adjusted for multiple confounders (online supplement
DS4). The funnel plot (online supplement DS5) did not suggest
significant publication bias.
Cohort studies
Agreement between the reviewers in assessing the risk of bias
across cohort studies was 88%, unweighted k= 0.61. Two studies9,10
were considered unrepresentative of the general population, and
the study by May et al was thought to be at high risk of bias for
selection of the non-exposed cohort because vitamin D levels were
obtained at the discretion of treating physicians,9 which may have
biased whose vitamin D levels were observed. All studies included
in this review adjusted for multiple confounders, but May et al did
not measure or adjust for physical activity, body mass index or the
presence of chronic diseases and therefore received an unclear risk
of bias rating. Chan et al and Milaneschi et al used cut-off points
on self-report scales to diagnose depression,10,35 which is less
reliable than a clinical diagnosis, and therefore these studies were
rated at high risk of bias. Although May et al used a clinical
diagnosis of depression using ICD-9 codes, it was not clear
whether all participants underwent a clinical assessment or
whether record linkage was used; an unclear risk of bias was
therefore assigned. May et al presented the average duration of
follow-up period but did not otherwise describe loss to follow-up,
and therefore this received an unclear rating. Because there were
only three cohort studies the funnel plot was uninformative.59
Further information on the risk of bias assessments is included
in online supplement DS5.
Outcome evaluation and meta-analysis

version 6.0,39 but the third study could not be included.20
Case–control study
One study compared vitamin D levels in women with depression
and healthy controls.34 The mean difference between the groups
was 17.5 nmol/l (P = 0.002), with an SMD of 0.60 (95% CI
0.23–0.97). This represented a moderate difference,29 which was
also clinically significant. Meta-analysis could not be performed
as only one study met our inclusion criteria.
Cross-sectional studies
The cross-sectional studies measured rates of depression and
vitamin D in a population at a single point in time to determine
whether there was an association between depression and vitamin
D levels. Nine studies reported on depression for the lowest v. the
highest vitamin D categories, with a pooled OR of 1.31, 95% CI
1.00–1.71 (Fig. 2). There was substantial heterogeneity between
studies (I 2 = 54%, w2 = 17.24, P= 0.03). The only subgroup
analysis that could be performed was of studies that had an
average sample age of 65 years (online supplement DS5). When
these studies were combined there was an increased – although
non-significant – odds of depression with low vitamin D
(OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.00–2.40). A sensitivity analysis excluding
the study by Ganji et al (online supplement DS6) had a minimal
effect on our summary estimate (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.99–1.83,
I 2 = 59%, w2 = 17.16, P= 0.02).33
Cohort studies
Three studies measured vitamin D levels at baseline in non-
depressed individuals and followed them over time to determine
whether vitamin D levels were associated with a risk of developing

 Vitamin D and depression
Milaneschi et al were pooled with the HR of depression for vitamin
D below v. above 37.5 nmol/l from the study by May et al (Fig. 5).
The overall HR in this analysis was not significant (HR= 1.04, 95%
CI 0.59–1.86). In the second analysis using cut-off points, the HR of
depression for vitamin D below v. above 75nmol/l from the May et
al study was pooled with the other results (Fig. 6). This also gave a
non-significant HR of 1.31 (95% CI 0.97–1.77). Interestingly, using
the cut-off point of 75nmol/l compared with 37.5 nmol/l changed
the direction of the effect in this study. This appears to result from
the highest hazard rate, and largest number of participants, being
in the 37.5–75 nmol/l category. Therefore, if this group is included
in the vitamin D deficient group (cut-off point 75 nmol/l), the HR
suggests an increased risk of depression with vitamin D deficiency.
However, if this group is included in the normal vitamin D group
(cut-off point 37.5 nmol/l), the HR suggests a decreased risk of
depression with vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, the effect of
vitamin D deficiency at levels below 50 nmol/l cannot be reliably
determined from this study.

Discussion
Our systematic review identified one case–control study, ten cross-
sectional studies and three cohort studies investigating the
association between depression and vitamin D deficiency, but
no randomised controlled trial. The single case–control study
showed a moderate difference in vitamin D levels between women
with depression and healthy controls. Meta-analysis of the cross-
sectional studies demonstrated an increased but non-significant
odds of depression for the lowest compared with the highest
vitamin D categories (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.00–1.71, P= 0.05).
Limiting the analysis to studies with an average participant age

There

considerable

and therefore three different meta-analyses were performed. Our

depression
with

D
levels
(HR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.40–3.49, P50.001). The pooled change in
ln(HR) of depression per 20 nmol/l change in vitamin D level
across the three cohort studies also showed an increased hazard
of depression with decreasing vitamin D concentration, although
this was not significant (b70.19, 95% CI 70.41 to 0.04, P= 0.1).
Finally, we analysed the data using different cut-off points as
provided in the studies, which yielded different but non-significant
pooled HR: 1.04 (95% CI 0.59–1.86) v. 1.31 (95% CI 0.97–1.77).
Overall, the summary estimates of all analyses suggest a relationship
between vitamin D and depression, and all but one were close to
being statistically significant.
Strengths and limitations
To the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review or
meta-analysis that has analysed the relationship between vitamin
D deficiency and depression. We performed a transparent and
methodologically rigorous systematic review of the literature.
We developed a comprehensive search to identify articles and
assessed their eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias
in each study in duplicate with a good level of agreement. Our
protocol was developed a priori and any post hoc analyses were
clearly identified. A particular strength was the method used
and extensive analyses performed in an attempt to present the data
in a uniform and consistent manner to allow for comparison and
combination. We were also successful in obtaining supplemental
information from several authors, which allowed us to include
the majority of studies.
There are several limitations to our systematic review. As, at
the time of our review, there was no RCT of vitamin D for
depression our review was restricted to observational studies,
which usually yield lower-quality evidence than RCTs. Reverse
causality, in which patients with depression have less exposure
to the sun and therefore lower vitamin D levels, cannot be ruled
out in the cross-sectional studies. In addition there were potential
biases across all study designs. Several cross-sectional studies had
unrepresentative samples, used self-reports of depression and had
small sample sizes. The study results were generally consistent,
with the exception of those from Pan et al who reported a
decreased odds of depression with low vitamin D.11 This was the
only cross-sectional study conducted in China, and geographical
differences in the nature and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
and depression might explain their discrepant findings. One small
study could not be included in the quantitative analysis as
insufficient information was available; it found an increased
prevalence of depression with vitamin D deficiency20 and therefore
it is unlikely that it would have significantly affected our findings.
Most
studies
adjusted
for
multiple
confounders;
however,
unadjusted data were used to generate an odds ratio for one study
where an adjusted OR was not provided.39 All the cohort studies
had problems with bias and the largest one had a high risk of bias.
Publication bias could not be ruled out, and it is possible that
additional
cohort
studies
have
measured
vitamin
D
and
depression but not reported negative results. The majority of the
meta-analyses of the cross-sectional studies and cohort studies
had significant heterogeneity and lacked precision. Studies used
variable definitions of vitamin D deficiency, and therefore we
performed analyses using the lowest v. highest vitamin D
categories and different cut-off points rather than adhering to a
strict definition of deficiency. As a result of these limitations the
overall quality of the evidence from each study is low and
therefore some uncertainty remains about the true association
between vitamin D deficiency and depression.
Implications of the study
The importance of vitamin D to many brain processes including
neuroimmunomodulation and neuroplasticity suggests that it
might have a role in psychiatric illness such as depression. The
biological plausibility of the association between vitamin D and
depressive illness has been strengthened by the identification of
vitamin D receptors in areas of the brain implicated in
depression,4 the detection of vitamin D response elements in the
promoter regions of serotonin genes,60 and demonstration of
interactions between vitamin D receptors and glucocorticoid
receptors in the hippocampus.61 Given the high prevalence of both
vitamin D deficiency and depression, an association between these
two conditions would have significant public health implications,
particularly as supplementation with vitamin D is cost-effective
and without significant adverse effects. The observational studies
to date provide some evidence for a relationship between vitamin
D deficiency and depression, but RCTs are urgently needed to
determine whether vitamin D can prevent and treat depression.
