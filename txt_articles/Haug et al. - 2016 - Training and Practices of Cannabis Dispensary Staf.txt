Abstract
Introduction: The proliferation of cannabis dispensaries within the United States has emerged from patient de-
mand for the legalization of cannabis as an alternative treatment for a number of conditions and symptoms.
Unfortunately, nothing is known about the practices of dispensary staff with respect to recommendation of can-
nabis strains/concentrations for specific patient ailments. To address this limitation, the present study assessed
the training and practices of cannabis dispensary staff.
Materials and Methods: Medical and nonmedical dispensary staff (n = 55) were recruited via e-mail and social
media to complete an online survey assessing their demographic characteristics, dispensary features, patient
characteristics, formal training, and cannabis recommendation practices.
Results: Fifty-five percent of dispensary staff reported some formal training for their position, with 20% reporting
medical/scientific training. A majority (94%) indicated that they provide specific cannabis advice to patients. In
terms of strains, dispensary staff trended toward recommendations of Indica for anxiety, chronic pain, insomnia,
nightmares, and Tourette’s syndrome. They were more likely to recommend Indica and hybrid plants for post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)/trauma and muscle spasms. In contrast, staff were less likely to recommend Indica
for depression; hybrid strains were most often recommended for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In terms of can-
nabinoid concentrations, dispensary staff were most likely to recommend a 1:1 ratio of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC):cannabidiol (CBD) for patients suffering from anxiety, Crohn’s disease, hepatitis C, and PTSD/trauma, while pa-
tients seeking appetite stimulation were most likely to be recommended THC. Staff recommended high CBD for
arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease and a high CBD or 1:1 ratio for ALS, epilepsy, and muscle spasms.
Conclusions: Although many dispensary staff are making recommendations consistent with current evidence,
some are recommending cannabis that has either not been shown effective for, or could exacerbate, a patient’s
condition. Findings underscore the importance of consistent, evidence-based, training of dispensary staff who
provide specific recommendations for patient medical conditions.

Introduction
Approximately half of the United States has legalized
cannabis for medicinal purposes, with four states hav-
ing also legalized cannabis for nonmedical use. Epide-
miological research suggests that despite its association
with negative short- and long-term effects such as ad-
diction, deficits in cognitive performance and motor
coordination, and psychosis,1 a number of particularly
vulnerable groups of individuals are using cannabis to
alleviate their medical conditions (e.g., anxiety, chronic

 pain, epilepsy, cancer, HIV/AIDS, post-traumatic stress
disorder [PTSD]).2,3 Indeed, more than 1,000 medical
cannabis dispensaries, cooperatives, and delivery ser-
vices are operating in California,4 and *500 exist in
Colorado, to meet patient demand.
Although each state has created its own legislation to
govern the cultivation and distribution of cannabis to
individuals, there is currently little to no guidance or
oversight of associated patient care. Indeed, with the
exception of a few states that have mandated cannabis-
specific physician continuing medical education (e.g.,
New York), the majority of states do not require any
training for either those providing ‘‘recommendations’’
for patient cannabis use (i.e., physicians) or those actu-
ally dispensing cannabis to consumers (i.e., dispensaries
and/or ‘‘bud tenders’’). This is troubling, as cannabis
comprises more than 400 chemical compounds and is
associated with widely variable effects among humans.5
To provide a specific example, empirical literature has
shown that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
primary psychoactive compound in the cannabis plant,
can be anxiogenic, while cannabidiol (CBD), a second-
ary cannabinoid, has anxiolytic effects.6 Next, the liter-
ature would suggest that the provision of cannabis,
comprising high levels of THC, to individuals with
anxiety may be contraindicated.
Although it is important to note that rigorous re-
search on the use of cannabis as a therapeutic remains
in its relative infancy, issues of inconsistent and non-
empirically supported practices by physicians plague
the cannabis and substance use field more broadly.7
So, to offer initial information regarding current prac-
tices by those providing cannabis recommendations to
patients, the present study aimed to document the
training and practices of a sample of dispensary staff
(i.e., ‘‘bud tenders’’). Given its descriptive nature, no
specific hypotheses were forwarded; however, infor-
mation garnered from this study is meant to inform
targeted implementation science efforts aimed at
streamlining provider practices and highlighting the
need for structured education in this emerging industry
that has developed outside traditional mechanisms of
medical drug development.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants included 55 self-identified dispensary staff
members who provided informed consent to complete
an online survey. Dispensary types included medical
(59%), nonmedical (18%), and both medical and non-
medical (23%). The dispensaries were located in Colo-
rado (41%), California (20%), Arizona (16%), Oregon
(2%), District of Columbia (5%), and the Northeast
(10%; Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine).
The locations of the dispensaries were self-reported as fol-
lows: rural (16%), suburban (13%), small city (<300,000;
35%), and large city (>300,000; 36%).
Measures
An online survey was constructed by the study investi-
gators to evaluate the training, knowledge, attitudes,
and practices of dispensary staff. Questions included
demographics (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, sexual orienta-
tion, marital status, education, annual income, dispen-
sary earnings, and hours worked), dispensary features
(i.e., geographical location, zip code, type of dispensa-
ry), and a checklist of primary responsibilities. A di-
chotomous (yes/no) item assessed formal dispensary
training, and if endorsed, the item branched to a check-
list of types of training (e.g., medical, scientific, busi-
ness, customer service) with a textbox for ‘‘other.’’
Additional items assessed the number of patients
served, the percentage of patients who are repeat pa-
trons, and a categorical response choice for how often
repeat customers visit the dispensary. The typical
amount of cannabis purchased per visit was assessed
by having the participant fill in an amount in grams,
ounces, or dollars. A dichotomous (yes/no) item
assessed whether advice, guidance, or counsel is pro-
vided to patients, and if endorsed, the item branched
to a checklist of types of advice (e.g., benefits of can-
nabis and side effects) with a textbox for ‘‘other.’’
Items assessing the medical/psychological symptoms
or conditions reported by patients were indexed on a
3-point Likert scale ranging from ‘‘rarely’’ to ‘‘frequent-
ly.’’ Respondents also checked off which cannabinoid
concentrations (i.e., high THC, high CBD, 1:1 ratio of
THC/CBD) or cannabis plant strain recommendations
(i.e., sativa, indica, hybrid) they made for each of the
symptoms or conditions listed. Attitudes toward work
(e.g., satisfaction, feeling valued, stigma, burnout) were
assessed on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘‘very
satisfied’’ to ‘‘very dissatisfied’’ or ‘‘always’’ to ‘‘never.’’
Procedure
The study was approved by the Palo Alto University
Institutional Review Board (FWA00010885; Protocol#
15-001-S). A Federal Certificate of Confidentiality was
obtained from the National Institutes of Health to protect
participant confidentiality. Dispensaries were identified

 via website finders (i.e., leafly.com, weedmaps.com) and a
contact list from the Americans for Safe Access. From
September 2015 through May 2016, dispensary staff
were invited via e-mail (n=550, with 10% returned as
undeliverable and 20% providing an automated e-mail
response) and/or telephone (n=117) to complete an
anonymous survey. A direct link to the survey was also
posted on a cannabis advocacy organization Facebook
page (i.e., National Organization for the Reform of Mar-
ijuana Laws) and a Reddit subreddit geared toward dis-
pensary staff. Of those who accessed the survey or
clicked on the survey link, 87% provided informed con-
sent to continue. On completion of the survey, 33 partic-
ipants were placed in a lottery drawing for a $25
Amazon.com gift card. To increase rates of participation
in a later wave of recruitment, each participant was com-
pensated with a $10 Amazon.com gift card (n=22).
Survey data were analyzed cross-sectionally using
IBM SPSS Statistics, version 23. Descriptive statistics
provided a profile of dispensary staff characteristics.
One-sample t-tests for proportions were calculated to
compare cannabinoid and strain recommendations
for each patient symptom or condition. Since the sur-
vey allowed for participants to skip items, the reported
numbers for each item may differ.
Results
Participant characteristics
The mean age of participants was 31.9 years (standard
deviation [SD] = 9.8 years), with a range of 22–63 years.
Majority were Caucasian (86%) and 9% identified as
having Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The sexual orien-
tation of participants was heterosexual (67%), bisexual
(22%), homosexual (7%), and asexual (4%). The sample
was 55% female, 33% reported being married or partnered,
and 60% had a college degree or higher. Most (84%)
reported working at the dispensary full-time (>30h) at
an average of $15.00/h (SD=$4.60; Range=$8.00–
$25.00/h). The average duration of employment at the
current dispensary ranged from 1 month to 7 years with
a median of 1 year (M=21.6 months, SD=20.0 months).
Twenty percent of the sample reported working at another
dispensary before their current position.
Dispensary staff training and responsibilities
Dispensary staff were asked whether they received any
formal training for their current position and the type
of training received. In our sample, 55% (n = 30) of staff
members reported some formal training. The types of
training included customer service (35%; n = 19), busi-
ness (26%; n = 14), medical (20%; n = 11), other (20%;
n = 11), and scientific (13%; n = 7). Other training con-
sisted of ‘‘bud tender’’ certification, or courses on can-
nabis (e.g., Cannabis 101), or safety and regulatory
compliance (e.g., SellSmart, METRC).
The dispensary staff described their primary job re-
sponsibilities as follows: customer service (91%; n = 39),
stocking inventory (79%; n = 34), ordering supplies or
dealing with vendors/growers (67%; n = 29), counseling
patients (63%; n = 27), record-keeping (63%; n = 27),
budgeting/finances/accounting
(46%;
n = 20),
and
other responsibilities (25%; n = 14) such as human re-
sources, delivery, marketing, packaging products, and
creating signage.
Dispensary patients
The number of patients served by the dispensaries
ranged from 15 to 5,000 patients per week, with a me-
dian of 425 patients (M = 778.4, SD = 1001.5, n = 50).
On average, M = 69% (SD = 21%) of patients were de-
scribed as repeat or frequent patrons. Repeat patrons
visited the dispensary daily (26%; n = 13), 2 to 3 times
per week (40%; n = 20), once a week (22%; n = 11), or
2 to 3 times per month (12%; n = 6). The average
amount of cannabis purchased per visit was reported
as
M = 10.4 g
(SD = 9.4 g,
n = 31)
or
M = $83.00
(SD = $32.00, Range = $25.00–$150.00, n = 18).
Dispensary staff members were queried on the
symptoms or conditions frequently reported by their
patients (see Fig. 1 for a summary). The most frequent
symptoms included chronic pain (93%; n = 41), insom-
nia (80%; n = 35), and anxiety (80%; n = 35). Approxi-
mately two-thirds of the sample (62%; n = 26) reported
that they always or often check in or follow-up about
their patients’ health status.
Dispensary staff recommendations
Dispensary staff were queried regarding the specific
recommendations they make to patients and on what
information those recommendations are based. A ma-
jority (94%; n = 47) reported that they provide advice,
guidance, or counsel to patients. The type of advice
included information on particular cannabis strains
(88%; n = 44), suggested administration methods (88%;
n = 44), potential cannabis side effects (80%; n = 40), ben-
efits of cannabis for specific symptoms (74%; n = 37), and
other recommendations (22%; n = 11) such as natural
remedies, travel/shipping legal advice, dosing guidelines,
and ailment or disease-specific information. Those who
did not provide advice or counsel indicated that it was

 not part of their role at the dispensary (i.e., driver or de-
livery service). None of the dispensary staff members in-
dicated that they provide advice regarding medications
or drugs other than cannabis to their patients.
Dispensary staff reported making recommendations
for specific strains or formulas of cannabis based on the
following: the particular condition or ailment (89%;
n = 39), the experience of other patients (83%; n = 35),
patient preference or needs (79%; n = 33), their own ex-
perience (71%; n = 30), information obtained from sci-
entific articles (68%; n = 28), dispensary owner or other
staff recommendations (52%; n = 22), information
obtained on websites (48%; n = 20), new variety or un-
usual/rare breed (47%; n = 20), and what needs to get
moved out of inventory (21%; n = 9).
The survey assessed which plant strains (i.e., sativa,
indica, hybrid) and which cannabinoid concentrations
(i.e., high THC, high CBD, 1:1 ratio of THC/CBD)
were recommended for particular symptoms or condi-
tions. Several patient conditions were associated with
specific plant strain recommendations by dispensary
staff (Table 1). Indeed, dispensary staff were more
likely to recommend indica for chronic pain and Tour-
ette’s syndrome than sativa. They were also more likely
to recommend indica for insomnia, anxiety, and night-
mares than both sativa and hybrid plants. They were
more likely to recommend indica and hybrid plants
for PTSD or trauma, and muscle spasms compared to
sativa. In contrast, staff were less likely to recommend
indica for depression than sativa or hybrid plants.
Finally, dispensary staff recommended hybrid strains
more often for ALS than sativa.
In terms of specific cannabinoid recommendations,
dispensary staff were more likely to recommend a 1:1
ratio of THC:CBD for anxiety, PTSD or trauma, and
Crohn’s disease compared to high THC. They were
more likely to recommend high CBD and a 1:1 ratio
for ALS, epilepsy, and muscle spasms compared to
high THC. Dispensary staff were more likely to rec-
ommend high CBD than high THC for arthritis and
Alzheimer’s disease. They were also more likely to rec-
ommend a 1:1 ratio for hepatitis C compared to high
THC or high CBD. Staff were more likely to recom-
mend high THC for appetite than high CBD (Table 2).
Dispensary staff attitudes
Dispensary staff members were asked to rate satisfac-
tion with their current position on a scale ranging

 from very dissatisfied (1) to very satisfied (5). The mean
score for satisfaction was 4.27 (SD = 0.95, n = 41), indi-
cating a high level of satisfaction with their work.
Other
attitudes
toward
dispensary
work
were
assessed on a scale ranging from never (1) to always
(5). Items included the following: feeling valued or ap-
preciated because of work (M = 3.81, SD = 1.13, n = 42),
feeling stigmatized or looked down upon by others for
their work (M = 2.57; SD = 1.06, n = 42), and experienc-
ing burnout or fatigue as a result of work (M = 2.83,
SD = 1.10, n = 42).
Discussion
While a number of studies have examined the charac-
teristics of patients seeking cannabis recommendations
from a physician,3,8 and those obtaining cannabis from
a dispensary,2,9 the present study serves as the first ex-
amination of characteristics and practices of dispensary
staff. Findings indicate that the vast majority of staff
provide specific counseling to patients regarding can-
nabis that may be most helpful for their individual con-
ditions, and that these recommendations are based on a
number of sources, both empirically and nonempirically
based. Despite the vast number of staff members offer-
ing recommendations to patients, only 20% of our sam-
ple reported prior medical and/or scientific training.
In terms of plant strain recommendations, very little
work has documented patient preference or the specific
efficacy of certain cannabis strains as a function of clin-
ical condition. Staff recommendation of indica strains
for chronic pain in the current study was consistent
with individual patient preference observed in other
work.10 The recommendation of indica primarily for
insomnia and nightmares is consistent with one patient
survey,11 but differs from another empirical study that
highlighted patient preference for sativa strains for
sleep difficulties.12 While observations related to strain
recommendations are interesting, due to extensive hy-
bridization and variations in growing conditions, the
differences between cannabis strains do not seem to
play as large a role in determining subjective effects
as cannabinoid concentrations.13 This has led some to

 argue that distinctions among cannabis chemovars la-
beled as ‘‘Sativa’’ or ‘‘Indica’’ are relatively meaningless
unless accompanied by detailed accurate assays of can-
nabinoid and terpenoid content.14
Dispensary staff recommendations of cannabinoid
concentrations (e.g., THC, CBD) for particular patient
symptoms and conditions were also frequently incon-
gruent with the existing empirical literature. For in-
stance, the existing empirical literature would suggest
that cannabis high in CBD could be particularly helpful
for individuals with anxiety disorders, while cannabis
high in THC could actually lead to acute and long-
term anxiety reactions.6,15,16 Early pre-clinical work
has also highlighted CBD as a potential antide-
pressant,15 anticonvulsant,16,17 and therapeutic for
PTSD.15 On the other end of the spectrum, the litera-
ture would suggest that THC may be an antiemetic,
and particularly beneficial for appetite stimulation
and pain.18 Finally, a number of reviews have docu-
mented that a combination of THC and CBD (e.g.,
nabiximols) can have therapeutic value for individuals
with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis,16,19 neuro-
pathic pain,16,20 as well as sleep disturbances.15 Based
on the above literature, it appears that a meaningful
number of dispensary staff are providing recommenda-
tions for cannabinoids that have either not been shown
to be effective for a given condition (e.g., 33% recom-
mending THC for depression, 10% recommending
CBD for appetite, 78% recommending either high THC
or high CBD for multiple sclerosis), or could actually
worsen a patient’s condition (e.g., 13% recommending
THC for anxiety, 7% recommending THC for epilepsy).
Aside from the present study’s contribution to the
literature in terms of describing the characteristics of
cannabis dispensary staff, findings highlight the impor-
tance of consistent, evidence-based training of those pro-
viding specific recommendations of cannabis strains or
cannabinoid concentrations for a given patient condition
(e.g., physicians, dispensary staff). Indeed, while one
might expect the most qualified individuals to provide
specific recommendations of cannabis product to be
trained physicians who are aware of a patient’s medical
history and other prescription medications that could
interact with certain cannabinoids,21–23 it is dispensary

 staff who are the most likely to provide cannabis advice.
As each state is currently responsible for drafting and
monitoring its own cannabis legislation, it is imperative
for states to mandate some form of educational certifica-
tion for any individual providing cannabis advice to pa-
tients, not just physicians. Furthermore, given the
quickly evolving literature in this field, it seems necessary
for individuals to receive regular updates via continuing
medical education. Given the increasing availability and
preferences for myriad methods of cannabis consump-
tion (e.g., edibles, extracts, dabs)2,24 and corresponding
risks,25,26 patient and provider education programs
should strive to include trainings in safe and effective
use of cannabis as a function of preparation.
The present study data, although novel, are not with-
out limitations. First, given the cross-sectional nature
of the investigation, we were unable to determine
changes in staff behavior over time or as a function
of the implementation of particular training programs.
Second, while the utilization of structured surveys
allowed for the systematic and quantitative analysis
of staff characteristics and practices, such surveys are
limited in that they do not allow for nuanced informa-
tion regarding staff behavior. Future prospective qual-
itative work that incorporates open-ended questions
would aid in fleshing out the present findings. Third,
although both medicinal and nonmedical dispensary
staff were recruited, higher response rates in specific
states may limit generalizability of findings to dispensa-
ries across the United States or in other countries.
Web-based recruitment methods also limit our ability
to determine overall sample representativeness. Indeed,
the survey response rate may have been restricted
by perceived stigma associated with both medical and
nonmedical cannabis use and/or skepticism of research-
ers by dispensary staff. Finally, the current study aimed
to describe overall behavior among dispensary staff, and
in doing so the survey did not collect information about
physician practices or detailed information about the
provision of services for certain, particularly vulnerable,
populations (e.g., individuals with PTSD). Limitations
notwithstanding, the present study serves as a ‘‘call to ac-
tion’’ for consistent and evidence-based training of pro-
viders in the cannabis industry.
