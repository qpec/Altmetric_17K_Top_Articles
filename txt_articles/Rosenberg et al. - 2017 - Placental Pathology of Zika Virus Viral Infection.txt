� Context.—The placenta is an important component in
understanding the fetal response to intrauterine Zika virus
infection, but the pathologic changes in this organ remain
largely unknown. Hofbauer cells are fetal-derived macro-
phages normally present in the chorionic villous stroma.
They have been implicated in a variety of physiological and
pathologic processes, in particular involving infectious
agents.
Objectives.—To characterize the fetal and maternal
responses and viral localization in the placenta following
Zika virus transmission to an 11 weeks’ gestation fetus. The
clinical course was notable for prolonged viremia in the
mother and extensive neuronal necrosis in the fetus. The
fetus was delivered at 21 weeks’ gestation after pregnancy
termination.
Design.—The placenta was evaluated by using immu-
nohistochemistry for inflammatory cells (macrophages/
monocytes [Hofbauer cells], B and T lymphocytes) and
proliferating cells, and an RNA probe to Zika virus. The
fetal brain and the placenta were previously found to be
positive for Zika virus RNA by reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction.
Results.—The placenta demonstrated prominently en-
larged, hydropic chorionic villi with hyperplasia and focal
proliferation of Hofbauer cells. The degree of Hofbauer
cell hyperplasia gave an exaggerated immature appearance
to the villi. No acute or chronic villitis, villous necrosis,
remote necroinflammatory abnormalities, chorioamnioni-
tis, funisitis, or hemorrhages were present. An RNA probe
to Zika virus was positive in villous stromal cells,
presumably Hofbauer cells.
Conclusions.—Zika virus placental infection induces
proliferation and prominent hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells
in the chorionic villi but does not elicit villous necrosis or a
maternal or fetal lymphoplasmacellular or acute inflam-
matory cell reaction.

Z
ika virus infection has been confirmed to be a cause of
fetal malformation1—an unprecedented event for an
arthropod-borne infection. The spectrum of disease caused
by Zika virus among adults and children is still being
investigated and defined, but it is clear in the most recent
epidemic in South and Central America, Mexico, and the
Caribbean islands that when infection occurs in pregnant
women, fetuses appear to be at increased risk for a poor
clinical outcome.2–9 The most significant effect of the Zika
virus on the fetus is the occurrence of neuronal necrosis and
microcephaly—this has been demonstrated in neuroimag-
ing studies performed both before delivery and following
the birth of infected infants.2,3,7 Pathology studies have been
shown to be an important component of the public health
investigation of emerging infections, contributing to the
understanding of the mechanisms of tissue injury, for
example, human immunodeficiency virus, Ebola virus,
hantavirus, West Nile virus, and many others.10–13 In those
situations in which infections may be transmitted from
pregnant women to their fetuses, placental pathology can
provide important information on the mechanism(s) of
maternal-fetal (vertical) transmission, the nature of the
inflammatory response of the mother and fetus to the
infection, and the effects of the organisms on the placenta,
such as necrosis, hemorrhage, or vascular disease.14 This
report details the microscopic changes in the placenta from
a
21
weeks’
gestation
fetus
whose
mother
acquired
symptomatic Zika virus infection at 11 weeks’ gestation.15
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Summary
The clinical history of the mother and infant have been
previously described.15 In summary, a 33-year-old pregnant
woman developed symptomatic Zika virus infection after her
return from travel in Central America. She was bitten by
mosquitoes at 11 weeks’ gestational age and subsequently
developed mild fever, myalgia, rash, and ocular pain beginning at
12 weeks’ gestation. Four weeks later, her serum was positive for
immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibodies to Zika virus. A nested
reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) per-
formed at 16 weeks’ gestation confirmed Zika virus in her serum.

 The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta confirmed maternal Zika virus infection with serum
positivity for Zika IgM of greater than 1:2560, using a plaque-
reduction neutralization test at 17 weeks’ gestation. Between the
16th and 20th weeks of gestation, ultrasonography revealed a
decrease in the fetal head circumference from the 47th to the 24th
percentile. Fetal ultrasonography at 19 weeks’ gestation revealed
abnormal intracranial anatomy. Following this, fetal magnetic
resonance imaging at 20 weeks’ gestation demonstrated more
severe abnormalities of the brain, including diffuse atrophy in the
cerebral mantle, absence of the normal lamination patterns of the
cerebral mantle, a short corpus callosum, and mild enlargement of
the third and lateral ventricles. On the day before an elective
termination of the pregnancy at 21 weeks’ gestation, the mother
was found to still have serum positive for Zika virus RNA with a
low viral count (21.1 3 103 copies/mL). The amniotic fluid was also
positive for Zika virus RNA at the time of pregnancy termination.
Following delivery, an autopsy of the fetus was performed that
revealed diffuse cerebral cortical thinning with extensive apoptosis
of postmigratory neurons of the neocortex, micromineralization,
prominent volume loss of the white matter and subventricular
zone, axonal rarefaction, and macrophage infiltration. Viral
particles were seen with electron microscopy, and high loads of
Zika viral RNA were detected with RT-PCR.15 The placenta was
submitted for pathologic examination. Substantial Zika viral loads
were identified in the placenta, extraplacental membranes, and
umbilical cord with quantitative RT-PCR.
Immunohistochemistry
All immunohistochemical staining procedures were performed on
a Leica Bond-MAX (Leica Biosystems, Wetzler, Germany). Antigen
retrieval and antibody conditions are presented in the Table.
RNAscope In Situ Hybridization
In situ expression analyses of mRNA were performed by using a
Zika virus mRNA probe (catalog No. 463781) and developed with
an RNAscope kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc., Newark,
California) by using 3,30-diaminobenzidine-based detection and
hematoxylin counterstain. Briefly, paraffin-embedded sections
were pretreated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Probes
for Zika virus mRNA were applied and positive and negative
control probes (peptidylprolyl isomerase B and dihydrodipicolinate
reductase, respectively) were used to qualify the tissue samples for
use in the in situ hybridization application. A paraffin-embedded
brain section from the same patient served as a positive control for
detection of Zika virus mRNA expression. Individual slides were
viewed on an Olympus Eclipse 55i microscope (Shinjuku, Tokyo,
Japan) and images acquired on a Nikon DS-Fi1 digital camera
(Minato, Tokyo, Japan).
RESULTS
Microscopic examination of the placental disc, using
routine hematoxylin-eosin staining, revealed secondary
and tertiary chorionic villi that were enlarged, even for 21
weeks’ gestation, with focally marked stromal edema
(Figure 1, A through C). Some of the enlarged and
edematous villi had irregular outlines. Most chorionic villi
at all levels demonstrated prominent hypercellularity of the
villous
stroma.
These
stromal
cells
were
of
variable
appearance, from rounded to spindle shaped, and had the
morphologic
features
of
villous
stromal
macrophages
(Hofbauer cells). Some of the Hofbauer cells contained
clear intracytoplasmic vacuoles. No evidence of ongoing or
remote acute or chronic villitis or intervillositis was seen.
Focal and mild intravascular karyorrhexis was present in
some chorionic villus vessels, which we attributed to
recently induced intrauterine fetal demise.16 No villous
necrosis, remote necroinflammatory abnormalities, repara-
tive changes, or villous fibrosis was present. The umbilical
cord
and
extraplacental
membranes
were
normal
for
gestational age—there was no funisitis or chorioamnionitis.
No significant hemorrhages, either acute or remote, were
present in any of the placental tissues. No abnormalities of
the trophoblast were present.
CD163 and CD68 immunostains demonstrated intensely
positive staining in the hyperplastic population of stromal
cells of both secondary and tertiary villi, confirming their
identity as stromal macrophages, or Hofbauer cells. The
CD163 highlighted the intensity of the Hofbauer cell
hyperplasia—in some villi, the macrophages were tightly
packed and confluent (Figure 2, A through F). It was obvious
that the enlargement of the villi was due not only to edema,
but also to Hofbauer cell hyperplasia, which had also
significantly contributed to the greater-than-expected size of
the chorionic villi. Ki-67 demonstrated positive intranuclear
staining in occasional stromal macrophages (Figure 3, A and
B), which was consistent with the presence of a hyperplastic
population of Hofbauer cells. Some cytotrophoblast cells
also expressed Ki-67 staining, which was expected. Stains
for lymphocytes and plasma cells confirmed the impression
that there was no villitis.
In situ hybridization using a Zika virus RNA probe
demonstrated scattered, strongly positive staining cells
within the villous stroma of the chorionic villi (Figure 4),
which were presumably Hofbauer cells.
DISCUSSION
Together with epidemiologic, clinical, and radiologic
investigations, autopsy pathology studies have significantly
contributed to the consensus conclusion that the Zika virus
can produce destructive lesions of the fetal brain and
microcephaly.15,17–23 There now remains no doubt that Zika

 virus can reach the placenta during maternal viremia, be
transmitted to the developing fetus, and cause brain
damage, microcephaly, other malformations (congenital
Zika syndrome) and, in some, cases, perinatal death. In all
published autopsies of fetuses and neonates with micro-
cephaly from mothers clinically suspected or confirmed as
having Zika virus infection during pregnancy, the virus has
been identified in the fetal brain tissue; it has also been
identified from other fetal organs and the amniotic fluid.23–25
In vitro studies have provided evidence that Zika virus has
an affinity for infecting cells of neural origin.26–28 A murine
model of congenital Zika virus transmission has been
developed, which has demonstrated fetal demise, brain
damage, and Zika virus present in trophoblast, consistent
with transplacental infection.29 However, the mouse pla-
centa is chorioallantoic, making it difficult to extrapolate
these findings to the human hemomonochorial placenta.
Because of the severity of the autopsy pathology findings
in the central nervous system of the fetus, the placental
findings in this present case of absence of necrosis or
inflammation were unexpected. There was no evidence of
ongoing, remote, acute or chronic villitis or intervillositis,
either by routine histologic staining or by using antibodies
to neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Villitis is
typically present in most maternal blood-borne infections
that are vertically transmitted, including infections by
protozoal (Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis), bacterial (Liste-
ria, syphilis, and gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria),
and viral (rubella, cytomegalovirus) agents.30 In addition to
producing a maternally or fetally derived inflammatory
reaction in the chorionic villi, which may be accompanied by
villous necrosis, transplacental transmission of these agents
also produces inflammation and cell necrosis in the fetal
somatic organs. Zika virus appears to be different from some
TORCH agents (such as cytomegalovirus, Treponema palli-
dum [syphilis], Toxoplasma, and rubella virus) and other
hematogenously transmitted infections in transiting from
the maternal to the fetal circulatory systems through the
placenta, producing a range of tissue-destructive abnormal-
ities in the fetal brain, and yet not eliciting a maternal or
fetal inflammatory leukocytic response in the placenta. This
is indicative of a highly selective predilection of the virus for
cells of the central nervous system.
The most striking observation in the placenta was a
prominent and diffuse hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells. These
cells are of monocytic derivation and are, along with
fibroblasts, a normal component of the stroma of the
chorionic villi. Hofbauer cells are of fetal origin, and they
first appear in the chorionic villi at the 10th to 18th days of
gestation. Because this predates the development of a fetal
circulation,
they
are
believed
to
initially
be
of
fetal
mesenchymal origin, derived from monocyte progenitor
cells of the hypoblast-derived yolk sac that have migrated to
the mesenchymal core of the villi. Later in gestation, it has
been suggested that they are derived from a population of
recruited fetal monocytes.31,32 Hofbauer cells have many
histologic features of macrophages in other organs—they
are large (10-30–lm diameter) cells with cytoplasmic
processes, and contain large vacuoles, pinocytotic vesicles,
and intracytoplasmic granules. They have been character-
ized as M2/alternatively activated macrophages,33 and their
function includes phagocytosis of fluids and apoptotic
materials, antigen presentation in response to infectious
agents, and possibly an angiogenic role in early placental
vasculogenesis, maintenance of placental water balance, and
an endocrine function. Because Hofbauer cells can vary in
size and shape, they can easily be confused with mononu-
clear inflammatory cells, and especially plasma cells, leading
to an erroneous diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic or
plasmacellular villitis (Figure 1, C). In placentas from normal

As can be seen in (C), some of the Hofbauer cells resemble plasma

 gestations, Hofbauer cells become few in number by the
fourth to fifth month of gestation, and immunohistochem-
istry with antibodies to macrophages/monocytes may be
necessary to visualize them.31,32,34 Hyperplasia of Hofbauer
cells is abnormal and has been reported to occur as a result
of a wide variety of pathologic conditions of pregnancy.
These include ascending infections,35 villitis of unknown
etiology,36 and maternal blood-borne infections that cause
villitis including TORCH infections such as syphilis and
cytomegalovirus infection,37,38 and Chagas disease.39 The
mechanism(s) by which Hofbauer cell hyperplasia occurs in
response to an inciting factor is, at least in part, the result of
proliferation of these cells within the chorionic villous
stroma. Hofbauer cells have been observed to contain
mitotic figures.40 The ability of Hofbauer cells to proliferate
within the chorionic villous stroma has been confirmed by
using antibodies to cellular proliferation markers such as Ki-
67.41,42

characteristic macrophage appearance of the Hofbauer cells. E and F, CD163 staining reveals that the hyperplastic population of Hofbauer cells
extends from immediately subjacent to the trophoblast basement membrane zone into the core of the villus and around villous capillaries (original
magnifications 340 [A], 3100 [B], 3200 [C], and 3400 [D, E, and F]).

Placental Pathology of Zika Virus—Rosenberg et al
 In the present case, symptomatic maternal infection began
at 11 weeks’ gestation while visiting an area endemic for
Zika virus, after which the mother was confirmed to have
Zika virus infection with both serologic and RT-PCR
methods. Her serum remained positive for Zika virus RNA
up to the day before the termination of pregnancy at 21
weeks’
gestation.15
It
appears
clear
that
during
the
approximate 10-week period from initial symptomatology
and prolonged duration of maternal viremia before the
demise of the fetus, transplacental transmission of Zika virus
to the fetus occurred, resulting in activation, induction of
proliferation, and eventually, a prominently hyperplastic
population of Hofbauer cells. We can surmise that this
placental reaction began soon (rather than later) after the
onset of maternal infection and viremia. This is based on the
obstetrical ultrasound evidence of an initial decrease in the
relative percentile of fetal head growth documented at 16
weeks’ gestation, and the extent of Hofbauer cell hyperpla-
sia in the chorionic villi with relatively few stromal
macrophages in the proliferative stage of the cell cycle by
the time of delivery of the fetus and placenta.
We have demonstrated that 9 weeks after initial maternal
symptomatology and prolonged maternal viremia, the
placenta still had detectable Zika virus present within
stromal (Hofbauer) cells of the chorionic villi together with
Hofbauer cell hyperplasia. The significance of the occur-
rence
of
Hofbauer
cell
proliferation
and
hyperplasia,
together with the demonstration of residual virus in these
stromal cells following transplacental fetal infection, is
especially interesting in light of a recent investigation that
has demonstrated that Zika virus can experimentally infect,
and subsequently replicate in, human Hofbauer cells. In this
study, Quicke et al43 found that Hofbauer cells isolated from
term human placentas were permissive to infection by a
contemporary strain of Zika virus that is currently circulating
in the Americas. Following in vitro infection of Hofbauer
cells by Zika virus, viral replication was documented in these
cells, which was accompanied by induction of type I
interferon and proinflammatory cytokines. Viral infection
also resulted in a modest activation of Hofbauer cells in
which there was upregulation of retinoic acid–inducible
gene
I
(RIG-I)–like
receptor
transcription
as
well as
downstream antiviral effector genes, thus indicating that
Zika virus infection of Hofbauer cells induced an antiviral
response. The finding by these investigators that in vitro
infection and replication of Zika virus infection resulted in
only minimal cellular necrosis is especially interesting
because of our findings of a lack of recent or remote
necrosis in the placental chorionic villi of the infected fetus
from this report. Also of significance in light of our findings
is the recent report by Martines and colleagues44 who
describe the immunohistochemical identification of Zika
virus antigens within Hofbauer cells in chorionic villi from
the placenta of a fetus that was spontaneously aborted at 11
weeks’ gestation.
It is still not well understood what role(s) the Hofbauer
cell has in facilitating or inhibiting transplacental transmis-
sion of infectious agents such as the Zika virus. However,
based on the demonstration in this communication of
proliferation and prominent hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells in
the placenta from a microcephalic fetus infected early in
gestation, the identification of residual Zika virus in villous
stromal cells, using an RNA probe, and the previously
published results of in vitro infection and replication of Zika
virus in human Hofbauer cells, it appears highly probable
that the Hofbauer cell has an important, or even primary,
role in those cases where transplacental transmission of the
Zika virus does occur. The unexpected absence in placental
tissues of any necrosis or leukocytic response by the mother
