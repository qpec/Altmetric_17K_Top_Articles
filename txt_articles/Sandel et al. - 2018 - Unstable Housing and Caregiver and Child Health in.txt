OBJECTIVES: To evaluate how 3 forms of housing instability relate to caregiver and child health 
among low-income renter households.
METHODS: Caregivers of children 0 to 48 months of age were interviewed in 5 urban 
medical centers from May 2009 to December 2015. Caregivers reported on the following: 
caregiver health, maternal depressive symptoms, child’s health, lifetime hospitalizations, 
developmental risk, and 3 housing circumstances, which were categorized as being behind 
on rent in the past 12 months, multiple moves (≥ 2 in past 12 months), and child’s lifetime 
history of homelessness. Associations with caregiver and child health outcomes were 
examined through multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 22 324 families, 34% had at least 1 of the following adverse housing 
circumstances: 27% had been behind on rent, 8% had made multiple moves, and 12% 
had a history of being homeless. Overlap between these was limited; 86% experienced 
only 1 adverse housing circumstance. Each circumstance was individually associated 
with increased adjusted odds of adverse health and material hardship compared with 
stable housing. Households behind on rent had increased adjusted odds of fair and/
or poor caregiver health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.77–2.05), maternal depressive symptoms (aOR: 2.71; 95% CI: 2.51–2.93), child lifetime 
hospitalizations (aOR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.10–1.27), fair and/or poor child health (aOR: 1.41; 
95% CI: 1.28–1.56), and household material hardships. Families with multiple moves 
and history of homelessness had similar adverse caregiver, child, health, and hardship 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Three forms of housing instability were associated with adverse caregiver and 
child health among low-income renter households. The American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends social screening within health care; providers could consider assessing for 
behind on rent, multiple moves, and homelessness in high-risk practices.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Unstable housing 
circumstances, including homelessness, are critical 
social determinants of adult and child health. However, 
many housing instability definitions are limited to only 
homelessness or multiple moves and do not include rent 
strain.
What this study adds: Rent strain, defined as “behind 
on rent, 
” is the most prevalent form of housing instability 
with little overlap with multiple moves or homelessness. 
All 3 forms were associated with adverse health 
outcomes for caregivers and young children.

 No universally accepted definition  
of housing instability exists,  
although housing circumstances  
are widely acknowledged as a  
key social determinant of health. 
Some authorities define housing 
instability by high housing costs 
relative to income (more than 
30% of a household’s gross 
monthly income), poor housing 
quality, unstable neighborhoods, 
overcrowding, and homelessness.1, 
 
2  
Others have used different metrics 
for housing instability, including 
multiple moves, eviction, and 
difficulty paying rent, mortgage, 
or utilities.3 
– 
9 We have previously 
examined health, developmental, 
and anthropometric correlates of 
housing insecurity among children 
younger than 3 years of age, using 
crowding (> 2 people per bedroom 
or > 1 family per residence) and 
multiple moves (≥ 2 moves within 
the previous year) as forms of 
housing insecurity.7 Examining the 
association between different aspects 
of housing instability and health 
outcomes among at-risk populations 
simultaneously rather than in 
isolation will assist in understanding 
the contribution of each circumstance 
separately and concomitantly.
On the basis of our previous research 
and a review of the literature, we 
identified distinct forms of housing 
instability associated with inadequate 
access to care and adverse health 
outcomes.5, 
 
7, 
 
10, 
 
11 Multiple moves 
have been associated with adverse 
mental health, educational, and 
behavioral outcomes in children, 
and diminished physical and 
mental health in adulthood.12 
– 
20 
Homelessness has been linked with 
multiple adverse health outcomes for 
children, including fair and/or poor 
health and developmental risk.21, 
22 
Difficulty paying rent, mortgage, or 
utilities (ie, housing costs > 30% of a 
household’s gross monthly income), 
or anxiety about other financial 
obligations also serve as markers of 
housing instability.5, 
 
7, 
 
23 
– 
26 Inability to 
pay rent or mortgage and associated 
financial hardship may lead to 
homelessness. Given the evidence 
that racial and ethnic subgroups, 
specifically African Americans and 
Hispanics, have higher housing 
hardship at all income levels and are 
shown to have worse outcomes for 
many health outcomes and statuses, 
housing instability could contribute 
to racial and ethnic disparities in 
health outcomes.27 
–30 Adults in 
households behind on rent are also 
at risk for depression.31 However, 
associations between being behind 
on rent as a form of financial strain 
afflicting parents of young children 
and correlations with children’s 
health and development and other 
household material hardships have 
not been previously assessed.
Our goal in this study was to 
examine associations between 3 
unstable housing circumstances and 
adverse caregiver and child health 
outcomes and to examine if there 
was overlap among these 3 housing 
circumstances. We hypothesized 
that each one of the 3 housing 
circumstances would be strongly 
associated with adverse health 
outcomes and other health-related 
household hardships among this 
at-risk population of low-income 
renter households with young 
children.32
Methods
study sample and Procedures
Children’s HealthWatch conducted 
household-level surveys and medical 
record audits from May 1, 2009 
to December 31, 2015 in primary 
care clinics (Baltimore, MD and 
Minneapolis, MN) and pediatric 
emergency departments (Baltimore, 
MD; Boston, MA; Little Rock, AR; 
and Philadelphia, PA). Institutional 
review board approval was obtained 
at each site and renewed yearly. 
Caregivers were approached to be 
screened for participation; 31 250 
(93%) agreed to be screened, and 
26 845 (80%) were eligible and 
completed the interview. Eligibility 
criteria for the current analysis 
included public or no health 
insurance (as proxy for low income); 
child’s age ≤ 48 months; research 
site state residency; caregiver’s 
ability to speak English, Spanish, 
or Somali (in Minneapolis only); 
respondent living in the child’s 
household; and consent to be 
interviewed. For this study, only 
renter households were included 
to better represent families most 
vulnerable to housing instability. This 
resulted in a final sample size for the 
current analysis of 22 324 caregiver 
and child dyads.
demographic Measures
Caregivers provided information on 
their age, self-identified race and/or 
ethnicity, country of origin, marital 
and employment status, highest level 
of education attained, and children’s 
health insurance and breastfeeding 
history. Children’s age and sex were 
obtained from medical records.
dependent Variables
Caregiver Health Outcome Measures
Caregiver health outcomes were 
self-reported current health statuses 
and maternal depressive symptoms. 
Caregivers characterized their health 
as excellent, good, fair, or poor 
using a question from the 1988 to 
1994 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey. Depressive 
symptoms were measured only in 
mothers via a 3-item screening test 
developed for maternal depression, 
with sensitivity of 100%, specificity 
of 88%, and positive predictive 
value of 66% in comparison with the 
8-item Rand screening instrument.33 
As recommended by the author, the 
3-item instrument was considered 
positive if a respondent had a 
positive response to any 2 of the 3 
items.

 Child Health Outcome Measures
Caregivers reported their perception 
of their child’s health as fair, poor, 
good, or excellent, adapted from the 
single, validated question from the 
Third National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey, and their child’s 
lifetime history of hospitalizations, 
excluding at birth.34, 
 
35 Developmental 
risk was measured with the Parents’ 
Evaluation of Developmental Status 
(PEDS), which meets standards set by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
for developmental screening tests for 
children from birth through age 7.36 
–38 
We limited our sample to children ≥ 
4 months of age (n = 18 754) for the 
developmental outcome because of 
better sensitivity and specificity of 
PEDS for children ≥ 4 months of age 
and used recommended scoring to 
determine those at developmental 
risk (2 or more concerns).36
Children’s weight and length on the 
day of the interview were recorded 
by interviewers or obtained through 
medical record review. At risk of 
being underweight was defined 
as weight-for-age less than fifth 
percentile or weight-for-height  
< 10th percentile, according to 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention growth standards.39
Material Hardship Measures
We measured other household 
material hardships associated 
with poor health and development 
outcomes, including household food 
insecurity and child food insecurity, 
as defined by the 18-item US 
Food Security Survey Module and 
categorized households as “food 
secure” or “insecure” in accordance 
with established procedures.40 
Energy insecurity was measured by 
4 questions as defined in previous 
Children’s HealthWatch research 
and was shown to be associated with 
adverse maternal and child health 
outcomes.41 
– 
46 When a respondent 
affirmed none of these 4 questions, 
her or his household was categorized 
as “energy secure.” Health care 
hardships were defined by questions 
that were used to explore both unmet 
needs for health care services and/
or prescriptions for the index child or 
other household members because 
of household inability to afford care 
(“foregone care”) and, conversely, 
paying for medical care, thus being 
unable to afford other basic needs 
such as food, housing, or utilities 
(“health cost sacrifices”).
independent Variables
Housing Instability Measures Regarding 
Housing Circumstances
Measures of housing instability were 
as follows: 
1. Being behind on rent, as defined 
by endorsing the following 
question, “During the last 12 
months, was there a time when 
you were not able to pay the 
mortgage or rent on time?” As 
described above, the sample was 
restricted to only renters; 
2. Multiple moves as defined by the 
following question, “In the past 12 
months, how many places has the 
child lived?” A child who has lived 
in 3 or more places in the past 
year is equivalent to 2 or more or 
“multiple moves;” and
3. Current homelessness, as defined 
by the following question, 
“What type of housing does the 
child live in?” and endorsing 
currently living in a shelter, 
motel, temporary or transitional 
living situation, scattered site 
housing, or no steady place to 
sleep at night. We also assessed 
history of homelessness in the 
child’s lifetime, as defined by 
the following question, “Since 
the child was born, has she or he 
ever been homeless or lived in 
a shelter?” and endorsing lived 
in a shelter, motel, temporary 
or transitional living situation, 
scattered site housing, or no 
steady place to sleep at night. 
These 2 groups (current 
homelessness and history of 
homelessness) were combined 
into a single “homeless” group.
Each measure was compared with 
stable housing, which was defined as 
the absence of all 3 measures.
Caregiver and Child Health Associations 
With Each Housing Circumstance
We tested for significant associations 
between the 3 housing circumstances 
noted, caregiver and child health 
outcomes, and household material 
hardships. First, the 3 circumstances 
of housing instability were tested 
individually for their associations 
with poor health and household 
outcomes compared with those 
not experiencing the following 
conditions: behind on rent in the 
past year, multiple moves in the 
past year, and current or previous 
homelessness. We measured these 
circumstances as binary measures, 
which have significant individual 
associations with children’s health 
outcomes in adjusted analyses 
previously published or presented 
but that have not previously been 
tested together (results available on 
request).7, 
 
44 
– 
46
Second, a “stable housing” 
comparison group was created, which 
consisted of no endorsement on any 
of the 3 housing circumstances (not 
behind on rent in past 12 months, 
fewer than 2 moves in past 12 
months, and no homelessness in 
child’s lifetime). We then performed 
separate multivariable logistic 
regression analyses for each of the 
3 housing circumstances compared 
with stable housing. Adjusted 
odds ratios (aORs) for outcomes 
among the 3 circumstances were 
examined for their associations with 
adverse caregiver or child health 
and household material hardships 
compared with stable housing.
Lastly, we examined the potential 
cumulative impact of the 3 housing 
circumstances. One categorical 
variable with 4 mutually exclusive 
levels was created: stable housing 
(none of the 3 adverse housing

Downloaded from 
 circumstances), only 1 adverse 
housing condition, 2 adverse housing 
circumstances, and all 3 adverse 
housing circumstances. We tested 
whether experiencing 1, 2, or all 
3 forms of housing instability was 
associated with greater adjusted 
odds of adverse health outcomes 
for caregivers and children and 
other household material hardships. 
Because there is no gold standard 
measure or even a professional 
consensus on the definition of 
housing instability, we were not 
able to assess the study questions’ 
formal sensitivity and specificity in 
identifying housing instability.
statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics were used 
to characterize the study sample 
overall and to stratify by each of 
the 3 housing circumstances. χ2 and 
Student’s t tests were used to assess 
differences between groups. Separate 
multivariable logistic regression 
models were fit to determine 
associations between each housing 
instability circumstance, caregiver 
and child health and development, 
and household material hardships. 
To examine the cumulative effect 
of multiple adverse housing 
circumstances, we fit multivariable 
logistic regression models comparing 
families with 1, 2, or 3 adverse 
housing circumstances to families 
with stable housing for each of the 
outcomes noted above. All models 
were adjusted for site; caregiver’s 
race and/or ethnicity, age, education, 
employment, marital status, and if he 
or she was US-born or an immigrant; 
child’s breastfeeding history; child’s 
age; and survey year. Child’s age 
was not included in caregiver health 
outcome models because it was not 
statistically significant in bivariate 
analyses. aORs and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) are reported for 
all models. Two-tailed tests and a 
significance level of 0.05 were used 
for all hypothesis testing. We used 
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC) for all analyses.
Results
sample characteristics
Among the sample (N = 22 324), 
the mean age of caregivers was 
26.6 years (SD 5.8); 52.6% were 
African American, non-Hispanic; 
31.9% were Hispanic; 12.1% 
were white, non-Hispanic; 3.4% 
were other racial and/or ethnic 
categories. Ninety-three percent of 
caregivers were biological mothers; 
5% were biological fathers; and 2% 
were other (ie, adoptive mother 
or father, foster mother or father, 
grandmother or grandfather, aunt 
or uncle, other relative). Seventy-six 
percent of caregivers were US born, 
32.7% were married, 40.2% were 
employed, and 72.7% had a high 
school education or more. The mean 
age of children was 18.6 months (SD 
13.3), 46.2% were female, and 95.9% 
were publicly insured. Most of the 
children’s households participated 
in the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (67.2%) and 
the Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants and 
Children (76.7%), whereas only 
approximately one-fourth currently 
received subsidized housing 
(22.0%), Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program (22.5%), or 
Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families (26.2%). Thirty-four percent 
of participants reported at least 
1 adverse housing circumstance. 
Twenty-seven percent of participants 
reported being behind on rent, 8.0% 
reported multiple moves within 
the past year, and 12.0% reported 
current or previous homelessness 
within the child’s lifetime (Table 1).
adjusted analyses
In comparing adverse housing 
circumstances to the composite 
referent group of stable housing, 
and after controlling for potential 
confounders, we found an association 
between each housing instability 
circumstance and adverse caregiver 
health outcomes, child health 
and development outcomes, and 
household hardships (Table 2).
Compared with caregivers in stable 
housing, caregivers who were behind 
on rent had increased adjusted odds 
of fair and/or poor health (aOR: 1.91; 
95% CI: 1.77–2.05) and maternal 
depressive symptoms (aOR: 2.71; 
95% CI: 2.51–2.93). Compared with 
children in stable housing, children 
in households behind on rent had 
increased adjusted odds of lifetime 
hospitalizations (aOR: 1.19; 95% CI: 
1.10–1.27) and fair and/or poor child 
health (aOR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.28–
1.56). There were no statistically 
significant associations with 
developmental risk or underweight 
status. Households behind on rent 
also experienced increased adjusted 
odds of other household hardships, 
including the following: household 
food insecurity (aOR: 4.93; 95% CI: 
4.58–5.30), child food insecurity 
(aOR: 4.14; 95% CI: 3.78–4.54), 
energy insecurity (aOR: 4.28; 95% CI: 
3.98–4.60), household foregone care 
(aOR: 3.06; 95% CI: 2.83–3.31), child 
foregone care, (aOR: 3.08; 95% CI: 
2.69–3.52), and health cost sacrifices 
(aOR: 4.24; 95% CI: 3.83–4.70).
Compared with caregivers in stable 
housing, caregivers with multiple 
moves had increased adjusted 
odds of fair and/or poor health 
(aOR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.96–2.53) and 
maternal depressive symptoms 
(aOR: 3.67; 95% CI: 3.22–4.17). 
Among children in households with 
multiple moves compared with 
those in stable housing, we identified 
a nonsignificant association with 
lifetime hospitalizations (aOR: 
1.11; 95% CI: 0.97–1.26), increased 
adjusted odds of fair and/or poor 
health (aOR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.19–
1.68), and of developmental risk 
(aOR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.08–1.53). 
There were no statistically significant 
associations with underweight status. 
Households with multiple moves also

95% CI: 1.12–1.41), fair and/or

CI: 1.36–1.86), and developmental 
risk (aOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.08–1.47). 
There were no statistically significant 
associations with underweight status. 
Households with homelessness also 
experienced increased adjusted odds 
of household hardships, including the 
following: household food insecurity 
(aOR: 4.43; 95% CI: 3.96–4.96), child 
food insecurity (aOR: 4.12; 95% CI: 
3.59–4.71), energy insecurity (aOR: 
1.27; 95% CI: 1.12–1.44), household 
foregone care (aOR: 2.82; 95% CI: 
2.48–3.21), child foregone care, (aOR: 
2.63; 95% CI: 2.15–3.22), and health 
cost sacrifices (aOR: 3.31; 95% CI: 
2.76–3.96).
As summarized in Fig 1, there 
was limited overlap between the 
3 adverse housing circumstances. 
In our study, 6529 households 
(86.0%) experienced only 1 adverse 
housing circumstance, 979 (13.0%) 
experienced 2 adverse housing 
circumstances, and 106 (1.0%) 
experienced all 3 adverse housing 
circumstances. As the number of 
adverse housing circumstances 
increased, adjusted odds of caregiver 
and child health risks and material 
hardships increased as well (Table 3). 
If only homelessness and multiple 
moves were used to identify at-risk 
families, 64% (4848) of at-risk 
families (7614) would not be 
identified, as shown in Fig 1.
discussion
There are 3 important aspects of 
this study. First, 1 out of every 3 
low-income renter households 
experienced at least 1 form of 
housing instability. Each of the 3 
forms tested were individually 
associated with increased risk of 
adverse caregiver and child health 
status and household material 
hardship. Second, we demonstrate 
that the 3 examined adverse housing 
circumstances have little overlap 
and each is important to identifying 
risk for adverse health status and 
material hardships among families in 
rental housing with young children. 
Of note, 2 out of 3 families were at 
risk because of being behind on rent, 
underscoring this circumstance as 
a previously unrecognized form of 
unstable housing that is meaningful 
for caregiver and child health. Third, 
families identified as housing unstable 
had dramatically increased odds of 
household and child food insecurity.
There are several limitations in this 
study. First, as previously stated, 
because there is no formalized 
definition of housing instability, 
there is no gold standard housing 
instability assessment against 
which these housing circumstances 
can be compared. For this reason, 
standard evaluation of a diagnostic 
tool testing sensitivity and specificity 
cannot be conducted. Second, data 
used in these analyses included a 
large, multisite, clinical sample of 
predominantly urban, low-income 
families of young children. Although 
there is a strong link between 
poverty and housing instability, 
these housing circumstances have 
not yet been tested in a population 
of varying socioeconomic status,

 homeowners, rural populations, or 
families without young children. 
Third, demonstrated in the cross-
sectional design of this study is 
association, not causation, and we 
acknowledge that the associations 
(eg, housing instability and maternal 
caregiver depression) may be bi- or 
multidirectional. Finally, as with any 
self-report measure, these housing 
circumstances and some of the 
outcomes are subject to reporting 
bias and shared method variance.7
Despite these limitations, these 3 
forms of housing instability have 
important clinical implications for all 
practitioners who work with young 
children and families. Together, 
they represent an effective way to 
identify families at risk for adverse 
health circumstances and hardships 
associated with unstable housing. 
These questions can be administered 
in pediatric offices, by clinicians or 
practitioners working with young 
families in social service settings 
(departments of social services, school 
systems, housing assistance programs, 
etc), or by housing and community 
groups to assess individual and 
community-level needs.
conclusions
The inclusion of questions that are 
used to identify housing instability 
in social determinants of health 
screening can potentially assist 
in targeting services to individual 
families and better understanding 
community needs. With the following 
3 unstable housing circumstances: 
behind on rent in the past 12 months, 
2 or more moves in the past 12 
months, and history of homelessness 
in the child’s lifetime, we have 
demonstrated associations with 
adverse caregiver and child health 
status and other household hardships. 
Given the minimal overlap between 
these 3 housing circumstances, each 
may need to be assessed to identify 
families most at risk for adverse 
caregiver and child health among low-
income renter households.
