Abstract
Background—The analysis of circulating microparticles in pregnancy is of revolutionary 
potential as it represents an in vivo ‘biopsy’ of active gestational tissues.
Objectives—We hypothesize that circulating microparticle signaling will differ in pregnancies 
that experience spontaneous preterm birth from those delivering at term and that these differences 
will be evident many weeks in advance of clinical presentation.
Study Design—Utilizing plasma specimens obtained between 10–12 weeks gestation as part of 
a prospectively collected birth cohort where pregnancy outcomes are independently validated by 
two board certified Maternal Fetal Medicine physicians, 25 singleton cases of spontaneous preterm 
birth ≤34 weeks were matched by maternal age, race, and gestational age of sampling (+/− 2 
weeks) to 50 uncomplicated term deliveries. Circulating microparticles s from these first trimester 
specimens were isolated and analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry for 
potential protein biomarkers following from previous studies. Markers with robust univariate

 performance in correlating spontaneous preterm birth were further evaluated for their biological 
relevance via a combined functional profiling/pathway analysis, and for multivariate performance.
Results—Among the 132 proteins evaluated, 62 demonstrated robust power of detecting 
spontaneous preterm birth in bootstrap receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis at a false 
discovery rate of < 20% estimated via label permutation. Differential dependency network analysis 
identified spontaneous preterm birth -associated co-expression patterns linked to biological 
processes of inflammation, wound healing, and the coagulation cascade. Linear modeling of 
spontaneous preterm birth using a multiplex of the candidate biomarkers with a fixed sensitivity of 
80% exhibited a specificity of 83% with median area under the curve of 0.89. These result indicate 
strong potential of multivariate model development for informative risk stratification.
Conclusion—This project has identified functional proteomic factors with associated biological 
processes that are already unique in their expression profiles at 10–12 weeks among women who 
go on to deliver spontaneously ≤34 weeks. These changes, with further validation, will allow the 
stratification of patients at risk of spontaneous preterm birth before clinical presentation.

Introduction
Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and death in children less than 5 years 
of age, with deliveries at the earlier gestational ages exhibiting a dramatically increased 
risk.1,2 Compared with infants born after 38 weeks, the composite rate of neonatal morbidity 
doubles for each earlier gestational week of delivery.3 In 2005, the cumulative annual 
expense of preterm birth within the Unites States was estimated to be in excess of $26.2 
billion.4 Approximately two thirds of preterm births are spontaneous, meaning they are not 
associated with medical intervention, in nature.5,6 Yet, despite the compelling nature of this 
condition, there has been little recent advancement in our understanding of the etiology of 
spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). While there is an increasing consensus that SPTB 
represents a syndrome rather than a single pathologic entity, it has been both ethically and 
physically difficult to study the pathophysiology of the utero-placental interface.7 The 
evolving field of circulating microparticle (CMP) biology may offer a solution to these 
difficulties as these particles present a sampling of the utero-placental environment. 
Additionally, studying the contents of these particles holds the promise of identifying novel 
blood-based, and possibly clinically useful, biomarkers.
Microparticles are membrane-bound nanovesicles that range in size from 50–300 nm and 
shed by a wide variety of cell types. Microparticle nomenclature varies, but typically 
microparticles between 50–100 nm are called exosomes, those >100 nm are termed 
microvesicles and other terms, such as microaggregates, are often used in literature. Unless 
otherwise stated, we will use the term microparticle as a general reference to all of these 
species. Increasingly, microparticles are recognized as important means of intercellular 
communication in physiologic, pathophysiologic and apoptotic circumstances. While the 
contents of different types of microparticles vary with cell type and their expression, they

 can include nuclear, cytosolic and membrane proteins as well as lipids and messenger and 
micro RNAs.8–11 Their contents hold information regarding the state of the cell type origin 
at the time of microparticle expression; thus, they represent an unique ‘window’ in ‘real-
time’ into the activities of cells, tissues and organs that might otherwise be remote to 
sampling.
A high proportion of adverse pregnancy outcomes have their pathophysiologic origins at the 
utero-placental interface in early pregnancy.7,12,13 The ability to understand protein 
signaling and state of associated tissue and cell populations may be predictive of impending 
complications. Our present analysis will demonstrate the ability to capture informative, 
microparticle-related, protein signaling at the end of the first trimester (mean, 11 weeks). We 
will further demonstrate that this signaling discriminates between pregnancies delivering at 
gestational ages marked by considerable neonatal morbidity (≤34 weeks) compared with 
those delivering at term.
Materials and Methods
Clinical Specimen Collection
Maternal K2-EDTA plasma samples (10–12 weeks gestation) were obtained and stored at 
−80°C at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Boston between 2009–2014 as part of the 
prospectively collected LIFECODES birth cohort.14 Eligibility criteria included patients 
who were ≥18yrs of age, initiated their prenatal care at ≤15 weeks of gestation and planned 
on delivering at the BWH. Exclusion criteria included preexisting medical disorders 
(preexisting diabetes, gestational diabetes, autoimmune disorders, current cancer diagnosis, 
HIV, Hepatitis), fetal anomalies, and was restricted to singleton gestations. Gestational age 
of pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasound scanning ≤12 weeks gestation. If consistent with 
last menstrual period (LMP) dating, the LMP was used to determine the due date. If not 
consistent, then the due date was set by the earliest available ultrasound. Full-term birth was 
defined as ≥37 weeks of gestation, and preterm birth for the purposes of this investigation 
was defined as SPTB ≤34 weeks. The lower limit of the gestational age was set at 23 weeks. 
All cases were independently reviewed and validated by two board certified Maternal Fetal 
Medicine physicians. When disagreement in pregnancy outcome or characteristic arose, the 
case was re-reviewed and a consensus conference held to determine the final 
characterization. Twenty-five singleton cases of SPTB ≤34 weeks (N=8 preterm labor, N=12 
premature rupture of membranes, N=5 cervical insufficiency) were matched to two control 
term deliveries by maternal age, race, and gestational age of sampling (+/− 2 weeks). The 
protocol was approved by institutional review board at BWH, and written informed consent 
was obtained from all participating women.
CMP Enrichment
Plasma samples were shipped on dry ice to the David H Murdock Research Institute 
(DHMRI, Kannapolis, NC) and randomized by NX Prenatal to blind laboratory personnel 
performing sample processing and testing to case/control status. CMP’s were enriched by 
Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and isocratically eluted using the NeXosome Elution 
Reagent (in-house proprietary reagent). Briefly, PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare Life

 Sciences) were packed with 10mL of 2% Agarose Bead Standard (pore size 50 – 150 um) 
from ABT (Miami, FL), washed with Elution Reagent and stored at 4°C for a minimum of 
24 hrs and no longer than 3 days prior to use. On the day of use columns were again washed 
and 1 mL of thawed neat plasma sample was applied to the column. The circulating 
microparticles were captured in the column void volume, partially resolved from the high 
abundant protein peak.15 The samples were processed in batches of 15 to 20 across 4 days to 
minimize variability between processing individual samples. One aliquot of the pooled CMP 
column fraction from each clinical specimen, containing 200ug of total protein (determined 
by BCA) was transferred to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube (VWR) and shipped on dry ice to 
Biognosys (Zurich, Switzerland) for proteomic analysis.
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
Quantitative proteomic liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was 
performed by Biognosys AG. Briefly, for each sample a total of 20 ug of protein was 
lyophilized and then denatured with 8M urea, reduced using dithiothreitol, alkylated with 
Biognosys alkylation solution, and digested overnight with trypsin (Promega) as previously 
described.15 Resulting sample peptides were dried using a SpeedVac system and re-
dissolved in 45 uL of Biognosys LC solvent and mixed with Biognosys PlasmaDive 
(extended version 2.0) stable isotope-labeled reference peptide mix containing Biognosys 
iRT kit.
Then 1 ug of total protein was injected to an in-house packed C18 column (75μm inner 
diameter and 10 cm column length, New Objective); column material was Magic AQ, 3 μm 
particle size, 200 Å pore size from Michrom) on a Thermo Scientific Easy nLC nano-liquid 
chromatography system. LC-MRM assays were measured on a Thermo Scientific TSQ 
Vantage triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a standard nano-electrospray 
source. The LC gradient for LC-MRM was 5–35% solvent B (97% acetonitrile in water with 
0.1% FA) in 30 minutes followed by 35–100% solvent B in 2 minutes and 100% solvent B 
for 8 minutes (total gradient length was 40 minutes). For quantification of the peptides 
across samples, the TSQ Vantage was operated in scheduled MRM mode with an acquisition 
window length of 3.25 minutes. The LC eluent was electrosprayed at 1.9 kV and Q1 was 
operated at unit resolution (0.7 Da). Signal processing and data analysis was carried out 
using SpectroDive™ - Biognosys’ proprietary software for multiplexed MRM data analysis. 
A Q-value filter of 1% was applied. Protein concentration was determined based on the 
normalized 1 ug of protein injected to the LC/MS.
Statistical Analysis
To select informative analytes that differentiate SPTB from term deliveries, the processed 
protein quantitation data were first subjected to univariate receiver-operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis.16,17 Bootstrap resampling18 against nulls from sample label 
permutation was used to control the false-discovery rate (FDR).19 Briefly, for each protein, a 
ROC analysis was repeated on bootstrap samples from the original data, the mean and 
standard deviation (SD) of the area-under-curve (AUCs) was estimated. The bootstrap 
procedure was then applied on the same data again but with sample SPTB status labels 
randomly permutated. The permutation analysis provided the null results in order to control

 the FDR and adjust for multiple comparison during the selection of potential protein 
biomarkers. The Differential Dependency Network (DDN) bioinformatic tool was then 
applied in order to extract SPTB phenotype-dependent high-order co-expression patterns 
among the proteins.20 An additional bioinformatic tool, BiNGO, was used to identify gene 
ontology (GO) categories that were overrepresented in the DDN subnetworks in order to 
suggest plausible functional links between the observed proteomic dis-regulations and 
SPTB.21 Finally, to assess the complementary values among the selected proteins and the 
range of their potential clinically relevant performance, multivariate linear models were 
derived and evaluated using bootstrap resampling.
Results
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample set are presented in Table 1. 
Maternal age, race, BMI, use of public insurance, smoking during pregnancy, and 
gestational age at enrollment were similar in both groups. Maternal educational levels were 
higher in the controls and a greater proportion of the SPTB cases were primaparious and had 
a prior history of PTB.
The 132 proteins evaluated via targeted MRM were individually assessed for ability to 
differentiate SPTB from term deliveries. By requiring that the mean bootstrap AUCs for 
each candidate protein be significantly greater than the null (> mean + SD of mean bootstrap 
AUCs estimated with label permutation; see Figure 1) and excluding proteins with large 
bootstrap AUCs variances, 62 of the 132 proteins demonstrated robust power for the 
detection of SPTB. In contrast, using the same criteria with sample label permutation, only 
12 proteins would have been selected. The estimated FDR for protein selection was 
therefore <20% (12/62). These 62 proteins were considered potential candidates for further 
multivariate analysis. Individually, 25 of the 62 proteins had a p-values <0.10 and an AUC > 
0.618 for differentiating SPTB from term controls (Table 2).
Differential dependency network analysis among the 62 selected proteins identified a 
number of SPTB phenotype-associated co-expression patterns (Figure 2). A number of GO 
categories, such as inflammation, wound healing, the coagulation cascade, and steroid 
metabolism were overrepresented among the DDN analysis co-expression subnetworks. 
Table 3 provides a listing of the top discriminating pairwise correlations (p-values < 0.001 – 
0.069). There were a total of 20 unique proteins that formed the DDN subnetworks. Several 
of the pairwise correlations (CBPN-TRFE, CPN2-TRFE, A1AG1-MBL2) were markers for 
inclusion in the term controls rather than the SPTB cases, which suggest a protection against 
SPTB (Table 3).
Based on the available sample size, and in order to avoid overtraining, only linear models 
were evaluated to assess the clinically relevant performance and the variables were limited to 
all possible combinations of 2 or 3 proteins out of the 20 proteins in Table 3 (1330 models). 
Each model was derived and evaluated using 200 bootstrap resampled data in order to 
estimate the median (90%CI) and specificity for ROC AUCs with a fixed sensitivity of 80%. 
The top 20 models in terms of the lower-bound of 90% CI of AUCs and specificities were 
listed in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Given limitations imposed by the sample size, the

 model could not be tested on an independent sample set. To compensate for this the CIs for 
the panel’s performances in the training dataset were estimated through iterative bootstrap 
analysis.
Figure 3 shows the frequency of individual proteins from the DDN analysis being included 
in the top 20 model’s variable panels. The most frequently “included” proteins were HEMO, 
KLKB1, and TRFE. In Figure 4 the ROC curve, AUC, and a pair of sensitivity and 
specificity were plotted for the linear model using a 3 protein panel: HEMO, IC1, and PGRP.
Discussion
Principle findings
This study identifies numerous protein mediators associated with several clinically relevant 
biological processes that exhibit unique expression profiles by 10–12 weeks gestation among 
SPTB cases. The protein biomarkers identified are primarily involved in inter-related 
biological networks linked to coagulation, fibrinolysis, immune modulation and the 
complement system (Table 6). These systems, in turn, are believed to have an interaction 
with adaptive immunity and the mediation of inflammatory processes necessary to sustain a 
successful pregnancy; therefore, we infer that the functioning of these essential processes is 
mediated, in part, by CMP interactions between various cells and tissues. The potential 
biological and clinical significance of this approach is in the non-invasive detection and 
monitoring of protein dysregulation in preterm births and possibly other obstetrical 
syndromes and conditions.
Findings in relation to other studies
During pregnancy, there is a complex and intimate interaction between the fetus and mother 
that includes the direct bathing of the placenta in maternal blood and the incursion of fetal 
tissue into the maternal decidua in order to facilitate the exchange of metabolic substrates 
and waste products. There is extensive cross-talk between the two individuals, though the 
mechanisms are poorly understood. For example, the close contact between maternal and 
fetal tissues presents an immunological challenge to the mother, but immune tolerance is 
sustained throughout a healthy pregnancy.22,23 Cross-talk between maternal and fetal tissues 
must therefore exist.22 CMPs are candidates for communication between maternal and fetal 
sources as these pregnancy-associated microparticles have already been shown to carry 
immunomodulatory and regulatory proteins within the maternal circulation.24
Cell-derived microparticles have been described for numerous cells types and bodily 
fluids.25 Possible cell sources of microparticle-associated proteins described here include 
vascular endothelium, syncytiotrophoblasts, decidua, immune cells, as well as more distant 
systemic sources (see Figure 5). Endothelial-derived microparticles have been described to 
carry numerous adhesion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth molecules.26 Within the context 
of the present study, we have identified microparticle-associated biomarkers that have 
actions within the coagulation, inflammation and immune modulation pathways. Several of 
the top classification models presented include HEMO, KLKB1, A2MG, IC1 and TRFE, 
with the most frequent components being HEMO, KLKB1 and TRFE. Among these, IC1 is

 a protease inhibitor that belongs to the Serpin (serum protease inhibitors) superfamily of 
protease inhibitors. One of its prime functions is the inhibition of spontaneous activation of 
the complement system; deficiencies of this protein activity cause a rare genetic disorder 
called hereditary angioedema.
Several complications, including preterm birth, are associated with aberrant complement 
activation in women with inherited or acquired complement system disorders, while plasma 
and urine biomarker studies implicate complement proteins and abnormal cascade activation 
that lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes.27 Complement Component 9 (CO9), a 
discriminating single analyte ranking in the top 10 proteins with the greatest AUC and 
lowest p-value, is a component of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that plays a key role 
in the innate and adaptive immune responses. CO9 works along with complement 
components C7 and C8 to form pores that insert into target membranes to kill cells. CO7 and 
CO8 alpha chain are two additional proteins that have been discovered in CMPs in our 
studies, and it is interesting that the MAC has been localized to trophoblastic basement 
membranes at sites of villous injury (Figure 5, red arrow.)28 Plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) has 
been described before as part of a proteomic biomarker panel, used in conjunction with IL-6, 
to predict preterm labor in patients with intact membranes.29 The protein participates in 
surface-dependent activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis and is a component of kinin 
generation. As with many of the CMP markers described here, it is consistent with prevalent 
theories about the role of inflammation in preterm births and other adverse outcomes.30 
Hemopexin (HEMO) acts as a scavenger protein for heme groups released from heme-
containg proteins, such as hemoglobin. Free heme groups can generate free radicals and 
induce significant oxidative damage. HEMO, thus, acts as an anti-oxidant while preserving 
the body’s iron stores. Oxidative stress is yet another pathologic factor associated with 
spontaneous preterm births, though it is also considered part of normal term parturition 
mechanisms.31 Taken together, the top protein discriminators in the classifier are consistent 
with known mechanisms of preterm birth and adverse outcomes in pregnancy and 
parturition, but future in vitro and in vivo experiments will be necessary to elucidate their 
role. Trophoblastic-derived microparticles may play a major role in providing a protective 
effect to modulate inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface. Uncontrolled complement 
activation is prevented in normal pregnancies by molecules localized to plasma membranes 
of trophoblasts, while unrestricted complement activation is associated with complications 
of pregnancy and fetal death.32 If validated, the coagulation-related, microparticle proteins 
identified in this study could serve as a nexus for initiating the coagulation cascade, or, as 
suggested by identified negative regulator factors, CMP’s transporting regulatory proteins 
within the maternal-fetal environment may inhibit coagulation and complement proteins (see 
Table 6), thereby also limiting a local inflammatory response.33
It is increasingly understood that immune dysregulation, aberrant coagulation and 
intrauterine inflammation are common to a large proportion of cases of SPTB.7 Considering 
the breadth of microparticle protein markers described here that span coagulation, 
inflammation, and immunomodulatory pathways, while recalling the important role of 
intrauterine inflammation in SPTB,7, 30,34 it is not surprising that we are observing evidence 
of microparticle mediated dysfunction as early as the end of the first trimester. 
Contemporary theory suggests that, if not all, at least a high proportion of adverse pregnancy

 outcomes have their pathophysiologic origins in early pregnancy.7,12,13 Abnormalities of 
early placentation and trophoblast function have been observed not only in pregnancies 
complicated by hypertension, but also in approximately 30% of those experiencing SPTB.35 
Our findings suggest that the state, condition, and function of these cells at the maternal-fetal 
interface during this critical period have already predisposed the pregnancy to adverse 
outcomes. Others have observed that the concentration of placental-specific microparticles 
increases significantly with advancing gestation,36 this suggests that early perturbations in 
microparticle-mediated signaling may gradually become magnified as the pregnancy 
progresses. Ultimately, these anomalies in the maternal fetal cross-talk may become 
sufficiently great enough to cause a ‘network crash’ of the systems that were facilitating 
tolerance resulting in a spontaneous preterm birth.
Clinical and research implications
One of the traditional hindrances to a greater understanding of the underlying causes of 
SPTB is the difficulty of investigating the maternal-fetal interface itself and the unique 
nature of human placentation. The intrauterine space is both physically and ethically remote. 
As such, this is perhaps why, with the possible exception of the measurement of cervical 
length by ultrasound, little recent progress has been made in the development of useful 
biomarkers to stratify patients according to risk of SPTB.37–39 We have demonstrated here a 
potential means to move this area of inquiry forward. Differences in the protein content of 
microparticles likely represent an untapped source of information regarding biology of the 
maternal-fetal interface. We have further demonstrated that improved specificity (as 
indicated by increased AUCs) can be obtained with the simultaneous consideration of 
multiple protein biomarkers associated with a CMP-enriched blood plasma fraction. This is 
not surprising, given the present conceptualization of maternal-fetal tolerance as a 
complicated multivariate network with many inputs rather than a more simple bivariate 
relationship.40 Fears of over-fitting limited the number of markers we could reasonably test, 
although, increased sample size in future studies would allow the testing of more 
simultaneous markers and improve the ability to characterize the overall state of the 
network.
Strengths and limitations
This analysis should be interpreted in the context of the study design. First, it suffers from 
the limitations common to all observational studies, namely that observation cannot discern 
causation. Second, we chose to compare SPTB ≤34 weeks given the increased neonatal 
morbidity in that gestational age range and our belief that the homogeneity of the pathology 
of SPTB in these earlier gestational age ranges are likely to be greater. For these very 
reasons, however, applicability to gestational ages after 34 weeks may not be as clear. 
Finally, we also acknowledge that for reasons of cost, balanced against sample size, we are 
generalizing from a single data set. While we have taken great statistical and methodological 
pains to reduce the risks of false discovery and over-fitting, ideally these findings should be 
replicated in a larger validation cohort set. We are currently undertaking these additional 
investigations to validate this preliminary analysis.

 Conclusions
This study has identified statistically significant CMP associated protein biomarker 
candidates and multiplex panels associated with biological processes relevant to pregnancy 
that are already unique in their expression profiles at 10–12 weeks among women who go on 
to deliver spontaneously at ≤34 weeks. Some may suggest that we are premature in 
attempting the development of a predictive test without a universally agreed upon 
therapeutic modality. However, we contend that we are laying the groundwork for the 
clinical stratification of patients at risk of SPTB well before clinical presentation. Such 
identification would allow the application of increased observation and the possible 
application of prophylactic therapies such as progesterone, which together may significantly 
improve the management of these patients. We acknowledge, however, that additional work 
will need to be done to demonstrate the effectiveness of such therapies in women stratified 
using microparticle-based tests, well before clinical presentation.

 Figure 1. 
Bootstrap ROC analysis to select proteins for detection of SPTBs from term cases. Each 
protein was plotted as a blue-colored point with mean and SD of the AUCs from bootstrap 
ROC analysis as x- and y-axis values, correspondingly. Results from the same analysis yet 
with sample label permutation were plotted as red points. A total of 62 proteins (blue points) 
within the lower right quadrant bounded by the magenta vertical line (mean + SD of x-
values of the red points) and the green horizontal line (mean + SD of y values of the blue 
points) were selected for their relatively stable and significant discriminatory power. In 
comparison, only 12 of proteins from label permutated analysis (red points) were in this 
quadrant. The estimated false discovery rate was therefore < 20% (12/62).

 Figure 2. 
Differential Dependency Network (DDN) analysis on the selected proteins identified co-
expression patterns associated with STPB. In plot, red or green colors of connections 
indicate whether the co-expression between the pairs of proteins were observed among 
STPBs or term cases, respectively, and the thickness is proportional to the statistical 
significance of connection (see Table 3).
