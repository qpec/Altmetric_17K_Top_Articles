Summary
Background In March, 2016, the UK Government proposed a tiered levy on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; high tax 
for drinks with >8 g of sugar per 100 mL, moderate tax for 5–8 g, and no tax for <5 g). We estimate the eff
 ect of 
possible industry responses to the levy on obesity, diabetes, and dental caries.
Methods We modelled three possible industry responses: reformulation to reduce sugar concentration, an increase 
of product price, and a change of the market share of high-sugar, mid-sugar, and low-sugar drinks. For each response, 
we defi
 ned a better-case and worse-case health scenario. We developed a comparative risk assessment model to 
estimate the UK health impact of each scenario on prevalence of obesity and incidence of dental caries and type 2 
diabetes. The model combined data for sales and consumption of SSBs, disease incidence and prevalence, price 
elasticity estimates, and estimates of the association between SSB consumption and disease outcomes. We drew the 
disease association parameters from a meta-analysis of experimental studies (SSBs and weight change), a 
meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies (type 2 diabetes), and a prospective cohort study (dental caries).
Findings The best modelled scenario for health is SSB reformulation, resulting in a reduction of 144 383 (95% uncertainty 
interval 5102–306 743; 0·9%) of 15 470 813 adults and children with obesity in the UK, 19 094 (6920–32 678; incidence 
reduction of 31·1 per 100 000 person-years) fewer incident cases of type 2 diabetes per year, and 269 375 (82 211–470 928; 
incidence reduction of 4·4 per 1000 person-years) fewer decayed, missing, or fi
 lled teeth annually. An increase in the 
price of SSBs in the better-case scenario would result in 81 594 (3588–182 669; 0·5%) fewer adults and children with 
obesity, 10 861 (3899–18 964; 17·7) fewer incident cases of diabetes per year, and 149 378 (45 231–262 013; 2·4) fewer 
decayed, missing, or fi
 lled teeth annually. Changes to market share to increase the proportion of low-sugar drinks sold 
in the better-case scenario would result in 91 042 (4289–204 903; 0·6%) fewer adults and children with diabetes, 
1528 (4414–21 785; 19·7) fewer incident cases of diabetes per year, and 172 718 (47 919–294 499; 2·8) fewer decayed, 
missing, or fi
 lled teeth annually. The greatest benefi
 t for obesity and oral health would be among individuals aged 
younger than 18 years, with people aged older than 65 years having the largest absolute decreases in diabetes incidence.
Interpretation The health impact of the soft drinks levy is dependent on its implementation by industry. Uncertainty 
exists as to how industry will react and about estimation of health outcomes. Health gains could be maximised by 
substantial product reformulation, with additional benefi
 ts possible if the levy is passed on to purchasers through 
raising of the price of high-sugar and mid-sugar drinks and activities to increase the market share of low-sugar products.

Introduction
In 2015, the UK Scientifi
 c Advisory Committee on 
Nutrition published a report1 on the evidence for the 
association between consumption of carbohydrates and 
health. The report clarifi
 ed the role of sugar for 
development of dental caries and identifi
 ed sugar-
sweetened beverages (SSBs) as a specifi
 c risk factor for 
weight gain and type 2 diabetes, recommending that 
SSB consumption should be minimised. Both Public 
Health England2 and the UK House of Parliament’s 
Health Committee3 subsequently advised a tax on SSBs 
and, in March, 2016, the budget statement4 included 
proposals for a soft drinks industry levy.
Taxes on SSBs have been previously introduced in 
Mexico, France, Hungary, and elsewhere;5 however, 
the UK would be the fi
 rst to introduce a three-tiered levy. 
The levy is presented as an incentive for the industry to 
reformulate existing products to remove sugar, reduce 
portion sizes, and promote new or existing low-sugar 
alternatives. The levy is due to be introduced in 2018, 
subject to parliament passing the legislation in 2017, with 
revenue hypothecated for an increase of physical activity 
and breakfast clubs in schools.4
Although the UK Government has expressed a desire 
that the levy is not passed on to purchasers through price 
rises, this request cannot be mandated and the industry 
response is unknown. Other outcomes could include 
reformulation to reduce sugar content or changes in 
marketing to encourage purchasers to switch to low-sugar 
products or small portion sizes. Diff
 erent responses will 
have diff
 erent eff
 ects on consumption patterns for soft 
drinks and hence determine the health eff
 ects of the

levy.6 The aim of this study is to appraise the health eff
 ect 
of various discrete industry responses so that legislation 
for the soft drinks levy can be designed to maximise 
health gain.
Methods
Scenarios
We developed a comparative risk assessment model to 
estimate the eff
 ects of SSB reformulation, price changes, 
and changes to SSB market share on obesity, dental 
caries, and type 2 diabetes in the UK (fi
 gure). The 
baseline for the model was the 2014 UK population and 
we took all data for the model from the closest year for 
which data were freely available (appendix). We identifi
 ed 
and modelled three possible industry responses. First, 
reformulation to reduce sugar concentration; second, a 
rise in price; and third, activities to change the relative 
market share of high-sugar, mid-sugar, and low-sugar 
drinks. For each of these responses, the magnitude 
of the response is uncertain. Informed by evidence 
where available and expert opinion, for each response 
we identifi
 ed better-case and worse-case scenarios 
for reduction of sugar consumption, resulting in 
six scenarios (table 1).
We adopt the government defi
 nitions of high-sugar 
drinks as those with more than 8 g of sugar per 100 mL, 
mid-sugar drinks as those with 5–8 g of sugar per 100 mL, 
and low-sugar drinks as those with less than 5 g of sugar 
per 100 mL. Soft drinks are defi
 ned as all drinks with 
added sugar or sweetener; SSBs are drinks with added 
sugar, excluding milk-based drinks, tea, and coff
 ee; 
concentrated SSBs are defi
 ned as SSBs that are intended 
to be diluted with water, and regular SSBs are intended to 
be drunk as sold.
Small producers will be excluded from the levy.4 We 
searched all soft drinks sold through the Tesco website 
 
and extracted the names of manufacturers. We used the 
Companies House website to identify manufacturers 
fulfi
 lling the UK Government defi
 nition of a small 
company9 and identifi
 ed 13 small companies, which 
together contributed 0·6% of total UK SSB sales. 
Therefore, we did not adjust our analyses to account for 
these companies.
The better-case reformulation scenario (scenario 1) 
assumed that industry would reduce the sugar con-
centration of high-sugar drinks by 30% and mid-sugar 
drinks by 15%. This assumption is based on the 
reformulation of Sprite and Lipton Ice Tea, which have 
both reduced their sugar concentration by 30% 
since 2013.10,11 In the worse-case scenario (scenario 2), we 
assumed a 5% reduction in sugar concentration of both 
high-sugar and mid-sugar drinks. This assumption was 
based on Coca-Cola’s pledge made to the Public Health 
Responsibility Deal of a 5% reduction in calories across 
their sparkling drink range between 2012 and 2014; they 
achieved a 5·3% reduction.11 Under both these scenarios, 
the volume consumed is assumed to remain constant.
To derive the price change scenarios, we used estimates 
from the Offi
  ce for Budget Responsibility that the levy will 
be 18 pence per L on mid-sugar drinks and 24 pence per L 
on high-sugar drinks.12 Low-sugar drinks will not be taxed. 
Previous sugary drink taxes have been passed on at rates 
of between 50% and 100%,13–15 and if the tax was entirely 
passed through to consumers, high-sugar concentrated 
drinks would, on average, increase in price by 75% and 
high-sugar regular drinks would increase by 31% (table 2). 
Such price rises are markedly greater than in other 
examples of SSB taxes (most countries have adopted 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The UK Government announced a soft drinks industry levy in 
March, 2016. Multiple observational and modelling studies 
have analysed the eff
 ect of soft drink taxes in other 
international settings; however, the UK would be fi
 rst to 
introduce a tiered industry levy (high tax for drinks with >8 g of 
sugar per 100 mL, moderate tax for 5–8 g, and no tax for <5 g) 
rather than a sales tax, as has been applied elsewhere. To our 
knowledge, no analyses of its potential impact have been done 
and no international precedent exists from which to predict the 
potential response of soft drink manufacturers to the levy.
Added value of this study
This study, to our knowledge, is the fi
 rst to estimate the health 
impact of the UK soft drinks industry levy. It focuses on obesity, 
diabetes, and oral health, for which evidence of a causal link 
between soft drink consumption and health is strongest. 
Previous evidence has suggested that soft drink taxes lead to 
price rises and subsequent reductions in purchases of targeted 
drinks. This study goes further and estimates the eff
 ects of 
six scenarios to illustrate the relative health impacts of 
three possible industry responses to the levy: reformulation, 
price rises, and changes to product market share.
Implications of all the available evidence
Each of the three responses modelled could lead to important 
health gains, with industry likely to react to the levy using a 
combination of all three. This study extends previous analyses 
of the eff
 ect of soft drink taxes to show the benefi
 ts of 
reformulation stimulated by the tiered levy. Our analyses show 
that substantial health benefi
 ts could occur if the levy 
stimulates reformulation. Further important health benefi
 ts 
from price changes will be mitigated if industry spread the price 
increase across their entire portfolio. Increases in market share 
for mid-sugar and low-sugar drinks could have substantial 
health benefi
 ts, but only if the market share comes at the 
expense of high-sugar drinks rather than people shifting from 
low-sugar to mid-sugar drinks.

smaller tax rates and therefore, despite high pass-on rates, 
only result in a 5–15% price rise)17 and are larger than 
the 20% often cited as being necessary to aff
 ect substantial 
behavioural change and improve health.18
We therefore assumed that 50% of the price increase 
would be passed on to purchasers and that companies 
would not increase prices by more than 20% (table 2). 
The better case for price change (scenario 3) assumed 
that the tax is passed on only through SSBs. However, 
major soft drink manufacturers produce various 
beverages. Therefore, in a worse case for price change 
(scenario 4), we assume that the levy is passed on evenly 
across all soft drinks (both diet beverages and SSBs), 
fruit juice, and bottled water, resulting in a 6% price rise. 
We modelled passing on 100% of the price increase to 
consumers as a sensitivity analysis. As stated by the UK 
Government, we applied tax rates to concentrated drinks 
given their price per litre as drunk, assuming a ratio of 
concentrate to water of one to four, as used by the British 
Soft Drinks Association (BSDA).10,19 The appendix gives 
details of how we modelled the price change.
A change in SSB market shares might result from 
changes in product marketing, changing product size, 
or the introduction of new mid-sugar and low-sugar 
products. For example, the BSDA reports a 70% increase 
in expenditure on advertising of low-calorie or 
zero-calorie brands and growth in the sales of small 
pack sizes,10 and new mid-sugar products have emerged, 
such as Coca-Cola Life, which has 30% less sugar than 
does full-sugar Coca-Cola.20 Few data exist to inform the 
extent to which these activities drive changes in 
purchasing behaviour. However, the soft drinks industry 
has pledged to reduce energy intake from soft drinks by 
20% from 2015 levels by 2020.10 To achieve this target, 
we calculate that the market share of high-sugar drinks 
would need to fall by 12% alongside a 6% increase for 
each of mid-sugar and low-sugar drinks, as shown in 
scenario 5, our better case for sugar reduction. The 
worse case (scenario 6) acknowledges that increased 
marketing of new mid-sugar drinks might lead 
consumers to switch to this category from low-sugar 
drinks. We assume that mid-sugar drinks double their 
market share alongside equal reductions in the market 
share of high-sugar and low-sugar drinks.
Health impact modelling
We developed a comparative risk assessment model to 
estimate the eff
 ect of the changes to SSB purchasing on 
incidence of dental caries and type 2 diabetes and 
prevalence of obesity. Comparative risk assessment 
modelling requires identifi
 cation of risk factor-disease 
pairs. In this case, the risk factor is SSB consumption 
and the diseases are dental caries, type 2 diabetes, and 
obesity. A two-step process then estimates the impact of 
the risk factor on the diseases. First, changes in the 
risk factor between baseline (current behaviour) and 
scenarios are estimated. Second, changes in the diseases 
as a result of changes in the risk factor are calculated 
using population impact fractions and applied to baseline 
levels of disease in the population. Such methods are 
common to the fi
 eld of comparative risk assessment 
modelling21 and are based on model parameters 
representing baseline risk factor and disease status and 
the epidemiological relations between risk factors and 
diseases, which are assumed to be causal.

We sought parameters describing the direct relation 
between SSB consumption and health outcomes where 
possible from meta-analyses of randomised controlled 
trials where available or cohort studies (table 3).22–28 We 
modelled the relation between SSB consumption and 
diabetes and bodyweight as a function of SSB con-
sumption. The reformulation scenarios (scenarios 1 
and 2) assumed that SSB consumption stays constant, 
but the amount of sugar in the drinks reduces. To 
estimate the eff
 ect of these scenarios on obesity and 
diabetes, we derived estimates of equivalised SSB 
consumption, which rises and falls in direct proportion 
to volume of SSB consumed and average SSB sugar 
concentration. We standardised against the average 
sugar concentrations in drinks in the baseline scenario. 
For example, in the baseline scenario, the average sugar 
concentration of SSBs was 9·2 g per 100 mL and the 
average consumption was 213 mL per day. A reduction in 
the average sugar concentration to 8·2 g per 100 mL at 
the same level of consumption would have an equivalised 
SSB consumption of 190 mL per day. This equivalised 
SSB consumption arises because a reduction in 
consumption of SSBs from 213 mL per day to 190 mL per 
day at constant sugar concentrations would result in 
the same reduction of sugar as a reduction of sugar 
concentration from 9·2 g per 100 mL to 8·2 g per 100 mL 
at the same level of consumption. We used equivalised 
SSB con 
sumption as an input for diabetes and obesity 
modelling in all scenarios.
Uncertainty intervals refl
 ect the uncertainty in baseline 
sugar drink sales and consumption, disease burden, 
sensitivity to price changes, and associations between 
sugar or sugary drink consumption and health outcomes. 
We estimated them using 5000 iterations of a Monte Carlo 
analysis, with model parameters drawn from the published 
or estimated uncertainty of each parameter (appendix).
We applied all results to the 2014 UK population29 and 
made separate estimates for each outcome by sex and age 
group using age-specifi
 c and sex-specifi
 c estimates of 
baseline SSB consumption and disease burden. Further 
details of the health impact model are in the appendix, 
including a sensitivity analysis in which the direct eff
 ect 
on weight of SSB consumption is replaced with an 
energy balance equation for comparison with other work 
that has used this method.30

Results
The better case for reformulation (scenario 1) resulted 
in a fall in mean sugar content of SSBs equivalent to 
a reduction of 58·5 mL (95% uncertainty interval 
[95% UI 54·5–62·6; 10 kcal [9–10]) of SSBs per person 
per day (table 4). This reduction is the largest among

scenarios modelled. All simulated scenarios led to a 
fall in equivalised SSB consumption except for the 
worse case for market share, which resulted in a small 
increase. The largest falls for both sexes were among 
11–18-year-olds who consume the largest volume 
of SSBs.
The reduction in obesity prevalence resulting from 
each scenario is estimated to be greatest after scenario 1 
(better case for reformulation; table 5), leading to 
an estimated reduction of 144 383 (95% UI 5102–306 743) 
of 15 470 813 individuals with obesity, 0·9% of the obese 
population. This fi
 gure is compared with the better cases 
for price change (scenario 3), which reduces the obese 
population by 81 594 (3588–182 669; 0·5%), and with 
change in market share (scenario 5), which reduces the 
obese population by 91 042 (4289–204 903; 0·6%). Results 
varied by age, with larger reductions in the number of 
children with obesity than in that of adults in scenario 1. 
The relative reduction in obesity prevalence was 
predicted to be greater in male individuals than in 
female individuals because male individuals consume a 
greater volume of SSBs (appendix). Eff
 ect size estimates 
were signifi
 cantly increased when an energy balance 
equation was used (appendix).
Across the scenarios modelled, the pattern of results 
seen with obesity is repeated for type 2 diabetes. 
Scenario 1 (better case for reformulation) resulted in an 
estimated 19 094 (95% UI 6920–32 678; incidence 
reduction of 31·1 per 100 000 person-years) fewer new 
cases of diabetes per year and scenario 6 (worse case 
for change in market share) led to an increase of 
1238 (455–2359; incidence increase of 2·0 per 
100 000 person-years) cases per year (table 6). However, 
by contrast with the obesity results, adults aged older 
than 65 years saw the largest absolute reduction in 
diabetes incidence, refl
 ecting the positive association 
between age and disease burden.
All scenarios except for scenario 6 led to a fall in the 
numbers of teeth aff
 ected with dental caries (measured by 
the number of decayed, missing, or fi
 lled teeth [DMFT]; 
table 7). The better case for reformulation (scenario 1) had 
the largest eff
 ect size, reducing the annual incidence of 
DMFT by 269 375 (95% UI 82 211–470 928; incidence 
reduction of 4·4 per 1000 person-years). As with results 
for obesity and diabetes, the better case for change in 
market share (scenario 5) and price change (scenario 3) 
scenarios had the next largest eff
 ects respectively. Those 
aged 11–18 years were expected to have the greatest relative 
benefi
 t because of their higher baseline SSB consumption 
than those aged older or younger than this age group 
(appendix).
In our sensitivity analysis where 100% of the levy is 
passed on to consumers, equivalised SSB consumption 
would reduce by 71 mL (95% UI 66–77; 11 kcal [10–12]) 
per person per day. This reduction would lead to 174 818 
(7536–367 647) fewer individuals with obesity, 23 046 
(8419–39 965) fewer cases of diabetes per year, and 
324 488 (89 073–553 840) fewer DMFT per year.
Discussion
The proposed UK soft drinks industry levy has the 
potential to reduce obesity prevalence, diabetes incidence, 
and dental caries incidence. The eff
 ect on health and the 
ranking of scenarios is sensitive to the manner in which 
industry responds to the levy and the uncertainty in the 
modelling. Our estimates suggest that the greatest 
benefi
 ts will result from reformulation, with less but still 
positive health eff
 ects after price changes and changes to 
SSB market share to increase the proportion of low-sugar 
drinks sold, although in the worse-case scenario for 
change in market share, the health eff
 ect was actually 
negative. Children will have the greatest relative health 
benefi
 t in terms of obesity and caries, with absolute 
reductions in diabetes incidence rates increasing with age.

The main strength of this study is the timely assessment 
of a planned government policy by simulating a set of 
discrete scenarios for how industry might respond to the 
levy to inform the detail of the legislation. Other strengths 
include modelling of multiple health outcomes, use of 
age-specifi
 c and sex-specifi
 c data, use of own-price and 
cross-price elasticities for high-sugar, mid-sugar, and 
low-sugar drinks, and use of equivalised SSB consumption 
to allow for changes in both sugar content and SSB volume.
Uncertainty intervals estimate the uncertainty arising 
from model parameters; however, the greatest uncertainty 
is how the soft drinks industry will respond to the levy. 
Given this uncertainty, our results should not be read as 
precise estimates of the impact of the levy, but instead 
should be used to compare the relative eff
 ects of diff
 erent 
scenarios. Moreover, industry is likely to respond 
with a blended approach that combines elements of 
reformulation, price changes, and marketing. Although 
the results have wide and overlapping uncertainty intervals, 
much of the uncertainty is correlated between scenarios. 
In all of the iterations of our Monte Carlo analysis, the 
best-case reformulation scenario was associated with the 
best health outcomes, which suggests that the ranking of 
scenarios is robust. We have not estimated uncertainty in 
how much of the levy is passed on to consumers (although 
a 100% pass-on is modelled as a sensitivity analysis) and 
we did not use child-specifi
 c estimates of the eff
 ect of SSB 
consumption on diabetes and dental caries incidence 
because of an absence of data available. We have assumed 
that disease risk from SSBs is dependent on the quantity 
of sugar consumed (more sugar leads to higher risk).

from a swap from SSBs to artifi
 cially sweetened beverages, 
we are not aware of any studies that have described the 
eff
 ect of a swap of SSBs with a high sugar content to SSBs 
with a low sugar content.
We have not modelled a temporal component. The 
eff
 ects on DMFT could occur soon after the change in SSB 
consumption, and the trials22–25 used to parameterise the 
relation between SSB consumption and weight suggest 
that falls in obesity would be expected within 6 months for 
adults and 12 months for children. The eff
 ects on type 2 
diabetes could take longer to be realised than for obesity 
(median follow-up of observational studies26 used for this 
parameter ranged between 3·4 years and 21·1 years). We 
have also not modelled results for diff
 erent subgroups. 
Individuals from diff
 erent socioeconomic backgrounds, 
ages, and baseline consumption levels could respond 
diff
 erently to each industry response simulated. Finally, 
we have not modelled the long-term health benefi
 ts of 
falls in obesity, the possible educational role the levy might 
have in highlighting that SSBs cause disease,31 and the 
health eff
 ect of use of the revenue to improve school sport 
and nutrition.
This study is, to our knowledge, the fi
 rst to appraise the 
potential health eff
 ects of the UK soft drinks industry 
levy. The results of our study vary from those of a report 
by Oxford Economics,32 which calculated the impact of a 
price change associated with a 100% pass-on of the levy to 
targeted products only, with no reformulation or market 
share (most similar to our scenario 3). The authors 
estimated that the levy would result in a 5 kcal per-person 
per-day fall in energy intake. Our sensitivity analysis of a 
100% pass-on rate would result in a reduction of 11 kcal 
per person per day (before adjustment for BSDA sales 
fi
 gures). Two principal explanations exist for the 
diff
 erence. First, we estimate the average price before tax 
of dilutables as 22 pence per L, whereas Oxford Economics 
estimate it as £1·76 per L. This discrepancy is likely to be 
due to Oxford Economics applying the tax before dilution. 
Second, Oxford Economics used estimates of how 
consumers respond to price changes of diet and non-diet 
SSBs taken from our 2013 study estimating the eff
 ect on 
obesity of a 20% UK SSB tax.30 In our present study, we 
have calculated estimates separately for high-sugar, 
mid-sugar, and low-sugar drinks.
Our 2013 study30 estimated that a 20% price rise would 
lead to a 1·3% fall in the number of adults with obesity in 
the UK, compared with our scenario 3 estimate of 0·5% 
(after an average price rise of 15%). Our 2013 study did not 
estimate price elasticities separately for high-sugar and 
mid-sugar drinks, did not quantify the eff
 ect of the tax on 
children, and did not adjust for BSDA sales fi
 gures. It also 
used an energy balance equation rather than quantifying 
the direct eff
 ect of SSBs on bodyweight, which estimates 
larger eff
 ects on bodyweight than does quantifying the 
direct eff
 ect of SSBs on bodyweight. Conversely, in this 
study, we used an estimate of the direct relation between 
bodyweight and SSBs, which might more accurately 
represent substitution and other compensatory mech-
anisms secondary to changes in sugar (and energy) 
consumed from SSBs than use of an energy balance 
equation. This analysis substantiates our 2013 fi
 ndings of 
greater relative reductions in obesity among younger 
adults than among older adults. This fi
 nding is explained 
by teenagers and young adults drinking more SSBs than 
do old adults and trial data suggesting that SSBs have a 
greater eff
 ect on weight gain in children than in adults.23–26
Considering reformulation, Ma and colleagues33 esti-
mated that a 40% reduction in sugar across all SSBs in the 
UK would lead to 800 000 fewer individuals with obesity. 
This estimate is substantially higher than our estimate in 
scenario 1 (about 144 400), which assumed a 30% reduction 
in sugar content of high-sugar drinks and 15% reduction 
in that of mid-sugar drinks. This discrepancy is, in part, 
due to Ma and colleagues estimating that the average 
reduction in energy consumed would be approximately 
twice our estimate and then using an energy balance 
equation to estimate the eff
 ect of energy intake on weight. 
Of note, estimates for the reduction in diabetes were 
similar between our study and Ma and colleagues’ study. 
We also recognise that uncertainties exist around all 
parameters in the model that will aff
 ect the comparison of 
results with those from other simulation studies.
The UK soft drinks industry levy has the potential to 
lead to important improvements in population health, 
particularly among children. Policy makers should engage 
with stakeholders to encourage responses to the levy that 
will maximise the potential health benefi
 ts of the new 
policy. Our results show the need for ongoing monitoring 
of the implementation strategies adopted by industry 
alongside modelling to estimate the long-term health 
consequences of their actions. Our results suggest that, of 
the scenarios modelled, reformulation would lead to the 
largest health benefi
 ts. Price rises and changes to product 
market share might also lead to important improvements 
in health. However, eff
 ects would be attenuated if 
manufacturers chose to pass the tax on to purchasers 
across all drinks or other products in their portfolio rather 
than just those targeted by the levy. Moreover, negative 
health eff
 ects might arise if the increase in market share 
of mid-sugar drinks comes at the expense of low-sugar 
drinks. Conversely, further health benefi
 ts might be 
realised if manufacturers pass on more than 50% of the 
levy to consumers or choose to reformulate to a greater 
extent than that modelled (as announced by Tesco34 and 
Lucozade Ribena Suntory35).
The UK soft drinks industry levy could have valuable 
population health benefi
 ts, but the magnitude of its 
health impact will depend on how industry responds. 
The detail of the levy is yet to be decided, but we show 
important health benefi
 ts that could be maximised by 
substantial product reformulation, with further health 
gains arising through raising the price of high-sugar and 
mid-sugar drinks and increasing the market share of 
low-sugar products.
