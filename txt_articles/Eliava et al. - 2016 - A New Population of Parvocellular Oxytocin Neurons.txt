SUMMARY
Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide elaborated by the
hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic
(SON) nuclei. Magnocellular OT neurons of these
nuclei innervate numerous forebrain regions and
release OT into the blood from the posterior pitui-
tary. The PVN also harbors parvocellular OT cells
that project to the brainstem and spinal cord, but
their function has not been directly assessed.
Here, we identified a subset of approximately 30
parvocellular OT neurons, with collateral projections
onto magnocellular OT neurons and neurons of
deep layers of the spinal cord. Evoked OT release
from these OT neurons suppresses nociception
and promotes analgesia in an animal model of in-
flammatory pain. Our findings identify a new popu-
lation of OT neurons that modulates nociception in
a two tier process: (1) directly by release of OT
from axons onto sensory spinal cord neurons and
inhibiting their activity and (2) indirectly by stimu-
lating OT release from SON neurons into the peri-
phery.
INTRODUCTION
Oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide that plays an important role
in sociability, is produced in the brain exclusively in the
hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), and
intermediate accessory nuclei (Swanson and Sawchenko,
1983).
OT
neurons
can
be
classified
in
magnocellular
OT
(magnOT)
and
parvocellular
OT
(parvOT)
neurons,
which are distinct in size and shape, subnuclear location,
the amount of OT production, and involvement in distinct cir-
cuitries and functions (Armstrong et al., 1980; Swanson and
Kuypers, 1980; Sofroniew, 1983; Swanson and Sawchenko,
1983).
According to a long-held dogma, magnOT neurons provide
systemic OT supply by release into the blood via the posterior pi-
tuitary (Scharrer, 1928; Scharrer and Scharrer, 1940, Bargmann
and Scharrer, 1951). Simultaneously, magnOT neurons inner-
vate the forebrain, including the nucleus accumbens (Ross
et al., 2009; Knobloch et al., 2012; Do
¨ len et al., 2013) and the
central nucleus of the amygdala (Knobloch et al., 2012). The fore-
brain fibers, as exemplarily studied in the central amygdala,
allow for focal release and discrete, modulatory action of OT
(Knobloch et al., 2012). These characteristics might account
for the distinct impact of OT on numerous types of brain-region
specific behaviors (Lee et al., 2010).

 In contrast to magnOT neurons, parvOT neurons project to
distinct brainstem nuclei and different regions of the spinal
cord (SC) (Swanson and Sawchenko, 1983; Sawchenko and
Swanson, 1982). Based on the location of parvOT axons and
the effects of externally applied OT, it has been proposed that
OT from parvOT axonal terminals contributes to modulation of
cardiovascular functions, breathing, feeding behavior, and noci-
ception (Mack et al., 2002; Petersson, 2002; Conde
´ s-Lara et al.,
2003; Atasoy et al., 2012). However, no selective and specific
genetic access to parvOT neurons has been available and,
hence, there was no evidence for the capacity of parvOT axons
to release endogenous OT and to selectively modulate the
above-mentioned functions. Moreover, it has remained un-
known how parvOT neurons are incorporated into the entire
OT system and functionally interact with magnOT neurons.
Based on recent reports that OT-modulated nociception and
pain response comprise a peripheral (Juif and Poisbeau, 2013)
and a central component (Juif et al., 2013; Gonza
´ lez-Herna
´ ndez
et al., 2014), it is tempting to propose that these components are
dependent on different OT cell types. The central component re-
sults from parvOT innervation of SC targets (Swanson and
McKellar, 1979), whereas peripherally acting OT, in contrast, is
provided to the blood stream by magnOT neurons and presum-
ably targets C-type fibers in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG; Juif
and Poisbeau, 2013). We therefore hypothesized that the com-
plementary, analgesic OT action—at central and peripheral
levels—depends on the communication between magnOT and
parvOT neurons residing in spatially segregated OT nuclei. Our
present results reveal that the modulation of pain signals by OT
is triggered by only a handful of parvOT neurons that innervate
simultaneously ‘‘sensory wide dynamic range’’ (WDR) neurons
in the deep laminae of the SC, expressing neurokinin-1 (NK1R)
and OT receptors (OTR), and SON neurons that secrete OT in
the periphery. We show that these separate innervations underlie
a two-tier modulation of pain by OT reaching the SC through fast,
direct neuronal projections and a slower, indirect peripheral
pathway.
RESULTS
Intrahypothalamic Axonal Trees of the OT System
To examine the intrahypothalamic OT system, we used recombi-
nant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), allowing cell-type specific
fluorescent labeling of OT neurons with 98%–100% cell-type
specificity, as reported in Knobloch et al. (2012). To compare
the OT system with the vasopressin (VP) system, we used AAV
carrying different fluorescent markers driven by an evolutionarily
conserved
VP
promoter
(for
specificity,
see
Table
S1;
Figure S1A).
After injection of rAAV expressing Venus, under the control of
an OT promoter (Figure 1A), we observed that OT neurons of the
PVN give rise to fibers connecting to the ipsi- and even contralat-
eral SON and form a pronounced plexus (Figures 1A4 and 1A5).
Interconnections within the intrahypothalamic VP system, in
contrast, were absent (Figure S1C). The OT plexus might stem
from PVN OT neurons projecting above the third ventricle to
the contralateral PVN (Figure 1A3). OT connectivity from the
PVN to SON was present in females and males (Figure S2A).
The connection between the OT nuclei was one-way: the SON-
arising OT fibers reached only marginally the ipsi- (Figure 1A9)
and
never
the
contralateral
SON
(Figure
1A7)
or
PVN
(Figure 1A8).
The OT PVN-SON connection was reconstructed using light
sheet microscopy. As presented in Figure S2B, descending fi-
bers from the PVN mainly project rostro-ventrally, turn horizon-
tally at the level of the SON, and enter the SON from the rostral
position, to run caudally along the whole extent of the nucleus.
PVN OT Neurons Innervate the SON and Control MagnOT
Neuron Activity to Induce OT Release into Blood
Circulation
At the light microscopic level, Venus-labeled OT axons that
arose from the PVN formed tight appositions to dendrites and
somata of magnOT SON neurons resembling synaptic contacts.
To assess if synapses were present, we injected the PVN with
rAAV that expresses the synaptic marker synaptophysin fused
to the green fluorescent marker EGFP in PVN OT neurons (Fig-
ure 1B1). GFP-positive puncta were found in the SON. The
vast majority of terminals with GFP signal overlapped with
VGluT2 signal (red, Figure 1B2). GFP/VGluT2 terminals engulfed
OT cell bodies and dendrites (blue, Figure 1B2). We found that
EGFP signals overlapped with VGluT2 in 92.6% ± 8.3% of all ter-
minals (Figure 1B2). These light microscopic observations sug-
gested the presence of synaptic contacts, which we further
confirmed at the electron microscopic level: EGFP-positive OT
axons from the PVN (EGFP: greyish filling) formed asymmetric
(presumably glutamatergic) synapses on OT dendrites of the
SON (OT: dark aggregate in pre- and postsynaptic elements;
Figures 1C1 and 1C2).
Based on the anatomical evidence for OT connections be-
tween PVN and SON neurons, we aimed for a functional charac-
terization of these connections. We expressed the blue-light
(C–C2) Electron microscopy OT axon terminals (Venus visualized as diaminobenzidine [DAB] endproduct, OT, as a silver-gold-intensified DAB) form asymmetric
synapses on OT-ir dendrite within the SON. The OT-immunoreactivity (clusters of silver particles, arrows) are shown in the presynaptic axon (a) terminal and
postsynaptic dendrite (d) at lower (C1) and higher magnifications (C2). The scale bar represents 0.5 mm.

 (BL)-sensitive ChR2 protein (Nagel et al., 2003) fused to mCherry
in PVN OT neurons (for construct validation, see Knobloch et al.,
2012). In vivo extracellular recordings in anaesthetized animals
revealed the expression of functional ChR2 in the PVN, as
evident from BL-induced (PVN-BL, 20 s at 30 Hz with 10 ms
pulses), reversible, and reproducible increases of spike fre-
quencies in these PVN neurons (on average the frequency
increased from 4.1 ± 0.7 to 7.8 ± 0.7 Hz; data not shown).
We then further tested in vivo whether exposure to BL of PVN-
OT axons in the SON (SON-BL, scheme in Figure 1D) could also
activate, ipsilaterally, SON neurons. SON-BL exposure evoked a
reversible increase in spike frequencies of SON neurons, from
6.7 ± 1.5 to 14.1 ± 2.7 Hz, confirming that BL stimulation of
parvOT PVN axon terminals could excite SON neurons (Fig-
ure 1D1). To verify that OT was the main transmitter involved,
we recorded the response of a single neuron to the SON-BL in
the absence of any drug, or after sequential infusion of AMPA
and OTR antagonists (respectively, NBQX and dOVT) into the
SON, and after their washout (Figures 1D2 and 1D3). Interest-
ingly, while NBQX decreased the baseline frequency of SON
neurons, SON-BL paired to NBQX application still efficiently
increased the relative frequency of discharge of the recorded
neuron. Subsequent dOVT infusion totally blocked the SON-BL
response, with full recovery 30 min after washout (Figures 1D2
and 1D3). These results are in accordance with our previous ob-
servations in the central amygdala (Knobloch et al., 2012).
We aimed at providing functional evidence for the OT nature
of the SON neurons that were contacted by the PVN. To this
purpose, we first of all injected into the blood circulation chole-
cystokinin (CCK) a hormone inducing the activation of OT neu-
rons (Verbalis et al., 1986). CCK induced a prominent increase
in spike frequencies of SON-BL responding neurons from 3.6 ±
0.8 to 15.0 ± 5.9 Hz (Figure 1D1), establishing an indirect argu-
ment of the OT identity of the in vivo recorded SON neuron.
Second, as magnOT neurons are known to release OT in the
blood, we performed a time-dependent measurement of OT
concentrations in plasma by mass-spectrometry after SON-
BL. This revealed a significant increase of OT plasma concen-
trations at 60 s after SON-BL (from 0.84 ± 0.17 to 1.76 ± 0.22
pmol/ml; Figure 1E). Taken together, these findings provide
evidence for an OT identity of the SON neurons that are
activated by axonal terminals originating from OT neurons in
the PVN.
OT Neurons Projecting to SON MagnOT Neurons Are
ParvOT Neurons Displaying Distinct Anatomical and
Electrophysiological Characteristics
To identify PVN neurons projecting to the SON, we injected into
the SON retrogradely transported and monosynaptically trans-
mitted canine adenovirus 2 (CAV2). After counting of sections
containing the entire PVN, we identified in total a very small pop-
ulation of GFP/OT-positive neurons residing bilaterally (Table S2;
31.5 ± 8.5 neurons). CAV spread occurs within 200 mm of the in-
jection site (Schwarz et al., 2015), making unlikely the diffusion of
the virus from the SON to PVN (the distance between these two
nuclei is about 1.5 mm; see Paxinos and Watson, 1998).
To characterize the magno- versus parvocellular nature of
back-labeled PVN cells, we combined CAV2 with systemic
administration of Fluorogold (Figure S3A). Fluorogold, when in-
jected intraperitoneal (i.p.), is taken up by neurons projecting
beyond the blood brain barrier, for example, by magnOT neu-
rons, thus allowing to distinguish them from the parvOT (Fluoro-
gold-negative) neurons (Luther et al., 2002; Table S2). Notably,
all magnOT neurons of the SON were Fluorogold-positive (data
not shown). After neuron counting in sections containing the
entire PVN, we established that the vast majority of the 31.5 ±
8.5 GFP/OT-positive neurons (90%) did not contain Fluorogold
(Table S2). In addition to the detection of back-labeled GFP-pos-
itive neurons in the PVN, we observed GFP neurons in other
structures typically known to innervate the SON, further con-
firming the specificity of our retrograde labeling (Miselis, 1981;
Cunningham and Sawchenko, 1988; Figure S3B).
To characterize the parvOT neurons projecting to the SON, we
next injected into the SON CAV2 expressing Cre recombinase
and into the PVN rAAV carrying a double-floxed inverted open
reading frame (ORF) (DIO) of GFP under the control of the OT
promoter (Figure 2A1). By this combination, we limited GFP
expression exclusively to SON-projecting parvOT neurons. In
line with previous results, this revealed a unique position of
back-labeled GFP neurons in the dorso-caudal PVN (Figures
2A2, 2A3, S2B, and S2C). Individual GFP neurons have bipolar
spindle-like morphology (Figure 2A4) distinct from neighboring
magnOT neurons (Figure 2A5). The number of back-labeled
PVN GFP (exclusively OT) neurons was comparable (33.4 ±
9.1), with the estimation of non-selectively labeled PVN neurons
identified by costaining with OT antibodies.
OT neurons similar in morphology and location were obtained
in our initial study (data not shown) with the application of latex
retrobeads (Katz and Iarovici, 1990) in the SON, which, however,
labeled only few cells in the PVN (and other structures inner-
vating the SON; Figure S3), precluding quantitative analysis.
We determined the electrophysiological characteristics of flu-
orescently labeled neurons in the PVN to assess their parvocel-
lular nature. We conducted whole-cell patch clamp recordings in
slices (Figure 2B) in current clamp applying a protocol of depola-
rizing current injections (Figure 2B1). This was aimed to deter-
mine the presence of a transient outward rectification, which is
typically found in magnOT, but not in parvOT neurons (Luther
et al., 2002). We recorded in a total of seven animals 11 fluo-
rescent putative parvOT, and found that none, as expected,
exhibited a hyperpolarizing notch. Conversely, all of the 13
non-fluorescent neurons from the same region (putative mag-
nOT) showed the typical transient outward rectifying current,
as known as (aka) ‘‘notch’’. Quantification of these differences
was made by analyzing the time to spike (spike delay) and rise
slope, which was the slope measured between beginning of
the depolarization and the peak time of the first action potential.
Both of these parameters showed highly significant differences
between the two groups of neurons (Table S4; Figure S4). Differ-
ences in the spike frequency also showed a tendency, though
with less significance than previously reported (Luther et al.,
2000). The electrophysiological responses were in agreement
with the morphology of the cells. Neurons classified electrophys-
iologically as parvOT had a small soma and a more elongated
shape, while the ones classified as magnOT had a big soma
and were more rounded (Figure 2B2).

The above established exclusive labeling of parvOT neurons and

us to follow projections of this OT cell population up to the distal
(L5) segments of the SC. After labeling presumably all PVN OT
neurons, axons can be visualized in both superficial and deep

had been raised in the same species), we
found in this same region cells that ex-
pressed OTR (Figure 3A3). The specificity
of the antibody was confirmed in transfected HEK cells
(Figure S5B1) and brainstem sections of OTR knockout mice
(Figure S5B2), in agreement with a previous study using these
antibodies in mouse cortex (Marlin et al., 2015). To show the co-
localization of NK1R and OTR in the same cells, we performed
fluorescent in situ hybridization and found the presence of
respective mRNAs in the same neurons of deep layers of the
SC (Figures 3B1–3B4). As a next step, we wanted to demon-
strate that NK1R-positive neurons of deep SC laminae could

 be activated by sensory/pain stimulation. Bilateral injection of
capsaicin in the hindpaws indeed induced c-Fos expression in
large NK1R neurons (Figures 3C1–3C3). Furthermore, back-
labeled parvOT neurons were also activated by capsaicin (data
not shown).
To show that NK1R WDR neurons are functionally modulated
by both NK1R specific agonist (SarMet-SP) and parvOT-
deriving OT, we measured in vivo the WDR C-fiber evoked
spikes in response to a series of isolated hindpaw stimulations.
We found that the C-fiber evoked spikes were increased in the
presence of SarMet-SP, as expected (Budai and Larson, 1996).
Interestingly, BL-activation of ChR2 expressing parvOT fibers in
the SC (SC-BL; schemes in Figures 5A and 5B) upon SarMet-
SP significantly reduced the number of C-fiber evoked spikes
from 16.8 ± 1.1 to 11.2 ± 1.5 (Figures 3D1 and 3D2). These find-
ings show that release of OT from parvOT axons can effectively
inhibit the activity of WDR neurons potentiated by NK1R
activation.
Then, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of OT on WDR neuron
firing properties. To do so, we performed in vitro whole-cell
patch clamp recordings in current clamp applying a protocol of
depolarizing current injections (Figure 3E; Breton et al., 2009).

was

rons, from repetitive to phasic in 5/9 of re-
corded cells (Figure 3E), similar to what
was
described
in

layers
(Breton et al., 2009). Importantly, the
application of a specific biased agonist
for OTR linked to Gi subunit, Atosiban (Busnelli et al., 2012),
induced the exact same effects in 4/7 recorded cells (Figure 3E).
This experiment demonstrates for the first time on living tissue
that OTR can functionally bind a Gi protein, thus elucidating
the inhibitory mechanism of OT on the firing properties of WDR
neurons.
Finally, to demonstrate that the population of identified parvOT
neurons is a single anatomical unit and that the same cells proj-
ect collaterals to both the SON and SC, we injected a CAV2-Cre
virus in deep laminae of L5 and Cre-responder AAV expressing
GFP under the OT promoter in the PVN (Figure 4A1). We de-
tected back-labeled cell bodies of GFP/OT neurons in the PVN
and their axonal projections in close proximity to somas and
dendrites of magnOT neurons of the SON (Figures 4A2–4A5).

 properties and short-term potentiation (wind-up; WU) following
repetitive receptive field stimulation were calculated from the
response of WDR neurons in deep laminae. Recordings include
the deep laminae, which integrate convergent peripheral sensory
information from fast-conducting (A-type) and slow-conducting
(C-type) primary afferent fibers (Figures 5 and S6).
We first tested the inhibitory action of OT released from par-
vOT-hypothalamo-spinal terminals by shining BL directly onto
the dorsal surface of the SC (SC-BL). In this set of experiments,
we used the same combination of viruses (CAV2-Cre and rAAV
carrying OT promoter-DIO-ChR2-mCherry) to elicit OT release
from parvocellular PVN fibers. SC-BL efficiently reduced the
WDR discharges from C- (�44.6% ± 3.7%; Figures 5C1 and
5C2) and Ad- (�36.3% ± 4.5%), but not from Ab- fibers
(�0.3% ± 2.8%; Figure S6G2). The half-efficacy of SC-BL inhibi-
tion was 8.3 ± 1.3 s (Figure 5E). The WU returned to control
values �300 s after SC-BL (Figure 5C1). SC-BL had no effect
on superficial layer neuron activity in the same recording condi-
tion as for WDR neurons (Figure S6F). The OTR antagonist dOVT,
directly applied to the surface of the SC, significantly, but not
entirely, reduced Ad- and C-fiber mediated discharges (Figures
5C1 and 5C2). In contrast, the VP receptor type 1A antagonist
applied on SC failed to change the SC-BL inhibition of WU inten-
sity (Figure 5C2), whereas it could efficiently block the effect of
exogenously applied AVP (data not shown). Since VGluT2 was
detected in synaptophysin-GFP-containing (Figures 5F1 and
5F2; overlap of GFP and vGluT2 signals was found in 89% ±
7.4% GFP terminals) axonal terminals of parvOT neurons near
cell bodies of WDR-like neurons (Figure 5F2), we assessed the
effect of NBQX in vivo. Coapplication of both dOVT and NBQX
entirely blocked the SC-BL effects (Figures 5C1 and 5C2).
Thus, stimulation of parvOT axons in SC deep layers leads to a
fast, short-lasting decrease in nociceptive processing which is
mediated by central OTR, and to a lesser extent by ionotropic
Glut receptors.
We then assessed the efficiency of OT release from parvOT
neurons onto magnOT SON neurons in modulating nociception
(Figures 5B and S6A). Eliciting OT release from parvOT fibers
in SON by BL (SON-BL) significantly reduced the WDR dis-
charges
evoked
by
slow-conducting
C-type
fibers
(�24.9% ± 3.1%; Figures 5D1 and 5D2) and fast-conducting
fibers Ad- (�30.0% ± 6.8%), but not by non-nociceptive,
fast-conducting Ab- fibers (�6.4% ± 3.5%; Figure S6G1).
The half-efficacy of SON-BL induced inhibition of WU was
22.2 ± 3 s (T 50%; Figure 5E), a value which was significantly
higher than the SON-BL effect (Figure 5E). The WU intensity
returned to control values only 800 s after SON-BL (Fig-
ure 5D1). Moreover, to further confirm that the reduction in
WU intensity was related to the elevated level of blood OT
(see Figure 1E), we injected the OTR antagonist dOVT intrave-
nously before applying SON-BL. As expected, this abolished
the SON-BL inhibition of WDR discharges that were evoked
by both Ad- and C-fibers (Figures 5D1, 5D2, and S6G1).
Thus, the central release of OT from parvOT axons targeting
magnOT SON neurons leads to a systemic release of OT,
which reduces nociceptive processing by WDR neurons. This
effect was slow to appear and long-lasting.
In summary, the subpopulation of PVN OT parvOT neurons
projecting both to magnOT SON neurons and to NK1R/OTR
WDR neurons from deep layers of SC exerts an inhibition of spi-
nal nociceptive processing by fast action on SC neurons and a
relatively slower effect on peripheral targets by stimulation of
SON neurons and subsequent induction of OT release into
blood.
Activation of ParvOT Neurons Results in Analgesia
In the last part of our work, we analyzed the functional impor-
tance
of
these
parvOT
neurons
in
the
processing
of
inflammatory compared to nerve injury-induced neuropathic
pain. To this purpose, we measured both the effects of stimu-
lation or inhibition of parvOT neurons on the symptoms of either
a peripheral painful inflammatory sensitization triggered by a
single unilateral intraplantar injection of complete Freund adju-
vant (CFA) or a nerve injury-induced neuropathy induced by the
cuffing of the sciatic nerve (Cuff; Pitcher et al., 1999; Fig-
ure S7C1). To this purpose, we used rats that expressed either
ChR2 or hM4Di (Zhu and Roth, 2014) restricted to parvOT PVN
neurons synapsing on magnOT SON neurons (Figure 6A). The
efficiency of ChR2-mediated activation and hM4Di-mediated
inhibition of OT neurons was assessed respectively by targeting
unilaterally the PVN by BL or by i.p. administration of CNO and
was confirmed both in vitro (Figures S7A1 and S7A2) and in vivo
(Figures S7B1–S7B4).
PVN-BL stimulation significantly, but not entirely, alleviated
the CFA-mediated hyperalgesia by raising the threshold of
response to both the mechanical (from 56.7 ± 7.6 g to
116.6 ± 16.4 g) and thermal hot stimulation (from 2.8 ± 0.2 to
4.8 ± 0.7 s; Figures 6C1 and 6C2). In contrast, PVN-BL failed
to mitigate the mechanical hyperalgesia measured in condition
of the Cuff peripheral neuropathy (Figures S7B2 and S7B3).
Furthermore, return of the pain symptoms occurred after
PVN-BL was fully blocked by i.p. injection of the blood brain
barrier (BBB)-permeable OTR antagonist L-368,899 (Figures
6C1 and 6C2).
Conversely, CNO-induced inhibition of parvOT neurons signif-
icantly increased the CFA-mediated hyperalgesia by lowering

 the threshold of response to both the mechanical (from 115 ±
12.1 g to 88 ± 9.8 g) and thermal hot stimulation (from 8.1 ±
0.9 s to 6.3 ± 0.3 s; Figures 6C1 and 6C2). CNO had no effect
in rats with the Cuff (Figures S7C2 and S7C3). These results
from gain- and loss-of-function approaches highlight the role
of parvOT control of peripheral painful sensitization, supported
by our in vivo electrophysiological data.
In the course of our study, we observed that both PVN-BL and
CNO failed to modify mechanical and thermal hot sensitivity in
the absence of any peripheral sensitization, for example, in the
contralateral paw or in naive animals (Figures 6B1, 6B2, 6C1,
6C2, S7C2, and S7C3).
Taken together, these findings provide evidence that 30 par-
vOT neurons are able to strongly promote analgesia in a patho-
logical condition of inflammatory, but not nerve injury-induced
neuropathic pain, presumably by both central (SC-mediated)
and peripheral (SON-mediated) mechanisms.
DISCUSSION
Here, we identified, by a combination of latest state of the art
viral-vector based (Grinevich et al., 2016a), anatomical, optoge-
netic, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches, a small
(n �30) subpopulation of parvOT neurons in the PVN, which
projects to magnOT neurons in the SON and to NK1R or

Functionally,
we
demonstrated
that
this
network
can
inhibit spinal pain processing in a dual
manner with two distinct time courses.
Thus, nociceptive transmission from Ad-
and C-type primary afferents to WDR
neurons is efficiently repressed by OT
release from parvOT in the deep layers of the SC and from
SON magnOT in the blood. Release in the SC is directly trig-
gered from parvOT-spinal projections and follows a fast
mode of action; release in the blood is indirectly triggered
from SON magnOT neurons that are activated by parvOT pro-
jections and follows a slower time course. The functional role of
this subpopulation of parvOT neurons was further confirmed in
two rat models of peripheral painful sensitization, indicating
that activation of parvOT neurons can decrease mechanical
and thermal sensitivities in inflammatory, but not nerve injury-
induced neuropathic pain.
Synaptic Crosstalk between OT Neurons
The question of how OT neurons in different nuclei within the
hypothalamus interact with each other is a recurrent theme in
past literature, but has not been elucidated experimentally. Belin
and colleagues recorded pairs of OT neurons from SON and PVN
and proposed an internuclear connection serving as a basis for
synchronous firing during lactation (Belin et al., 1984, Belin and
Moos, 1986). The hypothesis of an OT-mediated communication
was stated already in the early 80’s (Silverman et al., 1981),
following observations that application of OT (or dOVT) into the
third ventricle or in the SON synchronized (respectively, de-
synchronized) activity of OT neurons in PVN and SON (Freund-
Mercier and Richard, 1984; Lambert et al., 1993). Furthermore,
1300

 the presence of synapses containing OT-immunoreactivity was
demonstrated in the SON (Theodosis, 1985). Although we did
not examine internuclear connectivity that underlies synchro-
nized burst firing, our anatomical and functional data demon-
strate that PVN-SON interconnectivity plays an important role
in inhibiting spinal nociceptive processing and alleviation of in-
flammatory pain.
In an early study, lesion of the SON did not cause any loss of
magnOT neurons in the PVN (Olivecrona, 1957), providing a first
indication that parvOT PVN neurons might be at the basis of
internuclear connection to the SON. However, as of today, the
parvOT neurons in the PVN have remained much less studied
than the magnOT neurons, mostly because of technical diffi-
culties, specifically in labeling and modulating the activity of par-
vOT neurons. To our knowledge, the possibility to study a direct
parvOT innervation of the SON by retrograde tracing techniques
has seldom been discussed (e.g., Lambert et al., 1993) and any
potentially involved parvocellular neurons have never been
identified.
At the SON level, Bruni and Perumal (1984) have described
an extensive network of small-diameter, beaded, unmyelinated
fibers with no particular organizational pattern and of unknown
origin that establishes functional axo-somatic and axo-den-
dritic contacts with magnOT neurons. At 30 years later, we
reveal here a monosynaptic connection between parvOT PVN
and magnOT SON neurons as respective pre- and postsynaptic
components. The detection of a postsynaptic SON component
was further confirmed by their stimulation through application
of CCK (Renaud et al., 1987) and an increase in peripheral
OT levels.
In contrast to the OT system, direct connectivity between
VP-ergic neurons in rats has not been convincingly demon-
strated and, accordingly, we were unable to find VP/Venus pos-
itive fibers descending the PVN in the SON and vice versa.
ParvOT Neurons Modulate NK1R Positive WDR Neurons
In addition to the control of magnOT activity, this newly
described subpopulation of parvOT neurons densely projects
exclusively to the deep layers (V, VI, and X) of the SC. Axonal ter-
minals from parvOT were found in close appositions with NK1R
positive WDR neurons, some of which are likely OTR-positives.
However, we are not excluding projections of these parvOT neu-
rons to non-WDR deep neurons. Nevertheless, their functional
and selective inhibition of C- and Ad- mediated discharges in
WDR suggest that nociceptive C-fiber project to deep layers,
accordingly with models of dorsal horn circuits that include
projections to the lamina V (Cervero and Connell, 1984;
Ribeiro-da-Silva and De Koninck, 2008). Functionally, this fits
with our results suggesting that OT modulates the excitability
of WDR shown as an inhibition of discharges mediated by fibers
containing substance P.
ParvOT Neurons Coordinate Neuroendocrine and
Hardwired Inhibitory Pain Control
In accordance with our anatomical data, WDR action potential
discharges in response to noxious peripheral stimulation are
reduced by optogenetic manipulation of the subpopulation of
OT neurons in the PVN and its subsequent stimulation at the level
of the SON. This reduction was selective to sensory information
transmitted by Ad- and C-fibers, which are, in their majority, noci-
ceptive-specific.
Regarding peripherally mediated OT effects, it has recently
been shown that OTR could be expressed by non-peptidergic
C-type sensory neurons in DRG (Moreno-Lo
´ pez et al., 2013)
and the in vitro application of OT suppresses their activity
(Gong et al., 2015). Furthermore, intravenous administration
of a selective OTR agonist induces an inhibition of discharges
mediated by nociceptive-specific primary afferents (Juif et al.,
2013). Our present work provides an additional support for
this idea by selectively activating a circuit leading to release
of OT to the blood (Figure 7). The effect was fully peripheral,
since inhibition of nociceptive messages was completely abol-
ished by the addition of the OTR selective antagonist dOVT in
the blood flow.
Identification of a subpopulation of parvOT neurons projec-
ting collaterals to both the SON and deep layers of the SC
gave rise to the idea that these neurons may exert both a pe-
ripheral and central control by OT which we found to take
place with a dual time course. This was confirmed by optoge-
netically stimulating parvOT PVN axons located either in the
SON or in the SC. This stimulation led to a reduction of WDR
discharges in response to a peripheral noxious stimulation,
which was selective for Ad- and C-type nociceptive fibers.
The effects in deep layers of the SC seemed to be mediated
by the OTR, as we did not find any effects of VP V1a receptor
similar to what has been reported (Qiu et al., 2014). As OT ter-
minals on WDR-like neurons contained VGluT2, we assessed
glutamate (Glu) and OT contribution to the SC-BL effect on
WU intensity. This revealed that both OT and Glu participated
to the inhibition of WU. These results are in accordance with
our in vitro patch-clamp experiment and can be interpreted
by a network effect as OT axons are likely to form en passant
synapses (Knobloch et al., 2012), allowing local (micro)volume-
transmission from release sites (Knobloch and Grinevich,
2014; Grinevich et al., 2016b). The combination of two pro-
cesses can then explain the observed effects: (1) OT acts on
OTR in WDR neurons to inhibit them via Gi intracellular
pathway (Figure 3E) and (2) coreleased Glu either activates
local GABA-interneurons in layers V–VI and around the cc
(Schneider and Lopez, 2002; Deuchars et al., 2005), which,
in turn, inhibits WDR neurons, or binds a mGluR leading to
the direct inhibition of WDR neurons by a Gi/o pathway (Gerber
et al., 2000; Niswender and Conn, 2010).
Surprisingly, evoked spinal OT release by this subpopulation
of parvOT did not modify nociceptive processing by neurons in
superficial layers. This suggested that the OT inhibition of WDR
firing was not induced by OTR activation in superficial layers,
but only in deep dorsal horn layers. This was in agreement
with our anatomical data describing the vast majority of parvOT
neurons projecting to the deep layers. We failed to reveal any
functional contribution of this subpopulation of parvOT projec-
ting to SON and SC in a nerve-induced neuropathic pain, which
may be modulated by OT projections to superficial layers of the
dorsal horn. In contrast, they exerted a tonic inhibitory control
on WU and pain symptoms in the peripheral inflammation.
We speculate that the inflammatory component in pain state
Neuron 89, 1291–1304, March 16, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
1301
 regulates the excitability of this subset of parvOT neurons, as
observed by c-Fos induction in parvOT neurons (data not
shown). Our results indicate that the described subpopulation
of parvOT neurons specifically targets NK1R and OTR positive
neurons located in the deep layers of the SC to exert antinoci-
ceptive action on WDR to promote analgesia.
Described ParvOT Neurons as a New OT-Ergic Cell Type
Following pioneering works of Swanson and Kuypers (1980),
Sawchenko and Swanson (1982), and Swanson and Sawchenko
(1983), parvOT neurons have been considered as heteroge-
neous cell populations with descending projections to brainstem
and/or SC regions. However, in the present study, we found a
small group of parvOT neurons that forms a pathway distinct
from the classical hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal axonal tract
through the hypothalamus. Although we did not analyze in detail
axonal collaterals of these parvOT cells in other forebrain re-
gions, their existence in the hypothalamus adds a new feature
to parvOT cells. In addition, these neurons simultaneously proj-
ect collaterals to deep layers of the SC, representing a unique
group of specifically located cells, which is likely distinct from
the OT-immunoreactive neurons described by Jo
´ ja
´ rt et al.
(2009) that massively project axons to the superficial layers of
the SC. Based on the unique connectivity of the identified
parvOT neurons, we speculate that they represent a new type
Figure 7. The Role of the Novel Type of
ParvOT Neurons in Coordinating Central
and Peripheral OT Release to Promote Anal-

of OT neurons, which coordinate central
and peripheral inhibition of nociception
and pain perception, and hence, play a
role in promoting analgesia (Figure 7).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Anatomical, electrophysiological, optogenetic, and
behavioral studies were performed with Wistar rats
(for details of the experiment see the respective
figure legend). If not mentioned, rats were housed
understandardconditionswithfoodandwateravail-
able ad libitum. All experiments were conducted un-
der licenses and in accordance with EU regulations.
Viruses
rAAVs (serotype 1/2) carrying conserved regions of
OT and VP promoters and genes of interest in
direct or ‘‘floxed’’ orientations were cloned and
produced as reported previously (Knobloch et al.,
2012). CAV2 equipped with GFP or Cre recombinase was purchased from
the Institute of Molecular Genetics in Montpellier CNRS, France (Bru et al.,
2010)
Neuroanatomy
To trace internuclear connections, rAAVs expressing Venus were injected
into the PVN or SON to follow their axonal projections within the hypothala-
mus. Alternatively, CAV2-Cre was injected into the SON, while Cre-depen-
dent floxed rAAV was injected into the PVN to identify OT PVN neurons
synapsing onto SON neurons.
To trace hypothalamus-SC connections, a CAV2-Cre virus was injected into
the SON and floxed rAAV, into the PVN or CAV2-Cre virus was injected in the
SC, while Cre-dependent rAAV, into the PVN. This allowed us to visualize OT
axon pattern in the SC and to identify projecting PVN OT neurons, respectively.
After transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), brains and/or
SC were sectioned and stained with antibodies against OT, VP, vGluT2,
GFP, NeuN, NK1R, and OTR. Images for qualitative and quantitative analyses
were taken on confocal microscopes Leica SP2 and SP5.
Electrophysiology Experiments
For in vitro patch-clamp recordings, 4 to 8 weeks after injection of virus in adult
rats, brains were removed, the hypothalamus or lumbar SC was isolated, cut
into 400 mm coronal slices, and kept in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF:
118 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM
MgCl2*6H2O, 2 mM CaCl2*2H2O, and 1.2 mM NaH2PO4) saturated 95% di-
oxygen (O2), 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). Visualized neurons were patched with
borosilicate glass pipette (4–9 MU) filled with 140 mM KMeSO4, 10 mM

guanosine triphosphate (GTP) Na salt (pH 7.3), adjusted to 300 mOsm, and
voltage-clamped at �60 mV.
For in vivo extracellular recordings, 4 to 8 weeks after injection of virus, adult
animals were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane and placed in stereotaxic
frame. Extracellular neuronal activity was recorded using a stainless electrode
with 10 MU impedance (FHC; UE(FK1)).
Behavioral Experiments
Mechanical allodynia was measured using a calibrated forceps (Bioseb). Ther-
mal allodynia/hyperalgesia was measured using the Plantar test using
Hargeaves method (Ugo Basile). Peripheral painful inflammatory sensitization
was obtained by a single unilateral intraplantar injection of CFA (Sigma-
Aldrich, 100 ml in the right paw). Nerve injury-induced neuropathy was induced
using the cuffing method.
