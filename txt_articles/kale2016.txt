 Self-Reported Financial Burden of Cancer Care and Its
Effect on Physical and Mental Health-Related Quality of
Life Among US Cancer Survivors
Hrishikesh P. Kale MS; and Norman V. Carroll PhD
BACKGROUND: Cancer-related financial burden has been linked to cancer survivors (CS) forgoing/delaying medical care, skipping
follow-up visits, and discontinuing medications. To the authors’ knowledge, little is known regarding the effect of financial burden on
the health-related quality of life of CS. METHODS: The authors analyzed 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. Financial burden
was present if one of the following problems was reported: borrowed money/declared bankruptcy, worried about paying large medi-
cal bills, unable to cover the cost of medical care visits, or other financial sacrifices. The following outcomes were evaluated: Physical
Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), depressed mood, psy-
chological distress, and worry related to cancer recurrence. The authors also assessed the effect of the number of financial problems
on these outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 19.6 million CS analyzed, 28.7% reported financial burden. Among them, the average PCS (42.3
vs 44.9) and MCS (48.1 vs 52.1) were lower for those with financial burden versus those without. In adjusted analyses, CS with financial
burden had significantly lower PCS (b 5 -2.45), and MCS (b 5 -3.05), had increased odds of depressed mood (odds ratio, 1.95), and
were more likely to worry about cancer recurrence (odds ratio, 3.54). Survivors reporting � 3 financial problems reported statistically
significant and clinically meaningful differences (�3 points) in the mean PCS and MCS compared with survivors without financial
problems. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer-related financial burden was associated with lower health-related quality of life, increased risk of
depressed mood, and a higher frequency of worrying about cancer recurrence among CS. Cancer 2016;122:1283-9. V

INTRODUCTION
As of January 2014, there were approximately 14.5 million cancer survivors (CS) in the United States. By 2024, this number
is expected to reach 19 million as a result of improved survival among patients with cancer and an aging population.1 The an-
nual medical cost of cancer care was estimated to be $124.6 billion in 2010 and is projected to increase to $157.8 billion by
2020.2 With the rise in cost, third-party payers have shifted a portion of these growing costs to patients in the form of coin-
surance and copayments.3 Average out-of-pocket (OOP) spending by patients with cancer is estimated at $1730 to $4727
per year depending on insurance status.4,5 A study of patients with breast cancer reported that lost income and OOP costs
averaged $1455 per month.6 In another study, approximately 12% of patients with breast cancer reported medical debt 4
year after diagnosis.7 CS were also found to be at a higher risk of bankruptcy compared with patients without cancer.8
The financial burden of cancer is a combination of financial stress and difficulties incurred due to high OOP spend-
ing. Survivors experiencing financial burden are likely to forgo or delay overall medical care and mental health-related
services and to avoid filling prescriptions, thereby putting their physical and mental health at risk.9,10 Avoiding follow-up
care also can increase their risk of developing second cancers. Patients with high OOP costs may discontinue their medica-
tions, thereby making them susceptible to poor health outcomes.11-13 Financial burden also has been associated with a
lower satisfaction with care.14 Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of cancer-related financial burden on
broader aspects such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and psychological health. To the best of our knowledge,
only a few studies to date have reported the impact of cancer-related financial problems on the overall well-being of CS.15-
21 These studies were conducted alongside clinical trials and evaluated QOL within a few months after treatment15,17 or

 included only patients from specific racial/ethnic groups
and of lower socioeconomic status.15 Some studies exam-
ined specific cancer types15,17-20 and 2 studies were con-
ducted outside the United States.18,21
We analyzed data using the 2011 Medical Expendi-
ture Panel Survey (MEPS), which included the Cancer Self-
Administered Questionnaire (CSAQ).22 The first objective
of the current study was to determine the prevalence and
assess predictors of cancer-related financial burden. The sec-
ond objective was to examine the association between finan-
cial burden and HRQOL and psychological health. We
hypothesized that CS with financial burden would rate their
HRQOL and psychological health lower than that of survi-
vors without financial burden. We also hypothesized that
HRQOL and psychological health would be lower among
CS who reported more financial problems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
MEPS collects data concerning health care resource use
and the health status of a nationally representative sample
of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population.22 The
CSAQ was developed through collaborative efforts of the
National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National
Institutes of Health Office of Behavioral and Social Scien-
ces Research, the LIVESTRONG Foundation, and the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to address
gaps in the literature related to cancer survivorship high-
lighted by the 2005 Institute of Medicine report.23
Study Design and Sample
This was a cross-sectional study. The CSAQ was adminis-
tered to individuals identified by a question asking
whether a health professional had ever told them they had
cancer. From the total MEPS sample of 35,313 individu-
als, a total of 1592 were eligible and had data on the
CSAQ. However, only 1419 CS were found to have posi-
tive weights. Of 1419 CS, 39 were excluded due to miss-
ing data on all questions measuring financial burden. This
led to the final sample of 1380 CS.
Study Measures
The main independent variable for the current study was
cancer-related financial burden. The following questions
from the CSAQ measured cancer-related financial problems:
1. You or anyone in family had to borrow money or go
into debt.
a. How much money was borrowed or how much debt
was incurred?
b. Have you or a family member ever filed for
bankruptcy?
2. Have you or a family member made any other financial
sacrifices?
3. Ever worried about paying large medical bills?
4. Unable to cover cost of medical care visits?
We considered CS to have a financial burden if they
answered “Yes” to one of the above questions. We also
examined the number of financial problems (range, 0-4)
as a proxy for the extent of financial burden.
The 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (version 2)
(SF-12) scale was used to measure HRQOL. The SF-12
comprises 12 questions measuring 8 domains that are
used to calculate a Physical Component Score (PCS) and
a Mental Component Score (MCS). Both range from 0 to
100 with higher scores indicating better QOL. Both the
PCS and MCS are valid and reliable and have been widely
used.24,25
We also analyzed the impact of financial burden on
psychological distress, depressed mood, and worries
related to cancer recurrence. Psychological distress was
measured using the index of Kessler et al.26,27 Depressed
mood was measured using the Patient Health Question-
naire-2.28 Worries related to cancer recurrence included
responses to 3 questions: 1) how often survivors worry
about cancer getting worse or coming back; 2) how often
they worry about cancer recurrence affecting their respon-
sibilities at home or at work; and 3) what they believe
about their chances of cancer recurrence or the disease get-
ting worse within the next 10 years.
Other variables considered in the current study were
demographics, health insurance, number of chronic health
conditions, cancer type, and time since last cancer treat-
ment and diagnosis. CS were categorized as having breast
cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, short-
survival cancers, and miscellaneous cancers. Miscellaneous
cancer types included the following: bladder, blood, bone,
brain, cervix, kidney, larynx, leukemia, lymphoma, mouth,
muscle, ovary, nonmelanoma skin, skin (unknown), testic-
ular, thyroid, uterus, and others. We combined stomach,
liver, lung, esophagus, and pancreatic cancer into the
“short-survival” type because they tend to have lower sur-
vival and were associated with a higher loss of productivity
and burden of illness compared with patients with breast
cancer and those without cancer.9,29

 unadjusted group comparisons. Multivariable (binary)
logistic regression was conducted to assess predictors of fi-
nancial burden and to assess the impact of financial bur-
den on depressed mood, psychological distress, and
worries regarding cancer recurrence. Multivariable linear
regression was conducted to assess the impact of financial
burden on PCS and MCS.
To understand the impact of the extent of financial
burden on all the outcomes, we repeated our analyses
using the number of financial problems as the independ-
ent variable. For all analyses, we checked model assump-
tions, model fit, and selected covariates based on the
literature and associations observed in the bivariate analy-
ses. All analyses were conducted at an a level of .05 using
SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC) and accounted for the complex survey design
of MEPS. Weights specific to CSAQ were used to obtain
national estimates.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
All results presented are representative estimates for the
US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. As shown in
Table 1, the majority of CS were diagnosed before age 65
years, female, non-Hispanic white, and married and had
�3 noncancer chronic health conditions. Most had access
to health insurance during the course of cancer care. A
total of 17% of the CS had breast cancer, 12% had pros-
tate cancer, and 58% had miscellaneous cancers.
Bivariate analysis indicated significant differences in
the majority of the characteristics between CS with and
without financial burden. Adjusted analysis indicated that
younger age at diagnosis, being female, being a member of
a racial/ethnic minority group, lacking access to health in-
surance, being currently treated, being diagnosed between
1 to < 3 years previous, and having a short-survival cancer
were significant predictors of financial burden (Table 1).
Cancer-Related Financial Burden
The current study sample represented 19.6 million CS.
Of these, 7.6% borrowed money, incurred debt, or
declared bankruptcy. Of CS, 4.2% borrowed < $10,000,
3.0% borrowed � $10,000, and 1.4% declared bank-
ruptcy. Approximately 20.9% were worried about paying
large medical bills, 11.5% were unable to cover the cost of
medical care visits, and 8.6% made other financial sacrifi-
ces. Approximately 71.3% of CS reported no financial
problems, and 28.7% reported at least 1 financial
problem. Approximately 15.8% of CS reported exactly 1
financial problem, 7.2% reported 2, 4.1% reported 3, and
1.5% incurred all 4 financial problems.
Effect of Financial Burden on PCS and MCS
Bivariate analyses indicated that the mean PCS and MCS
were significantly lower for CS with financial burden com-
pared with those with no financial burden (Table 2). This
finding was consistent after adjusting for other variables.
We found that financial burden had a significant linear
association with PCS and MCS (Table 3). Furthermore,
survivors with� 3 financial problems were found to have
significantly lower PCS and MCS compared with survivors
without financial problems (Table 3).
We also examined PCS and MCS by individual finan-
cial burden questions. CS who borrowed money or declared
bankruptcy were found to have lower PCS and MCS com-
pared with CS without financial burden (Table 2).
Effect of Financial Burden on Depressed Mood,
Psychological Distress, and Worries About
Cancer Recurrence
Multivariable logistic regression indicated that CS with fi-
nancial burden had 1.95 times higher odds of depressed
mood than those without (Table 3). The odds for
depressed mood were 3.41 times higher for survivors
reporting �3 financial problems (Table 3). The preva-
lence of psychological distress was found to increase from
4% in CS without financial burden to 12% for those
reporting � 3 financial problems. In the adjusted analysis,
CS reporting �3 problems had 2.56 times higher odds of
psychological distress compared with CS without finan-
cial problems (Table 3).
CS with financial burden were more frequently wor-
ried about cancer recurrence (69% vs 35%) and cancer re-
currence affecting their responsibilities (70% vs 38%).
They perceived a greater possibility of cancer recurring or
getting worse within the next 10 years (45% vs 24%).
Adjusted analysis indicated that CS with financial burden
had 3.54 times higher odds of being worried about cancer
recurrence (Table 4). Similar findings were observed for
other cancer recurrence worries. Furthermore, odds for
worrying about cancer recurrence increased with the num-
ber of financial problems (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Using a nationally representative sample, we assessed the
sources and extent of financial burden of cancer care, ana-
lyzed HRQOL using a validated tool (SF-12), and
included both short-term and long-term CS. We observed
that CS with financial burden had lower HRQOL

reported
lower
HRQOL. We observed larger differences in the MCS
than the PCS, which indicates that financial burden
affects the mental health of CS more than it affects their
physical health. A difference of � 3 points for PCS and
MCS on the SF-12 is considered a clinically meaningful
difference.30-32 We found a statistically significant but not
clinically meaningful difference of 2.6 points in the PCS
for survivors with financial burden versus survivors with-
out. However, there was a clinically meaningful difference
of 6 points for PCS noted among survivors reporting �3
problems. For the MCS, we observed a statistically signifi-
cant and clinically meaningful difference of 4 points for
CS with financial burden versus those without. Further-
more, as the number of financial problems increased, the
MCS decreased linearly up to a 9-point difference.
The prevalence of financial burden of 29% found in
the current study was consistent with estimates from
national surveys (range, 30%-33%).9,16 However, it was
lower than estimates from studies13,14,20,33,34 that included
survivors of specific cancer types, those recruited from spe-
cific institutions, or those reporting financial burden using
different scales (range, 38%-60%). The current study find-
ings related to predictors of financial burden were found to
be similar to those of previous studies.7,9,13,16,34,35
The majority of CS worried about paying large med-
ical bills, some were unable to cover their medical bills,

 and a smaller percentage indicated borrowing money or
declaring bankruptcy. Although the percentage of CS
reporting bankruptcy/borrowing money was small, it cor-
responded to approximately 1.5 million CS nationally;
these individuals reported the worst physical and mental
HRQOL.
To the best of our knowledge, few studies to date
have examined the effect of cancer-related financial burden
on the psychological health of CS.19,21 The findings
reported herein suggest that CS with at least 1 financial
problem were more likely to report depressed mood and
psychological distress and were more frequently worried
about cancer recurrence. Furthermore, the risk of these out-
comes was higher for CS who reported more financial
problems. CS reporting � 3 financial problems were found
to have 3.4 times higher odds of depressed mood, 2.6 times
higher odds of experiencing psychological distress, and 9.4
times higher odds of worrying about cancer recurrence.
The current study has several limitations. First, it
was a cross-sectional study and therefore no causal infer-
ences can be drawn. Second, because MEPS does not col-
lect data regarding cancer stage and severity or treatment
type, we were unable to control for these factors. To our
knowledge, few studies to date have reported an associa-
tion between the type of treatment received and financial
burden.9,34 Third, recall bias may be present in the self-
reported MEPS data. This is more likely for CS who com-
pleted treatment �5 years ago. However, a sensitivity
analysis indicated that HRQOL was consistently lower
among CS with financial burden versus those without
regardless of time since last treatment. Fourth, we could
not control for psychiatric illness that preceded or was
caused by the cancer diagnosis because the majority of CS
in the current study (65%) were diagnosed � 5 years ago
and because MEPS did not collect data regarding history
of psychiatric illness.
Decreasing the financial burden of cancer is a complex
problem that requires integrated efforts from health care sys-
tems, patients, and providers. Oncologists should consider
selecting treatments that are less expensive but similar in
effectiveness and involve patients in decision-making as well
as make them aware of the financial consequences of treat-
ments. A framework with which to assess the value of cancer
therapies, similar to the one developed by the American Soci-
ety of Clinical Oncology,36 could help clinicians choose
more cost-effective therapies. Patients with cancer should
educate themselves regarding survivorship issues, the cover-
age and benefit design of their health plans, and organiza-
tions that provide financial assistance. Future research
should assess the role of value-based reimbursement, clinical
practice guidelines, and physician-patient communication
regarding reducing the cost of cancer care.
The results of the current study demonstrated that 29%
of CS in the United States reported at least 1 cancer-related fi-
nancial problem. CS with financial problems, especially those
reporting more problems, were found to have lower physical
and mental HRQOL, an increased risk of depressed mood,
were more likely to be psychologically distressed, and more
frequently worried about cancer recurrence.
