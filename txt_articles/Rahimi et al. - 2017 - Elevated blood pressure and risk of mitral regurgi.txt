Abstract
Background
Mitral regurgitation in people without prior cardiac disease is considered a degenerative dis-
ease with no established risk factors for its prevention. We aimed to test the hypothesis that
elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) across its usual spectrum is associated with higher
risk of mitral regurgitation.
Methods and findings
We used linked electronic health records from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice
Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2015. CPRD covers
approximately 7% of the current UK population and is broadly representative of the popula-
tion by age, sex, and ethnicity. About 5.5 million UK patients with no known cardiovascular
or valve disease at baseline were included in this cohort study. We investigated the relation-
ship between blood pressure (BP) and risk of mitral regurgitation using Cox regression mod-
els. Our primary exposure variable was SBP and our primary outcome was incident reports
of mitral regurgitation, which were identified from hospital discharge reports or primary care
records.
Of the 5,553,984 patients in the CPRD that met our inclusion criteria, during the 10-year
follow-up period, 28,655 (0.52%) were diagnosed with mitral regurgitation and a further
1,262 (0.02%) were diagnosed with mitral stenosis. SBP was continuously related to the risk
of mitral regurgitation with no evidence of a nadir down to 115 mmHg (p < 0.001). Each 20
mmHg increment in SBP was associated with a 26% higher risk of mitral regurgitation (haz-
ard ratio [HR] 1.26; CI 1.23, 1.29). The observed association was partially mediated by dis-
eases affecting the left ventricle during follow-up (myocardial infarction [MI], ischaemic heart
disease [IHD], cardiomyopathy, and heart failure). However, the percentage of excess risk
mediated (PERM) by these proximate causes of secondary mitral regurgitation was only

 13% (CI 6.1%, 20%), and accounting for them had little effect on the long-term association
between SBP and mitral regurgitation (mediator-adjusted HR 1.22; CI 1.20, 1.25; p <
0.001). Associations were similar for each 10 mmHg increment in diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) (p < 0.001) or each 15 mmHg increment in pulse pressure (PP) (p < 0.001). By con-
trast, there was no association between SBP and risk of mitral stenosis (HR per 20 mmHg
higher SBP 1.03; CI 0.93, 1.14; p = 0.58). These analyses are based on routinely collected
data from health records which may be sensitive to measurement errors, and the observed
associations may not be generalizable to less severe and subclinical cases of mitral
regurgitation.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to elevated BP across its whole spectrum is associated with an
increased risk of primary and secondary mitral regurgitation. These findings suggest that BP
control may be of importance in the prevention of mitral regurgitation.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for a range of cardiovascular
conditions.
• Mitral regurgitation in people without prior cardiac disease is considered a degenerative
disease with no established risk factors for its prevention.
• Whether elevated BP is also a risk factor for mitral regurgitation is unknown.
What did the researchers do and find?
• About 5.5 million UK patients with no known cardiovascular or valve disease at baseline
were included in this cohort study and were followed up for about 10 years.
• This study shows a clear log-linear association between elevated BP and risk of mitral
regurgitation (but not mitral stenosis) with no apparent threshold below or above which
the relationship ceased to exist.
• The association was only partially mediated by conditions that are established causes of
secondary mitral regurgitation, suggesting that elevated BP has a direct and independent
effect on valve degeneration.
What do these findings mean?
• The findings from this study suggest that mitral regurgitation is not an inevitable conse-
quence of ageing and that its risk might be modifiable with established interventions.
• Future studies should establish the causality of the observed associations and test
whether BP lowering might reduce the risk of mitral regurgitation.

 Introduction
Mitral regurgitation is the most common valvular heart disorder in high-income countries,
and its prevalence increases with age [1,2]. The strong age-dependent prevalence rates suggest
that, as a consequence of worldwide ageing and population growth, crude rates of mitral regur-
gitation are likely to increase further in the coming decades.
Despite substantial progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology of mitral regurgi-
tation and advances in surgical and interventional valve replacement therapies, there are no
established preventive strategies [3]. Causes of mitral regurgitation are categorised as “pri-
mary” when due to abnormalities of the valve leaflets and chordae or as “secondary” when due
to distortion of ventricular shape related to ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or a cardiomyopa-
thy. However, the distinction between these subtypes is not always obvious, and about two-
thirds of all mitral regurgitation cases are classified as degenerative [4], implying that they are
a natural consequence of ageing with no possibility of altering their course.
Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a strong risk factor for a range of cardiovascular conditions
[5]. Given that increased BP correlates with higher left ventricular pressure, and this, in turn,
exposes the mitral valve to higher physical stress, it seems plausible that long-term exposure to
higher BP could also lead to structural and functional changes of the mitral valve. A cross-sec-
tional analysis of the Framingham study showed a positive association between hypertension
and mitral regurgitation [6]. However, to our knowledge, there are no longitudinal studies that
have reported associations. We, therefore, aimed to test the hypothesis that elevated systolic
blood pressure (SBP) across its usual spectrum is associated with higher risk of mitral
regurgitation.
Methods
Data source
We used linked electronic health records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink
(CPRD) from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2015. The CPRD contains anonymised patient
data from 674 general practices in the UK [7]. It covers approximately 7% of the current UK
population and is broadly representative of the population by age, sex, and ethnicity. It par-
tially links primary care records with discharge diagnosis from secondary care (Hospital Epi-
sode Statistics) and mortality data from national death registries (Office for National
Statistics). The dataset is considered the most comprehensive longitudinal primary care data-
base with serial collection of information relating to diagnosis, treatments, investigations, and
outcomes [8] and has been validated for epidemiological research for a range of conditions,
including those heavily relying on imaging tests [7,9]. Scientific approval for this study was
given by the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC). The CPRD Group
has obtained ethics approval from a National Research Ethics Service Committee for all purely
observational research using anonymised CPRD data. A separate ethics approval was not
required for this work.
Study population
A total of 6,613,644 patients between 30 and 90 years old with at least 1 BP measurement were
identified. Patients entered the study at the date of their earliest BP measurement (baseline)
and exited the study at the earliest date of transfer out of the general practice, death, end of the
study period, or a record of mitral regurgitation. We further excluded all individuals who at
baseline had a prior clinical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (409,075), mitral valve disease
including mitral valve prolapse (14,592), or were prescribed lipid-lowering or antihypertensive

 medication (196,451). Cardiovascular disease was defined, as previously reported [10,11],
using ICD-10 and Read codes for myocardial infarction (MI), IHD (including reports of
angina or coronary revascularization), stroke, transient ischaemic attack, heart failure, cardio-
myopathy, chronic kidney disease, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation, or venous
thromboembolism. We further excluded individuals with extreme values of baseline SBP with
recordings outside the range 50 to 300 mmHg (14,233; 0.08% of all recordings, but their inclu-
sion led to virtually unchanged associations). Patients with less than 1 year follow-up with the
general practice (126,358) and patients whose BP measurements were before 1990 (313,633)
were also excluded. This led to the selection of 5,553,984 individuals for this study with a
median (interquartile interval [IQI]) follow-up duration of 10 (4.7, 17) years.
Outcomes and exposures
Our primary outcome was incident reports of mitral regurgitation, which were identified from
hospital discharge reports, death registers, or primary care records using the diagnostic codes
shown in S1 Table. We excluded diagnostic codes which classified mitral valve disease as con-
genital or when mixed mitral valve disease was reported with no clear indication of the domi-
nant condition. We did not have complete information on echocardiography for all patients.
However, previous validation studies based on electronic health records have shown that the
majority of clinically recorded valve disease codes are based on echocardiographic assessments
and have a high positive predictive value for the valve diagnosis (>85%) [2]. They further
show that recorded cases typically represent moderate to severe severity ratings that are clini-
cally relevant [2] (whereas epidemiological studies with population screening tend to identify a
larger number of patients with mild and asymptomatic diseases [12]). For more direct valida-
tion of valve disease and its severity in our study, we performed 3 subgroup analyses (see Sta-
tistical analysis). In addition, as a negative control secondary outcome, we chose incident
reports of mitral stenosis, expecting no association with BP, since mitral stenosis without
regurgitation is nearly always due to rheumatic valve disease. Finally, to test the validity of
database and methods for measuring and modelling exposure variables and covariates, we
chose incident stroke as a positive control outcome and report BP associations with stroke.
BP measurements were identified from the CPRD database as measurements with an entity
type 1 (the entity type corresponding to a BP measurement). We defined SBP as our primary
exposure because SBP has been shown to have the strongest predictive ability among most
other measures of BP for most cardiovascular outcomes [13,14] and because it is a better indi-
cator of afterload than diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and hence could play a stronger role in
the pathophysiology of mitral regurgitation. However, in additional prespecified analyses, we
chose DBP and pulse pressure (PP; defined as SBP–DBP) as alternative exposure variables to
investigate any differential effect of BP indices on risk and to enable comparison of our find-
ings with epidemiological studies of BP associations with other outcomes [13–15].
Statistical analysis
In consideration of measurement error surrounding a single BP measurement and other time-
dependent fluctuations of BP (in particular in the context of routinely recorded BP by doctors
and nurses), we used multiple BP measurements to calculate ‘usual’ values that are corrected
for regression dilution [16]. As previously reported [10,11,17], we used generalised estimating
equations to regress serial BP measurements within the median follow-up (mean of 6.7 mea-
surements per patient) on the baseline BP. Usual SBP, DBP, and PP were analysed as continu-
ous variables with 20 mmHg, 10 mmHg, and 15 mmHg increments, respectively. SBP was
further analysed as a categorical variable (�120 mmHg, 121 mmHg to 140 mmHg, 141 mmHg

 to 160 mmHg, and �160 mmHg), modelled as a continuous variable with 1 mmHg incre-
ments, and plotted using Cox regression with restricted cubic spline with 4 knots. We deter-
mined the association between SBP (and other BP indices) and each outcome using Cox
regression, with hazard ratios (HRs) displayed with floating absolute risks, which do not
require the selection of an arbitrary baseline group for display of confidence intervals [18]. We
tested the proportional hazards assumption of Cox models using log cumulative hazards plots
for SBP categories and found no evidence of lack of proportional hazards (S1 Fig). Our pri-
mary analyses were adjusted for baseline sex, age, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), smoking sta-
tus (no, previous, yes), cholesterol (total, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density
lipoprotein [HDL]), and year of the initial BP measurement (as a categorical variable [1990 to
1994, 1995 to 1999, 2000 to 2004, 2005 to 2009, and 2010 to 2013]) to control for potential
cohort effects, and stratified by general practice. For BMI, smoking, and lipid levels, we utilised
the most recent measurement within 2 years of the baseline SBP measurement (index encoun-
ter with the general practice when SBP was recorded). If no measurement was available within
this timeframe, we classified the covariate as missing. We addressed missing data using multi-
ple imputation by expectation-maximisation with bootstrapping [19], generating 5 imputa-
tions [20].
To investigate the extent to which the potential association between BP and mitral regurgi-
tation is mediated by incident MI, IHD, heart failure, or cardiomyopathy, which are estab-
lished causes of secondary mitral regurgitation, we performed time-varying adjustments for
these events during the follow-up. The HR from this confounder- and mediator-adjusted
model provides an estimation of association between BP and primary mitral regurgitation. To
determine what proportion of the association between usual BP and risk of mitral regurgita-
tion was mediated by these events, we then calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated
(PERM) using the formula: PERM = (HRconfounder-adjusted − HRconfounder- and mediator-adjusted)/
(HRconfounder-adjusted). We estimated confidence intervals through percentile bootstrapping
based on 1,000 runs.
We performed subgroup analyses and report interactions by age, sex, and BMI groups. We
also compared the predictive value of PP, mean arterial pressure, and mid arterial pressure on
the risk of mitral regurgitation using Harrell’s c-statistic [21]. Mean arterial pressure was
defined as 2/3 DBP + 1/3 SBP and mid arterial pressure as 1/2 SBP + 1/2 DBP.
To investigate the validity of our outcome variables and the potential effect of valve severity
on outcomes, we performed the following 3 sensitivity analyses. First, we extracted informa-
tion on echocardiograms within 14 days prior to the recorded diagnosis of mitral regurgitation
and stratified analyses by echocardiographically supported diagnoses of mitral regurgitation
versus other reports with no recorded information on diagnostic tools. Second, we stratified
our analyses according to whether or not there was a definitive report of valve replacement
therapy (i.e., surgical or interventional valve replacement or repair) to assess whether observa-
tions might have been diluted due to inclusion of mild or asymptomatic cases. Third, we strati-
fied our analyses by initial source of case reporting (hospital discharge versus outpatient or
primary care), assuming hospital diagnosis cases to be more severe and more likely to be veri-
fied by specialists. Additional sensitivity and validation analyses are described in S1 Text.
Study findings are reported in accordance with the reporting of studies conducted using
Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) Statement [22]. There was no spe-
cific analysis plan for the current study, but the main analysis followed a general analysis plan
for investigation of associations between BP and several outcomes including valvular heart dis-
ease (S2 Text and earlier reports [10,11,17,23] describing the general analysis plan). Deviations
from the general protocol were largely informed by the clinical differences between outcomes
and reviewer comments. More specifically, for this paper, we introduced a mediation analysis

 to assess the mediator-corrected associations and several sensitivity analyses to validate our
findings (see above and S1 Text). In addition, the restricted cubic spline Cox regression (Fig 1)
and the further division of age groups in Fig 3 were specific requests by reviewers of this jour-
nal. Statistical analyses were performed in R, version 3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing, Vienna, Austria).

 Results
Of the 5,553,984 patients in the CPRD that met our inclusion criteria, 28,655 (0.52%) were
diagnosed with mitral regurgitation during follow-up and a further 1,262 (0.02%) were diag-
nosed with mitral stenosis. Patient characteristics by usual SBP categories are shown in
Table 1.
Age-specific analyses showed a continuous and approximately log-linear adjusted relation-
ship between usual SBP and risk of mitral regurgitation throughout the SBP range with no evi-
dence of a threshold below or above which the associations were different (Fig 1). As expected,
the HRs for a given difference in usual SBP are smaller in older age groups (as indicated by the

 slope of the age-specific associations). However, the absolute risk of developing mitral regurgi-
tation increases substantially with age, leading to a substantial net contribution of elevated SBP
on risk of mitral regurgitation even in the older age groups (Fig 1).
When usual SBP was analysed as a continuous variable, each 20 mmHg increment in usual
SBP was associated with a 26% higher risk of mitral regurgitation (adjusted HR 1.26; CI 1.23,
1.29) (Fig 2). Compared with the reference category of usual SBP � 120 mmHg, patients with
usual SBP � 161 mmHg were 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with mitral regurgitation
(HR 1.49; CI 1.38, 1.61) (Fig 2).
Adjusted HRs among subgroups are shown in Fig 3. HRs attenuated with increasing age (p
for trend < 0.001). For patients aged less than 50 years at baseline, each 20 mmHg increment
in SBP was associated with a 54% higher risk of mitral regurgitation (HR 1.54; CI 1.46, 1.63),
whereas in patients aged 71–90 the risk was higher by 13% (HR 1.13; CI 1.08, 1.19) (Fig 3).
Proportional differences were broadly similar between men and women. There was evidence
that the associations between usual SBP and mitral regurgitation differed by baseline BMI,
with weaker associations observed among those with higher BMI (p for interaction < 0.01, Fig
3, p for trend = 0.44). Associations were similar when echocardiographically supported reports
were compared with reports without evidence of an echocardiogram within 14 days before the
valve diagnosis, when hospital discharge reports were compared with outpatient diagnoses
recorded by general practitioners, or when definitive reports of valve replacement were com-
pared with patients with no clear reports of valve replacement (Fig 4).
Associations of PP and DBP with mitral regurgitation were broadly consistent with those
for SBP: each 15 mmHg higher usual PP was associated with a 23% greater risk of mitral regur-
gitation (HR 1.23; CI 1.20, 1.27), and each 10 mmHg higher usual DBP was associated with a
24% greater risk of mitral regurgitation (HR 1.24; CI 1.20, 1.28). Similar to SBP, these associa-
tions differed by age group, with stronger associations observed among the younger groups (p
for trend < 0.001 for both DBP and PP, S2 Fig). In comparative analyses, SBP showed the
strongest, and DBP the weakest, overall predictive power among the BP indices investigated
(S2 Table). Age-stratified analyses were broadly consistent with the overall results (S2 Table).

 IHD, MI, heart failure, or cardiomyopathy during follow-up were strongly associated with
mitral regurgitation (HR 2.94; CI 2.86, 3.03). Adjusting for their effect provides an estimate of
the association between BP and mitral regurgitation without a mediating effect of left ventricu-
lar disease as the more proximal causes of secondary mitral regurgitation. This adjustment led
to a mild attenuation of associations between SBP and mitral regurgitation (from confounder-
adjusted HR 1.26; CI 1.23, 1.29 to confounder- and mediator-adjusted HR 1.22; CI 1.20, 1.25).
The percentage of excess risk attributable to these intermediary outcomes was 13% (CI
6.1% to 20%), suggesting that only 13% of the overall association across all primary and sec-
ondary mitral regurgitation reports is mediated by left ventricular disease prior to a diagnosis
of mitral regurgitation. The potential effect of over-adjustment assessed by a progressive
adjustment of covariates, in which consecutively adjusting for each covariate had little effect
on the estimated HRs per 20 mmHg higher SBP for mitral regurgitation (S3 Fig).

 In our negative control analysis, there was no association between SBP and risk of mitral
stenosis (HR per 20 mmHg higher SBP 1.03; CI 0.93, 1.14) (S4–S6 Figs). Also supporting our
main findings, our positive control analysis with stroke as the outcome did not show any evi-
dence of bias towards extreme: overall each 20 mmHg increment in SBP was associated with a
34% higher risk of stroke (HR 1.34; CI 1.33, 1.35) across all age groups or a 43% higher risk of
stroke (HR 1.43; CI 1.40, 1.47) among the patients aged between 50 and 60 years old. Addi-
tional sensitivity analyses produced very similar results to our main analyses (S1 Text).
Discussion
In this large-scale cohort of UK adults involving approximately 30,000 new cases of mitral
regurgitation with 10 years of follow-up, we show that exposure to elevated BP was continu-
ously associated with an increased risk of mitral regurgitation with no apparent threshold at
which the association ceased to exist. More specifically, every 20 mmHg increment in usual
SBP was associated with a 26% higher risk of mitral regurgitation during follow-up. Associa-
tions differed by baseline features of patients, with stronger associations observed in younger
and leaner patient groups.
Mitral regurgitation is a heterogeneous condition that can be caused by primary structural
abnormalities of the valve apparatus (primary mitral regurgitation) or diseases of the left ven-
tricle leading to incomplete closure of a structurally normal valve (secondary mitral regurgita-
tion). The main diseases of the left ventricle that are commonly considered as more proximate
causes of secondary mitral regurgitation are MI, IHD, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy.
Because elevated BP is a known risk factor for these conditions, it is possible that the observed
association between BP and mitral regurgitation is entirely or largely a reflection of such indi-
rect effects. However, accounting for the possible intermediary effect of diseases of the left

 ventricle had little impact on the observed associations between elevated BP and risk of mitral
regurgitation. In confounder- and mediator-adjusted models, which in essence provide an
estimation of the association between BP and primary mitral regurgitation, the overall HR was
only slightly attenuated and only 13% of the excess risk could be attributed to the intermediary
outcomes. This indicates that 87% of the effect of BP on mitral regurgitation was independent
of diseases of the left ventricle that occurred during follow-up, suggesting that BP may exert its
main effect on the mitral valve directly or via mechanisms unrelated to left ventricular dilata-
tion or dysfunction. However, our mediation analysis was relatively crude and alternative
causal inference modelling approaches might be better suited to disentangle the effect of medi-
ators and confounders during follow-up.
Our study was not designed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the observed asso-
ciations between BP and mitral regurgitation, and we can only speculate about possible patho-
physiological pathways. Physiologically, the mitral valve is exposed to considerable mechanical
force in systole reflecting rapid closure of the valve at the start of systole and subsequent
increased pressure difference between the left ventricle and atrium throughout systole. High
BP is also associated with elevated left atrial diastolic pressures, which during diastole leads to
a higher mitral valve opening pressure. This might alter blood flow patterns, resulting in
abnormal shear stress on the atrial surface of the valve leaflets, as well as abnormal shear stress
on the ventricular side of the leaflets when the valve is closed. Therefore, it seems plausible that
the mechanical stress caused by the elevated BP will lead to gradual structural changes of the
valve apparatus. Future studies could explore these and alternative mechanisms further. Such
studies, ideally when repeated cardiac imaging is available, might also be able to investigate
whether the observed associations differ by presence or type of underlying valve pathologies,
such as Barlow disease or mitral valve prolapse [24].
We are not aware of any prior longitudinal studies that have investigated the association
between BP and risk of mitral regurgitation. A cross-sectional study based on the Framingham
cohort involved 2,881 participants and showed that those with hypertension had a 1.6 times
higher risk of concomitant mitral regurgitation (CI 1.2, 2.0) [6]. Further evidence in support
for our findings comes from studies that have reported an association between elevated BP
and risk of mitral annulus calcification, which is related to degenerative mitral regurgitation
[25]. Our large-scale cohort study extends these prior findings and shows that exposure to ele-
vated BP is significantly associated with an increased the risk of mitral regurgitation.
Our analyses are based on routinely collected data from linked electronic health records,
which might be more prone to measurement errors than prospectively designed research data-
sets. However, measurement errors in our exposure variable are unlikely to be biased, given
that BP measurements were often recorded several years before the occurrence of outcomes
and many of them were within the conventionally ‘normal’ range. This is supported by the
lack of association between BP and mitral stenosis in our study (although this does not exclude
a significant association in certain groups of patients with mitral stenosis, such as elderly in
whom mitral stenosis may be due to mitral annulus calcification). The confirmation of the
association between BP and stroke in our validation analysis further supports the suitability of
our database and exposure variable for investigation of valve disease [13,14]. To reduce the
impact of inevitable random measurement error in our exposure variable, we used multiple
BP measurements and corrected baseline values for regression dilution. We did not adjust for
anti-hypertensive use during follow-up but this and any other residual uncontrolled measure-
ment error in BP measurements would only be expected to have biased our estimates towards
the null and reduced statistical power [16,26]. In addition, our regression dilution correction
method for BP measurements indirectly takes account of the effect of anti-hypertensive treat-
ment during follow-up, consistent with prior research that has shown that additional control

 for anti-hypertensive use has little impact on the regression dilution ratios [27]. As for our out-
come variable mitral regurgitation, it is well known that studies based on clinically reported
events are more likely to only capture functionally relevant and symptomatic disease states
and, for this reason and because of incomplete record linkage, will underestimate rates com-
pared to epidemiological studies that screen the entire population for subclinical and clinical
disease. Thus, the observed associations may not be generalizable to less severe and subclinical
cases of mitral regurgitation. Within the setting of clinical mitral regurgitation, any random
measurement error in diagnostic coding or missingness as a result of incomplete case ascer-
tainment would be expected to make estimates less precise and is unlikely to have any material
impact on our overall findings [16]. In addition, our findings were robust to several alternative
assumptions, including a comparison of in-patient and out-patient diagnoses and cases with a
definitive report of echocardiogram versus others, suggesting that residual confounding is
unlikely to have played a substantial role. Nonetheless, as with most observational studies, our
study in isolation may not establish causation beyond doubt. New trials with mitral valve
regurgitation as an outcome are needed to answer this question reliably. Alternatively or in
addition, individual patient data meta-analysis of unreported valvular outcomes from previ-
ously published trials or Mendelian randomisation studies might provide additional insights
into the potential causal role of BP on mitral regurgitation.
In conclusion, our large-scale prospective study suggests that long-term exposure to ele-
vated BP across its whole spectrum is associated with an increased risk of primary and second-
ary mitral regurgitation. These findings suggest that BP control may be of importance in the
prevention of mitral regurgitation.
