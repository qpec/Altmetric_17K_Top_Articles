Abstract
Purpose—We examined whether sedentary lifestyle habits and physical activity level are 
associated with abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), 
intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), and liver attenuation, independently of each other and 
potential confounders.
Methods—Analysis of 3,010 African American and Caucasian men and women, aged 42–59 
years, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who 
completed multiple-slice abdominal computed tomography (CT) in 2010–2011. Participants 
reported average hours per day sitting (television, computing, paperwork, music, telephone, car). 
Physical activity was assessed with the CARDIA Physical Activity History. VAT, SAT, IMAT, and 
liver attenuation were estimated from CT. Multivariable general linear regression models regressed 
means of fat depots on total sedentary time, task-specific sedentary time, and total physical 
activity.
Results—Television-viewing was positively, and physical activity inversely, associated with fat 
depots. For each 1 SD increment in television-viewing (1.5 hours/day), VAT, SAT, and IMAT were 
greater by 3.5 cm3, 3.4 cm3, and 3.9 cm3, respectively (p<0.03 for all). For each 1 SD increment in 
physical activity (275 exercise units), VAT, SAT, and IMAT were lower by 7.6 cm3, 6.7 cm3, and 
8.1 cm3, respectively, and liver attenuation was greater (indicating more liver fat) by 0.5 
Hounsfield Units (p<0.01 for all). Total sedentary time was associated with VAT, IMAT, and liver 
attenuation in White men only after controlling for physical activity, SAT, and other potential 
confounders (p≤0.01 for all). No other task-specific sedentary behaviors were associated with fat 
depots.

Introduction
Abdominal obesity is an established risk factor for both metabolic and cardiovascular 
diseases (7). Excess levels of fat located within the intra-abdominal cavity in particular, 
including visceral adipose tissue (VAT), intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and liver fat, 
are associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, 
hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (23, 27, 32, 33). Subcutaneous adipose tissue 
(SAT) on the other hand may be relatively less important in the pathophysiology of chronic 
disease development (15).
General adiposity has a number of putative contributors, and level of physical activity is 
considered a key factor. The health benefits of physical activity are well established, and 
include a reduction in risk for many common chronic diseases, as well as reducing fat 
deposition, independent of body mass index (BMI) (19). Recent studies have identified 
associations between sedentary behaviors (e.g. sitting or lying down) and adverse health 
outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and all-cause mortality (3). 
Cross-sectional evidence also suggests that meeting guidelines for physical activity may not 
be sufficient for chronic disease prevention if accompanied by high levels of sedentary time 
(11). A potential pathway through which sedentary behavior may independently predict 
chronic disease progression is body composition, particularly amount and type of intra-
abdominal fat depots.
Few studies have examined the associations between sedentary behavior and intra-
abdominal fat depots, with mixed results. Some evidence suggests a positive association 
between sedentary time and VAT (13, 26, 31), while other studies report no association (20, 
22, 29). To our knowledge, only one study has examined the associations between sedentary 
behavior and liver fat (13), or sedentary behavior and abdominal IMAT (20), two fat depots 
that may be independent predictors of metabolic risk (27, 33). Previous studies examining 
sedentary behavior and intra-abdominal fat depots have been limited by small samples with 
little racial/ethnic diversity.
We address these important gaps in the literature by studying a large sample of Black and 
White men and women who completed a detailed sedentary behavior questionnaire and had 
computed tomography (CT) measured abdominal VAT, SAT, IMAT and liver attenuation (a 
diagnostic method to assess liver fat). The aim of this study was to examine whether 
sedentary lifestyle habits and physical activity level are associated with abdominal fat depots 
(VAT, SAT, and IMAT) and liver attenuation, independent of each other and potential 
confounders. We hypothesized that sedentary time would be positively, and physical activity 
level inversely, associated with abdominal fat depots, and that sedentary time and physical 
activity would be independent and additive in their prediction of abdominal fat depots.

 Given the known race and sex differences in abdominal adipose distribution (18, 30) and the 
potential differential effects on cardiovascular disease risk (1, 9), we also examined if these 
associations vary by sex and race.
Methods
Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) is an ongoing prospective 
cohort study of 5,115 Black and White men and women who were initially recruited in 
1985–1986 from four urban centers: Birmingham, Alabama; Minneapolis, Minnesota; 
Chicago, Illinois; and Oakland, California. Participants completed additional measurement 
visits in 1987–1988 (Year 2), 1990–1991 (Year 5), 1992–1993 (Year 7), 1995–1996 (Year 
10), 2000–2001 (Year 15), 2005–2006 (Year 20), and 2010–2011 (Year 25). A total of 3,173 
participants who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans in year 25 had 
complete data on VAT, SAT, and IMAT. Of those with complete VAT, SAT, and IMAT data, 
36 participants did not complete a sedentary behavior or physical activity questionnaire, and 
127 were missing data on study covariates, resulting in a final sample size of 3,010 for 
analyses of VAT, SAT, and IMAT. After the above exclusions, data on liver attenuation was 
available for 2,995 participants. Heavy alcohol consumption (>4 drinks per day for men and 
>3 drinks per day for women), but not moderate alcohol consumption (>2 drinks per day for 
men, >1 drink per day for women), was associated with lower liver attenuation. We therefore 
excluded an additional 78 participants who reported heavy alcohol consumption, resulting in 
a final sample of 2,917 for analyses of liver attenuation. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants at each exam, and the institutional review board at each of the 
clinical centers approved all study protocols.
Measures
Sedentary behavior was assessed with a self-reported questionnaire. Participants were asked 
how much time they spend sitting while engaging in six separate sedentary tasks: (1) 
watching television; (2) using the computer for non-work activities or playing video games; 
(3) doing non-computer office work or paperwork; (4) listening to music, reading a book or 
magazine, or doing arts and crafts; (5) talking on the phone or texting; and (6) sitting in a 
car, bus, train or other mode of transportation. Time spent in these sedentary tasks was 
queried separately for the average weekday and average weekend day. Response options 
were none, 15 minutes or less, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, or 6 
hours or more. Average sedentary hours per day for each of the six different tasks 
(television, computer, paperwork, music, phone, and car) was computed by multiplying the 
reported time spent in each activity on a weekday by five, and time spent in each activity on 
a weekend day by two, summing these two values to get average hours in each sedentary 
activity per week. The number of hours spent per week in each sedentary task, separately, 
was then divided by seven to get average sedentary hours per day. Total sedentary time per 
day was then calculated by summing the averages across the six different tasks.
Physical activity was assessed by self-report with the validated CARDIA Physical Activity 
History (8, 16, 17). Participants were asked to report the frequency of participation in 13 
different activities (eight vigorous, five moderate) related to recreational sports, exercise,

 leisure, and occupational activities. Vigorous activities included: jogging or running; racket 
sports; bicycling faster than 10 miles per hour; swimming; vigorous exercise classes; lifting, 
carrying, or digging while on the job; snow shoveling, moving heavy objects or weight 
lifting; and other strenuous sports (e.g. basketball). Moderate or more leisurely activities 
included: non-strenuous sports (e.g. softball); walks or hikes; bowling or golf; home exercise 
or calisthenics; and home maintenance or gardening. Total moderate and vigorous physical 
activity was calculated by multiplying the number of months the activity was performed by 
the intensity of the activity, weighting activities performed more frequently, and then 
summing across all activities. Details on frequency or duration of physical activity was not 
directly assessed; therefore physical activity is expressed in exercise units, with separate 
scores for moderate and heavy intensity activity, and for total physical activity. 
Approximately 300 exercise units are roughly equivalent to meeting physical activity 
recommendations, or 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity, 5 days per week (8). A 
validation study of the CARDIA Physical Activity questionnaire found that heavy physical 
activity was significantly associated with maximal oxygen consumption (r=0.63), 
accelerometer measured activity (r=0.31), and total 4-week activity history (r=0.54; all 
p<0.05) (16). Inverse associations have also been reported between total physical activity, 
assessed by the CARDIA physical activity history, and metabolic risk factors (5).
Abdominal adipose tissue depots were measured using CT scans, which were conducted at 
each of the CARDIA field centers at year 25. A non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen was 
performed with multidetector CT scanners (GE 750HD and GE LightSpeed VCT models 
were used at the Birmingham and Oakland Centers, respectively; GE Healthcare, Waukesha 
WI; Siemens Sensation 64 models were used at both Chicago and Minneapolis Centers; 
Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The images were electronically 
transmitted to a CT reading center for image analysis and quality control at Wake Forest 
University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC. CT scans of the abdomen were 
reconstructed into 5 mm slices with a maximum 50 cm field-of-view to include the whole 
abdomen. Adipose tissue depots were measured volumetrically from two adjoining five mm 
slices located at the level of the lumbar disk between the 4th and 5th vertebra (L3-L4 for 
IMAT, to avoid interference with a pelvic bone). Tissues with attenuation between -190 to 
-30 Hounsfield units were defined as adipose tissue. Analysts segmented the images based 
on anatomical boundaries into the entire abdomen, abdominal wall, and intra-abdominal 
compartments using the Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization application 
(http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/index.php). VAT, SAT, and IMAT were quantified in each 
compartment.
Liver attenuation, a diagnostic method to assess liver fat, was measured using non-contrast 
CT images of the upper abdomen while in axial scan mode. Averages of three distinct CT 
slices at the level of the T12-L1 intervertebral space were calculated to provide mean hepatic 
attenuation in Hounsfield Units (HU). Analysts were trained to avoid regions that included 
common hepatic lesions and hepatic vasculature. Liver attenuation is inversely related to 
liver fat content, such that lower levels of liver attenuation indicate higher levels of liver fat 
(10).

 Study covariates assessed at year 25 included age, sex, race, education (years completed), 
study center, smoking (never, former, current), alcohol consumption (ml/day), fast food 
intake (frequency/week), sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, including regular soda 
and sweetened fruit drinks, sports, or energy drinks (frequency/week), and body mass index 
(BMI, kg/m2). For anthropometric measures, participants were dressed in light clothing 
without shoes. Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.2 kg using a calibrated balance 
beam scale. Height was measured using a vertical rule to the nearest 0.5 cm. BMI was 
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
North Carolina). Distributions of variables were examined; all dependent variables were 
approximately normal with low skewness and kurtosis. Total sedentary behavior and total 
physical activity were categorized into tertiles for descriptive purposes. A linear trend over 
sedentary and physical activity tertiles was tested using linear regression or Chi-square test 
of independence, as appropriate. Differences by race and sex were tested using one-way 
ANOVA. Due to skewed distributions of independent variables (sedentary behaviors and 
physical activity), spearman correlation coefficients were used to examine bivariate 
associations between abdominal adiposity measures, sedentary behaviors, and physical 
activity.
The first set of multivariable general linear regression models regressed means of VAT, SAT, 
IMAT, and liver attenuation on total sedentary time, followed separately by task-specific 
sedentary time (i.e. television, computer, paperwork, music, phone, and car). Model 1 
adjusted for center, age, sex, race, education, smoking, alcohol, fast food intake and sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption. Model 2 additionally adjusted for total physical activity. 
Model 3 additionally adjusted for SAT in the models for VAT, IMAT, and liver attenuation. 
The betas for sedentary time in model 3 can be interpreted as the unique statistical effects of 
intra-abdominal fat depots, independent of any effects on total abdominal fat. The SAT 
models were adjusted for VAT. In model 4, we additionally adjusted for BMI (in addition to 
SAT or VAT) in order to further test for independence from effects of sedentary time on 
overall body size.
The second set of linear regression models regressed means of VAT, SAT, IMAT, and liver 
attenuation on total physical activity, followed separately by moderate and then heavy 
physical activity. The physical activity models followed the same pattern of adjustment as 
the sedentary behavior models; however, models 2–4 adjusted for total sedentary time, not 
total physical activity. All four models are displayed for total sedentary time. Because the 
addition of BMI beyond that of SAT or VAT did not appreciably alter study findings, only 
final models are included for task-specific sedentary time and physical activity. The beta 
regression coefficients for sedentary behaviors and physical activity models were 
standardized (e.g. 1 standard deviation [SD] total sedentary behavior = 4.0 hours/day, 1 SD 
television time = 1.5 hours/day, 1 SD total physical activity = 275 exercise units). As activity 
levels and abdominal fat vary significantly by race and sex, we also examined interactions 
with race and sex by including cross-product terms in the models. Interactions were

 statistically significant for race and sex categories (p<.05), therefore stratified results are 
reported. Given variation in the SD for sedentary behaviors and physical activity level by 
race/sex categories, the beta regression coefficients for the stratified models reflect the SD 
specific to each race/sex category.
Results
As seen in Table 1, an inverse linear trend over sedentary tertiles was observed for age, years 
of education, alcohol consumption, physical activity (total, moderate, and heavy), and liver 
attenuation (indicating a positive association between sedentary time and liver fat). A 
positive trend over sedentary tertiles was found for fast food and sugar-sweetened beverage 
consumption, BMI, VAT, SAT, and IMAT. Current smokers reported greater levels of 
sedentary time as compared to those who never smoked. An inverse linear trend over 
physical activity tertiles was observed for BMI, VAT, SAT, and IMAT, and a positive trend 
was found for liver attenuation (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, participant 
characteristics by tertiles of total physical activity).
Averages for total sedentary time, task-specific sedentary time, physical activity, and 
abdominal fat depots, stratified by sex and race are located in Table 2. Differences by sex 
and race were statistically significant (p<0.001) across all categories. Black participants 
reported more hours per day engaged in sedentary behaviors than Whites. Men reported 
higher levels of physical activity than women, with White men reporting the highest levels 
of activity and Black women reporting the lowest levels. Blacks had significantly lower VAT 
and IMAT, and greater SAT and liver attenuation than Whites. This difference by race in 
VAT and IMAT was driven by the large difference in abdominal fat depots among Black and 
White men, as the difference in VAT and IMAT among Black and White women was non-
significant. Overall, VAT and IMAT were higher in men than women, while SAT and liver 
attenuation were higher in women.
Total sedentary time and time spent watching television or using the computer were 
significantly associated with VAT, SAT, IMAT and liver attenuation in bivariate analyses 
(p<0.001; see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, spearman correlations and p-values 
between abdominal fat depots, sedentary behaviors, and physical activity). Total physical 
activity, moderate physical activity, and heavy physical activity were also significantly 
associated with VAT, SAT, and IMAT (p<0.001), but not liver attenuation. Importantly, 
correlations were weak between sedentary time and physical activity (ρ = −0.18 to 0.02), 
consistent with previous reports in the literature (12), indicating that these are unique 
independent behaviors.
Sedentary Behavior and Abdominal Adipose Depots
The associations of total sedentary time with abdominal adipose depots and liver attenuation 
are shown in Table 3. Total sedentary time was positively associated with VAT after 
adjustment for demographics and lifestyle factors (Models 1 and 2); however, this 
association was attenuated after adjustment for SAT (Model 3) and BMI (Model 4). When 
stratified by sex and race, the association between sedentary time and VAT was significant in 
White men only, and remained significant in all models. For a 1 SD increment in total

 sedentary time per day for White men (2.9 hours/day), VAT was greater by 6.0 cm3 
(p=0.007). A similar pattern was observed for IMAT and liver attenuation, with significant 
associations observed in White men only (β=5.9 cm3, p=0.010; β=−1.3, p=0.003, 
respectively). Total sedentary time was positively and significantly associated with SAT in 
the total sample after adjustment. After stratifying, the association remained significant in all 
groups with the exception of Black men.
When examining task-specific sedentary time (i.e. television, computer, paperwork, music, 
phone, and car) we observed strong associations between time spent watching television and 
abdominal adipose depots in the total sample after adjustment for all covariates (see Table 
4). No other task-specific sedentary behaviors were associated with abdominal adipose 
depots or liver attenuation (data not shown). Television viewing was significantly and 
positively associated with VAT, SAT, and IMAT after adjustment. No associations were 
observed between television viewing and liver attenuation in the total sample. After 
stratifying by sex and race, VAT, IMAT, and liver attenuation were significantly associated 
with television viewing in White men only. For each 1 SD increment spent watching 
television (1.2 hours/day), VAT increased by 4.8 cm3 (p=0.037), IMAT increased by 5.0 cm3 
(p=0.031), and liver attenuation decreased by 1.8 HU (p<0.001) in White men. Television 
viewing and SAT were significantly associated in White women only, fully adjusted (β=6.4 
cm3, p=0.016).
Physical Activity and Abdominal Adipose Depots
A robust inverse association was observed for total physical activity and VAT, SAT, and 
IMAT in the total sample after adjustment for all covariates (Table 5). For each 1 SD 
increment in physical activity (275 exercise units), VAT, SAT, and IMAT were lower by 7.6 
cm3, 6.7 cm3, and 8.1 cm3, respectively (p<.001 for all). This finding was consistent by race 
and sex, with the exception of the association between physical activity and SAT in Black 
women (β=−2.6, p=0.396). Physical activity was positively associated with liver attenuation 
after adjustment in the total sample. After stratifying, the association was significant in 
White men only (β=1.1, p=0.013). Results were similar when examining physical activity 
volume by intensity category (moderate and heavy) across race and sex groups (data not 
shown).
Sedentary Behavior, Physical Activity, and Abdominal Adipose Depots
Given that the association between total sedentary behavior and abdominal adipose depots 
appears to be driven by time spent watching television, we depict the adjusted means of 
abdominal fat depots and liver attenuation by tertiles of television viewing and total physical 
activity (low, moderate, and high) in Figure 1. Individuals reporting the lowest levels of 
television viewing and the highest levels of physical activity (referent group) had 
significantly lower VAT (118.4 cm3), SAT (316.6 cm3), IMAT (136.2 cm3) compared to all 
other groups, and higher liver attenuation (56.4 HU). Those reporting the highest levels of 
television viewing and lowest levels of physical activity had the highest average VAT (147.5 
cm3), IMAT (167.2), and lowest liver attenuation (54.2 HU). The Figure in Supplemental 
Digital Content 3 illustrates the adjusted means for VAT, SAT, IMAT, and liver attenuation 
by tertiles of total sedentary time and physical activity. Findings were similar across

 abdominal fat depots, with the referent group having the lowest average VAT, SAT, and 
IMAT and the highest average liver attenuation values.
Discussion
In this population-based cohort study, we found that sedentary time and physical activity 
were differentially associated with abdominal fat depots and liver attenuation. While 
significant associations between television viewing, physical activity, and fat depots were 
observed in the entire cohort, the relationship between total sedentary time and VAT, IMAT, 
and liver attenuation was significant in White men only after controlling for physical activity 
and other potential confounders. Our findings add to the existing literature by demonstrating 
independent associations between sedentary behavior, physical activity, and various 
measures of abdominal adiposity, in a large population of Black and White adult men and 
women. These findings indicate potential differences in the magnitude of the association 
between sedentary behaviors and abdominal fat deposition by sex and race.
Our findings are consistent with other, smaller studies that have also reported sex differences 
when examining the association between sedentary behaviors and abdominal fat deposition 
(13, 26, 31). For example, Henson and colleagues reported positive associations between 
accelerometer measured sedentary time and magnetic resonance imaging measured VAT and 
liver fat in a sample of 66 White men and women at risk for type 2 diabetes (13). In their 
study, sedentary time had a stronger association with VAT in men than in women, similar to 
our findings among Whites. In a cross-sectional sample of Chinese adults (N=398), 
significant associations were observed for men, but not women, in self-reported hours per 
day of television viewing and CT measured VAT and SAT (26). One other study to date has 
examined both sex and race differences in the associations of sedentary behaviors, physical 
activity and abdominal fat depots. A multi-ethnic analysis of 539 older adults found stronger 
associations between physical activity, but not sedentary behavior, and VAT and IMAT in 
White men as compared to White, African American, and Filipino women (20).
The stronger associations observed in White men in our study and others may be partly 
explained by the greater absolute amount and variation of VAT and IMAT in this sub-
population as compared to Black men or women of either race. Alternately, it is possible that 
White men have different behavioral patterns than other groups, which may explain the 
stronger association. There may also be differences in how sedentary behaviors are recalled 
or reported by race and sex. Although it is unclear why we observed differences by race and 
sex, there is a clear need to further explore this heterogeneity to avoid inappropriately 
generalization of findings.
Interestingly, when examining associations between different sedentary behaviors and fat 
deposition, significant findings were observed for television viewing only, and not for time 
spent engaging in other sedentary tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine 
the associations of various types of sedentary behavior with CT-measured abdominal fat 
depots. Hu and colleagues also reported stronger associations between television viewing 
and BMI as compared to time spent sitting at work, at home, or while driving in a sample of 
women from the Nurses’ Health Study (14). Television viewing may have a unique effect on

 fat deposition and health risks as a result of increased snacking behaviors (4). Other 
potential mechanisms explaining the association between television viewing and abdominal 
fat deposition may include reduced resting metabolic rate or the influence of food and 
beverage advertisements on food consumption (6). It is also possible that recall of television 
viewing may be more accurate than other sedentary behaviors since time can be more easily 
quantified within the context of 30 or 60 minute television programming.
We observed a robust association between physical activity and VAT, SAT, and IMAT. A 
weaker, but statistically significant association was observed for physical activity and liver 
attenuation. The relationships observed between physical activity and abdominal fat depots 
are consistent with many (20, 21, 24, 28), but not all studies in the literature (20, 22, 26). 
The associations between physical activity and fat depots did not differ when examining 
moderate and heavy intensity physical activity separately, indicating a potentially protective 
effect of physical activity on fat deposition at either intensity level. Furthermore, the 
association between physical activity and VAT was independent of both SAT and BMI, 
indicating that the relationship between physical activity and VAT cannot be fully explained 
by total adiposity.
Our findings make a novel contribution by examining the associations of sedentary 
behaviors and physical activity with IMAT and liver attenuation, two understudied 
abdominal fat depots that may be independent risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. A 
study by Yim and colleagues found stronger associations between IMAT and glucose, 
protein bound glucose, and total cholesterol than observed for VAT (33). Adverse 
associations have also been reported between liver fat and fasting glucose and triglycerides, 
independent of other fat depots (31). In our study, we found that among White men, total 
sedentary time and television viewing were adversely associated with IMAT and liver 
attenuation, while the opposite associations were observed for physical activity and these fat 
depots in the entire cohort. Only one other study to date has examined the associations of 
physical activity with abdominal IMAT (20). The authors also reported an inverse 
association between physical activity and IMAT; however, this was attenuated after 
adjustment for BMI. Our findings suggest that reducing sedentary time and increasing 
physical activity may result in lower levels of IMAT and liver fat, independent of total body 
adiposity, thus reducing cardiometabolic risk.
When we examined the combined association of television viewing and physical activity, we 
found that those reporting high levels of television viewing and low levels of physical 
activity had the highest levels of VAT, a strong risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases (2). 
While television viewing and physical activity were independently associated with 
abdominal fat deposition, it appears that their relationship may be additive. Those who 
reported high levels of television viewing and low levels of physical activity had a 29 cm3 
greater average VAT volume compared to those reporting low levels of television viewing 
and high levels of physical activity. This amount of VAT is equivalent to 39% of the 
population standard deviation of VAT. Of note, we found that television viewing and 
physical activity were jointly associated with VAT, independent of SAT and BMI. It 
therefore appears that the associations of inactivity and activity with VAT may act through 
an independent mechanism beyond total body adiposity. Thus, when making

 recommendations related to adipose deposition, it appears important to emphasize both 
reducing sedentary time, particularly television viewing, and increasing physical activity.
A major strength of this study is the large sample size which allows for comparisons by sex 
and race. Additionally, while sedentary behavior was self-reported, the questionnaire used in 
this study was more detailed than previous studies, allowing us to examine the associations 
of various types of sedentary behavior (e.g. television, computer) with intra-abdominal fat 
depots. Furthermore, we examined the associations of sedentary behavior and physical 
activity with multiple measures of adipose tissue, including IMAT and liver attenuation, 
which are understudied fat depots, and may play an independent role in cardiometabolic 
risk.
While this study contributes novel findings to the existing literature, multiple limitations 
must be noted. This study was limited to Black and White adults; therefore study findings 
cannot be generalizable to individuals from other racial/ethnic backgrounds. The cross-
sectional study design limits inference on causality between sedentary behavior, physical 
activity, and abdominal adipose depots. Future studies are needed that follow individuals 
over time to assess the longitudinal effects of sedentary behavior and physical activity on 
adipose depots. It is also possible that unmeasured variables may have confounded the 
observed associations. For example, we were not able to fully control for diet quality or 
snacking behaviors. However, we did assess fast food frequency and sugar-sweetened 
beverage consumption which are associated with unhealthy dietary patterns (25). Both 
sedentary behavior and physical activity were assessed through self-report, and sedentary 
time at work was not queried. It is therefore possible that subjects may have underreported 
their sedentary behavior and over-reported their physical activity. Finally, we estimated liver 
fat using CT-measured liver attenuation, which is a less direct measurement method than 
biopsy or magnetic resonance techniques.
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that sedentary behavior, particularly television 
viewing, and physical activity have distinct, independent associations with abdominal 
adipose tissue deposition patterns. Importantly, the associations of television viewing in the 
entire sample and total sedentary time in White men remained after controlling for physical 
activity, SAT, and BMI. These findings suggest that sedentary behavior, particularly 
television viewing, may have a unique, independent influence on intra-abdominal fat depots 
that is not explained by total adiposity or total physical activity level.

 Figure 1. Abdominal fat depots by tertiles of television viewing and physical activity at CARDIA 
year 25 (2010–2011)
Adjusted means for visceral adipose tissue (A), subcutaneous adipose tissue (B), 
intermuscular adipose tissue (C), and liver attenuation (D) by tertiles of television viewing 
and total physical activity. Means adjusted for center, age, sex, race, education, smoking, 
alcohol, fast food intake, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, BMI, subcutaneous 
adipose tissue (panels A, C, D), and visceral adipose tissue (panel B). In panels A–C, all 
groups have significantly greater adipose tissue than the referent group (low sedentary time, 
high physical activity). In panel D, groups denoted by the * have significantly lower liver 
attenuation (indicating more liver fat) than the referent group. Panel D excludes individuals 
categorized as heavy drinkers (>4 drinks/day for men and >3 drinks/day for women).

Model 1 adjusts for center, age, sex, race, education, smoking, alcohol, fast food frequency, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (stratified models do not adjust for sex or race)
Model 2 adjusts for all variables in Model 1, in addition to total physical activity
Model 3 adjusts for all variables in Model 2, in addition to subcutaneous fat (the subcutaneous fat model adjusts for visceral fat)
Model 4 adjusts for all variables in Model 3, in addition to BMI
aBeta regression coefficients are interpreted as the estimated difference in adipose depots (cm3) per 1 SD of total sedentary time (total sample = 4.0 hours/day; Black men = 4.5 hours/day; White men = 2.9 
hours/day; Black women = 4.7 hours/day; White women = 2.7 hours/day)
bAbdominal fat depots measured in cm3
cLiver attenuation models exclude individuals categorized as heavy drinkers (>4 drinks/day for men and >3 drinks/day for women)
dLiver attenuation measured in Hounsfield Units, lower values indicate higher liver fat content
