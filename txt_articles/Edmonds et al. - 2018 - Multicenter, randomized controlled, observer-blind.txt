ABSTRACT
The aim of this multicenter, prospective, observer-blinded, parallel group,
randomized controlled trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of EDX110, a
nitric oxide generating medical device, in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in
a patient group reflecting “real world” clinical practice compared against optimal
standard
care.
Participants
were
recruited
from
ten
hospital
sites
in
multidisciplinary foot ulcer clinics. The ulcers were full thickness, with an area
of 25–2,500 mm2 and either a palpable pedal pulse or ankle brachial pressure
index > 0.5. Infected ulcers were included. Treatment lasted 12 weeks, or until
healed, with a 12-week follow-up period. Both arms were given optimal
debridement, offloading and antimicrobial treatment, the only difference being
the fixed used of EDX110 as the wound dressing in the EDX110 group. 135
participants were recruited with 148 ulcers (EDX110—75; Control—73), 30% of
which were clinically infected at baseline. EDX110 achieved its primary
endpoint by attaining a median Percentage Area Reduction of 88.6% compared
to 46.9% for the control group (p 5 0.016) at 12 weeks in the intention-to-treat
population. There was no significant difference between wound size reduction
achieved by EDX110 after 4 weeks and the wound size reduction achieved in
the control group after 12 weeks. EDX110 was well tolerated. Thirty serious
adverse events were reported (12 in the EDX110 group, of which 4 were related
to the ulcer; 18 in the control group, of which 10 were related and 1 possibly
related to the ulcer), with significant reduction in serious adverse events related

 to the ulcer in EDX group. There was no significant difference in adverse
events. This study, in a real world clinical foot ulcer population, demonstrates
the ability of EDX110 to improve healing, as measured by significantly reducing
the ulcer area, compared to current best clinical practice.
Patients with diabetes have a lifetime incidence of up to
25% for developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).1 These
notoriously hard-to-heal ulcers are associated with poor
clinical outcomes and a long-term impact on morbidity,
mortality, and quality of life. DFUs account for almost
50% of diabetes-specific hospital admissions and precede
more than 80% of amputations in people with diabetes,2,3
the rate of which is 20 times that of people without diabe-
tes. The latest figures show that, for 2014–15, the annual
cost to the National Health Service in England for DFUs
was between US$1.31bn and $1.53bn.4
Prior to this study, the lack of an evidence base for
advanced wound dressings to manage DFUs was widely
acknowledged.5,6 Each of the available guidelines for the
treatment of DFU recommends debridement, pressure off-
loading, and an “appropriate” dressing,5,7 and it is com-
monly stated there is little difference in efficacy between
the many dressings in current use and a lack of robust
data.3,5–8 Of note, some RCTs, although useful in estab-
lishing efficacy under ideal circumstances for a variety of
wound-healing interventions, do not provide the necessary
information to establish effectiveness in the “usual” com-
promised wound center patient.9
The critical factors determining nonhealing status of
DFUs are ischemia and/or infection.10 Nitric oxide (NO)
plays a crucial role in maintaining the microvascular sup-
ply and infection control in the skin, and its absence in
diabetes is a compounding factor in poor ulcer healing.11,12
The role of NO in ulcer healing involves three recognized
elements: vascular, as NO influences blood vessel vasodi-
latation and stimulates angiogenesis;13,14 inflammatory, as
NO influences the host immune response;15 and antimicro-
bial as NO demonstrates potent, broad spectrum antimicro-
bial activity.16 EDX110 (Edixomed, London, UK) is a
two-layer
system
designed
to
generate
NO
in
situ.
EDX110 provides a moist wound environment, absorbs
exudate, triggers autolytic debridement and, when the two
layers are placed in contact and applied to the wound,
nitric oxide (NO) is generated as an ancillary function.
In addition, the antimicrobial action of EDX110 has
been assessed in the laboratory via the AATCC Test
Method 100, required by the FDA to claim antimicrobial
activity, where it demonstrated microbicidal action against
strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mold
and yeast.17 EDX110 has also demonstrated significant
activity against biofilms.18 EDX110 prevented biofilms
from forming and was bactericidal to established biofilms,
including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, to
multidrug resistant strains and polymicrobial biofilms.
The aim of this study, ProNOx1, was to assess the
safety and efficacy of EDX110, a Class III medical device,
compared to standard of care (SOC) dressings—the control
group—in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers with a wide
inclusion
criteria
to
reflect
the
population
in
which
EDX110 would inevitably be used if the study was
successful.
METHODS
Study design
The
ProNOx1
study
was
a
multicenter,
prospective,
observer-blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled
trial of a NO-generating wound treatment versus current
standard of care dressings in DFUs. Patients were recruited
at ten established expert multidisciplinary clinics for the
management of diabetic foot ulcers.
The study was approved by the National Research
Ethics Committee and the Medicines and Healthcare Prod-
ucts Regulatory Agency in the UK.
Participants were aged 18 or over, with type 1 or type 2
diabetes and a chronic, (present for at least 6 weeks) full-
thickness foot ulcer (on or below the malleoli) not pene-
trating to tendon, periosteum, or bone, and with a cross-
sectional area between 25 and 2,500 mm2. Participants
were required to have either a palpable pedal pulse, or an
ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) of > 0.5. Notably,
participants with ulcer infection were not excluded.
There was one relevant in-study substantial protocol
amendment: inclusion was amended to allow entry to partici-
pants with ulcers >14 days duration reduced from 6 weeks
to improve recruitment in February 2014. Duration of> 14
days was chosen as a reasonable indicator of the chronicity
of ulceration (8 ulcers of less than 4 weeks duration were
included in the EDX110 group and 6 in the control group).
Procedures
All participants received the normal DFU management
procedures for each study site, with debridement, infection
management including antibiotics when indicated, and off-
loading as clinically appropriate across both study arms.
Following randomization, dressings were first applied to
both study groups at the clinical centers. Participants were
shown how to change and apply new dressings and subse-
quently, for both groups, dressing changes were primarily
undertaken in the home.
The EDX110 group used the EDX110 2-layer, NO-
generating
wound
treatment.
The
primary
layer
of
EDX110 is a moist mesh which is placed centrally over
the ulcer. The secondary layer is then applied on top of
the mesh, positioned so there is a similar sized border sur-
rounding the primary layer, which retains the primary layer
in place, see Figure 1. Participants were directed to change
EDX110 every 48 hours.
The investigators were instructed to treat the control group
with whichever available dressing they considered best clini-
cal practice for their participants at that time. These partici-
pants were directed to change the dressing as specifically

 indicated for the dressing being used. The investigators
could alter the dressing type as clinically required, including
using antimicrobial dressings as appropriate.
The duration of treatment was 12 weeks, with clinical
visits weekly for the first four weeks, and every 2 weeks
thereafter. Between study visits, dressings were changed
either by participants, their carers or by community health-
care professionals. A follow-up visit occurred for partici-
pants either at 12 weeks posthealing, or at week 24,
whichever came first. Ulcer recurrence was recorded if a
“new” ulcer was present at the same site as the original.
At each clinical
visit, images of the ulcers were
recorded using the Silhouette system (Aranz Medical,
Christchurch, New Zealand). The Silhouette system is a
proven wound imaging, 3D measurement, and documenta-
tion system for clinical practice and clinical research
allowing accurate quantitative data collection.19
With the Silhouette system it is possible to:
1. calculate accurate wound surface area, depth, perimeter
and volume
2. combine imaging and measurement with assessment
information to generate comprehensive reports
3. immediately
store
wound
information
in
a
secure
environment
Critically, point 3 enabled every image of the study
ulcers to be assessed and measured remotely by one wound
care expert. This enabled completely blind assessment of
the ulcer progression and removed any subjectivity provid-
ing a completely unbiased measure of the outcome.
Outcomes
The co-primary outcomes were the efficacy of EDX110 as
assessed by the percentage ulcer area reduction from
baseline (PAR) compared with the control group and the
safety and tolerability of EDX110. PAR at 12 weeks was
the primary efficacy measure. The percentage of ulcers
healed at 12 weeks and ulcer recurrence were secondary
outcomes.
PAR was measured by the blinded assessor using the
Silhouette system.19 Final healing status was determined
by the center investigators, with healing defined as com-
plete epithelialization of the ulcer, without drainage, and
the blinded assessor confirmed complete epithelialization
using the Silhouette system. There were eight missing
healed ulcer images where only the PI reported the healed
ulcer. Infection was diagnosed by the investigator based
on the presence of two classical signs of infection, includ-
ing purulent discharge, erythema, pain, and swelling, as
per standard clinical practice.20
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs)
were defined in the study protocol and complied with
good clinical practice. Each event was classified by the
local principal investigator for relatedness to the index
ulcer and/or dressing.
For the EDX110 group only, tolerability (at change of
EDX110 and with EDX110 in situ) was recorded at each
visit. At change, a validated verbal rating score (VRS) was
used, ranging from 1 to 6, where 1 5 comfortable/pleasant
and 6 5 severe discomfort. For tolerability in situ, a visual
analog scale (VAS) ranging from 1 to 10, where 1 5 no
sensation and 10 5 severe discomfort, was utilized.
Statistical analysis
Following power calculations with an 80% power to detect
a 25–30% difference in healing between the 2 randomly
assigned groups with 1:1 distribution, with a 20% attrition
rate, based on a current standard of care healing rate of
25%,8,21 a study size of 60 participants in each arm was

 chosen. The test statistic used was the two-sided z test
with pooled variance and a target significance level of
0.05. PAR was the intended primary efficacy measure as it
can be measured by a blinded observer. It would have
been preferable to use PAR for the power calculation.
However, the most robust data available for standard of
care from Jeffcoate et al in 2009,8 only reported complete
healing and this was used for the power calculation.
The study was open-label, and treatment allocation fol-
lowed a computer generated, center-stratified randomiza-
tion list in blocks of four–the centers were unaware of the
randomization strategy. Participants were randomized 1:1
to the EDX110 group or the control group and assigned to
their respective groups by the principal investigator at
each center. The Silhouette Wound Imaging System was
used to capture images of the ulcer, from which an
observer blinded assessment was conducted of all images
by an independent wound care expert.
For the efficacy endpoint, unadjusted analysis of PAR
differences
between
the
groups was
conducted
using
Mann-Whitney U tests to account for nonnormal distribu-
tion of PAR. The rates of complete healing were compared
using chi-square tests. A post hoc linear mixed effect
model was also used to investigate the effects of different
variables as random factors including clustering at the par-
ticipant level, clustering at the site level, and ulcer area,
ulcer age and infection status at randomization as fixed
effects. The dependent variable was PAR at 12 weeks and
4 weeks. Separate models were conducted for outcomes at
4 and 12 weeks.
Data were analyzed by intention-to-treat (ITT) popula-
tion, and per protocol (PP) population. Safety included
analysis of all adverse outcomes in all participants and
ulcers. The ITT population comprised all ulcers which
received at least one treatment. Participants were excluded
from the PP population if they withdrew consent or were
withdrawn by the principal investigator or were withdrawn
due to an unrelated AE/SAE, or experienced a serious pro-
tocol deviation unless they completed at least 10 weeks of
treatment. Any participant with a healed ulcer or with-
drawn for an ulcer-related AE/SAE remained in the PP
population as these were critical outcomes.
An independent statistical group conducted analysis.
Hypothesis testing was performed for selected primary and
secondary endpoints. Unless specified, all statistical testing
was two-sided and performed using a significance (alpha)
level of 0.05. For continuous variables with approximately
normal distribution, means and standard deviations (SD)
were the preferred reporting metric while for nonnormal
variables, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were the
preferred reporting metric, particularly PAR due to its non
normal distribution, but means and SDs are also included
for completeness in the case of ulcer age, ulcer area and
PAR. Missing data were imputed for the ITT population
using the last observation carried forward principle.
An explorative analysis compared the full ITT results to
a cohort where only the first randomized ulcer was
included for analysis if a participant’s second or subse-
quent randomized ulcer was being treated within the same
cohort.
An adjustment for multiplicity of statistical testing was
made using a complex gatekeeping strategy for the ITT
analysis and the step-up Hochberg procedure for the PP
analysis for all reported p-values, with the reported p-val-
ues being the adjusted values, except where otherwise
explicitly stated.22
For the safety and tolerability endpoints, AEs and SAEs
were analyzed using a chi-square test.
RESULTS
Study demographics
From October 2013, to July 2015, 217 ulcers were
screened of which 147 were randomized (Figure 2). Sev-
enty participants were excluded for either not meeting the
ulcer inclusion criteria (n 5 45) or declining to participate
(n 5 15), or other reasons (n 5 10).
Three participants received no treatment post randomi-
zation, having withdrawn between consent and baseline
and were removed from the ITT population.
There were 135 participants receiving treatment in the
study and 123 of these were randomized with one ulcer
only. Three participants also had an ulcer on their contra-
lateral foot and were reentered into the study at a later
date. One participant had two ulcers on the same foot
treated with separate dressings. In four participants with
simultaneous ulcers on both feet, the ulcer on the right
was first randomized and then the ulcer on the left was
automatically assigned to the other study group. In all the
above cases, separate identification codes and CRFs were
assigned to each DFU.
In addition, four participants were included with two
ulcers treated under the same dressing labelled as ulcer A
and B in the same CRF. In one of these cases the partici-
pant was reentered into the study at a later date with an
ulcer on the contralateral foot, resulting in this participant
having three ulcers in the study being documented in two
separate CRFs.
In all, 63 participants with 71 ulcers were treated with
EDX110 only, 68 participants with 69 ulcers were treated
only with standard of care dressings and 4 participants had
8 bilateral ulcers, one of which was treated with EDX110
and the other treated with standard of care dressings.
In summary, 123 participants had one ulcer, 11/135 par-
ticipants each had two ulcers in the study, 1/135 partici-
pants had three ulcers in the study. There was a total of
144 CRFs (EDX110-72; control-72) reporting 148 ulcers
(EDX110-75; control-73) in the study. As all 148 ulcers
received at least one treatment during the study, they were
all included in the ITT population and safety analyses.
The PP population comprised 114 participants with a
total of 124 ulcers—61 EDX110; 63 control (Figure 2).
There were no significant differences between the study
groups with each having an expected higher proportion of
male to female participants (Table 1). In the EDX110
group, 89% of ulcers and in the control group, 92% of
ulcers had been present for at least one month. Thirty-
eight different participant comorbidities were recorded,
with
no
significant
differences
between
the
groups
although of note, there were 17 (23%) prior amputations in
the EDX110 group, (6 major, 11 minor) and 10 (14%) in
the control group, (4 major, 6 minor).

 Efficacy analysis
There was a significant improvement in the median PAR at
12 weeks in the EDX110 group compared to control in
both the ITT (p 5 0.016) and PP (p 5 0.012) populations
(Table 2). The progression of median PAR is shown in
Figure 3, indicating no significant difference in the PAR
achieved by EDX110 in 4 weeks compared to that achieved
by control in 12 weeks. There was also a significant
improvement (p 5 0.036) in the median PAR at 4 weeks in
the EDX110 compared to control in the PP population
(Table 2). A post hoc linear mixed model analysis of the
full, 148 wound ITT population at 4 weeks indicated a sig-
nificant difference in mean PAR between groups of 17.3 in
favor of EDX110 (p 5 0.031) and, importantly, showed that
no other fixed effect variables or random effect variables
generated a significant difference in outcome in the model.
In the ITT analysis, the proportion of ulcers healed at
12 weeks with EDX110 was 30/75 (40%) and in the
control group was 19/73 (26%) (p 5 0.07). However,
following a strict definition of ITT, including the 3
patients randomized but not treated, to give a control pop-
ulation of 76, the difference in complete healing is signifi-
cant, p 5 0.049. The complete healed rate at 12 weeks in
the PP analysis was significant, with 49% for the EDX110
group (30/61) compared to 30% for the control group (19/
63) (p 5 0.04).
The percentage of DFUs demonstrating � 50% ulcer
area reduction at 4 weeks in the ITT population, an impor-
tant measure for clinicians,23,24 showed a significant differ-
ence in favor of EDX110 (53% vs. 36%; p 5 0.03).
The median PAR at 12 weeks for DFUs present for � 6
months, was significantly greater for EDX110 (n 5 51;
PAR 5 97%) compared with the control group (n 5 44;
PAR 5 55%)
(p 5 0.04).
For
those
ulcers
present
for
greater than 6 months there was no significant difference
between the groups. (Table 2)

 The
median
PAR
at
12
weeks
for
DFUs
that
were � 1 cm2 at baseline, was significantly greater for
EDX110 (n 5 32; PAR 5 82%) compared with the control
group
(n 5 32;
PAR 5 29%)
(p 5 0.007).
For
those
ulcers < 1 cm2 at baseline, there was no significant differ-
ence between the groups. (Table 2)
The percentage of healed ulcers in the EDX110 group
for those ulcers classified as infected at baseline was 45%
(9/20) compared to 23% (5/22) in the control group
(p 5 0.20). In those ulcers classified as noninfected at
baseline, EDX110 achieved complete healing of 38%
(21/55) vs. 27% (14/51) in the control group (p 5 0.24).
The explorative analysis, including only a participant’s
first randomized ulcer if their second or subsequent ulcer
was treated with the same dressing, showed negligible
difference from the ITT population. The mean PAR for
EDX110 and control group remained the same as the ITT
population at 59% and 37%, respectively. The complete
healing rate also remained the same as for the full ITT
ulcer population, EDX110—40% vs. control group—26%.
Ulcer recurrence at 12 weeks post healing was 1/23
(4%) in EDX110 and 4/16 (25%) in the control group,
which did not reach statistical significance.
Safety analysis
Thirty SAEs were recorded (EDX110—12 SAEs in 12 par-
ticipants; control group—18 SAEs in 15 participants) of
which 14 were considered related and one possibly related
to the study ulcer, (EDX110—4; control group—11) but
no SAE was reported as related to EDX110 or the SOC
dressings. The fewer occurrences of SAEs related or possi-
bly related to the ulcer in the EDX group compared with
the SOC group was significant (p 5 0.049). There was no
significant difference in the overall number of SAEs
between the EDX110 and control groups. The SAEs
included two major amputations, and one death in hospital
from septicemia and pneumonia following osteomyelitis of
the index ulcer, all in the SOC group.
There was no significant difference in AE occurrence
between the study groups (EDX110—49 AEs in 32 partici-
pants; control group—54 AEs in 34 participants). The
most
common
AE
was
foot
infection:
EDX110—17
(35%); control group: 19 (35%). Among the foot infections
in the EDX110 group reported as AEs, 12 were related to
the index ulcer, four (33%) of which became serious
adverse events. In the control group, 14 foot infections
reported as AEs were related to the index ulcer, 9 (64%)
of which became serious adverse events.
EDX110 was well tolerated with a mean score of 1.7
(SD: 0.73) on a VRS at dressing change and 1.6 (SD:
1.01) on a VAS when in situ.
The
median
number
of
dressing
changes
for
the
EDX110 group per week was 3.5; (IQR: 1.8), as per
instructions. The median number of dressing changes for
the control group per week was 1.6; (IQR: 1.3).
Nine different types of dressing were recorded in the
control
group—absorbent
pad,
alginate,
anti-microbial,
foam, gauze, gel fiber, hydro-colloid, hydrofiber or hydro-
gel and 32% of the dressings used were classified as anti-
microbial,
namely
iodine,
honey,
polyhexamethylene
biguanide (PHMB) or hydrophobic (Sorbact).

 No clinically meaningful difference was seen in offload-
ing between the 2 arms; 58% of patients received offload-
ing in each group and this corresponds with the plantar
location of 63% of ulcers in the EDX group and 60% in
the control group.
DISCUSSION
This multicenter, prospective, observer blinded, random-
ized controlled trial has shown that treatment of diabetic
foot ulcers with EDX110 was safe and well tolerated. Fur-
thermore, the PAR at 12 weeks was significantly improved
in the EDX110 group compared with the control group.
The percentage of DFUs demonstrating >50% PAR at 4
weeks additionally showed a significant difference in favor
of EDX110. The rate of complete healing improved signif-
icantly in 12 weeks with EDX110 in the PP population
and also in the ITT population, if the strictest definition of
ITT had been followed. The ulcers treated with EDX110
were associated with a significantly smaller number of
SAEs which were related or possibly related to the study
ulcer compared to those treated with SOC dressings.
(p 5 0.049)
Thus, there may be a significant clinical benefit gained
using EDX110 in a therapy area where recent overviews
concluded that currently there is no robust evidence that
any advanced dressing type is more effective than basic
wound contact dressings.5,6,25
In the Eurodiale prospective study on determinants of
outcome in diabetic foot disease, the combination of infec-
tion with ischemia had a major negative impact on healing
rates of DFUs.10 In this present real-life study, which
allowed entry to participants with clinically infected ulcers
and/or an ABPI as low as 0.5, the greater reduction in
ulcer area may be attributed to the ability of EDX110 to
generate a sustained release of NO that overcomes the
issue of infection and ischemia. In many chronic ulcers,
and especially in patients with diabetes, the generation of
NO is lost or impaired.26 Previous development of a func-
tional NO wound treatment has been complicated by the
very short half-life of the gas. EDX110 has overcome this
issue with a sustained release of NO. This prolonged
action of NO may be a major factor in the improved heal-
ing rate and makes EDX110 applicable to any chronic
ulcer situation where ischemia and infection are factors in
delayed
healing.
In
the
infected
ulcers
treated
with
EDX110, there was a doubling of complete healing com-
pared to those treated with standard of care dressings.
However, the number of infected ulcers was small and the
number that healed approached, but did not reach, signifi-
cance. Nevertheless, there are strong in vitro data to sup-
port the antimicrobial activity of NO as the skin’s “natural
antibiotic,”16 and EDX110 appears to be a useful treatment
for infected ulcers.
The beneficial effect of EDX110 was particularly useful
in the subgroup of ulcers � 1 cm2 at baseline and in the
subgroup of ulcers of � 6 months duration relative to the
control group. Furthermore, within the EDX110 group
itself, there was also a significant improvement in PAR of
ulcers of � 6 months duration compared to that of ulcers
of > 6 months duration. This was not seen in the control
group. Modern diabetic foot care encourages early presen-
tation to specialist care, in keeping with advice and
findings from the UK National Diabetic Foot Audit.27
Such a policy would facilitate the optimum healing effect
of EDX110 when applied to ulcers of short duration.
This study may be seen to have certain limitations.
Reduction in ulcer size was used as the primary outcome
as opposed to the commonly utilized outcome of complete
healing. Reduction in ulcer size was used for two scientifi-
cally legitimate reasons. Firstly, complete healing mea-
sured by the investigator is both subjective and nonblind,
opening the outcome to bias. The use of an accurate, quan-
titative and reproducible measuring system allowed a
nonsubjective, nonbiased measure of percentage reduction
in ulcer size to be the primary outcome. Secondly, PAR is
a clinically relevant outcome as it reflects the “healing”
effect of standard of care dressings or EDX110 on the
whole group and accounts for ulcers that are improving,
static or, importantly, increasing in size, as well as those
that heal. Therefore, an observer blinded outcome was the
strongest alternative to remove bias and subjectivity. Also,
the ProNOx1 study included all-comers and, therefore,
contained a small number of participants with multiple
ulcers which may be perceived as a limitation in that the
inclusion of these participants may detract from the purity
of the statistical analysis. However, a mixed model analy-
sis, assessing the impact of variables, including the pres-
ence of multiple ulcers, showed that the only factor that
significantly affected outcome was treatment arm and a
direct comparison of the results showed that the inclusion
of multiple ulcers had negligible effect.
A further possible limitation of the study was the choice
of a nonstandardized dressing protocol in the control group
with inevitable lack of blinding. There is no evidence that
any specific dressing is superior in clinical practice and
thus, investigators were allowed their optimal choice
dependent on the ulcer condition at each visit. This was
arguably a much tougher comparator for EDX110. True
blinding would have required the use of a placebo dress-
ing, which would not have offered optimal treatment to
the control group. At best this would have been judged an
unfair advantage for EDX110, at worst it would be unethi-
cal treatment of the participants. A further limitation with
respect to dressings was that the mean number of dressing
changes was greater in the EDX110 group. While this
might be perceived as an advantage for EDX110, there is
no evidence to suggest more frequent dressing changes
improve healing, or it would be standard practice to
change all dressings more frequently.
In the past decade, there has been growing concern that
the results from many RCTs cannot be generalized to the
wound care population.9 However, in the present trial, a
“real world” wound care population was studied, including
participants with moderate ischemia and ulcers compli-
cated by infection, and EDX110 still met its primary
endpoint and showed substantial promise. It was well tol-
erated, with significantly smaller numbers of SAEs which
were related or possibly related to the study ulcer com-
pared to those treated with SOC dressings. It also signifi-
cantly improved the reduction of ulcer area compared with
SOC dressings, notably in those with a duration of less
than six months.
The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT01982565.
