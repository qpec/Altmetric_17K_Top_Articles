Abstract  
Emerging evidence suggests beneficial effects of sauna bathing on the cardiovascular 
system. However, the effects of sauna bathing on parameters of cardiovascular function and 
blood-based biomarkers are uncertain. We aimed to investigate whether sauna bathing 
induces changes in arterial stiffness, blood pressure (BP) and several blood-based 
biomarkers. We conducted an experimental study including 102 participants (mean age 
(SD): 51.9 (9.2) years, 56 % male) who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. 
Participants were exposed to a single sauna session (duration: 30 minutes; temperature: 
73°C; humidity: 10-20%) and data on cardiovascular as well as blood-based parameters 
were collected before, immediately after and after 30-minutes recovery. Mean carotid-
femoral pulse wave velocity was 9.8 (2.4) m/s before sauna and decreased to 8.6 (1.6) m/s 
immediately after sauna (p<0.0001). Mean systolic BP decreased after sauna exposure from 
137 (16) to 130 (14) mmHg (p<0.0001) and diastolic BP from 82 (10) to 75 (9) mmHg 
(p<0.0001). Systolic BP after 30 minutes’ recovery remained lower compared to pre-sauna 
levels. There were significant changes in hematological variables during sauna bathing. 
Plasma creatinine levels increased slightly from sauna until recovery period, whereas 
sodium and potassium levels remained constant. This study demonstrates that sauna 
bathing for 30 minutes has beneficial effects on arterial stiffness, BP, and some blood-based 
biomarkers. These findings may provide new insights underlying the emerging associations 
between sauna bathing and reduced risk of cardiovascular outcomes.

Introduction 
Sauna bathing, a form of passive heat therapy, is commonly used for relaxation and 
pleasure purposes1,2. Repeated sauna therapy has been shown to increase left ventricular 
ejection fraction and reduce plasma levels of norepinephrine and brain natriuretic peptide 
and increase the 6-minute walk distance3. After one week of repeated sauna exposure 
(twice a day) in 10 healthy male volunteers, diastolic blood pressure (BP) was shown to 
decrease substantially4. Warm water immersion, which is also a form of passive heat 
therapy, is also associated with health benefits which include improved endothelial and 
microvascular function as well as reduced arterial stiffness (AS) and blood pressure5,6. 
Passive heat therapy (hot tub) improves cutaneous microvascular function by enhancing 
nitric oxide-dependent dilation in sedentary humans5. It has also been demonstrated that 
sauna exposure results in elevations in core temperature and changes in cardiovascular 
haemodynamics, such as cardiac output and vascular shear stress, which are similar to the 
effects of exercise, and thus may provide an alternative means of improving health6. In a two 
week trial of once-a-day infrared-sauna exposure for patients with cardiovascular risk 
factors, flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation was significantly improved7. 
However, there is still lack of evidence showing the positive effects of typical Finnish sauna 
bathing on cardiovascular function, which might potentially reduce cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk. Sauna exposure may improve vascular compliance, which has previously been 
demonstrated in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors, indicating a protective role of heat 
therapy on arterial stiffening7. However, although sauna bathing is well tolerated, there is 
evidence that sauna use might induce myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery 
disease.8 Consistent with the positive effects of passive heat therapy, there is some 
evidence showing that blood pressure may be decreased as a result of increased ambient 
temperature9-11. Using a long-term general population-based prospective study, our group 
has recently shown that frequent Finnish sauna exposure has multiple beneficial effects, 
which include reduced risk of hypertension, dementia, fatal cardiovascular outcomes, and 
all-cause mortality12-14.  
 5 
 
Sauna bathing leads to certain changes in the cardiovascular system such as vasodilation of 
circulatory system, blood re-distribution and increase in sweating in an attempt to maintain 
body homeostasis due to heat stress. The acute physiological responses to the hot 
temperatures during sauna-bathing induce fluid loss with an increase in heart rate15,16. Some 
previous studies have shown an association between passive heat therapy and augmented 
cardiovascular function, with positive adaptations in arterial compliance and peripheral 
microvascular function5,17-20. 
The aim of this study was to investigate acute hemodynamic and physiological vascular 
responses and their respective recovery profiles 30 minutes after sauna bathing. This study 
setting will further clarify if sauna bathing leads to beneficial effects on cardiovascular 
function, including changes in blood pressure and AS as well as blood biomarkers among 
participants with cardiovascular risk factors.  The main focus of this study is to evaluate the 
most immediate physiological and cardiovascular effects of a single Finnish sauna exposure 
in a large sample of both men and women in an experimental setting to confirm its protective 
effects on cardiovascular health and safety. 
 
Methods 
Participants 
Participants (n=102) were recruited from the city of Jyväskylä, Central Finland region, 
through the local out-of-hospital health care center. The final study group consisted of 
asymptomatic participants (no cardiovascular symptoms) with at least one conventional risk 
factor, such as a history of smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity or family history of 
CHD/CVD. Hypertension was defined as SBP > 140mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 
90mmHg, or use of antihypertensive therapy. Dyslipidaemia was defined as the use of 
cholesterol drugs or serum LDL cholesterol over 3.5 mmol/L and obesity as body mass index 
(BMI) over 30kg/m2.   
Participants with diagnosed CVD were not included in the study. Prior to the participation of 
the study, all participants were informed about the research purposes and measurement 
 6 
 
procedures, and were screened by a cardiac specialist. The research protocol and study 
design were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the Central Finland 
Hospital District ethical committee, Jyväskylä, Finland (Dnro 5U/2016). All study participants 
provided written informed consent. 
 
Clinical examination 
A clinical evaluation with baseline data collection was conducted on a separate screening 
day prior to the experiment. During the screening visit, medical history, physical examination, 
and resting electrocardiogram (ECG) were assessed. All baseline and sauna exposure 
measurements were performed from May to June 2016. Resting blood pressure was 
measured on the screening day as well as on the day of sauna exposure, using the same 
standard operating protocol; it was recorded as the mean of two measurements obtained 
while the participant was in supine with a standardized measurement protocol. Body mass 
index was calculated by dividing measured weight in kilograms by the square of height in 
meters. Assessment of baseline characteristics and diseases were based on a self-reported 
questionnaire21 which was checked by a cardiologist during the screening visit. The regular 
use of medication was assessed by a detailed questionnaire. All questionnaires have been 
previously validated in a Finnish population-based cohort study.22,23  
 
Assessment of self-reported physical activity and sauna bathing habits 
Physical activity was assessed using the baseline questionnaire and classified as endurance 
training, resistance training or any leisure-time physical activity. Assessment of duration and 
frequency of physical activity was based on a self-reported questionnaire23. Previous regular 
sauna bathing habits were assessed by the questionnaires and the information collected 
was based on frequency (weekly sauna sessions), duration of sauna exposure and 
temperature in the sauna room. The questionnaires were checked at the time of baseline 
data collection. 
 7 
 
 
Sauna exposure  
Sauna exposure was based on a traditional Finnish sauna, which is characterized by air with 
a relative humidity of 10-20% and high temperature12. Sauna exposure was a typical Finnish 
sauna bathing session; the total duration was 30 minutes, and it was interspersed at 15 
minutes with a short, two-minute warm shower. There were separate sauna rooms for 
women and men; the sauna rooms were similar in the terms of space, humidity, temperature 
and air conditioning. The sauna temperature was controlled and monitored by internal 
temperature sensors designed by Harvia Oy, Finland. The temperature was measured 
continuously by using a 2-channel thermometer in the sauna room and the respective data 
was collected during experiment. Data obtained via the temperature tracking device showed 
that the mean temperature was 73 (standard deviation, SD 2) °C with a relative humidity of 
10-20 %.  
Participants were supervised by a physician and were allowed to leave the sauna at any 
time they felt uncomfortable. All participants underwent the recommended sauna protocol 
successfully. To make up for fluid loss due to increased sweating, participants were given 
500ml of room temperature still water for drinking during the entire sauna session, including 
the recovery period after sauna. Immediately after sauna exposure, participants were 
instructed to rest in a designated relaxing waiting lounge (mean temperature 21 °C) for 30 
minutes´ recovery. Body temperature was measured for each participant by the tympanic 
method. 
 
Exercise testing 
A maximal exercise test was conducted on a cycle ergometer utilizing a graded exercise test 
protocol with ECG to assess the level of aerobic exercise capacity. The exercise test with 
continuous ECG (CardioSoft software V.1.84, GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) 
recordings was performed at baseline between using an electrically braked cycle ergometer 
(Monark Exercise AB, Sweden). The symptom-limited exercise test was started with 3 
 8 
 
minutes’ warm-up without workload for each participant and continued with 20 Watts (W) 
increments applied every 1 min until volitional exhaustion. Exercise capacity was expressed 
in metabolic equivalents (METs) and maximal exercise workload (W). All exercise tests were 
supervised by an experienced physician with the assistance of a trained nurse and were not 
performed on the same day of sauna session.  
 
Arterial stiffness  
The measurement of AS followed established guidelines24,25 with written and verbal 
instructions given to all participants informing them to avoid meals, caffeine and smoking 
within 3 hours of the measurement. All measurements were taken on the right side of the 
body in the supine position in a quiet room with a stable temperature (21 °C). All AS related 
measurements before, after and at 30 minutes’ recovery from sauna were taken by a single 
trained tonometer operator and the same transit distances measured during baseline clinical 
evaluation were used throughout the experiment for consistency and reliability. Supine 
brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressures were obtained using Microlife BP A200 
(Microlife Corp., Taipei, Taiwan) 26. Two sequential readings were measured and the mean 
values were used. Pulse pressure was calculated as the difference between SBP and DBP. 
Participants rested in the supine position for 10 minutes before AS was measured at 
baseline and due to the nature of the study on acute effects of sauna, AS was measured 
immediately after and after 30 minutes of recovery from sauna following blood pressure 
measurements. Heart rate was recorded with the assessment of AS. 
Pulse wave velocity (PWV) data was collected by the software at a sample rate of 1000 Hz 
(PulsePen, DiaTecne s.r.l., Milan, Italy). PWV was defined as the distance between the 
measuring sites divided by the time delay between the distal pulse wave from the proximal 
pulse wave, using the ECG trace as reference 27. The software is able to define 
augmentation index in relation to the level and early rise time of the reflected wave with other 
indexes of arterial stiffness. Augmentation index is a parameter which provides an indication 
of the contribution of reflected waves to the total pulse pressure and was defined as the 
difference between the second and first systolic peak on arterial pulse waveform and was 
 9 
 
expressed as a percentage of central pulse pressure. Arterial tonometry with simultaneous 
ECG was obtained from carotid and femoral arteries with the use of a commercially available 
tonometer that has been well validated previously 25,27,28. Transit distances were assessed 
by body surface measurements using a tape measure from the suprasternal notch to each 
pulse recording site (carotid and femoral). Direct carotid to femoral measurement was 
adjusted to 80% (common carotid artery – common femoral artery x 0.8) for the calculation 
of PWV as recommended by current guidelines25. Left ventricular ejection time (LVET), 
diastolic time (DT), and augmentation index were obtained from the carotid pressure 
waveform analysis. This measurement relies on the R-R interval on an ECG. The point 
corresponding to the end of LVET and the beginning of DT is identified by the dicrotic notch 
in the carotid pulse waveform. This point is automatically estimated by the PulsePen 
software.29 
 
Laboratory analyses 
Venous blood samples for the determination of plasma total cholesterol, high density 
lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), Apolipoprotein B 
(Apo B), triglycerides (TG) and plasma glucose concentrations were collected by a qualified 
laboratory technician from the antecubital vein, into serum and plasma tubes (BD 
Vacutainer, Plymouth. UK). Participants were instructed to abstain from strenuous physical 
activity 24h before the blood samples were taken. Whole blood samples were stored for 10 
min before being centrifuged at 3500 rpm (Megafuge, Heraeus, Germany) and serum and 
plasma samples stored at -80°C until analysis using a spectrophotometry analyzer (Konelab 
20XTi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vantaa, Finland). Basic hematological parameters 
(hemoglobin concentration, leucocytes and thrombocytes count) were analyzed on site by 
Sysmex KX 21 (Sysmex Co., Kobe, Japan) analyzer. Venous blood samples for the 
determination of plasma biomarkers were analyzed using chemiluminecent immunoassay by 
Siemens Immulite 2000 XPi analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products Ltd., 
Llanberies, UK). Serum sodium and potassium were measured using Gem Premier 3000 (IL 
laboratories, Barcelona, Spain) and were assessed before and after sauna.

Statistical analyses 
Data are presented as means ± (SDs) or median [interquartile range, IQR] for continuous 
variables based on their distribution and as proportions for categorical variables. Normality 
was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test as well as through observing the Q-Q-plots. 
Absolute values (means) of physiological, AS and laboratory variables before and after 
sauna were firstly analyzed for any within-group (time) changes with an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) test. Normally distributed and log-transformed non-normally distributed data were 
further analyzed for within-group changes with a paired t-test to compare immediately after 
sauna values and post 30 min sauna values to pre-sauna values. Supplementary analyses 
were performed to analyze respective relative changes in physiological, cardiovascular and 
laboratory variables. The level for significance was set at p<0.05. All statistical analyses 
were carried out with Stata version 14.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, U.S.). 
 
Results 
Characteristics of population 
Overall, there were 56 male and 46 female participants; their characteristics are shown in 
Table 1. The mean age was 51.9 (SD 9.2) years and BMI of overall participants was 27.2 
[IQR: 24.5-30.7 kg/m2]. The proportion of current smokers was 14.4 % and the mean resting 
SBP and DBP were 136 (16) and 84 (10) mmHg, respectively. Biochemical parameters were 
slightly different between males and females and are reported in Table 1. 
Underlying clinical conditions or cardiovascular risk factors of participants included 
hypertension (14.3%), dyslipidaemia (63.0%), type 1 diabetes (2.0%), type 2 diabetes 
(1.0%), respiratory diseases (5.1%), thyroid disease (3.1%), skin disease (4.0%) and 
rheumatoid arthritis (1.0%). Family history of CHD was a common risk factor (34.0%) in this 
study population (Table 1).  
Cardiorespiratory fitness level as assessed by median exercise capacity was 8.8 METs [7.8-
10.4], being 9.7 [8.5-10.9] and 8.3 [6.7-9.3] in males and female participants, respectively. 
 11 
 
Most of participants achieved age-adjusted target maximal heart rate level during exercise 
test. The highest mean SBP during exercise test was 213 (24) mmHg for men and 196 (24) 
mmHg for women, while exercise-induced ST-segment changes of over 1 mm, indicating 
minor ischemic changes, were not common (6.5%). Detailed exercise testing results are 
shown in Table 1. 
Participants bathed in their own sauna from 1 to 4 times per week based on the baseline 
questionnaires (Table 1). Most participants preferred to use sauna 3 times per week 
(43.9%), whereas 16.3% of participants used sauna 1 or 2 times per week respectively. A 
sauna session lasted between 20-40 minutes for most participants (56.7%) and the average 
self-reported temperature was 72°C.  
Reported frequency of total leisure-time physical activity was distributed as follows: the 
proportion of those with 1 physical activity session per week was 25.8%, 1-3 sessions was 
32.3%, 3-5 sessions was 30.6%, and >5 sessions was 9.7%. The distributions of duration of 
total physical activity in groups of <20 min, 20-39 min, 40-60 min and >60 min per a single 
session are reported in Table 1.  
 
Sauna and body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure  
There were statistically significant effects of sauna heat exposure on body temperature, 
heart rate and blood pressure values. The directions of change in parameters evaluated 
were similar in both genders (Table 2 and Figure 1). Body temperature, heart rate and 
blood pressure changed immediately after sauna and at 30 minutes’ recovery from sauna 
bathing. Mean body temperature was 36.4°C before sauna, 38.4°C immediately after sauna 
and 36.6°C at the end of recovery period (Table 2 and Figure 1). SBP was 137 (16) mmHg 
before sauna, 130 (14) mmHg immediately after sauna, and 130 (14) mmHg after 30 
minutes’ recovery. The corresponding values for DBP were 82 (10), 75 (9), and 81 (9) 
mmHg (Table 2). The respective heart rate values at the time of blood pressure and AS 
measurements were 64 [59-70], 79 [70-90], and 65 [59-71] beats per minute. 
 12 
 
The mean relative changes in SBP and DBP were -4.3% (p<0.0001) and -8.7% (p<0.0001), 
respectively, comparing post-sauna to pre-sauna blood pressure. Blood pressure remained 
lower until the end of recovery period compared to pre-sauna blood pressure. The respective 
relative changes from pre-sauna to post sauna values are presented in Supplementary 
Table 1. Supplementary Figure 1 shows relative changes in temperature, heart rate and 
blood pressure. 
 
Sauna and arterial stiffness 
Table 3 and Figure 1 show changes in AS parameters after sauna. Mean carotid-femoral 
PWV before sauna was 9.8 (2.4) m/s and decreased to 8.6 (1.6) m/s immediately after 
sauna, being 9.0 (1.7) m/s after 30 minutes’ recovery period. Values for augmentation index 
were 9.6 (15.8) pre sauna, 4.1 (15.7) immediately after sauna, and 7.5 (15.6) 30 minutes 
after sauna. Left ventricular ejection time and diastolic time were lower immediately after 
sauna (Table 3). From pre-sauna to immediate post-sauna assessment time points, left 
ventricular ejection time decreased from 306.7 (26.2) to 275.1 (31.8) ms and diastolic time 
from 633.2 (116.0) to 493.3 (113.8) ms. The relative changes in PWV, left ventricular 
ejection time and diastolic time post-sauna were significant as shown in Supplementary 
Table 2. All indices of AS including PWV, augmentation index, left ventricular ejection time 
and diastolic time changed in the same direction for both genders after sauna exposure, and 
relative changes of AS parameters were statistically significant in the study group 
immediately after sauna (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). 
 
Sauna and laboratory parameters  
There were significant changes in hemoglobin level, leucocyte and thrombocyte count during 
sauna exposure as presented in Table 4 and Figure 1. Hemoglobin levels increased from 
pre-sauna level of 141 (11) to 144 (13) g/l immediately after sauna. Blood leucocytes count 
increased from 6.2 (1.6) to 6.8 (1.6) x10^9/l and the leucocyte count was at the highest level 
immediately after sauna and thrombocyte levels were significantly higher immediately after 
 13 
 
sauna compared with pre-sauna values (Table 4, Supplementary Table 3). Although 
changes in hemoglobin, leucocyte, and thrombocyte over-time were statistically significant, 
hemoglobin and thrombocytes returned to the pre-sauna level after 30 minutes recovery. 
Changes in plasma creatinine, sodium and potassium are presented in Table 4 and Figure 
1. Mean plasma creatinine levels increased from 76 to 79 µmol/l (p<0.0001). Minimal 
changes were observed for sodium and potassium levels from pre-sauna levels until 30 
minutes’ recovery, and the respective percentage changes are presented in Supplementary 
Table 3. Hematological and biochemical parameters are also shown as relative changes in 
Supplementary Figure 1). 
 
Discussion 
This study was conducted to demonstrate effects of a single sauna bathing session on 
cardiovascular function in participants with at least one conventional cardiovascular risk 
factor. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the acute effects of sauna bathing on 
systemic blood pressure and AS as well as common laboratory parameters, immediately 
before and after heat exposure and at 30-minute recovery phase. Blood pressure levels and 
AS were modulated positively due to sauna exposure, while the sauna bathing-induced 
reduction in blood pressure remained constant when comparing baseline values to recovery 
phase data. Hemoglobin levels, leucocyte and thrombocyte counts increased significantly 
due to sauna exposure; with the exception of leucocyte, they all returned to pre-sauna levels 
after recovery time. The increase in creatinine levels were sustained at the time of recovery, 
whereas the changes in levels of sodium and potassium as a result of sauna exposure were 
very minimal. On basis of measured basic laboratory values, it seems that 30 minutes sauna 
exposure is safe in terms of electrolyte (sodium/potassium) balance. Rise of hemoglobin 
levels could be attributed to sauna-induced fluid-loss, although 500 ml water was available to 
balance increased sweating.  
This study showed that sauna bathing leads to significant decrease in blood pressure, which 
is a clinically important finding among participants with cardiovascular risk factors. As sauna 
bathing produces acute vasodilation which causes a significant drop in blood pressure, it can 
 14 
 
be postulated that regular sauna bathing could potentially result in longer-term reduction of 
blood pressure16. Systolic blood pressure remained lower compared to pre-sauna levels 
during the whole 30 minutes’ recovery period. It is suggested that a short sauna session may 
reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension3,9,30. In patients with slightly elevated 
blood pressure, sauna therapy produced positive effects on systemic blood pressure, 
including 24-hour blood pressure levels3,9. Increased sweating during sauna bathing is 
accompanied by reduction in blood pressure and a higher heart rate, whiles cardiac stroke 
volume is largely maintained; although a part of blood volume is diverted from the internal 
organs to body peripheral parts with decreasing venous return which is not facilitated by 
active skeletal muscle work. Indeed, comparable with exercise-induced adaptations, 
repetitive heat stress could improve endothelial function and arterial stiffness and may lower 
resting blood pressure in sedentary humans 6,31. Due to the increased skin blood flow under 
heat stress conditions, cutaneous microvascular function is improved by passive repeated 
heat therapy5. 
This study showed that hot sauna bathing leads to changes in cardiovascular function which 
include beneficial effects on AS with decrease in blood pressure. We found for the first time 
that PWV was decreased significantly after sauna bathing. Consistently, left ventricular 
ejection time and diastolic time decreased due to sauna exposure. Enhanced AS is a 
possible protective link between heat exposure and changes in vascular function. Our study 
showed that all indicators of cardiovascular compliance were improved after a single session 
of sauna bathing. We have also shown that heat exposure of sauna has positive effects on 
arterial compliance, providing a possible protective pathway against arterial stiffening which 
is a progressive pathology of the arterial wall5,6,17. Although resting blood pressure levels are 
correlated with AS, studies have shown that AS is an additional indicator of both compliance 
of arteries and an independent marker of predicting CVD outcomes32. These beneficial 
effects of sauna bathing on indices of cardiovascular function may underpin the long-term 
protective effects of sauna bathing on cardiovascular and mortality risk, as recently 
demonstrated12. The proposed positive effects on vascular function in the current study were 
 15 
 
based on traditional hot and dry Finnish sauna bathing, which is not comparable to saunas 
operating at lower temperatures and heated water immersion5,6,30.  
We also assessed changes in hematological indices and their profile; hemoglobin levels 
were observed to be increased after sauna, which may be an indicator of increased 
hemoconcentration. This is consistent with findings showing that hemoglobin levels were 
significantly increased after sauna 4,33. Our study also showed that leucocytes and 
thrombocytes increased slightly after sauna bathing and electrolyte levels remained stable. 
The levels of plasma creatinine tended to increase slightly due to sauna bathing, although 
the changes were within normal range and unlikely to lead to long-lasting changes in kidney 
function. There are no previous comparable studies showing changes in basic laboratory 
parameters after sauna bathing.  
Participants’ body temperature increased from the mean level of 36.4°C until 38.4°C 
immediately after sauna; however, all participants underwent sauna session successfully.  
Body temperature tended to decrease during the recovery period at an average room 
temperature back to individual pre-sauna levels. In general, a temperature for a typical 
Finnish sauna is usually adjusted around 80°C. In this study, the temperature of sauna was 
stabilized and controlled for every participant, and measured at 10 seconds intervals during 
the sauna sessions. Body weight increased significantly during sauna session, which might 
be due to water consumption. In this study, participants were each allowed to drink 500 ml 
still water during the sauna session and recovery period (total amount 500ml). All consumed 
water was accurately controlled. The wet swimming suits after the sauna sessions could also 
explain the increased body weight. 
 
The current study evaluates the acute effects of 30 minutes’ sauna exposure on body 
physiology and cardiovascular function in a large sample. Our study employed a large 
number of participants, which provided adequate pre-defined power to assess meaningful 
clinical changes in indices evaluated. In this study, the assessment of cardiovascular 
parameters such as blood pressure and AS was performed using standard measurement 
protocols. Currently, PWV is considered the most reliable non-invasive measurement of AS. 
 16 
 
Conditions in the sauna including the duration of use simulated a typical dry and hot Finnish 
sauna session, and there were no any adverse events during the sauna. Study participants 
were allowed to drink water during sauna and recovery period, according to guidance of the 
local ethical committee. Limitations included the before and after exposure design with the 
short-term nature of the intervention without serial repeated post-sauna measurements 
during the recovery period and lack of a control group. However, the study setting is novel in 
this research context focusing on most immediate effects of sauna bathing on cardiovascular 
function and biological variables. Our previous epidemiological study suggests that to reduce 
CVD risk, frequent sauna sessions at 19 minutes per single sauna session may be required 
to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system12. Consistently with our previous 
findings, we have recently shown that sauna bathing is associated with a lowered risk of 
future hypertension.13 In the current study, we demonstrated acute cardiovascular 
adaptations of 30 minutes’ sauna session. However, the most beneficial duration of sauna 
for cardiovascular health has to be defined and as to whether combining a sauna bathing 
session with physical activity may be more beneficial needs exploration. In addition, a similar 
intervention using a long-term randomized controlled trial is needed in order to gain a better 
perspective of the benefits of sauna (heat stress) and to investigate long-term health effects 
in different populations since short-term findings have been currently documented. 
 
In conclusion, this study showed the effects of a typical Finnish sauna on short-term 
cardiovascular outcomes. Our study indicated that 30 minutes’ heat exposure of sauna leads 
to short-term decrease in blood pressure and positive alterations in AS parameters. Sauna 
bathing with its beneficial effects on cardiovascular function is a recommendable activity in a 
population with risk factors. Further studies are warranted to establish the potential mid- and 
longer-term effects of sauna bathing on cardiovascular adaptation.
