SUMMARY
Background
Although obesity rates are higher in African-American than European-
American women, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its comor-
bidities are more prevalent in European-American women. A common
denominator for increased adiposity, and consequent insulin resistance, is
excess dietary macronutrient intake – which may promote greater preva-
lence and severity of GERD in women.
Aim
To investigate whether GERD is more robustly associated with dietary car-
bohydrate intake, particularly dietary simple carbohydrate intake, and insu-
lin resistance in European-American women.
Methods
About 144 obese women were assessed at baseline and 16 weeks after consum-
ing a high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet. GERD diagnosis and medication usage was
confirmed in medical records with symptoms and medications assessed weekly.
Results
About 33.3% (N = 33) of European-American and 20.0% (N = 9) of Afri-
can-American women had GERD at baseline. Total carbohydrate (r = 0.34,
P < 0.001),
sugars
(r = 0.30,
P = 0.005),
glycaemic
load
(r = 0.34,
P = 0.001) and HOMAIR (r = 0.30, P = 0.004) were associated with GERD,
but only in European-American women. In response to high-fat/low-carbo-
hydrate diet, reduced intake of sugars was associated with reduced insulin
resistance. By the end of diet week 10, all GERD symptoms and medication
usage had resolved in all women.
Conclusions
GERD symptoms and medication usage was more prevalent in European-
American women, for whom the relationships between dietary carbohydrate
intake, insulin resistance and GERD were most significant. Nevertheless,
high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet benefited all women with regard to reducing
GERD symptoms and frequency of medication use.

 INTRODUCTION
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), occurring in
20–30% of US adults,1 is the most common gastrointesti-
nal diagnosis with over 9 million out-patient visits annu-
ally.2, 3 Treatment is empirical and US prescription drug
spending for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2
receptor antagonists (H2RA) amounts to ~$12.5 billion
annually.1, 3–6 Yet, 30–40% of patients are response fail-
ures and up to 60% report residual symptoms.5, 7
Chronic
inadequately
treated
GERD
can
lead
to
oesophagitis, strictures and Barrett’s oesophagus which
predisposes to oesophageal adenocarcinoma.1, 7, 8 The
growth in incidence of GERD comorbidities parallels the
rise in obesity prevalence over the past three decades,9, 10
with the risk for GERD increasing threefold for every
3.5 kg/m2 increase in body mass index (BMI).11 Indeed,
excess adiposity increases the percentage of time that
oesophageal pH is acidic (<4.0) and the number of reflux
episodes
experienced.12
Compared
to
normal-weight
adults, the odds of having GERD are threefold greater in
obese men and fourfold greater in obese women.10, 13–16
Although obesity rates are higher in US women of
African descent (56.6%) compared to those of European
descent
(32.8%),17, 18
GERD
comorbidities
such
as
oesophagitis are more prevalent in European-Americans
who now have a four-fold higher incidence of oesopha-
geal adenocarcinoma.19, 20 While the exact mechanism
for this racial disparity remains undetermined, it is plau-
sible that the accumulation of more visceral (vs. subcuta-
neous) adipose tissue by European-Americans in the
abdominal depot, and the degree of insulin resistance
produced, have more profound metabolic effects on
functional disorders – including GERD. Importantly,
recent evidence links greater insulin resistance with
increased prevalence and severity of GERD symptoms.21
A common denominator for the rising prevalence of
obesity, intra-abdominal adiposity, and consequent insu-
lin resistance is higher dietary energy intake, now ~340
calories more per day – mostly from increased dietary
carbohydrates.22 High-carbohydrate intake, particularly
simple carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharides), stimu-
lates secretion of insulin and incretins like glucagon-like
peptide 1 promoting postprandial glycaemia, hyperinsuli-
naemia and insulin resistance. Notably, a case series of
five adults reported resolution of GERD symptoms
within 2 weeks of consuming a low-carbohydrate/high-
fat (Atkins) diet.23 Moreover, a crossover trial with 41
subjects showed that 70% had significant symptom
improvement on low-carbohydrate vs. low-fat diet, and
only 6% reported no benefit from reduced carbohydrate
intake.24 Of concern, the published studies utilised severe
carbohydrate restriction of 20 g/day which limits appli-
cability to the general adult population who typically
consume ≥250 g/day.25 The lack of clarity regarding the
interaction between dietary carbohydrates and GERD
also continues due to long-held belief that high-fat foods
increase GERD symptoms, possibly by delaying gastric
emptying.26, 27 However, ingestion of high- compared to
low-fat meals showed no difference in postprandial lower
oesophageal sphincter pressure or gastro-oesophageal
reflux.28 Moreover, systematic review shows no unequiv-
ocal relationship between dietary fat and GERD.29 Fur-
thermore, low-fat weight loss trials have not consistently
demonstrated improvement in GERD symptoms or med-
ication use.28, 30, 31
Considering the racial disparities in obesity and insu-
lin resistance in women, the insufficient evidence sup-
porting a role for dietary fats in GERD, and the lack of
efficacy from low-fat diets, we hypothesised that carbo-
hydrates, rather than fats, were associated with GERD in
obese women. We further hypothesised that decreased
dietary carbohydrate intake would be associated with
reduced GERD symptoms and medication use, and
would do so most robustly in European- vs. African-
American women. To shed light on a plausible underly-
ing mechanism, we also hypothesised that relationships
between dietary carbohydrates, GERD and race would be
influenced by the degree of insulin resistance present. To
test these hypotheses, we conducted a case–control anal-
ysis with data from a 16-week intervention designed to
determine metabolic effects of consuming a diet wherein
the amount of carbohydrate was lower than typical (35%
vs. 45% energy), the amount of fat was higher than typi-
cal (48% vs. 38% energy) and the amount of protein
remained unchanged (17% energy).32 This study was

METHODS
Subjects
European-American and African-American women aged
21–50 years with Class I/II obesity (BMI 30–39.9 kg/m2)
were recruited through e-mail announcements and fliers
posted in the local vicinity. All subjects were born in the
US and race was self-identified with confirmation that

Dietary carbohydrates, GERD and obese women
 both parents originated from the same racial group.
Consistent with current American College of Gastroen-
terology guidelines for diagnosis and empiric treatment
of GERD (i.e. oesophageal pH monitoring and endo-
scopy not being required in typical patients),1, 33, 34
GERD diagnosis and prescription for GERD medications
were obtained from electronic medical record review. A
baseline clinic visit was conducted by a study nurse and
dietitian (RD) to obtain a comprehensive diet, weight
and gastrointestinal health history. To assess GERD fre-
quency and severity, items from the NIH Promis Sys-
tem35 and the Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of
GERD36 were used. Additional questionnaires included
the Eating Attitudes Test,37 the Three-Factor Eating
Questionnaire38 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of
Life.39 The RD also performed random 24-h diet recall
interviews using Nutrition Data System for Research
(NDSR version 2011; Nutrition Coordinating Center,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) to quantify current energy,
macronutrient and micronutrient intakes.
Physical measures were obtained in triplicate and
averaged for seated blood pressure (after a 5-min rest
using a calibrated sphygmomanometer with a large size
cuff), height (�0.1 cm via wall-mounted stadiometer),
weight (�0.1 kg via digital platform scale), and waist
and hip circumferences (�0.1 cm via flexible measuring
tape above the right iliac crest and at the full extension
of the buttocks respectively). A venous blood sample was
obtained to rule out acute illness by assessing complete
blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver enzymes and
lipid profile via standard assays performed at the Van-
derbilt Department of Pathology Clinical Laboratory.
Potential subjects were excluded if GERD symptoms
(heartburn,
reflux,
regurgitation)
occurred
less
than
1 day per week during the prior 3 months; if they had a
history of tobacco use; alcohol or substance abuse; gas-
trointestinal disease other than GERD; hypertension;

or
LDL cholesterol >130 mg/dL); were pregnant or lactat-

ing or reducing medications; used daily aspirin, Couma-
din or ACE inhibitors; consumed dietary supplements
other than a multivitamin/mineral supplement; and had
excessive caffeinated beverage intake (>240 mg/day).
Intervention
Subjects were provided with instructions and 14-day
cycle menu plans for the diet intervention. Caloric goal
was individualised based on measured resting energy
expenditure multiplied by a modest 1.2 activity factor.40
Recipes for meals and snacks were calculated using
NDSR software. Total carbohydrate was categorised as
complex (total starch) or simple (total sugars: mono-
and disaccharides)41 and balanced within menu plans as
half complex and half simple. Total fat was balanced as
one-third saturated, one-third monounsaturated, one-
third polyunsaturated and standardised across subjects
by providing all sources of fats (oils, spreads, nuts and
seeds) at weekly clinic visits in pre-portioned containers.
Weekly visits included assessment of weight, anthropo-
metrics, and occurrence of heartburn, reflux, regurgita-
tion,
other
gastrointestinal
symptoms
and
GERD
medication use over the prior week.
Clinical testing
Subjects were admitted to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research
Center for testing at baseline and study weeks 2, 9 and 16.
They were reminded to avoid alcohol, excess caffeine
intake and nonroutine physical activities during the 2 days
before, and to fast from 22:00 hours until arrival at
7:00 hours. Resting energy expenditure was measured in
thermoneutral conditions using a mobile metabolic cart
system
(ParvoMedics
TrueOne
2400�;
Sandy,
UT,
USA).42 Next, a certified densitometrist performed dual
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a Lunar iDXA
TM
(GE Healthcare, GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI, USA)
scanner, which was phantom calibrated before each use, to
acquire whole and regional body composition. Finally, a
venous blood sample was obtained to measure fasting
levels of glucose (colorimetric timed endpoint method),
insulin (chemiluminescent immunoassay) and high-sensi-
tivity C-reactive protein (partial enhanced turbidimetric
assay). The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resis-
tance (HOMAIR) was calculated as [fasting glucose
(mmol/L) 9 fasting insulin (mU/L)]/22.5.43
Data analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS (version 19.0;
IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Data were assessed for nor-
mality by visual inspection of Q-Q plots (i.e. plotting the
quantiles of the variable against the theoretical normal
quantiles for that variable). Nonparametric approaches
were
employed
to
compare
characteristics
between
women by GERD status and race at baseline when plots
depicted deviation from normality. Univariate relation-
ships between variables were assessed using Spearman’s
rho
correlation
coefficients.
Binary
and
multivariate
logistic regression models were fit adjusting for age,

 weight and BMI to assess relationships between nutri-
ents, adipose tissue depots and GERD status in order to
identify correlates that significantly increase the odds of
having GERD and to generate predictive probability
plots. Within nutrients, the category of carbohydrates
was categorised by molecular size (simple: mono- and
disaccharides; complex: oligo- and polysaccharides) and
by digestibility (total vs. available carbohydrate). Within
simple carbohydrates, we analysed both total simple car-
bohydrate (total sugars) and added simple carbohydrate
(added sugars), defined as those sugars and syrups used
as ingredients in processed or prepared foods, as well as
each individual simple carbohydrate.41, 44 For analysis of
dietary fats, we analysed total fat intake, fat intake classi-
fied by saturation status (saturated, monounsaturated,
polyunsaturated) and individual fatty acids. To assess
changes over time, repeated measures ANOVA was per-
formed.

RESULTS
Baseline GERD status
Of the 144 women, 50 (34.7%) reported GERD symp-
toms. In the present analysis, we excluded eight who did
not meet the criteria of having GERD diagnosis in their
medical record and taking prescribed medications to
treat GERD symptoms more than 1 day per week during
the 3 months prior to enrolment. Of the 42 women, 21
were taking over-the-counter medications for GERD
(TUMs�) in addition to their prescribed medications,
although the proportion taking over-the-counter medica-
tions did not differ significantly by race at baseline or at
any other study time-point. In 42 women, the frequency
of experiencing GERD symptoms (heartburn and/or
regurgitation/reflux) averaged 1.1 � 0.5 times per day
(Table 1).
Baseline differences by GERD status
Overall, women with GERD were about 3 years older on
average (P = 0.004) than those without GERD (Table 2).
No significant differences were detected at baseline in
body weight, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, total
body fat or android region (truncal) fat between women
with and without GERD. Average daily total amount
(grams) of food consumed daily and total fat intake did
not differ in women with and without GERD. There
were also no differences in the average amounts of
dietary fibre (soluble or insoluble), alcohol or caffeine
consumed. While total carbohydrate intake also did not
differ, women with GERD consumed significantly more
available (digestible) carbohydrates (P = 0.002). Women
with GERD also had significantly higher intakes of
sucrose
(GERD:
48.9 � 37.0 g
vs.
non-GERD:
37.3 � 23.6 g,
P = 0.03),
added
sugars
(GERD:
73.7 � 47.8 g vs. non-GERD: 60.6 � 40.8 g, P = 0.03)
and total sugars (GERD: 99.5 � 49.5 g vs. non-GERD:
82.3 � 40.8 g, P = 0.03). In contrast, there were no dif-
ferences between women with and without GERD in the
intake of lactose or fructose (Table 2). Interestingly, the
types of foods being consumed at baseline that com-
prised simple carbohydrate (mono- and disaccharides)
intake differed by group; in women with GERD, most
(>60%) of their intake of total sugars was derived from
sweet solids (cakes, pies, frozen desserts, cookies, brown-
ies, granola bars), whereas in women without GERD,
most of total sugars intake was from sweet liquids (soda,
fruit flavoured beverages, sweetened milk, sweet tea).
Thus, overall dietary glycaemic load was higher in
women with GERD (GERD: 193.6 � 51.4 vs. non-
GERD:
166.5 � 60.0,
P = 0.005)
and
women
with
GERD had higher HOMAIR scores (GERD: 2.9 � 2.3 vs.
non-GERD: 2.3 � 2.1, P = 0.04), indicating greater insu-
lin resistance. In multivariate analysis, the factors signifi-
cantly associated with increased odds for having GERD
at baseline were older age, higher total sugars intake and
European-American race. No other factors significantly
accounted for the variability in having GERD. Figure 1
presents the relationship between having GERD based

Dietary carbohydrates, GERD and obese women
 on total sugars intake adjusted for age (P = 0.01). Nota-
bly, the odds of having GERD would increase 13% for
every additional teaspoon (4.2 g) of sugars consumed
(Table 3).
Baseline differences in women with GERD by race
At baseline, 33.3% of European-American and 20.0% of
African-American women had GERD. There were no
significant differences by race in age, body weight, BMI,
waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, total body fat,
android region fat, or in the average amount of food
consumed daily or average energy intake (Table 4). Yet,
European-American women with GERD tended to have
lower fat intake (36.0 � 5.0 vs. 43.4 � 9.0% kcal, respec-
tively, P = 0.05) and higher carbohydrate intake than
African-American women with GERD (P = 0.03). Euro-
pean-American women with GERD also had higher
intakes of available carbohydrate (P = 0.004), total and

 added sugars (Ps = 0.01), and they tended to have
greater
insulin
resistance
(HOMAIR
3.2 � 2.5
vs.
1.9 � 1.2, P = 0.05).
In
univariate
analyses,
total
carbohydrate
intake
(r = 0.34, P < 0.001), added sugars intake (r = 0.30,
P = 0.005), sucrose intake (r = 0.33, P = 0.001), gly-
caemic load (r = 0.34, P = 0.001), and HOMAIR score
(r = 0.30, P = 0.004) were associated with GERD status
in European-American women. These relationships were
not significant in African-American women (Figure 2).
Response to high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet by GERD
status
Overall, women with and without GERD at baseline had
similar reductions in body weight, BMI, waist circumfer-
ence, total body fat, android and gynoid region fat
(Table 5). As prescribed, percentage of energy from diet-
ary
fat
intake
increased
similarly
in
both
groups
(14.5 � 6.3 vs. 14.6 � 6.1% kcal, P = 0.91). However,
the corresponding decrease in dietary carbohydrate dif-
fered as women with GERD had significantly greater
decreases in available carbohydrate (P = 0.001), total
sugars (P = 0.002) and sucrose intake (P = 0.009), but
not in dietary fibre (P = 0.10), fructose (P = 0.68) or lac-
tose intake (P = 0.26). Indeed, women with GERD
reduced their intake of total sugars by 61% from base-
line. Accordingly, overall glycaemic load was reduced
more in women with GERD (P = 0.001) as was insulin
resistance (HOMAIR, P = 0.02). There were no other dif-
ferences by baseline GERD status with regard to changes
in dietary intakes, including no differences in the reduc-
tion in caffeine (P = 0.54) or alcohol (P = 0.47) con-
sumed.
Response to high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet in
women with baseline GERD by race
In comparing the response to the diet in women who
had GERD at baseline by race (Table 6), European-
American and African-American women had similar
decreases in total energy intake (P = 0.93), but Euro-
pean-American women had a greater decrease in the
intake of available carbohydrates (P = 0.03) and total
sugars intake (P = 0.03). Hence, European-American
women tended to have a significantly greater reduction
in insulin resistance (HOMAIR: P = 0.05). In European-

However, these relationships were not significant in Afri-

resistance reduced three times greater in European-
American than African-American women.
Final GERD status
Overall, we observed resolution of GERD symptoms
and
discontinuation
of GERD
medication usage
in
European-American women by end of study week 9 and
in African-American women by the end of study week
10. This improvement in GERD status persisted in all
women to the end of study week 16 (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
Consistent
with
the
known
epidemiology
of
GERD,1, 45, 46 29.2% of the obese women had GERD
diagnosis and medication use at baseline. In this cohort,
the factor most strongly associated with having GERD
was dietary simple carbohydrates. In evaluating the

 simple carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharides) com-
prising subjects’ intake, it was the amount of sucrose that
was greater in the dietary intakes of women with GERD.
Some insight into the potential role of simple carbohy-
drates might be revealed from prior work where infu-
sions of a disaccharide and of oligosaccharides increased
the number of reflux episodes in a 24-h period.47 As the
number of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relax-
ations increased, it is possible that simple carbohydrates
affect mediators of lower oesophageal sphincter function.
One potential mechanism for dietary sugars influencing
lower oesophageal sphincter function is by stimulating
the secretion of gut hormones, such as gastrin, to pro-
mote gastric acid secretions, reduce sphincter pressure
and/or increase transient sphincter relaxations.48 While
other gut peptides (cholecystokinin, intestinal peptide
YY, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide 1) have also been
investigated in relation to GERD, there remains need for
direct investigation of dietary carbohydrates on hor-
monal mediators, lower oesophageal sphincter function
and GERD.
Another potential mechanism may be related to influ-
ence on gastric distention and motility. It is intriguing
that the food sources of simple carbohydrates at baseline
differed
between
women
with
and
without
GERD;
women with GERD derived most of theirs from solid
foods, whereas the women without GERD consumed
most from liquids. By occupying greater stomach volume
and slowing gastric emptying, solid foods retained in the
proximal stomach may potentiate greater number of
transient
lower
oesophageal
sphincter
relaxations.49
While it is unclear to what extent delayed emptying and
impaired motility actually influence GERD symptoms,
both have been described previously in GERD patients.
It is intriguing that the relationship between simple
carbohydrates and GERD was significant only in the
European-American because some nationally representa-
tive data suggest African-American women consume
more simple carbohydrates than European-American
women.50 However, the present data showed that despite
similar energy (kcal) and protein intake, European-
American women had significantly greater consumption
of total carbohydrate, available carbohydrate, added sug-
ars and total sugars at baseline. Congruous with the
baseline findings, dietary simple carbohydrate was the
factor most strongly associated with resolution of GERD
symptoms and medication use after 16 weeks of con-
suming the high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet. This finding
is consistent with an experiment in eight obese women
showing a 44% symptom improvement, 51% decrease in
time oesophageal pH was <4.0 and a reduction in John-
son–DeMeester score similar to that expected with phar-
maceutical treatment, just 6 days after commencing low-
carbohydrate diet.51
In the European-American women, the reduction in
sucrose, added sugars and total sugars was associated
with an overall decrease in dietary glycaemic load. The
reduction
in
dietary
sugars
and
glycaemic
load
appeared to drive the significant improvement in insu-
lin resistance (measured by HOMAIR score) in the

Dietary carbohydrates, GERD and obese women
 European-American
women
–
especially
considering
that reductions in body weight, BMI, waist circumfer-
ence and android region fat did not differ in women
with
and
without
GERD.
A
relationship
between
HOMAIR and GERD was first reported in a cross-sec-
tional study wherein the association was strongest in
male
subjects.21
The
present
finding
of
a
robust
relationship
in
women,
which
improved
with
diet
intervention,
suggests
that
insulin
resistance
is
an
under-explored risk factor for occurrence of GERD in
all individuals. Notably, the relationship between insu-
lin resistance and GERD at baseline, as well as the
relationship between improved insulin resistance and
GERD resolution after high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet,
was not detected in African-American women. The
relationship
between
insulin
resistance
and
race
is
considered complex and paradoxical; although African-
American
women
tend
to
have
higher
insulin
resistance
in
general,
when
matched
to
European-
Americans they do not have higher levels of known
risk factors including visceral adipose tissue and blood
lipids and thus, present a different metabolic profile.
The most unusual finding was that all women with
GERD had resolution of their symptoms, and thus, dis-
continued GERD medications within 10 weeks of con-
suming
the
high-fat/low-carbohydrate
diet,
a
novel
outcome that persisted through the end (week 16) of the
diet intervention. It is important to note that the

 response to this diet also included significantly reduced
body weight. Indeed, high body mass is associated with
increased oesophageal acid exposure.52 Although the
American
Gastroenterological
Association
guidelines
advise weight loss for overweight/obese people with
GERD,1 the few studies investigating the effects of non-
surgical weight loss have yielded mixed results. While
some show a positive association between lower oeso-
phageal
pH
and
weight
loss,
comparing
calorically
restricted vs. unrestricted diet showed no significant
decrease in GERD symptoms despite a 10% weight
loss.53 As the amount of weight loss in the present study
was similar between women with and without GERD, it
does not appear that resolution of GERD symptoms and
medication use was due solely to weight loss. Moreover,
a significant relationship between BMI and GERD was
not observed in these women at baseline. It is possible
this inconsistency in the relationship between body mass
and GERD reflects a gender-specific difference in the
presentation of GERD.54
A major strength of this study was the meticulous cal-
culation, standardisation and balancing of the high-fat/
low-carbohydrate diet with total carbohydrate as half
complex, half simple and total fat as one-third saturated,
one-third monounsaturated and one-third polyunsatu-
rated. Diet assessment reliability was enhanced by in-
depth subject training of 24-h recall methodology and
portion size estimation using standardised measuring

Dietary carbohydrates, GERD and obese women
 utensils, along with RD use of the USDA multiple-pass
technique, a standardised script and software-generated
probes.55 Objective measurement of fatty acid oxidation
rate, respiratory quotient and 24-h urinary urea nitrogen
concentrations confirmed that average daily consumption
met prescribed goals. Moreover, frequency of clinic visits
and duration of the diet intervention provided adequate
exposure and time to observe persistent resolution of
symptoms and medication use.
With regard to study limitations, it might have been
informative to confirm GERD diagnosis with 24-h oeso-
phageal pH monitoring or PPI testing. However, stan-
dard practice is to treat empirically, as presented in
American
College
of
Gastroenterology
guidelines,33
unless patients are unresponsive to pharmaceutical treat-
ment.56 Indeed a symptom-based approach is considered
efficacious.57 Yet, interpretation of the present findings is
limited by the sample size of the case–control design
which had unequal numbers of European-American and
African-American women. Future prospective work is
needed using randomised designs with large samples to
investigate effects of promising diets on GERD. As this
study
was
performed
in
obese
females,
it
remains
unknown whether similar responses would occur in
males. It is noteworthy that gender-related differences
have been identified in the gene expression, clinical out-
come and progression of GERD.58
CONCLUSION
GERD is a major public health problem with high medi-
cation use (PPIs being a top three highest selling
pharmaceutical agent), health care costs, lost worker pro-
ductivity and overall quality of life burden. While food
intake should have a buffering effect reducing stomach
acidity, reflux most often occurs postprandially. Yet,
results from prior diet interventions are conflicting, and
thus, no evidence-based dietary recommendations are
available for standard practice. Contrary to long-held
belief that higher fat intake promotes GERD symptoms,
nationally representative data do not show a strong asso-
ciation between dietary fat and GERD.59 Thus, the pre-
sent study provides important insights that contribute to
the accumulating evidence of a role for dietary simple
carbohydrates in GERD pathophysiology. We found that
simple carbohydrates, particularly sucrose, contribute to
GERD in obese women and the likelihood of having
GERD was predicted by simple carbohydrate (total sug-
ars) intake. The finding that the probability of having
GERD increases with each additional teaspoon of simple
carbohydrates is highly relevant considering per capita
consumption of added sugars has increased 20–30% over
the past three decades.60 The discontinuance of GERD
symptoms and medication use in all women within
10 weeks of the high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet suggests
that further research is warranted to determine potential
mechanisms underlying the relationship between carbo-
hydrates and GERD. As low-fat weight loss interventions
have not consistently improved GERD status, a more
balanced approach to dietary fat and carbohydrate may
offer potential to impact clinical practice, assist pharma-
ceutical treatment and improve GERD patients’ quality
of life.
