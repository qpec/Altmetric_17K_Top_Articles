Abstract: Migraine is the third most prevalent disease on the planet, yet our understanding of its
mechanisms and pathophysiology is surprisingly incomplete. Recent studies have built upon decades
of evidence that adenosine, a purine nucleoside that can act as a neuromodulator, is involved in pain
transmission and sensitization. Clinical evidence and rodent studies have suggested that adenosine
signaling also plays a critical role in migraine headache. This is further supported by the widespread
use of caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, in several headache treatments. In this review,
we highlight evidence that supports the involvement of adenosine signaling in different forms of
headache, headache triggers, and basic headache physiology. This evidence supports adenosine
A2A receptors as a critical adenosine receptor subtype involved in headache pain. Adenosine A2A
receptor signaling may contribute to headache via the modulation of intracellular Cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) production or 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in neurons
and glia to affect glutamatergic synaptic transmission within the brainstem. This evidence supports
the further study of adenosine signaling in headache and potentially illuminates it as a novel
therapeutic target for migraine.

1. Introduction
Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that plays a critical role in numerous cellular and molecular
functions throughout the brain such as metabolism, cell signaling, purinergic neuronal signaling, and
inflammation [1]. Not surprisingly, adenosine is appreciated for its complex role in many nervous
system disorders such as alcoholism, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, anxiety, Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s, and brain cancer [2–8]. Although progress has been made in understanding
adenosine’s role in certain pain states, less is known about how it is involved in migraine [9].
Current treatment options for headache and migraine include analgesics, triptans, ergots,
behavioral intervention, and nerve stimulation, while new treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies
against Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or the CGRP receptor and CGRP inhibitors, are
under development. Some patients who are non-responders to these treatments choose to undergo
surgical implantation of invasive nerve stimulators to relieve pain [10]. A component of some of these
treatment options is caffeine, a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist [11]. Combining caffeine
with other treatments can improve pain relief by as much as 40% in patients [12–16]. Caffeine was

originally included in many migraine treatments due to the previous assumption that migraine was
a vascular disorder. Now that migraine is thought to be a neurological and not a vascular disorder,
caffeine’s common inclusion in migraine treatments suggests an alternative, non-vascular mechanism
of action behind its efficacy in migraine patients. In this review, we present mounting evidence that
demonstrates adenosine’s role in migraine and headache, revealing it as a potential therapeutic target
for migraine and headache treatment.
2. Modeling Headache and Migraine
Headache is described as pain located above the orbitomeatal line that transects the head,
approximately from the top of the eyes to the back of the skull. Migraine is a disabling neurological
disorder most often characterized by the accompanying headache, but it is much more than just an
episodic headache as it includes many other symptoms such as phonophobia, photophobia, nausea, and
visual auras during the prodromal phase in a subset of patients. Thirty-six million individuals in the
United States suffer from migraine, with a cost-estimate of $50 billion each year [17]. The World Health
Organization has classified it as the third most common disease worldwide [18]. Fourteen-million
migraine patients are diagnosed as chronic migraineurs, described as an individual who experiences a
migraine at least fifteen days out of every month for at least three months [17].
The headache phase of migraine is thought to be caused by activation of dural C and Aδ
nociceptors of the trigeminal ganglion [19]. However, no direct evidence for this exists due to the
difficulty of studying the contribution of meningeal afferents to headache in humans. However,
functional magnetic resonance imaging data demonstrating increased activity in the trigeminal
ganglion during migraine as well as other human studies suggest that headache pain is transmitted
via these nociceptors [20,21]. Trigeminal afferent fibers project centrally to second order neurons of the
trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in the brainstem. It is thought that peripheral and central changes
occur after repeated episodic nociceptor activation that sensitizes this trigeminal system, exacerbating
the perception of migraine pain in secondary or referred areas [22]. Chronic migraine most likely
involves the development of chronic peripheral and central sensitization from repeated attacks [23,24].
We have previously developed two behavioral animal models of chronic trigeminal allodynia
that feature numerous migraine-like characteristics to allow for the investigation of migraine
pathophysiology [25–31]. The first model, designated as the inflammatory stimulation model (IS rats),
was developed by simulating the putative dural nociceptor activation thought to occur during a
headache attack by infusing an inflammatory soup (1-mM histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and
0.1-mM prostaglandin E2 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4) onto the dura through an
affixed cannula 3 ×/week for a total of 12 infusions [26]. Each infusion causes the development
of trigeminal sensitivity in the periorbital region, as measured with von Frey hairs, which recovers
within 2–3 h. Following approximately the fifth infusion, the animals’ baseline thresholds begin to
also decrease (i.e., the animal is still experiencing trigeminal sensitivity before the following infusion
is performed). This repeated inflammatory dural stimulation then induces a steady-state of chronic
trigeminal sensitivity that outlasts the final infusion for months.
The second model, called the spontaneous trigeminal allodynia (STA) in rats, is currently the
only model of primary trigeminal allodynia in animals [32]. Naturally born with this trait, no surgical
procedure or pharmacological treatment is needed to produce an allodynic state that is confined to
the trigeminal system. These animals are not genetically modified, but were instead discovered and
bred to create a colony of STA rats. The gene or genes responsible for this trait are currently unknown.
Similar to human migraineurs who experience a combination of headache-free and headache days with
fluctuating intensity, these animals feature episodically fluctuating trigeminal sensitivity. Both models
of headache share symptomology similar to migraine in that they experience phonophobia, sensitivity
to migraine triggers, similar efficacious responses to migraine treatments, and trigeminal sensitivity
(although expressed differently—IS rats with stable chronic trigeminal sensitivity and STA rats with
episodically fluctuating chronic trigeminal sensitivity) [25,27–29]. These animal models provide an

experimental means to determine elements that are key to migraine pathophysiology and to screen
potential therapeutic treatments.
3. Adenosine Receptor Signaling in the Nervous System
The physiological role of adenosine was first appreciated in 1929 when it was described for
its ability to modulate the beat and conductance of cardiac muscle fibers [33]. Adenosine is now
well-accepted as a neuromodulator with extracellular levels of it derived from several cellular
sources within the central nervous system, including multiple glia and neuronal cell types [34–37].
Some evidence even suggests it may be directly packaged and released as a neuro/glio-transmitter
in a Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor (SNARE)- and stimulus-dependent manner [38–40].
Similar to a neuro/glio-transmitter, there are distinct mechanisms for the removal of adenosine
from the extracellular space to deactivate its effects, such as reuptake via equilibrative nucleoside
transporters (ENTs) or metabolism to inosine by adenosine deaminase (ADO) [41,42]. Three primary
mechanisms are responsible for the production/release of extracellular adenosine: equilibrative
transport of adenosine out of the cell through equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) when
intracellular levels are high [43], metabolism of released adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine by
subsequent hydrolysis steps with extracellular 5� ectonucleotidases (i.e., ATP to adenosine diosphate
(ADP) to adenosine monosphate (AMP) to adenosine) [44], or activity-dependent mechanisms during
gliotransmission [38–40].
There are four known adenosine receptor subtypes. These purinergic G protein-coupled receptors
each modulate adenylate cyclase activity in alternate ways [1]. Adenosine A2A and A2B receptors are
coupled to the Gs alpha subunit, stimulating adenylate cyclase activity, while adenosine A1 and A3
receptors are coupled to the Gi alpha subunit, inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity [45]. Control of
adenylate cyclase activity with these receptors allows adenosine to fine-tune intracellular cAMP levels
to control a large host of cellular mechanisms including resting potentials, metabolism, calcium channel
phosphorylation, and gene expression [46]. Each adenosine receptor subtype has been reported to be
expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Adenosine A1 receptors are the most
abundant adenosine receptors in the brain and are found in the neocortex, cerebellum, hippocampus,
and the dorsal horn [45,47]. Adenosine A2A receptors are more widely distributed throughout the
entire brain and the peripheral nervous system; they are found on pre- and postsynaptic nerve
terminals, astrocytes, and the blood-brain barrier [45,48,49]. Adenosine A2B receptors are less studied
but are present on many cell types including astrocytes [50–52]. Adenosine A3 receptor expression
has been reported throughout the brain with a particular abundance in the hippocampus [53–56].
With this wide expression of multiple adenosine receptor subtypes throughout the brain, it is thought
that adenosine subtype-specific physiological processes are achieved by their different affinities for
adenosine: A1, 3–30 nM; A2A, 1–20 nM; A2B, 5–20 µM; A3, >1 µM [57]. Thus, localized modulation of
adenosine concentrations would dictate subtype specificity.
Basal extracellular adenosine levels have been estimated in rats with microdialysis and range
between 30–970 nM depending on the area of the brain [57]: striatum (80 nM) [58], cortex (120 nM) [59],
basal forebrain (30 nM) [60], hippocampus (850 nM) [61], and thalamus (970 nM) [62]. Microdialysis,
however, is heavily dependent on the time point at which the samples are collected. Insertion of the
microdialysis probe causes damage that leads to a large increase in extracellular neurotransmitter
levels. An acclimation period of at least two hours is needed to establish a baseline before measuring
neurotransmitter concentrations [29,63]. This is seen in the above estimates in the hippocampus
and thalamus which are taken prior to the 2 h-post implantation time point. In fact, other forms
of adenosine measurement such as the collection of whole brain samples or cerebral spinal fluid
and in vitro pharmaco-dynamic measurement of adenosine suggests lower basal adenosine levels of
50–200 nM [57]. Although these estimates of basal adenosine levels are high enough to activate A1
and A2A receptors, it is important to note that these techniques do not allow for the measurement

of adenosine concentration in the synaptic cleft or at the site of the receptor which may be highly
regulated by ENTs and adenosine deaminase.
4. The Role of Adenosine in Pain
The investigation of adenosine’s potential as a therapeutic has revealed its complex role in pain.
Adenosine signaling can be anti- or pro-nociceptive depending on the location (central or peripheral),
form of pain (acute or chronic), and the adenosine receptor subtype targeted [64,65].
Adenosine A1 receptor agonists are anti-nociceptive [66]. Adenosine A1 receptor activation
in peripheral nerve terminals with N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) prevented prostaglandin
E2-induced mechanical allodynia in the hindpaw of rats [67].
Adenosine A1 receptor agonists,
R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine and N-ethylcarboxamide-adenosine, decreased formalin-induced
hyperalgesia in rats (as measured by total licking time during a five minute period) [68].
Mice genetically engineered to lack adenosine A1 receptors had enhanced thermal hyperalgesia and
lost the analgesic effect of intrathecal adenosine injection [69]. Administration of CPA, the adenosine
A1 receptor agonist, decreased thermal hyperalgesia in normal rats and decreased both mechanical and
thermal hyperalgesia in nerve injured rats. These analgesic effects were reversed with administration
of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) [70]. Adenosine
A1 receptors have been found to play a vital role in the adenosine-induced antinociceptive effects
of acupuncture in mice where adenosine A1 knock-out mice did not experience the anti-nociceptive
effects of acupuncture in an inflammatory or neuropathic pain model [71]. Intrathecal injection of an
adenosine A1 agonist in humans decreased postoperative pain [72]. Interestingly, intrathecal injection
of adenosine (i.e., non-subtype specific action) prevents post-operative pain but causes headache,
suggesting that other adenosine receptor subtypes may play an opposing role in headache when
compared to other forms of pain [73,74].
Adenosine A2A receptor agonists are pro-nociceptive [66]. Adenosine injection into the hindpaw of
rats induced a dose-dependent increase in mechanical hyperalgesia in a cAMP-mediated manner. This
was prevented by the administration of the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, PD 081360-0002. In the
same study, a hyperalgesic response similar to adenosine injection was produced with the injection of
adenosine A2A receptor agonists, 5�-(N-ethyl)-carboxamido-adenosine or 2-phenylaminoadenosine [67].
The adenosine A2A receptor agonist, 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl) phenethylamino-5�-N-ethylcarboxamido
adenosine hydrochloride (CGS-21680), enhanced formalin-induced pain in rats while the adenosine
A2A antagonist, 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX), decreased formalin-induced pain [75].
Another adenosine A2A agonist, 2-(2-aminoethylamino)-carbonylethylphenylethylamino-adenosine
(APEC), enhanced formalin induced pain in mice [68]. Microdialysis in the rat hindpaw demonstrated
that subcutaneous formalin induces a dose-dependent increase in adenosine production, further
suggesting adenosine involvement in formalin-induced pain [76]. An adenosine A2A knock-out mouse
had a decreased thermal pain response, suggesting that the presence of adenosine A2A receptors
promotes thermal pain [77]. These knock-out mice also feature increased mechanical hyperalgesia in
response to inflammatory-induced pain [78].
Less is known about the specificity of adenosine A2B and A3 receptors in pain. Adenosine
A2B receptor activation, increasing intracellular cAMP levels similar to adenosine A2A receptor
activation, appear to be pro-nociceptive. Administration of multiple adenosine A2B antagonists
prevented thermal-induced pain in mice [79].
Mechanical and thermal pain was enhanced in
an adenosine deaminase (ADO) knock-out mouse, leading to system-wide adenosine elevation.
This pain was prevented pharmacologically with the adenosine A2B antagonist, PSB-1115
(1-propyl-8-p-sulfophenulxanthine). It was also prevented in mice lacking both ADO and adenosine
A2B receptors, suggesting that adenosine A2B receptors are pronociceptive [80]. PSB-1115 treatment
also decreased pain-related behaviors during the early and late phases of formalin-induced
pain, suggesting peripheral and central activity of adenosine A2B receptors in pain [81]. In the
same study, adenosine A3 receptors also appeared to be pro-nociceptive.
An adenosine A3
 Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 30
5 of 20
receptor antagonist, PSB-10, prevented the second phase of formalin-induced pain. Interestingly,
it had no effect on the first phase suggesting central, but not peripheral, activity of adenosine
A3 receptors during inflammatory pain.
This pro-nociceptive effect of adenosine A3 receptor
activation is interesting since it inhibits adenylate cyclase activity similar to that of adenosine
A1 receptors, which are anti-nociceptive.
This suggests mechanisms independent of adenylate
cyclase activity that are alternatively mediated by adenosine A1 and A3 receptor activation.
Contrary to this, however, central administration of an adenosine A3 agonist (MRS5698) was
analgesic in a rat model of neuropathic pain [54].
Another A3 receptor agonist, IB-MECA
(1-Deoxy-1-[6-[((3-Iodophenyl)methyl)amino]-9H-purin-9-yl]-N-methyl-β-D-ribofuranuronamide),
also prevented the development of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain [54]. This may highlight a
differential role of adenosine A3 receptors in acute (formalin) and persistent (neuropathic) pain states.
These studies suggest that adenosine receptors associated with the Gs alpha subunit (A2A and A2B) are
generally pro-nociceptive, while those associated with the Gi alpha subunit (A1 and A3) are generally
anti-nociceptive. This is likely due to their effects on intracellular adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP
levels that have been implicated in neuropathic and inflammatory pain [82].
5. The Role of Adenosine in Headache Pathophysiology
Numerous key physiological changes that have been observed in chronic headache patients and
animal models of trigeminal allodynia can be modulated by adenosine. This suggests that adenosine
signaling may contribute to or sustain these changes.
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been hypothesized to play a critical role in migraine. Histological
studies have revealed in migraine patients ragged-red fibers and cytochrome-c-oxidase-negative
fibers in skeletal muscles [83,84]. Decreased electron transport chain complex activity and metabolic
abnormalities are seen in migraine patients [85,86]. We recently identified a decrease in mitochondrial
spare respiratory capacity of brain sections from the TNC of the IS and STA rat models [27,87].
Mitochondrial dysfunction can affect the production of extracellular adenosine. The formation
of extracellular adenosine is common in tissue hypoxia and is thought to be due to decreased
mitochondrial activity such as that seen in the TNC of our models [88].
Artificially inducing
mitochondrial dysfunction in isolated rat hepatocytes by treatment with the ATP synthase inhibitor,
oligomycin, decreases intracellular ATP levels while increasing AMP levels [89]. Similar to adenosine
production from the residual AMP molecule derived from acetate utilization in astrocytes by
5�-nucleotidases (5�NT), this increase in AMP within the cell could be a source for adenosine production
when mitochondrial dysfunction is present. 5�NT activity can be enhanced during hypoxia or when
ADP levels are high, increasing the production of adenosine [90,91]. ADP also increases the affinity of
5�NT for AMP, potentially facilitating the production of adenosine [92]. Mitochondrial dysfunction
and adenosine signaling could affect pain via activation of AMPK, a protein kinase heavily associated
with pain plasticity [93]. Extracellular adenosine, increases in the AMP:ATP ratio during hypoxia, and
inhibition of 5�NT all enhance AMPK activity [94–97]. It is possible that mitochondrial dysfunction
within trigeminal pain processing brain regions exacerbates adenosinergic mechanisms and AMPK
activity to produce headache.
The inflammatory mechanisms thought to be involved in migraine can also be influenced
by adenosine signaling.
We recently found that the key component to dural-stimulated
inflammatory-induced trigeminal sensitivity in rats is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [28]. The activation
of PGE2 receptors increases intracellular cAMP levels, which is the common signaling pathway for
adenosine A2A and A2B receptor activation. In fact, adenosine and PGE2 receptors have been shown to
have synergistic effects on the suppression of the immune response of T cells [98]. PGE2 and adenosine
both increase sodium channel sensitivity in neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion neurons via cAMP
mediated mechanisms [99,100]. It was recently found that PGE2 may initiate its painful effects directly
by increasing extracellular adenosine concentrations through PKC-mediated mechanisms [101].
 Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 30

The roles of glia have become more appreciated in the migraine field with their activation states
potentially affecting headache [102]. Activated microglia and astrocytes could affect pain states
by releasing neuroexcitatory or neuroinflammatory mediators associated with headache or even
by modulating glutamatergic signaling within the brainstem [103–106]. Adenosine signaling can
contribute to astrogliosis via adenosine A2 receptor activation but can also decrease astrogliosis via
adenosine A1 receptor signaling [107,108]. Adenosine has profound effects on astrocytic regulation of
extracellular glutamate levels. Activation of adenosine A2A receptors decrease the activity of the Na/K
ATPase which powers the ionic gradients required for proper glutamate transport into astrocytes
through GLT1, which is responsible for deactivation and regulation of extracellular glutamate in
the synaptic cleft [49,109]. This modulation is important because extracellular glutamate levels are
highly associated with pain. We have found an enhanced increase in extracellular glutamate within
the TNC following treatment with GTN in IS rats that can be prevented by the use of headache
treatments such as noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation [26,28,29]. Similar to the TNC, modulation of
glutamate regulation in the dorsal horn is associated with other forms of chronic pain [110]. Adenosine
may contribute to the dysregulation of extracellular glutamate within the TNC, contributing to the
development of headache.
Activation of microglia and astrocytes also modulate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability which
has been associated with migraine patients [111–114]. Breakdown of the BBB has been hypothesized
to play a key role in migraine. Serum levels of S100B, a marker for astrocyte activation and a candidate
marker for changes in BBB permeability, are increased during and following migraine attacks [115].
MMP-9 and MMP-2, matrix metalloproteinases that digest endothelial cell basal lamina and cause BBB
breakdown, are elevated in the serum of migraine patients [116–119]. White matter lesions in MRI
images of headache patient brains have also been proposed as focal disruptions of the BBB [118,120,121].
Adenosine signaling can modulate the blood-brain barrier via changes in endothelial cells, as measured
by the entrance of intravenously administered macromolecules into the brain [122]. A1 or A2A
knock-out mice feature a decrease in BBB permeability [122]. A non-selective adenosine receptor
agonist decreases transendothelial electrical resistance, increases actinomyosin stress fiber formation,
and alters tight junction molecules [122]. The Federal Drug Administration-approved adenosine A2A
agonist, Lexiscan, also increased permeability in an in vitro primary human BBB system [123]. This was
further confirmed where a series of novel adenosine A2A nanoagonists increased BBB permeability as
measured by increased delivery of multiple drugs to the brain [124]. It is possible that repeated aberrant
adenosine signaling during migraine attacks could cause long-lasting changes to BBB permeability
that may contribute to headache persistence by allowing the entry of normally excluded factors into
the brainstem that enhance pain hypersensitivity [125].
Furthermore, an adenosine A2A receptor gene haplotype was found to be associated with migraine
with aura [126]. The authors of this study ascribe this to adenosine’s regulation of the calcitonin
gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide that plays an integral role in migraine. An adenosine
A1 receptor agonist decreased the release of CGRP and trigeminal activity in cats while an A2A
receptor agonist facilitated CGRP’s effect on synaptic transmission [127,128]. Interestingly, electrical
stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion increased mRNA and protein levels of both CGRP and adenosine
A2A receptors while decreasing mRNA and protein levels of adenosine A1 receptors [129]. Cortical
spreading depression, thought to be the cause of the aura in migraine, also induces adenosine
accumulation in mice [130].
Phonophobia and photophobia are also key characteristics of migraine. Adenosine plays a
significant role in both auditory and visual sensory system processing. Adenosine A1 receptor
activation inhibits light-induced responses of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
(ipRGCs), the non-image forming cell type that plays a critical role in exacerbating headache pain
with light [131,132]. This suggests that A1 activation may even decrease the effects of photophobia.
Furthermore, adenosine signaling plays a critical role in cochlear blood flow and the auditory system
and has been investigated for its therapeutic ability to treat hearing loss [133,134].

6. The Role of Adenosine in Common Forms of Headache
Adenosine may play a critical role in multiple forms of headache. This observation is primarily
derived from the effect of caffeine, a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist, to relieve headache
pain. In fact, a core component of many abortive headache treatments (Excedrin, Vivarin, Midol,
Anacin, Migergot, and Fiorinal) is caffeine. The reasoning to include caffeine was based on the
previous hypothesis that migraine was a vascular disorder and the pulsating pain associated with
it was due to vasodilation of intra- or extracranial arteries [135]. Adenosine, a known vasodilator,
was targeted with caffeine to decrease vasodilation. Although caffeine was found to be efficacious in
headache, it is now thought that migraine headache is a neurological disorder, so caffeine’s effect as a
therapeutic likely does not involve modulation of vasodilation.
Although caffeine may induce its effects on pain through other targets, clinical evidence exists for
adenosine’s role in headache. Papaverine and Sildenafil, adenosine reuptake inhibitors used clinically
for heart attacks, and Dipyridamole, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor used to prevent thrombosis,
act by increasing extracellular adenosine levels in the brain. Interestingly, each of these drugs can
also cause headache in patients [136,137]. Patients undergoing spinal anesthesia treatment to prevent
pain often experience a post-operative headache. Caffeine by itself is often prescribed for treatment
of this post-dural puncture headache [138]. Additionally, migraine patients without aura experience
a surge in serum-adenosine levels during migraine attacks. This surge in adenosine also increases
platelet uptake of serotonin, potentially accounting for the low levels of serotonin observed in migraine
patients [139,140]. This process was pharmacologically determined to work through adenosine A2
receptors [140]. The primary mediator of adenosine receptor intracellular signaling, cAMP, which is
stimulated during adenosine A2A and A2B receptor activation, is also suggested to play a direct role
in migraine. Cilostazol, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 3 which selectively degrades cAMP,
produced headache in both healthy adults and migraineurs [141,142]. Below, we present numerous
forms of headache and the evidence supporting the involvement of adenosine in each.
6.1. Delayed Ethanol-Induced Headache
Delayed ethanol-induced headache (DEIH or hangover headache) is similar to migraine headache
in that it often features throbbing pain with phono- and photophobia. We previously identified that
acetate, an ethanol metabolite, was the key element behind ethanol-induced trigeminal sensitivity
in the IS rat model of trigeminal pain that features migraine-like characteristics [25]. In fact, clinical
observations identified that the inclusion of sodium acetate as a buffer during kidney dialysis in diabetic
patients also causes headache [143]. Acetate has profound effects on the formation of extracellular
adenosine with many neuronal consequences of ethanol thought to be induced via acetate-mediated
adenosinergic mechanisms [2]. In the brain, acetate is utilized almost exclusively by astrocytes as an
energy source, resulting in a residual AMP molecule that is readily converted to adenosine [2,144].
This process is thought to be the mechanism behind the acetate-induced adenosine-mediated effects
of ethanol. In humans, serum-adenosine levels rise following ethanol consumption. In wild-type
rats, ethanol perfusion in the basal forebrain with microdialysis increases extracellular adenosine
levels [60,144–146]. The headache associated with acetate is potentially due to acetate’s effect on
adenosine concentrations in the brain. Not surprisingly, caffeine is widely used to treat DEIH in
humans, suggesting adenosine as a key aspect to the pain phase of DEIH [147]. We also found that
caffeine treatment in the IS rats prevented ethanol-induced trigeminal sensitivity [25]. Caffeine’s
efficacy in the treatment of DEIH suggests adenosine receptor signaling as a critical component to the
pain phase of ethanol ingestion.
6.2. Caffeine Withdrawal Headache
Caffeine withdrawal headaches are very common and occur when individuals decrease their daily
consumption of products containing caffeine, such as coffee or tea. The headache is relieved within
 Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 30
8 of 20
one hour after re-exposure to caffeine [17]. Since basal adenosine signaling is essential for proper
neuronal function, chronic exposure to caffeine likely has significant compensatory effects on adenosine
signaling to sustain basal adenosine function [148]. During chronic adenosine receptor antagonism
with daily caffeine use, this essential basal adenosine signal could be sustained through up-regulation
of adenosine receptors, increasing extracellular adenosine content, or modulation of downstream
mediators of adenosine receptor signaling. Compensatory mechanisms such as these are likely at
play due to the clinical observation that caffeine tolerance quickly develops in humans [149]. In fact,
chronic exposure to caffeine in zebrafish increased expression of adenosine A1 and A2A receptors, but
not A2B and A3 receptor subtypes [150]. Chronic exposure to caffeine in rats increased A1 receptor
expression in the hippocampus [151]. Chronic exposure to caffeine in mice induces a dose-dependent
increase in A2A receptor expression in the striatum and shifted low-affinity A1 receptors to a high
affinity state [152]. Chronic caffeine intake also increases plasma adenosine levels [153]. Each of these
seemingly compensatory changes caused by chronic caffeine exposure could increase the adenosine
signal in the absence of caffeine during the withdrawal period, contributing to caffeine withdrawal
headache that is relieved by re-exposure to caffeine.
6.3. Cluster Headaches
Cluster headaches are a rare but intensely painful headache that is instantly debilitating [154].
One common treatment method for these attacks is the inhalation of pure oxygen [155]. Decreased
oxygen supply has been associated with an increase in adenosine levels [156,157]. The effect of pure
oxygen to relieve this pain may be directly tied to a reduction in adenosine levels. Platelet aggregation
is impaired in cluster headache patients and could be a sign that adenosine levels are higher in
these individuals since adenosine has been shown to dose-dependently inhibit platelet aggregation
in humans [158,159]. Therefore, cluster headache patients may experience greater basal levels of
adenosine that could contribute to the pain phase of this disorder. Increasing oxygen content could
ameliorate this by decreasing adenosine content to relieve pain.
6.4. Sleep-Wake Cycle Related Headaches
Some forms of headache such as migraine, cluster headache, and the hypnic headache are
associated with the sleep-wake cycle [17,160,161].
Adenosine plays a critical role in circadian
rhythms [162]. Extracellular adenosine accumulates during sleep deprivation to promote sleep and
decreases during sleep [162,163]. Caffeine is used as a stimulant by acting as an adenosine receptor
antagonist to decrease adenosine’s sleep-promoting activities [162]. These forms of headache may
occur due to the daily modulation of adenosine receptor expression within the brain or adenosine
metabolism enzymes [164,165]. Upon waking when adenosine levels begin to rise again, there may be
a partial imbalance in the adenosine receptor signal output or changes in receptor subtype-specific
output, contributing to headache via adenosinergic mechanisms. Interestingly, there is even a high
prevalence of sleep disorders that afflict cluster headache patients [166]. These patients may have
aberrantly high levels of adenosine due to lack of sleep. Similar to cluster headaches, caffeine is used
to treat hypnic headaches and has been found to be the most effective treatment option for these
patients [167].
6.5. Post-Traumatic Headache
Post traumatic headache occurs in nearly all patients who experience mild or severe traumatic
brain injury (TBI) [168]. This headache can develop further into chronic post traumatic headache.
Clinical studies have found that interstitial brain adenosine levels increase during oxygen desaturation
events following TBI and are thought to contribute to secondary events following TBI [169]. In the
context of TBI, adenosine is thought to have a neuroprotective effect following injury and thus, use of
adenosine receptor agonists are currently being investigated for TBI treatment [6]. Although adenosine

may serve a role in these neuroprotective processes, they may contribute to the headache or chronic
headache that develops following injury.
6.6. Menstrual Migraine
Menstrual migraine occurs exclusively during the first two days of menstruation in woman [17].
During this time, woman experience a sudden decrease in estrogen and progesterone levels [170].
Estradiol, an estrogen receptor-alpha ligand, was found to increase adenosine A1 receptor expression
in a breast cancer cell line, suggesting that estrogen receptor activation can modulate adenosine
receptor expression and activity [5]. Ovariectomized rats that have systemically depleted estrogen
levels, also have a four-fold decrease in adenosine A2A receptors [171]. In fact, birth controls that
contain estrogen are also associated with headache [172]. Progesterone and estradiol were shown
to increase adenosine’s depressant actions in rat cerebral cortical neurons, suggesting that these
hormones could increase the adenosine signal [173]. Rats treated with progesterone were found
to have lower adenosine deaminase levels, the enzyme responsible for breaking down adenosine,
suggesting increased adenosine concentrations in response to progesterone treatment [174]. Although
these data would suggest that estrogen or progesterone withdrawal at the start of menses would
decrease adenosine levels, they demonstrate the critical cross-talk between sex hormones and the
adenosinergic system which may contribute to menstrual migraine.
7. Adenosine and Common Headache Triggers
Headache triggers increase the probability a headache will develop in a migraine patient
within 24 hours. Triggers can be dietary (alcohol, aspartame, cheese), environmental (perfumes,
the Umbellularia californica tree, pollution), physical (extraneous activity, inactivity, exposure to intense
light), or even psychological (anxiety, stress). Adenosine is involved in a number of these common
headache triggers and may act as a unifying mediator for the induction of headache by them.
Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is a common chemical headache trigger that induces an extended
headache period in chronic migraine patients, but only a short-lived headache in normal
individuals [175,176]. In the IS rat model, GTN induces an extended period of trigeminal sensitivity
and increased extracellular glutamate in the TNC [26,28]. GTN can potentiate the effects of adenosine
on platelet aggregation, and is thought to occur through modulation of adenosine’s intracellular
downstream effector molecule, cAMP [177]. Through this mechanism, GTN could potentially enhance
the adenosine signal even when adenosine levels or adenosine receptor expression are not modified.
GTN also has multiple effects on mitochondrial function, an organelle that has been suggested to
play a role in the development of migraine [27,178,179]. GTN treatment was found to decrease the
activity of complex I in the electron transport chain within isolated rat aortas, decreasing oxygen
consumption [180]. During periods of decreased mitochondrial function, extracellular levels of
adenosine are known to increase [88,181–183]. It could be through this mechanism that GTN induces
trigeminal pain.
The headache tree, or Umbellularia californica, is known to induce severe headache attacks following
inhalation of its vapors [184]. Studies in isolated rat trigeminal ganglion neurons revealed that the
monoterpene ketone, umbellulone, is the chemical substance responsible for this tree’s effect on
headache and that it occurs by selectively activating transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1)
channels in the trigeminal system to induce aberrant activity that is interpreted as headache [184].
Other environmental stimulants such as cigarette smoke, chlorine, formaldehyde, and pollution are
also thought to induce headache via their activation of TRPA1 or other TRP channel subtypes such as
transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) or transient receptor potential menthol 8 (TRPM8) [185].
Similar to adenosine A2A and A2B receptors, these channels increase calcium conductance via increases
in cAMP intracellular concentrations. Adenosine A1 and A3 receptors reduce cAMP levels, decreasing
calcium conductance [1]. Furthermore, cAMP can actively inhibit TRP channel activity [186]. In fact,
caffeine inhibits human TRPA1 channels through unknown mechanisms [187]. There may be a
 Brain Sci. 2017, 7, 30
10 of 20
converging modulation of intracellular cAMP levels by both TRPA1 and adenosine receptors during
pain processing. Furthermore, the activation of TRPA1 channels on human odontoblasts, cells of neural
crest origin, stimulates the release of ATP which can then be quickly metabolized to adenosine [188].
Similarly, TRPV4 activation can cause ATP release in primary urothelial cells [189]. ATP has also
been shown to increase capsaicin-evoked currents in TRPV1 expressing HEK293 cells, suggesting that
ATP or adenosine following extracellular ATP metabolism can interact with and modulate TRPV1
activity [190]. This mechanism of ATP release and metabolism to adenosine following TRP channel
activation likely also occurs in the brain and may serve as a conduit between TRP channels and
headache in various environmental triggers.
Anxiety and stress is a very common headache trigger. Interestingly, adenosine plays a vital role
in anxiety [3,8]. Clinical and rodent data support the concept that adenosine can be both anxiogenic
and anxiolytic, with A2A receptors playing a critical role [8]. In support of adenosine being anxiogenic,
an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist reduced anxiety and stress in rodents that was caused by
maternal separation or chronic unpredictable stress [191,192]. Although a genetic polymorphism of the
A2A receptor gene is associated with individuals diagnosed with panic disorders, the effects of these
polymorphisms on receptor function have not been investigated [193,194]. In support of adenosine
being anxiolytic, A1 or A2A knock-out mice feature anxiety-like behaviors [77,195]. Furthermore,
inducing stress in rats enhanced the expression of adenosine A2A receptors while the overexpression of
adenosine A2A receptors decreased anxiety in an open field test [196]. Although not fully understood,
the critical role of adenosine A2A receptors in both anxiety and headache is interesting because it
provides a potential common target that may play a role in both.
8. Conclusions
The role of adenosine in different forms of headache, headache triggers, and basic headache
physiology suggests it as a core component to headache pain. Although adenosine signaling can
produce differential effects on pain, depending on the receptor subtype activated, adenosine A2A
receptors are likely the critical subtype involved in headache pain. Adenosine signaling may initiate
headache pain by modulation of intracellular cAMP production or AMPK activity that can change
neuronal conductance within critical trigeminal pain processing brain regions. It may also directly
contribute to pain by modulating extracellular glutamate within the synaptic cleft of tripartite synapses
in the TNC or through modulation of the BBB and enhancement of gliosis. Migraineurs may be more
susceptible to these adenosinergic impacts on headache due to the potential presence of mitochondrial
dysfunction which could facilitate the production of excess levels of adenosine. If adenosine plays a
role in headache triggers and various types of headache, it is interesting to note that systemic changes
in adenosine signaling produce headache as opposed to pain across the entire body. This suggests
something unique about headache pathophysiology that makes the trigeminal system more susceptible
to the effects of adenosine on pain.
