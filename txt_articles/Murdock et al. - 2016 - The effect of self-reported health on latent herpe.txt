Abstract
Self-rated health (SRH) is a reliable predictor of health outcomes including morbidity and 
mortality. Immune dysregulation is one hypothesized mechanism underlying the association 
between SRH and health outcomes. Indeed, poorer SRH is associated with greater inflammation. 
The association between SRH and reactivation of latent herpesviruses is unknown, representing an 
important gap in the literature given that reactivation of latent herpesviruses leads to enhanced 
inflammation. The present study addressed this important gap in the literature by examining 
associations between SRH, inflammation (i.e., peripheral cytokines in the blood), and reactivation 
of latent herpesviruses among a sample of 1,208 individuals participating in the Texas City Stress 
and Health Study. Participants completed a self-report measure of SRH and a blood draw. Results 
indicated that higher SRH was associated with lower reactivation of latent herpesviruses and 
inflammation. Moreover, reactivation of latent herpesviruses partially mediated the association 
between SRH and inflammation. Accordingly, findings add to our growing understanding of the 
association between SRH and immune dysfunction.

 1. Introduction
Individuals are able to report valuable information about their own health. A growing body 
of literature suggests that the people’s subjective determination of their global health status 
is strongly linked to subsequent morbidity and mortality. Such findings have been replicated 
among various age ranges (e.g., Larsson, Hemmingsson, Allebeck, & Lundberg, 2002; 
Nybo, et al., 2003), ethnic groups (e.g., Nielsen et al., 2008; Yu et al., 1998), and patient 
populations (e.g., Bosworth et al., 1999; Jylhä, 2009; Kaplan & Camacho, 1983). 
Interoceptive (i.e., originating within the body) sensations associated with the immune and 
endocrine systems are one hypothesized reason to explain why individuals are able to 
accurately report their global health status (Kaplan & Camacho, 1983). The present study 
focused on how self-reported health (SRH) is associated with reactivation of latent 
herpesviruses among a large and ethnically diverse sample.
When the immune system is dysregulated, people generally exhibit greater disease 
susceptibility, inflammation, and latent herpes virus reactivation (e.g., Fagundes, Glaser, 
Malarkey, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2013; Jaremka, Glaser, Loving, Malarkey, Stowell, & Kiecolt-
Glaser, 2013; Shirtcliff, Coe, & Pollak, 2009). Herpesviruses create latent infections which 
largely remain dormant among infected cells for the rest of their lives; however, the virus 
can be reactivated in those cells and replicate (Cacioppo et al., 2002; Glaser & Kiecolt-
Glaser, 1994; Yang, Marketon, Chen, Lo, Kim, & Glaser, 2010).
Maladaptive alterations in cellular immune function can enhance herpesvirus reactivation 
and replication, resulting in elevated herpesvirus antibody titers (Steptoe et al., 2007; Glaser 
& Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005; Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1994). For example, organ transplant 
patients have elevated herpesvirus antibody titers (Gray et al., 1995). Although usually 
asymptomatic, elevated herpesvirus antibody titers reflect poor cellular immune system 
control over viral latency (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1994). Psychological stress can also 
dysregulate cellular immunity, and enhance latent herpesvirus reactivation (Glaser & 
Kiecolt-Glaser, 1994). Importantly, chronically stressed low SES individuals have higher 
antibody titers to latent herpesviruses (Stowe, Peek, Cutchin, & Goodwin, 2010a). 
Additionally, dementia caregivers had greater herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) antibody 
titers compared with demographically matched controls (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1997).
The vast majority of the literature on reactivation of herpesviruses has focused on the 
Epstein - Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and HSV-1 because these 
herpesviruses are ubiquitous in adulthood (e.g., Simanek, Dowd, & Aiello, 2009; Steptoe et 
al., 2007; Stowe et al., 2010a; Stowe, Peek, Cutchin, & Goodwin, 2012a). Being seropositive 
for multiple herpesviruses does not always lead to problematic symptoms; however, greater 
herpesvirus burden, evidenced by continuous levels of antibody titers for each pathogen, is 
associated with higher inflammation (e.g., Nazmi et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2000). Indeed, 
elevated antibody titers to herpesviruses can promote increases in inflammatory markers 
such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein 
(CRP) (Fagundes et al., 2012a; Simanek, Dowd, Pawelec, Melzer, Dutta, & Aiello, 2011; 
Stassen, Vega-Córdova, Vliegen, & Bruggeman, 2006). One consequence of elevated 
inflammation is increased risk of disease, especially in older adults (Steptoe et al., 2007). In

 particular, older adults who have chronically elevated proinflammatory cytokines are at 
greater risk for some cancers, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, among other diseases 
of older adulthood (Ershler & Keller, 2000; Libby, 2007).
The association between SRH and herpesvirus antibody titers has yet to be examined. Given 
that people’s subjective determination of their health status is related to inflammation (e.g., 
Christian, Iams, Porter, & Leblebicioglu, 2013; Undén et al., 2007) and subsequent 
morbidity and mortality risk, and latent herpesvirus reactivation reflects poor cellular 
immune function that can promote elevated levels of inflammation, a link between SRH and 
herpesvirus antibody titers is likely. Therefore, we expected that poorer SRH would be 
associated with higher antibody titers to herpesviruses. Additionally, we sought to replicate 
the association between SRH and inflammation and examine if antibody titers partially 
explained (or mediated) this association.
2. Material and methods
2.1 Participants and Procedure
Data were obtained from the Texas City Stress and Health Study, which was part of a larger 
study focusing on the health of Hispanic individuals by the Center for Population Health and 
Health Disparities. An exhaustive listing of households in Texas City, Texas was created and 
households were classified as non-Hispanic White, U.S. born Hispanic, Foreign born 
Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black (Peek et al., 2010). One in eight non-Hispanic White and 
non-Hispanic Black households were selected for the study, with one adult aged 25+ 
randomly selected from the household. One adult aged 25-64 was randomly selected from 
all U.S. and foreign born Hispanic households that did not have an adult aged 65+. All U.S. 
and foreign born Hispanic adults aged 65+ were selected for participation. Informed consent 
was obtained from all participants, and the protocol was approved by the University of Texas 
Medical Branch Institutional Review Board.
Approximately 80% of individuals who were selected to participate in the study agreed to be 
interviewed in their homes, yielding a sample size of 2,706. Of those, 1,459 individuals 
elected to provide blood samples for the present study. A total of 251 individuals were 
excluded due to being seronegative for one or more herpesviruses (described below), 
yielding a final sample of 1,208. A trained phlebotomist drew blood between 9:00 and 12:00 
in the morning at the participant’s household or a centrally located clinic. Blood samples 
were centrifuged to obtain plasma, and were batch analyzed to minimize variation between 
assays (described in detail below).
2.2 Measures
2.2.1 Self-reported health—The RAND SF-36 (SF-36) is a 36-item measure containing 
eight multi-item subscales: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role 
limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, pain, general well-being, social 
functioning, and general health (Ware & Sherbourne, 1992). The SF-36 is a widely utilized 
measure evidencing strong psychometric characteristics (Ware & Sherbourne, 1992). The 
five item general health subscale was utilized as an indicator of SRH in the present study.

 All items on the general health subscale include five response choices ranging from 1 to 5 
which are recoded to reflect a scale ranging from 0 to 100 such that higher scores are 
associated with more optimal functioning.
2.2.2 Reactivation of herpesviruses—CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels 
were evaluated using enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Foster City, CA) as described 
previously (Stowe et al., 2012a). Substrate slides and control sera that were commercially 
prepared (Microgen Laboratories, La Marque, TX, USA; Bion Enterprises, Park Ridge, IL, 
USA) were utilized to determine IgG antibody titers to EBV viral capsid antigen (EBV-
VCA), EBV early antigen (EBV-EA), and HSV-1 as described previously (Peek, Cutchin, 
Freeman, Stowe, & Goodwin, 2009). The majority of participants were seropositive for EBV 
(99.7%), HSV-1 (99.7%), and CMV (82.8%); however, a total of 251 participants were not 
seropositive for one of the herpesviruses and were subsequently removed from the analyses. 
Each of the four indicators of viral reactivation was z-standardized and then averaged to 
form an overall indicator of reactivation of herpesviruses.
2.2.3 Inflammation—Standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods 
were utilized to measure CRP, TNF-receptor 1 (TNF-r1), and IL-6. TNF-r1 was utilized 
instead of TNF-α given that TNF- α has a short half-life of approximately 15 minutes and 
TNF-r1 is more easily detectible than TNF- α (e.g., Stowe et al., 2012b). Furthermore, 
TNF-r1 has been described as a surrogate marker of TNF- α (e.g., Schröder, Kremer, 
Stüber, Gallati, & Schade, 1995). Each indicator of inflammation was z-standardized and 
values were averaged in order to form an overall indicator of inflammation.
2.2.3 Control variables—During the interview, participants provided self-reports of their 
age and sex. Furthermore, a body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each participant after 
measuring height and weight before blood was drawn. These variables were chosen to be 
covariates in our analyses given evidence that age, sex, and body mass index are associated 
with SRH (e.g., Cheng, Chen, Chen, Burr, & Hasselhorn, 2013; Wang & Arah, 2015). 
Additionally, age, sex, and BMI are associated with reactivation of herpesviruses and 
inflammation (Bennett, Glaser, Malarkey, Beversdorf, Pen, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2012; Dowd, 
Haan, Blythe, Moore, & Aiello, 2008; Hinojosa, Boyd, & Orihuela, 2009; Stowe et al., 
2012b; Suarez, 2008; Stowe et al., 2010a). We also included socioeconomic status (i.e., 
participant reported number of years of education; Fagundes et al., 2012b; Fagundes, Jones, 
Vichaya, Lu, & Cleeland, 2014) as a covariate in ancillary analyses given evidence that 
socioeconomic status is associated with SRH, herpesvirus reactivation, and inflammation 
(e.g., Stowe et al., 2010a; Wang & Arah, 2015).
2.3 Analytic Strategy
SPSS statistical software (IBM, 2012) was utilized for all analyses. A one-way analysis of 
variance was conducted in order to examine group differences by race/ethnicity. Bivariate 
correlations between primary study variables were also calculated. A linear regression was 
conducted to evaluate how SRH was associated with antibody titers and inflammation above 
and beyond age, sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI. A mediation analysis, which included 
generating a 95% confidence interval for the indirect effect using 5,000 bootstrap samples

 (Hayes, 2013) to examine if antibody titer levels explained the association between SRH and 
inflammation, was also conduced.
3. Results
As seen in Table 1, a one-way analysis of variance revealed that non-Hispanic White 
participants were significantly older than U.S. born Hispanics, foreign born Hispanics, and 
non-Hispanic Blacks. Foreign born Hispanics were significantly younger than non-Hispanic 
Black participants. Non-Hispanic Whites had significantly lower BMIs than non-Hispanic 
Blacks. EBV-VCA was significantly higher in non-Hispanic Blacks as compared to foreign 
born Hispanics. EBV-EA was significantly lower in foreign born Hispanics as compared to 
non-Hispanic Whites, U.S. born Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Blacks. Non-Hispanic Whites 
demonstrated significantly lower HSV-1 than U.S and foreign born Hispanics, and non-
Hispanic Blacks. CRP was significantly higher in non-Hispanic Blacks as compared to U.S. 
and foreign born Hispanics. Non-Hispanic Whites demonstrated significantly higher TNF-r1 
than foreign born Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks.
Bivariate correlations (see Table 2) revealed that better SRH was associated with lower 
antibody titers. The association between better SRH and lower antibody titers remained 
when controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (see Table 3). Similarly, 
better SRH was associated with lower inflammation before and after control variables were 
entered into the model, replicating prior findings (e.g., Christian et al., 2013). As seen in 
Figure 1, poorer self-reported health was associated with higher inflammation and 
reactivation of herpesviruses partially mediated this association as a significant indirect 
effect was identified. Such findings were replicated when utilizing a single-item from the 
general health scale on the SF-36 that is often utilized to measure self-reported health when 
brevity is needed (e.g., Jylhä, 2009). All findings remained significant with socioeconomic 
status included as an additional covariate in ancillary analyses.
4. Discussion
This is the first study to our knowledge that demonstrates poorer SRH is associated with 
elevated antibody titers to herpesviruses. Such findings are in line with prior research 
indicating that those with high antibody titers have poor health outcomes (Steptoe et al., 
2007). Moreover, the literature is extended via results indicating that antibody titers partially 
mediated the association between SRH and inflammation, a well-known association in the 
literature (e.g., Christian et al., 2013). Indeed, those with poorer cellular immune system 
control over viral latency demonstrate higher production of proinflammatory cytokines 
(Fagundes et al., 2012a; Simanek, Dowd, Pawelec, Melzer, Dutta, & Aiello, 2011; Stassen, 
Vega-Córdova, Vliegen, & Bruggeman, 2006), and this process is important for SRH given 
present study findings. Accordingly, future work may benefit from incorporating measures 
of herpesviruses reactivation into studies of SRH in order to develop a better understanding 
of how SRH is associated with morbidity and mortality.
Findings provide further evidence that individuals are able to accurately report their health to 
some extent. Indeed, SRH was associated with reactivation of latent herpesviruses and

 inflammation, consistent with the hypothesis that individuals may be able to sense immune 
dysregulation (Kaplan & Camacho, 1983). SRH is consistently associated with use of 
physician services and mortality (e.g., Miilunpalo, Vuori, Oja, Pasanen, & Urponen, 1997), 
indicating that individuals tend to be accurate when reporting on their health. It will be 
important to measure SRH, antibody titers, inflammation, and health outcomes in future 
longitudinal studies to elucidate present study findings.
EBV and CMV reactivation reflect poorer cellular immune system control over viral latency 
and they are influenced by different mechanisms. In vivo studies indicate that certain 
neuroendocrine interactions influence some herpesviruses differently than others (Glaser, 
Kiecolt-Glaser, Speicher, & Holliday, 1985; Kiecolt-Glaser, Garner, Speicher, Penn, 
Holliday, & Glaser, 1984; Kiecolt-Glaser & Glaser, 1987; Yang et al., 2010). Indeed, latent 
EBV and CMV had different patterns of reactivation during academic stress and space flight 
(Matalka, Sidki, Abdul-Malik, & Thewaini, 2000; Mehta, Stowe, Feiveson, Tyring, & 
Pierson, 2000). Accordingly, it is likely that the neuroendocrine system is an important 
mechanism underlying associations between self-reported health and immune markers 
which should be examined in future research.
The cross-sectional design of the current study limited our ability to examine the interplay 
between SRH, antibody titers, and inflammation over time. This is important to elucidate in 
future longitudinal research studies given that heightened inflammation is associated with 
increased sickness behaviors (e.g., Dantzer & Kelley, 2007). Furthermore, a large proportion 
of our sample was older, a time which is already marked by dysregulated immunity (e.g., Aw 
et al., 2007). It is important to evaluate associations between SRH, reactivation of 
herpesviruses, and inflammation among younger populations to provide a better 
understanding of the time course of present study findings. Additionally, we utilized the 5-
item measure of self-reported health as opposed to the frequently utilized single-item 
measure (e.g., Jylhä, 2009) given evidence that multi-item measures demonstrate better 
predictive validity than single-item measures (e.g., Gardner, Cummings, Dunham, & Pierce, 
1998; Wanous, Reichers, & Hudy, 1997). However, findings were consistent when including 
the single-item from the SF-36 as an independent variable as opposed to the 5-item version, 
suggesting that present study findings can be integrated into the literature in which both 
single- and multi-item measures of self-reported health are utilized.
5. Conclusions
Current findings add to our growing understanding of the association between SRH and 
immune dysfunction. Poorer SRH was associated with higher reactivation of herpesviruses, 
providing an extension to the literature. Moreover, reactivation of herpesviruses partially 
mediated the association between SRH and inflammation. As such, SRH is associated with 
increased reactivation of herpesviruses that may, in turn, trigger inflammatory responses that 
are involved in a number of age related diseases.
