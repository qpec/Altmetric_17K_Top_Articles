ABSTRACT
Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is a key regulator of epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) during embryogenesis and in tumors. The effect 
of TGFβ, on ΕΜΤ, is conveyed by induction of the pro-invasive transcription factor 
Snail1. In this study, we report that TGFβ stimulates Snail1 sumoylation in aggressive 
prostate, breast and lung cancer cells. Sumoylation of Snail1 lysine residue 234 
confers its transcriptional activity, inducing the expression of classical EMT genes, 
as well as TGFβ receptor I (TβRI) and the transcriptional repressor Hes1. Mutation 
of Snail1 lysine residue 234 to arginine (K234R) abolished sumoylation of Snail1, 
as well as its migratory and invasive properties in human prostate cancer cells. An 
increased immunohistochemical expression of Snail1, Sumo1, TβRI, Hes1, and c-Jun 
was observed in aggressive prostate cancer tissues, consistent with their functional 
roles in tumorigenesis.
INTRODUCTION
Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is a 
versatile cytokine implicated in crucial cellular processes 
such as embryogenesis, differentiation, proliferation, 
apoptosis, and tissue repair [1, 2]. TGFβ was discovered 
in 1980 and was originally given its name because of 
its ability to promote anchorange-independent growth 
of rat fibroblasts. In contrast, TGFβ was later found to 
inhibit proliferation of epithelial cells and maintain their 
homeostasis; Thus TGFβ has both pro-tumorigenic and 
tumor suppressive effects [1, 3-5]. TGFβ exhibits its 
growth-suppressive effects at initial stages by limiting cell 
proliferation and cell migration, and inducing apoptosis 
in normal epithelial cells [6, 7]. At later stages, however, 
TGFβ promotes tumor growth by evading these inhibitory 
signals and instead triggering other cellular processes 
such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 
enabling cells to become motile and traverse to distant 
organs and metastasize [6, 8]. 
TGFβ signals by forming a heterotetrameric 
complex of two types of serine/threonine receptor kinases, 
the TGFβ receptors (TβRs) II and I [9]. Ligand binding 
to the TβR complex activates the TβRI kinase, which 
phosphorylates the receptor-associated Smads (R-Smads) 
2 and 3, at their extreme C-terminal motifs, allowing them 
to form complexes with the co-Smad, Smad 4 [10-12]. The 
trimeric Smad complexes then translocate to the nucleus 
and promote TGFβ-induced transcriptional responses by 
binding to the Smad Binding Elements (SBEs) composed 
of the sequence CAGACA on the DNA [13, 14]. 
Intriguingly, TGFβ also drives transcriptional 
responses through other signaling pathways, referred 
to as non-Smad signaling, e.g. via ERK, JNK, and p38 
mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) [7, 15, 16]. In 
this context, our group has identified that the E3 ligase 
tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) associated factor 
6 (TRAF6) plays a pivotal role in non-Smad signaling 
pathways [17]. TGFβ induced oligomerization of TβRII-
TβRI complex promotes auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6

and subsequent activation of the TAK1-MKK3/6-p38-
MAPK pathway [17-19]. TRAF6 also promotes cleavage 
of TβRI by activating the proteolytic proteases TACE 
(TNF-α converting enzyme), known as ADAM17, and 
presenilin1, in the ecto- and transmembrane regions, 
respectively [20, 21]. The cleaved TβRI-intracellular 
domain (TβRI-ICD) translocates to the nucleus where it 
binds to the transcription regulator p300 and activates pro-
invasive genes, such as Snail1 and MMP2 [22].
One of the hallmarks of the EMT process is the 
repression of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and 
occludin, and upregulation of mesenchymal markers 
such as vimentin, N-cadherin, and fibronectin1[23]. Key 
transcriptional regulators, such as Snail1, Twist1, Zeb1, 
and Slug play pivotal roles in this process [24]. 
TGFβ is well known to drive the EMT process by 
inducing the expression of Snail1 and other transcription 
factors, thereby regulating the expression of crucial 
mesenchymal markers [25] [26]. Interaction between 
signaling components of the TGFβ family and Snail1 
has been reported. Smad3 and Smad4 form a complex 
with Snail1, driving EMT in breast carcinomas [27]. 
The high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) protein directly 
binds to the Snail1 promoter and acts as a transcriptional 
regulator of Snail1 expression [28]. Snail1 has also been 
reported to bind to its own promoter and regulate its own 
expression [29]. Previously, we have reported that the 
AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun binds to a distal region 
of the Snail1 promoter and thereby promotes invasion of 
prostate cancer cells [30, 31]. 
Moreover, various post-translational modifications 
regulate the stability and activity of Snail1 protein 
expression. For instance, Snail1 has been reported to 
undergo polyubiquitination in the nucleus by F-box 
protein FBXL5, thereby hampering Snail1 ability to bind 
to DNA [32]. Sumoylation i.e. the conjugation of a small 
ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to the target substrate, 
regulates protein stability, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, 
active gene transcription, chromosome organization and 
DNA repair [33]. Conjugation of sumo moieties to the 
target lysine residue occurs either by monoSUMOylation 
or by attachment of SUMO chains (polySUMOylation) 
[34, 35].
Although it has been reported that there is cross-
talk between Smads and Snail1, it is still unclear 
which downstream targets of Snail1 promote EMT in 
TGFβ stimulated cells. In this study, we explored the 
downstream regulators of Snail1, and found that Snail1 
regulates both mRNA and protein expression of TβRI and 
the transcriptional repressor Hes1. Moreover, we observe 
that knockdown of the TβRI decreases the expression of 
Hes1 and EMT-related genes. We also found that TGFβ 
promotes sumoylation of Snail1. Moreover, mutagenesis 
of Snail1 lysine residue 234 to arginine (K234R) abolished 
sumoylation of Snail1, its transcriptional activity, and 
migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. 
RESULTS
Snail1 regulates TβRI expression
To investigate whether Snail1 regulates the 
expression of TβRI, we silenced the endogenous 
expression of Snail1 by using siRNA or non-targeting 
control siRNA in PC-3U cells and probed with 
antibodies directed against TβRI. Downregulation of 
Snail1 expression by siRNA#1 or siRNA#2 decreased 
TβRI protein (TβRI) expression (Figure 1A and 
Supplementary Figure 1A). Moreover, silencing of 
Snail1 decreased TβRI mRNA expression, as determined 
by RT-PCR analysis (Figure 1B). Downregulation of 
Snail1 expression was confirmed at both the protein 
and mRNA levels (Figure 1A, 1C, and Supplementary 
Figure 1A). Because R-Smads (Smad2, Smad3) are the 
downstream regulators of TβRI, we investigated the 
effects of silencing of Snail1, on the phosphorylation of 
Smad2 by using phospho-specific antibodies; treatment 
with siSnail1 reduced the phosphorylation of Smad2 
(Figure 1A). Moreover, the mRNA expression of the 
TGFβ target gene Smad7 also decreased in the absence 
of Snail1 (Figure 1D). As downregulation of endogenous 
Snail1 expression decreased phosphorylation of Smad2, 
we investigated if the downregulation of TβRI by Snail1, 
inhibits Smads to bind to the Smad Binding Elements 
(SBEs) by performing Smad-specific promoter reporter 
assays by transfecting CAGA12-Luc reporters in siCtrl 
or siSnail1 treated PC-3U cells. Treatment with TGFβ 
for 24 h significantly enhanced CAGA12-Luc reporter 
activity in siCtrl treated cells compared to siSnail1 treated 
cells (Figure 1E). Next, we confirmed our findings that 
Snail1 downregulates TβRI protein expression in Snail1-
deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). The TGFβ-
enhanced expression of TβRI protein expression observed 
in Snail1+/+ MEFs was suppressed in Snail1-/- MEFs 
(Figure 1F). Probing with phospho-Smad2 antiserum 
confirmed that TβRI stimulation caused phosphorylation 
of Smad2 only in Snail1+/+ MEFs, but not in Snail1-/- 
MEFs (Figure 1F). Moreover, re-introduction of HA-
Snail1 in Snail1-/- MEFs partially rescued the expression 
of TβRI and phosphorylation of Smad2 (Figure 1F). By 
confocal imaging we observed that TGFβ stimulation 
of cells, enhanced the intensity and co-localization of 
TβRI and Snail1 in siCtrl treated cells but not in siSnail1 
treated cells (Supplementary Figure 2A). We confirmed 
our findings in Snail1 deficient MEFs; whereas TGFβ 
treatment greatly enhanced the co-localisation of TβRI 
and Snail1 in Snail1+/+ MEFs, this was not seen in Snail1-/- 
MEFs (Supplementary Figure 2B). These results suggest 
that Snail1 enhances both mRNA and protein expression 
of TβRI.

Snail1 interacts with TβRI 
Having observed that Snail1 regulates TβRI, we 
investigated if Snail1 forms a complex with TβRI in 
PC-3U cells. Interestingly, TGFβ induced a transient co-
immunoprecipitation of endogenous Snail1 with TβRI-
intracellular domain (TβRI-ICD) upon TGFβ stimulation 
(Figure 2A). By using proximity ligation assays (PLA), 
we confirmed that TGFβ treatment enhances Snail1-
TβRI interaction in PC-3U cells (Figure 2B) and also in 
the highly invasive human breast cancer cell line MDA-
MB-231 (Supplementary Figure 3). Moreover, confocal 
imaging showed that TGFβ stimulates co-localization 
between Snail1 and TβRI in the nuclear compartment in 
PC-3U cells (Figure 2C). These results suggest that TGFβ 
promotes interaction of TβRI and Snail1, in aggressive 
prostate and breast cancer cells.
To further investigate the interaction between 
Snail1 and TβRI, we ectopically co-expressed GFP-
tagged TβRI and HA-Snail1 in PC-3U cells. As expected, 
TGFβ stimulated an interaction between GFP-TβRI and 
HA-Snail1 (Supplementary Figure 4A). Using confocal 
imaging, we observed that TGFβ stimulation promoted 
the co-localization of GFP-TβRI and HA-Snail1 in the 
nuclear compartment, although a small amount of proteins 
co-localized also in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure 
4B). Next, we ectopically co-expressed Flag-tagged 
TβRI and HA-Snail1 in PC-3U cells; consistent with 
our previous finding, we observed TGFβ-dependent 
interaction between Flag-TβRI-ICD and HA-Snail1, 
further confirming that TGFβ stimulates complex 
formation between TβRI-ICD and Snail1 (Supplementary 
Figure 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that 
Snail1 forms a complex with TβRI-ICD, in the nucleus of 
TGFβ-treated prostate and breast cancer. 
Snail1 promotes EMT genes.
Because Snail1 has been implicated as a major 
contributor to the EMT process, we performed qRT-PCR 
experiments to investigate if the mesenchymal genes are 
regulated by Snail1 in response to TGFβ. TGFβ triggered 
a Snail1-dependent upregulation of Fibronectin1, 
N-cadherin, and the Notch responsive gene Jagged1 
(Supplementary Figure 5A-5C). Moreover, Snail1 
downregulation decreased the expression of other EMT 
regulators such as Zeb1, Slug, and Twist1 (Supplementary 
Figure 5D-5F).
Snail1 regulates Hes1 expression 
Hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) is an important 
transcriptional co-repressor implicated in Notch signaling. 
Interestingly, Hes1 has also been reported to play crucial 
role in EMT [38]. To investigate if Snail1 regulates 
Hes1 expression, we next silenced endogenous Snail1 
expression by siRNA#1 or siRNA#2 and probed with 
antibodies specific to Hes1. Silencing Snail1 expression 
decreased Hes1 expression, suggesting that Snail1 
enhances Hes1 expression (Figure 3A and Supplementary 
Figure 1A). qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that Hes1 
mRNA expression decreased in siSnail1 treated cells 
compared to siCtrl treated cells (Figure 3B). Moreover, 
we found that overexpression of HA-Snail1, or TGFβ 
stimulation of PC-3U cells, enhanced the expression of 
the transcriptional repressor Hes1 (Supplementary Figure 
6A). Also, re-introduction of HA-Snail1 in Snail1-/- 
MEFs rescued the expression of Hes1 (Figure 3C). 
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further showed 
that TGFβ treatment for 1 h induced an interaction 
between endogenous Snail1 and Hes1 (Figure 3D). 
Confocal imaging of PC-3U cells treated with TGFβ for 
1 h, revealed a co-localization of endogenous Hes1 and 
Snail1 (Figure 3E) Moreover, a PLA showed that TGFβ 
stimulation of cells significantly increased Hes1-Snail1 
complexes in the nucleus (Figure 3F). These results 
suggest that Snail1 regulates Hes1 expression and that 
Snail1 interacts with Hes1 in the nucleus after 1 h of TGFβ 
treatment.
Overexpression of HA-Snail1 promotes TβRI 
expression
To further evaluate our finding that Snail1 regulates 
TβRI expression, we overexpressed HA-Snail1 at 
increasing concentrations and investigated the amount 
of TβRI protein by immunoblotting with antibodies 
against TβRI. HA-Snail1 overexpression at increasing 
concentrations enhanced expression of TβRI-FL and 
also TβRI-ICD expression upon TGFβ stimulation 
(Supplementary Figure 6B). qRT-PCR data revealed 
that overexpression of HA-Snail1 or TGFβ stimulation 
of PC-3U cells, enhanced mRNA expression of TβRI 
(Supplementary Figure 6C). 
The qRT-PCR data also supported the finding 
that TGFβ stimulation enhanced the mRNA expression 
of Hes1 at increasing concentrations of HA-Snail1 
overexpression; however, at 6 µg concentration TGFβ 
stimulation decreased expression of TβRI and did not 
affect Hes1 expression (Supplementary Figure 6C, D). As 
expected, TGFβ stimulation enhanced the Snail1 mRNA 
expression (Supplementary Figure 6E). 
TβRI induces Hes1 expression 
We reported previously that TβRI-ICD translocates 
to the nucleus, where it binds to the Snail1 promoter 
[20]. To further explore other co-transcriptional targets 
regulated by TβRI-ICD, we silenced TβRI expression by 
siRNA and investigated the effect on the Notch responsive

gene Hes1. Silencing TβRI expression decreased the 
expression of Hes1 giving further evidence that Hes1 is a 
TβRI responsive gene (Figure 4A). qRT-PCR experiments 
confirmed that downregulation of TβRI in PC-3U cells 
significantly decreased Hes1 mRNA expression (Figure 
4B, 4C). Moreover, treatment of PC-3U cells with siRNA 
specific for endogenous TβRI, decreased Hes1 expression 
as visualized by confocal imaging (Figure 4D).

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that 
Hes1 and TβRI form a complex in a TGFβ dependent 
manner after 1 h of TGFβ stimulation of cells (Figure 
5A). Confocal imaging supported this finding as TGFβ 
promoted formation of a complex between endogenous 
Hes1 and TβRI in the nucleus (Figure 5B). PLA assays 
also confirmed that Hes1 and TβRI interact, and that 
their interaction in the nucleus is enhanced upon TGFβ 
stimulation (Figure 5C). These results suggest that Hes1 
is a TβRI responsive gene and TGFβ promotes interaction 
and co-localization of TβRI and Hes1 in the nucleus.
Treatment with TβRI kinase inhibitors decreases 
Hes1 expression 
As we have observed that Hes1 and TβRI interact 
and form a complex in the nucleus, we investigated if 
the kinase activity of TβRI is required for Hes1 protein 
expression. Treatment with a commonly used and potent 
TβRI inhibitor; SB-431542 decreased the expression of 
Hes1 and, as expected, the phosphorylation of Smad2 
(Figure 6A). Next, we ectopically overexpressed c.a. 
TβRI in PC-3U cells and treated them with the TβRI 
kinase inhibitor SB-431542. Consistent with our previous 
finding, Hes1 expression decreased upon treatment with 
the TβRI kinase inhibitor, when compared with untreated 
cells (Figure 6B). However, Snail1 expression was not 
affected by SB-431542 treatment (Figure 6B), in line 
with our previous reports that TβRI in the non-canonical 
signaling pathway, can promote transcription of Snail 
 
[21]. To validate our findings, we used also another TβRI 
inhibitor; SB-505124 (Figure 6C), and obtained similar 
results regarding Hes1 expression, as shown in Figure 
6A. Taken together, these results suggest that the kinase 
activity of TβRI is required for Hes1 expression.
Next, we performed qRT-PCR experiments 
with RNA extracted from these samples. Hes1 mRNA 
expression decreased significantly upon treatment with the 
TβRI kinase inhibitors SB-431542 or SB-505124 (Figure 
6D, 6G); in contrast, Snail1 and TβRI expression was 
partially decreased upon TGFβ stimulation (Figure 6E, 
6H), (Figure 6F, 6I). These results further corroborate the 
notion that TβRI induces Hes1 expression and the kinase 
activity of the TβRI is required for the regulation of Hes1 
expression.
Overexpression of HA-TβRI enhances Hes1 
expression
Since we observed that silencing of TβRI decreased 
Hes1 expression, we next investigated if overexpression 
of HA-TβRI could affect regulation of Hes1. Results from 
qRT-PCR analysis, showed an enhanced expression of 
Hes1 upon TGFβ stimulation at increasing concentrations 
of HA-TβRI (Supplementary Figure 7A), suggesting that 
Hes1 is a target gene of TβRI. However, the expression 
of Snail1 and Twist1 was slightly enhanced upon TGFβ 
stimulation at increasing concentrations of HA-TβRI, 
but not as much as in TGFβ-stimulated cells alone 
(Supplementary Figure 7B-7C). As expected, TGFβ 
stimulation enhanced the expression of TβRI mRNA 
(Supplementary Figure 7D). These results further 
strengthen the notion that TβRI regulates Hes1 expression.
TβRI induces EMT genes
Since we observe that Snail1 regulates TβRI 
expression and since Snail1 is a bonafide master regulator 
of EMT genes, we investigated if the Snail1 regulated 
EMT genes are affected upon downregulation of TβRI. 
Treatment with TGFβ in the control cells upregulated 
mesenchymal genes, such as Fibronectin1, N-cadherin, 
the Notch responsive gene Jagged1, and Zeb1, compared

also the classical TGFβ target genes; Smad7 and PAI-1

for 0.25 h induced a band at 40 kDa corresponding to 
polysumolyated Snail1 (Figure 7A). Next, we ectopically 
expressed HA-Sumo1 in PC-3U cells and treated with 
TGFβ, or not, and performed sumoylation assays. We 
observed a band at 40 kDa, which had the expected size 
of sumoylated Snail1 (Figure 7B). To further validate 
our findings, we performed in vitro sumoylation assays. 
Incubation of His-Snail1 with Sumo1 generated a band at 
46 kDa, suggesting that His-Snail1 is sumoylated in vitro 
(Figure 7C). As a positive control RanGAP1 was used and 
found to be sumoylated in presence, but not in the absence 
of magnesium-ATP (Mg-ATP), which is essential for the 
conjugation of the substrate to the E1 activation enzyme 
and hence are derived from the SUMO cascade. These 
results showed that Snail1 was sumoylated by Sumo1 in 
vitro (Figure 7C). However, in vitro sumoylation assays 
with Sumo2 did not induce a product (Supplementary 
Figure 9). In addition, to investigate if sumoylation of 
Snail1 can be observed also in other cancer cells, we 
ectopically expressed HA-Sumo1 in breast cancer cells 
MDA-MB-231, and lung cancer cells A549. The cells were 
then treated with TGFβ, or not, and sumoylation assays 
were performed. TGFβ treatment of these cancer cells 
resulted also in sumoylation of Snail1, Supplementary

Figure 10A, 10B. By using confocal imaging, we observed 
that TGFβ promotes a co-localization between Sumo1 
and Snail1 in PC-3U cells (Figure 7D). Moreover, a PLA 
assay also showed that Snail1 and Sumo1 interact in a 
TGFβ-dependent manner in PC-3U, MDA-MB-231, and 
A549 cells (Figure 7E, Supplementary Figure 10C, 10D). 
Taken together, these results suggest that TGFβ stimulates 
sumoylation of Snail1, in aggressive prostate, breast and 
lung cancer cells.
Lysine 234 is required for Sumo1 modification of 
Snail1
As we have observed that Snail1 is sumoylated upon 
TGFβ treatment, we investigated the possible acceptor 
lysine residue in Snail1 that is subjected to sumoylation. 
Using in silico analysis, we identified K234 as a possible 
acceptor lysine residue for Sumoylation of Snail1, 
(Figure 8A). Therefore, we generated a K234R mutant 
Snail1 by mutating K234 to arginine. We transiently 
transfected either wild type Snail1 (wt Snail1) or K234R 
mutant Snail1 in PC-3U cells and performed cell based 
sumoylation assays. Treatment with TGFβ induced a band 
corresponding to 40 kDa only in wt-Snail1 transfected 
group but not in cells transfected with K234R mutant 
Snail1 (Figure 8B), suggesting that K234R is a major 
acceptor lysine in Snail1 for sumoylation. By confocal 
imaging, we showed that Snail1 and Sumo1 co-localize 
and form a complex only in wt-Snail1 transfected cells 
but not in cells transfected with the K234R mutant Snail1 
(Figure 8C), further confirming that the K234R is a crucial 
sumoylation site in Snail1. By PLA assays we observed 
that wt Snail1, but not the K234R mutant, interacted 
with Sumo1 in a TGFβ-dependent manner (Figure 8D). 
Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that wt-Snail1 
promoted transcription of other EMT inducers, such as 
Slug, Zeb1, and TβRI, c-Jun, and TGFβ responsive genes 
such as Smad7 and PAI-1, in transiently transfected PC-
3U cells, but not K234R mutant (Supplementary Figure 
11A-11F). These results suggest that lysine 234 is an 
acceptor residue for sumoylation of Snail1, as mutation 
of lysine 234 to arginine (K234R) abolished Snail1 
sumoylation, and its capability to promote transcription 
of EMT genes. 
Sumoylation-deficient K234R mutant Snail1 does 
not promote migration and invasion
To investigate the functional properties of the 
sumoylation-deficient 
K234R 
mutant 
Snail1, 
we 
performed cell migration assays in PC-3U cells transfected 
with either wt-Snail1 or K234R mutant Snail1. Using 
scratch assays, in the presence or absence of TGFβ 
treatment, we found that wt Snail1, but not K234R mutant 
Snail1, promoted migration of PC-3U cells (Figure 9A). 
As Snail1 is regarded as the master regulator of the 
EMT program and as invasiveness is considered to be a 
hallmark of cells undergoing EMT, we next performed 
invasive assays in PC-3U cells transfected with either 
wt or K234R mutant Snail1. TGFβ treatment for 24 h 
conferred invasiveness only in cells transfected with wt 
Snail1, but not in cells transfected with K234R mutant 
Snail1 (Figure 9B, 9C). These results further supports 
the notion that sumoylation deficient-Snail1 is unable to 
promote migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells.
TGFβ promotes Snail1 and c-Jun interaction and 
co-localization
We have previously reported that c-Jun binds to 
the Snail1 promoter and regulates Snail1 expression. We 
investigated if Snail1 and c-Jun interact, by performing 
an endogenous co-immunoprecipitation assay; treatment 
with TGFβ enhanced interaction between Snail1 and 
c-Jun (Figure 10A). Confocal imaging and PLA assays 
also supported the notion that Snail1 and c-Jun co-localize 
and interact in the nucleus in a TGFβ-dependent manner 
(Figure 10B). Interestingly, only wt-Snail1 interacted with 
c-Jun, while the sumoylation-deficient K234R mutant 
Snail1 did not, suggesting that sumoylation of Snail1 
is required for interaction between Snail1 and c-Jun 
(Supplementary Figure 12). PLA assays also supported our 
finding that Snail1 and c-Jun interact in a TGFβ-dependent 
manner (Figure 10C).
Next, we confirmed our previous finding that c-Jun 
binds to Snail1 promoter by ChIP assays and explored 
the possibility that c-Jun binds to the TβRI promoter 
[30]. Treatment of PC-3U cells with TGFβ enhanced 
c-Jun binding to TβRI and Snail1 promoters (Figure 
10D-10F), suggesting that c-Jun binds to both Snail1 and 
TβRI promoters to regulate their expression. Moreover, 
knockdown of endogenous Snail1 protein expression 
inhibited the binding of c-Jun to the Snail1 and TβRI 
promoters (Figure 10G-10I), suggesting that Snail1 protein 
facilitates binding of c-Jun to the Snail1 promoter. Taken 
together, Snail1 interaction with c-Jun promotes TGFβ-
dependent binding of c-Jun to the Snail1 promoter. In 
addition, by Chip assays we found that c-Jun binds to the 
TβRI promoter only in the presence of wt-Snail1, but not 
in the presence of the K234R mutant Snail1, suggesting 
that K234 is crucial for active gene regulation (Figure 
10J).

immunohistochemical stainings for Snail1, Sumo1, 
TβRI, Hes1 and c-Jun, in prostate cancer tissues. 
Increased positive stainings for Snail1, Sumo1, TβRI, 
Hes1, and c-Jun were found in the investigated prostate 
cancer tissues compared to the normal tissues (Figure 
11A-11J), suggesting that TGFβ-promoted prostate cancer 
progression, involves increased expression of these EMT 
promoting factors. No immunohistochemical stainings 
for Snail1, Sumo1, TβRI, Hes1 and c-Jun was observed 
in control experiment when the primary antibodies were 
omitted) (Supplementary Figure 13A-13E).
DISCUSSION
The bifunctional role of TGFβ as a tumor suppressor 
and tumor promoter is well established [2, 41]. TGFβ 
dictate cellular functional responses by activation of 
canonical Smad and non-Smad signaling cascades [1, 7, 
16]. Previously, we reported that TβRI is cleaved in the 
ectodomain by TACE and in the transmembrane region by 
presenilin1 to liberate an TβRI-ICD [20, 21, 36, 42]. The 
liberated TβRI-ICD translocates to the nucleus where it 
binds to the Snail1 promoter to promote invasion of cancer 
cells. 
Snail1 is a pro-invasive gene regulated by both 
canonical and non-canonical TGFβ signaling members 
[26, 30]. Although Snail1 has been reported to be 
upregulated by TGFβ to promote EMT, the downstream 
targets for Snail1 are not fully understood and was 
the topic for our current investigation. In our quest 
to unravel possible downstream regulators of Snail1, 
we silenced the expression of Snail1 by siRNA and 
found that TβRI expression decreased in the absence of 
Snail1, suggesting that Snail1 regulates TβRI expression 
(Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1) and that treatment of 
prostate cancer cells with TGFβ stimulated formation of 
Snail1 and TβRI-ICD complexes in the nucleus of these 
cancer cells (Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 2 and 4). 
Snail1 has previously been reported to interact with the 
R-Smad, Smad3 and co-Smad, Smad4 to drive EMT in 
breast carcinomas [27]. In this context, Snail1 interaction 
with TβRI and regulation of TβRI expression, is a novel 
mechanism identified in this report by which Snail1 further 
enhance TGFβ signaling and EMT in prostate cancer. 
Hes1 is a key transcriptional target in the notch 
signaling cascade and has also been implicated to play a 
crucial role in cancer metastasis, and EMT [38, 43, 44] and 
elevated Jagged 1 expression has been reported in prostate 
cancer metastasis [45-48]. As we have previously observed 
that the TβRI-ICD forms a complex with the Notch-ICD 
(NICD) in the nucleus [36], we investigated the possibility 
if other Notch targets such as Hes1, is regulated by TβRI-
ICD. Interestingly, downregulation of Snail1 expression 
caused a decreased Hes1 expression, suggesting that Hes1 
is also regulated by Snail1 (Figure 3). Since we observed 
that Snail1 downregulation decreases both TβRI and Hes1 
expression, we also investigated if TβRI is the upstream 
regulator of Hes1. siTβRI treatment decreased the 
expression of Hes1, suggesting that Hes1 is a TβRI target 
gene (Figure 4) and also other EMT genes (Supplementary 
Figure 8). TGFβ treatment induced interaction between 
Hes1 and TβRI (Figure 5), suggesting that nuclear 
translocated TβRI-ICD interacts with Hes1. Our finding 
in this report shows that the TβRI-ICD interacts with Hes1 
and that TβRI regulates Hes1 and Jagged1 expression. The 
current data, along with data from our previous study, in 
which we found that TβRI-ICD and NICD interact [36], 
enhances our knowledge about the common transcriptional 
targets of the TGFβ and the Notch signaling cascades 
[22, 36]. Moreover, the kinase activity of TβRI is crucial 
for regulating the expression of Hes1 but not for Snail1 
expression (Figure 6). As we previously have reported that 
Snail1 expression is independent of TβRI kinase activity, 
Snail1 might be regulated by other signaling cascades such

as NF-κB, Ras, PI3K/Akt and FGF, as it has been reported 
that Snail1 promoter consists of transcriptional binding 
sites for the aforementioned signaling pathway members 
[30, 31, 49]. 
Sumoylation of various proteins has been reported 
to regulate gene transcription, nuclear transport, and 
activation of signal transduction pathways [33]. In our 
study, we have elucidated that TGFβ stimulates Snail1 
sumoylation (Figure 7, 8 and Supplementary Figure 10) 
at lysine 234. Mutation of Snail1 at lysine 234 to arginine 
(K234R) inhibited sumoylation of Snail1, its nuclear 
translocation, and also the TGFβ-induced migratory 
and invasive properties in prostate cancer cells (Figure 
9), suggesting that sumoylation is important for Snail1 
function.
Polyubiquitination of Snail1 by the ubiquitin ligase 
FBXL5 has been reported to disrupt its ability to bind 
to DNA [32]. Moreover, K234 in Snail1 has also been 
identified as one of the three acceptor lysine residues 
(K85, K146, K234) for ubiquitination. However K234 
is modified upto a very less extent compared to full 
length Snail1 protein by FBXL5 and the authors also 
suggested that this ubiquitination modification may not 
lead to degradation, compared to K146, which is known 
to be involved in Snail1 proteosomal degradation both 
by β-TrCP1 and FBXL14, by K48-polyubiquitnation 
[32, 50]. Snail1 has a conserved nuclear localization 
signal (NLS) and is recognized by the importins (β, 
α and 7) and transportin for active transport from 
cytoplasm to the nucleus [51, 52]. Moreover, lysine 
234 has been recognized as one among several residues 
important in Snail1 for DNA binding [51]. In this context, 
sumoylation of Snail1 may be a crucial event for its 
nuclear translocation, as it could be speculated that this 
modification may lead to conformational changes in the 
structure of Sumo1, thereby giving access for importins to 
bind and promote its nuclear transport. 
Snail1 has been reported to bind to its own promoter 
and to regulate its own expression [29]. Previously, we 
reported that TGFβ induced transcription of Snail1 
requires c-Jun and c-Jun binds to specific distal region 
of the Snail1 promoter [30, 31]. Immunoprecipitation 
experiments confirmed that TGFβ stimulates interaction 
and co-localization between Snail1 and c-Jun (Figure 
10). We report here that c-Jun binds to TβRI and Snail1 
promoter to regulate their expression respectively. 
Moreover, TGFβ induced Snail1 protein is crucial for 
c-Jun to bind to TβRI and Snail1 promoters (Figure 10), 
suggesting that the Snail1 transcription factor might recruit 
other co-activators such as c-Jun, to bind to TβRI or to 
its own promoter region. Interestingly, only the wt-Snail1 
promoted c-Jun binding to TβRI promoter, compared to 
the Lysine 234 mutant Snail1, to promote transcription 
of EMT genes, including TβRI and c-Jun (Figure 10, 
Supplementary Figure 11, 12).
Given that Snail1 is a key regulator of the EMT 
program, we also investigated the mRNA expression 
profile of other EMT regulator genes, such as Zeb1, 
Slug, and Twist1. Knockdown of endogenous Snail1 
expression decreased expression of all three regulator 
genes, suggesting that Snail1 is a key inducer of EMT 
(Supplementary Figure 5D-5F). Moreover, Snail1 
enhanced the expression of mesenchymal markers, such 
as Fibronectin1, N-cadherin, and Jagged1 (Supplementary 
Figure 5A-5C). Taken together, these results suggest that 
Snail1 is the master regulator of EMT, controlling the 
expression of EMT genes and interestingly, also TβRI, 
as demonstrated in this report. Remarkably, knockdown 
of endogenous TβRI expression decreased expression 
of Fibronectin1, N-cadherin, and the Notch responsive 
target Jagged1, the EMT regulator Zeb1 (Supplementary 
Figure 8A-8D), the classical TGFβ targets Smad7 and 
PAI-1 (Supplementary Figure 8F-8G). Taken together, 
our data suggest that Snail1-regulated TβRI promotes the 
mesenchymal phenotype and enables the cancer cells to 
become invasive. 
Androgen receptors, which are known to be crucial 
for prostate cancer tumorigenesis, has been reported to 
be sumoylated [53-55]. In this context, our data propose 
that the androgen-independent PC-3U cells, instead utilize 
sumoylated Snail1 to target TβRI to promote prostate 
cancer progression, as we have observed overexpression 
of Snail1, Sumo1, TβRI, Hes1, and c-Jun in prostate 
cancer specimens (Figure 11). These results suggest that 
Snail1 and Sumo1 might be markers for prostate cancer 
progression. As sumoylation inhibitors are currently being 
tested to combat breast cancer tumorigenesis [55], it 
would be interesting to target Snail1 sumoylation to inhibit 
migration and invasion in prostate cancer, as we in this 
report identify sumoylated Snail1 as a crucial modulator 
of the EMT program in androgen independent aggressive 
prostate cancer cells and also in the highly invasive breast 
cancer (MDA-MB-231) and lung cancer cells (A549).

Snail1 and HA-Snail1 was provided by Dr. Antonio García 
de Herreros, Barcelona. HA-Sumo1 was a kind gift from 
Prof. I. Dikic, Frankfurt. 
Transfections
Transient transfections of ectopically expressed 
HA-TβRI or HA-Snail1 were performed with FuGENE® 
6 transfection reagent (Promega) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Transient transfections 
of small-interfering (si) RNA were performed using 
Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA targeting TβRI, 
Snail1, or non-targeting control siRNA were purchased 
from Dharmacon, and Stealth siRNA specific to Snail1 
and non-targeting control siRNA were obtained from 
Invitrogen. 
Site-directed mutagenesis
QuickChange 
Site-Directed 
Mutagenesis 
kit 
(Agilent Technologies) was used to create a K234R 
mutant HA-Snail1 plasmid, following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing 
of the plasmid.
Luciferase reporter assay
Transient transfections of small-interfering (si) 
RNA were performed using Oligofectamine reagent 
(Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Fortyeight hours after siRNA transfection, cells were 
transiently transfected with CAGA12 reporter and renilla 
constructs (internal control) with FuGENE® 6 transfection 
reagent 
(Promega) 
following 
the 
manufacturer’s 
instructions. After starvation, cells were stimulated with 
TGFβ for the indicated time periods. Cells were harvested 
and lysed in lysis buffer (Promega). Triplicates of each 
sample were used for measuring the luciferase activity 
using a luminometer. Values were calculated as follows: 
Luciferase activity of sample = CAGA12 reporter 
activity / renilla reporter activity.
Immunoprecipitation assays and western blotting
After cells were stimulated for the indicated time 
periods, they were washed with PBS and lysed in cold 
RIPA buffer for 20 min at 4°C and centrifuged at 13,000 
rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was taken, and the 
protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein 
assay kit (Nordic Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. For immunoprecipitation, samples were 
incubated with primary antibody overnight; the next 
day, samples were incubated with Protein G Sepharose 
beads (GE Healthcare) at 4°C. Samples were washed 
with RIPA buffer three times and the proteins were 
extracted from the beads in SDS sample buffer containing 
reducing agent and heating at 95°C. Immunoblotting 
was performed by subjecting equal amount of protein 
from each treatment group to SDS-PAGE using 10% 
or 12% Bis-tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Gels 
were run in MOPS buffer (Invitrogen), and protein was 
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot 
Machine (Invitrogen). Quantification of immunoblots 
were performed with Biorad Quantity one software.

biological experiments. Bars are presented as means ± 
SEM and statistical analysis was based on at least three 
independent biological experiments. Differences in the 
means ± SEM between samples were analyzed with two-
way ANOVA with bonferroni post hoc test using SPSS 
software.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy 
PC-3U cells were cultured in six-well dishes in 
the presence of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented 
with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin and 
streptomycin. Cells were transfected with the respective 
plasmids; after 24 h, cells were starved in RPMI-1640 
medium supplemented with 1% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 
and 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and after an additional 
18 h, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of TGFβ1. 
Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde, followed by permeabilization in 2% 
Triton X-100. Cells were blocked in 5% BSA. After 
blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibody 
for 1 h, followed by incubation with secondary donkey 
anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 antibodies or goat anti-mouse 
Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies (Invitrogen). After staining, 
cells were mounted in medium with 4’,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize cell nuclei. Images were 
taken with a confocal microscope with an oil immersion 
63X lens. Zen software was used to analyze the data. 
Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA)
PC-3U cells, untreated or treated with TGFβ, were 
fixed, permeabilized, blocked and probed with the primary 
antibodies as indicated, following the manufacturers 
protocol. Antibodies from different species against TβRI 
(V22), Snail1, Hes1, Sumo1 and c-Jun, were used. 
Next, the cells were incubated with PLA probes (Sigma-
Aldrich), followed by ligation and amplification. Slides 
were mounted with Duolink mounting medium and 
evaluated with a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Images 
were acquired with a 63X objective. Representative 
results are shown from experiments repeated at least three 
times. Cell images were exported in TIF format with Zen 
software (Carl Zeiss) for further analysis; quantification 
of PLA signals were determined with Blob-Finder image 
analysis software, which was developed by the Center for 
Image Analysis, Uppsala University, Sweden.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and RT-PCR
RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy 
Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. A total of 2 µg of RNA was used for cDNA 
synthesis using the Thermoscript cDNA synthesis kit 
(Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed using the Power 
SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Samples 
were run on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-
Time PCR system (Table 1).
Chip assay 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay 
was performed using the SimpleChIP® Plus Enzymatic 
Chromatin IP Kit from Cell Signaling Technology 
following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA and proteins 
were cross-linked in 4% formaldehyde. After shearing of 
the cells the chromatin was precipitated using c-Jun ChIP 
grade antibody, and reverse crosslinked. After purification, 
DNA was amplified using standard PCR and run on 1.5% 
agarose gel or subjected to quantitative RT-PCR with the 
Power SYBR PCR Master Mix.
The following ChIP primers were used (Table 2).

In vitro sumoylation assay
His-Snail1 (RnD Systems) and GST-RanGAP1 
(Enzo Life Sciences) were used as substrates in in vitro 
sumoylation assays, assays were performed following 
the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Enzo Life 
Sciences). His-Snail or GST-RanGAP1 (positive control) 
were incubated with Sumo E1 (Aos1 and Uba2), E2 
(Ubc9), E3 Sumo1 or E3 Sumo2 enzymes in the presence 
or absence of Mg-ATP in sumoylation buffer for 1 h at 
37°C. The reactions were quenched by adding SDS sample 
buffer and heating at 95°C for 5 min. The reaction mixture 
was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Sumo1, anti-
Sumo2 and anti-Snail1 antibodies. 
In vivo sumoylation assay
PC-3U, MDA-MB-231, A549 cells were transfected 
with HA-Sumo1 or non-transfected cells, were stimulated 
with TGFβ for the indicated time periods [37], then 
harvested and washed in PBS. Cells were pelleted by 
centrifugation and incubated with 1% SDS, followed 
by heating at 95°C for 10 min. PBS containing 0.5% 
NP40 and proteinase inhibitors was added, followed by 
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant 
was transferred to a new tube discarding the slimy layer, 
and immunoprecipitated with Snail1 antibodies, and 
analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Sumo1 and anti-
HA antibodies.
Wound healing assays
Scratch wound healing assays using PC-3U cells 
were performed in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected 
with either wt-Snail1 or mutant-Snail1. Cells were serum-
starved prior to creating an approximately 0.6 mm wide 
wound using a pipette tip. Thereafter, cells were stimulated 
with TGFβ for 24 h. Images were taken by a microscope 
with a digital camera, using QED software.
Invasion assay
Invasion assays were performed using Corning 
BioCoat Growth Factor (GFR) reduced Matrigel Invasion 
Chamber, following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Serum-free RPMI-1640 was used to rehydrate the GFR 
Matrigel inserts. Cells were seeded into the insert in 
RPMI-1640 medium with 1% FBS, with or without 
TGFβ1. The lower chamber was filled with RPMI 1640 
with 10% FBS. After 24 h of incubation in a humidified 
tissue culture incubator, non-invasive cells were 
scrubbed off the upper surface of the membrane. The 
remaining invasive cells were stained with crystal violet 
staining solution and then photographed. Colorimetric 
quantification was performed by measuring the optical 
density at 560 nm using a spectrophotometer.
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin embedded tissue sections from patients with 
prostate cancer, were deparaffinised and tissue sections 
were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(Thermoscientific). Primary antibodies against Snail1, 
Sumo1, TβRI, Hes1 and c-Jun were used for staining. 
DAB chromogen (brown color) was used for the detection 
and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin 
to visualize nuclei (blue). The stained tissues were dried 
overnight and then scanned with Panoramic 250 Flash 
scanner (3D HISTECH Ltd). Ethical permit to use tumor 
tissues for generation of tissue slides was provided by the 
Umeå University. Ethical review board in full agreement 
with the Swedish Ethical Review Act (540/03, Dnr 03-
482).
Statistical analysis of qRT-PCR data
After qRT-PCR, the cycle threshold (CT) values 
of respective genes were normalized to the CT of the 
reference gene GAPDH. Then, the ∆CT values were 
obtained and plotted. We performed statistical analysis 
for each of three or more independent qRT-PCR assays. 
Bars are presented as means ± SEM from at least three 
independent experiments. Differences in the means ± SEM 
between samples were analyzed with two-way ANOVA 
with bonferroni post hoc test using SPSS software.
