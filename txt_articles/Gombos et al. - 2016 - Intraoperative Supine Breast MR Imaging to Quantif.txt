Purpose:
To use intraoperative supine magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging to quantify breast tumor deformation and dis-
placement secondary to the change in patient positioning 
from imaging (prone) to surgery (supine) and to evaluate 
residual tumor immediately after breast-conserving sur-
gery (BCS).
Materials and 
Methods:
Fifteen women gave informed written consent to partic-
ipate in this prospective HIPAA-compliant, institutional 
review board–approved study between April 2012 and 
November 2014. Twelve patients underwent lumpectomy 
and postsurgical intraoperative supine MR imaging. Six of 
12 patients underwent both pre- and postsurgical supine 
MR imaging. Geometric, structural, and heterogeneity 
metrics of the cancer and distances of the tumor from 
the nipple, chest wall, and skin were computed. Mean 
and standard deviations of the changes in volume, surface 
area, compactness, spherical disproportion, sphericity, 
and distances from key landmarks were computed from 
tumor models. Imaging duration was recorded.
Results:
The mean differences in tumor deformation metrics be-
tween prone and supine imaging were as follows: volume, 
23.8% (range, 230% to 103.95%); surface area, 6.5% 
(range, 213.24% to 63%); compactness, 16.2% (range, 
223% to 47.3%); sphericity, 6.8% (range, 29.10% 
to 20.78%); and decrease in spherical disproportion, 
211.3% (range, 260.81% to 76.95%). All tumors were 
closer to the chest wall on supine images than on prone 
images. No evidence of residual tumor was seen on MR 
images obtained after the procedures. Mean duration of 
pre- and postoperative supine MR imaging was 25 mi-
nutes (range, 18.4–31.6 minutes) and 19 minutes (range, 
15.1–22.9 minutes), respectively.
Conclusion:
Intraoperative supine breast MR imaging, when per-
formed in conjunction with standard prone breast MR 
imaging, enables quantification of breast tumor deforma-
tion and displacement secondary to changes in patient 
positioning from standard imaging (prone) to surgery (su-
pine) and may help clinicians evaluate for residual tumor 
immediately after BCS.

BREAST IMAGING: Intraoperative Supine Breast MR Imaging 
Gombos et al
informed consent to participate in a 
phase I trial investigating the feasibility 
of intraoperative MR imaging for real-
time margin analysis during BCS in the 
operating room imaging suite. At the 
2014 annual meeting of the American 
Society of Breast Surgeons, we pre-
sented a video report on the feasibility 
of intraoperative MR imaging without 
further analysis in eight of the 15 pa-
tients (18).
MR imaging–guided BCS surgery 
was performed in an advanced mul-
timodality 
image-guided 
operating 
suite (or AMIGO). This is an operat-
ing room and interventional suite with 
a full array of imaging modalities for 
use during procedures (18). There is 
a ceiling-mounted 3-T wide-bore (70 
cm) MR imager (Verio; Siemens, Er-
langen, Germany) in the center of the 
MR imaging room that can be moved 
in and out of the surgical field. The MR 
imager can traverse on rails to a fully 
draped patient on the operating table. 
The operating room is equipped with 
MR imaging conditional anesthesia de-
livery, monitoring systems, and instru-
ments required to perform BCS (19). 
All images and information relevant 
to the procedure are accessible in the 
operating suite, with selected imaging 
series displayed on large liquid crystal 
display monitors within the room that 
prospective studies and a meta-analysis 
reported that patients undergoing pre-
operative MR imaging have not experi-
enced reduced re-excision or improved 
survival rates (12–15). Critics of the 
existing studies performed to examine 
the value of preoperative breast MR 
imaging have highlighted the lack of a 
consistent strategy to manage MR im-
aging data (16,17). Additional findings 
were not always addressed and often 
did not generate specific modifications 
at the time of surgery. These inconsis-
tencies may explain the lack of data 
supporting routine use of preoperative 
MR imaging in the evaluation of known 
breast carcinoma.
Our hypothesis is that intraopera-
tive supine MR imaging can be used 
to plan the extent of resection, to de-
tect residual tumor immediately after 
the first attempt at definitive surgery, 
and to provide feedback to the surgeon 
within the surgical suite. The aim of 
this study was to use intraoperative 
supine MR imaging to quantify breast 
tumor deformation and displacement 
secondary to the change in patient po-
sitioning from imaging (prone) to sur-
gery (supine) and to evaluate the resid-
ual tumor immediately after BCS.

Advances in Knowledge
 
n We describe supine pre- and 
postprocedural MR imaging pro-
tocols and workflow within the 
operating room.
 
n The computed mean difference in 
tumor deformation metrics 
between supine and prone MR 
imaging examinations are as fol-
lows: (a) increases in volume, 
23.8% (range, 230% to 
103.95%); surface area, 6.5% 
(range, 213.24% to 63%); com-
pactness, 16.2% (range, 223% 
to 47.3%); and sphericity, 6.8% 
(range, 29.10% to 20.78%) and 
(b) decrease in spherical dispro-
portion, 211.3% (range, 
260.81% to 76.95%).
 
n All tumors (n = 6) were closer to 
the chest wall on supine images 
than on prone images.
 
n The mean duration of pre- and 
postoperative supine MR exami-
nations within the operating 
room was 25 minutes (range, 
18.4–31.6 minutes) and 19 mi-
nutes (range, 15.1–22.9 mi-
nutes), respectively.
Implications for Patient Care
 
n Supine MR imaging may aid in 
improving surgical planning by 
accounting for tumor displace-
ment and deformation occurring 
between standard positioning for 
MR imaging and that for surgery 
to potentially allow for more 
complete tumor resection.
 
n If validated in future large 
studies, intraoperative supine 
MR imaging could be expected to 
help detect a remnant tumor im-
mediately after breast-conserving 
surgery to ensure negative sur-
gical margins.
B
reast-conserving therapy, which 
consists of lumpectomy followed 
by whole-breast irradiation, is 
a standard option used to treat early 
stage breast cancer. Positive margins 
increase the risk of local recurrence; 
therefore, clear margins are a prereq-
uisite for breast-conserving therapy. In 
the United States, 20%–40% of patients 
undergoing breast-conserving surgery 
(BCS) require re-excision (1–7).
Contrast material–enhanced breast 
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is 
an important modality used to detect 
malignancy, with reports of higher 
sensitivity than that attained with con-
ventional imaging (sensitivity and spec-
ificity of approximately 90% and 85%, 
respectively) in the detection of breast 
cancer (8–11). However, there is no ev-
idence that preoperative work-up with 
MR imaging for surgical planning or 
evaluation of disease extent translates 
into improved surgical outcome. Two

undergone preoperative contrast mate-
rial–enhanced MR imaging–guided wire 
localization, which was another reason 
we chose not to perform additional 
intraoperative MR imaging. An exam-
ple of timing of sequences is shown in 
Table 2.
Although preprocedure supine MR 
imaging yielded high-spatial-resolution 
images, it was excessively time consum-
ing; therefore, we suspended prepro-
cedure supine MR imaging at the time 
of surgery after we processed the first 
seven studies.
Personnel
Procedures were performed by a breast 
radiologist with 11 years of experi-
ence in breast MR image interpreta-
tion (E.C.G.), two MR technologists, a 
breast surgical oncologist (M.G.), and 
two surgical fellows (D.L.C., M.A.M.). 
In addition, an imaging scientist (J.J.), 
breast cancer and were not considered 
suitable for the procedure. A third pa-
tient with a separate comorbidity of 
lung cancer as an additional primary 
cancer was also excluded.
Each patient underwent standard 
diagnostic MR imaging in the usual 
prone position as an outpatient prior 
to surgery. The details of the imaging 
sequences are shown in Table 1. The 
surgeon (M.G.) and procedure radiol-
ogist (E.C.G.) reviewed available addi-
tional breast imaging studies, including 
mammograms, sonograms, and core 
biopsy samples. Six of the first seven 
patients underwent preprocedural MR 
imaging in the operating room, and all 
12 patients underwent postprocedural 
intraoperative breast MR imaging af-
ter removal of the main tumor. One 
of the first seven patients did not un-
dergo preprocedure MR imaging due to 
time constraints. This patient also had 
enable surgeons to continuously view 
relevant imaging data.
Participants and MR Imaging Sequences
The operating breast surgical oncologist 
(M.G.) recruited the subjects. Eligible 
patients were women aged 18–74 years 
with core biopsy–proved clinical stage I 
or II invasive breast cancer who had MR 
imaging–measurable disease and who 
were candidates for BCS. Exclusion cri-
teria were prior ipsilateral breast can-
cer or breast surgery, any prior breast 
reconstruction or implants, current 
neoadjuvant therapy or enrollment in 
other preoperative trials, pregnancy or 
breast feeding, and hereditary predis-
position to breast cancer, such as BRCA 
mutations, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, or 
Cowden disease.
Between April 2012 and Decem-
ber 2014, a total of 15 women were 
enrolled. Two patients had extensive

* Intraoperative volume-interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) sequences were performed during a controlled breath hold, with patient anesthesia suspended by the anesthesiology team. 
Because the chest wall movements are more pronounced in the supine position than in the prone position, breath-hold imaging aids in avoiding motion artifacts that degrade image quality and cause 
misregistration on subtraction images.

‡ During postprocedural MR imaging, additional delay times were added to account for the assumed reduced perfusion immediately after surgery. With the surgical insult, swelling to the parenchyma 
with tissue edema occurring increased when saline filled the cavity. We expected that enhancement on the postlumpectomy MR images would be reduced and that the signal peak would be delayed.

underwent standard sentinel lymph 
node biopsy and lumpectomy with or 
without preoperative wire localization. 
After BCS, the lumpectomy cavity was 
filled with normal saline to match the 
resected volume calculated with diag-
nostic MR imaging. An earlier work 
showed magnetic susceptibility mis-
match of the air-tissue interface created 
a high-signal-intensity artifact that could 
be mistaken for enhancement (20). As 
the susceptibility of saline approxi-
mately matches that of tissue, filling the 
cavity with saline before postsurgical 
imaging can help minimize the artifact. 
The lumpectomy cavity was temporar-
ily closed with sutures, and the surgical 
region was covered with sterile dressing 
to maintain sterility. The removed spec-
imen was transferred for routine spec-
imen radiography to document target 
removal and wire integrity. The patient 
carefully positioned to achieve ade-
quate breast tissue visualization and to 
minimize skin folds and other artifacts 
to optimize image quality. The patient’s 
shoulders were propped up with cush-
ions to allow the breast to rest medially. 
The lower part of a 16-channel cardiac 
coil was placed in an empty cartridge 
without moving the patient, and the 
upper coil was gently placed over the 
operative breast with a sterile cover 
without applying additional pressure on 
the breast. After we completed a rigor-
ous checklist to ensure that all ferrous 
materials, equipment, and booms were 
moved beyond the 0.0005-T line, the 
ceiling-mounted MR imager traversed 
over the patient to perform preproce-
dural MR imaging.
On completion of preprocedural im-
aging, the MR imager was moved out of 
the operating room. The patient then 
the chief nurse in-charge, anesthesiol-
ogists, and administrative personnel 
were involved and present during the 
procedures.
Imaging Surgery Workflow
Prior to live procedures, multiple dry-
run tests with volunteers were per-
formed to develop and study the opti-
mal workflow (Fig 1, Fig E1 [online]). 
The information gleaned from these 
experiments helped us define the work-
flow for the BCS procedures and subse-
quently enabled us to decrease time in 
the operating room.
On the day of the surgery, the pa-
tient was placed in the supine surgical 
position, and general anesthesia was 
introduced. Six of the patients under-
went preprocedural supine MR imaging 
prior to BCS in the operating room. 
For supine sequences, the patient was

software (3D Slicer; https://www.slicer.
org/slicerWiki/index.php/Main_Page). 
The first contrast-enhanced MR imag-
ing study was volume rendered with 
increased transparency of the breast to 
depict the 3D structure of the tumor. 
The volume of the surgical cavity, as-
suming a 10-mm margin around the tu-
mor, was computed to determine the 
amount of saline to be injected into the 
cavity immediately after the procedure.
Pre- and Postprocedural Image Analysis
Pre- and postprocedural MR images 
were provided intraoperatively to the 
CADstream software to automatically 
segment the tumor corresponding to 
the regions of enhancement presumed 
to be due to angiogenesis. Subtracted 
images, which were computed from 
the first and fourth unenhanced and 
contrast-enhanced images, were com-
puted and provided to the radiologist 
for analysis. This processing was per-
formed when the MR imager was being 
moved out of the operating room and 
while the patient was being prepared 
after both intraoperative pre- and post-
procedural MR studies.
Duration of Intraoperative MR Imaging
We documented the elapsed time be-
tween acquisition of the first and last 
images for pre- and postoperative ex-
aminations. The recorded duration 
shows total MR image acquisition times. 
It does not include the time taken to 
prepare the surgical site, position the 
coil on the patient, or move the imager. 
(Each time the imager moves, it takes 
approximately 90 seconds.)
Imaging Processing, Computer-aided 
Diagnosis, and Deformation Mapping
Postprocessing, including axial sub-
traction images, maximum intensity 
projection images, and computer-aided 
detection analysis, was performed rou-
tinely at all stages of breast MR imaging 
and was used in the diagnostic work-up 
and for intraoperative decision making.
We investigated the effect of a 
change in patient position (ie, from 
prone in the diagnostic phase to supine 
in the surgical phase) on tumor defor-
mation and displacement, based on 
clinically suspicious areas. The surgeon 
then performed shave resection at six 
standard cavity margins in which a thin 
fragment of additional tissue was re-
sected at the anterior, posterior, me-
dial, lateral, and superior margins.
Contrast Material Administration
Gadopentetate dimeglumine at a con-
centration of 0.1 mmol per kilogram of 
body weight (0.2 mL per kilogram of 
body weight) with a maximum dose of 
15 mL was administered in the intraop-
erative setting on the same day as the 
procedure. Six patients who underwent 
both pre- and postprocedure MR imag-
ing received two injections of intraoper-
ative intravenous MR contrast material. 
The dose for two intraoperative MR ex-
aminations did not exceed 30 mL. Our 
protocol adhered to Food and Drug Ad-
ministration guidelines for routine intra-
venous injection of a 0.15 mmol/kg (0.3 
mL/kg) gadolinium-containing contrast 
material, with a maximum safe dose 
of 30 mL. A question remained, how-
ever, as to image quality and contrast 
resolution, as the two injections of the 
gadolinium chelate were administered 
within a short interval (approximately 
1.5–2.0 hours apart). We expected that 
the second intraoperative MR imaging 
precontrast VIBE sequence would de-
pict low baseline tissue intensity with-
out detectable contrast enhancement 
and that the contrast-enhanced MR 
images would be adequate to show en-
hancement. Although there is no quan-
titative measure of image adequacy, the 
radiologist qualitatively assessed each 
case as satisfactory or unsatisfactory 
for resolution, tissue contrast, and de-
livery of intravenous contrast material.
Procedure Planning
On the basis of the patient’s diagnostic 
planning MR images obtained prior to 
the surgical procedure, the radiology 
team (J.J., E.C.G.), prepared detailed 
3D schemes for the surgeon. The tumor 
was segmented on MR images by using 
CADstream software (Merge Health-
care, Chicago, Ill). The Digital Imag-
ing and Communications in Medicine 
volume of the diagnostic MR imaging 
study was loaded into the open-source 
was then undraped and prepared for 
postprocedural MR imaging.
Immediately after surgery, the pa-
tient was imaged in the sterile surgical 
area with a similar careful positioning 
and coil set-up as with the supine MR 
imaging performed prior to surgery. 
Skin markers (MR-SPOTS; Beekley 
Medical, Bristol, Conn) were placed 
inferior and superior to the surgical 
cavity to aid in planning the imaging 
volume on the localizer images. The 
radiologist provided a detailed report 
on suspicious enhancement and pos-
sible remnant tumor to the surgeon. 
The radiologist and surgeon discussed 
the images, and the surgeon indicated

cancers, all of which were without an 
extensive intraductal component.
The mean largest dimension of the 
cancers measured on diagnostic prone 
MR images was 2.0 cm (range, 1.4–3.0 
cm). In two patients, benign pattern 
of enhancement was seen on postpro-
cedural MR images (a focus and non-
masslike enhancement); however, these 
were not suspicious for residual tumor.
The mean of largest dimension of 
the cancers measured at final patho-
logic examination was 2.0 cm (range, 
1.6–2.7 cm) (Table 3). One patient 
underwent re-excision in a different 
session because of histopathologic find-
ings, revealing a 2-mm area of ductal 
carcinoma in situ at pathology. This was 
not seen on postprocedure MR images.
Duration of Intraoperative Imaging
The mean duration of the preoperative 
supine examination was 25 minutes 6 
6.6 (standard deviation) (range, 17.7–
37 minutes). The mean duration of the 
postlumpectomy supine examination was 
19 minutes 6 3.9 (range, 13.1–25.9 mi-
nutes). The MR imaging time did not de-
crease with team experience during the 
14 months of this study (Table 3). The 
first three and second three examinations 
lasted an average of 26 and 24 minutes, 
respectively, preoperatively (P = .59) and 
an average of 18 and 21 minutes, respec-
tively, postoperatively (P = .41).
Discussion
MR imaging confers a high level of sen-
sitivity in breast tumor detection, and it 
has often been used to image residual 
tumors after lumpectomy. Studies in pa-
tients with positive or close tumor mar-
gins who are undergoing MR imaging 
before re-excision showed that MR im-
aging is able to depict residual disease, 
with false-positive results caused by in-
flammatory processes that resemble re-
sidual disease (24,25). Soderstrom et al 
reported MR imaging has an accuracy of 
approximately 84% in the detection of 
recurrent tumors in patients who have 
recently undergone BCS (26). Postthera-
peutic effects may cause substantial en-
hancement within the treated breast, 
primarily within the first 12 months after 
 
postprocedure saline-infused images 
were determined to be satisfactory 
and of high spatial resolution (Fig E2 
[online]).
Clinical and imaging data in the six 
women who underwent both pre- and 
postlumpectomy intraoperative MR im-
aging are summarized in Table 3. The 
average greatest MR imaging dimension 
of the cancers was 2.0 cm (range, 1.4–
3.0 cm) on diagnostic prone MR im-
ages. Mean tumor volume was 1.66 cm3 
(range, 0.13–3.6 cm3) per MR image. 
The mean cavity volume was 31.98 cm3 
(range, 13.7–54.0 cm3), as measured 
on postprocedural MR images.
Tumor Deformation Due to Position 
Change
We found deformation and displace-
ment of the tumor in the six patients 
in whom we obtained prone diagnostic 
and supine preprocedural MR images 
(Fig 2; Figs E2, E3 [online]). The mean 
change from prone images to supine im-
ages (as a percentage of the prone met-
rics) was as follows: (a) increase in vol-
ume, 23.8% (range, 230%, 103.95%); 
surface area, 6.5% (range, 213.24% 
to 63%); compactness, 16.2% (range, 
223% to 47.3%); spherical dispro-
portion 211.3% (range, 260.81% to 
76.95%); and sphericity, 6.8% (range, 
29.10% to 20.78%) and (b) decrease 
in spherical disproportion, 211.3% 
(range, 260.81% to 76.95%) (Table 4). 
 
No significant differences were ob-
served between metrics for the supine 
or prone positions. For the six patients 
analyzed, the average tumor displace-
ment was 23.8, 227.7, and 26.5 mm 
in the lateral, anterior, and superior co-
ordinates, respectively. All the tumors 
were closer to the chest wall on supine 
images than on prone images.
Comparison with Histopathology Results
The final histopathology results were 
similar to those for histopathology of the 
core biopsy. However, in two patients, 
histopathology of the excision speci-
men showed higher grades of invasive 
cancer. In addition, in three patients, 
histopathology of the lumpectomy spec-
imen revealed that ductal carcinoma in 
situ was present around the invasive 
segmentation of the tumor performed 
by the radiology team. Initially, after we 
aligned the pulmonary veins, contrast-
enhanced images in the prone and su-
pine positions were rigidly registered 
based on thoracic cavities by using the 
mutual information criterion (21–23). 
Then, 3D tumor models were created 
with the aforementioned 3D Slicer soft-
ware by segmenting the tumors on su-
pine and prone MR images with semi-
automatic threshold-based algorithms 
on the subtraction images computed 
from the first unenhanced and con-
trast-enhanced volumes (23). The 3D 
models were further registered by us-
ing iterative closest point registration. 
We used the HeterogeneityCAD mod-
ule in the 3D Slicer software (https://
www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/
Documentation/Nightly/Modules/Het-
erogeneityCAD) to compute 65 geo-
metric, structural, and heterogeneity 
metrics, including volume, surface area, 
maximum 3D diameter, compactness, 
spherical disproportion, and sphericity 
for the tumors segmented on prone and 
supine MR images. Distances of the tu-
mor center from the nipple, chest wall, 
and skin were computed. Care was 
taken regarding tumors close to the 
chest wall to ensure accurate delinea-
tion of the tumor to plan the extent of 
surgery.
Statistical Methods
The Student t test was performed to 
evaluate whether there was a signifi-
cant difference (P , .05) between the 
intraprocedural imaging time change 
for the first three patients and the sec-
ond three patients. We used the uni-
variate Mann-Whitney test to compare 
supine and prone MR imaging tumor 
deformation and displacement metrics. 
Statistical analyses were performed by 
using MATLAB software (MathWorks; 
Natick, Mass).
Results
No technical or procedural complica-
tions were encountered when obtaining 
postprocedural MR images. Subjective 
assessment showed no susceptibility ar-
tifacts at the air-tissue boundary, and

BREAST IMAGING: Intraoperative Supine Breast MR Imaging 
Gombos et al
The success of a lumpectomy feasibility 
study with intraoperative MR imaging 
with a 0.5-T open imager and mainte-
nance of sterility (20) was confirmed in 
a phase I clinical trial performed in the 
AMIGO suite with a 3-T imager (18). 
In this study, we showed that consider-
able deformity of the breast and tumor 
position occurs in the supine position.
The detected tumor displacement 
with a change in position was expected. 
The tumor deformation with position 
change was somewhat less anticipated. 
second or third procedure at the current 
rate (one in five patients) (29).
In previous studies on the utility 
of MR imaging in the evaluation of the 
extent of cancer, the MR imaging find-
ings were not systematically addressed, 
and the issues of tumor deformation 
and displacement were not investi-
gated (15,16). The advanced multi-
modality image-guided operating (or 
AMIGO) suite enables intraoperative 
imaging with a state-of-the-art 3-T MR 
imager after addressing these issues. 
BCS; however, recurrent or residual car-
cinomas after BCS show rapid enhance-
ment, which is typical of a malignant 
tumor (27). Krämer et al showed that 
MR imaging has the highest sensitivity 
(91%) in the detection of recurrent or 
residual tumor when compared with US 
(85%) or mammography (67%) (28). 
In an editorial, Jacobs concluded that 
in addition to improvements in surgical 
techniques, it is important to accurately 
assess surgical margins intraoperatively 
to prevent patients from returning for a

quality high-spatial-resolution images, 
it was found to be too time consuming 
for practical use. Thus, preoperative 
supine MR imaging at the time of sur-
gery was suspended after the first seven 
patients were examined. Instead, we 
are currently performing one imaging 
sequence with the patient in the supine 
position at the time of diagnostic prone 
MR imaging, and we do not perform a 
complete intraoperative examination in 
the supine position within the operating 
room.
In summary, we describe our expe-
rience with a supine MR imaging proto-
col and workflow. Tumor deformation 
and position were substantially different 
in the prone and supine studies. We hy-
pothesize that supine MR imaging may 
assist in achieving more accurate tumor 
delineation and may enable more de-
tailed surgical planning for lumpectomy 
procedures. Larger studies are needed 
for more thorough assessment.

Cancers are stiffer than the surrounding 
breast parenchyma; therefore, deforma-
tions of the tumor would be expected 
to be negligible. Krouskop et al showed 
that the stiffness of normal fat, normal 
glandular tissue, and invasive ductal 
carcinomas were 20, 57, and 490 kPa, 
respectively (30). Despite the difference 
in stiffness between the tumor and the 
surrounding breast parenchyma, we ob-
served an average change of 23.8% in 
the measured volume, 6.5% in the sur-
face area, 16.2% in compactness, and 
7.1% in maximum 3D diameter.
Our study had limitations. We de-
scribe initial results in a small number 
of patients. We did not assess for er-
rors or interobserver variability related 
to segmentation of the tumor on supine 
and prone dynamic contrast-enhanced 
MR images. In addition, the cost of us-
ing intraoperative MR imaging was not 
assessed. The practical applications are 
limited to the few sites (academic cen-
ters) that have the ability to perform 
this type of imaging. Although preoper-
ative supine MR imaging yielded good
