IMPORTANCE Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been associated with poor mental
and physical health outcomes. However, the mechanism of this effect, critical to enhancing
public health, remains poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the neurodevelopmental trajectory of the association between
early ACEs and adolescent general and emotional health outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective longitudinal study that began when
patients were aged 3 to 6 years who underwent neuroimaging later at ages 7 to 12 years and
whose mental and physical health outcomes were observed at ages 9 to 15 years. Sequential
mediation models were used to investigate associations between early ACEs and brain
structure, emotion development, and health outcomes longitudinally. Children were
recruited from an academic medical center research unit.
EXPOSURE Early life adversity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Early ACEs in children aged 3 to 7 years; volume of a
subregion of the prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, in children aged 6 to 12 years;
and emotional awareness, depression severity, and general health outcomes in children and
adolescents aged 9 to 15 years.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of 119 patients was 9.65 (1.31) years at the time of scan.
The mean (SD) ACE score was 5.44 (3.46). The mean (SD) depression severity scores were
2.61 (1.78) at preschool, 1.77 (1.58) at time 2, and 2.16 (1.64) at time 3. The mean (SD) global
physical health scores at time 2 and time 3 were 0.30 (0.38) and 0.33 (0.42), respectively.
Sequential mediation in the association between high early ACEs and emotional and physical
health outcomes were found. Smaller inferior frontal gyrus volumes and poor emotional
awareness sequentially mediated the association between early ACEs and poor general
health (model parameter estimate = 0.002; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.056) and higher depression
severity (model parameter estimate = 0.007; 95% CI, 0.001-0.021) in adolescence. An
increase from 0 to 3 early ACEs was associated with 15% and 25% increases in depression
severity and physical health problems, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Study findings highlight 1 putative neurodevelopmental
mechanism by which the association between early ACEs and later poor mental and physical
health outcomes may operate. This identified risk trajectory may be useful to target
preventive interventions.

hereisgrowingevidencethatpsychosocialadversityex-
perienced during childhood increases risk for poor
physical and mental health outcomes later in life. In
1998, the landmark study of Felitti et al1 provided the first evi-
dence for an association between adverse childhood experi-
ences (ACEs) and increased risk for later physical health prob-
lems using retrospective data from an epidemiologic sample.
Notably, these novel findings, which challenged existing mod-
els of disease, were not embraced by the scientific and medi-
cal community until more recent prospective longitudinal in-
vestigations and meta-analyses confirmed this association.2-4
After this, numerous studies have begun to investigate the
mechanisms by which early psychosocial adversity, defined
as deprivation and/or threat, such as abuse, neglect, and
poverty, becomes biologically embedded in the developing
child, contributing to poor emotional and physical health
outcomes.5-12
Miller et al13 have proposed a theoretical model for the
mechanisms by which early ACEs become biologically embed-
ded to increase risk for later physical disease. Early child-
hood appears to be a particularly sensitive period for the nega-
tive effects of adversity, given greater plasticity of developing
neural and other physiologic systems.6 The model by Miller
et al13 accounted for behavioral and physiological processes
and their interactions and outlined a process by which ACEs
impact cells of the developing immune system to mount ex-
cessiveinflammatoryresponses,developingintoachronicpro-
inflammatory phenotype. This inflammatory state stimu-
latesendocrineandautonomicresponses,furtheraccentuating
risk.13,14 Behaviorally, ACEs promote hypervigilance to threat,
a focus on immediate gratification over future reward, and
poorer emotion regulation, shaping interactions with the
environment and leading to increased health risk behaviors
(eg, poor dietary choices, risky behaviors).13
Childhood psychosocial adversity has been shown to
explain more than 20% to 30% of all onsets of mental
disorders.15,16 More specifically, a large body of literature links
ACEs, particularly abuse (threat) and neglect (deprivation), to
risk for depression later in life.17-21 There is also evidence that
early ACEs are associated with impaired emotion develop-
ment during childhood, evidenced by decreased emotional
awareness and regulation.22,23 Such deficits in emotion de-
velopment have been theorized to be key to the developmen-
tal psychopathology of depression.24 Further, deficits in emo-
tionawarenesshavebeenassociatedwithincreasingbodymass
index across later childhood, a well-established risk factor for
poor health outcomes.25 These findings taken together sug-
gest that emotion development may be a key and underrec-
ognized factor in the risk trajectory linking early ACEs and later
adolescent depression and physical health problems.

specificity of PFC volume deficits associated with early ACEs
remains unclear, as well as any role of such changes in the risk
trajectory to poor health outcomes. One plausible mechanis-
tic pathway contributing to the biological embedding of early
ACEs is a model whereby early ACEs alter the development of
the PFC, resulting in impaired emotional and behavioral func-
tioning and leading to later emotional and physical health risk
(Figure 1). Investigations of such pathways represent a critical
gap in the literature, which is important for understanding and
targeting this increasingly well-established risk trajectory with
broad public health implications.

in adolescence using data from a longitudinal neuroimaging
study. We first examined regional specificity by investigating

Key Points
Question What is a neurobiological pathway by which early
childhood adversity becomes biologically embedded in the
developing child to increase risk for emotional and physical health
problems?
Findings Results from this longitudinal prospective neuroimaging
study suggest that early childhood adversity negatively affects the
volume of a subregion of the prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal
gyrus, resulting in impairments in emotional competence and
increased risk for adolescent depression and poor health
outcomes.
Meaning Findings elucidate a possible mechanistic pathway by
which early childhood adversity leads to poor emotional and
physical health outcomes and suggests specific targets for
prevention.

 ACEs. We then examined whether the PFC subvolume asso-
ciated with early ACEs was associated with reduced emo-
tional functioning and whether these 2 variables operated as
sequential mediators in the association between early ACEs
and later depression severity and global physical health (GPH)

Measures
Early Adverse Childhood Experiences
To examine the effect of prospectively collected early ACEs on
brain outcomes, we created an early ACEs score using the life
events section of the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment
(conducted at each assessment that occurred between ages
3-7.11 years) based on parent report. There was no cut-off or
threshold for the ACEs score. Therefore, for this analysis early
childhood was defined as the developmental period from ages
3 to 8 years. The ACEs variable was adapted from the original
definition by Felitti et al1 but also included exposure to pov-
erty because of its established role in brain development.26-28
The variables included in the ACEs sum score are included in
the Box. All variables were coded as absent or present (0 vs 1),
and adverse experiences (other than poverty) were only
counted multiple times if they were nonredundant (eg, child
was abused at age 3 years and again at age 4 years). For a more
detailed description of the ACEs construct, see eTable in the
Supplement.
Emotion Awareness
Emotion awareness was measured using the poor emotion
awareness subscale of the Emotion Expression Scale for
Children,40 which operationally defines poor emotion aware-
ness as “difficulty labeling internal emotion experience” (eg,
“Sometimes I just don’
t have words to describe how I feel”).
Thepoorawarenesssubscaleisbasedon8child-reporteditems
that are rated using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 indicat-
ing not at all true and 5, extremely true). The subscale score
is calculated by summing the 8 items.

 Depression Severity
Depressionseveritywasmeasuredduringearlychildhoodusing
parent-reported data on the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assess-
ment at baseline and at outcome (T2 and time 3, ie, T3) based
on parent and child report on the Child and Adolescent Psy-
chiatric Assessment.41 Parent and child report were com-
binedusingthe“either/or”rule,ashasbeenestablishedinchild
affective disorder research.42 Depression severity was calcu-
lated as the number of 9 core Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) depression symptoms
endorsed by the parent and/or child.
Global Health Outcomes
We used the GPH subscale of the McArthur Health and Behav-
ior Questionnaire43 to assess GPH problems at outcome (T3)
based on parent report of the child’
s medical problems. This
5-item composite score assesses indicators of poor health and
difficulties stemming from physical health problems (eg, miss-
ingschool)withhigherscoresindicatingworsephysicalhealth.
Parents were asked to answer questions such as “In general,
would you say your child’
s physical health is excellent, good,
fair, or poor?” and “How often in an average month does
your child stay home or come home from school or childcare
because of illness?”43
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Acquisition

Tim Trio system; Siemens). Time 1–weighted structural images
were acquired in the sagittal plane using an magnetization-
prepared rapid gradient-echo 3-dimensional sequence (repeti-
tion time = 2400 milliseconds; echo time = 3.16 milliseconds;
flipangle = 8°;slab = 176mm;176slices;matrixsize = 256 × 256;
field of view = 256 mm; voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm).
Volumetric Segmentation and Regional Calculations
FreeSurfer version 5.1.0 software (http://surfer.nmr.mgh
.harvard.edu/) was used to segment each participant’
s
anatomical image using the atlas by Destrieux et al,44 allowing
estimation of gray matter volume for 5 PFC subregions. The
white and pial FreeSurfer surfaces were visually inspected and
were regenerated with manual intervention to correct errors
when necessary. Overall PFC volume comprised 5 smaller
subregionsthatwerecalculatedfromtheDestrieuxcorticalatlas:
(1) superior frontal volume = combined left and right superior
frontal; (2) middle frontal volume = left and right rostral
middle frontal + caudal middle frontal; (3) inferior frontal
gyrus = left and right parsopercularis + parstriangularis
+ parsorbitalis; (4) orbital frontal volume = left and right lateral
orbitofrontal + medial orbitofrontal; and (5) frontal pole
volume = the sum of left and right frontal pole volumes.
Whole-brainvolume(totalgray + corticalwhitemattervolume)
was also obtained from FreeSurfer.
Data Analysis
A multivariate regression with dependent variables (subre-
gions of the PFC) superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus,
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbital cortex, and frontal pole vol-
ume and independent variables ACEs, sex, and age at scan was
run to determine which PFC regions were significantly asso-
ciated with early ACEs. Two separate sequential mediation
models were analyzed using the PROCESS macro for SAS
(model 645) with 1 model testing depression severity as the
outcome and the other model testing GPH as the outcome.
PROCESS calculates a bias-corrected and accelerated boot-
strapped confidence interval (10 000 resamples) for the size
of each indirect effect, with significant mediation indicated by
a confidence interval that does not contain 0. PROCESS model
6 tests all indirect and direct pathways included in the model
(Figure 1). The a paths are the associations between the inde-
pendent variable and the mediator variables. The b paths are
the associations between the mediator variables and the de-
pendent variable. The d path is the association between the
2 mediators, and the c' path is the direct effect of the indepen-
dentvariableonthedependentvariable.Thesesequentialmod-
els included covariates to control for age, sex, whole-brain vol-
ume, and preexisting depression severity (when GPH is the
dependent variable) or GPH and preschool depression sever-
ity (when depression severity is the dependent variable).
Results
Association Between ACEs and PFC Subregions
The multivariate regression that included the PFC subre-
gions superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, IFG, or-
bital cortex, and frontal pole volume was significant overall
(Wilks’λ = 0.896; F5,133 = 3.09; P = .01). Only 1 significant as-
sociation between early ACEs and IFG volume was found
(model parameter estimate = −0.223; SE = 0.071; t = −3.14;
P = .002), which survived multiple comparison correction af-
ter covarying for sex and age (eTable in the Supplement). Thus,
IFG volume was used in the following analyses.
Risk Trajectory From Early ACEs
to Depression Severity
Mean (SD) and correlations for focal variables as well as co-
variates used in the mediation analyses are provided in Table 1
and Table 2. All independent variables were mean centered.
The overall model explained 18% of the variance in depres-
sion severity (Figure 2). As expected and consistent with prior
research, there was a significant total effect from early
ACEs to depression severity (T3) (model parameter esti-
mate = 0.11,P = .03).Thetotaleffectremainedsignificantwhen
age, sex, GPH (from the preceding wave T2), depression se-
verity in early childhood, and whole-brain volume were in-
cluded as covariates. Next we examined whether IFG volume
and poorer emotion awareness would operate sequentially to
mediate the association between early ACEs and depression
severity, which it did (model parameter estimate = 0.03, 95%
CI, 0.002-0.086). Higher early ACEs scores predicted de-
creased IFG volume (a1: model parameter estimate = −0.22,
P = .005), which predicted poorer emotional awareness (d1,2:
model parameter estimate = −0.58, P = .006), which pre-
dicted higher depression severity (b2: model parameter esti-

 mate = 0.05, P = .04). This 3-path mediation including the 5
covariates was significant (model parameter estimate = 0.007;
95% CI, 0.001-0.021). Specifically, an increase in early ACEs
score from 0 to 3 was associated with a 15% increase in
depression severity.
Next we decomposed the mediated effect into 3 compo-
nents. First, IFG volume mediated the association between
early ACEs and depression severity even without emotion
awarenessinthemodel(modelparameterestimate = 0.03;95%
CI, 0.002 to 0.075). Thus, as early ACEs increased, IFG vol-
ume decreased (a1: model parameter estimate = −0.22,
P = .005). As IFG volume decreased, children’
s depression
severity increased (b1: model parameter estimate = −0.12,
P = .08). Early childhood adverse childhood events did not
uniquely predict impaired emotion awareness (a2: model
parameter estimate = 0.008, P = .97) and poorer emotional
awareness did not significantly mediate the association be-
tween early ACEs and depression severity without IFG vol-
ume in the model (model parameter estimate = 0.0004; 95%
CI, −0.017 to 0.022). However, poorer emotion awareness did
uniquely predict depression severity (b2: model parameter es-
timate = 0.05, P = .04). Thus, poorer emotion awareness
helped to explain the association between IFG volume to de-
pression but was not a direct mediator of the associations
between early ACEs and greater depression severity in early
adolescence.
Risk Trajectory From Early ACEs to Global Physical Health
As shown in Figure 3, the overall model explained 16% of the
variance in GPH. As expected and consistent with prior
research, there was a significant total effect from early ACEs
to GPH (T3) (c: model parameter estimate = 0.03, P = .03).
The total effect remained significant when age, sex, depres-
sion severity (from the preceding wave T2) and whole-brain
volume were included as covariates. An increase from 0 to 3
in early ACEs was associated with a 25% increase in chil-
dren’
s GPH problems. Next, we examined whether IFG vol-
ume and impaired emotion awareness would operate
sequentially to mediate the association between early ACEs
and GPH problems. Higher early ACEs scores predicted
decreased IFG volume (a1: β = −0.19, P = .02), which pre-
dicted poorer emotional awareness (d1,2: β = −0.59,
P = .006), which predicted higher GPH problems (b2:
β = 0.01, P = .04). Thus, results indicated the 3-path serial
mediation with 4 covariates was significant (model param-
eter estimate = 0.002; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.056).
When we decomposed the sequentially mediated effect,
results indicated that only the indirect sequential effect
was significant. That is, there were no significant indirect
effects of early ACEs on GPH when tested using only IFG as
a mediator or when using poor emotion awareness as a
mediator.
Although health records were not obtained and the vari-
ance in health problems reported by parents was low, the poly-

Discussion
These study findings elucidate 1 possible contributing mecha-
nistic neurodevelopmental pathway by which early ACEs con-
fers risk for later depressive symptoms and physical health
problems in adolescence. A sequential mediation was found
where early ACEs predicted the volume of the IFG, a struc-
tureknowntobeassociatedwithimpulsecontrol,emotionpro-
cessing, and regulation,46-49 and IFG volume in turn pre-
dicted emotion awareness. The finding that the IFG emerged
as the only region negatively affected by ACEs (that survived
multiple comparisons) is of interest and could suggest this is
aregionuniquelysensitivetotheeffectsofearlyadversity.One
rationale for the sensitivity of IFG to early adversity/stress is
suggested by nonhuman primate data showing a high den-
sity of glucocorticoid receptors in this region.50 However, fu-
ture work is needed to investigate any drivers of regional sen-
sitivity to stress in the PFC in humans.
These factors sequentially mediated the risk between
early ACEs and later depression severity. This model sug-
gests the possibility that early ACEs have a specific deleteri-
ous effect on the development of the IFG, a subregion
of the PFC involved in inhibitory control and emotion
function,46,49,51 resulting in deficits in emotion develop-
ment, which then contribute to risk for increased depressive
symptoms. These findings build on the extant literature
where associations between these variables separately have
been reported, bringing these factors together in a plausible
neurodevelopmental risk trajectory.
A similar model (with weaker effects) was evident for
the risk trajectory to physical health problems. This finding
was notable given that the patient sample had only reached
adolescence when health outcomes were measured, a
developmental period prior to the time typically associated
with higher risk for health problems in prior work on
ACEs.52,53 To date and to our knowledge, most studies that
establish links between ACEs and later health problems
have been conducted in middle-aged and older adults.2,3,8,10
Although a measure of documented health problems would
be ideal, these data were not available in the current data
set. However, it was notable that this effect remained even
when controlling for prior depression and was moderately
correlated with parent report of chronic medical conditions,
suggesting it is not merely somatization due to mental
health problems. Future studies that assess verifiable health
problems are needed to confirm this finding. However, cur-
rent findings suggest that these effects can be detected ear-
lier in development during the adolescent period and pro-
vides a mechanistic framework to understand the risk
trajectory. It will be important to continue to follow health
outcomes in this sample into later adulthood when a variety
of chronic health problems are more likely to arise and more
powerful effects might become evident.
Limitations and Strengths
A limitation of the study was that the sample was enhanced
for preschoolers with symptoms of depression, although our
findings remained significant when early childhood depres-
sion severity was controlled as noted above. Thus, the find-
ings should be replicated in community samples to ascertain
whetherthesameprocesscanbeidentifiedinthegeneralpopu-
lation. The assessment of physical health based on parent re-
port rather than medical record is a limitation of the design,
and future investigations would benefit from access to clini-
calrecordsofphysicalhealthoutcomes.Inaddition,thesample
size is relatively small for the analyses conducted, and these
findings should be replicated in larger samples. It should be
noted that the ACEs variable used included income-to-
needs, which is not a standard component of other reports on
ACEs. Although we feel this is a strength of the analysis, it
should be considered when comparing these findings with the
extant literature. The main strengths of the study include the
prospective longitudinal design that started in the preschool
period and includes neuroimaging and detailed measures of
emotion functioning and mental health.
Conclusions
ThefindingthatsimilarriskfactorsemergedlinkingearlyACEs
tobothincreaseddepressionseverityandphysicalhealthprob-
lems is intriguing. This suggests that a common biological em-
bedding process may operate linking early adversity and poor
emotional and physical health outcomes. This finding is glob-
ally consistent with the model proposed by Miller et al,13 al-
