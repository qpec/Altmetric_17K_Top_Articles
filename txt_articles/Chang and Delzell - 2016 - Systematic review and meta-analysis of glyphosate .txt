ABSTRACT
This systematic review and meta-analysis rigorously examines the relationship between glyphosate
exposure and risk of lymphohematopoietic cancer (LHC) including NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), multiple
myeloma (MM), and leukemia. Meta-relative risks (meta-RRs) were positive and marginally statistically
significant for the association between any versus no use of glyphosate and risk of NHL (meta-RR D 1.3,
95% confidence interval (CI) D 1.0–1.6, based on six studies) and MM (meta-RR D 1.4, 95% CI D 1.0–1.9;
four studies). Associations were statistically null for HL (meta-RR D 1.1, 95% CI D 0.7–1.6; two studies),
leukemia (meta-RR D 1.0, 95% CI D 0.6–1.5; three studies), and NHL subtypes except B-cell lymphoma
(two studies each). Bias and confounding may account for observed associations. Meta-analysis is
constrained by few studies and a crude exposure metric, while the overall body of literature is
methodologically limited and findings are not strong or consistent. Thus, a causal relationship has not
been established between glyphosate exposure and risk of any type of LHC.

Introduction
The broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate (N-(phosphono-
methyl)glycine), as a constituent of more than 750 products for
agricultural, forestry, urban, and residential applications, is the
most commonly used herbicide in the world. Therefore, under-
standing its potential human carcinogenicity has major impli-
cations for public health and risk assessment.
In 2014, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment
(BfR), on behalf of the European Union, reviewed all toxicolog-
ical studies of glyphosate in laboratory animals, as well as over
30 epidemiological studies in humans, and concluded that “the
available data do not show carcinogenic or mutagenic proper-
ties of glyphosate” and “there is no validated or significant rela-
tionship between exposure to glyphosate and an increased risk
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other types of cancer.”[1,2] This
conclusion was consistent with those previously reached by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
and the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), sponsored
by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), which
concluded that glyphosate was unlikely to be carcinogenic to
humans.[3–5]
By contrast, the International Agency for Research on Can-
cer (IARC) in 2015 classified glyphosate as “probably carcino-
genic to humans” (Group 2A). In arriving at this classification,
IARC characterized evidence of carcinogenicity in humans as
“limited,” based on the data available for non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma (NHL).[6] IARC considered the evidence of carcinoge-
nicity in experimental animals as “sufficient.” The latter
determination was based on the occurrence of renal tubule
carcinoma, hemangiosarcoma, and pancreatic islet-cell ade-
noma in rodents, as well as mechanistic evidence.
To incorporate the IARC classification into the European
Union review of glyphosate, BfR was commissioned by the Ger-
man government and the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) to review the IARC assessment.[7] In its subsequent
revised assessment report, BfR reached the conclusion that “no
carcinogenic risk to humans is to be expected from glyphosate
if it is used in the proper manner for the intended purpose.”[8]
This assessment was supported by all European Union member
states except one (Sweden) and by EFSA.[9] The WHO also has
established an expert taskforce to re-evaluate the available data
on glyphosate and report its findings to JMPR.[10]
In summarizing the epidemiological evidence, IARC stated
that “case-control studies in the USA, Canada, and Sweden
reported increased risks for NHL associated with exposure to
glyphosate. The increased risk persisted in the studies that
adjusted for exposure to other pesticides. The [Agricultural
Health Study] cohort did not show an excess of NHL. The
Working Group noted that there were excesses reported for
multiple myeloma in three studies; however, they did not
weight this evidence as strongly as that of NHL because of the
possibility that chance could not be excluded; none of the risk
estimates were statistically significant nor were they adjusted
for other pesticide exposures.”[6] A recent meta-analysis con-
ducted by investigators from IARC[11] found a statistically sig-
nificant positive association between glyphosate use and NHL
risk (meta-relative risk [RR] D 1.5, 95% confidence interval
[CI] D 1.1–2.0), based on six studies.[12–17] The same meta-
analysis also found a significant positive association between

 glyphosate use and risk of B-cell NHL, based on two
studies.[14,18]
Although Schinasi and Leon[11] stated that in their meta-
analysis, “[i]n an effort to use the most unbiased estimate,
[they] extracted the most adjusted effect estimate,” two or argu-
ably three of the RR estimates that they selected for inclusion
were not the most highly adjusted estimates reported by the
original authors.[13–15] Instead, in a personal communication
(11 August 2015), Dr. Schinasi indicated that other estimates
were selected based on considerations of consistency of esti-
mates across meta-analyses of other pesticides, secondary anal-
yses, and statistical modeling approach.
Meta-analyses are not intended to identify, validate, or dis-
pute causal relationships. Although they can be useful in pro-
viding a summary measure of association and identifying
heterogeneity among research results, they can obscure impor-
tant differences in methods and results among studies that can
be more thoroughly evaluated in a detailed qualitative review.
Schinasi and Leon[11] did not assess study quality and did not
specifically address the potential impact of study limitations on
the findings for glyphosate, nor did they discuss whether the
apparent association between glyphosate and NHL risk is likely
to be causal. On the other hand, Mink et al.[19] conducted a
qualitative systematic review, without a meta-analysis, of epide-
miologic studies of glyphosate and various cancers, including
NHL. Taking into account potential sources of error, including
selection bias, confounding, and especially exposure misclassifi-
cation, the authors concluded that they “found no consistent
pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship
between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific
cancer and exposure to glyphosate.”
Given the conflicting findings surrounding this issue, we
conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to examine
more rigorously the relationship between exposure to glypho-
sate and risk of NHL, as well as major histopathological sub-
types of NHL, in human epidemiologic studies. Because NHL
is often considered alongside other lymphohematopoietic can-
cers (LHC), whose ever-changing classification systems now
characterize some leukemias and multiple myeloma (MM) as
NHL subtypes,[20] we also included Hodgkin lymphoma (HL),
MM, and leukemia in this review. Despite the limitations of
quantitative meta-analysis for observational epidemiology,[21,22]
we conducted a meta-analysis largely to determine the impact
of using RR estimates not used in the meta-analysis by Schinasi
and Leon.[11] In addition, we conducted a qualitative evaluation
of potential for error and bias. Thus, this article goes beyond
previous work by examining all types of LHC, conducting a
new meta-analysis, providing a detailed evaluation of study
quality and potential for bias, and synthesizing the overall epi-
demiologic evidence for a causal association between glypho-
sate and LHC risk.
Methods
Literature search
Sources eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis were original
articles
describing
epidemiological
studies
that
provided
numeric point estimates of the RR (i.e., odds ratio, rate ratio, or
prevalence ratio) of LHC, including NHL, HL, MM, leukemia,
and any subtypes of these disease entities, associated with indi-
vidual-level glyphosate exposure, along with corresponding
interval estimates (e.g., 95% confidence intervals [CI]) or suffi-
cient raw data to calculate RRs and CIs. Reviews, commentar-
ies, letters to the editor without original data, and non-human
studies were excluded, as were articles that did not report quan-
titative measures of association between glyphosate exposure
(e.g., those assessing broadly defined categories of pesticides or
herbicides) and risk of LHC (e.g., those assessing other cancers
or all malignancies combined).
To identify all potentially relevant articles, we searched
MEDLINE via PubMed (Supplementary methods), with addi-
tional targeted searches in Web of Science and Google Scholar,
along with a review of the bibliographies of recent review
articles. Based on a review of titles and abstracts to exclude
articles without pertinent information, followed by a review of
the full text of relevant articles, 19 articles (as well as one letter
to the editor[23] that contained additional results from a study
described in another one of the included articles,[24] and one
abstract[25] that preceded a full-length article[26]) were ulti-
mately deemed eligible for inclusion (Appendix Fig. A1). Two
authors independently reviewed and agreed upon the list of eli-
gible articles.
Of the 19 articles reporting on the association between glyph-
osate and risk of specific forms of LHC, 12 pertained to NHL or
its subtypes (including hairy-cell leukemia, which is a subtype of
B-cell NHL),[12–18,24,27–30] 2 pertained to HL,[17,31] 6 pertained to
MM,[12,17,26,32–34] and 3 pertained to leukemia.[12,35,36]
Evaluation of study characteristics and quality
From each eligible study, we extracted the following informa-
tion: first author, publication year, study location, study design,
study years, source population, number of subjects, proportion
of proxy respondents, exposure assessment method, outcome
assessment method, confounders adjusted, number of subjects
in each exposure category, and RR estimates with CIs.
In addition to summarizing study characteristics, we qualita-
tively evaluated the methodological quality of each study in
terms of its potential for selection bias, information bias/expo-
sure misclassification, confounding, reporting bias, and other
issues affecting validity. Potential for bias was evaluated based
on subject identification strategy, participation rates, investiga-
tor blinding, assessment methods for exposures, outcomes, and
potential confounders, statistical approach, reporting of results,
and other considerations.[37–39]
Selection of data for meta-analysis
From each publication, we selected an RR point estimate for
inclusion in the meta-analysis based on a set of rules specified a
priori. First, if unadjusted and adjusted RRs were reported in a
publication or across multiple publications from the same study
population, the most fully adjusted RR was selected for inclu-
sion. The most fully adjusted RR was defined as the RR estimate
that took into consideration, by restriction or statistical adjust-
ment, the most covariates that appeared to be confounders.
The rationale for choosing the most fully adjusted RR was
JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH, PART B
403
 based on the assumption that the adjusted covariates were
found by the authors to act as confounders by altering the esti-
mate of association (either directly or by acting as a surrogate
for another, unmeasured confounder); however, some authors
did not explain how confounders were selected, so this assump-
tion may not hold for all studies. If an adjusted RR was not
reported, the unadjusted (crude) RR was included as reported
by the authors or as calculated from available raw data. Second,
if multiple eligible publications were derived from the same
study population, the RR from the most recent publication was
selected for inclusion unless it was based on a subset of the
overall eligible study population, in which case the RR based on
the most complete study population was included. Third, sub-
ject to the first two rules, the RR for dichotomous exposure
with the largest number of exposed cases was selected for inclu-
sion in the meta-analysis. In a few instances where another RR
from a given study nearly met these inclusion criteria but was
superseded by a more fully adjusted, more recent, or more
robust RR, the alternative RR was considered in secondary
analyses.
RRs for multiple categories of exposure also were extracted
to enable qualitative evaluation of exposure-response trends
(based on the assumption, discussed later, that studies were
able to distinguish among exposure levels). However, because
no two studies used the same set of three or more categories to
classify glyphosate exposure, these estimates could not be com-
bined in meta-analysis.
Statistical approach
For associations with at least two independent RR estimates
from different study populations, we estimated both fixed-
effects and random-effects meta-RRs with 95% CIs. We
used comparison of meta-RR estimates from fixed-effects
and random-effects models as one approach to the evalua-
tion of the impact of between-study heterogeneity on the
meta-RRs. As a quantitative measure of between-study het-
erogeneity, we calculated I2, which represents the percentage
of between-study variance in RRs that is attributable to
study heterogeneity (as opposed to chance).[40] We also
tested for statistically significant between-study heterogene-
ity based on Cochran’s Q statistic,[41] although this test has
low power to detect modest heterogeneity across a limited
number of studies.[42]
In the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity, the
presence of at least one statistically significant association, I2 <
50%, and at least four contributing studies, we evaluated evi-
dence of publication bias (i.e., non-random selection of studies
for publication, with a tendency toward submission and publi-
cation of studies that report larger, statistically significant asso-
ciations[43]) by using the linear regression approach of Egger
et al.,[44] which measures the degree of funnel plot asymmetry.
We also estimated meta-RRs corrected for publication bias by
imputing results for missing studies using the trim-and-fill pro-
cedure developed by Duval and Tweedie,[45] which iteratively
trims asymmetric studies from the overbalanced side of a fun-
nel plot to locate the unbiased effect, and then fills the plot by
re-inserting the trimmed studies on the original side of the
mean effect, along with their imputed counterparts on the
opposite side. Again, we used these approaches with the under-
standing that they have limited power to detect publication bias
based on few studies.[42]
The meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis Software (Biostat, Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA).
All calculated meta-RRs and 95% CIs were confirmed using
Episheet (www.krothman.org/episheet.xls).
Sensitivity analysis
To evaluate the robustness of results to various potential sour-
ces of heterogeneity, we planned a priori to conduct a sensitiv-
ity analysis with stratification of studies by study design (case-
control vs. cohort), source of controls (population-based vs.
hospital-based), gender (males only vs. males and females),
geographic region (North America vs. Europe), and time period
of cancer diagnosis (1980s, 1990s, or 2000s, with studies con-
tributing to a given stratum if any part of the case diagnosis
period was in a given decade).
Overall evaluation
To guide a qualitative assessment of the combined epidemio-
logic evidence for a causal relationship between glyphosate
exposure and risk of LHC, we used Sir Austin Bradford Hill’s
“viewpoints” as a general framework.[46] Because this review is
restricted to the epidemiologic literature, our consideration of
the biological plausibility of the association and the coherence
of the human, animal, and mechanistic evidence was limited.

 cohort study, evaluated the relationship between glyphosate
use and risk of NHL and/or its histopathological sub-
types.[12–18,24,27–30] Characteristics of these studies are sum-
marized in Table 1. All of the studies considered glyphosate
use in agricultural operations or settings, and most evaluated
overall NHL as an outcome. The exceptions were Cocco
et al.,[18] which analyzed B-cell lymphoma and other NHL
subtypes, but not overall NHL, and Nordstrom et al.,[30]
which included only hairy-cell leukemia. Eriksson et al.[14]
presented results for B-cell lymphoma and other NHL sub-
types, as well as for overall NHL, while Orsi et al.[17]
included results for overall NHL and several specific NHL
subtypes.
De Roos et al.[13] combined data from Cantor et al.[24] with
data from two other studies that did not independently report
associations between glyphosate use and NHL risk;[47,48] there-
fore, we did not further consider Cantor et al.[24] as a separate
study. Lee et al.[29] was based on Cantor et al.[24] and Hoar
Zahm et al.,[48] but not Hoar et al.,[47] and stratified results by
asthma status (with no apparent interaction between glypho-
sate exposure and asthma); therefore, results from De Roos
et al.[13] took precedence in our analysis over those from Lee
et al.[29] The study by Hardell et al.[15] pooled data from two
other studies that reported on glyphosate use and NHL
risk.[27,30] Consequently, the latter two studies were not consid-
ered further with respect to NHL, although Nordstrom et al.[30]
was evaluated separately with respect to hairy-cell leukemia.
Based on the same study population as McDuffie et al.[16]
(except for four fewer cases excluded after pathology review),
Hohenadel et al.[28] reported associations with use of glyphosate
with or without malathion, but not glyphosate overall; there-
fore, the results from McDuffie et al.[16] were prioritized in our
analysis.
The seven independent studies ranged markedly in size with
respect to the number of NHL cases classified as exposed to
glyphosate (based on reported use): Cocco et al.,[18] 4 B-cell
lymphoma cases exposed; Hardell et al.,[15] 8 exposed; Orsi
et al.,[17] 12 exposed; Eriksson et al.,[14] 29 exposed; De Roos
et al.,[13] 36 exposed; McDuffie et al.,[16] 51 exposed; De Roos
et al.,[12] 71 exposed in the total eligible cohort. Four studies
were based in Europe[14,15,17,18] and three in North Amer-
ica[12,13,16] (Table 1). Four of the case-control studies were pop-
ulation-based,[13–16]
one
was
hospital-based,[17]
and
one
included a mixture of population-based and hospital-based
cases
and
controls.[18]
Four
studies
were
restricted
to
males,[13,15–17] while the rest included males and females. Two
studies conducted at least some case ascertainment during the
1980s,[13,15] five during the 1990s,[12,14–16,18] and four during
the 2000s[12,14,17,18] (categories are overlapping). For reference,
glyphosate entered the U.S. and European commercial markets
in 1974.[49]
Studies of HL
Two case-control studies estimated the OR between glyphosate
use and risk of HL.[17,31] Characteristics of these studies are
summarized in Table 1. The study by Karunanayake et al.[31]
used the same methods and source population as McDuffie
et al.,[16] but focused on HL rather than NHL.
As described in the section on NHL studies, Orsi et al.[17]
was a hospital-based case-control study set in Europe (France),
restricted to males, with case ascertainment in the 2000s, par-
ticipation rates > 90%, and no proxy respondents. This study
classified six HL cases as exposed to glyphosate. Karunanayake
et al.[31] was a population-based case-control study set in North
America (Canada), restricted to males, with case ascertainment
in the 1990s, participation rates of 68% for cases and 48% for
controls, and an unspecified proportion of proxy respondents.
In this study, 38 HL cases were classified as glyphosate-exposed.
Studies of MM
Six studies from four independent study populations, including
four case-control studies and two prospective cohort studies,
evaluated the association between glyphosate use and risk of
MM.[12,17,26,32–34] These studies are described in Table 1. A
cross-sectional analysis within a subset of the Agricultural
Health Study Cohort examined the association between glypho-
sate use and risk of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown sig-
nificance (MGUS), an MM precursor;[50] this study was not
included in the present review.
The studies by De Roos et al.[12] and Sorahan[26] were based
on virtually identical datasets from the Agricultural Health
Study cohort (except that the dataset used by Sorahan was
stripped of data on race, state of residence, and applicator type
due to privacy concerns; these differences should not have
affected the results substantively). Because the Sorahan[26]
study included all eligible cohort members, whereas the De
Roos et al.[12] study was based on a restricted subset of the
cohort with complete data,[51] the Sorahan[26] results were pri-
oritized in our analysis of MM. Brown et al.[32] employed the
same methods and source population as Cantor et al.,[24] which
was included in the pooled analysis of NHL by De Roos
et al.[13] Pahwa et al.[34] and Kachuri et al.[33] conducted over-
lapping analyses in the same Canadian source population as
McDuffie et al.,[16] Hohenadel et al.,[28] and Karunanayake
et al.[31] Pahwa et al.[34] included more controls in their analy-
sis, but these controls were excluded from Kachuri et al.[33]
because they were younger than any enrolled MM cases (�29
years) and thus did not contribute meaningfully to the analysis.
Kachuri et al.[33] also controlled for more confounders, and
therefore was prioritized in our analysis.
With respect to glyphosate use, the four independent studies
of MM included, respectively, 5 exposed cases,[17] 11 exposed
cases,[32] 24 exposed cases,[26] and 32 exposed cases.[33] All but
one study, which was based in France,[17] were conducted in
North America, and all except one[26] were restricted to males.
One of the two case-control studies was population-based[32]
and the other was hospital-based.[17] Case ascertainment took
place during the early 1980s in one study,[32] at least partly dur-
ing the 1990s in two studies,[26,33] and at least partly during the
2000s in two studies.[17,26]
Studies of leukemia
Two case-control studies and one prospective cohort study inves-
tigated the relationship between glyphosate use and risk of leuke-
mia.[12,35,36] Key characteristics of these studies are provided in
Table 1. The study by Brown et al.[35] used the same methods

 and source population as Brown et al.,[32] which was described in
the section on MM, and Cantor et al.,[24] which was included as
part of De Roos et al.[13] in a pooled analysis of NHL.
As described earlier, De Roos et al.,[12] the only prospective
cohort study included, was based in North America (Iowa and
North Carolina), enrolled both males and females, ascertained
cancer incidence in the 1990s and 2000s, and had a 99.5% fol-
low-up rate through 2001. In the total eligible cohort, 43 leuke-
mia cases occurred among glyphosate users. Brown et al.[35]
was a population-based case-control study set in North Amer-
ica (Iowa and Minnesota), restricted to white males, with cases
identified in 1980–1983, participation rates of 86% for cases
and 77–79% for controls, and proxy respondent rates of 41%
for cases and 34% for controls. Fifteen leukemia cases in this
study were classified as having used glyphosate. The other case-
control study of leukemia, by Kaufman et al.,[36] was a hospital-
based study set in Asia (Thailand), with males and females,
case ascertainment in the 1990s and 2000s, participation rates
of 100%, and no proxy respondents for cases or controls.
Meta-analysis
NHL
All relevant RRs and 95% CIs for the association between
reported glyphosate use and risk of overall NHL, including
those not used in the meta-analysis, such as estimates
within subgroups, minimally adjusted estimates, and esti-
mates
of
exposure-response
patterns,
are
provided
in
Table 2. The estimates selected from each independent
study population for inclusion in the meta-analysis, accord-
ing to the rules specified in the methods section, are pro-
vided in Table 3.
As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1, the combined meta-RR
for overall NHL in association with any use of glyphosate,
based on six studies,[12–17] was 1.3 (95% CI D 1.0–1.6).
The results were identical in the random-effects and fixed-
effects models, suggesting limited between-study heteroge-
neity in the association. Little heterogeneity also was indi-
cated by the I2 value of 0.0% and the highly non-
significant P-value of 0.84 for Cochran’s Q. Given the lack
of heterogeneity and at least one statistically significant
association, we tested for publication bias using Egger’s
linear regression approach to evaluating funnel plot asym-
metry, and found no significant asymmetry (one-tailed P-
value D 0.20). Using Duval and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill
approach to adjust for publication bias, the imputed meta-
RR for both the random-effects and fixed-effects models
was 1.2 (95% CI D 1.0–1.6).
In secondary analyses, we replaced the RR estimated by De
Roos et al.[13] using a hierarchical (i.e., multistage) regression
model with the RR estimated using a more traditional logistic
regression model (Table 3). (The hierarchical regression RR was
selected for the primary analysis because, as stated by the
authors, hierarchical regression models can yield “increased pre-
cision and accuracy for the ensemble of estimates” when model-
ing
multiple
pesticides
simultaneously,
and
the
more
conservative
prior
assumptions
specified
in
these
models
“seemed appropriate in a largely exploratory analysis of multiple
exposures for which there is little prior knowledge about how
pesticide exposures interact in relation to the risk of NHL.”)
Using the logistic regression RR did not appreciably affect the
results of the meta-analysis (meta-RR D 1.3, 95% CI D 1.0–1.6;
identical for random-effects and fixed-effects models).
In another secondary analysis, we replaced the RR reported
by McDuffie et al.[16] with the results reported by Hohenadel
et al.[28] in the same study population (minus four previously
misclassified NHL cases) (Table 3). Because Hohenadel et al.[28]
reported two estimates for glyphosate use—one in the absence
of malathion use and one in the presence of malathion use—we
combined these two estimates into a single estimate (RR D
1.40, 95% CI D 0.62–3.15) using random-effects meta-analysis.
Using this alternative estimate also did not appreciably affect
the meta-RR (1.3, 95% CI D 1.0–1.7; identical for random-
effects and fixed-effects models). Finally, using both the logistic
regression RR instead of the hierarchical regression RR from
De Roos et al.[13] and the combined RR from Hohenadel
et al.[28] instead of the RR from McDuffie et al.[16] slightly but
non-significantly increased the meta-RR to 1.4 (95% CI D 1.0–
1.8; identical for random-effects and fixed-effects models)
(Table 3).
As noted earlier, in their meta-analysis of the association
between
glyphosate
use
and
NHL
risk,
Schinasi
and
Leon[11] included RR estimates from Eriksson et al.[14] and
Hardell et al.[15] that were not the most highly adjusted esti-
mates reported by the authors (shown in Table 2 as univari-
ate odds ratios). They also used the logistic regression
estimate from De Roos et al.[13] that arguably was not as
highly adjusted as the hierarchical regression estimate.
When we included these estimates in the meta-analysis,
along with the same estimates from De Roos et al.,[13]
McDuffie et al.,[16] and Orsi et al.[17] as included in our
main
meta-analysis,
we
obtained
the
same
results
as
reported by Schinasi and Leon:[11] random-effects meta-RR
D 1.5, 95% CI D 1.1–2.0 (I2 D 32.7%, pheterogeneity D 0.19).
The fixed-effects meta-RR based on these estimates (not
reported by Schinasi and Leon[11]) was 1.4 (95% CI D 1.1–
1.8).
NHL subtypes
All reported RRs and 95% CIs for the association between
glyphosate use and risk of various NHL subtypes are shown in
Table 2. The estimates included in meta-analyses, which were
conducted for B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma,
follicular lymphoma, and hairy-cell leukemia (i.e., all NHL sub-
types for which at least two estimates from independent studies
were available), are shown in Table 3. Too few studies of any
given NHL subtype were conducted to justify testing for publi-
cation bias.
The meta-RR for the association between any use of
glyphosate and risk of B-cell lymphoma, based on two stud-
ies,[14,18] was 2.0 (95% CI D 1.1–3.6) according to both the
random-effects and the fixed-effects model (I2 D 0.0%, phe-
terogeneity D 0.58) (Table 3). These results are the same as
reported by Schinasi and Leon.[11] The four B-cell lym-
phoma cases who were classified by Cocco et al.[18] as hav-
ing used glyphosate consisted of one patient with diffuse
large
B-cell
lymphoma,
one
with
chronic
lymphocytic

 leukemia, one with unspecified B-cell lymphoma, and one
with MM. Eriksson et al.[14] did not report the number of
exposed cases, but overall the B-cell lymphomas in their
study comprised 29% diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 24%
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia/small
lymphocytic
lym-
phoma, 20% follicular lymphoma grades I–III, 16% other
specified B-cell lymphoma, and 11% unspecified B-cell lym-
phoma; MM cases were not included.
The meta-RR for the association between any use of glypho-
sate and risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, based on two
studies,[14,17] was 1.1 (95% CI D 0.5–2.3) using both the ran-
dom-effects
and
the
fixed-effects
models
(I2
D
0.0%,
pheterogeneity D 0.79) (Table 3).
Based on the same two studies,[14,17] the meta-RR for the
association between any use of glyphosate and risk of
chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma
was 1.3 (95% CI D 0.2–10.0) according to the random-
effects model and 1.9 (95% CI D 0.9–4.0) according to the
fixed-effects model, with significant heterogeneity between
the two included estimates (I2 D 83.7%, pheterogeneity D 0.01)
(Table 3).
Results for follicular lymphoma from these two studies,[14,17]
by contrast, were not significantly heterogeneous (I2 D 0.0%,
pheterogeneity D 0.73), with a meta-RR of 1.7 (95% CI D 0.7–3.9)
in both the random-effects and the fixed-effects models
(Table 3).

 Finally, the two studies that reported associations between
any glyphosate use and risk of hairy-cell leukemia[17,30] yielded
a meta-RR of 2.5 (95% CI D 0.9–7.3) in the random-effects and
fixed-effects models (I2 D 0.0%, pheterogeneity D 0.63) (Table 3).
HL
Both of the published, fully adjusted RRs and 95% CIs for the
association between any glyphosate use and HL risk (Table 2)
were included in the meta-analysis (Table 3). Based on two
studies,[17,31] the meta-RR was 1.1 (95% CI D 0.7–1.6) in both
the random-effects and the fixed-effects models, with I2 D 0.0%
and pheterogeneity D 0.36 (Table 3). Publication bias was not eval-
uated due to the availability of only two studies of HL.
MM
All relevant RRs and 95% CIs for the association between
glyphosate use and risk of MM, including estimates that did
not contribute to the meta-analysis, are shown in Table 2. The
independent estimates selected for inclusion in the meta-analy-
sis are shown in Table 3.
The combined meta-RR for the association between any
glyphosate use and risk of MM, based on four stud-
ies,[17,26,32,33] was 1.4 (95% CI D 1.0–1.9) according to the
random-effects and fixed-effects models (Table 3, Fig. 2).
On the basis of the I2 value of 0.0% and the P-value of 0.63
for Cochran’s Q statistic, between-study heterogeneity was
not evident. Egger’s linear regression approach yielded no
significant evidence of publication bias (one-tailed P-value
for asymmetry D 0.10), while the imputed meta-RR using
the trim-and-fill procedure to adjust for publication bias
was 1.3 (95% CI D 0.9–1.8).
Several secondary analyses were conducted for MM by
replacing RRs in the primary meta-analysis with alternative esti-
mates (Table 3). When the RR reported by De Roos et al.,[12]
who excluded cohort members with missing data from their
analysis, was substituted for the one reported by Sorahan,[26]
who included such subjects by creating a separate category for
missing or unknown data, the meta-RR was slightly increased
to 1.5 (95% CI D 1.0–2.1) and was the same for random-effects
and fixed-effects models. When the main RR from Kachuri
et al.[33] was replaced with the RR from the same study after
exclusion of data reported by proxy respondents, the meta-RR
was not appreciably different from the original estimate (alter-
native meta-RR D 1.4, 95% CI D 0.9–1.9 in random-effects and
fixed-effects models). Another secondary analysis included the
RR reported by Pahwa et al.,[34] who adjusted for a slightly dif-
ferent (and smaller) set of confounders than Kachuri et al.[33]
and also retained controls who were too young to have any age-
matched MM cases in this Canadian study. This change had
minimal impact on the meta-RR (1.4, 95% CI D 1.0–2.0; same
for random-effects and fixed-effects models). When both the De
Roos et al.[12] and the Pahwa et al.[34] substitutions were made,
the resultant meta-RR was the same as that when only De Roos
et al.[12] was used (meta-RR D 1.5, 95% CI D 1.0–1.2 in ran-
dom-effects and fixed-effects models).
Leukemia
Of the four published RRs and 95% CIs for the association
between any use of glyphosate and risk of leukemia (Table 2),
three (excluding one age-adjusted RR in favor of a more fully
adjusted RR from De Roos et al.[12]) were included in the meta-
analysis (Table 3). The meta-RR based on three studies[12,35,36]
was 1.0 (95% CI D 0.6–1.5) using the random-effects model
and the fixed-effects model (I2 D 0.0%,
pheterogeneity D 0.92)
(Table 3). Publication bias was not assessed because only three
studies of leukemia were available.
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was conducted for overall NHL only
(Table 4), because other outcomes had an insufficient num-
ber of studies for stratification. In all strata, the random-
effects and fixed-effects meta-RRs were identical and I2 was
0.0%. Results did not differ substantially from the main
meta-RR (1.3, 95% CI D 1.0–1.6) when the analysis was
restricted to case-control studies (meta-RR D 1.3, 95% CI D
1.0–1.7) or those with population-based controls (meta-RR
D 1.4, 95% CI D 1.0–1.8). Meta-analysis could not be con-
ducted for cohort studies or studies with hospital-based
Figure 2. Forest plots of relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between glyphosate exposure and risk of multiple myeloma.
Meta-RRs were identical in random-effects and fixed-effects models.

 controls because only one of each of these study types was
available. No major differences were detected between stud-
ies restricted to males (meta-RR D 1.3, 95% CI D 1.0–1.7)
and those that included males and females (meta-RR D 1.2,
95% CI D 0.8–1.8) or between those conducted in North
America (meta-RR D 1.2, 95% CI D 1.0–1.6) and those con-
ducted in Europe (meta-RR D 1.3, 95% CI D 0.8–2.1).
Prompted by Schinasi and Leon,[11] we also conducted a
stratified meta-analysis of the two studies conducted in Swe-
den[14,15] and found a stronger, albeit statistically non-signif-
icant, association in these particular studies (meta-RR D 1.6,
95% CI D 0.9–2.8). The estimated meta-RR declined some-
what from studies that ascertained cases in the 1980s (meta-
RR D 1.6, 95% CI D 1.0–2.7) to those conducted in the
1990s (meta-RR D 1.2, 95% CI D 1.0–1.6) to those con-
ducted in the 2000s (meta-RR D 1.2, 95% CI D 0.8–1.7).
Exposure-response trends
NHL and subtypes. Three studies evaluated exposure-response
trends between glyphosate use and NHL risk, with exposure
classified as cumulative lifetime[12,14] or annual[16] days of
glyphosate use (Table 2). Two studies detected some evidence
of a positive exposure-response trend (statistical significance
not reported),[14,16] whereas the other did not.[12] All of these
studies relied wholly or in part on evaluating days of glyphosate
use in an attempt to quantify exposure; however, this metric
has been shown to be a poor indicator of actual glyphosate
dose received.[52]
In a model adjusted for age, sex, and year of diagnosis or
enrollment, Eriksson et al.[14] found that the RR of NHL was
higher with > 10 days of lifetime glyphosate use (RR D 2.36,
95% CI D 1.04–5.37) than with � 10 days (RR D 1.69, 95%
CI D 0.70–4.07), compared with no pesticide use. Also, the RR
of NHL was higher after more than 10 years since first use of
glyphosate (RR D 2.26, 95% CI D 1.16–4.40) than after 1–
10 years (RR D 1.11, 95% CI D 0.24–5.08). Statistical tests for
trend were not performed, and exposure-response analyses
adjusted for other potential confounders (i.e., 2-methyl-4-
chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyace-
tic acid (2,4,5-T) and/or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-
D), mercurial seed dressing, arsenic, creosote, and tar) were not
presented, even though adjustment for these characteristics
attenuated the RR for overall glyphosate use from 2.02 to 1.51.
McDuffie et al.[16] reported that the RR for more than two
days of glyphosate use per year (RR = 2.12, 95% CI D 1.20–
3.73) was higher than that for up to two days per year (RR D
1.00, 95% CI D 0.63–1.57), compared with never use, adjusting
for age and province of residence. Tests for a significant expo-
sure-response trend were not performed, and results were not
reported after adjustment for other potential confounders (i.e.,
personal medical history and family history of cancer; adjust-
ment for these characteristics attenuated the RR for overall
glyphosate use from 1.26 to 1.20) or significantly associated
pesticides (i.e., aldrin, dicamba, and mecoprop) in this study
population.
The most detailed analysis of glyphosate-NHL exposure-
response trends was performed by De Roos et al.,[12] who exam-
ined tertiles of cumulative lifetime days of glyphosate use (1–20,
21–56, or 57–2,678 days) and tertiles of intensity-weighted
cumulative days of use (i.e., years of use £ days per year £
intensity level, where intensity was defined as (mixing status C
application method C equipment repair status) £ personal
protective equipment use). In analyses adjusted for age, educa-
tion, smoking, alcohol, family history of cancer, and state of
residence, no significant trend was detected for NHL risk in
association with increasing cumulative days of glyphosate use
(RRs for tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively D 1.0 (referent), 0.7
(95% CI D 0.4–1.4), and 0.9 (95% CI D 0.5–1.6); ptrend D 0.73)
or intensity-weighted cumulative exposure days (RRs D 1.0
(referent), 0.6 (95% CI D 0.3–1.1), and 0.8 (95% CI D 0.5–1.4);
ptrend D 0.99).
Exposure-response trends between glyphosate use and risk
of specific NHL subtypes were not evaluated in any of the
included studies.
HL. No studies assessed exposure-response trends between
glyphosate use and risk of HL.
MM. Three
studies
reported
exposure-response
trends
between glyphosate use and MM risk, including the two analy-
ses based on the same Agricultural Health Study cohort data-
set[12,26] and the Canadian case-control study[33] (Table 2). The
case-control study found mixed evidence of a positive trend
(statistical significance not reported), while a positive trend was
detected in one analysis of the cohort data[12] but not the
other.[25]
The Canadian case-control study found a lower risk of MM
among those who used glyphosate for up to two days per year
than those who had never used glyphosate (RR D 0.72, 95%
CI D 0.39–1.32).[33] However, risk was higher in those with
more than two days of glyphosate use per year (RR D 2.04, 95%
CI D 0.98–4.23), adjusting for age, province of residence, proxy
status, smoking, personal medical history, and family history of
cancer. Results were similar after exclusion of data reported by
proxy subjects. The authors did not conduct statistical tests for
exposure-response trends.
Based on the 55% of Agricultural Health Study cohort mem-
bers who had available exposure and covariate data, De Roos
et al.[12] reported a positive, albeit statistically non-significant,
trend between MM risk and increasing tertiles of cumulative
days of glyphosate use (RRs for tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively
D 1.0 (referent), 1.1 (95% CI D 0.4–3.5), and 1.9 (95% CI D
0.6–6.3); ptrend D 0.27) or intensity-weighted cumulative days
of use (RRs D 1.0 (referent), 1.2 (95% CI D 0.4–3.8), and 2.1
(95% CI D 0.6–7.0); ptrend D 0.17). These estimates were
adjusted for age, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of
cancer, state of residence, the five pesticides for which cumula-
tive-use variables were most highly associated with glyphosate
cumulative use days (i.e., 2,4-D, alachlor, atrazine, metolachlor,
and trifluralin), and the five pesticides that were most highly
associated with ever use of glyphosate (i.e., benomyl, maneb,
paraquat, carbaryl, and diazinon). When intensity alone was
analyzed in association with MM risk, the RR for the highest
versus the lowest tertile was 0.6 (95% CI D 0.2–1.8), indicating
that the suggested trend was due only to total days of use.
When subjects who never used glyphosate were set as the refer-
ence group, the RRs for tertiles 1, 2, and 3 of cumulative days

 of use were 2.3 (95% CI D 0.6–8.9), 2.6 (95% CI D 0.6–11.5),
and 4.4 (95% CI D 1.0–20.2); ptrend D 0.09. When cumulative
use was categorized into quartiles, the RR for the highest quar-
tile
versus
never
use
was
6.6
(95%
CI
D
1.4–30.6);
ptrend D 0.01.
In contrast to De Roos et al.,[12] Sorahan[26] included more
than 53,000 eligible cohort members in the analysis (excluding
only those with a history of cancer before enrollment, loss to
follow-up, missing data on age at enrollment, or missing data
on glyphosate use) by creating separate categories for missing
or unknown exposure and covariate data. Adjusting for age,
sex, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of cancer, and
the same 10 pesticides as De Roos et al.,[12] the RRs for each
tertile of cumulative days of glyphosate use, compared with
never use, were 1.14 (95% CI D 0.43–3.03), 1.52 (95% CI D
0.54–4.34), and 1.38 (95% CI D 0.42–4.45); ptrend D 0.48
using category scores of 1–4, ptrend > 0.50 using mean expo-
sures within categories. RRs for increasing tertiles of intensity-
weighted days of use versus never use were 1.00 (95% CI D
0.33–3.00), 1.27 (95% CI D 0.45–3.56), and 1.87 (95% CI D
0.67–5.27); ptrend D 0.22 using scores, ptrend D 0.18 using
means. When Sorahan[26] expanded the eligible cohort to
55,934 subjects to include those with unknown use of glypho-
sate, he again detected no significant exposure-response trends
with respect to either cumulative days of use (for tertiles 1, 2,
and 3 and unknown use versus never use, respectively, RRs D
1.11 (95% CI D 0.44–2.83), 1.45 (95% CI D 0.54–3.88), 1.17
(95% CI D 0.40–3.41), and 1.19 (95% CI D 0.25–5.65); ptrend
> 0.50 across categories of known use using scores or means,
excluding unknown) or intensity-weighted cumulative days of
use (RRs D 0.95 (95% CI D 0.33–2.75), 1.19 (95% CI D
0.44–3.19), 1.58 (95% CI D 0.62–4.05), and 1.04 (95% CI D
0.22–4.92); ptrend D 0.30 using scores, ptrend D 0.26 using
means, excluding unknown).
Leukemia. The De Roos et al.[12] study based on the Agri-
cultural Health Study cohort was the only study that
reported exposure-response trends between glyphosate use
and risk of leukemia (Table 2). No significant trend was
observed between increasing tertiles of cumulative days of
glyphosate use (RRs D 1.0 (referent), 1.9 (95% CI D 0.8–
4.5), and 1.0 (95% CI D 0.4–2.9) for tertiles 1, 2, and 3,
respectively; ptrend D 0.61) or intensity-weighted cumulative
days of use (RRs D 1.0 (referent), 1.9 (95% CI D 0.8–4.7),
and 0.7 (95% CI D 0.2–2.1); ptrend D 0.11), adjusting for
demographic
and
lifestyle
factors
as
well
as
other
pesticides.
Evaluation of bias
Selection bias
All studies of the association between glyphosate exposure and
risk of LHC were case-control studies except for the Agricul-
tural Health Study, the prospective cohort study that served as
the basis for the studies by De Roos et al.[12] and Sorahan.[26] In
case-control studies, differences in participation patterns
between cases and controls can result in selection bias if partici-
pation is related to the exposure of interest. In cohort studies,
selection bias can occur if loss to follow-up is related to the
exposure and outcome of interest or, less commonly, if baseline
participation differs by exposure status and risk of developing
the outcome of interest in the future (e.g., based on having a
positive family history of an outcome with a genetic susceptibil-
ity component). Selection bias in any study also can occur if
inclusion in the data analysis, e.g., predicated on data complete-
ness, differs by exposure and outcome status. In general, lower
participation, follow-up, or data completeness and large differ-
ences in participation between groups increase the potential
magnitude of selection bias.
Table 1 shows the reported participation and follow-up pro-
portions in all reviewed studies. Most studies did not report
data completeness. The substantial differences in participation
between cases and controls in the European multi-center
study,[18] the most recent Swedish study,[14] and the Canadian
study, which also had relatively low absolute participation pro-
portions of <70% for cases and <50% for controls,[16,28,31,33,34]
are of particular concern. However, the smaller discrepancies
between case and control participation in other studies also
could have produced selection bias. Moreover, even identical
participation by cases and controls can obscure differences in
reasons for study participation that could result in bias.
Given that several case-control studies were originally
designed to evaluate associations between pesticides and risk of
LHC,[13–16,28,31–35] it is plausible that cases with a history of
agricultural pesticide use were more likely than controls to par-
ticipate, thereby biasing results toward a positive association
for glyphosate as well as other pesticides. It is also possible that
certain sources of controls in some of these studies (e.g., resi-
dential telephone calls and voter lists) were more likely to iden-
tify individuals who were not farmers, again biasing results
toward a positive association. Investigators from the Canadian
study[16,28,31,33,34] reported that an analysis of postal codes
showed that respondents and non-respondents did not differ
significantly in terms of rural versus urban residence, but they
could not examine differences in occupation or pesticide use.
Although the initial follow-up completion of >99% in the
Agricultural Health Study was high,[12,25] the sizeable propor-
tions of subjects with missing data raise concerns about selec-
tion bias. Specifically, 88% of the eligible cohort (excluding
those who were diagnosed with cancer before enrollment or
were lost to follow-up) provided usable data on ever use of
glyphosate and key demographic and lifestyle covariates, 73%
additionally provided data on use of other pesticides, 65–66%
contributed to analyses of cumulative days of glyphosate use
(with or without intensity weighting), and 55% contributed to
analyses of cumulative use additionally adjusted for other pesti-
cides. Questionnaire completion could conceivably have varied
by demographic and lifestyle factors that are associated with
LHC risk, thereby producing bias. Neither analysis accounted
for missing data using methods such as multiple imputation or
inverse probability weighting.
Differential data completeness by disease status is more
likely to occur in case-control studies, such as the pooled Mid-
western U.S. study conducted by De Roos et al.[13] In this study,
the analysis of multiple pesticides excluded 25% of cases and
25% of controls who lacked complete data. Although the overall
frequency of missing data was the same between cases and con-
trols, this exclusion could have led to selection bias if subjects’
JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH, PART B
419
 reasons for providing complete data, and thus being included in
the analysis, differed by disease status and were related to
glyphosate exposure status. The authors also excluded subjects
who had lived or worked on a farm before age 18 years. If
glyphosate use was more common in such subjects, then RR
estimates would have been biased upward if a childhood farm
environment was inversely associated with NHL risk[53] and
biased downward if the association was positive.[54]
Exposure misclassification
All of the included studies assessed use of glyphosate and other
pesticides based on self-reported information (Table 1), which
is prone to various types of error, such as better recall by cases
than controls and by subjects than proxies, inaccurate recall of
specific pesticides and amounts used, and a lack of the best
measure of biological dose received.[55] Thus, probable expo-
sure misclassification is a key limitation of all of these studies.
The degree of misclassification may vary by mode of data col-
lection, for example, by written questionnaire, telephone inter-
view, or in-person interview.[56] The extent of misclassification
also may depend on questionnaire structure, for example,
whether subjects were asked in an open-ended manner to
report use of any pesticides or whether they were prompted to
report use of specific pesticides based on a prepared list.[57]
Some authors did not clearly describe the structure of their
study’s questions on pesticide use.
Of the eight independent study populations included in this
review (seven studies of NHL with or without other types of
LHC and one study of leukemia), three provided information
on validation of their exposure assessment methods: the Cana-
dian case-control study,[16,28,31,33,34] the Agricultural Health
Study,[12,26] and the Kansas case-control study[47] that contrib-
uted to the pooled Midwestern U.S. study by De Roos et al.[13]
Overall, these studies do not establish the validity of self-
reported information on glyphosate use; rather, the limited
results suggest considerable error and inconsistency in such
data.
Specifically, in the Canadian study, Dosman et al.[58] reported
on the results of a validation pilot study of 21 volunteer farmers
whose self-reported pesticide use was compared with written
records of pesticide purchases through their local agrochemical
supplier. Of the 21 farmers, 17 (81%) had a supplier who had
retained written records; the remaining four transactions were
conducted with cash. Based on the written records, 146 (65%)
of 226 chemicals reported by farmers were verified; 50 of the
unverified reports were potentially explained by aerial applica-
tions, home and garden use, use more than five years in the past
(i.e., during 1958–1984), or use outside of Canada. In 32 instan-
ces (for 25 chemicals) the suppliers’ records indicated a pur-
chase of chemicals that was unreported by the farmer; 2 of these
were for glyphosate. Detailed self-reported exposure (e.g., fre-
quency, intensity, and duration of use of specific pesticides)
could not be validated in this pilot study.
Likewise, Hoar et al.[47] reported that suppliers for 110 sub-
jects in the Kansas study (out of 130 sought) were located and
provided information on the subjects’ crops and herbicide and
insecticide purchases as “corroborative evidence” of self-
reported pesticide use. The authors observed that suppliers usu-
ally reported less pesticide use than subjects; that agreement on
specific years of use was better for insecticide use than herbicide
use; that the differences between agreement for cases and con-
trols were not consistent; and that agreement between suppliers
and subjects was better for pesticide use within the last 10 years
than for earlier use. Quantitative results on concordance were
not provided by Hoar et al.,[47] but in a summary of this study
shared with Dosman et al.[58] the authors stated that reports on
herbicide use agreed 59% of the time, with little variation by
crop type, and that reports on insecticide use also agreed 59%
of the time, but differed by crop type.
In the Agricultural Health Study, the reliability of the ques-
tion on ever having mixed or applied glyphosate was evaluated
by comparing responses to two questionnaires completed one
year apart by 3,763 pesticide applicators.[59] Agreement on a pos-
itive response to the question was 82%, and the kappa statistic
value for inter-rater agreement was moderate (0.54, 95% CI D
0.52–0.58). For more detailed questions about glyphosate use,
including years mixed or applied, days per year mixed or
applied, and decade first applied, the percentage with exact
agreement ranged from 52% to 62% and kappa ranged from
0.37 to 0.71. These metrics evaluated only the reliability (i.e.,
reproducibility) of self-reported glyphosate use, not its accuracy.
Subsequent exposure validation studies for other pesticides
in the Agricultural Health Study, based on comparisons
between exposure intensity estimated from an expert-derived
algorithm using self-reported or directly observed exposure
data and pesticide biomarker levels measured in urine, yielded
Spearman correlation coefficients between 0.4 and 0.8, depend-
ing on the type of pesticide.[60,61] Correlations with urinary
biomarker levels were poorer for self-reported determinants of
pesticide exposure such as kilograms of active ingredient,
hours spent mixing and applying, and number of acres treated,
with correlation coefficients of ¡0.4 to 0.2, but application
method and use of personal protective equipment were found
to be important determinants of exposure intensity. However,
the latter factors were evaluated in the study questionnaire
only for pesticides or pesticide classes in general, not for glyph-
osate or other individual pesticides;[62] thus, limitations remain
in the assessment of specific pesticide exposures.
Several studies included a sizeable proportion of surveys that
were completed by proxy respondents for deceased or other-
wise unavailable cases and controls (Table 1). The use of expo-
sure data reported by surrogates most likely resulted in even
poorer accuracy of exposure information in these studies.
Although some exposure misclassification may have been non-
differential by disease status, such error does not inevitably
result in underestimated exposure-disease associations unless
additional strict conditions are met, such as independence
from other classification errors.[63,64]
Furthermore, differential exposure misclassification in case-
control studies can readily result in overestimated associations.
Reasonable scenarios include more accurate and/or detailed
recollection of past exposures by cases, who are more motivated
than controls to try to understand the potential causes of their
disease; false recollection by cases, who are more aware of sci-
entific hypotheses or media reports that a certain exposure has
been linked to their disease; and unconscious influence by
study investigators who are aware of causal hypotheses and
subjects’ case-control status. Only the authors of the Swedish
420
E. T. CHANG AND E. DELZELL
 studies,[14,15] the French study,[17] and the Nebraska compo-
nent of the pooled Midwestern U.S. study[48] specifically stated
that investigators were blinded to case-control status. In reality,
such blinding is often difficult to achieve in studies that collect
interview data.
Others have discussed in detail the problems of estimating
individual subjects’ exposure to glyphosate from responses to
interviews and questionnaires asking about days of use, mixing
and application procedures, use of personal protective equip-
ment, and other work practices.[19,52] Acquavella et al.[52]
reported that any given day of pesticide use can entail highly
variable amounts of pesticides used and numbers of mixing
operations, and that urine concentrations of glyphosate were
poorly correlated with lifetime average exposure intensity
scores derived from data self-reported by farmers using this
agent. Although recall bias between cases and controls generally
might be anticipated to affect all specific pesticides (including
glyphosate) equally, variation in the degree of misclassification
due to these and other factors affecting usage and exposure
could result in different pesticide-specific associations.
Most of the case-control studies did not use procedures to
exclude glyphosate exposure that might have occurred after dis-
ease onset. The Swedish studies omitted glyphosate use within
one year prior to diagnosis or the index date in controls,[15,30]
or within the same calendar year or the year before.[14] In some
cases, however, these restrictions may not have been sufficient
to exclude exposure that occurred during the latency period
between disease onset and diagnosis. Inclusion of any such
post-disease exposure would have led to misclassification.
Finally, exposure misclassification resulting from the crude
dichotomization of glyphosate use as ever versus never is an
important limitation of most of the included studies. This clas-
sification conflates individuals with considerably different fre-
quencies, intensities, and durations of glyphosate use, and
precludes potentially informative analyses of any gradient in
LHC risk with increasing glyphosate exposure. As described
earlier in the section on exposure-response trends, only three
independent studies reported on glyphosate use in more than
two (ever vs. never) categories, and only the Agricultural
Health Study evaluated more than three exposure categories.
Confounding
As shown in Table 1, the degree of control for confounding var-
ied widely among the reviewed studies. Although several stud-
ies considered potential confounding by other pesticides or
pesticide families, only a minority[12–15,26,28] reported RR esti-
mates for the association between glyphosate use and LHC risk
adjusted for use of other pesticides. Given that Schinasi and
Leon[11] found significant associations between NHL risk and
several other types of pesticides, including carbamate insecti-
cides, organophosphorus insecticides, lindane, and MCPA, and
numerous other associations of specific pesticides with LHC
risk have been reported in the literature (e.g.,[65,66])—and
because most people who use pesticides occupationally are
exposed to multiple pesticides—it is important to control for
confounding, whether direct or indirect (if pesticides are surro-
gates for other risk factors), by these agents.
None of the studies controlled for potential confounding by
agricultural exposures other than pesticides, such as other
agricultural chemicals, farm animals, allergens, and infectious
agents. These exposures have been hypothesized, and in some
studies shown, to be associated with risk of NHL, HL, MM, or
leukemia,[67–73] and they are probably correlated with glyphosate
use, making them potential confounders of associations between
glyphosate and LHC risk. Medical history, certain infections,
diet, alcohol consumption, and obesity also may be associated
with risk of these malignancies[74–77] and could vary by glypho-
sate use, again making them possible confounders. Even in stud-
ies where numerous confounders were included in multivariable
regression models, crude categorization or other misclassification
of confounders could have enabled residual confounding of
observed associations. The direction and magnitude of con-
founding depend on the relationships of each factor with glyph-
osate use and LHC risk, and are therefore difficult to predict.
Other issues
Additional issues related to the design, conduct, and reporting
of the included studies also could have affected study results
and their interpretation. For instance, Hardell et al.[15] enrolled
some prevalent rather than incident cases, since eligible NHL
cases were diagnosed in 1987–1990 but interviewed in 1993–
1995.[27] The relatively long time interval between diagnosis
and interview may have hampered recollection of past expo-
sures, thereby undermining the accuracy of self-reported expo-
sure data in this study. The delay between diagnosis and
interview also almost certainly increased the proportion of
cases and matched controls who were deceased (43%) and had
proxy interviews, leading to further exposure misclassification.
In the studies by De Roos et al.[13] and Brown et al.,[32,35]
LHC cases were diagnosed in 1979–1986, 1980–1983, and
1980–1984, respectively. With glyphosate having come to mar-
ket in 1974, the cases in these studies would have had a rela-
tively short potential induction time since first use of
glyphosate. However, few studies to date have considered the
issue of induction time. The Agricultural Health Study collected
information on decade of first use of glyphosate in the baseline
questionnaire for private pesticide applicators,[62] but did not
use this information in the published analysis.[12] If glyphosate
is a cause of LHC, the actual induction time is unknown
because the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not established.
Orsi et al.,[17] Kaufman et al.,[36] and four of the six study
centers included in Cocco et al.[18] enrolled hospital-based
rather than population-based cases and controls. Given that
farmers have lower hospitalization rates than non-farmers,[78]
hospital-based controls may be less likely than population-
based controls to report agricultural occupational exposures,
including pesticides, thereby resulting in overestimated RRs for
pesticide use. On the other hand, occupational injuries are
more common in agriculture than in general private indus-
try,[79] possibly leading to oversampling of farmers from hospi-
tal trauma/emergency and orthopedics departments, which
might result in underestimated RRs. We did not observe any
meaningful change in the meta-RR after restriction to popula-
tion-based case-control studies.
As noted in Table 1, many possible analyses were not con-
ducted or not reported by authors. De Roos et al.[13] specifically
acknowledged that they did not report results for pesticide
combinations that were analyzed but yielded statistically null
JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH, PART B
421
 associations for joint effects, and Hohenadel et al.[28] likewise
did not show results for pesticide combinations without evi-
dence of joint effects. Most other authors did not explicitly state
when null results were not reported, but the Methods sections
of several papers suggested that certain analyses were per-
formed, yet not shown. Given the widespread predilection for
emphasizing statistically significant associations in published
research articles,[80] unreported results probably are usually sta-
tistically null. The omission of null results is a form of reporting
bias that favors positive associations.
Other evidence suggests that statistically null associations
between glyphosate and LHC risk have been underreported in
the epidemiologic literature. For example, two of the studies
that contributed to the pooled analysis conducted by De Roos
et al.[13] apparently collected information on glyphosate use,
yet associations between glyphosate and NHL risk were not
reported in the original publications.[47,48] In an analysis of
interactions between pesticide use and asthma, allergies, or hay
fever diagnosis in relation to NHL risk in the Canadian case-
control study,[81] results were reported for several specific pesti-
cides, but not glyphosate, even though information was avail-
able for glyphosate use. The most probable scenario in each of
these cases is that no significant association was detected
between glyphosate use and NHL risk. The omission of such
results from the published literature represents a distortion of
the body of epidemiologic evidence.
The largest number of studies included in any of the meta-
analyses described here was six (in the analysis of NHL), and
the majority of meta-analyses (of HL, B-cell lymphoma, diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small
lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and hairy-cell
leukemia) included only two studies. The small number of
available studies limits the robustness of the estimated meta-
RRs, as well as the ability to perform informative sensitivity
analysis and evaluation of heterogeneity and publication bias.
Even with 10 contributing studies (which we lacked), the statis-
tical power to detect modest heterogeneity using Cochran’s Q
statistic is “low.”[42] The small number of studies also provides
little opportunity to qualitatively investigate possible sources of
heterogeneity by subject characteristics or study design. Thus,
the results of the meta-analyses and related statistical tests
reported here should be interpreted cautiously in light of the
sparse and possibly selectively published literature, as well as
the high potential for bias and confounding in most of the
available studies.
Overall evaluation
The validity of the meta-RRs for glyphosate use and LHC risk
reported here and by others[11] is uncertain because systematic
error due to bias and confounding cannot reasonably be ruled
out as explanations for the observed associations (including
both positive and null associations). In addition, an evaluation
of the association between glyphosate exposure and risk of
LHC based on the Bradford Hill viewpoints[46] does not favor a
causal relationship with NHL, any NHL subtype, HL, MM, or
leukemia. These nine viewpoints are strength, consistency,
specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coher-
ence, experiment, and analogy.
To evaluate the strength of the association between glypho-
sate use and risk of each type of LHC, we considered the mag-
nitude of study-specific RRs and the corresponding meta-RRs.
In individual studies, estimates of the association between
glyphosate use and risk of NHL ranged between 1.0 and 2.1,
and estimates of the association with NHL subtypes ranged
between 0.4 and 3.35 (Table 3). For HL, the two estimates of
association were 0.99 and 1.7. For MM, RRs ranged between
1.0 and 2.4, and those for leukemia ranged between 0.9 and
1.40. Most study-specific estimates were between 1.0 and 1.5.
The estimated meta-RRs for all LHC outcomes, including those
calculated in secondary and sensitivity analyses, ranged
between 1.0 (for leukemia) and 2.5 (for hairy-cell leukemia).
The meta-RRs calculated based on at least four studies ranged
between 1.3 and 1.4. These associations are not of sufficient
magnitude to exclude modest bias or confounding as reason-
able explanations for the observed results.
Results were not consistent between case-control studies of
NHL and the one prospective cohort study of NHL, which
reported no association.[12] Even among the six studies that con-
tributed to the meta-analysis of NHL, RR point estimates varied
by more than two-fold, only one statistically significant positive
association was observed, and results from some studies were
internally inconsistent (Table 3). Another, arguably more appro-
priately adjusted RR (from a hierarchical regression model) that
was 24% lower and statistically non-significant was reported in
the same study that found a significant association.[13] The lack
of statistically significant heterogeneity among studies of NHL,
based on an underpowered statistical test, does not indicate con-
sistency of results. For NHL subtypes, RR estimates also were
variable, except for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, for which
both estimates were close to 1.0. Only one statistically significant
positive association was detected (for chronic lymphocytic leuke-
mia/small lymphocytic lymphoma),[14] and this result was con-
tradicted by a non-significant inverse association in the other
study of this outcome.[17] No significant associations with ever
use of glyphosate were detected for HL, MM, or leukemia, and
for MM the RR point estimates varied by more than two-fold.
Results for MM in the Agricultural Health Study were internally
inconsistent;[12,26] and the positive association with cumulative
glyphosate exposure probably was due largely to selection bias.
Numerous associations have been hypothesized between
glyphosate exposure and diverse health outcomes, and between
various exposures and risk of NHL, NHL subtypes, HL, MM,
or leukemia. Thus, the putative associations are not specific to
either the exposure or any of the outcomes. As noted by Brad-
ford Hill,[46] “diseases may have more than one cause” and
“one-to-one relationships are not frequent”; therefore, a lack of
specificity does not detract from a causal hypothesis.
In case-control studies, where exposure assessment was
retrospective, a temporal sequence was not definitively estab-
lished with glyphosate use preceding the time of disease
onset. Although some studies attempted to exclude use close
to the time of case diagnosis (or enrollment, for con-
trols),[14,15,30] in practice individuals may not accurately
recall the timing of use. Only the prospective Agricultural
Health Study[12,26] was designed to collect information on
glyphosate use prior to cancer ascertainment. However, the
authors did not exclude malignancies diagnosed close to
422
E. T. CHANG AND E. DELZELL
 (e.g., within one year of) study enrollment, nor did they
report the distribution of diagnoses with respect to time
since first use of glyphosate. Thus, some preclinical cancers
may have existed prior to study entry and, possibly, prior to
at least some reported glyphosate use.
As discussed in detail earlier, in the three studies of NHL
with information on frequency, intensity, and/or duration of
glyphosate use,[12,14,16] a positive biological gradient was not
consistently demonstrated and was notably lacking in the Agri-
cultural Health Study,[12] which had the most detailed exposure
information (Table 2). One case-control study[33] and one pro-
spective cohort study[12] of MM reported results suggesting a
positive biological gradient with glyphosate use, but the alterna-
tive analysis of the Agricultural Health Study data[26] did not
demonstrate such a trend. No data were available to evaluate
exposure-response trends between glyphosate and risk of NHL
subtypes or HL, and the single study with such data for leuke-
mia found no apparent trend.[12]
Inhalation exposure to glyphosate from agricultural or resi-
dential uses is likely to be slight due to glyphosate’s extremely
low vapor pressure.[82] Although dermal contact can be consid-
erable, the very low skin penetrability of glyphosate[83] should
result in minimal, if any, biologically absorbed dose. A study of
farm families with a lower limit of detection of 0.001 mg/mL (1
ppb) found that 40% of glyphosate applicators had undetect-
able urinary glyphosate, which reflects all routes of exposure
(dermal, inhalation, and oral).[84] Among those with detectable
urinary glyphosate, the distribution of concentrations was right
skewed,
with
a
peak
geometric
mean
concentration
of
0.0032 mg/mL (3.2 ppb) on the day of application and declining
thereafter. A review of seven human biomonitoring studies of
glyphosate (including[84]) yielded the conclusion that “no
health concern was revealed because the resulting exposure
estimates were by magnitudes lower” than the science-based
acceptable daily intake and the acceptable operator exposure
level proposed by EFSA.[85] Glyphosate is usually applied in
agricultural operations only a few days per year. Given the low
biological dose of glyphosate that is expected to be sustained,
along with the lack of information on the mechanism of carci-
nogenesis that may exist in humans, the biological plausibility
of LHC development due to typical glyphosate exposure has
not been established.
IARC recently determined based on their process that there
is “sufficient” evidence of carcinogenicity of glyphosate in
experimental animals and mechanistic evidence of genotoxicity
and oxidative stress.[6] By contrast, U.S. EPA,[86] JMPR,[3]
BfR,[1] EFSA,[9] and others[87,88] concluded that glyphosate
does not have genotoxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic effects in
in vivo animal and in vitro studies, and that the negative find-
ings constitute evidence against carcinogenicity. Given these
widely divergent opinions, one cannot unambiguously con-
clude whether the scientific evidence is coherent with the
hypothesis that glyphosate causes any or all LHC.
No true experimental evidence exists regarding the associa-
tion between glyphosate exposure and risk of LHC in humans.
However, positive associations between farming and risk of
LHC were detected prior to 1974, when glyphosate was first
commercially marketed.[89,90] Thus, if the apparent associations
between farming and risk of LHC are due to causal agricultural
exposures, they cannot be explained only by glyphosate expo-
sure. Likewise, the recent worldwide increase (followed by a
plateau or decline) in NHL incidence began before the
1970s[91,92]—although any impact of glyphosate on NHL inci-
dence trends might be obscured by stronger risk factors. No
marked increase in the incidence of HL, MM, or leukemia has
been observed in parallel with the introduction and expansion
of glyphosate use.[93–96]
Finally, numerous analogies exist to support or oppose the
hypothesis of a causal link between glyphosate exposure and
risk of LHC. On balance, such analogies do not strengthen or
weaken a conclusion of causality.
In summary, although none of the Bradford Hill viewpoints
can establish or disprove causality, we did not find compelling
evidence in support of causality based on any of the nine view-
points. Thus, on balance, the existing epidemiologic evidence
does not favor a causal effect of glyphosate on NHL, HL, MM,
leukemia, or any subtype of these malignancies.
Discussion
Our meta-analysis yielded borderline significant RRs of 1.3 and
1.4 between glyphosate use and risk of NHL and MM, respec-
tively, and no significant association with risk of HL or leuke-
mia. Based on more fully adjusted RRs, our NHL meta-RR of
1.3 (95% CI D 1.0–1.6) was weaker than that reported by Schi-
nasi and Leon[11] (RR D 1.5, 95% CI D 1.1–2.0). The largest
meta-RR of 2.5 (for hairy-cell leukemia) and the only meta-RR
with a lower 95% confidence limit that excluded 1.0 (for B-cell
lymphoma) were based on only two studies each, and the maxi-
mum number of studies contributing to any meta-analysis was
six. The few studies with available data did not consistently
detect positive exposure-response trends between quantitative
measures of glyphosate use and risk of any LHC.
Consideration of the available epidemiologic evidence in light
of the Bradford Hill viewpoints does not substantiate a causal
relationship between glyphosate exposure and risk of any type of
LHC. A conclusion in favor of causality also is undermined by
the studies’ methodological limitations, which could reasonably
account for at least part of the observed associations. These limi-
tations include exposure misclassification (which may differ by
outcome status especially in case-control studies, which consti-
tute nearly all available studies), selection bias (due to differential
enrollment, follow-up, or data completeness), poor adjustment
for confounding (by other agricultural exposures, for instance),
small numbers (which lead to low statistical power as well as a
higher probability that a statistically significant finding is
false[97]), and potential reporting and publication bias. Although
underpowered statistical tests did not formally detect publication
bias, we identified several examples of studies with available data
that did not report associations between glyphosate use and LHC
risk, and these unreported associations were most likely null.
Underpowered statistical tests also generally did not detect
heterogeneity of results among studies, except for chronic lym-
phocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and MM.
Nevertheless, our sensitivity analysis revealed some evidence of
stronger associations with NHL risk in studies based in Sweden
and those that ascertained cases in the 1980s, whereas the
meta-RRs for studies that ascertained cases in the 2000s were

 close to the null and statistically non-significant The stronger
association with NHL diagnosed in the 1980s raises questions
about whether glyphosate, an agent first introduced in 1974 in
the United States and Europe, could plausibly cause lymphoma
less than a decade later. However, deliberation on the potential
induction time requires an understanding of the presumed
mechanism of carcinogenesis, which is unknown for glypho-
sate. The classification system for lymphoid tumors underwent
major changes in 1994 and 2001,[20] such that the definition of
NHL as a disease entity is not entirely comparable between
recent studies and those conducted in the 1980s. Study quality
also may have improved over time, for example, due to refine-
ments in survey design, interviewing techniques, data manage-
ment, and other methods to augment data integrity.
The stronger association in Swedish studies probably is not
explained by geographical differences in glyphosate use or
effect modifiers related to NHL risk. One possible explanation
is that of the six NHL studies, only the two Swedish stud-
ies[14,15] compared subjects who used glyphosate with those
who did not use any pesticides as the reference group, whereas
the other studies defined the reference group as those who did
not use glyphosate in particular. Comparisons with subjects
who do not use any pesticides are more likely to be confounded
by other pesticides and agricultural exposures.
Meta-analysis can be problematic when applied to observa-
tional epidemiology.[21,22] Meta-analysis increases statistical
precision by combining results from studies that may differ
substantially in terms of source population, exposure and out-
come assessment and classification, control for confounding,
and other key characteristics. In the presence of such heteroge-
neity, even if not detectable using formal statistical tests, a sin-
gle summary estimate may not be scientifically meaningful.
Additionally, even when studies are statistically homogeneous,
meta-analysis may not yield valid results, since this technique
cannot overcome problems in the design and conduct of the
underlying studies. Instead, given that bias can seldom be ruled
out and unmeasured and uncontrolled confounding can never
be eliminated from observational epidemiologic studies, modest
meta-RRs detected across multiple studies may simply be due
to shared biases, rather than a true association.[21] As stated
earlier, the purpose of meta-analysis is not to evaluate whether
associations are causal. We conducted a meta-analysis primar-
ily for comparison with published findings.
Considering the shortcomings of the existing literature,
what can be done to shed further light on whether glypho-
sate causes LHC in humans? Perhaps the foremost need is
better exposure assessment. Self-reported information on
use of specific pesticides, unless validated by comparison
with sales records (which most likely would need to be col-
lected prospectively, and might not be closely correlated
with pesticide use) or other objective documentation, is not
sufficiently accurate and reliable to yield credible estimates
of association, especially exposure-response trends. Urinary
glyphosate levels would provide more accurate and quanti-
tatively detailed information on biological dose of glypho-
sate received, but would probably have to be measured
repeatedly to reflect long-term exposure.
Information about temporal aspects of glyphosate expo-
sure, such as the putative induction time since first use of
glyphosate, duration of use, and time since last use, could
help to shed light on the exposure-outcome relationship.
Results from additional prospective cohort studies are nec-
essary to alleviate concerns about selection and reporting
bias in case-control studies.
More specific outcome classification also is needed. Only two
studies[14,17] examined associations between glyphosate use and
more than one histological subtype of NHL, despite growing evi-
dence of important etiologic heterogeneity among NHL sub-
types.[74] Information on NHL subtypes also is available in the
Agricultural Health Study,[66] and publication of risk associa-
tions with glyphosate is anticipated. Risk factors for HL and leu-
kemia also are known to differ by subtype,[76,77] yet no studies
estimated associations with glyphosate separately for subtypes of
these tumors. (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hairy-cell leu-
kemia, which were analyzed as distinct outcomes, are classified
as NHL subtypes.[20]) Large, probably pooled studies with histo-
pathological data can determine whether associations with spe-
cific tumor subtypes might be obscured by analyzing overall
NHL, HL, MM, or leukemia as a single disease entity.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found marginally significant positive meta-
RRs for the association between glyphosate use and risk of
NHL and MM, and statistically null associations with HL and
leukemia. A statistically significant positive meta-RR for B-cell
lymphoma, but not other NHL subtypes, was calculated based
on only two studies. Combining these results with recognition
of the methodological weaknesses of the small number of exist-
ing studies and an overall body of literature that is not strong,
consistent, temporally unambiguous, or indicative of a positive
biological gradient, we determined that no causal relationship
has been established between glyphosate exposure and risk of
NHL, HL, MM, leukemia, or any subtype of LHC.

Appendix
Literature search methods
The authors conducted a search of MEDLINE via PubMed
using the following search string, which includes Chemical
Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Numbers for glyphosate and
its salts:
(glyphosat�
OR
glifosat�
OR
glyfosat�
OR
gliphosat�
OR Roundup OR Round-up OR 1071-83-6 OR 38641-94-0 OR
70901-12-1 OR 39600-42-5 OR 69200-57-3 OR 34494-04-7 OR
114370-14-8 OR 40465-66-5 OR 69254-40-6 OR (aminomethyl
w phosphonic�) OR 1066-51-9 OR pesticid� OR herbicid� OR
organophosphorus compounds [MeSH] OR pesticides [MeSH]
OR herbicides [MeSH]) AND (leukemi� OR leukaemi� OR
lymphoma� OR NHL OR lymphopoietic OR hemato� OR hema-
topoie� or hematolog� OR lymphoid OR myeloid OR myeloma
OR leukemia [MeSH] OR lymphoma [MeSH] OR multiple mye-
loma [MeSH]) AND (cases OR controls OR case-control OR
cohort).
As of June 23, 2015, this search string identified a total of
11,755 articles in PubMed. We conducted additional targeted
searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using
simpler keyword combinations such as (glyphosate AND lym-
phoma), (pesticides AND lymphoma), and (herbicides AND lym-
phoma). References also were identified from the bibliographies
of recent review articles.
Altogether, a total of 12,709 articles were identified from these
combined sources (Fig. A1). Based on a review of titles and abstracts,
321 articles were identified as potentially containing estimates of the
association between glyphosate exposure and LHC risk, and were
obtained for further evaluation. Forty-seven of these articles con-
tained the word “glyphosate” or “Roundup” (or alternative spellings
of these terms) in the text; as specified earlier, articles that did not
mention glyphosate were ineligible for inclusion. Following a review
of the full text of each of the 47 articles mentioning glyphosate, 19
articles were ultimately deemed eligible for inclusion.
