Background. The pathogenesis of severe dengue disease involves immune components as biomarkers. The mechanism by which 
some dengue virus (DENV)–infected individuals progress to severe disease is poorly understood. Most studies on the pathogenesis 
of severe dengue disease focus on the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) as a primary risk factor. With the circu-
lation of Zika virus (ZIKV) in DENV-endemic areas, many people infected by ZIKV were likely exposed to DENV. The influence of 
such exposure on Zika disease outcomes remains unknown.
Methods. We investigated whether patients previously exposed to DENV exhibited higher viremia when exposed to a subse-
quent, heterologous dengue or Zika infection than those patients not previously exposed to dengue. We measured viral loads and 
cytokine profile during patients’ acute infections.
Results. Neither dengue nor Zika viremia was higher in patients with prior DENV infection, although the power to detect such 
a difference was only adequate in the ZIKV analysis. Of the 10 cytokines measured, only 1 significant difference was detected: Levels 
of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) were lower in dengue-infected patients who had experienced a previous dengue infection than patients 
infected with dengue for the first time. However, power to detect differences between groups was low. In Zika-infected patients, levels 
of IL-1β showed a significant, positive correlation with viral load.
Conclusions. No signs of ADE were observed in vivo in patients with acute ZIKV infection who had prior exposure to DENV.

The development of severe dengue disease is associated with 
serial infection with dengue viruses (DENVs) of different sero-
types; secondary dengue infection is a significant risk factor in 
>97% of severe cases [1, 2]. The pathogenesis of severe dengue 
is thought to be largely due to immune mechanisms in which 
antibody enhancement and T-cell immunopathology are likely 
to play key roles [3]. Once stimulated, components of the host 
immune response, which includes cells, cytokines, comple-
ments, and other cellular mediators, may serve as biomarkers 
of severe disease [4–7]. The mechanism by which only a few 
DENV-infected individuals progress to severe dengue disease 
is poorly understood. The processes of plasma leakage, shock, 
and hemorrhagic manifestations are initiated through the 
enhancement of infection by DENV with the help of opsonizing 
antibodies and result in an altered immune response that trig-
gers memory T-cell activation and the release of cytokines and 
chemical mediators. These processes have been found to be a 
risk factor in secondary infection [6, 7].
The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) in dengue-endemic 
areas has raised questions about the immunopathogenesis of 
ZIKV infection in patients who have been previously infected 
by DENV [2]. Dejnirattisai et al report that immunity to 
DENV may drive greater ZIKV replication and may have direct 
implications for disease pathogenesis and future vaccination 
programs for ZIKV and DENV [2]. On the other hand, other 
researchers have reported that antibodies presented in sera 
from dengue patients were found to be highly cross-reactive 
to ZIKV in that they produced binding and neutralization [8]. 
Subsequent results showed that a subset of antibodies target-
ing a conformational epitope from dengue patients is capable 
of strongly neutralizing ZIKV [9]. It is important to note that 
the homology between flaviviruses and cross-protection has 
also been observed in some contexts. For example, memory 
T-cell responses from patients previously infected with DENV 
produced potent protection through cellular immune response 
against Japanese encephalitis virus infection [10].

 DENV and ZIKV: Infected Patient Profiles • CID 2017:65 (15 October) • 1261
In this context, our aim was to investigate whether patients 
in a highly endemic area who had been previously exposed to 
dengue could exhibit higher viremia when exposed to a subse-
quent infection by a heterologous flavivirus. To do so, we com-
pared the viral loads in these patients to determine whether the 
prior infection influenced virus replication. We also analyzed 
cytokine profiles during the subsequent acute infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Samples
We selected 65 clinical samples collected from January to July 2016 
from patients who exhibited acute febrile disease for ≤5 days and 
were attended at the at the emergency facility of the reference hos-
pital in the city of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil, during 
a ZIKV outbreak. The blood samples were collected, and the viral 
RNA was extracted for the diagnosis of DENV serotypes 1–4 [11], 
ZIKV [12], Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [13], or a lack of infection. 
After the molecular results, the 65 analyzed patients were randomly 
selected to continue the study. This study is part of an ongoing arbo-
virus surveillance program approved by the local research ethics 
committee (number 02078812.8.0000.5415), and all samples were 
taken from storage at –80°C when the study was performed.
Polymerase Chain Reaction Assays for Dengue Virus 1–4, Zika Virus, and 
Chikungunya Virus
To determine the presence of DENV, Flavivirus genus-specific 
primers targeting NS5 regions were first used in a reverse-tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Next, 
DENV1–4 species-specific primers were used, because these 
viruses are known to circulate in the region. A multiplex-nested 
PCR assay was used to identify DENV1–4 in the samples [11]. 
To detect ZIKV and CHIKV, a 1-step quantitative, real-time, 
fluorescent probe–based RT-PCR assay was performed using 
primers targeting the envelope region in the case of ZIKV and 
the NsP1 region in the case of CHIKV, as described previously 
[12, 13]. The viral RNA samples used in the PCR assays were 
extracted from 140 µL using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit 
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Analysis of Viral Load by Quantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase 
Chain Reaction (Dengue Virus 2 and Zika Virus)
To determine the ZIKV viral load, we used the previously described 
primers known as ZIKV 1086 (5ʹ CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG 
3ʹ) and ZIKV 1162c (5ʹ CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT 
3ʹ) [12]. A 1-step reaction was performed using the SuperScript 
III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step quantitative reverse-tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction kit (Life Technologies). 
For each sample, reactions were prepared with a final volume 
of 15 μL containing 10 μL 2X SYBR Green Reaction Mix, 0.4 μL 
SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq Mix, 0.3 μL of each primer at 
10 µM, ROX Dye to a final concentration of 50 nM, 5 µL of RNA, 
and water to complete the volume. Thermal cycling consisted of 
an initial step of 42°C for 3 minutes and 95°C for 5 minutes, fol-
lowed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute, 
and a final step of 40°C for 1 minute. Finally, a melting curve 
was applied to the amplicons. The standard curve was performed 
using ZIKV containing 109–105 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL.
To determine the DENV 2 viral load, a SYBR Green 2-step 
protocol was applied as previously described [14] and using Den 
F (5ʹ-TTAGAGGAGACCCCTCCC-3ʹ) and Den R2 (5ʹ-GA-
GACAGCAGGATCTCTGG-3ʹ). The standard curve was per-
formed with DENV 2 PE 3808 containing 106–101 PFU/mL.
All of the reactions were performed in the QuantStudio 3 
Real-Time PCR System using a MicroAmp Fast Optical 96-well 
reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). The runs were analyzed in 
the QuantStudio Design and Analysis Software, version 1.4. The 
viral loads are presented as genomic equivalent per milliliter.
Dengue Virus Immunoglobulin G Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
The patients’ sera were tested for the presence of DENV immu-
noglobulin G (IgG) using the human anti–DENV IgG enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Abcam, Cambridge, 
United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The assay did not discriminate between the DENV serotypes. 
The plate was read at 450 nm using a Spectramax Plus ELISA 
reader (Molecular Devices).
Analysis of Serum Cytokine Levels
Serum cytokine levels were determined through the use of 
a multiplex bead analysis in a Human Cytokine/Chemokine 
Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore, Watford, United Kingdom). 
Levels of the following 10 molecules were measured according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions: interferon gamma (IFN-γ), 
interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, and 
IL-17. Finally, the beads were washed and analyzed in a Luminex 
IS-100 system (Luminex Corp, Texas). Standard curves of 
known concentrations of recombinant human cytokines were 
used to convert fluorescence units into cytokine concentra-
tion units (pg/mL). The data were stored and analyzed using 
GraphPad Prism software version 5.0.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using JMP software ver-
sion 10. Age was normally distributed and analyzed using para-
metric statistics, whereas number of days between symptoms and 
medical assessment, cytokine level, and viral load data were not 
normal and no transformation attempted rendered them normal, 
so these data were analyzed using nonparametric statistics.
RESULTS
Molecular Results and Dengue Virus Immunoglobulin G Seroprevalence
Among the 65 patients with acute febrile illness who were stud-
ied herein, 20 were found to be positive for DENV 2 and 45 
were found to be positive for ZIKV according to viral genome

detection. An ELISA for specific IgG was performed to deter-
mine whether the patients had had a previous exposure to 
DENV. Among the 20 DENV 2-infected patients, 14 (70%) 
were IgG positive (DENV 2/IgG+); Among the 45 ZIKV-
positive patients, 35 (78%) were IgG+ (ZIKV/IgG+). There was 
no significant difference in the proportion of patients previ-
ously exposed to DENV among the DENV-infected and ZIKV-
infected groups (n = 66; P = .54, Fisher exact test).
Patient Age and Lag to Medical Assessment
Among the DENV-infected patients, individuals with evidence 
of a prior DENV infection were significantly older than those 
who lacked anti-DENV IgG (mean ± standard error [SE] age, 
41.6 ± 3.4 years and 16.0 ± 5.7 years, respectively; t test: degree of 
freedom (df) = 17, t = 3.87, P = .001) (Supplementary Table 1). 
 
In contrast, among the ZIKV-infected patients, those who were 
DENV/IgG+ were slightly but not significantly older than those 
who were DENV/IgG– (mean ± SE age, 42.4 ± 2.8 years and 
32.3 ± 5.3 years, respectively; t test: df = 43 t = 1.69, P = .10). 
Overall, the mean ± SE age of patients infected with DENV and 
ZIKV did not differ (34.9 ± 3.9 vs 40.2 ± 2.5 years, respectively; 
df = 62, t = 1.13, P = .26). The lag between symptom onset 
and medical assessment did not differ significantly between 
DENV/IgG+ and DENV/IgG– patients for either the DENV-
infected group or the ZIKV-infected group (Mann-Whitney 
U test, P > .5 for both comparisons); across all data, this lag 
ranged from 0 to 7 days.
Viral Load
We analyzed patients’ viral loads to assess whether a prior den-
gue infection could influence viral replication during a second 
infection by another flavivirus. Viral load did not correlate 
with patient age for either DENV- or ZIKV-infected patients 
(Spearman rank correlation, P > .77 for both comparisons), nor 
was a significant correlation detected when DENV IgG+ and 
IgG– patients were analyzed separately within each virus-in-
fected group (P > .2 for all comparisons). Neither was there 
a significant correlation between viral load and lag between 
symptom onset and medical treatment in DENV- or ZIKV-
infected patients (Spearman rank correlation, P > .15 for both 
comparisons), although in the DENV-infected patients there 
was a trend of decreasing viral load as lag increased.
There was no significant difference in viral load between the 
DENV IgG+ and IgG– patients infected by DENV 2 (n = 19; 
P = .57, Mann-Whitney U test). Given the sample size and stand-
ard deviation of the data, the smallest difference detectable in 
this analysis (ie, the least significant value) is 2.08 log10 PFU/mL. 
Put another way, this analysis had high power to detect differ-
ences of ≥100-fold in viral load between the 2 samples. In the 
existing data, the DENV/IgG+ patients had only a 10-fold higher 
viremia, on average, than the DENV/IgG– patients. To have 
90% power to detect a difference of this magnitude would have 
required 154 patients, equally distributed between the IgG+ and 
IgG– categories.
When DENV 2-infected patients were considered individu-
ally, 3 DENV 2/IgG+ patients (2056, 2287, and 2425) had viral 
loads (1 × 108 to 1 × 109 genomic equivalent/mL) that were up 
to 2 logs higher than the other patients. This might represent 
the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV viral 
load, despite the fact that only 1 of these patients had severe 
manifestations of dengue (Supplementary Table 2).
There was also no significant difference in viral load between 
the DENV IgG+ and IgG– patients infected by ZIKV (n = 44; 
P = .25, Mann-Whitney U test). The least significant value for 
this analysis was 0.70 log10 PFU/mL; thus, the analysis had high 
power (90%) to detect a 10-fold difference in viral load between 
IgG+ and IgG– patients. Moreover, no IgG+ patients had dramat-
ically higher levels of ZIKV than the IgG– patients (Figure 1).
Cytokine Levels
A commercial panel consisting of IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, 
IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-17 was used to analyze the levels 
of circulating cytokines in patients exposed to a second infec-
tion. These cytokines are involved in the “cytokine storm” phe-
nomenon that is known to affect patients with severe dengue 
and which may be considered a marker of severe disease [7] 
(Supplementary Table 2).
We compared levels of 10 cytokines between IgG+ and IgG– 
patients in the DENV-infected cohort (Figure 2A). To correct for 
multiple testing, the threshold for significance (α) was adjusted 
to .005 (.05/10). Only 1 cytokine, IL-1β, was significantly dif-
ferent between the 2 groups (n = 19; P = .004, Mann-Whitney 
U test), and this cytokine was lower in IgG+ patients. However, 
these analyses had very low power, ranging from 6% to 12% 
power to detect a deviation of ≥25% from the larger of the 
mean cytokine values in the 2 groups. Generally, DENV 2/IgG+ 
patients presented higher levels of INF-γ and IL-10 and lower 
levels of the other 8 cytokines tested. Individually, the DENV 2/
IgG+ patients were found to have high levels of some cytokines 
at rates very similar to those of the DENV 2/IgG– patients (1 
patient each for IL-1β, IL-9, and IL-2). Levels of 2 cytokines, 
IL-1β and IL-6, showed a significant, negative correlation with 
age (P < .004 for both comparisons, Spearman rank correlation).
In the ZIKV-infected cohort, none of the 10 cytokines dif-
fered significantly between IgG+ and IgG– patients (Figure 2B). 
Again, the power of these analyses was low, ranging from 5% to 
20% power to detect a deviation of ≥25% from the larger of the 
mean cytokine values in the 2 groups. When patients were con-
sidered individually, a few ZIKV/IgG+ individuals were found to 
exhibit substantially higher levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-13, 
and IL-17 (1 patient), of IFN-γ, IL-10, and IL-2 (2 patients), and 
of IL-1β (4 patients) compared with the levels found in ZIKV/
IgG– individuals. None of the cytokine levels showed a signifi-
cant correlation with age.

Cytokines Versus Viral Load
Viral load did not show a significant correlation with any 
cytokine level in the DENV 2/IgG+ patients or the DENV 2/
IgG– patients. However, viral load did show a significant pos-
itive correlation with IL-1β (n = 34; P = .03, Spearman rank 
correlation) in the ZIKV/IgG+ patients and a marginally signif-
icant correlation (n = 10; P = .05) in the ZIKV/IgG– patients. 
ZIKV load did not show a significant correlation with any other 
cytokine level (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary 
Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
Infection with any DENV serotype (or with any flavivirus) is 
known to result in long-term homotypic protection, whereas in 
the case of heterotypic infection, only short-term immunity is 
produced [15]. Moreover, secondary infections by heterologous 
DENV serotypes can lead to ADE through the cross-reactivity 
among anti-DENV antibodies that enhance uptake by Fc recep-
tor–bearing cells [2]. Previous studies using animal models 
have shown that ADE produces a higher DENV viral load [16, 
17]. Thus, it is worrisome that some vaccine strategies against 
DENV or even ZIKV could produce ADE in a population that 
has been previously exposed to several flaviviruses, which is the 
case of many Brazilian residents.
ADE has been proposed in ZIKV-infected individuals who 
have had previous DENV infection [2, 8, 18]. Both viruses 
belong to the same genus and exhibit a homology of 50% in 
the amino acid sequence of the envelope protein, the major 
antigenic target [19]. However, ADE is only one component 
of a combination of immunological mechanisms that drive the 
pathogenesis of severe dengue [20]. In this study, we investi-
gated a cohort of patients who had been previously exposed to 
DENV via natural infection and who had experienced second-
ary infection by DENV 2 or ZIKV. We analyzed viral load and 
levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and 
assessed possible correlations between viral load and cytokine 
levels in this very original and valuable cohort.
The most significant finding of our study is that ADE was not 
observed in our in vivo investigation into patients who had been 
infected by DENV followed by a secondary infection by ZIKV. 
Moreover, none of the patients in this cohort exhibited a severe 
course of the disease, and all recovered after the recommended 
supportive therapy for infections caused by arboviruses.
Our analysis, which had high power to detect a 10-fold dif-
ference in virus titer, found no difference in viral load between 
ZIKV-infected patients who had been exposed previously to 
DENV and those who had not. We also detected no apparent 
enhancement of DENV replication in patients who had or had 
not been previously infected with DENV; however, this latter 
analysis had low power to detect biologically realistic differ-
ences in virus titer.
A cytokine storm is an overexuberant immunological 
response that can be activated during a secondary DENV infec-
tion. It may worsen pathology through processes such as vascu-
lar permeability, plasma leakage, and fever [20, 21]. Among the 
cytokines associated with this phenomenon, the increase of IL-6, 
IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ, IFN-α, and vascular endothelial growth fac-
tor, combined with tumor necrosis factor α, are considered poor 
prognostic markers of the occurrence of severe dengue as they 
indicate a poor outcome [20, 22]. Furthermore, some of these 
cytokines are important for overcoming the disease. Our data 
showed that DENV-infected patients with previous exposure to 
dengue presented significantly lower levels of IL-1β and higher, 
albeit not significantly so, levels of IFN-γ and IL-10, whereas the 
same differences were not observed in ZIKV-infected patients 
who had or had not experienced a previous DENV infection.

We did make the intriguing observation that levels of IL-1β in 
both ZIKV-infected groups were positively correlated with viral 
load. IL-1β is related to the processes of coagulation and fibrinol-
ysis during a viral infection [23]. Its concentration was shown to 
be elevated during the early stages of DENV infection without 
being related to the disease severity [24, 25].
Most studies on severe dengue focus on ADE. With the circu-
lation of ZIKV in DENV-endemic areas, many people infected 
by ZIKV are likely to have been previously exposed to DENV. In 
these cases, little is known about the consequences or whether 
the subsequent infection is worsened by prior flavivirus expo-
sure. We are aware that a study based on cytokine profiles and 
viral load alone is not the most appropriate strategy for inves-
tigating disease progress or severity, nor it is the best choice for 
tracking patients’ immunological response. However, the use of 
cytokines may be an important tool in the initial screening of 
patient response to infection with DENV and ZIKV. Our focus 
now is to continue to evaluate this cohort to determine whether 
primary infection by DENV does, in fact, provide protective 
benefits in secondary infections by Zika and by other dengue 
serotypes. Our strategies will be to analyze different immunolog-
ical aspects, such as subclasses of immunoglobulins and different 
subsets of immune cells, to understand the mechanisms under-
lying the results that we have observed in the present study.

.0477), and IL-9 (****P = .0391). B, Cytokine levels measured in ZIKV-positive patients with primary (IgG–) DENV infection (n = 10) and secondary (IgG+) DENV infection (n =
