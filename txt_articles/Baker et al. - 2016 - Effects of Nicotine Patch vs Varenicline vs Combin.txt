Abstract
Importance—Smoking cessation medications are routinely used in healthcare; it is vital to 
identify medications that most effectively treat this leading cause of preventable mortality.
Objective—Compare the efficacies of varenicline, combination nicotine replacement (C-NRT), 
and the nicotine patch on 26-week quit rates.
Design, Setting, Participants—3-group randomized clinical trial occurring from 5/22/2012 – 
11/18/2015, using the intention-to-treat principle. Among 1086 smokers who were randomized 
(52% women, 67% White, mean age 48 years, mean of 17 cigarettes smoked/day), 917 (84%) 
provided 12 month follow-up data. Recruitment was in the Madison WI and Milwaukee WI 
communities and 65.5% of smokers offered the study (2687/4102) refused participation prior to 
randomization.

 Interventions—Three open-label smoking cessation pharmacotherapies for 12 weeks: 1) 
nicotine patch only (n=241); 2) varenicline only (including 1 pre-quit week; n=424); and 3) C-
NRT (nicotine patch + nicotine lozenge; n=421). 6 counseling sessions were offered.
Main Outcomes and Measurements—Primary outcome was carbon monoxide confirmed 
self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were carbon 
monoxide confirmed self-reported initial abstinence, prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks, and point 
prevalence abstinence at Weeks 1, 4, and 52.
Results—Treatments did not differ on any abstinence outcome measure at 26 or 52 Weeks, 
including point-prevalence abstinence at 26 Weeks (nicotine patch: 22.8% [55/241]; varenicline: 
23.6% [100/424]; and C-NRT: 26.8% [113/421] or 52 weeks (nicotine patch: 20.8% [50/214]; 
varenicline: 19.1% [81/424]; and C-NRT: 20.2% [85/421]). At 26 weeks the risk differences for 
abstinence were: patch versus varenicline (−0.76, 95% CI: −7.4 to 5.9), patch versus C-NRT (−4.0, 
95%CI: −10.8 to 2.8), and varenicline versus C-NRT (−3.3, 95% CI: −9.1 to 2.6). All medications 
were well tolerated, but varenicline produced greater adverse event rates than did the nicotine 
patch for vivid dreams, insomnia, nausea, constipation, sleepiness, and indigestion.
Conclusions and Relevance—Among adults motivated to quit smoking, 12 weeks of open-
label treatment with nicotine patch, varenicline, or combination nicotine replacement produced no 
significant differences in confirmed rates of smoking abstinence at 26 weeks. The results raise 
questions about both the relative effectiveness of intense smoking pharmacotherapies in today’s 
smokers and when such therapies should be used.

INTRODUCTION
Due to the profound health effects of tobacco smoking,1 it is important that we identify 
treatments that increase rates of long-term smoking abstinence. Research on 
pharmacotherapies for cessation is especially important since pharmacotherapies can be 
disseminated broadly via healthcare systems.
Two pharmacotherapies for smoking seem particularly effective: combination nicotine 
replacement therapy (C-NRT) and varenicline. A Cochrane meta-analysis2 showed that both 
varenicline and C-NRT were superior to NRT monotherapy in increasing the odds of 
quitting, but did not differ from one another. Other meta-analyses,3,4 and large individual 
clinical trials5–9 also support the superiority of varenicline and C-NRT relative to 
monotherapies. While these two pharmacotherapies are frequently used in the clinical 
treatment of smokers;10 they have never been directly contrasted in a randomized clinical 
trial (RCT).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings on varenicline, noting 
that it may increase the risk of serious neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular events; in October 
2014 the FDA retained its black box neuropsychiatric warning. While most recent evidence

 suggests that varenicline can be used safely,11 although compare,12 care still must be taken 
in patient screening and monitoring. Conversely, C-NRT, now approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration, appears to pose no meaningfully greater risk than does NRT 
monotherapy,8 which is very safe and well tolerated.13 Because varenicline and C-NRT 
differ in cost, the need for a prescription, and the intensity of screening and ongoing 
monitoring, a comparison in a head-to-head RCT seemed warranted. It also seemed 
warranted to test their effectiveness relative to nicotine patch monotherapy, which might be 
considered a usual care smoking cessation medication.3 The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the comparative efficacy of the nicotine patch, varenicline, and combination NRT.
METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited via two different sources: 1) by contacting participants in an 
ongoing longitudinal study of smokers, the Wisconsin Smokers Health Study (WSHS8,14,15), 
and 2) via media and community outreach. See Figure 1 for CONSORT diagram for both 
Cohort 1 (the WSHS) and Cohort 2 (community recruits). Contacted individuals were 
screened and potentially eligible smokers were scheduled for an orientation visit.
Inclusion criteria were: smoking ≥ 5 cigarettes/day, > 17 years old, able to read and write 
English, wanting to quit smoking but not engaged in smoking treatment, willingness to use 
the tested cessation treatments and not use e-cigarettes, phone access, and suitable protection 
regarding pregnancy. Specific exclusion criteria were: exhaled carbon monoxide (CO; 
measured via Bedfont Smokerlyzer; Bedfont Scientific, Rochester, England) value <4 parts 
per million (ppm); end-stage renal disease with hemodialysis; prior suicide attempts within 
the last 5 years or current suicidal ideation; diagnosis of and/or treatment for psychoses 
within the last 10 years; moderately severe depression via the Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-916); untreated hypertension of >200/100 mm Hg; current use of bupropion; 
hospitalized for a stroke, heart attack, congestive heart failure or diabetes within the last 
year; exclusionary incidental findings from study health assessments or interview (e.g., 
appearance of >60% carotid stenosis, 3rd degree heart block, stress induced ischemia); or 
using other forms of tobacco more than twice in the past week.
Randomization
Participants passing initial phone screening were required to: 1) undergo additional in-
person screening, assessments, and written informed consent procedures at Baseline Visit 1; 
2) attend Baseline Visit 2 to complete baseline physiological assessments (e.g., carotid 
ultrasonography and pulmonary function tests); and 3) attend a treatment initiation visit that 
included computer based randomization to treatment. Treatment assignment was unblinded. 
Computer based randomization was stratified by site (Madison or Milwaukee) and by gender 
and race (non-White/White) within each site. By design, the varenicline, C-NRT, and 
nicotine patch conditions comprised approximately 38.5%, 38.5%, and 23% of the total 
sample. This sample size strategy enhanced power for the varenicline vs. C-NRT 
comparison, which we believed would yield a smaller effect size, and yielded good power

 for all targeted comparisons. This research was approved by the University of Wisconsin 
Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.
Treatment and Assessment Contacts
Questionnaire assessments occurred at the Orientation and Baseline Visit 1 and targeted 
smoking history, dependence, and affective and psychiatric symptom domains. These 
included a smoking history questionnaire, and measures of tobacco dependence including 
the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND).17
Treatment began one week after Baseline Visit 2 and involved counseling in five treatment 
visits and one phone call. Treatment Visits 1–5 occurred at 1 week prequit, on the Target 
Quit Day (TQD), and at Weeks 1, 4, and 12 post-TQD, respectively. The treatment phone 
call occurred at Week 8 post-TQD. Counseling was 20 minutes per contact in Visits 1–3, and 
10 minutes per contact for the phone call and Visits 4 & 5. Study medication was dispensed 
at Treatment Visits 1–4. Treatment contacts included assessment of nicotine withdrawal, 
CO, adverse event/safety, and medication adherence.
Participants were contacted at Weeks 26 and 52 post-TQD for phone follow-up assessments 
of smoking status and the use of other nicotine products and cessation aids. The follow-up 
phone assessments were intended to be blinded, but a database search by interviewers could 
have revealed treatment assignment. Participants claiming abstinence were asked to attend a 
visit for CO testing.
Participants provided ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data for one week pre-quit 
through Week 4 post-TQD. Participants responded to a morning, afternoon, and evening 
prompt every day for the first 3 weeks and then every other day for the next 2 weeks. These 
assessments targeted smoking, medication use, tobacco withdrawal, and other smoking 
relevant variables.
Treatment
Pharmacotherapy—Participants were randomized to open label varenicline, C-NRT 
(nicotine patch + nicotine lozenges), or the nicotine patch. Pharmacotherapy duration was 12 
weeks. The prequit varenicline regimen was a 0.5 mg pill 1/day for 3 days, a 0.5 mg pill 
b.i.d. for 4 days, and a 1 mg pill b.i.d. for 3 days; starting on the TQD, participants took a 1 
mg pill b.i.d. for 11 weeks. Dosage reduction was counseled in response to adverse events 
such as nausea. The NRT patch regimens (patch only; C-NRT), beginning on the morning of 
the quit day were 8 weeks of 21 mg, then 2 weeks of 14 mg, and then 2 weeks of 7 mg 
patches (those smoking 5–10 cigs/day prequit received 10 weeks of 14 mg patches and then 
2 weeks of 7 mg patches). Participants in the C-NRT condition were also given either 2 mg 
or 4 mg nicotine lozenges based on morning smoking latency, and were asked to use at least 
5 lozenges per day for the full 12 weeks, unless this amount produced adverse effects. All 
participants were instructed about possible side effects and to contact the research staff in 
case of significant problems.
Counseling—Counseling was based on 2008 PHS Clinical Practice Guideline 
recommendations for an intensive counseling intervention (comprising motivational,

 supportive, and skill training elements.3 Counselors were bachelors-level health educators 
supervised by licensed psychologists.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-
TQD with biochemical confirmation via exhaled CO. Biochemical confirmation of 
abstinence required a CO ≤ 9 ppm in the original study registration, but, due to subsequent 
research that indicated that a lower CO criterion (i.e., ≤ 5) optimally distinguishes smokers 
from nonsmokers,18 we conducted analyses using CO cut-offs of both ≤ 9 and ≤ 5 (the latter 
deemed primary). Secondary abstinence outcomes included CO-confirmed 7-day point-
prevalence abstinence at post-TQD weeks 4 and 12 (end of treatment) and 52 weeks, as well 
as initial and prolonged abstinence. Initial abstinence was defined as ≥ 24 hours of 
abstinence in the first week of treatment. Prolonged abstinence was defined as no smoking 
from Day 7 to Day 181 post-TQD (TQD=Day 0).
The evening EMA report yielded two prespecified withdrawal measures: 1) the mean of four 
withdrawal items (negative mood; can’t concentrate or think clearly; thinking about food or 
hungry; wanting to smoke), and 2) a single craving item (scale: 1=not at all; 7=extremely for 
all items). These were computed as means within two periods: 7 days prequit and the first 7 
days post-TQD.
Medication adherence was measured using visit-based reports of medication use for 7 days 
prior to study visits at Weeks 1, 4, and 8. Past-week adherent use (0 = nonadherent, 
1=adherent) was defined respectively as one patch per day for 6 or 7 days, 1 or 2 pills per 
day for 6 or 7 days, and at least 2 lozenges per day for 6 or 7 days. Adherence at Week 12 
was not evaluated since that visit often occurred after the assigned medication use period 
had elapsed.
Analysis Plan
The dichotomous primary outcome was analyzed via logistic regression with model effects 
comparing the varenicline and C-NRT conditions each with the nicotine patch (reference) 
condition using reference cell (dummy) coding,19,20 and by comparing varenicline versus C-
NRT. Similar logistic regression models were used to analyze secondary abstinence 
outcomes. Risk differences (RDs) were calculated using Proc Freq (SAS Institute) via the 
RISKDIFF option and are reported for abstinence end points. Also, a Cox regression 
survival analysis was run (via SAS Proc Phreg) to analyze time to relapse up to 6-months 
post-quit. Abstinence outcome models included the full intent-to-treat sample (N=1086). 
Similar results were obtained with both CO cut-offs (≤ 5 ppm and ≤ 9 ppm).
A priori covariates for the adjusted models were: cohort, site, gender, race, income, FTND 
total score, FTND Item 1, self-reported likelihood of quitting, age, baseline CO, home 
smoking, prior cessation medication use, and menthol cigarette use. Each a priori covariate 
was tested in separate logistic regression models that included treatment coding (dummy-
coded variables: e.g., patch vs. varenicline), the covariate, and the interaction of the 
covariate with treatment (for moderation analysis). A Chi-Square analysis was used to test

 the association between nicotine dependence (FTND Item 1 score) and treatment (C-NRT 
versus patch), with abstinence at 26 weeks.
The two withdrawal outcomes were analyzed via linear regression models both with and 
without a corresponding baseline withdrawal covariate (mean score one week pre-TQD).
For abstinence outcomes, our analyses were run assuming that missing observations 
reflected smoking. Sensitivity analyses were applied to test this assumption via multiple 
imputation as per Hedeker et al.,21 combined with an assumption that missingness was 
related to smoking at ORs = 2 or 5. These analyses were conducted with the primary 
outcome (CO cut-off = 5). Obtained results were essentially the same as those where 
missing was treated as smoking; only the latter are reported.
A priori power analyses (via SAS Proc Power) focused on the primary outcome and 
comparisons of either varenicline or C-NRT with the patch condition, and assumed a ten 
percentage point difference based on treatment differences observed in meta-analyses and 
estimates of clinical significance.3 We hypothesized a 26 week abstinence rate of 24% for 
the nicotine patch control condition (n ≈ 227) and >34%, for the varenicline and C-NRT 
(n’s ≈ 387) conditions,3,6,8 yielding power (2-tailed test, α=.05) > 80%. Additionally, there 
was 80% power to show a > 9 percentage point difference between the varenicline and C-
NRT treatments, e.g., 34% versus 44% (no directional hypotheses were formulated).
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Participant demographic and smoking-related variables are listed in Table 1. Cohorts 1 
(n=169) and 2 (n=917) differed significantly on multiple dimensions: race, age, income, 
years of smoking, and prior use of cessation medication (p’s < .01) (See Supplemental Table 
1).
Smoking Outcomes
Table 2 depicts 7-day biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence rates (CO cutoff 
≤5) for the three treatment conditions. A logistic regression analysis (unadjusted) contrasted 
the Patch Only condition with the Varenicline or the C-NRT condition on the primary 
outcome (7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-TQD); neither the patch 
versus varenicline (22.8% vs. 23.6%, respectively; risk difference= −0.76, 95% CI: −7.4 to 
5.9) nor the patch versus C-NRT (22.8% vs. 26.8%, respectively; risk difference= −4.0, 
95%CI: −10.8 to 2.8) contrast was significant (model fit likelihood ratio=1.77[df=2], P=.
4928). Neither contrast was significant in covariate-adjusted models (See Supplemental 
Table 2). A similar pattern of results was obtained using a CO cut-off of ≤9 (See 
Supplemental Table 3). We also computed unadjusted and covariate-adjusted models 
contrasting the varenicline and the C-NRT groups on the primary outcome; neither model 
type yielded a significant group effect. Outcome analyses revealed that treatment effects 
were not significantly moderated by cohort.

 Additional secondary abstinence outcomes were analyzed using both unadjusted and 
adjusted logistic regression models (see Table 2). No significant treatment condition effects 
were found for biochemically-confirmed point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 4 or 52, or 
for 26 Week prolonged abstinence or survival analysis (26 week relapse interval) 
(Supplemental Table 4). For initial abstinence, the patch only group differed from the C-
NRT group (73.0% vs. 80.5%, respectively; risk difference= −7.5, 95% CI: −14.3 to −0.7) in 
the unadjusted model but not the covariate-adjusted model (see Supplemental Table 4). Also, 
the varenicline group differed from the C-NRT group on initial abstinence in the unadjusted 
(68.2% vs. 80.5%, respectively; risk difference= −12.4, 95% CI: −18.2 to −6.5) and adjusted 
models. Last, the patch only group did not differ from the varenicline group on the week 12 
point-prevalence abstinence outcome in the unadjusted model (25.7% vs. 31.8%, 
respectively; risk difference=−6.1%, 95%CI: −13.2 to 0.97), but did differ in the adjusted 
model (Supplemental Table 2).
Covariate Effects on Week 26 Abstinence
Covariate effects were tested in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with 
the primary outcome (7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-TQD, CO ≤5) as 
the dependent variable, with no treatment coding (see Table 3). While many of the covariates 
predicted the primary outcome none of the covariates differed significantly across treatment 
conditions (data not shown).
Treatment Moderation
Prior data suggested that C-NRT is especially effective relative to the nicotine patch among 
those who are highly dependent on tobacco.9 Therefore, we examined C-NRT and patch 
effects in individuals high and low in dependence in exploratory analyses. Among those who 
smoked more than 30 minutes after waking (i.e., who were less dependent via the FTND 
item 1,22 the 26 week abstinence rates for the Patch and C-NRT conditions were 36% and 
31%, respectively; among those smoking within 30 minutes of arising (i.e., more 
dependent), abstinence rates were 19.1% and 25.3%, (risk difference = −6.2 (−13.2 to 1.2), 
respectively. These differences were not significant nor was there a significant interaction 
effect between dependence and pharmacotherapy. In fact, no covariate X treatment 
interaction effects were statistically significant in predicting the primary outcome in any of 
the models (this applies to all the covariates listed in Table 3; covariate values as a function 
of treatment group are reported in Supplemental Table 5).
Withdrawal Suppression
The dependent variables were mean total withdrawal and mean craving, examined in 
separate analyses over the first week post-TQD, and tested with and without mean prequit-
week score as a covariate. For the total score, participants using C-NRT had significantly 
lower total withdrawal ratings (mean=2.27, SD=0.94) compared to participants using patch 
monotherapy (mean=2.55, SD=1.11) in both the unadjusted and covariate-adjusted models 
(p’s < .05). Participants using varenicline (mean=2.33, SD=0.99) had significantly lower 
total withdrawal score ratings compared to participants using patch monotherapy only in the 
unadjusted model (p < .05). Corresponding analyses showed that both the C-NRT and 
varenicline groups also had significantly lower craving ratings (mean [SD]: 3.12 [1.72] and

 3.08 [1.69], respectively, than the patch-only group (mean=3.66, SD=1.80) in both the 
adjusted and unadjusted models (p’s < .05), but did not differ from one another.
Medication Adherence, Visit Attendance, and Adverse Events
At Week 8, medication adherence rates were 45.2% for the patch condition, 49.3% for the 
varenicline condition, and 49.6% (Patch) and 43.0% (Lozenge) for the C-NRT condition. 
Supplemental Table 6 shows rates of medication adherence (past 7 days) by treatment group 
at Weeks 1, 4, and 8. Mean visit attendance (ranging from 1 – 6 contacts), was 4.91, 4.86, 
and 5.19 for the patch, varenicline, and C-NRT groups respectively. The treatment 
conditions differed in reports of some adverse events (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this open-label study is the first to directly contrast varenicline and C-
NRT pharmacotherapies, both with one another, and with the nicotine patch. Results showed 
no significant differences among these three pharmacotherapies on any of the 26 or 52 week 
abstinence measures.
Compared to the nicotine patch, both varenicline and C-NRT significantly reduced 
withdrawal and craving symptoms over the early post-TQD period. In addition, C-NRT 
produced higher initial abstinence rates than did the other two pharmacotherapies. However, 
neither of these early, post-TQD effects translated into superior 26 or 52 week abstinence.
The lack of long-term pharmacotherapy effects in this research does not appear to be due to 
low power, but rather small effect sizes. In the 2008 PHS Clinical Practice Guideline meta-
analysis,3 varenicline, C-NRT, and the nicotine patch yielded model-estimated abstinence 
rates of 33%, 37% and 23% at ≥ 5 months post-TQD, respectively (see Guideline Table 
6.26; See2). The pharmacotherapy differences in the current study were meaningfully 
weaker than those suggested by prior meta-analyses (and by individual studies8,23,24). At 26 
and 52 weeks, the three pharmacotherapy conditions were essentially equivalent in their 
point-prevalence and prolonged abstinence rates (see Table 2).
It is unclear why the treatment effect sizes were relatively small in this research. For 
instance, the medication adherence data suggest that medication use was comparable to that 
reported in other trials.23,25,26 One possible explanation is that secular changes affected the 
level of tobacco dependence of the sample and this, in turn, altered the relative benefits of 
the pharmacotherapies. In general, smokers are smoking fewer cigarettes/day today than 
they did in the past.27 Thus, relative to participants in other varenicline and C-NRT studies 
(from 2004–2009), the current sample not only reported smoking fewer cigarettes/day (by 
about 5–6/day on average), but also scored lower on some dependence indices: e.g., on the 
FTND (by about .5 point on a 0–10 scale on average,8,9,28,29 See Table 1). It is possible that 
stronger treatment effects might have been found had the sample comprised a greater 
proportion of heavier or more highly dependent smokers; e.g., research suggests that C-NRT 
is especially beneficial to more highly dependent smokers.9 However, while focused 
analyses suggested modestly greater benefit of C-NRT vs. the nicotine patch in more 
dependent smokers (25.3% vs 19.1% abstinence at 6 months, respectively), the interaction

 effect between dependence and C-NRT status was not significant. Moreover, it is important 
to note that participants in our sample smoked somewhat more cigarettes/day than the 
national average of daily smokers in the US in 2013 (i.e., about 17 cpd in our sample vs. 14 
cpd for daily smokers in general.30
The limitations of this research must be acknowledged. First, this was efficacy research and 
so the results may overestimate the effects of the tested medications as they would occur in 
clinical practice (e.g., due to recruitment of more highly motivated study participants). 
However, the levels of abstinence outcomes do not seem high relative to other relevant 
studies.3 Also, the availability of 6 counseling sessions and the fairly good attendance at 
such sessions may have diluted the effects of the pharmacotherapies (although some of the 
earlier studies showing the superiority of varenicline and C-NRT over monotherapies offered 
similarly intense counseling6,8). Finally, the fact that this was an open-label study means that 
the outcome measures may have been influenced by expectations or biases of the 
participants or staff.
Earlier research suggests the superior effectiveness of varenicline and C-NRT compared 
with the nicotine patch; this was not evident in the current findings. Further, varenicline and 
C-NRT did not differ from one another in their effects on 26 or 52 week abstinence. While 
the causes of such null effects are unknown, some evidence points to the relatively low level 
of dependence of the participating smokers. However, this attribution is clearly post hoc and 
speculative.
Conclusions
Among adults motivated to quit smoking, 12 weeks of open-label treatment with nicotine 
patch, varenicline, or combination nicotine replacement produced no significant differences 
in confirmed rates of smoking abstinence at 26 or 52 weeks. Our results raise questions 
about the current relative effectiveness of intense pharmacotherapies (e.g., varenicline) for 
smoking cessation in today’s smokers and when they should be used, given their greater 
costs and screening and monitoring requirements.
