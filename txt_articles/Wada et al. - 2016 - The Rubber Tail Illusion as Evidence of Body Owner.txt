Therefore, the present study used rubber tails to investigate body ownership in rodents. When the real tails and rubber tails were
synchronously stroked, the mice responded as if their own tails were touched when the rubber tails were grasped. In contrast, when
the stimuli were delivered asynchronously, there was a significantly lower mean response rate when the rubber tail was grasped. These
findings suggest that mice may experience body ownership of their tails, suggestive of the rubber hand illusion in humans.

Introduction
The ownership of one’s limbs represents a fundamental aspect
of self-consciousness. Under particular conditions, as in the
rubber hand illusion (RHI), this feeling can be extended out of
one’s own body (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998). In the human
RHI, when a rubber hand and a participant’s hand are syn-
chronously stroked by two brushes, the participant feels that
the rubber hand is his or her own. The representation of the
body in the brain is thought to be a multisensory construct;
thus, visuotactile integration is important for the RHI (Bot-
vinick and Cohen, 1998; Armel and Ramachandran, 2003;
Tsakiris and Haggard, 2005).
Nonhuman primate experiments have shown that animals
may experience body ownership as well. For example, Iriki et al.
(1996) reported that the visual receptive fields of bimodal neu-
rons (somatosensory and vision) in the posterior parietal cortices
(PPCs) of monkeys were altered during tool use such that they
included the entire length of a rake or covered an expanded ac-
cessible space. Similarly, synchronous stimulation applied to a
monkey’s unseen arm and a fake arm caused changes in the re-
ceptive fields of multimodal neurons in the premotor cortex and
superior PPC (Graziano, 1999; Graziano et al., 2000). The neural
activity within these fields suggests that the body representation
of the monkey’s limbs extended beyond their own bodies. Like-
wise, neurons in the sensorimotor cortex were activated by
virtual touches to an avatar arm following the synchronous stim-
ulation of the monkey’s arm and the avatar arm (Shokur et al.,
2013).
In contrast to nonhuman primate studies, no empirical evi-
dence regarding the experience of body ownership in rodents has
been reported to date. Therefore, the present study examines
whether an RHI-like phenomenon occurs in mice by applying
tactile stimulation to rubber tails. Tails are important for loco-
motion and balance in mice (Siegel, 1970), which suggests that
mice may experience body ownership of their tails. In humans,

Significance Statement
To explore the manner in which the ownership of body parts is experienced, this study specifically used the rubber hand illusion
(RHI), in which self-consciousness can be extended out of one’s own body. Accumulating empirical evidence supports the exis-
tence of this concept in humans and nonhuman primates, but it remains unclear whether nonprimate mammals experience
similar feelings. This study demonstrated for the first time that mice may experience body ownership of their tails, which is
suggestive of the RHI in humans and provides evidence that may highlight how humans experience the ownership of body parts.

 RHI-like phenomena occur in a variety of different body parts,
including the feet, abdomen, and whole body (Gentile et al.,
2015). Therefore, it was hypothesized that this type of illusion
could be measured in mice using rubber tails. Real tails and rub-
ber tails were either synchronously or asynchronously stroked,
and the responses of the mice (e.g., head movements) were as-
sessed when the rubber tails were grasped. In human and nonhu-
man primate studies, the motoric defense of the body is a key
behavioral indicator of body ownership (Graziano and Cooke,
2006; Ehrsson et al., 2007); thus, the evaluation of defensive with-
drawal movements in mice may be a suitable measure of body
ownership. Using this procedure, the present experiment pro-
vided the first empirical evidence showing that mice may experi-
ence body ownership of their tails.
Materials and Methods
Subjects. The present study included 21 male C57BL6NCrj mice (Charles
River Laboratories) that weighed 15–20 g at the beginning of the training
period (postnatal week 5). The mice were trained daily to stay in a small
tube with their heads stationary. Subsequently, the mice received three to
five daily training sessions per week and were provided ad libitum access
to water for �24 h over each weekend. All mice gained significant weight
over the course of the training period. The mice were housed in groups of
three to five in a room with a 12 h light/dark cycle; all behavioral exper-
iments were conducted during the light cycle. Before the present exper-
iments, the mice had no history of drug administration, surgery, or
behavioral testing. The experiments were approved by the institutional
committees for animal experimentation (Research Institute of National
Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities).
Apparatus. The mice were trained in a stainless-steel tube specifically
designed for the present study (O’Hara). One side of the tube was open,
and the other side of the tube was connected to a stainless-steel cone that
had windows on the right and left sides. For the experiments, a rubber tail
was placed either to the right or left of the cone; because mice can bend
their tails forward, the rubber tail was placed in a proper anatomical
position. The rubber tail was not placed in an anatomically impossible
position because a human study found that an improbable location of a
body part far away from the body caused a breakdown of the illusion
(Lloyd, 2007; Brozzoli et al., 2012; Kalckert and Ehrsson, 2014).
To prepare the rubber tail, an electric wire coated with red plastic
(diameter, 3 mm; length, 10 cm) was cut into a conical shape and covered
with double-coated adhesive tape. Additionally, small black hair-like
particles (Super Million Hair Mini Set; Ruan) were sprayed on the wire.
In Experiments 1–3, the rubber tail and the real tail were manually
stroked by small flat brushes made of soft sheep hair (width, 7 mm;
length, 12 mm; Namura Taiseido; Fig. 1A).
Task procedures. The basic illusion task consisted of two phases. Dur-
ing phase 1, the mice (n � 17) were trained daily to stay in the small tube
with their heads stationary for 20 min. If mice move and the rubber tails
do not move in the same way, this inconsistency may weaken the illusion
(Kalckert and Ehrsson, 2012). Phase 1 was completed by the majority of
mice within 1 month, and the four mice that could not complete the
phase were excluded from further analyses. During Phase 2, the tails of
the mice and the rubber tails were manually stroked using brushes
(�0.5–2 Hz); the real tails always remained unseen by the mice through-
out the experiment. After the rubber tails were stroked for �1 min, they
were strongly grasped by an experimenter and the responses of the mice
were recorded.
Three experiments were conducted in the present study. In Experi-
ment 1, the mice (n � 17) performed daily tests under two conditions
using a brush: the real tails and rubber tails were synchronously stroked
or the real tails and rubber tails were asynchronously stroked. After the
tails were stroked for �1 min, they were grasped by the hand of an
experimenter that approached from the front of each mouse with a
grasping strength similar to that used by the experimenters when lifting a
mouse. The order of conditions was counterbalanced and the responses
(head movements) were evaluated using a digital video camera (GZ-G5;
JVCKenwood) that was placed in front of the head. In the asynchronous
condition, asynchronous stroking was applied to the real tails and rubber
tails with small brushes, as performed previously in the control condi-
tions of human RHI experiments (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998; Armel
and Ramachandran, 2003; Ehrsson et al., 2004). In 6 of the 17 mice (mice
12–17), one experimenter who was exposed to white noise over head-
phones and who could not to see the apparatus during the tactile
stimulation firmly grasped the rubber tail after seeing a hand sign
from another experimenter who had stroked the real tail or the rubber
tail. Thus, the experimenter who grasped the rubber tail was blind to
the task conditions.
In Experiment 2, the mice (n � 5) performed daily tests under two
conditions using small brushes. The stimuli were always administered
synchronously; however, in one condition, the rubber tail was occluded
by an opaque plastic plate to evaluate the importance of visual stimuli.
In Experiment 3, two rubber tails were prepared and placed to the right
and left of the head of each mouse, and one of the rubber tails was stroked
synchronously with the real tail. The mice (n � 6) performed daily tests
under two conditions: the stroked rubber tail was grasped and the non-
stroked rubber tail was grasped. After the tails were stroked for �1 min,
an experimenter firmly grasped the rubber tail and the response was
recorded.
To minimize the number of animals used in the present study, in some
cases the same mice were included in different experiments. Please note
that each number in the figures (1–17) indicates an individual mouse.
Data analysis. During the behavioral tasks, the head movements of the
mice were recorded using a digital video camera. Head movements in
response to the grasping of the rubber tail were evaluated by two techni-
cal staff members who were blind to the experimental conditions and the
results of these staff members were averaged. If the head promptly faced
toward the rubber tail or retracted into the tube, this was considered to be
a full response and was scored as 1.0. If the response was small or slightly
delayed (�1 s), this was considered to be an insufficient response and was
scored as 0.5. The findings of the two technical staff members were well
correlated (r � 0.82, p � 0.01). Next, the mean response rates under each
condition were calculated from the responses obtained over 10 d of test-
ing and compared using paired t-tests after an assessment for normality
with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
Results
The present study developed an animal model of the RHI to
investigate the concept of body ownership in mice. In Experi-
ment 1, the mice (n � 17) performed daily tests under two stim-
ulation conditions using a brush: synchronous stroking of real
tails and rubber tails and asynchronous stroking of the tails (Fig.
1A–C). After the tails were stroked for �1 min, an experimenter
firmly grasped the rubber tail, and the mean response rate over
10 d of testing under each condition was recorded. Following
synchronous stroking, the mice responded as if their own tails
were being touched by turning or retracting their heads when the
rubber tails were grasped. Nine of the 17 mice exhibited a signif-
icantly higher response rate (mean � SEM) under the synchro-
nous stimulation condition (0.54 � 0.0017) than under the
asynchronous stimulation condition (0.43 � 0.0022; paired t test,
p � 0.00000036 � 0.000001; t(16) � 8.27; Cohen’s d � 2.01;
Figure 1C), which is similar to RHI findings in humans (Armel
and Ramachandran, 2003). In 6 of 17 mice, the behavioral tests
were assessed by experimenters who were blind to the stimulation
conditions (mice 12–17); that is, the experimenters who firmly
grasped the rubber tail could not see the apparatus and did not
know whether the real tail or the rubber tail had been synchro-
nously stroked. The difference in the response rates between the
stimulation conditions was significantly higher for the synchro-
nous stimulation condition (0.61 � 0.044) compared with the
asynchronous stimulation condition (0.51 � 0.052; paired t test,
p � 0.0062 � 0.01; t(5) � 4.53; Cohen’s d � 1.85).

 Effect of visual occlusion
Experiment 2 assessed the effects of visual occlusion on this RHI-
like phenomenon to confirm that the mice saw the rubber tail
during the task. As in Experiment 1, the mice (n � 5) performed
daily tests under two stimulation conditions using a brush: syn-
chronous stroking of real tails and rubber tails and synchronous
stroking of real tails and rubber tails with the rubber tail masked
by an opaque plastic plate so that it could not be seen (Fig. 2A).

 Similar to Experiment 1, if the rubber tail could be seen, then the
mice responded as if their own tails were being touched when the
rubber tail was grasped (0.52 � 0.035). However, when the rub-
ber tail was occluded, the response rate was significantly lower
(0.28 � 0.033; paired t test, p � 0.0046 � 0.01; t(4) � 5.71;
Cohen’s d � 2.55). Individual analyses revealed that the response
rates of all five mice were significantly lower, suggesting that
visuotactile integration was important for the manifestation of
the RHI-like phenomenon.
Effect of cross-modal spatial congruence
Experiment 3 evaluated the influence of spatial location on the
RHI-like phenomenon using two rubber tails placed to the right
and left sides of the mice (Fig. 2B). The aim of this experiment
was to determine whether or not the rubber tail phenomenon was
spatially confined. If cross-modal spatial congruency is impor-
tant (Pavani et al., 2000), then the response should be confined to
the side where the synchronous stimuli are applied. The real tails
of the mice (n � 6) and one of the rubber tails were synchro-
nously stroked, and then the mice performed daily tests under
two conditions: one in which the stroked rubber tail was grasped,
and one in which the nonstroked rubber tail was grasped. When
the stroked rubber tail was grasped, the mice responded as if their
own tails were being touched (0.48 � 0.047), similar to the syn-
chronous condition in Experiment 1. In contrast, when the non-
stroked rubber tail was grasped, there were significantly fewer
responses (0.33 � 0.052; paired t test, p � 0.000021 � 0.0001;
t(5) � 15.4; Cohen’s d � 6.30). In the individual analyses, this
difference remained significant for five of six mice, which sug-
gests that the RHI-like phenomenon was related to cross-modal
spatial congruence, as during the RHI in humans.
Discussion
The present findings from Experiment 1 demonstrate that mice
responded as if their own tails were being touched when the
rubber tails were grasped after synchronous stroking with two
small brushes. The differences between the synchronous and
asynchronous conditions suggest that the temporal simultaneity
of vision and touch was important for this task. Experiment 2
confirmed the importance of vision during the performance of
the illusion, and Experiment 3 demonstrated that the spatial lo-
cation of the rubber tails influenced the RHI-like phenomenon

 and that spatial attention may be an important consideration
during this process. Together, the present behavioral data indi-
cate that mice may experience body ownership of their tails and
that the RHI-like phenomena were related to visuotactile integra-
tion and spatial congruence.
The present findings are consistent with those of studies in-
vestigating the RHI in humans. In the original RHI experiments,
watching a rubber hand being stroked while one’s own unseen
hand is synchronously stroked elicits a feeling that the rubber
hand is one’s own. In contrast, the asynchronous stimulation of
two hands eliminates this illusion (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998).
Accordingly, the importance of visuotactile integration and spa-
tial congruence for the perceptual phenomenon of the RHI has
been repeatedly reported and discussed (Pavani et al., 2000;
Makin et al., 2008; Tsakiris, 2010; Kilteni et al., 2015; Samad et al.,
2015).
Functional brain imaging studies in humans have revealed
that the ventral premotor cortex and the PPC are activated during
the RHI (Ehrsson et al., 2004; Ehrsson et al., 2005). These brain
regions are known to be involved in body-related multisensory
integration and may coordinate information from various sen-
sory modalities with respect to the RHI (Tsakiris, 2010). Based on
the findings of electrophysiological studies, rodents also have a
distinct brain region for multisensory processing near the pri-
mary sensory cortex (Wallace et al., 2004; Menzel and Barth,
2005). Additionally, Hirokawa et al. (2008) and Wada et al.
(2010) reported that the expressions of c-Fos, which is an
activity-dependent gene, in these multisensory areas increases
after the detection of temporally congruent audiovisual stimuli
and temporal order judgments, respectively, in rodents. This
multisensory cortex in rodents, which may correspond to the
PPC in humans, also represents spatial information (Kesner,
2009). Together, these studies suggest that multisensory brain
regions play a role in RHI-like phenomena in mice.
Although empirical studies using rodents have successfully
identified the neuronal bases of multisensory processing (Bene-
detti, 1995; Iurilli et al., 2012; Reig and Silberberg, 2014; Chabrol
et al., 2015), the cognitive aspects of body representation in ro-
dents have yet to be fully examined. The present findings suggest
that mice may experience body ownership of their tails; therefore,
the task used in this study may be applicable for the evaluation
of the cognitive aspects of body representations in mice. Future
research using this behavioral task may provide novel insights
into the ownership of one’s body parts.
