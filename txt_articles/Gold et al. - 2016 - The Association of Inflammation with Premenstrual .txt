The Association of Inflammation
with Premenstrual Symptoms
Ellen B. Gold, PhD, Craig Wells, BA, and Marianne O’Neill Rasor, MA
Abstract
Background: About 80% of women experience premenstrual symptoms (PMSx), and about 50% of women
seek medical care for them, posing a large medical care burden. However, despite women’s use of anti-
inflammatory agents for relief from these symptoms, and the fact that anti-inflammatory agents provide relief
from some PMSx, the relationship of inflammation to PMSx has not been well investigated.
Methods: We, therefore, undertook the present cross-sectional analyses using baseline data from the longitu-
dinal Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a racially/ethnically diverse cohort of midlife
women (n = 2939), to determine if a biomarker of inflammation, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP),
was associated with PMSx. We performed factor analyses with Varimax rotations to determine five groupings
of eight symptoms to develop a parsimonious set of outcome variables. We conducted backward stepwise
multiple logistic regression models for each grouping, eliminating non-significant ( p > 0.05) covariates.
Results: Having an hs-CRP level >3 mg/L was significantly positively associated with premenstrual mood
symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.02–1.58), abdominal cramps/
back pain (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.09–1.80), appetite cravings/weight gain/bloating (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.04–
1.89), and breast pain (aOR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.02–1.55). Elevated hs-CRP level was not associated with pre-
menstrual headaches or reporting three or more PMSx.
Conclusions: The significant relationships of specific groups of PMSx with elevated hs-CRP levels have
potential clinical implications for treatment and possibly for prevention by advising women about the factors
associated with inflammation and the potential for treatment with anti-inflammatory agents.
Introduction
P
remenstrual
symptoms
(PMSx)
include
mood,
physical, and cognitive symptoms that begin in the luteal
phase of the menstrual cycle and end with, or shortly after, the
onset of menstruation.1 The frequency, type, severity, and
combination of symptoms that comprise PMSx vary.2 The
most frequently reported symptoms are irritability, depres-
sion, fatigue, water retention, weight gain, breast tenderness,
headaches, abdominal cramps, and mood swings.3 About
80% of women may experience PMSx,4 and about 50% of
women seek medical care for them,5–7 thus posing a large
medical care burden.
The etiology of PMSx may be related to ovarian function,
as suppression of ovarian hormone secretion markedly at-
tenuates PMSx,8 although differences in ovarian steroid
hormones have not been consistently observed between
symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Biologic, social,
demographic, and behavioral factors have been inconsis-
tently associated with PMSx.2,9–12
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is an acute
phase inflammatory marker that has been associated with
cardiovascular disease risk13 and is an outcome associated
with menopausal vasomotor symptoms.14 It has also been
associated with some of the risk factors for PMSx, such as
smoking, depressive symptoms, increasing age, and in-
creased body mass index (BMI).14 While some studies have
investigated the associations of inflammation with PMSx,
most of these have had relatively small samples of young (e.g.,
ages 18–30 years) white women,15,16 and have found sug-
gestive, but not always significant differences in inflammation
between women reporting and women not reporting emotional
or physical PMSx.
Furthermore, anti-inflammatory agents have been found to
provide relief from some PMSx.17 It is thus possible that
inflammation is the mechanism by which these factors in-
crease the risk of PMSx. Therefore, establishing the role of
inflammation in different types of PMSx in a large diverse
sample of women would be informative in understanding the
potential physiologic mechanisms involved in PMSx. We

 undertook these cross-sectional analyses of PMSx among a
racially/ethnically diverse cohort of midlife women to de-
termine if inflammation, as measured by hs-CRP, was asso-
ciated with PMSx.
Methods
Study participants
This cross-sectional study used data on PMSx, health, re-
productive, demographic, and lifestyle factors from the
baseline questionnaires of the Study of Women’s Health
Across the Nation (SWAN), a longitudinal, multicenter,
multiracial/-ethnic study of midlife women. SWAN is fol-
lowing a cohort of women (N = 3302 at baseline) from five
racial/ethnic groups, at seven clinical sites located nation-
wide.18 We recruited community-based cohorts of Cauca-
sians and one non-Caucasian group at each site: African
Americans in Pittsburgh, Boston, Detroit, and Chicago;
Hispanics (Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban, Central and
South American) in Newark, New Jersey; Japanese in Los
Angeles; and Chinese in the Oakland, California area.
Participants were eligible for inclusion in the cohort if they
were aged 42–52 years and pre- or early perimenopausal, had
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy,
were not pregnant, and were not using menopausal hormone
therapy or oral contraceptives at baseline. In addition, par-
ticipants were required to be able to speak English, Spanish,
Cantonese, or Japanese, and to provide informed consent to
participate and comply with the study protocol. All instru-
ments and the study protocol were approved by the institu-
tional review boards at all sites, and signed, written informed
consent was obtained from all study participants.
From the total baseline sample of 3302 women, 57 were
excluded for missing C-reactive protein (CRP) data; 129
additional women were excluded for missing data on PMSx;
and an additional 2 women were excluded for missing in-
formation on whether the symptoms disappeared within
3 days of onset of their menstrual period.
Data collection
All SWAN participants completed a self-administered and
interviewer-administered questionnaire at baseline.
Outcomes.
These analyses included data from the base-
line visit (administered during 1996–1997) at which partici-
pants indicated yes or no in response to the following
question for each of eight symptoms: ‘‘During the last year,
have you had any of the following during at least half of your
menstrual periods or in the week before them?’’ The eight
symptoms included the following: abdominal cramps/pain,
breast pain/tenderness, weight gain/bloating, mood changes/
suddenly sad, increase in appetite or cravings, anxious/jittery/
nervous, back/joint/muscle pain, and severe headaches.
If a participant answered yes to any one of the symptoms,
she was also asked the following question: ‘‘Did this/these
characteristic(s) usually (more than half of the time) disap-
pear within 1–3 days after your period started?’’ Answering
‘‘yes’’ to this question was used as the criterion for a symp-
tom to be considered premenstrual in the present multivariate
analyses. Those who answered ‘‘no’’ or ‘‘don’t know’’ were
excluded from multivariate analyses (an additional 175 who
reported symptoms answered no or don’t know to whether the
symptoms disappeared within 3 days of onset of their men-
strual periods; so, the total number excluded = 363 when
using this more conservative definition of PMSx, but only
188 were excluded if the more expanded criteria were used of
reporting the symptom, but saying no or don’t know in re-
sponse to whether the symptom disappeared within 3 days of
onset of their menstrual periods).
Independent variable.
hs-CRP assays were performed at
baseline using an ultrasensitive rate immunonephelometry
(hs-CRP on BN100; Dade-Behring, Marburg, Germany). The
method is based on monitoring light scattering during ag-
glutination of CRP to polystyrene particles coated with
monoclonal antibodies to CRP. The sensitivity of the assay
(lowest detectable concentration) was 0.03 mg/dL. The in-
terassay coefficients of variation at CRP concentrations of
0.05 and 2.2 mg/dL were 10%–12% and 5%–7%, respec-
tively. Although hsCRP level is a continuous variable, a
cutoff for elevated hsCRP has been established for clinical use19
and was used to categorize hsCRP into elevated (>3 mg/L) and
nonelevated (£3 mg/L) for analyses.
Covariates.
Age at baseline was analyzed as a continuous
variable. Annual household income was self-reported and
evaluated using a three-level categorical variable based on
tertiles of total income reported <$35,000, $35,000–$75,000,
and >$75,000. A binary categorical variable was used for the
proportion of women with a college education. Race/ethnicity
was self-identified as Caucasian, African American, Hispanic,
Chinese, or Japanese and included both US-born and foreign-
born women.
Menopausal status at baseline was defined using a di-
chotomous variable: (1) premenopausal (menstrual period in
the prior 3 months with no change in regularity of periods) or
(2) early perimenopausal (menstrual period in the prior 3
months with change in regularity of periods) without use of
hormone therapy. Parity was self-reported and analyzed as a
categorical variable.
Weight and height were measured using a calibrated bal-
ance beam scale and stadiometer, respectively. BMI (weight in
kilograms/[height in meters]2) was computed and analyzed as
a four-level categorical variable: low (<18.5), normal (18.5–
24.9), overweight (25–29.9), or obese (‡30). Comorbidity
consisted of reporting of 1 or more of 10 chronic health con-
ditions (heart disease, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes,
high cholesterol, stroke, anemia, migraines, angina, and oste-
oporosis) during the past year and was treated as a categorical
variable. Use of anti-inflammatory medications was assessed
by self-reported use in the prior month of such prescription and
nonprescription medications as assessed by SWAN pharma-
cologists, independent of report of PMSx.
Active smoking status was assessed by standard ques-
tions.20 Passive smoke exposure was assessed by the vali-
dated instrument of Coghlin et al.21 Never smokers with no
passive
smoke
exposure
were
used
as
the
referent
group. Physical activity was measured by a composite score
based on the Kaiser Permanente Activity Score,22 a modifi-
cation of the Baecke scale23 assessing three domains: sports,
leisure, and household activities. Usual servings of alcoholic
beverages per week were analyzed as none, £1, and >1 (one
serving = 12 oz. beer, 5 oz. wine, or 1.5 oz hard liquor).

GOLD ET AL.
 Social support was assessed by a summed scale of how often
four types of needed emotional and instrumental supports were
available, with responses ranging from 0 = none of the time to
4 = all of the time24 and analyzed by quartiles of the total score
in the SWAN baseline cohort. A measure of the symptom
sensitivity trait was measured at follow-up visit 01 using a
summed score (degree of awareness of loud noise, hot or cold,
hunger, pain, and things happening in one’s body, with re-
sponses ranging from 1 = not at all true to 5 = extremely true)25
and analyzed dichotomously as at or above versus below 15,
the median for the SWAN cohort. Depressive symptoms were
assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
(CES-D)26 scale (score ‡16 on a 20-item scale of the extent to
which each item was experienced in the previous week).
Data analyses
This was a cross-sectional analysis, using only data from
the baseline visit. Descriptive statistics were computed using
bivariate analyses for each symptom grouping (as described
below), each independent variable, and each covariate. Ca-
tegorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests or
Fisher’s exact test for comparison of proportions, and t-tests
and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for compari-
sons involving continuous variables. Unadjusted odd ratios
(ORs) were computed for each symptom group by each in-
dependent variable.
We conducted factor analyses with Varimax rotations to
determine appropriate groupings of the eight symptoms so
that a parsimonious set of outcome variables could be eval-
uated. To determine whether to retain a particular symptom
in a symptom grouping, we used factor loadings of 0.40 or
more. If items loaded on more than one factor, the item with
the highest loading was retained. Factors were accepted with
an eigen value of 1.0 or greater. As in our prior work,12 the
five resulting PMSx groupings were as follows: (1) anxiety/
jittery/nervous and mood changes, (2) abdominal cramps and
back/joint/muscle pain, (3) increased appetite/craving and
weight gain/bloating, (4) breast pain/tenderness, and (5)
headaches. Because women often reported more than one
symptom, associations of the independent variables with the
total number of these five symptom groupings (>3 vs. £3)
were also estimated.
To assess potential confounding variables, we calculated
unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs), one variable at a time. To adjust simultaneously for
confounding variables, multiple logistic regression models
were developed for each PMSx grouping. Covariates that were
associated (at p < 0.15) in unadjusted analyses were entered into
backward stepwise multiple logistic regression models for each
PMSx grouping with elimination of variables found not to be
significant ( p > 0.05). The independent variable, elevated
hsCRP (>3 mg/L vs. £3 mg/L), was forced into all multiple
logistic regression models. AIC goodness of fit test criteria were
used for multiple logistic regression models. Interactions with
race-ethnicity and menopause status were evaluated to deter-
mine if any relationships observed differed by these variables.
Results
The unadjusted proportion of women who reported each
PMSx, except breast pain or headaches, was significantly in-
creased for women who had hs-CRP values >3 mg/L (Table 1).
In addition, mean age was significantly lower among women
who reported all PMSx except for those reporting premen-
strual breast pain. All symptoms were reported by significantly
more Hispanics and early perimenopausal women and by
significantly less Chinese and Japanese than Caucasian or
premenopausal women. Most symptoms (except changes in
appetite/weight/bloating and breast pain) were reported by
fewer women with more than a high school education, higher
annual income, and lower symptom sensitivity scores com-
pared to those with a high school education or less, lower
annual income, and higher symptom sensitivity.
Most symptoms (except for breast pain or headaches) were
reported by significantly more obese women, those with ac-
tive or passive smoke exposure, and by women with elevated
depressive symptom scores (for all symptoms) than normal
weight women, women without active or passive smoke ex-
posure, or women with lower depressive symptom scores.
Parity, physical activity, hypertension, arthritis, and anemia
were significantly positively and alcohol consumption was
significantly negatively related to headaches. However, most
of the differences were relatively small and likely significant
because of the large sample size. Diabetes, cancer, high
cholesterol, stroke, and thyroid disease were not significantly
related to any symptoms, nor was heart disease except for a
significant relationship to abdominal cramps and pain.
Unadjusted analyses
In unadjusted analyses, hs-CRP levels >3 mg/L were sig-
nificantly associated with premenstrual mood symptoms,
regardless of whether the conservative definition (symptom
disappeared within 3 days of onset of menses) was used
(OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.22–1.75) or if the symptom did not
disappear within 3 days of onset of menses (OR = 1.74, 95%
CI 1.17–2.58) (Table 2). Similarly, in unadjusted analyses,
hs-CRP levels >3 mg/L were significantly associated with
premenstrual abdominal cramps/pain, regardless of whether
the conservative definition was used (OR = 1.84, 95% CI
1.52–2.23) or if the symptom did not disappear within 3 days
of onset of menses (OR= 2.36, 95% CI 1.61–3.46). Also, in
unadjusted analyses, hs-CRP levels >3 mg/L were significantly
positively associated with premenstrual appetite cravings/
weight gain/bloating, regardless of whether the conservative
definition (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.42–2.22) or less conservative
definition (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.54–3.42) was used.
An elevated hs-CRP level was not associated with re-
porting premenstrual breast pain or headaches in unadjusted
analyses. Other factors related to each symptom group were
similar to those we found previously12 (data not shown).
We also examined the unadjusted mean hs-CRP by number
of symptom groups reported and found a trend of increasing
means (from 3.11 – 7.78 mg/L for none, 3.18 – 9.12 mg/L for
one, 3.06 – 4.76 for two, 3.51 – 5.31 mg/L for three, 4.25 –
6.52 mg/L for four to 4.22 – 5.38 mg/L for five symptoms)
with increasing number of symptom groups, which was sig-
nificant in ANOVA ( p = 0.026), but the trend was not
monotonic. However, because the distribution of hs-CRP was
skewed to the right, we examined median hs-CRP by number
of symptom groups reported and found that the median in-
creased monotonically from 1.0 mg/L for none to 2.1 mg/L
for five symptoms reported. Further, the unadjusted ORs for
the association of elevated hs-CRP with number of symptoms

 reported also increased monotonically from 0.90 (95% CI
0.51–1.60) for one symptom to 2.21 (95% CI 1.35–3.62) for
five symptoms reported; all 95% CIs for these ORs included
1.0 until four or more symptoms were reported.
Multivariable models
In backward stepwise multiple logistic regression models,
removing variables not significant ( p > 0.05), having an hs-
CRP level >3 mg/L remained significantly positively associ-
ated with premenstrual mood symptoms (adjusted OR
[aOR] = 1.27, 95% CI 1.02–1.58), using the conservative
definition of the symptom disappearing within 3 days of onset
of menses, after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, blood draw
within cycle days 2–5, menopausal status, CES-D ‡16,
symptom sensitivity score ‡15, parity, social support, and
comorbidities (Table 3). Having an hs-CRP level >3 mg/L also
remained significantly positively associated with premenstrual
abdominal cramps/back pain (aOR= 1.40, 95% CI 1.09–1.80)
after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, blood draw within
cycle days 2–5, menopausal status, BMI category, CES-D ‡16,
symptom sensitivity ‡15, use of anti-inflammatory medica-
tions in the past month, and education.
In addition, having an hs-CRP level >3 mg/L also remained
significantly positively associated with reporting premenstrual
appetite cravings/weight gain/bloating (aOR= 1.41, 95% CI
1.04–1.89) after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, blood draw
within cycle days 2–5, menopausal status, BMI category,
physical activity score, CES-D ‡16, symptom sensitivity ‡15,
use of anti-inflammatory medication, comorbidities, and
physical activity. Having an hs-CRP level >3 mg/L also re-
mained significantly positively associated with reporting pre-
menstrual breast pain (aOR= 1.26, 95% CI 1.02–1.55) after
adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, blood draw within cycle
days 2–5, menopausal status, and BMI category.
Mood symptoms, abdominal cramps/back pain, appetite
cravings/weight gain/bloating, and breast pain also remained
significantly positively related to elevated hs-CRP, with similar
magnitude of association, in adjusted models using the less
conservative definition of not reporting disappearance of the
symptom within 3 days of onset of menses. An elevated hs-
CRP was not significantly related to premenstrual headache
(aOR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.68–1.14) or to having three or more
PMSx (aOR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.95–1.40) in multivariable mod-
els, regardless of definition used regarding disappearance of
symptoms within 3 days of onset of the menstrual period and
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, blood draw within cycle days
2–5, menopausal status, CES-D ‡16, use of anti-inflammatory
medications in the past month, and comorbidities.
We also computed adjusted ORs using the conservative
definition for symptoms, but with a criterion of >5 mg/L for
the elevation of hs-CRP, and found nearly identical results to
those above for the lower cutoff except that the associations
were somewhat stronger for abdominal cramps/back pain
(aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15–2.10), weight gain/bloating (aOR
1.52, 95% CI 1.07–2.15), and reporting 3+ symptoms (aOR
1.50, 95% CI 1.18–1.89).
In addition, in multivariable models for each symptom, we
tested interaction of elevated hs-CRP with race/ethnicity and
separately with menopausal status and found none of the in-
teraction terms to be statistically significant. This indicated that
the relationship of elevated hs-CRP to each symptom did not
vary by menopausal status or across racial/ethnic groups, al-
though the sample sizes in some racial/ethnic subgroups were
probably too small to provide adequate statistical power to
detect some meaningful differences as statistically significant.
We also computed adjusted ORs for number of symptoms in
relationship to hs-CRP >3 mg/L and found a trend of increasing
adjusted ORs with increasing number of symptoms reported
(from 0.66, 95% CI 0.64–1.30 for one symptom to 1.21, 95%
CI 0.67–2.18 for five symptoms) (data not shown), although the
95% CIs were overlapping and none excluded 1.0.
Furthermore, because of the documented relationship of
inflammation and depressive symptoms,27,28 we reran all
analyses for Table 3 excluding women with CES-D ‡16, and
the adjusted ORs remained at a similar magnitude, although
some 95% CIs included 1.0 due to the reduced sample size
(data not shown). We also reran analyses, adjusting for cur-
rently taking ‘‘medications for a nervous condition such as
tranquilizers, sedatives, sleeping pills, or antidepression
medication,’’ which resulted in little change in adjusted ORs
(data not shown). Interactions of each symptom group with
the use of such medications were all nonsignificant.
Discussion
In our cross-sectional study, elevated hs-CRP (>3 mg/L),
an acute phase biomarker of inflammation, was significantly
related to a 26%–41% increased odds of reporting of pre-
menstrual mood symptoms, abdominal cramps/back pain,

 appetite cravings/weight gain/bloating, and breast pain, but
not headache, after adjusting for confounding variables. The
results also revealed that the relationship of other risk factors
to the different symptoms was not uniform across PMSx,
suggesting different mechanisms for the occurrence of the
different symptom groups. However, several factors (youn-
ger age, being in the early perimenopause, having an elevated
depressive symptom score, and increased symptom sensi-
tivity score) were associated with most symptoms with
similar magnitudes of association.
The significant relationships of these PMSx with elevated
hs-CRP levels have potential clinical implications for the
treatment of these symptoms and possibly for prevention by
advising women about the factors (e.g., smoking, overweight,
and obesity) that are associated with inflammation, as well as
suggesting avenues for future mechanistic and epidemiologic
research.
To date, little literature has focused on the relationship of
inflammation to PMSx, despite the fact that some women use
anti-inflammatory medications to treat these frequently oc-
curring symptoms. The observation of significant relation-
ships of inflammation with some PMSx suggests that
inflammation may be involved in the occurrence of these
symptoms, although this requires future investigation using
longitudinal data to establish the temporal sequence.
Our results are consistent with those of some prior studies
that have found suggestive, but not always significant dif-
ferences in inflammation between women reporting and
women not reporting emotional or physical PMSx. However,
most of these studies have included relatively small samples
and have studied young (e.g., ages 18–30 years) white
women.15,16 The present results are a unique contribution in
that these frequently occurring PMSx were examined in a
large sample of midlife (not young) women from a diverse
sample that included five racial/ethnic groups.
Strengths and limitations
This study had several significant strengths. First, the sam-
ple comprised a large, racially/ethnically diverse, community-
based sample of midlife women. Thus, we had good statistical
power to detect meaningful associations, and the results are
likely to have fairly good generalizability. Second, the
assessment of hs-CRP used a high-quality laboratory mea-
sure, risk factors were assessed using standardized validated
instruments, and both types of assessments were made
independently of symptom reporting, thus reducing bias and
misclassification. Third, we simultaneously statistically
controlled for a number of potential risk factors so that we
could assess the independent effects of elevated hs-CRP and
each risk factor while controlling for the effects of others,
thus minimizing the likelihood of residual confounding.
However, the study also had some limitations. First, mul-
tiple statistical comparisons were made; so, some of the ob-
served associations may have occurred by chance or represent
markers for other uncontrolled factors; thus, caution must be
used for interpreting marginally significant results as well as
for significant results for modestly strong associations. Second,
the study was cross-sectional; thus, the temporal relationships
to symptom reporting could not be adequately assessed, and
some associations may have resulted from some factors being
used for self-medication or be a consequence of symptoms
rather than being causally related (e.g., anti-inflammatory
medications, physical activity, and depressive symptoms). A
longitudinal study is needed to resolve the temporal sequence
of the associations observed here.
Third, all of the factors examined were recalled by par-
ticipants and thus may lack accuracy of recall, although recall
was unlikely to differ by hs-CRP status. Fourth, we did not
have information on the presence of infection in participants
at the time of blood draw, which could have influenced the
results, although was unlikely to differ by symptom report-
ing. Fifth, due to time limitations for administration of the
study instruments, we were not able to include an exhaustive
list of symptoms so that some, such as irritability, were not
included. Furthermore, the outcomes were not rare so that the
ORs may have overestimated risk. Also, our sample sizes in
some racial/ethnic groups may have been too small to detect
interaction with elevated hs-CRP as statistically significant.
Finally, we examined premenstrual symptoms; so, our find-
ings may not apply to premenstrual syndrome.
Conclusions
Premenstrual mood symptoms, abdominal cramps/back
pain, appetite cravings/weight gain/bloating, and breast pain,
but not headache, appear to be significantly and positively
related to elevated hs-CRP levels, a biomarker of inflam-
mation, although with modestly strong associations, even
after adjustment for multiple confounding variables. The
results also suggest that the factors associated with each
premenstrual symptom are complex, suggesting potentially
different mechanisms for the etiologies of some symptoms.
These results suggest that inflammation may play a mecha-
nistic role in most PMSx, although further longitudinal study
of these relationships is needed. However, recommending to
women to avoid behaviors that are associated with inflam-
mation may be helpful for prevention, and anti-inflammatory
agents may be useful for treatment of these symptoms.
