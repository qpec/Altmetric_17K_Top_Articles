ABSTRACT 
Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an anti-gravity 
treadmill return to running programme on self-efficacy and subjective knee function 
following knee osteochondral surgery. Case Description: A 39-year-old otherwise 
healthy female endurance runner with a left knee femoral cartilage grade 3-4 defect 
3cm2. The patient underwent single step arthroscopic microfracture with Bone 
Marrow Aspirate Concentrate. An AlterG anti-gravity treadmill was used to 
manipulate loading during a graduated phased return to running over 8 weeks. Self-
efficacy was evaluated using the Self-Efficacy for Rehabilitation outcomes scale 
(SER) and the Knee Self-Efficacy Scale (K-SES). Subjective knee function was 
evaluated using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and 
International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC). 
Outcomes: The programme resulted in improvements in SER (57%), K-SES present 
(89%) and K-SES future (65%) self-efficacy domains. The IKDC score demonstrated 
a clinically important improvement with an increase from 62.1 in week 1 to 86.2 in 
week 8 (39%). Only the KOOS Sport/Rec subscale showed a clinically important 
improvement from week 1 to week 8. Discussion: The programme resulted in 
improved knee and rehabilitation self-efficacy and subjective knee function following 
osteochondral repair of the knee. This case report illustrates the importance of 
considering self-efficacy in rehabilitation after knee osteochondral surgery and 
highlights the potential role for anti-gravity treadmills in enhancing self-efficacy and 
subjective knee function in preparation for a return to sport.

BACKGROUND 
Osteochondral defects of the knee are a frequent cause of pain and reduced 
function, especially in active people. Surgical techniques to repair osteochondral 
damage have been shown to improve function and relieve pain.30 However, 
rehabilitation after osteochondral surgery is lengthy due to the new tissue taking up 
to 3 years to mature.22 The neo-cartilage tissue is not as durable as mature tissue 
and therefore loading needs to be controlled in the rehabilitation process. The timing 
of a return to running after osteochondral surgery varies depending on individual and 
surgical factors but is generally between 6 to 12 months post-surgery.27 
 
 
Anti-gravity treadmills are being increasingly used after knee surgery to reduce 
ground reaction forces during walking and running to facilitate postoperative 
rehabilitation.4, 9 Muscle activity decreases as body weight decreases on an anti-
gravity treadmill, but the percentage change in muscle activity is less than the 
percentage change in body weight.25 It is possible to achieve target knee forces 
during rehabilitation using an anti-gravity treadmill.32 Anti-gravity treadmills have 
been shown to be safe and feasible to use in early rehabilitation following total knee 
replacement.4 However, there are no studies on the use of anti-gravity treadmills in a 
knee osteochondral population despite their increasing inclusion in rehabilitation 
guidelines.  
 
Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are routinely used to measure a 
person’s health status at a point in time and as primary end points in clinical trials.3 
Subjective measures of knee function are important in the assessment of outcome 
following injury or surgery as they provide the patient’s perspective of their health 
  
5 
status. The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form 
(IKDC) and the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) have both been found 
to be reliable, valid and responsive PROMs in patients who have undergone 
cartilage repair surgery.33 
 
Rehabilitation programmes do not always address the psychosocial factors inherent 
in return to sport. Athletes may have doubts about their readiness to return to their 
sport and fears about possible reinjury.8 Self-efficacy is a key component within the 
theoretical framework of social cognitive theory (SCT) where it is the “perceived 
capability of a person to perform a specific action required to achieve a concrete 
goal”.2 This is a highly pertinent concept for orthopaedic rehabilitation which is 
founded on specific actions being taken to achieve functional goals. Self-efficacy is 
temporal and is consequently open to change during the rehabilitation process.46 
Self-efficacy beliefs have been found to influence rehabilitation outcome after total 
joint arthroplasty.29, 45 Self-efficacy has only been evaluated in anti-gravity treadmill 
rehabilitation in a single case study where it was found that general self-efficacy was 
elevated after a 6 week anti-gravity treadmill rehabilitation programme for an 
amputee.26 To date, there have been no studies on the role of either, general or 
domain specific self-efficacy, in rehabilitation after knee osteochondral repair.  
 
This case report uses the CARE guidelines12 to present the rehabilitation details and 
self-efficacy and subjective knee function outcome measures during an 8 week anti-
gravity treadmill rehabilitation programme for a female runner 9 months post-
osteochondral repair knee surgery.  Full ethics committee approval and patient 
informed consent were gained. The use of anti-gravity treadmills is a new 
rehabilitative approach and with the increasing importance of individualised care, this 
  
6 
case report will help to provide a greater understanding of the patient experience that 
is highly relevant to orthopaedic rehabilitation practice. 
 
The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an anti-gravity treadmill return 
to running programme on self-efficacy and subjective knee function following knee 
osteochondral surgery. It is hypothesised that the use of an anti-gravity treadmill will 
have a positive influence on knee and rehabilitation self-efficacy and subjective knee 
function. 
 
METHODS 
 
CASE DESCRIPTION 
HISTORY 
The patient was a 39-year-old (height 167cm; weight 60.3kg) otherwise healthy 
female endurance runner who had been participating in 10K to marathon distance 
running events for the past 6 years. The patient is a fore-foot runner and averaged 
26 miles per week at an average pace of 7.5 to 8 minutes per mile prior to injury in 
February 2015. The patient had been experiencing knee symptoms for several years 
prior to February 2015. The patient was initially advised not to run for 6 months and 
then, as there was no improvement, was advised to stop running altogether. Running 
was such a major contributor to the patient’s quality of life that, from her perspective, 
stopping running was not an option and a second orthopaedic opinion was sought. 
The patient was found to have a left knee femoral cartilage grade 3-4 defect 3cm2 
and a grade 1 lateral tibial cartilage defect. The patient underwent single step 
arthroscopic osteochondral repair surgery in September 2015 comprising 
  
7 
microfracture and Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC)5, 14 as shown in 
Figure 1.

BMAC therapy. (C) Osteochondral repair underway with BMAC and fibrin. 
 
Post-operatively, the patient was partial weight-bearing for 2 weeks then as tolerated 
whilst wearing an Ossur Rebound cartilage brace with medial hinge. The patient 
underwent a comprehensive postoperative rehabilitation programme including 
swimming, cycling and leg strengthening exercises. The ultimate goal from the 
patient’s perspective was to return to running. At nine months following surgery, the 
patient had full range of knee motion and no knee pain and was referred to our 
specialist sports rehabilitation clinic to facilitate a return to full weight bearing (FWB) 
running at 12 postoperative months. 
 
INTERVENTION 
Maturation of the new tissue can take up to three years22, so optimising loading 
following osteochondral surgery is an important part of the rehabilitation process.13, 28 
The ability to run on a treadmill at 8km/h for more than 10 minutes is one of the 
criteria for progression from rehabilitation Phase 2 (Matrix production and 
A 
B 
C 
  
8 
organisation) to Phase 3 (Repair cartilage maturation) following knee osteochondral 
repair.28 An AlterG Anti-Gravity Treadmill P200 model was used to manipulate 
loading during a graduated phased return to running.7 The AlterG treadmill has been 
found to have minor deviations in unloading but these are less than 5% for 40-90% 
body weight24 which is less than the typical deviations in accuracy in partial weight 
bearing with crutches after cartilage repair of the knee.10

TABLE 1. Anti-gravity treadmill rehabilitation programme parameters 
 
The programme comprised of 12 antigravity treadmill sessions over an 8-week 
period taking the patient from 30% to 80% bodyweight as detailed in Table 1. The 
patient wore the Ossur Rebound cartilage brace and the same running shoes 
during every session. The patient maintained their home exercises (including 
swimming, cycling and leg strengthening) as previously prescribed. Each treadmill 
session started with a 5 minute 100% body weight self-paced walking warm up and 
ended with a 5 minute 100% body weight self-paced walking cool down. A visual

analogue scale pain score was asked before, during and after each session. The 
patient was advised to stop if at any time during a session she experienced knee 
pain, but at no time during the programme was any pain reported.  
 
Increasing running speed rather than increasing per cent body weight has been 
shown to have the strongest effect on the maximum plantar forces.42 The load 
through the plantar surface of the foot is an indirect measure of ground reaction 
forces through the lower limbs. Therefore, as graduated loading of the knee was 
important in this rehabilitation programme, the running speed was controlled by 
using a self-selected pace with the patient advised to keep her rating of perceived 
exertion (RPE) at a light level (under 12) throughout every session. The use of the 
Borg RPE scale was selected as research has shown that RPE values do not require 
adjustment in a lowered body weight environment.18 
 
 
OUTCOMES 
 
SELF-EFFICACY FOR REHABILITATION OUTCOMES SCALE (SER)  
The SER is a 12-item measure developed according to Bandura’s guidelines for 
assessing participants’ beliefs about their abilities to perform activities in 
rehabilitation.29, 37  The SER was designed specifically for patients undergoing lower 
limb orthopaedic surgery45 and has been used in ligament reconstruction6 and joint 
replacement23 but it has not been previously used in a knee osteochondral repair 
population. The mean SER scores are shown in Figure 2. 
 
  
10 
KNEE SELF-EFFICACY SCALE (K-SES)  
The Knee Self-Efficacy Scale (K-SES) is a 22-item measure used to determine 
perceived knee function self-efficacy both in the present (K-SESPRESENT) and for the 
future (K-SESFUTURE).39 Internal locus of control is related to more proactive health 
behaviours and has been shown to be an important factor in determining K-
SESPRESENT  but not K-SESFUTURE.38  Knee-related function in sports and recreation 
has been shown to be a factor in knee self-efficacy.38 The K-SES has not been 
evaluated in a population of people who have undergone knee osteochondral repair 
but has been shown to demonstrate good responsiveness for patients with an ACL 
injury41 and it is considered preferable to use rather than a general self-efficacy 
score.19 The mean K-SESPRESENT and K-SESFUTURE scores are shown in Figure 2. 
 
KNEE INJURY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCORE (KOOS)11, 17, 35  
The KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measure that was developed to evaluate 
symptoms and function in people with a range of knee injuries. The KOOS 
comprises 42 items containing 5 separately scored subscales that represent different 
health dimensions with a higher score indicating a greater level of function.35 The 
KOOS has been identified as fulfilling the basic requirements for reliability, validity, 
and responsiveness in cartilage repair patients.33 The minimal perceptible clinical 
improvement (MPCI) of the KOOS was initially purported to be 8-10 points.34 
However, a recent study in knee cartilage repair patients has shown that the MCID 
varies across the KOOS subscales: Symptoms (9); Pain (14); Activities of Daily 
Living (ADL) (10); Sports and Recreation (Sport/Rec)(28); and Quality of Life 
(QoL)(28).20 
 
  
11 
INTERNATIONAL KNEE DOCUMENTATION COMMITTEE SUBJECTIVE KNEE 
FORM (IKDC)  
The IKDC is a patient reported outcome designed to measure symptoms, function 
and sports activity in people with a range of knee conditions.21 The IKDC consists of 
18 items and is scored by calculating the difference between the raw score and 
lowest possible score and then dividing this difference by the range of possible 
scores multiplied by 100. A higher IKDC score indicates a greater level of function 
and lower level of knee symptoms. The IKDC has been identified as fulfilling the 
basic requirements for reliability, validity, and responsiveness in cartilage repair 
patients.33 Normative data for the IKDC has shown a mean score of 87.6 (age 18-
50).1 A change in the IKDC score greater than 20.5 means that the individual is likely 
to perceive themselves as improved.33 The minimum clinically important difference 
(MCID) for the IKDC after surgery for focal articular cartilage defects was found to be 
6.3 at 6 months and 16.7 at 12 months postoperatively.15 Normative data has been 
established for the IKDC for age and gender for the US population.1 
 
RESULTS 
The scores for the SER and K-SES are shown in Figure 2 where there was a 57% 
increase in SER, 89% increase in K-SES Present and 65% increase in K-SES future 
self-efficacy domains from baseline to week 8 of the programme.

The KOOS subscale and IKDC scores are shown in Figure 3. The IKDC percentile 
placements for this patient were 20th, 30th, 45th and 45th for weeks 1, 4, 6 and 8 
respectively. There was a 24.14 point improvement in the IKDC from baseline to 
week 8 of the programme.  
 
Following the 8 weeks of rehabilitation with the anti-gravity treadmill the patient was 
advised that she could gradually introduce running exercise but to restrict or avoid 
running on pavements.

DISCUSSION 
 
The main findings from this case report were that an 8-week anti-gravity treadmill 
programme resulted in large improvements in rehabilitation (57% increase), knee 
present (89% increase) and knee future (65% increase) self-efficacy domains. Prior 
studies have reported an association between postoperative self-efficacy and 
improved functional recovery outcomes among individuals who have undergone hip 
or knee replacement.29, 31, 43 Increased self-efficacy for rehabilitation has been shown 
to contribute to improved knee function following ACL reconstruction6 and knee 
replacement surgery.23 In the present case, at 9 months post BMAC surgery knee 
self-efficacy was lower than females 4 months post ACL reconstruction41 and the

SER score only indicated a moderate belief in ability to perform activities in 
rehabilitation. The patient’s experience of preparing for the first session reflects 
these levels of belief where she was “really looking forward to getting started but also 
slightly nervous” and that “this is not something I want to rush as I believe we have 
made such good progress”. However, after moving from 30 to 40% body weight the 
patient stated “yesterday’s session felt good and I haven’t had any adverse reaction 
or swelling” suggesting that the patient’s self-efficacy beliefs were open to change. 
After the completion of the 8 week programme, the K-SES was higher for both 
present and future knee self-efficacy than patients who were 12 months post ACL 
reconstruction surgery.40 The increase in knee self-efficacy in the present may have 
been a reflection of the patient’s perception that they had a greater sense of control 
of their return to running rehabilitation. Knee self-efficacy for the future experienced a 
slight drop at the end of the last session, this was not unexpected, and was likely to 
be due to the patient reaching the transition point from supervised to independent 
rehabilitation.  
 
In terms of patient-reported knee function, a 39% improvement was found in the 
IKDC score (Figure 3) with the 8-week score being comparable with previously 
reported normative data.1 The 24.14 point improvement in the IKDC is higher than 
previously reported 6 and 9 month MCIDs for focal articular cartilage repair 
surgery15, indicating that the patient was likely to have perceived themselves as 
improved.33 On the basis of the reported MCIDs for each of the KOOS subscales20, 
only the KOOS Sport/Rec subscale showed a clinically important improvement from 
week 1 to week 8 of the programme (Figure 3). The KOOS QoL subscale did show a 
clinically important improvement between week 1 to week 6 but this reduced below 
  
15 
the MCID level at week 8. The patient reported that the reduction in KOOS QoL from 
week 6 to week 8 was as a result of her having a greater awareness of her knee 
(Q1) due to having to wear the knee brace as she increased activity level. Future 
studies should continue data collection past the return to running to assess if any 
reductions in self-efficacy at the point of transition to independent training return to 
the higher level. The lack of clinically important levels of improvements in the Pain, 
Symptoms and ADL subscales are likely to reflect the previously reported ceiling 
effects of these subscales36, 44 and this supports using only the Sport and QoL 
subscales in the later stages of return to sport rehabilitation.  
 
Return to sport is one of the main motivations for having knee osteochondral 
surgery, however, the actual return to sports rate after surgery is often lower than 
expected.16 Typically, for non-elite sports participants, physical therapy resources 
are concentrated on the early and mid-stages of rehabilitation after knee 
osteochondral surgery and often do not address the psychosocial factors inherent in 
a return to sport. This case report illustrates the importance of considering self-
efficacy in rehabilitation after knee osteochondral surgery and highlights the potential 
role for anti-gravity treadmills in enhancing self-efficacy in preparation for a return to 
sport. However, although case reports have the ability to guide rehabilitation in 
clinical practice12, they do not allow the determination of any cause-effect 
relationships or generalisation to wider populations. It is therefore not possible to 
determine from this case report whether the improvements in self-efficacy and 
subjective knee function were primarily the result of the anti-gravity treadmill 
intervention, the supervised rehabilitation sessions and/or the addition of a further 2 
months of time post-surgery. Future studies should look to evaluate the role of these 
  
16 
factors by comparing standard care with standard care plus an anti-gravity treadmill 
programme in patients with knee cartilage lesions. Additionally, the psychometric 
properties of the K-SES and the SER have not been evaluated for a knee 
osteochondral surgery population and this also provides opportunity for further 
studies.  
 
CONCLUSION 
The main finding of this case report was the demonstration that an 8-week anti-
gravity treadmill programme resulted in improved knee and rehabilitation self-efficacy 
and subjective knee function following osteochondral repair of the knee. This case 
report illustrates the importance of considering self-efficacy in rehabilitation after 
knee osteochondral surgery and highlights the potential role for anti-gravity 
treadmills in enhancing self-efficacy and subjective knee function in preparation for a 
return to sport. Further studies are warranted to explore the mechanisms through 
which self-efficacy interventions may influence functional outcomes and return to 
sport after osteochondral knee surgery.
