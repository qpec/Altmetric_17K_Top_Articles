IMPORTANCE This study found evidence of a threshold effect in which the presence of bilateral
soft drusen and depigmentation of retinal pigment epithelium was associated with substantially
low health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult Latinos from the United States.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association of general and vision-specific HRQoL with age-related
macular degeneration (AMD), overall and by bilaterality and severity, in adult Latinos.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional, population-based study included
4876 participants from the general urban community in 6 US Census tracts in La Puente,
California. The data for these analyses were collected as part of a population-based study of
ocular diseases in adult Latinos in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study from February 1, 2000,
through May 31, 2003. The analysis was performed from November 2010 to February 2011.
Additional analyses were performed in June 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean-adjusted HRQoL scores and effect sizes.
RESULTS Of the 4876 participants included in the analysis, 4402 (90.3%) had no AMD, and
474 (9.7%) had any AMD, with 453 having early (9.3%) and 21 (0.4%) having late stages of
the disease. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 54.8 (10.7) years. Of the 4876 participants,
2001 (41.0%) were male and 2875 (59.0%) were female. In this cohort of Latinos,
participants with AMD had lower vision-specific HRQoL scores. General HRQoL was assessed
by the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey and self-reported
vision-related HRQoL by the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25
(NEI-VFQ-25). Composite NEI-VFQ-25 scores were 59.5 (95% CI, 50.8-68.1) for those with
late-stage AMD and 79.4 (95% CI, 72.5-86.1) for those with early-stage AMD, compared with
participants without AMD 80.7 (95% CI, 73.9-82.4); P < .001. Several lesions of early AMD
were associated with lower NEI-VFQ-25 composite scores and 8 to 10 individual scales. Large
effect sizes and lower mean scores were observed for those with late AMD lesions, overall
and specifically for geographic atrophy and neovascular AMD, compared with those without
AMD. With the use of concatenated bilateral severity levels for AMD, decreases in the
NEI-VFQ-25 composite and individual scale scores were observed at the transition from a
unilateral to bilateral severity level of 40, which corresponds to having bilateral soft drusen
(>125 μm in diameter with drusen area �196 350 μm2) and depigmentation of retinal
pigment epithelium (slope of −19.17 for the NEI-VFQ-25 composite score). Measures of
general health, as assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health
Survey, were not affected in this cohort.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study of adult Latinos, early AMD lesions are
associated with lower self-reported, vision-specific HRQoL but not general HRQoL. Severity
and bilaterality of AMD are associated with measurably lower HRQoL scores, with the largest
difference in scores occurring for individuals with both eyes affected. A concatenated
approach to incorporate bilateral severity might be more useful and provide better insight
into the association of AMD and HRQoL.

A
ge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic,
progressive disorder that mainly affects people older
than 50 years and is the leading cause of irreversible
blindness in adults older than 60 years in the Western
world.1-5 With limited and expensive treatment options
available and an aging world population, this ocular disorder
is expected to continue to increase as a major public health
problem, with substantial clinical, emotional, and financial
effects on patients and marked adverse consequences for the
economy.6-11
Central vision affects a person’
s interaction with the en-
vironment and plays a crucial role in daily activities. There-
fore, central vision impairment that results from AMD can lead
to compromised health-related quality of life (HRQoL).6,7,9,10
People with AMD may find performing daily tasks much more
challenging than people without the disease, even when the
disease is in its earlier stages.5,6,9,10
The effect of AMD on HRQoL has been investigated in a
numberofstudies5-7,9,10;mostofthesestudies5-7,9,10havebeen
conducted on clinic-based samples, predominantly in non-
Hispanic whites. These associations among Latinos remain
largely unexplored, even though Latinos constitute the larg-
est and fastest-growing minority segment of the US
population.12,13 Studies14-16 on Latinos have found this popu-
lation to have a different pattern of AMD prevalence, inci-
dence, progression, and risk factors. Moreover, the lower level
of health care access and use in this group is likely to affect fol-
low-up care of these patients and may render them more sus-
ceptibletodiminishedHRQoL.17,18Theeffectofbilateralityand
severity of AMD on patients’visual function and HRQoL has
not been well documented.5,9,10 Data from the Los Angeles La-
tino Eye Study (LALES), a population-based, ocular epidemio-
logic study in adult Latinos, offered us a unique opportunity
to address these issues.13
Methods
Design and Sample
The data for these analyses were collected as part of LALES
fromFebruary1,2000,throughMay31,2003.Theanalysiswas
performed from November 2010 to February 2011. Addi-
tional analyses were performed in June 2014. Details of the
study design, sampling plan, and baseline data have been pre-
viously reported.13 In brief, a census of all residents living
within 6 US Census tracts in La Puente, California, was con-
ducted to identify eligible individuals.13
All eligible participants (aged ≥40 years at the time of
the census and self-identified as Latino) were informed of
the study and invited to participate. After written informed
consent was obtained, an interview was conducted to obtain
detailed data on demographics, ocular and medical condi-
tion, and health care access and use, followed by a detailed
eye examination. Institutional review board approval was
obtained from the Los Angeles County/University of South-
ern California Medical Center Institutional Review Board.13
Participants were assigned unique identifiers, and the data
were deidentified.
AMD Grading
A modification of the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy
Grading System (WARMGS)19 was used by masked graders at
the Wisconsin Ocular Epidemiology Reading Center to grade
individual AMD lesions. Detailed descriptions of all grading
procedures and definitions were previously reported.15,19 Each
eye was graded independently of the contralateral eye, with
adjudication by a senior grader (R.K.) to address discrepancy.
The WARMGS19-21 defined early AMD as the absence of
signs of advanced AMD and the presence of (1) soft indistinct
or reticular drusen or (2) hard distinct or soft distinct drusen
with pigmentary abnormalities (depigmentation of retinal pig-
ment epithelium [RPE] or increased retinal pigment [IRP]).
Advanced or late AMD was defined as the presence of (1)
geographic atrophy (GA) or (2) neovascular (exudative) AMD.
Neovascular AMD was defined as the presence of any of the
following lesions: (1) pigment epithelial detachment or age-
related retinal detachment, (2) subretinal hemorrhage, (3) sub-
retinal scar (subretinal fibrous scar), or (4) laser treatment for
neovascular AMD.
To assess the qualitative association between AMD sever-
ity and HRQoL, we used the modified WARMGS 6-step sever-
ityscale(levels10-60)forasubgroupofthetotalsample(eTable
1 in the Supplement). According to this scheme, a severity level
of 10 corresponds to no AMD, levels 20 to 40 correspond to
different levels of early AMD, and levels 40 and 50 represent
late AMD.
Wederivedaper-personcompositescaletoincorporatese-
verity and bilaterality for each person by concatenating per-
person bilateral severity using a scheme similar to that previ-
ously used by Klein et al22 for diabetic retinopathy. In brief, the
severity of AMD for a participant was derived by combining the
severity levels for each eye but giving greater weight to the eye
with the higher level of severity (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). This approach resulted in an 11-step scale (eTable 2 in
the Supplement). If the severity of AMD could not be graded
in 1 eye, that eye was considered to have a score equivalent to
the score of the other eye.
Assessment of HRQoL
We evaluated HRQoL using general and vision-specific
instruments. General HRQoL was assessed by the Medical
Key Points
Question What is the association between general and
vision-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a population-based
data set from the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study?
Findings The findings of this study of adult Latinos reveal lower
mean vision-specific HRQoL in people with AMD, even in the
earlier stages of the disease. Concatenated bilateral severity
provided evidence of measurably lower HRQoL scores with
severity and bilateral AMD.
Meaning A concatenated approach to incorporate bilateral
severity might provide insight into the association of AMD
and HRQoL.

Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12),
version 1.23 The standard US norm-based SF-12 physical
component summary (PCS) and mental component sum-
mary (MCS) scores were calculated.23 Self-reported, vision-
related HRQoL was assessed by the National Eye Institute
Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI-VFQ-25),24 which
consists of 12 vision-targeted scales based on 25 questions
that has been validated in different populations, including
Hispanics25,26 and patients with AMD.27,28 Eleven of the 12
scale scores (excluding the general health rating question)
were averaged to yield a composite score,24,26 with higher
scores representing better visual functioning and well-being.
Statistical Analyses
Sociodemographic and clinical factors across subgroups
defined by status of AMD (AMD vs no AMD) were compared
using t tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests for discrete
variables. Covariate-adjusted mean HRQoL scores were com-
pared among the no, early, and late AMD groups using analy-
sis of covariance. Covariates included were age, sex, vision
insurance, comorbidities, income, and other ocular disease.
We added other ocular disease as an indicator variable in the
final model. Because of the high correlation between age and
employment status, only age was retained. These analyses
were repeated for other AMD-related lesions.
Effect sizes (ESs) for the NEI-VFQ-25 and SF-12 scores were
calculated. The ES is an index used to measure the magni-
tude of effect of 1 variable on an outcome variable.29 On the
basis of Cohen’
s29 suggestion, an absolute ES of 0.20 to 0.49
is considered small, 0.50 to 0.79 is moderate, and 0.80 or
greater is large. To further assess the nature of the associa-
tion and to examine the possible nonlinear association be-
tween these risk factors and the severity of AMD, we used lo-
cal regression methods, adjusting for other covariates from the
final logistic regression model, to generate LOWESS (locally
weighted scatterplot smoothing) plots.30 For these analyses,
predicted HRQoL values were derived for the composite NEI-
VFQ-25 score and different subscale scores. We fitted models
of AMD severity for both eyes (concatenated) and separately
for the worse eye and the better eye.
To examine the rate of descent of the HRQoL score and to
determine the inflection point or threshold at which there is
a considerable decrease in HRQoL scores, we computed the
slope m between all consecutive points of the LOWESS curve.
We compared the change in slope values for each pair of ad-
jacent points by measuring the decrease in consecutive slopes.
Results
Description of Study Cohort
Of the 6357 participants who completed an ophthalmic ex-
amination, 6052 had fundus photographs, 5888 had grad-
able photographs for AMD, and 5464 had completed the SF-12
and NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaires. The 4876 participants with
no missing values in primary HRQoL subscales were in-
cluded in the analyses (eFigure in the Supplement). Of these,
2001 (41.0%) were male and 2875 (59.0%) were female, and
the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 54.8 (10.7) years. Of the
4876 participants included in the analysis, 4402 (90.3%) had
no AMD, and 474 had any AMD (9.7%), with 453 having early
(9.3%) and 21 (0.4%) having late stages of the disease.
Thecomparisonsofdifferentdemographicandclinicalchar-
acteristics between participants with or without AMD suggest
that participants with AMD were older, less likely to be female,
less likely to be educated or employed, more likely to have vi-
sion insurance, and more likely to report a history of ocular dis-
ease than those without AMD (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
HRQoL and AMD Status
Table 1 summarizes the results of mean differences in HRQoL
scores and ESs by AMD status. We found differences across
subgroups of no, early, and late AMD in all subscales of the
NEI-VFQ-25 except general health and ocular pain. Despite
the mean overall differences, the ESs for each of these HRQoL
scores were modest (all ESs <0.2) for early AMD. However,
there were small to very large ESs with late AMD in all sub-
scales. There were no substantial mean differences in the
SF-12 HRQoL scores among the AMD groups.
HRQoL and Early AMD Lesions
We examined the mean differences in HRQoL score, stratify-
ing them by the presence of early AMD lesions and compar-
ing them with those without any evidence of AMD. No sub-
stantial differences were found in HRQoL scores between
participants with soft distinct drusen and those without any
evidence of that lesion (Table 2). However, compared with
those without the lesion, participants with soft indistinct dru-
sen had lower scores on the composite NEI-VFQ-25 scale and
9 subscales.
Table3summarizestheresultsofHRQoLanalysesonthose
with IRP and RPE depigmentation. These pigmentary changes
were associated with lower scores in composite and several
other subscales. No significant associations were observed for
the SF-12 MCS or PCS scores for any of the early AMD lesions.
HRQoL and Advanced AMD Lesions
Age-adjusted mean scores suggest that participants with
advanced AMD lesions (GA and neovascular AMD) had statis-
tically significant lower mean scores and substantially larger
ESs than those without any AMD. Results were more pro-
nounced when participants with neovascular AMD were com-
pared with those without any lesion, with very large ESs for
some subscales. However, sample sizes (12 for GA and 17 for
neovascular AMD) precluded robust analyses in people with
these advanced AMD lesions.
Bilaterality and Severity of AMD and HRQoL
On the basis of LOWESS plots, we observed decreasing scores
in HRQoL with increasing severity of AMD for different
HRQoL domains on the NEI-VFQ-25. This finding was true
when severity was defined for the worse eye, the better eye,
or both eyes.
When we looked at the severity of AMD in the worse eye
and the composite NEI-VFQ-25 score, the decrease in median
predicted HRQoL score begins relatively early in the moder-

ate stages of early AMD, with the decrease in scores begin-
ning at a severity level of 40 with a slope of −0.6 (Figure 1).
When we repeated the analyses for the better eye, the de-
crease in the HRQoL score from level 30 to 40 was more pro-
nounced, with a slope of –2.79 (Figure 1).
To explore the role of bilaterality, we plotted the bilateral
concatenated severity of AMD against the HRQoL scores.
Figure 2 shows the LOWESS plot for 11 steps of bilateral sever-
ity of AMD and its association with the NEI-VFQ-25 compos-
ite score and the SF-12 PCS score. The slopes in Figure 2 were
suggestive of no substantial association between HRQoL in the
initial stages of early AMD (slope m10/10-40/<40= −0.53) up to a
unilateral severity of level 40, after which there is evidence of
a pronounced negative association of HRQoL and AMD sever-
ity between steps 6 and 7 (slope m40/<40-40/40 = −19.17), cor-
responding to a bilateral severity of level 40. The change in
slopeisalsoevidentalongtheseverityscale,withanothersharp
decrease between steps 60/<60 (unilateral neovascular AMD)
and 60/60 (bilateral neovascular AMD). In comparison, there
was very little change in the SF-12 PCS score until advanced
bilateral AMD (Figure 2).
Similar trends of decrease in median predicted score were
observed when these plots were repeated in most of the other
NEI-VFQ-25 subscales. The Wilcoxon rank sum test used to ex-
amine the magnitude of the threshold effect or turning point
revealed that, even in patients with bilateral intermediate
stages of AMD, which is still considered early in the disease,
HRQoL is substantially diminished.
Discussion
Data from LALES provided a unique opportunity to study the
effect of AMD on HRQoL in the largest and fastest-growing mi-
nority population of the United States that is known to have
different patterns of AMD prevalence and risk factors13,15,16,31
as well as health care access and use. To our knowledge, this
analysis provides the largest population-based data to ad-
dress the association of AMD and HRQoL.
Using the NEI-VFQ-25, we found that participants with
AMD had lower vision-specific HRQoL scores compared with
participants without AMD. Participants with early AMD le-
sions, including soft indistinct drusen and pigmentary abnor-
malities, had lower mean scores for several vision-specific
HRQoL subscales, such as driving, near vision, distant vision,
role, and social function. These results were more pro-
nounced in participants with advanced AMD. Measures of gen-
eral health, as indicated by the SF-12, were not affected in our
cohort.
We observed a strong inverse association between sever-
ity of AMD and vision-specific HRQoL. Severity and bilateral-
ity of disease were associated with lower HRQoL scores, such
that participants with more severe AMD had lower HRQoL
scores than participants with early AMD, and participants
with bilateral disease had lower scores than those with uni-
lateral disease. When examining the pattern of HRQoL scores
with increasing severity of AMD, the scores were lower in

participants with moderate or higher levels of AMD and with
involvement of both eyes. Specifically, the presence of bilat-
eral drusen of 125 μm or greater with an area of involvement
of 196 350 μm2 or greater, accompanied by bilateral RPE
depigmentation in both eyes, was associated with the lowest
mean HRQoL scores in this population.
Our results are consistent with previously published re-
sultsonAMDandHRQoL.Anumberofstudies2,6,7,9-11,32,33have
found similar evidence of the effect of late AMD on HRQoL.
Few studies have been performed on the effect of early AMD
on HRQoL despite the fact that early AMD is much more com-
mon than advanced AMD.7,9,10 However, our results for early
AMD lesions are consistent with those reported by Scilley et
al,34 who found that persons with early AMD are more likely
to experience difficulty driving and to have trouble with daily
tasksthatinvolvenearandfarvisionthanpeoplewithoutAMD.
Overall, the differences in HRQoL scores between per-
sonswithunilateralandbilateralmoderatelevelsofAMD(with
large drusen and RPE depigmentation) were the largest and
most substantial across the spectrum of AMD severity in our
study.7,9,10 A number of studies5,9,32 have found lower HRQoL
scores in patients with bilateral AMD, especially in the late
stages, compared with patients with unilateral disease. Mod-
erate macular degeneration of one eye is compensated for by
thebettereye,allowingindividualswithunilateralAMDtosus-
tain a relatively good HRQoL.5,9,32 The detrimental effect of bi-
lateral eye disease had also been observed in other ocular con-
ditions in the LALES population.35-37
The lower scores in the HRQoL scales, such as driving dif-
ficulty, near vision, and distant vision, can be explained by the
decrease in visual acuity and impaired contrast sensitivity of
those with advanced AMD. Although visual acuity is not af-
fected in early AMD, empirical evidence suggests that con-
trast sensitivity is associated with early AMD,38-40 resulting in
reduced visual function. Specifically, scotopic dysfunction is
a marker of early AMD in some studies.34,40
These results suggest that participants with bilateral large
drusen and depigmentation had the most substantial de-
crease in HRQoL despite the fact that visual acuity might not
be affected at this stage. Given that most treatment focuses on
advanced AMD, the development of strategies to prevent bi-
lateral progression would offer the most potential benefit for
patient HRQoL and satisfaction, which also highlights the im-
portance of assessing patient-reported outcomes, such as
HRQoL. Objective measurements, such as visual acuity, may
not adequately characterize the total effect of an ocular con-
dition on a patient. Therefore, HRQoL instruments are increas-
ingly being used to assess patient’
s overall perception of rela-
tivewell-being,evenasatooltoevaluatetreatmentefficacies.41
In this analysis, we found no negative association of AMD
with general measures of HRQoL as assessed by the SF-12 PCS
and MCS scores. These findings are consistent with other
studies8,9 that found these instruments not to be sensitive to
oculardisease,includingAMD.Studies35-37withtheLALESdata
on other ocular conditions also reported similar low respon-
siveness. Patients with AMD or other ocular disease may

otherwise be considerably healthy. Therefore, general mea-
sures of health status might not be sensitive to capture diffi-
cultyinvisualfunctioningthatresultsfromocularconditions.8,9
The current analysis has several strengths. It was per-
formed on a large population-based sample with adequate sta-
tistical power to study different phenotypes, especially the
early AMD lesions. Use of a standardized protocol for objec-
tive measurement and grading of AMD cases minimized the
chance of measurement error.13,19 Although HRQoL is a self-
reported patient outcome, we used measures of HRQoL that
have been validated in different populations (including His-
panics) and for different ocular conditions, including
AMD.9,27,42 This instrument has also been used previously for
the LALES population.35-37,42-44
The common concern of the potential effect of the par-
ticipant’
s knowledge of having AMD on the responses to the
HRQoL questionnaire was not likely to be an issue in this study
because the HRQoL interview was completed before AMD was
graded and ascertained. Although our overall sample of AMD
was large compared with previous studies,2,6,9,32,33 we did not
have a large number of participants with late AMD. The use of
cross-sectional data limited our ability to make conclusions on
the effect of longitudinal changes in AMD on HRQoL. Be-
cause our study focused primarily on the adult Latino popu-
lation in Los Angeles County, our findings may not be gener-
alizable to the entire adult US population or US Latinos.
Conclusions
In this cohort of Latinos, patients with AMD reported worse
HRQoL. We observed a strong inverse association between

Invited Commentary
Development, Use, and Interpretation of Patient-Reported
Outcomes for Clinical Decision Making in Ophthalmology
Päivi H. Miskala, PhD
The US Food and Drug Administration published a draft
guidance document in 2006, which was finalized in 2009,
that established the regulatory standards for development,
validation, and use of patient-reported outcome (PRO)
measures to support medi-
cal product–labeling claims
regarding treatment benefit
(ie, efficacy or comparative safety).1 The principles outlined
in this document represent the best practices in the field;
however, the requirement to provide evidence to support
validity and reliability of PROs in the regulatory context rep-
resented a substantial change. This document has increased
the scientific rigor of patient reports, which are being used
as a primary basis for regulatory approval of medical prod-
ucts in some therapeutic areas (eg, some gastrointestinal
diseases). In other therapeutic areas, such as oncology,
there has been an increasing trend to consider the patient
perspective in evaluation of medical products (eg, symp-
toms of myelofibrosis,2 pain in prostate cancer3). The
framework outlined in the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion guidance document can also be applied more broadly
to other types of clinical outcome assessments, including
observer-based assessments and physician rating scales.
Requiring evidence to support validity and reliability of
physician rating scales in the regulatory context may well be
the next frontier to be tackled across therapeutic areas.
