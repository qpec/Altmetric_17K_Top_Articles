ABSTRACT
Low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) diets are a highly
contentious current topic in nutrition. This narrative
review aims to provide clinicians with a broad overview
of the effects of LCHF diets on body weight, glycaemic
control and cardiovascular risk factors while addressing
some common concerns and misconceptions. Blood total
cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations show a
variable, highly individual response to LCHF diets, and
should be monitored in patients adhering to this diet. In
contrast, available evidence from clinical and preclinical
studies indicates that LCHF diets consistently improve all
other markers of cardiovascular risk—lowering elevated
blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, ApoB and saturated
fat (especially palmitoleic acid) concentrations, reducing
small dense LDL particle numbers, glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c) levels, blood pressure and body weight while
increasing low HDL-cholesterol concentrations and
reversing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This
particular combination of favourable modifications to all
these risk factors is a benefit unique to LCHF diets.
These effects are likely due in part to reduced hunger
and decreased ad libitum calorie intake common to low-
carbohydrate diets, allied to a reduction in
hyperinsulinaemia, and reversal of NAFLD. Although
LCHF diets may not be suitable for everyone, available
evidence shows this eating plan to be a safe and
efficacious dietary option to be considered. LCHF diets
may also be particularly beneficial in patients with
atherogenic dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and the
frequently associated NAFLD.
INTRODUCTION
Imagine a obese (BMI=32 kg/m2) woman aged 57
years with other evidence for insulin resistance (IR),
including hyperinsulinaemia and impaired glucose
tolerance together with atherogenic dyslipidaemia
(AD) (triglyceride (TG)=340 mg/dL (8.8 mmol/L),
HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C)=42.4 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L),
LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C)=195 mg/dL (5.05 mmol/L))
who enters her family physician’s office. Frustrated
with her poor health and progressive weight gain,
on the advice of a friend, she has decided to begin a
low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) Atkins-type diet.
How should her physician respond? What evidence
does the physician require to make an informed
decision?
LCHF diets have polarised the opinions of
medical caregivers, especially since the publication
of Dr Atkins’ Diet Revolution in 1972.1 Some
believe that these diets effectively treat type 2 dia-
betes mellitus (T2DM), obesity and metabolic syn-
drome.2 3 Others consider them to be simply a fad4
in conflict with current globally accepted dietary
guidelines that advocate low-fat high-carbohydrate
(LFHC) diets to reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease.5
6 Faced with such conflicting opinions,
the clinician may be unsure how to advise this or
other similar patients. Here, we provide an updated
narrative review of the large body of published evi-
dence describing the physiological effects, efficacy
and safety of LCHF diets for the management,
especially of this type of patient characterised by IR
and AD.
A number of systematic reviews have compared
the effects of LCHF diets, traditional LFHC diets
and other dietary strategies7–13 on body weight
control and cardiovascular risk factors. Collectively,
they establish that, for weight loss, LCHF diets are
just as effective, if not more so, than LFHC
diets.9 14–16 They also highlight a number of signifi-
cant changes to cardiovascular risk factors in parti-
cipants adhering to LCHF diets.10
14
17 The
strength of these reviews is their systematic research
strategy and meta-analysis of data to answer specific
research questions. However, this strength limits
their relevance to their defined question, not allow-
ing a broader overview of the evidence for meta-
bolic, physiological and other effects of LCHF
diets.
The aim of this review is not to argue whether
LCHF diets are superior to other dietary strategies
for any specific health outcome. Rather, we synthe-
sise the evidence for the effects of LCHF diets on
weight loss, glycaemic control, modification of car-
diovascular risk factors as well as non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its associated AD.
Further, we address common concerns sometimes
presented as reasons why LCHF diets should not
be prescribed to any patient. Through this process,
we hope to provide clinicians with additional evi-
dence to inform their clinical decision-making,
better to understand the potential benefits of these
eating plans for at least some patients.
DEFINITIONS
Though definitions of LCHF diets differ, the fol-
lowing three-tiered definition will be used in this
paper.2
▸ Moderate carbohydrate diet (26–45% of daily
kcal)
▸ LCHF diet (<26% of total energy intake or
<130 g CHO/day)
▸ Very LCHF (ketogenic) diet (20–50 g CHO/day
or <10% of daily kcal of 2000 kcal/day diet)
Reduced carbohydrate diets are those that have
carbohydrate intakes below the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans (DGA) recommendations (of 45–
65% of total energy intake). However, we define
LCHF diets as those that restrict carbohydrate
intake to 130 g/day or less. Very LCHF (ketogenic)

 diets may induce ketosis in some people. Though individual
responses vary, ketosis usually occurs in people who restrict
their carbohydrate intake to below 20–50 g/day with some
degree of protein restriction.
Since the carbohydrate content of the diet is significantly
reduced, the relative proportion of energy derived from protein
and fat will increase. In practice, however, LCHF diets typically
produce a reduction in hunger,18 with the result that the indivi-
dual’s total caloric consumption will usually decrease on the
LCHF diet, sometimes significantly. Therefore, even though the
relative contribution of fat to dietary energy intake may
increase, the absolute fat intake may not. As a result, the term
‘high fat’ diet may be misleading. Hence, the term low-
carbohydrate healthy fat is probably more appropriate.
WHAT FOODS ARE PRESCRIBED ON THE LCHF DIET
LCHF diets are defined by what is ‘not’ eaten, instead of what is
eaten. Although the details may vary depending on the specific
type of LCHF diets (Atkins, Banting, Paleo, South Beach, etc),
in each of these examples, there is a consistent focus on eating
unprocessed food, consisting primarily of cruciferous and green
leafy vegetables, raw nuts and seeds, eggs, fish, unprocessed
animal meats, dairy products and natural plant oils and fats
from avocados, coconuts and olives.
LCHF diets, even if ketogenic, are not ‘no’ carbohydrate
diets. Rather, all encourage a high intake of green leafy vegeta-
bles, cruciferous vegetables and other non-starchy vegetables
with moderate intakes of berries. Table 1 provides a list of foods
recommended on a ‘Banting’ diet,19 a popular LCHF eating
plan. LCHF eating plans promote meals such as omelettes,
salads and animal protein such as steak, salmon or chicken with
vegetables.19
LCHF DIETS AND WEIGHT LOSS
Obesity is the fifth leading risk factor for premature mortality.20
The prescription of the LCHF diet as one strategy for weight
loss has been known since at least 1860,21 as this particular
eating plan was promoted as the preferred treatment for obesity
in Sir William Osler’s textbook from the early 1900s.22 The
publication of Dr Atkin’s Diet Revolution in 19721 later resur-
rected interest in the LCHF diet in the USA and elsewhere. Four
decades later, numerous randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and
systematic reviews now allow a critical evaluation of the safety
and efficacy of LCHF diets for weight reduction. This informa-
tion was not available to either Osler or Atkins, making a
review of this new evidence particularly opportune now.
Repeatedly, LCHF diets have performed as well or better
than LFHC diets for weight loss in overweight or obese
adults.9 14–17 Bazzano et al’s23 recent 1-year trial randomised
148 obese men and women without T2DM or cardiovascular
disease to an ad libitum LFHC (<30% fat, <7% saturated fat,
55% carbohydrates) or an LCHF (<40 g carbohydrates/day)
diet. After 12 months, the LCHF diet group had lost signifi-
cantly (p=0.002) more weight (−5.3 kg) than the LFHC group
(−1.8 kg), and experienced a 1.3% decrease in % body fat com-
pared with a 0.3% gain in the LFHC group. This equivalent or
superior performance of LCHF diets over LFHC diets for
weight loss has also been established in randomised trials in ado-
lescents,24–26 and in adults with,27–29 or without30–35 T2DM. A
recent reanalysis (‘The universities of Stellenbosch/Cape Town
low-carbohydrate diet review: Mistake or mischief?’35a) shows
that lower carbohydrate diets outperform isoenergetic high
carbohydrate ‘balanced’ diets for weight loss of the systematic
analysis comparing weight loss and the response of other health
markers with isocaloric high and moderate (35%) carbohydrate
diets7 found that weight loss was slightly but significantly
greater on the moderate carbohydrate diet, even though the
diets were isoenergetic.
The efficacy of LCHF diets extends beyond weight loss. In a
24-week trial of 84 patients with T2DM, W
estman et al36 found
that a ketogenic LCHF diet produced significantly greater
weight
loss than
an
energy-restricted
(500 kcal/day
below
RMR), low glycaemic (GI) diet (−11.1 vs −6.9 kg). The keto-
genic LCHF diet also significantly increased blood HDL-C con-
centrations and reduced blood HbA1c values. Additionally, more
patients on the LCHF diet were able to reduce or cease their
use of diabetic medications.
The 1-year A to Z study37 randomised 311 overweight/obese
premenopausal women to the Atkins (<20 g carbohydrates/day
induction, <50 g carbohydrates/day maintenance, ad libitum
energy intake), Zone (40% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 30%
fat, energy restricted), Ornish (<10% fat, ad libitum) or
LEARN (55–60% carbohydrate, 10% saturated fat, energy
restricted) diets. After 12 months, the mean weight loss in the
LCHF Atkins group was −4.7 kg, compared with −1.6 kg on
the Zone Diet, −2.2 kg on the Ornish and −2.6 kg on the
LEARN groups. Further, blood HDL-C and TG concentrations
were significantly improved in the Atkins group compared with
all other diet groups, at least initially.
Shai et al38 randomised 322 moderately obese participants to
an
energy
restricted
Mediterranean
diet
(MED),
energy-restricted LFHC diet or an ad libitum LCHF diet. The
most significant weight loss occurred in the LCHF group at
6 months, even though this was the only diet eaten ad libitum—
that is, it was not energy-restricted. At the end of the 24-month
trial, weight loss was −4.7 kg for LCHF, −4.4 for MED and
−2.9 kg for LFHC participants. W
eight loss on the LCHF diet is
greatest early in these trials when participants comply most rigor-
ously to the carbohydrate restrictions, as also occurred at
6 months in the A to Z trial.37 Subsequent weight gain occurs as
participants begin to ingest more carbohydrates daily, so-called
‘carbohydrate creep’, seen in the 6–12-month period in that trial
and between months 6 and 24 in the study of Shai et al.38
Obviously, this reintroduction of greater carbohydrate ingestion
increases energy intake with consequent weight regain. Thus,
weight regain is not necessarily the fault of the LCHF diet; rather
it is the consequence of its discontinuation.
This applies to all dietary interventions, where weight regain
occurs with decreased adherence. Conversely, motivated free-
living individuals who maintain diet adherence, sometimes to
address serious personal medical conditions, self-report weight
losses an order of magnitude greater than the rather modest

 weight losses measured in clinical trials. LCHF diets are no
exception, where some have reported effortless weight losses of
greater than −80 kg following adoption of the LCHF diet.39
Indeed,
a
recently
reported
low-cost
lifestyle
intervention
study40 based on a high-fat diet recorded weight losses in excess
of 12% in 372 participants; exceeding typical losses of 3–7% in
other well-funded studies in which the chosen diets were higher
in carbohydrate.
In summary, while some studies show no difference in weight
losses between LFHC and LCHF diets,7 8 11 others report that
LCHF diets are more effective.9 14–17 35a Notably, all the tested
diets are effective at inducing at least short-term weight loss,
usually followed by some weight regain as adherence diminishes.
However, LCHF diets clearly perform at least as well as do any
other dietary approach, even in trials in which energy intake on
the LCHF diet is unrestricted (ad libitum).
Mechanisms for successful weight loss on the LCHF eating
plan
T
wo main mechanisms have been proposed to explain how
LCHF diets produce weight loss, despite an increased consump-
tion of energy-dense ‘fatty’ foods:
1. increased satiety, allowing a lower energy intake without
hunger and
2. a specific metabolic advantage.
Increased satiety allowing a lower energy intake without
hunger
A recent systematic review compared weight loss between parti-
cipants on ‘LCHF diets’ and ‘low fat balanced diets’7 but
excluded all trials that were not isoenergetic. However, in doing
so, they excluded trials that demonstrate the advantage of
LCHF diets in producing greater satiety and a subsequently
reduced energy intake. Indeed, this was the unique biological
advantage that Banting,21 Ebstein41 and Atkins1 all originally
ascribed to the LCHF diet on the basis of their clinical observa-
tions. Although the original study did not find any differences
in weight loss between the different diets, a reanalysis35a of the
same data found a small but significantly great weight loss on
the lower carbohydrate diet.
As an illustration, table 2 lists a collection of studies which
show that participants on LCHF diets given unrestricted access
to eating foods ad libitum do not necessarily consume more cal-
ories than participants assigned to LFHC diets, even when the
latter are required consciously to ‘energy restrict’ their caloric
intake according to their experimental design.
These results are supported by lower measures of perceived
hunger in some participants eating LCHF diets.34 Greater
satiety on LCHF diets in persons responding to the diet may
result from a number of mechanisms: (1) some LCHF diets may
have increased protein intake, which promotes satiety;43 (2)
ketogenic LCHF diets may also suppress appetite,44 though the
exact mechanisms remain uncertain;45 and (3) participants may
experience
fewer
instances
of
rebound
hypoglycaemia,
a
common cause of hunger in those eating high-carbohydrate
foods,46 especially if they are IR. Regardless of the exact mech-
anism, it is notable that LCHF diets can achieve an energy
deficit and subsequent weight loss with little hunger and
without conscious energy restriction, as originally noted by
Stock and Yudkin.18
Postulated ‘metabolic advantage’ of LCHF diets
The superior satiating effects of LCHF diets may not fully
explain weight losses from LCHF diets. For example, some
trials have shown greater weight loss for LCHF diets, despite
higher energy intakes than prescribed LFHC diets.3 25 31 47
Similarly, although some trials find no differences,48 some isoe-
nergetic
trials
still
find
greater
weight
losses
on
LCHF
diets.33

variable
outcomes.7 50
Although contentious, it has been suggested that LCHF diets
may provide a metabolic ‘advantage’ favouring greater weight
loss, despite the ingestion of an equal number of calories. This
metabolic advantage could be attributed to a number of
mechanisms, including: (1) increased thermogenic effects of
protein intake, (2) greater protein turnover for gluconeogenesis
and (3) loss of energy through excretion of ketones in sweat or
urine.51 52
LCHF diets increase reliance on fat oxidation for energy pro-
duction, especially during exercise,53 54 as shown by increased
blood ketone concentrations and with reductions in respiratory
quotient and blood insulin concentrations.53–55 This state of
increased lipolysis with reduced lipogenesis contributes to a
metabolic milieu theoretically favouring fat loss. This effect is
dependent on reduced blood insulin concentrations, uniquely
produced by the LCHF diet. However, this remains a conten-
tious idea, with recent metabolic ward evidence suggesting that,
at least in the short term (5 days), there is not a preferential
fat-loss effect of LCHF diets.56
LCHF DIETS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM
T2DM is primarily a condition of IR, with persistent hypergly-
caemia as a result of excessive hepatic glucose production57 as
its defining characteristic. Of all the macronutrients, carbohy-
drates cause the greatest and most prolonged increases in blood
glucose and insulin concentrations.58 It is therefore no surprise

 that prior to the discovery of insulin, carbohydrate restriction,
often associated with fasting or even starvation, was the eating
plan prescribed for all diabetic patients regardless of type (1 or
2).59 Today, LCHF diets are again being discussed as a potential
first-line treatment for T2DM.2 60 61
In a 24-week trial, 363 overweight and obese patients chose
according to their preference, to follow either a ketogenic
LCHF diet or a ‘low calorie, high nutritional value’ diet. In the
102 patients with T2DM, weight loss was significantly greater
(−12.0% vs −7.0%) and HbA1c and fasting blood glucose con-
centrations decreased significantly more with the LCHF diet.62
A 3-month trial27 randomised 34 prediabetic or T2DM
patients to a calorie-restricted diet consistent with American
Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines or an ad libitum very
LCHF diet. The very LCHF group showed a significant reduc-
tion (6.6–6.0%) in HbA1c values compared with unchanged
values (6.9% at baseline and follow-up) in the ADA group. This
change in HbA1c values indicated a strong effect size (d=−1.8),
and occurred even though significantly more participants in the
very low LCHF group decreased their use of diabetic medica-
tions. The very low LCHF group also lost more weight (−5.5 vs
−2.6 kg). Similar results were seen in W
estman et al’s36 24-week
trial also comparing a very low LCHF diet with a low GI diet.
Participants on the very LCHF diet experienced significantly
greater decreases in HbA1c (−1.5% vs −0.5%, p=0.03), even
though a greater percentage of patients (95% vs 62% of low GI
participants)
reduced
or
stopped
taking
their
diabetic
medications.
The recent study of Tay et al63 randomised 115 obese adults
with T2DM to either LCHF or LFHC diets for 1 year.
Although both diets achieved substantial weight loss and
reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose concentrations, the LCHF
diet produced greater improvements in blood glucose stability
and superior reductions in diabetes medication requirements. In
addition, the LCHF diet produced larger increases in HDL chol-
esterol concentrations and greater reductions in TG concentra-
tions without changing total or LDL cholesterol concentrations.
The recently reported lifestyle intervention trial40 which pre-
scribed a high-fat diet for weight maintenance also produced
these beneficial changes while LDL-cholesterol concentrations
also fell substantially.
W
eight loss on any diet improves glycaemic control, so it may
be assumed that positive changes with an LCHF diet are attrib-
utable to concomitant weight loss. However, it should be noted
that carbohydrate restriction positively influences glycaemic
control even in the absence of weight loss.64 65
LCHF DIETS AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS
A common concern expressed by physicians, especially cardiolo-
gists, is that any increased dietary fat intake on the LCHF diet
will increase the risk for the future development of cardiovascu-
lar disease. This conviction stems largely from Ancel Keys’ ori-
ginal seven countries study,66 and the subsequent development
of the LFHC dietary guidelines to prevent cardiovascular
disease.67 68 However, evidence from numerous RCTs indicate
that LCHF diets consistently produce more favourable changes
in many measures of cardiovascular risk than do LFHC diets.
This applies especially in persons with IR, T2DM, AD and
NAFLD.
Examination of blood lipid concentrations in RCTs reveals
that LCHF diets have a potent effect in lowering blood TG con-
centrations,69 to a significantly greater degree than do LFHC
diets.3 32 70 71 Blood ApoB concentrations—an indirect measure
of lipoprotein particle numbers and also a risk predictor for
coronary artery disease—also decrease more on LCHF than on
the LFHC diet.3 72
Furthermore, of all dietary interventions, none increase
HDL-C concentrations as effectively as do LCHF diets, which
outperform LFHC,23
35
70 low glycaemic index,73 Zone,
LEARN, Ornish37 and in some cases, MEDs.38 After a 1-year
isocaloric intervention comparing a very LCHF with an LFHC
diet, Tay et al70 found greater decreases in blood TG concentra-
tions (−0.58 vs −0.22 mmol/L) and greater increases in HDL-C
concentrations (+0.30 vs +0.07 mmol/L) in participants on the
LCHF diet, despite similar weight losses. Since a high TG to
HDL-C ratio predicts extensive coronary artery disease,74 and is
common in patients with IR and NAFLD, the long-term benefits
of this unique capacity of LCHF diets markedly to alter both
markers should not be underestimated.
On the other hand, a common argument against the LCHF
eating plan is the variable LDL-C response to a relative or abso-
lute increase in dietary fat intake. Many trials demonstrate a
decrease or insignificant change in LDL-C concentrations in
response to the LCHF diet,75
76 but some report a more
marked increase.77 Although HDL-C concentrations increased
and TG concentrations decreased significantly more in partici-
pants on the LCHF diet in the study of Tay et al,70 LDL-C
(+0.6
vs
+0.1 mmol/L)
and
total
cholesterol
(+0.7
vs
+0.1 mmol/L) concentrations increased significantly more in
participants in that group.
Systematic reviews confirm these findings. Table 3 shows that
LCHF
diets
significantly
increase
HDL-C
concentrations,
decrease TG concentrations and weight, without any significant
effects on LDL-C concentrations.14 Hu et al11 also documented
greater improvements in TG and HDL-C concentrations in
response to LCHF compared with LFHC diets, but total choles-
terol and LDL-C concentrations fell significantly more in partici-
pants on the LFHC diets.
When assessing the relevance of any increase in total choles-
terol concentrations produced by the LCHF diet, the other
beneficial metabolic effects specific to LCHF diets must be con-
sidered (table 3).76 78 79 First, the LCHF-induced increase in
HDL-C concentrations is considered protective against cardio-
vascular disease.80 In contrast, LFHC diets do not produce an
equivalent HDL-C-raising effect and may in fact cause HDL-C
concentrations to fall,72 a potentially detrimental effect.
Second, considering changes in LDL-C concentrations in iso-
lation fail to acknowledge the importance of changes in particle
subfraction distributions, specifically the atherogenic effects of

 small, dense LDL particles, compared with the relatively neutral
effect of large, buoyant LDL particles.81
As serum TG concentrations are inversely related to the
number of small dense LDL particles,82 83 the LCHF-induced
decrease in blood TG concentrations indicates a less atherogenic
distribution of these LDL particle subfractions. Indeed, LCHF
diets consistently reduce the proportion of small, dense LDL
particles while increasing the number of large, buoyant LDL
particles.3 30 72 75 84 85
Third, an apparent LDL-C-raising effect of the LCHF diet may
be an artefact if LDL-C concentrations are predicted from mea-
surements of total cholesterol, HDL-C and TG concentrations
using the Friedewald equation. Even when all other measure-
ments are unchanged, that equation will predict an increase in
(unmeasured) LDL-C concentrations whenever blood TG con-
centrations fall, as happens in persons eating LCHF diets.
Indeed, LDL-C concentrations predicted by the Friedewald equa-
tion becoming increasingly inaccurate at low blood TG concen-
trations,86 a typical response in persons eating the LCHF diet.
Fourth, the biological significance of these relatively small
increases in LDL-C is unknown in persons eating LCHF diets
and in whom there will be associated increases in LDL particle
size distributions and reductions in harmful blood saturated fat
concentrations,72 87 as well as other positive biological changes,
including reduced ApoB concentrations,3 72 improvements in
flow-mediated arteriolar dilation,71 decreased inflammatory bio-
markers,49
lower

improved
glycaemic
control
with
reduced
HbA1c,
plasma
glucose and insulin concentrations14 and preferential weight loss
from the abdominal viscera indicating a greater reduction in vis-
ceral fat, including liver fat. All these changes in surrogate mea-
sures
would
be
expected
to
reduce
cardiovascular
risk
substantially.3 47
Indeed, another unique effect of the LCHF diet is to reverse
NAFLD, particularly in those with IR and AD.
Nonetheless, the variability in LDL-C response to the CHF
diet must be considered and markers of IR and AD should be
monitored in patients who adopt this eating pattern.
NAFLD, AD AND LCHF
Cardiovascular
disease
is
the
leading
cause
of
death
in
NAFLD,88 a condition causing elevated TG and low HDL-C
concentrations with overproduction of very-low density lipopro-
teins and impaired clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins.89
90
Hepatic IR is also increased in persons with fatty liver91 as
shown by inadequate suppression of hepatic glucose production
by insulin in NAFLD.92
Recently, Bril et al91 have shown that NAFLD with IR is the
cause of the AD characterised by all these features, including
increased small dense LDL particle numbers (Pattern B).
Since NAFLD is caused by excessive carbohydrate, especially
fructose intake,93–95 the finding that a carbohydrate-restricted
LCHF diet can reverse AD (previous section) is more readily
explained. The LCHF diet reverses the NAFLD and hence the
AD that it causes.
In contrast, stepwise increases in carbohydrate intake ‘is asso-
ciated with incremental increases in the proportion of plasma
palmitoleic acid, which may be signalling impaired metabolism
of carbohydrate, even under conditions of negative energy
balance and significant weight loss. These findings contradict
the perspective that dietary saturated fat per se is harmful, and
underscore the importance of considering the level of dietary
carbohydrate that accompanies saturated fat consumption’.87
In summary, while the response of blood LDL-C concentra-
tions to LCHF diets may be variable, rising in some, simultan-
eous changes in many other blood markers suggest that this
eating plan enhances cardiovascular health. Specifically, patients
with high TG to HDL-C ratios and NAFLD, all of which are
common in IR individuals eating LFHC diets, are more likely to
benefit from the LCHF diet. Indeed, a recent lifestyle interven-
tion trial reduced the prevalence of metabolic syndrome from
58% to 19% among obese and overweight patients treated with
LCHF for as little as 3–8 months, indicating how rapidly carbo-
hydrate restriction can improve health in those with IR.40
ADDRESSING COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS
W
e next address some of the common concerns and misconcep-
tions that are frequently raised by medical colleagues who are
hesitant to prescribe LCHF diets for their patients.
Is not ketosis a dangerous physiological state?
A common error is to confuse nutritional ketosis with diabetic
ketoacidosis. While the latter is life-threatening, nutritional
ketosis is a normal physiological response to dietary carbohy-
drate restriction, in which the body alters its primary fuel utilisa-
tion from carbohydrates to fat. This change spares blood
glucose for use particularly by the brain which has an obligatory
glucose requirement of about 25 g/day,96 when using alternative
fuels including ketones or lactate in fat-adapted persons.54
Carbohydrate restriction increases the production of ketone
bodies (acetoacetate, β-hydroxybuterate and acetone) by the
liver.97 Ketosis occurs in the neonatal period98 during fasting
and pregnancy, and in response to carbohydrate restriction.99 In
adults consuming a ‘normal’ diet, blood ketone body concentra-
tions vary between 0.1 and 0.3 mmol/L. In nutritional ketosis,
the levels may rise to over 1 mmol/L, and maximally up to 7–
8 mmol/L but without an acidosis. In contrast, in diabetic ketoa-
cidosis,
blood
ketone
body
concentrations
usually
exceed
25 mmol/L and blood pH decreases below 7.3.97
Existing evidence shows that not only is nutritional ketosis
safe, but is also beneficial to many patients.76 Potential thera-
peutic uses for nutritional ketosis that have been suggested
include the management of cancer, acne, polycystic ovarian syn-
drome
and
neurological
diseases,
including
Alzheimer’s
disease.97 More recent evidence suggest that ketones including
those ingested orally during exercise may produce beneficial
metabolic effects100 and enhance athletic performance.101
The dangers of high intakes of fat, saturated fat and
protein
As LCHF diets promote an increased relative or absolute energy
intake from fats and proteins, concerns are often expressed
about the potential dangers of the increased consumption of
these macronutrients.
As
first
demonstrated
in
1970,18
and
repeatedly
since,29 37 49 102 a reduction in dietary carbohydrate intake does
not necessarily cause a concomitant increase in total fat and
protein intakes. Though the proportional amounts of energy
supplied from fat and protein must increase, the absolute
amounts often remain very similar, as total energy intake often
decreases on LCHF diets. Nevertheless, it is this absolute or
relative increase in fat intake that causes the greatest anxiety
among medical colleagues.
The diet heart hypothesis based largely on Ancel Keys’ ori-
ginal Seven Countries Study66 posits that saturated fat intake is
the direct cause of coronary atherosclerosis. However, this
theory is not supported by either the historical evidence or by

Br J Sports Med: first published as 10.1136/bjsports-2016-096491 on 4 January 2017. Downloaded from 
 more recent epidemiological data,103–113 which finds no associ-
ation between saturated fat intake and all-cause mortality or
progression of coronary atherosclerosis.114 Instead, higher fat
intakes have been associated with lower rates of ischaemic
stroke in men.115 Indeed, a continued decline in coronary mor-
tality in the Japanese is associated with increasing blood choles-
terol concentrations116 and increased fat intakes.117 Similarly,
higher blood cholesterol concentrations are not associated with
increased mortality after age 60. Given the sometimes dramatic
improvements
in
coronary
risk
factors
on
the
LCHF
diet,39 40 76 79 the fear of ill health effects from the increased
(saturated) fat intake on the LCHF diet would appear to be
groundless.
Instead, concerns may be expressed about the claimed benefits
of replacing saturated fats with dietary polyunsaturated fats as
these claims may be unproven118–122 and the effect of this sub-
stitution may even be harmful.122 123 Rather epidemiological
studies showing either a weak124
125 or no126 association
between the intake of red meat, especially processed red meat
and an increased colon cancer risk have raised concerns.
However, there is no evidence that the intake of moderate
amounts of red meat has detrimental effects on conventional
coronary risk factors.127 128
As with fat intake, total protein intake does not necessarily
increase on an LCHF diet. Further, many LCHF diets are not high
in protein; instead, they are relatively or absolutely high in fat.
Regardless, no negative renal effects of an increased protein intake
have been described in those with normal kidney function,129 130
including obese adults with T2DM with no pre-existing kidney
disease.131 However, patients with renal dysfunction could theor-
etically be at risk of the hypertensive effects associated with higher
protein intakes and warrant additional consideration.97 Finally
, it
should be noted that T2DM is the disease most responsible for
renal failure and LCHF diets are an effective dietary strategy for
controlling and preventing T2DM.2 60
LCHF diets produce other dangerous effects
Headache, fatigue and muscle cramping are potential side
effects of very LCHF diets. However, these symptoms may be
especially prevalent only in the period of adaptation to the diet,
after which most subside. Some recommend that additional
sodium should be ingested to minimise side effects, since excre-
tion of water and sodium are increased on these diets.132
Nevertheless, it is advisable to monitor patients when they
begin the LCHF diet and to explain that these side effects are
almost always transient.
Lack of nutrient density
Nutrient density is primarily dependent on food quality, not
purely on macronutrient composition. Therefore, it is possible
to eat a nutrient-poor diet with any macronutrient composition.
However, an LCHF diet that focuses on unrefined food from
vegetables, meat, dairy and seeds/nuts provides a diet that is
nutrient-dense, supplying all the essential nutrients. A large
online survey of LCHF dieters found that most replaced trad-
itional, refined nutrient-poor carbohydrate sources such as
bread and pasta with an increased green leafy vegetable con-
sumption, producing an improvement in nutrient density.133
Weight loss on LCHF diets occurs via increased water loss
Some suggest that the weight loss on LCHF diets is the result
mainly of water loss. Indeed, increased diuresis accounts for
some of the weight loss experienced in the first weeks of carbo-
hydrate
restriction.134
However,
measurements
of
body
composition by DEXA analysis clearly indicate that long-term
weight loss on the LCHF diet is predominantly the result of the
loss of fat mass with some loss of fat-free mass.3 Certainly,
weight losses of 10 kg or more, seen in trials40
62
76 and
common in self-reports,39 cannot be due to water loss alone.
The LCHF diet is unsustainable
Trials show that adherence to LCHF and LFHC diets are
similar,24 27 37 while a recent systematic review found a higher
attrition rate from LFHC than from LCHF diets.12 Therefore, it
appears that patients find it no more difficult to adhere to an
LCHF diet than any other dietary strategy. In fact, due to their
unique capacity to reduce hunger,34 some patients may find
LCHF diets to be more easily sustainable than LFHC diets
which require conscious calorie restriction. Importantly, long-
term adherence (6 months to >1 year)76 79 to the LCHF has
not identified any evidence of harm.
LIMITATIONS OF THIS REVIEW
Separating the specific effects of carbohydrate restriction from
the effects of other components of the LCHF diet is challen-
ging. Individuals adopting the LCHF diet do not just change the
macronutrient composition of their diets but may improve the
quality of food they eat, moving from processed and refined
foods to green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds and lean meats.
Further, an ad libitum LCHF diet is often accompanied by a
decreased
calorie
intake
and
subsequent
weight
loss.
Collectively, at least some (though not all) of the benefits of the
LCHF diet could stem from the often large weight losses typic-
ally produced by this diet. Therefore, at least some of the bene-
ficial changes reported here for the LCHF diet would also be
experienced
by
patients
prepared
to
adhere
to
any
calorie-restricted diet.
Though writing a narrative review allows a broad overview of
many aspects of LCHF diets, it is impossible to cover every
aspect of the diet or every relevant study. W
e have opted, where
possible, to focus on human trials, as well as systematic reviews
of these trials, acknowledging there are important areas of epi-
demiology, biochemistry, psychology, genomics and more that
could not be included.
SUMMARY AND CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS
One diet does not suit the individual metabolic profiles of
everyone. Significant weight loss has been documented in trials
comparing a variety of different dietary plans, with all diets per-
forming better than no intervention (controls).8 In all cases,
optimal nutrition should emphasise high nutrient density while
properly managing energy balance. As discussed in this review,
LCHF diets accomplish these two objectives effectively—con-
trolling energy balance through increased satiety and reduced ad
libitum energy intake while encouraging the ingestion of a
nutrient-dense diet by replacing refined, nutrient-poor processed
foods with nutrient-dense, natural foods. Further, the diet
encourages weight loss and unique metabolic changes including
marked improvements in glycaemic control and in plasma TG,
HDL-C, ApoB and saturated fat concentrations, with reductions
in the number of small dense LDL particles that are considered
to be especially atherogenic. This unique effect is in part due to
the reversal of NAFLD by carbohydrate restriction.
While the complex details of individual responses to many dif-
ferent dietary interventions still need to be explored, clinicians
can be reassured that LCHF diets are proven to be a safe and effi-
cacious strategy for weight loss and improved health outcomes
for many patients, but especially for those with IR, the metabolic

 syndrome,40 AD and NAFLD. Thus, LCHF diets may be the
ideal choice for patients who have struggled to lose weight on the
traditional LFHC diets; for those with IR, including hyperinsuli-
naemia, T2DM and NAFLD; and for those with AD charac-
terised by high blood TG and low HDL-C concentrations and
increased numbers of small dense LDL particles (Pattern B).
In practice, beneficial responses to any diet are entirely
dependent on the degree of patients’ adherence, so an LCHF
diet is only appropriate for those patients motivated to comply.
In these cases, clinicians can expect positive changes in a
number of cardiovascular risk factors, glycaemic control and
body composition.40 Simultaneously, they should monitor indi-
vidual LDL-C responses, and encourage a continued emphasis
on nutrient-rich choices, avoiding ultra-processed foods. Thus,
far from being a dietary fad, but not necessarily for everyone,
LCHF diets present a sensible dietary option for weight loss and
health improvement in certain patients, especially those charac-
terised by IR, AD and NAFLD.

What are the findings?
▸ Low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) diets are at least as
effective as other dietary strategies for reducing body
weight, with the additional advantage of increased satiety
and spontaneous reduction in energy intake.
▸ LCHF diets are an effective dietary strategy to improve
glycaemic control and reduce hyperinsulinaemia in type 2
diabetes mellitus and in otherwise healthy patients with
insulin resistance.
▸ LCHF diets have unique effects on blood lipid concentrations
and cardiovascular risk factors, characterised by decreased
blood TG, ApoB and saturated fat concentrations, reduced
small LDL particle numbers and increased HDL-C
concentrations. The effect on LDL-C concentrations is
variable.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
A growing understanding that obesity/hypertension/T2DM/non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease/atherogenic dyslipidemia and the
metabolic syndrome may all be substantially influenced by a
single over-riding environmental factor—a high carbohydrate
diet, acting on a single metabolic state, insulin resistance—will
revolutionise the medical and dietary management of these
conditions over the next decade. From our analysis, the LCHF
eating plan should become the default medical management
approach for all these conditions.
