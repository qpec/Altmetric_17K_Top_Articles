Abstract
In the early 2000’s in Europe and shortly thereafter in the USA, it was reported that “legal” forms 
of marijuana were being sold under the name K2 and/or Spice. Active ingredients in K2/Spice 
products were determined to be synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs), producing psychotropic actions 
via CB1 cannabinoid receptors, similar to those of Δ9-THC, the primary active constituent in 
marijuana. Often abused by adolescents and military personnel to elude detection in drug tests due 
to their lack of structural similarity to Δ9-THC, SCBs are falsely marketed as safe marijuana 
substitutes. Instead, SCBs are a highly structural diverse group of compounds, easily synthesized, 
which produce very dangerous adverse effects occurring by, as of yet, unknown mechanisms. 
Therefore, available evidence indicates that K2/Spice products are clearly not safe marijuana 
alternatives.

Synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs): Not simply fake marijuana
Synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs) are a growing class of highly potent, highly efficacious 
cannabinoid agonists that, until recently, have been falsely marketed as “safe” and “legal” 
alternatives to marijuana [1]. As early as 2004, SCBs were promoted by Internet retailers 
and European “head shops” as meditation potpourris and tropical incense products under 
names such as K2 and Spice [2]. It was not until late 2008 that K2/Spice products were 
investigated by the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction for their 
psychoactive properties [3, 4]. Upon analysis of these herbal mixtures, the synthetic 
cannabimimetics JWH-018 and CP 47,497-C8 were identified as the primary psychoactive

 components [1]. Since then, several structural classes of SCBs have quickly evolved and 
diversified to avoid forensic detection and legislative scheduling [1, 5]. Individual users have 
sought after SCBs to avoid detection in standardized drug testing as well as to achieve a 
more intense high than that associated with marijuana [3]. The purpose of this review is to 
summarize reported literature demonstrating that SCBs are neither similar nor suitable 
substitutes for marijuana and that use of these compounds can result in tolerance and 
dependence, as well as numerous other documented adverse, toxic and potentially fatal 
effects.
Evolution of Cannabinoid Nomenclature
The term “cannabinoid” originally referred to a number of structurally related C21 aromatic 
hydrocarbon compounds isolated from the Cannabis Sativa plant [6]. However, following 
characterization of Δ9-THC, the principal psychoactive constituent in cannabis [7], and 
cloning of cannabinoid receptors [8, 9], the term “cannabinoid” instead came to be 
associated with drugs sharing pharmacological profiles similar to Δ9-THC and exhibiting 
affinity for cannabinoid receptors, apart from any structurally similarity to compounds 
originally isolated from the cannabis plant [10]. Therefore, currently accepted nomenclature 
for “cannabinoids” are ligands that bind to and modulate the activity of cannabinoids 
receptors [11]. Cannabinoids are structurally diverse and range from compounds that are 
endogenously produced (endocannabinoids) [12], to plant-derived (phytocannabinoids) [13] 
and synthesized compounds (synthetic cannabinoids) [14]. This review will focus on the 
growing epidemic of synthetic cannabinoid abuse, sought primarily for agonist actions of 
these compounds at CB1 cannabinoid receptors [15].
History of emerging SCB abuse and progression of SCB structural 
scaffolds
Cannabis sativa, commonly known as marijuana, has had an extensive history of medicinal 
and recreational use dating back to 2600 BC [16]. It was not until 1965 that Dr. Raphael 
Mechoulam and colleagues discovered the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana, 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) [17]. Upon this finding, significant advancements were 
made in the cannabinoid field including the characterization of the endocannabinoid system 
and the identification and cloning of the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors [8, 9]. As 
cannabinoid research progressed, production of high affinity synthetic CB1 and CB2 
cannabinoid receptor ligands began to emerge. Alongside classic plant-derived 
phytocannabinoids, novel synthetic cannabinoid classes such as the aminoaklylindoles (e.g., 
WIN-55,212-2) and bicyclic cannabinoids (e.g., CP-55,940) contributed to the structural 
diversity of cannabinoid pharmacology [18, 19]. Questions of how structurally distinct 
molecules like Δ9-THC and WIN-55,212-2 bind to CB1 and CB2 cannbinoid receptors with 
high affinity led to the development of novel cannabimimetics by substituting the 
morpholino group of aminoalkylindoles with the C3 pentyl side chain of Δ9-THC [20]. 
Synthesis of pyrrole and indole-derived cannabinoids with the substituted n-pentyl group 
lead to the discovery of the high affinity, full CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist JWH-018 [1-
pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole] [21, 22].

 More than twenty years following the synthesis of JWH-018, over 150 SCBs have been 
identified [3]. Aside from the major chemical classes of SCBs, including classical 
cannabinoids, cyclohexyl-substituted phenols, naphthoylindols, and benzoylindoles, newer 
SCB structures such as tetramethylcyclopropylindoles, adamantoylindoles, indazole 
carboximides and quinolinyl esters have been popularized in K2/Spice products [5, 23] 
(Figure 1). While these SCBs have been advertised as “synthetic marijuana,” when 
compared to Δ9-THC, they are structurally heterologous. Of the five structural components 
that contribute to the high affinity and partial agonism of Δ9-THC at CB1 and CB2 
cannabinoid receptors — including the C3 side chain, phenolic hydroxyl, and three rings: 
aromatic A-ring, pyran B-ring, and the cyclohexenyl C-ring — only one of the 
pharmacophores are shared with SCBs, that being the C3 side chain [16]. Although SCBs 
are highly diverse molecules, primary structural motifs that comprise SCBs reveal common 
pharmacophores. These common pharmacophores include 1) an indole or indazole core, 2) 
an amide, ketone, or ester linker, 3) a ring consisting of a naphthyl, quinolinyl, adamantyl, 
tetramethylcyclopropyl moiety, and 4) a hydrophobic alkyl group attached to the nitrogen 
atom of the indole or indazole ring [5]. Many SCBs such as JWH-018, UR-144, AKB48, 
and PB-22 have also been subjected to the addition of molecular substituents like 
halogenation of corresponding alkyl chains and stacking of aromatic naphthoyl and indole 
groups in order to increase affinity and maximize in vivo cannabimimetic effects at CB1 
cannabinoid receptor [23, 24]. Continuous manipulation and modification of these 
compounds by clandestine laboratories has accelerated the evolution of unique and 
potentially toxic SCBs, while legislatures have been working vigorously to ban the active 
constituents in K2/Spice products [2].
Evidence of K2/Spice usage in the USA was first reported in 2009. However, it was not until 
late 2010 that the National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) — under the 
guidance of the USA Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) — reported tremendous 
spikes in K2/Spice product usage. As shown in Figure 1, the major SCBs found in seized 
K2/Spice products during 2010 were JWH-018, JWH-073 and CP-47,497. While actions 
were taken to have the naphthoylindole- and cyclohexylphenol-like analogues regulated by 
the DEA as Schedule I compounds (e.g., having no currently accepted medical use and thus 
illegal to possess, except for researchers with schedule I licenses), the new, chemically 
distinct SCBs UR-144, XLR-11 and AKB48 emerged on the market simultaneously and 
were not captured by these legislative actions. By July 9, 2012, legislation was able to 
permanently schedule the naphthoylindole- and cyclohexylphenol-like analogues under 1152 
FDASIA. Since then, two separate legislative cases, 78 FR 28735 (May 6, 2013) and 79 FR 
7577 (February 10, 2014), successfully resulted in the scheduling of numerous novel SCBs 
(e.g., UR-144, XLR-11, AKB48, AB-FUBINACA and PB-22) found in K2 products. 
Unfortunately, the development of novel SCBs has remained ahead of the legislative 
scheduling process and continues to diversify to escape coverage by existing laws and to 
elude forensic detection, with no apparent end in sight [2].

 THC, and their use results in a constellation of adverse effects that are distinct from, and 
markedly more toxic than, those produced by marijuana (Table 1). In particular, reports from 
a number of clinical case studies have documented markedly greater toxicity following acute 
use of K2/Spice than marijuana, across a broad number of organ/tissue systems, including 
gastrointestinal [1, 3, 25–27], neurological [3, 26, 28–42], cardiovascular [34, 36, 37, 43–46] 
and renal [47–49]. Furthermore, although development of dependence to marijuana is rare, 
chronic use of SCBs can lead to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal [50–52]. Most 
alarming, however, are reports that SCB abuse in some individuals can result in death [53]. 
Taken collectively, clinical cases reported in recent scientific literature clearly indicate that 
SCBs found in K2/Spice products are not simply safe or alternative forms of “synthetic 
marijuana”.
Distinct SCB toxicity in humans - issues for special concern
Pro-convulsant effects
Despite current interest in medical cannabis as a treatment for epilepsy and other seizure 
disorders (recently reviewed in [54], for example), the clinical literature is rife with reports 
of seizures and convulsions elicited by SCBs in humans ([44, 55–58]), and in one case, their 
exposed pets [59]. As may be expected from case reports, forensic determination of the 
specific SCBs responsible for these effects occurs only rarely, and the co-use of other drugs 
often confounds the causal attribution of these convulsant effects to SCBs. Nevertheless, 
controlled laboratory studies in animals have recently been performed and support the notion 
that high efficacy SCBs exhibit unexpected pro-convulsant effects. For example, the SCB 
AKB48 and its fluorinated analogue 5F-AKB48 [23] as well as the aminoalkylindoles 
JWH-015 and JWH-073 [60] all induced impaired visual, acoustic and tactile sensorimotor 
responses, convulsions, myoclonia and hyperreflexia in mice. Similarly, the 
aminoalkylindole SCBs JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-210, AM-2201 and JWH-167 all 
increased central nervous system excitability in a functional observation battery in mice, 
with JWH-018 being “especially active” in this regard [61]. Further characterization of the 
pro-convulsant effects of the SCBs is clearly warranted.
Pro-psychotic effects
SCBs are typically much more potent and efficacious than Δ9-THC at both CB1 and CB2 
cannabinoid receptors, suggesting a capacity to induce far more intense in vivo effects than 
cannabis. This is sometimes – but not always – the case. With regards to toxicity of 
cannabinoid agonists, epidemiological studies suggest that cannabis use, particularly in 
adolescence, increases risk for psychotic episodes later in life [62, 63], and preclinical 
studies have also demonstrated pro-psychotic effects of Δ9-THC in rodents treated during 
the adolescent period [64]. Alarmingly, reports of acute and lasting psychosis elicited by use 
of SCBs are rapidly accumulating in the clinical literature [4, 34, 35, 38, 50, 65–72], but the 
mechanism of psychosis remains poorly understood and no controlled studies have yet 
characterized the pro-psychotic effects of SCBs in humans. Even acute use of SCBs can 
elicit psychosis-like symptoms of paranoia, disorganized behavior, visual and auditory 
hallucinations, and suicidal thoughts which persist much longer than more typical 
cannabinoid effects of motor depression and anxiety [65]. Interestingly, SCBs induce these

 effects in users with previous histories of psychosis and schizophrenia, as well as in users 
with no previous morbidity. Pro-psychotic effects of the low-efficacy cannabinoid agonists 
Δ9-THC, dronabinol, and nabilone have been studied under controlled laboratory conditions 
in humans (reviewed by [73]); however, evidence for a causal relationship between SCB use 
and re-emergence of previous psychotic symptoms or induction of new-onset psychosis is 
hampered by the fact that the literature surrounding this topic consists entirely of case 
reports. Indeed, differences in patient assessment methods, the general lack of forensic 
confirmation of which exact SCB compound was used, the possible confound of co-use of 
SCBs with prescribed therapeutics or other drugs of abuse, and the potential for preexisting 
mental illness should give one pause in attributing a causative link between SCB exposure 
and psychosis.
SCB abuse liability, tolerance, dependence and withdrawal
Abuse liability
The “gold standard” for preclinical abuse liability testing is the intravenous self-
administration assay [74], where an animal subject within a modified cage or experimental 
chamber can self-inject a drug through a surgically-implanted venous catheter after a 
specific behavior has been emitted (typically a lever press or a nose poke; for more details of 
the procedure, see [75]). Thus, these studies directly assess the reinforcing effects of drugs. 
Importantly, not all drugs which are abused by humans maintain cointingent responding in 
laboratory species. For example, serotonergic hallucinogens are not reliably reinforcing in 
self-administration studies in laboratory animals [74], and the psychotropic effects of 
cannabinoids may be similar to those of the psychedelics. Thus, despite constant recreational 
use and abuse of cannabinoids throughout human history, the reinforcing effects of 
cannabinoids have not been widely investigated in laboratory animals. Some of the earliest 
studies on the reinforcing effects of cannabinoids failed to establish intravenous self-
administration of Δ9-THC in rhesus monkeys [76] or in rats [77]. In later years, attempts 
were made to compensate for the relatively slow-onset, long-lasting behavioral effects of 
existing cannabinoids by establishing self-administration procedures with widely spaced 
drug deliveries, but these efforts also failed to establish reliable responding maintained by 
either Δ9-THC or CP-55,940 [78], leading to the widespread perception that cannabinoids, 
like serotonergic hallucinogens, were simply ineffective in self-administration assays. 
However, it was eventually noted that these previous studies utilized intravenous unit doses 
which were higher than those calculated from human studies, perhaps indicating that the unit 
doses available for self-administration would be aversive to laboratory animals. Similarly, 
the lipophilic nature of Δ9-THC and its poor solubility in water suggested that the Δ9-THC 
solutions used were, at best, in suspension and therefore not likely to be biologically active. 
Indeed, the use of lower doses of Δ9-THC which clearly dissolve in solution, allowing the 
drug to rapidly penetrate the brain after intravenous administration, seems to readily 
maintain self-administration in squirrel monkeys [79, 80]. Additionally, self-administration 
of endogenous cannabinoids anandamide [81] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [82] by squirrel 
monkeys has also been demonstrated. To date, Δ9-THC has not been reported to maintain 
reliable self-administration behavior in rodents, although the higher efficacy cannabinoids 
WIN 55,212 and HU-210 have been reported to maintain intravenous self-administration

 behavior in mice and rats [83–85]. These data may suggest that other high efficacy 
cannabinoids, such as those present in K2/Spice products, might also display reinforcing 
effects in self-administration procedures, but thus far, no published reports bolster this 
supposition. Indeed, a recent paper failed to demonstrate reinforcing effects with JWH-030, 
JWH-175 or JWH-176 in rats [86]. Nevertheless, the majority of self-administration reports 
in squirrel monkeys and rats demonstrate that the reinforcing effects of intravenous 
cannabinoids are significantly attenuated by pretreatment with CB1 cannabinoid receptor 
antagonists, strongly suggesting that the abuse-related effects of these substances are indeed 
mediated by central cannabinoid systems.
Another way to indirectly assess abuse-related effects of cannabinoids in experimental 
animals is to study their capacity to elicit a conditioned place preference. After a few 
pairings of a drug with a novel context, an increase in time spent in the drug-paired context 
relative to control is deemed a “conditioned place preference” and may indicate that the drug 
has positive motivational properties, while a decrease in time spent in the drug-paired 
context is termed a “conditioned place aversion” and may indicate that the drug has aversive 
stimulus properties [87]. Presumably, the learned association between the context and the 
interoceptive stimulus properties of the drug dictates both the magnitude and directionality 
of the place conditioning effect. Studies investigating the capacity of cannabinoids to induce 
conditioned place preference present a complex and contradictory picture. For example, 
administration of high dose Δ9-THC or higher efficacy cannabinoids (including CP 55,940, 
WIN 55,212, and HU 210) to rodents typically produces either no effect in place 
conditioning assays, or induces place aversion (reviewed in [88] and [89]). Nevertheless, 
robust preferences for Δ9-THC-paired contexts have sometimes been reported in rats [90] 
and mice [91–93] if the animals have been “pre-exposed” to cannabinoids prior to beginning 
conditioning trials. These results probably indicate that methodological factors within place 
conditioning experiments are critical mediators of the magnitude and directionality 
(preference versus aversion) of the effects observed with cannabinoids. Interestingly, as 
previously demonstrated with Δ9-THC, prior exposure to Δ9-THC was required to “unmask” 
rewarding effects of JWH-018 [94] and pre-exposure to HU-210 prior to CPP conditioning 
sessions was necessary to obtain place preference with HU-210. [95]. At the time of this 
writing, very few SCBs have been tested in CPP experiments. With the exception of 
JWH-018 (described in [94]), only CP 55,940, WIN 55,212, and HU 210 have been tested 
for rewarding or aversive effects using place conditioning methods, and the results of such 
studies have been highly variable ([88, 89]). Given the general failure of cannabinoids to 
elicit reinforcing effects in laboratory animals, it may be the case that place conditioning 
could be more sensitive to abuse-related effects of these compounds. Further efforts to 
characterize newly emerging novel SCBs should consider profiling these drugs in place 
conditioning assays.
Tolerance
A recent survey [96] finds prevalent use of SCBs among cannabis smokers (e.g., 32.3%), 
including a subset of individuals reporting daily use of SCBs. This agrees with previous 
reports that most college students who abuse SCBs also regularly use marijuana [30, 97], 
raising the possibility of cross-tolerance between Δ9-THC and the SCBs. Repeated

 administration of cannabinoid agonists has been shown to result in tolerance to several 
central and peripheral effects in laboratory animals [98–100], and to cellular effects 
observed in vitro (reviewed by [10]). In human marijuana users, tolerance to numerous 
cannabinoid effects has also been reported following smoked [101–103] and oral [104–106] 
administration of Δ9-THC. Thus, a history of Δ9-THC administration might also render 
individuals less sensitive to some effects of the higher efficacy SCBs through the 
phenomenon of cross-tolerance. This is especially important because drug users often 
increase the amount of drugs they consume in an attempt to surmount tolerance to desired 
psychoactive effects, and any factors which lead SCB users to escalate dose will necessarily 
increase the risk for adverse effects. Thus, if it is the case that non-cannabinoid receptors 
prove to be involved in some of the adverse effects of SCBs, tolerant individuals might be 
particularly susceptible to these effects as they escalate their drug doses.
The role of intrinsic efficacy in tolerance and cross-tolerance among the cannabinoids is 
underdeveloped, and the data in this domain are often contradictory. For example, some 
studies show similar tolerance to hypothermic effects of Δ9-THC and the high efficacy 
cannabinoids CP-55,940 and WIN 55,212-2 following a Δ9-THC pretreatment regimen 
[107], while others show these same high efficacy cannabinoids to partially surmount Δ9-
THC-induced tolerance to locomotor suppression, hypothermia and antinociception [108]. 
More recently, the high efficacy SCBs JWH-018 and JWH- 073 were unable to induce 
hypothermia in mice previously made tolerant to hypothermic effects of low efficacy Δ9-
THC, suggesting that cross-tolerance developed to the hypothermic effects of the high 
efficacy SCBs, despite the relatively large disparity in intrinsic activity [109]. In other 
words, unlike what is typically observed with other drugs (such as the opioids), tolerance to 
an effect induced by low efficacy Δ9-THC was not surmounted by administration of higher 
efficacy SCBs. Furthermore, cross-tolerance was still present 14 days after Δ9-THC 
cessation, suggesting that this cross-tolerance may be as persistent as the tolerance induced 
by repeated administration of the high efficacy SCBs themselves [109]. Indeed, chronic 
treatment with high efficacy SCBs results in rapid and persistent tolerance to some, but not 
all, in vivo effects, accompanied by region-specific down-regulation and desensitization of 
central CB1 cannabinoid receptors [109–111] (Figure 3).
In the case report literature, there are a few published instances of what might seem to be a 
paradoxical hyperthermic response to SCB use in humans. One report describes the clinical 
course of 11 patients exposed to the SCB MAB-CHMINACA [58]. For the most part, the 
symptoms reported are consistent with known SCB effects, including altered consciousness, 
severe agitation, seizures and death, however, a 20-year-old male patient developed a 
malignant hyperthermia and died on his seventh day in the hospital. Similarly, another report 
(which did not forensically determine the specific compound ingested) described 
hyperthermia in a patient who reportedly had smoked a commercial SCB preparation known 
as “Mr Big Shot” [112] and was successfully treated after 60 minutes of evaporative cooling 
and ice pack exposure. At present the mechanism for SCB-induced hyperthermia – if indeed 
SCBs were the cause of these two reported instances – remains unknown.

 Dependence and Withdrawal
Drug dependence cannot be directly observed in vivo, but it is assumed to be present when 
either sudden abstinence from chronic drug use or administration of an antagonist elicits a 
withdrawal syndrome. Most studies indicate that simple cessation of chronic Δ9-THC 
administration does not cause spontaneous signs of withdrawal in laboratory animals [113], 
but robust withdrawal signs are reported after discontinuing SCBs in human users [114]. 
Unfortunately, clinical reviews of withdrawal following SCB discontinuation in humans 
(see, for example, [52, 96, 114–116] do not report specific SCB compounds used, most 
likely because the users themselves do not know the identity of the specific drugs. However, 
in mice, CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist-precipitated withdrawal is reliably 
characterized by readily quantifiable signs, including wet dog shakes, head shakes, front paw 
tremor, and motor hyperactivity [113, 117]. Importantly, withdrawal contributes to relapse to 
drug use for a wide range of abused substances. Thus, if withdrawal from high efficacy 
SCBs is exacerbated compared to Δ9-THC, this implies that SCB users attempting to cease 
SCB use may be powerfully motivated to relapse to escape aversive withdrawal effects. 
However, it is not currently known whether abuse of high-efficacy SCBs would result in a 
more extreme abstinence syndrome than typically observed following discontinuation of 
cannabis use, but reports of SCB withdrawal are accumulating in the literature [52, 114–
116]. Given the adverse effects associated with acute and long-term abuse of SCBs [118–
120] it is increasingly apparent that research into potential therapeutics is warranted. 
Currently, there is no accepted medical treatment for cannabinoid dependence. The most 
well-researched pharmacotherapeutic for the treatment of cannabinoid dependence is the 
CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist / inverse agonist rimonabant [121], however, the 
inverse agonist properties of this drug result not only in blockade of the pharmacological 
effects elicited by cannabinoid agonists, but also in disruption of constitutive CB1 
cannabinoid receptor activity. This fundamental difference between inverse agonists (which 
decrease signaling below levels observed in normal physiology) and what are conceptualized 
as neutral antagonists (which block agonist-elicited stimulation in signaling, but preserve 
constitutive activity) has pharmacological relevance within the cannabinboid system, as 
rimonabant has been shown to increase cAMP levels in a forskolin-stimulated cAMP assay 
[122, 123], while the neutral CB1R antagonist AM4113 has no effect on forskolin-
stimulated cAMP production [123]. Systems-level behavioral differences between inverse 
agonists and neutral antagonists have also been demonstrated, where AM4113 did not 
induce conditioned gaping in rats or emesis in ferrets, both of which occur with inverse 
agonists, such as rimonabant and AM251 [124, 125]. In humans, adverse events reported 
after rimonabant exposure, including suicidal ideation, nausea, seizure [126], anxiety and 
depression [127], eventually led to withdrawal of the drug from the European market and 
importantly, these adverse events have been ascribed to the inverse agonist properties of 
rimonabant at CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the CNS [117, 128]. This suggests that 
cannabinoid withdrawal precipitated by rimonabant, and the direct adverse effects of 
rimonabant in subjects not previously exposed to exogenous cannabinoids, may not be solely 
attributed to blockade of CB1 cannabinoid receptors, but may also be exacerbated by 
rimonabant’s negative efficacy at those binding sites. Development of a truly neutral CB1 
cannabinoid receptor antagonist as a possible pharmacotherapeutic for cannabis dependence

 is currently an active area of research, and may be useful in treatment of cannabinoid 
dependence.
Factors potentially contributing to greater SCB toxicity relative to Δ9-THC
In vitro pharmacodynamics of SCBs
The mechanisms responsible for the enhanced toxicity of SCBs relative to Δ9-THC (see 
Table 1) are currently unknown. Many factors may contribute, including potential off-target 
action of SCBs at non-cannabinoid receptors [61], a complete lack of quality control in 
abuse-ready smoking products [129], and the absence of potentially toxicity-mitigating non-
psychoactive phytocannabinoids in SCB products, as compared to those co-occurring 
endogenously in cannabis sativa [130]. However, the following section will focus on 
reported differences in CB1 cannabinoid receptor affinity, potency and efficacy between 
SCBs and Δ9-THC, for which the most quantitative data are available.
SCBs exhibit higher CB1 cannabinoid receptor affinity than Δ9-THC
Δ9-THC produces psychotropic actions by activating CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the CNS 
[131]. SCBs also bind and activate CB1 cannabinoid receptors (see following discussion), 
and thus the abuse liability of both Δ9-THC and SCBs likely results from their agonist 
actions at these receptors. Therefore, this review will limit discussion of recent reports that 
have examined the affinity of SCBs for CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Almost all SCBs studied 
to date have higher affinity for CB1 cannabinoid receptors than Δ9-THC. Depending on the 
radioligand or specific assay conditions employed, the affinity (or Ki) of Δ9-THC has been 
reported to range from 3.87 [5] to 41 nM [132]. In contrast, SCBs contained in seized K2/
Spice products often exhibit sub-nanomolar CB1 cannabinoid receptor affinity (e.g, 5F-
PB-22 [133], AK-B48 [133], AB-FUBINACA [134], ADB-FUBINACA, [134], JWH-122 
[24], JWH-210 [21]). Newer SCBs derived from the indazole carboxamide scaffold, 
including AB-CHIMINACA [135] and AKB48 [23, 133], also have sub-nanomolar affinity 
for CB1 cannabinoid receptors. In addition to such “ultra-high affinity” compounds, many 
other SCBs also bind with high affinity to CB1 cannabinoid receptors, exhibiting Ki values 
between 1 and 20 nM (e.g., JWH-018 [136], AB-PINACA [135], JWH-250, [137], STS-135 
[133]). Importantly, since the majority of SCBs bind to CB1 cannabinoid receptors with 
higher affinity relative to Δ9-THC, it might be anticipated that these compounds may also 
more potently modulate signaling pathways, potentially contributing to increased toxicity 
observed for SCBs.
SCBs exhibit high potency and greater efficacy for modulation of CB1 cannabinoid 
receptor-mediated signaling than Δ9-THC
In addition to exhibiting higher affinity for CB1 cannabinoid receptors than Δ9-THC, most 
SCBs also modulate intracellular signaling pathways via cannabinoids receptors with high 
potency and full efficacy when compared to the partial agonist Δ9-THC (Figure 2). CB1 and 
CB2 cannabinoid receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that, upon agonist binding, 
activate Gi/o-proteins [138, 139] that then proceed to inhibit activity of the downstream 
intracellular effector adenylyl cyclase (AC), resulting in reduction in cAMP levels [140]. 
Therefore, most studies quantify the intrinsic activity of SCBs by measuring the potency

 (e.g., EC50/IC50) and efficacy (e.g., Emax/Imax) of these compounds to activate G-proteins 
and/or inhibit AC-activity in brain homogenates (G-protein activation) or whole cells 
expressing native or transfected CB1 cannabinoid receptors (AC-activity). Activation of CB1 
cannabinoid receptors by Δ9-THC results in potent activation of G-proteins (ED50 values 81 
[141] to 167 [136] nM), but only as a partial agonist. SCBs examined in this assay instead 
act full CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonists when compared to Δ9-THC (e.g, JWH-018 [136], 
5F-PB-22 [133], MAM-2201 [142], JWH-250 [137], STS-135 [133], XLR-11 [143]). Δ9-
THC also potently inhibits AC-activity via CB1 cannabinoid receptors (e.g., IC50 values 
ranging from 5.0 [140] to 44 nM [23]), although with reduced efficacy indicative of a partial 
agonist. In marked contrast, almost all SCBs examined in this assay also inhibit AC-activity 
with high potency in the nM range, but similar to modulation of G-protein activity, act as 
full agonists (e.g, 5F-PB-22 [133], AB-PINACA [142], EAM-2201 [142], MAM-2201 
[142], JWH-250 [137], PB-22, AK-B48 [133], STS-135 [133] and XLR-11 [143]). Similar 
full agonist activity for SCBs at CB1 cannabinoid receptors has been demonstrated by use of 
additional methods including a fluorometric assay to measure membrane potential [144] and 
in primary hippocampal neurons by quantifying calcium transients [142]. As would be 
expected if SCBs are modulating G-protein activation and AC-inhibition via CB1 
cannabinoid receptors, in most instances, the rank order of affinity of the investigated SCBs 
for CB1 cannabinoid receptors parallels the potency of these compounds to modulate CB1 
cannabinoid receptor-mediated signaling pathways [135] and those CB1-mediated functional 
effects induced by SCBs can be reversed by CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists [23, 135, 
144]. Importantly, the higher efficacy of SCBs likely results in not only greater acute effects 
that may contribute to toxicity, but also in enhanced chronic effects occurring at both cellular 
and whole animal levels that perhaps lead to tolerance and dependence.
SCB in vivo Pharmacodynamics
The higher in vitro efficacy of SCBs as compared to Δ9-THC is intriguingly recapitulated at 
the systems level for some endpoints, but not for all endpoints. Administration of 
cannabinoid agonists from multiple structural classes elicits a characteristic cluster of effects 
in laboratory animals. This cluster of the four classical endpoints of hypothermia, analgesia, 
catalepsy, and locomotor suppression has been termed the cannabinoid tetrad [18, 145]. 
Consistent with the higher in vitro efficacy of SCBs as compared to Δ9-THC, multiple 
laboratories reliably report that hypothermic effects obtained with SCBs are greater in 
magnitude than those observed after administration of maximally effective doses of Δ9-THC 
in mice [109, 146, 147]. In contrast, multiple research groups consistently demonstrate that 
Δ9-THC elicits a similar degree of locomotor suppression as higher efficacy SCBs [109, 
148] [135]. No consistent efficacy-dependent results are obtained with the cannabinoid 
tetrad endpoints of analgesia and catalepsy, presumably due to numerous methodological 
variables associated with data collection across laboratories.
Perhaps the most vexing finding with regards to the relationship between intrinsic efficacy 
and behavioral effects comes from the realm of drug discrimination. In humans, 
cannabinoids exert numerous effects on perception and other unobservable psychological 
endpoints, thus, drug discrimination is useful as an animal model of these subjective effects. 
The drug discrimination assay can be thought of as an in vivo drug detection procedure

 whereby animals are trained to recognize the stimulus effects of a given dose of a particular 
training drug. Once trained, animals may be administered different doses of the same 
training drug, or different doses of a novel compound suspected to have similar subjective 
effects to the training drug. Indeed, SCBs reliably induce Δ9-THC-like effects in animals 
trained to discriminate Δ9-THC. For example, full substitution for Δ9-THC was observed 
with JWH-018 and JWH-073 in mice [149], which is consistent with the notion that a full 
agonist would substitute for a partial agonist in this assay. However, instead of a partial-
substitution profile expected from the study of other drugs as discriminative stimuli, Δ9-THC 
reliably produces full substitution for the training stimulus across rodent and non-human 
primate species trained to discriminate a variety of full CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonists. 
For example, Δ9-THC fully substituted for the high efficacy SCB JWH-018 in rhesus 
monkeys [150] and in rats [151]. This same pattern of results was also obtained in squirrel 
monkeys trained to discriminate the full CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist AM4054 [152]. It 
is clear that the role of intrinsic cannabinoid efficacy in systems-level effects is poorly 
understood, and likely to be a fertile topic for research for some time.
SCB Pharmacokinetics
SCBs are metabolized to many active phase I and II metabolites, Δ9-THC is not
Mounting evidence indicates that SCBs can cause severe, adverse responses in users (Table 
1), but little is known about the potential influence of metabolism on the toxicological 
effects of these novel compounds. It is recognized that oxidative metabolism (Phase I) 
generally terminates the activity of the parent compounds and functionalizes them for future 
conjugation reactions (Phase II) such as glucuronidation and sulfation [153], considered the 
final step for terminating biological activity. Δ9-THC metabolism has been well studied and 
is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, but only to 
a single major active metabolite (11-OH-Δ9-THC) with equivalent CB1 cannabinoid receptor 
affinity [154] and slightly higher potency in antinociceptive assays [155] as compared to the 
parent drug. 11-OH-Δ9-THC is subsequently oxidized to an inactive intermediate 11-nor-9-
carboxy-Δ9-THC that is conjugated to form the O-ester glucuronide, the major metabolite 
detected in urine [156]. In marked contrast, it has been reported that numerous hydroxylated 
metabolites of the SCBs JWH-073, JWH-018 and AM-2201 bind to CB1 and CB2 
cannabinoid receptors with affinity similar to that of the parent compound, and possess 
biological activity in both in vitro and in vivo assays [157–159]. Furthermore, several of the 
hydroxylated compounds detected following administration of the SCBs JWH-018, 
AM-2201, JWH-122, JWH-210, PB-22, MAM-2201, EAM-2201 and 5F-PB-22 [158, 160] 
are the major phase I metabolites formed, and importantly retain higher in vitro affinity and 
activity than Δ9-THC. Although a major glucuronide conjugate of JWH-018 exhibits 
reduced affinity for CB1 cannabinoid receptors, this metabolite still binds to CB1 
cannabinoid receptors in the high nM range and acts as a competitive CB1 cannabinoid 
receptor antagonist [161]. Therefore, in susceptible individuals (see following genetic 
polymorphism section), metabolism to active CB1 cannabinoid receptor metabolites may 
contribute to increased half-life, efficacy and toxicity of SCBs compared to Δ9-THC, while 
metabolism to competitive CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists could lead to increased 
SCB consumption in an attempt to overcome blunted psychoactive effects. In any case, since

 many hydroxylated and conjugated derivatives of SCBs (but not Δ9-THC) retain biological 
activity, defining the metabolic processing of SCBs is required to fully understand the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of known and future novel classes of 
these abused compounds.
Genetic polymorphisms of P450 and UGT metabolic enzymes may contribute to 
idiosyncratic SCB toxicity
Based on the reported complex metabolism of SCBs to potentially pharmacologically 
relevant metabolites (see previous section), identifying specific phase I and II enzymes 
involved in SCB biotransformation is critical to provide essential direction for future 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic studies of current and future classes of these virtually 
unknown compounds. Without this information, understanding of adverse drug reactions 
potentially related to polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug-drug 
interactions cannot be achieved. For example, CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 are the major 
cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolism of the SCB JWH-018 [158], while 
CYP3A4 is most important for oxidation of AKB-48 [162]. SCBs of the napthoylindole 
class inhibit [163], while cigarette smoking induce [164], CYP1A activity. Several clinically 
relevant polymorphisms that affect activity of both CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 also have been 
reported [165]. Furthermore, two human brain UGT isoforms (UGT1A3 and UGT2B7) 
show relatively high activity toward two metabolites of the SCB JWH-018 commonly found 
in human urine (JWH-018-ω-OH and JWH-018-ω-COOH) [166], implying that these UGT 
enzymes may control neuronal concentrations of glucuronidated conjugates available for 
interaction with CB1 cannabinoid receptors after SCB exposure. In summary, genetic 
polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes in susceptible individuals may contribute to 
unique idiosyncratic toxicity often observed following abuse of SCBs.
SCB toxicity - CB1 versus non-CB1 cannabinoid receptor targets
To develop efficacious treatments for SCB toxicity, it is important to first determine potential 
targets responsible for mediating the adverse effects produced by these drugs. Since SCBs 
were originally synthesized to exhibit high affinity and activity at CB1 and/or CB2 
cannabinoid receptors, it might be expected that many of the adverse effects produced by 
these drug occur via action at cannabinoid receptors. Indeed, as discussed previously in this 
review, SCBs exhibit several distinct in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic properties when 
acting at CB1 cannabinoid receptors that likely contribute to the different and greater toxic 
effects of these drugs relative to Δ9-THC. In support of this suggestion, SCBs examined to 
date (AM-2201, JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-081, JWH-210, JWH-167 and JWH-391) lack 
appreciable affinity for a number of non-CB1 cannabinoid receptor targets including 
norepinephrine, histamine, opioid, sigma, GABAA or benzodiazepine receptor subtypes 
[61]. The selective CB1 cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant reverses the effects of these 
SCBs in a functional observational battery in mice (e.g., muscle tone, equilibrium, 
sensorimotor activity, alertness, ease of handling and autonomic effects). Furthermore, 
sensorimotor dysfunction in mice produced by JWH-018, JWH-250 and JWH-073 [60, 167], 
and impaired motor activity and seizures resulting from JWH-018 and JWH-018-Br [168] 
are all normalized by co-administration with CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists 
Ford et al.

 rimonabant and AM-251. Finally, antinociception and hypothermic effects produced by the 
SCBs CP-55,950, WIN-55,212-2, JWH-073, A-834,735D and CP-47,497 are absent in CB1 
cannabinoid receptor knockout mice [169]. These in vitro and in vivo studies collectively 
indicate that many SCB adverse effects observed in humans are likely mediated via CB1 
cannabinoid receptors.
SCBs also exhibit high affinity and activity at CB2 cannabinoid receptors, the second major 
cannabinoid receptor subtype [159, 170, 171]. Although CB2 cannabinoid receptors are 
expressed in relatively low levels in the CNS [172] and are not directly associated with 
psychoactive effects produced by SCBs [173], prolonged activation of CB2 cannabinoid 
receptors has been shown to upregulate 5-HT2A serotonin receptors in mouse prefrontal 
cortex [174, 175]. 5-HT2A serotonin receptors are the primary site of action for 
hallucinogenic drugs [176] and 5-HT2A serotonin receptor dysfunction has been associated 
with mental disorders including anxiety [177] and psychosis [178]. Common adverse effects 
of SCBs, but not Δ9-THC, are anxiety and psychosis [179] (Table 1). Based on the reported 
interaction between CB2 cannabinoid and 5-HT2A serotonin receptors, it is possible that 
chronic activation of CB2 cannabinoid receptors by SCBs results in an enhancement of 5-
HT2A serotonin receptor function that contributes to anxiety and psychosis often observed 
following exposure to SCBs.
SCBs are structurally diverse (Figure 1) and produce many toxic effects that are not 
observed with Δ9-THC (Table 1). Therefore, it might be anticipated that these 
uncharacterized compounds might also exhibit appreciable affinity and activity for cellular 
targets other than CB1 or CB2 cannabinoid receptors that contribute to the distinct toxicity 
associated with SCB abuse. In support of this suggestion, some (AM-2201, JWH-018, 
JWH-073, JWH-167 and JWH-391), but not other (JWH-081 and JWH-210) SCBs act as 
low potency (EC50 > 3 mM), but high efficacy (> 59%) inhibitors of hERG channels [61]. 
hERG channel inhibition contributes to prolonged QT intervals and ventricular tachycardia 
[180], and thus may underlie cardiovascular toxicity reported following SCB use [34] (Table 
1). Although potential links to toxicity are currently unknown, SCBs have also been shown 
to inhibit currents through 5HT3 receptors in the high nanomolar (nM) range (100–600 nM) 
[181], and at high micromolar (µM) concentrations inhibit monoamine oxidase activity 
[182], antagonize 5HT2B serotonin receptors [61], and activate strychnine-sensitive α1 
glycine receptors by direct and allosteric mechanisms [183]. In summary, although more 
research is required, the distinct toxicity profile observed with abuse of SCBs relative to Δ9-
THC likely results from actions at both CB1 and non-CB1 cannabinoid receptor targets.
“Antidote” for acute SCB toxicity – selective CB1 cannabinoid receptor 
antagonists?
Since SCBs lack appreciable affinity for non-CB1 cannainoid receptor targets [61] and 
almost all acute SCB responses in animals are blocked by co-administration with CB1 
cannabinoid receptor antagonists (e.g., rimonabant or AM-251) [60, 61, 167–169], it is 
unfortunate that clinical studies to examine the potential use of CB1 cannabinoid receptor 
antagonists for treatment of acute SCB overdose in emergency departments have not been

 conducted. The CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant was 
withdrawn from clinical trials for use in obesity by the European Medicines Agency in 
October of 2008 due to adverse psychiatric consequences [184]. Following this decision, all 
major pharmaceutical companies developing CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist/inverse 
agonists quickly discontinued ongoing clinical research of drugs in this class. As might be 
expected, these safety concerns have likely limited investigation of CB1 cannabinoid 
receptor antagonists for treatment of acute or chronic SCB toxicity in humans. However, 
since the most serious adverse effects of rimonabant were primarily observed following 
chronic therapy, and in a relatively small subset of patients [185], the important and potential 
life saving use of CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists for treatment of acute SCB overdose 
should perhaps be examined.
Concluding Remarks
SCBs were originally synthesized to aid in the development of therapeutically useful 
cannabinoid receptor ligands [18–21]. Unfortunately, since the early 2000’s, SCBs have 
been synthesized by clandestine labs and marketed to vulnerable populations as safe and 
legal alternatives to marijuana, despite the numerous serious adverse effects posed to human 
health (Table 1). Although production and usage of K2/Spice products has significantly 
increased over the years, very few mechanistic studies have established direct mechanisms 
responsible for the increased toxicity of these high affinity, high efficacy “marijuana 
substitutes” at CB1 and/or non-CB1-cannabinoid receptor targets (Outstanding Questions 1 
and 2). In addition to lack of mechanistic insight, very little continues to be known 
concerning potential contributions of phase I and II metabolism of SCBs to toxicity 
observed following K2/Spice use (Outstanding Question 3). As reviewed here, the 
consequences of acute and chronic K2/Spice abuse have been examined in studies ranging 
from basic science reports to clinical cases [5, 21, 24, 44, 55–58, 133, 134]. Although much 
useful information has been gained, unfortunately, many important questions remain; such 
as, why adolescents appear to be more susceptible to the pro-psychotic actions of SCBs 
(reviewed in, for example, [186] and in [64]) (Outstanding Question 4). Additionally, it is 
curious why current treatment of SCB toxicity is purely supportive, lacking clinically 
available efficacious antidotes for serious life-threatening situations (Outstanding Questions 
5 and 6)? Upon review of the structural diversity, distinct pharmacodynamic, 
pharmacokinetic and clinical effects produced by these compounds, it can readily be 
concluded that SCBs are neither similar, nor safe, substitutes for marijuana. As shown in 
Figure 4 (Key Figure) by comparing several characteristics of SCBs reviewed here with 
marijuana, distinctions between the pharmacological and clinical actions are quite dramatic. 
Although scheduling of SCBs has been a priority by the DEA since 2010, the inability for 
legislation to stay ahead of the production of novel SCBs continues to fail in preventing the 
ongoing abuse of these very dangerous and occasionally deadly drugs (Outstanding 
Question 7).

 Outstanding Questions Box
•
Why is there an apparent lack of research directed toward determination of 
non-CB1 receptor-mediated targets possibly responsible for human toxicity 
produced by SCB, but not Δ9-THC abuse?
•
Does high affinity and efficacy of SCBs at CB1 receptors, when compared to 
Δ9-THC, contribute to greater toxicity associated with use of K2/Spice 
products?
•
Do genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes, potentially 
producing pharmacologically active phase I and phase II metabolites, 
contribute to SCB toxicity in susceptible individuals?
•
Does brain development during adolescence make K2/Spice users in this 
group more susceptible the potential psychotic and/or pro-convulsant effects 
of SCBs?
•
Why is no research being conducted to examine the potential use of the CB1 
receptor antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant for cases of acute K2/Spice 
overdose in emergency departments?
•
Why is there an apparent lack of research toward development of other safe 
and widely available antidotes for treatment of SCB overdose?
•
What legislative steps can be taken to stay ahead of production of novel SCBs 
by clandestine laboratories?

 Trends Box
•
Synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs) are a large collection of man-made chemicals, 
reported in the scientific literature over decades of research to have affinity 
for CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors.
•
Products known as K2 or Spice contain a mixture of SCBs that have been 
illicitly synthesized and sprayed onto inert plant material, in order to mimic 
the appearance and psychotropic effects of Δ9-THC in marijuana.
•
K2/Spice products are falsely marketed to adolescent and other vulnerable 
populations as “safe” and/or “legal” alternatives to marijuana, and are widely 
known to avoid detection in standard drug screens due to their lack of 
structural similarity to Δ9-THC.
•
SCBs present in K2/Spice products produce a variety of dangerous acute and 
chronic adverse effects, including psychosis, seizures, tolerance, dependence 
and death, with a greater severity and frequency than observed following 
marijuana use.
•
Very little is known concerning the mechanisms underlying the distinct toxic 
effects of SCBs compared to Δ9-THC, but it is likely that they result from 
actions at both CB1 and non-CB1 cannabinoid receptor targets.

 Figure 1. Structural evolution and legislative scheduling of SCBs between 2010 and 2014
Schematic illustration shows the prevalent SCB structural classes and corresponding 
compounds available in K2/Spice products. In 2010, naphthoylindoles, such as JWH-018 
and JWH-073, and cyclohexylphenols, like CP-47,497, were the primary SCBs found in 
seized K2/Spice products. Use of these SCBs continued throughout 2011, with the addition 
of the flouroalkyl derivative of JWH-018, AM-2201. On March 1, 2011 legislation under the 
76 FR 11075 act temporarily scheduled numerous SCBs (many not shown) that were 
structurally similar to naphthoylindole and cyclohexylphenol classes. Although numerous 
SCB analogues within these two classes were permanently scheduled July 9, 2012 under the 
152 FDASIA act, new, structurally diverse classes of SCBs were subsequently identified in 
K2/Spice products. These novel classes included the tetramethylcyclopropylindoles, e.g., 
UR-144 and its fluorinated analogue XLR-11, as well as adamantoylindoles, e.g., AKB48. 
Because these structurally distinct SCBs were not included in section the 1152 of FDASIA 
scheduling act in 2012, May 6, 2013, legislation temporarily scheduled compounds 
associated with the tetramethylcyclopropylindole and adamantoylindole classes under the 78 
FR 28735 act. As previous trends suggested, before completion of the 78 FR 28735

 scheduling act, new SCBs had once again emerged in K2/Spice products that were also not 
included in section the 1152 of FDASIA scheduling act. The new classes of SCBs were the 
indazole carboximides, AB-PINACA and AB-FUBNACA, and quinolinyl esters, PB-22 and 
its fluorinated analogue 5F-PB-22 (not shown). Although, most of the compounds in these 
classes (excluding AB-PINACA) were temporarily scheduled on February 10, 2014 under 
the 78 FR 28735 act, it can only be assumed that new classes of SCBs will emerge in the 
future [2].

 Figure 2. The SCB JWH-018 is a full agonist at CB1 cannabinoid receptors when compared to 
Δ9-THC at the cellular level
In panel A, Δ9-THC (green circles) binds and stabilizes the active confirmation of CB1 
cannabinoid receptors with high affinity. Δ9-THC induces amplification that results in highly 
potent, and moderately efficacious coupling to Gi/o proteins, that then proceed to inhibit 
activity of the downstream intracellular effector, adenylyl cyclase [138–140]. Δ9-THC in 
marijuana is classified as a partial CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist due to its sub-maximal 
recruitment of Gi/o proteins and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Comparatively, in panel B, 
the SCB, JWH-018 (blue diamonds) also binds to CB1 cannabinoid receptors with a very 
high affinity and couples Gi/o proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. The major distinction 
between Δ9-THC and JWH-018 is the efficacy of JWH-018-induced Gi/o coupling and 
adenylyl cyclase inhibition. As depicted, binding of JWH-018 to CB1 cannabinoid receptors 
results in marked increases in Gi/o protein coupling and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase when 
compared to the partial agonist Δ9-THC. As such, JWH-018 present in K2/Spice products 
can be classified as a full CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist [136].

 Figure 3. Chronic administration of JWH-018 results in cellular desensitization and down-
regulation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors, as well as tolerance to SCB-induced behavioral 
responses in animals
In panel A, the SCB JWH-018 (blue diamonds) is administered to a naïve rodent. JWH-018 
binds CB1 cannabinoid receptors on pre-synaptic neurons and mediates full agonist Gi/o 
protein coupling, adenylyl cyclase inhibition and modulation of other effectors including ion 
channels (not depicted). A single behavioral end-point demonstrates that acute 
administration of JWH-018 also results in a marked, time-dependent decrease in core body 
temperature in a SCB-naïve rodent. In panel B, JWH-018 is administered chronically. 
Complex molecular signaling reveals significant desensitization of CB1 cannabinoid 
receptors by phosphorylation and recruitment of β-arrestin 2 (purple rectangles), marked 
down-regulation and internalization of the receptor, and finally dis-inhibition of quantal 
release of neurotransmitter by the pre-synaptic neuron. Attenuation of CB1 cannabinoid 
receptor signaling via desensitization, down-regulation and receptor internalization 
contributes to the blunting of JWH-018-induced hypothermia. The complexity of these 
cellular mechanisms and how they translate to reduced behavioral responses (such as

 Key Figure 4. SCBs present in K2/Spice products are not safe alternatives to marijuana
SCBs in K2/Spice products are structurally diverse psychoactive compounds, exhibiting 
distinct pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and clinical effects when compared to Δ9-THC 
in marijuana. The studies reviewed here clearly demonstrate that SCBs are neither similar, 
nor suitable, substitutes for marijuana and that use of these compounds can result in 
tolerance and dependence, as well as numerous other documented adverse, toxic and 
potentially fatal effects.
