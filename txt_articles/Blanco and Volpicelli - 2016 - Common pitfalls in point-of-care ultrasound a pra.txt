Common pitfalls in point-of-care 
ultrasound: a practical guide for emergency 
and critical care physicians
Pablo Blanco1,2* and Giovanni Volpicelli3
Abstract 
Background: Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is a widely used tool in emergency and critical care settings, 
useful in the decision-making process as well as in interventional guidance. While having an impressive diagnostic 
accuracy in the hands of highly skilled operators, inexperienced practitioners must be aware of some common  
misinterpretations that may lead to wrong decisions at the bedside.
Objectives: This article provides a revision list of common POCUS misdiagnoses usually found in practice and offers 
useful tips to recognize and avoid them.
Discussion: The following aspects were selected and reviewed: pericardial effusion vs. pleural vs. ascites vs. epicardial 
fat; right ventricle dilation in acute pulmonary embolism and inferior vena cava for volume status assessment in  
cardiac ultrasound; lung point and lung pulse misinterpretations and mirror artifacts vs. lung consolidations in 
lung ultrasound; peritoneal fluid vs. the stomach and a critical appraisal of gallbladder signs of acute cholecysti-
tis in abdominal ultrasound; the rouleaux phenomenon vs. deep vein thrombosis or acute right strain in vascular 
ultrasound.
Conclusions: Following some rules in technique and interpretation, and always integrating POCUS findings into the 
broader clinical context, most POCUS misdiagnosis can be avoided, and thus patients’ safety can be enhanced. Being 
aware of a list of common pitfalls may help to avoid misdiagnoses.

Introduction
Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is living a gold 
era in emergency and critical care medicine, because it is 
now widely recognized its usefulness in complementing 
the physical examination and serving as a safe interven-
tional guidance at the bedside [1, 2]. Moreover, an ultra-
sonography-supported paradigm is gradually becoming 
a routine approach when caring for critically ill patients 
[3, 4]. However, it is important to highlight some rising 
concerns regarding provoked patients’ injuries that can 
result when POCUS is used inappropriately by novice 
or inexperienced practitioners. POCUS misdiagnoses 
due to inexperience may lead to errors in the treatment 
that may worsen patients’ outcomes or even be fatal. It 
is important to remind that before taking any action and 
being independent in the decision-making process, prac-
titioners must be properly trained and well prepared to 
the possibility of misinterpretations. Nowadays, POCUS 
competences are covered in many curricula [1, 5–8] and 
included in most hands-on training programs, which 
represent the best way to teach properly POCUS and 
train new operators. Here, we report a revision of some 
common POCUS misdiagnoses that may be encountered 
in the common clinical practice. We will highlight the 
potential impact of these mistakes on patient outcome,

and finally we will list several tips that may be of help for 
a correct interpretation of POCUS imaging.
Cardiac ultrasound
Pericardial effusion versus other diagnosis
Pericardial effusion (PEF) is often found in critically ill 
patients and is defined by transthoracic echocardiogra-
phy (TTE) as a diastolic fluid-filled space located within 
the two layers of the pericardium. Pericardial fluid is 
usually anechoic but sometimes can show a complex 
echotexture as, for instance, when it contains clots, pus 
or fibrin. PEF can be circumferential or regional. Even 
when circumferential, PEF not always is easy to visual-
ize because it may distribute irregularly, and thus several 
TTE views are needed to demonstrate its presence and 
real amount. Magnitude and short time of collection are 
the two main characteristics that influence the possibility 
of tamponade. The most important tips to recall regard-
ing PEF recognition at POCUS are:
  
•
Tracking anterior to descending aorta in parasternal 
long axis and apical 4-chamber views (Fig. 1a, b) [9, 
10].
  
•
PEF is always present in dependent segments (poste-
rior wall, lateral wall, inferior wall).
  
•
Checking diastolic collapse of cardiac chambers that 
is a sign of hemodynamically significant PEF: charac-
teristically, the right ventricle outflow tract and the 
right atrium (RA) are the first parts of the cardiac 
chambers that collapse under the external pressure 
of PEF, followed next by the right ventricle (RV) with 
further increase in the pericardial pressure; diastolic 
collapse of the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) 
can be observed only in the most extreme cases [9, 
10]. Right chambers will be fairly resistant to collapse 
in severe pulmonary hypertension, when abnormal 
high intracavitary pressure is opposed to the high 
intra-pericardial pressure [11]. Of note, diastolic col-
lapse of both atriums in significant PEF occurs in 
ventricular systole (i.e., atrial diastole), and thus one 
can determine its presence when the atrioventricular 
valves are closed. This allow for distinction between 
diastolic collapses in PEF from the normal atrial sys-
tole which occurs when the atrioventricular valves 
are opened.
  
•
Checking dilated (more than 2 cm diameter in long 
axis) and reduced or absent collapsibility (less than 
20% collapse) of the inferior vena cava (tamponade) 
in spontaneously breathing patients [9, 10].
In case of hypovolemic patients with small, under-filled 
cardiac chambers, even a mild PEF may be overestimated 
because the hyper contractile heart could simulate a dias-
tolic collapse of the right chambers. In these cases, the 
observation of a depleted inferior vena cava (more than 
50% or complete collapse during respiration) is a key 
finding, allowing to rule out a significant role of PEF in 
the hemodynamic instability.
The most common problematic differential diagnosis of 
PEF are represented by pleural effusion, peritoneal free-
fluid (ascites) and epicardial and/or mediastinal fat. In 
addition, a large hiatal hernia, pericardial or other medi-
astinal cysts or left ventricle pseudoaneurysm may some-
times be hardly differentiated but more rarely.
Pleural effusion is defined as a fluid-filled space 
located within the pleural space. When not directly 
investigated by lung ultrasound but incidentally detected 
during TTE, pleural effusion is usually present in a sig-
nificant amount. Characteristically, left sided pleural 
effusion appears posterior and lateral to the descend-
ing aorta in parasternal long axis and apical 4-chamber 
views (Fig. 1b, c) [9, 10]. In subcostal views, a right pleu-
ral effusion can also be visualized besides the right car-
diac chambers, extending over the bare area of the liver 
(Fig. 1d). When observed in detail, a mobile and consoli-
dated lung is visualized into the pleural fluid (Fig. 1b–d). 
Additionally, lung ultrasound in coronal views will also 
show this effusion.
Ascites appears invariably in subcostal views, anterior 
to the right cardiac chambers. In these cases, the falci-
form ligament is observed within the fluid, which in addi-
tion with the visible diaphragmatic movement, allows to 
confirm the diagnosis (Fig. 2a) [12]. Moreover, extend-
ing the examination to the rest of the abdomen will eas-
ily demonstrate the presence of ascites to complete the 
diagnosis.
Epicardial fat is the adipose tissue accumulated 
between the visceral pericardium and the myocardium 
(i.e., epicardial region) [13, 14]. It is slightly isoechoic and 
is best observed in systole (obliterates completely in dias-
tole) and exclusively in anterior regions. Thus, it is com-
monly visualized in parasternal long and short axis views 
(Fig. 2b) as well as in the subcostal 4-chamber view [13]. 
Mediastinal fat is located anterior to the pericardium and 
is best observed also in parasternal views (short and long 
axis) during systole (Fig. 2b) [13].
Error implication An erroneously diagnosed PEF in the 
unstable patient may lead to undue pericardiocentesis 
with the strong possibility of cardiac chamber perfora-
tion, pericardial tamponade, and eventually, death.
How to avoid this error It is essential to integrate the US 
findings in the clinical context and consider all the infor-

mation on the patient condition, signs and symptoms; 
tamponade is a clinical diagnosis, which is supported by 
a compatible POCUS scan. Eventually, in doubtful cases 
it may be considered draining other effusions if these are 
well demonstrated and reevaluate thereafter the magni-
tude of a PEF. If PEF is still present but is not large and 
shows no hemodynamic consequences on the motility of 
the right cardiac chambers, drainage should be avoided 
unless an infectious PEF is suspected. In case of unusual 
regional location of PEF with intuitive difficulties in the 
procedure for draining, as it may be a posterior PEF, a 
surgical consult should be considered. In difficult cases, 
eventually, the correlation with other imaging methods 
(e.g., CT) is required.
Right ventricle dilation and acute pulmonary embolism
The diagnosis of right ventricle dilation is of paramount 
importance in the bedside diagnosis of pulmonary 
embolism in emergency situations and unstable patients. 
However, not always the dilation is clearly visible and 
many possibilities of error should be considered. The 
diagnosis of dilation basically relies on a comparison 
between the end-diastolic diameters of the RV and LV. 
A wrong and incomplete visualization of the cardiac 
chambers may lead to misdiagnosis. Moreover, the pos-
sibility of a chronic dilation not linked to acute right 
overload may induce further errors. This possibility may 
be encountered in case of evaluation of patients with 
chronic volume overload status (e.g., chronic significant

tricuspid or pulmonary regurgitation) and chronic 
pressure overload conditions (e.g., chronic pulmonary 
hypertension) [15]. RV infarction is another condition 
coursing with RV dilation and impairment of RV func-
tion and sometimes hardly to differentiate from pulmo-
nary embolism. In patients with cardiac arrest from any 
cause, ventricular chambers tend to equalize in short 
time, and thus applying RV dilation criteria may not be 
accurate for RV strain.
Error implication A wrong diagnosis of RV dilation in 
the extreme emergency may lead to the erroneous conclu-
sion of a state of acute right pressure overload (massive 
pulmonary embolism) that may induce undue thromboly-
sis or more invasive treatments (e.g., thrombectomy). On 
the other hand, missing the visualization of real RV dila-
tion from an acute status may delay proper treatment and 
be harmful for the patient.
How to avoid this error To diagnose correctly RV dila-
tion, the two ventricles should be clearly and fully visu-
alized, preferably in the apical 4-chamber view, and the 
two end-diastolic diameters taken beside at the level of 
the atrioventricular valve plane. When this view is not 
fully demonstrative, a conclusion should never be drawn. 
A ratio of at least 0.9 is indicative of dilated RV [16–19]. 
When other views are chosen for difficulty in obtaining 
a clear apical 4-chamber, different cut-offs should be 
applied (Table 1). Along with RV dilation, other signs of 
RV pressure overload may be considered, such as systolic 
interventricular septal flattening with systolic D-shaped 
RV (observed in short-axis views), impairment of RV 
systolic function (e.g., low TAPSE, RV free wall and RV 
inferior wall hypokinesia) as well as a RV-RA peak pres-
sure gradient higher than 30 mmHg [15, 16, 19]. How-
ever, these additional signs are more laborious and need 
an advanced skill to be evaluated. Moreover, they are not 
sufficiently sensitive and specific when considered alone 
[15–17]. Finally, in cases of dilated RV, adjunctive signs of 
chronic dilation should be considered, like the thickness 
of the RV wall (superior to 5 mm), LV status, regional 
impairments, together with clinical history when avail-
able.
RA thrombus in transit and thrombus located between 
both atriums in the foramen ovale are specific signs 
of pulmonary embolism, and thus should always be 
considered.

Inferior vena cava and fluid status
The inferior vena cava (IVC) is responsible for lower 
body systemic blood returning towards the heart. Thus, 
it is a common practice to consider that volemic status 
and/or fluid responsiveness may be in someway related 
to ultrasound measurement of the IVC diameter and its 
dynamics during the respiratory cycles, which allows 
a rough estimation of the right atrial pressure. While a 
depleted IVC is often observed in hypovolemic patients, 
typically the IVC is dilated in a hypervolemic condition 
with a less pronounced or null respiratory collapse [20]. 
However, some gray-zone conditions that alter this sup-
posed linear relationship between the size of the vein 
and the actual volume status can be easily encountered 
and observed in practice. For instance, patients with 
high left ventricle filling pressures and normal IVC [21], 
potentially fluid responsive patients with physiologically 
dilated IVC [22], cases of acute right ventricular infarc-
tion, pericardial tamponade, acute massive pulmonary 
embolism, intraabdominal hypertension, asthma/COPD 
exacerbations and mechanically ventilated patients with 
positive pressures, all represent conditions where the 
IVC measurement may fail in indicating reliably the 
volume status. In addition, acute or chronic cor pul-
monale, severe tricuspid regurgitation and pericardial 
constriction may show highly variable IVC dynamics, 
independent from the real volume status of the patient 
[23]. A further possibility of misinterpretation of the 
ultrasound study of the IVC may happen when the tech-
nique is not correctly applied. For a correct measure, the 
IVC should be visualized in long axis and the inner walls 
clearly imaged. In M-mode, the movement of the vessel 
under the probe may erroneously give the impression 
of a respiratory collapse that is not real. This must be 
checked observing simultaneously the M-mode with two 
dimensional imaging (Additional file 1: Video S1, Addi-
tional file 2: Video S2, Additional file 3: Video S3). Other 
phenomena observed is the inspiratory lateral transla-
tion of the IVC, producing a misalignment between the 
IVC and the US scanning plane, and thus simulating an 
inspiratory collapse [23]. These are common pitfalls that 
may trick even expert operators.
Error implications These misinterpretations may lead 
to avoid fluid treatment and even using undue diuretics 
in patients who are volume depleted and potentially fluid 
responsive (e.g., in cases of patients mechanically venti-
lated, or in some emergencies like myocardial infarction 
of the right ventricle and obstructive causes of shock). On 
the other hand, errors in the IVC ultrasound may lead to 
erroneous administration of fluid challenges in patients 
with high left sided cardiac pressures or conditions of 
non-responsiveness to volume load, sometimes inducing 
pulmonary congestion, worsening hemodynamic status 
and even delaying proper administration of vasopressors 
and inotropes.
How to avoid this error It is essential to integrate the IVC 
analysis with a comprehensive multi-organ ultrasound 
approach that should include a basic focused evaluation 
of the dimensions, ratio and function of the right and left 
cardiac chambers, a basic evaluation of the pulmonary 
congestion by assessing lung ultrasound for B lines, and 
of course, a full consideration of all the available clinical 
information. A correct interpretation of the volume sta-
tus through the IVC assessment should always combine 
the respiratory variation of the IVC with its absolute 
size. In mechanically ventilated patients without inspira-
tory efforts and tidal volume >8 ml/kg (predicted body 
weight), IVC variation (distensibility index) distinguished 
fairly accurately the fluid responsive from non-responsive 
patients [23–25]. In patients with non-invasive ventila-
tion, the interplay between the active respiratory efforts 
of the patient (negative pressure inducing an inspiratory 
flattening of the IVC) and the machine (positive pres-
sure inducing an inspiratory engorgement of the IVC) 
has unpredictable effects on the inferior vena cava [23]. 
In spontaneously breathing patients with hypovolemia, a 
IVC collapsibility >42% may predict fluid responsiveness 
with high specificity (97%) [26]; however, normovolemic 
patients with large respiratory efforts may simulate this 
IVC dynamics [23]. Patients with shallow respiratory 
efforts may induce the opposite changes in the IVC col-
lapsibility.
Other conditions affecting the transmural pressures 
between the thorax and the abdomen (e.g., asthma/
COPD exacerbations, active expiratory efforts, patients 
with invasive mechanical ventilation and inspiratory 
efforts) may preclude the use of the IVC for volume 
assessment, as well as other situations that can induce 
high RA pressures (e.g., RV infarction, tamponade).
Lung ultrasound
Lung sliding, lung point, B lines and lung pulse in the 
diagnosis of pneumothorax
The lung point is a fundamental ultrasonographic sign 
highly specific for confirming pneumothorax [27]. Two 
other equivalent signs are also highly specific for diag-
nosing pneumothorax [27]: the hydro-point [28] and 
the heart-point sign [29]. However, some normal physi-
ological conditions can be misdiagnosed for false lung 
points [30, 31]. The requirement necessary to define the 
 Page 6 of 12
Blanco and Volpicelli  
Crit Ultrasound J  (2016) 8:15 
real lung point is an absent lung sliding with absent sub-
pleural parenchymal ultrasound signals (B-lines or con-
solidations) and the lung point as the contact between 
the aforementioned region and the sliding lung (or pleu-
ral fluid as in hydro-pneumothorax) [32]. Indeed, some 
similar ultrasound patterns representing the interphases 
between the expanding lung and the diaphragm (Addi-
tional file 4: Video S4) and between the expanding lung 
and the heart (Additional file 5: Video S5), may be misdi-
agnosed for false lung points, especially when observed 
with high frequency probes, sometimes inducing the 
operator to wrong conclusions.
A complex situation can also be encountered in 
patients with pulmonary peripheral blebs. These patients 
commonly have structural lung parenchymal alterations 
that sometimes are at risk to develop a secondary pneu-
mothorax in a background of chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease [33]. Thus, differential diagnosis with 
pneumothorax may be crucial. In these cases, some-
times a regular lung sliding can be demonstrated in large 
peripheral blebs even if with some difficulty [34]. How-
ever, very often, the presence of pleural adhesions pre-
cludes the visualization of the respiratory movement of 
the lung and may induce erroneous interpretation. In 
stable patients absence of sliding should never be consid-
ered enough to finalize the diagnosis of pneumothorax. 
Especially, in patients with complex pulmonary disorders 
(large blebs and adhesions), a more detailed chest CT 
study may be required.
Pneumomediastinum may mimic a left sided pneu-
mothorax, producing air artifacts during the chest 
ultrasound examination and even obscuring a regular 
parasternal and apical echocardiographic views. Correla-
tion with chest X-ray or CT is usually required to con-
firm the diagnosis and exclude a pneumothorax [35].
While a false pattern of absence of sliding may contrib-
ute to misdiagnose pneumothorax, sometimes a respira-
tory or cardiac movement of the lung image at ultrasound 
may be misinterpreted for a false lung sliding (Additional 
file 6: Video S6). Even the beat of an intercostal artery 
or the thoracic internal artery in parasternal region may 
simulate a false lung pulse (Additional file 7: Video S7), 
thus inducing the operator to misdiagnose the absence of 
pneumothorax. Similarly, in complex cases of recurrence 
of pneumothorax after abrasion pleurodesis, the visuali-
zation of B lines due to multiple septa still connecting the 
lung to the chest wall may induce to erroneously rule out 
the condition (Additional file 8: Video S8) [36].
Error implications The misdiagnosis of the absence of 
sliding or a false lung point may lead to an unnecessary 
pleural drainage. Furthermore, in doubtful cases, higher 
costs and irradiation exposure may arise if other unneces-
sary diagnostic imaging methods are ordered. In case of 
false sliding, false pulse or multiple septa, the diagnosis 
of pneumothorax may be dangerously delayed or even 
missed.
How to avoid these errors Use a set of criteria to define 
pneumothorax by combining the four basic signs: abol-
ished lung sliding, absent parenchymal signs (B lines and 
consolidations), absent lung pulse and look for the lung 
point for final confirmation in stable patients. Eventually, 
rule in a pneumothorax by chest CT if the patient is stable 
or correlate the ultrasound pattern with previous images, 
when available, in case of history of blebs or previous 
abrasion pleurodesis. In complicated cases, like second-
ary pneumothorax, recurrences, post-procedural pneu-
mothorax, and trauma, a complex pattern should always 
be considered a strong possibility and induce the caring 
physician to carefully scan the whole chest to improve the 
accuracy of lung ultrasound.
Mirror artifact vs. lung consolidation
Mirror artifacts consist in the repetition of a false image 
resulting from the ultrasound beam hitting against a 
highly reflective surface [37], such as the diaphragm. 
Most frequent in the right side, this artifact can simulate 
a lung consolidation by the repetition of the liver tissue 
pattern above the diaphragm (Fig. 3a).
Error implications This misdiagnosis may lead to higher 
costs and adverse effects derived from indications of anti-
biotics as well as unneeded chest X-ray or CT.
How to avoid this error Along with integration into the 
clinical picture, observing the same tissue pattern of the 
liver or spleen is usually enough to rule in this artifact. 
The presence of pleural effusion that invariably accom-
panies lung consolidations and sonographic air or fluid 
bronchograms (Fig. 3b) is never observed in mirror image 
artifacts, and thus may aid in differentiating real lung dis-
eases.
Abdominal ultrasound
Peritoneal fluid versus the stomach
Peritoneal fluid recognition is recommended during 
the first evaluation of trauma patients [38] as well as in 
patients presenting with several abdominal complaints 
and shock [39, 40]. When the abdomen is evaluated in 
left coronal views, a full stomach appearing below the 
diaphragm may mimic a condition of peritoneal fluid 
 Page 7 of 12
Blanco and Volpicelli  
Crit Ultrasound J  (2016) 8:15 
(Fig. 4a). In other situations, the stomach may even 
appear in epigastric subcostal views and may simulate a 
fluid abdominal collection (Fig. 4b). Depending on gas-
tric contents (fluid, air, food), the appearance of the 
stomach may vary, ranging from simple anechoic fluid up 
to a heterogeneous ultrasound pattern.
Error implications A misdiagnosis of false peritoneal 
fluid may lead to undue ultrasound-guided puncture and 
subsequent intraabdominal organ damage (i.e., spleen, 
diaphragm and stomach perforation), and eventually 
involving the pleural space causing pneumothorax. Fur-
thermore, higher costs and undue irradiation may arise 
from confirmatory CT studies. Eventually, this misinter-
pretation may lead to laparotomy, and thus adjunctive 
surgical risks.
How to avoid this error First, it is important to consider 
the possibility of a full stomach since it is visible in most 
non-fasted patients as well as in patients with delayed 
gastrointestinal emptying, which is a common condi-
tion in the critically ill. In doubtful cases and when the 
patients are able to take oral fluids, a possibility for dif-
ferential diagnosis consists in observing bubbles appear-
ing after having asked to the patient to drink some water. 
In unconscious patients or in extreme emergency situa-
tions, such as in postoperative abdominal patients with 
sepsis of unknown origin or in trauma patients, the 
opposite may be done by using the nasogastric or oro-
gastric tube and evaluating if the image persists after 
gastric drainage. Moreover, the gastric tube can be also 
visualized by ultrasound coming down to the stomach 
during the maneuver, confirming the location of the 
organ (Fig. 4c).
Distended gallbladder, thickened gallbladder walls and acute 
cholecystitis
Along with a compatible clinical picture, ultrasono-
graphic criteria of acute cholecystitis are a distended 
gallbladder, thickened walls, biliary sludge and lithi-
asis (calculus type), pericholecystic fluid and sonographic 
Murphy’s sign [41, 42].
Gallbladder distension and wall thickening, although 
important signs, are not specific for acute cholecysti-
tis when considered alone (Tables 2, 3). For example, 
thickened gallbladder walls are commonly observed in 
patients coursing with generalized edemas such as those 
with cardiac failure (Fig. 5a, b), pre-eclampsia or renal 
failure. In non-fasted patients, the gallbladder is physio-
logically contracted, and thus may show thickened walls. 
In the presence of thickened walls, pericholecystic fluid 
and biliary sludge but the absence of clearly visible gall-
stones, acute cholecystitis during septic shock can be 
misdiagnosed [43].

Error implications This misdiagnosis may lead to higher 
costs and adverse effects derived from the indications of 
antibiotics, and eventually, to cholecystectomy or chol-
ecystotomy, and thus unnecessary surgery risks.
How to avoid this error It is essential to integrate ultra-
sound findings into the patient clinical context, always

considering common underlying diseases resulting in 
morphological alterations of the gallbladder (e.g., cardiac 
failure). In the absence of clearly visible gallstones, the 
diagnosis of cholecystitis should always be confirmed by 
other methods [43].
Vascular ultrasound
Rouleaux vs. deep vein thrombosis
Most cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are found in 
lower limbs, exposing patients to the risk of pulmonary 
embolism. A common differential diagnosis of DVT is 
the presence of “rouleaux formation” that is an accumu-
lation of erythrocytes lying over the venous valves rep-
resented by spontaneously echogenic blood flow inside 
the vessel [44] (Fig. 6a; Additional file 3: Video S3). While 
rouleaux is a common finding and usually does not have 
a clinical impact, it is important to highlight that this 
can also be frequently observed when there is a proximal 
venous obstruction, and thus a more proximal DVT must 
be ruled out.
Error implications A misdiagnosis of DVT only based 
on rouleaux may lead to higher costs and unnecessary 
side-effects (bleeding) derived from unnecessary patient 
anticoagulation. However, depending on the setting, the 
vessel observed and the patient condition, the rouleaux 
(or sludge sign) should sometimes induce to extend the 
observation to the possibility of proximal obstruction. 
The sludge sign in the inferior vena cava during cardiac 
arrest with electrical activity and hyperkinetic left cardiac 
chambers may be a sign of acute right overload [45]. The 
same sign in the femoral vein, corroborated by asymmet-
ric femoral veins waveforms at color Doppler analysis, 
may be a sign of isolated iliac thrombus [45].
How to avoid this error In contrast to a real condition of 
thrombosis, veins with rouleaux formation are compress-
ible. Furthermore, distal compression allows to squeeze 
the blood and clear the rouleaux while thrombus cannot 
be released (Fig. 6b; Additional file 3: Video S3). To rule 
in or out a more proximal venous obstruction in the pres-
ence of rouleaux, the operator should look for direct visu-
alization of a thrombus or examine compressibility of the 
proximal veins. In addition, the use of a spectral Doppler 
analysis to assess for respiratory flow variations of periph-
eral veins on both sides may be useful (Fig. 6c, d). More 
than a pattern of low intensity of the signal, especially, an 
asymmetric waveform obtained by comparing the two 
sides, indicates the possibility of a stop between the heart 
and the site of insonation and induces to extend the US 
venous study or use more advanced imaging for confir-
mation.

Conclusions
There are some common misleading situations that 
critical care physicians may encounter in their sonog-
raphy practice. Following some rules in technique and 
interpretation, the accuracy of POCUS can be improved 
and the possibility of dangerous misdiagnoses avoided. It 
is essential to remember that POCUS does not replace 
the clinical judgment, physical examination or common

to improve the clinical accuracy and patient safety.

patient with massive acute pulmonary embolism (Videos 1 to 3). The view 
of video 1 shows a significant venous collapse during respiration that is 
predictive of low venous pressure.
Additional file 2: Video 2. The inferior vena cava (IVC) in long axis in a 
patient with massive acute pulmonary embolism (Videos 1 to 3). In video 
2, the M-mode documents the collapse of IVC during respiration.
Additional file 3: Video 3. The inferior vena cava (IVC) in long axis in 
a patient with massive acute pulmonary embolism (Videos 1 to 3). The 
same view (video 3) in long axis performed with the correct technique 
shows the absence of collapse in the obvious clinical condition of acute 
right strain. The difference is the correct displaying of the IVC in video 
3, which is based on the constant visualization of the inner walls of the 
vessel.

the expanding lung.
Additional file 6: Video 6. Lung ultrasound in a condition of pneu-
mothorax. The movement of the muscles of the chest wall during the 
respiratory effort gives the impression of lung sliding. However, the real 
sliding should be observed against the chest wall and independent from 
the movement of the intercostal muscles.
Additional file 7: Video 7. Lung ultrasound in a condition of pneumo-
thorax. The pulsing movement of the image is due to an intercostal artery 
visualized in long axis, giving the impression of a false pulsation of the 
lung. The real lung pulse should be independent from the movement of 
the chest wall.

pleurodesis abrasion. The septa still connecting the lung to the chest wall 
explain the coexistence of B lines and the absence of sliding in a condition 
of pneumothorax.
