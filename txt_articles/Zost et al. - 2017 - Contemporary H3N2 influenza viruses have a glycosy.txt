H3N2 viruses continuously acquire mutations in the hemagglutinin
(HA) glycoprotein that abrogate binding of human antibodies. During
the 2014–2015 influenza season, clade 3C.2a H3N2 viruses possessing
a new predicted glycosylation site in antigenic site B of HA emerged,
and these viruses remain prevalent today. The 2016–2017 seasonal
influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3C.2a H3N2 strain;
however, the egg-adapted version of this viral strain lacks the new
putative glycosylation site. Here, we biochemically demonstrate that
the HA antigenic site B of circulating clade 3C.2a viruses is glycosy-
lated. We show that antibodies elicited in ferrets and humans ex-
posed to the egg-adapted 2016–2017 H3N2 vaccine strain poorly
neutralize a glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus. Importantly, anti-
bodies elicited in ferrets infected with the current circulating
H3N2 viral strain (that possesses the glycosylation site) and humans
vaccinated with baculovirus-expressed H3 antigens (that possess the
glycosylation site motif) were able to efficiently recognize a glycosy-
lated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus. We propose that differences in glyco-
sylation between H3N2 egg-adapted vaccines and circulating strains
likely contributed to reduced vaccine effectiveness during the 2016–
2017 influenza season. Furthermore, our data suggest that influenza
virus antigens prepared via systems not reliant on egg adaptations
are more likely to elicit protective antibody responses that are not
affected by glycosylation of antigenic site B of H3N2 HA.

nfluenza viruses continuously acquire mutations in exposed
epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
proteins through a process called “antigenic drift” (1). Influenza
vaccine effectiveness can be low when there is a mismatch be-
tween vaccine strains and circulating strains (2). Viral antigens
included in influenza vaccines are routinely updated in an at-
tempt to avoid antigenic mismatches (3, 4). Current seasonal
influenza vaccines possess antigens from one H1N1 strain, one
H3N2 strain, and one or two influenza B strains.
H3N2 viruses began circulating in humans in 1968. Most neu-
tralizing antibodies (Abs) recognize antigenic sites on the globular
head of H3 (designated sites A–E), while rare Abs bind to the
more conserved HA stalk or sialic acid binding domains (5). Most
H3N2 vaccine mismatches from 1968 to 2013 have been attributed
to mutations in antigenic site B of HA (6). None of the site B
mutations that emerged during this time period have led to new
glycosylation sites on HA (6, 7). This is surprising, given that the
addition of glycans on HA can dramatically affect Ab binding (8–
13). Instead, new glycosylation sites have repeatedly emerged and
fixed in other antigenically important regions of H3 (14).
Vaccine effectiveness was extremely low during the 2014–2015
influenza season (15). During that season, influenza vaccines pos-
sessed antigens from a 2012 H3N2 virus that belonged to the 3C.1
HA genetic clade, while the majority of circulating H3N2 strains
belonged to the 3C.2a and 3C.3a genetic clades (16). Both the 3C.2a
and 3C.3a viruses differed at residues in HA antigenic site B com-
pared with the 2014–2015 H3N2 vaccine strain (17). Notably, 3C.2a
viruses that circulated during the 2014–2015 season possessed a new
predicted glycosylation site in HA antigenic site B (17), and the
2014–2015 influenza vaccine exhibited especially low effectiveness
against this clade (18). In an effort to avoid an antigenic mismatch,
the 2016–2017 influenza vaccine was updated to contain antigens
from a 3C.2a H3N2 virus isolated in 2014 (19). The majority of
H3N2 viruses that circulated in the Northern Hemisphere during
the 2016–2017 influenza season were 3C.2a viruses; however, an
interim estimate of vaccine effectiveness was only 43% against
medically attended H3N2 infections (20). Vaccine effectiveness was
especially low in individuals that were 18–49 y old (20). It is unclear
why there was variable vaccine effectiveness during the 2016–
2017 influenza season, given that the vaccine strain appeared to be
well matched to most circulating strains.
The majority of antigens for influenza vaccines are prepared in
fertilized chicken eggs, and the 2016–2017 egg-adapted 3C.2a
vaccine strain lacks the site B glycosylation site that is present on
circulating 3C.2a H3N2 strains (21). Here, we completed a series
Significance
The majority of influenza vaccine antigens are prepared in
chicken eggs. Human vaccine strains grown in eggs often possess
adaptive mutations that increase viral attachment to chicken
cells. Most of these adaptive mutations are in the hemagglutinin
protein, which functions as a viral attachment factor. Here, we
identify a hemagglutinin mutation in the current egg-adapted
H3N2 vaccine strain that alters antigenicity. We show that ferrets
and humans exposed to the current egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine
strain produce antibodies that poorly neutralize H3N2 viruses
that circulated during the 2016–2017 influenza season. These
studies highlight the challenges associated with producing in-
fluenza vaccine antigens in eggs, while offering a potential ex-
planation of why there was only moderate vaccine effectiveness
during the 2016–2017 influenza season.

 of studies to determine whether the difference in glycosylation of
HA antigenic site B of H3N2 vaccine strains and circulating
strains contributed to a previously unrecognized vaccine mis-
match during the 2016–2017 influenza season.
Results
Recent H3N2 Viruses Possess a Glycosylation Site in Antigenic Site B
of HA. A K160T HA mutation rapidly rose to fixation during the
2014–2015 influenza season, and nearly all currently circulating
H3N2 viruses possess threonine (T) at HA residue 160 (Fig. 1A).
The K160T HA mutation is predicted to introduce an N-linked
glycosylation site in antigenic site B of HA (Fig. 1B and Table
S1). H3N2 viruses with the K160T HA mutation grow poorly in
chicken eggs (21), and the 2016–2017 egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine
strain possesses a T160K HA reversion mutation [reference: Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) isolate ID
EPI_ISL_189811]. We used reverse genetics to create H3N2 viruses
possessing HAs with T160 and K160, and we completed Western
blot analyses to determine whether the T160 and K160 HAs migrate
differently in SDS/PAGE gels. HAs with T160 migrated with a
higher molecular weight compared with HAs with K160 (Fig. 1C,
Left). The HAs migrated similarly after PNGase treatment (Fig. 1C,
Right), indicating that the difference in HA mobility in the absence
of PNGase is due to differences in N-linked glycosylation.
To determine whether the addition of this new antigenic site B
glycan in HA affects antigenicity, we tested the binding of a panel of
26 human monoclonal antibodies that were elicited against an
H3 virus from 2009, which lacks the new glycosylation site in an-
tigenic site B of HA. All of these monoclonal antibodies bound to
the HA of a 2009 virus (Fig. 2). The majority of these monoclonal
antibodies (77%) bound to a 2014 virus with the egg-adaptive K160
HA (which lacks the glycosylation site), while only a few (23%)
bound to a 2014 virus with T160 (which possesses the glycosylation
site) (Fig. 2A). Raw binding data of a monoclonal antibody (024-
10128-3C04) that binds efficiently to virus with K160 HA but not
T160 HA is shown in Fig. 2B. As a control, we also measured
binding of an HA stalk-reactive monoclonal antibody that effi-
ciently recognizes virus with either T160 HA or K160 HA (Fig. 1C).
Together, these data demonstrate that current circulating H3N2
influenza viruses possess a new glycosylation site in antigenic site B
of HA that affects antigenicity, and that this glycosylation site is not
present in current egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strains.
Antibodies Elicited in Ferrets Exposed to the 2016–2017 Egg-Adapted
H3N2 Vaccine Strain Poorly Neutralize a Circulating H3N2 Viral Strain.
We next completed a series of experiments to determine whether
the current egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain (that possesses
K160) elicits different types of antibodies compared with the
current circulating H3N2 viral strain (that possesses T160). We
infected ferrets with viruses possessing either K160 HA or T160
HA, and we completed foci reduction neutralization tests
(FRNTs) using sera collected from these animals 28 d after in-
fection. We completed FRNT assays rather than conventional
hemagglutination–inhibition assays since 3C2.a H3N2 viruses
inefficiently agglutinate red blood cells. Antibodies elicited by
the egg-adapted vaccine strain possessing K160 HA recognized
the egg-adapted vaccine strain fourfold to eightfold more effi-
ciently than the currently circulating H3N2 strain that possesses
T160 HA (Fig. 3A). This indicates that a large proportion of
ferret antibodies elicited by the current egg-adapted H3N2 vac-
cine strain recognize the unglycosylated antigenic site B of HA.
Interestingly, antibodies elicited by infection with the current
circulating H3N2 viral strain possessing T160 HA recognized
viruses with T160 HA and K160 HA equally (Fig. 3B). This is
consistent with the hypothesis that the new HA glycosylation site
effectively “shields” antigenic site B of HA, and that antibodies
elicited by the viral strain possessing the new HA glycosylation
site recognize epitopes not involving antigenic site B of HA.
Antibodies Elicited in Humans Vaccinated with the Egg-Adapted H3N2
Strain Poorly Neutralize a Circulating H3N2 Viral Strain. We com-
pleted additional antigenic tests using sera isolated from humans
(18–49 y old) before and after vaccination during the 2016–
2017 influenza season. Although the majority of influenza

MICROBIOLOGY
 vaccine antigens are prepared in fertilized chicken eggs, a small
fraction of vaccine antigens are produced in insect cells or canine
kidney cells. To account for this, we measured human antibody re-
sponses elicited by vaccine antigens prepared in eggs (Fluzone; n =
22 donors), MDCK cells (Flucelvax; n = 26 donors), and insect cells
(Flublok; n = 22 donors). Importantly, the H3 antigens in the Flu-
zone and Flucelvax vaccines possess the egg-adapted K160 HA,
while the recombinant H3 antigen in the Flublok vaccine possesses
T160 HA.
Vaccine effectiveness was lower in younger adults compared
with older adults during the 2016–2017 season (20). Interestingly,
we found that younger adults had higher prevaccination titers to
the egg-adapted K160 HA compared with older individuals
(Spearman’s rho = 0.3, P < 0.01; raw data from three independent
experiments are shown in Table S2). Following vaccination, K160
HA titers were also higher in younger adults compared with older
individuals (Spearman’s rho = 0.4), even after adjusting for higher
prevaccination titers to K160 HA (Table S3). We speculate that
the observed age-related differences in antibody titers to K160 HA
might be due to birth year-related differences in H3N2 exposure
history. Antibody titers to T160 HA were lower than antibody ti-
ters to K160 HA both before and after vaccination (P < 10−10 for
each, Wilcox rank sum test), but there were no birth year-related
effects on antibody titers to T160 HA (P = 0.23 prevaccination, P =
0.33 postvaccination; Table S3).
Some individuals in our study mounted strong antibody re-
sponses against T160 HA following vaccination (Table S2). Im-
portantly, the majority of these individuals received the Flublok
vaccine that possesses T160 HA (Fig. 4A). Antibody titers
against T160 HA increased approximately fourfold following
vaccination with Flublok, whereas there were only minimal in-
creases in T160 HA antibody reactivity in most individuals
following vaccination with Fluzone and Flucelvax (Fig. 4A).
Conversely, antibody increases against the K160 HA were similar
following vaccination with the three different vaccine antigens
(Fig. 4B). These differential effects of the vaccines remained
statistically significant after adjusting for age, prevaccination ti-
ter, and vaccination history (Table S3). These data indicate that
H3N2 vaccine antigens produced during the 2016–2017 influenza
season in eggs and MDCK cells (that possess K160 HA) elicit
antibody responses that react poorly to current circulating
H3N2 virus strains, whereas H3N2 vaccine antigens produced in
insect cells (that possess T160 HA) elicit antibody responses that
react efficiently to current circulating H3N2 viral strains.
The Effect of Repeat Vaccination on Anti-H3 Antibody Responses
During the 2016–2017 Influenza Season. Many individuals receive
influenza vaccines every year; however, recent data suggest that
repetitive vaccinations may be associated with reduced antibody
responses (22–24) and reduced vaccine effectiveness (25–27)
during some influenza seasons. To determine whether prior
vaccinations impacted the development of H3 antibodies fol-
lowing vaccination of donors in our study, we examined neu-
tralizing antibody data in relation to vaccine history. Donors in
our study self-reported vaccination history in the previous two
seasons (2012–2013 and 2013–2014). We excluded individuals
who reported having received the live attenuated vaccine in
previous seasons (n = 1) and individuals who did not remember
their vaccination status in either season (n = 7), and then we
grouped individuals into three categories: unvaccinated both
seasons, vaccinated in only one season, and vaccinated in both
seasons. Interestingly, vaccination history was uncorrelated with
prevaccine titers to T160 HA and K160 HA, but it was the
strongest independent predictor of final antibody titers and fold

Individuals that had been vaccinated in the previous 2 y exhibited
overall lower antibody boosts (Fig. S1), after adjusting for age
and prevaccination antibody titers (Table S3).
Discussion
It is unclear why there was only moderate vaccine effectiveness
during the 2016–2017 influenza season, given that the 2016–
2017 vaccine strains appeared to be well matched to most circulating
viral strains (20). Our data suggest that a mismatch in antigenic site
B of H3N2 viruses, caused by the propagation of the vaccine strain
in eggs, likely contributed to this low vaccine effectiveness. When
influenza viruses are passaged in new hosts, antigenic properties of
hemagglutinin can change since many residues of this protein are
involved with both receptor binding and antibody recognition (28–
31). This is not the first example of antigenic properties of influenza
viruses being altered by egg adaptations. In 1978, Kilbourne (32)
showed that there were two antigenically distinct viruses in the 1976
X-53 swine influenza vaccine and that these viruses had different
growth properties in chicken embryos and canine kidney cells. In
1983, Webster and coworkers (33) demonstrated that influenza B
viruses acquire mutations that alter antigenicity when propagated in
chicken eggs. Egg adaptations resulting in antigenic changes have
also been reported for H3N2 viruses (34–37). It has been proposed
that H3N2 egg adaptations contributed to low vaccine effectiveness
during the 2012–2013 influenza season (38), although this remains
controversial (39).
Nonetheless, the majority of influenza vaccine antigens con-
tinue to be prepared in eggs (4). One solution to the problem of
egg adaptations is to simply produce influenza antigens via a
baculovirus system or in cell culture. The baculovirus system
seems particularly well suited to avoid adaptive mutations; how-
ever, there are also potential problems with this approach. HA
antigens prepared in insect cells are glycosylated with less complex
sugars compared with mammalian cells (40), and it is possible that
this affects antigenicity. In our study, some individuals vaccinated
with baculovirus-prepared Flublok (that possessed T160 HA)
mounted strong antibody responses that effectively neutralized a
virus possessing an HA with a glycosylated antigenic site B;
however, some Flublok-vaccinated individuals mounted antibody
responses that reacted poorly to viruses with T160 HA.
It is important to note that there is more HA antigen in Flu-
blok vaccine formulations compared with conventional egg-
based vaccine formulations. It is possible that the increased
amount of antigen in Flublok contributed to higher antibody
responses against viruses that possess T160 HA; however, this is
likely not the case since compared with the other vaccines tested,
Flublok did not induce a significantly greater response to K160
HA. Therefore, Flublok did not generate an overall higher an-
tibody response in our study, but rather an antibody response
that was better able to recognize viruses possessing T160 HA.
This is interesting in light of a recent study demonstrating that
the Flublok vaccine elicited more protective antibody responses
in older adults compared with egg-based vaccines during the
2014–2015 season (41). This warrants further investigation be-
cause there was a large H3 antigenic mismatch during this season
(17). It is possible that the Flublok vaccine elicited antibodies of
different specificities compared with egg-based vaccines during
the 2014–2015 influenza season, perhaps to epitopes involving
conserved residues of the HA receptor binding pocket.
Cell culture-expressed HA antigen might also avoid problems
associated with egg adaptations. The 2017–2018 recommended
H3N2 component is the same as the 2016–2017 recommended
H3N2 component, but, starting this year, vaccine manufacturers
that prepare antigens via cell culture systems will be allowed to
use viral strains that have not been previously adapted to grow in
eggs (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/cell-based.htm). H3N2
vaccine strains grown in this new system may possess HAs with a
glycosylated antigenic site B, although mutations that abrogate
this glycosylation site have been previously reported upon serial
passage of clade 3C.2a H3N2 viruses in MDCK cells (21).
Interim reports indicate that the 2016–2017 vaccine protected
younger individuals from H3N2 infection less effectively com-
pared with older individuals (20). In our study, we found that
younger adults were more likely to produce antibodies that effi-
ciently neutralized K160 HA but weakly neutralized T160 HA
after vaccination. These age-related differences may be due to

Ferrets elicit different types of antibody responses when exposed to
H3 viruses with K160 HA and T160 HA. Ferrets (n = 3 animals per group)
were infected with viruses possessing (A) K160 HA or (B) T160 HA and sera
were collected 28 d later. FRNTs were completed using viruses that possessed
K160 HA or T160 HA. Neutralization titers are expressed as inverse dilution
of sera that reduced foci by 90%. We completed three independent ex-
periments with each sera. Shown are geometric means from the three in-
dependent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using a
paired Student’s t test.

MICROBIOLOGY
 differences in prior exposure histories. It is clear that prior in-
fluenza exposures can affect how an individual responds to new
antigenically distinct viral strains (42). For example, individuals
exposed to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain produce antibodies
that target epitopes that are conserved in previously circulating
seasonal H1N1 viral strains (43–46), particularly viral strains that
they were likely exposed to in childhood. Early childhood infec-
tions also likely impact susceptibility to pandemic influenza virus
strains. Gostic et al. (47) recently demonstrated that early child-
hood infections with either H1N1 or H3N2 influenza viruses are
associated with protection from H5N1 and H7N9 viruses later in
life, presumably through induction of cross-reactive antibodies
against epitopes that are conserved between these different viru-
ses. Further studies should explore if early childhood antigenic
“imprinting” with different H3N2 viral strains affects the speci-
ficity of antibodies elicited by seasonal influenza vaccination.
Vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 is often low (2), especially
among repeat vaccinees (25–27). Antigenic mismatch due to in-
correct strain selection is an established cause of low vaccine ef-
fectiveness (2). Future studies should address whether egg-adapted
mutations constitute another form of antigenic mismatch that alters
vaccine effectiveness in other influenza virus seasons. Antigens with
egg-adapted mismatches might recall preexisting immune re-
sponses, including responses to previous vaccines. A major effort
should be made to develop and utilize new systems that produce
influenza antigens that are not dependent on egg or cell culture-
adaptive mutations. Antigens that do not possess adaptive muta-
tions will likely offer better protection against influenza virus strains
that circulate in the human population.
Materials and Methods
Viruses. The HA gene of a representative clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus (A/Colorado/
15/2014) was cloned into the vector pHW2000, and the T160K mutation was
introduced to remove the predicted glycosylation motif. Viruses containing
H3 and N2 genes with A/Puerto Rico/34/1934 internal genes were rescued
using the influenza reverse-genetics system by transfecting a coculture of
293T and MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Transfection supernatants were collected 3 d
after transfection and stored at −80 °C for use in neutralization assays. HA
and NA genes of virus expansions grown on MDCK-SIAT1 cells were se-
quenced to confirm that no additional mutations arose during transfection.
Glycosylation Western Blotting and Glycan Modeling. Viruses possessing T160
and K160 HA were expanded on MDCK-SIAT1 cells and then concentrated at
20,000 rpm (72,128 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C using an SW-28 rotor (Beckman
Coulter). The amount of HA in each sample was normalized by ELISA with a
human anti-HA monoclonal antibody for subsequent SDS/PAGE and Western
blotting. To cleave N-linked glycans, samples were treated with PNGase-F
(New England Biolabs) under reducing conditions. PNGase-treated and un-
treated samples were run on SDS/PAGE gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blots were
probed using anti-HA tag primary antibody clone HA-7 (product number
59658; Sigma-Aldrich) and an anti-mouse secondary antibody (product num-
ber 926-32212; Licor). To structurally model the N158 glycosylation introduced
by T160, a K160T mutation was introduced into the crystal structure (PDB ID
code 4O5I) using the program PyMol. Basic N-linked glycans were added to
predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the crystal structure using the GlyProt
web server: www.glycosciences.de/modeling/glyprot/php/main.php.
Human Monoclonal Antibody Binding. Human monoclonal antibodies were
previously isolated from donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells following
vaccination with the 2010–2011 influenza vaccine (48). ELISA plates were
coated overnight at 4 °C with a 2009 virus (A/Victoria/210/2009; the
H3N2 component of the 2010–2011 influenza vaccine), a glycosylated
2014 clade 3C2.a virus with T160 HA, or an unglycosylated 2014 clade 3C2.a
virus with K160 HA. ELISA plates were blocked with a 3% (wt/vol) BSA so-
lution in PBS for 2 h. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing
0.1% Tween 20, and serial dilutions of each monoclonal antibody in ELISA
buffer [1% BSA (wt/vol) in PBS] were added to plates in 1% BSA in PBS. After
2 h of incubation, plates were again washed and a peroxidase-conjugated
anti-human secondary antibody (product number 109-036-098; Jackson
ImmunoResearch) diluted in ELISA buffer was added. After a 1-h incubation,
plates were washed, and a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate
(product number 50–00-03; Seracare) was added. The TMB reaction was
stopped by adding HCl, and absorbance was measured using a plate reader.
One-site specific binding curves were fitted in Prism software and the
maximal binding against the 2009 vaccine strain was calculated for each
monoclonal antibody. After background subtraction (from ELISA plates that
did not have coated virus), binding of each monoclonal antibody relative to
the vaccine strain was determined using the absorbance values at the lowest
concentration of antibody that gave greater than 90% of maximal binding
against the vaccine strain. Equivalent coating of each virus was checked
using the stalk-reactive DY-2F04 monoclonal antibody.
Ferret Sera. Ferret antisera were prepared at the Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited company Noble Life
Sciences using protocols approved by the Noble Life Sciences Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Naive Fitch ferrets were intranasally in-
fected with 2 × 105 PFU of virus expressing either K160 HA or T160 HA.
Serum samples were collected before infection and 28 d following infection.
Sera used in antigenic assays were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme
(Denka Seiken) for 2 h at 37 °C, and the enzyme was then heat-inactivated at
55 °C for 30 min.
Human Sera. Experiments using human sera were conducted with the ap-
proval of the University of Rochester and University of Pennsylvania In-
stitutional Review Boards. Informed consent was obtained for all individuals
enrolled. Serum samples were collected at the University of Rochester before
and 28 d following vaccination. Serological experiments were completed at
the University of Pennsylvania using deidentified samples. Before assays, sera
samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken) for
2 h at 37 °C, and the enzyme was then heat-inactivated at 55 °C for 30 min.

Vaccine antigens possessing K160 HA and
T160 HA elicit different responses in humans. Donors
were vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines,
and sera were collected before and 28 d after vac-
cination. FRNTs were completed using viruses that
possessed T160 HA or K160 HA. (A) Flublok induced
higher fold changes to T160 HA than did Flucelvax
and Fluzone (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04 in adjusted
analysis, respectively; Table S3; ns, nonsignificant).
(B) The vaccine types did not differ in their ability to
induce responses to K160 HA (P > 0.1 in adjusted
analysis; Table S3). Thick horizontal lines show the
median fold changes of the geometric mean titers.
Colored rectangles indicate the interquartile range,
and whiskers indicate the 150% interquartile ranges.

 FRNT Assays. Serum samples were serially diluted in 96-well round-bottom plates
containing serum-free media. Approximately 200 focus-forming units of reverse-
genetics transfection supernatant of each virus were added to each diluted sera
sample and the virus–sera mixtures were incubated at room temperature for
1 h. The virus–sera mixtures were then added to confluent monolayers of
MDCK-SIAT1 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, cells were
washed with serum-free media and an overlay medium of serum-free media
containing 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), gentamycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 0.5% (wt/vol)
methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to cells. Infected monolayers were
incubated for 18 h, after which the overlay medium was aspirated and the cells
were fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol–acetone [1:1 (vol/vol)].
Infected monolayers were stained with anti-NP monoclonal antibody IC5-1B7
(product number NR-43899; BEI Reagent Resources) and an anti-mouse per-
oxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (product number 855563; MP Bio-
medicals). A TMB substrate (product number 5510-0030; Seracare) was added
to visualize foci. Following staining, plates were imaged and foci were quan-
tified using an ELISPOT reader (Cellular Technologies Limited). FRNT90 titers
were reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that reduced the
number of foci by at least 90%, relative to control wells that had no serum or
monoclonal antibody added. Undetectable titers were assigned a value of 10.
All FRNT assays were repeated three times on separate days.
Models of Initial and Final Antibody Titers and Fold Responses. Three replicate
measurements of prevaccination and postvaccination antibody titers from
each serum sample (Table S2) were geometrically averaged, and the geo-
metric mean titers were used for model fitting. Linear models that included
age and vaccination history (receipt of trivalent inactivated vaccine in nei-
ther, only one, or both of the last 2 y) were fitted to log2 prevaccination
titers as continuous and factor variables, respectively. Models were similarly
fitted to log2 postvaccination antibody titers, also including log2 prevacci-
nation titers and vaccine group (Flublok, Flucelvax, and Fluzone) as contin-
uous and factor variables, respectively. Likelihood maximization was
performed with the lm package in R, version 3.3.1. Code for the analysis is
available at https://cobeylab.github.io/H3N2_glycosylation/.
