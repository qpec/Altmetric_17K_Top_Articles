People with low income often experience higher exposures to air pollutants. We compared the exposure to par-
ticulate matter (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10), Black Carbon (BC) and ultrafine particles (PNCs; 0.02–1 μm) for typical
commutes by car, bus and underground from 4 London areas with different levels of income deprivation (G1
to G4, from most to least deprived). The highest BC and PM concentrations were found in G1 while the highest
PNC in G3. Lowest concentrations for all pollutants were observed in G2. We found no systematic relationship be-
tween income deprivation and pollutant concentrations, suggesting that differences between transport modes
are a stronger influence. The underground showed the highest PM concentrations, followed by buses and a
much lower concentrations in cars. BC concentrations in the underground were overestimated due to Fe interfer-
ence. BC concentrations were also higher in buses than cars because of a lower infiltration of outside pollutants
into the car cabin. PNCs were highest in buses, closely followed by cars, but lowest in underground due to the ab-
sence of combustion sources. Concentration in the road modes (car and bus) were governed by the traffic condi-
tions (such as traffic flow interruptions) at the specific road section. Exposures were reduced in trains with non-
openable windows compared to those with openable windows. People from less income-deprived areas have a
predominant use of car, receiving the lowest doses (RDD b 1 μg h−1) during commute but generating the largest
emissions per commuter. Conversely, commuters from high income-deprived areas have a major reliance on the
bus, receiving higher exposures (RDD between 1.52 and 3.49 μg h−1) while generating less emission per person.
These findings suggest an aspect of environmental injustice and a need to incorporate the socioeconomic dimen-
sion in life-course exposure assessments.

1. Introduction
Air pollution is considered a major threat to human health because
of its link to an increased mortality and loss of disability-adjusted life
years (GBD 2013 Risk Factor Collaborators, 2015). Combustion emis-
sions, especially particles in various size ranges, are suspected to be par-
ticularly harmful (Heal et al., 2012; HEI Panel on the Health Effects of
Traffic-Related Air Pollution, 2010; WHO, 2013). Black carbon (BC) is
considered a better tracer of traffic emissions than particulate matter
(PM) mass (Reche et al., 2011; WHO, 2012), especially for diesel-fuelled
vehicles. Owing to their size, ultrafine particles (b100 nm) may affect
human health more strongly than larger-sized particles (Chen et al.,
2016a, 2016b; Kumar et al., 2014; Lanzinger et al., 2016) and should
be included in exposure assessments next to other pollutants.
Commuters are particularly affected by traffic-related air pollutants
owing to their proximity to the source. BC and particle number concen-
trations (PNCs) represent ultrafine particles, which decrease exponen-
tially downwind away from the road/highway (Fujitani et al., 2012;
Kim et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2002). Such gradients are
much weaker for PM10 (PM ≤ 10 μm) and PM2.5 (PM ≤ 2.5 μm; Goel
and Kumar, 2016; Kumar and Goel, 2016). Stationary monitoring sta-
tions provide a general view of actual fluctuation in air pollutants to
which inhabitants are exposed (Chen et al., 2016a, 2016b; Reche et al.,
2011). Such monitoring networks only provide a partial insight in per-
sonal exposure since this differs greatly with activity, location and
time spent on each activity (Bekö et al., 2015; Buonanno et al., 2013;
Rivas et al., 2016). Therefore, exposure assessment during commuting
deserves special attention.
The miniaturisation of air pollution monitors has allowed the prolif-
eration of personal measurements studies in different transport micro-
environments over the few last years (Table S1). The studies have
shown that commuters come in contact with highly variable concentra-
tions of atmospheric pollutants and face short-time extreme peak con-
centrations that results in significant contributions by commuting to

 the total daily exposure (12–32% of daily exposure; Dons et al., 2011;
Rivas et al., 2016; Williams and Knibbs, 2016). Further, the exposure
during commuting is highly affected by individual mode of transport.
Comparison among studies is challenging owing to variability in the
methods used for sampling and different conditions in each transport
mode (such as ventilation rates and fuel type; Goel and Kumar, 2015a;
Karanasiou et al., 2014; Kaur et al., 2007). Moreno et al. (2015a,
2015b) reported the following hierarchy for PNC in different transport
microenvironments
with
data
from
various
studies:
urban
background b underground b tram b walking in a suburban main
road b walking and cycling in the city centre b bus. However, this hier-
archy might differ for other pollutants. For example, the highest PM
concentrations are expected to be found in the underground (Adams
et al., 2001; Martins et al., 2016a). Concentrations of PM2.5 were lower
in buses than in cars in Barcelona (de Nazelle et al., 2012) and Arnhem
(Zuurbier et al., 2010), but a reverse situation was reported in
London (Adams et al., 2001) and Dublin (McNabola et al., 2008).
Consequently, more studies, such as this work, are needed to identify
the parameters affecting pollutant concentrations in different transport
microenvironments.
The distribution of air pollutants has been found to be inequitable,
with people living in most deprived areas generally suffering from
higher concentrations of air pollutants (Fecht et al., 2015; Kingham et
al., 2007; Wheeler and Ben-Shlomo, 2005; WHO, 2010; Yu and Stuart,
2016). The field of environmental justice has been notably explored in
the U.S.A., where poorer people or ethnic minorities are exposed to
higher air pollutant concentrations (Bullard, 2015; Hackbarth et al.,
2011; Houston et al., 2004; Yu and Stuart, 2016). A smaller number of
studies are available for European countries (Barceló et al., 2009;
Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2016), sometimes with inconclusive results
(Padilla et al., 2014; Wheeler and Ben-Shlomo, 2005) or reverse be-
tween socioeconomic status and air pollutants concentrations
(Forastiere et al., 2007; Germani et al., 2014). In the UK, Fecht et al.
(2015) found an association between PM10 concentrations and depriva-
tion in England, with the most vulnerable groups encountering higher
concentrations. However, in a between neighbourhood comparison,
both Fecht et al. (2015) and Goodman et al. (2011) observed a nonlinear
relationship as people in the higher social class would accept high levels
of air pollution to take advantage of the benefits offered in city central
areas. Jephcote and Chen (2012) found that children in lower social
class households in Leicester tend to live in areas experiencing high
levels of road transport emissions which were caused to a substantial
extent by the private transport of affluent communities living in areas
with low emissions.
Unlike available studies, this work assesses the inequalities in expo-
sure to air pollutants during commuting using real-time personal mea-
surements, thus providing a precise input of exposure concentrations.
The main objective of this work is to determine if there are inequalities
related to income deprivation in the exposure during commuting to dif-
ferent fractions of PM, BC and PNC in London. To this end, different
routes in different transport modes were assessed, with the routes
being typical commuting routes for inhabitants from 4 areas with differ-
ent level of income deprivation (G1 to G4, representing from most to
least deprived). Furthermore, we have assessed the differences between
transport modes (car, underground and bus) and different daytime pe-
riods (morning and afternoon rush hour, midday non-rush hour) in
order to identify the main drivers of exposure during commuting.
2. Methodology
2.1. Study area
The study was carried out in Greater London (Fig. S1), which has an
area of 1572 km2 and around 8 million inhabitants (Office for National
Statistics, 2014), making it one of the largest cities in Europe.
In March 2016, London counted 3.3 million registered vehicles
(2098 veh km−2), of which 2.8 million were cars (1809 cars km−2;
Department for Transport, 2016).
2.2. Route selection
2.2.1. Datasets used for the route selection
Two different datasets were used for the selection of the origin and
destination of our routes. One was the 2015 Index of Multiple Depriva-
tion (IMD; Department for Communities and Local Government, 2015),
which is the official measure of relative deprivation for small areas in
England. The index consists of a basket of indicators from seven do-
mains (which measure different dimensions of deprivation) to produce
an overall relative measure of deprivation. The second dataset was the
2011 Census Special Workplace Statistics (Census Support Flow Data,
2011), which includes commuting counts (location of usual residence
and place of work by method of travel to work). Both datasets report
statistics at a small area level, the Lower Layer Super Output Area
(LSOA), which represent homogeneous neighbourhoods in terms of
key demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.
From the seven domains of IMD (Smith et al., 2015), we selected the
Income Deprivation Score to classify the LSOA areas within the Greater
London into 4 different groups (G1 to G4, from most to least deprived,
with G1 and G4 representing the 10% most and least deprived, respec-
tively; Table S2). The Income Deprivation domain is not an individual
measure of affluence but identifies aspects of income deprivation at
the small area level and was selected to ease replication in other coun-
tries. The spatial distribution of both the Income Deprivation and the
IMD score are presented in Supplementary Information Figs. S2 and
S3, respectively. There is a strong correlation across London for both in-
dexes, suggesting that similar results could be expected if IMD would be
used instead.
2.2.2. Selection of the origins, the destination and the routes
We aimed to select typical commutes for areas of residence with dif-
ferent levels of income deprivation. We selected one workplace area
that is a frequent destination for commutes from origins in all depriva-
tion classes (area with highest employment density). The destination
point was within the City of London (LSOA name: City of London
001F), which is the financial district (Fig. 1).
For the single destination, we selected four origins, one in each dep-
rivation class (Fig. 1). For each income group (G1–G4), we calculated the
average Euclidean distance that the inhabitants commute in order to get
to the selected destination, according to the origin-destination informa-
tion reported in the Census Support Flow Data (2011). An increasing
distance was observed from the most to the least deprived (Table 1). Af-
terward, a random LSOA at the corresponding average distance from the
destination was selected as the origin for each of the four income cate-
gories. The origin point of the route was then chosen within the selected
LSOAs, obtaining 4 origin-destination (O-D) pairs.
According to the Census Support Flow Data (2011), across all groups,
the dominant modes were car (private), underground and bus (Table 1)
and, accordingly, these three transport modes were assessed in this
work. For each of the 4 O-D pairs, we monitored the fastest route for
each transport mode (Fig. 1). Table S2 indicates the specifications for
each of the routes (main roads used for car, and bus and underground
lines). The same underground lines in opposite directions were taken
for G1 and G3 (Northern line, with part of G1 also in Victoria line) and
for G2 and G4 (District line).
2.3. Instrumentation and sampling design
This work has been focused on the assessment of the exposure to
particulate pollutants. Gaseous pollutants are also an important threat
to human health, but for practical reasons and because of their potential
health effect we selected to monitor PM1, PM2.5, PM10, BC and PNC. A
GRIMM EDM 107 (GRIMM Technologies Inc.) aerosol spectrometer

 was employed for personal PM measurements during commuting. The
instrument provided PM mass concentrations in 31 different size chan-
nels at a time resolution of 6 s, but was afterwards averaged into 10 s to
match the averaging period set on the rest of the instruments. More-
over, the GRIMM collects particles on a PTFE filter, allowing chemical
and morphological analysis of the particles. This instrument has been
widely used for monitoring PM concentration, including mobile mea-
surements (Azarmi and Kumar, 2016; Grimm and Eatough, 2009).
PNC in the 0.02–1 μm size range were measured by the portable P-
Trak 8525 (TSI Inc.), which has been successfully used for personal ex-
posure monitoring (Aarnio et al., 2005; Delfino et al., 2005; Kaur et al.,
2005). Traffic emissions contribute importantly to particles in the nucle-
ation mode (b20 nm; Gidhagen et al., 2005; Kumar et al., 2008a, 2008b;
Wehner et al., 2002), which are below the lower threshold for the par-
ticle size of the P-Trak. The deposition losses in our setting (length of the
tube: 1.2 m, T = 286.1 K) for particles in the 20–100 nm range were al-
ways below 5%, and for particles between 100 and 1000 nm below 1%,
according to the Hinds turbulent model (Hinds, 1999; Kumar et al.,
2008b). Therefore, deposition losses in sampling tubes in our work
have a small impact on final PNC measured by P-Trak. For this study,
we set the averaging period for PNC data to 10s.
BC concentrations were monitored with a portable MicroAeth AE51
(AethLabs), which has been widely used for personal exposure assess-
ment (Buonanno et al., 2013; de Nazelle et al., 2012; Dons et al., 2011;
Moreno et al., 2015b; Rivas et al., 2016) and positively evaluated against
reference stationary instruments (Viana et al., 2015). The effect of filter
loading was minimised by replacing the filter strips before every trip
and setting a flow rate of 100 ml min−1. The time-base was set to
10 s. For high time resolution, instrumental optical and electronic
noise can cause the attenuation (ATN) values to remain unchanged or
slightly diminish from one timestamp to the next (the latter, leading
to negative BC concentrations). Therefore, the original data was then
post-processed with the Optimised Noise-reduction Averaging algo-
rithm (ONA; Hagler et al., 2011), which smoothens the BC time series
through a user-specified minimum change in attenuation (ΔATNmin).
The position of the field worker was continuously recorded on a sec-
ond basis using a Global Positioning System (GPS; Garmin Oregon 350).
The instruments were carried in a specially conditioned bag, with the
inlets positioned at the breathing height of the field worker (Fig. S4).
The bag was carried on the back while walking or standing in the under-
ground or buses. If the field worker could have a seat, the bag was
placed on the lap in such a way that the inlets were still at breathing

 height. During car measurements, the bag was securely placed on the
front passenger seat.
The trips were generally bi-modal since short distances needed to be
walked to complete the commuting (i.e. from origin/destination ad-
dress to the nearest bus/underground station) and, therefore, included
different sub-microenvironments. Besides commuting, 15 min of sta-
tionary measurements were carried out at the origin point before
starting the trip, 15 min at the destination point, and 15 more minutes
at the origin when back from the returning trip. This procedure allowed
us to take into account the inter-day variability of background concen-
trations. We completed a time-location diary for every trip, where we
registered the time for all the movements (e.g., start/end time of the
trip, time when arriving at the bus stop/underground station) and
identified the main locations/sub-microenvironments affecting the
exposure during commuting.
All the car measurements were made with a petrol-fuelled Peugeot
208 Active 1.2 VTI 82 HP (registered in 2013). Car windows were kept
closed and the ventilation settings were at 50% fan velocity and no air
recirculation. We had no control over the ventilation conditions in the
public transport modes (i.e. bus and underground) but we registered
this information. For bus, we noted if the windows of the vehicle were
open. The field worker always sat in the lower deck of the bus, on the
first or second row of seats behind the rear door. If no seats were avail-
able, the field worker was standing within the same area. We consid-
ered two important variables for the underground measurements: (i)
if windows were open or if they were non-openable and with mechan-
ical ventilation; and (ii) whether the platform or train were located in or
passing through an uncovered (open and above ground) or covered
(underground) area.
2.4. Data collection and processing
The fieldwork was performed over a total of 40 days between 25
February and 17 June 2016 at 3 different daytime periods (starting at
07:45, 12:00 and 16:30 h local time). We monitored a total of 117
round trips (origin – destination – origin; corresponding to 232 one-
way trips; Table 2). The trips were equally distributed among the 4 dif-
ferent income deprivation areas (25% each group) and among the day
periods (morning = 32%, afternoon = 34%, evening = 33%). More
trips in car and underground were monitored since those are the
prevalent modes (car = 38%, underground = 41%, bus = 21%). Two re-
turn trips were cancelled owing to disruption on the underground and
bus service. We measured a total of 225 h of trip monitoring data,
from which 98.7% of PM, 99.4% of BC and 91.9% of PNC data was avail-
able for analysis. In addition, a total of 66 h data were also monitored
at the origin and destination points.
We determined the PM respiratory deposition doses (RDD) for dif-
ferent PM fractions according to the methodology presented in our ear-
lier work (Azarmi and Kumar, 2016; Kumar and Goel, 2016). In brief,
RDD is estimated according to Eq. (1), which is adapted from ICRP
(1994):
RDD ¼ ∑VRi;a � DF j;k � C j;k
ð1Þ
where VRi,a is the ventilation rate for the ith individual (depends on
age and sex) during activity a; DFj,k and PMj,k are the Deposition Fraction
and PM mass concentration for each of the jth PM fraction in the trans-
port sub-microenvironment k, respectively. Hourly RDD were calculat-
ed for each sub-microenvironment, as well as the RDD per trip when
multiplying the hourly RDD for the time spent in each sub-microenvi-
ronment (ti,k). Since DFs are not directly proportional to the mass con-
centration, these were calculated with the corresponding mass
median diameter (MMD) according to equations presented in Hinds
(1999). Table S3 provides the values of the different parameters and fur-
ther equations used for the calculations of RDD.
The data management and statistical analyses were performed with
the R statistical software (v 3.0.2, R Core Team, 2016) and the packages
openair (Carslaw and Ropkins, 2012) and dunn.test (Dinno, 2015).
ArcGIS 10.1 (Esri Inc.) was employed for the calculation of distances,
and for generating the concentration maps.
2.5. SEM and EDS analyses
Total PM mass was collected on 47 mm PTFE filters using GRIMM
1.107. A total of 4 samples were collected, one for each transport
mode and a blank filter for reference. After carbon coating, particles
were characterised using a JEOL SEM (model JSM-7100F, Japan) with a
spatial resolution of 1.2 nm at 30 kV and 3.0 nm at 1 kV. The JEOL SEM
was equipped with EDS, thus being able to obtain information on mor-
phology and elemental composition of the particles. Samples were

20.9 μg m−3). Hereafter, when referring to the general term “PM” we
are indicating that the statement is followed by the three fractions
(PM1, PM2.5 and PM10). PM and PNC concentrations vary across the
groups with a statistically significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis test,
p b 0.05). From the pairwise Dunn's test (significant at p b 0.05), G2
emerged with significantly lower PNCs (Table 2) unlike the other
groups (G1, G3, G4) that were not significantly different from each
other. Regarding PM concentrations, differences for the pairs G1–G3
and G2–G4 in all fractions were not statistically significant, which sug-
gests that PM concentrations were governed by other factors than in-
come deprivation. Comparison between income areas in each mode of
transport (Table S4), shows that global PM concentrations were domi-
nated by the very high concentrations in the underground. The differ-
ence between the pairs G1–G3 and G2–G4 corresponds to the two
different underground lines (in opposite directions): the Northern line
for G1 (partly, also Victoria line) and G3 and the District line for G2 and
G4. Concentrations in the Northern and Victoria lines were N3-times
higher than in the District line for PM (Table 3). This aspect is further
discussed in Section 3.2.
For BC concentrations, we excluded the underground measurements
in the calculation of the global GM for each income group (Table 2).
Measured BC concentrations are affected by iron (Fe) interference in
the measurements (Moreno et al., 2015b) due to its absorbance of visi-
ble light at similar wavelengths (Gilardoni et al., 2011). In most environ-
ments, the light absorption from Fe is negligible compared to that of BC
(Ballach et al., 2001; Heintzenberg, 1982) but the underground has a
considerable presence of Fe (Fig. S5; Kam et al., 2013) causing an impor-
tant overestimation of BC. Fe influence is demonstrated by the correla-
tion between BC and all PM fractions, with an r N 0.85 (Pearson) in the
underground measurements, but only r ≤ 0.40 for the car and bus mea-
surements (Table S5).
If looking separately by transport mode, we can observe a similar
trend among the groups for all the pollutants and transport modes
(Fig. 2, see Fig. S6 for PM1). G1 arises as the one showing the highest con-
centrations of all pollutants in the car and the underground modes. The
bus route corresponding to G3 was the most polluted (except for PM10,
with the highest concentrations observed in G4). G2 arise again as the
routes with the lowest concentrations, with the only exception of PM
in the car (G3 had the lowest concentrations). However, although this
was the hierarchy, the Dunn's test showed in many cases that the
differences among some groups are not statistically significant
(Table S4). The similarities in pollutant concentration between the
pairs G1–G3 and G2–G4 in the underground, attributed to the two differ-
ent lines monitored, can be clearly observed in Fig. 2.
To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to assess the
difference in concentrations to what commuters are exposed to accord-
ing to their socioeconomic status. Despite G1 showing the highest con-
centrations of all the studied pollutants (except BC), there was no
consistent decreasing or increasing trend between the concentrations
and the income groups (Table 2). These observations indicate that con-
centrations are not solely determined by the income group but by other
factors (such as the line in the case of the underground measurements).
Table S6 shows the concentrations measured stationary at the origin
and destination points by income group, transport mode and period.
Concentration at the origin of all pollutants varies across income groups
with a statistically significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis test, p b 0.05)
which points to a difference in the background concentrations. The ori-
gin point in G1 showed the highest levels of air pollutants but this can be
explained by heavy traffic on this particular street compared to the
other origin points. PM concentrations at the destination were not sta-
tistically different between the groups (Table S6), indicating similar
background conditions for the different income groups. However, we
observed significant variation across the groups for BC and PNC concen-
trations. This might be due to different traffic intensities or the effect of
meteorology on the different sampling days that might affect differently
to each pollutant. For example, BC and PNCs are considered better traffic
tracers (and therefore more directly affected by traffic emissions) than
PM2.5 or PM10 (although they are obviously influenced by traffic emis-
sions; Reche et al., 2011; WHO, 2012).
3.1.2. Among transport modes
PM concentrations were significantly highest in the underground
(PM2.5 = 34.5 μg m−3) for all fractions, followed by the bus (PM2.5 =
13.9 μg m−3) and being lowest in the car (PM2.5 = 7.3 μg m−3; Table
2). Taking car as the reference, PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations
were up to 3.5-, 4.7- and 8.4-times higher in the underground and
1.5-, 1.9- and 4.6-times higher in the bus, respectively. Past studies
also report much higher PM concentrations in underground trains and
platforms compared with the other transport modes or surface plat-
forms (Adams et al., 2001; Cartenì et al., 2015; Martins et al., 2016a;
Seaton et al., 2005). Our physicochemical characterization suggested
Fe as the main component in underground PM (N50% by weight). This
is in line with previous studies suggesting its origin from mechanical
abrasion between rails, wheels and brakes (Jung et al., 2012; Kam et
al., 2013; Martins et al., 2016a, 2016b; Querol et al., 2012). Fe particles
were characterised by a flake-shape morphology (Fig. S5) with sharp
and irregular borders, as also described by Moreno et al. (2015a) in
the underground of Barcelona. Si, Cu, Ca, Zn and K, identified by EDS
in our underground sample, are also commonly found in underground
systems (Aarnio et al., 2005; Jung et al., 2012; Loxham et al., 2013;
Martins et al., 2016b; Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2007). The mass median di-
ameter (MMD) inside the underground trains is 3.5 μm, which is within
the coarse fraction (PM2.5–10). Despite the high concentrations, Seaton
et al. (2005) concluded that concentrations in the underground were
unlikely to represent a significant risk due to the different nature of
the underground (mainly iron oxides) from the surface particles,

 which are mostly combustion generated and suspected to pose a major
risk (Kelly and Fussell, 2012).
Commuters travelling by bus were exposed to higher BC concentra-
tions (BC = 5.4 μg m−3) than those travelling by car with the windows
closed (BC = 4.4 μg m−3). This is due to a higher infiltration of outside
pollutants into the bus because of open windows and frequent door
opening. The fact that the air gets inside the car through the filters of
the ventilation system hindered the entrance of particles, especially
the coarse PM fraction (PM2.5–10; Kumar and Goel, 2016). In fact, the
PM1 fraction corresponds to the 79.0% of the PM10 inside the car (Fig.
3). On the other hand, during the bus trips, PM1 contributed only a
21.5% to PM10 inside the bus and therefore the bus trips are
characterised by a very high proportion of coarse particles. The MMD in-
side the car was 2.80 μm, while for the bus was 11.4 μm. In car and bus
modes, particles show a variety of morphologies such as agglomerates
from vehicle exhaust, mineral components with crystal form, as well
as the presence of sporadic fibres that may come from clothes worn
by commuters or from the seat fabric. Fe was also the dominant element
(Fig. S5), which is usually found in dust profiles of urban environments
(Amato et al., 2009). The presence of Ba and Cu also indicate the contri-
bution of non-exhaust emissions from the brake wear (Gietl et al., 2010;
Thorpe and Harrison, 2008).
Regarding PNC, and opposed to PM, the underground had the lowest
concentrations (6694 cm−3) which have also been observed in other
travel mode comparisons (Moreno et al., 2015b). This is due to the ab-
sence of combustion sources (such as vehicular emissions) in this envi-
ronment. Although higher PNC were observed in the bus (9355 cm−3),
no statistically significant differences were observed with the car
(8639 cm−3; Table 2). Therefore, ultrafine particles might infiltrate
more easily through the car filtering system, resulting in similar in-vehi-
cle PNC concentration for bus and car modes.
Fig. 4 gives an example of a time-series of bus, car and underground
measurements. The lowest BC and PM concentrations were observed in
the car (grey background indicate in-vehicle measurements) and the
presence of intermittent peaks might be associated with the traffic in-
tensity and velocity. There is an obvious reduction of the concentration
of coarse particles inside the car. However, coarse particles were very
important in the bus measurements, with a very high short-time vari-
ability that can be attributed to the frequent opening of the doors and
to the resuspension generated by the passengers. PM concentrations
are perceptibly higher in the underground measurements. They reach
to extreme peaks when the train goes underground, indicating a strong
effect of the tunnels on PM concentrations (Adams et al., 2001; Seaton et
al., 2005). This effect was also observed on PNC concentrations, howev-
er, the increase was less pronounced.
Globally in Greater London, a similar percentage of trips among the
income groups were done by underground (Table 1). However, differ-
ences in the car and bus share were obvious. An increasing use of the
car was observed from most (26.9%) to least (37.4%) deprived, being
the opposite for the bus share (25.0% and 6.9%, most and least deprived,
respectively; Table 1). The mode share may have implications on the ex-
posures among commuters from areas with different income depriva-
tion. Commuters from less deprived areas have a predominant use of
the private car mode and therefore were exposed to the lowest concen-
trations. Contrary to that, a high proportion of people from the low in-
come areas are using the bus which leads to higher exposures because
of the higher concentrations (Table 2) as well as the longest trip dura-
tion (Table S7). Furthermore, private cars generate the highest

 emissions per passenger, while bus passengers are disproportionally ex-
posed to those emissions. This can be considered a violation of the core
principle of environmental justice as reviewed by Brulle and Pellow
(2006). Likewise, Jephcote and Chen (2012) reported that commuting
of affluent population by private transport produced the high levels of
air pollution in more deprived areas. Future studies are needed to
evaluate exposure and deprivation at individual level for all the London
population, in order to further explore the inequalities in exposure to
air pollutants during commuting. The results from this study can be
incorporated into predictive models of exposure during commuting.
3.1.3. Among period of the day
The highest concentrations of all pollutants were found during the
morning trips, followed by evening and afternoon trips (Table 2). After-
noon and evening concentrations were not showing significant differ-
ences. Morning concentrations were 39% and 21% higher for BC, 19%
and 13% for PNC, and between 35 and 43% and 23–30% for the different
fractions of PM, in comparison with the afternoon and evening, respec-
tively (Table 2). BC, PNC and PM1, usually showed a peak during the
morning hours, reflecting the influence of traffic emissions during this
period (Costabile et al., 2009; Morawska et al., 2008; Moreno et al.,
2009; Pérez et al., 2010). De Nazelle et al. (2012) also found significantly
higher morning concentrations in personal measurements of com-
muters in Barcelona for BC and PM2.5, although not for UFP. Similar re-
sults were observed by Gómez-Perales et al. (2007) in Mexico City for
PM2.5. On the other hand, Adams et al. (2001) and Kaur et al. (2007) re-
ported no significant or little differences among the intra-day periods
that they were studying, which was attributed to their routes covereing
a small area close to the centre of the city.
3.1.4. Spatial variation
Fig. 5 shows the spatial variation of BC concentrations for selected
evening car and bus routes. We were not able to generate the under-
ground maps owing to the absence of GPS signal. Higher concentrations
of air pollutants were expected in the central area of London, as shown
for modelled PM2.5 in the annual pollution map for 2010 (KCL's
Environmental Research Group, 2016). However, the annual pollution
maps also show the main roads and motorways in the city as hotspots
of air pollution. The absence of an increasing gradient towards the city
centre (Fig. 5) suggests that concentrations during the trips are mainly
affected by the traffic conditions at each specific road. Previous studies
have identified how traffic flow interruptions (such as red lights and
other traffic intersections) result in higher PM mass concentrations
and PNC in these points (Goel and Kumar, 2015b; Kim et al., 2013;
Kumar and Goel, 2016). Therefore, concentrations inside the on-road
vehicles were affected by the traffic flow and driving conditions of the
specific point of the route.
The trips were performed on different days, so a direct comparison
between income groups might be affected by the specific meteorology
and traffic intensity of that day. However, we can consider Fig. 5 as an
example of the overall results shown in Fig. 2, where this relationship
among income groups for car and bus is maintained. For the bus trips,
G3 and G4 (the routes starting from the two least deprived areas) clearly
faced overall higher concentrations whereas G1 and G2 showed the low-
est, especially G2 (Fig. 5). This was probably because the longest section
of G3 and G4 bus routes passed through central busy streets, were more
traffic interruptions and higher background concentrations are present.
A different pattern was observed for the car measurements, where the
four income groups were exposed intermittently to high and low BC
concentrations at each point of the route, but with G2 showing a higher
frequency of lower concentrations (green dots on the map, Fig. 5).
3.2. Identification of parameters governing the variability of concentrations
in each transport mode
3.2.1. Bus measurements
Fig. 6 shows the overall concentrations of the different pollutants ob-
served at different stages of the bus trips: (i) walking on the street, (ii)
waiting at the bus stop or bus station or (iii) being inside the bus cabin.
A similar pattern was followed by BC, PNC and PM10 with concentra-
tions being the highest inside the bus and the lowest while walking
on the street. This gradient is less marked for PM1 and PM2.5 concentra-
tions, which were similar at the three locations (see Fig. S7 for PM1
boxplot). This might be explained by the fact that PM sources are less
specific for traffic emissions and are influenced by other transboundary
sources (Cyrys et al., 2003; Kaur and Nieuwenhuijsen, 2009). However,
resuspension of coarse particles (which affects PM10 concentrations)
can be important at short distances as observed in previous work
(Kumar and Goel, 2016). For the particular case of G4, median PM
concentrations of the three fractions were higher for the times when
the field worker was waiting at the bus stop, probably indicating the
influence of road dust resuspension.
3.2.2. Car measurements
Three different trip stages were assessed for the car measurements:
(i) walking to the car, (ii) the period inside the car but with the engine
still off (while getting everything ready), and (iii) the car trip itself. Sim-
ilarly to bus measurements, BC and PNC showed highest concentrations
when the fieldworker was inside the car with the engine on (this is, on
the move; Fig. 6). On the other hand, and according to what has been
discussed before, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were reduced during
the time spent in-cabin, especially for PM10. PM1 concentrations
(Fig. S7) remained very similar across the different locations, which

and PM2.5/PM10 for each mode of transport (only the time spent inside the vehicles).
149

 may indicate a lower removal efficiency of the car filter for this fraction.
The measurements in the car with the engine turned off correspond to
much fewer data in comparison with the rest of locations since only a
few minutes passed between getting into the car and starting the trip.
This explains the very similar concentrations when being at the street
since the in-cabin concentrations were directly affected by the opening
of the doors at the moment of getting in.
3.2.3. Underground measurements
Four different stages in the underground trips were included in the
analysis: (i) walking to the underground station, (ii) walking from the
entrance of the underground station to the platform, (iii) waiting on
the platform, and (iv) inside the train. Concentrations of PM became
much higher from the moment that the commuter gets inside the un-
derground station (Fig. 6; see Fig. S7 for PM1). This situation was re-
versed for PNC, owing to the absence of combustion sources in this
environment. The boxplots show a high dispersion of PM data in the un-
derground environment owing to the numerous factors that affect con-
centrations. The impact of the underground lines has been already
discussed in section 3.1 but other parameters also deserve attention,
such as the influence of the above/underground factor in trains and plat-
forms, and the effect of openable/non-openable windows in trains.
In the London underground, platforms can be underground or open
and located at ground level (referred hereafter as above-ground). Un-
derground platforms have much higher concentrations than the plat-
forms above ground for all the pollutants (Table S8), owing to a
hindered dispersion in the more confined underground environment.
Particularly, the PM fractions were between 6.1- and 8.5-times higher
in platforms underground. Much lower is the ratio for PNC, having
1.9-times higher concentrations in the underground platforms. For BC,
this ratio increases to 30.0, but this is because the underground BC
concentrations are overestimated due to Fe interference in the mea-
surements while they are not on the platforms above-ground. Cartenì
et al. (2015) found similar results in a study carried out in Naples.
They obtained PM2.5 concentrations between 45 and 58 μg m−3 (172–
262 μg m−3 for PM10) in stations above-ground in comparison to
10 μg m−3 (16 μg m−3 for PM10) in a station at the ground level.
Air quality inside the underground trains is affected by the ventila-
tion setting in the train (Cartenì et al., 2015; Martins et al., 2016a) and
if the train is passing on an above or underground section (Aarnio et
al., 2005; Adams et al., 2001; Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2007). The trips
on the District and Northern lines had sections on both above and
under the ground while the part that we covered by Victoria line was al-
ways underground. The effect of the tunnels is obvious (Fig. 7; see Fig.
S7 for PM1), with much higher concentrations encountered in sections
that go underground (GM: PNC = 7198 cm−3, PM2.5 = 63.0 μg m−3
for District line; PNC = 8524 cm−3, PM2.5 = 83.4 μg m−3 for Northern
line) than above the ground (GM: PNC = 4204 cm−3, PM2.5 =
11.7 μg m−3 for District line; PNC = 3663 cm−3, PM2.5 = 6.61 μg m−3
for Northern line).
All the trains on the Northern and Victoria line had openable win-
dows, which were generally all open. Trains on the District line have
both openable (monitored on 21 single trips) or non-openable windows
(26 single trips; the latter always had mechanical ventilation in opera-
tion). The concentrations in the trains with non-openable windows
from the District line clearly show the lowest concentration (GM:
PNC = 4549 cm−3 and PM2.5 = 16.4 μg m−3) in comparison with
trains with openable windows (GM: PNC = 6624 cm−3 and PM2.5 =
37.4 μg m−3) for all the pollutants under study (Fig. 8). This indicates
an easy entrance from the outside train particles into the carriage
Fig. 4. Time-series for the car, bus and underground measurements corresponding to round (going + return) morning trip of the routes from the income group G3. No measurements at
the destination were made when commuting by car due to security reasons. Note the different units for PNC in the underground (102 cm−3, rather than 103 cm−3) and the different axis
scale for each transport mode. BC measurements in the underground are overestimated because of Fe interference. Background colours indicate the location of the field worker.
150

 through the windows, probably enhanced by the turbulences created by
the train itself. Since the concentrations were higher in the tunnel sec-
tions, the synergy of being underground and having the windows
open leads to the very high concentration found in the Northern and
Victoria lines. These results are in line with other studies assessing the
ventilation condition. Martins et al. (2016a) carried out a comparison
among the underground systems in three European cities and observed
increased PM2.5 concentrations in the trains from Athens, which had the
windows open. A gradual substitution of the trains with openable win-
dows by non-openable windows trains would be advised to substantial-
ly diminish the exposure of the underground passengers.
Still, differences can be observed among the trains on different lines
with openable windows (Fig. 8), with the Victoria line being the most
polluted for the fine fraction of particles (PM2.5 and PM1; see Fig. S7
Fig. 5. Spatial distribution of BC concentration for (a) car and (b) bus during evening trips (each trip was carried out on a different day). The time-series for the corresponding trip are
shown.
151
I. Rivas et al. / Environment International 101 (2017) 143–157
 for PM1). However, for PNC and PM10, the Northern line is showing the
highest concentrations. A possible explanation would be the length of
the underground section that might lead to a higher accumulation and
subsequent resuspension of the particles. However, this does not
agree with our results. In our measured section, Victoria line goes
above ground more often than the Northern, so the highest PM would
be expected (all fractions, not only PM10) in Northern (owing to the
lower dispersion of this underground-generated particles).
3.3. Duration of the trips
Underground was the fastest mode (42.6–55.9 min; Table S7), with
40% of the time being spent in reaching the underground station and
waiting for the train. The second fastest mode was car (49.4–
66.3 min) since we selected the most direct routes. Although the fastest
options were selected, bus trips took by far the longest time (67.4–
108.1 min) due to the indirect and busy central routes and the frequent
stops. Reaching the bus took 18% of the total time, which in absolute
terms is similar to the underground (15.9 min and 18.6 min for bus
and underground, respectively; Table S7). Since the distance between
origin and destination was longer for less deprived areas (Table 1), G1
trip duration was always the shortest among all modes. G4 trip duration
was the longest for car and underground, while it was G3 for the bus.
3.4. Contribution of each sub-microenvironment of the trip to the overall
RDDs of PM2.5
The concept of exposure incorporates the duration of the contact to a
certain concentration by integrating over time (Duan, 1982; Ott, 1982).
The estimation of doses go a step further and includes a dosimetry factor
such as the ventilation rate (Morawska et al., 2013) and can also incor-
porate the fraction of particles that are deposited in the lungs. We esti-
mated the RDD per hour of exposure at each trip stage and the total RDD
per trip for females (31–40 years old), for each transport mode and in-
come group (Table S7). The different RDD observed between females
and males is due to the different ventilation rates assigned to each of
them (Table S3; US-EPA, 2009), being between 23 and 32% higher in
males. For the sake of brevity, we will only refer to the females RDD in

152

 this work but a very similar pattern is followed by the male results
(Table S7). Different RDD are obtained for each PM fraction. A discussion
about these differences is included in the Section S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Information.
The contribution of each stage of the trip to the total trip RDD varies
substantially among transport modes (Fig. 9). The hourly RDD while
walking varied among the groups and transport mode (the walking itin-
erary was different for each transport mode) ranging from 2.79 to
4.76 μg h−1 (Table S7). The in-vehicle RRD for car was the lowest
(0.57–0.95 μg h−1), followed by RDD in the bus (1.52–3.49 μg h−1).
The highest hourly RDD was found in the underground, both inside
the station and in the trains. Walking inside the stations gives RDD
from 9.34 to 21.03 μg h−1, which is a bit lower while waiting at the plat-
forms (5.95–18.17 μg h−1) since lower ventilation rates due to lower ac-
tivity intensity. The in-vehicle hourly RDD for the underground was
4.10 and 4.50 μg h−1 for the District line (G4 and G2 respectively) and
N5-times higher in the Northern line (21.63 μg h−1 for G1 – includes
Victoria line; 25.8 μg h−1 for G3).
The doses received (and the time spent) during the in-vehicle for the
car routes were between 92.6 and 96.1% (97.4–99.3%) of the total dose
(time) received during the whole trip, with the remaining 4.0–7.4%
(0.7–2.6%) corresponding to walking on the street. The walking distance
from the origin point to the car was always short, and therefore also was
the time and the dose. The contribution of the in-vehicle to the total trip
doses for the bus routes was also relatively high (68.0–78.5%; time:
78.4–87.1%), with the walking contribution (15.3–19.8%; time: 7.1–
13.7%) gaining some importance because of longer times needed to
reach the bus stop. Waiting at the bus stop/station contributed with
the 5.9–12.2% of the total trip RDD (time: 5.6–12.1%). On the other
hand, the contribution to the total RDD per trip from the time spent in
the underground trains was generally lower (53.8–66.0%, except for
G3 which was 80.1%) since the time spent inside the vehicles for this
mode was also relatively short (49.8–66.9% of total time). The contribu-
tion to the total trip dose of walking on the street showed a high vari-
ability (4.4–21%; time: 18.0–27.8%) owing to the different distance
from the origin or the destination to the underground station and, par-
ticularly, to the high relative contribution of the in-vehicle time for
Northern line routes (G1 and G3). The time spent inside the stations
(including walking inside the station and waiting in the platform itself)
implies receiving between the 15.6 to 30.8% of the total trip RDD (time:
10.6–27.2%). Due to the very high concentrations in this environment
(Table 2), the absolute contribution (in terms of μg) of the in-vehicle
for the underground is often larger the total trip RDD for the rest of
the transport modes. The contribution of out of vehicle locations in
the public transport modes (bus and underground) was noteworthy.
The time spent and doses received could be reduced by increasing the
buses and trains frequencies, especially in the peak commuting hours
which is when the highest background concentrations are observed.
4. Summary, conclusions and future work
We investigated inequalities related to income deprivation in the ex-
posure to PM1, PM2.5, PM10, BC and PNC during commuting, as well as
assessed the differences between transport modes (car, underground
and bus) and daytime periods. For the first time, inequalities were
assessed through direct exposure assessment. We selected different
routes, linking a place of residence with distinct levels of income

 deprivation (G1 to G4, from most to least deprived) to a place of work
(financial district in London). We conclude that:
• The most deprived income group, G1, showed the overall highest con-
centrations of BC and all PM fractions while G3 showed the highest
PNC. G2 had the lowest concentrations of all pollutants. There was
no consistent decrease or increase in concentrations related to the in-
come deprivation of the origin.
• The highest concentration of all PM fractions was found in the under-
ground measurements, followed by bus and car. BC concentration was
higher in the bus (5.4 μg m−3) than in the car (4.4 μg m−3). Car filter-
ing system was efficient in hindering the entrance of PM, especially
coarse particles.
• PNCs were highest in the bus (9355 cm−3), not statistically different
from the car (8639 cm−3). The absence of combustion sources made
the underground trips to have the lowest PNCs (6694 cm−3).
• In general, the concentrations of all the pollutants in the road modes
(car and bus) were ruled by traffic conditions and flow interruptions
at the specific road section.
• Substantially higher concentrations of all pollutants, especially PM,
were observed in underground carriages with openable windows
and in the underground sections. An upgrade to trains with non-
openable windows would be advised to substantially reduce
passenger's exposure.
• Concentrations of pollutants during the morning peak were between
13 and 43% higher than during the afternoon or evening peak, de-
pending on the pollutant.
• There is a violation of the core principle of environmental justice
(Brulle and Pellow, 2006) if we consider that commuters from less de-
prived areas rely more on the car (low exposure) and those from more
deprived areas on the bus (high exposure). Besides, private emissions
generate the highest emissions per passenger.
• Bus trips took the longest time (67–108 min) due to indirect routes
and frequent stops. Underground was the fastest mode (43–
56 min), followed by car (50–66 min).
• For the public transport modes, there was a considerable out of vehi-
cle contribution to the total RDD. The time spent walking and waiting
inside the underground stations contributed to 15.6–30.8% of the total
RDD while waiting time at the bus stop contributed to 5.9–12.2% of
total RDD. Exposure might be reduced by increasing the trains and
buses frequency, especially during peak hours.
Whilst concentrations have been determined for typical routes for 4
income groups and for the most prevalent transport modes, further ex-
perimental campaigns and extrapolation studies are needed to deter-
mine possible inequalities on the exposure to air pollutants in the
wider urban system.
