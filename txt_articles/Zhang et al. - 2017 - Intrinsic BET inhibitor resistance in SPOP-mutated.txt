Abstract
Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein inhibitors are emerging as promising anti-
cancer therapies. The gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-binding adaptor speckle-type 
POZ protein (SPOP) is most frequently mutated in prostate cancer. Here we demonstrate that wild-
type SPOP binds to and induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of BET proteins 
(BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4) by recognizing a common degron motif. In contrast, prostate cancer-
associated SPOP mutants impair binding and proteasomal degradation of BET proteins, thus 
inducing their accumulation in prostate cancer cells and patient specimens. Transcriptome and 
BRD4 cistrome analyses reveal that SPOP mutation enhances BRD4-dependent expression of 
GTPase RAC1 and cholesterol biosynthesis genes and AKT-mTORC1 activation. SPOP mutant 
expression confers BET inhibitor resistance and this effect can be overcome by AKT inhibitors. 
Thus, SPOP mutations promote AKT-mTORC1 activation and intrinsic BET inhibitor resistance 
by stabilizing BET proteins, suggesting that SPOP mutation can be an effective biomarker to guide 
BET inhibitor-oriented therapy of prostate cancer.
Ubiquitously-expressed BET proteins including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 function as key 
factors for transcriptional activation of distinct sets of cancer-related genes through context-
specific interaction with acetylated histones and/or transcription factors1,2. Several small 
molecule inhibitors specifically targeting the bromodomains of BET proteins have been 
developed and display promising anti-cancer activity via selective blockage of expression of 
cancer promoters such as MYC in multiple myeloma and androgen receptor (AR) in prostate 
cancer1–6. While BET inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials for treatment of various 
cancer types, several mechanisms of drug resistance have been documented7–9. At present, 
there is no genetic alteration(s) can be exploited as a biomarker to guide targeted use of 
these drugs.
SPOP is the substrate recognition subunit of the CULLIN3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) 
complex. SPOP binding triggers the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target 
proteins mediated by RBX1-dependent recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme into 
the CRL complex. Cancer whole genome- and exome-sequencing studies reveal that SPOP 
is the most frequently mutated gene in primary prostate cancer10,11. Notably, SPOP 
mutations detected in prostate cancer occur in the structurally defined substrate-binding 
motif termed MATH domain10,12–14, suggesting that the pathophysiology of SPOP 
mutations is likely mediated by impaired ubiquitination of substrates.
To identify new degradation substrates of SPOP, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens 
using the full-length SPOP as bait. A total of 246 positive clones were obtained, including 
known SPOP substrates DEK and SRC-3 (Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis 
showed that SPOP bound to a number of proteins involved in regulation of various signaling 
pathways, but the top hit was BET proteins (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2). Co-

 immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays confirmed that ectopically expressed and endogenous 
SPOP and BRD2/3/4 proteins interacted with each other in 293T and LNCaP prostate cancer 
cells (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Thus, SPOP interacts with BET proteins in 
physiological conditions.
BET proteins play key roles in epigenetic regulation and cancer, but little is known about 
their post-translational modifications and downstream functions. Treatment of LNCaP cells 
with proteasome inhibitors Bortezomib and MG132 inevitably increased BRD2/3/4 protein, 
but not mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor 
of NEDD8-activating enzyme that is required for activation of CRLs, also caused 
accumulation of BRD2/3/4 at protein level (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). Expression of wild-
type SPOP markedly decreased BRD2/3/4 proteins, and this effect was completely reversed 
by MG132 treatment (Fig. 1c). Knockdown of SPOP increased the steady-state level of 
endogenous BRD2/3/4 protein and prolonged the protein half-life while had no overt effect 
on mRNA expression in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1d–f). Similar results 
were obtained in 22Rv1 and BPH-1 prostatic cell lines (Fig. 1d). Moreover, only wild-type 
SPOP, but not substrate binding- and CUL3 binding-deficient mutants (ΔMATH and ΔBTB, 
respectively) degraded BRD2/3/4 proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Wild-type SPOP 
induced K48-dependent polyubiquitination of these proteins in cells and this effect relied on 
its enzymatic activity (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1h–i). We further showed that the 
SPOP-CULLIN3-RBX1 complex catalyzed BRD4 ubiquitination in vitro (Fig. 1f). Thus, 
functioning as a CRL substrate-binding adaptor, SPOP promotes ubiquitination and 
proteasomal degradation of BRD2/3/4 proteins in prostate cancer cells.
Substrate-binding consensus (SBC) motifs (Φ-π-S/T-S/T-S/T where Φ is a nonpolar residue 
and π is a polar residue15) have been well characterized in known SPOP substrates such as 
MacroH2A and DEK12. We found the existence of a perfectly matched SBC motif in the 
region between bromodomain-1 (BD1) and BD2 in BRD2/3/4 proteins (Fig. 2a, b), which 
also localizes within the minimal SPOP-interaction region defined by yeast two-hybrid 
clones of BRD2/3/4 (Fig. 1a). Co-IP assays revealed that deletion of the putative SBC motif 
in BRD2/3/4 not only abolished SPOP binding and SPOP-mediated ubiquitination and 
degradation of BRD2/3/4, but also significantly prolonged the half-life of these proteins 
(Fig. 2b–g). Thus, we identified a common, functionally conserved SBC motif in BRD2/3/4 
proteins that is required for SPOP-dependent ubiquitination and degradation.
Because SPOP mutations in prostate cancers occur in the MATH domain that is responsible 
for substrate binding16, we hypothesized that prostate cancer-associated mutations impair 
the ability of SPOP to degrade BRD2/3/4. We generated 11 prostate cancer-associated SPOP 
mutants. Co-IP assays demonstrated that the BRD2/3/4-binding ability of all 11 SPOP 
mutants was largely impaired compared with wild-type SPOP (Fig. 3a and Supplementary 
Fig. 2a). SPOP-mediated ubiquitination of these proteins was also markedly attenuated by 
these mutations (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2b). SPOP mutants failed to degrade, but 
rather elevated endogenous BRD2/3/4 protein levels, a dominant-negative effect similarly 
occurred to known SPOP substrates such as DEK, ERG and SRC-312–14 (Fig. 3c). Thus, 
prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants result in the stabilization of BRD2/3/4 proteins in 
prostate cancer cells.

 To examine the effect of SPOP mutations on BET protein levels in patient specimens, we 
analyzed BRD2/3/4 protein levels in two cohorts constituting 99 primary prostate tumors 
(Supplementary Table 3). We identified 13 SPOP-mutated tumors through whole-genome 
sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing. The SPOP mutation frequency in our samples is 
consistent with the previous findings in different cohorts of prostate cancer10,11. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that approximately 85%, 92% and 85% of SPOP-
mutated tumors exhibited strong or intermediate straining of BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 
proteins, respectively (Fig. 3d, e). In contrast, only 40% or less of SPOP-WT tumors 
exhibited strong or intermediate straining whereas majority of them (approximately 71%, 
66% and 59% for BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, respectively) exhibited weak staining (Fig. 3d, 
e). BRD2/3/4 mRNA expression was relative lower in SPOP-mutated tumors than that in 
SPOP-WT specimens in our cohorts, although the difference did not reach statistical 
significance (except BRD2) (Supplementary Fig. 2c). A similar trend was observed in The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2d). These findings indicate that 
BRD2/3/4 protein levels were elevated in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer specimens and this 
was unlikely caused by increases in mRNA level.
Small molecule inhibitors of BET proteins are being actively tested as promising epigenetic-
targeted therapeutics of cancer1,3–9,17,18. We examined if SPOP-mediated degradation of 
BET proteins influences the anti-cancer efficacy of BET inhibitors in prostate cancer cells. 
Knockdown of endogenous SPOP by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) not only increased 
BRD2/3/4 protein expression, but also enhanced proliferation in C4-2 cells and this effect 
was abolished by co-knockdown of BRD2/3/4 proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3a–g). 
Consistent with a previous report6, we demonstrated that the BET inhibitor JQ1 robustly 
inhibited prostate cancer cell growth, but this effect was largely attenuated in SPOP-
knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). SPOP depletion-mediated JQ1 resistance was 
reversed by knockdown of BRD4 alone (Supplementary Fig. 3h–j). However, BRD4 
knockout cells became highly resistant to JQ1 when BRD2/3 were largely depleted 
(Supplementary Figure 3k, l). This result is not surprising since little or no druggable targets 
(BRD2/3/4 proteins) were present in these cells. These data suggest that protein levels of 
BRD2/3/4 may represent a molecular determinant for JQ1 sensitivity in SPOP-deficient 
prostate cancer cells.
Phenylalanine 133 (F133) is the most frequently mutated residue in SPOP10. To recapitulate 
the situation in patients, we introduced SPOP-F133V mutant into SPOP-WT-expressing 
C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells. Expression of SPOP-F133V not only induced accumulation of 
BRD2/3/4 proteins, but also caused a significant increase in proliferation in both cell lines 
(Supplementary Fig. 3m, n). While JQ1 treatment inhibited growth of empty vector (EV)-
expressing C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells, the effect of JQ1 was largely impeded in SPOP-F133V-
expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 3n). SPOP-F133V expression also caused similar 
resistance to another BET inhibitor i-BET in C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3o–
q). We further showed that SPOP-F133V mutant conferred JQ1-resistance in C4-2 xenograft 
tumors in mice (Fig. 4a–c). SPOP-F133V-mediated JQ1-resistance was completely reversed 
by co-depletion of BRD2/3/4 proteins in C4-2 cells in vitro and in C4-2 xenografts in mice 
(Fig. 4a–c and Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). SPOP-F133V expression also induced 
accumulation of known SPOP substrates ERG, DEK and SRC-312–14 in C4-2 and 22Rv1

 cells and C4-2 tumors in mice (Supplementary Fig. 3m and 4d). However, JQ1 treatment 
largely decreased ERG expression (Supplementary Fig. 3m and 4d, e), which is consistent 
with similar findings in acute myeloid leukemia cells19. Knockdown of ERG by shRNAs 
had no overt effect on SPOP-F133V-mediated JQ1 resistance in C4-2 cells, and similar 
results were obtained in DEK-knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 4e, f). SRC-3 
knockdown slightly sensitized SPOP-F133V cells to JQ1, but the effect was not statistically 
significant (Supplementary Fig. 4e, f). Thus, our data suggest SPOP mutation-conferred 
BET inhibitor resistance is largely mediated by elevation of BRD2/3/4 proteins in prostate 
cancer cells.
Next, we investigated the role of SPOP mutation-induced accumulation of BRD proteins in 
BET inhibitor resistance in clinically-oriented models. Among three prostate cancer patient-
derived organoid lines examined, one harbors a W131R mutation in SPOP. W131 belongs to 
a conserved residue in the substrate-binding cleft10. We demonstrated that W131R mutation 
was deficient in binding to and mediating ubiquitination and degradation of BRD4 
(Supplementary Figure 5a–c). Most importantly, the W131R-expressing organoid expressed 
more BRD2/3/4 proteins and was resistant to JQ1 compared to two SPOP WT counterparts 
under both 2D and 3D growth conditions (Supplementary Figure 5d–g). These data indicate 
that SPOP mutation confers BET inhibitor resistance in patient-derived primary cultures.
It is worth noting that BET inhibitors have been shown to induce BRD4 accumulation in 
different cell types, but the underlying mechanism is unclear6,20. We demonstrated the effect 
occurred at post-transcriptional level (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 3m, 6a, b). We further 
showed that JQ1 diminished SPOP-BRD2/3/4 protein interaction, partially blocked SPOP-
induced BRD2/3/4 ubiquitination and degradation, and prolonged protein half-life even in 
SPOP-F133V-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c–h). Thus, while inhibiting their 
activities, BET inhibitors undesirably disturb BET protein proteolysis and this effect appears 
to be mediated by SPOP-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
To define the signaling pathways that mediate BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated 
cells, we performed transcriptome analysis in control (EV) and SPOP-F133V-expressing 
C4-2 cells treated with or without JQ1. Through unsupervised cluster analysis we identified 
5,079 JQ1-downregulated genes in both control and SPOP-F133V cells, including MYC and 
AR, two known targets of BET inhibitors3,5,6 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Previous studies 
suggest that MYC may not be the major anti-cancer target of JQ1 in prostate cancer cells6. 
In agreement with this report, we found that JQ1 treatment markedly decreased MYC 
protein expression, which is consistent with substantial reduction of BRD4 binding in the 
MYC gene enhancer in both JQ1-sensitive (control) and -resistant (SPOP-F133V) C4-2 cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 7b–d). JQ1 also largely decreased AR protein level, BRD4 binding in 
the AR gene promoter and AR transcriptional activity in both control and SPOP-F133V cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 7b–f), and further knockdown of AR by shRNAs did not affect JQ1 
sensitivity in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 7g, h). Collectively, these findings suggest that 
BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer cells is likely mediated by MYC- 
and AR-independent pathways.

 Further analysis of RNA-seq data revealed 1,017 genes whose expression was suppressed by 
JQ1 in control cells but remained either unchanged or upregulated in F133V-mutant cells 
(Fig. 4d). 129 of them were highly upregulated in SPOP-mutated prostate tumors compared 
to SPOP-WT tumors in the TCGA cohort (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 4). Notably, 
these aberrantly upregulated genes significantly overlapped with the BRD4 target genes 
commonly identified in C4-2 cells transfected with SPOP-F133V or HA-BRD4 (Fig. 4f and 
Supplementary Fig. 8a–c). Ingenuity pathway analysis of the overlapped genes indicated 
that the top hit was the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and four members of this pathway 
including FDFT1, DHCR24, DHCR7 and MVD were upregulated in SPOP-mutated tumors 
(Fig. 4e, f). Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts have been linked to AKT activation and prostate 
cancer cell survival21–23. Since the RHO GTPase family member RAC1 can also activate the 
AKT-mTORC1 pathway by directly binding to mTOR24,25 and RAC1 was upregulated in 
SPOP-mutated tumors (Fig. 4e), we chose to focus on these two pathways. Meta-analysis 
also showed BRD4 binding at the RAC1 locus in different cell types (Supplementary Fig. 
8d). RNA-seq analysis showed that global transcriptional changes caused by BRD2/3/4 
overexpression in C4-2 cells significantly overlapped with the genes associated with JQ1 
resistance in F133V-mutant cells, including RAC1 (Supplementary Figure 8e–g and 
Supplementary Table 5). ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR assays showed that BRD4 readily bound 
at the RAC1 gene promoter in control cells, but the binding was largely enhanced by 
expression of SPOP-F133V or HA-BRD4 (Fig. 4f, g and Supplementary Fig. 8c, h). 
Increased BRD4 binding was unlikely caused by histone acetylation changes since 
expression of SPOP F133V or BRD proteins had no effect on the level of H3K27ac, H4K5ac 
and H4K8ac, both globally and in the RAC1 locus (Supplementary Fig. 8i, j). BRD4-
dependent regulation of RAC1 was confirmed by gene knockdown experiments 
(Supplementary Fig. 8k, l), providing further evidence that RAC1 is a bona fide BRD4 target 
gene. Additionally, increased BRD4 binding and RAC1 mRNA and protein expression 
correlated with high levels of BRD4 proteins in JQ1-resistant SPOP-F133V cells compared 
to JQ1-untreated control cells (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 8c, m, n). Furthermore, 
SPOP-F133V expression substantially increased phosphorylation of AKT and S6K, a 
downstream kinase of mTORC1, in both C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells regardless of JQ1 treatment 
(Supplementary Fig. 3m, 8o). Knockdown of RAC1 not only inhibited SPOP-F133V-
augmented AKT and S6K phosphorylation, but also abolished SPOP-F133V-mediated JQ1 
resistance in C4-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8o, p).
ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR assays showed that BRD4 readily bound in the promoters of 
cholesterol synthesis genes FDFT1, DHCR24, DHCR7 and MVD in control cells and the 
binding was enhanced by SPOP-F133V (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c), and this effect was 
unlikely caused by global or locus-specific histone acetylation changes (Supplementary Fig. 
8i, 9d). Knockdown of BRD4 largely decreased expression of these genes at mRNA and 
protein levels in both control and SPOP-F133V cells (Supplementary Fig. 8n, 9e). With 
concomitant induction of BRD4 protein levels, SPOP-F133V upregulated the expression of 
cholesterol synthesis genes at both mRNA and protein levels and enhanced BRD4 binding in 
their promoters (Supplementary Fig. 9b, c, e, f). JQ1 treatment largely inhibited expression 
of these genes and BRD4 binding at their promoters in control cells, but the effect was not 
pronounced in SPOP-F133V cells (Supplementary Fig. 9b, c, f, g). Co-depletion of these

 cholesterol synthesis genes abolished SPOP-F133V-induced activation of the AKT-
mTORC1 pathway and JQ1-resistance in C4-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 9h, i). Similar to 
SPOP mutant, moderate overexpression of BRD2/3/4 increased cholesterol biosynthesis and 
AKT/mTORC1 activation (Supplementary Fig. 8e, 9j). These data imply that both RAC1 
and cholesterol synthesis pathways are required to mediate SPOP mutation-induced AKT/
mTORC1 activation and JQ1 resistance (Supplementary Fig. 9k).
We further demonstrated that the transcription activator protein 1 (AP-1, a dimer of c-JUN 
and c-FOS) commonly bound to RAC1 and cholesterol synthesis gene promoters 
(Supplementary Fig. 9l, m). Although expression of c-JUN and c-FOS was not affected by 
SPOP mutation, knockdown of both abolished SPOP F133V-induced upregulation of RAC1 
and cholesterol synthesis genes and activation of AKT/mTORC1 without disturbing BRD4 
expression (Supplementary Fig. 9n–p). It has been shown recently that AKT/mTORC1 
pathway is activated in the prostate of SPOP F133V knock-in mice and this effect is 
mediated partially by increased SRC-3 expression26. We also demonstrated that SRC-3 
knockdown only partially decreased SPOP F133V-induced AKT/mTORC1 activation by 
selectively affecting expression of RAC1 and the cholesterol synthesis genes and slightly, 
but did not significantly diminish F133V-mediated JQ1 resistance (Supplementary Fig. 4f, 
9p), reinforcing a partial, co-activator role of SRC-3 in SPOP F133V-mediated AKT/
mTORC1 activation. In contrast, depletion of BET proteins almost completely abolished 
F133V-induced AKT/mTORC1 activation, upregulation of RAC1 and cholesterol synthesis 
genes and BET inhibitor resistance (Fig. 4a–c and Supplementary Fig. 9p).
It has been shown that PI3K inhibitor treatment induced expression of receptor tyrosine 
kinases (RTKs) including HER3, IGF1R and INSR, and the induction was mediated by 
BRD4, but blocked by BET inhibitor27. However, BET inhibitor treatment alone had no 
effect on RTK expression27. Similarly, no effect of JQ1 on expression of these proteins was 
detected in either JQ1-sensitive (control) or -resistant (SPOP-F133V) C4-2 cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 10a). We further demonstrated that neither mTORC1 activity (S6K 
phosphorylation) nor JQ1-resistant growth was affected by knockdown of HER3, IGF1R or 
INSR individually in SPOP F133V expressing C4-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 10b–d). 
These data rule out the potential role of these RTKs in F133V-induced AKT activation and 
JQ1 resistance in these cells. In contrast, knockdown of AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), 
mTOR or Raptor alone abolished JQ1-resistant growth of SPOP F133V-expressing C4-2 
cells (Supplementary Fig. 10e–g). Similar results were obtained by treating SPOP-F133V 
cells with the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 (Supplementary Fig. 10h). Most recently, a 
first-in-human phase I study has shown that Ipatasertib (GDC-0068), a novel ATP-
competitive AKT inhibitor, exhibits effective antitumor efficacy in patients with solid 
tumors28. We demonstrated that GDC-0068 treatment of SPOP mutant expressing cells not 
only abolished SPOP mutation-induced activation of AKT downstream pathways, but also 
completely overcame SPOP mutation-conferred resistance to BET inhibitor in C4-2 cells in 
culture and tumors in mice (Fig. 4h, i and Supplementary Fig. 10i). These findings highlight 
the significance of AKT inhibition in overcoming BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated 
prostate cancer (Supplementary Fig. 10j).

 In summary, our findings demonstrate BRD2/3/4 proteins are degradation substrates of 
SPOP. We uncover that SPOP mutation not only induces accumulation of these proteins, but 
also confers intrinsic resistance to BET inhibitors in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that 
besides SPOP mutations, elevation of BET proteins can be a biomarker to predict BET 
inhibitor resistance in prostate cancer patients. The TCGA data reveal that SPOP-mutated 
tumors had the highest AR transcriptional activity among all genotypically distinct subsets 
of prostate cancer11. This observation is further supported by other reports that protein levels 
of AR and its co-regulators such as SRC-3, ERG and TRIM24 are stabilized by SPOP 
mutants in prostate cancer13,14,29,30. These findings stress that aberrant activation of the AR 
not only represents a key event that contributes to the pathophysiology of SPOP mutations in 
prostate cancer, but also can be targeted for treatment of SPOP-mutated tumors. Consistent 
with recent reports that JQ1 blocks SPOP-proficient prostate cancer cell growth by 
inhibiting AR expression and activity6,31, we demonstrate that expression of AR and its 
downstream genes examined was inhibited by JQ1 in both SPOP-WT and SPOP-F133V 
mutant-expressing cells. Similarly, BET inhibitor treatment also decreased expression and 
ERG and its downstream targets19,32, which is consistent with our finding that knockdown 
of ERG had little or no effect on SPOP mutation-induced resistance to BET inhibitor. These 
data suggest that intrinsic BET inhibitor resistance develops independently of the elevated 
AR and ERG signaling in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer cells. It is worth noting that both 
AR and ERG directly interact with the bromodomain of BRD4 and their interactions are 
both sensitive to JQ16,19,32. At present, it is unclear why AR and ERG are vulnerable to 
BET inhibition irrespective of elevated BET proteins in SPOP-mutated cells, and whether or 
not this is due to their JQ1-sensitive binding of BET proteins (Supplementary Fig. 10j) 
warrants further investigation. We also show that expression of SPOP-F133V mutant not 
only increases the basal levels of phosphorylation of AKT-mTORC1 pathway proteins, but 
also largely impedes JQ1-induced inhibition of their phosphorylation. Accordingly, we 
uncover that the levels of RAC1 and cholesterol biosynthesis genes, both of which are 
required for activation of the AKT-mTORC1 pathway21,23–25, are upregulated in SPOP-
mutated prostate tumors in patients. Therefore, in addition to demonstrating the essential 
role of elevated BET proteins and activation of the AKT-mTORC1 pathway in the resistance 
to BET inhibition as a consequence of SPOP mutation in prostate cancer cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 10j), we also provide evidence that targeting the AKT pathway using 
novel therapeutic agents such as the novel AKT inhibitor Ipatasertib can be a viable 
treatment option to overcome BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer.

Expression vectors for SPOP-WT or mutants are described previously34. FLAG-BRD2 and 
BRD3 constructs were obtained from Dr. S.J. Flint (Princeton University). FLAG-BRD4 
constructs were obtained from Dr. Tasuku Honjo (Kyoto University). FLAG-BRD2/3/4 
mutants were generated by KOD Plus Mutagenesis Kit (TOYOBO) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. lenticrisprV2 plasmid (#52961).was purchased from Addgene 
(USA).
Cell culture, transfection and lentivirus infection
LNCaP, 22Rv1 and 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC). C4-2 cells were purchased from Uro Corporation (Oklahoma City, OK). BPH-1 
cells were kindly provided by Dr. Simon Hayward35. 293T cells were maintained in DMEM 
medium with 10% FBS, while LNCaP, C4-2, 22Rv1 and BPH-1 cells were maintained in 
RPMI medium with 10% FBS. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine RNAi 
MAX (for siRNA transfection) or 3000 (for plasmids transfection) (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. pTsin-HA-SPOP-F133V mutant 
expression or pLKO-based gene knocking down lentivirus vectors or lenticrisprV2-
BRD4and packing constructs were transfected into 293T cells. Virus supernatant was 
collected 48 h after transfection. C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells were infected with viral supernatant 
in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml) and were then selected in growth media containing 
1.5 μg/ml puromycin. Sequences of gene-specific shRNAs are listed in Extended Data Table 
6. All the cell lines used have been tested and authenticated by karyotyping and prostate 
cancer cell lines have also been authenticated by examining AR expression and SPOP 
mutation status. Plasmocin (InvivoGen) was added to cell culture media to prevent 
mycoplasma contamination. Mycoplasma contamination was tested regularly using Lookout 
Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit from Sigma-Aldrich.

Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit.
Prostate cancer patient samples
Treatment-naive prostate cancer and matched benign tissues were collected from the radical 
prostatectomy series at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, and the institutional review board of 
the hospital approved the experimental protocols. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides of 
frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human tumor tissues and matched 
benign tissues were examined by a general pathologists and a genitourinary pathologist to 
confirm histological diagnosis, Gleason score and verify the high-density cancer foci 
(>80%) of the selected tumor tissue. The frozen blocks for DNA/RNA extraction were 
examined by the pathologists as described above, followed by consecutive ten 10-μm 
sections of each tumor. These qualified samples were then used for DNA/RNA isolation. 
FFPE tissues were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Detection of SPOP mutation prostate cancer patient specimens by whole-genome and 
Sanger sequencing
For whole genome sequencing, DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform and purified by 
the ethanol precipitation method from 32 paired tumor and benign frozen patient samples. 
DNA samples were fragmented in fragmentation buffer using Covaris Ultrasonicator system. 
The fragmented DNA with average length of 500 bp was subjected to DNA library 
construction. Libraries were constructed according to Illumina’s protocol with DNA 
samples. High-throughput short-gun sequencing was performed on the IlluminaHiSeq 2000 
platform. For DNA sequencing, pair-end reads with length of 90 bp were generated. Raw 
reads of DNA sequencing were filtered using an in-house pipeline. Clean DNA reads were 
processed with SAMTools to remove the PCR duplicates and aligned to the human reference 
genome hg19 with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). The whole 
genome sequencing data have been deposited in The European Genome-phenome Archive 
with the accession # EGAS00001000888.
For Sanger sequencing, DNA was extracted from all 99 cases of FFPE prostate cancer 
tissues using a QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit. PCR was performed and PCR products were 
purified using a GeneJET Extraction kit according to manufacturer’s instruction and used for 
Sanger sequencing. The primers used for DNA amplification were: Amp-Exon6-Forward 5′-
ACCCATAGCTTTGGTTTCTTCTCCC-3′; Amp-Exon6-Reverse 5′-TATCTGTTT 
TGGACAGGTGTTTGCG-3′; Amp-Exon7-Forward 5′-
ACTCATCAGATCTGGGAACTGC-3′; Amp-Exon7-Reverse 5′-
AGTTGTGGCTTTGATCTGGTT-3′. Amp-Exon6-Reverse and Amp-Exon7-Forward were 
also used for Sanger sequencing.
Yeast two-hybrid screen
Yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with the full-length SPOP cloned in-frame with the 
GAL4 DNA binding domain in vector PGBKT7 (Clontech). The yeast cells were 
transformed with PGBKT7-SPOP and the human fetal brain cDNA library. A total of 2 × 
107 independent clones were screened by growth in deficient medium and X-gal staining.

 The positive clones were subsequently retested in fresh yeast cells, and the identities of prey 
were determined with interaction sequence tags (ISTs) obtained by DNA sequencing. The 
reading frame was verified.
RNA interference
Non-specific control siRNA and gene-specific siRNAs for human SPOP and BRD4 were 
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Dharmacon. siRNA transfection of cells was 
performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of siRNA oligos are: 
siSPOP#1 5′-GGAUGAUGUAAAUGAGCAA-3′; siSPOP#2 5′-
GGACAGCGACTCTGAATCT-3′; siBRD4#1 5′-GAACCUCCCUGAUUACUAU-3′; 
siBRD4#2 5′-AGCUGAACCUCCCUGAUUA-3′; non-specific control siRNA (siC) 5′-
ACAGACUUCGGAGUACCUG-3′.
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
To immunoprecipitate the ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged proteins, transfected cells 
were lysed 24 h post-transfection in BC100 buffer. The whole-cell lysates were 
immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated M2 agarose beads 
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C overnight. After three washes with lysis buffer, followed by two 
washes with BC100 buffer, the bound proteins were eluted using FLAG-Peptide (Sigma-
Aldrich) prepared in BC100 for 3 h at 4°C. The eluted protein sample was resolved by SDS-
PAGE. To immunoprecipitate the endogenous proteins, cells were lysed with 1× cell lysis 
buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), and the lysate was centrifuged. The supernatant was 
precleared with protein A/G beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated with indicated antibody 
and protein A/G beads at 4°C overnight. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and 
resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Western blot
Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins were 
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Sciences). The membranes were 
blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% 
Tween-20, washed twice in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, and incubated with primary 
antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The 
proteins of interest were visualized using ECL chemiluminescence system (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology). Densitometry analysis of protein bands was analyzed on the Gel-Pro 
Analyzer software.
In vitro ubiquitination assay
In vitro ubiquitination assay was carried out using a protocol reported previously1. Briefly, 2 
μg APP-BP1/Uba3, 2 μg His-UBE2M enzymes and 5 μg NEDD8 were incubated at 30°C 
for 2 h in the presence of ATP. The thioester loaded His-UBE2M-NEDD8 was further 
incubated with 3 μg His-DCNL2, 6 μg CUL3/RBX1 at 4°C for 2 h to obtain the 
NEDDylated CUL3/RBX1. The NEDDylated CUL3/RBX1, 5 μg GST-SPOP, 5 μg Ub, 500 
ng E1, 750 ng E2 (UbcH5a and UbcH5b), and 5 μg His-BRD4-N (amino acids 1–500) were 
incubated with 0.6 μl 100 mM ATP, 1.5 μl 20 μM ubiquitin aldehyde, 3 μl 10 × ubiquitin

mM DTT), 3 μl 10 × energy regeneration mix (200 mM creatine phosphate and 2 μg/μl 
creatine phosphokinase), 3 μl 10 × protease inhibitor cocktail at 30°C for 2 h, followed by 
western blot analysis. The Ub, E1, E2 and CUL3/RBX1 were purchased from 
UBIQUIGENT.
In vivo ubiquitination assay
For in vivo ubiquitination assay, C4-2 cells transfected with plasmids for HA-Ub, FLAG-
BRD4 and other indicated proteins. Cells were treated with 20 μM MG132 for 8 h before 
harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC)). The lysate was subjected 
to co-immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads as described in Co-IP 
assay.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from transiently transfected cells using the Trizol reagent (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific), and cDNA was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript RT kit 
(TOYOBO, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification was 
performed using the SYBR Green PCR master mix Kit (TOYOBO, Japan). All quantization 
were normalized to the level of endogenous control GAPDH. The primer sequences for the 
SYBR green qPCR used are as follows: BRD2-F: 5′-CTACGTAAGAAACCCCGGAAG-3′;

 Trypan blue assay
Trypan blue assay was performed to measure cell growth according to manufacturer’s 
instructions. Briefly, cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 5×104 ~ 1×105 cells 
per well. At the indicated time points, cells were trypsinized and suspended in 1 mL 1×PBS. 
100 μL cells and 100 μL trypan blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed and the number 
of viable cells was measured using the Bio-Rad automated cell counter.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
FFPE tumor samples from patients or C4-2 xenograft tumors were deparaffinized, 
rehydrated, and subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval. UltraSensitive ™ S-P (Rabbit) 
IHC Kit (KIT-9706, Fuzhou Maixin Biotech) was used by following the manufacturer’s 
instructions with minor modification as reported previously37. Briefly, the sections were 
incubated with 3% H2O2 for 15 min at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidase 
activity. After antigen retrieval using unmasking solution (Vector Labs), slides were blocked 
with normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight. 
IHC analysis of tumor samples was performed using primary antibodies against BRD2 
(dilution 1:250; Abcam; catalog number: ab139690), BRD3 (dilution 1:200; Bethyl; catalog 
number: A302-368A), and BRD4 (dilution 1:500; Bethyl; catalog number: A301-985A100). 
The sections were then washed 3 times in 1 × PBS and treated for 30 min with biotinylated 
goat-anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Fuzhou Maixin Biotech). After washing three 
times in 1 × PBS, sections were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated HRP (Fuzhou 
Maixin Biotech). After washing three times in 1 × PBS for 5 min each, specific detection 
was developed with 3′3-diaminobenzidine (DAB-2031, Fuzhou Maixin Biotech). Images 
were taken by using an Olympus camera and matched software. The IHC staining was 
scored by two independent pathologists based on the ‘most common’ criteria.
RNA extraction from FFPE patient tissues and RT-qPCR
These experiments were performed using the method described previously38–40. Briefly, a 4-
μm pre-cut H&E stained section was obtained and reviewed by a pathologist. Only blocks 
with ≥ 80% tumor cells were used. Total RNA was isolated from FFPE tissue sections from 
the same cohorts of patients using the RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Catalog no. 73504) using 
the method as reported previously41. The NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) was used to assess the RNA yield and quality. The cDNA was synthesized 
using PrimeScript™RT reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time) according to the Manufacturer’s 
instruction (TaKaRa, Catalog no. RR037A) with minor modifications. qPCR was performed 
using SYBR®Premix Ex Taq™II (Tli RNaseH Plus) (TaKaRa, Catalog no. RR820A) on a 
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to TaKaRa’s 
recommended cycling conditions (95 °C for 30s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 
60 °C for 30 s and a melt curve analysis). 18S RNA served as internal reference as reported 
previously42. The primers used in RT-qPCR were listed in Extended Data Table 6. All the 
samples were run in triplicate on the same plate and the expression level of BRD2/3/4 
mRNA was automatically calculated by the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). The comparison of the expression level of BRD2/3/4 mRNA was 
performed with Mann-Whitney test by the MedCalc statistical software Version 10.4.7.0

 (MedCalc Software bvba, Mariakerke, Belgium). Two-sided P < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RNA-seq and data analysis
C4-2 cells infected with lentivirus expressing empty vector (EV), HA-SPOP-F133V or 
BRD2/3/4 were treated with or without JQ1 (1 μM) for 24 h. Total RNAs were isolated from 
cells using the methods as described previously43. Briefly, RNA was isolated using RNeasy 
Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). High quality (Agilent Bioanalyzer RIN >7.0) total RNAs were 
employed for the preparation of sequencing libraries using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total 
RNA/Ribo-Zero Sample Prep Kit. A total of 500–1,000 ng of riboRNA-depleted total RNA 
was fragmented by RNase III treatment at 37°C for 10–18 min and RNase III was 
inactivated at 65°C for 10 min. Size selection (50 to 150 bp fragments) was performed using 
the FlashPAGE denaturing PAGE-fractionator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to ethanol 
precipitation overnight. The resulting RNA was directionally ligated, reverse-transcribed and 
RNase H treated.
Samples with biological triplicates were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform 
at the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility. Pre-analysis quality control was performed 
using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and RSeQC 
software44 to ensure that raw data are in excellent condition and suitable for downstream 
analyses. Pair-end raw reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRch37/hg19) 
using Tophat45. Genome-wide coverage signals were represented in BigWig format to 
facilitate convenient visualization using the UCSC genome browser. Gene expression was 
measured using RPKM (Reads Per Kilo-base exon per Million mapped reads) as described 
previously46. EdgeR47 was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed between 
EV-expressing and SPOP-F133V-expressing C4-2 cells treated with or without JQ1. Raw 
and processed data have been deposited into NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with 
accession number GSE88872.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq) and data analysis, and 
ChIP-qPCR
ChIP was performed as described previously48. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using the 
methods as described previously48 and high throughput sequencing was performed using the 
Illumina HiSeq2000 platforms at the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility. The data were 
analyzed using the following pipeline: ChIP-seq raw reads were aligned to the human 
reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using Bowtie2 (2.2.9), and reads mapped to one or two 
locations were kept for further analysis, peak calling was performed by MACS2 (2.1.1) with 
p-value threshold of 1e-5. BigWig files were generated for visualization with the UCSC 
genome browser or IGV. We used GREAT (http://bejerano.stanford.edu/great/public/html/) 
to assign peaks to their potential target genes (a peak-gene association is determined if the 
peak falls into 2 kb region centering on the transcription start site of the gene). The common 
BRD4 target genes induced by SPOP F133V and HA-BRD4 expression were determined 
independently in each of two biological repeat experiments. Raw and processed data have 
been deposited into NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with accession number GSE88872.

Meta-analysis of publically available BRD4 and histone mark ChIP-seq data
BRD4 ChIP-seq data in HEK293T and HeLa cells (accession number GSE51633)49, H2171 
and U87 cells (accession number GSE44931)50 and mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
cells (accession number GSE66122)51 as well as H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data in 
LNCaP cells52 were downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. If the original 
alignments were based on hg18/GRCh36, they were converted into hg19/GRCh37 based-
alignments using CrossMap53. Peak calling were performed using MACS2 (v2.0.10)54.
Analysis of JQ1-resistant gene expression in the TCGA dataset and pathway analysis
Primary tumor samples from the prostate cancer cohort in TCGA have been classified into 
SPOP-MUT (with mutation, N = 48) and SPOP-WT (without mutation, N = 449) groups 
according to the mutation status of SPOP. Differential expression between the above two 
groups for the JQ1-resistant genes (n = 1,017) were investigated by Mann–Whitney test with 
the significance threshold of P-value < 0.001. A total of 129 genes have been identified as 
up-regulated in SPOP-MUT samples. The heat-map was generated using the z-score 
transformed expression of each gene across all samples. Pathway analyses were performed 
using Ingenuity IPA.
Cholesterol analysis
The cells were washed with PBS with twice and lysed in the buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl 
(pH7.6), 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM β-Methylphenethylamine, 2 mM Na3VO4 
and 1 mM PMSF) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were extracted in the chloroform/
methanol/HCl as described previously55. The cholesterol concentration was measured using 
the Infinity reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

 Generation and treatment of prostate cancer xenografts in mice
6-week-old NOD-SCID IL-2-receptor gamma null (NSG) mice were generated in house and 
randomly divided into different experimental groups as indicated. The animal study was 
approved by the IACUC at Mayo Clinic. All mice were housed in standard conditions with a 
12 h light/dark cycle and access to food and water ad libitum. For BRD2/3/4 knockdown 
studies, C4-2 cells (5×106), infected with lentivirus expressing empty vector (EV) or HA-
SPOP-F133V mutant in combination with control shRNA or BRD2/3/4-specific, were mixed 
with Matrigel (in 100 μl 1×PBS plus 100 μl Matrigel (BD Biosciences)) and injected s.c. 
into the right flank of mice. After xenografts reached the size of approximately 100 mm3, 
vehicle (10% beta cyclodextrin) or JQ1 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 50 mg/kg body weight was 
administered by i.p. injection 5 days a week. For studies with tumors treated with JQ1 and 
AKT inhibitor GDC-0068, C4-2 cells (5×106) infected with lentivirus expressing empty 
vector (EV) or HA-SPOP-F133V mutant were mixed with Matrigel (in 100 μl 1×PBS plus 
100 μl Matrigel (BD Biosciences)) and injected s.c. into the right flank of mice. After 
xenografts reached the size of approximately 100 mm3, vehicle (10% beta cyclodextrin), 
JQ1 (50 mg/kg) or GDC-0068 (100 mg/kg) were administrated individually or in 
combination 5 days a week. Growth in tumor volume was measured in a blinded fashion 
using digital caliper and tumor volumes were estimated using the formula (L×W2)/2, where 
L is length of tumor and W is width. The volumes of tumors were compared and P values 
were determined by a two-tailed Student’s t test. Upon the completion of treatment, tumor 
grafts were harvested. Tumor tissues were divided, and a portion was subjected to FFPE and 
the rest was frozen for protein and RNA extraction.
Statistical analysis
All data are shown as mean values ± SD for experiments performed with at least three 
replicates. The difference between 2 groups was analyzed using paired Student’s t-test 
unless otherwise specified. A P value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
Data-availability statement
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data are available at the NCBI’s GEO data repository with the 
accession code GSE88872. Source data for the uncropped western blots along with
