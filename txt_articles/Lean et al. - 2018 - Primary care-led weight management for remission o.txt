 SUMMARY 
Background: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disorder that requires lifelong treatment. We aimed to 
assess whether intensive weight management within routine primary care would achieve remission 
of type 2 diabetes. 
Methods: We did this open-label, cluster-randomised trial (DiRECT) at 49 primary care practices in 
Scotland and the Tyneside region of England. Practices were randomly assigned (1:1), via a 
computer-generated list, to provide either a weight management programme (intervention) or best-
practice care by guidelines (control), with stratification for study site (Tyneside or Scotland) and 
practice list size (>5700 or ≤5700). Participants, carers, and research assistants who collected 
outcome data were aware of group allocation; however, allocation was concealed from the study 
statistician. We recruited individuals aged 20–65 years who had been diagnosed with type 2 
diabetes within the past 6 years, had a body-mass index of 27–45 kg/m2, and were not receiving 
insulin. The intervention comprised withdrawal of antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, total diet 
replacement (825–853 kcal/day formula diet for 3–5 months), stepped food reintroduction (2–8 
weeks), and structured support for long-term weight loss maintenance. Co-primary outcomes were 
weight loss of 15 kg or more, and remission of diabetes, defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 
less than 6·5% (<48 mmol/mol) after at least 2 months off all antidiabetic medications, from baseline 
to 12 months. These outcomes were analysed hierarchically. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN 
registry, number 03267836. 
Findings: Between July 25, 2014, and Aug 5, 2017, we recruited 306 individuals from 49 intervention 
(n=23) and control (n=26) general practices; 149 participants per group comprised the intention-to-
treat population. At 12 months, we recorded weight loss of 15 kg or more in 36 (24%) participants in 
the intervention group and no participants in the control group (p<0·0001). Diabetes remission was 
achieved in 68 (46%) participants in the intervention group and six (4%) participants in the control 
group (odds ratio 19·7, 95% CI 7·8–49·8; p<0·0001). Remission varied with weight loss in the whole 
study population, with achievement in none of 76 participants who gained weight, six (7%) of 89 
 participants who maintained 0–5 kg weight loss, 19 (34%) of 56 participants with 5–10 kg loss, 16 
(57%) of 28 participants with 10–15 kg loss, and 31 (86%) of 36 participants who lost 15 kg or more. 
Mean bodyweight fell by 10·0 kg (SD 8·0) in the intervention group and 1·0 kg (3·7) in the control 
group (adjusted difference −8·8 kg, 95% CI −10·3 to −7·3; p<0·0001). Quality of life, as measured by 
the EuroQol 5 Dimensions visual analogue scale, improved by 7·2 points (SD 21·3) in the intervention 
group, and decreased by 2·9 points (15·5) in the control group (adjusted difference 6·4 points, 95% 
CI 2·5–10·3; p=0·0012). Nine serious adverse events were reported by seven (4%) of 157 participants 
in the intervention group and two were reported by two (1%) participants in the control group. Two 
serious adverse events (biliary colic and abdominal pain), occurring in the same participant, were 
deemed potentially related to the intervention. No serious adverse events led to withdrawal from 
the study. 
Interpretation: Our findings show that, at 12 months, almost half of participants achieved remission 
to a non-diabetic state and off antidiabetic drugs. Remission of type 2 diabetes is a practical target 
for primary care.

Introduction 
Type 2 diabetes affects almost one in ten adults in the UK, and 422 million adults worldwide.1,2 Most 
people with type 2 diabetes have disease-related morbidity and reduced longevity. The disease is 
particularly devastating for the growing numbers of younger people affected, who tend to be more 
obese and lose more life-years through diabetes.3  Current guidelines for management of type 2 
diabetes focus heavily on multiple drug treatments to reduce blood glucose and the associated 
elevated risks of cardiovascular disease, but life expectancy remains substantially reduced. 
Type 2 diabetes is strongly related to weight gain in adult life and accumulation of excess fat within 
the liver and pancreas. The twin cycle hypothesis,4 which postulated that type 2 diabetes is caused 
 specifically by excess fat within the liver and pancreas, was tested by inducing negative energy 
balance with a 600–700 kcal/day diet. Liver insulin resistance and fat content normalised within 7 
days, with first-phase insulin response and pancreas fat content normalising over 8 weeks.5  In a 
subsequent parallel-group study,6 the underlying changes were shown to remain stable over a 6 
month period of isocaloric eating. These pathophysiological studies established how and why people 
with type 2 diabetes can be returned to normal glucose control by calorie restriction. The challenge 
remained to test whether such an intervention was practicable in routine primary care. Other 
studies involving weight loss of at least 10–15 kg have been shown to achieve normalisations of 
blood glucose in people with short-duration type 2 diabetes,7,8,9,10 but no previous trial based on 
dietary change has assessed sustained (ie, ≥1 year) disease remission as a primary outcome. 
We did the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) to assess whether effective weight 
management, delivered in the primary care setting, could produce sustained remission of type 2 
diabetes. 
Study design and participants 
We did this open-label, cluster-randomised trial at 49 primary care practices in Scotland and the 
Tyneside region of England. General practices (GPs) representing populations with a wide range of 
social and geographic features were invited to participate by the Primary Care Research Network 
(PCRN) in Scotland, and North East Commissioning Support in Tyneside. Ethics approval was granted 
by West 3 Ethics Committee in January, 2014, with approvals by the National Health Service (NHS) 
health board areas in Scotland and clinical commissioning groups in Tyneside. The protocol, 
including details of recruitment methods, study conduct, and planned analyses, has been published 
elsewhere.11  
There were no specific eligibility criteria for practices. Eligible participants were aged 20–65 years, 
had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the previous 6 years, and had a body-mass index 
 (BMI) of 27–45 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria were current insulin use, a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
concentration of 12% or more (≥108 mmol/mol), weight loss of more than 5 kg within the past 6 
months, a recent on-record estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min per 1·732 
m2, severe or unstable heart failure, participation in another clinical research trial, substance abuse, 
known cancer, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, learning difficulties, current 
treatment with anti-obesity drugs, presence of an eating disorder or purging behaviour, pregnancy 
or consideration of pregnancy, and hospital admission for depression or use of antipsychotic drugs. 
After review of data from the first practices to enter the study, it was necessary to tighten the 
criteria for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes to exclude patients who had already achieved non-diabetic 
HbA1c. The inclusion criteria were revised to specify that the most recent HbA1c value should be 
greater than 6·0% (>43 mmol/mol) and, if less than 6·5% (<48 mmol/mol), individuals should still be 
receiving antidiabetic medication. This substantial amendment was approved by the trial steering 
committee, ethics committee, and all NHS research and development departments on Nov 27, 2014. 
All participants provided written informed consent. 
Randomisation and masking 
The primary care practice was the unit of randomisation to enable consistent management of type 2 
diabetes within practices and avoid contamination between treatment groups. Practices agreeing to 
participate were randomly assigned (1:1) by the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics (University of 
Glasgow, UK), via a computer-generated list, to provide either an evidence-based weight 
management programme (Counterweight-Plus; intervention)12 or best-practice care by guidelines 
(control). Randomisation was stratified to maintain balance for practice list size (>5700 or ≤5700) 
across intervention groups within each study region. 
Due to the nature of the lifestyle intervention being examined, participants, carers, and research 
assistants who collected outcome data were aware of group allocation; however, allocation was 
 concealed from the study statistician in charge of developing and conducting the statistical analysis 
programme (AM). 
Procedures 
Potentially eligible participants were mailed an invitation pack, including an information sheet, by 
the PCRN (Scotland) and GP staff in Tyneside (independently of the research team), and asked to 
respond using a reply-paid envelope. To help balance the incentive of the intervention itself, 
participants in the control group were offered a £50 Amazon voucher. Individuals who did not 
respond were sent a reminder or telephoned; those interested in participating were invited to an 
initial appointment. 
A nurse or dietitian (as available locally) in each intervention practice was given a total of 8 h 
structured training by the study research dietitians experienced in Counterweight-Plus. Training 
followed a standard protocol, to minimise variability and maintain fidelity across all practices. 
Mentoring of nurses and dietitians was done by the study research dietitians during each stage of 
the intervention, with feedback as required. 
Participants in the intervention group were asked to follow the Counterweight-Plus weight 
management programme,12  with a stated aim of achieving and maintaining at least 15 kg weight loss 
for the maximum number of participants and an emphasis on flexibility to accommodate individual 
circumstances and optimise outcomes. Weight loss was induced with a total diet replacement phase 
using a low energy formula diet (825–853 kcal/day; 59% carbohydrate, 13% fat, 26% protein, 2% 
fibre) for 3 months (extendable up to 5 months if wished by participant), followed by structured 
food reintroduction of 2–8 weeks (about 50% carbohydrate, 35% total fat, and 15% protein), and an 
ongoing structured programme with monthly visits for long-term weight loss maintenance. All oral 
antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs were discontinued on day 1 of the weight management 
programme, with standard protocols for drug reintroduction under national clinical guidelines, if 
 indicated by regular monitoring of blood glucose and blood pressure.11  Antihypertensive drugs were 
withdrawn because blood pressure rapidly decreases upon commencement of a low energy diet.6  
Participants were encouraged to maintain their usual physical activities during total diet 
replacement, but not asked to increase activity at this stage. Step counters were provided at the 
start of food reintroduction, and physical activity strategies were introduced, to help participants in 
the intervention group to reach and maintain their individual sustainable maximum—up to 15 000 
steps per day. Physical activity and sleep were objectively measured over 7 days by use of wrist-
worn triaxial accelerometers; data were assessed with validated calibration and analysis 
algorithms.13,14  
Participants in both groups continued to receive diabetes care under current guidelines and 
standards from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence in England 15and the Scottish 
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network in Scotland.16  All study appointments took place at the 
participants' own GP practices. 
Outcomes 
The co-primary outcomes were a reduction in weight of 15 kg or more, and remission of diabetes, 
defined as HbA1c less than 6·5% (<48 mmol/mol) after at least 2 months off all antidiabetic 
medications, from baseline to month 12. Secondary outcomes assessed at 12 months were quality of 
life, as measured by the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D); serum lipids; and physical activity. Other 
pre-specified outcomes included programme acceptability, sleep quality, and blood pressure, as 
detailed in the protocol.11  We additionally assessed exploratory outcomes of effects on changes in 
medications. 
All outcome data were collected at baseline and at 12 months. For participants who ceased to 
engage and did not attend their 12 month trial appointment, data from GP records (within a window 
 of plus or minus 3 months of the scheduled follow-up date) were used if available, as pre-specified in 
the protocol.11 
Statistical analysis 
The planned primary analyses were done at the individual level, according to the intention-to-treat 
principle. The co-primary outcomes were analysed in a hierarchical manner, the weight loss 
outcome first, with no adjustment of the p values for multiple comparisons. For participants who did 
not attend the 12 month study assessment, and for whom data could not be obtained from GP 
records, we made the assumption that the primary outcomes were not met. For the main analysis of 
secondary outcomes, no assumptions were made regarding missing data. To provide comparability 
with other published data for weight changes, we did a sensitivity analysis with different models to 
impute values for missing data. 
Sample-size calculations indicated that recruitment of 280 participants would be required to achieve 
80% power. These calculations assumed diabetes remission in 22% of participants in the 
intervention group at 1 year (the effect size deemed potentially important, a priori) compared with 
an estimated 5% in the control group, enrolment of ten participants per practice (fixed), an intraclass 
correlation coefficient of 0·05 to account for cluster randomisation, and an estimated dropout rate 
of 25% within 12 months. 
Outcomes were compared between groups with mixed-effects regression models, with adjustment 
for GP practice as a random effect. Logistic models were used for binary outcomes, and Gaussian 
models for continuous outcomes. For serum triglyceride, groups were compared with a linear 
regression model of log-transformed values, with adjustment for baseline log triglyceride. All models 
were adjusted for the minimisation variables (study centre and practice list size). Models of 
continuous outcomes were also adjusted for the baseline measurement of the outcome. 
 For continuous outcomes, model fit was assessed visually with normal probability plots. When 
substantial departure from a normal distribution was observed, groups were also compared with 
non-parametric Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests, using both the 12 month value of the outcome 
measure and the change from baseline. For binary outcomes, when the number of cases or non-
cases was zero in one of the randomised groups and the regression model would not converge, we 
compared groups with Fisher's exact test. 
Statistical analyses were done with R for Windows, version 3.2.4. This trial is registered with the 
ISRCTN registry, number 03267836. 
Role of the funding source 
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data 
interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and the 
corresponding author had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 
Results 
Recruitment and baseline data have been published elsewhere.17  Between July 25, 2014, and Aug 5, 
2016, we recruited 306 individuals from 49 intervention (n=23) and control (n=26) practices; 149 
participants per group comprised the intention-to-treat population (figure 1). Baseline 
characteristics were similar between groups (Table 1).17 
23 (8%) participants were lost to follow-up at 12 months, with 128 (86%) participants in the 
intervention group and 147 (99%) participants in the control group attending the 12 month study 
assessment. Four (3%) participants in the intervention group did not provide a 12 month blood 
sample for HbA1c measurement. Additional data were obtained from GP records for weight for ten 
(3%) participants (n=9 intervention and n=1 control) and HbA1c for 15 (5%) participants (n=14 and 
n=1, respectively). GP records were unavailable for one participant in each group. Thus, data for the 
first primary outcome (weight loss ≥15kg) were available for 285 (96%) participants (n=137 
 intervention and n=148 control), and for the second primary outcome (diabetes remission) for 290 
(97%) participants (n=142 and n=148, respectively). For the intention-to-treat analysis, the 
remaining participants with missing data were assumed to have not met each primary outcome 
(figure 1). 
In the intervention group, six (4%) participants consented, but thereafter never engaged with the 
intervention, and 26 (17%) participants withdrew from treatment during the first 12 months (n=15 
during total diet replacement, n=6 during stepped food reintroduction, and n=5 during weight loss 
maintenance). The intention-to-treat analysis included data for all these participants. 
At 12 months, we recorded weight loss of 15 kg or more in 36 (24%) participants in the intervention 
group and no participants in the control group (Fisher's exact p<0·0001; figure 2). We recorded 
diabetes remission in 68 (46%) participants in the intervention group and six (4%) participants in the 
control group (odds ratio 19·7, 95% CI 7·8–49·8; p<0·0001, Fig 2). 
Mean bodyweight fell by 10·0 kg in the intervention group and by 1·0 kg in the control group 
(adjusted difference at −8·8 kg, 95% CI −10·3 to −7·3; p<0·0001; Table 2). Similar patterns were 
recorded for BMI and weight change as a percentage of baseline weight (appendix p2). Sensitivity 
analyses using alternative assumptions regarding missing data for weight at 12 months gave similar 
results (appendix pp2,3) For participants in the intervention group who engaged with the 
intervention, weight fell sharply during the total diet replacement phase, by 14·5 kg (95% CI 13·4–
15·5), followed by small increases during the food reintroduction phase (1·0 kg [0·3–1·6]) and the 
weight loss management phase (1·9 kg [1·2–2·5];Fig 3). Patients who completed the total diet 
replacement phase had greater weight loss, and those who completed the food reintroduction 
phase less weight gain, than did patients who started, but did not complete, each phase (figure 3, 
appendix p4). 
 Mean bodyweight fell by 10·0 kg in the intervention group and by 1·0 kg in the control group 
(adjusted difference at −8·8 kg, 95% CI −10·3 to −7·3; p<0·0001; Table 2). Similar patterns were 
recorded for BMI and weight change as a percentage of baseline weight (appendix p2). Sensitivity 
analyses using alternative assumptions regarding missing data for weight at 12 months gave similar 
results (appendix pp 2,3).  For participants in the intervention group who engaged with the 
intervention, weight fell sharply during the total diet replacement phase, by 14·5 kg (95% CI 13·4–
15·5), followed by small increases during the food reintroduction phase (1·0 kg [0·3–1·6]) and the 
weight loss management phase (1·9 kg [1·2–2·5]; figure 3). Patients who completed the total diet 
replacement phase had greater weight loss, and those who completed the food reintroduction 
phase less weight gain, than did patients who started, but did not complete, each phase (figures 3, 
appendix p4). 
 
The appendix (p10) shows the number of participants who self-reported adverse events that were 
pre-specified as being of interest during the intervention. Of 139 participants who underwent total 
diet replacement, the most frequently reported adverse events, occurring over a mean duration of 
16·0 weeks (SD 5·3), were constipation (n=65), increased sensitivity to cold (n=51), headache (n=53), 
and dizziness (n=49). Most of these adverse events were of mild or moderate severity and dissipated 
over time (appendix p10). Besides constipation, no event required treatment. Fewer adverse events 
were reported during the food reintroduction and weight loss management phases than during the 
total diet replacement phase (appendix p10).  Information about symptoms was collected only from 
participants in the intervention group. 
 
 Discussion 
Our findings confirm that type 2 diabetes of up to 6 years' duration is not necessarily a permanent, 
lifelong condition. Weight loss sufficient to achieve remission can be attained in many individuals by 
use of an evidence-based structured weight management programme delivered in a non-specialist 
community setting by routine primary care staff. Just less than a quarter of participants in the 
intervention group achieved weight loss of 15 kg or more at 12 months, half maintained more than 
10 kg loss, and almost half had remission of diabetes, off antidiabetic medication. This result is 
substantially in excess of the 22% remission rate that was deemed a priori to be clinically important, 
and that informed the power calculation. Remission was closely related to the degree of weight loss 
maintained at 12 months, with achievement in 86% of participants with at least 15 kg weight loss, 
and 73% of those with weight loss of 10 kg or more. 28% of all eligible individuals volunteered to 
participate,17 and 79% completed the intensive total diet replacement phase, in keeping with 
evidence showing that people with type 2 diabetes rank reversal of the disease as their top priority 
for research.18 
The approach used in DiRECT differs from many weight management treatments in its structured 
design, with a focus from the outset on the need for long-term maintenance of weight loss. 
Individual flexibility is important to optimise individual results. Durations of the weight loss and food 
reintroduction phases were allowed to vary within reasonably wide boundaries. The need for 
flexibility during the total diet replacement phase was largely for social reasons, and during food 
reintroduction to allow individuals longer, if needed, to adapt to new normal eating habits. 
Behavioural change methods were incorporated in the weight loss maintenance phase, including 
elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. Participants in the intervention group were advised to 
continue and not decrease their usual daily activities. During food reintroduction and weight loss 
maintenance, participants were advised on strategies to raise physical activity towards a target of 
15 000 steps per day. It was recognised that this target was unlikely to be achieved by many, and 
 objectively measured physical activity showed no increase in physical activity in either group 
between baseline and 12 months, which underlines the difficulty this population have in maintaining 
increased activity. The weight changes seen at 12 months in the intention-to-treat population of the 
present study are similar to those reported in a Counterweight-Plus feasibility study (−9·5 kg in 
intention-to-treat analyses with baseline observation carried forward [n=91])12 and in an audit of its 
use in routine primary care, including patients with type 2 diabetes (−10·5 kg in intention-to-treat 
analyses with imputed data [n=217]).19   Findings from Franz and colleagues' meta-analysis20 showed 
an average weight change of about 10 kg at 12 months from interventions with very low calorie 
diets. Weight losses in DiRECT are greater than those reported in similar published studies of people 
with type 2 diabetes. The Counterbalance study6 reported similar weight loss, but was intensively 
managed with very low calorie diet in a research centre. Look AHEAD21 delivered a heavily supported 
programme in specialist centres, combining physical activity and dietary programme, and achieved a 
mean weight loss of 8·6 kg. Remission of type 2 diabetes was not the primary outcome in Look 
AHEAD, but was observed in 11·5% of participants after 1 year and 7·5% after 4 years, with 9·2% 
achieving remission for at least 2 years.22  A Finnish study23 showed improved glucose control and 
reduced use of diabetes medication after years 1 and 2 of a lifestyle intervention. More than 25 
years ago, Wing and colleagues24 reported improvement of HbA1c, from a higher baseline level than 
DiRECT, after a very low calorie diet intervention under specialist supervision, with mean weight loss 
at 12 months of 8·6 kg. The present study differs importantly from most previous ones in that it was 
done under real-life conditions, delivered by the available local nurses or dietitians rather than by 
specialist staff. The study also included a greater proportion of men than normally seen in weight 
loss trials. Furthermore, no previous registered study has set remission of type 2 diabetes as a 
primary outcome. 
Bariatric surgery has dominated discussions of type 2 diabetes remission as the most effective way 
of producing major weight loss.8,9,10  However, this option comes at a high financial cost and with the 
 risk of long-term problems, such as post-prandial hypoglycaemia, and micronutrient deficiencies that 
restrict acceptability.25,26  The large numbers of people with type 2 diabetes makes it impossible to 
offer surgery to all people, even if this approach were financially possible and palatable to everyone. 
The essential mechanisms behind bariatric surgery are weight loss and decrease in body fat content, 
rather than any direct surgical effect.27,28,29,30,31  The very large weight losses targeted by bariatric 
surgery are not essential for achievement of remission of type 2 diabetes, as shown by the present 
data. Changes in intra-organ fat content and β-cell function in a subgroup of the DiRECT cohort will 
be reported separately. 
Weight loss leads to a rapid and marked fall in blood pressure, with risk of postural hypotension if 
antihypertensive drugs are continued. The acute fall in blood pressure with a low energy formula 
diet is greater than anticipated from reduced salt intake alone.6  For that reason, all diuretic and 
antihypertensive medications were withdrawn at the start of the total diabetes replacement phase 
in participants in the intervention group, and only restarted if systolic blood pressure exceeded 140 
mm Hg. This approach resulted in 68% of the intervention group remaining off antihypertensive 
drugs at 12 months, with no increase in mean blood pressure. In terms of lipids, although only 
triglyceride concentrations declined, baseline cholesterol values were suppressed under guideline-
driven statin prescriptions. 
Quality of life improved significantly in the intervention group at 12 months, but was unchanged in 
the control group. The need to take antidiabetic medications was greatly decreased. The benefits to 
individuals32 and the improved physical and psychological wellbeing accompanying substantial 
weight loss have previously been documented.33   The present study was not designed or powered to 
evaluate effects on complications of diabetes.  However, the clear improvement in HbA1c values, 
which became non-diabetic in 46% of participants in the intervention group, if maintained, can 
reasonably be expected to reduce microvascular complications. In a post-hoc analysis of the Look 
AHEAD dataset, a 10% weight loss in the first year, similar to that in the DiRECT, was associated with 
 a 21% decrease in occurrence of cardiovascular outcomes over a median follow-up of 10·2 years.34  
Even if diabetes recurs, there might be a legacy effect of a period of good glucose control, as 
suggested in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study.35  Sudden restoration of normoglycaemia can 
precipitate worsening of diabetic retinopathy, although this outcome is rare when early or no 
retinopathy is present.35  Nonetheless, if retinopathy is present at baseline, rescreening at 6 months 
is indicated.35  It will be possible to determine the effects of DiRECT intervention by future analysis of 
the national retinopathy screening databases. 
DiRECT thus offers considerable novel and clinically tractable information. The strengths of the study 
include a well-defined evidence-based intervention and a robust cluster-randomised study design, 
managed by a well-established clinical trials unit. The sample size exceeded the need for statistical 
power, and the remission rate of 46% greatly exceeded the level of 22% considered clinically 
important. Hence, the results are robust for the patient group under study. The sample had 
characteristics very similar to the general population of people with type 2 diabetes, so the results 
are likely to be generalisable.17 
The study has some limitations. The racial and ethnic characteristics, while typical of the populations 
of Scotland and Tyneside, do not allow for unqualified extrapolation to other groups, such as south 
Asians, who tend to develop diabetes with less weight gain. There were limitations to the data that 
could be collected in the routine primary care setting; therefore, detailed body composition was not 
assessed. 
Because the unit of randomisation was the primary care centre, participants were aware of their 
planned allocation to the control or intervention group; however, negligible bias seemed to result 
from this design on the basis of baseline group characteristics. It is not possible to exclude some 
contamination of the control group, with deliberate weight loss as a result of media publicity about 
 the intervention during the study. Such contamination would have tended to attenuate the effects 
of the intervention. 
Antidiabetic medications were stopped in the intervention group, but not in the control group. 
Withdrawal of antidiabetic medications might have been possible in some participants in the control 
group, but the study design was a comparison of the entire programme with current standard of 
care, under current guidelines. The dropout rate of 25% in the intervention group was an indication 
of non-acceptability for this proportion, but should be considered in relation to the overall 
effectiveness of the programme for a much greater proportion. The study design stipulated data 
collection from the control group only at baseline and 12 months, so intercurrent adverse events 
could not be assessed. Subsequent analyses might be able to examine routinely collected primary 
care data from both groups, including all prescriptions. Here we present only the numbers of 
different drugs prescribed at baseline and 12 months, and not dosage changes. Further detailed 
analysis of medication and dosage changes could be possible. We did collect information about 
serious adverse events in both groups, retrospectively at the 12 month assessments, and recorded 
only two, in the same participant, that might have been related to the intervention. 
The data for physical activity should be viewed with caution because they were based on around half 
of all participants in each group for whom the data were complete. 
Four participants in the intervention group who had diabetes remission had received a short rescue 
plan in the total diet replacement phase because of weight regain within 60 days of their 12 month 
assessment. We cannot exclude a carryover acute effect of the rescue plans suppressing HbA1c in 
these participants, but believe any such effect would have been very small and unlikely to affect the 
study conclusions. Two of the 12 participants who received rescue plans within 60 days of their 12 
month assessment achieved more than 15 kg weight loss. 
 The conclusions reported here apply to people with type 2 diabetes diagnosed within the previous 6 
years, and existing evidence has shown that remission is less likely with longer durations of 
disease.6,8 
This large primary care-based trial shows that a professionally supported intensive weight 
management programme is attractive to many people early in the course of type 2 diabetes. The 
programme allowed almost half of participants to revert to a non-diabetic state, off antidiabetic 
drugs at 12 months, and 68% stopped antihypertensive medications with no rise in blood pressure. 
Follow-up of this cohort to establish longer term outcomes will continue to at least 4 years. 
Continued work on optimising the maintenance of weight loss would be useful; however, our results 
should pave the way for this type of intervention to be considered in the routine care of patients 
with type 2 diabetes who wish to attain diabetes remission.36
