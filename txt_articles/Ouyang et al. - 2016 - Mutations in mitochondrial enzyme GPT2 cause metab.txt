Mutations that cause neurological phenotypes are highly informative
with regard to mechanisms governing human brain function and disease.
We report autosomal recessive mutations in the enzyme glutamate
pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) in large kindreds initially ascertained for
intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). GPT2 [also known as
alanine transaminase 2 (ALT2)] is one of two related transaminases that
catalyze the reversible addition of an amino group from glutamate to
pyruvate, yielding alanine and α-ketoglutarate. In addition to IDD, all
affected individuals show postnatal microcephaly and ∼80% of those
followed over time show progressive motor symptoms, a spastic para-
plegia. Homozygous nonsense p.Arg404* and missense p.Pro272Leu mu-
tations are shown biochemically to be loss of function. The GPT2 gene
demonstrates increasing expression in brain in the early postnatal period,
and GPT2 protein localizes to mitochondria. Akin to the human pheno-
type, Gpt2-null mice exhibit reduced brain growth. Through metabolo-
mics and direct isotope tracing experiments, we find a number of
metabolic abnormalities associated with loss of Gpt2. These include de-
fects in amino acid metabolism such as low alanine levels and elevated
essential amino acids. Also, we find defects in anaplerosis, the metabolic
process involved in replenishing TCA cycle intermediates. Finally, mutant
brains demonstrate misregulated metabolites in pathways implicated in
neuroprotective mechanisms previously associated with neurodegenera-
tive disorders. Overall, our data reveal an important role for the GPT2
enzyme in mitochondrial metabolism with relevance to developmental
as well as potentially to neurodegenerative mechanisms.

ntellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) occur in 2%
of people worldwide and rank first in the United States as a
cause of lifelong disability (1). IDD can be accompanied by
various associated features, including motor disability. Heredi-
tary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a unique form of motor disability
that is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of
the lower extremities (2). In addition, postnatal microcephaly
may occur with IDD and complicated forms of HSP, and likely
reflects failures in processes driving postnatal brain growth such
as neuronal arborization, synaptogenesis, and gliogenesis (3).
In this study, we present the discovery of loss-of-function
mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme glutamate pyruvate
transaminase 2 (GPT2) in autosomal recessive IDD with postnatal
microcephaly and motor findings consistent with progressive spastic
Significance
We report autosomal recessive mutations in the enzyme glutamate
pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) in a neurological syndrome in-
volving intellectual disability, reduced brain growth, and pro-
gressive motor symptoms. We show that the mutations inactivate
the enzyme. GPT2 catalyzes the reversible addition of an amino
group from glutamate to pyruvate, yielding alanine and α-keto-
glutarate. The GPT2 gene demonstrates expression in brain post-
natally, and the protein localizes to mitochondria. As in humans,
Gpt2-null mice exhibit reduced brain growth. Furthermore, mutant
mouse brains show abnormal metabolite levels, including in path-
ways involving amino acid metabolism, the TCA cycle, and neuro-
protective mechanisms. Our study identifies GPT2 as an important
mitochondrial enzyme in disease that has general relevance to
developmental and potentially to neurodegenerative mechanisms.

 paraplegia. GPT2 [also known as alanine transaminase 2 (ALT2) or
alanine aminotransferase 2 (ALAT2)] is one of two related enzymes
that catalyze the reversible addition of an amino group from gluta-
mate to pyruvate, yielding alanine and α-ketoglutarate. GPT2 and
highly related GPT are among several transaminases that regulate
critical metabolic processes, including amino acid metabolism and
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Glutamate is also a substrate in
the synthesis of glutathione, an important antioxidant in cells (4). We
show that GPT2 is localized to mitochondria and is expressed at
increasing levels in brain during early postnatal development corre-
sponding to periods of circuit development.
Mitochondria play an essential role in neurons given the high
energy demands of these cells, and mitochondria are particularly
abundant at synapses, where they mediate synaptic growth, ener-
getics, signaling, and protection (5). Mitochondrial dysfunction is
involved in both human neurodevelopmental as well as neurode-
generative disease (6–8). The TCA cycle in mitochondria functions
in both energy production as well as in biosynthetic processes. TCA
cycle intermediates may be extracted for biosynthetic metabolism
through a process termed cataplerosis, and TCA intermediates are
replenished via anaplerosis (9).
In addition to identification of mutations in GPT2 in human
neurological disease, we have developed a mouse model of Gpt2
deficiency. Akin to the human phenotype, we see reduced brain
growth in this mouse model. Metabolomics studies in Gpt2-null
mouse brains reveal reduced TCA metabolites consistent with a
defect in anaplerosis. We also identify metabolomic signatures
reflecting abnormalities in amino acid metabolism, as well as in
neuroprotective mechanisms previously implicated in neurode-
generative disease. Overall, our data support an important role
for GPT2 in mitochondria-based metabolism and neurological
disease with both developmental and progressive features.

Clinical Analyses of Pedigrees with Intellectual Disability and Postnatal
Microcephaly. As a contribution to understanding the genetic un-
derpinnings of neurological disease, we have studied two large
consanguineous kindreds with a neurodevelopmental condition.
Affected members in families shown in Fig. 1A share a phenotype
that includes intellectual disability with postnatal microcephaly
and variable, progressive spasticity (see also ref. 10). In total, our
studies included 14 affected individuals. All affected individuals

Identification of GPT2 mutations in large kindreds with recent shared ancestry affected by IDD with postnatal microcephaly. (A) Pedigree 1 (MI1000) is from
Pakistan. Pedigree 2 (MC9400) is from the Sultanate of Oman. Filled symbols indicate affected individuals. Shaded symbol (MC9402) indicates a similarly affected
individual, who was found not to have a homozygous GPT2 mutation. We have described the clinical presentation of pedigree 2 (MC9400) in a prior publication (10).
(B) Genome-wide LOD scores for pedigree 1 show a region of linkage on chromosome 16q11.2, with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.13. Linkage analysis of
pedigree 2 was performed for each of the three branches. Branch 1 (red) did not show a region of statistically significant linkage given heterozygous individual
MC9402 with phenocopy, whereas both branch 2 (blue) and branch 3 (green) indicate linkage to chromosome 16q11.2 with LOD scores of 3.38 and 2.90, respectively.
Magnified LOD score graphs for chromosome 16q are shown on the Right. (C) Sanger sequencing of GPT2 confirmed the identified mutations in pedigree
1 (c.1210C>T, p.Arg404*) and pedigree 2 (c.815C>T, p.Pro272Leu). Positions of mutations are according to NM_133443.3 (cDNA) and NP_597700.1 (protein).

 were born after uneventful pregnancies without asphyxia. Head
circumference was normal at birth for all seven individuals for
whom data were available, but affected individuals subsequently
developed microcephaly postnatally, ranging from 2.8 to 6.8 SDs
below the mean (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1). The majority
(88%) of affected individuals were reported to be hypotonic during
infancy. All 9 cases with data available (of 14 total cases) were able
to walk by the age of 3 y. All had delayed speech and showed oral–
motor dysfunction. Five (36%) had a history of seizures, with three
(MC9426, MC9429, and MI1002) having been diagnosed with
various types of epilepsy syndromes, including one with Lennox–
Gastaut syndrome, and the other two individuals each reporting a
single seizure episode. Full detailed clinical descriptions are pro-
vided in SI Appendix, Table S1.
The majority (83%) of the affected individuals showed sub-
sequent difficulty in walking. Over time, motor examination was
remarkable for hypertonia and hyperreflexia. In most cases (77%),
lower extremities were more severely affected, thus presenting as
spastic diplegia or spastic paraplegia. In some individuals, hand
movements were clumsy, tremulous, and poorly coordinated.
Results from brain imaging studies [computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] were obtained for 10 indi-
viduals and showed no obvious structural malformation other than
microcephaly, except for 1 individual who had reduced white
matter volume and a thin corpus callosum (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
Identifying GPT2 Mutations by Linkage Mapping and Whole-Exome
Sequencing. Pedigrees 1 and 2 showed strong linkage to a locus
on chromosome 16q (Fig. 1B). In pedigree 1, genome-wide linkage
analysis of the larger branch (affected individuals: MI1001,
MI1002, MI1003, and MI1004) revealed a region of linkage on
chromosome 16q with a maximum logarithm of odds (LOD) score
of 3.13 (Fig. 1B). The region was delineated by SNP markers
rs198188 to rs12917822 (chr16: 24,136,201–55,165,407). In pedi-
gree 2, LOD scores were calculated for each of the three branches
of the family separately due to complexity of the pedigree.
Branches 2 and 3 showed evidence of linkage to the same region of
chromosome 16q. The regions were delineated by SNP markers
rs205162 to rs6498968 for branch 2 (chr16: 25,596,637–52,653,785)
and rs17720179 to rs1567522 for branch 3 (chr16: 27,188,853–
49,302,826), with maximum LOD scores of 3.38 and 2.91, re-
spectively (Fig. 1B). In branch 1, two of the affected individuals
(MC9401 and MC9403) showed linkage to this region.
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of all affected individuals in
pedigree 1 revealed a single shared homozygous, nonsense variant
(c.1210C>T, p.Arg404*) in the GPT2 gene (RefSeq NM_133443.3)
in the linkage interval. There were no other rare, loss-of-function
mutations shared by all affected members of the pedigree in the
interval or elsewhere in the genome. The homozygous GPT2 gene
variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with
the disease in pedigree 1 (Fig. 1C). All members unaffected
for microcephaly in the pedigree were heterozygous. The candi-
date variant was not present in the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Variant Server or in dbSNP. In
pedigree 2, using WES of three affected individuals (MC9401,
MC9428, and MC9432), we identified a homozygous missense
variant in the GPT2 gene (c.815C>T, p.Pro272Leu) as the only
shared candidate variant in the linkage interval (Fig. 1C). All af-
fected individuals were homozygous, and no unaffected individ-
uals were found to be homozygous. Individual MC9402, who
showed a microcephalic phenotype, was heterozygous, and thereby
likely represents a phenocopy. This p.Pro272Leu variant was not
found in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server or in dbSNP, and
was predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 (11), SIFT (12), and
Provean (13), suggesting its pathogenicity (SI Appendix, Table S2).
Since our discovery of the mutations above, a single homozygous
missense change in GPT2 (c.459C>G, p.Ser153Arg) was reported
in two siblings with a similar phenotype, including microcephaly
and developmental delay (14) (Fig. 1D).
Human Mutations in GPT2 Lead to Reduced Protein Levels and Enzyme
Activity. We studied the protein stability and enzymatic activity of
the identified human mutations, and our results are consistent
with a loss-of-function mechanism. We expressed each of the
three mutated transcripts in HeLa cells and studied protein levels
using Western blotting with an antibody raised to the full-length
GPT2 (Fig. 2A). We detected a control, full-length protein at the
predicted size of V5His-tagged GPT2 (62.8 kDa, arrow). For the
truncating mutation p.Arg404*, we detected a scant quantity of
the predicted truncated protein (44.4 kDa, arrowhead), consistent
with nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA and/or an unstable
protein. Less than 4% of control protein was detected (quantified
in Fig. 2B). The missense mutations p.Ser153Arg and p.Pro272Leu
were expressed at 37.6 ± 6.3% and 10 ± 2.2% of control levels,
respectively, reflecting protein instability (Fig. 2B). Structural pre-
dictions for the missense changes also suggest deleterious effects
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
To substantiate further the interpretation that these mutations
lead to loss of enzyme function, we tested the enzymatic activity of
mutant proteins directly. We expressed constructs for full-length
GPT2 protein, as well as for each of the three mutant alleles, in
HeLa cells. We subsequently made protein extract from cells and
tested GPT2 enzyme activity. In the cell lines expressing each of
the mutant alleles, including the missense mutations, enzyme ac-
tivity relative to control was substantially diminished (to background
levels) (Fig. 2C). Thus, the mutations in GPT2 are associated with
reductions or loss of protein as well as loss of enzyme activity. Even
in the case of the missense mutations, wherein there was a small
level of intact protein, the enzyme activity of protein with these
missense mutations was not detectable above background levels.
GPT2 Expression Increases in Postnatal Developing Brain. To evalu-
ate the role of GPT2 in developing brain, we first measured
protein and enzyme activity in developing mouse brains. In
normal mice, we found highest levels of Gpt2 protein in the early
postnatal period using Western blotting (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A).
Total Gpt enzyme activity was detectable at postnatal day 1 (P1),
yet enzyme activity was found to increase nearly 10-fold by P18
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3B), correlating with increases in Gpt2 pro-
tein levels. In published RNA-seq data from cell lineages puri-
fied from mouse brain, Gpt2 mRNA expression was threefold
higher than that for the related enzyme Gpt in neurons [8.9 vs.
3.0 fragments per kilobase of exons per million fragments mapped
(FPKM), respectively] (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C) (15). Gpt2 also has a

 high level of expression (far exceeding Gpt expression) in oligo-
dendrocyte precursor cells (137.7 vs. 4.8 FPKM, respectively) and
newly formed oligodendrocytes (48.7 vs. 2.6 FPKM, respectively)
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3D) (15).
In humans, through analyses of the Allen Institute’s Develop-
mental Transcriptome Dataset, we observed that GPT2 mRNA is
broadly expressed across all parts of the human brain throughout
development and into adulthood, with highest levels in the early
postnatal years (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). Interestingly, although
mRNA levels for GPT2 and for GPT are correlated, GPT2 mRNA
levels are generally >20-fold higher than GPT levels in human
brain (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B). Based on these data, peak levels of
GPT2 expression correlate with major periods of synaptogenesis
and myelination in both mouse and human developing postnatal
brain (16–19).
GPT2 Protein Is Localized to Mitochondria. GPT2 harbors a strong
mitochondrial-localization sequence, which is not present in
GPT (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). None of the missense mutations
appeared to interfere with the predicted mitochondrial locali-
zation using PSORT II predictions (20) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A).
Exogenously expressed GPT2 wild-type (WT) protein demon-
strated a very high degree of costaining with mitochondrial
markers, such as Mito-GFP (Fig. 3A, Top). By comparison, ex-
pression of the p.Arg404* mutant protein produced very little
protein (Fig. 3A, Bottom); however, the small amount of protein
that was discernible (by increasing the imaging parameters to
maximal sensitivity) localized to mitochondria (SI Appendix, Fig.
S5B). The exogenously expressed missense proteins, either the
p.Ser153Arg or p.Pro272Leu, both demonstrated higher levels
of protein than the truncating mutation but reduced levels of
staining relative to the control (Fig. 3B). This reduced amount of
staining did colocalize with the mitochondrial stains, yet we ex-
pect these enzymes to be inactive, as shown previously (Fig. 2C).
Next, we established two GPT2-mutant HEK293FT cell lines
using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix,
Table S3). We introduced homozygous nonsense mutations
(c.265G>T, p.Glu89*; and c.1210C>T, p.Arg404*), the latter of
which is the same variant as we identified in pedigree 1. We
confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (qRT-PCR)
that cells containing either of these two GPT2 mutations showed
significant decreases in GPT2 mRNA compared with WT cells
(Fig. 3D). Western blot analysis of fractionated lysates from WT
and mutant HEK293FT cells revealed that endogenous GPT2
localized to the mitochondrial fraction in WT cells and was absent
from the cytoplasmic fraction, whereas GPT2 was undetectable in
either fraction in mutant cells (Fig. 3E).
Gpt2-Null Mice Demonstrate Reduced Postnatal Brain Growth. We
generated mice with a germline disruption of the Gpt2 gene (SI
Appendix, Fig. S6) and observed decreases in postnatal brain
growth akin to the human phenotype. Homozygous mutant mice
were born in the expected Mendelian ratio (SI Appendix, Table
S4). Western blotting of brain lysates demonstrated that Gpt2
protein was abolished in the mutant mice (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C).
Also of note, postnatal brains of homozygous mutant mice at P18
showed significantly reduced total brain Gpt enzyme activity (SI
Appendix, Fig. S6D). Homozygous mutant brain size was generally
indistinguishable at birth, and, behaviorally, mutants were similar
to control littermates for the first 2 wk postnatally. However, at
approximately P18, homozygous mutant mice began to demon-
strate reduced motor activity. Subsequent to the emergence of
reduced motor behavior, homozygous mutant mice grew sickly and
died generally between P18 and P26 (SI Appendix, Table S4).
Given the expression of the β-galactosidase gene from the en-
dogenous Gpt2 promoter in the targeted allele, we were able to
study the distribution of Gpt2 expression in the heterozygous
mouse brain. We found that, in P78 heterozygous mice, Gpt2 ex-
pression was widely distributed throughout the brain (SI Appendix,
Fig. S7). Staining was particularly apparent in the prefrontal cortex,
striatum, hippocampus, and granular cell layer of the cerebellum.
We compared brain area between littermate homozygous mutant
(n = 12) and WT animals (n = 7) at P18–P22 (Fig. 4). Gpt2-null
brains showed a small but consistent and significant reduction in
cortical area relative to control (P < 0.03) (Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
analysis of areas and lengths of different brain regions showed a
consistent and significant decrease in brain size in Gpt2-null animals
compared with control animals (Fig. 4 C and D). For example,
comparison of combined areas of cortex (CX), midbrain (MB), and
cerebellum (CB) demonstrated a 13% decrease in area (P <
0.0015). We further observed that the number of SV2-positive
puncta representing synapses were significantly reduced (30% less
than WT, P = 0.005) at 10–14 d in vitro (Fig. 4 E and F). Based on
these findings, we conclude that GPT2 has an important role in
brain growth during postnatal development and potentially in
synapse development.
Amino Acid Metabolism Is Defective in Gpt2-Null Mouse Brains. To
identify metabolic defects in neural tissue in vivo, we investigated
Gpt2-null mouse brains for derangements in metabolite levels.
We analyzed 276 metabolites from P18 acute brain preparations
from Gpt2-null and WT mice using targeted mass spectrometry
(MS)-based metabolomics and metabolite set enrichment analysis
(MSEA) (Fig. 5A). The top three pathways identified were as
follows: protein biosynthesis [P value = 0.0000000644, false
discovery rate (FDR) = 0.00000515] (largely reflecting changes in
amino acid metabolism); citric acid cycle (P value = 0.00000733,

 FDR = 0.000293); and glutathione metabolism (P value =
0.0000142, FDR = 0.000379) (Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Table S5).
At the level of primary metabolites in the GPT reversible re-
action in Gpt2-null brains, alanine showed a strong decrease (fold
change = 0.885, FDR = 0.008) (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Table S6).
We corroborated these brain findings of alanine depletion by direct
measure of alanine secretion and by isotope tracing experiments in
Gpt2-null murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. 6). Gpt2-null
MEFs exhibited near-complete loss of alanine secretion into the
media (Fig. 6A). Gpt2 deletion also substantially reduced transfer
of 15N from [α-15N]glutamine to alanine (Fig. 6B), as would be
expected if Gpt2 rather than Gpt1 were the major isoform ex-
changing amino groups between glutamate and α-ketoglutarate.
When cultured in medium supplemented with uniformly labeled
[U-13C]glucose, the Gpt2-null MEFs also had reduced 13C labeling
in alanine, whereas lactate labeling was conserved (Fig. 6C, two left
panels). Therefore, taken together, metabolomic and direct isotope
tracing measures indicate that Gpt2 is the major Gpt isoform re-
sponsible for alanine production and secretion.
Although the alanine pool was depleted, several other amino acid
pools were substantially elevated in P18 brain, particularly essential
amino acids, including phenylalanine (fold change = 1.641, FDR =
0.024) (Fig. 5C and SI Appendix, Table S6). Notably urea was
substantially decreased (fold change = 0.246, FDR = 0.017), which
suggests a decrease in production of amine groups, consistent with
dysregulation of total cellular aminotransferase activity and/or ni-
trogen disposal perhaps due to decreases in alanine secretion.
Additional Abnormal Metabolomics Signatures in Gpt2-Null Mouse
Brains: Anaplerosis and Neuroprotective Mechanisms. In addition
to defects in amino acid metabolism, P18 Gpt2-null mouse brains
exhibit abnormal metabolomics signatures involving TCA cycle
and neuroprotective mechanisms (Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Table
S5). With regard to the TCA cycle, five of eight TCA cycle in-
termediates were substantially decreased (Fig. 5D and SI Appen-
dix, Table S6), including the following: citrate (fold change =
0.655, P = 0.015), isocitrate (fold change = 0.868, P = 0.0064),
succinate (fold change = 0.759, P = 0.009), fumarate (fold change =
0.881, P = 0.002), and malate (fold change = 0.735, P = 0.001).
Surprisingly, ATP and GTP levels were somewhat elevated, as
was acetyl-CoA.
Depletion of TCA cycle intermediates in brain is consistent with
a defect in anaplerosis, the metabolic process involved in replen-
ishing TCA cycle intermediates used during cellular anabolism and
biosynthesis. Because Gpt enzyme activity converts glutamate to
α-ketoglutarate, this function has been proposed to promote glu-
tamine-dependent anaplerosis (21). Overall, labeling of TCA cycle
intermediates from [U-13C]glucose was enhanced by Gpt2 deletion
(Fig. 6C). Altered label distributions included enhanced malate
m+3 and citrate m+5 fractions, which is consistent with suppressed
glutamine-dependent anaplerosis and increased carboxylation of
pyruvate (22). These altered labeling patterns are expected if re-
duced entry of glutamine-derived carbon into the TCA cycle via
α-ketoglutarate is offset by an increased contribution of 4-carbon
intermediates from glucose. Culture in [U-13C]glutamine con-
firmed a reduced contribution of glutamine-dependent anaplerosis
to TCA cycle intermediates in Gpt2-deficient cells (Fig. 6D).
Finally, we found in P18 Gpt2-null brains that several metabo-
lites related to neuroprotective mechanisms are misregulated (Fig.
5E): glutathione (fold change = 0.715, FDR = 0.038), folate (fold
change = 0.383, FDR = 0.024), and cysteine (fold change = 0.609,
FDR = 0.083) levels were reduced; whereas cystathionine levels
were substantially elevated (fold change = 2.409, FDR = 0.00036).
Elevations of cystathionine were also found in newborn P0 mouse
brain (fold change = 1.701, FDR = 0.029) (SI Appendix, Table S8).

or human GPT2 with the p.Arg404* mutation were immunostained with anti-GPT2 antibody (red). Under the same imaging parameters, p.Arg404* showed a

coexpressing Mito-GFP and C-terminal V5-tagged human GPT2 control (hGPT2-V5His) or mutations p.Ser153Arg or p.Pro272Leu were stained with anti-V5

from both fractions. Tubulin and MTCO2 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit II) are shown as a loading control marker and a mitochondrial marker, respectively.

 mutant animals compared with combined WT and heterozygous
littermates. Although Gpt2 protein expression undergoes substantial
up-regulation in the postnatal period (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A), we
reasoned that analysis at this early time point could pinpoint the
most proximal metabolic derangements resulting from loss of
Gpt2. At P0, only four metabolites demonstrated misregulated
levels adhering to a conservative FDR correction. Among these
were two metabolites observed also at the P18 time point: alanine
(fold change = 1.573, FDR = 0.000165), a primary metabolite
in the Gpt2 reaction, and also interestingly, cystathionine (fold
change = 1.701, FDR = 0.029). Of note, alanine was up-regulated at
P0, whereas by contrast it was significantly down-regulated at P18.
The other two misregulated metabolites that withstood FDR cor-
rection were hydroxyproline (fold change = 1.767, FDR = 0.000335)
and sarcosine (fold change = 1.337, FDR = 0.0153). Both of these
metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism. Overall, our data
support a role for Gpt2 in mitochondrial function and various
metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, anaplerotic
processes involved in TCA cycle intermediates, and pathways im-
plicated in neuroprotective mechanisms (e.g., pathways involving the
metabolites cysteine, cystathionine, glutathione, and folate).
Discussion
In this study, we report rare, homozygous mutations in the gene
encoding the enzyme GPT2 in large consanguineous pedigrees seg-
regating with a neurological phenotype involving IDD, postnatal mi-
crocephaly, and spastic paraplegia with progressive features. We
present one extended kindred with a LOD score greater than 3.1
(pedigree 1, MI1000) segregating a homozygous nonsense GPT2
mutation (p.Arg404*). Another large extended kindred of three
branches (pedigree 2, MC9400) segregates a deleterious, homozygous
missense GPT2 mutation (p.Pro272Leu) with LOD scores greater
than 3.3 and 2.9 in branches 2 and 3, respectively. An individual of
pedigree 2 (MC9402, branch 1), who similarly presented with micro-
cephaly and IDD, was not homozygous for the GPT2 variant. Because
this family is highly consanguineous, it is likely that this individual has
an additional genetic mutation. During the course of our work, a third
homozygous, deleterious missense GPT2 mutation (p.Ser153Arg) was
reported in a large pedigree with recent shared ancestry and three
affected individuals presenting with a similar phenotype (14).
In biochemical studies, we demonstrate that the human mutations
are loss of function. For the p.Arg404* mutant protein, we demon-
strate that the truncated GPT2 protein is not made or is unstable
in expression studies in cell lines. We also show here that the
p.Pro272Leu and p.Ser153Arg proteins are unstable and, through
structural predictions, likely have deleterious effects on protein
folding (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). All mutant GPT2 proteins, p.Arg404*,
p.Pro272Leu, and p.Ser153Arg, are enzymatically inactive, consistent
with loss-of-function, autosomal recessive mutations.
The clinical phenotype of the affected individuals associated
with GPT2 mutations presented herein is generally uniform.
Postnatal microcephaly and IDD were noted in all affected

 individuals, most had oral motor difficulties, and several had sei-
zures. These clinical findings are highly consistent with those of the
individuals reported in ref. 14. There is no clear difference in severity
between individuals with truncating mutations and missense muta-
tions, consistent with our biochemical data that all mutations lead to
a severe or complete loss of GPT2 enzyme function.
An important aspect of our work is that we have had the op-
portunity to follow patients longitudinally. Thereby, we are able to
extend the neurological phenotype, which appears to include
progressive features in addition to developmental disease. With
regard to motor findings, we find that hypotonia during infancy
gives way to hypertonia more notably in the lower extremities
(spastic diplegia or paraplegia). Among the 14 affected individuals
studied herein, ∼80% showed slowly progressive spastic diplegia
or paraplegia with hyperreflexia and hypertonia as one of the
major features. Although rapid regression is not noted, motor
difficulties seem to be slowly progressive in many of the cases,
consistent with our metabolomics studies that suggest abnormali-
ties in neuroprotective mechanisms. Defects in such mechanisms
have been previously implicated in hereditary spastic diplegia (23).
The acquisition of neurological features during early postnatal
life indicates the brain’s requirement for GPT2 during this crit-
ical period of brain development. Postnatal brain development is
characterized by the formation, refinement, and maintenance of
circuitry involving neuronal arborization, synaptogenesis, oligoden-
drocyte expansion, and myelination (3). We find GPT2 expression
to increase in brain during the early postnatal period and to be
expressed in both neurons and glia. Prior studies have indicated
strong neuronal expression and weaker or absent glial expression in
adult human brain (24); however, data presented here support a
role for GPT2 in both neurons and glia, at least during early post-
natal development (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Our finding that GPT2
expression reaches highest levels in the early postnatal period both
in human and in mouse brain, concurrent with peaks in synapto-
genesis (17, 18, 25), suggests a role in this process. We also observe
decreases in brain growth postnatally both in human and in mouse.
Our initial findings support defects in synapse formation (Fig. 4 E
and F), again consistent with failures in synaptogenesis perhaps
arising from mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, we demon-
strate here that GPT2 is localized to mitochondria. GPT2 has a
strong mitochondrial localization signal, whereas GPT does not.
The two isoforms of GPTs, GPT and GPT2, show different spatial
expression patterns. GPT2 is highly expressed in the CNS. There is
also a possibility that other defects in postnatal brain development
are involved, including abnormal oligodendrocyte development.
In humans, myelination increases rapidly between 6 and 24 mo

Metabolomics profile of postnatal Gpt2-null mouse brain. (A) Overrepresentation analysis of metabolomics in brains from Gpt2-null (MUT) compared with
WT Gpt2 mice at P18. The reference library contained 88 metabolite sets for normal metabolic pathways. Metabolites showing significant increases or decreases
(compared with control on Student’s t test P value less than 0.05) were flagged. The hypergeometric test was used to determine whether flagged metabolites from
specific pathways were significantly overrepresented. Red, FDR < 0.01; green, 0.01 < FDR < 0.03; blue, 0.03 < FDR < 0.05. (B–E) Box plots of metabolites, with
whiskers representing minimum and maximum values. The peak intensity areas were normalized by a pooled reference sample from the WT Gpt2 group (prob-
abilistic quotient normalization), and auto (unit) scaling was performed whereby the data were mean-centered and divided by the SD of each group. Unpaired
Student’s t test was performed assuming equal group variance. The box plots in each of the panels show the following: (B) metabolites from the primary
GPT enzyme reaction, (C) amino acids, (D) TCA cycle intermediates, and (E) metabolites involved in neuroprotective mechanisms. n = 6 WT animals and 6 MUT

 postnatally and may increase more gradually into adolescence (16,
26). A minority of patients have shown a reduced white matter
volume on brain MRI [participant MI1003; SI Appendix, Table S1;
and also an affected individual in the study by Celis et al. (14)].
Interestingly, in mouse, we observe strong Gpt2 expression in oli-
godendrocyte precursor cells that undergo rapid expansion in the
early postnatal period (19, 27–29).
It is appealing to speculate that disease progression in the post-
natal period may be prevented by intervention, particularly in the
setting of abnormalities of amino acid metabolism. GPTs serve an
important role in a variety of metabolic functions, including amino
acid metabolism, the urea cycle, and the TCA cycle, in addition to
roles in neurotransmitter (both glutamate and GABA) synthesis.
Glutamate, in turn, is also a substrate for the synthesis of glutathi-
one, a key element in the cellular machinery to protect against ox-
idative damage and cell death (30, 31). Depletion of alanine levels is
the strongest signal observed of the primary metabolites in the brain.
Similarly, in patient cerebrospinal fluid, decreases in alanine were
seen (14). Interestingly, we do not see strong changes in glutamate.
Elevations of glutamate at the synapse would be predicted to be
particularly excitotoxic (32); however, we do not see strong changes
in total brain glutamate in newborn mice or at P18. Future studies

Defective alanine production and glutamine-dependent anaplerosis in Gpt2-null cells. Immortalized MEF cell lines were prepared from WT and Gpt2-null
mice (MUT) and investigated in culture. (A) Total alanine abundance in the medium was measured by HPLC. Alanine secretion in the MUT cells was scarcely
detectable. (B) Graphed are fractional enrichments of extracellular alanine during culture with [α-15N]glutamine. Levels of transfer of radioisotope from gluta-
mine to alanine are substantially reduced in the Gpt2-null cells. (Schematic Right) 15N (green) is transferred from [α-15N]glutamine, via [α-15N]glutamate,
to [15N]alanine. This pathway requires activity of a glutamate pyruvate transaminase, such as Gpt2. (C) Shown are mass isotopologue distributions for alanine, lactate,
malate, and citrate after culture with [U-13C]glucose and unlabeled glutamine. Altered label distributions, including reduced alanine m+3, and enhanced malate m+3
and citrate m+5 fractions, are consistent with suppressed glutamine-dependent anaplerosis (22). (Schematic Right) [U-13C]Glucose gives rise to [U-13C]pyruvate
(pyruvate m+3) via the glycolytic pathway. This pyruvate can be converted to lactate m+3 or alanine m+3. Conversion of pyruvate to alanine involves the
Gpt1 (cytosol)- or Gpt2 (mitochondrion)-dependent transfer of an amino group to pyruvate from glutamate. A large reduction of labeling of alanine from glucose
in Gpt2-deficient cells implies that Gpt2 is required for alanine synthesis. (D) Shown are mass isotopologue distributions for malate and citrate after culture with
unlabeled glucose and [U-13C]glutamine. Reduced direct transfer of radioisotope from glutamine to malate and citrate demonstrates suppressed glutamine-
dependent anaplerosis in Gpt2-null cells. (Schematic Right) [U-13C]Glutamine generates fully labeled α-ketoglutarate via glutamate. The resulting α-ketoglutarate
can proceed around the oxidative TCA cycle as shown, giving rise to malate m+4 and citrate m+4. In addition, α-ketoglutarate may become reductively
carboxylated through the addition of one unlabeled carbon, resulting in citrate m+5 (49). Loss of Gpt2, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to
α-ketoglutarate, is predicted to reduce labeling of metabolites downstream of α-ketoglutarate during culture with [U-13C]glutamine. It would also in-
crease the contribution of glucose carbon to TCA cycle metabolites, as described in ref. 22. Data are presented as the means ± SDs for three parallel
cultures, with results shown for one representative experiment. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by unpaired, two-sample Student’s t test.

 may examine specific cell types or tissue compartments (i.e., the
synapse) more precisely for alterations in metabolites or damage.
Given the lack of spatial resolution, our current experiments make it
difficult to interpret a role for GPT2 in the glutamate–glutamine
cycle at the synapse. Indeed, the GPT enzyme has been used ex-
perimentally and in therapeutic models to reduce excitotoxic gluta-
mate levels through a proposed scavenging approach (33).
In the postnatal brain at P18, our experiments seem to indicate
that Gpt2 serves to provide a source of alanine in the brain. Also,
given the very low urea levels, Gpt2 activity may play an im-
portant role in nitrogen metabolism perhaps through generation
of alanine. At P18, by contrast to decreases in alanine, Gpt2-null
brains demonstrate elevations in several essential amino acids,
including elevations in phenylalanine, which have been impli-
cated in other encephalopathies, notably phenylketonuria, and
may be modifiable by diet. We also observed elevations in gly-
cine, which is also associated with progressive encephalopathy,
intellectual disability, and seizures (34).
We also observe metabolic defects indicating abnormalities
in glutamine-dependent anaplerosis of TCA cycle intermedi-
ates. GPT2 facilitates glutamine’s ability to serve as an anaplerotic
precursor by enabling the conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate
in the mitochondria. Our findings are similar to a previous study in
which GPT activity was observed to be required for glutamine to
stimulate both respiration and growth of KRAS-transformed cancer
cells in culture (35). The importance of the role of GPT2 and ana-
plerosis in neurons and glia warrants further investigation.
Importantly, a metabolic signature previously associated with
neurodegenerative disease was observed in Gpt2-null brain. Cys-
tathionine elevation is among the strongest signals in the metab-
olomics dataset with statistically significant elevations at both P0 and
P18. Recently, several studies have implicated the accumulation of
this product, as well as decreases in cysteine, which are also observed
in Gpt2-null brains, in neurodegenerative disease. More specifically,
through deficiency in cystathionine γ-lyase and mechanisms involving
both redox homeostasis and sulfhydration, this metabolic pathway
has been pinpointed in both Huntington’s disease (36, 37) and
Parkinson’s disease (38), as well as other neurological diseases with
mitochondrial defects. Other statistically significant perturbations
in P18 brain supporting abnormalities in neuroprotective mecha-
nisms include reductions in glutathione and folate. In summary, we
have identified mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme GPT2 in a
human neurological disorder, wherein mutations lead to metabolic
dysfunctions that have general relevance to developmental as well
as potentially to neurodegenerative mechanisms and disease.
Subjects and Methods
Human Studies. Human subject research was conducted according to proto-
cols approved by the institutional review boards of Boston Children’s Hos-
pital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Butler Hospital, and
equivalent committees of the other participating institutions. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians.
Genome-Wide SNP Genotyping, Linkage Analysis, and WES. DNA was geno-
typed using either Affymetrix Genome_Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (MI1000)
or Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip array (MC9400). Affymetrix ge-
notype calls were made using Birdsuite 1.5.5 (39) and Illumina calls by
GenomeStudios version 2011.1 (Illumina). Genome-wide LOD scores were
calculated using high-quality SNPs. PLINK, version 1.07 (40), was used to
reduce linkage disequilibrium between markers. MERLIN, version 1.1.2 (41),
was used to remove genotyping errors and to calculate LOD scores, assuming
an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance with 100% penetrance and a
disease allele prevalence of 0.0001. WES was performed using the Agilent
Sure-Select Human All Exon or All Exon, version 5, capture array. Samples
were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Sequence data were analyzed
using GATK and variants annotated using ANNOVAR (42).
DNA Constructs and Antibodies. Human GPT2 gene (GenBank: BC062555.1)
was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO mammalian expression vector to
generate C-terminal V5His-tagged phGPT2-V5His. GPT2 mutants p.Arg404*,
p.Ser153Arg, and p.Pro272Leu were constructed using QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies). The pTag GFP2-Mito vector was from Evr-
ogen. Antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti–C-terminal GPT2 antibody
(SAB140991; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti–full-length GPT2 antibody (16757-1-AP;
Proteintech), mouse anti-V5 antibody (R960-25; Life Technologies), mouse anti-
SV2 antibody (SV2-c; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), chicken anti-
MAP2 antibody (AB-15452; Millipore), mouse anti-Tubulin antibody (ab56676;
Abcam), and rabbit anti-MTCO2 antibody (ab109739; Abcam).
GPT Enzyme Activity Assay. GPT activity was analyzed using the alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) Assay Kit (Abcam). Mouse brains or cells were ho-
mogenized in ice-cold ALT Assay buffer and centrifuged. Protein concen-
trations of supernatants were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay. GPT
activity was detected using 30 μg of brain extracts or 3.5 μg of cell extracts.
Genome Editing of GPT2 in HEK293FT Cells. Genomic alterations in HEK293FT
cells at the GPT2 locus were made using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (43). Twenty
nucleotide guide RNA (gRNA) sequences were designed to target double-
stranded breaks at respective GPT2 target loci. For each transfection, a 180-nt
single-stranded oligonucleotide was cotransfected with gRNA and the CRISPR-
Cas9 construct [pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP; Addgene] to create single base substi-
tutions via nonhomologous recombination. At 48 h posttransfection, single
cells were sorted with GFP signal by FACS. The targeted genomic region was
sequenced (see SI Appendix, Table S3, for sequences used). GPT2 mRNA level
was quantified by qRT-PCR using primers (Hs0037287_m1; Life Technologies).
Generation of Gpt2-Null Mice. Gpt2 cryopreserved mutant embryos were
established through resources at the Knockout Mouse Project at University of
California, Davis (Project ID CSD24977). The background of the embryos is
C57BL/6N, and these mice were fully backcrossed into a C57BL/6J line. The
targeting construct involved a gene trap (splice acceptor) and LacZ-Neo
cassette (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). Heterozygous males and heterozygous fe-
males were mated to produce offspring of both genders and all genotypes.
Animals were genotyped by PCR with forward primer CSD-gene-F (5′-CTA
ACT TGT CCT GCA TGG TGT CAG C-3′) and reverse primer CSD-gene-ttR
(5′-CTA CAA ACA CTG GAC CCA AAC GTC C-3′) for a WT band of 504 bp.
Forward primer CSD-loxF (5′-GAG ATG GCG CAA CGC AAT TAA TG-3′) and
reverse primer CSD-gene-R (5′-GGC TTT CTA CCA GGA GGA ACA GAG G-3′)
yields a 283-bp mutant band (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B, Left). WT and mutant
mRNA were detected using RT-PCR, with the forward primer Unitrap-F
(5′-CTG AGG TAA TCC GAG CCA AC-3′) and reverse primer Unitrap-wtR (5′-CGC
TCG TTT CTT AGC GTC TT-3′) detecting a WT band (114 bp) and the Unitrap-F
primer and Unitrap-laczR primer (5′-TGG CGA AAG GGG GAT GTG-3′) detecting
a 300-bp mutant band (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B, Right). LacZ staining was per-
formed as described (44). All experiments involving mice were carried out in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (45) under the protocols approved by the Brown University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Brain Size Measurement. Matched littermate pairs collected between P18 and
P22 were transcardially perfused with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and
imaged using a Leica MZ16F. ImageJ analysis software was used to measure
the area of the cortical hemispheres, midbrain, and cerebellum. Length
measurements were done using four defined starting points.
Hippocampal Cultures. Hippocampal neurons were cultured as described (46).
At 10–14 d in vitro (DIV), cells were immunostained with anti-SV2 and anti-
MAP2 antibodies. MAP2-positive neurons were scored for SV2 puncta using
ImageJ Particle Analysis.
Metabolomics. Craniotomies were performed on P0 and P18 litters from Gpt2
heterozygous parents. Whole brains were used for metabolomics prepara-
tions performed as per Yuan et al. (47). Methanol extracts were dried and
run by targeted tandem liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS. Briefly, samples
were injected via hydrophilic interaction LC at high pH using HPLC coupled
to a 5500 QTRAP mass spectrometer (AB/SCIEX). Metabolites were monitored
using SRM mode for 300 transitions with positive/negative polarity switching.
Peak areas for each detected metabolite were integrated using MultiQuant
software (AB/SCIEX). The results were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (48).
Stable Isotope Tracing in MEFs. MEFs were maintained in DMEM with 10%
(vol/vol) FCS and immortalized by SV40 T antigen. Experiments were per-
formed between 5 and 15 passages. Stable isotope tracing experiments were
performed as described previously (22). Briefly, cultures were overlaid with
DMEM containing either 10 mM [U-13C]glucose and 4 mM unlabeled glutamine,

 or 10 mM unlabeled glucose and 4 mM [U-13C]glutamine. After culturing for
6–8 h, the cells were rinsed in ice-cold normal saline and lysed with three
freeze–thaw cycles in cold 50% (vol/vol) methanol. Lysates were centrifuged,
and supernatants were evaporated and derivatized by tert-butyldimethylsilyl-
methyltrifluoroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). One microliter of derivatized mate-
rial was injected onto an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph networked to an
Agilent 5975 mass selective detector. For analysis of 15N labeling in extracellular
alanine, MEFs were incubated with medium containing 10 mM unlabeled
glucose and 4 mM [α-15N]glutamine for 8 h. An aliquot of medium was passed
over an AG50 column (Bio-Rad), and then amino acids were eluted with 4 mL of 4
N ammonium hydroxide. These samples were evaporated and processed as above.
Total alanine abundance in medium was measured by HPLC (Hitachi L8900).
