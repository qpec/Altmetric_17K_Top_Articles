Abstract Exercise plays a central role in the manage-
ment and treatment of common metabolic diseases, but
modern society presents many barriers to exercise.
Over the past decade there has been considerable in-
terest surrounding high-intensity interval training
(HIIT), with advocates claiming it can induce health
benefits of similar, if not superior magnitude to
moderate-intensity continuous exercise, despite reduced
time commitment. As the safety of HIIT becomes clearer,
focus has shifted away from using HIIT in healthy individuals
towards using this form of training in clinical populations. The
continued growth of metabolic disease and reduced physical
activity presents a global health challenge and effective ther-
apies are urgently required. The aim of this review is to ex-
plore whether the acclaim surrounding HIIT is justified by
examining the effect of HIIT on glucose control, its ability to
affect cardiovascular function and the underlying mechanisms
of the changes observed in those with common metabolic
diseases. It also explores translation of the research into clin-
ical practice.

Why exercise?
Before the agricultural, industrial and digital ages, humans
expended large amounts of energy in activities centred on
maintaining shelter and procuring food and water [1]. Fast
forward some 350 generations and the barriers to exercise
and physical activity in the 21st century are enormous.
Sedentary behaviours, such as the use of mechanised transport
and screen-based leisure pursuits have become the norm in
modern society. There is an urgent need therefore to find prac-
tical, attractive and effective exercise therapies to combat the
wave of inactivity sweeping through the western world.
Not only is exercise part of our nature, it is strongly associ-
ated with reduced chronic disease risk. Globally, metabolic dis-
orders such as the metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes and the closely associated
cluster of cardiovascular diseases are rapidly increasing [2].
European and US treatment algorithms for these obesity driven
epidemics recommend weight loss and maintenance as a main
priority across all stages [3, 4]. Conceivably, this can be
achieved through energy restriction and/or physical exercise.

 Current management guidelines for these common meta-
bolic conditions advise individuals to undertake around
150 min of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise per week,
spread over most days of the week, in addition to resistance
training on at least 2 days of the week [5, 6]. The emphasis
remains on moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT);
however there is mounting evidence that high-intensity inter-
val training (HIIT) provides an alternative means of achieving
the same or greater health benefits vs MICT, provided there
are no medical contraindications to engaging in HIIT and that
it is well tolerated and preferred by the individual taking part.
We refer readers to recent meta-analyses for a comprehensive
analysis of the metabolic [7] and cardiorespiratory [8] benefits
of HIIT in patient groups. The aim of this review is to assim-
ilate existing evidence and provide a clinically relevant narra-
tive of the cardiometabolic benefits of HIIT in those with
common metabolic diseases, before moving onto discussing
its safety profile, tolerability and practical considerations for
translation into clinical care. The information presented in this
review is not part of a formal systematic review and, therefore,
may not have been subjected to the rigor required for such a
summary of the data currently available on HIIT.
What is HIIT?
HIIT can be described as ‘brief intervals of vigorous activity
interspersed with periods of low activity or rest’, which in-
duces a strong acute physiological response (Fig. 1) [9]. A
number of HIIT protocols have been adopted in the literature
(see Table 1), but the majority of interventions use high-
intensity intervals lasting between 1 and 4 min. The goal of
HIIT is to accumulate activity at an intensity that the partici-
pant would be unable to sustain for prolonged periods (i.e. 80–
95% of peak oxygen consumption (V
:O2peak ) or >90% of
maximum heart rate (HRmax), therefore the recovery time
should be sufficient to allow the subsequent interval to be
completed at the desired intensity. The total duration of a
HIIT session tends to be ≥20 min, which actually makes it
comparable with recommendations for MICT, in terms of du-
ration. There is also a sub-category of HIIT involving 10–30
second intervals and intensities often exceeding 100%
V
:O2peak, i.e. ‘all-out’ exercise at a workload that is above
maximal aerobic capacity [10]. This is often called sprint in-
terval training and has not been substantially tested in clinical
populations and will therefore not be covered further.
The vast majority of the published HIIT research, particu-
larly in clinical populations, has used exercise modalities
involving cycling, walking, and running, mostly carried out
on stationary cycles and treadmills (see Table 1). However,
other equipment, such as cross-trainers/ellipiticals [11], are
reasonable options for some. Evidently there is clear variation
throughout the literature and it still remains to be determined
whether an optimal HIIT protocol exists for metabolic disease
management.
HIIT and metabolic health
Skeletal muscle molecular adaptations
A number of molecular adaptations have been identified with-
in skeletal muscle following HIIT (Fig. 2). Skeletal muscle is
the primary site for glucose disposal via insulin- and non-
insulin-mediated glucose uptake; the latter stimulated by mus-
cular contraction. It therefore plays a large role in regulating
metabolism.
Increased GLUT-4 content GLUT-4 content in the vastus
lateralis increased by 369% following six sessions of HIIT
in type 2 diabetes patients [12]. Insulin resistance underlies
metabolic disease and although decreased GLUT-4 content is

 not the cause of insulin resistance, any increase in this protein
improves glucose transport within skeletal muscle [13].
Another study found that 16 weeks of HIIT in type 2 diabetes
patients induced higher membrane-bound GLUT-4 and
GLUT-4 mRNA levels in comparison with energy matched
MICT, but no rise in overall GLUT-4 protein content was
observed [14]. The reduced intensity of intervals in this study
(70% V
:
O2peak) compared with other HIIT protocols is worth
noting, however, as is the fact that biopsies were obtained
5–6 days post-training.
Mitochondrial adaptations Reduced mitochondrial content
[15], mitochondrial function [16] and markers of mitochon-
drial biogenesis in skeletal muscle are commonly observed in
individuals with metabolic disease [17] and have been sug-
gested to contribute to insulin resistance. In adults with type 2
diabetes, 2 weeks of HIIT (90% HRmax) significantly
increased mitochondrial capacity evidenced by an increase
in citrate synthase activity and raised content of electron trans-
port chain complexes [12]. In contrast, 16 weeks of interval
walking (70% V
:O2peak) only elicited changes in citrate syn-
thase mRNA expression but not in citrate synthase activity.
However, as stated above, this could be due to the lower
intensity of intervals used in this study compared with tradi-
tionally adopted HIIT protocols and because muscle biopsies
were obtained 5–6 days post-training [14].
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, gamma, coactiva-
tor 1, alpha (PGC-1α) regulates muscle mitochondrial
biogenesis [18]. Following HIIT, increases in nuclear PGC-1α
levels have been observed [19], as well as increases in total
PGC-1α vastus lateralis content in biopsy samples. Similar
changes were not observed following energy matched MICT
[20]. It has been proposed that the fluctuations in ATP turnover
during interval training, which differs from the usual steady state
conditions of ATP production, could activate signalling path-
ways that lead to this increase in PGC-1α following HIIT [21].
Sarcoplasmic reticulum Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+
handling plays an important role in muscle fatigue and
increased Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum has
been demonstrated following HIIT, but not MICT in adults
with the metabolic syndrome [20]. Increases as large as
50–60% were observed in Ca2+ reuptake, significantly im-
proving the work capacity of the muscle and thereby contrib-
uting to improvements in fitness following HIIT. This study
indicates that HIIT provides a more potent stimulus compared
with MICT to induce skeletal muscle adaptations. However,
definite conclusions cannot be drawn from one small study,
with a total sample size of 32 participants.
HIIT and glucose control
Key studies on the impact of HIIT on glucose control have
been summarised in Table 1. These adopt a range of protocols
and cover both the acute and training responses to HIIT.

 The acute response Few studies have assessed the acute
response to HIIT in patients with metabolic disorders and
those that have are summarised in Table 1. Relative to no ex-
ercise, a single session of HIIT reduces same-day postprandial
area under the glucose curve in those with impaired fasting
glucose [22] or type 2 diabetes [23, 24]. Similarly, HIIT is
associated with reduced time of glucose being ≥10 mmol/L
[23, 24]. However, studies assessing the effect of HIITon mean
24 h glucose levels have been less consistent, with some indi-
cating no effect [22, 23, 25], and one showing a reduction but
only when the exercise was performed in a fasted state [24].
When compared with energy matched MICT, HIIT tended to be
slightly superior [22, 25, 26] (see Table 1). As measurements
were not reported much past 24 hours post exercise, the dura-
tion of these effects is uncertain. Earlier work relying on chang-
es in fasting glucose to assess impact, suggests a measurable
effect may last as long as 72 h post HIIT, but for a shorter period
following MICT [26].
Since postprandial glucose excursions are strong predictors
of cardiovascular disease [27], which may be due to possible
inductions of oxidative stress and micro/macrovascular dam-
age [28], the above findings are of clinical relevance.
Unfortunately, the available research does not provide clarity
on dose–response in terms of intensity, duration or total ener-
gy expenditure. Further head-to-head comparisons of different
protocols are required. However, it is worth noting that a pro-
tocol of 1 min intervals with 1 min recovery, repeated ten
times (a modest time investment), improves acute glucose
control [22, 23].
The transient nature of changes in glucose metabolism in
response to exercise is well documented. Insulin-independent
glucose disposal is increased during and for approximately
60 min post exercise [29]. Insulin-dependent glucose disposal
increases for several hours to a few days following exercise
[29, 30]. These effects are localised to contracting muscle
[29], thus exercise involving a larger muscle mass is prefera-
ble. Higher-intensity exercise has been shown to recruit a
larger proportion of muscle fibres compared with moderate-
intensity exercise [31], which may explain greater improve-
ments in glucose regulation following HIIT. In light of these
acute adaptations, patients should be recommend not to
have more than two exercise-free days, in accordance with
guidelines [32].
The training response Of the studies assessing the effects of
longer-term HIIT (≥2 weeks), some report reduced fasting
glucose [11, 20, 26, 33, 34], while others report no change
[35–39] (Table 1). Where reductions in fasting glucose are
observed, they appear to be similar to those seen following
MICT [7]. Fasting glucose is predominantly a marker of
hepatic insulin sensitivity. After just 1 week of a diet very
low in energy (very low calorie diet; 2510 kJ/day [600 kcal/
day]), liver fat content decreased by 30%, hepatic insulin
sensitivity significantly improved and fasting glucose fell by
35% in adults with type 2 diabetes [40]. The reduction in fasting
glucose following participation in HIIT is generally smaller [11,
20, 26, 34, 41], (≤14%, see Table 1), suggesting that exercise
(whether HIIT or MICT), lacks potency for improving hepatic
insulin sensitivity, when compared with consumption of a very
low calorie diet. This is most likely because exercise elicits a
smaller energy deficit than that achieved with a modest change
in eating behaviour. For example, to achieve an energy deficit
similar to that achieved by reducing energy intake by the equiv-
alent of the energy in a blueberry muffin (∼1891 kJ [452 kcal]),
a 68 kg female would need to run approximately 38 min at a
pace of 9.7 km/h [42]. We did, however, show that HIIT was
able to significantly reduce liver fat and, thereby, fasting glu-
cose in some type 2 diabetes individuals [38], but the average
reduction in liver fat did not result in a significant reduction in
fasting glucose levels. Whether an increase in the duration of
the HIIT intervention (i.e. >12 weeks) would achieve a reduc-
tion in fasting glucose levels in this cohort is yet to be
determined.
HIIT has been shown to improve peripheral insulin sensitiv-
ity in those with impaired metabolic control. The molecular
adaptations to HIIT described above, including raised GLUT-4
content, increased aerobic enzyme capacity and mitochondrial
biogenesis, have all been associated with improved peripheral
insulin sensitivity [13, 43]. Studies assessing the metabolic im-
pact of HIIT in those with common metabolic diseases have
found no change in HOMA-IR [37–39, 44, 45], whereas others
have shown an approximate 20% improvement compared with
a control group [20, 33, 34, 41] (Table 1). When compared with
MICT, HIIT seems to have a small but significant benefit on
insulin resistance [7].
HIIT can also decrease HbA1c [34, 38, 41, 44], yet
some studies have reported no change [11, 36, 39, 46]
(Table 1). Although there have been a number of studies pub-
lished since, a meta-analysis found that a 0.47% absolute re-
duction in HbA1c is observed with HIIT in adults with com-
mon metabolic diseases, compared with controls [7]. This is
slightly lower than the 0.6% absolute HbA1c reduction
observed following aerobic and resistance exercise in type 2
diabetes [47]. Both HIIT and other forms of exercise compare
well with improvements achieved through metformin [48] and
are likely to have clinical benefits, since a 1% absolute rise in
HbA1c leads to a 21% increased risk of diabetes related death,
a 14% increased risk of myocardial infarction and a 37% in-
creased risk of myocardial infarction [47].
Other indicators of glucose control, such as 2 h glucose
following an oral glucose challenge and glucose AUC are
similarly inconsistent across studies (see Table 1). Several
explanations for the reported inconsistencies across studies
include differences in study populations, exercise protocols
and the degree of volunteer supervision during exercise.
However, the most plausible explanation is the variation in
Diabetologia (2017) 60:7–23
15
 time of post-intervention measures relative to the last bout of
exercise. Studies reporting both the acute and cumulative
effect of HIIT have consistently shown that changes in indi-
cators of glucose control last between 24 and 72 h post exer-
cise [25, 26, 33, 36] (Table 1). Only one study has demon-
strated a longer-term adaptation, in which fasting insulin was
reduced 96–120 h post exercise [36]. Greater inter-study con-
sistency in the timing of post exercise assessments is warrant-
ed in the future; continuous glucose monitoring for at least
72 h post exercise and HbA1c assessments may also allow
us to gauge benefit better.
Collectively, the improvements in glucose control follow-
ing HIIT are clinically relevant but do not surpass those seen
following the traditionally used MICT with regards to fasting
glucose, HbA1c and fasting insulin [7]. HIIT does seem to lead
to greater improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity [7],
but overall the use of HIIT for improving glycaemic outcomes
should not be over-emphasised compared with other forms of
exercise training.
HIIT and cardiovascular health
Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of mortal-
ity in those with common metabolic diseases [49, 50]. The
interval design of HIIT to include rest periods enables patients
to accumulate time at higher exercise intensities, thereby chal-
lenging the cardiovascular system. Limited evidence indicates
that HIIT provides a stronger stimulus than MICT for eliciting
myocardial improvements. Alongside the beneficial impact of
HIIT on vascular and cardiorespiratory fitness, this suggests
that the cardiovascular benefit of HIIToutweighs the metabol-
ic benefit.
Cardiac adaptations: molecular mechanisms
Because of the difficulty of obtaining human myocardial tissue,
most evidence for the molecular adaptations to high-intensity
exercise comes from experimental rodent models, the hearts of
which bear similarities to human hearts and mimic the human
cardiac response to exercise training [51, 52]. The db/db
mouse model provides a good representation of the human
heart in diabetic patients. Following 13 weeks of HIIT, contrac-
tility and Ca2+ handling were restored to normal levels as a
result of raised transverse tubule (T-tubule) density, sarcoplas-
mic reticulum synchrony of Ca2+ release and sarcoplasmic re-
ticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a; Ca2+ transporter) activity
[53]. These adaptations occurred despite no improvement in
glucose or insulin levels, demonstrating the direct impact of
HIIT upon the myocardium. Similar adaptations have been ob-
served in heart failure and healthy rodent models [54, 55], with
greater changes occurring following high-intensity exercise
(85–90% maximal oxygen consumption [V
:O2max]) compared
with moderate-intensity exercise (65–70% V
:
O2max) [55].
Exercise also activates the phosphoinositol-3 kinase/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction
pathway that leads to higher ribosomal biogenesis and protein
synthesis, and thus induces physiological hypertrophy to
a greater extent following high- (85–90% V
:
O2max) vs
moderate- (65–70% V
:O2max) intensity exercise [52, 55]. The
exercise-induced pathways activated in disease models may
differ [54], but both healthy and disease rodent models
indicate that exercise stimulates important transcription-
al, translational and post-translational regulatory mecha-
nisms that lead to structural remodelling of cardiac tis-
sue and, thereby, improved strength of cardiac contrac-
tions [52].
Cardiac structure
Adults with common metabolic diseases display left ventric-
ular concentric remodelling, which represents a reduction in
end-diastolic volume (EDV) and is also known as pathologi-
cal hypertrophy [56, 57]. This reduction in EDV occurs in
response to stress signals and is reflective of a build-up of
collagen in the myocardium [58]. HIIT, on the other hand,
has been shown to induce physiological hypertrophy [38],
increasing left ventricular wall mass and EDV by means of a
physiological response to growth signals [58]. The number of
studies investigating cardiac structure following HIIT is small;
our group showed an 8 ml increase in EDV following
12 weeks of HIIT in type 2 diabetes patients [38], but no
improvements in NAFLD patients [39]. Both of these studies
compared HIITwith a non-exercise control, rather than MICT.
That being said, HIIT has been shown to be superior to energy
matched MICT in eliciting structural remodelling in those
with hypertension [59] and heart failure [60].
Cardiac function
Systolic function Stroke volume and ejection fraction, two
measures of the contractile capabilities of the heart, are
reduced in those with metabolic disease [57]. Twelve weeks
of HIIT induces systolic improvements in adults with type 2
diabetes [38, 44], hypertension [59] and heart failure [60].
Following 12 weeks of HIIT in heart failure patients, Wisløff
et al [60] demonstrated a 35% and 17% relative increase in
ejection fraction and stroke volume, respectively, but no
change in these variables following energy matched MICT.
These improvements are equal to those seen with commonly
used prescription medications, such as ACE inhibitors or beta
blockers [61]. Twelve weeks of HIIT in hypertensive patients
improved early events in systole, which correlate to contrac-
tility and are load independent [59]. Furthermore, 12 weeks of
16
Diabetologia (2017) 60:7–23
 HIIT in heart failure patients led to a 22% increase in global
contractility [60]. These improvements were not observed
following energy matched MICT [60].
Cardiac torsion describes the twisting motion of the heart
during contraction and reflects the dominance of epicardial
fibres over endocardial fibres. In adults with metabolic dis-
ease cardiac torsion is raised [62], reflecting damage to
endocardial fibres. Interestingly, we observed reductions
in cardiac torsion in adults with type 2 diabetes and
NAFLD who partook in 12 weeks of HIIT, when compared
with controls [38, 39], suggesting a reduction in endocar-
dial damage following HIIT.
Diastolic function Diastolic dysfunction is often reported
in those with common metabolic diseases [57, 63].
Impaired early filling of the left ventricle is indicative of
stiffer, damaged myocardial fibres that are less compliant
during relaxation; yet evidence suggests that HIIT has the
capacity to target these abnormalities. Two studies have
demonstrated significant improvements in early filling
rates following 12 weeks of HIIT in adults with type 2
diabetes [38, 44], which were sustained 1 year later [44].
Similar diastolic improvements were also observed in
adults with NAFLD [39]. These HIIT-induced elevations
in early filling rate have been demonstrated to be as large
as 49%. In contrast, 12 weeks of MICT fails to have any
impact upon diastolic variables [44, 59, 60]. These data
suggest that exercise intensity is an important characteris-
tic for inducing diastolic improvements. Diastolic dys-
function is an independent predictor of mortality [64],
therefore any improvements in function are likely to be
clinically significant.
Vascular function
Endothelial dysfunction is associated with metabolic dis-
ease [65] and considered one of the earliest pathophysio-
logical processes in the progression to atherosclerosis.
Flow mediated dilation (FMD) is a measure of endothelial
dysfunction and is regulated by NO availability. In those
with common metabolic disease, HIIT has been shown to
be superior [44] or similar [35] to MICT for improving
FMD. Although not limited to common metabolic dis-
eases, a meta-analysis of 182 participants demonstrated
twice the improvement in FMD following HIIT, compared
with MICT [66]. This is most likely due to the greater
shear stress experienced during higher-intensity exercise,
since shear stress is the main stimuli for increasing NO
availability in the endothelium [59]. Consequently, im-
proved FMD results in greater perfusion and oxygen sup-
ply to peripheral tissue.
Findings with respect to the effect of HIIT on blood
pressure in individuals with common metabolic diseases
have been inconsistent; some studies demonstrate im-
provements [11, 20, 35, 45], whereas some show no
change [36, 38, 39, 44] in blood pressure, despite pos-
itive cardiac remodelling [38]. Exercise guidelines for
the treatment of hypertension advise low- to moderate-
intensity exercise [67], but these findings suggest further
work is required to better define the role of HIIT in
hypertension therapy.
Skeletal muscle and cardiac adaptations combine to
improve V
:
O2peak following HIIT
It could be argued that the most important outcome fol-
lowing HIIT is cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by
V
:
O2peak. Large prospective studies have demonstrated fit-
ness to be more important than established risk factors for
mortality [68], and low V
:
O2peak is independently associat-
ed with incident type 2 diabetes [69]. While the exercise-
induced increase in V
:O2peak has never been directly linked
to mortality, large scale studies indicate that improvements
in fitness over time leads to significant reductions in mor-
tality risk [70, 71].
V
:
O2peak is the gold standard measure of fitness and a strong
indicator of how well the cardiac, pulmonary, vascular
and peripheral systems are working together. A number
of meta-analyses have demonstrated the substantial bene-
fits of HIIT for V
:
O2peak and its superiority in comparison
to MICT in healthy [72], coronary artery disease [73] and
cardiometabolic disease patients [8]. In those with elevat-
ed cardiometabolic risk, the increase in V
:
O2peak with HIIT
(19.4%) was almost twice that of MICT (10.3%) [8]. On
average, V
:
O2peak increases by 5.4 ml kg−1 min−1 follow-
ing HIIT, and even a smaller improvement of
3.5 ml kg−1 min−1 has been predicted to improve survival
by 10–25% [74].
Figure 2 provides an overview of the skeletal muscle
and cardiac adaptations that are likely to contribute to the
improvements in V
:O2peak observed with HIIT. As dem-
onstrated in the figure, HIIT improves the capacity of
both aspects of the oxygen supply and demand chain,
but it is the cardiovascular adaptations in response to
HIIT that are more likely to contribute to these V
:

improvements [75].
HIIT and weight loss
HIIT induces moderate weight loss (0.5–4 kg reduction)
in adults with common metabolic diseases [11, 20, 34,
36, 41, 46]. When compared with MICT, however, HIIT
Diabetologia (2017) 60:7–23
17
 provides no additional benefit as an exercise therapy for
weight loss [7]. The ability of HIIT to induce reductions
in body weight should therefore not be overstated in
those with common metabolic diseases.
Although weight loss is strongly associated with re-
duced metabolic complications [76], it does not reflect
changes in body composition; HIIT generally reduces
whole body fat mass by 1–3 kg, even when body weight
remains stable [14, 35, 36, 41, 46, 77, 78]. Significant
reductions in visceral and hepatic fat have also been
shown with HIIT [14, 38, 39]. These findings are impor-
tant since these fat depots increase cardiovascular disease
risk [79], and metabolic dysfunction [40, 80]. Three pos-
sible mechanisms for HIIT-induced fat loss have been
suggested:
1.
increased mitochondrial density and capacity fol-
lowing HIIT leading to increased fat oxidation
[81]
2.
large elevations in catecholamines, which have been
shown to drive lipolysis [82], especially in the ab-
dominal tissue where there are significantly more β-
adrenergic receptors, compared with subcutaneous
fat [83]
3.
appetite suppression: energy intake the day after HIITwas
∼1255 kJ (300 kcal) lower than after MICT, and ∼2510 kJ
(600 kcal) lower than after rest [84]
It remains unclear whether HIIT is superior to MICT
for fat loss, with some studies supporting this notion [14,
36, 46] and some not [34, 35, 41, 45, 78]. To date, evi-
dence to support HIIT over other types of exercise for the
management of body fat levels is unfounded, but there is
enough proof to suggest that HIIT can induce positive
changes in body composition in adults with common met-
abolic diseases.
A summary of the effects of HIIT can be found in the text
box ‘Summary of HIIT’.
Is HIIT safe?
Given the strong cardiovascular-focused physiological re-
sponse to HIIT, it is appropriate to define the safety of
high-intensity activity in those at elevated cardiometabolic
risk. The acute cardiac response to HIIT has been
assessed in a few studies. In patients with coronary heart
disease, no contraindications to HIIT were observed and
undesirable changes, such as ST-segment depression, re-
covered during interval recovery periods [85, 86]. Also, in
patients with chronic heart failure, cardiac stress (as
assessed by rate pressure product) stayed within accept-
able values [87]. Furthermore, the studies mentioned
above did not report any serious adverse events with
HIIT.
The largest available dataset assessing the safety of
HIIT was derived from a clinical audit of 4846 cardiac
rehabilitation patients. It identified two non-fatal cardiac
arrests in 46,364 h of supervised HIIT, and one fatal
cardiac arrest in 129,456 h of supervised MICT [88].
Although the low frequency of events makes the com-
parison between the two exercise modalities inconclu-
sive, it also highlights that the risk of either approach
is low. It is important to note that all patients were
referred to cardiac rehabilitation by their general practi-
tioner or hospital cardiologist and underwent a full med-
ical screening and cardiopulmonary exercise test prior to
taking part, to rule out recurrent ischaemia or chest pain
during exercise.
The risk of sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial
infarction is increased following vigorous activity in suscep-
tible individuals, including those with structural heart disease
and congenital complications [89]. The American College of
Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association provide
guidelines for identifying high risk patients and carrying out
pre-exercise screening in such individuals [6, 89]. According
to these guidelines those with common metabolic diseases are
automatically considered ‘high risk’. On the whole, however,

 mounting clinical evidence supports HIITas a safe therapy for
the majority of individuals with elevated cardiometabolic risk.
Tolerability of HIIT in patients
The trials published to date illustrate the tolerability of
HIIT among diverse clinical populations and with varying
study durations (see Table 1). Although large-scale trials
are lacking, attempts have been made to assess the palat-
ability of HIIT in previously sedentary populations. A
group of obese women, some with type 2 diabetes, were
noted to prefer a HIIT approach to MICT [90], as did
volunteers with coronary heart disease [85]. Within HIIT
protocols, enjoyment decreases with increasing interval
length [91]. Specifically, intervals of 30 or 60 s resulted
in greater enjoyment than 120 s intervals.
Good adherence to free-living, non-supervised HIIT
(<3 months) has been demonstrated in those with type 2 dia-
betes [38], NAFLD [39] and those with either impaired glu-
cose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose [92]. Good adher-
ence was also observed with interval walking (3 min alterna-
tive fast and slow walking) in a free-living environment over
4 months in patients with type 2 diabetes [36] and over
22 months in older adults [93]. Additional longer-term studies
are required but, nonetheless, these results indicate good ad-
herence and tolerability to independent HIIT exercise.
Considerations when prescribing HIIT
Beyond the plethora of specific protocols to choose from,
the way in which HIIT protocols are often described is, in
itself, a barrier to clinical implementation. The text box,
‘Recommendations for HIIT prescription’ provides a sum-
mary of our recommendations for prescribing HIIT in a
clinical setting.
In research, HIIT is most commonly carried out as
three sessions per week (Table 1). Such a frequency is
consistent with the probable duration of the metabolic
effects observed. As previously mentioned, the duration
of intervals also varies from 1–4 min (see Table 1).
Since longer intervals have not been conclusively shown
to yield better clinical outcomes but have been shown to
reduce enjoyment [91], it makes sense to start at the
shorter end of the range. The accumulated time at high-
intensity during HIIT has varied from 10–20 min; starting
at the lower end of this range allows for greater progres-
sion. Likewise, ratios of interval:recovery time also vary,
with a 1:1 ratio offering a simple starting point. Last,
keeping the intensity of the recovery period to a minimum
is likely to increase enjoyment, at least initially.
Intensity is commonly measured using HRmax. At first
glance, heart rate appears like a feasible option given the rel-
ative ubiquity of heart rate monitors. However, heart rate rises
across intervals, as shown in Fig. 1. In our research, we have
adopted a very practical approach, using the Rate of Perceived
Exertion (RPE) 6–20 Borg scale as a guide of intensity; as
previously reported, participants were asked to work at a
16–17 on the scale (or ‘very hard’) during each interval
(Fig. 1) [38, 39]. RPE is an accurate predictor of exercise
intensity in diabetes patients [94], however, like heart rate, it
does have its limitations. Agreement between RPE and more
objective measures of intensity is known to suffer both inter-
and intra-individual variation. For example, when RPE
was assessed during a set workload protocol, RPE in-
creased from the first to the last interval [12]. Thus, using
RPE trades some objectivity, but the benefit is a great deal
of practicality.
Exercise selection is ultimately limited by what is available
to the patient. Since peripheral metabolic adaptions are limited
to the muscles undergoing forceful contractions during exer-
cise [29], it is preferable to choose activities involving a large
muscle mass.
Recommendations for HIIT prescription
Frequency: 3 HIIT sessions per week
Intensity: Most easily measured by rating of perceived exertion (although 
may be variable in practice)
Time: Intervals should last between 1 and 4 minutes, with intervals at the 
shorter end being preferred by patients. The total time spent doing intervals 
should be 10–20 minutes per session
Type: Activities involving a large muscle mass

 What’s next for HIIT?
HIIT leads to modest improvements in metabolic control and
weight loss. This is in contrast to calorie restriction, which
leads to significant weight loss and improvements in metabol-
ic control [40]. Combining HIITwith calorie restriction would
accrue the cardiac benefits of HIITand the weight loss benefits
of calorie restriction. Additionally, exercise and calorie restric-
tion together have been shown to improve glucose regulation
by two-fold compared with the same amount of weight loss
induced by exercise or calorie restriction alone [95]. Thus,
there may be additive benefits for metabolic control if HIIT
was used adjunct with energy restriction.
The myriad of different HIIT protocols adopted in the lit-
erature needs to be addressed. A standardised and consistent
approach for prescribing HIIT protocols is missing, making it
difficult to detect dose–response effects and the thresholds
necessary to elicit desired changes. Most clinical HIIT studies
have been short term (<4 months, see Table 1) and performed
in a laboratory setting. The feasibility, acceptability and effi-
cacy of longer-term HIIT in a real world setting requires in-
vestigation before it can be accepted as an alternative therapy
for those with elevated cardiometabolic risk.
Conclusion
In circumstances where HIIT is not feasible, considered poten-
tially unsafe or not well tolerated by an individual , MICT is
effective at eliciting important health benefits. However,
throughout this review we have shown that, provided unstable
cardiovascular disease is excluded, HIIT appears to have a good
safety profile and is well tolerated. Compared with other forms
of exercise training, the use of HIIT for improving metabolic
control and inducing weight loss should not be overstated.
However, there are strong positive cardiovascular adaptations
to HIIT that confer benefit to a population at risk of cardiac
complications and therein lies the importance of HIIT for meta-
bolic disease management. For optimal clinical benefit (im-
proved glycaemic control and cardiovascular function), the value
of HIIT appears likely to be adjunct to energy restriction,
allowing HIIT to certainly make a hit.
