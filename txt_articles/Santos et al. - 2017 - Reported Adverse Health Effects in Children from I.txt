Hand sanitizers are effective and inexpensive products that 
can reduce microorganisms on the skin, but ingestion or 
improper use can be associated with health risks. Many hand 
sanitizers contain up to 60%–95% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol 
by volume, and are often combined with scents that might be 
appealing to young children. Recent reports have identified 
serious consequences, including apnea, acidosis, and coma in 
young children who swallowed alcohol-based (alcohol) hand 
sanitizer (1–3). Poison control centers collect data on inten-
tional and unintentional exposures to hand sanitizer solutions 
resulting from various routes of exposure, including ingestion, 
inhalation, and dermal and ocular exposures. To characterize 
exposures of children aged ≤12 years to alcohol hand sanitiz-
ers, CDC analyzed data reported to the National Poison Data 
System (NPDS).* The major route of exposure to both alcohol 
and nonalcohol-based (nonalcohol) hand sanitizers was inges-
tion. The majority of intentional exposures to alcohol hand 
sanitizers occurred in children aged 6–12 years. Alcohol hand 
sanitizer exposures were associated with worse outcomes than 
were nonalcohol hand sanitizer exposures. Caregivers and 
health care providers should be aware of the potential dangers 
associated with hand sanitizer ingestion. Children using alcohol 
hand sanitizers should be supervised and these products should 
be kept out of reach from children when not in use.
In 2005, the annual rate of intentional alcohol hand sanitizer 
exposure was 0.68 per 1 million U.S. residents (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] = 0.17–1.20) (4). During 2005–2009, 
this rate increased, on average, by 0.32 per 1 million per year 
(95% CI = 0.11–0.53; p = 0.02) (4). Young children, including 
infants, are more likely to develop complications from alcohol 
intoxication than are older children and teens. Younger children 
have decreased liver glycogen stores, which increase their risk 
of developing hypoglycemia, and have various pharmokinetic 
factors, which make them more susceptible to developing 
toxicity from alcohol (5–9). To characterize pediatric alcohol 
hand sanitizer exposures in the United States, data reported 
by poison centers in all states to NPDS among children aged 
≤12 years during January 1, 2011–December 31, 2014 were 
analyzed. Analyses were stratified by age group (0–5 years and 
6–12 years). Hand sanitizer exposures were defined as a poison 
center call reporting an exposure to either ethanol-based or 
isopropanol-based sanitizer solutions (alcohol hand sanitizer 
exposure) or a nonalcohol sanitizer product (nonalcohol hand 
sanitizer exposure). Calls reporting co-exposures to other agents 
were excluded to minimize confounding effects.
Descriptive statistics were compiled for exposed children’s 
age, year and season of exposure, intentionality of exposure, 
route of exposure (ingestion, inhalation, dermal, or ocular), 
reported health effects (e.g., drowsiness, eye irritation, nausea, 
vomiting, etc.), and outcome,† and were compared for alcohol 
and nonalcohol hand sanitizers and age group. An exposure was 
coded by poison centers as unintentional if it was considered 
to be accidental or inadvertent. Deliberate exposures, because 
of deliberate misuse or abuse for example, were considered 
intentional. An exposure was considered to have resulted in an 
adverse health effect if at least one symptom (e.g., abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, etc.) was reported. Categorical data 
comparisons were performed using the chi-square test or, when 
cell sizes were <5, Fisher’s exact test. Significance was defined 
as p<0.05. Statistical software was used for the analysis.
During 2011–2014, a total of 70,669 hand sanitizer expo-
sures in children aged ≤12 years were reported to NPDS, 
including 65,293 (92%) alcohol exposures, and 5,376 (8%) 
nonalcohol exposures (Table 1). The number and percentage 
of each type of reported exposure was similar during each of 
the 4 years. Overall, 64,488 (91%) exposures occurred in 
children aged ≤5 years, and 6,181 (9%) occurred in children 
aged 6–12 years. There was no association between sanitizer 
type and year. Among all children, ingestion accounted for 
approximately 95% of reported exposures, including 97% of 
exposures among children aged ≤5 years (97.0% alcohol and 
96.3% nonalcohol exposures) and 74% among children aged 
6–12 years (74.0% alcohol and 72.0% nonalcohol exposures). 
A higher percentage of older children (aged 6–12 years) had 
intentional exposures to alcohol hand sanitizers (866; 15.0%) 
than to nonalcohol hand sanitizers (40; 8.0%) (p<0.001). This

† Minor outcomes were defined as the occurrence of some symptoms as a result 
of the exposure, which were minimally bothersome to the patient, usually 
resolved rapidly, and often involved skin or mucous membrane manifestations, 
and after which, the patient returned to a preexposure state of well-being with 
no residual disability or disfigurement. Moderate outcomes were defined as the 
occurrence of symptoms as a result of the exposure that were more pronounced, 
more prolonged, or of a more systemic nature than minor symptoms; for which 
some form of treatment usually was or would have been indicated; were not 
life-threatening; and after which, the patient returned to a preexposure state of 
well-being with no residual disability or disfigurement. Major outcomes were 
defined as the occurrence of symptoms as a result of the exposure that were 
life-threatening or resulted in significant residual disability or disfigurement.

association was not found in younger children (aged ≤5 years). 
Ocular exposures to hand sanitizers were more common in 
older children (24.8% overall, 24.4% alcohol, and 29.0% 
nonalcohol) than among younger children (3.0% overall, 
3.0% alcohol, and 3.2% nonalcohol). Although there was no 
seasonal variation in reported exposure to either hand sanitizer 
type among younger children, exposure frequency among older 
children was lower for both hand sanitizer types during the 
summer months (Figure).
Overall, 8,219 (12%) patients had at least one reported 
symptom, including 7,703 (12%) children who ingested 
alcohol products, and 516 (10%) who ingested nonalco-
hol products. Adverse health effects were more likely to be 
reported for alcohol hand sanitizer exposures (p<0.001). The 
most common adverse health effects for both hand sanitizer 
types were ocular irritation (2,577; 31.4%) and vomiting 
(1,872; 22.8%). Conjunctivitis (862; 10.5%), oral irrita-
tion (782; 9.5%), cough (705; 8.6%), and abdominal pain 
(323; 3.9%) were also reported (Table 2). Rare health effects 
included coma (five), seizures (three), hypoglycemia (two), 
metabolic acidosis (two), and respiratory depression (two). 
Those rare effects occurred more frequently among children 
with alcohol hand sanitizer exposures, but the differences 
were not statistically significant when the rare health effects 
were analyzed individually. Alcohol hand sanitizers were 
significantly associated with worse outcomes (compared with 
no effect outcomes) when both age groups were analyzed 
(p = 0.02). Approximately two thirds (66%) of children with 
exposures were not followed to determine outcome (Table 2). 
Among patients who were followed (23,828), exposure to 
alcohol hand sanitizers had no reported effect in 17,441 
(85%) of the younger children. In contrast, 1,005 (50%) 
of the older children had no reported effect to alcohol hand 
sanitizer exposure. No deaths were reported.
Discussion
In this analysis, alcohol hand sanitizer exposures, the majority 
of which were ingestions, were associated with worse outcomes 
than nonalcohol hand sanitizer exposures. Older children (aged 
6–12 years) were more likely to report intentional ingestion 
and to have adverse health effects and worse outcomes than 
were younger children, suggesting that older children might 
be deliberately misusing or abusing alcohol hand sanitizers. 
These data also indicate that, among older children, exposures 
occur less frequently during the summer months. The reason 
for this seasonal trend is unknown but might be associated 
with flu season or more ready access to hand sanitizers during 
the school year. Some schools might require or ask children to 
purchase and carry hand sanitizers, which might contribute to 
the higher number of exposures during the school year. A study 
examining Texas poison center data from 2000 to 2013 found 
that, among 385 adolescents who ingested hand sanitizer, 35% 
of ingestions occurred at school (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions, which might have led to an underestimate of the total 
number of alcohol and nonalcohol hand sanitizer exposures. 
First, calls involving hand sanitizer exposures and another 
exposure were excluded. Second, the codes indicating an 
alcohol hand sanitizer exposure also were changed in 2010 and 
might have been initially underused. Finally, public and health 
care providers, including emergency department providers, 
also might not have reported all alcohol or nonalcohol hand 
sanitizer exposures to poison centers. Moreover, poison center 
data are also subject to inherent biases such as selection bias 
(e.g., if poisoning is unrecognized as a cause) or information 
bias (e.g., recall or interviewer bias). An important example of 
information bias in this study could be exposure intentionality 
being incorrectly coded because of inaccurate or subjective 
history obtained by the caller.  
Hand washing with soap and water is the recommended 
method of hand hygiene in non–health care settings. If soap 
and water are not available, use of a hand sanitizer that contains

at least 60% alcohol is suggested.§ Other options, such as 
nonalcohol hand sanitizers or wipes, can be used if soap and 
water or alcohol hand sanitizers are not available or practical. 
In September 2016, the Food and Drug Administration issued 
a rule banning the use of triclosan, triclocarban, and 17 other 
chemicals in consumer hand and body antibacterial soaps and 
washes because of health and bacterial resistance concerns. 
However, this ban does not apply to hand sanitizers, hand 
wipes, or antibacterial soaps used in a health care setting.¶ 
Hand washing with plain soap and water is safe and effective 
and does not carry these associated risks.
Increasing awareness of the potential dangers associated 
with intentional or unintentional ingestion of alcohol hand 
sanitizers might help encourage proper use and avoid adverse 
outcomes. Using alcohol hand sanitizers correctly, under adult 
supervision, and with proper child safety precautions and mak-
ing sure they are stored out of reach of young children might 
reduce unintended adverse consequences. Clinicians evaluating 
pediatric patients with clinical signs and symptoms consistent 
with alcohol toxicity, such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory 
depression, and drowsiness or laboratory results consistent with 
ethanol or isopropanol toxicity, should consider the possibility 
of an alcohol hand sanitizer ingestion and contact their local 
poison control center.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Nonrecommended use of alcohol-based (alcohol) hand sanitizers, 
including intentional or unintentional ingestion, might be 
associated with greater health risks in young children than similar 
use of nonalcohol-based (nonalcohol) hand sanitizers.
What is added by this report?
During 2011–2014, 70,669 exposures to alcohol and nonalcohol 
hand sanitizers were reported in children aged ≤12 years to the 
National Poison Data System. Approximately 90% of these 
exposures occurred among children aged 0–5 years. Among 
that age group, 97% of exposures were oral ingestions. Children 
aged 6–12 years had more intentional exposures of alcohol 
hand sanitizers, suggesting this might be a potential product of 
abuse among older children. Older children also reported more 
symptoms and had worse outcomes than did younger children. 
Major (life-threatening) outcomes were rare. Seasonal trends in 
data might correlate with increased use during the school year 
or flu season.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Caregivers and health care providers need to be aware of the 
potential risks and dangers associated with improper use of 
hand sanitizer products among children and the need to use 
proper safety precautions to protect children. Increased 
parental or teacher supervision might be needed while using 
alcohol hand sanitizer products, especially for older children 
who might be abusing these products during the school year.
