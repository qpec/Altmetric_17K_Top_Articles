Abstract
Introduction—The Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation 
Screening Outcome Evaluation examined whether universal suicide risk screening is feasible and 
effective at improving suicide risk detection in the emergency department (ED).
Methods—A three-phase interrupted time series design was used: Treatment as Usual (Phase 1), 
Universal Screening (Phase 2), and Universal Screening + Intervention (Phase 3). Eight EDs from 
seven states participated from 2009 through 2014. Data collection spanned peak hours and 7 days 
of the week. Chart reviews established if screening for intentional self-harm ideation/behavior 
(screening) was documented in the medical record and whether the individual endorsed intentional 
self-harm ideation/behavior (detection). Patient interviews determined if the documented

 intentional self-harm was suicidal. In Phase 2, universal suicide risk screening was implemented 
during routine care. In Phase 3, improvements were made to increase screening rates and fidelity. 
Chi-square tests and generalized estimating equations were calculated. Data were analyzed in 
2014.
Results—Across the three phases (N=236,791 ED visit records), documented screenings rose 
from 26% (Phase 1) to 84% (Phase 3) (χ2 [2, n=236,789]=71,000, p<0.001). Detection rose from 
2.9% to 5.7% (χ2 [2, n=236,789]=902, p<0.001). The majority of detected intentional self-harm 
was confirmed as recent suicidal ideation or behavior by patient interview.
Conclusions—Universal suicide risk screening in the ED was feasible and led to a nearly 
twofold increase in risk detection. If these findings remain true when scaled, the public health 
impact could be tremendous, because identification of risk is the first and necessary step for 
preventing suicide.
Introduction
The suicide rate in the U.S. has risen almost 30% over the past 20 years.1 As discussed in a 
special issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine,2 healthcare settings play a 
crucial role in identifying individuals who are at risk for suicide. Emergency departments 
(EDs) may be particularly important for such efforts.3–9 Many ED patients have 
unrecognized risk incidental to their chief complaint.10–12 In the two largest studies to date, 
point prevalence of active ideation among ED patients presenting with non-psychiatric 
complaints was 8%,13,14 which went undetected by treating ED clinicians. This far exceeds 
community estimates of around 3% over a period of an entire year.15 Many individuals who 
are treated in an ED and then die by suicide do not present for a psychiatric problem and 
their risk is not detected during the visit.16,17
The ED Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (ED-SAFE18,19) is a multicenter 
collaborative study with two overarching objectives:
1.
to develop and test a standardized approach to universal suicide risk screening 
within the general medical ED (the Screening Outcome Evaluation); and
2.
to test an ED-initiated intervention with follow-up telephone contact to reduce 
suicidal behavior among people who screen positive for suicide risk (the 
Intervention Evaluation).
The current paper reports key findings from the Screening Outcome Evaluation.
Methods
A detailed review of the study’s design and methods has been published.18 ED-SAFE used 
an interrupted time series design with three phases:
1.
Treatment as Usual;
2.
Universal Screening; and
3.
Universal Screening + Intervention.

 Eight participating sites were randomly assigned to one of four cohorts, and each cohort was 
randomly assigned to a start date and progressed through the three phases sequentially 
(random stepped wedge design).20 The Screening Outcome Evaluation used data from all 
three phases. The study was approved by the IRBs of all participating institutions. Because 
primary data were collected by chart review, the requirement for informed consent was 
waived. Patients who were approached for additional questioning provided verbal informed 
consent to be interviewed. All adult ED patients who were treated in one of the eight 
participating sites during any of the three study phases were eligible for chart review.
Setting
Eight hospitals located in seven states participated. Annual ED census ranged from 31,000 
to 54,000. Like most U.S. EDs, participating sites did not have dedicated psychiatric EDs,21 
to increase the representativeness of the findings.
At baseline, sites generally screened for suicide risk only among those who presented with 
frank psychiatric symptoms. One site had already implemented universal screening during 
Phase 1 using a single item screener created by the site. This implementation occurred after 
the site had been selected for participation (at the time of selection, it did not have universal 
screening) but before Phase 1 had started and was attributed to the hospital’s risk 
management concerns about complying with Joint Commission requirements.
Implementing Universal Screening
The investigative team and representatives from all eight sites used the best evidence 
available to create a screener feasible to implement in emergency settings. The Patient 
Safety Screener-3 (PSS-322) assesses depressed mood, active suicidal ideation in the past 2 
weeks, and lifetime suicide attempt. If lifetime attempt is endorsed, the timing of the most 
recent attempt is identified. A positive screen was defined as active suicidal ideation in the 
past 2 weeks or a suicide attempt within the past 6 months. The depression item is not 
factored into screening results; it was included as segue to help “ease into” the suicide items, 
which can be jarring when asked without context. A positive screen on the PSS-3 has strong 
agreement (κ=0.95) with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation,23 a well-established suicide 
risk instrument.22
Prior to Phase 2, each site convened a performance improvement team to develop strategies 
the site could use to improve implementation of universal screening. The team composition 
and performance improvement methods followed those commonly used by the Institute for 
Healthcare Improvement,24 an industry leader. The team was multidisciplinary, including 
practicing clinicians to administrators, and focused on using continuous quality 
improvement cycles. The Plan–Do–Check–Act (PDCA) strategy was used, which included 
planning the desired changes (Plan), implementing them (Do), measuring performance 
(Check), and making adjustments (Act). The PDCA process was repeated as often as 
needed. Each site’s team received centralized training on these methods and their 
relationship to suicide risk screening to assure a common knowledge base. Although the 
precise clinical protocols were not dictated, there were two requirements:
1.
The site needed to use the PSS-3.

 2.
The PSS-3 was to be administered universally for all patients, with notation if the 
individual was inappropriate to screen because of his or her medical condition (e.g., 
unconscious, cognitively disabled).
Screening during triage for patients who presented with a psychiatric complaint was 
maintained. However, screening during triage for individuals with non-psychiatric 
complaints was strongly discouraged because of concerns about slowing ED flow. For most 
sites, the PSS-3 was administered during the primary nursing assessment once the patient 
was placed in a treatment area. Some sites chose to use the PSS-3 during triage for 
psychiatric patients as well. Each site’s performance improvement team created written 
clinical protocols, which stipulated how positive screens would be managed.
Nurses at each site were either trained by trainers recruited from the site’s clinical staff or 
through a webinar provided by the ED-SAFE trainer. Each site’s performance improvement 
team was responsible for collecting its own data on performance independent of the research 
data (e.g., screening rates), making adjustments to protocols as needed, and providing 
feedback, additional training, and other small incentives (e.g., $5 gift cards and lunches) to 
promote performance. An a priori “Excellence” screening rate of 75% was set by consensus.
During Phase 3, sites continued to improve screening using PDCA cycles. See Methods 
paper(pp 15–16) for additional information on the additional interventions introduced during 
Phase 3.
Data Collection
Across all phases, sites staffed the ED with research assistants (RAs) at least 40 hours/week 
during peak volume hours (12:00PM to 10:00PM), with at least 1 weekend day/month. As both 
volume and enrollment rates decline after 10:00PM, this efficiently maximized the 
representativeness of the sample. All adult patients who entered the ED during data 
collection shifts were documented on a Screening Log, and the RA reviewed their medical 
charts in real time throughout the visit until the patient was discharged. This was done both 
to obtain screening data (goal of the present study) and to identify subjects for the 
longitudinal clinical trial. Although the RAs were not blinded to phase, additional data 
sources were used to expand and validate outcomes abstracted by chart review, including 
patient interview and random chart review. Information on the fidelity interviews used to 
validate medical record documentation is reported in Appendix A. Data were collected from 
2009 through 2014 and analyzed in 2014.
Outcome Definitions
The study was directed at improving suicide risk screening and detection. There were two 
primary outcomes. The first outcome, documentation of intentional self-harm ideation or 
behavior screening, was defined broadly as any documentation of past or current intentional 
selfharm ideation or behavior appearing in the record as either present or absent. The second 
outcome, intentional self-harm risk detection, was defined as past or current intentional self-
harm ideation or behavior documented as positive in the ED medical record. A broad initial 
threshold comprising any intentional self-harm ideation or behavior was used because ED 
documentation may be vague or incomplete as to whether intentional self-harm is suicidal or

 not, particularly during treatment as usual, and could introduce error and unreliability across 
raters (Limitations section). Consequently, the protocol tracked documentation of any 
intentional self-harm ideation or behavior, not just suicidal self-harm ideation or behavior, 
and clarified the nature of the selfharm using a subsequent direct research interview with the 
patient. Passive ideation only, such as a desire to go to sleep and not wake up, was not 
considered a positive screen.
Measures
The Screening Log extracted data from the medical record. The RA recorded demographic 
information, whether any screening for intentional self-harm ideation or behavior was 
documented anywhere on the patient’s ED medical record, and whether self-harm ideation 
or behavior was documented as present (positive screen) or absent (negative screen). A 
positive screen was further classified by the RA using chart documentation only as current 
(i.e., self-harm ideation or behavior occurring during or immediately preceding the current 
ED visit), past (i.e., noted in the past but not currently), or unknown time (i.e., documented 
without a clear time reference).
In addition, through all three phases, an RA approached all individuals with documentation 
reflecting intentional self-harm ideation or behavior and directly interviewed the patient. 
Patients who were incarcerated or too medically, cognitively, or emotionally ill to be 
interviewed were excluded. Intentional self-harm ideation or behavior was further clarified 
as suicidal ideation or behavior within the past week, including the day of the visit (yes/no).
Because RAs did not staff the ED 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, a separate sample of 2,400 
randomly selected charts was collected (100/site × 8 sites × 3 phases) as a validation sample. 
The RA recorded whether there was documentation in the chart of:
1.
any intentional self-harm ideation or behavior screening;
2.
any intentional self-harm ideation or behavior detection;
3.
suicidal ideation (past or current); and
4.
suicide attempts (past or current).
More information on these procedures is published.25
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed using Stata, version 13.1. Data are presented as proportions with 
95% CIs and medians with interquartile ranges. Changes in documentation of screening and 
detection were evaluated by analyzing data from the Screening Log using chi-square tests. 
Analyses were repeated using random chart review data as a confirmation of trends. To 
examine trends across the three study phases and control for potential clustering by site, 
generalized estimating equations with a logit link function were used. All p-values are two-
tailed, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Time series figures displaying 
screening and detection rates were generated from Screening Log data.

 Results
Across the three phases, RAs reviewed 236,791 ED visit records (Figure 1, Table 1), 
identified 10,625 patients with any intentional self-harm ideation or behavior, and completed 
3,101 patient interviews. The demographics were compared to the National Hospital 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey,26 which samples ED visits nationally. The ED-SAFE 
sample was very similar to the national sample.
Documentation of screening for any intentional self-harm ideation or behavior improved 
from 26% in Phase 1 to 73% and 84% in Phases 2 and 3, respectively, χ2 [2, 
n=236,789]=71,000, p<0.001, p for trend adjusted for site clustering <0.001). Similar 
increases were noted using random chart review data (24%, 72%, and 84% in Phases 1, 2, 
and 3, respectively [χ2 (2, n=2,398)=679, p<0.001, p for trend adjusted for site clustering 
<0.001]). The rate of screening across phases for each site can be seen in Figure 2. The 
Phase 3 screening rates by site ranged from 63% to 98%, with seven sites reaching >75%.
Detection of any intentional self-harm ideation or behavior rose from 2.9% in Phase 1 to 
5.2% and 5.7% in Phases 2 and 3, respectively (χ2 [2, n=236,789]=902, p<0.001), with the 
largest increase occurring between Phases 1 and 2 (p with adjustment for site 
clustering=0.008) (Table 2). Documentation of intentional self-harm ideation or behavior in 
the week prior to the visit rose from 2.7% to 3.9% (χ2 [2, n=236,789]=205, p<0.001), while 
past intentional self-harm ideation or behavior at any time other than the past week rose 
from 0.3% to 1.9% (χ2 [2, n=236,789]=1,200, p<0.001). Analyses with random chart review 
data revealed similar increases (2.8%, 5.8%, and 7.3% in Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively, χ2 
[2, n=2,398]=17, p<0.001). Appendix Figure B1 depicts the risk detection rates across all 
three phases over time. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for patient 
clustering by site and demographics did not materially affect the results (Appendix Table 
B1).
Direct patient interview data (n=3,101) found that, across all three phases, approximately 
74% (95% CI=73%, 76%) of patients with any intentional self-harm reported suicidal 
ideation or an attempt within the past week, supporting that the majority of the self-harm 
detection was relatively recent suicidal ideation or behavior.
Discussion
Although research has repeatedly suggested that ED patients have significant undetected 
suicide risk, this is the first study to address the key question of whether detection feasibly 
can be increased by implementing universal suicide risk screening protocols in the ED. Two 
main conclusions can be reached. First, increasing documented suicide risk screening rates 
in the general adult ED population during routine care was achieved using a simple screener 
and Institute for Healthcare Improvement performance improvement protocols. Second, 
increased screening led to nearly twice as many patients being identified as having suicide 
risk, either by virtue of endorsing active suicidal ideation or a past suicide attempt. If applied 
to the approximately 350,000 ED visits that occur annually at the eight participating EDs

 alone, nearly 10,000 additional patients with previously undetected suicide risk would be 
identified every year.
Documented screenings rose from an average of 26% in Phase 1 to an average of 84% in 
Phase 3, representing an increase of more than 300% (Figure 1). Moreover, this increase in 
screening led to a nearly twofold increase in identification of patients positive for suicide 
risk. Documentation of any past or current intentional self-harm ideation or behavior nearly 
doubled over the course of the study from 2.9% to 5.7%. Patient interviews confirmed that 
the majority of this intentional self-harm was suicidal ideation or behavior that occurred in 
the weeks before the ED visit. Findings using data obtained during active research shifts, 
which disproportionately captured hours from 9AM to 10PM, were reinforced by findings from 
random chart reviews. Furthermore, the positive trends in screening and detection persisted 
even after adjusting for factors such as site, demographics, and fidelity (Appendix A).
Importantly, steps were taken to foster successful screening adoption of the screening. A 
simple screening instrument and clinical protocols designed to be easily integrated into the 
ED routine were developed. Training was brief and available through multiple channels, 
including in-person by a site trainer or online. Sites used widely available performance 
improvement methodologies, including PDCA cycles, for integrating the protocols into 
routine care and monitoring performance.
Limitations
There are several potential limitations with this study. The participating EDs, though quite 
diverse, may not represent the nation’s EDs. Further study will be needed to examine 
whether these protocols, and their subsequent increase in risk detection, can be successfully 
translated to other EDs.
The RAs were not blinded to study phase. The most important bias this could have caused 
was to artificially inflate the improvements in suicide risk screening and detection. 
However, the authors reduced the potential for this bias in several ways. First, RAs were 
trained on research protocols, which were highly structured, designed to minimize the role 
of RA interpretations, and closely monitored using both site-specific and centralized quality 
assurance procedures. Second, RAs were not involved in any of the intervention training or 
activities. Finally, RAs interviewed all patients who screened positive on the chart to 
validate the documentation with the patient. If the RAs had been influenced by their 
knowledge of phase and artificially inflated the documentation of positive screenings, there 
would have been more patients identified as a positive screen on the chart but who denied 
any intentional self-harm. This rarely happened (less than 1% of the time across the study).
The study did not randomize individuals or sites due to study design, ethical, and legal 
considerations (described in Methods paper18). The quasi-experimental design could have 
introduced a change in clinician behavior simply as a result of being observed (Hawthorne 
Effect). There was no way to eliminate or measure this, but research protocols were 
designed to be unobtrusive. The random chart reviews captured data from all days and times 
to provide an indicator of performance less likely to be influenced by RA presence. Finally, 
the time series plots show a trend of performance improving over time, which is the opposite

 of tapering trends usually observed with a Hawthorne Effect as clinicians acclimate to being 
observed.
The RAs were trained to first identify any documentation of intentional self-harm, whether it 
was specifically noted as suicidal or not, and to interview these patients to ascertain whether 
the self-harm was suicidal. This was done because clinical documentation may be 
inadequate to determine intent. Relying on RAs to ascertain if the self-harm noted was 
suicidal based solely on documentation might have excluded valid cases. This would have 
been especially true during treatment as usual prior to the systematic changes in protocols 
that trained clinicians to document suicidal ideation and behavior more precisely using the 
PSS-3. The most likely impact of including only charts with clear documentation of suicidal 
self-harm would be to artificially inflate the screening rates for Phases 2 and 3 relative to 
Phase 1. Clinicians simply could have become more specific in their self-harm 
documentation as a result of training and improved templates, rather than increasing 
screening. Consequently, the inclusion criterion was broad, followed by direct interview to 
ascertain whether the intentional self-harm documented was indeed suicidal in nature. 
Patient interviews and careful examination of PSS-3 response patterns in Phase 3 confirmed 
that the vast majority of intentional self-harm was composed of recent suicidal ideation or 
behavior.
Conclusions
Such a remarkable and robust increase in screening by clinicians during routine care in busy 
EDs, and the subsequent increase in risk detection that would not have been identified if 
universal screening had not been implemented, has never before been published. This 
landmark finding, if scaled beyond the ED-SAFE sites, has the potential to dramatically 
improve identification of nascent suicide risk in a highly vulnerable group, thereby paving 
the way for applying interventions to reduce subsequent suicidal behavior.

 Figure 2. Time series plot of screening rates by site across the three phases
Lines represent the percentage of patients that were screened for intentional self-harm. One 
site (dark blue) achieved 95% screening in Treatment as Usual, because hospital 
administration interpreted the Joint Commission Patient Safety Goal 15 as requiring 
universal screening. This site implemented the screening after site selection had been 
completed for the study but before Treatment as Usual began. In Phase 2, this site switched 
over to the PSS-3 and continued universal screening.
