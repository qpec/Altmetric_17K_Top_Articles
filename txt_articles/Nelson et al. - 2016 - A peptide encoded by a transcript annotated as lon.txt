Abstract
Muscle contraction depends on release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and reuptake 
by the Ca2+adenosine triphosphatase SERCA. We discovered a putative muscle-specific long 
noncoding RNA that encodes a peptide of 34 amino acids and that we named dwarf open reading 
frame (DWORF). DWORF localizes to the SR membrane, where it enhances SERCA activity by 
displacing the SERCA inhibitors, phospholamban, sarcolipin, and myoregulin. In mice, 
overexpression of DWORF in cardiomyocytes increases peak Ca2+ transient amplitude and SR 
Ca2+ load while reducing the time constant of cytosolic Ca2+ decay during each cycle of 
contraction-relaxation. Conversely, slow skeletal muscle lacking DWORF exhibits delayed Ca2+ 
clearance and relaxation and reduced SERCA activity. DWORF is the only endogenous peptide

 known to activate the SERCA pump by physical interaction and provides a means for enhancing 
muscle contractility.
Intracellular Ca2+ cycling is vitally important to the function of striated muscles and is 
altered in many muscle diseases. Upon electrical stimulation of the myocyte plasma 
membrane, Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and binds to the 
contractile apparatus triggering muscle contraction (1). Relaxation occurs as Ca2+ is pumped 
back into the SR by the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase 
(SERCA). SERCA activity is inhibited by the small transmembrane peptides 
phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), and myoregulin (MLN; also known as MRLN) in 
vertebrates and by sarcolamban A and B (sclA and sclB) in invertebrates, which diminish 
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ uptake and myocyte contractility (2-7).
Recently, we discovered the small open reading frame (ORF) of MLN within a transcript 
annotated as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) (4). We hypothesized that a subset of 
transcripts currently annotated as lncRNAs may encode small proteins that have evaded 
annotation efforts, a notion supported by recent proteomic analyses (8-10). To identify 
potential peptides, we searched presumably noncoding RNA transcripts for hypothetical 
ORFs using PhyloCSF; this method uses codon substitution frequencies (11). From these 
transcripts, we discovered a previously unrecognized ORF of 34 codons within a muscle-
specific transcript, which we call dwarf open reading frame (Dworf) (fig. S1). The Dworf 
RNA transcript is annotated as NONCODE lncRNA gene NONMMUG026737 (12) in mice 
and lncRNA LOC100507537 in the University of California, Santa Cruz, human genome 
(fig. S2A). With only 34 codons, DWORF is currently the third smallest full-length protein 
known to be encoded by the mouse genome.
The murine Dworf transcript is encoded in three exons on chromosome 3 (fig. S2A). The 
ORF begins in exon 1, which encodes the first four amino acids of the protein, and the 
remaining protein is encoded in exon 2. Use of alternative splice acceptors between exons 1 
and 2 produces two transcripts that differ by a three-nucleotide insertion. The ORF is 
conserved to lamprey, the most distant vertebrate genome available (fig. S2B), and scores 
positively with PhyloCSF (fig. S2C). The C terminus is hydrophobic and is predicted to 
encode a tail-anchored transmembrane peptide (13-15). The N terminus is less stringently 
conserved, but most sequences contain multiple charged residues (primarily lysine and 
aspartic acid) in this region. Unless otherwise noted, further studies focused on the murine 
homolog of DWORF.
Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA transcript is robustly expressed in the heart 
(Fig. 1A). By quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 
Dworf RNA was also detected in heart and soleus, a postural muscle group of the hindlimb 
containing the greatest enrichment of slow-twitch muscle fibers in mice (fig. S3A), as well 
as diaphragm, which contains some slow-twitch fibers but is primarily a fast-twitch muscle 
in mice (16, 17). Notably, Dworf was not detected in the quadriceps, a fast-twitch muscle 
group, or in cardiac atrial muscle. Dworf is not expressed in the prenatal heart but gradually 
increases in abundance postnatally (fig. S3B).

 Cloning of the Dworf 5′ untranslated region in frame with an ORF lacking a start codon 
efficiently initiates translation of the ORF (fig. S4). To further confirm that the transcript 
encodes a protein, we raised a polyclonal rabbit antibody against the N-terminal 12 amino 
acids of the predicted protein. Western blotting revealed a single band at the expected 
molecular mass of 3.8 kD in soleus and heart but not in other tissues (Fig. 1B).
Given its abundance in heart tissue, we examined whether Dworf mRNA or protein 
expression changes in response to pathological cardiac signaling. Indeed, in mice bearing a 
cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC) promoter driven calcineurin transgene, 
which serve as a model of hypertrophic heart disease that progresses to dilated 
cardiomyopathy by 6 months of age (18), Dworf mRNA was down-regulated in dilated 
transgenic hearts of 6-month-old mice (Fig. 1C). Notably, DWORF protein was more 
dramatically down-regulated than the mRNA in these hearts (Fig. 1D). DWORF mRNA was 
also down-regulated in ischemic failing human hearts, which potentially links changes in 
DWORF expression with human heart failure (Fig. 1E).
We investigated the subcellular distribution of DWORF in skeletal muscle fibers by 
electroporation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)–DWORF expression vector into the 
flexor digitorum brevis muscle of the mouse foot (19). Multiphoton excitation microscopy to 
simultaneously visualize GFP and myosin (using second harmonic generation) showed that 
GFP-DWORF localizes in an alternating pattern with myosin (Fig. 2A), a distribution 
consistent with the location of the SR. GFP-SLN and GFP-PLN were individually expressed 
in the flexor digitorum brevis muscle for comparison. The apparent co-localization of GFP-
DWORF, GFP-SLN, and GFP-PLN was striking, including transverse and lengthwise 
striations typical of SR. The sub-cellular distribution of GFP-DWORF in transfected COS7 
cells also overlaps with that of mCherry-SERCA1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 
perinuclear regions (Fig. 2B).
Because GFP-DWORF colocalizes to the SR with SERCA, we tested whether the two 
proteins physically interact. COS7 cells were cotransfected with GFP or GFP-DWORF and 
Myc-tagged SERCA1, 2a, 2b, 3a, or 3b. Immunoprecipitation with a GFP antibody 
coprecipitated GFP-DWORF with all isoforms of SERCA but did not pull down SERCA in 
GFP transfected samples lacking DWORF (Fig. 2C). We next examined whether 
coexpression of DWORF with SERCA would affect complex formation between SERCA 
and PLN, SLN, or MLN. Indeed, we observed a reduction in the binding of hemagglutinin 
(HA) epitope–tagged peptides HA-PLN, -SLN, and -MLN with SERCA when coexpressed 
with GFP-DWORF (Fig. 2D and fig. S5), which suggested that binding of DWORF and 
PLN, SLN, or MLN to SERCA is mutually exclusive. We mutated residues on the M6 
transmembrane helix of SERCA1, which are known to interact with PLN, and performed 
pull-down experiments (20). We observed a reduction in SERCA interaction with GFP-
DWORF comparable to that of GFP-PLN, which suggested that both peptides bind to 
similar regions of the SERCA pump (fig. S6) (20). Coexpression of Myc-SERCA2a with 
various ratios of GFP-DWORF and GFP-PLN followed by immunoprecipitation with Myc-
specific antibody (anti-Myc) and immunoblotting with GFP-specific antibody indicated that 
DWORF and PLN have similar binding affinities for SERCA (fig. S7).

 To assess the functions of DWORF in vivo, we generated mouse models of gain and loss of 
function. DWORF overexpression in the heart was achieved by expressing untagged 
DWORF under the control of the cardiomyocyte-specific αMHC promoter in transgenic 
mice. Two transgenic (Tg) founders that overexpressed the protein were selected for further 
studies. Other proteins involved in Ca2+ handling were largely unaffected in these transgenic 
mice (figs. S8 and S9).
We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt the coding frame of Dworf in mice. A single-
guide RNA (gRNA) was designed to target the coding sequence of exon 2 before the 
transmembrane region (Fig. 3A). Original generation F0 pups were screened for indels, and 
a founder with a 2–base pair (2-bp) insertion that disrupts the ORF after codon 16 was 
chosen for further analysis. Heterozygous Dworf knockout (KO) mice yielded homozygous 
mutant offspring at expected Men-delian ratios. Western blots of ventricular and so-leus 
muscle probed with DWORF-specific antibody showed that the DWORF protein was 
eliminated in muscle tissues of homozygous mutant mice (Fig. 3B). To our surprise, the 
Dworf transcript was up-regulated about fourfold in the Dworf KO tissue (fig. S10A), which 
suggested a potential feedback mechanism to enhance Dworf expression. Several notable 
RNA transcripts were not changed in Dworf KO mice, including those encoding the Ca2+-
handling proteins SERCA2 and PLN and the cardiac stress markers Myh7 and atrial 
natriuretic peptide (Nppa). Western blot analysis of heart (fig. S10B) and soleus muscle (fig. 
S10C) homogenates revealed no detectable changes in protein expression level, 
phosphorylation state (fig. S11), or oligomerization of major Ca2+-handling proteins.
We examined whether Ca2+ flux was altered in adult cardiomyocytes from wild-type (WT), 
αMHC-DWORF Tg, and Dworf KO mice using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye, fluo-4. 
Isolated cardiomyocytes were loaded with fluo-4, mounted on a temperature-controlled 
perfusion chamber, and electrically stimulated at 0.5 Hz to initiate intracellular Ca2+ 
transients, which were monitored by epifluorescence. Peak systolic Ca2+ transient amplitude 
and SR Ca2+ load were significantly increased in Tg myocytes (Fig. 3, C and D). The 
pacing-induced Ca2+ transient decay rate was significantly enhanced in the Tg myocytes of 
both αMHC-DWORF Tg lines (Fig. 3E and fig. S12), which suggested that SERCA is more 
active in these cells (i.e., has a lower tau value). The decay rate of caffeine-induced Ca2+ 
transients was unchanged in Tg myocytes, which indicates that the activity of the Na+/Ca2+ 
exchanger (NCX) is not altered (fig. S13A). Tg myocytes had higher baseline measurements 
of contractility—as measured by fractional shortening, peak Ca2+ transient amplitude, and 
Ca2+ transient decay rate—and responded less to β-adrenergic stimulation by isoproterenol, 
likely because they function at close to maximally active levels under baseline conditions 
(figs. S12 and S13, and table S1). In the absence of increased protein abundance of SERCA 
or changes in other known Ca2+ handling proteins, these findings indicate that SERCA 
activity is increased in muscle cells overexpressing DWORF.
The effect of Dworf ablation on skeletal muscle contractile function was assessed by 
measuring twitch force at multiple stimulation frequencies in isolated soleus muscles from 
WT and KO mice (21). We did not observe significant differences in peak muscle force 
between genotypes and saw no differences in relaxation rates at low, non-tetanic stimulation 
frequencies; however, at tetanus-inducing frequencies, relaxation rates were significantly

 slowed in Dworf KO muscles after tetanus (Fig. 3F). The effect on posttetanic relaxation 
times may suggest that Dworf expression is particularly beneficial for recovery from periods 
of prolonged contraction and Ca2+ release.
Oxalate-supported Ca2+-dependent Ca2+-uptake measurements in muscle homogenates 
provide a direct quantification of SERCA enzymatic activity (21, 22). We used this 
technique to measure SERCA activity in hearts of WT, Tg, and KO mice. Hearts 
overexpressing DWORF showed an apparent increase in SERCA activity at lower 
concentrations of Ca2+ substrate in both of our transgenic lines quantified as a higher affinity 
of SERCA for Ca2+ (reduction in KCa), and Dworf KO hearts exhibited a less obvious, but 
still significant, decrease in the affinity of SERCA for Ca2+, as indicated by an increase in 
KCa (Fig. 4A, fig. S14A, and table S2). We did not observe changes in the maximal rate of 
Ca2+ pump activity (Vmax) in any of our genotypes (table S2). Because DWORF is most 
abundant in the slow-twitch soleus muscle group, we also measured SERCA activity in 
soleus homogenates from WT and KO mice and used quadriceps muscles as a control, 
because DWORF is not expressed in this muscle group. Analysis of homogenates from the 
soleus muscle of Dworf KO mice revealed a decreased apparent affinity of SERCA for Ca2+ 
as compared with homogenates from WT muscles (Fig. 4B and table S3). These differences 
were not observed in quadriceps muscle (figs. S14B and table S4).
To determine whether DWORF directly activates SERCA or does so through displacement 
of its endogenous inhibitors, we cotransfected COS7 cells with SERCA2a and DWORF in 
the presence or absence of PLN, SLN, and MLN (4). We found that coexpression of 
DWORF alone with SERCA2a did not change the apparent affinity of SERCA for Ca2+, but 
it relieved the inhibition by PLN in a dose-dependent manner (fig. S15). Threefold 
overexpression of DWORF was sufficient to return SERCA activity to baseline levels when 
coexpressed with PLN, SLN, or MLN (fig. S16). These results indicate that DWORF 
counteracts the effect of inhibitory peptides rather than directly stimulating SERCA pump 
activity, which is consistent with the lack of primary sequence similarity between DWORF 
and SERCA inhibitors (fig. S17).
Based on gain- and loss-of-function studies, our results demonstrate that DWORF enhances 
SR Ca2+ uptake and myocyte contractility through its displacement of the inhibitory 
peptides PLN, SLN, and MLN from SERCA (Fig. 4C). Because DWORF increases the 
activity of the SERCA pump, it represents an attractive means of enhancing cardiac 
contractility in settings of heart disease. Finally, our results underscore the likelihood that 
many transcripts currently annotated as noncoding RNAs encode peptides with important 
biological functions. These small peptides may evolve rapidly as singular functional 
domains that fine-tune the activities of larger preexisting molecular complexes, rather than 
having intrinsic biologic effects themselves. In this regard, small peptides may be uniquely 
suited to act as key factors in evolutionary adaptation and speciation.
