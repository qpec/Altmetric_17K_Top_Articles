Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety
of Insulin Degludec vs Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type
2 Diabetes at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events (DEVOTE)
was a double-blind, randomised, event-driven, treat-to-target
prospective trial comparing the cardiovascular safety of insu-
lin degludec with that of insulin glargine U100 (100 units/ml)
in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular
events. This paper reports a secondary analysis investigating
associations of day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability (pre-
breakfast self-measured blood glucose [SMBG]) with severe
hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular outcomes.
Methods In DEVOTE, patients with type 2 diabetes were
randomised to receive insulin degludec or insulin glargine
U100 once daily. The primary outcome was the first occur-
rence of an adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event
(MACE). Adjudicated severe hypoglycaemia was the pre-
specified secondary outcome. In this article, day-to-day
fasting glycaemic variability was based on the standard devi-
ation of the pre-breakfast SMBG measurements. The variabil-
ity measure was calculated as follows. Each month, only the
three pre-breakfast SMBG measurements recorded before
contact with the site were used to determine a day-to-day
fasting glycaemic variability measure for each patient. For
each patient, the variance of the three log-transformed pre-
breakfast SMBG measurements each month was determined.
The standard deviation was determined as the square root of
the mean of these monthly variances and was defined as day-
to-day fasting glycaemic variability. The associations between
day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability and severe
hypoglycaemia, MACE and all-cause mortality were analysed
for the pooled trial population with Cox proportional hazards
models. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted, includ-
ing adjustments for baseline characteristics and most recent
HbA1c.
Results Day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability was signifi-
cantly associated with severe hypoglycaemia (HR 4.11, 95%
CI 3.15, 5.35), MACE (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.12, 1.65) and all-
cause mortality (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.23, 2.03) before adjust-
ments. The increased risks of severe hypoglycaemia, MACE
and all-cause mortality translate into 2.7-, 1.2- and 1.4-fold
risk, respectively, when a patient’s day-to-day fasting
glycaemic variability measure is doubled. The significant re-
lationships of day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability with
severe hypoglycaemia and all-cause mortality were

ciation with MACE was not maintained following adjustment
for baseline characteristics with either baseline HbA1c (HR
1.19, 95% CI 0.96, 1.47) or the most recent HbA1c measure-
ment throughout the trial (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.98, 1.49).

Introduction
The main goal of glucose-lowering therapy in type 2 diabetes
is to reduce the incidence and progression of both microvas-
cular and macrovascular complications [1]. However, while
insulin is traditionally considered to be the most effective
glucose-lowering therapy, and often becomes necessary as
type 2 diabetes progresses, it is associated with an increased
risk of hypoglycaemia [2, 3]. Hypoglycaemia has far-reaching
consequences, and can significantly reduce a patient’s (and
their family’s) quality of life. Concern about increasing a pa-
tient’s risk of hypoglycaemia can also have a negative impact
on the treatment decisions made by physicians [2–5].
Moreover, there is evidence that hypoglycaemia may be asso-
ciated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality,
thereby further impacting the goals of therapy [6–10].
Although the risk of hypoglycaemia is influenced by mul-
tiple factors, unstable glycaemic control – including high day-
to-day glucose variability (i.e. the variation in glucose level at
a given time point(s) over a series of days) – is associated with
a higher incidence of hypoglycaemic events [11–13].
Glycaemic variability is also associated with the development
of other diabetes-related complications based on evidence
from several previous studies where important outcomes such
as the risks of severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular
events were associated not only with average blood glucose
levels, but also with glycaemic variability [11–15]. However,
these observations have not been consistent across studies and
require further investigation [16–19].
Insulin degludec is an ultra-long-acting (pharmacokinetic
half-life of 25 h) basal insulin designed to achieve a highly
stable pharmacodynamic profile, with lower within-day and
day-to-day variability in its glucose-lowering action compared
with insulin glargine U100 (100 units/ml) and glargine U300
(300 units/ml). These properties have been demonstrated
across different patient populations in several experimental
laboratory studies [20, 21]. In the clinical setting, insulin
degludec has consistently demonstrated lower rates of overall
confirmed, nocturnal confirmed and severe hypoglycaemia
compared with other basal insulins [22–24].
The cardiovascular safety of insulin degludec compared
with insulin glargine U100 has recently been studied in the
Double-blinded Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of
Insulin Degludec vs Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2
Diabetes at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events (DEVOTE)
[24, 25]. The pre-specified primary analysis demonstrated that
insulin degludec was non-inferior to insulin glargine in terms
of cardiovascular events (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78, 1.06), and
superior with regard to hypoglycaemia risk, with lower rates
of both severe and nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia (by 40%
and 53%, respectively; both p < 0.001), achieved at similar
levels of glycaemic control as assessed by HbA1c [24].
Because of the size and design of the trial, DEVOTE provides
a valuable opportunity to investigate the relationships of day-
to-day fasting glycaemic variability with important outcomes
such as severe hypoglycaemia, major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACEs) and all-cause mortality.
Methods
The detailed methods of the trial, the trial protocol, the statis-
tical analysis plan and the list of members of the trial teams
and committees have been published previously [24, 25].
DEVOTE is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number
NCT01959529). The trial was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice
Guideline [26, 27]. The protocol was approved by
independent ethics committees or institutional review boards
for each centre; written informed consent was obtained from
each patient before any trial-related activities.
In brief, DEVOTE was a multicentre, prospective, treat-to-
target, randomised, double-blind, active-comparator cardio-
vascular outcomes trial designed to continue until at least
633 MACEs, confirmed by a central, blinded, independent
Event Adjudication Committee (EAC), had accrued [24, 25].
All participants had type 2 diabetes treated with at least one
oral or injectable glucose-lowering agent with HbA1c ≥ 7.0%
(53 mmol/mol), or treated with ≥ 20 units/day of basal insulin.
Patients were eligible for the trial if they either had at least one
Diabetologia (2018) 61:48–57
49
 co-existing cardiovascular or renal condition and were aged
≥ 50 years, or had at least one of a list of pre-specified cardio-
vascular risk factors and were aged ≥ 60 years.
Patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular
events were randomised 1:1 to receive either insulin degludec
(Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) or insulin glargine
(Sanofi, Paris, France), both in identical 100 U/ml, 10 ml
vials, administered once daily between dinner and bedtime,
in addition to standard care. All patients were allowed to con-
tinue their pre-trial glucose-lowering therapy with the excep-
tion of basal and premix insulins, which were discontinued.
Patients were to titrate their basal insulin weekly, based on
the lowest of three pre-breakfast self-measured blood glucose
(SMBG) values measured 2 days before and on the day of
titration, with the aim of achieving a target of 4.0–5.0
mmol/l. To safeguard vulnerable patients, an alternative target
of 5.0–7.0 mmol/l was permitted at the discretion of the in-
vestigator. Bolus insulin (insulin aspart), provided by Novo
Nordisk for patients either continuing or initiating bolus treat-
ment during the trial, was to be titrated weekly based on the
lowest of three preprandial or bedtime SMBG values mea-
sured on the 3 days before titration, with the aim being to
achieve a target of 4.0–7.0 mmol/l. Higher targets were
allowed at the discretion of the investigator.
The following events were adjudicated by the EAC in a
blinded manner: severe hypoglycaemia, acute coronary syn-
drome (defined as myocardial infarction or unstable angina
pectoris requiring hospitalisation), stroke and fatal events.
The primary composite endpoint was the time from
randomisation to the first occurrence of death from cardiovas-
cular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal
stroke. Severe hypoglycaemia was a pre-specified,
multiplicity-adjusted secondary outcome, as defined by the
ADA as an episode requiring the assistance of another person
to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or to take
other corrective actions. Plasma glucose levels may not be
available during an event, but neurological recovery is con-
sidered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a
low plasma glucose level [28].
In this secondary analysis, the standard deviation of the
pre-breakfast SMBG measurements, defined as the day-to-
day fasting glycaemic variability measure, was calculated as
follows. Each month, only the three pre-breakfast SMBG
measurements recorded before contact with the site were used
to determine a day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability mea-
sure for each patient. For each patient, the variance of the three
log-transformed (natural logarithm) pre-breakfast SMBG
measurements each month was determined. The standard de-
viation was determined as the square root of the mean of these
monthly variances and was defined as day-to-day fasting
glycaemic variability. For descriptive purposes, this measure
of glycaemic variability is expressed as the geometric coeffi-
cient of variation, a measure of dispersion relative to the geo-
metric mean, corresponding to 1 standard deviation dispersion
around the geometric mean [29]. It is computed by
exponentiating the standard deviation of the log-transformed
pre-breakfast SMBG measurements and subtracting 1. Day-
to-day fasting glycaemic variability was calculated on a loga-
rithmic scale in order to reduce the interdependency between
mean glycaemic control and measures of day-to-day fasting
glycaemic variability. An investigation with interaction
terms indicated that the association between day-to-day
fasting glycaemic variability and outcomes was the same
for both treatment arms (insulin degludec and insulin
glargine), and so the association is reported for the pooled
population. All analyses were conducted using SAS, ver-
sion 9.4 (https://www.sas.com/en_ca/software/sas9.html).
A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
For the purposes of summarising the baseline characteris-
tics by low and high day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability,
the patient population was divided into tertiles or thirds de-
fined by low, medium and high variability. Grouping patients
into thirds to investigate variability has been used in previous
studies [30–32]. Example SMBG profiles for three separate
DEVOTE patients can be seen in Fig. 1. These three patients
represent each of the three variability groups. Each variability
group represents relative values based on the range of vari-
ability within a given trial, and thus should be interpreted only
within a given trial.
The associations of day-to-day fasting glycaemic variabil-
ity with time to first severe hypoglycaemic event, time to first
MACE and time to all-cause mortality were investigated with
Cox proportional hazards models. The models were adjusted
for treatment and baseline laboratory-measured fasting plasma

 glucose (FPG). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted.
The first analysis adjusted for the most recent HbA1c measure-
ment as a time-dependent covariate. The second analysis, as
was reported in Marso et al [24], adjusted for investigational
product, baseline HbA1c above or below 8% (64 mmol/mol),
sex, region, age at baseline, smoking status at baseline, diabe-
tes duration at baseline, cardiovascular risk group inclusion
criteria, insulin-naive at baseline and renal function (eGFR)
at baseline. This analysis was then repeated twice, either
adjusting for baseline HbA1c on a continuous scale or using
the most recent HbA1c measurement as a time-dependent
covariate.
Results
A total of 7637 patients were randomised to either insulin
degludec (n = 3818) or insulin glargine (n = 3819). Of these,
93% completed the final follow-up visit. Vital status was
known for 99.9% of patients. The median observation time
was 1.99 years. Of the 7637 randomised participants, a vari-
ability measure could not be established for 51 of these
participants.
Baseline characteristics and outcomes by variability group
Baseline characteristics differed across the three glycaemic
variability groups. In particular, the high variability group
had a longer duration of diabetes (18.8 years vs 14.1 [low
variability group] and 16.3 [medium variability group] years),
higher HbA1c levels (8.8% [72.2 mmol/mol] vs 8.1%
[65.4 mmol/mol; low variability group] and 8.4%
[68.2 mmol/mol; medium variability group]), higher FPG
levels (9.9 mmol/l vs 9.2 [low variability group] and 9.5 [me-
dium variability group]), and lower eGFRs (64.7 ml−1 min−1
(1.73 m)−2 vs 70.5 [low variability group] and 68.7 [medium
variability group]) (Table 1). The three variability groups were
similar in terms of lipid levels, body weight, blood pressure,
cardiovascular risk group inclusion criteria and smoking sta-
tus. The mean, standard deviation, and minimum and maxi-
mum levels of variability for each variability group are
summarised in Table 2, along with the HbA1c levels at base-
line and month 24. Overall, the average proportionate change
in HbA1c levels from baseline to month 24 was similar across
the three variability groups. A summary of the numbers and
rates of events by variability group for severe hypoglycaemia,
MACE (including the individual components of the MACE
composite) and all-cause mortality are included in Table 3.
There was no between-treatment difference in terms of the
association between day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability
and the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, MACE or all-cause
mortality. On this basis, the association between day-to-day
fasting glycaemic variability and outcomes is reported for the
pooled population.
Associations between day-to-day fasting glycaemic vari-
ability and outcomes Higher day-to-day fasting glycaemic
variability was significantly associated with higher risks of
severe hypoglycaemia (HR 4.11, p < 0.001), MACE (HR
1.36, p = 0.0023) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.58,
p < 0.001) before adjustments (Fig. 2). The increased risks
of severe hypoglycaemia, MACE and all-cause mortality
translate into 2.7-, 1.2- and 1.4-fold risk, respectively, when
a patient’s day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability measure is
doubled. The significant relationship between day-to-day
fasting glycaemic variability and severe hypoglycaemia and
all-cause mortality was maintained after adjustments for the
most recent HbA1c measurement throughout the trial (HR
4.15, p < 0.0001; HR 1.53, p = 0.0011) or baseline character-
istics (investigational product, sex, region, age at baseline,
smoking status at baseline, diabetes duration at baseline, car-
diovascular risk group inclusion criteria, insulin-naive at base-
line and renal function [eGFR] at baseline) with either base-
line HbA1c above or below 8% (64 mmol/mol; HR 3.20,
p < 0.001; HR 1.41, p = 0.0160), baseline HbA1c (HR 3.22,
p < 0.001; HR 1.33, p = 0.0430) or the most recent HbA1c
measurement throughout the trial (HR 3.37, p < 0.001; HR
1.33, p = 0.0432) (Fig. 2). The significant association with
MACE before adjustment was maintained after adjustments
for the most recent HbA1c measurement throughout the trial
(HR 1.30, p = 0.0101) or baseline characteristics with baseline
HbA1c above or below 8% (64 mmol/mol; HR 1.25,
p = 0.0437) (Fig. 2). However, the significant association
was not maintained following adjustment for baseline charac-
teristics with either baseline HbA1c (HR 1.19, p = 0.1208) or
the most recent HbA1c measurement throughout the trial (HR
1.21, p = 0.0811; Fig. 2). The associations of day-to-day
fasting glycaemic variability with the individual components
of the MACE composite are shown in Fig. 3.
Discussion
The results of the analyses presented here indicate associa-
tions of day-to-day fasting with glycaemic variability, severe
hypoglycaemia and all-cause mortality.
Awell-accepted consequence of high glycaemic variability
is that individuals with diabetes are more likely to experience
hypoglycaemia, and in particular severe hypoglycaemia, as
demonstrated by several studies [11–13, 33–35]. A prospec-
tive observational study using continuous glucose monitoring
reported a significant association between higher standard de-
viation of mean glucose and a higher incidence of asymptom-
atic hypoglycaemia [34]. The Diabetes Outcomes in Veterans
Study also found that mean blood glucose and the standard
deviation of mean glucose were stronger determinants of
hypoglycaemia than HbA1c [35]. Furthermore, a pooled anal-
ysis demonstrated that the day-to-day glucose coefficient of

 variation was significantly correlated with the rate of
hypoglycaemia [36]. It is important to note, however, that
there are several metrics for assessing glycaemic variability.
The above studies focused on mean glycaemic variability,
while in our analysis we focused on the fasting SMBG mea-
surements as a measure of day-to-day fasting glycaemic var-
iability. It is currently unknown whether fasting blood glucose
variability confers additional risk for adverse events beyond
those associated with chronic hyperglycaemia. In this context,
our study clearly demonstrates that higher day-to-day fasting
glycaemic variability is associated with a higher risk of both
severe hypoglycaemia and all-cause mortality. This result was
consistent even following adjustments for various baseline
characteristics, including baseline HbA1c and the most recent
HbA1c measurement throughout the trial. A similar result was
reported by an analysis of the Predictable Results and
Experience in Diabetes through Intensification and Control
to Target: An International Variability Evaluation
(PREDICTIVE) study that used FPG values as a measure of
variability, whereby fasting glycaemic variability was signifi-
cantly associated with nocturnal hypoglycaemia following ad-
justments for change in HbA1c measurements [37].
Clamp studies have shown that fluctuations in blood glu-
cose induce higher levels of oxidative stress and endothelial
dysfunction, factors that are implicated in the development of
cardiovascular disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes,
compared with stable, constant high blood glucose concentra-
tions [38–40]. However, it is possible that glycaemic variabil-
ity may indirectly increase the risk of cardiovascular events
due to an increase in severe hypoglycaemia for which

 evidence of an association with cardiovascular events is accu-
mulating [41, 42].
Irrespective of this, high fasting glycaemic variability and
hypoglycaemia are concerns for all patients treated with blood
glucose-lowering therapies. In addition, our results also raise
the possibility that there are some patients who are more sus-
ceptible to severe hypoglycaemia because they are unable or
unwilling, for a variety of reasons, to appropriately modify
their insulin dose to reduce their fasting glycaemic variability.
On this basis, the findings from the current study provide
further support for the concept that patients requiring insulin
might benefit from treatment with a basal insulin that has low
day-to-day variability and hence provides consistent fasting
blood glucose levels.
A limitation of this study was that glycaemic variability
was related solely to fasting SMBG values, albeit these were
measured frequently during the trial. In addition, for each
participant, one measure of variability was determined based
on SMBG measurements recorded during the whole trial and
included in the analysis as a baseline variable. A possible
improvement could have been to update each patient’s vari-
ability measure throughout the trial because variability may
have changed as glycaemic stability was achieved.
The present analyses have a number of strengths, including
the large sample size, the double-blind active-control design,
the high level of cardiovascular risk of the patient population,
and the independent adjudication of cardiovascular and severe
hypoglycaemic events. The prospective design and
multicentre, international nature of this trial and the high
levels of patient follow-up further contributed to the robust-
ness of the analyses. In addition, while other measures of
glucose variability could have been used, the method we have
used in our analyses accounts for variation in fasting SMBG
values resulting from the changing dose of basal insulin dur-
ing the titration phase. By first determining the monthly var-
iances for each patient and then taking the mean, this allows
the day-to-day variability to be separated from the overall
mean glycaemic control, especially as the latter may be affect-
ed by the treat-to-target regimen. Further contributing to our
ability to separate effects of mean glycaemic control and day-
to-day glycaemic variability was the use of relative compari-
sons effected by analysing the data on a logarithmic scale. An
additional strength of this method was the high number of
SMBG measurements used to determine each patient’s day-
to-day variability, thereby strengthening our assessment of
variability. Furthermore, the inclusion of several sensitivity

Fig. 2 Day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability and its associations with
severe hypoglycaemia, MACE and all-cause mortality. Day-to-day
fasting glycaemic variability was based on the standard deviation of the
pre-breakfast SMBG measurements. Adjustment 1: adjusted for the most
recent HbA1c measurement on a continuous scale. Adjustment 2: adjusted
for baseline HbA1c above or below 8% (64 mmol/mol) and baseline
characteristics (investigational product, sex, region, age at baseline,
smoking status at baseline, diabetes duration at baseline, cardiovascular
risk group inclusion criteria, insulin-naive at baseline and renal function
[eGFR] at baseline). Adjustment 3: adjusted for baseline HbA1c on a
continuous scale and baseline characteristics as for adjustment 2.
Adjustment 4: adjusted for most recent HbA1c measurement on a contin-
uous scale and baseline characteristics as for adjustment 2

 analyses provides additional information about the relation-
ship between day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability and
outcomes. These analyses demonstrated that the significant
association between day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability
and MACE was lost following adjustment for baseline char-
acteristics, some of which are known to be associated with
increased cardiovascular risk, and either baseline HbA1c or
the most recent HbA1c measurement throughout the trial. Of
note, however, significance was maintained when only adjust-
ed for the most recent HbA1c measurement throughout the
trial. It is likely that the significant association is lost in part
due to multicollinearity of baseline factors related to MACE.
For example, diabetes duration and region are included in the
multivariable adjustments and are non-significant predictors.
However, if either is deleted from the multivariable adjust-
ments, the association between day-to-day fasting glycaemic
variability and MACE remains significant.
In conclusion, evidence from DEVOTE supports associa-
tions between higher day-to-day fasting glycaemic variability
and increased risks of severe hypoglycaemia and all-cause
mortality.
