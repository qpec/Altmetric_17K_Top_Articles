Understanding the neurobiology of social bonding in non-human primates is a critical
step in understanding the evolution of monogamy, as well as understanding the
neural substrates for emotion and behavior. Coppery titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus)
form strong pair bonds, characterized by selective preference for their pair mate,
mate-guarding, physiological and behavioral agitation upon separation, and social
buffering. Mate-guarding, or the “maintenance” phase of pair bonding, is relatively
under-studied in primates. In the current study, we used functional imaging to examine
how male titi monkeys viewing their pair mate in close proximity to a stranger male
would change regional cerebral glucose metabolism. We predicted that this situation
would challenge the pair bond and induce “jealousy” in the males. Animals were injected
with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), returned to their cage for 30 min of conscious
uptake, placed under anesthesia, and then scanned for 1 h on a microPET P4 scanner.
During the FDG uptake, males (n = 8) had a view of either their female pair mate next
to a stranger male (“jealousy” condition) or a stranger female next to a stranger male
(control condition). Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected and assayed
for testosterone, cortisol, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Positron emission tomography
(PET) was co-registered with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and region of
interest analysis was carried out. Bayesian multivariate multilevel analyses found that the
right lateral septum (Pr(b > 0) = 93%), left posterior cingulate cortex (Pr(b > 0) = 99%),
and left anterior cingulate (Pr(b > 0) = 96%) showed higher FDG uptake in the jealousy
condition compared to the control condition, while the right medial amygdala (Pr(b > 0)
= 85%) showed lower FDG uptake. Plasma testosterone and cortisol concentrations
were higher during the jealousy condition. During the jealousy condition, duration of
time spent looking across at the pair mate next to a stranger male was associated
with higher plasma cortisol concentrations. The lateral septum has been shown to be
involved in mate-guarding and mating-induced aggression in monogamous rodents,
while the cingulate cortex has been linked to territoriality. These neural and physiological
changes may underpin the emotion of jealousy, which can act in a monogamous species
to preserve the long-term integrity of the pair.

Jealousy in Male Titi Monkeys
INTRODUCTION
Shakespeare’s “green-eyed monster” has been written about for
centuries (Shakespeare, 1988), but the scientific study of jealousy
is relatively young. Jealousy is an aspect of romantic relationships
that works to maintain the relationship, but which can develop
into intimate partner violence when unrestrained (Buss, 2002;
Neal and Edwards, 2015). Jealousy may have given a fitness
advantage to humans in our ancestral environment; current
evidence shows that culture also plays a role (Harris, 2003). The
emotion of jealousy is a form of social rejection that occurs
when another individual (partner, parent, etc.) appears to devalue
a relationship because of an outside third party (Leary, 2015).
Because jealousy is an emotion that often occurs in the context
of reproductive relationships, it is relevant to our understanding
of the evolution and neurobiology of pair bonds.
The neural basis of jealousy in humans is not well understood
in part because eliciting jealousy requires complex social
interactions which may be difficult to create in a laboratory
setting (Harmon-Jones et al., 2009). However, a large body of
studies has suggested that social rejection of various types is
mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex (Eisenberger, 2015).
A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
asked participants to imagine that an early stage romantic partner
“did not prefer” them over a romantic rival. This jealousy
condition provoked activation in the dorsal and ventral striatum
(dopaminergic areas), as well as the cingulate cortex (Sun
et al., 2016). Dopamine agonist therapy is also associated with
delusional jealousy in Parkinson’s patients (Poletti et al., 2012).
Investigating the neurobiology of jealousy in non-human
primates that form pair bonds is an important step in
understanding
the
evolution
of
monogamy.
Male
sexual
“jealousy” was studied in the context of rhesus monkey
consortships using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
(Rilling
et
al.,
2004).
Rhesus
monkeys
are
not
socially
monogamous, but do form short-term consortships in which a
male guards an estrus female (Manson, 1997; Palombit, 2014).
When rhesus males viewed their consort next to a stranger male,
they had increased [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in
areas including the right amygdala and right superior temporal
sulcus; plasma testosterone concentrations also increased (Rilling
et al., 2004). Theoretically, a threat to a long-term reproductive
and affiliative relationship might be even more salient than
a threat to a short-term sexual consortship, because it is an
attachment bond and there are more resources to lose (Ellis
and Weinstein, 1986). Unlike rhesus monkeys, titi monkeys
are socially monogamous and form long-term pair bonds, and
thus might even have stronger “jealousy” reactions than rhesus
monkeys (which only form consortships).
Social monogamy is displayed by a small minority of
mammals, usually estimated at 3–5% of mammalian species
(Kleiman, 1977; Lukas and Clutton-Brock, 2013; Diaz-Munoz
and Bales, 2016; Tecot et al., 2016). In socially monogamous
animals, the development of an adult attachment relationship or
“pair bond” is associated with the onset of mate-guarding in both
males and females (Mason, 1966; Winslow et al., 1993; McGuire
and Getz, 1998; Fernandez-Duque et al., 2000; Bowler et al., 2002;
Getz et al., 2003; Fisher-Phelps et al., 2016; Tabbaa et al., 2016).
This behavior helps maintain the relationship through aggression
toward both same- and opposite-sex individuals. The pair bond
is a construct encompassing a preference for the familiar partner,
distress upon separation, and the ability of the pair mate to buffer
stress (Mason and Mendoza, 1998). As such, it is very similar
to a human romantic relationship (Hazan and Shaver, 1987;
Sbarra and Hazan, 2008) and the pair mates might be expected to
feel jealousy if a third party threatened that relationship. While
the neurobiology of pair bonding has been best studied in a
rodent model, the socially monogamous prairie vole (Microtus
ochrogaster), the many potential differences between rodent and
primate nervous systems make a primate model for pair bonding
desirable as well (Phillips et al., 2014; Bales et al., 2017).
Titi monkeys (genus Callicebus) are small, arboreal primates
which display social monogamy (including “jealousy” behavior)
both in the field (Mason, 1966; Spence-Aizenberg et al., 2016;
Van Belle et al., 2016) and in the laboratory (Mason, 1974;
Mendoza and Mason, 1997; Carp et al., 2016). For example, in
the wild, a male was observed placing himself in between his
female pair mate and intruding male, and physically restraining
his female pair mate to keep her from moving toward an
“intruder” male (Mason, 1966). Wild titi monkeys of both sexes
respond to conspecific playbacks by duetting and approaching
the speaker, which may function as both territorial and mate
defense (Caselli et al., 2015). Both males and females show strong
arousal reactions toward outsiders, including tail-lashing and
arched-back displays, and restraint of the pair mate to keep
her/him away from the stranger, although males have stronger
reactions than females (Cubiciotti and Mason, 1978; Fernandez-
Duque et al., 2000). This jealousy reaction can be duplicated in a
laboratory context either with live intruders (Fernandez-Duque
et al., 2000) or by introduction of a mirror in which the pair sees
their own reflections (Fisher-Phelps et al., 2016). Titi monkeys
provide an ideal non-human primate to examine a challenge
to the pair bond that could elicit a “jealousy” response. Ellis
and Weinstein (Ellis and Weinstein, 1986) proposed that three
conditions are necessary for eliciting jealousy: (1) an attachment
relationship between two individuals, (2) valued resources that
are part of the attachment bond, and (3) intrusion by a third
individual that is perceived by one partner as wanting to become
a receiver of resources. Titi monkeys fit these criteria since the
(1) adult male and female form an attachment relationship with
each other (unlike most other monkeys), and (2) titi monkeys
naturally respond to “intruders” in the wild and captivity.
In addition to the potential neural changes associated with
jealousy, we were also interested in the potential hormonal
changes. In the rhesus monkey study, males who viewed
their consort next to a stranger male had an increase in
plasma testosterone concentrations (Rilling et al., 2004). While
testosterone is the hormone most often associated with male
jealousy or mate-guarding (Wingfield et al., 1990; Gray et al.,
2017), there is also evidence for the role of vasopressin in
aggression from both animals (Winslow et al., 1993; Ferris and
Delville, 1994; Stribley and Carter, 1999; Gobrogge and Wang,
2016; Simmons et al., 2017) and humans (Marshall, 2013).
Vasopressin and oxytocin are also involved in the neurobiology

Jealousy in Male Titi Monkeys
of pair bond formation (Numan and Young, 2016). A role for
cortisol in jealousy is also plausible based on its responses to
challenging social situations (Breuner and Hahn, 2003; Casto and
Edwards, 2016; Beehner and Bergman, 2017; Mendoza, 2017).
In the current study, we examined potential changes in the
neural and hormonal substrates in response to a challenge to the
pair bond of male titi monkeys, using the previously mentioned
rodent, rhesus monkey, and human studies as our guides for the
outcome measures. We exposed our subjects to two conditions
in which they viewed either (1) their female pair mate next to
a stranger male (jealousy condition) or (2) a stranger female
next to a stranger male (control condition). We expected to see
increased [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the lateral
septum; this could be due to up-regulation of dopamine D1
receptors as has been observed in monogamous prairie voles
who mate-guard (Aragona et al., 2006; Resendez et al., 2016)
and titi monkeys who were recently paired (Hostetler et al.,
2017). We also examined other areas implicated in jealousy
in rodents (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex, medial amygdala,
anterior hypothalamus), rhesus monkeys (i.e., insular cortex,
superior temporal sulcus, Rilling et al., 2004), or humans (i.e.,
anterior cingulate, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, ventral
pallidum, Sun et al., 2016). While we do not specifically know
the distribution of androgen receptors in titi monkeys, we did
have a strong a priori prediction of increased plasma testosterone
concentrations, because of testosterone’s association with mating-
related aggression and competition (Gray et al., 2017; Wingfield,
2017). Similarly, we predicted increases in plasma hormone
concentrations of cortisol, oxytocin, and vasopressin due to their
association with social challenge (Mendoza, 2017).
METHODS
All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of the University of California, Davis, and
complied with National Institutes of Health ethical guidelines as
set forth in the Guide for Lab Animal Care.
Subjects
Subjects were eight captive-born adult male titi monkeys
(Callicebus cupreus) housed at the California National Primate
Research Center (CNPRC) in Davis, CA. Subjects were a mean
age of 7.7 years old (median 7.0, range 4.0–12.8), and were living
with their female pair mates for a mean of 2.5 years (median
1.7, range 0.7–9.9). All subjects were parents of offspring living
in the cage. Animals were fed twice daily (0,830 and 1,330 h) a
diet consisting of New World monkey chow, rice cereal, banana,
apples, raisins, and baby carrots and water was available ad
libitum. Further details of husbandry and training are available
elsewhere (Tardif et al., 2006).
Experimental Design and PET Scanning
with FDG
Functional imaging was used to examine how males viewing
their pair mate in close proximity to a stranger male would
differ in their regional cerebral glucose metabolism compared
to viewing a stranger male next to a stranger female in adjacent
cages. Subjects, pair mates and young offspring (less than 1 year
old) were relocated to a metabolism room 48 h prior to their
positron emission tomography (PET) scan. As in our previous
PET studies (Bales et al., 2007; Hinde et al., 2016; Maninger
et al., 2017), animals were relocated prior to the scan in order to
reduce the possible effect of novel housing on brain metabolism.
Animals were fasted 6–12 h prior to the scan, with water available
throughout the pre-scan period. On the day of the scan, all of the
animals were caught and removed from the cage. The subject was
manually restrained while he received a bolus injection of [18F]-
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG, PETNET Solutions, Sacramento, CA,
up to 2 mCi/kg IV, administered in a volume of <2 ml) into the
saphenous vein.
Following the FDG injection, the male was put back in his
cage alone (since his pair mate and offspring were removed) for
the 30 min conscious uptake period, where he had visual access
to another cage that housed two animals separated by a wire
mesh. In the jealousy condition, the two animals in the viewing
cage were the subject’s female pair mate and a stranger male
(Figure 1). The stranger was a male who was unfamiliar to the
subjects. Viewing a stranger male adjacent to his female pair mate
was designed to challenge the pair bond and induce “jealousy” in
the male subjects. In the control condition, there was a stranger
female and a stranger male monkey (note that this was a different
animal from the jealousy condition) in the viewing cage. Because
titi monkeys are territorial animals when paired and can show
aggression to opposite-sex strangers (Fernandez-Duque et al.,
2013), the male and female in the viewing cage were separated
by a wire mesh in order to prevent any physical aggression (and
potential wounding) between the unfamiliar animals. This was
important because there were no humans in the room during
the FDG uptake period to stop any fights. During the control
condition, the female pair mate was moved out of the testing
room. The offspring were moved out of the testing room for
both the control and jealousy conditions. A camera was placed at
the side of the subject’s cage and the male was filmed during the
uptake period for 30 min, while all of the humans left the room.
Each of the eight males experienced both the jealousy and control
conditions on separate days; there was a mean of 5.2 weeks (range
3–6.3) between testing days. The order of conditions was counter-
balanced, such that four males experienced the jealousy condition
before the control condition and four males experienced the
control condition before the jealousy condition.
After the FDG uptake period, subjects were anesthetized
with ketamine (25 mg/kg IM) and administered medetomidine
(0.05 mg/kg IM). After the subject was sedated, a 1 ml blood
sample was collected from the femoral vein and put into a
heparin-containing tube, and a sample of cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) was collected and put on ice. In order to ensure that
hormonal outcomes were not influenced by the considerable
disturbances involved prior to collection of blood samples, care
was taken to ensure that the time of day was comparable for a
given subject tested in each condition. Testing started between
0,800 and 0,839 h for the first subject, and the second subject
was tested approximately 1.5–2 h later. Cortisol concentrations
for males tested in the first (earlier) group averaged 94.1 ±
5.8 µg/dl, while males tested in the later group averaged 55.7

Jealousy in Male Titi Monkeys
FIGURE 1 | Research Design. Subject males (n = 8) each underwent two conditions: a jealousy condition and a control condition. In the jealousy condition, they

± 7.2 µg/dl. While time of day was correlated with cortisol
concentrations (r = –0.575), this effect of circadian rhythm
was accounted for in the design of the study by carrying out
both of an individual’s scans (control and jealousy) in the same
time grouping (early or late). For example, both of 32878’s
scans were carried out in the early group, and both of 31716’s
scans were carried out in the late group. We also measured the
duration of time between capture of the subject following FDG
uptake until bloodand CSF sample collection (i.e., “disturbance
time”). Disturbance time for blood samples was a mean of
5.22 min (median 4.80, range 1.72–16.15) after capture and
sedation (raw data in Appendix 1). This disturbance time was
not statistically correlated with plasma cortisol concentrations
(r = 0.102). CSF samples were collected a mean of 9.50 min
(median 9.88, range 5.75–13.13) after capture and sedation (raw
data in Appendix 1; no statistical analysis on CSF data was carried
out).
Following
collection
of
blood
and
CSF
samples,
an
endotracheal tube was placed and a catheter was placed in
the saphenous vein in order to administer IV fluids (lactated
ringers solution, 10 ml/kg/h). Atipamazole was used to reverse
medetomidine, and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane
(1–2%), while the male was positioned on the scanner bed feet
first and the brain of the animal was positioned in the center
of the scanner. PET imaging was performed on a microPET P4
scanner (Siemens Preclinical Solutions, Knoxville, TN). Image
acquisition began a mean of 69.49 (SD ± 7.52) minutes post-FDG
administration, and static PET scans were acquired for 60 min.
Anesthesia was maintained throughout the scan. Animals were
housed in metabolism cages for 24 h after scanning, at which
time radiation was decayed to background levels and animals
were returned to their home cages.
MRI Scanning
Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were
conducted in a GE Signa LX 9.1 scanner (General Electric
Corporation, Milwaukee, WI) with a 1.5 T field strength and a 3′′
surface coil. Each male was fasted 8–12 h before the procedure. At
the start of the procedure, the male was sedated with ketamine (10
mg/kg IM) and medazolam (0.1 mg/kg IM), and an endotracheal
tube was placed. A catheter was also placed in the saphenous
vein in order to administer fluids as necessary. Anesthesia was
maintained with isoflurane (1–2%) while the male was positioned
in the MRI scanner. Each scan lasted approximately 20 min and
consisted of a 3D SPGR pulse sequence in a coronal plane. Images
of the entire brain were collected using the following parameters:
echo time TE = 7.9 ms, repetition time TR = 22.0 ms, flip angle
= 30.0◦, field of view = 8 cm, number of excitations = 3, matrix
= 256 × 256, and slice thickness = 1 mm. As a precautionary
measure, the male’s EtCO2, oxygen saturation, heart rate and
blood pressure were monitored throughout.
PET and MRI Coregistration, Quantification
of FDG Uptake
We determined which regions of interest (ROIs) to quantify
based on three groups of studies: rodent studies of aggression
(lateral septum, medial amygdala, posterior cingulate cortex,
and anterior hypothalamus), the Rilling rhesus monkey study

of consortship (superior temporal cortex, insular cortex), and
human studies of social pain and jealousy (anterior cingulate
cortex, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, caudate, and
putamen) (Figure 2).
ROI structures were individually drawn on each subject’s MRI
image, for both left and right hemispheres, using landmarks
as a guide, in Siemen’s Inveon Research Workplace software
(IRW, Siemens Healthcare, USA). ROIs were drawn prior to
co-registrations with the PET image, so they were drawn blind
with regard to PET image/FDG uptake and to experimental
condition. The same ROIs were used for both the jealousy and
control conditions. Static PET images were reconstructed with
a 3DRP reconstruction protocol. MRI images were co-registered
with PET scan images using the automatic rigid registration
algorithm in IRW and checked visually for registration accuracy.
Mean activity for the PET images were determined in IRW by
applying ROIs defined on the MRI images to the PET images.
Data are presented in proportions of whole brain activity, which
was calculated by dividing the mean activity in the ROI (in units
of microcuries per cubic centimeter) by mean activity of whole
brain ROI.
Behavioral Coding
Males were filmed during the 30 min FDG uptake period. After
all of the PET scans were completed, the videos were scored by a
trained coder (T.S.) who was blind to experimental condition and
validated against previous scoring done in the laboratory. Videos
were scored on Behavior Tracker 1.5 (behaviortracker.com)
for duration of the behaviors in the ethogram (see Table 1).
Behaviors included lip smacking (an affiliative behavior), tail
lashing (an arousal behavior), arching (an arousal behavior), as
well as looking across at the stimulus cage, locomotion, chewing,
drinking, and “off camera.” Data analyses were performed on the
total duration of each behavior (i.e., the absolute length of time
the behavior was performed).
Blood Sampling and Hormone Analysis
Blood and CSF samples were collected after animals were
sedated for the PET scan following the FDG uptake period,
and placed on ice. Blood samples in heparin-containing tubes
were centrifuged at 3,000 RPM for 15 min at 4◦C. Plasma
was aliquoted, and plasma and CSF samples were stored at
−70◦C until assay. CSF samples were assayed for oxytocin
(OT) and vasopressin (AVP). Plasma samples were assayed for
testosterone, cortisol, OT, and AVP. While the veterinarians
collected as many CSF samples as possible, often they were
unable to get a sample due to the small size of the animals
(male subjects weighed a mean of 1.3 kg, median 1.2, range
1.1–1.6). Therefore, we present CSF values in Appendix 1,
but did not have an adequate sample size to analyze them
statistically.
AVP and OT concentrations were estimated in duplicate
using commercial enzyme immunoassay kits (Enzo Life Sciences,
Farmingdale, NY) previously validated for titi monkeys. Assay
sensitivity was 2.34 pg/ml for AVP and 15.55 pg/ml for OT.
Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were 3.36 and
14.34% respectively for AVP, and 10.62 and 12.78%, respectively
for OT. Plasma cortisol and testosterone concentrations were
estimated in duplicate using commercial radioimmunoassay kits
(Siemens Healthcare, Malvern, PA). Prior to cortisol assay,
plasma samples were diluted 1:4 in PBS gel buffer. Cortisol assay
procedures were modified with the addition of 0.5 and 2.35 µg/dl
concentrations of standards along with the provided range of 1.0–
49 µg/dl. Assay sensitivity was 0.261 µg/dl. Intra- and inter-assay
CV were 3.20 and 6.26%, respectively. Prior to testosterone assay,
plasma samples were diluted 1:2 in PBS gel buffer. Testosterone
assay procedures were modified with the addition of 57 and 197.5
ng/dl concentrations of standards along with the provided range
of 24–1,667 ng/dl. Testosterone assay sensitivity was 4.58 ng/dl.
All samples were run in the same assay and intra-assay CV was
1.02%.
Data Analysis
All models were fitted in a fully Bayesian multivariate multilevel
framework for several reasons. First, due to our small sample
size and large number of outcomes, multivariate models could
not be estimated with least squares or maximum likelihood
methods. Bayesian multivariate methods allowed for estimation
of hypothesized regions of interest that included numerous
correlated outcomes in one model. In addition, Bayesian
multilevel methods fully account for uncertainty across levels
of hierarchically structured data (McElreath, 2015), which was
important due to our within-subjects design. Third, Bayesian
methods allow for incorporating prior information into the
model which improves precision of the parameter estimates
(Gelman et al., 2008; Kruschke and Vanpaemel, 2015; see
Supplementary Material for model details). Finally, parameter
estimates have probabilistic interpretations, which allows for
estimating the probability of a positive or negative experimental
effect (Zucker et al., 1997; Lee, 2011).
In total, we fit five multivariate multilevel models. The
first three models were based on hypothesized brain regions
previously implicated as modulating jealousy-like behavior in
different species: (1) mate-guarding in rodents; (2) jealousy
or social pain in humans; and (3) bilateral regions from the
rhesus monkey study. The next two multivariate multilevel
models assessed hormonal and behavioral differences. The final
models were exploratory, in that outcomes were determined
from our results. These final models were not multilevel,
but multivariate examining correlations between look duration
and hormones as well as FDG uptake in ROIs (for the
jealousy condition only). For these models, we standardized
the predictors and response variables so that the estimates
were on r scale (correlation coefficient). All model based
estimates are provided in Tables 2–6, whereas the raw means
and standard deviations are provided with the model checks
(Appendix 2).
Variance was partitioned into two components (Gelman and
Hill, 2007): (1) the variance (σ 2
u) between subjects (i.e., varying
intercepts); and (2) the residual variance (σ 2
e ). As a measure
of residual variance explained by subject, we computed intra-
class correlation coefficients (ICC) (Quene and Van Den Bergh,
2004). Each multivariate model included one fixed effect, which
provided a contrast from the control group. The parameter

estimates were summarized with 95% credibility intervals (CrI)
that, by definition, have a 95% probability of containing the
true parameter (Morey et al., 2015). Bayesian methods provide
probabilistic estimates that allow for explicit statements about
likely values for the true treatment effect. We thus computed
posterior probabilities of a positive or negative effect (Pr(b >
0) and Pr(b < 0)) (Gelman, 2013; Greenland and Poole, 2013).
This is not possible with classical methods, since parameters are
assumed to be fixed point estimates (probability distributions
cannot exist). Posterior probabilities >80% are reported in
the results section, but all estimates are provided in tables.
The 80% figure was chosen merely as a convenient figure in
order to simplify the reporting of the results. Finally, an effect
size parameter (δT) was obtained from dividing the estimate

0.8).
The jealousy condition for one male was not usable for
technical reasons, thus the final sample size was 8 control scans
and 7 jealousy scans, for 8 total subjects. Due to the complexity
of the multivariate multilevel models, we examined fit with
posterior predictive checks and posterior predictive p-values
(Gelman et al., 1996; de la Horra and Rodriguea-Bernal, 1999).
Here, the fitted model was used to simulate data, from which
a properly specified model will provide replications that look
like the observed data and non-extreme p-values (0.95 > p-
value > 0.05). For most models, the posterior predictive p-values
indicated that model fit was adequate (Appendix 2).
All computation was done in R (Team, 2016).The package
brms (Buerkner, 2015), a front end to the probabilistic
programming language Stan (Stan_Development_Team, 2015),
was used to fit all regression models (all R script and data are
available upon request).

A Note on Interpretation of Results
The use of Bayesian statistics remains relatively uncommon.
This may be seen as a limitation when comparing our results
to the extant literature. Indeed, our use of Bayesian methods
has different goals than typically pursued: we did not focus
on rejecting a null hypothesis. Instead, our analysis sought to
quantify the most probable values for the “true” effect of jealousy
on regional cerebral glucose metabolism, hormones and behavior
in titi monkeys. This is not possible with classical methods (e.g.,
ANOVA) in which evidential quantities (e.g., p-values) are in
reference to counterfactual sampling procedures. When inferring
from our results, the posterior probabilities can be directly
interpreted as probabilities (how probability is used in everyday
language). The present approach does not include thresholds (i.e.,
cut-offs, but of course a probability of 99% provides stronger
evidence than 85%, assuming equal prior odds). A meaningful
probability can be determined in light of theory, past research,
the quality of this study (including limitations), and the reported
results (Harrell and Shih, 2001; Gelman, 2013; Greenland and
Poole, 2013; Gelman et al., 2014; Kruschke, 2014).
RESULTS
FDG Uptake
Our first multivariate multilevel model simultaneously estimated
areas implicated by rodent studies as modulating mate-guarding
behavior: the lateral septum (LS), anterior hypothalamus (AH),
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and medial amygdala (MeA).
The probability of a positive effect of jealousy condition on FDG
uptake in the right LS was 93% (b = 0.04, CrI = [−0.02–0.10],

was some evidence for reduced uptake in the right MeA (Pr(b

Figure 3A). The posterior probabilities for the other comparisons
were below 80% and are reported in Table 2. Notably, the amount
of variation explained by subject across outcomes ranged from
9% (left AH: ICC = 0.09, CrI = [0.00–0.44]) to 42% (right LS:
ICC = 0.42, CrI = [0.004–0.87]).
Our second multivariate multilevel model examined several
cortical areas that were shown to be associated with jealousy or
social pain in human studies [anterior cingulate cortex (AC),
caudate (Ca), putamen (P), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and
ventral pallidum (VP)]. The probability of a positive effect of
jealousy condition on FDG uptake in the left AC was 96%
(b = 0.05, CrI = [−0.01–0.10], δT = 0.79)], while there was
some evidence for reduced uptake in the right Ca (Pr(b > 0)
= 90%, b= 0.04, CrI = [−0.03–0.10], δT = 0.41), right VP
(Pr(b > 0) = 86%, b= 0.05, CrI = [–0.03–0.13], δT = 0.38),
and the left VP (Pr(b> 0) = 88%, b= 0.04, CrI = [−0.03–
0.13], δT = 0.38). According to the posterior predictive checks,
model fit was adequate. The other comparisons are provided in
Table 3. The amount of residual variation explained by subject
across outcomes ranged from 13% (left VP: ICC = 0.13, CrI
= [0.00–0.56]) to 53% (right Ca: ICC = 0.53, CrI = [0.02–
0.89]).

of jealousy condition on plasma testosterone (b = 190.17, CrI

(Pr(b > 0) = 90%) of jealousy condition on lip smacking

Correlations: Jealousy Condition
Durations of behaviors were standardized prior to analysis,
resulting in correlations (r). Look duration via a single-level
multivariate model was positively correlated with cortisol (b =
0.63, CrI = [−0.07–0.98], Pr(b > 0) = 97%). The correlation with
testosterone was also positive, but the interval was very wide (b =
0.31, CrI = [−0.67–0.94], Pr(b > 0) = 78%). Using a single-level
multivariate model to investigate associations between behavior
and brain region of interest, we found that look across duration
had a probability of a positive correlation on FDG uptake in
the right LS of 92% (b = 0.53, CrI = [−0.32–0.97]; Figure 4A).
There were substantial negative correlations with look duration

[−0.93, 0.60]). There were negative correlations between cortisol
concentrations and FDG uptake in the left PCC (b = −0.19, CrI

CrI = [−0.97, 0.22], Pr(b < 0) = 93%). There was a positive
correlation between cortisol concentrations and FDG uptake in
the right LS (b = 0.31, CrI = [−0.66, 0.94], Pr(b > 0) = 81%),
but the interval was very wide.
DISCUSSION
After seeing his female pair mate next to a stranger male,
male titi monkeys showed increased FDG uptake in the right
lateral septum (LS), left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and
left anterior cingulate (AC), and decreased uptake in the right
medial amygdala (MeA) compared to the control condition.
Our subjects also had higher plasma testosterone and cortisol
concentrations and spent more time lip smacking in the
jealousy condition compared to the control condition. In the
jealousy condition, the amount of time looking at the pair
mate next to a stranger male was associated with higher plasma
cortisol concentrations. These neural and physiological changes
may underpin the emotion of jealousy, which can act in a
monogamous species to preserve the long-term integrity of the
pair.
We now have multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the
lateral septum plays a role in both pair bond formation and
pair bond maintenance in titi monkeys. The lateral septum is
innervated by vasopressin fibers in many mammalian species,
including a number of primate species (Ragen and Bales, 2013).
In titi monkeys it contains oxytocin receptors but not vasopressin
receptors (Freeman et al., 2014), suggesting that any actions
of vasopressin in that area are mediated through oxytocin
receptors (Barberis and Tribollet, 1996). In addition, it receives

dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (Sheehan
et al., 2004). In our initial cross-sectional study comparing
pair bonded males to males that were housed alone, FDG
uptake in the lateral septum was statistically different between
the two groups, with a difference of 9% (Bales et al., 2007).
Dopamine D1 receptor binding in the lateral septum of male
titi monkeys is also statistically significantly up-regulated 4–9
weeks following pair bonding (Hostetler et al., 2017). In socially
monogamous prairie voles, up-regulation of D1 receptors is
associated with the onset of mate-guarding, although in that
case the sensitive neural area is the nucleus accumbens (Aragona
et al., 2006). The lateral septum also plays an important role
in social memory (Everts and Koolhaas, 1999) and in the
preference formation aspects of pair bonding (Liu et al., 2001).
The lateral septum also modulates stress in many species, via an
oxytocinergic mechanism (Singewald et al., 2011; Guzman et al.,
2013), and stress can modulate the process of social bonding
(DeVries et al., 1996). In this study, the medium-large effect
size that we found suggests not just a long-term change in
dopamine neurochemistry (Hostetler et al., 2017), but also a
strong involvement in acute responses to a threat to the pair
bond.
In the present study we also found higher FDG uptake in the
left posterior cingulate cortex in the jealousy condition, as well
as evidence for a positive effect in the left anterior cingulate.
In semi-free-ranging prairie voles, higher vasopressin receptor
binding in the posterior cingulate was associated with higher
fidelity to the partner (Ophir et al., 2008), which theoretically
could be related to a stronger pair bond or more time spent in
proximity mate-guarding. The fact that we also found evidence
for higher FDG uptake in the anterior portion of the cingulate
(and that the effect sizes for both posterior and anterior were
large and remarkably similar in magnitude) suggests that our
“jealousy” condition affects the left cingulate cortex as a whole,
and is not just confined to the posterior cingulate. There are
well-studied associations between anterior cingulate cortex and
socially painful situations (Eisenberger, 2015), which fits with the
view of jealousy as social rejection.
Our study found lateralized effects of the jealousy condition
on regional cerebral glucose metabolism, such that male titi
monkeys showed increased FDG uptake in the right lateral
septum (LS), left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and left
anterior cingulate (AC), and decreased FDG uptake in the right
medial amygdala (MeA) in the jealousy condition compared to
the control. Lateralized effects have also been found in human
studies of jealousy or other forms of social exclusion. In a human
study on jealousy using electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure
electrical activity of the brain, jealousy evoked by a computerized
ball-tossing game was associated with greater relative left frontal
activation (Harmon-Jones et al., 2009). In that study, the authors
concluded that their left frontal activation finding was consistent
with jealousy being associated with approach motivation. This
finding was interpreted within long-standing research in human
emotion that greater left-sided brain activity is associated with
approach behavior and predominantly positive affect, while
relative greater right-sided activity is associated with avoidance
behavior and negative emotions (Davidson and Fox, 1982).
Like our male titi monkeys, Takahashi et al. (2006) found men
who read about infidelity showed functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) changes in the amygdala and the cingulate cortex
(Takahashi et al., 2006). Takahashi et al. (2006) found that men
who read statements about sexual infidelity had increased fMRI
activation in the right amygdala (as well as other areas), while
men who read statements about emotional infidelity had greater
fMRI activation in the left and right cingulate cortex (as well as
other areas). Unlike Takahashi and colleagues, who found right
and left activation of the cingulate cortex with jealousy, Sun
and colleagues (Sun et al., 2016) found that the left posterior
cingulate gyrus fMRI activation was associated with romantic
jealousy and the left anterior cingulate gyrus was associated with
romantic happiness. Using EEG, fMRI and regional cerebral
glucose metabolism PET/MRI methods allow us to visualize
what areas of the brain are associated with behavior and social
scenarios, but they do not allow us to know what types of
receptors are being activated or what neurotransmitters are
changing in the brain. Future research on jealousy using PET
with specific radiotracers could allow us to measure changes in
neurotransmitter availability and potentially in release in this
model (Hostetler et al., 2017). While it is commonly assumed that
lateralization is a human trait, brain (and behavior) asymmetries
are not the exception but the norm, and can be found in
all taxa of the animal kingdom (Gunturkun and Ocklenburg,
2017).
We found lower probabilities that our experimental condition
affected plasma hormone concentrations of OT (65%) or AVP
(74%), and a small effect size for AVP. Some human studies
have found relationships between elevated plasma oxytocin
levels and socially painful situations such as troubled romantic
relationships (Taylor et al., 2010) or other types of relationship
distress (Taylor et al., 2006), mainly in women. In contrast to
women, higher levels of plasma vasopressin, but not oxytocin,
were associated with relationship problems in men (Taylor
et al., 2010). Although we did not find large differences in our
peripheral measure of plasma OT and AVP peptide hormones,
this does not mean that central nervous system changes in OT
and AVP did not occur. Plasma and other peripheral measures
of these peptide hormones are considered imperfect reflections
of central nervous system levels (Freeman et al., 2016). An
additional explanation for why we did not find a larger effect
for plasma OT or AVP is the timing of when we collected blood
samples from our subjects. While sampling blood following
the 30 min FDG uptake period was reasonable timing to see
effects of steroids such as testosterone and cortisol (Mendoza,
2017), it would almost certainly be past the peak timing to
see effects of a behavioral stimulus on plasma oxytocin (Kenkel
et al., 2012). Lastly, these blood samples also were taken after
animals were sedated, so they do not represent “baseline” blood
samples.
As predicted, there were positive associations between the
jealousy condition and plasma steroid hormone concentrations
of
testosterone
and
cortisol.
Testosterone
concentrations
were measurably higher in the jealousy condition, with a
small to medium effect size. This increase is not surprising
given testosterone’s association with mating-related aggression

 Maninger et al.
Jealousy in Male Titi Monkeys
(Wingfield et al., 1990; Wingfield, 2017). The “challenge
hypothesis” predicts that androgens should respond acutely
to social challenges, and then return to baseline in order to
avoid adverse effects of steroids (Wingfield et al., 1990). This
has been generally supported in the literature, including that
on non-human primates (Bales et al., 2006) and humans
(Archer, 2006). Cortisol was marginally higher during the
jealousy condition (92% probability of a true effect), and it was
significantly correlated with the time that the subject spent
gazing at his pair mate and the stranger male, suggesting that
this stimulus does constitute a social stressor (Mendoza, 2017).
The increased time spent lip smacking during the jealousy
condition compared to the control condition was possibly
affiliative behavior directed toward his pair mate, an attempt
to get her attention, or a form of self-soothing behavior.
We did not tape the stimulus pair, so we do not know what
specific behavior our subject was viewing. This is a limitation
of the current study which should be corrected in future
studies.
We also cannot say definitively that the subjects in our
experiment experienced the emotion of “jealousy.” Similarly,
with
humans
we
would
need
verbal
confirmation
that
participants experienced this emotion. In particular, since
the pair mate was separated from the stranger by a barrier, the
stimulus may have been less potent for the subject than if the
pair mate and stranger had full access to each other. The higher
testosterone concentrations experienced by our male subjects
when viewing their pair mate next to a stranger, as well as the
positive correlations between duration of time spent looking
across at them and both cortisol concentrations and FDG uptake
in the lateral septum, do suggest that this situation may have been
viewed as a challenge to the pair bond or sexual relationship.
However, it is worth noting that the emotion we attribute to the
subjects was not shown unambiguously through behavior.
A neural model of pair bonding in titi monkeys is beginning
to coalesce, and the available evidence suggests both similarities
and differences to the current, rodent-based model (Gobrogge
and Wang, 2015; Numan and Young, 2016). When forming pair
bonds, both prairie voles and titi monkeys recruit neural areas
rich with oxytocin and/or vasopressin receptors and involved in
social memory (such as the lateral septum), and dopaminergic
areas involved in reward (such as the nucleus accumbens) (Bales
et al., 2017). The involvement of these two systems suggests that
the initial pair bond formation, and subsequent mating, serve
both as learning and as positive reinforcing stimuli, involving
the neural systems involved in other motivated behaviors
(Tops et al., 2014). The maintenance phase of pair bonding is
thought to be based on negative reinforcement; i.e., avoidance
of aversive stimuli such as separation (Resendez et al., 2016),
and to involve the opioid and dopamine systems as well. The
lateral septum in titi monkey brain contains oxytocin receptors
(Freeman et al., 2014), dopamine D1 receptors (Hostetler et al.,
2017), dopamine D2 receptors (Bales, unpublished data), and
both µ and K opioid receptors (Ragen et al., 2015). Thus,
the lateral septum appears to be a hot-spot for both the
formation and the maintenance of pair bonding in male titi
monkeys. The neural substrates of primate pair bonding thus
appear to involve the same principles and neurochemistry,
but differing neural areas, as rodent pair bonding. Based on
current mammalian phylogenies, it is likely that monogamy
evolved multiple times (Lukas and Clutton-Brock, 2013), and
it is therefore not surprising for the details of neurobiological
mechanism to differ. Convergent evolution on nonapeptide
mechanisms, however, seems likely given the outcomes of this
and other studies.
Previous findings, as well as the present study, have suggested
an important role for the lateral septum. Future research
might focus on this area and particularly on interactions
between the oxytocin, dopamine, and opioid systems, in order
to continue dissecting the underpinnings of pair bonding in
primates. Special attention will need to be paid to other
potential differences from rodents, such as the longer time
that it takes for primates to form a pair bond (Rothwell,
unpublished data). Studying these neural substrates of social
bonds may give us important clues with which to approach
health and welfare problems such as addiction (Tops et al.,
2014), autism (Anagnostou et al., 2014), and partner violence
(Marshall, 2013). Finally, they may help inform us as to the
evolutionary origin and maintenance of monogamy as a social
system.
