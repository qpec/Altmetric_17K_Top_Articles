ubstantial progress has been made in the management 
of heart failure over the past 10 years.1 However, heart 
failure remains a common cause of morbidity and mor-
tality, with an estimated prevalence of 1%–2% in the general 
population and a lifetime risk of 1 in 5 in men and women.2,3 
Heart failure accounts for 35% of total cardiovascular mortality 
in women.4 Compared with men, women with heart failure are 
often older and more likely to have heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction with a hypertensive rather than ischemic etiol-
ogy. Important trends in the incidence and outcomes of heart 
failure have been recently published.5,6 These studies suggest 
that the incidence of heart failure has declined in many cohorts; 
however, the prognosis of this disease remains poor. There are 
known sex-based differences in the risk factors, presentation 
and management of heart disease.7–9 At a time when heart fail-
ure management has greatly improved, detailed sex-stratified 
outcomes are scarce in hospital-admitted cohorts and unavail-
able in ambulatory patients. Given the sex differences in comor-
bidities and outcomes in heart failure, it is not known whether 
and how these current changes are modified by sex. An in-depth 
understanding of these sex differences may help to increase 
awareness and lead to clinical trials to identify optimal monitor-
ing and treatment strategies in women and men. We examined 
the sex differences in heart failure incidence, mortality, hospital 
admissions and comorbidities in a contemporary population-
based cohort from fiscal years 2009 to 2013.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Heart failure remains a 
substantial cause of morbidity and mor-
tality in women. We examined the sex 
differences in heart failure incidence, 
mortality and hospital admission in a 
population-based cohort. 
METHODS: All Ontario residents who 
were diagnosed with heart failure in an 
ambulatory setting between Apr. 1, 2009, 
and Mar. 31, 2014, were included in this 
study. Incident cases of heart failure 
were captured through physician billing 
using a validated algorithm. Outcomes 
were mortality and hospital admission 
for heart failure within 1 year of the diag-
nosis. Probability of death and hospital 
admission were calculated using the 
Kaplan–Meier method. The hazard of 
death was assessed using a multivariable 
Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: A total of 90 707 diagnoses of 
heart failure were made in an ambula-
tory setting during the study period 
(47% women). Women were more likely 
to be older and more frail, and had dif-
ferent comorbidities than men. The inci-
dence of heart failure decreased during 
the study period in both sexes. The mor-
tality rate decreased in both sexes, but 
remained higher in women than men. 
The female age-standardized mortality 
rate was 89 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 80–100) per 1000 in 2009 and 85 
(95% CI 75–95) in 2013, versus male age-
standardized mortality rates of 88 (95% 
CI 80–97) in 2009 and 83 (95% CI 75–91) 
in 2013. Conversely, the rates of incident 
heart failure hospital admissions after 
heart failure diagnosis decreased in 
men and increased in women.
INTERPRETATION: Despite decreases in 
overall heart failure incidence and mor-
tality in ambulatory patients, mortality 
rates remain higher in women than in 
men, and rates of hospital admission for 
heart failure increased in women and 
declined in men. Further studies should 
focus on sex differences in health-
seeking behaviour, medical therapy and 
response to therapy to provide guid-
ance for personalized care.

Methods
Study design and population
We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study in 
Ontario, Canada, using linked administrative databases. 
Included were patients 40 years of age and older who were newly 
diagnosed with heart failure in an ambulatory setting between 
Apr. 1, 2009, and Mar. 31, 2014. We excluded non-Ontario resi-
dents, those who were 105 years of age and older at the time of 
diagnosis, and those diagnosed with heart failure in an inpatient 
setting. During the study period, Ontario was Canada’s most 
populous province with a publicly funded, universal health care 
system that reimbursed all medically necessary health care and 
hospital services.
Data sources
Databases were linked deterministically using unique encoded 
identifiers. Incident cases of heart failure were identified using 
the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) Ontario Con-
gestive Heart Failure database, where ambulatory cases of heart 
failure were derived from Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) 
billings based on 1 outpatient claim for heart failure that was fol-
lowed by at least 1 additional outpatient claim within 1 year. 
Heart failure diagnoses made during an emergency department 
visit that did not result in hospital admission were considered 
ambulatory. This algorithm was validated in primary care patient 
records and shown to have 85% sensitivity and 97% specificity in 
identifying heart failure events.10 Analyses were conducted by 
linking the ICES Ontario Congestive Heart Failure database with 
the Registered Persons Database for demographics and vital sta-
tistics, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Dis-
charge Abstract Database for hospital admissions and comorbid-
ities, the CIHI Same Day Surgery Database for comorbidities and 
the OHIP database for physician fee-for-service claims. Although 
they lack physiologic and laboratory measures, these databases 
have been validated for the measurement of many outcomes, 
exposures and comorbidities.11–14
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 1 year of the 
diagnosis of heart failure. Mortality was ascertained by using the 
Registered Persons Database. The secondary outcome was hos-
pital admission for heart failure within 1 year of the diagnosis, 
which was ascertained by using the Discharge Abstract Database.
Covariates
Demographic variables (i.e., age and sex) were obtained from the 
Registered Persons Database. We estimated socioeconomic sta-
tus based on patients’ neighbourhood median income in the 
Canadian census, and determined their residence (rural v. urban) 
using definitions from Statistics Canada.15 We identified hyper-
tension,11 asthma,16 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD)17 and diabetes mellitus13 using validated algorithms. 
Other comorbidities were identified using the Discharge Abstract 
Database, Same Day Surgery Database and OHIP databases 
based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, 10th revision, codes within 5 years 
before the heart failure diagnosis, using previously described 
methods.18,19 Frailty status was identified using the Johns 
Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indi-
cator, which is an instrument designed and validated for 
research of frailty-related outcomes and resource utilization 
using administrative data.20–24
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed in the overall cohort and then strati-
fied by sex. Continuous variables were analyzed using the 
Student t test and expressed as means and standard deviations. 
Categorical variables were analyzed using the χ2 test and 
expressed as numbers and proportions. Standardized differences 
were used to compare the characteristics of men and women 
with incident heart failure.25
Survival time was defined from the date of heart failure diag-
nosis until death or last follow-up. Patients were censored when 
they lost possession of valid Ontario health insurance for 2 con-
secutive eligibility quarters (i.e., they left Ontario). Probability of 
death was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method, with the 
significance of the difference between sexes assessed using the 
log-rank test. The relative hazard of death was assessed using 
Cox proportional hazard models with multivariable adjustment 
for all variables listed in Appendix 1, Supplemental Table 2 (avail-
able at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.180177/-/
DC1), and without the use of selection algorithms. We estimated 
the cumulative incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure 
using the cumulative incidence function, which treated death as 
a competing risk. Rates were directly standardized by age using 
the 1991 Canadian population as the reference. To justify sex-
specific analyses, we tested for the presence of any interaction 
between sex and each of the mortality risk factors using multipli-
cative interaction terms. The measure of association was hazard 
ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were 
performed using SAS version 9.3, with statistical significance 
defined by a 2-sided p value less than 0.05.
Ethics approval
The research ethics board of the Sunnybrook Health Sciences 
Centre approved this study and waived the need for informed 
consent.
Results
A total of 90 707 diagnoses of heart failure were made in an 
ambulatory setting during the 5-year study period (47% women). 
Compared with male patients, female patients with heart failure 
were more likely to be older and more frail, to have lower socio-
economic status, and to have comorbid conditions such as 
hypertension, pulmonary circulatory disease, COPD, hypothy-
roidism, metastatic malignancy, dementia and depression. Con-
versely, women were less likely than men to have atrial fibrilla-
tion, myocardial infarction (MI), valvular disease, peripheral 
arterial disease, diabetes, renal disease, liver disease and alcohol 
abuse (Table 1).

Heart failure incidence, mortality and hospital 
admission
Heart failure incidence reached a nadir for both men and women 
in fiscal years 2011 and 2012, but began to rebound in 2013 (Fig-
ure 1; Appendix 1, Supplemental Table 1).
A total of 7156 women (16.8%) and 7138 men (14.9%) died 
within 1 year of follow-up. Age-standardized mortality rates 
decreased in both sexes, but remained higher in women than in 
men. Specifically, the female age-standardized mortality rate per 
1000 was 89 (95% CI 80–100) in 2009 and 85 (95% CI 75–95) in 
2013, and the male age-standardized mortality rate was 88 (95% 
CI 80–97) in 2009 and 83 (95% CI 75–91) in 2013 (Appendix 1, 
Supplemental Table 1). Kaplan–Meier survival curves show lower 
estimated survival in women compared with men (Figure 2A). 
The overlapping CIs in the male and female age-standardized 
mortality rates preclude our ability to conclude on the 
significance of the relation between sex and mortality over time.
Trends of incident hospital admissions for heart failure 
reversed in men and women over the course of the study (Appen-
dix 1, Supplemental Table 1). Specifically, the age-standardized

rate of hospital admission for heart failure per 1000 was higher in 
men (rate 103, 95% CI 93–114) than women (rate 90, 95% CI 
79–101]) in 2009. In 2013, these rates were higher in women (rate 
98, 95% CI 86–110) than men (rate 91, 95% CI 82–101). Cumula-
tive incidence function curves (Figure 2B) illustrate higher cumu-
lative incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure in women 
compared with men. The overlapping CIs in the male and female 
age-standardized rates of hospital admission for heart failure 
preclude our ability to conclude on the significance of the rela-
tion between sex and hospital admissions over time.
The association of sex and 1-year mortality
Female sex was associated with an increased risk of death in the 
unadjusted analysis (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10–1.18). However, it was 
mildly protective after adjustment for other risk factors listed in 
Appendix 1, Supplemental Table 2 (adjusted HR 0.97, 95% CI 
0.93–1.00). Other multivariable predictors of mortality were 
advanced age, low socioeconomic status, peripheral arterial 
disease, cerebrovascular disease, COPD or asthma, alcohol 
abuse, liver disease, renal disease, diabetes, dementia, 
depression, psychosis, primary and metastatic malignancies, 
paraplegia and venous thromboembolism (Appendix 1, 
Supplemental Table 2). Conversely, hypertension and valvular 
disease were correlated with lower risks of mortality.
Table 2 shows the sex-specific HRs for 1-year mortality in this 
ambulatory cohort. Of note, low socioeconomic status was asso-
ciated with a higher risk of mortality, and MI was associated with 
a lower risk of mortality in men but not in women. In addition, 
men with COPD or asthma, dementia and cancer had a higher 
risk of death than women, and women with peripheral arterial 
disease had a higher risk of death than men.
Interpretation
We found that, despite modern advances in heart failure therapy, 
heart failure mortality remains high, especially in women. We 
found additional sex discrepancies regarding hospital admis-
sions for heart failure and associated comorbidities.
Substantial progress in heart failure management has been 
made over the past decade.1 In addition, risk factors for heart 
failure have changed owing to advances in the treatment of its 
leading cause, ischemic heart disease,26 and the rising preva-
lence of obesity and diabetes.27,28
In the Framingham Heart Study, researchers evaluated a 
mixed hospital-admitted and ambulatory cohort from 1950 to 
1999 and reported that the incidence of heart failure declined in 
women but not in men, and survival improved in both sexes.29 
Another community-based report from 1979 to 2000 found stable 
heart failure incidence but a greater improvement in survival in 
men than in women.30 Yeung and colleagues observed continued 
decline in both heart failure incidence and 1-year mortality in 
ambulatory patients from 1997 to 2007.5 More recently, 
Christiansen and colleagues reported similar decreases in heart 
failure incidence and mortality from 1999 to 2012.6 Our findings 
suggest that the incidence of heart failure has declined from 
2009 to 2013, but continues to be greater in men than in women. 
The incidence of heart failure observed in our study is lower than 
that described in previous studies6,29,30 and may reflect a continu-
ing temporal decline of the incidence of heart failure or increas-
ing acuity of heart failure presentations in the modern era (i.e., 
an increase in the proportion of first heart failure diagnosis in 
hospital). The latter may also be related to the younger age of 
our cohort at the time of diagnosis. Specifically, younger patients

may more likely present in an ambulatory care setting, whereas 
older, sicker patients may more likely present in an acute care 
setting. Despite improvements in medical therapy, mortality 
from heart failure remains high. This is particularly relevant given 
that ambulatory patients are often perceived to be at lower risk 
compared with inpatients. The age-standardized mortality rates 
were higher for women than men. However, after multivariable 
adjustment, female sex was associated with a slightly lower risk 
of mortality. This observation emphasizes the importance of 
adjustment for confounding factors in research on heart failure, 
as well as the evaluation of comorbidities in the management of 
patients with heart failure.
We observed a reversal of the ratio of male:female hospital-
admission rates over time such that these rates decreased for 
men but increased for women. This is consistent with the litera-
ture31 and may reflect death being a competing risk for hospital 
admission in men. Alternatively, it possibly also reflects the 
underlying heart failure type, since men are more likely to have

heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (for which there are 
several treatments known to improve outcomes and decrease 
hospital admission), whereas women are more likely to have 
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction32 (for which thera-
pies are aimed only at alleviating symptoms, and no therapies 
have been shown to alter the natural history or outcomes).
A recent report of inpatients with heart failure suggested an 
inverse relation between left ventricle ejection fraction and 
adverse outcomes in men but not in women, as well as sex differ-
ences in the prognostic impact of comorbidities such as ane-
mia.33 These studies suggest that an in-depth understanding of 
sex differences in comorbidities could inform management deci-
sions. Women with heart failure are older and more likely than 
men to have hypertension, renal failure, obesity and depression, 
but overall better survival. Men with heart failure are more often 
smokers and more likely to have MI, COPD and heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction.34 Our findings are consistent across 
many of these comorbidities; however, we found lung disease to 
be more common in women. Whether this is due to sex differ-
ences in smoking rates, and uptake and compliance with smok-
ing cessation programs is not known. In addition, we found 
frailty, dementia and metastatic malignancy to be more preva-
lent in women, which likely reflect older ages at heart failure pre-
sentation in women. Interestingly, we also found a correlation of 
hypertension with lower mortality risk in both sexes, and a corre-
lation of MI with lower mortality risk only in men. The protective 
effect of hypertension may be related to the increased risk asso-
ciated with low blood pressure in patients with heart failure.35,36 
Furthermore, women with ischemic heart disease may experi-
ence higher rates of missed or delayed management owing to 
atypical presentation and lower rates of coronary catheteriza-
tion. The latter may contribute in part to an underestimation of 
ischemic heart disease severity and poorer outcomes.37,38
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, cases of heart failure were 
identified in the ambulatory care setting based on the requirement 
of 2 claims for heart failure within 1 year. Although this method 
may underestimate heart failure, it has been validated and shown 
to improve the specificity of our case selection.5,10 Second, infor-
mation on ejection fraction was not available in the databases 
used, which precluded analyses in subtypes of heart failure. Third, 
owing to the short period of observation, we are unable to com-
ment on important changes in patient characteristics or outcomes 
during the study period. Fourth, we examined all-cause and not 
cause-specific mortality. However, similar studies have also 
reported only on all-cause mortality. Finally, our data sources 
lacked some relevant details, such as body mass index and smok-
ing. The inability to adjust for the differences in these characteris-
tics could have led to unmeasured confounding.
Conclusion
We found that mortality from heart failure remains high, especially 
in women; that hospital admissions for heart failure decreased in 
men but increased in women; and that women and men had dif-
ferent associated comorbidities. Further studies should focus on 
sex differences in health-seeking behaviour, medical therapy and 
response to therapy to improve outcomes in women.
