Abstract
Background: Tamoxifen (TAM) has been widely used for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast
cancer and its combination with other therapies is being actively investigated as a way to increase efficacy and
decrease side effects. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of co-treatment with TAM and BreastDefend (BD),
a dietary supplement formula, in ER-positive human breast cancer.
Methods: Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined in ER-positive human breast cancer cells MCF-7 by MTT
assay, quantitation of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments and expression of cleaved PARP, respectively.
The molecular mechanism was identified using RNA microarray analysis and western blotting. Tumor tissues from
xenograft mouse model were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
Results: Our data clearly demonstrate that a combination of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) with BD lead to profound
inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. This effect is consistent with the regulation
of apoptotic and TAM resistant genes at the transcription and translation levels. Importantly, TAM and BD co-treatment
significantly enhanced apoptosis, suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor weight in a xenograft model of human
ER-positive breast cancer.
Conclusion: BD sensitized ER-positive human breast cancer cells to 4-OHT/TAM treatment in vitro and in vivo.
BreastDefend can be used in an adjuvant therapy to increase the therapeutic effect of tamoxifen in patients
with ER-positive breast cancer.

Background
As the leading cause of cancer death in females, breast
cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be divided
into three major subtypes: hormone (estrogen/progester-
one) receptor-positive, HER2-positive, and triple-negative
(estrogen, progesterone receptor and HER2-negative) [1, 2].
Among them, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast
tumors comprise approximately 75%, depending on estro-
gen signaling for growth and survival [3, 4].
Specific subtypes of breast cancer have different
responses to therapies and tamoxifen (TAM) is the
most commonly used endocrine therapy in treatment
of ER-positive breast cancer. TAM is a selective ER
modulator and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4-OHT), acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast cells
that binds ER and blocks its activity to halt cell prolifera-
tion and induce apoptosis [5–7]. Unfortunately, de novo
or acquired resistance occurs in around 30% of all ER-
positive breast cancer and tumor recurrence is observed
in many patients [8, 9]. Furthermore, long-term adminis-
tration of TAM may lead to serious side effects, such as
fatigue, painful joints and mood changes [10, 11]. There-
fore, in order to improve efficacy of the treatment and

 increase the quality of life, effective adjuvant therapies are
urgently required.
Numerous studies support that natural compounds or
dietary agents, presented in vegetables, fruits and mush-
rooms, can affect various molecular targets and signaling
pathways leading to their possible use in the combination
therapy of breast cancer [6, 12–14]. BreastDefend® (BD) is a
dietary supplement formula, which contains extracts from
medicinal mushrooms (Ganoderma lucidum, Coriolus
versicolor, Phellinus linteus), herbs (Curcuma longa,
Scutellaria barbata, Astragalus membranaceus), and
purified biologically active components (3, 3′-diindolyl-
methane, quercetin). These natural agents in BD demon-
strated anticancer activities against breast cancer through
various mechanisms [15–23]. In addition, BD alone or
combined with PectaSol-C® modified citrus pectin (MCP)
inhibits growth and invasive behavior of the highly meta-
static triple-negative human breast cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo [24–26]. However, the effects of BD and its
combination with TAM on ER-positive breast cancer have
never been evaluated.
Based on the data described above, we investigated the
sensitivity of ER-positive MCF-7 cells and its tumor
xenografts to BD, 4-OHT/TAM and their combination
treatment. Here we show, for the first time, that BD and
4-OHT/TAM work synergistically against breast cancer
by suppressing estradiol-induced proliferation of MCF-7
cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, which related to
induced apoptosis and regulation of TAM resistant pro-
teins (p21/CDKN1A and Bcl-2) expression. The findings
reveal a novel potential strategy against ER-positive human
breast cancer using combination treatment of tamoxifen
with BD.
Methods
Cell culture
A non-tumorigenic epithelial human breast cell line
MCF-10A, estrogen receptor (ER) -positive MCF-7 and
ER-negative MDA-231 human breast cancer cell lines
were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). MCF-
10A were cultured in DMEM/F12 containing 10% horse
serum,
epidermal
growth
factor
(EGF,
20
ng/ml),
hydrocortisone (0.5 mg/ml). cholera toxin (100 ng/ml),
insulin (10 μg/ml) and penicillin (50 U/ml), strepto-
mycin (50 U/ml). MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells were
cultured in DMEM containing penicillin (50 U/ml),
streptomycin (50 U/ml−) and 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). For in vitro cell culture assays assessing the
effect of BD on the ER activity, MCF-7 cells were
stripped of steroids for 3 days before seeding by cultur-
ing in steroid-free medium (SFM): phenol red-free
DMEM, supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum
(NCS), penicillin (50 U ml−1), streptomycin (50 U ml−1)
and 4 mM L-Glutamine. Medium, FBS, NCS and
culture supplements were obtained from Gibco BRL
(Grand Island, NY, USA).
Chemicals and reagents
17β-estradiol (E2), 4-OHT, anastrozole, insulin, hydrocorti-
sone, cholera toxin, and DMSO were purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). EGF was purchased from Peprotech
(Rocky Hill, NJ), horse serum was from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA). TAM pellets (5 mg/pellet, 60-day re-
lease) and E2 pellets (0.36 mg/pellet, 60-day release)
were purchased from Innovative Research of America
(Sarasota, FL, USA). Matrigel™ Matrix Growth Factor
Reduced was purchased from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA,
USA). Anti-Raf-B, anti-p21, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Fibronectin and
anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). BreastDefend®
(BD) was supplied by EcoNugenics, Inc. (Santa Rosa,
CA, USA) and dissolved in DMSO at a concentration
of 25 mg/ml then stored at −20 °C. The chemical com-
position of BD was previously published [26]. All other
chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade.
Cell proliferation assay
MCF-10A, MCF-7, MDA-231 cells were seeded into 96-
well plates (5000 cell/well). After 24 h cells were treated
with BD (10–50 μg/ml) for 3 days. Steroid-depleted MCF-
7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (5000 cell/well) in
SFM. After 24 h, cells were treated with E2 (10 nM) plus
4-OHT (1 μM), BD (10–50 μg/ml) or a combination of
both 4-OHT and BD for 3 and 6 days, respectively. Alter-
natively, MCF-7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates
(5000 cell/well) in DMEM, and after 24 h treated with
anastrozole (40 μM), BD (10 μg/ml) or a combination of
both anastrozole and BD for 48 h, respectively. Cell prolif-
eration was determined as described before [27]. Data
points represent the mean ± SD in one representative
experiment repeated at least twice.
Determination of apoptosis
Steroid-depleted MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well
plates (0.15 × 106 cell/well) in SFM. After 24 h, mono-
layers were treated with E2 (10 nM) plus 4-OHT (1 μM),
BD (10 μg/ml) or a combination of 4-OHT and BD for
6 days. Apoptosis induction was assessed by quantitation
of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments using
Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS Kit (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN, USA). The manufacturer’s instructions were followed
and data were expressed as the fold change vs. vehicle-
treated cells (set equal to 1). Data points represent the
mean ± SD in three independent experiments. Western
blotting for PARP cleavage (c-PARP) was used to confirm
the induction of apoptosis.

 Microarray gene expression profiling
Steroid-depleted MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well
plates at a density of 0.15 × 106 cell/well for 24 h and
treated with E2 (10 nM) plus 4-OHT (1 μM), BD
(10 μg/ml) or a combination of both for 6 days in
SFM. Isolation, quantification, reverse transcription of
RNA and TaqMan® Array Human Molecular Mechanisms
of Cancer were performed as described before [28]. Rela-
tive quantity (RQ) of gene expression was normalized to
GAPDH and determined using the 2-ΔΔCt method [29].
Data were expressed as the fold change vs. vehicle-treated
cells (set equal to 1) and represent the mean ± SD in three
independent experiments.
Western blot analysis
Steroid-depleted MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well
plates (0.15 × 106 cell/well) for 24 h and treated with E2
(10 nM) plus 4-OHT (1 μM), BD (10 μg/ml) or a com-
bination of both for 6 days in SFM. Whole protein ex-
tracts isolated from cells were prepared and western blot
analysis with anti-cleaved PARP, anti-Raf-B, anti-p21,
anti-Bcl-2, anti-Fibronectin and anti-β-actin antibodies
were performed as previously described [27]. Western
blots were quantified with HP-Scanjet 550c and analyzed
by UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT,
USA). Quantitative data composed of three independent
experiments with statistical analysis were expressed as
the fold change vs. vehicle-treated cells (set equal to 1)
and added below or on the right of the representative
blot images.
Human breast tumor xenograft experiments
Nu/Nu immune-compromised female ovariectomized mice
(4–5 weeks old) were obtained from Harlan Laboratories
(Indianapolis, IN, USA) and maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions with phytoestrogen-free ad libi-
tum food and water. After one week, MCF-7 cells (5 × 106)
suspension in 50 μl sterile PBS was mixed with 50 μl
Matrigel™ and subcutaneously implanted into both
sides of the inguinal mammary fat pad. E2 pellets
(0.36 mg/pellet, 60-day release) were implanted using a
10-gauge trochar into right back between the ear and
shoulder of all mice to permit tumors to form. Mice
with palpable tumors (~60 mm3) were randomly assigned
into four groups (n = 13): control, TAM, BD and TAM +
BD (number of tumors 16–24 per group). TAM pellets
(5 mg/pellet, 60-day release) were implanted subcutane-
ously into the left back between the ear and shoulder using
a 10-gauge trochar. BD was suspended in water and ad-
ministered by intragastrical gavage 5 times per week with
100 mg kg−1 of body weight for additional 4 weeks. During
the treatment period, tumor sizes were measured 3 times
per week with microcaliper and body weight was recorded
at the same time. Tumor volumes were calculated with the
standard formula: tumor volume (mm3) = L × W2 × 0.5,
where L is the length and W is the width of the tumor. At
the end of the experiment (Day 29), mice were euthanized
by CO2 inhalation. Tumors were harvested, weighed and
fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin at 4 °C for 24 h or
snap frozen and stored separately in liquid nitrogen.
Animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with the protocol approved by the Animal Research
Committee at the Indiana University Health Methodist
Hospital (protocol no. 2014–02).
Apoptosis measurement in tumor xenograft
Formalin-fixed tumors were embedded in paraffin within
48 h and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
The slides were viewed using inverted microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and apoptosis in the
viable tumor cell area was quantified by counting apoptotic
bodies in four fields of view (20 ×) by two independent
observers (n = 5-10).
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections were analyzed
by immunohistochemistry using primary antibodies against
B-raf or BRAF (Clone VE1, Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton,
CA, USA), Bcl-2 (Clone 124, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA),
p21 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) and fibronectin (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Sections were de-paraffinized, and
rehydrated. Heat mediated (20 min at 100 °C, DAKO PT
module) antigen retrieval was performed as follows for each
antibody: DAKO high pH buffer for BRAF, Bcl-2 and fibro-
nectin, while p21 was in DAKO low pH buffer. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked by H2O2 for 5 min and
slides were then incubated with BRAF and Bcl-2 antibodies
for 20 min; fibronectin and p21 for 30 min. In negative
controls, the primary antibody was replaced with PBS. Sec-
ondary antibody (DAKO Flex system) for Bcl-2 and BRAF
was added to the sections for an incubation time of 20 min;
for p21 and fibronectin, incubated for 30 min with the
Envision + R DAKO system. The stain was developed using
diaminobenzidine (DAB) and the sections counterstained
with hematoxylin.
Localization and intensity of immunoreactivities against
all primary antibodies used were examined on slides
by inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany). For the immunohistochemical quantifica-
tion, randomly selected images were analyzed in each
animal per group (n = 10) by ImageJ [30].
Statistical analysis
All the statistical analysis was carried out using SigmaPlot
11.2.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Data were
presented as mean ± SD. Statistical comparisons between
many groups of data were carried out by ANOVA with the

 all pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Holm-Sidak
method) at overall significance level p < 0.05.
Results
Anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of 4-OHT are
augmented by BD in ER-positive breast cancer cells
MCF-7
To evaluate the effect of BD on normal human epithelial
mammary gland cells and ER-negative MCF-7 and ER-
positive human breast cancer cells we treated MCF-10A,
MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells with BD (10 – 50 μg/ml) for
3 days. Here we show that the low concentration of BD
only slightly decreased proliferation of normal breast
cells MCF-10A, whereas BD strongly suppressed growth
of breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-231 (Fig. 1a).
To evaluate the effect of BD on the proliferation of the
estrogen-dependent ER-positive MCF-7 cells, we depleted
these cells of estrogen and treated MCF-7 cells with E2,
BD and 4-OHT as described in Materials and Methods.
Our results show that after 3 and 6 days of treatment, 4-
OHT (1 μM), ER receptor antagonist, significantly inhibits
E2 -dependent proliferation of MCF-7. Moreover, BD fur-
ther enhances anti-proliferative effect of BD in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 1b-c). Thus, 10 μg/ml of BD
in the combination with 1 μM of 4-OHT was selected for
future experiments in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1a, E2-inde-
pendent proliferation of MCF-7 cells was not sensitive to
the inhibitory effects BD at lower concentrations of BD.
To determine whether the inhibition of cell proliferation
by 4-OHT and BD are associated with apoptosis, we eval-
uated whether 4-OHT, BD and their combination induce
nuclear DNA fragmentation [31]. As shown in Fig. 2a,
there were nearly 18 fold increases in the apoptosis with
4-OHT (1 μM) and BD (10 μg/ml) combination compared
to the vehicle-treated control after 6 days. Apoptosis in-
duction in MCF-7 cells was further confirmed by western
blotting for the cleaved fragment of PARP (c-PARP)
[32, 33], where a combination of 4-OHT and BD dis-
tinctly increased the amount of c-PARP (Fig. 2b-c).

 In addition, we treated MCF-7 cells with BD (10 μg/ml)
and an aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (40 μM) or their
combinations for 48 h. Although anastrozole inhibited
proliferation of MCF-7 cells by 6% and BD by 13%, their
combination suppressed proliferation by 39%, suggesting
possible synergistic effect (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Since the major focus of the current study was on the
evaluation of the combined effect of BD and tamoxifen,
we will address the combined effect of BD and anastrozole
in our future study.
4-OHT and BD combination regulates multiple genes
related to apoptosis and TAM resistance
To further investigate molecular mechanisms under-
lying enhanced apoptosis induced by 4-OHT and BD
combination, gene expression profiling with microar-
rays was carried out using total RNA from MCF-7 cells
treated with 4-OHT and BD. Each set of four experi-
ments was done in triplicate to increase the precision
of estimation. The overlapping regulated genes with
large recurring expression differences (at least 1.6-fold
changed) compared to the vehicle-treated control after
treatment of 6 days are summarized (Tab. 1). Based on
the literature search, several genes associated to apoptosis
and TAM resistance were identified, such as upregulation
of genes encoding v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog B (BRAF), caspase 9 (CASP9), and downregula-
tion of genes encoding B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2),
fibronectin 1 (FN1). Moreover, 4-OHT and BD combin-
ation showed maximal effects comparing with individual
treatment, which might be the reason of enhanced apop-
tosis. Upon closer inspection, we found several genes that
are regulated differently by BD versus 4-OHT. For ex-
ample, CDKN1A, which encoding cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 1A (p21), is upregulated by both BD and com-
bination, but not by 4-OHT.
We evaluated if 4-OHT and BD combination affects
expressions of genes, which involved in apoptosis and
TAM resistance, at the translation level as well. Consist-
ent with gene expression microarray data obtained at
the mRNA level after treatment of 6 days, induction of
BRAF, p21, and suppression of FN1, Bcl-2 in MCF-7
cells were detected by western blot analysis (Fig. 3a). Re-
sults of quantification indicated that expression of BRAF
is induced nearly 2.4 fold with BD, 1.8 fold with 4-OHT
and 2.8 fold with combination; expression of Bcl-2/
FN1is suppressed around 0.6 fold/0.7 fold with BD, 0.7
fold with 4-OHT and 0.4 fold with combination; expres-
sion of p21 is induced nearly 2.9 fold with BD and 2.7
fold with combination (Fig. 3b).
TAM and BD co-treatment inhibits growth of tumor
xenografts by induction of apoptosis
We have recently demonstrated that BD is not toxic in
vivo. An intragastric gavage of BD (100 mg/kg of body
weight for 4 weeks) did not affect body weight or activity
in liver enzymes and did not show any sign of toxicity in
liver, spleen, kidney, lung and heart tissues in mice [26].
To determine the effect of TAM and BD in vivo, the
growth of ER-positive human breast tumor xenografts was
monitored in ovariectomized nude mice subcutaneously

 injected with MCF-7 cells and treated with TAM, BD or
the combination of TAM and BD, as described in Mate-
rials and Methods. The control group (E2 alone) exhibited
rapid growth of MCF-7 tumors from day 7 and treatments
of BD or TAM resulted in the significant inhibition of
tumor growth when compared to control. In addition, the
combination of TAM and BD further enhanced inhibitory
effect of TAM on tumor growth (Fig. 4a). On day 29, the
average tumor volume ± SD in the combination group
(TAM and BD) was approximately 139 ± 121 mm3, which
was nearly 77% of inhibition compared with control
(~608 ± 489 mm3) (Fig. 4a). Although the treatment of
TAM or BD also significantly suppressed tumor volume
(TAM ~ 228 ± 216 mm3, BD ~ 232 ± 180 mm3), their com-
bination suppressed only slightly tumor volume on day 29
(TAM and BD ~139 ± 121 mm3) (Fig. 4b). In addition,
there were no significant differences in body weight
between control and treatment groups (data not shown).
Interestingly, mice in the combination group were more
relax, active and healthy than mice in the TAM group
(data not shown). In addition, average tumor weight in the
combination group (TAM and BD) (195 ± 141 mg) was
decreased by 67% when compared to the control group
(587 ± 469 mg) at the end of treatment period on day
29 (Fig. 4c).
To determine if TAM and BD combination inhibits
growth of ER-positive human breast tumor by enhancing
apoptosis in vivo, we quantified the amounts of apoptotic
bodies in tumor xenografts. As seen in Fig. 5a, more apop-
totic bodies were detected in the tumor tissues from TAM
and TAM and BD combination treated groups compared
with the control group. Although there was no statistical

 difference between TAM and control group, TAM and BD
combination showed maximal increase of apoptotic bodies
(64%) compared with control, indicating that suppression
of tumor growth can be attributed to the induction of
apoptosis in cancer cells (Fig. 2). Although the number of
apoptotic bodies in breast tumors is suggestive for the in-
duction of apoptosis it is necessary to confirm apoptosis
by other method, as is the expression of specific pro-
apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in tumors.
Effect of BD and TAM on the apoptotic and TAM resistant
proteins expression in tumors
To assess whether the mediated tumor growth inhibition
is associated with the expression of proteins involved in
apoptosis and TAM resistance, tumor tissues from TAM,
BD and TAM and BD combination treated mice were
subjected to immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 6,
TAM and BD combination markedly induced expressions
of BRAF and p21, whereas expression of pro- apoptotic
Bcl-2 protein was decreased compared to the vehicle-
treated control. Similar results were found in western
blot analysis of tumor tissues as well (data not shown).
These in vivo observations are in accordance with our
in vitro data, with MCF-7 cells treated with BD, 4-OHT
or the combination of BD and 4-OHT. However, the
expression of Fibronectin was not affected in the breast
cancer tumors.
Discussion
TAM has been a frontline treatment for both early and
advanced ER-positive breast cancer in pre- and post-
menopausal women [34–36]. A new therapeutic strategy
is focus on the combination with other agents that
increase efficacy and decrease toxicity of TAM. Here, we
evaluate the therapeutic potential of co-treatment of TAM
with BD, a natural dietary supplement, in ER-positive
human breast cancer. Our results indicate that the com-
bination of 4-OHT and BD or the combination of TAM

Fig. 6 Combination of TAM with BD regulates expression of apoptosis and TAM resistance related proteins in human breast tumors. Animal
experiments were performed as described in Fig. 3. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using
antibodies against BRAF, p21, Bcl-2 and Fibronectin (FN). Representative localization and intensity of immunoreactivities against all primary
antibodies are shown. Immunohistochemical quantification of BRAF, p21, Bcl-2 and FN were determined as described in Materials and Methods. Statistical

 and BD resulted in the suppression of cell and tumor
growth and induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo,
respectively. Microarray, western blot and immunohisto-
chemistry analyses further demonstrate that the combin-
ation treatment regulates expression of proteins involved
in the cancer growth and cell death. Importantly, TAM
and BD co-treatment
significantly suppresses tumor
growth in vivo.
The emergence of TAM resistance is almost inevitable,
which pose a major clinical problem. Mechanisms may
include changes in the expression or function of ER,
variation in ER-associated transcription factor recruit-
ment, altered expression of specific microRNAs, and
genetic polymorphisms involved in TAM metabolic ac-
tivity [37, 38]. Among of them, ER plays the major role
in driving resistance [39]. It has been shown that the
enhanced cell proliferation and reduced susceptibility
to cell death mediated by ER signaling are in part
through the regulation of p21, a key cell cycle break,
and Bcl-2, the major anti-apoptotic and pro-survival
protein [40, 41]. Recently, Raha et al. established de
novo and acquired TAM-resistant breast cancer models,
which exhibit reduced p21 and elevated Bcl-2 expres-
sion [37]. In clinical studies, loss of p21 is associated
with a TAM growth-inducing phenotype and increased
Bcl-2 expression is an important phenomenon in meta-
static TAM-resistant breast tumors [42, 43]. Our data
demonstrated that 4-OHT/TAM alone had no effect on
the expression of p21, but BD and/or combination with
4-OHT/TAM resulted in significant upregulation of
p21. Moreover, addition of BD to 4-OHT/TAM leads to
enhanced inhibition of Bcl-2. Altered expression of
these key proteins may attribute to quercetin, a bio-
flavonoid presented in BD, which inhibits proliferation
and induces apoptosis in ER-positive breast cancer cells
via upregulation of p21 and downregulation of Bcl-2
protein expression [44, 45]. In addition, Oh et al. dem-
onstrate
that
quercetin
suppresses
angiogenesis
in
TAM-resistant breast cancer through inhibition of Pin1
[46]. Therefore, BD may reverse TAM resistance by en-
hanced inhibition of Bcl-2 and significant induction of
p21, which driving cells into apoptosis. Although we
found positive effects in the inhibition of proliferation
and induction of apoptosis which was associated with
the altered gene expression in MCF-7 cells treated with
BD and 4-OH/TAM, these effects were determined in
only one ER-positive human breast cancer cells and
xenograft model. Therefore, it is possible to expect that
other ER-positive human breast cancer cells would also
respond to this treatment. Nevertheless, since each
cancer cell type has specific and unique genetic make-up,
it is plausible that other set of genes would be associated
with the anticancer activity of BD and 4-OH/TAM. We
have previously demonstrated that therapeutic activity of
BD itself was associated with the expression of genes
associated with proliferation and metastasis in highly
invasive human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and
in an animal model of breast-to-lung cancer metastasis
[24, 26]. Another crucial aspect in gene targeting is a
temporal gene expression. In our current study, we ana-
lyzed gene expression at 6 days because at this time point
we detected significant response of BD and 4-OH/TAM
in the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apop-
tosis in MCF-7 cells. Although it is important to evaluate
also other time points, in vivo data confirmed the original
cell culture data, increased expression of BRAF and p21
and decreased levels of Bcl-2 in tumors after the com-
bined treatment in mouse after 29 days. Indeed, a tem-
poral gene analysis and the use of other human breast
cancer cells is necessary for the evaluation of specific mo-
lecular targets of BD and their combinations with typical
breast cancer drugs. However, these analyses are behind
the scope of the present manuscript and will be performed
in future studies.
Hormonal therapy using TAM results in menopausal
symptoms and serious symptoms not only greatly decrease
the quality of life, but also may lead to discontinuation of
the treatment [47, 48]. Hence, non-prescription dietary
supplements are often used to relieve TAM-induced
side effects. 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM), another puri-
fied components in BD, is the major product of indole-
3-carbinol (I3C) in vivo and has promising activities
against ER-positive breast cancer [49]. Katchamart et al.
demonstrated a significant reduction in the N-oxygen-
ation of TAM catalyzed by liver microsomes in rats fed
with DIM, which may actually decrease the toxicity of
TAM. Based on the marked shift in the metabolic profiles
of TAM, they hypothesize that patients taking TAM in
concert with administration of DIM dietary supplements
could modulate the risk of developing toxic side effects if
there is a similar alteration in humans [50]. Ganoderma
lucidum, a medicinal mushroom in BD, has been used in
Asian countries to improve health and promote longevity
for centuries [15]. A pilot clinical trial suggests that spore
powder of G. lucidum may have beneficial effects on
cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in ER-positive
breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy [51].
In our present study, mice in the combination group ex-
hibit less fatigue and more energy comparing mice in the
TAM group. Definitely, more rigorous experiments are
needed to confirm the findings and clarify the specific
mechanisms behind them.
Conclusions
Our study is the first report describing the combination
effects of TAM and BD in ER-positive human breast
cancer. BD sensitizes breast cancer cells to 4-OHT/TAM
treatment in vitro and in vivo, promotes apoptosis,
Cheng et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (2017) 17:115

 interferes with multiple pathways important for TAM
resistance and has potential in decrease TAM-induced
side effects. Therefore, BD could decrease future TAM
resistance in the combination therapy in the originally
anti-estrogen responsive breast cancers. Thus, BD may
be recommended as novel adjuvant polybotanical prepar-
ation for patients with ER-positive breast cancer undergo-
ing conventional endocrine therapy. More ER-positive
breast cancer cell models will be employed in the further
study and clinical trials exploring efficiency of BD are re-
quired to support its use in breast cancer patients.
