Abstract
Purpose: The expanding number of targeted therapeutics for
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) necessitates real-time tumor
genotyping, yet tissue biopsies are difficult to perform serially and
often yield inadequate DNA for next-generation sequencing
(NGS). We evaluated the feasibility of using cell-free circulating
tumor DNA (ctDNA) NGS as a complement or alternative to
tissue NGS.
Experimental Design: A total of 112 plasma samples obtained
from a consecutive study of 102 prospectively enrolled patients
with advanced NSCLC were subjected to ultra-deep sequencing of
up to 70 genes and matched with tissue samples, when possible.
Results: We detected 275 alterations in 45 genes, and at least
one alteration in the ctDNA for 86 of 102 patients (84%), with
EGFR variants being most common. ctDNA NGS detected 50
driver and 12 resistance mutations, and mutations in 22 addi-
tional genes for which experimental therapies, including
clinical trials, are available. Although ctDNA NGS was com-
pleted for 102 consecutive patients, tissue sequencing was only
successful for 50 patients (49%). Actionable EGFR mutations
were detected in 24 tissue and 19 ctDNA samples, yielding
concordance of 79%, with a shorter time interval between
tissue and blood collection associated with increased concor-
dance (P ¼ 0.038). ctDNA sequencing identified eight patients
harboring a resistance mutation who developed progressive
disease while on targeted therapy, and for whom tissue
sequencing was not possible.
Conclusions: Therapeutically targetable driver and resistance
mutations can be detected by ctDNA NGS, even when tissue
is
unavailable,
thus
allowing
more
accurate
diagnosis,
improved
patient
management,

Introduction
Tumor genotyping to identify actionable oncogenic driver
mutations and mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapeutics
has become increasingly important in the management of cancers.
In non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), detection of activating
EGFR mutations, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusions
has expanded treatment options, and targeting these mutations
has improved progression-free survival in patients with metastatic
disease (1, 2). In addition, several other promising somatic
genomic targets are recommended in the National Comprehen-
sive Cancer Network (NCCN) NSCLC guidelines for existing
targeted therapies including ROS1 and RET fusions, MET exon
14 skipping, and ERBB2 and BRAF mutations (3), as well as
numerous other genetic alterations that are the focus of active
clinical trials (4).
EGFR mutations are some of the most common variants
detected in NSCLC, present in 10% to 40% of cases depending
on patient demographics and smoking status (5, 6), with ALK
rearrangements detected less frequently (1). The presence of a
sensitizing EGFR mutation usually indicates a high likelihood of
response to first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), but
most patients will develop resistance within 12 to 24 months of
treatment initiation (7–9). Mechanisms of primary and acquired
resistance to EGFR–TKI therapy have been identified including
amplifications in MET and ERBB2, deletions or point mutations

 in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, and loss or inactivation of
PTEN (10, 11). Multiple molecular resistance mechanisms to
ALK–TKIs have also been identified (9). The accurate identifica-
tion of such tumor molecular evolution has important clinical
implications as second- and third-generation TKIs are now avail-
able for tumors harboring certain EGFR and ALK resistance
mutations (12, 13).
Tumor tissue has been the preferred source for mutational
analysis, and the NCCN guidelines now recommend repeat
tissue biopsies to identify resistance mechanisms in patients
whose cancers progress on first-line targeted therapeutics (14).
However, tissue specimens may prove inadequate for testing in
a significant proportion of cases. In addition, a small needle
biopsy of a single lesion may fail to reflect the true underlying
intra- and intertumor genetic heterogeneity (15–17). As a
result, a noninvasive approach to accurately detect actionable
driver and resistance mechanisms offers significant clinical
utility.
There is growing interest in utilizing circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) for the noninvasive molecular profiling of tumors.
ctDNA consists of short double-stranded DNA fragments shed
into the bloodstream by tumor cells undergoing apoptosis or
necrosis (18, 19). ctDNA can be readily detected in patients
with advanced NSCLC, and several studies have shown that
highly sensitive genotyping assays can detect mutations in
ctDNA (20–26). Digital PCR assays have been developed with
high sensitivity and specificity for detection of variants in
ctDNA (24, 27); however, these approaches are typically lim-
ited to hotspot mutations in a few genes, and cannot interro-
gate the full spectrum of mutations that may emerge in the
setting of acquired resistance during targeted therapy (28).
Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of ctDNA offers
the ability to profile a much broader scope of genetic alterations
on a single platform.
In this study, massively parallel digital sequencing of NSCLC
patient plasma ctDNA was performed in a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, College of Amer-
ican Pathology (CAP)-accredited laboratory (29, 30). The test
detects single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in up to 70 genes,
fusions in six genes, and insertion/deletions (indels) in three
genes. We assessed the feasibility of using ctDNA NGS to
identify actionable mutations in a cohort of patients with
NSCLC, including those for whom tissue sequencing could
not be conducted. We also evaluated the concordance in
genomic alterations and the ability to detect clinically action-
able mutations between commercially available NGS gene
panels in paired tumor tissue biopsies and ctDNA.
Materials and Methods
Patients
This single-center, observational study was conducted at the
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania between February
2015 and March 2016, enrolling a consecutive blood sample of
102 prospectively enrolled subjects. This included both new
patients referred to our institution and existing patients. The
clinical indications and inclusion criteria for this study were that
the patient must have a diagnosis of NSCLC or suspected NSCLC
(by pathology) seen in our Thoracic Oncology Group, and had
blood samples sent for ctDNA NGS as part of their routine clinical
care. This study did not require a specific course of treatment.
Because our primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of the
ctDNA test for detecting actionable mutations, consecutive
patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were enrolled, with
a target sample size of 100 patients. Blood draws for commercial
ctDNA NGS were ordered as clinically indicated by the primary
oncologist. Clinical variables and results from solid tumor
sequencing were determined by chart review. The study was
approved by the University of Pennsylvania Internal Review
Board (IRB).
Blood samples and circulating tumor DNA isolation and
sequencing
Blood was collected in two 10-mL Streck tubes (Streck) and
shipped overnight at ambient temperature to Guardant Health
Inc., a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory facility. Cell-free
DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from plasma, and the amount
of cfDNA in the sample cohort was quantified using electropho-
retic separation in a massively parallel capillary array system
allowing for postextraction high-throughput, high-resolution
fragment size–specific data acquisition for each sample processed.
The cfDNA was then analyzed by paired-end sequencing by
synthesis utilizing an Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 platform and
hg19 as the reference genome as described previously (29). Digital
sequences were reconstructed using Guardant Health's proprie-
tary bioinformatics algorithms, allowing the detection of one to
two mutant fragments in 10 mL of blood with an analytic
specificity greater than 99.9999%. The detection of somatic altera-
tions in cfDNA was used to confirm the presence of ctDNA.
Clinically significant somatic alterations were distinguished from
germline polymorphisms by referencing multiple SNP databases
and by their annotation in COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer; http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic). Single
nucleotide variants, indels, and fusions were quantitatively
reported as the allelic fraction (AF), calculated as the total number
of molecules with a given mutation divided by the totalnumber of
mutant plus wild-type molecules (29).
The current 70-gene Guardant360 panel (Supplementary
Table S1) includes complete exons for 30 genes and critical
Translational Relevance
This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting next-
generation sequencing of a comprehensive gene panel for
managing patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Detection of driver and resistance mutations has
never been more clinically important as the number of useful
targeted agents continues to grow. Analyzable tissue samples
are often difficult or impossible to obtain for this patient
cohort, and serial biopsies are rarely possible. Here we dem-
onstrate the use of a 70-gene cell-free circulating tumor DNA
next-generation sequencing panel for the detection of clini-
cally actionable variants in a study of 102 prospectively
enrolled patients with lung cancer. Matched tissue sequencing
was successful for fewer than half the patients, mainly as a
result of inaccessible tumor tissue or insufficient DNA for
sequencing. These data demonstrate the feasibility and clinical
utility of plasma-based liquid biopsy for personalized therapy
of patients with advanced NSCLC.

 exons (those reported as having a somatic mutation in
COSMIC) of 40 additional genes resulting in a 146,000-bp
(146 KB) target region. The platform detects fusions in six
genes, and multiple indels in three genes. The average coverage
depth was 10,000�. During this study, the Guardant platform
expanded from a 68- to a 70-gene panel. This expansion added
ERBB2 and MET indels, full exon coverage of RB1, and critical
exon coverage of TSC1. Samples from 36 patients were
sequenced on the 68-gene panel and samples from the remain-
ing 66 patients on the 70-gene panel.
Tumor tissue DNA sequencing
All tissue samples were processed at the CAP/CLIA-certified
University of Pennsylvania Center for Personalized Diagnos-
tics clinical laboratory. Thirty-eight patient samples were pro-
cessed using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon – Cancer Panel
(TSACP, FC-130-1008; Illumina) to sequence hotspots or
exonic regions for 47 genes, as described recently (31, 32).
For the remaining 12 patients, the DNA extracted from sub-
mitted tissue was of insufficient quantity for the full 47-gene
panel; these samples were assessed using the Penn Precision
Panel for mutations in a smaller panel of 20 commonly
mutated genes (Supplementary Table S2). Genes covered on
the ctDNA panel but not the tissue panel or vice versa are
noted in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Libraries were
prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument,
and always included a no-template negative control. A clin-
ically validated bioinformatics pipeline was used for tumor
DNA (tDNA) sequencing analysis (33), with reads mapped to
the hg19 genome build. The level of detection (LOD) for the
tissue NGS panel is 4.0%.
Statistical analysis and concordance analysis of ctDNA and
tDNA
Tissue- and plasma-based platforms were compared using
the Integrative Genome Viewer (https://www.broadinstitute.
org/igv/) and variants covered and reported by both platforms
were included in the concordance analysis. Although tissue
testing was intended for all 102 patients, it was only successful
for 50 (Fig. 1); post hoc calculations indicate that 50 paired
samples provide precision for estimation of a 95% confidence
interval around concordance with a maximum width of
approximately 0.3. For patients with matched tDNA and
ctDNA, we defined a concordant result as detection of the same
variant in each sample, or in neither sample. The percent
concordance was calculated for each patient and then averaged
over the matched tissue cohort (n ¼ 50) to determine overall
concordance. To test whether concordance varied by elapsed
time between tissue biopsy and blood draw, we applied the
nonparametric trend test. We used paired t tests to compare AF
with each assay. We used independent-group t tests to compare
the number of variants and the concentration of cfDNA mea-
sured for patients who survived and did not. All t test results
were confirmed with their nonparametric equivalents. Overall
survival was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and
with Cox proportional hazards models. We evaluated the
association of number of variants (categorized as <3 or �3
mutations) and cfDNA concentration (amount of cfDNA in
ng/mL), with overall survival using the log-rank test. All signif-
icance tests were two-sided. Statistical analysis was conducted
using Stata v 14 (StataCorp).
Results
Patient characteristics and study design
Digital ctDNA sequencing was performed for 112 samples
obtained from 102 total patients, including 100 patients with
advanced NSCLC plus two patients (patients 37 and 51) with
cancer of unknown primary who were treated at the University of
Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center between February 2015
and March 2016 (Table 1). Most were women (68%) with
adenocarcinoma (81%) and stage IV disease (96%). Only 4% of
patients had a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) as
compared with 15% to 20% in the overall lung cancer population
(4, 34), likely due to the anticipated low frequency of actionable
molecular abnormalities in SqCC, and also a competing SqCC
trial at our institution at the time of this study. The female
preponderance and significant proportion of never-smokers is
likely a reflection of providers sending plasma samples for ctDNA
analysis in a patient population most likely to harbor targetable
mutations. In fact, the most common reason for ordering the
ctDNA test was for initial detection of targetable mutations for 52
patients who either had no previous therapy (n ¼ 27), chemo-
therapy (n ¼ 18), or chemotherapy and immunotherapy (n ¼ 7).
One patient who received chemotherapy also received erlotinib as
second-line therapy according to the FDA label for unselected
patients in whom EGFR mutation status had not been previously
determined. Other reasons for ordering the ctDNA test included:
detection of resistance mutations to targeted therapy (36
patients), identification of actionable mutations in patients with
progressive disease (12 patients), and tracking a mutation iden-
tified in tDNA to monitor response to therapy (two patients).
Although ctDNA analysis was successfully completed for all 112
samples obtained from 102 consecutively enrolled patients, tissue
NGS could only be completed for 50 (49.0%) patients. Of the 52
patients with only ctDNA results, a tissue biopsy was either
unobtainable, or yielded DNA of insufficient quantity or quality
for 45 (86.5%) of 52 patients. (Fig. 1). Thus, for more than half
our patients, ctDNA sequencing was the only option for detection
of therapeutically targetable variants.
Therapeutically targetable driver and resistance mutations
detected in ctDNA
In total, 275 variants were detected in the ctDNA of 86
(84.3%) of 102 patients, including SNVs, indels, and fusions.
Sufficient input cfDNA was obtained and sequenced but no
somatic variants, and thus no ctDNA, detected for 16 patients.
Variants were detected in 45 genes with EGFR mutations the
most prevalent at 20% of total variants (Fig. 2; Supplementary
Table S3). Among the driver mutations with FDA-approved
therapies, and as previously reported (35), EGFR Exon 19
deletions were more frequently reported than L858R muta-
tions, in 16 (15.7%) and 10 (9.8%) patients, respectively
(Supplementary
Table
S4).
Ten
ERBB2
mutations
were
detected, including 5 exon 20 insertions shown to confer
sensitivity to ERBB2-targeted therapies (36). The EML4–ALK
fusion, which confers sensitivity to the ALK TKI crizotinib (1),
was detected in two samples.
The EGFR T790M resistance mutation was identified in the
ctDNA of 10 (31%) of 32 patients receiving EGFR–TKI therapy,
but the less common secondary resistance mutations EGFR
D761Y, T854A, and L747S (37) were not detected in any
samples. The original EGFR-activating mutation was detected in
all 10 ctDNA samples harboring a T790M mutation. Objective

 samples. An ALK G1202R resistance mutation (9) was coex-
pressed with EML4–ALK for one patient whose cancer had pro-
gressed while receiving an ALK TKI. ROS1 or RET rearrangements
were not detected. Eleven KRAS mutations were detected, includ-
ing the G12C, G12D, and G12H variants shown to be associated
with primary resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer (38).
Consistent with prior reports, we found no coexpression of EGFR
and KRAS mutations in any plasma samples (23, 39).
To further understand the potential clinical actionability of
ctDNA NGS, all detected variants were cross-referenced against
available FDA-approved, off-label, or investigational therapies.
The majority of patients (70%) were determined to have a
relevant clinical trial available, 56 (55%) patients had an off-
label targeted therapy that could potentially be used, and 32
(31%) patients had an FDA-approved therapy available to
target the detected variant. The mutations associated with
available trials and therapies are detailed in Supplementary
Table S5. Taken together, these data suggest that ctDNA analysis
for NSCLC patients can yield results with high clinical rele-
vance, including detection of therapeutically targetable muta-
tions in EGFR, ALK, and other genes.
Comparison of tissue and plasma results
We next compared variant calls for the 50 patients who had
both tDNA and ctDNA NGS performed. Of the 50 patients with
matched tissue and plasma samples, 39 (78%) patients had �1
alteration in tDNA, and 42 (84%) patients had �1 mutation
detected in ctDNA. Not surprisingly given the broader coverage
of the ctDNA versus the tDNA panels (Supplementary Tables S1
and S2) the mean number of variants detected per patient by
ctDNA was 2.8, compared with 1.5 using tDNA. When only the
variants covered by both panels were considered, the difference
narrowed to 55 and 67 variants, respectively, whereas 41
mutations were detected by both (Fig. 3A). The overall con-
cordance for all variants covered and detected by both plat-
forms was 60%. When wild-type calls, that is, genes for
which no variants were detected, are considered, the overall

may be more dilute in the blood than tissue, there was a
significant difference between the AF of variants detected in
tDNA versus ctDNA for the 50 patients with matched tissue and
ctDNA (tDNA mean AF 30.6% vs. 6.2% for ctDNA; P <

tissue shown in Supplementary Table S6). For the 14 variants
detected in ctDNA but not tDNA, all 14 (100%) had an AF
below this 4.0% cutoff. Although overall concordance between
ctDNA and tDNA was higher when tDNA was obtained for
metastatic (79%) versus primary tumor tissue (51%), this
difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.063; Fig. 3C).
Among the 50 patients with matched tDNA and ctDNA, 24
therapeutically targetable driver EGFR mutations were detected
in tDNA and 19 in ctDNA samples, yielding an overall con-
cordance of 79%. The EGFR T790M resistance mutation was
identified in 4 (8%) tDNA samples and 8 (16%) ctDNA
samples. Given the time interval between tissue and blood
collection for our patients ranged from 0 days to >2 years, we
next sought to understand whether tumor genetic evolution
over time and under pressure of therapy might lead to a
decrease in concordance when the time interval between plas-
ma and tissue collection increased. To address this, we calcu-
lated the concordance between EGFR variants detected in tDNA
and ctDNA for time intervals of �2 weeks, �2, �6, and >6
months and found the concordance rates (100%, 92%, 94%,
and 60%, respectively) to be significantly correlated with time
between tissue biopsy and blood draw (P ¼ 0.038; Fig. 3D).
There was no significant difference between the concordance
for the 15 patients who received no treatment between ctDNA
and tissue testing (76.7% concordance) and those (n ¼ 35) who
received any treatment (52.4% concordance; P ¼ 0.11). This
could be due to the wide variety of therapies patients received
including chemotherapy (n ¼ 19), immunotherapy (n ¼ 6),
targeted therapy (n ¼ 23), and nine patients who received two
or more types of therapy.
Among the eight patients with discordant EGFR T790M calls
(Supplementary Table S7), one patient No. 23) had undergone
tDNA and ctDNA testing 18 days apart, with the driver EGFR
L858R mutation detected in both samples but T790M detected
at a lower frequency in the tDNA but not the ctDNA. Upon
review, it was determined that the total cfDNA yield was one of
the lowest among our patients [14.5 ng vs. a median of 32.1 ng
(range 6–390 ng); Supplementary Fig. S1], and the LOD for
EGFR variants was therefore set at 0.2% rather than 0.1%.
Because the L858R mutation was detected at 0.3% AF in the
ctDNA, and EGFR resistance mutations are typically seen at
a lower frequency in the blood compared with the originally
detected EGFR driver mutations (24), it is possible that
the T790M resistance mutation was present but below the LOD
in the plasma. For patient No. 30, for whom EGFR T790M was
detected in the tissue but not the plasma, 7 months had elapsed
between the two tests, and the patient had received afatinib
during that time. It is well established that ctDNA levels may
drop while on TKI therapy even with partial response (40). For
the six patients for whom EGFR T790M was detected in the
plasma but not the tumor, the ctDNA AF was well below the
4.0% LOD for the tissue NGS panel, and five of the patients had
received an EGFR-targeting therapy between tests, thus provid-
ing a possible explanation for the emergence of the T790M
resistance mutation. The sixth patient, No. 15, in whom the
variant was detected in plasma but not tDNA, received no
EGFR-targeted therapy during the 7 days that elapsed between
ctDNA and tDNA testing. Imaging in this patient showed
multiple metastatic sites. If the T790M mutation had been
present only in some metastases, but not the site that was
biopsied, this tumor heterogeneity might provide an explana-
tion for the discordant result.
Prognostic implications of molecular heterogeneity in ctDNA
Although the main objective of this study was to determine the
feasibility of ctDNA for detection of therapeutically targetable
variants, others have shown that plasma-based testing can be used
to predict patient outcome (22, 25, 41) and that ctDNA levels are
associated with disease stage (23). Because molecular heteroge-
neity has also been associated with poor patient outcome
(42, 43), we next sought to assess the prognostic significance of
ctDNA molecular heterogeneity. For the 98 patients with meta-
static disease, the median overall survival from time of metastatic
diagnosis in patients with �3 variants detected in plasma was 46
months versus 62 months for those with <3 variants, although this
result did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ 0.09; Fig. 4A).
Consistent with another recent report (30), we also found cfDNA
level was associated with poor patient outcomes. The mean
concentration of total cfDNA extracted from plasma was signif-
icantly higher in patients who died during the study period versus
alive patients (4.0 vs. 1.6 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Higher cfDNA
concentrations were significantly associated with decreased over-
all survival from time of metastatic diagnosis, and a cfDNA
concentration �3 ng/mL was associated with a median overall
survival of 24 months versus 46 months (log-rank. P < 0.01;
Fig. 4B). This result remained significant when adjusted for age,
performance status, EGFR mutation status, and the number of
metastatic sites.
Real-time serial molecular monitoring of patients
on therapy
As a noninvasive test, ctDNA NGS can be performed more
frequently than tissue NGS, and thus offers the possibility of serial
testing for molecular monitoring of disease. Although this was not
a primary objective of our study, serial ctDNA testing was per-
formed on six patients as part of disease surveillance. For three
of these patients, ctDNA testing did not reveal therapeutically
targetable mutations, but could still be used to guide clinical
decision-making. Patient No. 6 had newly diagnosed metastatic
NSCLC. Initial tissue testing yielded insufficient DNA, therefore
ctDNA was performed twice for initial mutation screening but no
variants were detected, and the patient was put on chemo-
therapy. Subsequent tissue NGS confirmed the lack of detectable
somatic variants. Patients No. 2 and No. 24 had metastatic EGFR
mutation–positive NSCLC exhibiting progressive disease on an
EGFR TKI. ctDNA analysis was performed at two timepoints
for each patient to detect an EGFR resistance mutation as an
indication to switch to a third-line TKI. However, no EGFR T790M
mutation was detected for either timepoint or patient, so a third-
line TKI was not prescribed.
In addition, we describe three patients for whom ctDNA did
detect the emergence of therapeutically targetable variants over
the course of therapy.

 Patient No. 72 (Fig. 5A) presented with metastatic disease at
diagnosis with tissue biopsy detecting no variants in EGFR,
ALK, or ROS1. Upon referral to our hospital, ctDNA testing
revealed an EML4–ALK fusion (0.4% AF) and a TP53 variant
(0.8% AF), and the patient was initiated on crizotinib mono-
therapy with significant improvement in symptoms. Two
months after therapy, a repeat ctDNA test showed a decrease
in the EML4-ALK AF to 0.1%, and the TP53 mutation was
undetectable. A CT scan performed the same day demonstrated
a decrease in size of the primary lung lesion as well as the liver
metastatic disease.
Patient No. 82 (Fig. 5B) developed progressive disease
while receiving erlotinib with tumor sequencing at the time
of progression showing the EGFR G719A mutation (79% AF)
but without a resistance mutation identified. Erlotinib was
discontinued. A PET CT after 3 months of nivolumab (month
0 in Fig. 5B) revealed further disease progression, and ctDNA
analysis performed at that time confirmed EGFR G719A
(24.1% AF), and also detected the emergence of a T790M
mutation (0.5% AF). Afatanib was initiated, and repeat ctDNA
testing 2 months later showed a decrease in the AF of EGFR
G719A to 0.4% and EGFR T790M to 0.4%, which correlated
with imaging response. ctDNA performed 2 months later
showed an increase in AF of EGFR G719A and EGFR
T790M to 3.7% and 0.6%, respectively. This was associated
with mild progression on PET CT, and afatinib was continued.
ctDNA analysis 2 months later showed a further increase in the
AF of EGFR G719A to 23.7% and EGFR T790M to 18.1% with
clear progression on PET CT, and the patient was placed on
osimertinib based on the EGFR T790M mutation detected
only in blood. Interval imaging to monitor response to ther-
apy had not yet been performed upon the submission of this
manuscript.
Patient No. 15 (Fig. 5C) developed progressive disease soon
after discontinuation of erlotinib due to toxicity. Tissue sam-
pling revealed the EGFR L858R (16.5% AF) and TP53 D281N
(15.8% AF), but no evidence of T790M mutation. ctDNA
sequencing performed 7 days later identified EGFR L858R
(1.4% AF), TP53 D281N (1.9% AF), and the emergence of
EGFR T790M (0.2% AF). Afatinib was initiated and surveil-
lance CT scan performed 2 months later showed a partial
response. However, simultaneous ctDNA analysis noted a
rising AF for all three variants: EGFR L858R 17.9%, EGFR
T790M 5.7%, and TP53 D281N 31.4%. A CT scan 3 months
later confirmed disease progression with simultaneous ctDNA
sequencing showing a continued rise in AF for all three muta-
tions: EGFR L858R 25.3%, EGFR T790M 10.4%, TP53 D281N
35.6%. Osimertinib was prescribed on the basis of the EGFR
T790M mutant detected only in the blood. A 2-month follow-
up CT scan exhibited an interval response to therapy, and a
simultaneous ctDNA test revealed that all three variants were
now undetectable in the patient's plasma.
Discussion
Here we present evidence for the feasibility and clinical utility
of liquid biopsies for the management of advanced NSCLC
patients. The ever-expanding number of targeted therapies avail-
able for lung cancer patient treatment has been accompanied by
a need for companion diagnostics for real-time detection of
therapeutically targetable genetic lesions (44, 45). Treatment
with first-line TKIs is facilitated by the identification at diagnosis
of mutations such as EGFR L858R or exon 19 deletions, and can
often be achieved through tissue biopsy. However, monitoring
response to targeted therapy by assaying changes in the frequen-
cy of the targeted mutation, or identifying resistance mutations
cannot be consistently achieved through repeat biopsy. Plasma-
based ctDNA testing is a noninvasive means of patient moni-
toring and thus offers the advantage of testing without the risks
associated with invasive biopsies. When applied to the blood of
NSCLC patients, liquid biopsies can identify resistance muta-
tions that allow for the treatment of patients with second- and
third-line TKIs, or cytotoxic chemotherapy when no targetable
mutation is identified.

 In this prospective study, we have shown the successful NGS
of 102 consecutively obtained plasma samples from patients
with lung cancer. The minimum input DNA (�5 ng) was
successfully extracted from all samples and libraries prepared.
No mutations were detected in the cfDNA for 16 of 102
patients, suggesting the tumor was not actively shedding
ctDNA, the patient's disease was adequately controlled by
therapy, or plasma-based somatic variants were either not
covered by the 70-gene panel or below the 0.01% LOD for
the assay. In contrast, a tissue biopsy with sufficient quality and
quantity of DNA for NGS was unobtainable or not obtained for
52 of 102 patients (51%). Similar to other reports for tissue

 NGS (46), quantity of tDNA was not sufficient for 24 of 52
(46.2%) patients. Thus, for more than half of our patients, a
liquid biopsy was the only means of molecular monitoring.
While circulating tumor cells (CTC) are considered a form of
liquid biopsy, and we (31) and others (47) have reported on
the approaches for molecular analysis of CTCs, NSCLC patient
CTCs cannot always be reliably identified (44, 48, 49). More-
over, ctDNA is readily detectable in the blood of a patient with
lung cancer (20, 27, 29, 30), and sensitivity of variant detection
was recently shown to be higher in ctDNA than CTCs (25).
Thus, ctDNA testing is well-suited for NSCLC patient molecular
monitoring.
Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has been proposed as another
means of liquid biopsy, and others have reported on the
detection of driver and resistance mutations in a limited
number of genes for NSCLC (23, 24) and other cancers
(27, 50). Although the results we have reported are based on
a panel of up to 70 clinically relevant genes, including 30 with
full exon coverage, ddPCR is typically used to detect hotspots in
3 to 5 genes. The EGFR T790M mutation accounts for more
than 50% of cases of acquired resistance to EGFR–TKI therapy
and would certainly be detected by many current ddPCR plat-
forms (35). As the number of molecular mechanisms of resis-
tance and associated approved therapies increases, however,
NGS may emerge as the more clinically useful assay for iden-
tification of actionable targets. Digital sequencing of a large
panel of genes (in this case 70) allows for detection of a large
number of variants to aid clinical decision-making including:
EGFR and ALK variants for first-line therapy; mutations in
EGFR, ALK, BRAF, PIK3CA, and other genes associated with
resistance to EGFR or ALK TKIs; KRAS variants associated with
primary resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy; and variants in
other genes that may lead to the off-label use of FDA-approved
therapies or enrollment to clinical trials of new therapeutic
agents (see Supplementary Table S5). This approach may also
facilitate the discovery of previously unreported resistance
mutations and the emergence of low-frequency subclones
under pressure of therapy, which would have been undetect-
able in primary tumor tissue. Moreover, liquid biopsy may
detect mutations that were either not present or undetectable in
primary tissue or initial biopsy.
To our knowledge, this prospective study is the first of its
kind to apply a comprehensive clinical NGS panel to ctDNA
and matched tumor biopsies in patients with advanced lung
cancer, and demonstrate the feasibility and utility of plasma
testing for a large subset of patients in whom matched tissue
sequencing was not feasible. The logical extension of this work
is to evaluate the test's utility at diagnosis as a complement to
tissue testing, and in the context of genetically heterogeneous
metastatic disease. Here we reported on serial ctDNA testing
for six patients, but larger-scale studies will be required to
further evaluate ctDNA monitoring for treatment selection,
including patients for whom no therapeutically targetable
mutations are detected who may be candidates for checkpoint
inhibitors (34). Although ctDNA testing alone will be insuf-
ficient to detect histologic sources of therapy resistance, such
as a small-cell phenotype, a liquid biopsy may complement
histologic analysis by providing additional tumor molecular
characterization. It may also be important to explore the
clinical actionability of our finding that higher levels of
cell-free DNA, irrespective of mutational profile, are associat-
ed with decreased survival. All the patients in our study either
had active metastatic disease or had scans suspicious for
progression; determining the feasibility of ctDNA-based dis-
ease monitoring in the context of minimal residual or early-
stage disease would broaden clinical utility. Adapting our
approach to achieve the sensitivity and specificity necessary
for nodule-positive patients at higher risk for the development
of cancer, perhaps in conjunction with imaging, could greatly
enhance early detection of tumors with a greater chance of
achieving curative resection. In summary, this work demon-
strates the promise of ctDNA testing for real-time molecular
monitoring of patients with advanced lung cancer and other
malignancies in clinical practice, and underscores the need for
additional studies to further assess the biological evolution of
metastatic disease and clinical utility of molecular noninva-
sive profiling.
