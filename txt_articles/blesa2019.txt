Abstract 
Preterm infants are at increased risk of alterations in brain structure and connectivity, and 
subsequent neurocognitive impairment. Breast milk may be more advantageous than 
formula feed for promoting brain development in infants born at term, but uncertainties 
remain about its effect on preterm brain development and the optimal nutritional regimen 
for preterm infants. We test the hypothesis that breast milk exposure is associated with 
improved markers of brain development and connectivity in preterm infants at term 
equivalent age.  
We collected information about neonatal breast milk exposure and brain MRI at term 
equivalent age from 47 preterm infants (mean postmenstrual age [PMA] 29.43 weeks, range 
23.28-33.0). Network-Based Statistics (NBS), Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and 
volumetric analysis were used to investigate the effect of breast milk exposure on white 
matter water diffusion parameters, tissue volumes, and the structural connectome.  
Twenty-seven infants received exclusive breast milk feeds for ≥ 75% of days of in-patient 
care and this was associated with higher connectivity in the fractional anisotropy (FA)-
weighted connectome compared with the group who had < 75% of days receiving exclusive 
breast milk feeds (NBS, p=0.04). Within the TBSS white matter skeleton, the group that 
received ≥ 75% exclusive breast milk days exhibited higher FA within the corpus callosum, 
cingulum cingulate gyri, centrum semiovale, corticospinal tracts, arcuate fasciculi and 
posterior limbs of the internal capsule compared with the low exposure group after 
adjustment for PMA at birth, PMA at image acquisition, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and 
chorioamnionitis (p < 0.05). The effect on structural connectivity and tract water diffusion 
parameters was greater with ≥ 90% exposure, suggesting a dose effect. There were no 
significant groupwise differences in brain volumes.  
Breast milk feeding in the weeks after preterm birth is associated with improved structural 
connectivity of developing networks and greater FA in major white matter fasciculi.

1. Introduction 
 
Preterm birth is strongly associated with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotype 
that includes altered structural connectivity of developing neural systems involving white 
matter, structural alteration in deep and cortical grey matter, and long term neurocognitive 
impairment (Batalle et al., 2017; Boardman et al., 2010; Counsell et al., 2008; van den 
Heuvel et al., 2015a; van Kooij et al., 2012). Co-morbidities of preterm birth, genetic factors, 
and environmental exposures contribute to white matter disease but they do not explain 
fully the risks for atypical brain development and adverse outcome (Anblagan et al., 2016; 
Ball et al., 2017; Ball et al., 2010; Boardman et al., 2014; Inder et al., 2005; Krishnan et al., 
2017). 
Nutritional factors may play an important role in preterm brain development. For example, 
optimal protein and energy intakes in the first days after preterm birth are associated with 
increased brain growth, improved white matter microstructure and neurodevelopmental 
performance (Beauport et al., 2017; Coviello et al., 2017; Morgan et al., 2014; Schneider et 
al., 2018).  
Breastfeeding, when compared with formula feeding, is associated with increased 
performance in intelligence testing among the general population, and the effect may be 
enhanced in low birthweight infants (Anderson et al., 1999; Isaacs et al., 2010; Lucas et al., 
1998; Vohr et al., 2007; Vohr et al., 2006). In a recent meta-analysis of studies that 
controlled for maternal intelligence, which is a recognised confounder of childhood 
cognition, breast feeding remained associated with a gain in performance in IQ testing 
(Horta et al., 2015). Furthermore, breast milk appears to have lasting impact on cognition 
with improved performance at school, during adolescence and through to adulthood 
(Belfort et al., 2016; Horwood and Fergusson, 1998). MRI studies of children and 
adolescents report that breast milk feed in infancy is associated with increased white and 
grey matter volumes (Isaacs et al., 2010; Luby et al., 2016), increased cortical thickness 
(Kafouri et al., 2013) and improved white matter microstructure (Deoni et al., 2013) when 
compared with formula feeding. However, the extent to which observations from the 
general population can be extrapolated to preterm infants is unknown, and this leaves 
uncertainty about the effect of breast milk on preterm brain development, and the timing, 
dose and duration of breast milk that might confer benefit.

We combined nutritional data with brain MRI to test the hypothesis that exposure to breast 
milk enhances early brain development in preterm infants. We investigated the influence of 
breast milk intake during neonatal care on a comprehensive set of measures of brain 
development that are based on the MRI phenotype of preterm brain injury (Batalle et al., 
2017; Counsell et al., 2008; Inder et al., 2005; van den Heuvel et al., 2015b). We combined 
structural and diffusion MRI (sMRI/dMRI) to perform anatomically-constrained tractography 
(ACT) (Smith et al., 2012) with spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms 
(SIFT) (Smith et al., 2013) to construct the structural connectome, and compared 
connectomes using global network measures and edge-wise values using Network-based 
Statistics (NBS). We used Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to calculate voxel wise 
differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial (RD) diffusivity 
across the white matter skeleton, and used optimized algorithms for brain extraction and 
tissue classification to measure global and local brain tissue volumes (Ball et al., 2010; Serag 
et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2006). 
 
2. Subjects and Methods 
 
2.1 Participants 
Participants were preterm infants delivered at ≤ 33.0 weeks who received care at the Royal 
Infirmary of Edinburgh and had brain MRI performed at term-equivalent age as part of a 
longitudinal study designed to investigate the effects of preterm birth on brain structure 
and outcome. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and ethical approval was obtained from the UK National Research Ethics Service. 
Parents provided written informed consent.  
Daily nutritional intake was collected from birth until discharge home from the neonatal unit 
using electronic patient records. Breast milk exposure was defined as the proportion of in-
patient days receiving exclusive breast milk, categorized as ≥ 75% and ≥ 90% of days of in-
patient care when exclusive breast milk was given. 
The nutritional management of all participants conformed to following principles. Infants 
with birth weight < 1500 g began parenteral nutrition upon admission to neonatal care. This 
was delivered using a standard solution (Scottish Neonatal Parenteral Nutrition 2.4 g 
protein/100 ml, ITH Pharma, London), commencing at 100 ml/kg/day if birth weight < 1000 
 MANUSCRIPT

g and 75 ml/kg/day if birthweight 1000-1500 g. This was increased to a maximum of 150 
ml/kg/day in 25 ml/kg/day increments every 24 hours. Fat and fat-soluble vitamins were 
provided using Intralipid 20% emulsion, which was commenced within 24 hours of 
admission at 1 g/kg/day, increasing to 2 g/kg/day on day 2 and 3 g/kg/day on day 3.  
Expression of breast milk was encouraged immediately after delivery and colostrum was 
given as soon as it became available. Enteral feeds were commenced at 12 ml/kg/day on 
day one and incremented by 30 ml/kg/day as standard. This increment was reduced to 18 
ml/kg/day in babies identified as at high risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis (< 1000 
g, IUGR, absent or reversed umbilical artery end diastolic flow doppler). If there was 
insufficient maternal expressed breast milk by 48 hours of age, donor expressed breast milk 
was given to supplement maternal milk. Once infants had reached 120 ml/kg/day of enteral 
feeds, parenteral nutrition was stopped. Feeds continued to increment to a maximum 
volume of 180-200 ml/kg/day. Human milk fortifier (Cow & Gate Nutriprem Human Milk 
Fortifier, Nutricia) was added to breast milk if weight gain remained sub-optimal despite 14 
days of maximal volume breast milk (180-200 ml/kg/day). If mothers chose not to express 
milk or there was insufficient breast milk to meet the requirements of the infant beyond 34 
weeks, donor expressed breast milk was replaced with preterm formula. All infants received 
multivitamins from day 7 of life and iron supplementation from day 42.  
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was defined as the requirement for supplemental 
oxygen at 36 weeks corrected gestational age. All infants had placental histopathology 
performed and histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) was defined using an established system 
(Anblagan et al., 2016). Postnatal somatic growth was described as the difference between 
birthweight z-score and weight at scan z-score, calculated using INTERGROWTH-21st 
reference standards for preterm infants (Villar et al., 2016). 
 
2.2 Image acquisition 
Infants were scanned in natural sleep with pulse oximetry, electrocardiography and 
temperature monitoring. Flexible earplugs and neonatal earmuffs (MiniMuffs, Natus) were 
used for ear protection. All scans were supervised by a neonatal doctor.  
A Siemens MAGNETOM Verio 3T MRI clinical scanner (Siemens Healthcare Gmbh, Erlangen, 
Germany) and 12-channel Siemens phased-array head matrix coil were used to acquire the 
following scans: 3D T1-weighted (T1w) MPRAGE (TR = 1650 ms, TE = 2.43 ms, inversion time

= 160 ms, flip angle = 9°, acquisition plane = sagittal, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3, FOV = 256 
mm, acquired matrix = 256 × 256, acquisition time = 7 min 49 s and acceleration factor = 2); 
dMRI data consisting of 11 T2- and 64 diffusion-weighted (b = 750 s/mm2) single-shot, spin-
echo, echo planar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired in the axial plane with 2 mm 
isotropic voxels (TR = 7300 ms, TE = 106 ms, FOV = 256 mm, acquired matrix = 128 × 128, 50 
contiguous interleaved slices with 2 mm thickness, acquisition time = 9 min 29 s). To reduce 
eddy current induced artefacts and shimming errors to a minimum in the dMRI protocol, an 
optimized bipolar gradient pulse scheme was employed with a manually selected shim box 
covering a region extending from the top of the head to several centimetres below the chin. 
Structural images were reported by an experienced paediatric radiologist (A.J.Q.) using the 
system described by Leuchter et al. (Leuchter et al., 2014), and images with evidence of 
injury (post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation, porencephalic cyst or cystic periventricular 
leukomalacia), or central nervous system malformation were excluded. 
 
2.3 Structural connectivity  
The complete framework for the network construction can be seen in the Figure 1. 
 
INSERT Figure 1 here. 
 
2.3.1 Preprocessing 
The first step was to denoise the dMRI data (Veraart et al., 2016a; Veraart et al., 2016b) 
followed by up-sampling by a factor of 2 to match the resolution of the T1w volumes using 
cubic b-spline interpolation (Raffelt et al., 2012). Then, the dMRI data were corrected for 
head motion and eddy current distortions (Smith et al., 2004) with the correspondent vector 
rotation, skull-stripped (Smith, 2002) (with manual editing) and corrected for bias field 
inhomogeneity (Tustison et al., 2010). The T1w volumes were skull-stripped (Serag et al., 
2016) and corrected for bias field inhomogeneities (Tustison et al., 2010). Finally, the T1w 
volumes were co-registered to the first B0 EPI volumes for each subject and dMRI data were 
corrected for EPI distortions by non-rigidly registering the EPI volumes to the co-registered 
T1w volumes, restricting the registration to the phase encoding direction (Irfanoglu et al., 
2012; Wu et al., 2008). This process was performed using Symmetric Normalization 
(SyN)(Avants et al., 2008) with mutual information as the registration metric.

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
For each voxel, the water diffusion tensor was estimated using the weighted least-squares 
method with DTIFIT (Smith et al., 2004). FA, MD, AD and RD maps were then generated for 
every subject. 
 
2.3.2 Tissue segmentation and Parcellation 
The T1 template of Edinburgh Neonatal Atlas (ENA33) (Blesa et al., 2016) was used to 
parcellate the T1w volume of each participant using rigid, affine and SyN (Avants et al., 
2008) registration with cross correlation as the registration metric. To generate the tissue 
segmentation we used SEGMA (Serag et al., 2017). This is an automatic SEGMentation 
Approach for human brain MRI using sliding window and random forests that provides 
accurate segmentations across the life course (including the neonatal period) to classify all 
T1w volumes into cortical grey matter, deep grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF). 
 
2.3.3 Tractography 
Tractography was generated using constrained spherical deconvolution (cSD) (Tournier et 
al., 2007; Tournier et al., 2008). The fiber orientation distribution (FOD) was calculated with 
a maximum spherical harmonic degree  (����) of 8 (Tournier et al., 2013). We used ACT 
(Smith et al., 2012) with the iFOD2 algorithm (Tournier et al., 2010). The ACT parameters 
were: seeding at the grey matter/white matter interface (GMWMI); minimum streamline 
length of 20 mm and maximum length of 200 mm (Keunen et al., 2017; Yap et al., 2011); the 
remainder of parameters were used as default (adjusted for upsampled data (Smith et al., 
2012)). 10 million tracts were generated and spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of 
tractograms (SIFT) was applied to reduce the number of tracts to 2 million. This reduces the 
construction bias of the tractogram and improves the biological accuracy and 
interpretability of structural connectivity between regions (Smith et al., 2013). 
 
2.3.4 Network Construction 
The connectome was constructed by assigning a weight to an edge based on the raw 
number of tracts between regions: ����,�� = ��,�. where ��,� represents the connection 
between the nodes i and j; ����,�� is the weight of the connection ��,�; and ��,� is the 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
number of tracts between i and j. Connections with less than five tracts and self-connections 
were set to 0 (Batalle et al., 2017) resulting in a network of size 98 × 98. Any implausible 
tracts traversing from one cortical hemisphere to any contralateral subcortical node were 
discarded (Funnell et al., 2000).  
Note that the networks were not corrected for the inverse length of the paths, since this 
correction is not appropriate for tractograms calculated using a GMWMI seeding strategy 
(Yeh et al., 2016). We refer to those matrices as streamline-weighted matrices (������). 
Next, FA-weighted connectomes were constructed using the mean FA computed over the 
��,� streamlines as an edge weight: ����,�� =
�
��,� ∑
��
�
�
�
��
����,�
���
. Where i, j, ��,� , ����,�� and 
��,�are defined as before; n is each streamline connecting i and j; and ��
�
�
�
�� is the mean FA of 
the tract n. This weight represents the white matter tract “integrity” (Brown et al., 2014; van 
den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011). We refer to those matrices as FA-weighted matrices 
(�����). 
Finally, each ������ was binarized and used to filter the correspondent �����. The 
resulting ����� connectomes were not normalised because the FA values for a region-pair 
connection are averaged across all its ��,�streamlines, making it invariant to the number of 
tractography seeds used (Brown et al., 2014). 
 
2.3.5 Edge-wise comparison 
The ������ were thresholded keeping only the connections common to at least 2/3 of the 
subjects (de Reus and van den Heuvel, 2013), and the threshold was then applied to the 
�����. ����� matrices were analysed using NBS. 
 
2.3.6 Network metrics and analysis 
We calculated 5 network parameters: Global efficiency (GE), local efficiency (LE), normalized 
cluster coefficient (CC), normalized characteristic path length (CPL) and small-worldness 
(SW). For a detailed explanation and the formulation of the metrics, see Rubinov and Sporns 
(2010). All the metrics were implemented in the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (brain-
connectivity-toolbox.net) (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Note that for CPL the length matrix 
was generated using the inverse of each connection of the �����. The normalized CC and 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
normalized CPL were calculated by dividing the CC and CPL, by the CC and CPL calculated 
from an average of 1000 random networks with the same degree and strength distributions. 
 
The connectivity matrices do not have the same density (sparsity). To correct for this, each 
������ was thresholded using its density in small steps from 0.02 to 0.5 in intervals of 
0.02. After this the matrix was binarized and used as a threshold to filter the �����. 
Connectomic data were visualised using Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009) and BrainNet viewer 
(Xia et al., 2013). 
 
2.4 Tract-based Spatial Statistics 
TBSS analysis (Smith et al., 2006) was performed using a pipeline that was optimized for 
neonatal dMRI data (Ball et al., 2010). Using the most representative subject of the cohort 
as a target, an average FA map and mean FA skeleton (threshold FA > 0.15) were created 
from the aligned data representing the main white matter tracts common to all subject. RD, 
AD and MD were projected onto the FA skeleton for voxel wise comparisons.  
 
2.5 Volumetric analysis 
The brain tissue was separated from non-brain tissue using ALFA (Serag et al., 2016), and a 
brain mask was created. Volumes were corrected for field inhomogeneity using the N4 
method (Tustison et al., 2010) and were segmented using SEGMA (Serag et al., 2017). Every 
brain volume was segmented into: brainstem, cerebellum, cortical grey matter, 
cerebrospinal fluid, deep grey matter and white matter (Figure 2). Volumes were calculated 
for each individual tissue type, and total brain tissue volume was calculated as the sum of all 
compartments with the exception of CSF.  
 
INSERT Figure 2 here. 
 
2.6 Analysis of dose effect 
We explored the effect of breast milk dose by repeating group-wise analyses for infants with 
≥ 90% exclusive breast milk days compared to infants with < 90% of exclusive breast milk 
days.

2.7 Statistics 
Edge-wise comparison of connectivity matrices was performed using NBS (Zalesky et al., 
2010) with a t-statistic exceeding a threshold of 3 (Zalesky et al., 2012). Groupwise 
difference in breast milk exposure in the five network measures was investigated using 
ANOVA (in the original matrices and also at each level of density). For TBSS,  group 
comparisons were performed with FSL’s Randomise tool using a general linear univariate 
model (Winkler et al., 2014), with family-wise error correction for multiple testing using 
threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) with a significance level of  p < 0.05 (Smith and 
Nichols, 2009). For volumetric comparisons group-wise analyses were performed using 
ANOVA. In all analyses post-menstrual age (PMA) at birth, PMA at image acquisition, BPD 
and exposure to chorioamnionitis were entered as covariates. False discovery rate was used 
to control for multiple testing in analyses of volumes, network metrics and network metrics 
corrected for density. 
 
3. Results

FA-weighted connectivity was increased in infants who received ≥75% of exclusive breast 
milk feeds compared to those who did not (p=0.0386, NBS). The connections involved 
included intra- and inter-hemispheric fronto-parietal and limbic system structures; 
anatomical labels of altered structural connectivity are shown in Figure 3a. The extent of 
anatomic connectivity was further increased in these neural systems in infants who received 
≥90% of exclusive breast milk, as measured by incorporation of more nodes and edges, an in 
addition sub-cortical networks were involved at the higher breast milk intake threshold 
(p=0.0086, NBS), Figure 3b.

3.3 Network analysis 
There were no statistically significant differences in global network metrics for ����� at

3.4 Tract-based spatial statistics 
There were significant differences in water diffusion tensor parameters in major white 
matter tracts associated with breast milk exposure. Specifically, in the group with ≥ 75% 
days of exclusive breast milk feeds, FA was higher in the splenium of corpus callosum, 
cingulum cingulate gyri, centrum semiovale, corticospinal tracts, the arcuate fasciculi and 
the posterior limbs of internal capsule. These differences were more widespread and 
symmetrical at the ≥ 90% exclusive breast milk days threshold. Infants who received ≥ 90% 
days exclusive breast milk feeds had lower MD and RD than the other participants (Figure 
5).

4. Discussion 
By combining nutritional data with brain MRI markers of preterm brain injury, we have 
shown that greater exposure to breast milk following preterm birth is associated with 
improved white matter microstructure at term-equivalent age. We found differences in the 
FA-weighted connectome and increased FA within white matter tracts of infants who 
received exclusive breast milk feeds for ≥ 75% days of neonatal in-patient care compared 
with infants who received exclusive breast milk for < 75% of days. These effects showed a 
dose-dependent relationship with breast milk exposure and were independent of known 
predictors of preterm brain injury including gestational age at birth, chorioamnionitis, and

BPD. The observed effects are unlikely to be attributable to parenteral nutrition because 
exposure to this did not differ significantly between the groups. 
The TBSS results suggest that breast milk feeds had beneficial distributed effects throughout 
the white matter since voxels within corpus callosum, cingulum cingulate gyri, centrum 
semiovale, corticospinal tracts, arcuate fasciculi and posterior limbs of the internal capsule 
had higher FA in the higher breast milk group. Network alterations involved fronto-parietal 
and limbic systems, with increased sub-cortical connectivity apparent at the higher 
threshold of breast milk intake. Regional susceptibilities of fronto-parietal white matter to 
preterm birth have been reported, and regional cerebral vulnerability to nutritional 
deprivation is well described (e.g. fetal growth restriction and hypoglycaemia associated 
brain injury) (Burns et al., 2008; Inder et al., 2005; Lodygensky et al., 2008). Furthermore, 
fetal growth restriction is associated with tract-specific alterations in dMRI parameters in 
preterm infants (Barnett et al., 2018). Our data suggest that there are tract-specific effects 
of beneficial nutrient exposures in regions and networks; one explanation for this is that 
nutritional factors influence neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, myelination and 
synaptogenesis at critical periods in development and these maturational processes take 
place at different times in different tracts over the course of development (Ramel and 
Georgieff, 2014), as evidenced by the systematic progression of MRI visible myelination in 
the developing brain (Counsell et al., 2002). 
Our data are consistent with neurodevelopmental outcome studies of preterm infants that 
report improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in association with breast feeding (Isaacs et 
al., 2010; Lucas et al., 1998; Patra et al., 2017; Vohr et al., 2007; Vohr et al., 2006). However, 
when outcomes are assessed in early childhood the effects of infant nutrition and other 
potential confounders limit inference about neonatal nutritional exposures. By parsing the 
complex behavioural trait of neurodevelopment to an intermediate phenotype (MRI 
markers of development at term equivalent age) we have shown that breast milk intake 
prior to discharge from hospital is critically important for optimal brain development after 
preterm birth. Previous studies have reported that cumulative lipid and caloric intake from 
all sources (parenteral and enteral) in the first weeks after preterm birth is associated with 
increased FA in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and different white matter tracts, 
that cumulative lipid is associated with cerebellar and grey matter volumes (Coviello et al., 
2017; Schneider et al., 2018); and that higher energy and lipid intake during the first 2

weeks after birth is associated with a lower incidence of brain lesions and signs of 
dysmaturation on conventional MRI (Beauport et al., 2017). Our findings are consistent with 
the observation that early nutrition impacts brain tissue development, but they focus 
particular attention on the value of early breast milk for improving whole brain structural 
connectivity in preterm infants. Breast milk is a complex nutritional substrate that has 
theoretical nutritional advantages over formula milk for promoting brain development. 
These include favourable composition and absorption of fats and protein, improved 
bioavailability of trace elements, and the presence of non-nutrient factors (milk 
oligosaccharides, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin and lysozymes) that may confer direct or 
indirect benefit (Agostoni et al., 2010; Guesnet and Alessandri, 2011). Finally, the infant gut 
microbiome is affected by feeding practice (Pannaraj et al., 2017); modifications to the gut-
brain axis via microbiome are known to influence brain development and behaviour in mice 
(Heijtz et al., 2011) and to predict cognitive performance in infants at 2 years of age (Carlson 
et al., 2017). Attachment, shared social determinants, and maternal education / IQ have 
been associated with breast feeding in healthy term infants (Britton et al., 2006; Der et al., 
2006), although the role of these factors in influencing breast feeding in the NICU setting 
where the breast feeding rate is typically higher compared with the general population, is 
uncertain, as is their role in influencing structural connectivity in preterm infants. Further 
investigation of the role of these factors in influencing early brain development and their 
possible interaction with enteral nutrition is warranted. 
The main strength of the study is the comprehensive assessment of brain development 
using three measures that describe the encephalopathy of prematurity: connectivity, tract 
microstructure, and local and global brain volumes. We were also able to explore dose 
effects.  We evaluated infants at term equivalent age, so are able to rule out confounding by 
nutrition throughout infancy and socio-economic features of the home environment. Finally, 
we used a pragmatic measure of breast milk exposure that is available to healthcare 
providers and parents from routinely recorded data, and does not require additional 
measurements.  
A limitation of our work is that we were not able to investigate the effect of common 
genetic variation in fatty acid metabolism, which may interact with breast milk exposure to 
influence childhood cognition (Caspi et al., 2007; Steer et al., 2010) and white matter 
development (Boardman et al., 2014; Krishnan et al., 2016); nor were we able to investigate 
 MANUSCRIPT

genetic variants of the microglial inflammatory response linked to preterm white matter 
injury (Krishnan et al., 2017). Secondly, we performed a cross-sectional assessment at term 
equivalent age so could not investigate the putative benefits to the preterm brain of longer 
exposure to exclusive breast feeding through infancy. The sample size was not sufficient to 
study the effect of donor expressed breast milk or human milk fortifier on brain 
development. Finally, although the data indicate a dose effect, the difference in number of 
participants with 75% versus 90% exposure was low; larger sub-groups of infants with a 
range of breast milk exposures would be required to characterise fully the dose effect. 
We used cSD with probabilistic tracking because it is beneficial over standard diffusion 
tensor reconstructions for tractography in paediatric brain, even with low b-values (Toselli 
et al., 2017). ACT and SIFT were used to reduce bias in the tractography reconstruction 
(Smith et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2015; Yeh et al., 2016), because recent 
studies have shown the benefit of this approach in the developing brain (Batalle et al., 2017; 
Salvan et al., 2017). ����� were chosen because FA is established as a reliable marker of 
brain development (Ball et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2014; van den Heuvel et al., 2015b), but 
new models that rely on high b-value acquisitions to better characterize crossing fibres 
within WM may provide additional insights into the effect of breast milk on early brain 
development (Zhang et al., 2012), particularly in regions with a high density of crossing 
fibres such as the cerebellum (Pieterman et al., 2017).  
 
5. Conclusion 
In summary, these data show that the microstructural properties of white matter tracts and 
cerebral structural connectivity are improved in association with higher exposure to breast 
milk in preterm infants.
