Abstract
The treatment of chronic pain could benefit from additional non-opioid interventions. Virtual
reality (VR) has been shown to be effective in decreasing pain for procedural or acute pain
but to date there have been few studies on its use in chronic pain. The present study was an
investigation of the impact of a virtual reality application for chronic pain. Thirty (30) partici-
pants with various chronic pain conditions were offered a five-minute session using a virtual
reality application called Cool! Participants were asked about their pain using a 0–10 visual
analog scale rating before the VR session, during the session and immediately after the ses-
sion. They were also asked about immersion into the VR world and about possible side
effects. Pain was reduced from pre-session to post-session by 33%. Pain was reduced from
pre-session during the VR session by 60%. These changes were both statistically significant
at the p < .001 level. Three participants (10%) reported no change between pre and post
pain ratings. Ten participants (33%) reported complete pain relief while doing the virtual real-
ity session. All participants (100%) reported a decrease in pain to some degree between
pre-session pain and during-session pain. The virtual reality experience was found here to
provide a significant amount of pain relief. A head mounted display (HMD) was used with all
subjects and no discomfort was experienced. Only one participant noted any side effects.
VR seems to have promise as a non-opioid treatment for chronic pain and further investiga-
tion is warranted.
Introduction
Many Americans suffer from chronic pain and much of that pain is under-treated or treated
ineffectively [1–3]. Meanwhile, misuse and diversion of opioids used to treat chronic pain con-
ditions have increased dramatically in recent years [4]. This leaves those who treat chronic
pain conditions with the twin dilemma of working to treat chronic pain conditions in an effec-
tive manner while prescribing opioid medications in a very cautious manner, if prescribed at
all. Safe, effective alternatives to opioid medications are vitally important to consider and test
to assist with the great number of persons with chronic pain conditions who need to be helped
without the concerns related to the use of opioid medications.
Virtual reality (VR) has been shown to be an effective adjunct or alternative to opioid anal-
gesics even in cases of high levels of pain such as burn pain and wound care [5–15]. These
numerous studies have demonstrated that VR is an effective tool in significantly reducing pain

 in acute pain situations. The “gate theory” of attention is the most widely accepted model in
explaining the impact of VR on pain [16, 17]. Gate theory of attention postulates that VR
reduces the perception of pain by absorbing and diverting attention away from the pain.
Some authors have opined that VR could be an effective tool in treating chronic pain condi-
tions. Keefe et al state that while there is growing evidence supporting VR’s effectiveness in
managing acute procedural pain, little is known about the use of VR for chronic pain [18].
However, chronic pain is known to be substantially different from acute pain [19]. Multiple
variables are involved with the sensation of chronic pain, including various psychological fac-
tors and central nervous system processes. It is possible that virtual reality, while having been
shown to be effective for acute pain, is ineffective for chronic pain due to these factors.
A review of the current literature finds that there has been only one study to date assessing
the impact of VR on chronic pain [20]. In this study participants were asked about their pain
before a VR session and while they were in the VR session. The session was 15 minutes long
and used pleasant and relaxing scenes. The study did not investigate the impact of VR on
chronic pain after the VR session was over. One past study conducted in Israel investigated the
impact of VR on itching caused by atopic dermatitis and psoriasis vulgaris. In this study data
were gathered on the impact during a VR session and ten minutes afterwards [21]. This study
found that VR significantly decreased itching during the VR sessions and also at ten minutes
afterwards. Interestingly, a video game was also effective in decreasing itching during the ses-
sion but did not decrease itching afterwards.
It is currently unknown whether VR has an impact on chronic pain after a VR session,
though there is reason to think that it would based on the above study on itching. If VR can be
shown to have an impact on the experience of chronic pain after a VR session is over, this
could open a number of possibilities for the use of VR for chronic pain syndromes. The pur-
pose of this present study was to determine the impact of a brief VR session on the experience
of pain in patients with chronic pain conditions, assessing the impact both during and imme-
diately following the session. This study also assessed the issue of whether chronic pain
patients can tolerate the VR session without the side effects that sometimes come with VR
such as headaches, dizziness or nausea.
Methods
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Tennes-
see Knoxville. Participants were recruited from an outpatient pain practice in Knoxville, Ten-
nessee (Pain Consultants of East Tennessee). Recruitment flyers were placed in the practice
lobby and in the physical therapy area. Participation in the study was voluntary and had no
bearing on the patient’s pain treatment. To qualify for the study, participants had to be at least
18 years old, must not be visually or hearing impaired, had to be an active patient at the pain
practice, had to have had an initial psychological assessment, and had to have been assessed at
the initial psychological assessment as having sufficient cognitive faculties to give informed
consent. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria and agreed to be in the study were given
the informed consent form to sign. After their written informed consent was obtained, a time
was arranged for the virtual reality experience. This was usually immediately following the
signing of the informed consent form.
Using a sample size calculator for a paired t test, we assumed a .05 level of statistical proba-
bility and a power of .8. One recent article [22] conducted a meta-analysis on studies to date
which had investigated the use of VR for acute or experimentally-induced pain. Based on these
data we assumed an effect size of .5 and a standard deviation of pre-post change scores of 1.0.

 These choices and assumptions yielded a sample size of 31. Rounding this figure we chose a
sample size of 30 for the study.
The primary outcome measure used on this study was a 0–10 numerical rating scale of
pain. A 0–10 numerical rating of pain has been shown to be a valid and reliable method of rat-
ing pain intensity and shows better compliance, responsiveness and ease of use compared to
verbal rating scales or visual analog scales [23]. The anchors for the numerical rating scale
were “Ten is the worst pain anyone could ever have and zero is no pain at all.”
When the VR session occurred, the equipment and the general visual experience were
explained to the participant and all questions were answered. Before the VR session started he
or she was asked what his or her pain level was on the 0–10 numerical rating scale. The partici-
pant donned the virtual reality headset, headphones placed on the subject and he or she was
given a mouse on a clipboard that was placed in his or her lap. The participant then engaged in
the virtual reality experience (described below) for five minutes. Fig 1 below shows what the
virtual reality setup and activity looks like to the outside observer. After the five minute experi-
ence the VR equipment was removed and the participant was asked what his or her pain was
on the 0–10 numerical rating scale at that moment. The participant was then asked what his or
her pain level was during the virtual reality experience, again using the numerical rating scale.
Participants were further asked two questions about engagement in the virtual reality expe-
rience: “On a scale of 0–10, to what extent did you feel like you went inside the virtual world?
Ten is ‘I went completely inside the virtual world’ and 0 is ‘I did not feel like I went inside it at
all’ and also: “On a scale of 0–10, how real did the objects seem to you? Ten is ‘indistinguish-
able from the real world’ and 0 is ‘completely fake.’” Participants were also asked three ques-
tions about any side effects “On a scale of 0–10 how much dizziness did you feel while you
were in the virtual world? Ten is ‘feel faint’ and zero is ‘no dizziness at all’”, and “On a scale of
0–10 how bad a headache did you feel while you were in the virtual world? Ten is ‘worst head-
aches possible’ and zero is ‘no headache at all’ and “On a scale of 0–10 how much nausea did
you feel while you were in the virtual world? Ten is ‘vomited’ and zero is ‘no nausea at all’”.
This ended the session. A cash reward of five dollars was given to all participants after session
completion and was not dependent on their responses. The intervention then was a single five-
minute exposure to the virtual reality application with a primary outcome measure of one
numerical pain rating scale score obtained for pre-session, post-session and during the VR
session.
The VR application used is these studies is called COOL! (DeepStream VR Inc., 2014).
COOL! is an interactive journey through a fully immersive 360˚ VR fantasy landscape. Partici-
pants are taken along a route through a virtual landscape (see Figs 2 and 3 for screen shots).
Objects include trees, hills, snow scenes, caves, flames and otters. The speed is slow and con-
stant and can not be manipulated by the participant. There is ambient music delivered by the
application through headphones. The music is moderate in volume and participants would
still hear the experimenter and converse as much as they desired. Once started the participant
“travels” through the landscape at a constant speed until the application automatically stops at
the time limit (five minutes). The scene is 360˚ and participants can look forward, left, right,
above, below and behind them in a seamless manner. Participants can interact with various
aspects of the landscape as they “travel” using the buttons of a mouse. Right clicks will toss
orbs and left clicks will toss fish. When hit, flames will make sounds and change colors. When
hit, otters will move about in a playful way and change colors. There is no violence involved.
There is no score to be kept and participants were told they could toss as many orbs or fish as
they liked or none at all. Participants were assured that they could stop any time for any reason
but none did and all participants had the full five minute experience, with several participants
asking if they could continue longer.

 There are two ways that participants could view Cool!. One was with a head-mounted dis-
play (HMD) using an Oculus Rift DK2. This was the default method of viewing Cool!. One
past study has shown that HMD’s extensive facial contact points are particularly problematic
with head injuries, allodynia or claustrophobia [11]. To ensure participants’ comfort if the par-
ticipant has facial pain or for any reason was uncomfortable with the HMD, an alternate

 immersion. A previous study comparing the two technologies (HMD versus the DeepStream
3D Viewer) has found no difference between the two in pain reduction or immersion effect
[24].
Results
Thirty (30) participants were recruited to the study. Sixty-seven (67) percent were female, The
median age was 50 years old with a range of 35 to 79 years. Ninety-six percent were Caucasian.
Participants had a variety of chronic pain disorders, including cervical spine pain (9), lumbar
spine pain (6), hip pain (6), pervasive pain from myalgia or connective tissue disease (2), inter-
stitial cystitis (2), chest wall pain (1), shoulder pain (1), abdominal pain (1), thoracic spinal
pain (1), and neuropathy (1). The average reported duration of their pain was 16 years, with
the range being 1 year to 43 years. All participants then met the definition of having a chronic
pain disorder.
The average pre-session pain rating for the 30 participants was 5.7. The average post-session
pain rating was 4.1 and the during-session average pain rating was 2.6. The average change in
pain rating between pre-session ratings and post-session ratings was -1.6 and resulted in a 33%
reduction in pain. A paired t-test of pre-post session ratings found this change to be significant
at the p < .001 level. The average change in pain rating between pre-session ratings and dur-
ing-session ratings was –3.1 and resulted in a 60% reduction in pain. A paired t-test also found
this change to be significant at the p < .001 level. Three participants (10%) reported no change
between pre and post pain ratings. All participants (100%) reported a decrease in pain to some
degree between pre-session pain and during-session pain. Ten participants (33%) reported
100% pain relief while doing the virtual reality session.
Participants were asked to rate their engagement in the virtual world 0–10. The average rat-
ing on this item was 8.4. The participants were asked how real the virtual world seemed to
them 0–10. The average rating on this item was 6.5. As to side effects participants were asked
about dizziness, headaches and nausea, rating each 0–10. No participant complained about
any degree of dizziness or headache with the HMD. One participant rated nausea as a 3/10.
She noted that she had a long history of nausea with video games and said that this application
was better than the video games she has used before in not triggering nausea. All other partici-
pants reported no degree of nausea. All participants used the Oculus Rift DK2 to view Cool!
and the DeepStream 3D Viewer was never used or needed to be offered due to discomfort.
Summary, Discussion and Limitations
This study set out to determine the impact of a brief virtual reality experience on the experi-
ence of chronic pain. Participants were given a five-minute experience of the virtual reality
application called Cool!. Data was gathered on the level of chronic pain felt immediately before
the session, during the session and immediately after the session. The data obtained here
found that a five-minute virtual reality experience decreased the sensation of chronic pain by
an average of 33% from pre-session and to post-session. Participants reported an average
decrease in pain of 60% between pre-session and during the experience. Both of these
decreases in pain sensation were significant at the p < .001 level. Participants generally
reported that they felt involved in the experience and that it seemed fairly “real” to them. Only
one participant reported any side effect of any kind. This finding is in contrast to the previous
study on VR with chronic pain which showed that participants had some side effects though at
low levels [20].
An HMD device was used (Oculus Rift DK2). An alternative viewer from a HMD device
was available for use if side effects were present or if there was discomfort from the HMD but

 no participant had trouble with or discomfort from the HMD. This was despite the fact that
several participants had a diagnosis of neck or head pain. Thus, unlike one past study which
found some discomfort with an HMD [11], this was not a problem here.
Spontaneous comments about the VR experience included the following. “I absolutely love
this. Oh my God, this thing is so cool. That was amazing”; “I’d like to do more hours of it, not
just because of the benefits but because it was fun”; “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would like to do
the longer version”; “It was relaxing. It would be good for depression”; and “Wow, I had no
toothache while I was doing that.” One participant wanted the ability to change speeds during
the experience and one complained that the images were “grainy.” One said there was a “frus-
tration factor” as he could not hit the otters consistently with orbs or fish.
It is interesting to note that the median age was 50 years old. Chronic pain patients are
often somewhat familiar with technology but are generally older than a younger often techno-
logically savvy population. Still, this older population had no problems using or enjoying this
technology. It is also interesting to note that when used on an Oculus Rift the application
Cool! requires participants to aim their throws by turning their head to look directly at an
object. The VR experience was well-received by all participants despite the fact that the most
common pain disorder among participants was cervical spine pain. Apparently participants
were involved or distracted enough that no one complained about having to turn their head to
throw fish or orbs.
The virtual reality experience was found here to provide a significant amount of pain relief
and the analgesia was present immediately after the session was over. As a measure of compar-
ison for analgesia, one meta-analysis found that morphine reduces pain by about 30% [25].
The analgesia experienced by participants here was comparable to morphine between pre-ses-
sion and post-session and was almost double that when comparing between pre-session and
during-session pain ratings. Decreasing the use of opioid analgesics and using alternatives to
opioids in treating chronic pain has been a clarion call recently [26]. The data found here sup-
port continued investigation of virtual reality as a treatment for chronic pain.
There are several limitations to this study. There was no comparison group in this study.
Comparing this VR intervention with other methods of reducing pain such guided relaxation
or distraction could help clarify the specific mechanisms and relative power of this interven-
tion for chronic pain. A review by Li et al (2011) notes that while VR has been shown to offer
improved analgesia over other types of distractions (such as cartoons and video games) the
exact mechanisms that produce the analgesia are as yet unknown [27]. The selective and
focused attention that is elicited during VR appears to be supplemented by emotional and cog-
nitive factors as well. The richness of the sensory and cognitive experience in VR appears to
produce more impactful results that more simple and unisensory forms of distraction. Addi-
tional research is needed to parse out which factors are most important for patients with
chronic pain.
One potential confounder to the results found here is that the principle investigator was
conducting the VR session and collecting the outcome data. It could be that experimenter bias
was introduced through this process. A future study in which the VR session is conducted by
an unaffiliated person could assess the presence of this bias. Additionally, the participants in
this VR were aware of the study purposes and could have been biased to expect an effect.
Finally, another possible confounder was the way in which the participants were obtained. Par-
ticipants were recruited through flyers at a pain clinic and self-selected to participate. It is likely
that those who chose to be in the study were motivated and had expectations about potential
pain relief. A future study could involve participants who, while voluntarily agreeing to be in
the study, are not recruited through a voluntary selection process.

 There are a host of questions to be addressed in future research. As above, more studies are
needed comparing VR with other pain reduction techniques. These studies should help deter-
mine what elements of this intervention are most important and central to its effect. Another
question is about the duration of the analgesia from VR. It was found here that chronic pain
levels were reduced after a VR session. What is not known is how long the duration of analge-
sia might be. We anecdotally heard some participants in this study report that their analgesia
lasted for hours or even days after the VR session was over. This leads back to the question
about the underlying neural mechanisms of analgesia of VR. The effectiveness of VR could be
based solely on attentional factors through the gate theory mechanisms or it could be that
endorphin release (pleasure of the game and experiencing pain relief) could be playing a role
as well. The answers to these questions could help determine the future relative emphasis that
could be placed on the development of VR systems that can be used at home on a ongoing
basis or whether office-based systems might be preferred.
Another question for further study is whether longer VR sessions could produce greater
analgesia over time. This study used a five-minute VR session. It is possible that longer sessions
can produce analgesia that has significant duration, which is particularly important for chronic
pain conditions. Also, which VR applications produce more or less analgesia is an empirical
question that should be studied. Likely there are certain characteristics of VR applications that
can enhance analgesia and these need to be explored.
Gender and age differences are important variables to be investigated in future studies. It
may well be that gender and age are tied to the effects or lack of effects found in the use of vir-
tual reality for pain. Similarly, chronic pain is a heterogeneous disease. It may be that VR is
more effective for chronic pain disorders that more intimately involve the central nervous sys-
tem such as CRPS or fibromyalgia while being less effective for more mechanically-based pain
disorders such as low back pain or arthritic conditions. Moving forward, studies will need to
parse these variables out to determine for which chronic pain patients VR might be particu-
larly effective.
The present study found that, in this sample, the majority of chronic pain patients experi-
enced significant analgesia with a brief VR session. We found very few side effects to be associ-
ated with the experience. VR appears to have some promise as a non-opioid treatment for
chronic pain and further investigation appears warranted.
