Abstract
BACKGROUND—A protein that is expressed on capillary endothelial cells, called GPIHBP1 
(glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1), binds 
lipoprotein lipase and shuttles it to its site of action in the capillary lumen. A deficiency in 
GPIHBP1 prevents lipoprotein lipase from reaching the capillary lumen. Patients with GPIHBP1 
deficiency have low plasma levels of lipoprotein lipase, impaired intravascular hydrolysis of 
triglycerides, and severe hypertriglyceridemia (chylomicronemia). During the characterization of a 
monoclonal antibody–based immunoassay for GPIHBP1, we encountered two plasma samples 
(both from patients with chylomicronemia) that contained an interfering substance that made it 
impossible to measure GPIHBP1. That finding raised the possibility that those samples might 
contain GPIHBP1 autoantibodies.
METHODS—Using a combination of immunoassays, Western blot analyses, and 
immunocytochemical studies, we tested the two plasma samples (as well as samples from other 
patients with chylomicronemia) for the presence of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. We also tested the 
ability of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies to block the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1.
RESULTS—We identified GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in six patients with chylomicronemia and 
found that these autoantibodies blocked the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1. As in 
patients with GPIHBP1 deficiency, those with GPIHBP1 autoantibodies had low plasma levels of 
lipoprotein lipase. Three of the six patients had systemic lupus erythematosus. One of these 
patients who had GPIHBP1 autoantibodies delivered a baby with plasma containing maternal 
GPIHBP1 autoantibodies; the infant had severe but transient chylomicronemia. Two of the patients 
with chylomicronemia and GPIHBP1 autoantibodies had a response to treatment with 
immunosuppressive agents.
CONCLUSIONS—In six patients with chylomicronemia, GPIHBP1 autoantibodies blocked the 
ability of GPIHBP1 to bind and transport lipoprotein lipase, thereby interfering with lipoprotein 
lipase–mediated processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and causing severe 
hypertriglyceridemia.

 A protein in the lymphocyte antigen 6 (Ly6) superfamily, called GPIHBP1 
(glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1), is 
expressed on the surface of capillary endothelial cells. GPIHBP1 binds lipoprotein lipase in 
the interstitial spaces (where the lipase is secreted by myocytes and adipocytes) and shuttles 
it to its site of action in the capillary lumen.1,2 In patients with GPIHBP1 deficiency, 
lipoprotein lipase is mislocalized in the interstitial spaces and never reaches the capillary 
lumen. The absence of intraluminal lipoprotein lipase prevents the lipolytic processing of 
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and results in severe hypertriglyceridemia (chylomicronemia, 
defined as a triglyceride level of >1000 mg per deciliter [>11.3 mmol per liter]).1,2 Many 
GPIHBP1 missense mutations that cause chylomicronemia have been identified.3–8 All these 
mutations disrupt the folding of the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1 (the domain that binds 
lipoprotein lipase with high affinity) and block the ability of GPIHBP1 to bind lipoprotein 
lipase and transport it to the capillary lumen.3–8 A signature of GPIHBP1 deficiency in 
humans is low levels of lipoprotein lipase in plasma obtained either before or after the 
intravenous administration of heparin (preheparin and postheparin, respectively), a finding 
that reflects a virtual absence of lipoprotein lipase inside capillaries.3,4,7,9
We recently used monoclonal antibodies against human GPIHBP1 to create an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that could detect GPIHBP1 in human plasma.10 We 
encountered two plasma samples, both obtained from patients with chylomicronemia, that 
contained an interfering substance that prevented the measurement of GPIHBP1 in those 
samples or even the detection of recombinant GPIHBP1 that had been spiked into those 
samples. We hypothesized that such interference on ELISA might be caused by GPIHBP1 
autoantibodies. We further hypothesized that these autoantibodies would prevent the binding 
of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1 (i.e., the GPIHBP1-autoantibody syndrome) and thereby 
cause chylomicronemia. In this study, we report the presence of specific, high-titer 
GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in six patients with chylomicronemia and show that these 
antibodies block the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1.
METHODS
STUDY PATIENTS
The initial study cohort, which was selected to assist in the development of the ELISA 
analysis for GPIHBP1, included 23 patients who were known to have mutations in 
GPIHBP1 or LPL (the gene encoding lipoprotein lipase), 8 patients who had 
hypertriglyceridemia without mutations in GPIHBP1 or LPL, and 9 controls. After the 
identification of 2 patients who had GPIHBP1 autoantibodies (1 with systemic lupus 
erythematosus [SLE] and both with hypertriglyceridemia) in this initial cohort of 40 
patients, we then screened another 162 patients for the presence of such autoantibodies. This 
group included 40 patients with SLE from the rheumatology clinic at the University of 
California, Los Angeles (half of whom were receiving immunosuppressive therapy), and 122 
patients from lipid clinics (all with hypertriglyceridemia of unknown cause).
The 202 plasma samples from study patients were either archived specimens that had been 
obtained under institutional approval or samples without identifiers that were sent from other 
investigators to the last author. Thus, the university ethics committee deemed that the use of

 these samples was exempt from approval by institutional review boards. The numbers that 
are used to identify the patients throughout this report are the sample numbers recorded for 
specimen identification by the laboratory of the last author.
ELISA ANALYSES
To measure GPIHBP1 levels in plasma samples obtained from the study patients, we used a 
monoclonal antibody–based sandwich ELISA that is similar to those used to measure 
lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein B levels.11,12 In these analyses, 96-well ELISA plates 
were coated with the GPIHBP1-specific monoclonal antibody RF4.10 After the addition of 
plasma samples or known amounts of recombinant human GPIHBP1, bound GPIHBP1 was 
detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled GPIHBP1-specific monoclonal 
antibody RE3.10
To detect GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in plasma, 96-well plates were coated with human 
GPIHBP1 or GPIHBP1 containing an amino-terminal urokinase-type plasminogen activator 
receptor tag.8 After blocking with bovine serum albumin, plasma samples were added. After 
the plates were washed, antibody binding to GPIHBP1 was detected with HRP-labeled goat 
antihuman IgG and IgM. We determined the amount of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies (in 
arbitrary units) by comparing ELISA signals with those in a parallel ELISA in which plates 
were coated with known amounts of human IgG. We also performed ELISA analyses to test 
for autoantibodies against three other Ly6 proteins (CD177, C4.4A, and CD59) that were 
available for testing in our laboratory.
To test the ability of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies to block the binding of lipoprotein lipase to 
GPIHBP1, 96-well plates that were coated with GPIHBP1 were incubated with dilutions of 
plasma samples overnight at 4°C. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with V5-
tagged human lipoprotein lipase (200 ng per well) (see Methods Section S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). After 
washing, an HRP-V5 antibody was added to quantify the amount of bound lipoprotein 
lipase. In parallel, an HRP-labeled goat antihuman IgG was added to document autoantibody 
binding to GPIHBP1. The presence of GPIHBP1 on the plates was verified with the HRP-
labeled monoclonal antibody 11A12. As a control, we tested the ability of the monoclonal 
antibody RE310 to block the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1. Details regarding the 
ELISA analyses are provided in Methods Sections S2 through S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
WESTERN BLOT ASSAY OF LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE BINDING TO GPIHBP1
Cells expressing S-protein–tagged GPIHBP1 were incubated with V5-tagged human 
lipoprotein lipase. After washing and lysis, cell extracts were fractionated according to size 
by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and 
the amount of lipoprotein lipase that was bound to cells was determined on Western blot 
analysis with a V5 antibody.13 To determine whether GPIHBP1 autoantibodies blocked the 
binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1, the same assay was performed, except that 
transfected cells were preincubated with plasma samples containing GPIHBP1

 autoantibodies. Additional details about the Western blot assays are provided in Methods 
Section S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.
IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS
To visualize binding of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
expressing S-protein–tagged GPIHBP1 were incubated for 2 hours at 4°C with human 
plasma samples. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat 
antihuman IgG and IgM for 1 hour at 4°C and then fixed with paraformaldehyde. GPIHBP1 
expression was assessed with the use of monoclonal antibody RG310 or with an antibody 
against the S-protein tag.
To test the ability of the GPIHBP1 autoantibodies to block lipoprotein lipase binding, S-
protein–tagged GPIHBP1-transfected cells were incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with human 
plasma samples. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with V5-tagged 
human lipoprotein lipase. After washing and fixation with methanol, the cells were stained 
with an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat antihuman IgG and IgM, a rabbit antibody against 
the S-protein tag followed by an Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated donkey antirabbit IgG, and an 
Alexa Fluor 555–conjugated mouse anti-V5 antibody. Experimental details are provided in 
Methods Sections S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.
RESULTS
ELISA INTERFERENCE AND GPIHBP1 AUTOANTIBODIES
On the sandwich ELISA, GPIHBP1 levels in control plasma samples ranged from 239 to 
1110 pg per milliliter, values that were much higher than those in two patients with a 
homozygous GPIHBP1 C89X mutation (3 pg per milliliter in Patient 11 and 6 pg per 
milliliter in Patient 15) and in a patient with a homozygous GPIHBP1 deletion7 (36 pg per 
milliliter in Patient 3) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
To validate the ELISA analysis, we spiked recombinant GPIHBP1 into 40 plasma samples. 
In 38 samples, the mean (±SD) recovery of spiked GPIHBP1 was 98.8±3.8%. However, in 
samples from two patients with chylomicronemia and low plasma GPIHBP1 levels (Patient 
38 with 85 pg per milliliter and Patient 101 with 29 pg per milliliter), the recovery of spiked 
GPIHBP1 was extremely low (6.8% and 4.4%, respectively), which indicated assay 
interference (Fig. 1). Patient 38 was a 26-year-old man5 with severe hypertriglyceridemia 
(highest recorded triglyceride level, 5572 mg per deciliter [62.9 mmol per liter]) complicated 
by pancreatitis. Patient 101 was a 53-year-old Japanese woman who had a 25-year history of 
SLE and severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride range, 500 to 5000 mg per deciliter [5.6 
to 56.5 mmol per liter]) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). No LPL mutations were 
identified in either patient. Additional clinical information is provided in the Results section 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
We suspected that the ELISA interference in samples obtained from Patients 38 and 101 was 
caused by GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. Indeed, GPIHBP1 autoantibodies were detected on 
Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). ELISA analyses showed that the autoantibodies were IgG 
and not IgM (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The autoantibodies in the sample

 obtained from Patient 38 had avid binding to GPIHBP1-transfected CHO pgsA-745 cells but 
not to nontransfected cells nor to cells transfected with CD59 (another Ly6 protein); a 
control plasma sample (control sample 3) did not bind to GPIHBP1-transfected cells (Fig. 
2B).
ADDITIONAL PLASMA SAMPLES WITH GPIHBP1 AUTOANTIBODIES
Using ELISA analysis, we screened 130 samples obtained from patients with unexplained 
hypertriglyceridemia (several of whom had SLE or Sjögren’s syndrome) for GPIHBP1 
autoantibodies (Fig. 3A). We also screened plasma samples obtained from 40 patients with 
SLE, half of whom were receiving immunosuppressive therapy. None of the 40 patients with 
SLE had either severe hypertriglyceridemia or GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. Of the 130 patients 
with unexplained hypertriglyceridemia, 124 were negative for GPIHBP1 autoantibodies and 
6 were positive (above-mentioned Patients 38 and 101, along with Patients 102, 111, 157, 
and 164).
All the patients who were positive for GPIHBP1 antibodies had severe hypertriglyceridemia 
complicated by pancreatitis. (Clinical and laboratory details are provided in the Results 
section and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.) The hyperlipidemia in 
Patient 157, a 26-year-old woman with SLE, resolved with immunosuppressive drugs.14 
When Patient 164, a 9-year-old girl with Sjögren’s syndrome,15 was treated with 
immunosuppressive drugs, the plasma triglyceride levels normalized and GPIHBP1 
autoantibodies were no longer detectable in the plasma.15 Patient 102, a 38-year-old woman 
with SLE, delivered a baby girl; testing of blood samples from the baby (Patient 103) on the 
first day of life showed maternal GPIHBP1 autoantibodies and triglyceride levels of 9090 
mg per deciliter (102.6 mmol per liter). By the time the child was 1 year of age, the plasma 
triglyceride levels had normalized to 72 mg per deciliter (0.8 mmol per liter).
Western blot analysis revealed GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in plasma samples obtained from 
Patients 102, 111, 157, and 164 (Fig. 3B). In these patients, the autoantibodies bound poorly 
to GPIHBP1 treated with reducing agents, which suggested that the epitopes for the 
autoantibodies required the proper conformation of the cysteine-rich Ly6 domain (the 
domain that mediates binding of lipoprotein lipase) in GPIHBP1. The plasma samples with 
GPIHBP1 autoantibodies that were obtained from Patients 38, 101, 102 (and her infant, 
Patient 103), 111, 157, and 164 were negative for autoantibodies against three other Ly6 
proteins (CD177, C4.4A, and CD59) (Fig. 3C and 3D).16
GPIHBP1 AUTOANTIBODIES AND BINDING OF LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE
For GPIHBP1 autoantibodies to cause hypertriglyceridemia, they would need to block the 
binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1. To explore that possibility, we tested the ability of 
one plasma sample containing GPIHBP1 autoantibody (from Patient 38) and a plasma 
sample without GPIHBP1 autoantibody (from Patient 3) as a control to block the binding of 
V5-tagged human lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1-expressing CHO cells. Only plasma from 
Patient 38 blocked binding of lipoprotein lipase, as judged by Western blot analyses of cell 
extracts (Fig. 4A). We also used immunocytochemical studies to test the ability of the 
GPIHBP1 autoantibodies to block the binding of lipoprotein lipase to the surface of

 GPIHBP1-transfected cells. Autoantibodies in plasma samples from Patients 102 and 111 
blocked the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1 on the cell surface (Fig. 4B). The 
immunoglobulins in control plasma from Patient 3 had weak and nonspecific binding to cells 
and did not block lipoprotein lipase binding (Fig. 4B).
We performed ELISA analyses to assess the ability of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies to block the 
binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1 and simultaneously determined autoantibody 
titers. Plasma samples obtained from Patients 38, 101, 102, 111, 157, and 164 blocked the 
binding of lipoprotein lipase in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A). Plasma from Patient 102 
had the highest titers of autoantibodies against GPIHBP1 (Fig. 5B) and was most potent in 
blocking lipoprotein lipase binding. The sample from the infant of Patient 102 (Patient 103) 
also blocked the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1 (Fig. 5A), even though the titer of 
GPIHBP1 autoantibodies was less than 5% of that in plasma obtained from the infant’s 
mother (Fig. 5B, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE IN PLASMA SAMPLES WITH GPIHBP1 AUTOANTIBODIES
The levels of lipoprotein lipase in control preheparin plasma samples range from 50 to 77 ng 
per milliliter.11 We measured preheparin plasma levels of lipoprotein lipase in patients who 
were homozygous for missense or nonsense mutations in GPIHBP1 and found them to be 
low in most cases (range, 7.3 to 70.6 ng per milliliter) (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). These findings are similar to those in earlier studies3,4,7,9 and are consistent with 
impaired transport of lipoprotein lipase to the capillary lumen. One would predict that 
plasma levels of lipoprotein lipase in patients with GPIHBP1 autoantibodies would also be 
low if the GPIHBP1 autoantibodies truly caused the chylomicronemia (i.e., if the 
autoantibodies blocked lipoprotein lipase binding and transport). Indeed, the lipoprotein 
lipase levels in plasma samples containing the autoantibodies were low (range, 4.6 to 32.1 
ng per milliliter) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix), a finding that is consistent with 
impaired delivery of lipoprotein lipase to the capillary lumen.
DISCUSSION
We describe the discovery of autoantibodies against GPIHBP1, the protein that shuttles 
lipoprotein lipase to the capillary lumen, in the plasma of six patients with severe 
hypertriglyceridemia. Our data provide strong support for the conclusion that GPIHBP1 
autoantibodies were the cause of the observed hypertriglyceridemia. First, the autoantibodies 
blocked the binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1. Second, the plasma levels of 
lipoprotein lipase were very low in the patients with GPIHBP1 autoantibodies, which is 
consistent with impaired transport of lipoprotein lipase to the capillary lumen. Third, 
immunosuppressive drug therapy normalized the triglyceride levels in two of the six 
patients, Patients 157 and 164.14,15 Fourth, Patient 102 delivered a baby (Patient 103) who 
was born with GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. The infant had a plasma triglyceride level of 9090 
mg per deciliter on the first day of life, but the hyperlipidemia steadily waned, which is 
consistent with a gradual disappearance of maternal IgGs.
GPIHBP1, which binds lipoprotein lipase in the interstitial spaces and transports it to the 
capillary lumen,1,2 is a long-lived protein that moves bidirectionally across capillary

 endothelial cells.17 In murine models, GPIHBP1 has been shown to transport a GPIHBP1-
specific monoclonal antibody from the capillary lumen to the basolateral surface of 
endothelial cells2; GPIHBP1 transported the same monoclonal antibody from the interstitial 
spaces to the capillary lumen18 (Fig. 6A). In our study, among the patients with GPIHBP1 
autoantibodies, we found that the autoantibodies were able to bind to GPIHBP1 in 
capillaries, and it is likely (given the antibody-transport studies in mice) that the GPIHBP1–
autoantibody complexes move back and forth across endothelial cells. Because GPIHBP1 
autoantibodies block binding of lipoprotein lipase, we further assume that the transport of 
lipoprotein lipase to the capillary lumen in patients with autoantibodies is negligible and that 
the lipoprotein lipase is mislocalized in the interstitial spaces, as it is in Gpihbp1-deficient 
mice (Fig. 6B).2
Previous studies have shown that chylomicronemia can be caused by autoantibodies against 
lipoprotein lipase.14,15,19–22 In an earlier study,14 investigators suspected that Patient 157 
would also have autoantibodies against lipoprotein lipase,14 but we found none. The initial 
suspicion that lipoprotein lipase autoantibodies would be present was based on spiking the 
patient’s plasma into a postheparin control plasma sample and finding reduced amounts of 
triglyceride hydrolysis. That type of assay is problematic because of the inherent instability 
of lipoprotein lipase and because of competition from plasma lipoproteins. Also, Patient 164 
was reported to have lipoprotein lipase autoantibodies on Western blot analysis,15 but we 
found none, and in hindsight the initial Western blot analysis was not definitive.
Four of the six patients with GPIHBP1 autoantibodies who had chylomicronemia had 
received a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease (SLE or Sjögren’s syndrome). In such 
patients, autoantibodies against many proteins can develop, and our data indicate that 
GPIHBP1 is one of those proteins. Because of the transfer of maternal autoantibodies, some 
infants who are born to mothers with SLE are found to have neonatal lupus (characterized by 
cutaneous lesions and cardiac conduction abnormalities).23 On the basis of our data, 
chylomicronemia is a potential finding in infants born to mothers with SLE. Of the six 
patients with GPIHBP1 autoantibodies, two had no evidence of rheumatologic disease. 
Thus, we believe that testing for GPIHBP1 autoantibodies should be considered in patients 
with acquired chylomicronemia regardless of whether autoimmune disease is diagnosed.
GPIHBP1 is one of approximately 25 Ly6 proteins, each of which is characterized by one or 
more three-fingered Ly6 domains containing 8 or 10 cysteines that are all disulfide-bonded. 
The autoantibodies in our patients bound to properly folded GPIHBP1 monomers with intact 
disulfide bonds, and the autoantibodies did not cross-react with other Ly6 proteins, including 
CD59. It is intriguing that other autoantibodies associated with human disease bind to 
cysteine-rich domains in proteins. For example, autoantibodies against the cysteine-rich 
region of ADAMTS13 cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.24 In addition, 
autoantibodies against a cysteine-rich domain of the thyrotropin receptor have been 
identified in Graves’ disease,25–27 and autoantibodies against a cysteine-rich domain of the 
phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) have been identified in membranous nephropathy.28
In our studies, immunoassay interference was the clue that led to our identification of 
GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. Immunoassay interference from autoantibodies is well known to

 clinical chemists. For example, autoantibodies against troponin can interfere with troponin 
assays used to diagnose myocardial infarction,29 and autoantibodies against thyrotropin, 
thyroxine, and triiodothyronine can interfere with immunoassays used to diagnose thyroid 
diseases.30
Our study does not allow us to estimate the incidence with which GPIHBP1 antibodies occur 
or lead to the clinical syndrome of chylomicronemia. In addition, our study provides limited 
information regarding effective forms of therapy for the syndrome. Further research will be 
necessary to address these important issues.
In conclusion, we identified autoantibodies against GPIHBP1 that block the ability of this 
protein to bind to lipoprotein lipase and transport it from the interstitial space to the capillary 
lumen. These autoantibodies, which were identified in six patients, interfered with 
lipoprotein lipase–mediated processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and caused severe 
hypertriglyceridemia.

 Figure 1. GPIHBP1 Immunoassay Interference
To validate the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis, recombinant 
GPIHBP1 was spiked into 40 plasma samples; the results of that analysis are shown here. 
(Details are provided in Methods Section S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Briefly, 
GPIHBP1 levels in 1:20 dilutions of plasma were measured before and after spiking of the 
sample with 62.5 pg of recombinant GPIHBP1. In 38 of 40 plasma samples, the mean (±SD) 
recovery of spiked recombinant GPIHBP1 was nearly complete (98.8±3.8%). In these 
samples, the mean GPIHBP1 values were 21.0±3.0 pg per milliliter before spiking with 
recombinant GPIHBP1 and 82.5±3.0 pg per milliliter after spiking. The recovery of 
recombinant GPIHBP1 in samples obtained from Patients 38 and 101 (two patients with 
chylomicronemia and low plasma GPIHBP1 levels) was very low (6.8% and 4.4%, 
respectively). The GPIHBP1 level in the plasma sample obtained from Patient 38 was 3.0 pg 
per milliliter in the 1:20 dilution and 4.5 pg per milliliter after the sample was spiked; in the 
sample obtained from Patient 101, the GPIHBP1 levels before and after spiking were 1.0 pg 
per milliliter and 3.0 pg per milliliter, respectively. Because of the low coefficient of 
variation in the ELISA analysis, a few of the samples had an apparent recovery rate that was 
slightly more than 100%.

 Figure 2. GPIHBP1 Autoantibodies in Plasma Samples Obtained from Patients 38 and 101
Panel A shows the results of Western blot analysis of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in plasma 
samples obtained from Patients 38 and 101. Proteins in the medium of GPIHBP1-transfected 
drosophila S2 cells were fractionated according to size by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing (R) and nonreducing (NR) 
conditions. (Details are provided in Methods Section S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.) 
GPIHBP1 contains a tightly folded cysteine-rich domain (Ly6 domain) that is essential for 
the binding of lipoprotein lipase. The hypothesis was that some of the autoantibodies might 
bind to the Ly6 domain and that disrupting the disulfide bonds with reducing reagents might 
disrupt the epitope of some of the autoantibodies. The autoantibodies in plasma obtained 
from Patient 101 (containing 20 arbitrary units [AU] of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies per

 milliliter) bound to both reduced and nonreduced GPIHBP1; additional nonspecific binding 
was seen under reducing conditions. The autoantibodies in plasma obtained from Patient 38 
(containing 20 AU of GPIHBP1 autoantibodies per milliliter) bound avidly only to 
nonreduced GPIHBP1. In the lower row, the panels show the same blots incubated with the 
GPIHBP1-specific monoclonal antibody RF4 (4 μg per milliliter) (see Methods Section S10 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The monoclonal antibody RF4 binds to the acidic domain 
of GPIHBP1 and therefore binds both reduced and nonreduced human GPIHBP1; it also 
binds to GPIHBP1 dimers and multimers; the latter forms are artifacts of insect-cell 
overexpression and are due to inappropriate intermolecular disulfide bonds. The control 
culture medium was obtained from S2 cells that do not express human GPIHBP1. Panel B 
shows the results of an immunocytochemical experiment documenting that GPIHBP1 
autoantibodies in plasma obtained from Patient 38 (1:20 dilution; green) bound to cells that 
had been transfected with an S-protein–tagged version of human GPIHBP1 (hGPIHBP1) but 
did not bind to nontransfected cells or to cells that were transfected with S-protein–tagged 
human CD59 (hCD59) (see Methods Section S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). CD59-
transfected and GPIHBP1-transfected cells were detected with an antibody against the S-
protein tag (red); GPIHBP1-expressing cells were also detected with a GPIHBP1-specific 
monoclonal antibody RG3 (orange). DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
(DAPI, blue) to reveal all cells (both transfected and nontransfected) on the coverslip. The 
immunoglobulins in plasma obtained from Patient 3 (who was homozygous for a GPIHBP1 
deletion) did not bind to GPIHBP1-transfected cells.

 Figure 3. Identification of Four Additional Plasma Samples with GPIHBP1 Autoantibodies
Panel A summarizes the plasma samples screened for GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in 202 
deidentified archived plasma samples from lipid clinics or a rheumatology clinic in which 
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were being treated. Forty patients with 
SLE, half of whom were receiving immunosuppressive therapy, were included; 10 of those 
patients had plasma triglyceride levels ranging from 350 to 750 mg per deciliter (4.0 to 8.5 
mmol per liter). The 162 patients from various lipid clinics included 130 patients who had 
hypertriglyceridemia with no known genetic cause, 23 patients who had 
hypertriglyceridemia and a mutation in GPIHBP1 or LPL, and 9 controls. (Details are 
provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Panel B shows Western blot analysis 
demonstrating that the immunoglobulins in plasma samples obtained from Patients 102, 157, 
111, and 164 (containing 20 AU of GPIHBP1 autoantibody per milliliter) bind preferentially 
to nonreduced human GPIHBP1. The lower panels show the same blots incubated with the 
human GPIHBP1–specific monoclonal antibody RF4 (4 μg per milliliter). The monoclonal 
antibody RF4, which binds to reduced and nonreduced forms of GPIHBP1 and to GPIHBP1 
multimers, was used as a loading control. The control culture medium was obtained from S2

 cells that do not express human GPIHBP1. Panel C shows the results from ELISA analyses 
revealing that the immunoglobulin (IgG) in plasma samples obtained from Patients 38, 101, 
102, 103, 111, 157, and 164 bind to wells of an ELISA plate coated with purified human 
GPIHBP1 but not to wells coated with other human Ly6 proteins (CD177, C4.4A, and 
CD59) (see Methods Section S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The dilution was 
1:12,500 for the sample obtained from Patient 102 and 1:500 for the other samples. A 
control plasma sample did not bind to any of the Ly6 proteins. The optical density (OD) was 
measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. Panel D shows Western blot analysis (performed with 
the use of monoclonal antibody R2416) of purified Ly6 proteins (CD177, C4.4A, GPIHBP1, 
and CD59) that had been fractionated according to size by means of SDS-PAGE. All four 
proteins had an amino-terminal urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) tag 
that could be detected with monoclonal antibody R24. This Western blot analysis documents 
that similar amounts of all four Ly6 proteins were used to coat 96-well plates for the ELISA 
analysis shown in Panel C.

 Figure 4. Blocking of Binding of Lipoprotein Lipase to GPIHBP1 by Autoantibodies
Panel A shows a Western blot analysis of cell extracts from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 
cells transfected with S-protein–tagged wild-type (wt) GPIHBP1 or a mutant GPIHBP1 
(W109S), which lacks the ability to bind lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (see Methods Section S6 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The lipoprotein lipase that was used in these experiments 
was V5-tagged. Western blot analyses were performed with a goat antibody against the S-
protein tag (Abcam, 5 μg per milliliter), followed by infrared dye (IRDye) 680–donkey 
antigoat IgG at 1:2000 dilution (red) and an IRDye 800-V5 antibody at 1:500 dilution 
(green). Actin was used as a loading control and was detected with a rabbit antibody against 
actin (Abcam, 5 μg per milliliter) followed by an IRDye 800–donkey antirabbit IgG at

 1:2000 dilution (green). In lane 3, binding of lipoprotein lipase to wild-type GPIHBP1 is 
shown. In lane 4, a control plasma sample from Patient 3 did not block binding of 
lipoprotein lipase to wild-type GPIHBP1. In lane 5, preincubation of cells with plasma 
obtained from Patient 38 (1:20 dilution) blocked lipoprotein lipase binding. In lane 6, the 
GPIHBP1-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) RG3 (20 μg per milliliter) also blocked the 
binding of lipoprotein lipase to wild-type GPIHBP1. In lane 2, mutant W109S was included 
as a control. Panel B shows an immunocytochemical study indicating that the binding of 
immunoglobulins (green) in plasma samples obtained from Patients 102 and 111 blocked the 
binding of lipoprotein lipase (red) to GPIHBP1-expressing cells (blue). Under the same 
conditions, the immunoglobulins in a control plasma sample from Patient 3 did not block 
binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1-transfected cells. Cells expressing the W109S 
mutant did not bind lipoprotein lipase. DNA was stained with DAPI (yellow).

 Figure 5. Blocking of Binding of Lipoprotein Lipase to GPIHBP1 by Autoantibodies in a Dose-
Dependent Manner
Panel A shows the results of a solid-phase assay of binding of lipoprotein lipase to 
GPIHBP1 (see Methods Section S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Briefly, ELISA plates 
were coated with the monoclonal antibody R24 and incubated with uPAR-tagged human 
GPIHBP1, followed by an overnight incubation with serial dilutions of human plasma 
samples or the GPIHBP1-specific monoclonal antibody RE3. The next day, after incubating 
the plates with V5-tagged human lipoprotein lipase, the amount of GPIHBP1-bound 
lipoprotein lipase was detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled V5 antibody 
and compared with the amount of bound lipoprotein lipase in the absence of human plasma 
or monoclonal antibody RE3 (set at 100% binding). These ELISA studies showed that 
GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in the plasma of six adult patients with chylomicronemia (Patients 
38, 101, 102, 111, 157, and 164) and the plasma of an infant of Patient 102 (Patient 103) 
blocked binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1, as did the monoclonal antibody RE3. 
(The 1:1 dilution for monoclonal antibody RE3 corresponds to 20 μg per milliliter.) A 
control plasma sample did not block binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1. Panel B 
shows the amount of IgG binding to GPIHBP1 for each of the dilutions tested in Panel A. 
Plasma samples obtained from Patients 38, 102, and 157 had the highest titers of GPIHBP1 
autoantibody.

 Figure 6. Normal Lipolysis and Defective Triglyceride Processing in the GPIHBP1-Autoantibody 
Syndrome
Panel A shows normal intravascular processing of triglycerides in a healthy person, and 
Panel B shows defective triglyceride processing in a patient with the GPIHBP1-autoantibody 
syndrome. Normally, the lipoprotein lipase that is secreted by parenchymal cells (e.g., 
adipocytes and myocytes) is captured by GPIHBP1 on the basolateral surface of endothelial 
cells. GPIHBP1 then transports lipoprotein lipase across endothelial cells to the capillary 
lumen, where the lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes triglycerides in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins 
(e.g., very-low-density lipoproteins and chylomicrons). GPIHBP1 autoantibodies block the 
binding of lipoprotein lipase to GPIHBP1 and therefore block the transport of lipoprotein 
lipase to the capillary lumen, resulting in an accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in 
the plasma (hypertriglyceridemia). HSPG denotes heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and TRL 
triglyceride-rich lipoprotein.
