Abstract 
 
 
Aim of the study: The introduction of a paediatric Medical Emergency Team (pMET) was 
accompanied by weekly in-situ simulation team training. Key ward staff participated in team 
training, focusing on recognition of the deteriorating child, teamwork and early involvement 
of senior staff. Following an earlier study,1 this investigation aimed to evaluate the long-term 
impact of ongoing regular team training on hospital response to deteriorating ward patients, 
patient outcome and financial implications.  
Methods: Prospective cohort study of all deteriorating in-patients in a tertiary paediatric 
hospital requiring admission to paediatric intensive care (PICU) the year before, 1 year after 
and 3 years after the introduction of pMET and team training.  
Results: deteriorating patients were recognised more promptly (before/1year after/3years 
after pMET; median time 4/1.5/0.5 h, p<0.001), more often reviewed by consultants 
(45%/76%/81%, p<0.001) and more rapidly escalated to PICU (median time 10.5/5/3.5 h, 
p=0.02). There was a significant reduction in associated PICU admissions (56/51/32, p=0.02) 
and PICU bed days (527/336/193, p<0.001). The total annual cost of training (£74,250) was 
more than offset by savings from reduced PICU bed days (£801,600 per annum). Introduction 
of pMET coincided with significantly reduced hospital mortality (p< 0.001).  
Conclusion: These results indicate that lessons learnt by ward staff during team training led to 
sustained improvements in the hospital response to critically deteriorating in-patients, 
significantly improved patient outcomes and substantial savings. Integration of regular in-situ 
simulation training of medical emergency teams, including key ward staff, in routine clinical 
care has potential application in all acute specialties.

1.  Introduction 
Response to deteriorating patients is critically important for patient safety and a significant 
marker of quality of care. 
Professional efforts to improve this response have focused on the recognition of 
patient deterioration (afferent limb) and the subsequent escalation of care, often involving 
Medical Emergency Teams (MET; efferent limb). Recent publications highlight the 
importance of human factors and ward culture for effective escalation of care. 
Communication limited by intra- and inter-professional hierarchies, ineffective team 
leadership and expectations of an adverse response by senior staff following activation of 
escalation procedures were identified as barriers,2,3  whereas an explicit “permission to act” 
for clinical staff appeared to facilitate effective escalation.4  
Staff empowerment was described as a factor which increasingly enabled ward staff to 
activate medical emergency teams in a maturing MET system.5 Institutional changes in 
response to deteriorating patients include a cultural shift which needs time to develop6  and 
evaluation of such changes should include long-term studies. 
External courses have changed in recent years to include training in team leadership and 
effective communication.7 However, recent surveys of US and UK paediatric hospitals10,11 
confirmed there is little evidence institutions focus on regular in-situ training of medical 
emergency teams or ward staff dealing with deteriorating patients.8,9 The costs associated 
with long-term in-situ training programmes may have been a barrier to their establishment. A 
cost benefit analysis, identified as an important topic for research,12,13 should include 
consideration of additional costs to health care providers due to failings in the rescue of 
deteriorating patients.14  
An earlier study reported on the introduction of weekly in-situ simulation training for pMET.1 
Registrars and senior nurses from all hospital wards were included in team training on a 
rotational basis, thereby exposing key decision makers on hospital wards to regular training 
in the recognition and management of deteriorating patients. Review of unplanned in-house 
admissions to PICU demonstrated a significantly accelerated response to patient 
deterioration, a trend towards fewer unplanned PICU admissions and improved PICU 
outcomes. 
This study aimed to evaluate:   
   - whether the improvements in hospital response to evolving critical illness and subsequent 
patient outcome were sustained 3 years after the start of regular team training 
 
 
   - the financial implications of team training and potential cost benefits. 
 
2.  Methods 
All unplanned admissions of paediatric in-patients to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit 
(PICU) were prospectively audited for three 1 year periods: 1 year before; 1 year after; and 3 
years after introduction of pMET and weekly ongoing team training. 
Patient deterioration was defined as a breach of physiological criteria or documented 
staff concerns (local adaptation of previously published criteria).15 Time from onset of patient 
deterioration to first staff response and time from first staff response to PICU admission were 
 recorded. Actions categorised as staff response were prospectively identified to analyse ward 
management of evolving critical illness: increased frequency of nursing observations; medical 
review including seniority of reviewer; patient transfer to high dependency care prior to PICU 
admission. Outcomes in intensive care included severity of illness at PICU admission (PIM2 
score)16; length of PICU stay; PICU mortality. 
Depending on the time of onset of patient deterioration: normal working hours, Monday 
to Friday 9 am to 5 pm, versus all other hours of the week, further analysis was undertaken to 
demonstrate any impact of ward staffing and changes to staffing over time. Supported by NHS 
Lothian finance department, costs for team training were calculated; any savings generated as a 
result of enhanced training were calculated based on recently published UK data for costs of 
paediatric intensive care beds.17,18 
 
2.1. Study design 
The multi-disciplinary paediatric pMET had an extended remit to respond to 
physiological deterioration, staff concerns and resuscitation calls. Team availability was around 
the clock; team composition was six medical and nursing staff from Emergency Medicine (1), 
PICU (2), and paediatric wards (3). 
Simultaneously, weekly team training was started. All team members attended training 
on a rotational basis, resulting in four to ten attendances per year. During training, team 
members assumed the same roles as in clinical practice. Training, initially provided in a clinical 
skills setting, moved increasingly into clinical areas (medical and surgical wards, emergency 
department). Medium fidelity paediatric (Laerdal MegaCode Kid Vital Sim Advanced) and 
infant (Laerdal ALS Baby) manikins were used. 
Two trainers, one consultant and one senior nurse, facilitated each training session. All 
trainers were senior staff from different departments of our institution: PICU, Emergency 
Medicine, Medical Paediatrics, Paediatric Anaesthesia and Resuscitation Training. Regular 
reviews of pMET calls and unplanned PICU admissions were used to identify topics for team 
training. Scenarios included deteriorating medical and surgical patients in paediatric wards and 
in the Emergency Department, paediatric trauma and adult visitors; each training session lasted 
2 hours. 
Debriefing focused on: a supportive attitude towards ward staff; recognition of the 
deteriorating child; role allocation and communication within the team; early involvement of 
senior staff; early liaison with paediatric intensive care. 
Time for training was protected, resulting in attendance rates of > 95%. The study was 
approved by the hospital quality improvement team and did not require individual patient 
consent. 25% of case notes were randomly selected for review by a second examiner to assess 
inter-rater variability. Statistical analysis included Chi Square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-
Whitney U test and Anova test to detect statistical significance (p<0.05; IBM SPSS Statistics 
22 (2013). Confidence intervals were calculated using “Confidence Interval Analysis Version 
2.1.2.”. There was no significant difference in age and gender distribution over the 3 study 
periods (ANOVA, p=0.90).  
 
3.  Results 
 
3.1. Ward management of deteriorating in-patients with evolving critical illness 
Changes from year pre pMET to year 1 post pMET implementation: 
 
Hospital response to deteriorating ward patients, as detailed in Table 1 and fully 
discussed in a previous publication,1 improved significantly from the year pre pMET to year 1 
 after pMET implementation. The number of deteriorating ward patients requiring PICU 
admission did not change significantly. 
 
Changes from year 1 to year 3 post pMET implementation: 
 
There was further significant improvement in the early response to patient deterioration 
as demonstrated by the reduced time from patient deterioration to first staff response (Table 1). 
Subsequent aspects of the management of evolving critical illness, including consultant review 
and the time required to escalate support to PICU admission, showed further consolidation of 
earlier improvements, but no further significant changes. 
Analysing which factors triggered the first staff response to patient deterioration (Table 
2), it is noticeable that the frequency in breaches of physiological criteria remained relatively 
constant. Staff concerns, however, were raised significantly more often in the third year. 
 
The time of onset of patient deterioration was relevant for staff response. Significant 
further improvements from year 1 to year 3 post pMET implementation were only seen in the 
early staff response during the out-of-hours period. In year 3, the median time from patient 
deterioration to first staff response during the out-of-hours period equalled that observed during 
normal working hours (Table 3). The time for subsequent escalation to PICU continued to trend 
down during the out-of-hours period, however, it did not reach the low levels demonstrated 
during working hours. Impact of staffing and the role of team training will be considered in the 
discussion section.  
The number of deteriorating ward patients requiring PICU admission reduced 
significantly over the entire study period (Table 1); interestingly, the main reduction occurred 
in patients who started to deteriorate out-of-hours (Table 3).  
The majority of unplanned PICU admissions continued to be admitted without 
involvement of pMET (53/56 vs. 40/51 vs. 30/32). The earlier improvements to deteriorating 
ward patients were sustained or showed further significant improvements in year 3, even if 
pMET was not involved at any stage (Table 1).  
Second review of 25% of cases demonstrated a high level of inter-rater agreement of at 
least 89% in all parameters. 
 
3.2. Patient outcome in Paediatric Intensive Care and hospital mortality 
There was a significant reduction in the number of unplanned PICU admissions from 
deteriorating ward patients over the entire study period (Table 4). The number of related PICU 
bed days significantly reduced year on year.  There was a trend towards reduced severity of 
illness on PICU admission (PIM2 score) and reduced average length of PICU stay (9.9/7.8/6.4 
days). There was a trend towards reduced PICU mortality (7/53 vs. 2/43 vs. 2/30). 
A significant reduction in overall hospital mortality co-incided with the introduction 
of pMET and team training (p<0.001, Chi Square test; Figure 1).  
 
3.3. Financial implications of team training 
Costs for training included staffing for the multi-disciplinary faculty (£ 46,800 per 
annum (pa): preparation of training sessions, 48 two-hourly core training sessions, faculty 
meetings, review of pMET calls and unplanned PICU admissions, administrative support), 
protected training time for attendees (£17,450 pa), consumables and maintenance of manikins 
(£10,000 pa), resulting in a total cost for training of £74,250 pa. Previously acquired medium 
fidelity paediatric manikins were used (original costs: £6,200; today’s costs including monitor 
and tablet: £9,200).There were no additional capital costs.  
 As demonstrated, the number of PICU bed days associated with unplanned admissions 
from deteriorating ward patients reduced significantly. Using the average of recently published 
data for costs of paediatric intensive care beds in the UK ,17,18 this equated to a reduction of 
associated costs by £801,600 pa (334 PICU bed days *£2,400).  
 
4.  Discussion 
 
4.1. Response to deteriorating patients at ward level and patient outcome 
This study demonstrated sustained significant improvement in ward response to 
deteriorating in-patients following introduction of a paediatric MET with weekly ongoing in-
situ team training. The improved response was not limited to cases where pMET was directly 
involved, but also demonstrable in the majority of unplanned intensive care admissions 
without pMET attendance. Team training regularly exposed all ward-based decision makers 
to recognition and management of the deteriorating child, suggesting that lessons learnt 
during team training were applied to all deteriorating ward patients with evolving critical 
illness. 
In addition to earlier improvements,1 this study demonstrated further significant 
reduction in the time from patient deterioration to first staff response; staff concerns were 
significantly more often the trigger for early escalation, suggesting empowerment of ward 
staff. Over the entire study period, the number of deteriorating ward patients requiring 
subsequent PICU admission reduced significantly. A significant reduction in hospital 
mortality, which co-incided with the introduction of pMET and team training, was sustained.  
 
4.2. Importance of team training and human factors 
Human factors are principal contributors to suboptimal outcomes in health care, 
particularly when multi-disciplinary teams face challenging situations in communication and 
teamwork under pressure.19 By integrating key medical and nursing ward staff into pMET 
and team training, the management of evolving critical illness ceased to be the exclusive 
provenance of specialist critical care and emergency medicine expertise. This is in 
accordance with literature recommendations to integrate team training and crisis resource 
management into routine clinical care, allowing ongoing education and skill sharing.20,21  
The changes observed in this study cannot be a direct effect of actions only by pMET 
as significant improvements remained demonstrable even if the team was not involved at any 
stage. All changes were in keeping with practice taught at team training: focus on early 
response to physiological deterioration and concerns; early involvement of senior staff across 
traditional departmental boundaries; early escalation to PICU care.  
In the third year after introduction of pMET training, significant improvements in the 
early response to deterioration stand out. This aspect is primarily dependant on junior ward 
staff, a staff group which frequently reported barriers to escalation in the literature. 22 Barriers 
identified were experience or expectations of an adverse response by senior staff to raising 
concerns and to initiating escalation or the impression that ward staff “should have been able 
to cope independently”. 3, 23 Interestingly, “subjective” staff concerns were, in contrast to 
“objective” physiological breach criteria, significantly more often the trigger for escalation in 
the third year. This suggests that lessons learnt by more senior staff during team training were 
increasingly adopted by more junior ward staff, following observed positive responses to 
earlier advanced escalation, reinforcing this shifting culture within our institution. This is 
consistent with recent publications describing more frequent escalation of care based on staff 
concerns in maturing response systems.5 The explicit “permission to act” and awareness that 
 staff escalating care are backed by the organisation have been reported as factors which help 
to overcome barriers to escalation.4  
In addition to reasons identified earlier,1 four factors appear to have had particular 
importance for the demonstrated improvements: 
1) Training faculty: consultants from all major hospital departments are part of the 
training faculty, bringing clinical credibility and local knowledge to the training, attributes 
previously described as first priorities when trying to institute and sustain change in a clinical 
environment.24,25 Participants are reassured that responses adopted from team training (e.g. 
asking a non-resident consultant to attend out-of-hours) will be supported by senior staff 
when applied in clinical practice. Additionally, consultant trainers act as ambassadors for the 
training programme within their own departments, increasing acceptance of 
practices/attitudes taught during training. Consequently, and in contrast to other quality 
improvement initiatives, 4 medical staff were equally as engaged as nursing staff. 
2) Regularity of training: Infrequent training of individuals carries the risk of 
producing a sub-threshold learning effect which will not lead to sustained change of 
practice.26 This observation is consistent with a recent systematic review of the effectiveness 
of education in the recognition and management of deteriorating patients: an intervention 
with a single study day for staff did not lead to changes in clinical outcomes, however, there 
were significant differences when training was provided on a regular basis.10 
3) Feedback loop: Learning points from reviews of unplanned admissions to PICU 
and pMET calls are incorporated into subsequent team training sessions, allowing focus on 
factors relevant to local practice. This is in keeping with studies recommending that 
simulation educators make best use of real patient information to guide the content of 
simulation training 27 and to identify latent safety threats. 28,29 
 
4) Building relationships: medical emergency teams are described as loosely coupled 
due to the daily changing team composition, leaving team members little opportunity to 
develop team skills or relationships.30 Interestingly, comments from training participants 
suggest they not only learned about the team approach to patient deterioration, but also used 
team training as an opportunity to build trust and reciprocity with staff from different 
departments. Improving relationships as a social return of investment has been described as 
an underused and undervalued concept in the literature.31  
 
 A systematic review of early warning systems and emergency response teams  
concluded that the sustainability of either approach was dependent on continued review of the 
activation process and an associated ongoing education programme.32 The results from this 
study, which identified significant changes in clinical practice and patient outcome, thereby 
fulfilling level 3 and 4 in the Kirkpatrick model of evaluation of training programmes,33 
support this conclusion.  
 
4.3. Cost/Benefit Analysis 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a significant return from investment 
in regular in-situ simulation training of a multi-disciplinary Medical Emergency Team. 
Savings from the associated costs of PICU bed days substantially exceeded the costs of 
regular team training. The calculated savings are likely to provide a conservative estimate as 
it is reasonable to assume that patients with a lower severity of illness score on PICU 
admission and a reduced length of PICU stay would also have a shorter subsequent hospital 
stay; however, this study did not include post-PICU outcomes. 
A recent systematic review found that few studies on in-situ simulation training 
provide return of investment information but several small trials have demonstrated return of 
investment from specific training interventions for individual practice.34,35, 36 Associated 
savings due to reduced institutional insurance premiums have been reported in hospitals 
 establishing simulation team training for high risk areas of medicine (obstetrics, 
anaesthesia).37 Failing to rescue deteriorating patients has been demonstrated to incur 
substantial additional costs for health care providers;38 conversely, improving response to 
evolving critical illness, as demonstrated in this study, is likely to carry significant financial 
benefits.  
 
4.4. Limitations 
This observational cohort study cannot inform directly on cause and effect, as many 
uncontrolled variables may have had an effect on outcome. It is therefore not possible to 
conclude that the improved response to deteriorating ward patients caused the reduction in 
hospital mortality. The relatively small sample size and low underlying mortality rate in 
paediatric intensive care limited the ability to detect significant differences in PICU 
mortality.  
During the first year following pMET introduction, medical paediatrics moved to a 
consultant of the week system, with a consultant paediatrician available at all times during 
working hours. This change probably contributed to the increase of consultants reviewing 
deteriorating patients during working hours, but is unlikely to have influenced the significant 
improvements in early ward response before consultant involvement. Additionally, there 
were significant improvements in the out-of-hours response in year 1 post pMET with no 
changes to the out-of-hours service cover.  
Between year 1 post pMET and year 3 post pMET, the seniority of the out-of-hours 
resident medical paediatric cover increased to senior registrar level. There was subsequently 
no significant change in the late response to patient deterioration out-of-hours (when these 
more senior doctors became involved), but significant improvements in the early response by 
more junior ward staff (and no changes to junior staffing), suggesting an impact of team 
training. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that regular team training made a major 
contribution to the documented clinical and financial benefits. Further studies in adult cohorts 
are merited. 
 
 
4.5. Conclusions 
 
Weekly in-situ team training for a paediatric Medical Emergency Team, with an 
emphasis on recognition of the deteriorating child, communication, teamwork and early 
involvement of senior staff, resulted in improved response by ward staff to evolving critical 
illness and improved patient outcome in intensive care. Costs associated with the introduction 
and maintenance of the training programme were more than offset by a significant reduction 
in the number of associated intensive care bed days. Improvements were maintained or 
enhanced over a three-year period. Integration of regular in-situ simulation team training has 
the potential to offer sustainable improvements beyond paediatrics and merits further 
evaluation in a larger patient population.
