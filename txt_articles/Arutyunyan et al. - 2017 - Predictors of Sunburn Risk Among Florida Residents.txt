T
he incidence of skin cancer in the United States increased from 2002 to 2011.1 
It is now the most common cancer in the country, with 5 million people receiv-
ing treatment each year.2 Even more concerning is the rise in the incidence 
 
of melanoma, the type of skin cancer that carries the highest morbidity and mortality.1,3 
Skin cancer rates are elevated in states such as Florida, where the level of ultraviolet 
radiation (UVR) is among the highest in the country.4,5 In the United States, the annual

Context: The incidence of skin cancer, the most common type of cancer in the United 
States, is increasing. Sunburn is a major modifiable risk factor for skin cancer, and its 
prevalence among the US population is high.
Objectives: To identify predictors of having had a red or painful sunburn in the past 
12 months among people living in Florida.
Methods: Florida residents were recruited from public places and online. They were 
asked to complete an anonymous cross-sectional survey that assessed demographic 
information, dermatologic history, as well as knowledge, attitude, and behavior factors 
associated with sunburn. 
Results: A total of 437 participants whose data were complete for all variables were 
included in the multivariate analysis. In multivariate logistic regression, younger 
age (18-29 years) was the most significant predictor of sunburn (OR, 15.26; 95% CI, 
5.97-38.98; P<.001). Other significant predictors included identifying as nonwhite 
(OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90; P<.02), having had a full-body skin examination by a 
physician (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.03-3.14; P<.04), reporting higher levels of skin sen-
sitivity to the sun (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 2.07-10.34; P<.001), having a less favorable 
attitude toward sun protection (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.94; P<.001), having high 
perceived vulnerability to skin cancer (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.41; P<.009), and 
spending less than 1 hour outside between 10 am and 4 pm on weekends (OR, 0.46; 
95% CI, 0.22-0.96; P<.04). The model was statistically significant at P<.001 and 
correctly classified 78% of participants.
Conclusions: Sunburn prevention programs that osteopathic physicians can read-
ily implement in clinical practice are urgently needed, particularly for young adult 
patients. This study identified 7 predictors of sunburn in Florida residents. With ad-
ditional research findings, promoting attitude change toward sun protection may be a 
viable strategy.

Analyses of national surveys are limited to the vari-
ables available in the datasets. These surveys did not 
measure knowledge and attitudinal factors associated 
with skin cancer and sun protective behaviors, sun 
exposure during the key hours of 10 am to 4 pm, or 
whether respondents had their skin examined by a 
physician or had done it themselves.
 
Because sunburn is preventable, it is critical to mea-
sure attitudinal and behavioral measures when exam-
ining the predictors of sunburn. Not only will this 
knowledge advance our basic understanding of the bar-
riers to sun protection, but, more importantly, it will also 
contribute to the development of preventive interven-
tions. This approach has been successfully used to 
modify other health-related behaviors, such as per-
forming Pap smears and colonoscopies to screen for 
cervical and colorectal cancer, respectively, and pro-
moting exercise and a healthy diet to potentially reduce 
cardiovascular disease and prevent cancer.15-17 Although 
studies have included behavioral measures,13,14 few have 
measured attitudinal factors. Rather than focusing on 
modifiable behaviors directly relevant to sunburn, such 
as use of sunscreen or hours spent in the sun, these 
studies assessed other less directly related behaviors, 
such as binge drinking and obesity. 
 
The goal of the current study was to examine a more 
comprehensive set of factors associated with sunburn in 
a community sample of Florida residents as an initial 
step toward the development and implementation of in-
terventions to prevent sunburn. This study extends past 
research by assessing dermatologically relevant vari-
ables, as well as knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors 
with regard to skin cancer and sun protection. 
Methods
From February to April 2015, we recruited people from 
public places (eg, beaches, coffee shops, libraries, streets, 
university campuses) and online (e-mails, listservs, and 
posts on social media) to complete a 20-minute anony-
cost of treating patients with skin cancer is estimated at 
$8.1 billion.1 Although it represents less than 2% of all 
cases of skin cancer, melanoma causes the majority of 
skin cancer deaths, and the cost of treating patients with 
melanoma exceeds $3 billion annually.2 The annual pro-
ductivity losses are estimated at $3.8 billion.6 Skin cancer 
has become such a major public health issue that the 
 
US Surgeon General issued the first-ever Call to Action to 
Prevent Skin Cancer in 2014, urging all levels of society 
 
to mount efforts to prevent the disease.7 Osteopathic 
physicians have historically played an important role in 
disease prevention and should be able to contribute greatly 
to the efforts in decreasing the incidence of skin cancer.
 
A number of well-established risk factors for skin 
cancer have been reported. These include male sex, 
fair skin and hair, freckling, history of sunburn, 
common or atypical nevi, personal or family history 
 
of melanoma, and UVR exposure from sunlight or 
tanning beds.2,8 Among the modifiable (ie, nongenetic) 
risk factors, sunburn is easily preventable.9 The risk of 
melanoma nearly doubles for people with a history 
 
of sunburn,8-10 and 86% of melanomas can be attributed 
to exposure to UVR from the sun.11 The risk of sun-
burn is particularly high among people who live in 
states such as Florida, which has a high percentage of 
sunny days and where many have prolonged sun expo-
sure during recreation at beaches.12
 
Despite the salience of sunburn to skin cancer risk, 
a limited number of studies have examined the factors 
associated with sunburn, a necessary first step toward 
developing preventive interventions. Two of the more 
important studies are secondary analyses of nationally 
representative US-based cross-sectional surveys.13,14 
Sunburn in the past 12 months was significantly as-
sociated with younger age, higher income, higher 
levels of education, and recent binge drinking.13,14 Its 
association with white race, more sensitive skin type, 
family history of melanoma, being physically active, 
being overweight/obese, tanning indoors, and con-
suming alcohol was also statistically significant.14

mous cross-sectional survey on paper or online after 
screening for eligibility. Eligible participants were those 
who resided in Florida, were aged 18 years or older, and 
spoke and understood English. Nova Southeastern Uni-
versity’s institutional review board approved the pro-
tocol as exempt in January 2015.
 
All eligible participants were informed that by com-
pleting the survey they were providing consent. At the 
end of the survey, participants were invited to provide an 
unlinked e-mail address to be entered into a raffle of 3 
iPod Nano devices (Apple). Participants who completed 
the paper form wrote their e-mail address on a separate 
page; online participants were redirected to a different 
website to submit their e-mail address. 
Survey
The researchers compiled 79 questions from the set of 
core items developed by Glanz et al18 and other questions 
found in the literature.19,20 The survey was pilot tested 
 
for comprehension and readability on 10 participants. 
The following areas were assessed:
■ Demographic characteristics. Participants 
reported their age, sex, race, education, and 
employment. The large age range of the  
respondents was collapsed into 3 age categories 
(18-29, 30-59, and ≥60 years). 
■ Dermatologic factors. Participants selected  
1 of 6 options to represent their skin’s sensitivity  
to the sun using responses that ranged from  
1 (“always burns, never tans”) to 6 (“never  
burns, tans very easily”). To facilitate analyses, 
these responses were collapsed into 3 categories 
(1, always or usually burns; 2, sometimes mildly 
or rarely burns; and 3, very rarely or never burns). 
They also reported the average number of  
hours spent outside from 10 am to 4 pm on 
weekdays and weekends, whether they had 
ever used tanning beds or had a full-body skin 
examination performed by a physician  
or themselves, and their personal and family  
history of skin cancer. 
■ Knowledge. For each of 18 items, participants 
responded whether the item was true or false. 
Sample items included: “You cannot get sunburned 
on a cloudy day” or “Sunscreen should be reapplied 
every 2 hours.” The number of correct responses 
was summed to calculate a knowledge score.
■ Attitudinal factors. Using a 5-point Likert  
scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to  
5 (strongly agree), participants reported how 
strongly they agreed or disagreed with items  
related to skin cancer risk and sun protection. 
Sample items included “I think it is important  
to protect myself from the sun” and “I worry  
about getting skin cancer.” 
■ Sun protective behaviors. Participants reported  
the frequency with which they engaged in  
9 behaviors using a 5-point Likert scale ranging 
from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Sample items  
included “How often do you avoid the sun during 
the hours of 10 am to 4 pm?” and “How often  
do you wear sunscreen when you are outdoors?”  
A sum score was calculated for use in the analysis; 
the higher the score, the greater the engagement  
in sun-protective behaviors.
■ Sunburn history. Participants reported the  
number of red or painful sunburns they had in 
the past 12 months. Because few respondents 
reported more than 2, the data were collapsed into  
2 categories: 0 (no sunburns) and 1 (≥1 sunburn). 
The dichotomous variable was used as the 
dependent variable in the analyses. 
 
Statistical Analysis
Because the internal consistency (Cronbach α) of the 
attitudinal items was low, a principal component anal-
ysis was conducted. Examining the scree plot and the 
eigenvalues of the factors led to the selection of a 
3-factor solution. This solution placed eigenvalues for 
each factor above 1.0. These factors were then exam-
ined from an internal consistency and theoretical stand-
point, and final subscale grouping for ambiguous items 
loading on multiple factors were made based on the

strongest conceptual grouping. Items with poor reli-
ability were trimmed, as well as items deemed redun-
dant with other items. Three subscales were then 
constructed with associated Cronbach α and named 
factor 1: awareness of skin cancer risk (α=.70); factor 2: 
attitudes toward sun protection (α=.70); and factor 3: 
perceived vulnerability to skin cancer (α=.50). Higher 
scores were associated with stronger agreement. 
 
Variable computations and statistical analyses were 
performed using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM). 
 
Descriptive statistics and measures of central ten-
dency were used to examine sample characteristics. 
Prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of 
participants reporting sunburn by the total sample. 
 
Bivariate analyses were then conducted to examine the 
association between sunburn and the predictor variables 
(age, sex, race, education, employment, sensitivity of 
skin to sun, hours spent outside between 10 am and 4 pm 
on weekdays and weekends, use of tanning beds, full-
body skin examination by self or physician, personal or 
family member skin cancer diagnosis, knowledge score, 
awareness of skin cancer risk, attitudes toward sun 
 
protection, perceived vulnerability to skin cancer, and 
behavior score). χ2 analyses were used for categorical 
variables, and correlational analyses were conducted for 
the continuous variables. All variables significantly 
 
associated with the outcome at P<.05 were included in the 
multivariate logistic regression analysis. As per Hosmer 
and Lemeshow, theoretically relevant variables that 
 
approached significance at P=.10 were also included.21
Results
Of 619 Florida residents who were recruited, 437 
(70.6%) whose data were complete for all variables 
were included in the multivariate analysis. Missing 
data were random; no patterns for missing data were 
identified. The characteristics of the sample are pre-
sented in Table 1. The mean age of the sample was 
40.7 years (range, 18-92 years; median, 34 years). 
More than 50% of the sample was white, employed, 
and college educated. The sample comprised 205 men

(33.1%) and 412 women (66.6%). Two hundred thirty-
one (37%) reported having had a red or painful sun-
burn that lasted a day or more in the past 12 months, 
and 265 (43%) reported having had a full-body skin 
examination by a physician. A previous diagnosis of 
any type of skin cancer was reported by 79 partici-
pants (12.8%), and melanoma was reported by 12 par-
ticipants (2.75%). Participants had relatively strong 
knowledge regarding skin cancer and sun protection 
and awareness of skin cancer risk. Attitudes toward 
sun protection and perceived vulnerability to skin 
cancer were not as strong.
 
At the bivariate level, age, race, employment, skin 
sensitivity to the sun, hours spent outside between 
 
10 am and 4 pm on weekdays and weekends, use of tan-
ning beds, having had a full-body skin examination 
conducted by a physician, having a personal history of 
skin cancer, having a family history of skin cancer, at-
titudes toward sun protection, and perceived vulnera-
bility to skin cancer were statistically significantly 
associated with sunburn. All were entered into the lo-
gistic regression analyses.
 
The final multivariate logistic regression model is 
presented in Table 2. The associations of sunburn at the 
multivariate level with younger age, identifying as non-
white, having had a full-body skin examination by a 
clinician, reporting higher levels of skin sensitivity to 
the sun, having less favorable attitudes toward sun pro-
tection, and having high perceived vulnerability to skin 
cancer were statistically significant. Participants who 
were aged 18 to 29 years were 15.3 times more likely 
and those aged 30 to 59 years were 5.82 times more 
likely to have been sunburned in the past 12 months 
than those aged 60 years or older. Participants with 
more favorable attitudes toward sun protection were 
0.88 times less likely to have been sunburned than 
those with less favorable attitudes. Those with higher 
perceived vulnerability to skin cancer were 1.21 times 
more likely to have been sunburned than those with 
lower perceived vulnerability. The model was statisti-
cally significant at P<.001 and correctly classified 
 
341 participants (78%).

sunburn protection that can be incorporated as part of 
routine clinical care could be developed. Messages 
from osteopathic physicians through texts, social 
media, or websites to disseminate this information to 
their patients may also be effective.
 
Interestingly, being nonwhite was a statistically 
significant predictor of sunburn. It could be that 
 
nonwhite participants may think that their darker skin 
protects them from sunburn and as a result do not prac-
tice sun-protective behaviors. Several dermatologically 
relevant factors, including skin sensitivity to the sun 
and having had a full-body skin examination by a 
 
physician were significantly associated with sunburn. 
Whereas some might argue that a full-body skin exami-
nation might reflect a tendency to engage in preventive 
behaviors overall and consequently should be inversely 
related to sunburn, it could also be that having had a 
severe sunburn might have prompted some participants 
Discussion
The American Osteopathic Association has identified 
 
5 research focus areas that would have the greatest po-
tential to affect patient care and demonstrate the value 
osteopathic physicians offer in these areas.22 One focus 
area encompasses prevention, diagnosis, and manage-
ment of diseases with high public health impact and for 
which osteopathic approaches can lead to improve-
ments in patient outcomes and reduction in health care 
costs.22 As rates of skin cancer continue to increase, it is 
important to launch directed efforts to prevent its occur-
rence. A possible approach is to develop tailored inter-
ventions that target modifiable risk factors such as 
sunburns. Identifying factors associated with sunburn, 
as reported in the current paper, is a critical first step 
toward the development of interventions. 
 
The 37% prevalence of sunburn in our sample mir-
rors national prevalence estimates.13,14 Prevalence rates 
for men (38.7%) and women (36.9%) were comparable 
in the current study; thus, no statistically significant bi-
variate differences by sex were found. It was surprising 
that neither knowledge nor engagement in sun protective 
behaviors was significantly associated with sunburn at 
the bivariate level. The association between knowledge 
and sunburn could have been attenuated, considering that 
the content of the knowledge items did not exclusively 
focus on sunburn prevention and other sun protective 
behaviors but also assessed knowledge of skin cancer. 
However, this was not the case for behaviors because the 
items directly assessed behaviors that would protect 
against sunburn.
 
Similar to previous reports,13,14 younger age was 
 
the most statistically significant predictor of sunburn 
 
in the multivariate model. This consistent finding is 
particularly troubling given that melanoma is the most 
common type of all cancers for people aged 25 to 
 
29 years and the second most common type of cancer 
for people aged 15 to 29 years.23 It also suggests that 
existing sunburn prevention efforts are not reaching 
those most at risk, which points to the importance of 
developing prevention messages and programs tailored 
specifically to young adults. Innovative apps promoting

Conclusion
The current study examined dermatologically relevant 
factors, as well as sunburn-specific knowledge, atti-
tudes, and behaviors, in a sample that, by virtue of 
living in Florida, is at increased risk of sunburn. The 
findings highlight the urgency of developing tailored 
sunburn prevention programs, particularly aimed at 
young adults, who are at greatest risk. The link between 
attitudinal factors and sunburn history suggests that 
such programs might benefit from promoting changes 
in attitudes. An important focus of future research 
would be the development of standardized attitudinal 
measures that could yield more nuanced understanding 
of the associations with sunburn risk so that improved 
prevention methods could be developed and incorpo-
rated as a routine part of clinical practice.

to ask their clinicians for full-body skin examinations. 
Because a cross-sectional assessment does not eluci-
date temporal associations, it is not possible to differen-
tiate whether the sunburn prompted the skin examination 
or whether negative results made patients overconfi-
dent. Neither lifetime history of using tanning beds nor 
having a personal or a family history of skin cancer 
 
diagnosis emerged as statistically significant predictors 
of sunburn in the final model. 
 
Two attitudinal factors (attitude toward sun protec-
tion and perceived vulnerability to skin cancer) re-
mained statistically significant in the final model. 
Participants with a less favorable attitude toward sun 
protection may not have strongly believed that sun-
protective behavior is an important part of maintaining 
healthy skin. Participants with high perceived vulnera-
bility to skin cancer may have been sunburned in the 
past but continue to get sunburned despite the risk of 
getting skin cancer. 
 
Because it is modifiable, attitude toward sunburn 
and sun protection may be an effective target to reduce 
sunburns. This factor has not received widespread 
 
attention, possibly because a reliable and valid attitu-
dinal measure related to sunburn and sun protection 
 
has yet to be developed. Constructing a reliable and 
valid attitudinal measure should be a research priority. 
 
The attitudinal measure used in the current study can be 
construed as an initial measurement step. All 3 factors 
had adequate internal consistency, which could be 
 
improved with item refinement and additional psycho-
metric testing. 
 
The cross-sectional design and the use of a conve-
nience sample are 2 limitations of the current study. De-
spite these limitations, the prevalence rate was 
comparable to national estimates, suggesting that our 
sample was sufficiently broad. Although the survey was 
designed using previously published items, it was not a 
standardized measure. Thus, the psychometric properties 
of the attitudinal items might have attenuated the strength 
of the association.
