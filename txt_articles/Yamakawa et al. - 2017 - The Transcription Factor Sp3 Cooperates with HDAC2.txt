SUMMARY
The histone deacetylase HDAC2, which negatively
regulates synaptic gene expression and neuronal
plasticity, is upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
patients and mouse models. Therapeutics targeting
HDAC2 hold promise for ameliorating AD-related
cognitive impairment; however, attempts to generate
HDAC2-specific inhibitors have failed. Here, we take
an integrative genomics approach to identify proteins
that mediate HDAC2 recruitment to synaptic plasticity
genes. Functional screening revealed that knock-
down of the transcription factor Sp3 phenocopied
HDAC2 knockdown and that Sp3 facilitated recruit-
ment of HDAC2 to synaptic genes. Importantly,
like HDAC2, Sp3 expression was elevated in AD pa-
tients and mouse models, where Sp3 knockdown
ameliorated synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, exo-
genous expression of an HDAC2 fragment containing
the Sp3-binding domain restored synaptic plasticity
and memory in a mouse model with severe neuro-
degeneration. Our findings indicate that targeting
the HDAC2-Sp3 complex could enhance cognitive
function without affecting HDAC2 function in other
processes.
INTRODUCTION
Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA and histone modifica-
tions, are critical modulators of transcriptional activity regulating
diverse biological processes (Jaenisch and Bird, 2003). Histone
acetylation
favors,
while
deacetylation
antagonizes,
gene
expression at loci throughout the genome (Eberharter and
Becker, 2002). Importantly, dynamic regulation of histone acety-
lation status is associated with synaptic plasticity and memory,
and numerous studies implicate both histone acetyltransferase
(HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes in various
cognitive processes (Alarco
´ n et al., 2004; Fischer et al., 2007;
Flavell and Greenberg, 2008; Korzus et al., 2004; Penney and
Tsai, 2014). Among histone-modifying enzymes, HDAC2 is a crit-
ical negative regulator of structural and functional plasticity in the
mammalian nervous system (Guan et al., 2009; Hanson et al.,
2013). HDAC2 localizes to the promoters of numerous synap-
tic-plasticity-associated genes, where it deacetylates histone
substrates (Gra
¨ ff et al., 2012; Guan et al., 2009). Consistently,
loss of HDAC2 or HDAC inhibitor treatments promotes synaptic
gene expression, long-term synaptic plasticity, and memory pro-
cesses, while HDAC2 overexpression has opposing effects
(Fischer et al., 2007; Gra
¨ ff et al., 2012, 2014; Guan et al., 2009;
Morris et al., 2013).
AlteredHDACfunctioncancontribute tonumerouspathological
states, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and various
forms of neurological dysfunction (Falkenberg and Johnstone,
2014).Notably,HDAC2 levelsare elevated inbothAlzheimer’sdis-
ease (AD) patient brains and in multiple mouse models of the dis-
ease (Gonzalez-Zun
˜ iga et al., 2014; Gra
¨ ff et al., 2012). In mouse
models of AD, HDAC2 upregulation results from both transcrip-
tional and post-transcriptional mechanisms and demonstrably
contributes to cognitive impairment; HDAC inhibitor treatments
and direct HDAC2 knockdown both result in striking recovery of
impaired cognitive functions (Gonzalez-Zun
˜ iga et al., 2014; Gra
¨ff
et al., 2012). As such, targeting HDAC2 holds promise as a thera-
peutictotreatthecognitivesymptomsofADaswellasanumberof
other neurological disorders.
A major hurdle, however, is the lack of specificity of current
HDAC inhibitor compounds. These compounds target the de-
acetylase catalytic domain, and a number of them exhibit selec-
tivity for the class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8) over class II, III,
and IV enzymes, but HDAC2-specific inhibitors have yet to be re-
ported. This lack of specificity is particularly problematic, given
the distinct, and sometimes opposing, functions of the different
HDAC enzymes (Dobbin et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2008; Wang
et al., 2013). Further complicating matters is the large number
of different chromatin-binding complexes that HDAC enzymes
can participate in (Bantscheff et al., 2011; Falkenberg and

 Johnstone, 2014). Indeed, HDAC2 and other HDACs often
interact with different binding partners and regulate distinct sub-
sets of genes depending on cell type, developmental stage, and
any number of other intrinsic or extrinsic signals (Bantscheff
et al., 2011; Falkenberg and Johnstone, 2014). Thus, the essen-
tial questions, when targeting HDAC2 for therapeutics, are which
HDAC2 complex(es) should be inhibited to enhance cognitive
function and whether these are distinguishable from the com-
plexes whose inhibition leads to the adverse side effects of
pan-HDAC inhibitors.
In an attempt to address these questions, we have taken an
innovative approach to target HDAC2 function: to identify and
disrupt its interaction with the DNA-binding proteins(s) respon-
sible for recruitment of HDAC2 to the promoters of synaptic-
plasticity-associated genes. Utilizing weighted gene co-expres-
sion network analysis (WGCNA), we identified putative HDAC2
co-regulators. Functional screening of the potential co-regula-
tors revealed that knockdown of the transcription factor Sp3
was similar to HDAC2 knockdown in its ability to facilitate syn-
aptic transmission. Consistent with a role in recruitment of
HDAC2 to target genes, knockdown of Sp3 was able to reduce
HDAC2 occupancy and increase histone acetylation at synaptic
gene promoters, as well as facilitating synaptic gene expres-
sion. Also, we found that, as with HDAC2, Sp3 expression
was elevated in the brain of a mouse model of AD-like neuro-
degeneration, as well as in AD patients. Importantly, exogenous
expression of an HDAC2 fragment containing the Sp3-binding
domain was able to counteract the synaptic plasticity and
memory defects found in an AD-like mouse model. Together,
these findings indicate that HDAC2 and Sp3 cooperate to regu-
late neuronal plasticity genes and provide proof of principle that
disruption of the HDAC2-Sp3 interaction is an effective strategy
to disrupt the synaptic-plasticity-suppressing functions of this
complex.
RESULTS
Identification of Potential HDAC2 Co-regulators through
WGCNA
HDACs, including HDAC2, associate with a number of different
chromatin-modifying complexes, each of which regulates multi-
ple processes within cells. To determine which binding partners
are essential for HDAC2 recruitment to genes involved in partic-
ular processes, we considered techniques other than classical
immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass spectrometry (MS).
IP-MS would indiscriminately identify all proteins bound to
HDAC2 and would be of limited value in pinpointing the specific
proteins that mediate recruitment of HDAC2 to genes involved in
synaptic plasticity. Due to these caveats, we utilized WGCNA.
Under the hypothesis that genes with similar expression patterns
often encode for interacting proteins or groups of proteins
involved in similar cellular processes, we applied WGCNA to
publicly available gene expression data from 187 healthy human
postmortem brains. As a pilot study, we first extracted a subset
of 28 individuals with ‘‘high’’ HDAC2 expression (greater than 1
SD above the mean) and 35 with ‘‘low’’ HDAC2 expression
(greater than 1 SD below the mean) and then performed unbi-
ased clustering of global gene expression (Figure S1A). With
few exceptions, this analysis reliably distinguished ‘‘high’’ from
‘‘low’’ HDAC2-expressing individuals, indicating that a gene
expression signature can be associated with HDAC2 levels.
Next, we tested whether this natural variation in HDAC2 gene
expression could be used to identify the HDAC2-binding part-
ners involved in synaptic plasticity. We, therefore, performed
WGCNA on the entire dataset (regardless of HDAC2 levels)
and identified the genes most tightly correlated or anti-corre-
lated with Hdac2 based on gene expression (Figure S1B). This
analysis revealed an HDAC2-containing module of 2,282 genes,
which included many genes encoding known HDAC2-binding
proteins. Based on gene ontology (GO) analysis, the list of
potential HDAC2 co-regulators was further narrowed down
to transcriptional repressors (as defined by the GO terms
‘‘histone
deacetylase
binding,’’
‘‘transcription
corepressor
activity,’’ ‘‘histone deacetylase activity,’’ and ‘‘transcription
repressor activity’’). Finally, we calculated the pairwise correla-
tion between the transcriptional repressors (including HDAC2)
and all the genes in the HDAC2 module to find the putative
HDAC2 co-regulators showing the same direction of correlation
as HDAC2 (Figure S1C). The consequent list of 22 candidates
included several genes encoding HDAC2-binding proteins as
previously reported, such as the DNA-binding proteins Sp3,
Tdp2, and Sap30 (Madabhushi et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2002;
Won et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 1998). The physical interaction
of Sp3 and Tdp2 with HDAC2 was confirmed through IP of
HDAC2 followed by western blotting using anti-Sp3 and anti-
Tdp2 antibodies (Figures 1A and S1D).

 Like HDAC2, Sp3 Negatively Regulates Synaptic
Function
HDACs, including HDAC2, cannot directly bind DNA, so we
focused our subsequent efforts on HDAC2-interacting proteins
that can bind DNA (Sp3, Sap30, and Ttrap/Tdp2). To aid in iden-
tifying whether these three proteins could be required for recruit-
ment of HDAC2 to synaptic genes, we next assessed the role of
each protein in regulating synaptic function.
We measured miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents
(mEPSCs) from cultured mouse primary neurons transduced
with shRNA (short hairpin RNA) targeting Hdac2, Sp3, Sap30,
or Ttrap (transduction with each shRNA resulted in greater than
50% reduction of mRNA; Figures S2A and S2B). As expected,
Hdac2 knockdown resulted in increased mEPSC amplitude
and frequency (Figure 1B). Interestingly, knockdown of Sp3
also increased average mEPSC amplitude and frequency (Fig-
ure 1B), while knockdown of Sap30 or Ttrap did not significantly
alter either parameter (Figure S2C). This facilitation of mEPSCs
by Sp3 knockdown was completely reversed by the expression
of an shRNA-resistant form of Sp3, confirming the specificity of
the effect (Figures 1C and S2D).
Sp3 Represses the Expression of Synaptic Genes via the
Recruitment of HDAC2
Since Sp3 binds to HDAC2, and depletion of Sp3 from mouse
primary neurons recapitulated the effect of HDAC2 knockdown
on mEPSCs, we next determined whether Sp3 and HDAC2
co-regulate synaptic gene expression in neurons. To do so, we
performed transcriptomic analysis through RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) from primary neurons transduced with control,
Hdac2, or Sp3 shRNA (with >50% reduction of each protein; Fig-
ures S3A–S3D). Supporting our hypothesis that HDAC2 and Sp3
are functionally similar, we found a statistically significant over-
lap of genes altered by knockdown of Hdac2 or Sp3 (Figure 1D)
(see
Supplemental
Experimental
Procedures).
Intriguingly,
genes involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal activities
were significantly enriched among the genes upregulated after
knockdown of either Hdac2 or Sp3 (Figure 1E). A number of
these changes in gene expression were validated by qRT-
PCR, including changes in the expression of subunits of potas-
sium channels, sodium channels, and synaptic membrane
proteins and receptors (Figures 1F–1H).
To examine whether the expression of genes co-regulated by
HDAC2 and Sp3 is changed under pathological conditions, we
compared the overlapping genes altered by Hdac2 or Sp3 knock-
down with the genes dysregulated in the CK-p25 mouse model of
neurodegeneration, which displays elevated levels of HDAC2 in
the hippocampus (Gra
¨ ff et al., 2012). In addition, these mice
exhibit memory deficits and several AD-related pathologies,
such as neuronal loss, Tau hyperphosphorylation/aggregation,
increased amyloid load, and reduced synaptic density, following
a 6-week induction of p25 by withdrawing doxycycline (Cruz
et al., 2006; Fischer et al., 2005). p25, a truncated version of
p35, is an activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and is
implicated in AD (Cruz et al., 2003; Sundaram et al., 2013; Wen
et al., 2008). Inhibition of p25 generation was recently shown to
prevent the expression of AD phenotypes in AD model mice, sup-
porting the notion that p25 accumulation can be a trigger of AD
(Seo et al., 2014). Accordingly, gene expression and epigenomic
signatures of the CK-p25 mouse after p25 induction correlate
with those of human AD patients (Gjoneska et al., 2015). Interest-
ingly, genes upregulated by Hdac2 or Sp3 knockdown showed
significant overlap with genes downregulated in CK-p25 mice
(Gjoneska et al., 2015) (Figure S3E) (see Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures), as well as genes downregulated in the brains
of AD patients (Liang et al., 2008) (Table 1; Table S1). Specifically,
synaptic genes like Dlgap1, Gabbr2, Scn3b, and Synpr are down-
regulated in both CK-p25 mice and AD patients and negatively
co-regulated by HDAC2 and Sp3. Overall, our genome-wide
expression analysis provides evidence that Sp3 and HDAC2
negatively regulate the expression of an overlapping set of genes
related to synaptic function.
Taken together, our findings support the notion that the DNA-
binding protein, Sp3, may serve to recruit HDAC2 to the pro-
moters of genes involved in synaptic function. To address this
hypothesis, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
followed by qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) to determine whether HDAC2
and Sp3 directly bind to the promoters of synaptic genes that
were upregulated after Hdac2 or Sp3 knockdown (Figure 1F).
Primer pairs were designed to amplify regions of the promoter
both upstream and downstream of the transcription start site
(TSS). Additional primers amplify regions roughly 4 kb down-
stream of the transcriptional start site and serve as negative
controls for HDAC2 and Sp3 enrichment, as these proteins
have previously been shown to localize to promoter regions
(Wang et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2003). Due to our interest in the
role of HDAC2 and Sp3 at the promoters of synaptic genes
and in neuronal function, we sought to isolate and directly probe
neurons from the mouse brain. Isolation of neuronal nuclei was
achieved through staining for the neuronal marker NeuN, fol-
lowed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to separate
NeuN� glial populations from NeuN+ neurons (Figures 2A and
S4A).
ChIP-qPCR
using
chromatin
derived
from
cortical
neuronal (NeuN+) nuclei of wild-type mice with anti-HDAC2
and anti-Sp3 antibodies demonstrated that HDAC2 and Sp3
often colocalize at the promoters of synaptic genes, with clear
enrichment relative to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) control (Fig-
ures 2B and 2C). Additionally, we determined the enrichment
of HDAC2 and Sp3 across the promoters of control genes
defined by RNA-seq. For control genes, we chose Cd81, whose
expression was increased only by HDAC2 knockdown (KD) but
not Sp3 KD; Mkrn1 and Fam171b, which were increased by
Sp3 KD but not HDAC2 KD; and Tanc2 and Engase, which
were not changed by either HDAC2 KD or Sp3 KD. In ChIP-
qPCR experiments using NeuN+ nuclei derived from hippocam-
pal tissue, the enrichment and distribution of HDAC2 and Sp3 at
synaptic gene promoters were similar to those observed in
cortical neurons, suggesting that this phenomenon is conserved
across brain regions (Figures S4B–S4F).
Next, we wanted to test whether Sp3 mediates HDAC2 recruit-
ment to the promoters of synaptic genes co-regulated by Sp3
and HDAC2. To address this question, we examined the effect
of Sp3 knockdown on HDAC2 enrichment at synaptic gene pro-
moters in primary neurons. Interestingly, ChIP experiments
revealed that knockdown of Sp3 alone was sufficient to signifi-
cantly reduce HDAC2 recruitment to the promoters of these
1322
Cell Reports 20, 1319–1334, August 8, 2017
 genes (Figure 2D). Importantly, HDAC2 enrichment at control
genes (Cd81, Mkrn1, Fam171b, Tanc2, and Engase) was not
affected by loss of Sp3 (Figure 2D). We also tested whether his-
tone acetylation at co-regulated synaptic gene promoters was
altered by Sp3 knockdown, as would be expected if HDAC2
recruitment to these sites were reduced. Indeed, the decrease
in HDAC2 binding due to knockdown of Sp3 was accompanied
by increased histone H4 lysine 5 acetylation (H4K5ac) or histone
H2B lysine 5 acetylation (H2BK5ac) at the promoters of several
genes, including Kcna2, Grik2, Dlgap1, Lin7a, Gabbr2, Ogfrl1,
Nlgn1, Syngr3, and Magi2 (Figures 2E and 2F). These findings
are consistent with the idea that Sp3 recruits HDAC2 to the pro-
moters of synaptic genes, where HDAC2 then mediates the de-
acetylation of histones to regulate gene expression.
Expression of HDAC2 and Sp3 Are Deregulated in AD
Our gene expression profiling indicated that HDAC2 and Sp3 co-
regulate a subset of synaptic genes, many of which are also de-
regulated in the context of AD pathology. These observations,
together with our earlier findings that HDAC2 protein levels
were increased in AD patients and mouse models of neurode-
generation, prompted us to test whether Sp3 expression might
also be upregulated in AD. First, we examined published gene
expression data collected from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
neurons from 13 healthy controls and 10 AD patients (Liang
et al., 2008) and found significant increases in the expression
of both HDAC2 and Sp3 in AD patients (Figures 3A and 3B;
see Supplemental Information for the sample information).
Furthermore, we applied WGCNA to the dataset to investigate
the alteration of gene expression networks in AD patients. We
observed that, even in this dataset combining healthy controls
and AD patients, HDAC2 and Sp3 again segregate into the
same gene expression module (Figure 3C). Moreover, the
expression of genes in the HDAC2/Sp3 module was higher in
AD patients, compared with controls, and negatively correlated
with the expression of genes in the module most enriched for
synaptic function (Figures 3D and 3E).
Next, we examined Sp3 levels in CK-p25 mice. We previously
reported, and validate here, that the expression of HDAC2 is
elevated in the cortex and the hippocampus of the 6-week-
induced
CK-p25
mice
(Gra
¨ ff
et
al.,
2012)
(Figures
S5A
and S5B). Interestingly, Sp3 protein levels were also elevated
in the cortex (Figure 4A) and hippocampus (Figure S5B) of
the 6-week-induced CK-p25 mice. Similarly, the complex of
HDAC2 and Sp3, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation with
an anti-HDAC2 antibody, was increased in the CK-p25 mouse
(Figures 4B and S5C). Further, we also assessed the levels of
HDAC2 and Sp3 bound to the promoters of synaptic genes
downregulated in 6-week-induced CK-p25 mice. Consistent
with the notion that the HDAC2-Sp3 complex antagonizes syn-
aptic gene expression in these mice, we found increased
HDAC2 and Sp3 binding at many of these loci in CK-p25
NeuN+ neuronal nuclei, compared to the CK control (Figures
4C, 4D, and S5D). Importantly, this occurs concomitantly with
a decrease in the expression of genes associated with learning,
memory, and synaptic plasticity (Figure S5E).

 To more directly test the importance of elevated Sp3 levels to
AD-related pathology, we expressed a shRNA targeting Sp3 in
the hippocampus of CK-p25 mice (Figures S6A–S6C). We previ-
ously performed similar experiments to show that expression of
an Hdac2 shRNA to normalize HDAC2 levels in CK-p25 mice
was sufficient to reverse deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity
(Gra
¨ ff et al., 2012). While long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA3-
CA1 Schaffer collateral pathway was severely impaired in CK-
p25 mice injected with control shRNA, CK-p25 mice injected
with Sp3 shRNA showed robust LTP, comparable to that in con-
trol mice (Figure 4E). Sp3 knockdown did not significantly affect
basal synaptic transmission in CK-p25 mice (Figure S6D). Taken
together, we show that both HDAC2 and Sp3 are upregulated in
CK-p25 model mice and postmortem AD hippocampal tissue.
Further, we find that, like HDAC2, downregulation of Sp3 expres-
sion ameliorated deficits in synaptic plasticity in CK-p25 mice.
Inhibiting the HDAC2-Sp3 Complex Enhances Synaptic
Function
From the aforementioned data, it appears that Sp3 plays a key
role in the recruitment of HDAC2 to the promoters of synaptic
genes and that this mechanism is deregulated in AD. Unlike
HDAC2, HDAC1 does not repress synaptic gene expression
and cognitive function, although the two proteins share 80%
amino acid homology, with the greatest divergence at the
carboxyl terminus (C terminus) (Guan et al., 2009; Hanson
et al., 2013; Morris et al., 2013). Instead, loss of HDAC1 results
in double-stranded DNA breaks, aberrant reentry into the cell cy-
cle, and neuronal death, and HDAC1 gain of function is neuro-
protective (Dobbin et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2008; Wang et al.,
2013). To further characterize the HDAC2-Sp3 interaction, we
mapped the region of HDAC2 involved in regulating synaptic
functions and binding to Sp3. We generated three chimeras of
HDAC2 and the closely related HDAC1, each of which contains
the highly conserved HDAC2 catalytic domain and nuclear local-
ization signal (Figure 5A). For chimera A, the amino terminus of
HDAC2 (amino acids 1–121) was replaced with that of HDAC1
(amino acids 1–120). A middle domain of HDAC2 (amino acids
227–357) has been replaced with that of HDAC1 (amino acids
226–356) in chimera B. In chimera C, the divergent C terminus
of HDAC2 (amino acids 391–488) has been replaced with that
of HDAC1 (amino acids 390–482). Each of these chimeras
were expressed in cultured primary neurons, and levels of
expression were determined using primers against HDAC2
(blue arrow) and HDAC1 (red arrow) across the regions anno-
tated in Figure 5A. After the knockdown of Hdac2 in cultured
neurons, we find that only chimera B expresses the middle
portion of HDAC1 at the same level as full-length HDAC1 (Fig-
ure 5B). Furthermore, chimeras A, B, and C express a region of
HDAC2 between amino acids 120 and 226 at similar levels, un-
like full-length HDAC1, suggesting that any differential effects
seen in subsequent experiments are not due to variable expres-
sion of the constructs (Figures 5B and 5C). In addition, we exam-
ined cell viability and histone deacetylase activities attributable
to each chimeric protein following overexpression in HEK293
cells and found no significant differences compared to each
other or full-length HDAC2 (Figures S7A and S7B). Each con-
struct was then tested for its ability to dampen the increased
mEPSC amplitudes caused by Hdac2 knockdown in cultured
primary neurons. Notably, expression of full-length HDAC1 or
chimera C (HDAC2 with the C terminus of HDAC1) did not coun-
teract the effect of Hdac2 knockdown on mEPSCs (Figures 5D
and 5E). In contrast, chimeras A and B, as well as full-length
HDAC2, did significantly rescue Hdac2 knockdown (Figures 5D
and 5E). These data suggest that the divergent C terminus of
HDAC2 is critical for regulating synaptic function.
These results prompted us to test whether the divergent C ter-
minus of HDAC2 alone is capable of binding to Sp3. If so, we
could potentially block the HDAC2-Sp3 interaction through
overexpression of this domain. To test this, the C-terminal
domain of either HDAC2 (termed 2C) or HDAC1 (termed 1C)
fused with mCherry, or mCherry alone, was transfected into
neuronal N2A cells. We found, using co-immunoprecipitation
experiments, that 2C, but not 1C or mCherry alone, robustly
bound to endogenous Sp3 (Figure 6A). Importantly, we did not
detect binding of 2C to Sin3A, a well-characterized partner of
the HDAC1/2 complexes that controls cell-cycle progression,
suggesting that Sin3A binds to a different region of HDAC2
(Heideman et al., 2014).
Next, we examined whether synaptic function was affected by
the expression of 2C. We found that expression of 2C in cultured
primary neurons facilitated mEPSC amplitude and frequency
reminiscent of either Hdac2 or Sp3 knockdown (Figure 6B). We
also tested whether recruitment of HDAC2 to synaptic genes
was perturbed by expression of 2C as it was by knockdown of
Sp3 (Figure 2D). Consistently, we found that HDAC2 enrichment
at the promoters of genes involved in synaptic transmission was
significantly reduced after the expression of 2C (Figure 6C).
Further, we observed increased expression of the majority of
synaptic genes tested after the expression of 2C (Figure 6D).
This increase in gene expression occurred concomitantly with
an increase in H4K5ac (Figure 6E) and, to a lesser extent,
H2BK5ac at the promoters of these genes (Figure 6F). Together,
these data indicate that overexpression of the C-terminal domain
of HDAC2 mimics the effects of Hdac2 and Sp3 knockdown on
synaptic function, gene expression, and HDAC2 localization
across DNA, possibly through the eviction of HDAC2 from the
relevant genomic loci.
Next, we evaluated whether inhibition of HDAC2 recruitment
to the promoters of synaptic genes via overexpression of 2C

 affects cell proliferation. Currently available pan-HDAC inhibitors
block cell-cycle progression, which could elicit undesirable
effects (Heideman et al., 2014; Siegel et al., 2009; Wilting et al.,
2010). We, therefore, tested whether proliferation of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was affected by overexpression
of 2C. While the rate of proliferation in MEFs was significantly
decreased by simultaneous knockdown of Hdac1 and Hdac2,
we found no effect of 2C expression on proliferation, compared
to mCherry controls (Figure S7C). These results suggest that tar-
geting the C-terminal domain of HDAC2 enabled us to selectively
manipulate synaptic function while avoiding deleterious effects
on cell proliferation.
As a validation of the therapeutic potential of targeting the
HDAC2-Sp3 complex through the expression of 2C, we tested
the effects of 2C expression on CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral
LTP and memory function, using the CK-p25 model of neuro-
degeneration. Lentiviral expression of 2C, but not control vi-
rus, in the hippocampus of the CK-p25 mouse had no effect
on basal synaptic transmission but enhanced LTP in these
mice (Figures 6G and S7D). Hippocampus-dependent memory
formation, as evaluated by contextual and cued fear-condi-
tioning assays, is also markedly impaired in the 6-week-
induced CK-p25 mouse. Importantly, overexpression of 2C
in the hippocampus was able to ameliorate both context-
dependent and cued fear learning deficits (Figures 6H and
S7E). Thus, overexpression of 2C can counteract synaptic
and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of neurodegeneration.
Finally, we tested whether the behavioral, synaptic functional,
and epigenetic changes we describe in response to 2C or Sp3
shRNA expression in CK-p25 mice are paralleled by gene
expression alterations. For this analysis, we extracted hippo-
campal RNA from control and CK-25 mice as well as from
CK-p25 mice infected with 2C or Sp3 shRNA-expressing vi-
ruses. We found that most synaptic genes examined exhibit
reduced expression in CK-p25 mice relative to controls and
that many of these changes were abrogated by the expression
of 2C or Sp3 shRNA (Figure 6I). Taken together, our findings
indicate that targeting the C terminus of HDAC2 constitutes
a plausible and specific strategy to inhibit the HDAC2-Sp3
complex and treat neurological disorders associated with
memory impairment.
DISCUSSION
Although HDAC2-specific inhibition poses a potential avenue for
treating AD, none of the currently available HDAC inhibitors are
selective against HDAC2, due to the high conservation of active
sites among mammalian HDAC isoforms (West and Johnstone,
2014). This lack of specificity is problematic, considering the
diverse functions of HDAC enzymes throughout the body.
Indeed, HDAC inhibition can be deleterious, depending on the
enzyme, tissue, or specific context. For example, during hema-
topoiesis, loss or inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 leads to de-
fects in differentiation and thrombocytopenia (Dannenberg
et al., 2005; Heideman et al., 2014; Wilting et al., 2010). However,
in the context of neuronal function, HDAC2 appears to play a
specific and critical role in regulating synaptic gene expression
and cognitive processes. Therefore, in this study, we attempted
to identify the key members of the HDAC2 complex that control
synaptic gene expression. Targeting specific proteins within this
complex would provide an avenue for relieving HDAC2-medi-
ated repression of neuronal genes during neurodegeneration
while sparing the essential role of HDAC2 in other functions
and pathways.
Rather than traditional IP-MS-based proteomic screening
methods, we utilized an integrated genomics approach to iden-
tify HDAC2 partners essential for regulating synaptic plasticity.
This approach incorporated WGCNA, a method previously
used to identify signaling pathways altered in disease conditions
or following compound treatments (Hawrylycz et al., 2012;
Horvath et al., 2006). Here, we succeeded in broadening its
application to identify potential co-regulators of HDAC2. The
consequent list of genes included several known HDAC2-bind-
ing proteins, including TDP2 and Sap30 (Eom et al., 2014;
Tong et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2001), as well as Sp3. Importantly,
the strongly correlated expression of Sp3 and HDAC2 was
clearly observed across datasets, indicating the robustness of
the association (Figures 3C, 3E, and S1B, and S1C). Critically,
the potential co-regulators identified by our in silico analysis
were interrogated using biological assays to validate their func-
tional significance. This interplay of bioinformatic network and
functional analyses provides a powerful methodology that could
be applied to other epigenetic regulators and tissue types.
The roles of Sp3 in regulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive
function have been elusive, although Sp3-mediated gene regula-
tion has been previously reported in neurons. In the context of
AD, there are a handful of reports addressing altered Sp3
expression in the presence of phosphorylated tau or oxidative
stress (Boutillier et al., 2007; Ross et al., 2002; Ryu et al.,
2003). Our discovery of the crucial role that Sp3 plays in regu-
lating synaptic plasticity and cognitive function was highly
unexpected. Indeed, Sp3 appears to be an important negative
regulator of synaptic gene expression and synaptic function
that likely also plays an important role in cognitive decline in
AD patients.
In addition to increased HDAC2 and Sp3 protein in CK-p25
mice, we also found that mRNA levels of the two genes were
increased in postmortem hippocampal tissues of AD patients,
indicating their transcriptional upregulation under pathological
conditions. HDAC2 is induced by stresses such as Ab and
H2O2 through the activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
(Gra
¨ ff et al., 2012). Likewise, Sp3 was shown to be increased
by oxidative stress (Ryu et al., 2003), and, intriguingly, the pro-
moter of Sp3 contains putative glucocorticoid response ele-
ments between �875 and �858 from its transcription start site
(as predicted by JASPAR; http://jaspar.genereg.net/cgi-bin/
jaspar_db.pl?rm=browse&db=core&tax_group=vertebrates), sug-
gesting the possibility that HDAC2 and Sp3 are co-regulated
by common stress response pathways. This possibility is consis-
tent with the tight correlation of Sp3 and HDAC2 expression we
observed across WGCNA datasets.
Moreover, we identified Sp3 as an important DNA-binding
protein for HDAC2 recruitment to ‘‘synaptic’’ gene loci. However,
the knockdown of Sp3 did not completely eliminate HDAC2
localization to chromatin. This implies that other HDAC2-inter-
acting proteins are important for HDAC2 recruitment across

 the genome. Notably, along with an upregulation of gene expres-
sion, histone acetylation was substantially increased by the par-
tial reduction of HDAC2 at the promoters of several synaptic
genes following Sp3 knockdown. Even at promoters without
clear increases in acetyl H2B or H4, acetylation of other histone
residues not tested here might be increased. Importantly, Sp3
knockdown reversed the impairment of synaptic plasticity in
CK-p25 mice, consistent with our previous finding that partial
reduction of HDAC2 levels is sufficient to reverse synaptic and
cognitive deficits in these same mice (Gra
¨ ff et al., 2012).
Lastly, by generating chimeras of HDAC2 and the closely
related HDAC1, whose inhibition has no effect on synaptic plas-
ticity (Guan et al., 2009; Hanson et al., 2013; Morris et al., 2013),
we demonstrated that 2C binds to Sp3 and is necessary for
HDAC2 to negatively regulate synaptic function. Similar to Sp3
knockdown, 2C expression led to a mild reduction of HDAC2
occupancy across the promoters of synaptic genes, which was
sufficient to reverse the impairment of synaptic plasticity and
cognitive function in CK-p25 mice. Again, this is consistent with
our previous finding that the partial knockdown of HDAC2 was
able to ameliorate hippocampus-dependent memory impairment
(Gra
¨ ff et al., 2012). In addition, 2C was found to bind to Sp3, but
not Sin3A, an HDAC2 complex protein that plays a crucial role
in cell-cycle progression in proliferative cells (Heideman et al.,
2014). Together with our observation that MEF proliferation was
not affected by 2C expression, these findings suggest that
HDAC2-Sin3A and HDAC2-Sp3 complexes are distinct and that
the latter can be selectively inhibited by administration of the
HDAC2 C-terminal domain. We cannot, however, exclude the
possibility that 2C also disrupts HDAC2 binding to other proteins
or that its expression influences the functions of proteins other
than Sp3. While further mapping of the Sp3-binding site within
the 2C region may be required to more stringently inhibit only
the HDAC2-Sp3 interaction for drug discovery, the mode of inhib-
iting the HDAC2-Sp3 complex described here could circumvent
the toxicity of HDAC inhibitors in clinical use (Ali et al., 2013; Siegel
et al., 2009) while still stimulating synaptic gene expression and
enhancing neuronal plasticity and cognitive function.
In conclusion, we have identified the HDAC2-Sp3 complex as
a critical epigenetic regulator of synaptic function in neurons and
demonstrated the therapeutic potential of selective inhibition of
this complex in AD. Growing evidence indicates the involvement
of HDAC2 in a number of other neurological disorders, such as
depression, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizo-
phrenia (Covington et al., 2009; Gra
¨ ff et al., 2014; Kurita et al.,
2012). As these disorders share some common features such
as impaired synaptic plasticity, a common underlying etiology
could exist (Cominski et al., 2014; Frantseva et al., 2008;
Howland and Wang, 2008). Further studies may reveal the ther-
apeutic potential of targeting the HDAC2-Sp3 complex in these
disorders as well. Thus, our findings provide alternative avenues
for the development of drugs to treat AD, and potentially other
neurological disorders, by illustrating a feasible paradigm to
selectively target a specific HDAC2 complex to boost memory
function without affecting other complexes whose inhibition
likely mediates the negative side effects of pan-HDAC inhibitors.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Models
All mouse work was approved by the Committee for Animal Care of the Divi-
sion of Comparative Medicine at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Male CK-p25 mice were crossed with female CK or p25 mice to get WT, CK,
p25, and double-transgenic CK-p25 mice. CK or p25 mice were used as nega-
tive controls. 2.5- to 3.5-month-old double-transgenic CK-p25 mice (and their
littermates) were used to induce p25 expression by changing food pellets con-
taining doxycycline to ones lacking doxycycline. All behavioral experiments
and ex vivo LTP recordings were performed between 6 and 8 weeks of p25 in-
duction, the time when cognitive deficits are strongly observed (Fischer et al.,
2005).
ChIP
Crosslinking was performed with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for
Sp3 and acetylated histones. For HDAC2 ChIP, additional crosslinking with
2 mM disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) was done for 35 min, followed by the
addition of formaldehyde (final 1%) and another 10-min incubation. The reac-
tion was stopped with 125 mM glycine. For primary cultured neurons, cell
pellets were lysed with 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor
cocktail for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted by spinning at 1,000 rpm for
5 min at 4�C. The pellets were resuspended with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl and rocked for 10 min at room
temperature followed by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4�C. The

fluorescent signal of the amplified DNA (SYBR Green, BioRad) was normal-
ized to input.
Electrophysiology
Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from the mice injected with lenti-
virus 4 weeks after viral injection. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane
and decapitated. The experimenter was blinded to which virus was injected.
Transverse hippocampal slices (400 mm thick) were prepared in ice-cold
dissection buffer (in millimolar: 211 sucrose, 3.3 KCl, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 0.5
CaCl2, 10 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, and 11 glucose) using a Leica VT1000S
vibratome (Leica). Slices were recovered in a submerged chamber with
95% O2/5% CO2-saturated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisting
of (in millimolar) 124 NaCl, 3.3 KCl, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 26
NaHCO3, and 11 glucose for 1 hr at 28�C–30�C. To ensure that an equivalent
number of virus-transduced cells was present in each slice, the number of
GFP/mCherry-expressing cells was quantified. For extracellular recording,
CA1 field potentials evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation with bipolar
electrode was measured every 30 s. After recording the baseline for
15 min, LTP was induced by repeated (23) theta-burst stimulations (TBSs,
containing 10 brief bursts, which consisted of four pulses at 100 Hz). The
slopes of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were measured
to quantify the strength of synaptic transmission. A HEKA instrument
(EPC10) was used for data acquisition, and data were analyzed with
pClamp10 (Axon Instruments). The input-output curve was obtained by plot-
ting the slopes of fEPSPs against stimulation intensity (in milliamperes). For
mEPSC recordings of primary cortical neurons (days in vitro [DIV]17–22),
the external solution consisted of (in millimolar) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2,
2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose ([pH 7.3] with NaOH), and 315
mOsm. The internal solution contained (in millimolar): 145 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 10
HEPES, 10 EGTA, 4 MgATP, and 0.3 Na2GTP (pH 7.3 with CsOH),
305 mOsm. The external solution also contained 1 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX)
and 10 mM bicuculline. Series resistance was compensated. The membrane
potential of each cell was patched at �70 mV during recording. Recordings
were obtained at room temperature. Data were acquired using the Axopatch
200B amplifier and analyzed with pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices).
Statistics
Student’s or Welch’s t test was used for the statistical comparison of two
groups, following an F test. Multiple comparisons were carried out with Dun-
nett’s test, unless otherwise noted. To examine the significance of overlaps
in RNA-seq data, Fisher’s exact test was used.
