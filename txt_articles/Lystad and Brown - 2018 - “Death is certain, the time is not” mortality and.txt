“Death is certain, the time is not”: mortality
and survival in Game of Thrones
Reidar P. Lystad1*
and Benjamin T. Brown2
Abstract
Background: Game of Thrones is a popular television series known for its violent and graphic portrayal of the
deaths of its characters. This study aimed to examine the mortality and survival of important characters in
Game of Thrones.
Methods: Important characters appearing in Seasons 1 to 7 of Game of Thrones were included, and data on
sociodemographic factors, time to death, and circumstances of death were recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
with Cox proportional hazard regression modelling were used to quantify survival times and probabilities and to
identify independent predictors of mortality, respectively.
Results: Of the 330 characters that were included, 186 (56.4%) had died by the end of the study period. All but 2
deaths were due to injury, burns, or poisoning, with the majority being caused by assault (63.0%) or operations of
war (24.4%). The survival time ranged from 11 s to 57 h and 15 min, with the median survival time estimated to be
28 h and 48 min. The probability of surviving at least 1 h in the show was 0.86 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). The analyses
revealed worse survival for characters who were male (P < 0.001), lowborn (P < 0.001), had not switched allegiance
during the show (P < 0.001), and who featured more prominently in the show (P < 0.001). After adjusting for other
factors, whether or not a character had switched allegiance during the show and how prominently a character
featured in the show were revealed to be independent predictors of death.
Conclusions: The mortality risk is high among characters in Game of Thrones. The probability of dying within the
first hour after first appearing on screen was about 14%. By the end of the seventh season, more than half of the
important characters had died, with violent deaths being the most common by far. The probability of survival was
worse for characters who were male or lowborn, who had not switched allegiance during the show, and who
featured more prominently. There is great potential for preventing violent deaths in the world of Game of Thrones.

Background
Game of Thrones is a popular HBO television series
based on George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire
book series (Martin 2012). The series portrays a fic-
tional society characterised by political upheaval, civil
wars, and wide-spread violence. Ceaseless feuding and
the lack of stable democratic government precludes
the
establishment
and
development
of
institutions
that can provide services to improve the health and
well-being of the inhabitants. That the world of Game
of
Thrones
is
reminiscent
of
mediaeval
European
history is unsurprising considering that its creator has
admitted that his creation was inspired by multiple histor-
ical events, in particular The Wars of the Roses which un-
folded in England in the latter half of the fifteenth
Century.
Violence has been a feature of every society throughout
human history; however, there has been a sizable decline
over time (Pinker 2011). For example, the annual rate of
violent deaths of all kinds has declined from around 500
per 100,000 population in pre-state societies to 40 during
the Middle Ages, and to less than 10 in modern societies
(Pinker 2011; World Health Organization 2014). In
pre-state societies, 15% of people died as a result of war,
compared to less than 5 per 100,000 population today. In

 his book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence
Has Declined, Steven Pinker identifies five historical forces
that have contributed to the decline of violence in
modern societies namely: the emergence of the modern
nation-state with a monopoly on the legitimate use of
force; the prioritisation of commerce over conquest;
and a suite of enlightenment ideas (e.g. human rights,
increased literacy, and the elevation of knowledge and
rationality in problem-solving and decision-making)
(Pinker 2011).
Few studies have investigated the health and well-being
of the characters in Game of Thrones. One study described
a dermatological disease called Greyscale (Lipoff 2016),
while another study discussed forced fitness behaviours
and associated hormonal responses (Rhodes and Zehr
2017). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no
epidemiological study of mortality and survival has been
performed. The primary aim of this study was therefore to
examine the mortality and survival of the characters in
Game of Thrones. Specifically, to estimate survival time
and probability, to identify predictive factors, and to de-
scribe causes and circumstances of deaths. The secondary
aim was to give the authors an excuse to re-watch the first
seven seasons before the final season reaches television
screens worldwide.
Methods
Study population
This study included all important characters appearing
in the first seven seasons of HBO’s Game of Thrones
television series. An important character was defined as
any individual who fulfilled each of the following criteria:
human; listed in either the opening or closing credits;
appeared on screen during current events (i.e. excluding
flashbacks); and was not already deceased when first
appearing on screen. Additional non-credited characters
were included if they interacted with another character
in a way that was either crucial to the storyline or
character development. Having a speaking role was not
an essential requirement because some characters were
unable to speak for medical reasons (e.g. acquired brain
injury and non-elective glossectomy).
Data sources
The primary data source was the Game of Thrones DVD
boxset, which included all 67 episodes from the seven
seasons that have aired to date (Game of Thrones
Seasons 1–7 [DVD] 2017). In addition, the Internet
Movie Database (IMDb) and the Game of Thrones Wiki
website were used to cross-check and validate information
obtained through direct observation (Internet Movie
Database (IMDb) [Internet] 2018; Game of Thrones Wiki
[Internet] 2018). Both authors independently extracted
sociodemographic, mortality, and time to event data. In
the event of any discrepancies, both authors re-visited the
original source material and resolved the discrepancy by
mutual consensus.
The
following
sociodemographic
variables
were
recorded for each character: sex, social status, type of
occupation, religious affiliation, and allegiance. In regard
to social status, characters who were lords, ladies, or le-
gitimate offspring thereof were classified as “highborn”,
whereas all other characters were classified as “lowborn”.
Type of occupation was categorised as “silk collar” (e.g.
clergy, merchants, politicians, and rulers) or “boiled
leather collar” (e.g. warriors, farmers, and other occupa-
tions relying heavily on manual work). Because some
characters switched allegiance during the show, both
their last known allegiance and whether or not they
switched allegiance during the show were recorded.
A proxy measure for how prominently a character
featured in the show was created. This prominence score
was calculated by taking the number of episodes that a
character appeared in and dividing that by the number
of total episodes that the character could have appeared
in (i.e. the number of episodes occurring from the
character first being introduced until the point of death
or censoring). This ratio was then multiplied by the
number of seasons that the character had featured in.
The prominence scores were then categorised into ter-
tiles (i.e. high, medium, and low).
Outcome measures
The primary outcome for this study was time to death.
The survival time was based on the duration, measured
in hours, that a character survived after being intro-
duced in the series. The net running time (i.e. running
time excluding opening and closing credits) of all
episodes in the seven seasons was summed to provide
the cumulative net running time of the series, which
denoted the maximum possible survival time prior to
censoring. For each character, their start time was the
time when they were first visualised/introduced in the
series. The end time was either at the time of their death
or at censoring if they remained alive until the end of
the seventh season.
Although most deaths were visualised in unashamedly
graphic detail on the screen, some deaths were evident
only after being explicitly mentioned in the dialogue or
implied by the storyline. For these characters, the time
of death was assigned as the net running time at the end
of the scene or episode in which their death was pre-
sumed to have occurred. For each death, the principal
diagnosis, external cause of mortality, and place of oc-
currence were classified using the alphanumeric coding
scheme of the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision,
Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) (National Centre
Lystad and Brown Injury Epidemiology            (2018) 5:44 
Page 2 of 9
 for Classification in Health 2006), which is a derived ver-
sion of the World Health Organization’s classification
list. In addition, for each death the geographical location
(i.e. Westeros, Essos, or Sothoryos), physical location
(i.e. indoors or outdoors), and time of day (i.e. day or
night) were recorded.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using R, version 3.3.2
(R Core Team. 2017). Summary statistics were used to
describe the characteristics of characters and recorded
deaths. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to
construct the curves that display the survival experiences
of the cohort. Stratified analyses with the Peto-Peto test
were used to compare survival experiences between sub-
groups of characters (i.e. by sociodemographic variables)
(Peto and Peto 1972). Unlike the normal log-rank test
which gives equal weight to all events of interest during
the follow-up period, the Peto-Peto test assigns larger
weights to hazards that occur early (Karadeniz and Ercan
2017). Furthermore, whereas the log-rank test assumes
proportional hazards, the Peto-Peto test is more efficient
when there is evidence of violation of the proportional
hazards assumption (Karadeniz and Ercan 2017).
Univariable
Cox
proportional
hazard
regression
models were used to identify potential predictor vari-
ables. Variables which showed P < 0.10 in the univariable
model were included the subsequent multivariable Cox
proportional hazard regression modelling. The propor-
tional hazard assumption was evaluated by plotting
Schoenfeld residuals as a function of time as described
by Grambsch & Therneau (Grambsch and Therneau
1994). Where potential predictor variables displayed
evidence
of
violation
of
the
proportional
hazards
assumption, time dependent covariates were generated
by creating interactions of the potential predictors
and a function of survival time. These interaction
terms were included alongside the time dependent
covariates in the multivariable model. The final fitted
multivariable model was used to identify independent
predictors of survival and estimate hazard ratios (HR)
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Variables
were considered independent predictors of survival
when P < 0.05.
Results
A total of 330 characters were included in this study, of
which 237 (71.8%) were male, 226 (68.5%) were lowborn,
and 196 (59.4%) were boiled leather-collar workers. See
Table 1 for more details of the characteristics of the
study cohort.
By the end of the study period, 186 (56.4%) of the
characters had died. The majority of deaths were injuries
(n = 137; 73.7%), in particular wounds of the head and

level (decapitations). The remainder of deaths were
chiefly burns (n = 22; 11.8%) or poisonings (n = 9; 4.8%).
Only two deaths from natural causes were recorded.
The most common circumstances of deaths were
assault (n = 116; 63.0%), operations of war (n = 45;
24.4%), and legal executions (n = 10; 5.4%). The ma-
jority of deaths occurred in Westeros (n = 147; 80.1%),
while the most common place of occurrence was the
home (n = 56; 30.4%). See Table 2 for a detailed overview
of principal diagnoses, external causes of mortality, and

Figure 1 shows the survival curve for all important
characters in the first seven seasons of the Game of
Thrones television series. The survival time ranged from
11 s to 57 h and 15 min, with the median survival time
estimated to be 28 h and 48 min. The probability of sur-
viving at least 1 h in the show was 0.86 (95% CI 0.82 to

(A), social status (B), whether the character switched
allegiance during the show (C), and how prominently
the character featured in the show (D). The stratified
analyses revealed significantly shorter median survival
times for males compared to females (24.0 h versus 41.3 h,
respectively; P < 0.001), for lowborns compared to high-
borns (19.1 h versus 38.0 h, respectively; P < 0.001), and
for those that did not switch allegiance compared to those
that did (24.3 h versus 55.2 h, respectively; P < 0.001). In
addition, there were significant differences in median
survival time between characters whose prominence was
low, medium, or high (P < 0.001).

 prominently a character featured in the show and
whether or not they switched allegiance during the
show were revealed to be independent predictors of
death. Compared to characters who did not feature
prominently in the show, the risk of death was more
than 2.5 times greater for characters who featured
very prominently (HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.87, P =
0.028) and more than 6.5 times greater than charac-
ters who only featured moderately prominently (HR
6.58, 95% CI 2.94 to 14.74, P < 0.001). Characters who
switched allegiance during the show had significantly
lower risk of death compared to those who did not
switch allegiance (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70, P =
0.003).
Discussion
This is the first scientific study to examine mortality and
survival in Game of Thrones. It revealed that more than
half of the important characters had died by the end of
the seventh season, and the probability of dying within
the first hour after first appearing on screen was about
14%. The vast majority of these deaths were due to in-
jury, burns, or poisoning at the hands of other charac-
ters. The survival time of individual characters varied
widely, a finding that echoes the quote from Jaqen
H’ghar, an assassin featuring in Game of Thrones, which
appears in the title of this paper.
The high rates of violent deaths observed in Game of
Thrones are not without precedent in human history.
For instance, archaeological evidence from prehistoric
societies suggests that violent deaths accounted for
about 15% of all-cause mortality, while ethnographic
evidence indicates that the share of violent deaths for
people living in pre-state societies was about 25% (Roser
2013a). In Europe, the homicide rates per 100,000
population have declined from around 40 homicides
during the Middle Ages, to around 10 homicides in the
eighteenth century, to around 3 homicides today (Roser
2013b; World Health Organization 2018).
Although many factors have undoubtedly contributed
to the decline of violent deaths throughout human
history, the following paragraph will be limited to a brief
outline of some of the most significant ones. Perhaps
foremost among these factors is the emergence of the
nation-state with its monopoly on the legitimate use of
force (Pinker 2011). The presence of such nation-states
will tend to quell and restrain the anarchy, raiding, and
feuding characterised by non-state societies. Next follows
what Steven Pinker refers to as the “civilising process”, the
process by which feudal territories were consolidated into
large kingdoms with centralised authority and infrastruc-
ture for expanding commerce (Pinker 2011). As the im-
portance of commerce increased, other people became
more valuable alive than dead. The continued exchange of

 goods and services is, after all, more effective when trade
partners are alive. The increased concern for the welfare of
human beings, in turn, gives rise to the establishment of
public institutions that can provide services to improve
the health and well-being of the people (e.g. hospitals
and public health departments). Lastly, but by no means
least, is the rise of reason, the increasing application
of knowledge and rationality in problem-solving and
decision-making.
Where does the known world in Game of Thrones sit
in regard to the factors that were highlighted in the
preceding paragraph? For obvious reasons the world of
Game of Thrones cannot be interpolated into human
history; however, it may nevertheless be instructive to
comment on to what extent any of the above-mentioned
factors are apparent in Game of Thrones. Nation-states
are not entirely universal in Game of Thrones, but they
are common and wide-spread. The civilising process is
clearly in progress, albeit far from completed. Although
feudal territories in Westeros have coalesced into seven
kingdoms, which in turn has been subjected to the rule
of the Iron Throne, the political structure of the realm is
evidently unstable. The legitimacy of the ruling power is
questionable and the rule of law is ineffective, thus
several competing factions are attempting to effect a
regime change. There is clearly an emphasis on war rather
than commerce, and although very limited medical care is
available to some characters, there is a paucity of institu-
tions for delivering public goods (e.g. schools, hospitals).
Knowledge and reason do not appear to play a significant
role in problem-solving and decision-making. Although
some characters express concerns for human welfare and
attempts to abolish slavery, such ideas are not universal or
well enshrined in the world of Game of Thrones.
Given the societal structure outlined above, it should
come as no surprise that violence prevention is presently
not a priority in Game of Thrones. Despite being ubiqui-
tous in human history, violence can be predicted and
prevented (World Health Organization 2018). Effective
violence prevention requires good quality data measur-
ing the burden over time and identifying risk factors
amenable to intervention. This study found that the risk
of violent death was higher among characters who were
male and lowborn. This is consistent with data from the
real world suggesting that homicide rates are higher in
countries and areas with lower socioeconomic status
and that 80% of homicide victims are male (World
Health Organization 2018). Other well-established risk
factors for higher rates of violent deaths are transitions
in political regime (World Health Organization 2018),
the absence of good governance and the rule of law
(World Health Organization 2018), and climatic instability
(LeBlanc
1999;
Jones
et
al.
1999).
Although
data
pertaining to these risk factors were not recorded, it is
nevertheless evident that the storyline in Game of Thrones
is premised on the presence of these factors (e.g. the
struggle to sit on the Iron Throne and that “Winter Is
Coming”).
It could be argued there is great potential for violence
prevention in the world of Game of Thrones. Beyond
instituting legitimate (i.e. democratic) and stable govern-
ments that can deliver public goods such as justice based
on the rule of law, the following recommendations could
be offered: (1) increased efforts to expand commerce,
thereby increasing the value of other people and creating
more wealth and resources; (2) increased investment in
institutions that can deliver public goods that will
improve human health and well-being (e.g. schools,
hospitals, and public health departments); (3) improve
the built environment; and (4) develop and implement
evidence-based
violence
prevention
policies.
Unlike
violence prevention efforts in modern society, any of the
above-mentioned recommendations could be imple-
mented in Game of Thrones with the stroke of a pen.
However, because this may negatively impact the show’s
popularity, it seems unlikely any such changes will occur
before the last episode of the final season reaches televi-
sion screens worldwide.
Limitations
Firstly, only important characters were included in this
study, thus the findings may not be generalisable to the
entire population in the world of Game of Thrones.
Secondly, this study is potentially limited by the quality
of data extraction and missing data. Independent data
collection by two authors watching the DVD box set
should have served to minimise errors. Furthermore,
extracted data were subsequently cross-referenced with
the information contained on the IMDb and the Game
of Thrones Wiki site (Internet Movie Database (IMDb)
[Internet] 2018; Game of Thrones Wiki [Internet] 2018).
Although the accuracy of the information contained on
the wiki site cannot be guaranteed, it is likely to be ro-
bust given that the information has been collaboratively
reviewed by thousands of die-hard fans, including fans
who have developed strong parasocial relationships, to
the extent that overt grief was observed after the death
of
certain
characters
in
the
show
(Daniel
and
Westerman
2017).
Information
regarding
allegiance,
occupation, and religion were indeterminable for some
characters. Similarly, the unavailability of death certifi-
cates may have diminished the accuracy of the informa-
tion regarding some deaths. Thirdly, it was not possible
to calculate mortality rates per unit population because
there were no available census data providing population
estimates for the world of Game of Thrones. Lastly, the
findings
for
time
dependent
covariates
should
be
interpreted with caution. Although interaction terms

 were included alongside time dependent covariates in
the multivariable Cox regression model, their parameter
estimates are probably best interpreted as the average
effect of the covariate (Allison 1995).
Conclusions
This is the first scientific study to examine the mortality
and survival in Game of Thrones. It revealed that the
probability of a character dying within the first hour
after first being introduced on screen was about 14%. By
the end of the seventh season, more than half of the im-
portant characters had died, with violent deaths being
the most common by far. The probability of survival was
worse for characters who were male or lowborn, who
had not switched allegiance during the show, and who
featured more prominently in the show. There is great
potential for preventing violent deaths in the world of
Game of Thrones. Stable democratic governments, resili-
ent institutions that deliver public goods, and implemen-
tation of evidence-based violence prevention polices can
decrease the risk of violent deaths considerably.

Authors’ contributions
The study was conceived by RPL and BTB, who both enjoyed watching all
the episodes while collecting data. RPL conducted the data analyses. RPL
and BTB interpreted the results, commented on the implications of the
findings, contributed to the first draft of the manuscript, revised the
manuscript critically for important content, and gave final approval of the
version to be published.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
Ethics approval was not required for this study. Consent was not sought
from participants because, whether dead or alive, their fictional nature would
preclude them from providing valid informed consent.
Consent for publication
