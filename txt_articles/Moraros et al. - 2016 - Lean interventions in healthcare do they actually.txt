Abstract
Purpose: Lean is a widely used quality improvement methodology initially developed and used in
the automotive and manufacturing industries but recently expanded to the healthcare sector. This
systematic literature review seeks to independently assess the effect of Lean or Lean interventions
on worker and patient satisfaction, health and process outcomes, and financial costs.
Data sources: We conducted a systematic literature review of Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library,
CINAHL, Web of Science, ABI/Inform, ERIC, EMBASE and SCOPUS.
Study selection: Peer reviewed articles were included if they examined a Lean intervention and in-
cluded quantitative data. Methodological quality was assessed using validated critical appraisal
checklists. Publically available data collected by the Saskatchewan Health Quality Council and the
Saskatchewan Union of Nurses were also analysed and reported separately.
Data extraction: Data on design, methods, interventions and key outcomes were extracted and
collated.
Results of data synthesis: Our electronic search identified 22 articles that passed methodological
quality review. Among the accepted studies, 4 were exclusively concerned with health outcomes,
3 included both health and process outcomes and 15 included process outcomes. Our study
found that Lean interventions have: (i) no statistically significant association with patient satisfaction
and health outcomes; (ii) a negative association with financial costs and worker satisfaction and (iii)
potential, yet inconsistent, benefits on process outcomes like patient flow and safety.
Conclusion: While some may strongly believe that Lean interventions lead to quality improvements
in healthcare, the evidence to date simply does not support this claim. More rigorous, higher quality
and better conducted scientific research is required to definitively ascertain the impact and effective-
ness of Lean in healthcare settings.
Key words: Lean, Lean thinking, Lean interventions, quality improvement, healthcare
Introduction
Globally, healthcare systems are at a cross roads. Many political and
healthcare leaders, and in fact the public itself is calling for, if not de-
manding, the redesign of healthcare delivery. The concern is fuelled by
ever increasing costs and high expectations, while at the same time
having surprisingly low rates of patient adherence to care and high
rates of adverse events [1]. In response, many jurisdictions have
attempted to introduce standardized protocols like Lean.
Lean is a widely used quality improvement methodology. Lean
thinking was first developed in the automotive and manufacturing in-
dustries but it has recently expanded to the healthcare sector. Lean
thinking begins with identifying and ‘removing waste’ in order to

 ‘add value’ to the customer or patient [2]. The Lean Enterprise Insti-
tute articulates five main principles of Lean: specify value from the
standpoint of the customer, identify all the steps in the value stream
and eliminate steps that do not create value, make the steps flow
smoothly toward the customer, let customers pull value from the
next upstream activity and begin the process again until a state of per-
fection is reached [3].
The introduction of these principles placed ‘customer value’ and ‘re-
moving waste’ at the centre of Lean thinking. In this manner, the process
is essentially driven by ‘what customers want’ and then organizational
steps are taken to define which activities are considered to be
‘value-adding’ as opposed to ‘non-value adding’. ‘Value adding’ activ-
ities are encouraged because they directly contribute to creating a prod-
uct or service a customer wants. On the other hand, ‘non-value adding’
activities are considered a waste and need to be removed or avoided [4].
To date, there have been a limited number of reviews of Lean or
Lean interventions in healthcare. One of the reviews started with
207 articles under consideration. However, when the authors applied
their inclusion criteria of only accepting papers that were published in
peer review journals and studies that had quantifiable data available, it
left them with merely 19 papers (9.2%) for critical appraisal [5].
Among the papers accepted, it was noted that the vast majority of
studies had methodological limitations that undermined the validity of
the results. These limitations included weak study designs, lack of stat-
istical analysis, inappropriate statistical assumptions, inappropriate
analysis, failure to rule out alternative hypotheses, no adjustment
for confounding, selection bias and lack of control groups. The studies
also did not review long-term organizational change, long-term im-
pact or the independent effect of Lean while controlling for other or-
ganizational or staffing changes occurring at the same time [5].
Although this review was well-conducted, it was not a systematic lit-
erature review and it did not include a quality control checklist.
In North America, there are many examples of Lean healthcare
interventions but the largest Lean transformation in the world was
attempted in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada [6]. The
Health Quality Council (HQC) of Saskatchewan concludes on its web-
site that Lean increases patient safety by eliminating errors, increases pa-
tient satisfaction, reduces cost and improves patient health outcomes [7].
On the surface, Lean thinking seems to be an approach that gener-
ates positive results [8]. Yet, its application in healthcare has been con-
troversial and its effectiveness questioned. As such, the purpose of this
systematic literature review is to independently assess the effect of Lean
thinking and Lean interventions on worker and patient satisfaction,
health and process outcomes and financial costs.
Methods
We conducted an extensive systematic literature review on the follow-
ing electronic databases: Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CI-
NAHL, Web of Science, ABI/Inform, ERIC, EMBASE and SCOPUS.
Searches were carried out using the following keywords: Lean Pro-
duction System, Lean enterprise, Lean manufacturing, Virginia
Mason Production System, Toyota Production System, Just in time
production, Kaizen, HoshinKanri, Lean method, Lean thinking,
Lean intervention, Lean healthcare, Lean principles, Lean process,
Muda and Healthcare.
Peer-reviewed articles
Articles had to satisfy the following inclusion criteria to be considered:
published in English, publicly available, peer reviewed, examined a
Lean intervention and included quantitative data. These liberal criteria
allowed the inclusion of a wide variety of relevant articles in our study.
However, it also served as a means to exclude news reports, blog com-
mentary, informational/promotional pieces and general ‘feel good’
success stories that lacked the necessary quantitative data to be able
to critically judge the information presented.
The identification and approval of studies was carried out in three
steps. First, the authors examined titles and abstracts to remove dupli-
cates. Second, two of the authors (C.N. and M.L.) reviewed the full-
text articles for relevance with regard to the field of healthcare and
conformity to the inclusion criteria. Third, methodological quality
was assessed by using validated critical appraisal checklists. The diffu-
sion of innovations in health service checklists helped the authors
assess the baseline comparability of the groups in each study, the
research design, outcome measures and potential sources of bias.
They were originally modelled after the Cochrane Effective Practice
and Organization of Care Group for interventions in service delivery
and organization [9]. Studies that scored >50% on the quality check-
list were accepted (i.e. satisfied 6 or more out of 11 questions for before
and after studies). Any disagreement between the two authors (C.N.
and M.L.) was resolved by additional review and, if required, with a
tie-breaking vote by the third author (J.M).
Grey literature
As mentioned, the largest Lean healthcare transformation in the world
was attempted in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada [6]. The
HQC has been surveying tens of thousands of patients over the
years about their experiences in Saskatchewan hospitals. For the pur-
poses of this systematic review, February 2012 was used as the cut-off
point for the evaluation of pre- and post-Lean data as it coincided with
the official date of the signed provincial contract with a Lean consult-
ant firm [10]. A 26-month period was used to collect and analyse data
on a monthly basis before Lean implementation (December 2009 to
January 2012) and after Lean implementation (February 2012 to
March 2014). This high quality data collected by certified Lean profes-
sionals have sample sizes ranging from 17 698 to 92 127 patients with
a response rate of ∼51% and it is publicly available on a web site [11].
Additionally, the largest healthcare union or association in the prov-
ince, the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN), contracted an external
professional polling company to randomly survey 1500 nurses about
their Lean experience in 2014 [12]. All 1500 nurses contacted, parti-
cipated in the telephone survey.
Results
We identified a total of 1056 peer-reviewed articles of which 164 were
removed as duplicates, 768 were removed due to lack of relevance to
healthcare and 76 were removed because they did not meet the inclusion
criteria. Among the 48 articles that were assessed for methodological
quality, 22 articles passed [13–34] and 26 articles failed the checklist
review [35–60] (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The original two reviewers
(C.N. and M.L.) independently assessed and agreed on 43 studies
with a tie breaking vote required by the third reviewer (J.M.) on five
out of the 48 studies. Once finalized, the data from the included studies
was pooled and summarized and confidence intervals for rate ratios
were calculated with an established software application (SPSS 22.0).
Among the 22 studies accepted, none used high quality experimen-
tal study designs (i.e. randomized controlled trials) or even lesser qual-
ity quasi-experimental study designs (i.e. prospective longitudinal
cohorts). All study designs were of relatively low quality with almost

 all using before and after study designs without control groups. In fact,
only one accepted study had a control group [26]. Among accepted
studies, 4 were exclusively concerned with health outcomes, 3 in-
cluded both health and process outcomes and 15 included process
outcomes only (Fig. 2).
Health outcomes
Among the four accepted studies with health outcomes, only one found a
statistically significant impact of Lean. They found a reduced relative rate
of MRSA infections (RR = 2.47, 95% CI 1.87–3.27), although absolute
reductions were very small [15]. The largest study by far included six mil-
lion patients. This study found no impact of Lean on 30-day mortality
rate post-hospital discharge (RR = 0.08, 95% CI −0.30 to 0.46) [13].
The other two studies under this category found no statistically signifi-
cant impact on adverse events (RR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.72–1.16) or on
MRSA incidence (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.98–1.01) [14,16] (Table 1).
Process outcomes

process outcomes (including wait times, patient flow and workplace

 engagement, inclusion and productivity), only 2 found a statistically
significant positive effect of Lean. The benefits included reduced pa-
tient visits (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.33–2.56) and reduced surgical con-
sults (RR = 4.60, 95% CI 1.82–11.62) [24,29]. In five studies, rate
ratios and confidence intervals were not computed because the authors
did not include raw data (only summary data). None of the accepted
studies reviewed actual financial costs (Table 1).
Health and process outcomes
Of the three articles that evaluated both health and process outcomes,
only one article reported a positive effect of Lean in that it improved
time dependent stroke care (RR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.21–1.86) [34]. Con-
versely, in a large study of over 6.8 million patients, Lean had no stat-
istically significant impact on patients leaving without being seen
(RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.77–1.43), patients discharged within 48 h of
presentation (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.72–1.98) or number of patients re-
admitted to the hospital within 72-h of discharge (RR = 1.00, 95% CI
1.00–1.00) [32] (Table 1).
The largest Lean healthcare transformation in the
world – results from Saskatchewan
The HQC of Saskatchewan surveyed tens of thousands of patients dis-
charged from hospitals pre- and post-Lean [11]. In this systematic re-
view, the most relevant 30 outcomes are reported under the umbrella
of 5 broad groupings, which include: self-reported health, hospital ex-
perience, communication, respect and patient management. Among
the 30 outcomes considered, Lean had no statistically significant im-
pact in 27 of them (Table 2). For example, 30 574 patients were sur-
veyed on self-reported health with no observed impact from Lean
(RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.98–1.04). When measuring direct outcomes
for 90 000 patients on their experience with doctors (RR = 1.01,
95% CI 1.00–1.02) and nurses (RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.01), no
effect of Lean was observed. Only three outcomes showed statistically
significant positive outcomes of Lean including: staff washing or dis-
infecting their hands (RR = 1.179 07, 95% CI 1.05–1.10), staff check-
ing ID bands (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.06–1.10) and patients given safety
brochures (RR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.49–1.63). The results are found in
Table 2.
In 2014, the SUN randomly surveyed 1500 nurses on their Lean
experience [12]. Among nurses who had direct experience with Lean
(729–173 nurses—depending on the variable), 15 outcomes were re-
viewed. All 15 outcomes reported a statistically significant negative ef-
fect of Lean on nurse engagement, usefulness, patient care, time for
patient care, workplace issues, availability of supplies, workload,
stress and patient safety (Table 3). For example, the following out-
comes were reduced, nurse engagement (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.40–
0.65), quality of patient care (RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.17–0.31) and pa-
tient safety (RR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.37–0.53) while the nurses workload
and stress levels increased (RR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.24–0.35) (Table 3).
Discussion
The purpose of this systematic literature review was to independently
assess the effect of Lean thinking or Lean interventions on worker and
patient satisfaction, health and process outcomes and financial costs.
For worker satisfaction, the largest study was carried out by the
SUN. With every outcome reviewed, Lean had an overall negative ef-
fect on worker satisfaction [12]. Among other accepted studies from
the electronic search of peer reviewed articles, Lean was shown to
have no impact on workplace engagement, inclusion and productivity

 [26,27]. These outcomes are surprising in that worker engagement
and input are essential for Lean principles to succeed [2].
For patient satisfaction, the largest dataset available has been
collected by the Saskatchewan HQC [11]. When measuring direct out-
comes for patient experience with doctors and nurses, no statistically
significant positive or negative effect of Lean was observed. In the 22
studies accepted from the electronic search of peer reviewed articles,
none directly evaluated patient satisfaction. That is also surprising
because Lean reportedly begins with identifying and ‘removing
waste’ in order to ‘add value’ to the customer or patient [2]. That
said, it is unclear if other variables, like reduced number of medical
consultations were used as proxy outcomes for patient satisfaction
and what the patient’s perception is (positive or negative) as a result
of receiving less visits with their physician [24,29].
Among health outcomes like mortality, no study found a statistic-
ally significant impact of Lean. As mentioned previously, the largest
study included six million patients and found no impact of Lean on
30-day mortality rate post-hospital discharge [13]. This is perhaps
not surprising as Lean potentially only influences healthcare delivery.
It obviously has no impact on complex health outcomes like patient
adherence to care, let alone the behavioural or social determinants
of health [1].
With regard to safety and errors, our systematic review shows that
one study found no impact on adverse events while two studies had
conflicting results on the impact of Lean on MRSA incidence [14–
16]. The suggested impact of Lean on variables like adverse events is
interesting because hospitals everywhere have successfully implemen-
ted various safety interventions that have proved effective but are not
directly related with Lean. For example, the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality estimates that 1.3 million fewer patients were
harmed in American hospitals from 2010 to 2013. These outcomes
were mostly due to common sense efforts to reduce surgical site infec-
tions, adverse drug events and other preventable incidents. As such, it
is unclear what, if any, was the independent effect of Lean in compari-
son to a multitude of other diverse initiatives to promote safety and
reduce errors in healthcare [61].
Although reduced financial cost is a reported benefit of Lean, it is
worthy to note that we were unable to identify a single study that had
actual quantifiable data to that effect. The province of Saskatchewan
appears to be the only jurisdiction with actual financial cost

 information. External consultant fees were originally estimated to be
$40.5 million but were reduced to $35 million when the Lean contract
was terminated early [62]. Additionally, $17 million per year was
required for internal kaizen promotion offices or $51 million total
over the first 3 years. In return, official estimates of cost savings
from the Saskatchewan health regions totalled $56934.26 [63].

 If the numbers reported are accurate and true, it will mean that $1511
was spent on Lean for every one dollar saved by the province.
Strengths and limitations
The key strengths of our study are that it was a systematic review of
Lean interventions in healthcare, it used a quality control checklist,
and included a separate examination of both peer-reviewed articles
and grey literature. There are also several limitations to our study.
First, there are many and quite differing definitions of Lean in health-
care. This study did not attempt to strictly define what Lean is but ra-
ther relied on the definitions used by the authors of the articles
included in our systematic review. Second, the outcomes were too di-
verse to permit a meta-analysis. Third, the study designs under review
did not incorporate the use of control groups and therefore, it is un-
clear if the results are actually valid or what the results would be in
comparison with a control group. Finally, the pre Lean HQC data
for the province of Saskatchewan includes three small pilot projects
in three health regions. However, month-to-month comparisons pre-
and post-Lean found no statistically significant difference from the
small pilot projects.
Comparison of findings
The results of our systematic review on Lean thinking and Lean inter-
ventions in healthcare provide additional insight and support the find-
ings of other recent systematic reviews [5,64]. For example, Vest et al.
[5] concluded that Lean interventions mainly focused on process
outcomes in healthcare. Similarly, a Lean review completed by
Mason et al. [64] found that the studies demonstrated improved pro-
cess outcomes.
However, both Vest et al. [5] and Mason et al. [64] acknowledged
that when critically examined, only a few articles met the inclusion cri-
teria for their respective reviews. While Lean was found to be success-
ful in some process outcomes, there were several and serious concerns
with the reported study findings. Specifically, they noted that the
articles reviewed were fraught with systematic bias, imprecision and
serious methodological limitations, which undermined the validity
of the results and made measuring and interpreting the true and inde-
pendent effect of Lean on process and healthcare outcomes unclear
and difficult.
Conclusion
The findings of our systematic review suggest that Lean interventions
have: (i) no statistically significant association with patient satisfaction
and health outcomes, (ii) a negative association with financial costs
and worker satisfaction and (iii) potential yet inconsistent benefits
on process outcomes like patient flow (reduced patient visits, reduced
surgical consults, improved time dependent care) and safety (washing
hands, staff checking ID bands and giving patients safety brochures).
More rigorous, higher quality and better conducted scientific re-
search is required to definitively ascertain the impact and effectiveness
of Lean in healthcare settings.
While some may strongly believe that Lean interventions lead to
quality improvements in healthcare, the evidence to date simply
does not support this claim. It is far more likely that Lean is but one
of many strategies that might or might not have an impact on health-
care delivery.
The reality is that there are a multitude of internal and external
variables that impact complex healthcare and process outcomes and
that the independent effect of a specific intervention such as Lean is
