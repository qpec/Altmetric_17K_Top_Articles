 The Burden of Primary Liver Cancer and Underlying Etiologies
From 1990 to 2015 at the Global, Regional, and National Level
Results From the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015
Global Burden of Disease Liver Cancer Collaboration
IMPORTANCE Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths globally. The most
common causes for liver cancer include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection and alcohol use.
OBJECTIVE To report results of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study on primary
liver cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 countries or
territories from 1990 to 2015, and present global, regional, and national estimates on the
burden of liver cancer attributable to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and an “
other”group that
encompasses residual causes.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Mortality was estimated using vital registration and
cancer registry data in an ensemble modeling approach. Single-cause mortality estimates
were adjusted for all-cause mortality. Incidence was derived from mortality estimates and the
mortality-to-incidence ratio. Through a systematic literature review, data on the proportions
of liver cancer due to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and other causes were identified. Years of life lost
were calculated by multiplying each death by a standard life expectancy. Prevalence was
estimated using mortality-to-incidence ratio as surrogate for survival. Total prevalence was
divided into 4 sequelae that were multiplied by disability weights to derive years lived with
disability (YLDs). DALYs were the sum of years of life lost and YLDs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Liver cancer mortality, incidence, YLDs, years of life lost,
DALYs by etiology, age, sex, country, and year.
RESULTS There were 854 000 incident cases of liver cancer and 810 000 deaths globally in
2015, contributing to 20 578 000 DALYs. Cases of incident liver cancer increased by 75%
between 1990 and 2015, of which 47% can be explained by changing population age
structures, 35% by population growth, and −8% to changing age-specific incidence rates.
The male-to-female ratio for age-standardized liver cancer mortality was 2.8. Globally, HBV
accounted for 265 000 liver cancer deaths (33%), alcohol for 245 000 (30%), HCV for
167 000 (21%), and other causes for 133 000 (16%) deaths, with substantial variation
between countries in the underlying etiologies.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths in
many countries. Causes of liver cancer differ widely among populations. Our results show
that most cases of liver cancer can be prevented through vaccination, antiviral treatment,
safe blood transfusion and injection practices, as well as interventions to reduce excessive
alcohol use. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, the identification and
elimination of risk factors for liver cancer will be required to achieve a sustained reduction in
liver cancer burden. The GBD study can be used to guide these prevention efforts.

in 2015 after lung, colorectal, and stomach cancer.1 The

patocellular carcinoma, followed by cholangiocarcinoma.2
Liver cancer burden varies markedly by sex and geographic
region due to risk factor exposure.3 Major risk factors include
infections (hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV],
liver flukes in endemic areas), behavioral factors (alcohol,
tobacco), metabolic factors (excess body fatness), and
aflatoxins.4,5
As part of the Sustainable Development Goals and World
Health Organization strategies for noncommunicable dis-
eases and viral hepatitis, primary prevention targets include
eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by
2030, reducing the harmful use of alcohol and tobacco, and
controlling diabetes and obesity.6,7 Because of the lag be-
tween risk factor exposure and development of liver cancer,
even best-case scenarios of these prevention approaches are
unlikelytoreducethenumberofpatientswithlivercancerthat
health care systems have to accommodate in the foreseeable
future. The analysis of liver cancer as part of the Global Bur-
den of Disease (GBD) 2015 study therefore serves 2 main pur-
poses: first, to provide detailed information on liver cancer eti-
ologies and their trends over time, without which targeted
prevention strategies are impossible to design and to evalu-
ate; and second, to promote strategic investments into re-
search and clinical resources.
Prior studies analyzing liver cancer burden have either
focused on single countries or regions, single years, or a sub-
set of the most common etiologies like HBV and HCV.8-14 To
our knowledge, no prior study has provided estimates for all
countries,overtime,coveringthemainriskfactorsforlivercan-
cer. In this study we report results of the GBD 2015 study on
primary liver cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 countries or territories from
1990 to 2015 by sex, as well as on the burden of liver cancer
attributable to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and a remaining “other”
group that encompasses residual causes.
Methods
General methods for the GBD 2015 study have been pub-
lished previously.1,15 Herein, we present methods pertaining
to the liver cancer estimation. Descriptions of the estimation
process are available in the eAppendix in Supplement 1 (eFig-
ure 1, eFigure 2, and eTable 1).
The estimation process starts with liver cancer mortality,
which we estimated using vital registration system data and
cancer registry incidence data that were transformed to mor-
tality estimates using separately modeled mortality-to-
incidence ratios.16 Data were processed to adjust for aggre-
gated causes, age groups, or uninformative causes of death.1
Liver cancer mortality was modeled by developing a large set
of plausible models using different model types and combi-
nations of covariates, that were tested using out-of-sample
predictive validity (eTable 3 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1).17
The 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles from 1000 draws of the poste-
rior distribution were used to generate 95% uncertainty
intervals (UI). Liver cancer mortality was scaled with other
causes of death to sum to 100% of the demographic esti-
mates of all-cause mortality.1 Years of life lost were calcu-
lated by multiplying each death by the standard life
expectancy.1 To generate mortality estimates for 4 liver can-
cer etiologies, proportions of liver cancer due to different
causes were identified in a systematic review (eTable 5 in
Supplement 1). Cases were attributed to HBV, HCV, alcohol,
and other causes, which include remaining etiologies like
liver flukes, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and aflatoxins. To
estimate proportions for all locations, by sex, and over time,
models were generated using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian
meta-regression model (eAppendix in Supplement 1).18 Liver
cancer mortality estimates were split into etiologies using
the modeled proportions. Liver cancer incidence was esti-
mated by dividing mortality by mortality-to-incidence
ratios. Survival was estimated based on a theoretical best
and worst liver cancer survival and a scaling factor derived
from age-standardized mortality-to-incidence ratios.16
Prevalence was calculated using incidence and survival esti-
mates and divided into 4 phases reflecting changing disabil-
ity during: (1) diagnosis and treatment; (2) remission; (3) dis-
seminated; and (4) terminal phase. Prevalence for each
phase was multiplied by distinct disability weights to gener-
ate years lived with disability (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).19
The sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability
represents DALYs. One DALY can be interpreted as 1 lost year
of “healthy life.
”
To group countries with similar development status, a So-
ciodemographic Index (SDI) was used, which combines total
fertility rate, average educational attainment in the popula-
tion over age 15, and measures of income per capita (eFigure
3 and eTable 7 in the Supplement 1).1
To assess the contribution of demographic vs epidemio-
logical changes, we decomposed trends into 3 components—
population aging, growth, and change in age-specific rates.1,20

Key Points
Question What is the burden of liver cancer globally, what are
the major risk factors for liver cancer across countries, regions,
and at the global level and how did these change between 1990
and 2015?
Findings There were 854 000 incident liver cancer cases and
810 000 deaths globally in 2015, contributing to 20 578 000
disability-adjusted life-years. Hepatitis B virus infection accounted
for 265 000 liver cancer deaths (33%), alcohol for 245 000
(30%), hepatitis C virus infection for 167 000 (21%), and other
causes for 133 000 (16%) deaths.
Meaning Most cases of liver cancer can be prevented through
vaccination, antiviral treatment, safe blood transfusion and
injection practices, as well as interventions to reduce excessive
alcohol use.

Liver Cancer Burden
There were 854 000 incident liver cancer cases and 810 000
deaths globally in 2015, contributing to 20 578 000 DALYs
(Table; Supplement 2). Liver cancer was the sixth most com-
mon-incident cancer worldwide and the fourth most com-
mon cause of cancer death (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). Eighty-
eight percent of incident liver cancer cases and 86% of liver
cancer deaths occurred in middle-SDI, high-middle–SDI, and
high-SDI countries compared with low-middle–SDI and low-
SDI countries. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) were
thehighestinmiddle-SDIcountries,followedbylow-SDIcoun-
tries (Table).
The highest burden of liver cancer incident cases, deaths,
and DALYs was observed in East Asia. High-income Asia
Pacific had the second most incident cases but only the third
highest number of deaths and the fourth highest number of
DALYs. Within high-income Asia Pacific, Japan was the driver
behind this finding with 75% of incident cases of which 67%
were due to HCV. Western Europe ranked third for liver can-
cer incident cases, fourth for liver cancer deaths, and fifth for
total DALYs. Southeast Asia experienced the fourth highest
number of incident liver cancer cases but ranked second for
liver cancer deaths and DALYs. The highest ASIR in 2015 were
in high-income Asia Pacific, followed by East Asia and West-
ern sub-Saharan Africa (Table).
Time Trends Between 1990 and 2015
Between 1990 and 2015, liver cancer incident cases in-
creased by 75% (eFigure 5 in Supplement 1) with changing age
structures contributing 47%, population growth contributing
35%, and changing age-specific incidence rates contributing
−8% to the overall increase. Because of decreases in age-
specific incidence rates for HBV-related liver cancer, and liver
cancer due to other causes, incident cases due to HBV would
have decreased by 35% and liver cancer due to other causes
by 25% between 1990 and 2015, if population size and age
structure had remained the same. However, owing to demo-
graphicchangesofpopulationgrowthandaging,incidentcases
increased by 42% and 56%, respectively. For HCV-related and
alcohol-related liver cancer incidence, demographic changes,
as well as increases in age-specific rates, led to the overall in-
crease of 114% and 109%, respectively (Figure 1; eFigure 5 in
Supplement 1).
The pattern of change for ASIR between 1990 and 2015
shows a substantial increase of over 100% in many high-SDI
countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zea-
land, and most European countries, but also in the Philip-
pines, Guatemala, Romania, and the Seychelles. At the same
time, some countries with high incidence rates like China
and countries in Western and Eastern sub-Saharan Africa
have experienced a decrease of over 20% in ASIR (eFigure 5
in Supplement 1). Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR)
between 1990 and 2015 more than doubled in the Philip-
pines, Moldova, and Guatemala. During the same period,
ASMR declined substantially in regions with high liver can-
cer burden such as East Asia and Western sub-Saharan Africa
(Figure 2).
Sex Differences
Only 14% of studies used in our analysis of liver cancer etiolo-
gies reported underlying causes by sex. Using this informa-
tiononsexdifferences,livercancerwasmorecommoninmen,
with 591 000 incident cases compared with women with
264 000 cases. Similar patterns were observed for mortality
(577 000 in men vs 234 000 in women) and DALYs (15 413 000
in men vs 5 165 000 in women) (Table).
At the global level, the male-to-female ratios for ASIR and
ASMR rates were 2.5 and 2.8, respectively, while the male-to-
female ratio was 3.1 for age-standardized DALY rates (Table).
The male-to-female ratio for ASIR was highest in East Asia at
2.9 and lowest in Andean Latin America at 0.9 (eTable 8 in
Supplement 1).
Marked differences at the global level exist by sex for
HBV-related and alcohol-related liver cancer. In 2015, HBV
caused 203 000 (95% UI, 171 000-251 000) incident liver
cancer cases in men, but only 70 000 (95% UI, 57 000-
86 000) cases in women. Alcohol caused 204 000 (95% UI,
177 000-240 000) liver cancer cases in men, but only 45 000
(95% UI, 38 000-54 000) cases among women in 2015
(eTable 1 in Supplement 1).
Liver Cancer Burden by Cause Group
In 2015 at the global level, HBV was the leading cause of inci-
dent cases of liver cancer, deaths, and DALYs, followed by
alcohol (eTable 9 in Supplement 1).
Between 1990 and 2015, cases of liver cancer, deaths, and
DALYs increased for all cause groups globally. The highest in-
crease in incident cases was due to HCV, followed by alcohol.
Between 1990 and 2015, ASIR for liver cancer due to HBV
decreased by 18.9% (not statistically significant). During the
same time, liver cancer ASIR due to HCV increased signifi-
cantly by 15.7%. For liver cancer due to alcohol and other
causes, ASIR did not change significantly at the global level
(eTable 9 in Supplement 1).
The contribution of different etiologies to total liver can-
cer deaths varies markedly between countries and regions
(eTable 10 in Supplement 1). At the global level in 2015, HBV
wasresponsiblefor33%oflivercancermortality;alcohol,30%;
HCV, 21%; and other causes, 16%. Hepatitis B infection was the
least common cause of liver cancer deaths in Southern Latin
America at 6% and the most common in Western sub-Saharan
Africa and Andean Latin America at 45%. Hepatitis C virus in-
fection was the least common cause of liver cancer deaths in
East Asia (9%) and the most common cause in the high-
income Asia Pacific region (55%). The contribution of alcohol
was lowest, at 13%, in North Africa and the Middle East, and
highest in Eastern Europe at 53%. The etiological subgroup
“other causes” was the least common cause for liver cancer
deaths in high-income Asia Pacific at 6% and the most com-
mon cause in Oceania at 27%. At the country level in 2015, HBV
contributed the largest proportion to liver cancer mortality in
Gambia, at 60%, and the smallest in Mexico, at 4%. Hepatitis
C virus infection contributed the most to liver cancer mortality

 in Japan, at 69%, and the least in Senegal, at 7%. Alcohol was
the largest contributor to liver cancer mortality in 2015 in Be-
larus and the smallest contributor in Iran. Liver cancer due to
other causes was the largest contributor to overall liver cancer
mortality in Indonesia, at 39%, and the smallest contributor in
South Korea, at 5% (eTable 10 in Supplement 1).
Discussion
As part of the GBD 2015 study, we estimated the burden of liver
cancer due to the main causes at the global, regional, and na-
tional levels to inform strategic planning of prevention pro-
grams, as well as research and health system resource alloca-
tion. Our results are in line with previous studies showing that
livercancerisamongtheleadingcausesofcancerdeathsworld-
wide and that the liver cancer etiologies differ substantially be-
tween locations.21-23 However, whereas prior studies have fo-
cused on single aspects of liver cancer epidemiology like
incidencetrendsinselectedcountries,orcross-sectionalanaly-
ses of risk factors, the GBD provides a comprehensive analysis
of all countries, over time, for the most important etiologies.
Analyzing time trends allows for identification of success-
ful strategies as well as concerning patterns. At the global level,
our decomposition analysis shows that liver cancer incident
cases owing to HBV and other causes would have decreased
between 1990 and 2015 if the demographic profile and popu-
lation size had remained the same. In the same scenario, liver
cancer caused by HCV and alcohol would have increased be-
cause of a rise in age-specific rates. These findings highlight 2
importantissues.First,primarylivercancerpreventionthrough
HBV vaccination is starting to show successes; and second,
health care systems not only have to invest in prevention but
also have to plan for the increasing number of patients with
liver cancer that they will face despite prevention programs.
Obvious targets for primary prevention include liver can-
cers due to HBV and HCV. Assuming that present HBV vacci-
nation trends continue, between 2020 and 2050, the num-
ber of new HBV infections is estimated to drop by 70%. The
reduction of chronic infections would be even larger if HBV
birth dose vaccination would increase from the current level
of 39% to the 2030 target of 90%.6,24 Other recommended ap-
proaches include implementation of safe injection and trans-
fusionpractices,improveddiagnosesofchronicinfections,and
increased treatment for HBV and HCV.6 Our findings show that
not just population aging and growth but also increasing in-
cidence rates of liver cancer due to HCV are driving the over-
all rise in HCV-related liver cancer. This stresses the impor-
tance of prevention as well as accessibility and affordability
of the highly effective HCV antiviral medication.25,26
For liver cancer due to alcohol, our analysis showed in-
creasing age-specific incidence rates between 1990 and 2015,
highlighting the need for strategies to decrease the harmful
use of alcohol.27,28

 Liver cancer due to other causes showed the smallest in-
crease in incident cases among the 4 etiologies and decreas-
ing age-specific rates in our decomposition analysis. This find-
ing, however, masks etiologies that are currently included in
the “other” group and that can be leading causes in certain lo-
cations, like liver flukes in Asia and Eastern Europe; aflatoxin
in Asia, parts of Africa, and Latin America; and nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis in South America and the Middle East.29-31
At the national level, some countries have made progress
in reducing liver cancer burden over the past decades, as pre-
viously documented.2,32,33 China, for example, experienced a
significant decrease in the ASMR of 33% (95% UI, −40.2% to
−17.6%) between 1990 and 2015, possibly owing to reduced af-
latoxins exposure and to some extent due to national HBV vac-
cination programs.32,34,35 Despite this decrease in ASMR, the
number of deaths due to liver cancer in China increased by
33.8% between 1990 and 2015. In neighboring Mongolia no ap-
parentprogresshasbeenmadeduringthistimeframeandliver
cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths with an
increase of 171% between 1990 and 2015.16,36
Among high-SDI countries, the United States, Canada, and
Australia stand out with a greater than 20% increase in liver
cancer ASMR between 1990 and 2015. In the United States this
is partially due to the cohort effect of high HCV prevalence
among adults born between 1945 and 1965 associated with in-
jection drug use and transfusion of unsafe blood products.9
Liver cancer ASMR due to alcohol, other causes, and HBV also
increased in the United States between 2005 and 2015. In-
creasing liver cancer due to HBV in the United States and other
high net-migration countries can in part be attributed to the
burden of undiagnosed and untreated HBV infection in mi-
grants from high-prevalence settings infected since early
childhood.37 Hepatitis B testing and treatment in these popu-
lations, despite being cost-effective, has yet to be widely
adopted.38
Even with successful primary prevention strategies, cases
of liver cancer are likely to increase over the next decades ow-
ing to population aging and growth. Secondary prevention
is therefore equally as important. The resource-stratified
guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma management by the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend screen-
ing high-risk groups with liver ultrasonography and α-feto-
protein blood tests at all levels of resources.39 Secondary pre-
vention is only indicated and ethically appropriate if treatment
is available. Health system planning therefore needs to focus
on ensuring availability of imaging including interventional ra-
diology, pathology, surgical and palliative care specialties.
Given the disappointing results of systemic hepatocellular car-
cinoma treatments, research on new approaches is urgently
needed. Treatment for advanced disease has been especially
unsatisfactorywithsorafenibbeingtheonlyapproveddrugbut
leading to only modest survival benefits.40 Developments in
immunotherapy are promising and might be feasible to use
even in the setting of limited health care resources if treat-
ment is affordable.41
Limitations
The GBD estimates, as well as estimates from other groups
like Globocan, depend on the quality and quantity of data
used in the modeling.8 The wide geographic variation in the
availability of high-quality cause of death and cancer regis-
try data are reflected in the uncertainty associated with the
GBD estimates. It is encouraging that despite data scarcity
and different estimation methods, most Globocan estimates
fall within the 95% UIs of the GBD estimates (eTable 11 in
Supplement 1).
The main data quality issues for the liver cancer burden
estimation are miscoding of liver metastases as primary liver
cancers, underreporting of liver cancer on death certificates,
and underestimation of liver cancer due to lack of diagnostic
capacity.42,43 The methodological framework of the GBD tries
to account for these difficulties. Redistribution of undefined
causes of death or cancer to the most likely underlying cause
accounts for underdiagnosis.44
For the etiological attribution of the liver cancer burden,
HBV and HCV related cases are less prone to misclassification
based on the use of objective laboratory assessments, in con-
trast to self-reported data for alcohol use. A caveat when com-

 paring studies that exclusively examined viral risk factors to
our study is that if more than 1 cause was reported, we appor-
tioned coexposures to multiple causes proportionally be-
tween the causes. When information was only available for vi-
ral risk factors, the proportions of liver cancer owing to alcohol
andothercausesintheselocationsarebasedoncovariatesused
in the proportion models. This can lead to underestimation
of viral etiologies, as is the case for liver cancer due to HBV
in Taiwan, for example, where the proportion of 27% is lower
than published studies.45
Sexdifferencesinthelivercanceretiologieswasonlyavail-
able for a limited number of studies. The validity of applying
these patterns to all studies is therefore unclear.
For GBD 2015 we assessed only the major liver cancer
etiologies. For future iterations of the GBD, inclusion of
additional etiologies as well as estimating the burden
of cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma sepa-
rately should be considered.
Conclusions
Liver cancer remains a major public health burden globally.
The major causes for liver cancer are highly preventable or
treatable. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals,
the Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016 to
2021, and the World Health Organization Global Strategy to
Reduce Harmful Use of Alcohol, concerted prevention efforts
will be required to achieve a sustained reduction in liver can-
cer. The GBD study provides the most current overview of
the burden and etiology of liver cancer and can guide invest-
ments in targeted liver cancer prevention efforts.
