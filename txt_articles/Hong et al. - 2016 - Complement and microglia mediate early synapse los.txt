Synapse loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) correlates with cognitive decline. Involvement
of microglia and complement in AD has been attributed to neuroinflammation,
prominent late in disease. Here we show in mouse models that complement and microglia
mediate synaptic loss early in AD. C1q, the initiating protein of the classical
complement cascade, is increased and associated with synapses before overt plaque
deposition. Inhibition of C1q, C3, or the microglial complement receptor CR3 reduces the
number of phagocytic microglia, as well as the extent of early synapse loss. C1q is
necessary for the toxic effects of soluble b-amyloid (Ab) oligomers on synapses and
hippocampal long-term potentiation. Finally, microglia in adult brains engulf synaptic
material in a CR3-dependent process when exposed to soluble Ab oligomers. Together,
these findings suggest that the complement-dependent pathway and microglia that
prune excess synapses in development are inappropriately activated and mediate
synapse loss in AD.
G
enome-wide association studies impli-
cate microglia and complement-related
pathways in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (1).
Previous research has demonstrated both
beneficial and detrimental roles of com-
plement and microglia in plaque-related neuro-
pathology (2, 3); however, their roles in synapse
loss, a major pathological correlate of cognitive
decline in AD (4), remain to be identified. Emerg-
ing research implicates microglia and immune-
related mechanisms in brain wiring in the healthy
brain (1). During development, C1q and C3 local-
ize to synapses and mediate synapse elimination
by phagocytic microglia (5–7). We hypothesized
that this normal developmental synaptic pruning
pathway is activated early in the AD brain and
mediates synapse loss.
The degree of region-specific synapse loss is
a stronger correlate of cognitive decline in AD
than counts of plaques, tangles, and neuronal
loss (8, 9). To determine how early synapse loss
occurs, we used superresolution structured illu-
mination microscopy (SIM) (10) to quantify syn-
apse density in hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum
of familial AD-mutant human amyloid precursor
protein (hAPP) (“J20”) transgenic mice (11). Quan-
tification of colocalized pre- and postsynaptic
puncta [synaptophysin and postsynaptic den-
sity 95 (PSD95) (Fig. 1A); synaptotagmin and
homer (fig. S1, A to D)] revealed a significant loss
of synapses in J20 hippocampus at 3 to 4 months
old (mo), an age that precedes plaque deposition
(11, 12). Synapse loss in preplaque J20 CA1 was
confirmed by electron microscopy (fig. S1G). Con-
focal imaging also showed synapse loss in CA1,
CA3, and dentate gyrus of 3 mo J20 hippo-
campus but not in striatum (fig. S1E). Synapse

 levels were not altered in 1 mo J20 brains ver-
sus wild-type (WT) littermates (fig. S1F), sug-
gesting that the hippocampal synaptic loss at
3 mo is likely not a result of abnormal synaptic
development.
We asked whether the classical complement
cascade is up-regulated in preplaque brains when
synapses are already vulnerable. C1q immuno-
reactivity (13) (antibody now available at Abcam)
was elevated in J20 brains as early as 1 mo and
preceding synapse loss (Fig. 1B and fig. S1). C1q
elevation was region-specific, particularly in
the hippocampus and frontal cortex, two regions
vulnerable to synapse loss (14) (Fig. 1B and fig.
S2A). C1q immunoreactivity was comparable be-
tween J20 and WT mice at postnatal day 21 (P21)
(fig. S2B), suggesting that elevated levels at 1 mo
are likely not a developmental artifact. C1q was
also similarly increased in the hippocampus of
another model of AD, the APP/PS1 (presenilin 1)
mice (15) (fig. S2C). Notably, SIM demonstrated
colocalization of C1q with PSD95-positive puncta
in 1 mo J20 hippocampus (Fig. 1C). A higher
percentage of PSD95 colocalized with C1q in
the hippocampus of J20 mice than in that of
WT littermates (Fig. 1D and fig. S3), suggesting
that the C1q-associated synapses may be marked
for elimination.
Punctate Ab was found deposited in J20 hip-
pocampus at 1 mo (fig. S4), long before Ab
plaques deposit (11, 12), raising the question of
whether C1q increase in these preplaque brains
is dependent on soluble Ab levels. To test this
hypothesis, we injected the mice with compound
E, a g-secretase inhibitor that rapidly decreases
Ab production (12). Compound E markedly re-
duced soluble Ab levels in J20 mice; there was
a corresponding reduction of C1q deposition
(Fig. 1E), suggesting that Ab up-regulates C1q.

 To further address whether the increase of C1q
is dependent on soluble Ab, and if so, which
species, we injected soluble Ab oligomers or
monomers into lateral ventricles of WT mice.
Hippocampus contralateral to the injection site
was examined to avoid any surgery-related ef-
fects. Oligomeric Ab (oAb), which is prefibrillar
in nature and acts as a mediator of synapse loss
and dysfunction in AD (4), but not the relatively
innocuous monomeric Ab or vehicle, induced
C1q deposition (Fig. 2A and fig. S5). A higher
percentage of PSD95 colocalized with C1q in
oAb-injected versus monomer-injected mice (Fig.
2B), in a manner similar to this colocalization in
J20 mice. Together, these findings show an early
and aberrant increase and synaptic localization
of C1q in multiple AD model systems. Further-
more, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
demonstrated up-regulated C1qa expression in
microglia (fig. S6), implicating microglia as a major
source of C1q in these preplaque brains.
To test whether C1q and oAb act in a common
pathway to eliminate synapses, we injected oAb
into lateral ventricles of C1qa knockout (KO) mice
(16). Soluble oAb induced a significant loss of co-
localized synapsin- and PSD95-immunoreactive
puncta in WT mice within 72 hours (Fig. 3A, left
panel) (17). In contrast, oAb failed to induce syn-
apse loss in C1qa KO mice (Fig. 3A, right panel),
suggesting that C1q is required for oAb-induced
synapse loss in vivo. To determine whether local,
acute inhibition of C1 activation could similarly
blunt the synaptotoxic effects of oAb, we used
an antibody against C1q (anti-C1q) (ANX-M1,
Annexon Biosciences), which blocks the classical
complement cascade (see fig. S7 and supplemen-
tary methods). Coadministration of the ANX-M1
anti-C1q antibody, but not its immunoglobulin G
(IgG) isotype control, prevented oAb from inducing
synapse loss in WT mice (Fig. 3B). Thus, block-
ing C1 activation by either genetic or antibody-
mediated means lessened oAb’s synaptotoxic
effects.
To determine whether C1q is associated with
synaptic dysfunction, we asked whether the
established ability of oAb to potently inhibit
long-term potentiation (LTP) (4) was depen-
dent on C1q. We tested the functional effects of
the ANX-M1 anti-C1q antibody in acute hippo-
campal slices treated with oAb. IgG alone had
negligible effects on LTP induction in WT mouse
hippocampal slices and on the ability of oAb to
inhibit LTP; however, pretreatment of hippo-
campal slices with the anti-C1q antibody signif-
icantly prevented the impairment of LTP by oAb
(Fig. 3C). Neither ANX-M1 nor its IgG control
altered basal synaptic neurotransmission (fig. S8).
Collectively, these results in hippocampal slices
and in mice support C1q as a key mediator of
oAb-induced synaptic loss and dysfunction.
In the healthy developing brain, C1q promotes
activation of C3, which opsonizes subsets of
synapses for elimination, a process that is down-
regulated in the mature brain (5, 6). However,
oAb induced a significant C3 deposition in WT
adult mice (fig. S7A, upper panel). This was sig-
nificantly reduced in both the C1qa KO (fig. S7A,
lower panel) and the ANX-M1 anti-C1q antibody–
treated WT mice (fig. S7B), suggesting that the
C3 deposition in this model is downstream of
the classical complement cascade. Consistent
with these findings, a higher percentage of PSD95
colocalized with C3 in J20 and APP/PS1 brains
(Fig. 3D and fig. S9). To determine whether C3
is necessary for early synapse loss in AD genetic
models, we crossed APP/PS1 mice, which, simi-
lar to the J20 mice, had a significant increase
and localization of C1q and C3 onto hippocampal
synapses (figs. S2C and S9), to C3-deficient mice
(18). Quantification of colocalized pre- and post-
synaptic puncta demonstrated synapse loss in
4 mo APP/PS1 hippocampus as compared to WT;
however, APP/PS1xC3 KO mice did not display
this synapse loss (Fig. 3, E and F). Together, our
data indicate that genetic deletion of C3 amelio-
rates synapse loss in APP/PS1 mice, providing
further evidence that the classical complement
cascade mediates early synapse loss in AD mouse
models.
Microglia express complement receptors and
mediate synaptic pruning in the developing brain
(1, 6), raising the question of whether this normal
developmental pruning pathway could be acti-
vated to mediate synapse loss in the preplaque
AD brain. Consistent with this hypothesis, mi-
croglia had increased amounts of the lysosomal
protein CD68 in J20 hippocampus compared
to WT and less so in striatum, a less vulnerable
region (figs. S1C and S10). Furthermore, in WT
mice challenged with oAb, microglia had sig-
nificantly increased levels of CD68 immuno-
reactivity (Fig. 2C). However, in C1qa KO mice
in which synapse loss was rescued, oAb failed
to induce such an increase (Fig. 2D), suggesting
that microglia eliminate synapses through the
complement pathway.
To directly test whether phagocytic microg-
lia engulf synaptic elements, we adapted our
in vivo synaptic engulfment assay (19) using in-
tracerebroventricular injections of Ab in homer-
GFP (green fluorescent protein) mice (20) (Fig.
4A). oAb induced a significantly higher volume
of internalized homer-GFP in microglia than
monomeric Ab controls did at the contralateral
hippocampus (Fig. 4B), indicating that microglia
engulf synaptic elements when challenged with
oAb. Internalized homer-GFP often colocalized

 with CD68 (fig. S11A), suggesting that the en-
gulfed synapses are internalized into lysosom-
al compartments in a manner similar to that
of developmental synaptic pruning (6). Notab-
ly, oAb failed to increase synaptic engulfment
in microglia lacking CR3 (21), a high-affinity
receptor for C3 expressed on macrophages
[homer-GFPxCR3 KO versus homer-GFP mice,
which received tail vein injections of phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) or oAb (Fig. 4C)]. These
data demonstrate that CR3 is necessary for
oAb-dependent engulfment of synapses by
microglia.
To test whether inhibition in microglial en-
gulfment leads to protection against oAb-induced
synapse loss, we performed tail vein injections
of oAb into WT and CR3 KO mice. oAb induced
synapse loss in the hippocampus of WT mice
but not in that of CR3 KO mice (Fig. 4D). All
CR3-positive microglia were P2RY12-positive
(fig. S11), indicating that they are resident cells
(22). Altogether, these results suggest that resi-
dent microglia engulf synaptic material when chal-
lenged by oAb through a complement-dependent
mechanism.
Synaptic deficits occur in early AD and mild
cognitive impairment before onset of plaques and
are some of the first signs of the neuronal de-
generative process (4, 23–25). Here we identify
critical synaptotoxic roles of complement and
microglia in AD models before plaque forma-
tion and neuroinflammation, in regions of the
hippocampus undergoing synapse loss. Using
multiple experimental approaches, we demon-
strate a region-specific increase of phagocytic
microglia and accumulation of C1q and C3 on
synapses in preplaque brains. Microglia in the
adult brain, when challenged with synapto-
toxic, soluble Ab oligomers, engulf synapses in
the absence of plaque aggregates; deletion of
CR3 blocks this process. Finally, inhibiting C1q,
C3, or CR3 activity rescues synaptic loss and
dysfunction.
Our data suggest a local activation of a de-
velopmental pruning pathway (5, 6) as a key
mechanism underlying oAb-induced synapse
loss in preplaque AD brain. C1q is aberrantly
increased by diffusible oAb in a region-specific
manner and deposits onto synapses, triggering
the activation of downstream classical comple-
ment pathway and phagocytic microglia. Block-
ing Ab production in J20 mice significantly
ameliorated C1q deposition in the hippocampus,
and genetic or antibody-mediated inhibition of
complement blocks oAb from inducing microg-
lial synaptic engulfment, synapse loss, and LTP
inhibition. These complementary findings have
direct therapeutic relevance.
We propose a model in which C1q and oAb
operate in a common pathway to activate the
complement cascade and drive synapse elimi-
nation by microglia through CR3 (fig. S12). This
could occur in multiple ways: Soluble oAb asso-
ciates with synaptic membranes and other syn-
aptic markers (4, 26); thus, oAb bound to synapses
may anchor C1q directly. Alternatively, oAb
binding to synapses may weaken the synapse
(4) and expose a C1q receptor. Although spe-
cific receptors for C1q at synapses are not yet
known, we have shown that C1q binds syn-
apses in vulnerable regions undergoing syn-
apse loss (5, 27). It is also plausible that oAb
and C1q may work indirectly to mediate syn-
apse loss through cytokines such as trans-
forming growth factor–b (7), through microglial
or astrocytic activation, or through other mech-
anisms, including major histocompatibility
complex class I (MHCI)–PirB, another immune
pathway critical for synapse elimination in de-
velopment and AD (28–30).
Finally, our studies show that resident mi-
croglia in the adult central nervous system
phagocytose synapses when challenged by syn-
aptotoxic oAb, implicating microglia as poten-
tial cellular mediators of synapse loss. Although
microglia and complement activation are pro-
minently involved in plaque maintenance and
related periplaque neuropathology, their roles
have heretofore been largely regarded as a sec-
ondary event related to neuroinflammation (2).
Our studies directly challenge this view and sug-
gest that microglia and immune-related path-
ways can act as early mediators of synapse loss
and dysfunction that occur in AD models be-
fore plaques form. Although the complement
pathway may not be involved in all patholog-
ical routes to AD, including plaque-associated
synapse loss, the work reported here provides
new insights into how synapses are lost in AD.
It will be important in future studies to examine
whether this microglia or the complement-
dependent pathway also plays a role in plaque-
associated synapse loss or in other synaptopathies,
including tauopathies and Huntington’s dis-
ease. If so, our findings may suggest comple-
ment and microglia as potential early therapeutic
targets in AD and other neurodegenerative dis-
eases involving synaptic dysfunction and memory
decline.
