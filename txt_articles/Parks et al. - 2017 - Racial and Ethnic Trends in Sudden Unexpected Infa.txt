abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Immediately after the 1994 Back-to-Sleep campaign, sudden 
unexpected infant death (SUID) rates decreased dramatically, but they have remained 
relatively stable (93.4 per 100 000 live births) since 2000. In this study, we examined trends 
in SUID rates and disparities by race/ethnicity since the Back-to-Sleep campaign.
METHODS: We used 1995–2013 US period-linked birth-infant death data to evaluate SUID rates 
per 100 000 live births by non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), Hispanic, 
American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander racial/ethnic groupings. To 
examine racial/ethnic disparities, we calculated rate ratios with NHWs as the referent 
group. Unadjusted linear regression was used to evaluate trends (P < .05) in rates and rate 
ratios. The distribution and rates of SUID by demographic and birth characteristics were 
compared for 1995–1997 and 2011–2013, and χ2 tests were used to evaluate significance.
RESULTS: From 1995 to 2013, SUID rates were consistently highest for American Indian/
Alaska Natives, followed by NHBs. The rate for NHBs decreased significantly, whereas the 
rate for NHWs also declined, but not significantly. As a result, the disparity between NHWs 
and NHBs narrowed slightly. The SUID rates for Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders were 
lower than the rates for NHWs and showed a significant decrease, resulting in an increase 
in their advantage over NHWs.
CONCLUSIONS: Each racial/ethnic group showed a unique trend in SUID rates since the Back-to-
Sleep campaign. When implementing risk-reduction strategies, it is important to consider 
these trends in targeting populations for prevention and developing culturally appropriate 
approaches for racial/ethnic communities.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: Sudden 
unexpected infant death (SUID) rates decreased 
dramatically after the 1994 Back-to-Sleep campaign 
and have remained relatively stable since 2000. The 
changing epidemiology of SUID risk factors, including 
preterm birth and infant sleep practices, may have 
influenced race/ethnicity-specific SUID trends.
WhaT ThIs sTuDy aDDs: This is the first study to 
examine race/ethnicity-stratified trends in SUID 
rates from the United States. From 1995 through 
2013, there were unique SUID trends for each racial/
ethnic group, but the relative ranking of SUID rates 
did not significantly change.

Disparities in infant mortality 
between races/ethnicities in the 
United States are well documented.1 
Because the factors that impact infant 
mortality affect the health of the 
entire population, infant mortality 
is often used as an overall indicator 
of the health and well-being of a 
nation. Consequently, racial/ethnic 
disparities in infant mortality are 
an important aspect of the overall 
US health status. Although infant 
mortality rates declined throughout 
the 20th century, the decrease in 
infant mortality has slowed in recent 
years.2 In addition, infant mortality 
rates have declined differentially by 
race/ethnicity, causing disparities to 
shift.3
The leading causes of infant 
mortality are congenital anomalies, 
conditions associated with preterm 
birth, maternal complications of 
pregnancy, sudden infant death 
syndrome (SIDS), and injuries. In the 
post–neonatal period (28–364 days), 
the most prevalent causes shift. 
SIDS is the leading cause, followed 
by congenital malformations, 
deformations, and chromosomal 
abnormalities; other ill-defined and 
unspecified causes of mortality; and 
accidents.4 Among postneonatal 
deaths due to accidents, most 
(70%) are attributed to accidental 
suffocation and strangulation in bed 
(ASSB).5 SIDS and ASSB, along with 
other ill-defined and unspecified 
causes of mortality, comprise what 
are often referred to as sudden 
unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs).4, 
 
6  
Together, SUID accounts for >35% 
of postneonatal deaths.5 Although 
SUID rates decreased dramatically 
immediately after the 1994  
Back-to-Sleep campaign, they  
have remained relatively stable  
(93.4 per 100 000 live births) since 
2000.
As with infant mortality, racial/
ethnic differences in SUID rates 
exist.7 
– 
10 However, it is unknown 
whether racial/ethnic differences in 
SUID have changed. In this study, we 
examined trends in SUID rates and 
disparities by race/ethnicity from 
1995 to 2013, the time after  
the Back-to-Sleep campaign. In 
addition, we examined demographic 
and infant characteristics associated 
with SUID by race/ethnicity, 
including infant sex, age at death, 
season of death, and gestational age 
at birth.
MeThODs
We used 1995–2013 US period-
linked birth-infant death data to 
evaluate SUID rates per 100 000 live 
births by race/ethnicity. This period 
facilitated our focus on trends after 
the 1992 introduction of the Back-to-
Sleep campaign. From the available 
national data, we selected the  
period-linked data because it 
included the self-reported measure 
of maternal race/ethnicity from 
the birth certificate, which can 
be applied to both the numerator 
and denominator of the infant 
mortality rate and is more complete 
and reliable than that from other 
sources.11, 
 
12 Period-linked files were 
not produced by the National Center 
for Health Statistics from 1992 to 
1994.
We defined SUIDs as deaths assigned 
International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD), Ninth and Tenth 
Revisions (ICD-9 and ICD-10, 
respectively) codes for SIDS (798.0 
and R95), other ill-defined and 
unspecified causes of mortality 
(799.9 and R99), and ASSB (913.0 
and W75). ICD-9 codes were used 
for 1995–1998 data; ICD-10 codes 
were used for 1999–2013.6, 
 
13 These 
individual causes of death were 
grouped to address variations 
in reporting by death certifiers 
and allowed for more accurate 
comparisons in SUID trends.4 The 
race/ethnicities examined were non-
Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic 
black (NHB), Hispanic, American 
Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN), and 
Asian/Pacific Islander (API).
Infant age at death (in days) was 
derived by subtracting the birth 
date from the death date. If the 
reported age of death on the death 
certificate was <2 days, the reported 
age was used. If the exact date of 
birth and/or death was unknown, 
age was imputed.12 Season of death 
was calculated by using the month 
of death, with deaths in December 
through February recoded as “winter, 
” March through May as “spring, 
” 
June through August as “summer, 
” 
and September through November as 
“autumn.”
Gestational age was primarily based 
on mother’s last normal menstrual 
period (LMP). The obstetric estimate 
of gestation was used if the LMP 
date was not reported or was 
inconsistent with birth weight.12 
Although there is increasing evidence 
that obstetric estimates are more 
valid than LMP-based measures, 
the obstetric estimate was not 
available nationwide until 2007.14 
Thus, LMP-based gestational age 
was grouped as follows: extremely 
preterm (<28 weeks), very preterm 
(28 to <32 weeks), moderate preterm 
(32 to <34 weeks), late preterm 
(34 to <37 weeks), early term (37 
to <39 weeks), full term/late term 
(39 to <42 weeks), and post-term 
(≥42 weeks) as well as preterm 
(<37 weeks) and nonpreterm (≥37 
weeks).
Race/ethnicity-specific annual SUID 
rates per 100 000 live births were 
calculated. To examine racial/ethnic 
disparities, we calculated rate ratios 
with NHWs as the referent group. 
Unadjusted, race/ethnicity-stratified 
log-linear regression, with rates and 
rate ratios regressed on year, was 
used to evaluate trend significance 
(P < .05). Annual percentage changes 
(APCs) in rates and rate ratios were 
calculated as the multiplicative 
percentage change from each log-
linear model: APC = 100 × (eβ − 1), 
where β is the coefficient from the 
log-linear model.15 Regression

analyses were conducted by  
using the SAS system for  
Windows version 9.3 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC).
In addition to examining SUID rates 
by race/ethnicity, we assessed 
racial/ethnic differences in infant 
sex, age at death, season of death, 
and gestational age at birth. We 
compared proportions of SUIDs  
by age at death and season of death 
and SUID rates per 100 000 live 
births for infant sex and gestational 
age during early (1995–1997) versus 
late (2011–2013) years. The early 
and late periods were chosen to 
reflect the status of SUID as close 
as possible after the initiation of 
the Back-to-Sleep campaign and 
the according to the most recent 
available data. Three-year periods 
were used to increase population 
sizes and stabilize rate estimates  
for race/ethnicities. χ2 Tests (or 
Fisher’s exact test when cell sizes 
were small) were performed to 
assess significance in comparisons 
between rates in 1995–1997 and 
2011–2013.
ResulTs
Racial/ethnic differences in SUID 
rates were observed from 1995 to 
2013. Rates were consistently highest 
for AIANs, followed by NHBs. No 
significant change in NHW and AIAN 
SUID rates were observed (Table 1, 
 
Fig 1). The NHB SUID rate decreased 
significantly (APC: −0.7; 95% 
confidence interval: −0.42 to −0.96), 
whereas the NHW rate decreased, 
but nonsignificantly. Consequently, 
a slight narrowing of the disparity 
between NHWs and NHBs occurred. 
In 2013, the SUID rates for NHBs 
and AIANs were double the rates 
for NHWs. The SUID rates for both 
Hispanics and APIs were lower than 
the rates for NHWs throughout the 
study period, with APIs experiencing 
the greatest decrease (APC: −3.3; 
95% confidence interval: −2.8 to

−3.8). This finding resulted in an 
increase in the Hispanic and API 
survival advantage over NHWs.  
In 2013, the NHW SUID rate was 
almost two- and threefold higher 
than for Hispanics and APIs, 
respectively.
age at Death
For all races/ethnicities and both 
periods, most deaths occurred at 1 
to 2 months of age; the proportion 
of SUIDs occurring at 0 to 4 months 
ranged from 76% to 86% (Table 2).  
The proportion of deaths that 
occurred at 0 to 4 months decreased 
over time for NHBs (1995–1997: 
83%; 2011–2013: 81%) and 
Hispanics (1995–1997: 81%;  
2011–2013: 76%); the proportion  
of deaths at 0 to 4 months did  
not decrease significantly for  
NHWs, AIANs, and APIs. The 
proportion of SUIDs occurring at  
5 to 11 months increased 
significantly for all races/ethnicities 
except for APIs.
sex and seasonality
The SUID rate was consistently 
higher for boys among all races/
ethnicities (Table 3). The male 
and female SUID rates decreased 
significantly between the early 
and late periods for all races/
ethnicities, except for AIANs. 
Significant differences in seasonality 
of early- and late-period SUID rates 
by race/ethnicity also occurred. 
The proportion of deaths during 
the winter months decreased for all 
races/ethnicities except for AIANs, 
whereas the proportion during the 
summer months increased for NHWs, 
NHBs, and Hispanics.
Preterm birth
In both the early and late years, 
the lowest SUID rates for preterm 
infants (<37 weeks) were among 
APIs (1995–1997: 92.8 per 100 000; 
2011–2013: 65.2 per 100 000) and 
Hispanics (1995–1997: 130.6 per 
100 000; 2011–2013: 101.7 per 
100 000). AIANs had the highest  
SUID rates among preterm infants 
over the entire study period  
(1995–1997: 434.4 per 100 000; 
2011–2013: 367.4 per 100 000) 
followed by NHBs (1995–1997:  
356.7 per 100 000; 2011–2013:  
291.7 per 100 000). Preterm SUID 
rates dropped significantly between 
1995–1997 and 2011–2013 for all 
races/ethnicities, except for APIs. 
Variation in the total percentage 
change for preterm SUID rates by 
race/ethnicity between periods was 
minimal: −20% for NHWs, −18% 
for NHBs, −22% for Hispanics, and 
−15% for AIANs.
Nonpreterm SUID rates also 
decreased significantly between 
1995–1997 and 2011–2013 for all 
races/ethnicities. There was more 
variation among the percentage 
changes in nonpreterm SUID rates 
between time periods by race/
ethnicity: −8% for NHWs, −14%  
for NHBs, −21% for Hispanics, 
−13% for AIANs, and −50% for 
APIs. For all races/ethnicities  
with significant changes in both 
preterm and nonpreterm SUID rates 
between periods, the declines in 
preterm SUID rates were greater 
than declines in nonpreterm SUID 
rates.
DIscussIOn
This study is the first to examine US 
SUID trend data stratified by race/
ethnicity after the Back-to-Sleep 
campaign, although an analysis of 
racial/ethnic trends in SIDS between 
1989 and 2001 revealed similar 
decreasing but disparate rates.16 
From 1995 to 2013, the relative 
ranking of SUID rates by race/
ethnicity did not change significantly. 
AIANs consistently had the highest 
rates of SUID, followed by NHBs, and 
Hispanics. APIs consistently  
had the lowest SUID rates. Although 
we observed decreases in SUID rates 
for all races/ethnicities, decreases 
were only significant in NHBs, 
Hispanics, and APIs. In addition, the 
magnitude of the decline varied by 
racial/ethnic group. When compared 
with NHWs, the net effect was a 
broadening of the survival advantage 
for both Hispanics and APIs and a 
slight narrowing of the disparity with 
NHBs.
The reasons for the variations in 
race/ethnicity-specific SUID rates 
over the past 2 decades are likely 
multifactorial and driven by changes 
in known SIDS risk factors (eg, 
nonsupine infant sleep position,

infant bedding use, 
18 and bed-
sharing19). Shapiro-Mendoza et al18 
showed a significant decrease in 
the prevalence in soft bedding use 
across all races/ethnicities from 
1993 to 2000. Declines continued 
from 2001 to 2010 for white and 
Hispanic infants but not for black 
infants.18 Longitudinal data have 
also shown increases in bed-sharing 
among NHB and Hispanic infants.19 
From 1993 to 2000, overall supine 
sleep prevalence increased, but 
NHBs consistently had the lowest 
prevalence. Since 2001, supine infant 
sleep positioning has plateaued for 
all races/ethnicities, with persistence 
of the racial/ethnic disparity.17 
Teen maternal age, plurality, low 
socioeconomic or educational status, 
maternal smoking, not breastfeeding 
or decreased breastfeeding duration, 
lack of prenatal care, and unmarried 
status are other factors that may 
influence the observed SUID 
patterns.2, 
 
9, 
20
Biological factors, such as 
genetic polymorphisms, 
21, 
 
22 
metabolic disorders, or brainstem 
abnormalities, 
23 may also act as 
unique biological vulnerabilities 
among the highest-risk groups. 
Per the Triple Risk Hypothesis, 
when these factors combine 
with environmental stressors at 
developmentally vulnerable periods, 
SIDS risk increases. Thus, racial/
ethnic differences in these biological 
factors may explain the observed 
patterns of risk.24, 
25 For example, 
metabolic variation might influence 
endogenous SIDS risk because black 
mothers metabolize nicotine more 
slowly than NHW mothers.26 Slower 
metabolism may lead to higher 
prenatal exposure to nicotine and its 
metabolites, which may adversely 
affect cardiovascular function 
and arousal.27 
– 
31 A review of SIDS 
genetic factors also revealed a higher 
prevalence of polymorphisms in a 
serotonin-transporter gene among 
NHB SIDS cases.32 The serotonergic 
system helps regulate arousal and

autonomic functions, including 
breathing, and these abnormalities 
may be associated with SIDS.33 
– 
36 
In contrast, cultural or behavioral 
factors may also contribute to SIDS 
risk. For example, a 2001 study found 
that infants of US-born Hispanic 
mothers had a 50% greater rate of 
SIDS than infants of foreign-born 
Hispanic mothers after controlling 
for birth weight, maternal age, 
education, marital status, prenatal 
care, and socioeconomic status.37  
The possibility of an interplay 
between behavioral factors and 
biological vulnerabilities related to 
factors such as metabolic or genetic 
abnormalities should be considered 
in further exploration of the 
persistent racial/ethnic disparities in 
SIDS/SUID.
age at Death
Our observed peak SUID incidence at 
ages 1 to 2 months and that ∼90% of 
deaths occurred in the first 4 months 
after birth for all races/ethnicities 
correspond to previous  
findings.6, 
 
15, 
 
38, 
 
39 However, the 
consistent decline between the early 
and late periods in the proportion 
of deaths occurring between 5 and 
11 months of age for all races/
ethnicities, except for APIs, and 
between 0 to 4 months of age for 
NHBs and Hispanics is novel. This 
finding might suggest that changes in 
infant sleep practices after the Back-
to-Sleep campaign40 affected older 
infants more broadly, but had a more 
directed effect in younger, NHB, and 
Hispanic infants.
sex and seasonality
The predominance of SUID in  
males is consistent with other 
studies.10,

deaths from 1995–1997 to 2011–
2013 among all races/ethnicities, 
except for AIANs, and an increasing 
proportion of summer deaths from 
1995–1997 to 2011–2013 among 
NHWs, NHBs, and Hispanics has 
not been previously documented. 
One explanation may be that safe-
sleep recommendations against 
overbundling and overheating 
infants, particularly during winter 
months, have been successful, 
resulting in a more even  
distribution of SUID throughout  
the year.
Preterm birth
Preterm birth increases the risk of 
infant mortality, including SIDS and 
SUID.2, 
 
4, 
 
20, 
 
24, 
38 This risk is particularly 
pronounced in the most premature 
infants. One study showed that being 
born at 22 to 28 or 28 to 32 weeks’ 
gestation doubled the SIDS risk 
compared with infants born at term, 
even after adjustment for maternal 
and pregnancy factors.9 Similarly, 
we found large variations in SUID 
occurrence by gestational age. Across 
all races/ethnicities, the SUID rate 
among infants born before 32 weeks 
gestation was >2.5 times the overall 
SUID rate.
The racial/ethnic differences we 
observed in SUID by gestational 
age mirror overall infant mortality 
and SIDS rates. In previous studies, 
gestational age–specific infant 
mortality rates for NHBs and AIANs 
are typically higher than those 
of NHWs, Hispanics, and APIs at 
all gestational ages. Similarly, the 
highest rates of SIDS are observed 
among AIAN and NHB infants, among 
whom the rates are typically about 
double those of NHWs, 
2 and the SIDS 
rates for Hispanic and API infants are 
significantly lower, as we observed 
for SUID.2
Differential patterns in sleep position, 
infant bedding use, and bed-sharing 
practices are commonly proposed 
explanations for the persistence 
of, and in some cases increases in, 
racial/ethnic disparities in SIDS and 
other sleep-related infant deaths. 
After the Back-to-Sleep campaign 
in the early 1990s, there was a 
substantial decrease in the US SIDS 
rate.44, 
 
46 
– 
48 Although large decreases 
in SIDS for AIANs were observed 
after the Back-to-Sleep campaign, 
substantial disparities compared with 
NHWs remain, even after adjusting 
for socioeconomic status, maternal 
age, birth weight, and prenatal 
care.49 
– 
51 This finding suggests that 
the relationship between SIDS/SUID 
and sleep position among AIANs 
is more complex than previously 
acknowledged.51 Among NHBs, 
although a substantial decrease 
in prone sleep positioning was 
observed in the early 1990s, the 
decline appears to be smaller than 
in other races/ethnicities and is 
largely accounted for by an increase 
in side rather than supine sleep 
positioning.8, 
46 This high prevalence 
of nonsupine sleep position persists, 
with NHB caregivers twice as likely 
to place infants to sleep in the prone 
position compared with whites.52 
Asian and Hispanic infants are placed 
in the supine position in higher 
proportions compared with NHWs 
and blacks.46, 
 
53
Temporal trends in infant bedding 
use and bed-sharing also provide 
insight into the persistence of racial/
ethnic disparities. From 1993 to 
2003, the use of bedding over or 
under sleeping infants declined 
overall, including a statistically 
significant decrease in bedding use 
for all races/ethnicities. The declines 
in bedding use slowed from 2001  
to 2010, with modest declines  
among white and Hispanic infants 
and no significant decline in  
bedding use for NHB infants.18 Why 
Hispanic infants are more likely  
than NHWs to be placed to sleep  
with infant bedding, but have lower 
SUID rates, is unknown. A further 
paradox is the significant increase  
in bed-sharing among Hispanics  
and NHWs and NHBs from 1993 
to 2010, the same time during 
which SUID/SIDS rates decreased 
significantly.19
Our study had a few limitations. 
First, the linked birth-death data, 
like all administrative data sources, 
are limited in scope and lack data on 
environmental risk and protective 
factors for SUID. Second, our 
estimation of gestational age may be 
subject to error due to reliance on  
the mother’s reported LMP rather 
than an obstetric estimate of 
gestation.14 Finally, our examination 
of race/ethnicity was limited by the 
inherent heterogeneity of cultural 
practices and biological factors 
within the available racial/ethnic 
groupings.
Our study also had several  
strengths. First, it examined nearly 
2 decades of national data. The 
use of vital statistics data allowed 
examination of all reported US SUID 
cases. Our focus on racial/ethnic 
trends was especially suited to  
the linked birth-death file in which 
the self-reported race/ethnicity of 
the mother from the birth certificate 
is used in both the numerator  
and denominator of the mortality 
rate. Second, the availability of 
a variety of maternal and infant 
characteristics in the data set  
allowed for more detailed analyses  
of SUID patterns. Third, combining  
3 ICD-10 codes (R95, R99, and  
W75) to represent SUID, rather 
than using a single SIDS code 
alone, lessened the effect of the 
wide variation in reporting across 
jurisdictions.15, 
 
54
conclusions
In sum, we found that significant 
racial/ethnic disparities in SUID 
have persisted into the 21st century. 
In addition, trends in known risk 
factors from this and previous 
studies provide evidence of the 
multifactorial explanations for the 
observed trends. Together, these data 
suggest that, although prevention

efforts dating to the early to mid-
1990s have positively affected SUID 
rates, further effort is needed to 
continue decreasing SUIDs, a major 
cause of infant mortality in the 
United States. To further decrease 
SUID rates, attention is needed to 
address how current prevention 
messaging can be improved to 
reduce the racial/ethnic disparities. 
It is clear that each racial/ethnic 
group has experienced differential 
changes in known risk behaviors. 
What remains to be explored are 
the reasons for the disparities and 
how best to eliminate them. Perhaps 
public health campaigns to reduce 
SUID are not reaching certain races/
ethnicities, not addressing the most 
important risk factors for these 
groups, or not being framed in the 
most effective way to ensure uptake 
among diverse populations. Sufficient 
data exist on the epidemiologic 
profile of SUID in the wake of major 
public health prevention events, 
such as the Back-to-Sleep (Safe-to-
Sleep) campaigns and the American 
Academy of Pediatrics Safe Sleep 
Recommendations.40, 
 
55 We must  
use these detailed data to delve 
deeper into reasons for the 
persistence of SUID and SUID 
disparities.
