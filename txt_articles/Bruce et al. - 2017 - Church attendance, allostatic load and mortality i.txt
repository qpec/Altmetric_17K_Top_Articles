Abstract
Importance
Religiosity has been associated with positive health outcomes. Hypothesized pathways
for this association include religious practices, such as church attendance, that result in
reduced stress.
Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between religiosity (church atten-
dance), allostatic load (AL) (a physiologic measure of stress) and all-cause mortality in mid-
dle-aged adults.
Design, setting and participants
Data for this study are from NHANES III (1988–1994). The analytic sample (n = 5449) was
restricted to adult participants, who were between 40–65 years of age at the time of inter-
view, had values for at least 9 out of 10 clinical/biologic markers used to derive AL, and had
complete information on church attendance.
Main outcomes and measures
The primary outcomes were AL and mortality. AL was derived from values for metabolic,
cardiovascular, and nutritional/inflammatory clinical/biologic markers. Mortality was derived
from a probabilistic algorithm matching the NHANES III Linked Mortality File to the National
Death Index through December 31, 2006, providing up to 18 years follow-up. The primary
predictor variable was baseline report of church attendance over the past 12 months. Cox

 proportional hazard logistic regression models contained key covariates including socioeco-
nomic status, self-rated health, co-morbid medical conditions, social support, healthy eating,
physical activity, and alcohol intake.
Results
Churchgoers (at least once a year) comprised 64.0% of the study cohort (n = 3782). Non-
churchgoers had significantly higher overall mean AL scores and higher prevalence of high-
risk values for 3 of the 10 markers of AL than did churchgoers. In bivariate analyses non-
churchgoers, compared to churchgoers, had higher odds of an AL score 2–3 (OR 1.24; 95%
CI 1.01, 1.50) or �4 (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.11, 1.71) compared to AL score of 0–1. More fre-
quent churchgoers (more than once a week) had a 55% reduction of all-cause mortality risk
compared with non-churchgoers. (HR 0.45, CI 0.24–0.85) in the fully adjusted model that
included AL.
Conclusions and relevance
We found a significant association between church attendance and mortality among middle-
aged adults after full adjustments. AL, a measure of stress, only partially explained differ-
ences in mortality between church and non-church attendees. These findings suggest a
potential independent effect of church attendance on mortality.
Introduction
While interest in the relationship between religion and health is almost as old as humanity, the
science relating these rich concepts has grown considerably in the past two decades as increas-
ing numbers of peer-reviewed articles have been reported with results from studies exploring
links between religion and various dimensions of physical or mental health [1–3]. Interest-
ingly, the results reported in this body of literature have been mixed. A number of studies have
indicated that religion can be beneficial to health [3–8]. However, it is also noteworthy that
other studies have found religion to have no effect or, in some cases, a negative association
with health outcomes [1, 2]. These apparently conflicting findings can be attributed to multiple
sources, including differences in the operationalization and measurement of these multidi-
mensional factors. It has been suggested that the beneficial effects of religiosity on the attitudes,
motivations, goals, social interactions, and perceptions of individuals about wellness can be
assessed by church attendance [9, 10]. Prior analyses of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) III linked mortality dataset [1988–1994] have suggested that
the association between church attendance and longevity among adult participants may be
mediated by other risk factors including health behaviors and inflammation [11].
Thus, the effect of religiosity or church attendance on health may be mediated in part by a
healthy lifestyle, social cohesion or other factors such as mitigating stress. A related potential
mediator in this context is allostatic load (AL), a term that refers to the accumulation of physi-
ological perturbations as a result of repeated or chronic stressors in daily life [12–14]. The mea-
surement of AL may include levels of hormones secreted in response to stress and/or related
clinical/biologic markers that indirectly reflect the effects of such hormones on the body [12].
Higher AL has been associated with premature morbidity and mortality in a range of studies
and populations [15], and growing distress was recently reported to underlie the significant

 rise in the death rate of white middle-aged Americans [16]. Because religiosity may have a pos-
itive impact on stressors, AL levels could vary by level of religiosity.
We posited that religiosity would be associated with lower mortality risk, in part, through
AL. Thus, using longitudinal follow-up NHANES III baseline data, we investigated whether
religiosity in adults as estimated by church attendance was associated with AL and/or mortality
and whether associations with mortality were mediated by AL. We hypothesized that church
attendance would be inversely related to AL levels, after adjusting for socioeconomic measures,
health insurance status and health behaviors. Given the recent findings of distinct changes in
mortality over the last 15 years for middle-aged adults [16], we focused our primary analysis
on persons 40–65 years of age.
Material and methods
Survey design and data collection
Data for our study were drawn from NHANES III (1988–1994), which included approxi-
mately 40,000 persons from 89 random US locations [17]. The NHANES III uses a stratified,
multistage probability design to create a nationally representative sample of the civilian,
non-institutionalized persons [17]. The NHANES III also conducts household interviews
and collects sociodemographic and clinical information including height, weight and blood
pressure, as well as blood samples for specific biochemical analyses [18]. Because NHANES
III data were publicly available and subjects were de-identified, the project was exempt from
IRB review.
Our study population was derived from NHANES III adult participants aged 40–65 years at
the time of interview (n = 6,471). Mean duration of follow up for survival was 14.2 years [11].
Participants who were missing data for two or more components of the AL score (n = 1008),
were excluded. Participants with missing data on church attendance were also excluded
(n = 14). The final study cohort was comprised of 5,449 participants (Fig 1). A sensitivity anal-
ysis was also conducted with all adults aged �40 years (final analytic sample = 8,835; supple-
mental files) and for frequency of church attendance.
Study variables
Allostatic load was calculated as a summative measure derived from values for 10 clinical/bio-
logic markers available in NHANES III that have previously been reported to represent physio-
logical dysregulation [19, 20]. These included: cardiovascular (systolic blood pressure, diastolic
blood pressure, total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, homocysteine); nutri-
tional/inflammatory markers (albumin, C-reactive protein); and metabolic (waist-hip ratio,
glycated hemoglobin) [19, 20]. We then created and compared three categories of AL based on
the number of clinical/biologic markers present (low 0–1, medium 2–3, and high > = 4).
The NHANES III Linked Mortality File was used to estimate race-specific, non-injury-
related death rates for NHANES III participants using a probabilistic matching algorithm,
linked to the National Death Index through December 31, 2006 [21] and provided up to 18
years follow-up (mean [SE] 14 [0.2] years).
The church attendance measure was derived from an interview question asking respon-
dents “How often do you attend church or religious services? (per year)”. Responses ranged
from not at all to 1095 times a year. Select covariates were included in both sets of models.
Behavioral covariates were included physical activity (any vs. none), smoking status (current,
former, never), alcohol use (non-drinker, 1–30 drinks/month, >30 drinks per month), and the
Healthy Eating Index (HEI) which was scored from 0–100 (higher score represents healthier
eating) [19]. Socioeconomic status (SES) covariates included three variables. Education was

 categorized as three- variables denoting whether an individual completed <9, 9–12, and >12
years of education. Health insurance was coded as a dichotomous variable indicating whether
or not a participant was insured. Income was measured by the poverty-income ratio (PIR), an
income-to-needs variable measuring the ratio of household income to the US poverty thresh-
old based on each respondent’s family size and composition at the time of the NHANES III
examination [19]. Self-rated health was assessed with a single item, “How would you rate your
overall health?” with categories ranging from excellent to poor [22, 23]. In this study, self-rated
health was categorized into three groups: “Excellent or Very Good”, “Good”, and “Fair or
Poor” [24]. We also examined social support indicators [25] as potential covariates using the
following questions: a) “In a typical week, how many times do you talk on the telephone with
family, friends, or neighbors?”, b) “How often do you get together with friends or relatives; I
mean things like going out together or visiting in each other’s homes? (per year)”, c) “About
how often do you visit with any of your other neighbors, either in their homes or in your own?
(per year)”, The natural logarithmic transformation of each social support variable was used in
our analyses to compensate for skewness.
Statistical analyses
Study population characteristics were described by church attendance, using means and stan-
dard errors for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. All estimates
were weighted to adjust for the differential probabilities of sampling and non-response, to rep-
resent the total civilian, non-institutionalized US population. Therefore, actual sample sizes
are not reported along with the percentages. Estimates derived from a sample size smaller than
the recommended lower limit in the NHANES analytic guidelines were considered unreliable
[26]. Logistic regression was used to estimate bivariate AL models and four sequential Cox
proportional hazard regressions were constructed to examine the association between the level
of church attendance and all-cause mortality. Model 1 included adjustment for race, age, sex,
and chronic conditions (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, non-skin cancer, thy-
roid disease, rheumatoid arthritis), Model 2 added SES (education, poverty-income ratio, and
health insurance status), Model 3 added health behaviors (smoking status, alcohol use, physical
activity, and HEI) to Model 2, Model 4 added AL score to Model 3, and Model 5 added self-
rated health and social support indicators to Model 4. Results are expressed as hazard ratios
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses were performed using SAS v 9.4
(Research Triangle Park, NC), and all estimates and statistical tests were adjusted for the com-
plex NHANES survey design.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Churchgoers (at least once a year) comprised 64.0% of the study cohort (n = 3,782) and
non-churchgoers (no church at all) comprised 36.0% (n = 1,667). The mean (SE) age of the
overall cohort was 51±0.2 years and did not differ between churchgoers and non-churchgoers
(Tables 1 and 2). Baseline characteristics revealed churchgoers had a better socioeconomic and
health behavior profile. Specifically, they were more likely to have higher levels of educational
attainment, lower levels of poverty, increased physical activity, reduced rates of smoking and
drinking, and a healthier eating index. More than 50% of the churchgoers reported they had
“Excellent/Very Good Health”. Overall, non-churchgoers spent more time seeking social sup-
port from family, friends, relatives, and neighbors than churchgoers. (Table 1).

 Allostatic load
In unadjusted analyses, participants who were non-churchgoers had significantly higher rates
of high-risk values for 3 of the 10 markers of AL (systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol
and total cholesterol/ HDL ratio) and higher mean AL scores (p = 0.008) than did those who
reported at least monthly church attendance. There was no significant difference in AL based
on frequency of church attendance (both at least weekly and at least monthly differed from no
church attendance but not from each other, data not shown). Since we did not find a statisti-
cally significant dose-response relationship with frequency of church attendance, we compared
those who attended some church to non-churchgoers (Table 3). The regression analysis pre-
sented in Table 3 revealed that compared to churchgoers, non-churchgoers had a higher AL,
with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.24 (1.01–1.50) for 2–3 AL compo-
nents vs. 0–1 and 1.38 (1.11–1.71) for �4 components vs. 0–1.
Mortality
The hazard models for all-cause mortality are presented in Table 4. Compared to non-church-
goers, churchgoers who attended church more than weekly had a 49% unadjusted reduced risk

 for all-cause mortality. After adjustment for age, sex, race, and chronic medical conditions
churchgoers had a 46% reduction in all-cause mortality. Sequential adjustments for SES (edu-
cation, health insurance, and PIR; hazard ratio (HR) 0.54), health behaviors (smoking status,
physical activity, alcohol use and healthy eating index; (HR) 0.55) minimally affected the HR.
Adjustment for stress/cardiovascular indicators (AL) attenuated the HR to 0.60 (0.37–0.95).
After controlling for social support indicators and self-rated health to create the fully adjusted
model, the HR for churchgoers who attended church more than weekly was 0.45 (0.24–0.85).
(Fig 2). For the survival models, we tested and found no significant interaction between church
attendance and race or sex, and no effect of AL, stratified by tertiles, on the relationship of
church attendance with mortality (data not shown).
Sensitivity analysis
An NHANES sensitivity analysis using the same strategies for participant ascertainment but
without restriction by older age (all participants �40 years) revealed similar findings to the
main analyses (S1–S4 Tables). Odds ratios (OR; 95% CI) for AL scores of 2–3 and � 4 com-
pared to 0–1, by church attendance were OR 1.14 (0.94–1.38), and OR 1.35 (1.11–1.63) respec-
tively. Similar to the primary analysis, a fully adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression
model demonstrated a 34% decreased risk 0.66 (0.49–0.87) for all-cause mortality for church-
goers who attended church more than weekly compared to non-churchgoers. Again, statisti-
cally significant differences were not noted when we assessed the impact of the frequency of
church attendance.
Discussion
This study examined the association of church attendance with prevalent AL and all-cause
mortality in a large multiethnic sample. We found that the lack of church attendance (a
surrogate for religiosity) was associated with a greater likelihood of having an elevated AL
(a measure of physiologic dysregulation) and all-cause mortality that persisted after further
adjustment of socio-demographic, clinical and laboratory confounders. The higher adjusted
mortality rate for non-churchgoers was slightly attenuated after controlling for AL, but

 remained statistically significant, suggesting the potential influence of religiosity independent
of mediation by AL.
Our findings are consistent with prior studies that linked AL with mortality [19, 27]. They
also build upon, but are distinct from, the work of Gillum et al. who found a lower unadjusted
mortality rate among weekly and more-than-weekly church attendees compared with non-
attendees using NHANES III participants ages 40 and over; but this association was no longer
significant after controlling for common health-related mediating factors [11]. In contrast to
the analysis by Gillum and colleagues, our primary analyses focus on premature mortality
among participants aged 40–65, who represent a particularly vulnerable group, and we exam-
ined AL as a potential mediator of the relationship between church attendance and mortality.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis of mortality in persons � 40 years of age to examine
whether the longer follow up in our analyses–14.2 years in contrast to 8.5 years in the Gillum
paper—resulted in a different association between church attendance and mortality. Our find-
ings are consistent with a possible independent effect of church attendance on mortality that is
consistent with data recently reported by Li et al. [28] in over 74,000 women in the Nurses’
Health Study. They also indicate that church attendance and possibly religiosity may mitigate
the effect of stressors on physiologic dysregulation.
Our findings support the overall hypothesis that increased religiosity (as determined by
church attendance) is associated with less stress (as assessed by AL) and enhanced longevity.
The positive relationship of church attendance with both reduced AL and longevity suggest
religiosity can affect two well-described objective health parameters. The role of church atten-
dance in enhancing longevity may be mediated through several causal pathways linking reli-
gion and physical health such as psychological traits, lifestyle decisions, social conditions and
social networks as described by Koenig [29], Li et al. [28] and Hummer et al. [22]. Thus, we

 also controlled for self reported health which has been reported to be a powerful indicator of
mortality [23] and time spent seeking social support from family, friends, relatives, and neigh-
bors [22] in an effort to address additional key elements not incorporated by allostatic load,
our physiologic measure of chronic stress. Even with the adjustments the association of church
attendance with reduced mortality remained constant.
Health benefits of religiosity may also be attributed, in part, to its impact on two less com-
monly cited domains, compassion [30] and a sense of holiness [31]. Compassion has a long
history of association with religiosity [32] and has been reported to mediate some of the psy-
chosocial health benefits of religiosity and social relationships through its related generosity
and altruism [33], as well as reducing stress and/or enhancing coping skills [34]. Holiness
gives meaning and purpose to life [35] and inspires commitment to something greater than
self [36]. Holiness instills love, joy, peace, hope and fulfillment [37], fosters a sense of inter-
connectedness with others [38], promotes a sense of wholeness in life [39], and engenders a
greater personal relationship with a higher power [40], possibly explaining the health benefits
attributed to religiosity [41, 42].
Although these analyses support the literature linking religiosity and mortality, we found
no evidence that the actual frequency of church attendance offered similar protection as no
differences in AL or mortality were found between those attending church at least weekly and
those attending church at least monthly. Allostatic load has been described as a multifactorial
concept that links an individual with their local environmental stressors and the balance of dif-
ferent components may eventually manifest as a distinct disease(s). Specifically, individual
gene polymorphisms juxtaposed with life experiences, environmental stressors and either
adaptive behavioral responses (e.g. exercise, good nutrition) or maladaptive behavioral
responses (e.g. substance abuse) influence the development and progression of many disease
states [12]. An increased AL and associated organ dysfunction may result from increased fre-
quency or degree of select environmental stressors, ability or inability to adapt to such stressors
over time, and the psychological impact of stress such as anticipation (e.g., worrying about a
possible stressful event in the future that may or may not take place) and/or memories of prior
stressors (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) [12]. Similarly, Cohen and colleagues reported
that environment stress can result in maladaptive coping mechanisms such as negative emo-
tional states, superimposed psychological distress and/or the adoption of unhealthy health
beliefs and behaviors [43]. The confluence of these psychological and behavioral responses
may lead to long-term physiological changes that are characterized by increased AL and ulti-
mately organ dysfunction. Our findings that the compilation of stress responses assessed by
AL is more common among non-church attendees than church attendees are supportive of
these concepts and consistent with Powell et al. who suggested religiosity/spirituality is
strongly linked to improved health outcomes in the general population [44]. Health outcomes
may also differ across different religious groups and practices. For example, Seventh-day
Adventists have been reported to experience lower risks of diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
and arthritis. It has been suggested these patterns are likely due to the Adventists’ predomi-
nantly vegetarian diet; however, other more religious-based mechanisms cannot be excluded
[45].
Our study had several limitations. The clinical/biologic markers assessed, while commonly
studied, are a substantive but not a complete measure of physiological dysregulation, and are
unlikely to fully capture alterations in immune function, inflammatory responses, or neuroen-
docrine function, such as that regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
The NHANES III dataset does not include lab values on markers of the HPA axis such as corti-
sol and epinephrine. It is likely that due to lack of data on duration and/or severity of compo-
nents of the overall AL measure our crude summary score may not be optimal. While we

 adjusted for many biologic and environmental factors, we cannot exclude residual confound-
ing and since this is an observational study, one cannot infer causality. It is also possible that
the health benefits of religiosity have been underestimated because of the crude or imprecise
measurement. Church attendance can represent a public expression of religiosity but does not
account for private practices such as prayer. Lastly, while we have postulated that church atten-
dance in this survey may reflect religiosity, and we attempted to adjust for the potential posi-
tive impact of church attendance on socialization or social biases against those not attending
church [22], we cannot exclude residual confounding from factors such as disease severity/
duration or other aspects of social support not included in our model. Each of these might
affect the observed differences in the associations for both stress and mortality among church
attendees compared to non-church attendees.
In conclusion, we found a significant relationship between church attendance and mortality
in middle-aged (�40–65 yrs) adults NHANES III participants with an extended mean follow
up time of 14 years. This relationship remained significant even after adjustment for educa-
tion, poverty status, health insurance status, self-rated health, social support, and AL, suggest-
ing a potential independent effect of religiosity on mortality. Similar findings were also noted
in a secondary analysis of NHANES III participants � 40 years old. Our results underscore the
potential importance of church attendance as a surrogate for religiosity as a mediator of health
and lifespan. The increased attention to religiosity and other faith-related factors by health
professionals and scientists is warranted by these findings and those from similar studies [46].
Results from this study contribute to the existing body of evidence and support the need for
more rigorous prospective studies to explore causal relationships of religiosity and health.
