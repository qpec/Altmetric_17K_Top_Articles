Introduction: Tat, a key HIV virulence protein, has been targeted for the development
of a therapeutic vaccine aimed at cART intensification. Results from phase II clinical trials
in Italy (ISS T-002) and South Africa (ISS T-003) indicated that Tat vaccination promotes
increases of CD4+ T-cells and return to immune homeostasis while reducing the virus
reservoir in chronically cART-treated patients. Here we present data of 92 vaccinees (59%
of total vaccinees) enrolled in the ISS T-002 8-year extended follow-up study (ISS T-002
EF-UP
, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02118168).
Results:
Anti-Tat antibodies (Abs) induced upon vaccination persisted for the entire
follow-up in 34/92 (37%) vaccinees, particularly when all 3 Ab classes (A/G/M) were
present (66% of vaccinees), as most frequently observed with Tat 30 µg regimens.
CD4+ T cells increased above study-entry levels reaching a stable plateau at year 5
post-vaccination, with the highest increase (165 cells/µL) in the Tat 30 µg, 3× regimen.
CD4+ T-cell increase occurred even in subjects with CD4+ nadir ≤250 cells/uL and in
poor immunological responders and was associated with a concomitant increase of the
CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio, a prognostic marker of morbidity/mortality inversely related to
HIV reservoir size. Proviral DNA load decreased over time, with a half-life of 2 years and
an estimated 90% reduction at year 8 in the Tat 30 µg, 3× group. In multivariate analysis
the kinetic and amplitude of both CD4+ T-cell increase and proviral DNA reduction were
fastest and highest in subjects with all 3 anti-Tat Ab classes and in the 30 µg, 3×
group, irrespective of drug regimens (NNRTI/NRTI vs. PI). HIV proviral DNA changes from
baseline were inversely related to CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio and CD4+ T-cell changes, and
directly related to the changes of CD8+ T cells. Further, HIV DNA decay kinetics were

inversely related to the frequency and levels of intermittent viremia. Finally, Tat vaccination
was similarly effective irrespective of the individual immunological status or HIV reservoir
size at study entry.
Conclusions: Tat immunization induces progressive immune restoration and reduction
of virus reservoirs above levels reached with long-term cART, and may represent an
optimal vaccine candidate for cART intensification toward HIV reservoirs depletion,
functional cure, and eradication strategies.

INTRODUCTION
The HIV-1 Tat protein plays essential roles in the virus
life cycle and in pathogenesis (1–9). Tat is produced very
early upon infection (1–5), is released extracellularly (1, 4,
5) and accumulates in tissues (4) where it exerts effects
on both the virus and the immune system (1–11), making
it an optimal candidate for therapeutic immunization and
combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) intensification (12–15).
In particular, extracellular Tat activates virus and cellular gene
expression and replication, contributing to disease maintenance
under cART (1, 6–9, 16–18). Further, extracellular Tat binds
HIV envelope (Env) spikes forming a virus entry complex that
favors infection of dendritic cells (DC) and transmission to T
cells, key components of the virus reservoir (17). This occurs by
redirecting virus entry from the canonical C-type lectin receptors
to RGD-binding integrins that Tat uses as receptors to enter DC
and other cells of the reticular-endothelial cell system (17). By
this mean, Tat enables HIV to enter DC even in the presence
of antibodies (Abs) blocking the interaction of Env with C-type
lectin receptors, rendering neutralizing Abs ineffective (17). Virus
neutralization, however, can be restored and further increased by
anti-Tat Abs, induced by either natural infection or vaccination
(17). Notably, in natural HIV infection anti-Tat Abs are found
only in a small fraction of individuals (19), while in contrast,
Abs against all other viral products are present at high titers
(20). When present, anti-Tat Abs correlate with the asymptomatic
state and lower disease progression (21–24). This suggested that
targeting Tat represents a pathogenesis-driven intervention to
intensify cART efficacy.
Although cART has radically changed the quality and
expectancy of life of HIV-infected individuals, it is unable
to fully restore the immune system and is ineffective on the
viral reservoirs (25, 26). Moreover, even under fully successful
therapy, viral gene products are still produced (18, 27). As a
result, chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation persist,
leading to a much higher risk of co-morbidities and death as
compared to the general population (28), particularly in patients
starting cART with very low CD4+ T-cell counts (25, 29) or
poorly compliant with therapy. Furthermore, cumulative effects
of drug toxicity cannot be mitigated through structured drug-
free periods, in fact, virus rebound occurs within few weeks
upon therapy interruption owing to persistency of viral reservoirs
during cART (30). There is, therefore, a great need of novel
HIV/AIDS treatments to offset ART shortfalls and to intensify
treatment outcomes. A therapeutic HIV vaccine, in conjunction
with existing strategies, may represent a relevant, cost-effective
contribution to increase ART effectiveness by i) attaining a
faster/more effective response to therapy (ART intensification),
ii) mitigating the effect of poor adherence to ART, and by iii)
reducing virus reservoirs.
After the successful completion of randomized, placebo-
controlled, phase I trials with the biologically active HIV-1 Tat
protein (31, 32), an “exploratory” multicenter, randomized, open
label phase II therapeutic trial was conducted in Italy in 168 anti-
Tat Ab negative, virologically suppressed patients on cART since
a mean of 6 years (ISS T-002, Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00751595)
to evaluate the immunogenicity (primary endpoint) and safety
(secondary endpoint) of two Tat protein doses (7.5 or 30 µg)
administered intradermally 3 times (3×) or 5×, 1 month apart.
All four vaccine regimens were safe and well-tolerated, and
induced anti-Tat Abs in most patients (79%), with the highest
frequency, titers, breath and durability in the Tat 30 µg groups
(89% responders), particularly when given 3× (92% responders)
(15, 33). Most importantly, Tat immunization promoted a
durable and significant increase of T, B, natural killer (NK) cells,
CD4+ and CD8+ central memory subsets and of adaptive T-
cell responses, with a decrease of immune activation and effector
memory T-cell subsets (15, 33). Moreover, a significant increase
of NK cells and CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ T-cells, a phenotype
associated with increased killing activity in elite controllers,
was observed in the Tat 30 µg, 3× group (33). Of note,
more immune-compromised individuals experienced greater
therapeutic effects. Finally, a reduction of proviral DNA was
seen after week 72, particularly under HIV protease inhibitors
(PI)-based regimens and with Tat 30 µg, 3×. This decay was
significantly associated with anti-Tat Ab titers and neutralization
of Tat-mediated entry of oligomeric Env in DC (33), which
predicted at 48 weeks the significant HIV-1 DNA reduction
observed since year 3 post-vaccination. None of these changes
were observed in subjects on effective cART enrolled in a parallel
observational study (ISS OBS T-002) used as reference control
group (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01024556) (15, 33), according
to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of
Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use regulations (34).

ISS T-002 EF-UP
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II
clinical trial conducted in South Africa confirmed the previous
phase II exploratory study conducted in Italy in terms of safety,
and induction of durable, high titers anti-Tat Abs of different
classes capable of cross-clade recognition and neutralization
(35). The study results also confirmed the significant increases
of CD4+ T cells, above cART therapeutic levels, particularly
in subjects with low CD4+ T-cell counts at baseline (poor
immunological responders) (35), while proviral DNA is currently
under analysis in a follow-up study.
The ISS T-002 clinical trial in Italy was completed at 48 weeks;
however, at study closure follow-up data were available up to 96
weeks for 76 volunteers, and up to 144 weeks for 45 volunteers.
To further extend the follow-up, an observational study (ISS
T-002 EF-UP, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02118168) was conducted
to evaluate the persistence of anti-Tat immune response
and to monitor immunological and virological parameters,
including CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV proviral DNA load in
vaccinees. Here we present the results of immunological and
virological disease biomarkers monitored up to 8 years after first
vaccination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Description
The ISS T-002 EF-UP (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01024556) was
an observational study to prospectively follow up the patients
enrolled in the ISS T-002 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT02118168) (15, 33). Ninety-two volunteers (59% of the
total vaccinees evaluated at trial end), previously immunized
intradermally with the biologically active Tat at 7.5 or 30 µg doses
(in the absence of adjuvants) given 3× or 5× 1 month apart, as
by the ISS T-002 study protocol (15), were followed up for a total
of 132 weeks. The ISS T-002 EF-UP study started on September
2013 and was closed on July 2016, when the participants
had a median follow-up of 120 weeks (range 72–132). The
primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the persistence
of the anti-Tat humoral immune response in vaccinees who had
received at least 3 immunizations. Evaluations of immunological
and virological disease biomarkers, including assessment of
the immune recovery and virus reservoirs, were the secondary
endpoints. Clinical and routine laboratory evaluations performed
at each clinical site were also recorded. The immunological and
virological assessments were scheduled about every 3 months,
according to the timing of routine clinical monitoring, or, in
the absence of signs of disease progression, every 6 months.
The study was conducted in 8 Italian clinical sites (Policlinic of
Modena, Modena; Arcispedale S. Anna, Ferrara; San Gallicano
Dermatological Institute IRCCS, Rome; Policlinic of Bari, Bari;
S. Raffaele Hospital, Milan; S. Maria Annunziata Hospital,
Florence; Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan; San Gerardo Hospital,
Monza). All subjects signed an informed consent prior to
enrollment. The study protocol was submitted and approved by
the competent authorities (Director General of the Coordinating
Clinical Center, S. Maria Annunziata Hospital, Florence) and by
the Ethics Committees of each participating clinical center.
Measurement of Serum Anti-Tat Antibodies
An HIV-1 B-clade Tat protein (GenBank accession no.:
AAA44199.1) purchased from Diatheva (Fano, Italy) was used
for anti-Tat Ab determinations. The protein was biologically
active as determined by the rescue assay with HLM-1 cell line
carrying a Tat-defective HIV provirus (1, 4) and/or by Tat uptake
by monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) evaluated by intracellular
staining for Tat in flow cytometry (36), a potency test that is used
to release the Tat vaccine clinical lots.
Serum IgM, IgA, and IgG against B-clade Tat were assessed
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as previously
described (35, 37). Briefly, 96-well microplates (Nunc-Immuno
Plate MaxiSorp Surface; Nunc) were coated with Tat (100
ng/well) in 200 µL of 0.05 mol/L carbonate-buffer (pH 9.6),
and incubated overnight at 4◦C. Wells were washed 5 times
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.05%
Tween-20, by an automatic plate washer (Asys Hitech flexi wash).
Wells were then saturated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma) (blocking buffer)
for 90 min at 37◦C and then washed again as above. One hundred
µL of patient serum samples diluted in blocking buffer at 1:100
for anti-Tat IgG detection or at 1:25 for anti-Tat IgM or IgA
detection, were added to the wells and incubated at 37◦C for
90 min. To correct for binding background, each sample was
assessed in duplicate on Tat-coated wells and singly on the wells
coated with Tat resuspension buffer. After washing, wells were
saturated again with blocking buffer for 15 min at 37◦C, washed
again and then a goat anti-human IgG, IgM, or IgA horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab (100 µL/well) (PIERCE-
Thermo Scientific) was added to each well, and incubated for an
additional 90 min at 37◦C. Antigen-bound Abs were revealed by
the addition of ABTS (2,2
′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-
sulphonic acid) solution (Roche Diagnostics) for 60 min at 37◦C.
Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader
(BIO-TEK Instruments EL800). The assay was considered valid
only when both the positive and negative controls were within
±10% of variation of the absorbance values recorded in previous
50 assays. For the cut-off calculation, both the optical density
(OD) readings at 405 nm of the wells coated with Tat and the delta
(�) value were utilized. The � value was obtained by subtracting
the OD reading of the well coated with the buffer alone from the
arithmetic mean of the OD values of the two wells coated with
the Tat protein. Serum samples were considered positive when
the sample OD at 405 nm and � values were ≥0.350 and ≥0.150,
respectively, as previously described (37). Ab titers ≥25 for IgM
and IgA, or ≥100 for IgG were considered positive.

and

standard national laboratory measurements.
Quantification of HIV-1 DNA by Real-Time
PCR
HIV-1 DNA quantification was performed by SYBR green
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), as described (33,

ISS T-002 EF-UP
38). DNA was obtained from 1.6 mL of peripheral blood.
After incubation for 45 min at 37◦C in a lysis buffer (sodium
dodecyl sulfate 5%, 8 M Urea, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris–
HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0), DNA was purified
by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and
RNase treatment, and amount and quality evaluated with a
NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer by assessing the ratio
of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE, US). Real-time PCR was performed using
the HIV-1 DNA quantitative PCR kit (Diatheva s.r.l., Fano,
Italy), on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, US). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
Forward and reverse primers (5′-TAGCAGTGGCGCCCGA-
3′ and 5′-TCTCTCTCCTTCTAGCCTCCGC-3′, respectively)
were designed to amplify a 161 bp fragment derived from
the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) U5 end to Gag-Pol start
sequence of HIV-1 (GenBank accession no. AF003888). Primer
specificity for HIV-1 group M was confirmed both in silico
using BLAST (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/
COMPENDIUM/2012compendium.html), and by real-time PCR
with different HIV-1 subtypes (B, C, F, CRF 01_AE, and CRF
02_AG), the reference strains A, D, H, and the complete DNA
sequence of HIV-2 ROD (EU Programme EVA Centralized
Facility for AIDS Reagents, NIBSC, UK) (38). Cross-reactivity
with endogenous retroviral sequences was excluded by testing
150 HIV-1 negative blood donors (38). HIV-1 DNA copy
number was estimated as described (38) using a standard
curve comprising a 10-fold serial dilutions (105 to 101) and 2
copies dilutions of a plasmid containing the 161 bp HIV target
region, including the Primer Binding Sites (PBS plasmid). The
standard curve was considered valid when the slope was between
−3.50 and −3.32 (93–100% efficiency) and the minimum value
of the coefficient of correlation (R2) was 0.98. The limit of
quantification was 2 copies per µg of DNA, with a detection
limit of 1 copy and a dynamic range of quantification of 5
orders of magnitude (105 to 101). The reproducibility, assessed
by calculating the mean coefficient of variation (CV%) for the
threshold cycle (Ct) values, was determined as 1.4%, confirming
quantification in the dynamic range. Results were expressed as
log10 copies/106 CD4+ T cells, calculated as the ratio between
copies/µg DNA and the CD4+ T-cell number present in 1.5
× 105 white blood cells (WBC) using the following formula:
[(copies/µg DNA)/(CD4+/WBC) × 150,000 WBC] × 106 (33).
Quantification of HIV-1 RNA
The HIV-1 viral load (VL) in the plasma of HIV-1-infected
patients was quantitatively determined using a standardized RT-
PCR (AmpliPrep/COBAS R
� TaqMan R
� HIV-1 Test, version 2.0;
Roche Diagnostics) that gives a linear response from 20 to
10,000,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. According to manufacturer’s
instructions Ct values above the quantitation limit or absence of
Ct were both categorized as “undetectable VL.”
The lot-specific calibration constants provided with the
COBAS R
� AmpliPrep/COBAS R
� TaqMan R
� HIV-1 Test were
used, with the Amplilink software, to calculate the titer value for
the specimens and controls below the limit of detection (≥95%)
of the assay (i.e., between 1 and 20 copies/mL), based upon the
HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 Quantitation Standard (QS) RNA Ct
values.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive
statistics
summarizing
quantitative
variables
included mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum;
qualitative variables were presented as number and percentage.
Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the cumulative
probability of anti-Tat Ab persistence in responding participants,
by vaccine regimen, and compared by the Log-Rank test. Subjects
who developed anti-Tat Abs within 24 weeks of the ISS T-002
trial were defined “responders.”
Longitudinal analysis for repeated measurements (including
multiple measurements per year) was used to evaluate changes
from baseline of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell number, CD4+/CD8+
T-cell ratio and HIV-1 DNA load at each year of follow up, both
overall and upon stratification.
Multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures was
used in order to evaluate the effect of anti-Tat humoral responses,
vaccine treatment groups, residual viremia/viral blips, CD8+ T-
cell counts, and cART on changes from baseline of CD4+ T-cell
counts and HIV-1 DNA load.
A longitudinal regression analysis was performed using a
random-effects regression model in order to evaluate CD4+ T-
cell number and HIV-1 DNA load over time stratified by vaccine
regimen, CD4+ or HIV-1 DNA quartiles at baseline.
To estimate the decay rate of HIV-1 DNA, a longitudinal
analysis using a random-effects regression model was performed
to determine the slope of the decay from a plot of log10 DNA
(copies/106 CD4+ T cells) vs. time in days; the use of log plot
assumes a first order kinetic decay (26).
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to take into
account the reversion to the mean (RTM) when patients were
categorized for baseline CD4+ T-cell counts or proviral DNA
quartiles (39). For this analysis, the CD4+ T-cell or proviral DNA
measurements done at ISS T-002 baseline and at the last follow-
up visit attended were used. Baseline CD4+ T-cell numbers or
log10 proviral DNA copies per million CD4+ T cells and quartiles
were the model covariates.
A generalized estimating equation with adjustment for
repeated measures in the same volunteers was performed in order
to evaluate relationship between CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio, CD4+
T-cell number, CD8+ T-cell number and HIV-1 DNA load.
The Spearman Correlation Coefficient was used in order to
test the correlation between CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio, CD4+ T
cells, CD8+ T cells, and HIV-1 DNA load.
Statistical analyses were carried out at two-sided with a 0.05
significance level, using SAS R
� (Version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA) and STATAtm version 8.2 (Stata Corporation,
College Station, Texas, United States).
RESULTS
Study Participants
Ninety-three volunteers out of the 155 participants evaluated
for the ISS T-002 trial agreed to enter the extended follow-
up study (Supplementary Figure 1). One patient was excluded

 Sgadari et al.
ISS T-002 EF-UP
from all the analyses because of persistent non-compliance with
cART. Five patients dropped out of the study: 1 after 24 weeks
(discontinued cART), 1 after 36 weeks (relocated), 1 after 48
weeks (not compliant to study visits), 1 after 48 weeks (death
due to lung tumor) and 1 after 84 weeks (lost to follow-up).
Table 1 reports the baseline characteristics of the ISS T-002
EF-UP study participants and the comparison with ISS T-002
baseline. Seventy-seven out of the 92 evaluable volunteers were
male (83.7%). With regard to vaccine regimen, 21 volunteers
had received Tat at 7.5 µg, 3×; 20 Tat at 7.5 µg, 5×; 27 Tat
at 30 µg, 3×; and 24 Tat at 30 µg, 5× (Table 1). Seventy-
eight percent of the patients had a CD4+ T-cell nadir >250
cells/µL. Volunteers entered the study at different time periods
after the first immunization (median time 200 weeks) with a
range comprised between week 144 and 304 (the week at study
entry was taken as week 0 of the extended follow-up protocol).
They were followed-up for a median of 120 weeks (range 24–
132). The median time of follow-up since the first immunization
was 316 weeks (range 185–412). At ISS T-002 EF-UP study entry,
volunteers were in cART for a mean of 10 years.
Anti-Tat Antibodies
Analysis of humoral responses indicated that anti-Tat Abs
persisted for the entire period of follow-up in a high proportion
of participants, particularly in the Tat 30 µg regimens (49% of
the vaccinees) (Figure 1). In fact, as compared to the 7.5 µg
regimens, volunteers vaccinated with the 30 µg Tat regimens
showed persistent anti-Tat IgG and IgA Abs (log-rank Test
p = 0.0179 and 0.0128, respectively, data not shown) and those
who developed anti-Tat Abs of all 3 classes were more likely
to maintain the Ab response to Tat (at least 1 class) [66 vs.
23% (2 classes) and 27% (1 class), Log-Rank Test p = 0.0007]
(Supplementary Figure 2).
CD4+, CD8+ T-Cells, and CD4+/CD8+
T-Cell Ratio
Analysis of immunological parameters of the 92 vaccinees was
performed by years of follow-up, starting from the ISS T-002
study entry, that is, from year 1 to 8.
The statistically significant increase of CD4+ T-cell counts
recorded since year 2 continued over time, reaching levels higher
than 100 cells/µL over baseline values since year 5, gains which
were maintained through year 8 (Figure 2A).
Increases of CD4+ T-cells were similar with non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)/nucleoside reverse transcriptase
(NRTI)- or PI-based treatments (data not shown).
Interestingly, subjects with CD4+ T-cell nadir ≤250 cells/µL
had also statistically significant CD4+ T-cell increases from
baseline, which were equal or even greater than those observed
in vaccinees with a higher nadir (Supplementary Figure 3).
This is of clinical relevance, since subjects with a nadir ≤250
cells/µL are known to respond insufficiently to cART (40, 41) or
vaccination (42).
CD8+ T-cell levels remained stable throughout the 8 years
of follow-up (Figure 2B). The increase of CD4+ T-cell counts
and the maintenance of CD8+ T-cell number after vaccination
resulted in a statistically significant increase of the CD4+/CD8+

T-cell ratio by year 4, which persisted through year 8 of
follow-up (Figure 2C).
When the immunization regimen was considered, the greatest
effects of Tat vaccination were observed with the Tat 30 µg, 3×,
with increases of CD4+ T cells up to 165 cells/µL (Figure 3A),
substantially stable levels of CD8+ T cells (Figure 3B), and
significant increases of the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio over
time (Figure 3C).
In order to better evaluate Tat vaccine dose-effects on the
increase of CD4+ T cells, a longitudinal regression analysis using
a random-effect regression model was used for the four vaccine
regimens. This analysis showed statistically significant increases
of CD4+ T cells for all regimens with the highest increase in
the two Tat 30 µg regimens, while CD4+ T-cell gains in the two
Tat 7.5 µg regimens were more modest (Supplementary Figure 4
and Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
HIV Proviral DNA in Blood
HIV proviral DNA in peripheral CD4+ T cells was evaluated
longitudinally over the whole follow-up period. As shown in
Figure 4A, HIV-1 DNA levels continued to decrease over time
with changes from baseline becoming statistical significant from
year 3, reaching a −82% mean reduction (−0.72 log10 copies/106
CD4+ T cells) at year 8 as compared to study entry. Although
all vaccine regimens had very similar baseline HIV-1 DNA mean
values, the Tat 30 µg, 3× regimen was the most effective at
reducing proviral DNA load, reaching at year 8 a decrease of
−92% (−1.1 log10 copies/106 CD4+ T cells), followed by the Tat
30 µg, 5× that showed a decrease of −79% (−0.7 log10 copies/106
CD4+ T cells), Tat 7.5 µg, 3×, which had very similar kinetics
of proviral decay reaching at year 8 a decrease of −76% (−0.6
log10 copies/106 CD4+ T cells), while Tat 7.5 µg, 5× was the least
effective with a proviral DNA reduction of −70% (−0.5 log10
copies/106 CD4+ T cells, at year 8) (Figure 4B).
Moreover, although in the first 3 years of follow-up a
significant reduction of HIV-1 DNA was seen only in vaccinees
under PI-based regimens (33), since year 4 of follow-up both
NNRTI/NRTI- and PI-based cART regimens were associated
with similar, persistent and statistically significant reductions of
proviral DNA (Supplementary Figure 5).
These results were confirmed in a longitudinal regression
analysis using the random-effects regression model after
stratification of the results according to the vaccine regimen.

(Supplementary Figure 6
and

The random-effects regression model was then used to
estimate the rate of HIV-1 DNA decay. As shown in Figure 5,
a HIV-1 DNA half-life (t1/2) of 3 years and a 90% reduction of
the DNA reservoir in 10 years were estimated for the whole study
population. However, these estimates varied markedly according
to the vaccine regimen. In fact, t1/2 and time to 90% reduction
were shortest for the Tat 30 µg, 3× group (t1/2 = 2 years; 90%
reduction = 8 years), followed by Tat 7.5 µg, 3× (t1/2 = 3 years;
90% reduction = 10 years), Tat 30 µg, 5× (t1/2 = 3 years; 90%
reduction = 10 years), and Tat 7.5 µg, 5× (t1/2 = 4 years; 90%
reduction = 15 years) (Figure 5).

harboring proviral DNA to be about 300/106 (43) in a
background of 1012 total body lymphocytes (44). Accordingly,
the eradication times were estimated to be 83 years for the
whole population, and 66, 77, 83, 122 years for the 30
µg, 3×; 7.5 µg, 3×; 30 µg, 5× and 7.5 µg, 5× group,
respectively (Figure 5).
Transient Detectable Viremia and Blood
Proviral DNA Decay
The transient presence of detectable plasma VL in otherwise
virologically suppressed individuals on ART appears to be
associated with a slower decay of HIV proviral DNA (45–47). We
therefore examined the relationship between the frequency and
the level of intermittent residual viremia/viral blips and proviral
DNA decay. To this purpose, regression analyses were made in
vaccinees grouped by either the frequency of visits with complete
virological suppression (<90 or ≥90% of visits with VL = 0) or
by VL cut-off intervals (0; 1–40; 41–99; ≥100 RNA copies/mL)
(see also Supplementary Table 1). A faster HIV DNA decay
with a shorter proviral DNA half-life, time to 90% reduction and
time to eradication, was observed in vaccinees with VL = 0 in
≥90% of visits as compared to <90% of visits (Figure 6A and
Supplementary Data Sheet 1). When vaccinees were stratified
according to VL cut-off classes, the fastest HIV DNA decay was
observed in patients in the lowest VL class (VL = 0), whereas
the slowest kinetics were observed in vaccinees experiencing
blips above 100 RNA copies/mL; intermediate kinetics of DNA
decay were observed in vaccinees with intermediate viremic
measurements (Figure 6B and Supplementary Data Sheet 1).

CD4+ T-Cells and Proviral DNA After
Stratification by Quartiles of CD4+ or
Proviral DNA at Study Entry
To evaluate whether the individual immunological status or size
of latent HIV reservoir of the volunteers might have affected the
response to Tat vaccination, the kinetics of CD4+ T-cell increases
or proviral DNA decays were evaluated upon stratification by
quartiles according to CD4+ T-cell number or proviral DNA at
ISS T-002 study entry. The data were then analyzed by three
models including (i) changes from baseline upon time by a
longitudinal analysis for repeated measurements, (ii) variations
of absolute CD4+ T-cell numbers or proviral DNA copies upon
time by a random-effects linear regression model, and (iii) single
paired pre-post vaccination measures by ANCOVA, to take into
account the RTM effect.

The analysis of CD4+ T-cell changes from baseline over time
showed that subjects with the lowest CD4+ T-cell counts at
baseline (Q1: CD4+ T cells <493/µL) experienced very early
(year 1) and statistically significant increases of CD4+ T cells,
followed by those in Q2 (CD4+ T cells 493–600/µL) and in
Q3 (CD4+ T cells: 601–734/µL) in whom statistically significant
increases of CD4+ T cells were recorded since year 2 of follow-
up, while the increase observed in Q4 (CD4+ T cells >734/µL)
were not statistically significant (Figure 7).
The analysis of absolute CD4+ T-cell kinetics by longitudinal
regression analysis showed slightly different results, with
significant increases of CD4+ T cells for all quartiles, including
Q4, although the greatest increases were observed in Q1, followed
by Q2 and Q3 as compared to Q4 (Supplementary Figure 7
and Supplementary Data Sheet 1). In particular, Q1 showed
the highest CD4+ T-cell increase, with the 95% CI of the
Q1 regression curve transitioning into the 95% CI of the Q2
curve, suggesting positive effects of Tat vaccination in poor
immunological responders.
When the RTM effect was taken into account by ANCOVA,
the post-vaccination means of CD4+ T cells were not found
to be significantly different among quartiles (data not shown),
indicating that Tat vaccination has similar effects irrespective of
the CD4+ T-cell number at study entry.
Similar but inverse relationships among quartiles were
observed for proviral DNA decay. When proviral DNA

vaccinees with the highest proviral DNA load at study
entry (Q4) experienced the earliest (year 1), progressive and
most pronounced DNA load reduction (from −0.4 to −1.3
HIV-1 DNA log10 copies/106 CD4+ T-cells), followed by
vaccinees in Q3 and Q2, in whom DNA reduction was
less pronounced and became significant only since year 4;
significant proviral DNA load increases were observed in
Q1 from year 1 to 3, while reductions thereafter were not
significant (Figure 8).

(Supplementary Figure 8
and

Finally, when the RTM effect was taken into account
by ANCOVA, the post-vaccination means of proviral DNA
(log10) copies were not found to be significantly different
among quartiles (data not shown), indicating similar effects of
vaccination irrespective of the size of the reservoir at study entry.
Correlation of the CD4+/CD8+ T-Cell Ratio,
CD4+ or CD8+ T-Cell Number With the HIV
Proviral DNA Size
The CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio has been indicated to correlate
inversely with the HIV reservoir size (48, 49). Therefore, analyses
were made to verify the presence of a correlation between
proviral DNA decay and the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio, CD4+
or CD8+ T-cell counts. A significant inverse relationship was
observed between the variations over time of HIV proviral
DNA and the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio (both measured as
changes from baseline; β = −0.3385; p = 0.0246) using a
generalized estimating equation (GEE) with adjustment for
repeated measures (Figure 9).

(Spearmen

Multivariate Analysis of CD4+ T-Cells and
Proviral DNA vs. Humoral Anti-Tat
Responses, Vaccine Treatment Groups,
Transient Viremic Events, CD8+ T-Cells,
and Antiretroviral Therapy
We next investigated the effect of anti-Tat humoral responses,
vaccine treatment regimens, residual viremia/viral blips, cART,
and CD8+ T-cells on the kinetics of CD4+ T-cell counts or
HIV-1 DNA decay by a multivariate regression model, in which
the effect of these variables were evaluated on the changes
from baseline of CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV-1 DNA copy
number (Tables 2, 3). For this analysis, VL was categorized
in two groups according to the frequency of visits with
undetectable viremia (i.e., ≥90 or <90% with VL = 0, see
Figure 6A).
A statistically significant increase of CD4+ T-cell counts was
observed at year 2 and then from year 4 to 6 post-vaccination
in the subgroup of patients who developed anti-Tat Abs for all 3
classes (IgM, IgG, and IgA). A significant increase of the CD4+
T-cell counts was also found by year 4 to 6 post-vaccination
in patients who developed only 2 anti-Tat Ab classes. In the
patients who mounted only 1 Ab class (IgG or IGM or IgA),
the increase of the CD4+ T-cell counts was significant only by

develop anti-Tat Ab after vaccination, the CD4+ T-cell increase
was, nonetheless, statistically significant from year 5 until year
8 (Table 2). As discussed later, these patients developed anti-Tat
cellular responses after vaccination.
When the different vaccine regimens were taken into
consideration, Tat 30 µg, 3× was the most effective, inducing
early (year 1) statistically significant and durable CD4+ T-cell
increases, followed by 30 µg 5×, and 7.5 µg, 5× that were
similarly effective, but with significant increases only since year
4 or 5 (Table 2), whereas the 7.5 µg, 3× vaccine regimen was
the least effective, showing a statistically significant CD4+ T-cell
increase only at year 5.
The evaluation of residual viremia/viral blips indicated that
vaccinees with VL = 0 in more than 90% visits experienced
CD4+ T-cell increases that became significant at years 4, 5, and
6, and were higher as compared to vaccinees with VL = 0
in <90% visits, who had, however, a significant CD4+ T-
cell increase at year 2 and then from year 4 to 8 post-
vaccination (Table 2).
Finally, no statistically significant differences were observed
between PI-based and NNRTI-based regimens on CD4+ T-cell
counts (Table 2).

most pronounced, durable and statistically significant HIV-1
DNA reduction occurred in vaccinees with all or at least 2

HIV DNA decay starting from year 4, whereas in vaccinees with
VL = 0 in <90% visits, DNA decay occurred earlier (year 2)
but was much less prominent (Table 3). Moreover, CD8+ T-cell
changes from baseline were significantly and directly related to
proviral DNA variations (Table 3).
Finally, non-statistically significant differences were observed
between PI-based and NNRTI-based regimens, both showing
a significant and similar HIV proviral DNA reduction in
association with Tat vaccination (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In natural HIV infection, anti-Tat Abs are found only in a
small fraction of individuals (19) but, when present, correlate
with the asymptomatic phase and lower disease progression
(21–24). This has suggested that a Tat vaccine could be used
to induce protective immunity against HIV. In the ISS T-002
trial in Italy, immunization with Tat proved not only to induce
durable anti-Tat humoral responses, but also to increase cell
mediated immunity (CMI) to Tat as well as to other antigens
[e.g., HIV Env, Candida, and a pool of Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-
Barr and influenza virus antigens (CEF)] (15). Tat vaccinees
also experienced significant CD4+ T-cell increases well above
the level achieved with cART, significant increases of B and
NK cells, and equilibration of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell central
and effector memory subsets (15), suggesting a comprehensive
immune restoration. In the ensuing 3 years follow-up study,
vaccinees also showed a decay of blood HIV proviral DNA
reservoir, which was maximal with the 30 µg 3× vaccine regimen
and became significant for both PI- and NNRTI-based cART
combinations at year 2–3 after immunization (33). While a
randomized placebo group was not included in the trial, these
effects were not observed in the matched, non-randomized
reference group receiving only cART, which served as control
according to ICH regulations (15, 33, 34). Of note, both Tat
vaccinees and the control group were on cART for mean of 6
years at study entry, a period of time sufficient for cART to
exert maximal effects on both CD4 T-cell increase or HIV DNA
decay (45–47).
These studies have shown that HIV DNA decay in Tat
vaccinees is predicted by a combination of factors, such
as vaccine-induced anti-Tat Abs, including Abs capable of
neutralizing HIV Env entry in DCs, and CMI against Tat (33).
A subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in
South Africa has confirmed the immunological effects of the Tat
vaccine, while proviral DNA decay analysis waits for additional
testing at later time points (35).
The results of the present 8-year extended follow-up study
confirms the durability of specific humoral responses, which were
still detectable after 8 years in about 50% of the vaccinees in the
Tat 30 µg regimens, and shows a long-lasting (up to 8 years)
stabilization of CD4+ T-cell increases, with a net average gain
of about 100 cells/µL. Of note, CD4+ T-cell count restoration
occurred even in subjects with a CD4+ T-cell nadir ≤250
cells/µL and, as by the quartile regression analysis, even in cART
poor immunological responders (i.e., <500 CD4+ T-cells/µL at
baseline), who are known to experience disease progression and
comorbidities (25, 29, 48, 49).
A striking finding of this study is represented by the continued
HIV DNA decay that, in vaccinees of the 30 µg 3× regimen,
was reduced to 10% of its pre-vaccination size. This, in fact,
conflicts with the known stabilization of HIV DNA after about
4 years of cART into a residual, steady reservoir core (50, 51),
as also observed by us in the reference control group of our
trial (33). Notably, the rate kinetics of HIV DNA decay in Tat
vaccinees appear to be generally much faster as compared to
patients treated for comparable period of times. In fact, in two
recent studies evaluating DNA decay kinetics in patients on long-
term cART, the HIV DNA half-life was quantitated in 7–19 years
(52, 53), as compared to only 3 years for Tat vaccinees (Figure 5).
One of these studies also evaluated the relationship between HIV
DNA decay and intermittent episodes of plasma viremia, as we
have done in our study since VL is a factor known to be associated
with slower rates of decay (45–47). Notably, the kinetics of DNA
decay appear remarkably and consistently faster for Tat vaccinees,
irrespective of intermittent viremia, with half-life values of 1, 3,
or 4 years for Tat vaccinees with VL = 0, VL = 1–40 or VL >40
copies/mL, respectively (Figure 6B), as compared to 7, 12, or 22
years for cART-treated patients in the absence of vaccination (52).
These data suggest that Tat immunization accelerates latent HIV
reservoir decay in cART-treated patients.
Most notably, those vaccinees fully virologically suppressed
at all visits throughout the 8-year follow-up showed a time to
eradication of 31 years (Figure 6B). Although this subgroup
was characterized by a small sample size (n = 4), these data
advocate to explore whether immunization with Tat may lead
to “within-life span” virus eradication in cART fully-suppressed
patients. On the other hand, the data also suggest that poorly
compliant patients may also experience a proviral DNA decay
and containment of CD4+ T-cell count decline and VL increase
after Tat vaccination, as also indicated by our trial in South Africa
in patients not compliant to therapy (35).
The analysis of the factors predictive of CD4+ T-cell gains
and proviral DNA decay suffers in this study from the lack
of continuous measurement of all the parameters previously
shown to participate in vaccine-induced immunity, including,
in particular, anti-Tat Abs neutralizing HIV entry in DCs and
CMI to Tat, which was not possible to monitor throughout the
whole 8 years period. In fact, as evidenced by the multivariate
regression analysis, anti-Tat Abs measured by ELISA were not
fully predictive, as also anti-Tat Ab-negative vaccinees showed
significant CD4+ T-cell increases and proviral DNA decay
rates, although at later periods of time and to a lower extent.
However, 81% of anti-Tat Ab-negative vaccinees developed in
the meantime CMI to Tat (last measurement: week 144, data not
shown). This suggests that CMI may contribute to DNA decay
also in the long-term as previously observed in the short-term (3
years post-vaccination) (33), in substantial agreement with the
protective role of CMI and, in particular, of anti-Tat cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (CTLs) previously evidenced in Tat vaccinated
monkeys (13).
The Tat vaccinees experienced an increase of the CD4+/CD8+
T-cell ratio, an important marker of immune reconstitution

in virologically suppressed cART-treated patients (54), which
was observed in 33/57 (58%) vaccinees with levels below 1 at
study entry. An inverse relationship between the size of virus
reservoir and CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio has been reported for
patients responding to cART (55–58), and this relation is indeed
confirmed by our study. In fact, the increase of the ratio above
cART levels upon Tat vaccination was paralleled by a continued,
long-lasting decay of HIV-1 proviral DNA throughout the 8 years
of follow-up. Notably, proviral decay was more pronounced in
vaccinees experiencing CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio or CD4+ T-
cell increases, while it was less pronounced in vaccinees with
increasing CD8+ T-cell counts. Further, although CD4+ T-cell
increases plateaued after year 5, proviral DNA continued to
decay. In their whole, these data suggest that continued, long-
term control of the virus reservoirs is related to the amelioration
of immune homeostasis induced by the Tat vaccine.
CD4+ T cells transitioning from the effector to the resting
memory state were recently shown to be particularly susceptible
to latent HIV infection (59). It was also reported that stimulation
of HIV-specific CTLs favors killing of latently infected CD4+ T-
cells during HIV reactivation (60). Further, it has been shown that
residual HIV replication in lymphoid tissues with suboptimal
antiviral drug penetration can replenish the reservoirs in cART-
treated patients (61). Conversely, extracellular Tat is known
to favor the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T-cells toward the
effector-memory phenotype (62), and to inhibit the activation of
CD8+ T-cells (63). These data advocate studies to verify whether
anti-Tat Abs may block Tat-induced CD4+ T-cell transitioning
through a functional cell state primed for latent HIV infection
and/or relieving Tat-mediated inhibition of CTL responses.
Overall the findings reported herein indicate that anti-
Tat immune responses can compensate for cART shortfalls
and promote return to immune homeostasis, which likely
contributes to restoration of effective antiviral responses that,
together with anti-Tat immunity, are capable of attacking cART-
resistant virus reservoirs. Thus, Tat immunization represents a
promising pathogenesis-driven intervention to intensify cART
efficacy while renewing perspectives for a functional cure. Future
therapy interruption studies will provide proof-of-concept that
Tat vaccine recipients (particularly those with high titers and
all classes of anti-Tat Ab responses) may be able to stay
off therapy safely for periods of time to be determined in
ad hoc trials.

the indicated doses without any adjuvant 1 month apart. All participants were
analyzed for safety and 155 for immunogenicity (15, 33). Ninety-three subjects of
the immunogenicity population were enrolled in the ISS T-002 EF-UP study. One
subject was excluded from the analyses due to non-compliance to therapy,
therefore 92 subjects were analyzed.
Supplementary Figure 2 | Anti-Tat Ab persistence by the number of anti-Tat Ab
classes over 8 years of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier estimates showing the cumulative
probability of anti-Tat Ab durability in ISS T-002 responders (n = 71) stratified
according to the number of anti-Tat Ab classes induced by vaccination (1, 2, or 3
classes) up to 412 weeks of follow-up (median follow-up: 316 weeks).
Supplementary Figure 3 | Changes over baseline of CD4+ T-cells stratified by
CD4+ T-cell nadir during 8 years of follow-up. Baseline values (left panels) and
annual changes over baseline (right panels) from ISS T-002 study entry of CD4+ T
cells stratified by CD4+ T-cell nadir are shown. Vaccinees with CD4+ T-cell nadir
≤250 cells/µL: n = 20, >250 cells/µL: n = 72. Data are presented as mean
values with standard error. A longitudinal analysis for repeated measurements was
applied. p-values assess the values at year 1–8 after immunization vs. baseline
values.
Supplementary Figure 4 | Longitudinal regression analysis of CD4+ T-cells
stratified by Tat vaccine regimens. Tat vaccine dose-effects on the increase of
CD4+ T cells by days. A longitudinal analysis using a random-effects regression
model was performed.
Supplementary Figure 5 | Changes of blood HIV-1 proviral DNA load over
baseline in vaccinees stratified by cART regimen during follow-up. Baseline values
(left panels) and annual changes (right panels) of HIV DNA levels (expressed as
log10 copies/106 CD4+ T-cells) from ISS T-002 study entry in vaccinees stratified
by cART regimen are shown. The number of participants tested are as follows:
year 1 n = 89, year 2 n = 59, year 3 n = 42, year 4 n = 36, year 5 n = 51, year 6
n = 75, year 7 n = 58, year 8+ n = 37. Data are presented as mean values with
standard error. A longitudinal analysis for repeated measurements was applied.
p-values assess the values at year 1–8 after immunization vs. baseline values.
Supplementary Figure 6 | Longitudinal regression analysis of HIV-1 proviral DNA
decay in vaccinees stratified by vaccine regimens. Tat vaccine dose-effects on the
proviral DNA decay (expressed as log10 copies/106 CD4+ T-cells) by a
longitudinal analysis using a random-effects regression model is shown.
Supplementary Figure 7 | Variations upon time of CD4+ T-cell number stratified
according to baseline CD4+ T-cell quartiles. Linear regression mixed effect model
for variations upon time of CD4+ T-cell number stratified by baseline CD4+ T-cell
quartiles. CD4+ T-cell quartiles at baseline: Q1 <493 (n = 23), Q2 493–600
(n = 24), Q3 601–734 (n = 22) and Q4 >734 (n = 22). Y-axis shows predicted
values.
Supplementary Figure 8 | Variations upon time of HIV-1 proviral DNA stratified
according to baseline HIV-1 proviral DNA quartiles. Linear regression mixed effect
model for variations upon time of HIV-1 proviral DNA (log10 copies/106 CD4+
T-cells) stratified by baseline HIV-1 proviral DNA quartiles. HIV-1 proviral DNA
quartiles at baseline: Q1 <2.86 (n = 22), Q2 2.86–3.10 (n = 24), Q3 3.11–3.47
(n = 23) and Q4 >3.47 (n = 22). Y-axis shows predicted values.
Supplementary Figure 9 | Relationship of CD4+ T-cells (A), CD8+ T-cells (B)
and HIV-1 proviral DNA in vaccinees during follow-up. Relationships between
changes of HIV proviral DNA levels from baseline (log10 copies/106 CD4+ T-cells)
and the changes of CD4+ T-cells (A) or CD8+ T-cells (B) from baseline are
shown. A generalized estimating equation with adjustment for repeated measures
was utilized.
