Background: We evaluated the associations of anthropometric indicators of general obesity (body mass index, BMI), an
established risk factor of various cancer, and body fat distribution (waist circumference, WC; hip circumference, HC; and waist-to-
hip ratio, WHR), which may better reflect metabolic complications of obesity, with total obesity-related and site-specific (colorectal
and postmenopausal breast) cancer incidence.
Methods: This is a meta-analysis of seven prospective cohort studies participating in the CHANCES consortium including 18 668
men and 24 751 women with a mean age of 62 and 63 years, respectively. Harmonised individual participant data from all seven
cohorts were analysed separately and alternatively for each anthropometric indicator using multivariable Cox proportional hazards
models.
Results: After a median follow-up period of 12 years, 1656 first-incident obesity-related cancers (defined as postmenopausal
female breast, colorectum, lower oesophagus, cardia stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, endometrium, ovary, and kidney) had
occurred in men and women. In the meta-analysis of all studies, associations between indicators of adiposity, per s.d. increment,
and risk for all obesity-related cancers combined yielded the following summary hazard ratios: 1.11 (95% CI 1.02–1.21) for BMI, 1.13
(95% CI 1.04–1.23) for WC, 1.09 (95% CI 0.98–1.21) for HC, and 1.15 (95% CI 1.00–1.32) for WHR. Increases in risk for colorectal
cancer were 16%, 21%, 15%, and 20%, respectively per s.d. of BMI, WC, HC, and WHR. Effect modification by hormone therapy
(HT) use was observed for postmenopausal breast cancer (Pinteractiono0.001), where never HT users showed an B20% increased
risk per s.d. of BMI, WC, and HC compared to ever users.
Conclusions: BMI, WC, HC, and WHR show comparable positive associations with obesity-related cancers combined and with
colorectal cancer in older adults. For postmenopausal breast cancer we report evidence for effect modification by HT use.

 The
proportion
of
overweight
(body
mass
index,
BMI425 kg m � 2) or obese (BMI430 kg m � 2) adults worldwide
increased substantially between 1980 and 2013 (NCD Risk Factor
Collaboration, 2016), with parallel increases in children and
adolescents (Ng et al, 2014). Obesity prevalence reaches its peak
between the age of 55 and 60 years in men with B25% being obese
in high-income countries and about 5 years later in women with
B30% being obese (Ng et al, 2014). This may have substantial
implications for risk of subsequent cancer development, particu-
larly in older adults (60 þ years) considering that they are the
fastest growing demographic group in most high-income countries.
It is well established that a high BMI is associated with an
increased risk of a large number of non-communicable diseases,
including cancer. Excess body fatness, as defined by high BMI, has
been convincingly linked to an increased risk of eleven different
cancer types, including cancer of the oesophagus (adenocarci-
noma), gastric cardia, colorectum (CRC, colorectal cancer),
gallbladder,
pancreas,
liver,
breast
(postmenopausal),
ovary,
endometrium,
kidney
and prostate
(advanced
stage;
World
Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research,
2007; Renehan et al, 2008; Bhaskaran et al, 2014). An updated
IARC consensus review also judged the strength of evidence
sufficient for thyroid, meningioma, and multiple myeloma (Lauby-
Secretan et al, 2016). These cancers alone comprise about 50% of
the total global burden of cancer (based on GLOBOCAN 2012
data; Arnold et al, 2016b).
However, there are uncertainties with regard to how well BMI
captures the complex biology underlying associations between
adiposity and cancer risk (Renehan et al, 2015). This is relevant to
the development of cancer prevention strategies because it is
increasingly recognised that a proportion of overweight or obese
individuals – as defined by a high BMI – might not be at an
increased risk for metabolic complications of obesity and its
consequences such as cancer (Renehan et al, 2015). Waist
circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) are therefore
often used in epidemiological and clinical settings as a means of
quantifying body fat distribution indicating central adiposity
(National Heart, Lung and BI, 1998; Hu, 2008), and they are
thought to be superior predictors of risk of cancer development, at
least for the colon and postmenopausal breast (Moore et al, 2004;
Pischon et al, 2006; White et al, 2015). Moreover, a greater hip
circumference (HC), after controlling for WC and/or BMI, may be
associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, type 2
diabetes, and mortality (Heitmann and Lissner, 2011; Cameron et al,
2013), but its relation to cancer risk has been fully explored in only a
few recent studies (Keimling et al, 2013; Steffen et al, 2015), where
either no association was found for risk of colon cancer with and
without adjustment for BMI (Keimling et al, 2013) or inverse
associations with risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma after adjust-
ment for WC (Steffen et al, 2015). Strictly speaking, HC is not a
measure of central adiposity, but of fat accumulated in the lower part
of the body (such as the hips and thighs; Hu, 2008). Together, the
evidence that measures of body fat distribution or central adiposity
are better predictors of cancer risk than BMI is inconsistent. Also,
only a few prospective studies comparing different measures of
adiposity were carried out in adults aged 60 years and above.
Our primary objective was to derive standardised risk estimates
for anthropometric measures of general adiposity (BMI) and body
fat distribution (WC, HC, and WHR) and their association with
‘obesity-related’ cancers combined (i.e., cancer sites with convin-
cing evidence of a positive association with greater body fatness) as
well as CRC and (postmenopausal) breast cancer in a large
population of older adults from Europe. Secondary objectives were
to examine the shape of the dose–response relationships and to
evaluate potential effect modification by sex, smoking status, use of
hormone therapy (HT), and interaction between measures of body
fat distribution and general adiposity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. The Consortium on Health and Ageing:
Network of Cohorts in Europe and the United States (CHANCES)
project is a multi-country study, which aims to harmonise the data
from ongoing prospective cohort studies in Europe and North
America (Boffetta et al, 2014).
The following CHANCES cohorts provided the data for the
current
analysis:
the
study
centres
in
Denmark,
Greece,
The Netherlands, and Spain of EPIC Elderly, which is a subset of
the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC) project that consists of participants aged 60 years or older
at
recruitment;
the
Epidemiological
Study on
Chances for
Prevention, Early Detection, and Optimized THERapy of Chronic
Diseases at Old Age (ESTHER), a population-based cohort
covering the entire federal state of Saarland in Germany, aged 50
or older at recruitment; the PRIME Belfast study, which is a cohort
of male residents aged 50–60 years of Belfast and the surrounding
area in the United Kingdom; and the Tromsø study, which
recruited men and women in Norway between 1994 and 1995 (4th
wave) aged 50–84 years. Other CHANCES cohorts either decided
not to participate in this analysis or could not provide cancer
incidence data. The participating cohorts’ key characteristics are
summarised in Table 1. Additional information on the individual
cohorts has been given previously (Boffetta et al, 2014). We
followed similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, which are
displayed in Figure 1, as in a companion paper on overweight
duration and risk of cancer (Arnold et al, 2016a). Further to the
exclusions shown in Figure 1, we excluded participants with an
implausible BMI below 15 or above 45 kg m � 2 from the analysis.
All CHANCES cohort studies are conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. For each study, investigators satisfied
the local requirements for ethical research, including obtaining
informed consent from participants.
Outcomes. Incident cancer cases were identified through linkage
to cancer registries (EPIC Netherlands, EPIC Denmark, Tromsø)
or through self-reports that were confirmed by medical records
and/or pathology reports (ESTHER, PRIME Belfast) or both (EPIC
Spain, EPIC Greece). All analyses were conducted for cancer sites
with convincing evidence of a positive association with greater
body fatness (World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for
Cancer Research, 2007; Renehan et al, 2008; Lauby-Secretan et al,
2016). We examined first invasive breast cancer (ICD-O-3 C50) at
postmenopausal ages, CRC (C18–21), and the combination of the
two in conjunction with ‘other obesity-related cancers’ that
included cancer of the lower oesophagus (C15.5, as a proxy for
oesophageal adenocarcinoma in the absence of histological data),
gastric cardia (C16.0), liver (C22), gallbladder (C23), pancreas
(C25), endometrium (C54), ovary (C56) and kidney (C64),
together labelled as ‘obesity-related cancers’. Advanced prostate
cancer was not included because we lacked information on tumour
stage. Also, thyroid, meningioma, and multiple myeloma (Lauby-
Secretan et al, 2016) were not included due to very small numbers
of incident cases and inconsistencies in the available data across
cohorts. Small numbers precluded the possibility of performing
separate analyses of each obesity-related cancer site.
Anthropometric assessment. In all cohorts except ESTHER,
height and weight were measured by trained personnel at baseline.
In the ESTHER cohort, height and weight were self-reported by the
study participants.
Waist and hip circumference were measured by trained
personnel in all cohorts except ESTHER, where these measures
were not assessed; the narrowest torso circumference (natural
waist) or midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest was used
for the waist measurement, while the widest circumference or

 maximum circumference over the buttocks was used for the
hip
measurement.
The
majority
of
cohorts
reported
that
participants were asked to remove any heavy outer garments (light
clothing or underwear only allowed) for the anthropometric
measurements.
Covariate assessment. Age, sex, smoking status, physical activity,
alcohol consumption, and HT use in women were collected in all
cohorts
following
standardised
procedures
and
a
posteriori
harmonised within the CHANCES project (Boffetta et al, 2014).
All covariates except alcohol consumption (continuous, g per day)
were modelled categorically: (daily) smoking status (never daily
smoker; former daily smoker; current daily smoker; unknown),
(vigorous) physical activity (yes; no; unknown) defined according
to the CHANCES harmonisation rules as ‘performing intense
exercise at least once a week’, level of education attained (primary
or less; more than primary but less than college or university;
college or university; unknown), current use (or history) of HT in
women (ever; never; unknown).
Statistical analysis. Cox proportional hazard models with age as
the time metric were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for the relation between four obesity
indicators and the risk of developing (1) ‘obesity-related cancers’,
(2) CRC, (3) postmenopausal breast cancer, and (4) ‘other obesity-
related cancers’ in each of the included cohorts. All obesity
indicators were treated as continuous covariates; BMI was
examined as a measure of overall adiposity, whereas WC, HC,
and WHR were examined as measures of body fat distribution. For
comparability between the four obesity indicators, we calculated
the HR and their CI per 1-s.d. increment of each indicator
(Keimling et al, 2013). The relationships between anthropometric
measures were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients
(Supplementary Table S1).
Subjects were censored at age of study exit (death, lost to follow-
up, any cancer diagnosis other than cancers considered as
outcomes in this study, and end of follow-up), whichever occurred
first.
For all outcomes, three models with different sets of adjustments
were fitted. Model 1 included each of the anthropometric measures
alternatively, stratified by age (1-year categories) and sex, and
adjusted for height. Model 2 (main model) extended Model 1 by
further adjusting for smoking status, alcohol consumption, level of
educational attainment, physical activity, and recruitment year.
Missing values in any of the categorical covariates were included as

 a separate category. Model 3 was based as model 2, but with
mutual adjustment for all anthropometric measures using residuals
of WC, HC, and WHR (Roswall et al, 2014).
All Cox models were fitted for each study separately (EPIC
Elderly was sub-divided into study centres/countries) giving a
study-level risk per 1-s.d. increment and the results of models 2
and 3 were then combined using DerSimonian and Laird random-
effect meta-analysis (Harris et al, 2008). The heterogeneity of
associations across studies was expressed by I2 (Higgins and
Thompson, 2002).
The proportional hazard assumptions in the study-specific
analysis were assessed by visual inspection of log–log plots and by
statistical tests using Schoenfeld residuals. Because the proportional
hazards were unlikely for sex and age, we stratified Cox models by
sex and age (in 1-year categories). Exclusion of individuals with
missing data on smoking, education or physical activity gave
virtually the same results.
To directly compare cancer risk discrimination between the four
obesity indicators, we used respective predictions from Cox models
(model 2, pooling all cohorts) to assess discrimination by Harrell’s
C-index (Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration, 2009).
For analyses addressing the impact of effect modification, we
pooled all cohorts into one dataset, and additionally stratified all
Cox models by study. To investigate potential non-linear dose–
response associations between the four obesity indicators and
cancer risks, we used three-knot restricted cubic spline models at
Harrell’s default percentiles (i.e., 10th, 50th, and 90th) in
combination with a Wald-type test to evaluate the linearity
hypothesis (Orsini and Greenland, 2011).
We tested a priori for potential interactions between the four
adiposity indicators and for effect modification of the studied
associations by smoking status and HT use, and between measures
of body fat distribution and general adiposity, using likelihood
ratio tests. Since Cox models were stratified by sex and age, no
formal tests for interaction by sex or age were performed.
All statistical tests were two-sided and P-values were considered
statistically significant at the 0.05 level. All statistical analyses were
performed using Stata 12.1 (College Station, TX, USA).
RESULTS
In total, 43 419 participants were included in this study, with 1656
obesity-related cancer cases occurring during a median follow-up
time of 12 years, which ranged between 10.4 years in Germany
(ESTHER) and 18.0 years in Northern Ireland (PRIME Belfast)
(Table 1). Study participants were recruited between 1991 and
2003, with a mean age at study entry ranging from 54 years in
Northern Ireland to 67 years in Greece (EPIC Greece). The
prevalence of obesity (BMI430 kg m � 2) at recruitment was lowest
in Northern Ireland with 11% and highest in participants from
Spain with 42%.
Meta-analysis of adiposity measures and risk of cancer. In the
meta-analysis of all studies, BMI, WC, and WHR were significantly
associated with an increased risk of ‘obesity-related cancers’; the
HRs per 1-s.d. increment in BMI, WC, and WHR were 1.11 (95%
CI: 1.02–1.21), 1.13 (95% CI: 1.04–1.23), and 1.15 (95% CI:

(Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.02)
to

(Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.58). Omitting EPIC Spain from the meta-analysis
also reduced heterogeneity for BMI (to 25%, Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.25)
and for HC (61 to 7%, Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.369). HC was positively
associated with risk of ‘obesity-related cancers’ with a comparable
effect size (HR1-s.d. increase ¼ 1.09, 95% CI: 0.98–1.21) but did not
reach formal statistical significance (Figure 2). Mutual adjustment
for adiposity measures attenuated risk estimates for all measures of
body fat distribution, i.e. WC, WHR, and HC. In contrast, the HR
for BMI increased to 1.15 per 1-s.d. increment and remained
statistically
significant
(95%
CI:
1.09–1.22;
Model
3–
Supplementary Figure S1).
For CRC, findings were more consistent across the four
adiposity measures with little evidence for heterogeneity across
studies (all I2o36%, all Pheterogeneity40.17), although the risk
estimates for EPIC Spain followed a similar pattern as for ‘obesity-
related cancers’ (Figure 3) including reduced heterogeneity after
omitting EPIC Spain (data not shown). Effect sizes for CRC were
in general higher with strongest associations observed for WC
(HR1-s.d. increase ¼ 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08–1.35) and the weakest for HC
(HR1-s.d. increase ¼ 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01–1.32). After mutual adjust-
ment for adiposity measures, only BMI remained a significant risk
factor
of
CRC
(HR1-s.d.
increase ¼ 1.19,
95%
CI:
1.08–1.31;

For
postmenopausal
breast
cancer,
a
significant
positive
association was observed with BMI but only after additional
adjustment for HC and WC (model 3) with a HR per 1-s.d.
increase in BMI of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.03–1.27; Supplementary Figure
S1). Associations with other measures of adiposity were non-
significant although effect sizes were comparable, except for WHR
(Figure 4). In addition, heterogeneity across studies was high for

and did not change after excluding EPIC Spain.
WHR was strongest and most consistently associated with ‘other
obesity-related cancers’ (i.e. lower oesophagus, gastric cardia, liver,
gallbladder, pancreas, endometrium, ovary, and kidney) with a HR
per 1-s.d. increase of 1.20 (95% CI: 1.04–1.38; Figure 5). All other
obesity measures were non-significant. After mutual adjustment
for adiposity measures, WC was also independently associated with
‘other obesity-related cancers’ (HR1-s.d.
increase ¼ 1.15, 95% CI:
1.03–1.28; Supplementary Figure S1), while the association with
WHR was marginally attenuated.

sistent across the four obesity measures and linearity largely
statistically insignificant (Supplementary Figure S3). These findings
were confirmed when analysing BMI and WC in pre-defined
categories (Supplementary Table S6).
Direct comparisons between anthropometric indicators. C-
indices for WC, HC, and WHR were marginally and non-
significantly lower than for BMI in predicting risk of ‘obesity-
related cancers’, CRC, postmenopausal breast cancer (range of
C-index differences to BMI: � 0.01 to � 0.02) and vice versa for
‘other obesity-related cancers’(range of C-index differences to BMI:
0.02 to 0.03; Table 2). Compared to a null model including all
confounding variables but none of the four anthropometric
indicators, adding BMI, WC, HC, and WHR separately or jointly
resulted in virtually similar model fit as evaluated by AIC (Table 2).

 men and women (Supplementary Table S3). However, HC yielded
higher risk estimates in women for ‘obesity-related cancers’ and
CRC. On the other hand, WHR yielded higher risk estimates in
men compared to women for ‘obesity-related cancers’, CRC, and
‘other obesity-related cancers’. Some of these sex-specific differ-
ences became more pronounced or only apparent after mutual
adjustment for adiposity measures (Model 3; Supplementary
Table S3).
Some variability in risk estimates was observed across smoking
categories (Supplementary Table S4). However, formal tests for
effect modification were only significant for associations between
HC and CRC (Pinteraction ¼ 0.02) with a significantly increased risk
observed in never smokers (HR1-s.d.
increase ¼ 1.33, 95% CI:
1.16–1.54).
For postmenopausal breast cancer, significantly increased risks
were observed in women who never used HT, with similar effect
sizes of B20% increased risk per 1-s.d. increase of BMI, WC, and
HC (Pinteractiono0.001) (Model 2, Supplementary Table S5).
No significant interactions between measures of body fat
distribution (i.e., WC, HC, and WHR) and World Health
Organizations’ BMI categories (normal weight: BMIo25 kg m � 2,
overweight: BMIX25 to o30 kg m � 2, obesity: BMI X30 kg m � 2)
in relation to ‘obesity-related cancers’ and CRC or postmenopausal
breast cancer were observed (data not shown). A borderline
significant interaction for associations between WC and CRC
across categories of BMI was observed (Pinteraction ¼ 0.07) showing
a significantly increased risk of CRC (HR1-s.d. increase ¼ 1.52, 95%
CI: 1.20–1.92) in the overweight category.
DISCUSSION
In this pooled analysis of seven prospective cohort studies, we
observed increased risks of ‘obesity-related cancers’, overall and of
CRC and postmenopausal breast cancer associated with equivalent
increments of general adiposity (BMI) and measures of body fat
distribution (WC, HC, and WHR). Relative risk estimates were
comparable across the different adiposity indices. For postmeno-
pausal breast cancer, there was indication that increased risks were
confined to women who never used HT. When mutually adjusting
for all four anthropometric measures, which may be linked to
different underlying biological mechanisms, BMI appeared to be an
independent risk factor of ‘obesity-related cancers’, CRC, and
postmenopausal breast cancer. In contrast, WC and WHR
appeared to be independent risk factors of ‘other obesity-related
cancers’, which we could not analyse separately due to low number
of cases. To our knowledge, this is the first study of older adults to

 comprehensively compare anthropometric measures of general
adiposity and body fat distribution, to examine and quantify the
respective independent effects of these measures and to examine
the shape of the dose–response relationship for cancers known to
be obesity-related.
Our analysis does not corroborate the hypothesis that central
adiposity is a superior predictor of CRC or postmenopausal breast
cancer among older adults, as proposed by some previous studies
(Pischon et al, 2006; Stolzenberg-Solomon et al, 2013; White et al,
2015). In contrast, and in line with our results, is an analysis of the
NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, where BMI, WC, and WHR
were found to be equally discriminatory for colon cancer risk
(Keimling et al, 2013). HC was not associated with risk of colon
cancer in Keimling et al, while in our analysis HC virtually
mirrored results for BMI, albeit effect sizes were slightly lower as
compared to BMI. HC in disease models that do not account for
BMI and/or WC is probably more indicative of general adiposity
rather than an indicator of fat accumulation in the lower
extremities reflected by a high correlation between HC and BMI
(Pearson correlation B0.8 in our data). Mutual adjustment of
obesity indicators may reduce heterogeneity across studies as
observed in our data. This could indicate that BMI does not
capture general adiposity equally well in all White Caucasians and
that holding WC and HC constant, improves the interpretation of
BMI as a measure of general adiposity.
Furthermore, in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition
Cohort, positive associations between WC and BMI and post-
menopausal breast cancer risk were reported, but only the
association with BMI remained significant after mutual adjustment
(Gaudet et al, 2014).
For postmenopausal breast cancer, early results from the Iowa
Women Health Study suggested a statistically significant multi-
plicative interaction between BMI and WHR (Folsom et al, 2000).
However, in subsequent reports that specifically tested interactions
between BMI and indicators of central adiposity in relation to risk
of CRC (Keimling et al, 2013) and breast cancer (Gaudet et al,
2015), no statistically significant associations were found. Our
findings are in line with these more recent reports in that we did
not find statistically significant multiplicative interactions between
BMI and any of the three measures of body fat distribution.

 For most of the cancer sites that we grouped into ‘other obesity-
related cancers’ due to the small number of cases, previous studies
reported somewhat stronger associations with regard to measures
of central adiposity as compared to BMI, which is in line with our
findings. For example, in the meta-analysis of Aune et al on
pancreatic cancer, WHR yielded an overall RR of 1.19 (95% CI:
1.09–1.31), while that for BMI was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.07–1.14; Aune
et al, 2012). Slightly stronger associations for WC and WHR, as
compared to BMI, were also reported in the most recent WCRF/
AICR pooled analyses for advanced prostate cancer (World Cancer
Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research, 2014). We
were not able to include prostate cancer in our analysis because of
lack of data by stage.
In an analysis using data from the large EPIC prospective
cohort, we reported previously that abdominal obesity, rather than
general obesity, is a risk factor for the development of oesophageal
adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia cancer (Steffen et al, 2015). In
the prospective NIH-AARP cohort both overall adiposity (BMI)
and abdominal adiposity (WC, WHR) were associated with a
higher risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, but only BMI was
associated with a higher risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma
(O’Doherty et al, 2012). In an updated WCRF/AICR meta-analysis,
BMI was more strongly associated with an increased risk of
endometrial cancer compared to WC or WHR, although WC was
also associated with an increased risk (Aune et al, 2015b).
Similarly, an increased risk of ovarian cancer was reported with
greater BMI and a marginally significant positive association with
WC, but no association was found for HC or WHR (Aune et al,
2015a). We are not aware of studies investigating the role of body
fat distribution and risk of cancers of the liver and gallbladder. The
evidence with regard to BMI was judged convincing for both of
these cancer sites by the most recent WCRF/AICR pooled analyses
(World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer
Research., 2015a, b). For these last two cancer sites, further
assessment of the impact of body fat distribution in future studies
is warranted.
Although WC and WHR (and HC as noted above) have been
interpreted as measures of body fat distribution, they may well also
be markers of general adiposity (Anderson et al, 2015). In the
current study, we saw that these measures have associations with
cancer that are similar to those for BMI, but mostly when used in
separate models. However, few studies have conducted mutual
adjustments between BMI and measures of body fat distribution to
try to clarify their independent roles. This is a limitation, which
needs further assessment in future studies because it may provide
insight into the biologic mechanisms underlying observed associa-
tions between adiposity and cancer risk (Keimling et al, 2013).
Ideally, for mutual adjustment of BMI and measures of body fat
distribution, residuals of measures of WC and/or HC should be
used in order to retain the interpretability of BMI as an indicator of
general adiposity and to avoid potential problems of multi-
collinearity. Otherwise, BMI is not easily interpretable or becomes
an indicator of muscularity rather than adiposity (Hu, 2008). It is
also of note that WC, HC, and WHR have larger measurement
errors compared with measurement of BMI, which may affect the
reliability of respective risk estimates and calls for additional
caution when comparing results between these indicators.
Links between greater adiposity and increased risk of many
cancers are biologically plausible considering that obesity is related
to a vast array of metabolic and physiological dysfunctions (Park
et al, 2014). A number of these altered processes have specifically
been implicated in cancer development; notably (1) abnormalities
of insulin resistance and the IGF-I system; described as the insulin-
IGF-I-insulin pathway, which may promote tumour development
at many anatomic sites (Park et al, 2014; Renehan et al, 2015);
(2) the impact of adiposity on the biosynthesis and bioavailability
of endogenous sex steroids (e.g., oestradiol) which applies
predominantly, but not exclusively, to postmenopausal breast,
endometrial and ovarian cancers (Park et al, 2014; Renehan et al,
2015); our findings that obesity-associated risk of postmenopausal
breast cancer was strongest in women, who never used HT support
that hypothesis; (3) obesity induced low-grade chronic systemic
inflammation; and (4) alterations in the levels of adipocyte-derived
factors, known as adipokines (Lee et al, 2015). All of these
proposed pathways have been extensively investigated in mechan-
istic studies and tested in epidemiological settings. For example,
adiponectin, one of the most abundant adipokines, has been shown
to be a key mediator in the development of several types of obesity-
related cancers including endometrial, breast, advanced prostate,
CRC, renal, and pancreatic (Dalamaga et al, 2012). Unlike most of
the other adipose tissue derived adipokines, serum adiponectin is
reduced in obesity and correlates inversely with BMI, WC, HC, and

 WHR, independently of age and menopausal status (Dalamaga
et al, 2012). Migrating adipose progenitor cells, which can be found
in high concentration in white adipose tissue and may acquire a
tumour-promoting function, and the gut microbiome are two
emerging mechanistic hypotheses linking obesity with cancer risk
(Renehan et al, 2015).
Our study has some limitations that may affect the interpreta-
tion of the results. Despite the pooling of seven cohorts, we were
not able to compare adiposity measures across all anatomical
cancer sites with strong evidence of an association with obesity
because of low numbers of cases. These cancer sites were therefore
combined in ‘other obesity-related cancers’. For this reason, we
could not investigate whether one or several of these cancers may
have driven the observed associations with WC and WHR. Also
related to the low number of cases, we were not able to sub-divide
CRC in its anatomical sub-sites – knowing that effects sizes are
more pronounced for cancers of the colon as compared to the
rectum (World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for
Cancer Research, 2011) – or to sub-divide breast cancer by
receptor status. However, associations with BMI appear to be
unrelated to receptor status in postmenopausal women who have
never used HT (Renehan et al, 2015).
Further limitations of our study are related to differences in
study design between cohorts, including differences in length of
follow-up and assessment of several covariates. In order to
harmonise the data and variable definitions across cohorts, some
covariates such as physical activity were only available in binary
form (yes/no). Despite adjustment for the main confounding
factors, namely smoking and physical activity, we cannot rule out
confounding by other unmeasured factors, most importantly
reproductive factors and diet. As these were not consistently
available from all cohorts, we were not able to take these into
account in our analyses. However, we do not expect risk estimates
being noticeably confounded by diet as has been shown previously
(Renehan et al, 2012). In the ESTHER study, BMI based on self-
reported height and weight was the only adiposity indicator
available. Although self-reported BMI may grossly underestimate
prevalence of adiposity at the population level, ranking of
individuals according to their BMI is less affected (Hu, 2008).
Furthermore, study-specific risk estimates for ESTHER were
consistent with the other cohorts and the summary estimates;
excluding ESTHER from the meta-analysis had virtually no effect
on the summary estimates (data not shown). Keeping ESTHER in
our analysis also facilitates comparison of results with our
companion paper, where we investigated the impact of overweight
duration on obesity-related cancers (Arnold et al, 2016a). Finally,
we did not a priori stratify our analysis by sex, mainly due to
sample size considerations. However, in secondary analysis, largely
similarly increased risks among men and women were observed for
the investigated adiposity indicators (Supplementary Table S3).
Strengths of our study include the availability of harmonised
individual-level data for the estimation of cohort-specific risk
estimates. This allowed us to use the same exposure definitions,
disease end points, and multivariate models in all included studies.
Our investigation included only prospective cohort studies, which
reduces the potential of biases that are often reason for concern in
retrospective studies, for example, recall and selection bias.
Individuals within each of our cohorts were largely White
Caucasian, which adds further validity to our results because the
effects of a given WC in a White population may be very different
to the same WC in an Asian or African-American population.
However, these potential ethic differences need to be evaluated in
future studies. Further, we explored and compared, to our
knowledge, for the first time in a pooled analysis of cohorts
consisting of middle-aged and older adults, non-linear associations
between BMI, WC, HC, and WHR for cancer sites known to be
adiposity-related.
CONCLUSIONS
General adiposity as measured by BMI and body fat distribution as
measured by WC, HC, or WHR show comparable positive
associations with obesity-related cancers combined, with CRC,
and with postmenopausal breast cancer. For postmenopausal
breast cancer there was evidence for effect modification by HT use,
which needs further exploration in other cohorts and populations.
Avoiding abdominal fatness may also be important for specific
cancer sites, but requires further investigation. Overall, our results
underscore the importance of avoiding excess body fatness for
cancer prevention irrespective of age and gender.
