Poliovirus (PV) is the causative agent of poliomyelitis, a crippling human disease known
since antiquity. PV occurs in two distinct antigenic forms, D and C, of which only the D form
elicits a robust neutralizing response. Developing a synthetically produced stabilized virus-
like particle (sVLP)-based vaccine with D antigenicity, without the drawbacks of current
vaccines, will be a major step towards the final eradication of poliovirus. Such a sVLP would
retain the native antigenic conformation and the repetitive structure of the original virus
particle, but lack infectious genomic material. In this study, we report the production of
synthetically stabilized PV VLPs in plants. Mice carrying the gene for the human PV receptor
are protected from wild-type PV when immunized with the plant-made PV sVLPs. Structural
analysis of the stabilized mutant at 3.6 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy and single-
particle reconstruction reveals a structure almost indistinguishable from wild-type PV3.

 P
oliovirus (PV), a member of the Picornaviridae, is the
causative
agent
of
poliomyelitis
and
destroys
motor
neurons in the central nervous system causing paralysis or
even death1. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative by the
World Health Organization (WHO) has resulted in 99% fewer
cases since 1988 by using two very effective vaccines: the live,
attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV), developed by Sabin, or the
formaldehyde-inactivated vaccine (IPV), developed by Salk2, 3.
OPV has been preferred, being relatively inexpensive, easy to
administer
and
additionally
inducing
gastrointestinal
mucosal immunity which prevents virus transmission. However,
the genetic instability of OPV means it can regain neurovirulence
by reversion mutations which can cause vaccine-associated
paralytic poliomyelitis in the vaccine recipient or their contacts,
albeit at very low frequency. These attenuated strains may also
undergo genetic recombination during replication with other
polio or non-polio human enteroviruses, and evolve into
circulating
vaccine-derived
PVs
(VDPVs)4
that
display
neurovirulent phenotypes similar to wild-type (wt) PVs. OPV
also lacks thermostability and requires maintenance of a cold
chain. IPV induces effective humoral immunity which protects
against disease in the vaccinee but does not always prevent
replication of the wt virus encountered subsequently, thus
allowing continued transmission within a population5. PV strains
can
be
reintroduced
into
countries
that
have
previously
eliminated wild virus circulation via travelers and VDPVs
may continue to evolve from the cryptic replication of attenuated
OPV
strains.
Importantly,
production
of
both
vaccines
requires
propagation
of
large
amounts
of
infectious
PV,
increasing the risk of an accidental reintroduction. The WHO is
therefore seeking novel polio vaccines and our overall objective is
to develop recombinantly expressed, stabilized PV virus-like
particles (sVLPs) as a cheap and viable source of vaccine to
replace current IPVs. Such virus-free vaccines will become
increasingly relevant as wt polio is eradicated.
PV occurs in three serotypes (PV1, PV2, and PV3). Its single-
stranded (+) sense RNA genome (~7500 nucleotides) contains
a single large open-reading frame encoding a 220 kDa polyprotein
which is subsequently processed by a series of proteolytic
cleavages to generate the viral proteins6–8. One of the processing
intermediates, P1, is a ~100 kDa protein which is subsequently
processed by the viral proteinase 3CD to produce three
capsid proteins, VP0–VP3, with the final cleavage of VP0 to give
VP2 and VP4 apparently facilitated by the encapsidation of
the RNA genome9. Mature PV comprises 60 copies each of
VP1–410, 11 arranged to form an icosahedral capsid 27–30 nm in
diameter12 with distinct antigenic structure, referred to as D
(or N (native)) antigen13, which can conformationally shift to a
non-infectious form, called C (or H (heated)) antigen14. The
C antigen does not elicit a protective immune response and
thus is ineffective as a vaccine15, 16.
A
VLP
mimics
the
morphology
of
a
virus
particle
(ideally retaining the native antigenic conformation) but lacks
genomic
material
and
thus
can
elicit
a
strong
immune
response17–19
but
cannot
replicate,
mutate
or
recombine.
Genome-free (empty) PV particles, such as recombinantly
expressed VLPs, do not undergo the final maturation cleavage of
VP0 into VP2 and VP4, which rearranges the proteins on the
inside of the virus capsid with a concomitant increase in particle
stability9. Consequently, empty capsids can be easily converted
from the D to the C form during extraction and purification20.
Therefore, to produce an effective vaccine from empty particles, it
will be necessary to stabilize the particles to maintain the desired
antigenic phenotype. D form enterovirus particles often harbor a
long chain fatty acid or “pocket factor” within the core of VP121,
22. By contrast, in the C form this molecule is expelled and there
is evidence that tight binding of these host-derived molecules can
stabilize the D form and prevent uncoating23. Similar small
molecule entities have been shown to be useful in stabilizing
vaccine antigen24 and the pocket factor analog GPP3 has been
shown to bind PV25.
In the last 20 years plants have become serious competitors
to
bacteria,
insect
cells,
yeast
or
mammalian
cells
as
production systems for pharmaceutical materials. They are
robust,
inexpensive
to
grow,
bring
a
low
risk
of
contamination with endotoxins or mammalian pathogens26–28,
and transient expression can be adjusted rapidly with low
manufacturing costs27. It has been shown that a wide variety of
VLP-based vaccine candidates can be efficiently produced
in plants, including Medicago Inc.’s influenza vaccine, currently
undergoing clinical trials, bluetongue virus, and papilloma-
viruses29–31.

 In this paper, we demonstrate expression of PV VLPs of wt
PV3 and the stabilized PV3 mutant SktSC832. We show that this
mutant retains the stability and potency of the current vaccine
IPV and protects mice against challenge with wt PV. Structure
determination of the PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs using cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) shows that it adopts a native, D, antigenic
conformation akin to wt PVs despite showing little evidence for
bound endogenous pocket factor. These particles do however
bind GPP3 as expected. Furthermore, analysis of the structure
reveals the mechanism of action of the stabilizing mutations.
Results
Expression of PV proteins in plants. To determine if PV VLPs
can be transiently expressed in plants, codon-optimized versions
of the P1 regions of either wt PV3 or the mutant PV3 SktSC8,
identified as having stabilizing mutations within the coat
proteins32, were inserted into plasmid pEAQ-HT to give plasmids
pEAQ-HT-PV3 and pEAQ-HT-PV3 SktSC8-P1, respectively.
Agrobacterium
tumefaciens
suspensions
harboring
these
constructs were co-infiltrated with construct pEAQ-HT-3CD
to provide proteinase 3CD necessary for processing. While high-
level expression of P1 was tolerated, expression of 3CD caused
severe necrosis in the infiltrated tissue (Fig. 1a). To address this,
3CD expression was downregulated to about 10% of the initial
level
by
reversing
the
HyperTrans
(HT)-mutation
in
the
vector thereby introducing an extra in-frame AUG codon
upstream of the main initiation site31. This dramatically reduced
the level of necrosis while still permitting efficient processing of
P1 (Fig. 1b).
Purification and detection of wt PV3 and PV3 SktSC8 VLPs.
Leaves were co-infiltrated with pEAQ-HT-PV3 and pEAQ-3CD
or with pEAQ-HT-PV3 SktSC8-P1 and pEAQ-3CD and har-
vested 6 dpi. The clarified extracts were centrifuged through
sucrose cushions (Fig. 1c) and then through a 20–60% (w/v)
Nycodenz density gradient for further purification. Three gray
bands were visible in the density gradient (Fig. 1d). Each was
retrieved separately and analyzed on a western blot that
revealed that the top band contained the most VP1 (Fig. 1e).
Sodium
dodecyl
sulfate
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) followed by staining with Instant Blue showed
bands consistent with the presence of VP0, VP1, and VP3 in the
preparations, and no evidence for VP2 or VP4.
To confirm particle formation, negatively stained samples
were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Figure 2a shows the presence of large amounts of plant-produced
wt PV3 VLPs, although many are irregular in shape or broken.
Regular shaped wt VLPs, as seen in the inset in Fig. 2a, were rare.
By contrast, PV3 SktSC8 proteins assembled into particles of
regular shape and size of 27–30 nm diameter, a morphology
similar to that of native PV (Fig. 2b). The difference in
morphology between the wt and mutant PV3 sVLPs suggests
that the mutations stabilize the particles. The yields in the
purified samples were ~0.06 mg/g fresh weight tissue of PV3
SktSC8 sVLPs and 0.04 mg/g fresh weight of wt PV3 VLPs.
Structure analysis of PV3 SktSC8 VLPs. To confirm the
authenticity of the plant-expressed PV VLPs, we have determined
structures of the stabilized plant-expressed PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs by
cryo-EM in the absence and presence of the GPP3 pocket-binding
compound. In total, 4046 particles of PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs and
2060 particles of PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs + GPP3 yielded structures at
3.6 Å and 4.1 Å resolution (Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of
0.143), respectively (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). The
models were refined33 and structure validation was performed by
monitoring
real-space
correlation
and
Ramachandran
plot
metrics (Supplementary Table 1). The polypeptide main chain
and side chains were well resolved for most of the capsid (Fig. 3d,
e), allowing an atomic model for the majority of the three capsid
proteins (VP0, VP1, and VP3) to be manually built into the cryo-
EM maps. The two particles are almost indistinguishable (rmsd in
Cα atoms 0.72 Å) with both showing D antigen structure—the
final refined atomic models are very similar to the X-ray crystal
structure of the closely related Sabin strain of PV3 (PDB 1PVC),
with only 0.77 Å rmsd in Cα atoms between complete protomers
of the Sabin PV3 (1PVC) and PV3 SktSC8 sVLP. The overall
architecture of the plant-expressed PV3 SktSC8 sVLP preserves
all the structural features characteristic of native conformation
particles
including
the
canyon
depression
around
the
fivefold vertex of the capsid (Fig. 3b). The only significant
changes are on the interior of the particle, where the N-terminal
region of the uncleaved VP0 in the empty sVLPs is less well
ordered than the corresponding regions of VP4 and VP2 in the
mature virus (residues corresponding to VP2 1–11 and VP4 1–25
and 41–69 are not visible in the sVLPs). In addition, the N-
terminus of VP1 from residues 1 to 65 is disordered in the
sVLP structures; such disordering is commonly seen in empty
particles although these are usually in the expanded C antigenic
form. Although the pocket is “open” as expected for a structure
with D antigenicity, very little density is observed for a pocket
factor molecule in the VP1 protein for the PV3 SktSC8 sVLP
structure at 3.6 Å resolution (Fig. 3d), although one or more
pocket
factors
may
be
present
at
very
low
occupancy.

 that although the VP1 pocket is in the same conformation as seen
for apo PV3 SktSC8 GPP3 has clearly bound within it (Fig. 3e).
The binding mode of GPP3 to VP1 is very similar to structures of
pocket factor analogs bound to other D form PV capsids, and to
GPP3 bound to enterovirus 71 and Coxsackievirus A1625, 34,
confirming
that
the
plant-expressed
PV3
SktSC8
sVLP
assembles in an authentic D form competent to bind pocket
factor molecules. It is possible that there is a lower concentration
of factors suitable to substitute for the usual pocket factor(s)
in the cytoplasm of plant cells than mammalian cells, explaining
the
slightly
lower
stability
observed
for
plant-produced
sVLPs compared to VLPs produced from viral infection of
mammalian cells.
Seven out of the eight mutations present in PV3 SktSC8
are visualized in the cryo-EM density maps (the eighth occurring in
a region of disordered structure), with clear density consistent
with each mutated residue (Fig. 4a). The mutations are distributed
evenly across the protomer (Fig. 4b), and are involved in either
stabilizing the hydrophobic core of individual protomer subunits
(VP1 T105N and VP3 L85F), increasing the hydrophobic packing
between protomers within the pentamer of the VLP (VP2 L215M
and VP3 H19Y), or, in one case (VP1 F132L), modulating the
lining of the VP1 pocket where the pocket factor binds. This pocket
factor mutation actually increases the volume of the pocket
and there is no evidence that it would stabilize the pocket-factor
bound D state; it is therefore possible that it acts instead by
destabilizing the C state. For VP2 L18I the change is very small,
and it is unclear what effect the change might have, if any, though it
is
known
to
have
significant
biological
consequences21.
VP2 D241E is chemically conserved and it is not clear how
the increased length of the side-chain might confer increased
stability. The final change in VP4 occurs in a region disordered in
the particle.
Antigenic analysis and particle stability. VLPs produced
from the wt PV3 construct were entirely of non-immunogenic
C antigenic form whereas SktSC8 VLPs, produced in plants or
mammalian cells, were predominantly in the native, D antigenic
conformation (Fig. 5a). Some C antigen is present in SktSC8 VLP
preparations, as it is in all virus preparations and IPV, probably
reflecting <100% efficiency in the assembly process. Thus, the
stabilizing mutations in PV3 SktSC8 are effective when sVLPs are
produced in plants by expression of the capsid precursor and
the viral protease as well as in the context of a viral infection of
mammalian cells.
Purified wt PV3 (rWT3) VLPs rapidly convert to non-native
C antigenic conformation at temperatures above 33 °C32. In
thermostability
assays
plant-produced
PV3
SktSC8
VLPs
(rSktSC8) were much more stable, losing 50% D antigenicity at
around 50 °C, similar to type 3 IPV (Fig. 5b). PV3 SktSC8 VLPs
(vSktSC8)
produced
by
electroporation
of
L
cells
with
T7 transcripts were somewhat more stable, possibly reflecting
effects of virus gene expression as well as the different cellular
environment during particle assembly.

from both plants and mammalian cells, given as either one or
two doses, induced similar levels of neutralizing antibodies and
protection against challenge with live virus as did IPV.
Discussion
The results of this work show the ability of plants to produce a
vaccine candidate against polio. We demonstrate recombinant
expression of PV3 sVLPs with a yield of up to 60 mg/kg infiltrated
plant tissue. High-level expression of 3CD caused severe damage
to the infiltrated leaf tissue, an effect which could be alleviated by
reducing expression level. The reduced expression level is still
sufficient to permit efficient PV P1 processing resulting in a
maximum yield of viral proteins on day 6–7 after infiltration
(probed by VP1 expression levels). The processed P1 is able to
assemble into VLPs within plants and these can be purified by
standard means. When comparing wt PV3 VLPs to PV3
SktSC8 sVLPs by electron microscopy, the structural instability of
the wt version becomes apparent; uneven and broken wt particles
can be seen, whereas the sVLPs retained typical PV particle
morphology. Overall, these findings demonstrate that plants are
an effective system for the production of PV VLPs, including
stabilized vaccine candidates.
The structure of the PV3 SktSC8 sVLP was solved to 3.6 Å
resolution by cryo-EM and showed that the particle is very
similar to that of wt PV3 Sabin strain, demonstrating that
recombinant plant-expression of PV VLPs can produce authentic
particles
with
the
correct
antigenic
features.
The
PV3
SktSC8 sVLP structure does not show strong density for a pocket
factor in the VP1 pocket. However, it is likely that some
VP1 pockets are occupied since the pocket has not collapsed
(structure
is
native
antigenicity)
and
some
weak
density
is observed. It is likely that the VP1 pocket is partly occupied
with a heterogeneous mixture of pocket factors, acquired from
the plant cell expression system. Indeed, when the PV3
SktSC8 sVLP was mixed with a well-characterized pocket binding
compound
(GPP3),
a
well-occupied
complex
was
seen.
The structure of PV3 SktSC8 sVLP + GPP3 showed clear,
unambiguous density for the pocket-binding molecule in the VP1
pocket. The structure of PV3 SktSC8 sVLP + GPP3 is unchanged
in other aspects compared to PV3 SktSC8 sVLP without GPP3,
and
both
structures
had
native
antigenic
conformation.
The ability to form a complex with GPP3 with high-occupancy
confirms the finding of Rombaut et al.24 that binding small-
molecule pocket-factor mimics provides an additional method
for
further
stabilization
of
synthetic
polio
vaccines.
This
detailed structural analysis provides compelling evidence that
authentic, immunologically relevant VLPs can be produced
in plants.
The lability of the wt PV3 VLPs was confirmed when analyzing
their antigenicity. VLPs produced from the wt PV3 construct
were entirely C antigenic whereas PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs were
predominantly
in
the
native,
immunogenic
D
antigenic
conformation. Immunizing transgenic mice with the plant-
expressed PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs induced similar neutralizing anti-
body responses as IPV and protected animals from challenge
with virulent virus, at levels similar to those induced by IPV.
These results underline the potential of this plant-produced
stabilized mutant as an alternative vaccine against polio.
In conclusion, this study provides proof that the stabilizing
mutations in PV3 SktSC8 were effective when the sVLPs
were
produced
in
plants
by
expression
of
the
modified
capsid precursor and the viral protease. This mutant is stable
in the D form and protects mice when challenged with virulent
virus. Cryo-EM analysis revealed that the atomic structure of
PV3 SktSC8 sVLP closely resembles the native wt PV. In
this study work was focused on PV3; however, stabilized
mutants of PV1 and PV2 have also been generated and suc-
cessfully produced in plants. We report the production of

 immunologically effective but non-infectious PV VLPs in plants
with the potential to become an alternative vaccine against polio.
We also anticipate that the approaches described here could be
applied to the production of VLP-based vaccine candidates for
other picornaviruses and, indeed, to other families of viruses.
Methods
Mutants. The capsid sequence of the PV3 SktSC8 mutant has been described32.
Briefly, a full-length PV construct expressing wt 3 Saukett capsid proteins was
modified to include eight capsid stabilizing (SC) mutations. Virus preparations
were made by high-efficiency electroporation of full-length RNA transcripts into
mouse L cells, concentration through 30% (w/v) sucrose cushions and fractionation
on sucrose-gradients32.
Plasmid constructs. The PV gene sequences for the 3CD protease, the wt PV3 and
the mutant PV3 SktSC832 were codon-optimized for Nicotiana benthamiana and
ordered for synthesis from GeneArt (Life Technologies) with flanking AgeI and
XhoI sites. These genes were cloned into separate pEAQ-HT35 expression vectors
producing pEAQ-HT-PV3-P1, pEAQ-HT-PV3 SktSC8-P1, and pEAQ-HT-3CD.
The HT mutation of the vector carrying 3CD was subsequently removed to
produce the pEAQ-3CD vector. A. tumefaciens LBA4404 were transformed with
the constructs by electroporation and propagated at 28 °C in Luria-Bertani media
containing 50 µg ml −1 kanamycin and 50 µg ml −1 rifampicin.
Transient expression. A. tumefaciens containing the respective constructs were
grown to stable phase in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with the appropriate
antibiotics. The cultures were then pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 × g and
re-suspended in MMA buffer (10 mM MES, pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 µM
acetosyringone) to an OD600 of 0.8 (for pEAQ-HT-PV3-SC8Skt-P1) and 0.4
(for pEAQ-3CD). The bacteria were mixed in 1:1 ratio and left at room
temperature for 0.5–3 h prior to infiltration. The suspensions were pressure
infiltrated into 3-week-old N. benthamiana leaves36. The infiltrated leaves were
harvested 6 days later.
Extraction and purification. Infiltrated leaf tissue was weighed and homogenized
using a Waring (Torrington, CT) blender with 3× volume of extraction buffer
(0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) plus added protease inhibitor (Roche, Welwyn
Garden City, UK) and then filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem). The crude
extract was centrifuged at 9500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C following filtration over

 a 0.45 µm syringe filter (Sartorius). The clarified extract was then spun
through a sucrose cushion (1 ml 70% (w/v) and 5 ml 25% (w/v)) at 167,000 × g for
3 h at 4 °C and the lower fraction retrieved. Sucrose was removed by dialysis
using PD10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare) and the volume of the sample
reduced using Amicon Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore). The sample was
further purified by centrifugation through a Nycodenz (Axis-Shield) gradient
(20–60% (w/v)) in a TH641 ultracentrifuge swing-out rotor (Sorvall) at 247,103 × g
for 24 h and 4 °C. VLPs were collected by piercing the side of the tube with a
needle and PD10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare) were used to remove
the Nycodenz and the samples concentrated using Amicon Centrifugal Filter
Units (Millipore).
SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. Protein extracts were analyzed by
electrophoresis on 4–12% (w/v) NuPAGE Bis–Tris gels (Life Technologies).
Western blot analyses were performed using a monoclonal primary
antibody against VP1 protein (Millipore MAB8566) followed by detection with a
goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and
developed using the chemiluminescent substrate Immobilon Western (Millipore).
An uncropped image of the blot is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Transmission electron microscopy. VLPs were adsorbed onto plastic and
carbon-coated copper grids, washed with several drops of water and then stained
with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 15–30 s. Grids were imaged using a FEI Tecnai G2
20 Twin TEM with bottom-mounted digital camera.
Cryo-EM data collection. Aliquots of 4 μl of purified PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs were
added onto glow-discharged holey carbon copper grids (C-flat, CF-2/1-2 C;
Protochips). Grids were blotted for 4 s, in 90% relative humidity, and vitrified in
liquid ethane with a plunger device (Vitrobot; FEI). To increase the number of
particles in the holes, grids were pre-incubated with 4 μl of sample for 30 s, and
unbound sample was removed by blotting with filter paper. For PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs
+ GPP3, purified PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs were mixed with GPP3 at a ratio of 1 VLP:300
GPP3 molecules and was incubated at 4 °C for 16–18 h overnight. Cryo-EM grids
of the PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs + GPP3 complexes were prepared as above.
For PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs cryo-EM data were collected at 300 kV with a Titan
Krios microscope (FEI) and a direct electron detector (Falcon II, FEI) at the
electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC) at Diamond Light Source. Micrograph images
were collected as movies (33 frames, each 0.2 s) and recorded at −2.8 to −1.0 μm
underfocus with EPU at a calibrated magnification of ×133,333, thus resulting in a
pixel size of 1.05 Å per pixel.
For PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs + GPP3 images were collected at 300 kV using a Tecnai
G2 “Polara” microscope (FEI) equipped with an energy filter (GIF Quantum,
Gatan) operating in zero-loss mode (0–20 eV energy selecting slit width) and a
direct electron detector (K2 Summit, Gatan). Movies (25 frames, each 0.2 s) were
collected at a defocus range of −2.8 to −0.8 µm in single-electron counting mode
with SerialEM37 at a calibrated magnification of ×37,037, resulting in a pixel size of
1.35 Å per pixel.
Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary
Table 1.
Image processing and three-dimensional reconstruction. Similar image
processing procedures were employed for the PV3 SktSC8 sVLPs and PV3
SktSC8 sVLPs + GPP3 data sets. Individual frames from each micrograph movie
were aligned and averaged using MotionCorr to produce drift-corrected images38.
VLPs were selected automatically using ETHAN39 and manually screened using
EMAN40. Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated using
CTFFIND341 as part of RELION 1.342. Micrographs showing astigmatism or
significant drift were discarded and not used for further analysis. All subsequent
steps in three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction used RELION 1.3 in accordance
with recommended gold-standard refinement procedures42, and with the
application of icosahedral symmetry. For PV3 SktSC8 sVLP, a total of 37,378
particles from 2768 micrographs were subjected to reference-free two-dimensional
(2D) class averaging to discard bad particles. The particle population was further
improved by 3D classification, using the X-ray structure of PV1 (PDB 1POV),
low-pass filtered to 40 Å as an initial model. In total, 4046 particles were
selected for 3D auto-refinement. For the PV3 SktSC8 sVLP + GPP3 data set
2060 particles from 1018 micrographs were selected after 2D and 3D classification
and 3D auto-refinement used a low-pass (40 Å) filtered model taken from the
previously reconstructed PV3 SktSC8 sVLP data set. For both reconstructions
the final resolution was assessed using the “gold” standard FSC (FSC = 0.143)
criterion43.
Atomic model building and refinement. The X-ray crystal structure of the Sabin
PV3 (PDB 1PVC) was manually placed into the cryo-EM density map for the PV3
SktSC8 sVLP data set and rigid-body fitted with UCSF Chimera44. The fitting was
further improved with real-space refinement using Coot45. Manual model building
was performed using Coot45 and in combination with iterative positional and
B-factor refinement in real space with Phenix33. Only atomic coordinates were
refined; the maps were kept constant. Each round of model optimization was
guided by cross-correlation between the map and the model. For the PV3
SktSC8 sVLP + GPP3 data set the refined atomic structure of PV3 SktSC8 sVLP
was used as a starting model and rigid-body fitted and refined as above. The GPP3
molecule was built into the cryo-EM density within the VP1 pocket using tools
within Coot46. For both structures, validation was performed with the tools in
Coot45 and the MolProbity47 functions integrated within Phenix. Refinement
statistics are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Molecular graphics were generated
using Coot45, Pymol48 and UCSF Chimera49.
D and C antigen ELISA. A non-competitive sandwich ELISA assay was used to
measure PV D-antigen content50. Briefly, two-fold dilutions of antigen were
captured with a serotype-specific polyclonal antibody, and then detected using
serotype-specific, D antigen (MAb520) or C antigen (MAb517) specific
monoclonal antibodies followed by anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate.
The D antigen content of each test sample was evaluated against a reference
of assigned D antigen content51 by parallel line analysis (Combistats) in order to
derive human-dose equivalents. The human dose for type 3 IPV is 32 D-antigen
units.
Thermostability. The temperature at which a conformational change from D to C
antigenicity occurred was determined by heating at a range of temperatures from
30 to 60 °C followed by D and C antigen ELISA32. Samples were diluted in 6-salt
PBS to twice the concentration required to obtain an OD of 1.0 in D antigen
ELISA, duplicate samples were heated for 10 min at each temperature then diluted
1:1 with 4% (w/v) dried milk in 6-salt PBS and cooled on ice. D and C antigen
content was measured by ELISA.
Immunization challenge. Transgenic mice expressing the human PV receptor
(TgPVR) were immunized and challenged as described previously32. TgPVR mice
of both sexes (eight per test group) received one or two intraperitoneal injections of
PBS (controls) or the equivalent of 0.5 human doses of purified VLPs or the IPV
European reference BRP;51 the second dose, where given, was on day 14. On day 35
blood samples were taken for analysis of neutralizing antibody titers and mice were
challenged intramuscularly with the equivalent of 25 times the PD50 of wt PV3
(Saukett) then monitored for any signs of paralysis for 14 days32.
Ethical approval. Animal experiments were performed under licenses granted by
the UK Home Office under the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 revised
2013 and reviewed by the internal NIBSC Animal Welfare and Ethics Review
Board. The TgPVR mouse experiments were performed under Home Office
licenses PPL 80/2478 and PPL 80/2050 which were reviewed and approved by the
NIBSC Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Board before submission.
Data availability. The atomic coordinates of the PV3 SC8 VLP and the PV3 SC8 +
GPP3 complex have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank under accession code
