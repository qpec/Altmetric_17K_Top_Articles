BACKGROUND
Low-molecular-weight heparin is the standard treatment for cancer-associated ve-
nous thromboembolism. The role of treatment with direct oral anticoagulant agents 
is unclear.
METHODS
In this open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients with cancer 
who had acute symptomatic or incidental venous thromboembolism to receive either 
low-molecular-weight heparin for at least 5 days followed by oral edoxaban at a dose 
of 60 mg once daily (edoxaban group) or subcutaneous dalteparin at a dose of 200 IU 
per kilogram of body weight once daily for 1 month followed by dalteparin at a dose 
of 150 IU per kilogram once daily (dalteparin group). Treatment was given for at 
least 6 months and up to 12 months. The primary outcome was a composite of re-
current venous thromboembolism or major bleeding during the 12 months after 
randomization, regardless of treatment duration.
RESULTS
Of the 1050 patients who underwent randomization, 1046 were included in the modi-
fied intention-to-treat analysis. A primary-outcome event occurred in 67 of the 522 
patients (12.8%) in the edoxaban group as compared with 71 of the 524 patients 
(13.5%) in the dalteparin group (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.70 to 1.36; P 
= 
0.006 for noninferiority; P 
= 
0.87 for superiority). Recurrent venous 
thromboembolism occurred in 41 patients (7.9%) in the edoxaban group and in 59 
patients (11.3%) in the dalteparin group (difference in risk, −3.4 percentage points; 
95% CI, −7.0 to 0.2). Major bleeding occurred in 36 patients (6.9%) in the edoxaban 
group and in 21 patients (4.0%) in the dalteparin group (difference in risk, 2.9 per-
centage points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 5.6).
CONCLUSIONS
Oral edoxaban was noninferior to subcutaneous dalteparin with respect to the com-
posite outcome of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding. The rate 
of recurrent venous thromboembolism was lower but the rate of major bleeding was 
higher with edoxaban than with dalteparin. (Funded by Daiichi Sankyo; Hokusai

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
V
enous thromboembolism is a com-
mon complication of cancer and its ther-
apy.1,2 Treatment of cancer-associated ve-
nous thromboembolism is challenging, and the 
risks of recurrent thrombosis and bleeding are 
higher among patients with cancer than among 
those without cancer.3 These two complications 
are important because they contribute to mortal-
ity and morbidity and may interfere with cancer 
treatment and increase the risk of hospitalization.
In previous studies involving patients with 
cancer who had venous thromboembolism, the 
rate of recurrent thrombosis was lower with a 
6-month course of low-molecular-weight heparin 
than with vitamin K antagonists, and the risk of 
bleeding was similar with the two treatments.4,5 
Therefore, guidelines recommend treatment with 
low-molecular-weight heparin.6-8 However, wheth-
er this therapy has a benefit beyond 6 months is 
unknown, and the therapy is burdensome because 
it requires daily subcutaneous injections, which 
limits its adoption.9,10
Direct oral anticoagulant agents are as effec-
tive as vitamin K antagonists for the treatment 
of venous thromboembolism and are associated 
with less frequent and less severe bleeding.11,12 
However, the efficacy and safety of direct oral 
anticoagulants as compared with long-term low-
molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of 
cancer-associated venous thromboembolism have 
not been established. We conducted the Hokusai 
VTE Cancer trial to compare the oral factor Xa 
inhibitor edoxaban with subcutaneous dalteparin 
for the treatment of patients with cancer-associ-
ated venous thromboembolism. The trial assessed 
for a composite outcome of recurrent venous 
thromboembolism or major bleeding, which are 
the two most prominent complications of these 
therapies. Our objective was to compare these 
two regimens for at least 6 months and up to 12 
months to provide needed guidance on treatment 
beyond 6 months.
Methods
Trial Oversight
The rationale and design of this randomized, 
open-label trial have been reported previously.13 
A coordinating committee, in collaboration with 
the sponsor (Daiichi Sankyo), was responsible for 
the trial design, protocol, and oversight. The insti-
tutional review board at each participating center 
approved the protocol.
The sponsor was responsible for collection and 
maintenance of the data. An independent data and 
safety monitoring committee periodically reviewed 
trial outcomes. The sponsor performed the sta-
tistical analysis in collaboration with the writing 
committee, which included all the authors. The 
members of the writing committee wrote all 
drafts of the manuscript and made the decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication; they 
also verified the data and vouch for the complete-
ness of the data, the accuracy of the analyses, and 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. The pro-
tocol and accompanying documents are available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Patients
Adult patients with cancer were eligible for inclu-
sion in the trial if they had acute symptomatic or 
incidentally detected deep-vein thrombosis in-
volving the popliteal, femoral, or iliac vein or the 
inferior vena cava; acute symptomatic pulmonary 
embolism that was confirmed by means of diag-
nostic imaging; or incidentally detected pulmo-
nary embolism involving segmental or more prox-
imal pulmonary arteries. An independent clinical 
events committee, whose members were un-
aware of the treatment assignments, confirmed 
the qualifying diagnosis of venous thromboem-
bolism. The protocol also required that the treat-
ing physician intended to administer low-molecu-
lar-weight heparin for at least 6 months.
Patients had to have cancer other than basal-
cell or squamous-cell skin cancer that was active 
or had been diagnosed within the previous 2 years 
and was objectively confirmed. Active cancer was 
defined as cancer diagnosed within the previous 
6 months; recurrent, regionally advanced, or meta-
static cancer; cancer for which treatment had been 
administered within 6 months before random-
ization; or hematologic cancer that was not in 
complete remission. A single independent physi-
cian (the second author), who was unaware of 
the treatment assignments, reviewed the data 
for all the enrolled patients to confirm the diag-
nosis of cancer and to verify the status of cancer 
as active or inactive.
A list of the exclusion criteria is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. 
All the patients provided written informed consent.

Edoxaban for Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism
Randomization and Trial Treatment
Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 
1:1 ratio, to receive either edoxaban or dalteparin. 
Randomization was performed with the use of 
an interactive Web-based system, with stratifica-
tion according to whether risk factors for bleed-
ing were present and whether the patient met 
the criteria to receive a lower dose of edoxaban. 
Risk factors for bleeding were surgery within the 
previous 2 weeks, the use of antiplatelet agents, 
a primary or metastatic brain tumor, regionally 
advanced or metastatic cancer, gastrointestinal 
or urothelial cancer that had been diagnosed 
within the previous 6 months, or treatment with 
bevacizumab within the previous 6 weeks.
Edoxaban was started after a course of thera-
peutic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin was 
given subcutaneously for at least 5 days. This lead-
in low-molecular-weight heparin was not required 
to be dalteparin; the choice of heparin and thera-
peutic regimen were at the discretion of the treat-
ing physician. Edoxaban was administered orally 
at a fixed dose of 60 mg once daily, with or with-
out food. It was administered at a lower dose 
(30 mg once daily) in patients with a creatinine 
clearance of 30 to 50 ml per minute or a body 
weight of 60 kg or less or in those receiving con-
comitant treatment with potent P-glycoprotein 
inhibitors.
Dalteparin was given subcutaneously at a 
dose of 200 IU per kilogram of body weight once 
daily for 30 days,4 with a maximum daily dose of 
18,000 IU. Thereafter, dalteparin was given at a 
dose of 150 IU per kilogram once daily.4 If the 
platelet count declined to less than 100,000 per 
microliter during treatment, the dose of daltepa-
rin was temporarily reduced.
In all the patients, treatment with edoxaban 
or dalteparin was to be continued for at least 
 
6 months and up to 12 months. The duration be-
yond 6 months was determined by the treating 
physician.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was a composite of recur-
rent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding. 
Recurrent venous thromboembolism was defined 
as symptomatic new deep-vein thrombosis or 
pulmonary embolism, incidental new deep-vein 
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism involving 
segmental or more proximal pulmonary arteries, 
or fatal pulmonary embolism or unexplained 
death for which pulmonary embolism could not 
be ruled out as the cause. Incidental venous throm-
boembolism was defined as thromboembolism 
that was detected by means of imaging tests per-
formed for reasons other than clinical suspicion of 
venous thromboembolism.14 In accordance with 
the criteria of the International Society on Throm-
bosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), major bleeding 
was defined as overt bleeding that was associ-
ated with a decrease in the hemoglobin level of 
2 g per deciliter or more, led to a transfusion of 
2 or more units of blood, occurred in a critical 
site, or contributed to death.15
Death was adjudicated to be caused by venous 
thromboembolism, bleeding, cancer, cardiovas-
cular disease, or other causes. Pulmonary embo-
lism was considered to be the cause of death if 
there was objective documentation that pulmo-
nary embolism caused the death or if the death 
could not be attributed to a documented cause 
and pulmonary embolism could not be ruled out.
A list of prespecified secondary outcomes and 
the criteria for adjudication of all the outcomes 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. 
The clinical events committee adjudicated all the 
suspected outcome events and causes of death, as 
well as the severity of the major bleeding events, 
with the use of prespecified criteria.12
Surveillance and Follow-up
All the patients were followed for 12 months or 
until the end of the trial (minimum follow-up, 
 
9 months). Patients underwent assessment, in the 
clinic or by telephone, on day 31 after randomiza-
tion and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients were 
instructed to report symptoms that were sugges-
tive of recurrent venous thromboembolism or 
bleeding. Appropriate diagnostic tests, laboratory 
tests, or both were required in patients with sus-
pected outcome events. The following adverse 
events were reported: suspected outcome events, 
serious adverse events that were not related to 
the underlying cancer or its treatment, and com-
bined elevations in aminotransferase and biliru-
bin levels.
Statistical Analysis
The trial hypothesis was that edoxaban would be 
noninferior to dalteparin with respect to the rate 
of primary-outcome events (recurrent venous

thromboembolism or major bleeding), with an 
upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for 
the hazard ratio of less than 1.5 and a two-sided 
alpha level of 0.05. The margin of 1.5 was chosen 
as the maximum difference that may be poten-
tially clinically acceptable because of the unmet 
need for an alternative to parenteral low-molec-
ular-weight heparin and the advantages of oral 
therapy. Assuming equal effectiveness of edoxa-
ban and dalteparin (i.e., a hazard ratio of 1.0) 
and a rate of primary-outcome events at 12 months 
of 20%, we estimated that a sample of approxi-
mately 1000 patients would be required to ob-
serve an expected total of 191 primary-outcome 
events and would give the trial 80% power to 
show the noninferiority of edoxaban. When 
the number of patients who were enrolled in the 
trial approached 1000, we set the date for the 
end of the trial such that the last patient enrolled 
would complete 9 months of follow-up.
The analysis of the primary outcome was per-
formed in the modified intention-to-treat popula-
tion, which included all the patients who had 
undergone randomization and received at least 
one dose of the assigned treatment. The primary 
analysis included any primary-outcome events 
that had occurred from randomization through 
the end of 12 months or the end of the trial 
(overall trial period), regardless of the duration 
of treatment for each patient. The time to the 
first primary-outcome event was analyzed with 
the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model to 
compare the hazards between treatment groups. 
The stratification factors were used as covari-
ates. Time-to-event curves were calculated with 
the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. Analyses 
of secondary safety outcomes were performed in 
the safety population, which was the same as the 
modified intention-to-treat population.
Two sensitivity analyses were planned for the 
primary outcome. The first was an analysis of 
primary-outcome events that occurred during the 
first 6 months, which was the minimum intended 
duration of the assigned treatment and corre-
sponds with the treatment duration used in previ-
ous trials.4,5 The second was an analysis of out-
comes that occurred during treatment (i.e., during 
or within 3 days after discontinuation of the as-
signed treatment) in the per-protocol population. 
This population excluded patients who had not 
received at least one dose of edoxaban or dalte-
parin after randomization and patients in whom 
the qualifying diagnosis of venous thromboembo-
lism had not been confirmed.
Results
Patients and Treatment
From July 2015 through December 2016, a total 
of 1050 patients were enrolled at 114 centers in 
13 countries (Fig. 1). The baseline characteristics 
of the patients were similar in the two trial groups 
(Table 1). The types of cancer and the categories of 
anticancer drugs given during the course of the 
trial are shown in Tables S1 and S2, respectively, 
in the Supplementary Appendix. The median du-
ration of the assigned treatment was 211 days 
(interquartile range, 76 to 357) in the edoxaban 
group and 184 days (interquartile range, 85 to 341) 
in the dalteparin group (P 
= 
0.01). Details about 
the duration of the assigned treatment and rea-
sons for discontinuation are provided in Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix. The counts of 
pills and syringes indicated that 447 patients 
(85.6%) in the edoxaban group and 465 patients 
(88.7%) in the dalteparin group had received at 
least 80% of the prescribed treatment before 
permanent discontinuation.
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome of recurrent venous throm-
boembolism or major bleeding occurred in 67 of 
the 522 patients (12.8%) in the edoxaban group 
and in 71 of the 524 patients (13.5%) in the dalte-
parin group (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.36; P 
= 
0.006 for noninfe-
riority; P 
= 
0.87 for superiority) (Table 2). The time 
to the occurrence of primary-outcome events is 
shown in Figure 2. Characteristics of the primary-
outcome events are shown in Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
The results of the two prespecified sensitivity 
analyses were similar to the results of the primary 
analysis and also met the criteria for noninferiority 
(Tables S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). In the analysis of events that occurred dur-
ing the first 6 months, a primary-outcome event 
occurred in 55 patients (10.5%) in the edoxaban 
group and in 56 patients (10.7%) in the dalteparin 
group (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.46; 
P 
= 
0.02 for noninferiority). In the analysis of 
events that occurred during treatment in the per-

protocol population, a primary-outcome event oc-
curred in 51 of 490 patients (10.4%) in the edoxa-
ban group and in 53 of 508 patients (10.4%) in the 
dalteparin group (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68 
to 1.46; P 
= 
0.02 for noninferiority).
Secondary Outcomes
The secondary outcomes are shown in Table 2. 
Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 
41 patients (7.9%) in the edoxaban group and in 
59 patients (11.3%) in the dalteparin group (dif-
ference in risk, −3.4 percentage points [95% CI, 
−7.0 to 0.2]; hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.48 to 
1.06; P 
= 
0.09]). Major bleeding occurred in 36 
patients (6.9%) in the edoxaban group and in 21 
patients (4.0%) in the dalteparin group (differ-
ence in risk, 2.9 percentage points [95% CI, 0.1 
to 5.6]; hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.03 to 3.04; 
P 
= 
0.04]).
The time to the occurrence of recurrent ve-
nous thromboembolism and major bleeding dur-
ing the overall trial period is shown in Figure 3. 
Sensitivity analyses for the secondary outcomes 
are shown in Tables S5 and S6, data on bleeding 
events that occurred during treatment in the 
safety population are shown in Table S7, and 
data on event-free survival are shown in Figure 
S1 — all in the Supplementary Appendix.
Death occurred in 206 patients (39.5%) in the 
edoxaban group and in 192 patients (36.6%) in 
the dalteparin group. The causes of death are 
shown in Table S8 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. The majority of deaths were related to cancer; 
six deaths in each group were related to either 
venous thromboembolism or bleeding.
Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome, and 
for recurrent venous thromboembolism and ma-
jor bleeding separately, are shown in Figures S2 
through S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. There 
were no statistically significant interactions be-
tween subgroup and treatment, except for the 
subgroups defined according to whether the pa-
tient had gastrointestinal cancer at the time of 
randomization. Patients with gastrointestinal can-
cer were more likely to have an increase in the risk 
of bleeding during treatment with edoxaban than 
Figure 1. Randomization and Follow-up.
The modified intention-to-treat and safety populations included all the patients who had undergone randomization 
and received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. Of the 303 patients in the edoxaban group and the 316 in 
the dalteparin group who completed the overall trial period, 72 and 69 patients, respectively, had their follow-up 
truncated to between 9 and 12 months because they were enrolled less than 12 months before the end of the trial.

cancer that was present at randomization or had been diagnosed within 6 months before randomization, and treat-
ment with bevacizumab within the 6-week period before randomization.

with dalteparin (P 
= 
0.02 for interaction in the 
safety population).
Adverse Events
The adverse events reported in the trial are shown 
in Tables S9, S10, and S11 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. The most common adverse events were 
progression of neoplasm and pneumonia; for each 
of these events, the rate was similar in the two 
treatment groups.
Discussion
The Hokusai VTE Cancer trial, which involved 
patients with predominantly advanced cancer and 
acute symptomatic or incidental venous thrombo-
embolism, showed that treatment with a fixed 
once-daily dose of oral edoxaban for up to 12 
months was noninferior to treatment with sub-
cutaneous dalteparin with respect to the com-
posite outcome of recurrent venous thromboem-

The overall trial period was the time from randomization through the end of 12 months or the end of the trial, regardless of the duration of 
treatment for each patient.
†  
No patient in either group had confirmed fatal pulmonary embolism. A total of six patients in the edoxaban group and four patients in the 
dalteparin group had unexplained death for which pulmonary embolism could not be ruled out as the cause.
‡  
The severity of major bleeding at clinical presentation was adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee (whose members were 
unaware of the treatment assignments) according to the following prespecified categories: category 1 included bleeding events that were 
not considered to be a clinical emergency; category 2 included bleeding events that could not be classified in any of the other categories be-
cause they led to some treatment but were not considered to be a clinical emergency; category 3 included bleeding events that were consid-
ered to be a clinical emergency, such as bleeding with hemodynamic instability or intracranial bleeding with neurologic symptoms; and cate-
gory 4 included bleeding events that led to death before or almost immediately after the patient entered the hospital.12
§  
Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was defined as overt bleeding that did not meet the criteria for major bleeding but was associated with the 
use of medical intervention, contact with a physician, interruption of the assigned treatment, discomfort, or impairment of activities of daily living.
¶  
For patients who had more than one event, only the first was counted.
‖  
Event-free survival was defined as the absence of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death.

bolism or major bleeding. The rate of recurrent 
venous thromboembolism was numerically low-
er with edoxaban than with dalteparin (7.9% 
and 11.3%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% 
CI, 0.48 to 1.06; P 
= 
0.09) because of the lower 
rate of recurrent symptomatic deep-vein throm-
bosis with edoxaban (Table 2). The 8.8% rate of 
recurrent venous thromboembolism at 6 months 
in the dalteparin group in this trial is consistent 
with rates reported with dalteparin in previous 
studies involving patients with cancer.4,16
The rate of major bleeding was significantly 
higher with edoxaban than with dalteparin 
(6.9% and 4.0%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.77; 
95% CI, 1.03 to 3.04; P 
= 
0.04). This difference 
was mainly due to the higher rate of upper gas-
trointestinal bleeding with edoxaban. This find-
ing is consistent with results of previous studies 
of direct oral anticoagulants.11 The increase in 
upper gastrointestinal major bleeding occurred 
mainly in patients who had entered the trial with 
gastrointestinal cancer. However, the frequency 
of severe major bleeding (category 3 or 4; see 
Table 2) was similar with edoxaban and daltepa-
rin. The 3.2% rate of major bleeding at 6 months 
in the dalteparin group in this trial is lower than 
previously reported rates with dalteparin.4,16
Our trial has some limitations. First, the use 
of an open-label design is a potential weakness, 
but long-term administration of placebo injec-
tions was not considered to be appropriate. To 
mitigate potential bias, all events were adjudi-
cated by a committee whose members were un-
aware of the treatment assignments. Second, the 
number of primary-outcome events was lower 
than expected; despite this limitation, noninfe-
riority was established. Third, the median dura-
tion of the assigned treatment was shorter with 
dalteparin than with edoxaban, which may have 
influenced the relative efficacy of the two treat-
ments. However, this difference was primarily 
due to the inconvenience of the use of subcuta-
neous dalteparin as compared with oral edoxa-
ban, thus demonstrating the desirability of oral 
therapy in this context. In addition, the sensitiv-
ity analysis of events that occurred during treat-
ment in the per-protocol population confirmed 
the results of the primary analysis. Finally, the 
trial included a broad spectrum of patients with 
cancer who had received a wide array of cyto-

toxic and biologic therapies, but the sample size 
limits our ability to make definitive conclusions 
about outcomes associated with individual tu-
mor types.
In conclusion, in this trial involving patients 
with cancer-associated venous thromboembo-
lism, edoxaban was noninferior to dalteparin 
with respect to the composite outcome of recur-
rent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding.
