Abstract
Dolphin stranding events occur frequently in Florida and Massachusetts. Dolphins are an
excellent sentinel species for toxin exposures in the marine environment. In this report we
examine whether cyanobacterial neurotoxin, β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), is present
in stranded dolphins. BMAA has been shown to bioaccumulate in the marine food web,
including in the muscles and fins of sharks. Dietary exposure to BMAA is associated with the
occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles and β-amyloid plaques in nonhuman primates. The
findings of protein-bound BMAA in brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer’s disease has
advanced the hypothesis that BMAA may be linked to dementia. Since dolphins are apex
predators and consume prey containing high amounts of BMAA, we examined necropsy
specimens to determine if dietary and environmental exposures may result in the accumula-
tion of BMAA in the brains of dolphins. To test this hypothesis, we measured BMAA in a
series of brains collected from dolphins stranded in Florida and Massachusetts using two
orthogonal analytical methods: 1) high performance liquid chromatography, and 2) ultra-per-
formance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. We detected high levels
of BMAA (20–748 μg/g) in the brains of 13 of 14 dolphins. To correlate neuropathological
changes with toxin exposure, gross and microscopic examinations were performed on corti-
cal brain regions responsible for acoustico-motor navigation. We observed increased num-
bers of β-amyloid+ plaques and dystrophic neurites in the auditory cortex compared to the
visual cortex and brainstem. The presence of BMAA and neuropathological changes in the
stranded dolphin brain may help to further our understanding of cyanotoxin exposure and its
potential impact on human health.

 Introduction
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are becoming increasingly frequent in fresh water lakes, estuar-
ies, and the sea [1–3] likely due to climate warming and increased phosphorous and nitrogen
effluents [2]. HABs are sometimes associated with widespread dying-off of sea grass and fish
ascribed to the large biomass of algae producing hypoxic conditions in the water [4]. HABs
composed of cyanobacteria contain multiple cyanotoxins including microcystins, nodularin,
cylindrospermopsin, and anatoxins, while those composed of dinoflagellates can contain bre-
vitoxins [5–7]. Acute and chronic exposures to such toxins can be harmful to both humans
and animals resulting in respiratory illnesses, severe dermatitis, mucosal damage, cancer,
organ failure and death [7].
The cyanotoxin, β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), has been linked to several neurode-
generative diseases [8–11]. BMAA has been shown to pass the blood-brain barrier where it is
incorporated into brain proteins [3,12–14] inducing misfolding and aggregation [13]. Chronic
dietary exposure to BMAA has been shown to trigger neurodegenerative changes in experi-
mental models including non-human primates [15–17]. BMAA has also been detected in post-
mortem brain tissues of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinsonism
Dementia Complex of Guam (ALS/PDC) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [18–20]. Epidemio-
logical studies support a link between BMAA and neurodegenerative disease, since people liv-
ing in close proximity of lakes with frequent cyanobacteria blooms have increased an
incidence of ALS [21–25]. BMAA has been shown to accumulate in long-lived apex predators
like sharks [26], as well as throughout the South Florida marine food web [27,28].
Dolphins that inhabit Florida coastal waters are often exposed to recurring HABs [29–31].
Coastal subpopulations of bottlenose dolphins in the southeastern United States have an
increased risked of cyanobacteria bloom exposure, compared to common dolphins, a pelagic
species, which spend relatively little time in coastal or near-shore environments [27,32]. Bottle-
nose dolphins have a median lifespan of 30 to 32 years with an maximum of 50 years in captiv-
ity [33]. Irrespective of age or sex, bottlenose dolphins have been observed stranded all along
the coastal United States [34–36]. Stranding events have been attributed to trauma [37], infec-
tions [35], neuropathology [38], navy sonar [39,40] or toxin exposures [29]. Regardless of
cause of stranding, dolphins are valuable bio-indicators of the health of the marine environ-
ment and provide clues of potential environmental risks to humans. We hypothesize that dol-
phins are likely to accumulate BMAA both by exposure to HABs and by the ingestion of prey
previously exposed to the cyanotoxin [27,28].
In this study, we examined an opportunistic sample of brain tissues from fourteen stranded
dolphins obtained from the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and the
International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). BMAA was measured in select brain regions
of stranded dolphins. In addition, we examined brain tissues of seven dolphins stranded in
Massachusetts to seek a correlation between neuropathological changes and the presence of
BMAA.
Material and methods
Dolphins
Adult (n = 9) and sub-adult (n = 5) stranded dolphins were obtained from ten different sites in
Florida and Massachusetts between 2005 and 2012 (S1 Table). The seven Florida dolphins
were found stranded in sites known to have recurring harmful algal blooms: Atlantic Ocean
[41], Banana River [42], Indian River Lagoon [42,43] and Gulf of Mexico [30]. The seven Mas-
sachusetts dolphins were found stranded in various sites in Cape Cod Bay [44]. Cyanobacteria

 species capable of producing BMAA were detected in all these regions as determined by sur-
veillance data from the Phytoplankton Monitoring Network (S2 Table) [45]. Dolphins were
classified as adult or sub-adult based on body length from the Geraci & Lounsbury 1993
stranding guide [46]. Dolphins varied in manner of stranding, species and sex (S1 Table). Six
of fourteen dolphins (43%) were observed alive while stranded. Physical assessments were per-
formed on the dolphins when first sighted [46]; those assessed to be in poor health and unable
to be released were euthanized on site, followed by a full necropsy within 24 to 48 hours by
IFAW. Dolphin specimens in Massachusetts were obtained under a Stranding Agreement
between National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisher-
ies Services Greater Atlantic Region Fisheries Office and IFAW. That agreement enables access
to and management of stranded pinnipeds and cetaceans, and where applicable, landowners
were consulted when animals were located on private property. Clinical assessments and
euthanasia were conducted according to IFAW’s protocols approved by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Euthanasia was
done by intravenous barbiturate, following guidelines from Barco et al 2016 [47]. Euthanasia
decisions were made on the basis of prognosis. The Florida specimens were obtained from
deceased dolphins found off the Florida coast, either beached or floating. Necropsies on these
dolphins were performed at the Hubbs Seaworld Research Institute. These specimens were
obtained with permission from the National Marine Fisheries Services (S1 Table).
At necropsy, external and internal examinations were performed and tissue samples were
collected for histopathology and infectious disease testing (Morbillivirus, Brucella spp., etc.
[48]) where available (S1 Table). Brains from the Massachusetts’ cohort (n = 7 dolphins) were
harvested, and a mid-sagittal cut was made to separate each brain into right and left hemi-
spheres. One hemisphere was frozen and stored in an ultra-low freezer at -80˚C for toxicologi-
cal analysis and the other hemisphere was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for one
month for histopathological assessments. Cryopreserved brain tissues were sampled for analyt-
ical measures of BMAA (see methods below). Formalin-fixed brain hemispheres were used to
assess neuropathological changes (see methods below). Toxicological and histological assess-
ments of dolphin brain specimens were performed with the approval from the NOAA South-
east Region Stranding Program and National Marine Fisheries Service.
Analytical reagents
BMAA, a non-protein amino acid, was measured in dolphin brain tissue using fluorescence
high performance liquid chromatography and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/ tan-
dem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) as described in Mondo et al. 2012 & 2014 [26,49]:
AQC Waters AccQTag reagent (PN WAT052880) Reagent Kit was purchased from the Waters
Corporation (Milford, MA, USA). Acetonitrile (ACN), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and HPLC
grade water, were acquired from VWR (Suwanee, GA, USA). β-N-methylamino-L-alanine
hydrochloride (BMAA) DL-2,4-diaminobutyric acid dihydrochloride (DAB)were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (B-107 and 32830, respectively, St. Louis, MO, USA). N-2(amino)ethylgly-
cine (AEG) was obtained from TCI America (A1153, Portland, OR).
Brain extraction and analytical methods
Frozen punch biospecimens (200 mg) from the cerebral cortex of each dolphin were made
using a 6.0mm Biopunch (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding CA, USA). Punch biospecimens were
obtained from the auditory cortex (ACtx) and the visual cortex (VCtx). Following sampling, tis-
sue biospecimens were subjected to total acid hydrolysis and assayed for total concentrations of
BMAA and BMAA structural isomers N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine (AEG) and 2,4-diaminobutyric

 acid (DAB) as described by Mondo et al 2012 [26]. No attempts were made to differentiate free
from protein bound BMAA. Briefly, a 1:6 W/V of 6 N HCl (1000 μL) was added to each cortical
biopsy, followed by sonication. Samples were then hydrolyzed on a heat block for 18 hours at
110˚C, filtered at 13,800 x g for 3 minutes at 4˚C (0.22 lm Ultrafree-MC, Millipore, Bedford,
MA, USA), and concentrated in a speed-vacuum (Thermo-Savant SC250DDA Speed Vac
Plus with a Savant refrigerator trap RVT 4104). The dried extract was then resuspended to
1000 μL of 20 mM HCl. An aliquot of the sample extract was derivatized with AQC using the
AccQ-Fluor reagent (Waters Crop, Milford, MA). The derivatized samples (20 μL resuspended
HCl extract, 60 μL of borate buffer, and 20 μL AccQ-Tag) were run in parallel with buffer and
AQC blanks, and L-BMAA, AEG, DAB and reference amino acid standards. Since control dol-
phin specimens could not be obtained, fresh frozen human brain tissues were used in our assay.
For a negative control, frozen punch biopsies were obtained from the cortex of a 68 year-old
human female with no known neurological changes and previously found to be free of BMAA
[18]. For a positive control, punch biopsies were obtained from a 77 year-old human male with
ALS whose tissues were previously shown to contain a high concentration of BMAA [18]. In
addition, control sample matrixes were also spiked with known amounts of BMAA to confirm
the efficiency of extraction.
HPLC method
BMAA and its structural isomers (AEG & DAB) were detected and quantified using a vali-
dated HPLC method [50,51] with minor modifications [19,26]. Briefly, the non-protein amino
acid BMAA was separated from its structural isomers and other protein amino acids using
reverse-phase elution (Waters Nova-Pak C18 column, 3.9 mm x 300 mm) on a Waters 1525
Binary HPLC pump and a Waters 717 autosampler. The mobile phase consisted of 140 mM
sodium acetate, 5.6 mM triethylamine, pH 5.7 (Eluent A), and 52% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile
(Eluent B) using a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute and a 10 μl sample injection volume. The sam-
ples were eluted using a 60 min gradient: 0.0 minute 100% A; 2.0 minutes 90% A; 5.0 minutes
86% A; 10.0 minutes 86% A; 18.0 minutes 73% A; 30.0 minutes 57% A; 35.0 minutes 40% A;
37.5 minutes 100% B; 47.5 minutes 100% B; 50.0 minutes 100% A; 60.0 minutes 100% A. Sam-
ples were derivatized with the AQC fluorescent tag using 20 μL aliquot of sample plus 20 μL
6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC) in 60 μL of borate buffer. Com-
pounds were clearly separated with AEG at 29.6 min, BMAA elution at 31.1 min, and DAB at
33 minutes.
Detection was achieved using a Waters 2475 Multi k-Fluorescence Detector with excitation
at 250 nm and emission at 395 nm. Measurements of BMAA in dolphin cortical tissues were
compared with those of the human positive and negative controls (described above), and those
spiked with known amounts of a reference BMAA standard (Sigma B-107; >95% purity,
St. Louis, MO, USA). The limits of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ)
were based on the standard deviation (SD) of response and slope (S), calculated from linearity
of the response of BMAA. The LOD (2.7 ng) and LOQ (7.0 ng) were obtained by using formula
(3.3 x SD)/S and (10 x SD)/S, respectively. The efficiency of the analyte recovery was estimated
adding known amounts of a BMAA standard spiked into a reference sample that was below
the LOD.
UPLC-MS/MS method
BMAA and its structural isomers AEG and DAB were separated, detected and quantified by
ultra-performance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) using
a fully validated method as previously described [52,53]. In brief, punch biospecimens of

 cerebral cortex (200 mg) were weighed and suspended in 1.0 mL of 6 N HCl sealed with N2 gas
blown into the tubes for 30 s to displace oxygen. Brain samples were hydrolyzed for 18 hours
at 110 ˚C. A subsample of 400 μL was filtered (0.22 μm PVDF Ultrafree MC centrifuge filters;
EMD Millipore; Billerica, MA, USA) and a 100 μL aliquot was dried overnight (Labconco Cen-
trivap; Kansas City, MO, USA). The sample was reconstituted in 1.0 mL 20 mM HCl and
derivatized as described above. BMAA, AEG and DAB were separated by reverse phase C18
chromatography (BEH column 150 × 2.1 mm 1.7 μm; Waters) and eluted with a gradient of 20
mM ammonium formate with 0.2% formic acid (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile; (B).
Gradient was delivered by a Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC (Milford, MA, USA) (0 min, 95%
A; 1.0 min, 95% A; 7 min, 85% A; 7.5 min, 78% A; 8 min, 15% A; 8.5 min, 15% A; 8.6 min, 95%
A; 10 min, 95% A) with a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min at 52 ˚C. Compounds were clearly separated
with BMAA elution at 6.56 min (%RSD = 0.23), AEG at 6.67 minute (%RSD = 0.22) and DAB
at 6.82 minutes (%RSD = 0.26). Triplicate measures were performed on each dolphin sample.
Ions were detected on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Waters Xevo TQS, Mil-
ford, MA, USA) with the following parameters: cone voltage was 16 V. Capillary voltage was
set to 2500 V with a source offset of 50 V. Desolvation temperature was 550 ˚C, with a corre-
sponding gas flow of 800 L/hour and a cone gas flow of 150 L/hour. Collision-induced-dissoci-
ation was performed with 99.99% pure argon pressurized to 7.0 bar with a dwell time of 0.05
sec. The characteristic transitions were detected as: BMAA 459 > 258 at collision voltage 18 V,
DAB 459 > 188 at collision voltage 20 V, AEG 459 > 214 at collision voltage 20 V. The method
performance characteristics were determined by definitions of the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). The Method Detection Limit (MDL) was < 0.01 pg on column. The lower
Limit of Quantification was > 0.02 pg on column. The average % recovery of BMAA in tripli-
cate samples spiked at 80%, 100% and 120% of the expected value was 98.3%. The precision
was <6% relative standard deviation (%RSD) for all replicated analyses in the sample matrix.
The HorRat value was calculated for triplicate analyses and falls within the AOAC recom-
mended range of 0.5–2.0 [52].
Immunohistochemistry
To investigate neuropathological changes, formalin-fixed brain tissue blocks (2 x 2 x 0.2 cm3)
were collected from the ACtx, VCtx and medulla (Md) from seven dolphins. Tissue blocks
were processed through xylenes and alcohols and embedded in paraffin wax. Microtome sec-
tions were cut at 5 μm and mounted on 1 x 3 inch glass slides. Tissue sections were deparaffi-
nized in three changes of xylene for 10 minutes each, followed by two changes of absolute
ethanol for 5 minutes each, then 95% ethanol for 5 minutes. Tissues sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (for cytoarchitecture) and thioflavine-S (for plaques, tangles,
and dystrophic neurites). Modified Bielschowsky’s (MB) silver staining was performed at
AML laboratories using an American MasterTech stain kit (Lodi, CA, USA) [54].
To probe for the specific protein antigens noted below, after rehydration sections were
incubated in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 minutes, followed by rinsing in 3 changes of distilled
water (DiH2O) each for 5 minutes. Slides were then incubated in 98% formic acid for 45 sec-
onds, followed by a wash in 3 changes of DiH2O on a Thermolyne Roto Mix shaker, and incu-
bation in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) for 5 minutes. To block non-specific
antibody bindings, 10% normal donkey serum in PBS pH 7.4 (PBS) was applied to tissue sec-
tions in a humidity chamber and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Sections
were then probed with mouse anti-β-amyloid (1:800, Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA); anti-neu-
ronal nuclei protein (Anti-NeuN Antibody, clone A60; 1:200, Millipore, MA, USA); or anti-
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:200, DAKO/Agilent, CA, USA). Antibodies were

 allowed to incubate at 4˚C overnight, and then the slides were rinsed with PBS for 3 x 10 min-
utes, followed by additional application of 2% normal donkey serum for 10 minutes then PBS
rinse. A donkey anti-mouse-biotin (1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA)
conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was incubated on tissue sections for 2 hours
at room temperature, rinsed with PBS wash for 10 minutes followed by application of ExtrAvi-
din peroxidase (1:5,000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in PBS for incubation for 1 hour.
ExtrAvidin peroxidase was detected using DAB solution (100 mL DAB = 98 mL PBS + 2 mL
25mg/mL DAB + 16.6 μL 3% H2O2) for 10 minutes. Slides were then washed in two changes of
PBS, rinsed with distilled water, counterstained with Gill No. 1 Hematoxylin for 20 seconds,
and rinsed under running tap water for 5 minutes. Frontal cortex samples from a patient with
advanced AD were used as a positive control for all neuropathology markers listed above.
Digital and fluorescent microscopic pathology
Histology slides were scanned at 40x resolution using a TissueScope LE (Huron Digital Pathol-
ogy, Waterloo, ON, CAN). Digital scanning allowed for complete micropathological review of
the entire dolphin brain tissue sections and margins at an optimal resolution of (0.2 μm/pixel
at 40x). High quality tif file images (975 x 477 pixels) were exported from TissueScope LE and
imported into NIH ImageJ 64 VER1.44o (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) for analysis of Aβ+
density and Aβ+ plaque area. To determine number and area size of Aβ+ plaques, a total of 6
images were analyzed per dolphin (ACtx n = 3 scans and VCtx n = 3 scans). Aβ+ plaques were
annotated and quantified using ImageJ cell counter plug-in software and presented as the
mean and standard error of Aβ+ deposits per 5x scan. A threshold was applied to regions of
interest to determine the area of each Aβ+ plaques. Slides stained with MB silver, thioflavine-S,
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), GFAP and Neu-N were visualized at 20x magnifica-
tion using a Zeiss Apotome fluorescent microscope (USA).
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism Version 7 software (Graph Pad, La Jolla, CA,
USA). Single comparisons tests were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon
matched-pairs test. Multiple comparisons were analyzed using Friedman test with Dunn’s
multiple comparison test. For correlation analyses, the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient and
Spearman correlation tests were used to determine significance. All data and results were
expressed as the Mean ± Standard Error; significance level of alpha = 0.05. Due to the limited
size of our sample cohort, Cohen’s d was used to determine effect size and D’Agostino & Pear-
son test was used to determine normality of data. A table of descriptive statistics for each com-
parison can be found in supplementary material (S3 Table).
Results
Stranded dolphins
A total of fourteen dolphins were investigated from the following dolphin species: bottlenose
dolphin (Turiops truncates) and common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) (S1 Table). Nine dol-
phins (64%) in our sample cohort were observed dead. Five dolphins (36%) were part of a
mass stranding. Four dolphins (29%) had conditions that have been shown to cause strand-
ings: one with mechanical trauma (Hubbs 0805 Tt) and three cases of Brucella infections
(IFAW 12-223Dd, 12-228Dd and 12-229Dd) [55]. Seven dolphins (50%) were female; seven
dolphins were male (50%). One dolphin (7%) was pregnant at the time of death. Nine dolphins
(64%) in the study were categorized as adult and five as sub-adult (36%). The bottlenose

 dolphins had 1.3-fold greater mean length than the common dolphins (P<0.0001, t-Test) (S1
Table). Bottlenose dolphins were also 4-fold greater in weight than the common dolphin
(P<0.0001, t-Test) (S1 Table). All dolphins except for two (Hubbs 0805-Tt and Hubbs
0630-Tt) had no detectable injury resulting from human interaction. Dolphin Hubbs 0805-Tt
had an old scar on her dorsal fin from a boat injury. Dolphin Hubbs 0630-Tt had fishing gear
entangled around the flukes and hooks in the oral cavity. External examinations of several dol-
phins (29%) showed signs of stranding stress (IFAW12-201Dd), cauliflower-like lesions on
flukes, peduncle and dorsal fin (IFAW12-228Dd), a large circular wound (Hubbs 0805 Tt) and
several broken ribs (Hubbs 0541-Tt). One dolphin (7%) (IFAW12-198Dd) had incidental
post-stranding injuries to the eyes as a result of gull pecking. Gross examinations of internal
structures were unremarkable, except for two dolphins (14%) with non-specific lung (Hubbs
0541 Tt) and spleen (IFAW12-198Dd) pathology. One dolphin had signs of hepatitis
(IFAW12-201Dd) [48].
Detection of BMAA
BMAA was detected in 13 of the 14 dolphins (93%) beached in both Florida and Massachusetts
(Table 1, S1 Table, Fig 1). One dolphin injured by boat collision was negative for BMAA
(Hubbs 0805 Tt). BMAA levels in the other 13 dolphin brains ranged from (20–748 μg/g). The
overall mean concentration of BMAA was 287.9 ± 64.3 μg/g and the median concentration
was 170 μg/g. The bottlenose dolphins that stranded in Florida had 3-fold (P = 0.01; t-Test)
higher concentrations of BMAA than the common dolphins from Massachusetts (Table 1, S1
Table). Sex had no effect on the mean concentration of BMAA. The average BMAA/length of
dolphin was 1.2 ± 0.2 μg/g/cm. BMAA concentrations were positively correlated with the
length of dolphin (n = 13; Pearson r = 0.6002; P = 0.01) (S3 Table). The mean concentration of
BMAA in the stranded dolphin brains was 1.4-fold higher than in reference brains of patients
with AD and ALS (S1 Table) [18]. In some dolphins, BMAA levels detected were up to 3.6-fold
greater than found in those of AD and ALS reference brains (S1 Table). The levels of BMAA
and the BMAA isomers (AEG and DAB) were not region-specific and the mean concentration
of BMAA, AEG, and DAB did not differ in auditory or visual cortex (Table 2). DAB was
detected in 7 of 7 (100%) of dolphins from Massachusetts. The mean concentration of DAB
detected is 2.4-fold higher than BMAA averaged across all dolphins. AEG was detected in 6 of
7 (86%) of dolphins stranded in Massachusetts. The mean concentration of AEG was 4-fold
lower than BMAA and 9.4-fold lower than DAB (P<0.0001; ANOVA). The detection of
BMAA and BMAA structural isomers in the dolphin brain was confirmed using LC-MS/MS
in representative animals sampled from the cohort (S4 Table).
Neuropathology in stranded dolphins
Gross examinations of external brain structures were unremarkable for all stranded dolphins
examined. Brain structures showed normal anatomic landmarks with normal gyral and sulcal
patterns (Fig 2A). No atrophy, white matter lesions, infarcts or hemorrhages were observed on
gross inspection of coronal sections of the brain. Internal gray and white matter structures
were also unremarkable, with clear delineation. The lateral, third and fourth ventricles were
normal in size (Fig 2B). Microscopic examination of H&E sections from the ACtx, VCtx and
Md tissue sections revealed evidence of cellular injury and age-related changes (see below).
Microscopic examination showed hypoxic, shrunken, and eosinophilic neurons in upper and
lower cortical layers and within brainstem nuclei (Fig 2C). Gliosis, mild neuronal satellitosis
and neuronal atrophy were present in cortical layers and brainstem (Fig 2D). Age-related his-
tological changes included accumulation of lipofuscin, chromatolysis, and corpora amylacea

 (Fig 2E–2G). In addition, moderate numbers of eosinophilic plaques were seen (Fig 2H) and
edema was observed throughout parts of the cerebral cortex and brain stem of all dolphins
(Fig 2C–2H). The pathological changes described above were present in all dolphins in varying
degrees regardless of age, sex or BMAA concentrations.
Aβ+ Pathology
Anti-Aβ staining showed Aβ+ plaques, ranging in occurrence from rare to very frequent, and
intracellular localization of Aβ in the cerebral cortex of all stranded dolphins (Fig 3A–3C). Aβ+
plaques were observed throughout the ACtx and VCtx. Rare to sparse Aβ+ plaques were local-
ized adjacent to neurons in the Md region of the brainstem (Fig 3D). The Aβ+ plaques varied
from focal clusters of well-defined plaques to diffused and poorly organized plaque-like struc-
tures. Aβ+ plaques were observed on both routine H&E and MB silver stained sections (Fig
3E–3P). Most Aβ+ plaques were senile (diffused) plaques, but rare argophyllic compact neu-
ritic plaques and neuropil threads were observed in the cerebral cortex (Fig 4A–4C). Intracel-
lular silver staining neurofibrillary tangles were observed in cortical neurons with dystrophic
neurites, indicating the presence of intracellular inclusions of insoluble proteins (Fig 4D–4F).
Thioflavin-S staining was used to confirm the Aβ+ staining of plaques and neuronal inclusions
(Fig 5A–5H). GFAP+ fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) provided evidence of reactive
astrocytes around thioflavin-S+ plaques (Fig 5A–5D). Semi-quantitative analysis showed the
densities of Aβ+ plaques were positively correlated in the ACtx and VCtx (n = 7; r = 0.89;
P<0.05) but, was 1.3-fold denser in the ACtx than in the VCtx (P = 0.01; t-Test) (Table 3, S3
Table). Dolphins with Brucella spp. infections had fewer Aβ+ plaques when compared to

ques did not differ between the two cortical regions. Neither age group nor sex of dolphins
affected the Aβ+ plaque deposition (S3 Table). Nor was Aβ+ plaque deposition correlated with
brain BMAA concentration (S3 and S5 Tables).
Discussion
As the world’s climate warms, HABs are becoming more frequent, including in eastern China,
which has seen some of the largest cyanobacterial blooms on Earth, and North America. Cya-
nobacteria produce powerful cyanotoxins that impact aquatic and terrestrial life. Exposures to
cyanotoxins are a public health concern as they are linked to organ system damage and disease.
Examining the levels of the cyanobacterial toxin BMAA in apex predators, such as dolphins
and sharks, provides a powerful bio-indicator of the potential for human exposures [26,27,49].
BMAA is produced by cyanobacteria that are sometimes seen as surface blooms, but can
occur in the water column and in benthic mats in lakes, shallow estuaries and bays. In marine

distinct retention times of 29.6 and 33.0 minutes, respectively.

 systems, BMAA enters the food chain via crustaceans and bottom-feeding fish, and then accu-
mulates into long-lived apex predators like sharks [26,27]. We now report that another apex
predator, dolphins, when exposed to cyanobacteria or diets of crustaceans and fish containing
BMAA, bioaccumulate the toxin in their neuroproteins. In our study, BMAA was present in
the brains of stranded dolphins at 1.4-fold greater amounts than in the brains of patients with
AD and ALS [18]. Dolphins beached in Florida were observed to have nearly 3-fold higher
concentrations of BMAA in their brains than dolphins beached in Massachusetts. The differ-
ences in BMAA concentration may be due to differences in diet, occurrences of algal blooms,
varying phytoplankton species or modes of stranding [56].
The recognition that the very high incidence of neurodegenerative disease Guam ALS/PDC
was likely due to the production of BMAA by endophytic cyanobacteria resident in specialized
coralloid roots of cycad trees led to the hypothesis that BMAA is a cause of ALS/PDC and
non-endemic ALS, and provided a link to neurodegenerative disorders [19,20]. In Guam,
cycad seeds contain BMAA and are used to make flour by the indigenous Chamorro. BMAA is
also biomagnified up the food chain to animals like pigs, deer and flying foxes that are part of
the Chamorro diet [20,50,57]. Once ingested, BMAA can cross the blood-brain barrier and
become incorporated into proteins where it is associated with neuropathological changes as
seen in Guam ALS/PDC [12,20]. In this paper, we have now shown that BMAA is detectable
in brains of dolphins that also show neuropathological changes characteristic of human neuro-
degenerative disease. Here, BMAA is also shown to accumulate with increasing length and age
class. Thus, our data suggest dolphins may provide a naturalistic model of BMAA toxin expo-
sures in marine environments. The effects of this exposure however are not yet clear.
Dolphins have a highly evolved cerebral cortex that underlies a sophisticated sonar naviga-
tion system [58]. Previous studies have shown that dolphins have age-related Aβ+ deposits in
their brains [58,59]. Aβ+ plaques, a diagnostic hallmark of AD, were observed to be widespread
in the auditory and visual cortex and to a lesser extent the brainstem of the stranded dolphins
examined in our study. Numerous Aβ+ intracellular inclusions and dystrophic neurites were
also observed. The increased deposition of Aβ+ plaques with accompanying histological
changes (e.g. lipofuscin, corpora amylacea) suggest cellular brain aging. Accumulation of
BMAA in the brains of dolphins may exacerbate these age related changes. This observation
also raises concern about the potential risk to human health of chronic exposure to BMAA
associated with increasingly frequent algal blooms in surrounding lakes and coastal waters.

 Lastly, Marine mammals and fish have long been known to concentrate methylmercury
(MeHg). Many water bodies have both high concentrations of mercury and frequent algal
blooms. High consumption of fish has been linked both to increased blood levels of mercury
and to higher incidence of neurodegenerative disease [60]. The co-occurrence of MeHg and
BMAA has synergistic neurotoxicity compared to single exposures [61] and has been sug-
gested as a link to dementia [62]. We detected BMAA in all but one dolphin beached in Florida
and Massachusetts. Further studies are needed to investigate the synergistic effect of MeHg on

 the dolphin brain. The potential combined neurotoxicity of BMAA and MeHg underscores
the impending impact of climate change on the marine food web.
Conclusion
We have detected BMAA in the cerebral cortex of stranded dolphins. We also report Alzhei-
mer-like neurodegenerative changes in the brains of dolphins containing BMAA. The pres-
ence of BMAA suggests that dolphins provide an excellent sentinel species for toxin exposures
in the marine environment.
