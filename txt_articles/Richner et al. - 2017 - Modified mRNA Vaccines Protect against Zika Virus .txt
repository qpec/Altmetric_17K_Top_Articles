SUMMARY
The emergence of ZIKV infection has prompted a global effort to develop safe and effective 
vaccines. We engineered a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine 
encoding wild-type or variant ZIKV structural genes and tested immunogenicity and protection in 
mice. Two doses of modified mRNA LNPs encoding prM-E genes that produced virus-like 
particles resulted in high neutralizing antibody titers (~ 1/100,000) that protected against ZIKV 
infection and conferred sterilizing immunity. To offset a theoretical concern of ZIKV vaccines

INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified in 1947 from a Rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of 
Uganda (Dick, 1952; Dick et al., 1952). Historically, ZIKV circulated between Aedes 
species mosquitoes and non-human primates, and episodically spilled into human 
populations in parts of Africa and Asia. Prior to 2010, ZIKV Infection was described as a 
self-limiting febrile illness with headache, rash, conjunctivitis, and myalgia. More recently, 
and especially in the context of its spread in the Western Hemisphere, more severe clinical 
consequences have been observed (Lazear and Diamond, 2016). Infection of fetuses during 
pregnancy has been associated with placental insufficiency and congenital malformations 
including cerebral calcifications, microcephaly, and miscarriage (Brasil et al., 2016; 
Rasmussen et al., 2016; van der Eijk et al., 2016). In adults, ZIKV infection is linked to 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by paralysis and 
polyneuropathy (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; Oehler et al., 2014). Sexual transmission of 
ZIKV also has been described from men-to-women (Foy et al., 2011), men-to-men (Deckard 
Richner et al.

 et al., 2016), and women-to-men (Davidson et al., 2016). Persistent ZIKV has been detected 
in semen, sperm, and vaginal secretions up to 6 months following infection (Mansuy et al., 
2016; Murray et al., 2017). ZIKV is now a global disease of the Americas, Africa, and Asia.
ZIKV is a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family of enveloped RNA 
viruses. ZIKV has an ~11 kb positive sense RNA genome. Translation of viral RNA in the 
cytoplasm generates a polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid (C), 
pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E)) and seven non-structural proteins 
(NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). ZIKV buds into the lumen of the 
endoplasmic reticulum as an immature virion composed of 60 icosahedrally arranged prM-E 
heterotrimers (Prasad et al., 2017). As the virus transits through the secretory pathway, the 
acidic environment of the Golgi network triggers exposure of a furin protease cleavage site 
within prM. Cleavage of prM and release of the pr peptide in the extracellular space 
produces mature, infectious virions that display 90 antiparallel E homodimers on their 
surface. The ZIKV E protein is composed of three ectodomains (DI, DII, and DIII) and is 
the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Potently inhibitory monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) against ZIKV target epitopes in all three E protein domains as well as quaternary 
structures composed of multiple domains within or across E dimers (Barba-Spaeth et al., 
2016; Sapparapu et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016; Swanstrom et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; 
Zhao et al., 2016). In addition to induction by infectious or inactivated virus particles, 
neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV can be produced after immunization with DNA 
plasmids encoding M-E protein (Larocca et al., 2016) or prM-E, which in some cases 
generates secreted virus-like subviral particles (SVPs) (Dowd et al., 2016b; Muthumani et 
al., 2016).
The existence of two ZIKV lineages, African and Asian/American (Haddow et al., 2012) 
does not impact antibody neutralization substantively and thus, ZIKV is classified as a single 
serotype (Dowd et al., 2016a). ZIKV is related to several pathogens that cause disease 
globally including Dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese 
encephalitis (JEV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses. Of these viruses, ZIKV is 
most closely related to the four serotypes of DENV as it shares 54 to 59% amino acid 
identity in the viral E protein (Dejnirattisai et al., 2016).
Because of its potential to infect and cause harm to developing fetuses and neonates (Huang 
et al., 2016), there is an urgent call to develop countermeasures (Marston et al., 2016). 
Several groups have developed subunit (prM-E or M-E DNA plasmid or adenovirus-
vectored) or inactivated virus vaccine platforms capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies 
that protect against ZIKV viremia in mice and non-human primates (Abbink et al., 2016; 
Dowd et al., 2016b; Larocca et al., 2016; Muthumani et al., 2016). Some of these vaccine 
candidates have initiated or are scheduled to begin recruitment of subjects for evaluation in 
humans (NCT02840487, NCT02887482, NCT02809443, NCT02937233, NCT02952833, 
and NCT02963909).
The sequence similarity between ZIKV and DENV poses issues for vaccine development 
due to cross-reactivity of the human anti-ZIKV antibody response (Dejnirattisai et al., 2016; 
Sapparapu et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016). Cross-reactive antibody responses may

 contribute minimally to protection, consistent with the limited neutralizing activity of many 
broadly-reactive anti-flavivirus mAbs in cell culture. Whereas primary infection with DENV 
generates an antibody response that protects against the homologous serotype, secondary 
infection with a heterologous DENV serotype can result in a potentially lethal shock 
syndrome. This disease is attributed in part to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection 
(ADE), whereby cross-reactive antibodies elicited by the first DENV serotype augment 
infection of the second DENV serotype in cells expressing Fc-γ receptors (Morens, 1994). 
This phenomenon could be relevant to ZIKV vaccination because DENV and ZIKV are 
related closely, and vaccinated subjects in or travelers to endemic areas could become 
exposed secondarily to DENV, which infects ~390 million people per year (Bhatt et al., 
2013). Indeed, cross-reactive antibodies targeting the highly conserved fusion loop in DII of 
E (E-DII-FL) derived during natural ZIKV infection can augment infectivity of DENV in 
cell culture (Dejnirattisai et al., 2016; Kawiecki and Christofferson, 2016; Stettler et al., 
2016) and in vivo in mice (Stettler et al., 2016). This laboratory-based data is not conclusive, 
as epidemiological studies, which may take years to perform, are required to establish the 
impact of ZIKV humoral immunity on DENV pathogenesis. Vaccine strategies that reduce 
induction of cross-reactive antibodies (Crill et al., 2012) might minimize the risk of 
sensitizing recipients to severe DENV infections, should the clinical relevance of ZIKV 
immunity on DENV pathogenesis be established.
We generated a versatile ZIKV vaccine platform in which lipid nanoparticles encapsulate 
modified mRNA encoding wild-type (WT) or variant ZIKV structural genes. Unlike DNA 
plasmid based vaccines, mRNA does not integrate into chromosomes, which can lead to 
insertional mutagenesis and potential oncogenesis (Pardi and Weissman, 2017). Non-
amplifying or self-amplifying mRNA-based vaccines were used recently to generate 
humoral responses against influenza A virus in mice (Hekele et al., 2013; Petsch et al., 
2012) or HIV in non-human primates (Bogers et al., 2015). Our modified non self-
amplifying mRNA vaccines have an optimized mRNA containing an open reading frame 
that encodes the antigen of interest, and 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions that optimize 
translation efficiency and intracellular stability, and a proprietary nucleoside modification to 
minimize the indiscriminate activation of innate immunity. mRNA can stimulate innate 
immunity through Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptors (Desmet and Ishii, 2012; Kariko et al., 
2004). Although the adjuvant effect of stimulating innate immunity might be advantageous 
for protein vaccines, indiscriminate immune activation can inhibit mRNA translation, thus 
reducing antigen expression and immunogenicity of an mRNA vaccine (Claudio et al., 2013; 
Coffman et al., 2010). This can be overcome by replacing uridine nucleosides with 
naturally-occurring base modifications, such as pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine 
(Anderson et al., 2011). Here, a two-dose immunization of modified mRNA encoding ZIKV 
prM-E induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected mice with genetic or 
acquired innate immune deficiencies against severe infection. Because mRNA vaccines can 
be synthesized with virtually any sequence, we created modified mRNA immunogens 
encoding mutations that abolished an immunodominant cross-reactive epitope in E-DII-FL. 
These mRNA induced protective antibody responses against ZIKV in mice and minimized 
the generation of cross-reactive antibodies that enhanced DENV infection in cell culture and 
pathogenicity in mice.

 RESULTS
An mRNA vaccine platform for ZIKV
We developed a vaccine platform for generating optimized lipid nanoparticles that 
encapsulate modified mRNA for intramuscular delivery to induce high levels of protein 
expression in vivo (Fig 1A and Fig S1). As a proof-of-principle, we designed a modified 
mRNA encoding a type 1 (N7mGpppAm) cap, optimized 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences 
(see STAR Methods), the signal sequence from human IgE, and the full-length prM and E 
genes from an Asian (Mirconesia 2007) ZIKV strain (Lanciotti et al., 2008), which has > 
99% amino acid sequence identity relative to strains from the Americas (Fig 1B). The 
modified mRNA was synthesized chemically and packaged into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). 
Incubation of LNPs containing IgE signal-prM-E mRNA (IgEsig-prM-E) with 293T or HeLa 
cells resulted in efficient expression and secretion of ~30 nm SVPs, as judged by electron 
microscopy (Fig 1C), Western blotting (Fig 1D) and mass spectrometry for ZIKV structural 
proteins in the cell supernatants (data not shown).
Vaccine efficacy in AG129 mice
We first assessed the immunogenicity and protective activity of IgEsig-prM-E LNPs in 
immunocompromised mice lacking type I and II interferon (IFN) signaling responses. Eight 
week-old Ifnar1−/− Ifngr−/− AG129 male and female mice were divided into five groups, 
which received an intramuscular inoculation of 2 or 10 μg of IgEsig-prM-E LNPs or 10 μg of 
a non-translating RNA LNP. Groups 1, 3, and 5 were boosted with the same dose at 21 days 
after vaccination whereas Groups 2 and 4 were not boosted (Fig 1E). At day 42 after 
immunization, mice were phlebotomized for serum neutralizing antibody analysis (Fig 1F–H 
and Fig S2). Mice receiving the IgEsig-prM-E LNPs with a boost had the strongest serum 
neutralizing response against ZIKV, with reciprocal dilution EC50 (half-maximal inhibition 
of virus infection) and EC90 values of up to 1/10,000 and 1/1,000, respectively. Mice 
receiving only a single immunization had lower neutralizing titers.
At 42 days after vaccination, AG129 mice were challenged with the ZIKV strain P6-740 
(Malaysia, 1966). As expected (Aliota et al., 2016), AG129 mice receiving the negative 
control LNP vaccine succumbed to ZIKV infection (Fig 1I). With the exception of a single 
animal, recipients of the 2 or 10 μg IgEsig-prM-E LNP vaccine with a boost as well as those 
receiving a single 10 μg dose all survived infection. In comparison, mice receiving a single 2 
μg dose of the vaccine displayed an intermediate phenotype with a 60% survival rate. Weight 
measurements correlated with lethality, as mice receiving the IgEsig-prM-E LNP vaccine 
were protected whereas the negative controls lost weight beginning at approximately day 10 
after challenge (Fig 1J).
Vaccine efficacy in C57BL/6 mice
To test the immunogenicity and efficacy of the IgEsig-prM-E LNP vaccine efficacy in an 
immunocompetent mouse strain, we inoculated via intramuscular injection 8 week-old male 
C57BL/6 WT mice with 10 μg of IgEsig-prM-E LNPs. These animals were phlebotomized 
prior to a single boost at day 28 (4 weeks) and before challenge at either day 56 (8 weeks) or 
day 126 (18 weeks). As expected, serum neutralization titers were relatively low prior to

 boosting; however, titers peaked at 4 weeks after boosting (EC50 of 1/10,000) and remained 
elevated 18 weeks post initial vaccination (Fig 2A–C and Fig S3). To create a lethal 
challenge model, we passively transferred 2 mg of a blocking anti-Ifnar1 antibody one day 
prior to infection with 106 focus-forming units (FFU) of a mouse-adapted African ZIKV 
strain (Dakar 41519) (Sapparapu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). All mice immunized with 
IgEsig-prM-E LNPs were protected against lethal ZIKV infection compared to the control 
group, which had a 30% survival rate (Fig 2D). Mice vaccinated with IgEsig-prM-E mRNA 
LNPs did not display any loss in weight (Fig 2E) nor had measurable viremia in serum at 5 
days after challenge (Fig 2F).
Modified vaccines lacking the immunodominant E-DII-FL epitope generate a protective 
anti-ZIKV response
The highly conserved FL epitope in DII of the flavivirus E protein is immunodominant in 
humans (Beltramello et al., 2010; Crill et al., 2007; Dejnirattisai et al., 2010; Oliphant et al., 
2007; Sapparapu et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016). As such, infection with ZIKV or 
vaccination with ZIKV structural proteins could induce cross-reactive antibodies, which 
might enhance DENV infection and disease through ADE (Morens, 1994; Stettler et al., 
2016). To minimize this possibility, we generated modified mRNA vaccines by engineering 
four mutations (T76R, Q77E, W101R, and L107R) in or near the E-DII-FL (prM-E-FL) that 
abolish antibody reactivity of FL-specific antibodies (Chabierski et al., 2014; Crill et al., 
2012; Oliphant et al., 2007). We also generated a separate series of mRNA LNPs by 
replacing the IgE leader sequence with one from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEVsig), a 
feature included in other flavivirus prM-E DNA vaccines to increase the efficiency of host 
signalase cleavage (Davis et al., 2001; Dowd et al., 2016b), and by further optimizing codon 
usage (Fig 3A). Western blotting analysis showed similar levels of SVP expression in HeLa 
cell supernatants after transfection of WT and FL mutant mRNA, and a loss of FL reactivity 
was confirmed for the prM-E-FL mRNA by an absence of binding of a mAb (WNV E60) 
that recognizes this epitope (Oliphant et al., 2006) (Fig 3B).
Immunocompetent 8 week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 μg or 10 μg of 
IgEsig-prM-E or JEVsig-prM-E (WT or FL mutant) LNPs and boosted with the same LNPs 4 
weeks later. At 8 weeks after initial vaccination, serum was analyzed for neutralizing activity 
using ZIKV reporter virus particles (RVPs) (Dowd et al., 2016a) (Fig 3 and Fig S4). Mice 
receiving 2 or 10 μg doses of the IgEsig-prM-E WT and FL mutant LNPs showed similar 
neutralization titers (Fig 3C), with EC50 values of ~1/5,000 (Fig 3E). The 2 and 10 μg dose 
of the WT JEVsig-prM-E LNPs induced stronger inhibitory responses with EC50 values of 
~1/100,000 (Fig 3D–E) and EC90 values of ~1/10,000 (Fig 3F). The mutant JEVsig-prM-E-
FL LNPs, however, induced antibody responses with lower EC50 and EC90 values, which 
still approached 1/10,000 and 1/500, respectively.
At ~13 weeks after initial vaccination, mice were challenged with ZIKV Dakar 41519 after 
pre-administration of anti-Ifnar1 blocking antibody. At day 3 after infection, serum was 
analyzed for viremia. Consistent with their high neutralizing titers, all mice immunized with 
2 or 10 μg doses of JEVsig-prM-E LNPs lacked measurable viremia (Fig 3G). All other 
vaccine groups (IgEsig-prM-E LNPs (WT or FL) or JEVsig-prM-E FL LNPs) had

 breakthrough viremia in some animals, although levels were 10 to 100-fold lower than 
observed with placebo LNPs. Mice were euthanized at day 7 after infection and spleen, 
uterus, and brain were analyzed for ZIKV RNA levels (Fig 3H–J). Most mice vaccinated 
with prM-E LNPs showed markedly reduced levels of viral RNA in the spleen (>100-fold) 
and virtually no detectable viral RNA in the uterus or brain, whereas the placebo immunized 
animals had mean levels of 105 to 106 FFU equivalents per gram of tissue. Mice vaccinated 
with the 2 μg dose of IgEsig-prM-E FL or JEVsig-prM-E FL LNPs showed slightly less 
protection, as viral RNA was detectable in some animals in the spleen and brain, albeit at 
much lower levels than those immunized with placebo LNPs.
To establish an immune correlate of complete protection against ZIKV in this model, we 
compared the EC50 values from all mRNA LNP vaccines with the levels of viral RNA 
recovered in the serum and spleen from individual mice. This analysis revealed an expected 
inverse relationship between neutralizing titers and levels of ZIKV RNA in serum and 
tissues, and defined a cut-off EC50 value of ~1/10,000 to completely prevent viremia and 
tissue dissemination (Fig 3K–L). We next evaluated whether the JEVsig-prM-E mRNA LNP 
vaccines, which protected almost completely against viremia or infection in tissues, 
conferred sterilizing immunity. The vast majority of animals (80 to 90%) receiving 2 or 10 
μg doses of the JEVsig-prM-E mRNA vaccines failed to boost neutralizing titers one week 
after challenge with infectious ZIKV, consistent with sterilizing immunity (Fig 3M). In 
comparison, most animals (82–100%) showing breakthrough viremia or tissue burden with 
the IgEsig-prM-E or JEVsig-prM-E FL mRNA vaccines sustained marked increases in EC50 
and EC90 values after challenge (Fig 3N), consistent with the induction of an anamnestic 
response.
Mutation of the DII-fusion loop epitope diminishes ADE in cells and mice
To evaluate whether the FL mutant vaccines diminished induction of cross-reactive 
enhancing antibodies, we incubated dilutions of serum obtained at 8 weeks after 
immunization with DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1) RVPs (Dowd et al., 2015) and assessed 
infection in K562 cells, which express the activating human Fc-γ receptor IIA (CD32A). 
Whereas sera from mice vaccinated with WT IgEsig-prM-E or JEVsig-prM-E mRNA LNPs 
all showed bell-shaped, canonical antibody enhancement curves, many of the sera from mice 
immunized with serum from IgEsig-prM-E-FL or JEVsig-prM-E-FL LNPs supported 
enhancement at only high concentrations and with considerably reduced efficiency (Fig 4A–
C and Fig S5). Indeed, the peak serum enhancement titer (PET (Boonnak et al., 2008)) was 
~100-fold lower in mice immunized with mutant forms of the fusion loop (Fig 4D). A 
similar reduction in enhancing power, or the fraction of infected cells at the PET was 
observed (Fig 4A, B, and E). Thus, introduction of mutations in the FL of ZIKV E reduced 
the production of enhancing antibodies against DENV, as judged by cell culture assays.
To determine the physiological significance of these results, we used an established passive 
transfer model of ADE for DENV in AG129 mice (Balsitis et al., 2010; Zellweger et al., 
2010) with serum from the IgEsig-prM-E and IgEsig-prM-E-FL or JEVsig-prM-E and JEVsig-
prM-E-FL vaccinated mice. We first evaluated the relative neutralizing activity of DENV-2 
of pooled ZIKV serum using an established RVP assay in Raji-DCSIGNR cells (Dowd et al., 
Richner et al.

 2015). Consistent with studies using FL-specific mAbs (Williams et al., 2013), the pooled 
sera from IgEsig-prM-E or or JEVsig-prM-E but not IgEsig-prM-E-FL or JEVsig-prM-E-FL 
vaccinated animals inhibited DENV-2 infection in cell culture (Fig 4F and Fig S6A), 
indicating a cross-reactive antibody (likely FL-specific) was produced only in mice receiving 
the WT but not FL mutant vaccines, and this antibody could neutralize infection in Raji-
DCSIGNR cells lacking activating Fc-γ receptors. We next transferred pooled sera to 
AG129 mice one day prior to challenge with a non-lethal dose of DENV-2. Whereas 
administration of 1 or 10 μl of serum from mice vaccinated with WT IgEsig-prM-E or 
JEVsig-prM-E LNPs or a positive control anti-prM mAb (2H2) resulted in uniformly lethal 
infection and severe disease due to antibody enhancement, transfer of equivalent amounts of 
sera from mice vaccinated with IgEsig-prM-E FL or JEVsig-prM-E-FL mutant LNPs resulted 
in significantly less morbidity and mortality (Fig 4G–H and Fig S6B).
DISCUSSION
As ZIKV emerges, the urgency for development and deployment of counter-measures to 
control infection increases (Marston et al., 2016). Here, we developed a ZIKV vaccine 
platform using modified mRNA encoding the prM-E proteins packaged into LNPs. 
Although mRNA-based vaccines were used recently to generate humoral responses against 
influenza A virus in mice (Hekele et al., 2013; Petsch et al., 2012) or HIV in non-human 
primates (Bogers et al., 2015), these platforms differed from ours in their use of self-
replicating RNA or protamine complexed mRNA. We selected LNPs for delivery of the 
modified mRNA as they have been validated in clinical trials for siRNA delivery and are 
well tolerated compared to other non-viral delivery systems (Coelho et al., 2013). In proof-
of-principle studies, we showed that LNP-delivered modified mRNA induced neutralizing 
antibodies that protected several strains (129 Sv, BALB/c, or C57BL/6) of susceptible mice 
with genetic or acquired deficiencies in IFN signaling against lethal ZIKV challenge. The 
neutralization titers induced by the IgEsig-prM-E mRNA LNPs were uniformly high (50% 
neutralization titer of ~1/10,000) in all three mouse models. The protective responses 
conferred by mRNA LNP vaccines were durable; even 14 weeks after boosting, challenged 
mice showed no morbidity or mortality. Furthermore, by further optimizing the prM signal 
sequence and codon usage (JEVsig-prM-E), we induced even more potent responses (EC50 
of ~1/100,000 and EC90 of 1/10,000) that resulted in sterilizing immunity in the majority of 
mice. The basis for the enhanced immunogenicity of the JEVsig-prM-E versus IgEsig-prM-E 
mRNA remains uncertain at this time.
While other candidate ZIKV vaccines have demonstrated protection in mice against ZIKV 
viremia with IgG titers of ~1/2,000 (Larocca et al., 2016), some of these studies used 
immunocompetent strains for challenge, which do not support as efficient ZIKV infection 
due to a species-specific lack of antagonism of IFN signaling (Grant et al., 2016; Kumar et 
al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016). Passive transfer and challenge studies in non-human primates 
with DNA plasmid or inactivated vaccines suggested that a neutralization titer of 1/100 
(measured by microneutralization assay) or 1/1,000 (measured by RVP assay) is required to 
prevent viremia in the majority of ZIKV-infected animals (Abbink et al., 2016; Dowd et al., 
2016b). However, no prior study assessed sterilizing immunity, as judged by the combined 
absence of virus in target tissues and lack of evidence of an anamnestic humoral response.

 For vaccine development, a key question remains as to correlates of vaccine protection in 
pregnancy, and whether sterilizing immunity will be required to prevent seeding of the 
placenta and fetal infection and injury. In anti-Ifnar1-treated susceptible mice, the level of 
neutralizing antibodies required for conferring sterilizing immunity was substantially higher 
(>100 to 1,000-fold) than required to reduce viral burden or confer survival protection. 
Vaccination studies in pregnant animals are planned to establish the correlate of immune 
protection that completely prevents maternal-fetal transmission.
Because of the versatility of the platform, we engineered additional mRNA LNP vaccines 
with mutations in the conserved E-DII-FL, which abolish reactivity of monoclonal and 
polyclonal antibodies targeting this region (Chabierski et al., 2014; Crill et al., 2012; Hughes 
et al., 2012; Vogt et al., 2011). The FL mutant mRNA vaccines induced neutralizing 
antibody responses in non-pregnant female BALB/c mice that protected against virus 
dissemination to the uterus and brain. Moreover, the FL mutant ZIKV vaccines induced 
serum antibody responses that resulted in less ADE of DENV-1 infection in cell culture and 
immune enhancement of DENV-2 infection in AG129 mice. Our results are analogous to a 
prior study with a DENV-1 DNA plasmid vaccine in which the FL epitope was altered by 
introducing G106R and L107D mutations (Crill et al., 2012); in that study, mice immunized 
with cross-reactivity-reduced monovalent DENV-1 DNA vaccines had diminished immune 
enhancement of DENV-2 infection in mice. Although our FL mutant mRNA LNP vaccines 
minimized ADE, we did observe a reduction in neutralizing titer (~7-fold decrease in EC50) 
for JEVsig-prM-E FL LNPs compared to the respective WT LNPs; however, no significant 
difference in neutralization was observed between IgEsig-prM-E WT and FL mutant 
vaccines. Although further studies are warranted, mRNA LNPs with FL mutations may 
induce lower neutralizing responses because (a) they produce SVPs that are less stable; (b) 
the absence of the FL results in a change in the display of neutralizing epitopes; or (c) the 
mutation of the FL in ZIKV SVPs prevents induction of neutralizing antibodies that bind 
epitopes proximal to the FL, as observed with EDE antibodies (Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016; 
Dejnirattisai et al., 2016). Thus, there is a trade-off for using the FL mutant LNPs; although 
cross-reactivity and ADE of DENV infection is reduced, neutralizing activity and the 
likelihood of conferring sterilizing immunity also are reduced. Second generation cross-
reactivity reduced constructs with a different array of mutations in conserved regions may 
prove even more immunogenic.
Our mRNA LNP ZIKV vaccine platform adds to a burgeoning pipeline that focuses on 
subunit-based or inactivated virion approaches. Three groups reported DNA plasmid 
vaccines encoding ZIKV M-E or prM-E genes that induced neutralizing antibodies in mice 
and non-human primates and protected against viremia or lethal virus challenge (Abbink et 
al., 2016; Dowd et al., 2016b; Larocca et al., 2016; Muthumani et al., 2016). A rhesus 
adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding ZIKV M-E genes induced neutralizing antibodies 
after a single dose in four rhesus macaques (Abbink et al., 2016). Immunization of BALB/c 
mice or rhesus macaques with an alum-adjuvanted chemically inactivated ZIKV vaccine 
induced neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity after two doses (Larocca et al., 2016) 
and protected against plasma viremia, or viral RNA in urine, cerebrospinal fluid, colorectal, 
and cervicovaginal secretions (Abbink et al., 2016). A human adenovirus vectored vaccine 
producing soluble E protein trimers induced neutralizing antibodies and protected one week-

 old mice from ZIKV challenge (Kim et al., 2016). Although all of these vaccine platforms 
show promise, none have been evaluated for induction of cross-reactive antibodies that in 
theory, could enhance DENV infection and disease. Nonetheless, it remains to be established 
whether the enhancement of DENV infection and disease, which can be demonstrated in 
vitro and in mice, becomes a clinically-relevant concern for ZIKV vaccines. In the absence 
of epidemiological proof, it may be difficult to justify the evaluation of cross-reactivity 
reduced variant vaccines in humans, in view of the decreased immunogenicity, especially 
when compared to the extraordinarily strong response generated with our WT JEVsig-prM-E 
construct. Nonetheless, the modified mRNA platform is well-positioned to respond rapidly 
to emerging epidemiology data.
In summary, we describe the generation of a ZIKV vaccine, utilizing modified mRNA 
encapsulated into LNPs that can be easily manipulated to optimize neutralization capacity 
and limit potentially undesired cross-reactivity. Our JEVsig-prM-E mRNA LNPs induced 
remarkable neutralizing titers that in most animals conferred sterilizing immunity. 
Consistent with our results, a recent study also reported the utility of LNP-encapsulated 
mRNA encoding the prM and E genes as a candidate vaccine for ZIKV infection (Pardi et 
al., 2017). The flexibility of this platform allows for the future inclusion of additional 
mRNA encoding other flavivirus proteins (e.g., NS1) that could augment protective 
responses (Costa et al., 2007; Costa et al., 2006) or immunodominant helper CD4 T cell 
epitopes (Hung et al., 2007). Future studies will be directed on evaluating the 
immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these mRNA vaccines in pregnant mice, non-
human primates, and ultimately, humans.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Ethics statement—This study was carried out in strict accordance with the 
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National 
Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (IACUC) at the Washington University School of Medicine (Assurance Number: 
A3381-01), the IACUC at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy & Immunology under protocol # 
AP028-SS1-0615, and the IACUC at Utah State University under protocol 2598. Dissections 
and footpad injections were performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained 
with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
Mouse experiments—BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson 
Laboratory, and AG129 mice were bred in the animal facilities at Utah State University, 
Washington University, or the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology. All mice were 
housed in pathogen-free mouse facilities. For immunizations, mice were inoculated via an 
intramuscular route with 50 μl of the indicated vaccine LNP constructs. For challenge

 studies, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 104 PFU of ZIKV P6-740 or 106 FFU of 
mouse-adapted ZIKV Dakar 41519 in 50 μl of HBSS + 0.1% FBS. For ZIKV challenge 
studies in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, 2 mg of anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody 
(MAR1-5A3 (Sheehan et al., 2006)) was administered via intraperitoneal injection 24 hours 
prior to viral infection. For DENV challenge studies in AG129 mice, animals were passively 
transferred pooled vaccine immune sera or PBS one day prior to infection with ~105 FFU of 
DENV-2 S221. Animals were monitored for mortality and clinical score (1 = heathy; 2 = 
slightly ruffled fur; 3 = very ruffled fur; 4 = mild lethargy, decreased scurrying activity; 5 = 
very sick, slow to no movement; 6 = very sick, euthanize (in distress); 7 = deceased) as 
described previously (Tang et al., 2016).
METHOD DETAILS
Viruses and cells—ZIKV strain Dakar 41519 (Senegal, 1984) and P6-740 (Malaysia, 
1966) were provided by the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses 
(R. Tesh and S. Weaver, University of Texas Medical Branch). To create a mouse-adapted 
more pathogenic variant of ZIKV Dakar 41519, it was passaged twice in Rag1−/− mice 
(Sapparapu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). ZIKV strain Paraiba 2015 (Brazil) was provided 
by S. Whitehead (NIH, Bethesda, MD) (Tsetsarkin et al., 2016). DENV-2 strain S221 is a 
mouse-adapted strain that has been described previously (Yauch et al., 2009). Virus stocks 
were propagated in mycoplasma-free Vero cells and titrated by focus-forming assay (FFA), 
as described previously (Lazear et al., 2016). Experiments with ZIKV and DENV were 
conducted under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) containment at Washington University School of 
Medicine or under BSL3 containment at Utah State University with Institutional Biosafety 
Committee approval.
Generation of modified mRNA and LNP—The mRNA was synthesized in vitro using 
T7 polymerase-mediated DNA-dependent RNA transcription where the UTP was substituted 
with 1-methylpseudoUTP, using a linearized DNA template, which incorporates 5′ and 3′ 
untranslated regions (UTRs) and includes a poly-A tail (5′-UTR: 
TCAAGCTTTTGGACCCTCGTACAGAAGCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAATAAGA
GAGAAAAGAAGAGTAAGAAGAAATATAAGAGCCACC; and 3′-UTR: 
TGATAATAGGCTGGAGCCTCGGTGGCCATGCTTCTTGCCCCTTGGGCCTCCCCCCA
GCCCCTCCTCCCCTTCCTGCACCCGTACCCCCGTGGTCTTTGAATAAAGTCTGAGT
GGGCGGC). A donor methyl group S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was added to the 
methylated capped RNA (cap 0), resulting in a cap 1 structure to increase mRNA translation 
efficiency. The modified mRNAs encoded the signal sequences from human IgE 
(MDWTWILFLVAAATRVHS) or JEV prM (MWLVSLAIVTACAGA) and the prM and E 
genes from an Asian ZIKV strain (Micronesia 2007, GenBank accession number EU545988 
(Lanciotti et al., 2008)), which is >99% identical to circulating American strains.
LNP formulations were prepared using a modified procedure of a method described for 
siRNA (Chen et al., 2016). Briefly, lipids were dissolved in ethanol at molar ratios of 
50:10:38.5:1.5 (ionizable lipid: DSPC: cholesterol: PEG-lipid). The lipid mixture was 
combined with a 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 4.0) containing mRNA at a ratio of 3:1 
(aqueous:ethanol) using a microfluidic mixer (Precision Nanosystems, Vancouver, BC).

 Formulations were dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4) in dialysis cassettes for at least 18 h. 
Formulations were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (EMD Millipore, 
Billerica, MA), passed through a 0.22-μm filter and stored at 4°C until use. All formulations 
were tested for particle size, RNA encapsulation, and endotoxin and were found to be 
between 80 to 100 nm in size, with greater than 90% encapsulation and <1 EU/ml of 
endotoxin.
Viral protein analysis—SVPs were floated on a 10–50% sucrose gradient (50 mM MES 
pH 5.5, 120 mM NaCl) and ultracentrifuged at 32,000 rpm at 4°C for 4 h in a Beckman 
SW55 rotor. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and pelleted by a second ultracentrifugation 
step over a 20% sucrose cushion at 32,000 rpm at 4°C for 2 h. P rotein concentration of 
SVPs was measured using a spectrophotometer (280 nm wavelength). Western blotting was 
performed using NuPAGE MES Western blot system (Thermo Fisher) reagents as per the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were boiled at 100°C for 10 min in the absence of 
reducing agent. Samples (100 or 500 ng total protein) were loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE 
gradient gel and electrophoresed. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes 
using iBlot 2 gel transfer system. Membranes were washed three times with deionized water 
and blocked in PBS with 5% Blotto (Thermo Fisher) overnight at 4°C. Primary mAbs 
(WNV E60 (Oliphant et al., 2006) or mouse anti-ZIKV E (Biofront, BF-1176-86)) were 
added at 1 μg/ml in PBS supplemented with 5% Blotto and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma) 
and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with agitation. Membranes were washed three 
times with PBS supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20. Secondary antibody (horseradish 
peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Ab97023, Abcam)) was added at 0.25 μg/ml in 
PBS supplemented with 5% Blotto and 0.2% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature with 
agitation. After final washing, blots were developed using Amersham ECL prime solution 
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 2 min and imaged. SeeBlue plus 2 pre-stained protein 
ladders were included for molecular weight references.
To compare expression of SVPs from different mRNA vaccine constructs, HeLa cells were 
transfected with 1.25 μg of mRNA constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher), 
and cells were harvested 24 h later. Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo 
Fisher) with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Millipore) added.
Electron microscopy of SVPs—The SVPs were imaged by electron microscopy and 
negative staining using a fee-for-service facility (University of California, Los Angeles). 
Briefly, purified SVPs (2.5 μl) were applied to a Glow-discharge carbon-coated grid (Ted 
Pella Inc.). Staining (2% uranyl acetate) was added in a drop-wise manner for 60 sec. After 
blotting of excess liquid and drying, the images were collected on a FEI Tecnai TF20 
transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV using TVIPS EM-
Menu program. The nominal magnifications used were 50,000, 29,000 and 14,500 with 2 
binning.
Measurement of viral burden—At specified time points after ZIKV challenge, blood 
was collected and organs were recovered. Organs were weighed and homogenized using a 
bead-beater apparatus (MagNA Lyser, Roche), and serum was prepared after coagulation 
and centrifugation. Tissue samples and serum from ZIKV-infected mice were extracted with

 the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). ZIKV RNA levels were determined by TaqMan one-step 
quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) on an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument using 
standard cycling conditions. Viral burden is expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA 
equivalents per gram or per milliliter after comparison with a standard curve produced using 
serial 5-fold dilutions of ZIKV RNA from known quantities of infectious virus. For ZIKV, 
the following primer sets were used: 1183F: 5′-
CCACCAATGTTCTCTTGCAGACATATTG-3′; 1268R: 5′-
TTCGGACAGCCGTTGTCCAACACAAG-3′; and probes (1213F): 5′-56-FAM/
AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAGTC/3IABkFQ-3′.
Neutralization assays—(a) PRNT or FRNT assays. Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated 
sera obtained from AG129 or C57BL/6 mice were incubated with 50 to 100 FFU of ZIKV 
(Paraiba, Brazil 2015) for 1 h at 37 °C. The serum Ab-virus complexes were added to Vero 
cell monolayers in 96-well plates for 60 min at 37°C. Pl aque assays were performed as 
described previously (Brien et al., 2013; Lazear et al., 2016) For FRNT assays, cells were 
overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented with 4% heat-inactivated 
FBS. Plates were fixed 40 h later with 1% PFA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The 
plates were incubated sequentially with 500 ng/ml of humanized anti-WNV E60 (Oliphant 
et al) and horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG in PBS supplemented 
with 0.1% (w/v) saponin (Sigma) and 0.1% BSA. ZIKV-infected cell foci were visualized 
using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and quantitated on an ImmunoSpot 5.0.37 
macroanalyzer (Cellular Technologies). (b) RVP assays. RVPs incorporating the structural 
proteins of ZIKV or DENV were produced by complementation of a previously described 
sub-genomic GFP-expressing replicon derived from a lineage II strain of WNV (Dowd et al., 
2016a; Dowd et al., 2015). Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera obtained from BALB/c 
mice were mixed with ZIKV (strain H/PF/2013; French Polynesia, 2013) or DENV-2 (strain 
16681) reporter viral particles (RVPs) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Immune complexes 
wer e added in duplicate technical replicates to pre-plated Vero cells in a 96-well plate and 
incubated for two days. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 4% PFA in PBS, and RVP 
infection scored as a function of GFP expression by flow cytometry. All neutralization data 
were analyzed by non-linear regression to determine the dilution of sera required to inhibit 
50% (EC50) and 90% (EC90) of infection. RVP studies were performed starting at an initial 
serum dilution of 1:100 (based on the final volume of cells, virus, and sera per well), which 
was designated as the limit of detection.
ADE assays—Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera obtained from BALB/c mice were 
mixed with DENV-1 RVPs (Western Pacific-74 strain) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. 
Immune complexes were added in duplicate technical replicates to K562 cells that express 
the Fc-γ receptor CD32A and incubated for two days. Due to limited volumes of sera, a 
small number of samples (four) could not be performed in duplicate. Cells were fixed with 
2% PFA, and RVP infection was scored as a function of GFP expression by flow cytometry. 
To normalize the magnitude of enhancement across independent experiments, results are 
displayed relative to the maximum infectivity observed with a control cross-reactive WNV 
mAb E60 (Oliphant et al., 2006) run in parallel. ADE studies were performed starting at an 
initial serum dilution of 1:60 (based on the final volume of cells, virus, and sera per well),

 which was designated as the limit of detection. For calculations of peak enhancing titer, 
samples for which no enhancement (infectivity) was observed are reported as a titer of 30 
(one half the limit of detection).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were 
analyzed by the log rank test, and weight losses were compared using two-way ANOVA. For 
neutralization antibody titers and viral burden analysis, the log titers and levels of viral RNA 
were analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis 2-way ANOVA with a multiple comparisons correction. 
A P value of < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences.

 Figure 1. ZIKV mRNA LNP vaccine testing in AG129 mice
A. ZIKV prM-E modified mRNA is packaged into LNPs for intramuscular delivery. B. 
Schematic of ZIKV genome (top). An mRNA encoding the ZIKV prM/M and E structural 
genes was engineered (bottom). In this construct, prM is directed into the ER using a 
heterologous IgE signal sequence (IgEsig) at the amino-terminus. C. HeLa cells were 
transfected with prM-E mRNA, and SVPs in the supernatant were purified and concentrated 
by ultracentrifugation and then subjected to electron microscopy and negative staining. Low- 
and high-power images of purified SVPs are shown. Scale bar = 30 nm. One representative

 Figure 2. ZIKV mRNA LNP vaccine protects C57BL/6 mice
WT C57BL/6 mice (n = 10, pooled from two independent experiments) were immunized 
with 10 μg of placebo or IgEsig prM-E mRNA LNPs and boosted with an equivalent dose 
four weeks later. A. Serum was collected at 4, 8, and 18 weeks post initial vaccination and 
analyzed for ZIKV neutralization activity by FRNT assay. Representative neutralization 
curves are shown for each group. Error bars denote the standard deviation (SD) of triplicate 
technical replicates. B–C. EC50 (B) and EC90 (C) values were calculated for individual 
animals in each group. The dashed lines indicate the limit of detection of the assay. Data 
were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test and compared to the placebo LNP vaccine at 
each time point (**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; n.s. indicates not significant). D–F. At week 8 
or 18, vaccinated C57BL/6 mice were administered 2 mg of anti-Ifnar1 blocking antibody 
and one day later challenged with 105 FFU of mouse adapted ZIKV Dakar 41519. Animals 
were monitored for survival (D) and weight loss (E). At day 5 after viral challenge, serum 
was analyzed for levels of ZIKV RNA (F). The dashed line indicates the limit of detection 
of the assay. Survival data was analyzed by the log rank test (***, P < 0.001). Weight loss 
was analyzed by two-way ANOVA (***, P < 0.001) for surviving animals; arrows indicate

type-specific anti-ZIKV E antibody (left panel) or a cross-reactive anti-ZIKV E antibody 
that binds the FL (right panel). Results are the representative of two independent 
experiments. E, monomer; E2, dimer. C–F. At week 8, serum was harvested from IgEsig-prM 
E (C) or JEVsig prM-E (D) mRNA LNP vaccinated mice and analyzed for neutralization 
capacity using ZIKV RVPs. Representative curves for each group (with EC50 values at or 
near the group median) are shown in (C) and (D). Error bars indicate the range of duplicate 
technical replicates. EC50 (E) and EC90 (F) values were calculated for individual animals in 
each group. Each point represents the results from a single experiment or the mean of two 
independent experiments. The dotted line indicates the limit of detection of the assay. G–J. 
At week 8, vaccinated BALB/c mice were administered 2 mg of anti-Ifnar1 blocking 
antibody and one day later challenged with 105 FFU of mouse adapted ZIKV Dakar 41519. 
At 3 (G) and 7 (H–J) days after viral challenge, serum (G), uterus (H), spleen (I), and brain 
(J) tissues were harvested and analyzed for ZIKV RNA. EC50, EC90, and viral titer data 
were analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis test with a multiple comparisons correction and 
compared to the placebo LNP vaccine (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 
0.0001; n.s., not significant). K–L. Correlates of day 3 viral load (K, left panel), day 7 
spleen titers (L, left panel) and protective efficacy (K–L, right panels) are shown. Data from 
all JEVsig-prM-E and IgEsig-prM-E mRNA LNP vaccines was included in this analysis. P 
values and R2 values reflect Spearman rank-correlation tests. For correlate data, values at 
which the line would cross the limit of detection of the y-axis are indicated below the 
graphs. Red line represents the best fit linear regression. For protective efficacy data, bars 
indicate median values (****, P < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney test). M–N. Anamnestic 
neutralizing antibody response. Paired sera were collected from vaccinated animals (JEVsig-
prM-E (M) or IgEsig-prM-E and JEVsig-prM-E FL (N)) immediately before (Pre) or 7 days 
after (Post) ZIKV challenge and analyzed for neutralizing activity using ZIKV RVPs. EC50 
and EC90 values were analyzed for differences by a paired t-test (n.s., not significant; *, P < 
0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001). Indicated at the bottom of the graphs are the number of 
animals showing a 4-fold increase in neutralization titer (positive anamnestic response) at 7 
days after ZIKV challenge. See also related figure S4.
