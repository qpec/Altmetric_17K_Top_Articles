ABSTRACT
Both HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk.
Because the relative contributions of ART and untreated HIV to BMD loss are unclear, it is important to quantify the effect of ART on
bone. We compared the effect of early ART initiation (CD4 >500 cells/mL) with deferred ART on change in BMD in the START Bone
Mineral Density substudy, a randomized trial evaluating the effect of immediate ART initiation versus deferring ART (to CD4 <350
cells/mL). BMD was measured annually at the lumbar spine and hip by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Percent change in
BMD by treatment assignment (intent-to-treat analysis) was estimated using longitudinal mixed models and linear regression.
Baseline and follow-up DXA scans were available for 399 (195 immediate, 204 deferred) participants (median age 32 years, 80% non-
white, 26% women, median CD4 count 642 cells/mL). ART (most commonly including tenofovir and efavirenz) was used for 95% and
18% of follow-up in the immediate and deferred ART groups, respectively. Through 2.2 years mean follow-up, immediate ART
resulted in greater BMD declines than deferred ART at the hip (–2.5% versus –1.0%; difference –1.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]
–2.2 to –0.8, p < 0.001) and spine (–1.9% versus –0.4%; difference –1.6%, 95% CI –2.2 to –1.0, p < 0.001). BMD declines were greatest
in the first year of ART. In the immediate ART group, spine BMD stabilized after year 1, whereas hip BMD declined progressively over
2 years. After year 1, BMD changes were similar in the immediate and deferred groups. No clinical, HIV-related, or ART characteristic
predicted greater BMD loss in either group. All HIV treatment guidelines now recommend ART initiation at HIV diagnosis because of
the reduced risk of serious clinical outcomes. Better understanding of the longer-term consequences of the observed reductions in
BMD is needed. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT00867048. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

 Introduction
L
ow bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis, and fractures
are more common in HIV-infected adults than in HIV-
negative controls.(1,2) Uncontrolled studies have found that
initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is followed by a 2% to
6% reduction in BMD, mainly over the first 1 to 2 years. Most
studies report stabilization thereafter, although follow-up was
generally less than 3 years.(1,3) Antiretroviral guidelines now
recommend immediate ART initiation regardless of CD4 count,
in large part because of the results of the INSIGHT Strategic
Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) trial, which reported a
57% reduction in serious AIDS and non-AIDS–related morbidity
and mortality.(4,5)
Bone loss in HIV-infected adults is multifactorial. Greater bone
loss has been reported with use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(TDF) and ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) in the ART
regimen.(3,6) However, some bone loss occurs with all ART,(7)
probably because of increased bone catabolism after suppres-
sion of HIV viral load and immune reconstitution.(8,9) Untreated
HIV is also associated with lower BMD, possibly because of
greater prevalence of conventional risk factors or because of HIV
infection of osteoblasts or increased bone metabolism.(10,11)
Cross-sectional studies, however, have not reported consistent
relationships between BMD and duration of HIV infection, viral
load, or CD4 count.(12,13)
The relative contributions of ART and untreated HIV infection
to BMD loss are unclear, and it is important to quantify the bone
effects of ART to fully determine its risk-benefit profile. There are
no prospective, randomized trial data describing the effect
of ART versus no ART on bone. We report the results of the
Bone Mineral Density substudy of START, a randomized trial
comparing the effects of immediate versus deferred ART on hip
and spine BMD. We hypothesized that immediate ART would
result in greater BMD loss than deferred ART.
Materials and Methods
Study design and participants
The START study randomized 4685 HIV-positive, ART-na€
ıve adults
with high CD4 counts (>500 cells/mL) to one of two strategies of
Fig. 1. Study design, CONSORT diagram, and participant disposition at each follow-up visit. Of the 399 participants included in the primary analysis, 349
(87.5%) had year 2 BMD data and 110 (27.6%) had year 3 data. For 284 of the 289 participants without year 3 data, the year 3 visit was due after the
common censoring date, May 26, 2015.

GREATER BMD LOSS WITH IMMEDIATE VERSUS DEFERRED ART

 ART initiation, either immediate ART initiation or deferred ART
(initiation when CD4 count fell below 350 cells/mL or HIV disease
progression).(14) ART regimens were not protocol-specified, but
the initial regimen was selected by investigators pre-randomiza-
tion. At 33 clinical sites in 11 countries, all eligible START
participants were offered BMD substudy co-enrollment. Eligibility
criteria were broad and excluded only those receiving treatment
for low BMD (calcium, vitamin D, and hormone-replacement
therapy were permitted) or for whom valid BMD scans could not
be obtained. The substudy was approved by the institutional
review board at eachparticipating clinical site and was performed
in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and local regulatory requirements. All participants provided
written, informed consent before enrollment.
BMD at the hip and lumbar spine (L1 to L4) was measured at
baseline (within 120 days before randomization) and annually
by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Each of the 16
radiology centers used either a Hologic (Hologic Inc., Bedford,
MA, USA; n ¼ 290 participants) or GE Lunar (GE Healthcare,
Madison, WI, USA; n ¼ 134) scanner. All DXA images were
obtained using a standardized protocol and read centrally at the
study’s DXA quality assurance (QA) center (University of
California, San Francisco, CA, USA). Procedures to ensure quality
and standardization of BMD measurements have been de-
scribed.(15) In brief, equipment and radiology technicians at each
radiology center were certified by the DXA QA center; the quality
of each scan submitted was evaluated immediately at the QA
center, and unacceptable scans were repeated. All scans were
standardized for longitudinal and cross-sectional consistency by
the DXA QA center, using two types of phantom scans: 1)
phantoms provided by the DXA equipment manufacturers were
scanned before each participant scan and at least 3 times a
week; 2) a set of three cross-calibration phantoms were scanned
at each radiology center. BMD measures obtained on GE Lunar
equipment were standardized to Hologic measures using
validated linear transformation equations.(16,17) T-scores and
Z-scores were calculated from longitudinally and cross-section-
ally adjusted BMD readings. T-scores were calculated relative to
peak bone mass in young white women.(18) Z-scores were
calculated relative to US reference populations matched by age,
sex, and race/ethnicity.(19) Low BMD (below the expected range
for age) was defined by a BMD Z-score (spine, hip, femoral
neck) � –2, consistent with recommendations for young pop-
ulations by the US National Osteoporosis Foundation and the
International Society for Clinical Densitometry.(20,21) WHO
classifies BMD T-scores � –2.5 as osteoporosis.(22)

 Fractures and osteoporosis treatment were recorded at
baseline and annually for all START participants. Use of vitamin
D and calcium supplements was recorded at baseline and
annually in the BMD substudy participants.
Study outcomes
The co-primary outcomes were changes from baseline in total
hip BMD and lumbar spine BMD. The primary objective was to
compare changes in hip and spine BMD through follow-up
between the immediate and deferred ART groups by intent-to-
treat. Prespecified secondary objectives included change in
femoral neck BMD, incidence of osteoporosis or low BMD, rates
of BMD loss upon ART initiation in the immediate ART group and
among participants in the deferred group before ART start
(untreated HIV), and evaluation of clinical parameters associated
with rates of BMD change.
Statistical analyses
The sample size of 400 participants was estimated to detect
between-group differences of 1.0% and 1.2% in mean percent
change in total hip and spine BMD, respectively, from baseline
through follow-up, with 80% power at a 5% significance level,
assuming standard deviations of 3.8% and 4.8%, respectively.(3,23)
All changes in BMD from baseline were expressed as percent
of baseline BMD. Follow-up was censored at each participant’s
last DXA scan before May 27, 2015 (when the Data and Safety
Monitoring Board recommended all START participants be
offered ART).(14) Unless noted otherwise, all treatment group
comparisons were by intent-to-treat. The primary analysis was
the intent-to-treat comparison between the immediate and
deferred ART groups for percent change in BMD using
longitudinal mixed models, adjusted for baseline BMD and
visit. Groups were compared for changes in BMD to each year of
follow-up using ANCOVA models adjusted for baseline BMD.
Rates of BMD change were estimated within each group using
unadjusted, longitudinal mixed models with the subject-specific
annual percent change in BMD as response variable; to compare
the groups, models were adjusted for baseline BMD and visit.
The groups were compared for incidence of low BMD and T-
scores � –2.5 using unadjusted Cox regression models. To assess
the effect of ART versus strictly untreated HIV, we compared the
immediate group (excluding participants who did not start ART
within the first year) versus the deferred group censored at ART
start. Subgroup analyses for the co-primary outcomes were
performed to determine whether the treatment effect differed
across baseline characteristics; we considered only subgroups
that included at least 20 participants pooled across the two

Follow-up was censored at the start of osteoporosis therapy for 2 participants (both in the deferred group, month 24). Mean changes in BMD from
baseline to each year were calculated without adjustments, differences at each year were estimated in regression models adjusted for baseline BMD, and
overall changes in BMD were estimated and compared using longitudinal mixed models adjusted for both baseline BMD and visit. Rates of changes in
spine BMD after year 1 were estimated in longitudinal mixed models using annual BMD changes as response.

 treatment arms. Homogeneity of treatment effect was assessed
by testing for interaction between the subgroup variable and
treatment group indicator in longitudinal mixed models
adjusted for baseline BMD and visit. Associations of baseline
factors with changes in BMD after ART initiation in the
immediate ART group were estimated in longitudinal mixed
models. To evaluate the effect of time-updated ART use, the
annual percent change in BMD was used as response in
longitudinal mixed models, and the subject-specific proportion
of follow-up time that specific drugs (or any ART) were used
during each year were included as time-updated predictors in
the models, along with baseline predictors.
Fracture incidence rates were estimated in the parent START
population, and groups were compared using a Cox propor-
tional hazards model. Analyses were performed with SAS version
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R version 3.(24)
Results
Participant characteristics
The BMD substudy co-enrolled 424 START participants between
June 2011 and June 2013. Baseline characteristics of the
substudy population have been reported;(15) 25 participants
(5.9%) did not have analyzable baseline or follow-up scans and
were excluded from analysis (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the baseline
characteristics of the 399 analyzed participants (195 in the
immediate group, 204 in the deferred ART groups). The racially
diverse population had a median age of 32 years; 26.1% were
women; median time since HIV diagnosis was 0.7 years. Forty-
five participants (11.3%) had low BMD relative to their age group
(Z-score � –2) at the spine, total hip, or femoral neck.
Participants were followed for a mean of 2.2 years. In the
immediate group, 95% of participants started ART within 8 weeks
of randomization. In the deferred group, 14.7%, 27.9%, and 44.6%
had started ART by months 12, 24, and 36, respectively. ART was
used for 95% and 18% of cumulative follow-up in the immediate
and deferred ART groups, respectively. In the immediate ART
group, initial ART contained TDF for 82.8% of participants,
efavirenz (EFV) for 78.1%, and a PI for 13.0%. No tenofovir
alafenamide was used. Almost all participants on ART had plasma
HIV viral load �200 copies/mL.(14) Two deferred arm participants
commenced treatment for osteoporosis after month 12.

total hip BMD are estimated within subgroups, with 95% confidence intervals. The p values are for tests of heterogeneity of the treatment difference
across subgroups. �Estimated in a longitudinal mixed model, adjusted for visit and baseline BMD. The interaction p value for heterogeneity across
subgroups was calculated using continuous variables for age, BMI, time since HIV diagnosis, CD4 count, and log10 HIV RNA levels. ��In the immediate ART
group, a tenofovir-containing ART regimen was selected before randomization (“prespecified”) for 162 participants. Of those who were prespecified
tenofovir and had the corresponding follow-up scans, 155 (96.3%), 138 (97.2%), and 45 (97.8%) used tenofovir at years 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

 differences were: –1.9% versus –0.4% (difference –1.6% [95% CI
–2.2 to –1.0]) at the lumbar spine; –2.5% versus –1.0% (difference
–1.5% [95% CI –2.2 to –0.8]) at the total hip; and –3.0% versus
–1.4% (difference –1.7% [95% CI –2.6 to –0.8]) at the femoral
neck (Fig. 2A–C, Table 2; all p < 0.001). Treatment groups differed
significantly in BMD decline from baseline to months 12, 24, and
36 for spine and total hip BMD. In the deferred ART group, when
censoring follow-up at ART initiation, BMD changed by 0.1%,
–0.3%, and –0.6% per year at the spine, hip, and femoral neck,
respectively (Fig. 2D–F, Supplemental Table S1). The differences
between the immediate versus deferred groups were evident at
year 1 and remained about constant afterwards. Rates of BMD
decline were steeper in the immediate ART group at all 3 skeletal
sites. In the immediate ART group, spine BMD declined sharply
during the first year (by 2.0%) and remained stable afterward. At
the total hip and femoral neck, BMD declined during year 1 by
2.0% and 2.5%, respectively, and from year 1 to year 2 by 1.0%
and 1.0%, respectively (Table 2, Fig. 2B, C, Supplemental
Table S1). The apparent continued decline in hip BMD after
year 2 in Fig. 2 is due to a cohort effect; hip BMD remains about
constant after year 2 when restricting the analysis to participants
with 3 years of follow-up (Table 2, Supplemental Fig. S1B, C).
After year 1, rates of BMD decline were similar in the immediate
and deferred ART groups (Table 2).
In all subgroups, spine and hip BMD declined more in the
immediate ART group (Fig. 3). In addition to the subgroups
shown in Fig. 3, subgroups were analyzed by baseline BMD,
season of enrollment, mode of HIV infection, CD8 count, CD4:
CD8 ratio, calcium or vitamin D supplements, recreational drug
use, eGFR, and prespecified PI use. Treatment differences were
homogenous across all subgroups, except for 2 cases. For spine
BMD, the treatment effect was stronger among those with
higher baseline CD4 count (p ¼ 0.04). For hip BMD, the
treatment effect was stronger in those diagnosed with HIV
more than 1 year earlier (p ¼ 0.003). Notably, there was no
evidence for larger differences between the immediate and
deferred ART groups in the TDF or PI subgroups; however, power
to detect heterogeneity across TDF and PI subgroups was low
because of the low sample size in the non-TDF and the PI
subgroup categories. Results were similar when restricting
follow-up to the first 2 years, except that there was no evidence
for a differential treatment effect by baseline CD4 counts
(Supplemental Fig. S2).

No clinical, demographic, or HIV-related factor was consistently
associated with BMD change across both spine and hip in either

 treatment group (Table 3). In the immediate ART group, being
Asian (Table 3), and using PIs in the initial regimen (Table 4) was
associated with steeper BMD decline at the spine. At the hip, TDF
use was associated with steeper BMD decline (Table 4) and
recreational drug use with less decline (Table 3). In a time-
updated analysis, no single drug nor drug class was associated
with steeper BMD declines (Supplemental Table S2).
In the deferred ART group, only low baseline CD4 cell counts
were independently associated with steeper spine BMD decline,
by –0.34% per 100 cells/mL lower (Table 5). At the femoral neck,
lower baseline body mass index (BMI), calcium and vitamin D
use, and higher baseline BMD were independently associated
with steeper BMD loss (Table 5).
Incidence of low BMD and fractures
Among participants without low BMD at baseline (Z-score > –2),
22 participants in the immediate ART group developed low BMD
at the spine, hip, or femoral neck (Z-score � –2) (rate 6.2 per 100
person-years) compared with 6 (rate 1.4 per 100 person-years) in
the deferred ART group, hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 4.7 (95% CI 1.9 to
11.7, p < 0.001). For 4 participants (rate 1.0 per 100 person-years)
in the immediate ART group, the T-score at the spine, hip, or
femoral neck newly declined to � –2.5 compared with 6 (rate 1.3
per 100 person-years) in the deferred group, HR ¼ 0.78 (95% CI
0.22 to 2.76, p ¼ 0.70).
Rates of fracture and of fragility fracture were similar between
groups in the parent START population. In the immediate ART
group, 66 participants (rate of 0.92 per 100 person-years)
experienced a new fracture compared with 61 (rate 0.83) in the
deferred group, HR¼ 1.09 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.55, p¼ 0.62). Of these,
17and27fracturesoccurredwithminimaltraumaintheimmediate
and deferred groups, respectively, at rates of 0.23 and 0.37 per 100
person-years, HR¼ 0.63 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.16, p¼ 0.14).
Discussion
In this diverse population of adults with HIV infection and near-
normal CD4 counts, immediate initiation of ART resulted in
significantly greater reductions in BMD at the spine and total hip
compared with deferred ART. During the first year, participants
in the immediate ART group lost 2.0% of BMD at the lumbar
spine and total hip. This 2.0% BMD decline is less than that
reported in earlier studies of ART initiation (2% to 6% over 2
years)(3,25) but similar to recent studies (0.9% to 3.7% declines in
BMD over 1 to 2 years).(26–29) The 2% loss of BMD is similar to the
BMD loss found with administration of oral glucocorticoids
(0.8% to 3.0%);(30) a BMD loss of 0.5% to 0.7% is associated with a
fracture risk 1.5- to 2.4-fold greater than in non-glucocorticoid
users.(31) Whether similar BMD declines in ART-treated HIV-
infected patients will translate into increased risk of fractures is
unknown.
After the first 12 months of ART, BMD remained stable at the
spine but continued to decline through the second year at the
hip, albeit at a lower rate (by 0.9%). In the deferred ART group,
spine BMD remained stable, whereas hip BMD declined at a rate
of 0.3% and 0.6% at the femoral neck before initiation of ART. In
the general population, the annual decline in BMD at the hip and
the lumbar spine for premenopausal women and men less than
50 years is 0.15% to 0.4%.(19,32) Our study population had a
median age of 32 years, so stability of spine BMD is to be
expected. With no ART, the annual 0.3% to 0.6% BMD decline at
the hip suggests a role for untreated HIV. However, the
magnitude of the overall steeper BMD decline in the immediate
versus deferred ART group suggests that ART is a greater
contributor to BMD loss than HIV itself.
The difference in percent change in BMD from baseline
between those who started ART in the immediate group and
the deferred group before ART start developed in year 1, and
remained about constant thereafter, as participants in the
deferred ART group gradually initiated ART. At the spine, the
BMD loss was largely restricted to the first year of ART. At the hip,
BMD continued to decline through the second year of ART use
(see Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. S1, immediate ART group).
Whether ART use causes ongoing BMD loss beyond the first year
or two is uncertain, however. Stabilization of BMD after the first
2 years of ART has been demonstrated in clinical trials (usually
less than 3 years’ duration) and several cohort studies.(33,34) In
other studies, BMD continues to decline beyond the first year of
ART by approximately 1% per year.(23,25,35) We have previously
observed ongoing BMD decline with ART in the SMART study,
where hip BMD declined by 0.8% per year for up to 4 years of
follow-up in participants who were ART-experienced at study
entry, and continued using ART.(23,36) Continued decline in BMD
has been confirmed by others, where the rate of BMD decline
was steeper during the 2 years after ART initiation compared
with HIV-negative people of similar age; although the rate of
BMD loss slowed after 2 years, spine BMD loss remained
significantly greater compared with the HIV-negative group
through 7.5 years of follow-up.(37) Switching ART for virological

 failure has also been shown to be associated with another
significant fall in BMD of 2% before stabilization again.(38) Given
that ART use is lifelong in those with HIV, continued decline of
BMD at rates greater than those observed in the general
population, if that should be the case, may result in adverse
outcomes in the aging HIV population.
There was no difference in fracture rates between immediate
and deferred ART groups in the 4684 participants in the parent
START study. Whether ART increases fracture risk is unclear, with
contradictory results reported from multiple studies. The effect
of ART is likely small in women under the age of 50 years and
men under 60 years.(39) The young age of our study population
may have contributed to the low rate of fractures and lack of
treatment group difference.(14)
There was no independent association between baseline CD4
count and change in BMD in the immediate ART group. In
contrast, lower CD4 count was a significant predictor of greater
BMD loss at both the spine and the hip in the deferred ART group
(before any ART). A lower CD4 count and higher HIV viral load
have been associated with lower bone mass in cross-sectional
studies, suggesting a role for HIV infection or the immunological
response to HIV in bone loss.(7,40) Lower pre-ART CD4 counts
were associated with greater bone loss after ART initiation in
combined ACTG studies but only in those with CD4 counts
<50 cells/mL.(8) The observed effect of ART was consistent across
demographic, HIV-related, and traditional risk factors for BMD
loss. Greater bone loss at the spine after ART initiation in Asians
compared with white race participants has not been described
previously, and this observation may be spurious. Most studies
evaluating change in BMD after ART report greater bone loss
with TDF and/or ritonavir-boosted PI-containing ART.(3,27–29) In
START, ART type was not mandated, and most participants
received TDF and EFV. Although we found that TDF use was
associated with greater loss of BMD at the hip and PI use was
associated with greater BMD decline at the spine, our study was
underpowered to separate the effects of TDF from those of other
ART drugs.
The main strengths of our study are the randomized design,
the racially diverse study population, and the standardized
acquisition and reading of the DXA scans. There are several
limitations. First, follow-up is only 2 years for most participants.
Longer follow-up of our participants is needed to clarify whether
the early BMD loss with ART is sustained over time. Second, only
26% of participants were women, resulting in low power for
detecting sex differences. Third, the study was not designed to
identify effects of specific drugs. Fourth, our study was not
powered to detect a moderate increase of fracture risk because
expected fracture rates would be very low in this young
population. Finally, some of the factors identified as associated
with change in BMD may be false positives; because of the high
number of predictors, our results need to be interpreted with
caution. If the 16 predictors were independent, the chance of

 observing one or more p values �0.05 would be at least 56% for
each of the BMD outcomes.
In summary, immediate initiation of ART at high CD4 cell
counts compared with deferring ART results in accelerated bone
loss at the spine and hip, which may stabilize after a year or two.
All key ART guidelines now recommend ART initiation at HIV
diagnosis regardless of CD4 cell count because of the reduced
risk of serious clinical outcomes relative to deferring ART.
Although the START Bone Mineral Density substudy revealed an
adverse effect of immediate ART, the overall benefits of ART for
prevention of HIV transmission and adverse health outcomes
prevail. It will be important to understand the longer-term
consequences of the observed reductions in BMD and whether
these reductions continue or stabilize with longer therapy.
