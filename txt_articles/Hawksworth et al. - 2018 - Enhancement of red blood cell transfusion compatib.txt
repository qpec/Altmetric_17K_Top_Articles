Abstract
Regular blood transfusion is the cornerstone of care for patients
with red blood cell (RBC) disorders such as thalassaemia or sickle-
cell disease. With repeated transfusion, alloimmunisation often
occurs due to incompatibility at the level of minor blood group
antigens. We use CRISPR-mediated genome editing of an immor-
talised human erythroblast cell line (BEL-A) to generate multiple
enucleation competent cell lines deficient in individual blood
groups. Edits are combined to generate a single cell line deficient
in multiple antigens responsible for the most common transfusion
incompatibilities: ABO (Bombay phenotype), Rh (Rhnull), Kell (K0),
Duffy (Fynull), GPB (S�s�U�). These cells can be differentiated to
generate deformable reticulocytes, illustrating the capacity for
coexistence of multiple rare blood group antigen null phenotypes.
This study provides the first proof-of-principle demonstration of
combinatorial CRISPR-mediated blood group gene editing to gener-
ate customisable or multi-compatible RBCs for diagnostic reagents
or recipients with complicated matching requirements.

Introduction
The collection of more than 1.5 million units of blood is required
each year to meet the transfusion needs of England alone (MHRA,
2016). For the majority of patients, this need is serviced by the
blood donation system which provides hospitals with screened
donor blood that is matched for the major blood group antigens: A,
B, O and RhD. Donors who are blood group O RhD negative are
often described as “universal donors”; however, this popular simpli-
fication misrepresents the complexity of RBC surface antigens that
influence
donor–recipient
compatibility
with
36
blood
group
systems and more than 350 different antigens recognised by the
International Society of Blood Transfusion (http://www.isbtweb.
org/working-parties/red-cell-immunogenetics-and-blood-group-term
inology/). Mismatch of any blood group antigen has the potential to
cause alloimmunisation (generation of antibodies to non-self RBC
antigens). Across all transfusion recipients, this occurs in approxi-
mately 2–5% of cases; however, in chronically transfused sickle-cell
disease (SCD) patients, RBC alloimmunisation occurs in approxi-
mately 30% of cases (Campbell-Lee & Kittles, 2014). Common
alloantibodies generated in chronically transfused patients with SCD
include those to the C and E antigens of the Rh blood group system
(RH), K in the Kell system (KEL), Fya and Fy3 in the Duffy system
(FY), Jkb in the Kidd system (JK), and U and S in the MNS blood
group system (Rosse et al, 1990; Aygun et al, 2002; Castro et al,
2002). Such incompatibilities often result from the differing preva-
lence of antigens between SCD recipients of African descent
compared to a predominately Caucasian donor base.
Whilst
alloimmunisation
of
chronically
transfused
patients
increases the difficulty in obtaining suitably matched donations,
individuals exist with non-pathological but particularly rare natu-
rally occurring blood group phenotypes that also present major chal-
lenges for blood transfusion services across the world to match.
Examples include individuals with the rare Bombay phenotype [one
in 250,000 of the population worldwide (Mallick et al, 2015) and

 one in 1,000,000 in Europe (Oriol et al, 2000)] who lack the H anti-
gen—the antigenic determinant of blood group O and the precursor
of the A and B antigens—and those who are Rhnull [one in every
6,000,000 (Avent & Reid, 2000)] who lack all antigens encoded by
both the RHD and RHCE genes. In these, and other rare cases, trans-
fusion with only ABO RhD matched blood will result in adverse
effects and therefore donations are required from an individual with
the same rare phenotype.
Current efforts to cater for individuals with rare blood types rely
on international coordination of rare donor databases and the cryo-
preservation of donor units including those stored for autologous
transfusion
(Anstee
et al,
1999;
Nance,
2009;
Nance
et al,
2016).The ability to generate RBCs with bespoke phenotypes for
individuals with rare blood types together with a “more universal”
source of RBCs designed to minimise alloimmunisation in SCD
patients and to meet the transfusion needs of existing patients for
whom alloimmunisation has reduced the suitable donor pool would
have obvious clinical benefits.
The desire to improve RBC compatibility for transfusion is not a
new concept. Whilst the successful conversion of blood group types
A and B to O has been demonstrated using glycosidases (Zhu et al,
1996; Kruskall et al, 2000; Liu et al, 2007), attempts to more
broadly enhance compatibility through antigen masking achieved
only limited success (Jeong & Byun, 1996; Armstrong et al, 1997;
Scott et al, 1997). More recently, developments in the in vitro
culture of erythroid cells have facilitated the laboratory proof-of-
principle production of RBCs with severe depletion in the expression
of other blood groups using lentiviral expression of shRNAs in
haematopoietic stem cells (Bagnis et al, 2009; Cambot et al, 2013).
In some cases, these modified cells present the properties of their
equivalent null phenotypes as assessed by routine diagnostic
haemagglutination tests (Bagnis et al, 2009; Cambot et al, 2013)
although remaining residual antigens resulting from incomplete
knockdown may still result in alloantibody formation in vivo. An
additional obstacle to the use of adult haematopoietic stem cells for
the culture of modified RBCs is presented by the finite proliferative
capacity of such cells, which currently limits the yield of cultured
RBCs
to
sub-transfusable
quantities
and
the
requirement
for
repeated
shRNA
transduction
between
cultures.
Alternative
approaches which have focused on the derivation of RBCs from
more sustainable induced pluripotent stem cells created from exist-
ing donors with rare or more universally acceptable RBC pheno-
types such as Bombay have been confounded by poor levels of
erythroid cell expansion and aberrant or incomplete differentiation
(Seifinejad et al, 2010). The generation of immortalised erythroid
cell lines provides potential for an unlimited supply of red cells.
Gene editing technologies can be utilised in these lines to make
modifications which improve transfusion compatibility without the
need for repeated editing of haematopoietic stem cells (Kim et al,
2015).
In this study, we use CRISPR-mediated genome editing of a
recently developed immortalised human erythroblast cell line BEL-A
(Trakarnsanga et al, 2017) to generate stable erythroblast cell lines
that can be differentiated to generate functional reticulocytes
completely deficient in a variety of individual transfusion-relevant
blood groups. By simultaneously expressing multiple guide RNAs
(gRNAs) in these cells, we demonstrate the ability to delete multiple
blood group genes in erythroblasts and present proof-of-principle
generation of red blood cells completely deficient in blood groups
encoded by five different genes that encode antigens responsible for
the most common transfusion incompatibilities.
Results
Target antigen selection
In order to direct the design of a bespoke or customised RBC pheno-
type that would be able to service existing unmet clinical transfu-
sion
needs
within
the
blood
transfusion
service
in
England
(NHSBT), a survey was conducted to collate instances where rare or
problematic transfusion requirements were identified and in which
the requirement for matched blood could not be fulfilled or resulted
in no remaining store for subsequent patients. This survey, encom-
passing a combined 15 month period (November 2014–January
2015; April 2015–April 2016), identified 56 patients with rare blood
types with alloantibodies against RBC antigens (or with the likeli-
hood of acquisition without specific matching, e.g. in the case of
untransfused neonates). Table 1 summarises the data collected in
this study; 22 patients had alloantibodies to antigens located on
glycophorin B (GPB), U, S or s; 19 patients presented with alloanti-
bodies to at least one antigen within the Rh blood group system; 10
patients possessed alloantibodies to the Duffy blood group [with a
further two previously untransfused patients also Fy(a�b�)]; Kell
antigen alloantibodies were identified in 10 patients. Eight patients
presented with the Bombay or para-Bombay phenotype (a rare
phenotype in which a mutation in the FUT1 gene results in the loss
of the H antigen and transfusion incompatibility with all ABO
blood), and alloantibodies to Lu and Kidd antigens were identified
in three patients for each, respectively. In total, 19 patients (the
majority of them presenting with SCD) possessed alloantibodies to
antigens within more than one blood group system.
This study highlights the major blood groups for which alloim-
munisation and transfusion incompatibility is most relevant within
the population serviced by NHSBT. Discounting the two McLeod
patients [in which absence of XK results in the undesirable trait of
acanthocytic erythrocytes (Wimer et al, 1977)], the transfusion
requirements of 54 of the 56 patients identified could be serviced by
a hypothetical RBC phenotype lacking 7 blood group proteins and
48 of these patients by the removal of just 5. On this basis, we
decided to pursue the generation of RBCs completely deficient in
surface expression of GPB, Rh, Kell, Duffy and of the Bombay
phenotype (able to be received by recipients of blood group A, B,
AB, O or Bombay) using CRISPR–Cas9 editing for gene knockout in
a recently published immortalised erythroblast cell line: BEL-A
(Trakarnsanga et al, 2017).
Generation of individual blood group knockout cell lines for
transfusion therapy and as tools for diagnostics
In addition to acting as a much-needed source of rare blood for
transfusion requirements, blood donations by patients with unusual
phenotypes play a crucial role in serological testing by blood group
reference laboratories. These so-called reagent red cells with estab-
lished complete deficiency of a given blood group or antigen, for
example Rhnull or K0, provide essential controls that facilitate the

 identification of unknown alloantibodies in patient sera. Such cells,
currently curated and stored frozen by selected International Blood
Group Reference Laboratories, represent a finite resource, reliant
upon the identification of and donations from individuals with often
extremely rare naturally occurring mutations and phenotypes. The
ability to generate a sustainable library of enucleation competent
immortalised erythroblast cell lines completely deficient in expres-
sion of a range of individual blood groups of interest would have
obvious benefits for serological testing laboratories.
As a first step towards the combinatorial removal of multiple
blood groups and for the generation of cell lines with potential ther-
apeutic and diagnostic applications, we sought to generate BEL-A
cell lines with individual blood group knockouts useful for these
purposes. BEL-A cells were first single cell sorted by fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) and expanded to derive a founder
population, expanding cells were lentivirally transduced with a
construct containing Cas9 and gRNA targeting the gene of interest
as described in Materials and Methods. Following transduction, cells
were maintained in culture for at least 1 week to enable turnover of
existing protein, labelled with a specific antibody to the extracellular
epitope of the blood group protein targeted and then single cell
sorted by FACS based on complete negativity for protein of interest.
In the case of GPB, in which the protein was not expressed in undif-
ferentiated cells, blind sorting was conducted to derive single
clones. These clones were subsequently differentiated and analysed
by flow cytometry to confirm the absence of GPB surface expression
in reticulocytes.
Since the founder BEL-A cell line was derived from a donor of Rh
type D+C�c+E+e+ (for full blood group genotype see Table 2),
both RhD and RhCE required removal. To simplify this, a single guide
was designed to target RHAG, the gene encoding the Rh-associated
glycoprotein, essential for stable surface expression of Rh and in
which mutations are known to result in Rhnull (regulator type)
erythrocytes (Cherif-Zahar et al, 1996; Huang, 1998). Individual blood
group knockout BEL-A clones were expanded and a proportion
differentiated for verification of null phenotypes in enucleated reticu-
locytes. Figure 1 shows the complete absence of expression of
proteins targeted by CRISPR gRNAs in knockout reticulocytes
compared to reticulocytes derived from unedited cells, as assessed by
flow cytometry. In each case, reticulocytes were also labelled with a
panel of antibodies to additional major erythrocyte membrane
proteins: band 3, GPA, GPC and CD47 (Fig EV1). The anticipated
reduction in CD47, previously reported for Rhnull erythrocytes
(Mouro-Chanteloup et al, 2003), was recapitulated whilst expression
of band 3, GPA and GPC was unaltered compared to untransduced
control cells.
Combinatorial CRISPR editing for generation of RBC with
multiple blood group proteins ablated
Having determined guide sequences that enable the successful
knockout of each of the blood groups of interest, clonal GPB null
BEL-A cells were used as a starting point to generate a cell line
transduced with multiple guides resulting in a multiple knockout.
GPB null cells were transduced with three lentiCRISPRv2 lenti-
viruses simultaneously, each containing a guide targeting either KEL
(Kell gene), ACKR1 (Duffy gene) or FUT1 (gene encoding fucosyl-
transferase 1, the enzyme required for the generation of the H anti-
gen). Cells were immunolabelled with antibodies specific for each
targeted protein, a triple null population was single cell sorted, and
cells were expanded and differentiated for verification of the null
phenotype in reticulocytes as described for single knockouts. Cells
deficient in GPB, H, Kell and Duffy were subsequently transduced
with lentiCRISPRv2 containing a guide targeting RHAG to produce a
5× knockout (KO) BEL-A line. Biallelic mutations in each of the
genes targeted were confirmed and are listed in Table EV1.
Reticulocytes were generated by in vitro culture, 5× KO and
control cells were induced to undergo differentiation and after
14 days reticulocytes were isolated by leukofiltration. Figure 2A
shows flow cytometry histograms illustrating the absence of GPB (U
and s antigen on a S� background), Kell, Duffy, H antigen, RhAG

(Fig 2B). Null phenotypes were confirmed by indirect antiglobulin
tests (IATs) using human sera containing alloantibodies to antigens
in each blood group as indicated (Fig 2C). An extended figure
depicting additional RBC controls can be viewed in Fig EV2. Label-
ling with a panel of antibodies to other proteins identified the
expected reduction in CD47 (Mouro-Chanteloup et al, 2003) but no
alteration in levels of band 3, GPA or GPC (Fig EV3) confirming the
absence of gross membrane disruption. In order to determine
whether removal of the five blood group proteins altered the physi-
cal characteristics of reticulocytes, an Automated Rheoscope and
Cell Analyser (ARCA) was used to assess deformability. The
deformability index of 5× KO reticulocytes was found to be only
mildly reduced compared to untransduced control reticulocytes
(Fig 2D).
For complete protein level assessment of 5× KO cells, quantitative
proteomic analysis was performed using tandem mass tag (TMT)
labelled reticulocyte samples. Anticipated reductions in the Rh
complex proteins CD47 and ICAM-4 (39 and 93% reductions, respec-
tively) and the Kell interacting protein XK (37% reduction) were con-
firmed. However, only 2% of membrane and cytoskeletal proteins
showed at least a twofold reduction in abundance, demonstrating
minimal structural disruption resulting from blood group protein
removal. The similarity of the two cell types is illustrated in Fig 2E
which displays the log2 fold change of membrane and cytoskeletal
protein abundance in 5× KO compared to control BEL-A-derived
reticulocytes and Table 3 which lists the fold change of a selection of
other blood group, membrane and cytoskeletal proteins important
for RBC structure and function. Surprisingly, whilst flow cytometry
and serology confirmed the absence of Rh at the surface, trace abun-
dance of peptides was detected for Rh. Since Rhnull phenotype of the
regulator subtype was generated by targeting of the RHAG gene, we
assume that this signal originates from intracellular fragments of Rh
protein within a cellular protein degradation compartment. The
complete comparative proteome of the 5× KO and control reticulo-
cytes can be viewed in Fig EV4 and the Dataset EV1.
Off-target mutations arising from CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene
editing are a widely reported phenomenon (Zhang et al, 2015). For
the generation of in vitro derived RBCs, the importance of these off-
target mutations is mitigated by the stringent selection imparted by
the terminal differentiation and enucleation processes for the genera-
tion of a functional reticulocyte. Nevertheless, in order to assess the
frequency and identity of off-target mutations within the clonal
5× KO BEL-A line, whole genome sequencing was performed on
untransduced control and 5× KO lines (for access to raw data see,
Data Availability). Mutations in 5× KO cells were identified, and the
corresponding wild-type sequences were extended (100 bp upstream

Discussion
Blood for transfusion purposes can be difficult to source for patients
with rare blood group phenotypes and for patients who require
repeated blood transfusions, as extended donor–recipient matching
is required at the level of minor blood group antigens. Failure to
identify or locate suitable donors results in an unmet clinical need
that can have serious implications for the care of patients. Incompat-
ible blood transfusions may result in delayed haemolysis with renal
failure and poor haemoglobin increment (Gardner et al, 2015).
One of the major focuses of the RBC research community is to
generate in vitro derived RBCs to supplement or complement the
donation system where clinical needs are not currently met. The
first recipients of an in vitro derived transfusion product are antici-
pated to be those for whom blood matching is difficult or impossible

Multi-compatible RBC by CRISPR editing
Joseph Hawksworth et al
Published online: April 26, 2018 
 to achieve within the donor population. An indefinite supply of
RBCs could in principle be generated by immortalising CD34+
haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from individuals with rare
blood types, should appropriate donors be identified. However, a
more flexible approach is to use gene editing to generate customised
cells combining multiple null phenotypes to broaden the transfusion
compatibility of in vitro derived RBCs. Here, we have demonstrated
the feasibility of this approach by using CRISPR–Cas9 editing of a
recently published immortalised erythroblast cell line to generate
customised RBC antigen phenotypes through individual or combina-
torial knockout of blood group genes.
We have generated a selection of individual blood group null
cells which may be used for diagnostic applications. This will likely
represent the first practical use of such cells. As an expanded
library, these and other knockouts to be generated in future have
the potential to provide a sustainable alternative to supplement
existing panels of reagent RBCs for identification of serum alloanti-
bodies. More advanced or bespoke applications for the enhance-
ment of diagnostic sensitivity could also be envisaged, for example
removal of antigens such as those within the Knops (CR1) and John
Milton Hagen (JMH) systems that mask clinically significant anti-
gens (Poole & Daniels, 2007).
In addition to their diagnostics applications, erythroblast cell
lines capable of generating RBCs deficient in individual blood
groups such as Rhnull have potential clinical use for recipients with
specific rare phenotypes. The ultimate purpose of this study
however was to demonstrate the power of CRISPR–Cas9 to make
several clinically relevant knockouts within a single cell line that
together can be tolerated to generate reticulocytes theoretically
capable of servicing the widest unmet transfusion requirements.
The concept of a truly universal donor RBC phenotype is a contro-
versial one. A cell completely deficient in all known blood anti-
gens is unlikely to be viable given the key structural roles played
by several blood group proteins. Therefore, careful consideration
of target antigens for removal is required. However, priorities for
the removal of blood groups to enhance donor compatibility vary
with prevalence of antigens within different ethnic populations.
The RBC we have generated, null for five blood groups, would be
theoretically capable of servicing the unmet clinical need of 48 of
the 56 challenging transfusion cases identified by the NHSBT in
England over a 15-month period. Further alterations are possible
albeit with diminishing gains in compatibility. For example, the
additional
removal
of
Lutheran
and
Kidd
would
have
each
serviced an additional three patients.
Whilst individual absence of four of the five blood group proteins
edited in this study occurs naturally without pathological effects
(Anstee, 2011), the Rhnull phenotype is associated with mild
compensated anaemia (Sturgeon, 1970). Therefore, for transfusion
purposes, the enhanced compatibility provided by complete Rh
protein ablation may not outweigh the increased osmotic fragility
and reduced circulatory half-life reported for naturally occurring
Rhnull erythrocytes (Ballas et al, 1984; Cartron, 1999). Interestingly,
and contrary to expectations, we observed that 5× KO reticulocytes
exhibited only slightly reduced cellular deformability compared to
unedited BEL-A-derived reticulocytes. In the light of observations
made in previous studies, it is possible that in vivo circulatory matu-
ration, incompletely recapitulated by in vitro culture at present, is
required to reveal such phenotype. Future efforts towards the
development of more practical in vivo systems for monitoring long-
term reticulocyte survival and maturation will be informative in this
regard. Rather than complete ablation of RhAG or RhCE/D, maximi-
sation of compatibility in future development of this work could be
achieved through careful selection of CD34+ cells with a specific Rh
antigen profile prior to immortalisation of a new founder BEL-A line
potentially in combination with homology directed repair-based
editing of specific antigenic residues.
The translation of genetically engineered BEL-A lines into clini-
cal products for transfusion still faces many challenges. Improved
scalability, reductions in cost of culture, and production of a GMP
compatible line are needed. Alternative transient approaches to
CRISPR–Cas9 expression, and more specific targeting of antigens
to lessen disruption to the membrane, each offer advantages that
may enhance a future product. Nevertheless, the application of
gene editing to the manufacture of RBCs from immortalised
erythroid progenitor cell lines ushers closer an era in which the
transfusion needs of patients with rare blood group phenotypes
will be met using erythroblast cell lines. We present here a major
step towards the generation of customisable or multi-compatible
RBCs
that
alongside
developments
in
efficiency
of
in
vitro
erythroid culture could ultimately facilitate transfusion of patients
with unmet clinical needs.
Materials and Methods
BEL-A cell culture
BEL-A cells were cultured as previously described (Trakarnsanga
et al, 2017). In brief, cells were maintained in expansion medium
[StemSpan SFEM (Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with
50 ng/ml SCF, 3 U/ml EPO, 1 lM dexamethasone and 1 lg/ml
doxycycline] at 1–3 × 105 cells/ml. Complete medium changes were
performed every 48 h. Differentiation was induced as previously
described (Trakarnsanga et al, 2017) with modifications as follows:
cells were seeded at 2 × 105/ml in differentiation medium supple-
mented with 1 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml SCF and 1 lg/ml doxycycline.
After 2 days, cells were reseeded at 3.5 × 105/ml in fresh medium.
On differentiation day 4, cells were reseeded at 5 × 105/ml in fresh
medium without doxycycline. On differentiation day 6, a complete
media change was performed and cells were reseeded at 1 × 106/
ml. On day 8, cells were transferred to differentiation medium
(containing no SCF, IL-3 or doxycycline) and maintained at 1 × 106/
ml with complete medium changes every 2 days until day 14.
Lentiviral transduction of single guide CRISPR–Cas9 vectors
Pre-validated CRISPR guides to blood group genes in the lentiviral
vector lentiCRISPRv2 were ordered from GenScript (Sanjana et al,
2014). gRNA sequences used are listed in Table EV2. Lentivirus was
prepared according to previously published protocols (Satchwell
et al, 2015). For transduction of BEL-A cells, virus was added to
2 × 105 cells in 2 ml medium in the presence of 8 lg/ml polybrene
for 24 h. Cells were washed, and resuspended in fresh medium, and
after 24 h, transduced cells were selected using 1 lg/ml puromycin
for 48 h. Following further expansion, cells were sorted based on
antigen null phenotype to derive clones.

 Flow cytometry and FACS
For flow cytometry on undifferentiated BEL-As, 1 × 105 cells resus-
pended in PBSAG (PBS + 1 mg/ml BSA, 2 mg/ml glucose) + 1%
BSA were labelled with primary antibody for 30 min at 4°C. Cells
were washed in PBSAG, incubated for 30 min at 4°C with appropri-
ate APC-conjugated secondary antibody, and washed and data
acquired on a MacsQuant VYB Analyser using a plate reader. For
FACS sorting of immunolabelled cells, a BDInflux Cell Sorter was
used to isolate single clones from the antigen null, propidium
iodide-negative population into 96-well plates. For differentiated
BEL-As, cells were stained with 5 lg/ml Hoechst 33342 then fixed if
required in 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.0075% glutaraldehyde to
reduce antibody binding-induced agglutination before labelling with
antibodies as described. Reticulocytes were identified by gating
upon Hoechst-negative population.
Antibodies
Mouse monoclonal antibodies were used as follows: (1:2 dilutions
of unpurified supernatant), BRIC231 (anti-H) LA1818 (RhAG),
BRIC69 (RhD/CE), BRIC203 (Kell), BRIC4 (GPC), BRIC32 (CD47),
BRIC222 (CD44), BRIC256 (GPA) (all IBGRL), 2C3 (FY) (INSERM,
Paris). Human antibodies were used for detection of s antigen (San-
quin Blood Supply, 1:50) and U antigen (IBGRL, 1:5). Secondary
antibodies (1:50) were APC-conjugated monoclonal anti-mouse
IgG1 or polyclonal anti-IgG (Biolegend) or Alexa647-anti-human
(Jackson Laboratories).
Serological detection of blood group antigens
Human anti-H, anti-U, anti-Rh29, anti-Ku and mouse monoclonal
anti-Fy3 (MIMA29, New York Blood Centre; all antibodies were
derived from the IBGRL reference collection) were used for serologi-
cal detection of blood group antigens. Cell suspensions were
prepared from 0.5 × 106 or 1.0 × 106 BEL-A-derived reticulocytes
and pelleted at 500 g for 5 min; supernatant was removed, and
reticulocytes were resuspended in 20 ll of ID-Diluent 2 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Switzerland). All antibodies were tested by IATs using
column agglutination technology. Each human antibody was tested
in Bio-Rad LISS/Coombs ID-Cards, and MIMA29 was tested in Bio-
Rad ID-PNH Test Cards (both Bio-Rad Laboratories, Switzerland).
20 ll of prepared cell suspension was added to each column
followed by 10 ll of the relevant antibody or antisera. Cards were
incubated for 15 min at 37°C and centrifuged as per manufacturer
instructions.
Verification of CRISPR on- and off-target effects by whole
genome sequencing
For verification of CRISPR edits, genomic DNA was isolated from
specific clones using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). DNA
quality validation, whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic
analysis were performed by Novogene. Genomic DNA was isolated
from unedited control or 5× KO cells using a DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit (Qiagen), checked for purity using a NanoPhotometer
spectrophotometer (Implen), and DNA concentration was measured
using Qubit DNA Assay Kit in a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life
Technologies). A total amount of 1.0 lg genomic DNA per sample
was used as input material for the DNA sample preparations. RNA
was removed using RNase at 37°C for 25 min. Sequencing libraries
were generated using NEBNext� DNA Library Prep Kit following
manufacturer’s recommendations. The genomic DNA was randomly
fragmented to a size of 350 bp by shearing, and then, DNA frag-
ments were end polished, A-tailed, and ligated with the NEBNext
adapter for Illumina sequencing, and further PCR enriched by P5
and indexed P7 oligos. The PCR products were purified (AMPure XP
system), and resulted libraries were analysed for size distribution by
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR.
The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a
cBot Cluster Generation System using Hiseq X HD PE Cluster Kit (Illu-
mina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster
generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina
Hiseq X Ten platform and paired-end reads were generated. The orig-
inal raw data were transformed to sequenced reads by base calling
and recorded in FASTQ file, which contains sequence information
(reads) and corresponding sequencing quality information. Burrows–
Wheeler Aligner (BWA) was utilised to map the paired-end clean
reads to the human reference genome (b37, ftp://gsapubftp-anon
ymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/b37/human_g1k_v37_decoy.
fasta.gz). SAMtools and Picard were used to perform BAM sorting
and duplicate marking to generate final BAM file for computation of
the sequence coverage and depth. A total of 90.6 Gb clean reads with
average sequencing depth of 30.2× and a whole genome coverage of
99% (bases with depth > 10 × 98.1%) were obtained for the
unedited cell sample and for the 5× KO sample, 194.2 Gb with a
depth of 65.05× and coverage of 99.1% (98.9% with depth > 10×).
We focused on the potential off-target effect of Cas9 and five gRNAs
expression within the whole genome by comparing the genomic dif-
ferences between the unedited control and 5× KO samples. For both
samples, SNPs were detected by muTect (Cibulskis et al, 2013), the
indels by Strelka (Saunders et al, 2012). All somatic SNPs and indels
(up to 50 nt) unique to the 5× KO cells were identified by comparison
with the parent line. These mutation sequences were extended to
include 100 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream of the mutation
sites, the corresponding wild-type sequences were extracted, and a
BLAST search was performed using each gRNA + PAM sequence to
identify off-target mutations. Results were filtered based on the editing
characteristics of the CRISPR–Cas9 to identify mutations attributable
to the editing process according to criteria in which (i) the cleavage
site was proximal to 3 bp upstream of the PAM and (ii) less than 6 bp
of mismatch exists between gRNA and potential gRNA target host
genome plus PAM (“NRG”), or a continuous match of the final 10-bp
seed sequence immediately upstream of the PAM NRG occurs.
TMT labelling, mass spectrometry and data analysis
Total cell lysates from 2 × 106 reticulocytes per sample were digested
with trypsin (2.5 lg trypsin per 100 lg protein; 37°C, overnight) and
labelled with Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) six plex reagents according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughbor-
ough, LE11 5RG, UK), and the labelled samples were pooled. An
aliquot of the pooled sample was evaporated to dryness, resus-
pended in 5% formic acid and then desalted using SepPak cartridges
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Waters, Milford, MA,
USA). Eluate from the SepPak cartridge was again evaporated to

 dryness and resuspended in buffer A (20 mM ammonium hydroxide,
pH 10) prior to fractionation by high pH reversed-phase chromato-
graphy using an Ultimate 3000 liquid chromatography system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). In brief, the sample was loaded onto an
XBridge BEH C18 Column (130 A
˚ , 3.5 lm, 2.1 × 150 mm, Waters,
UK) in buffer A and peptides eluted with an increasing gradient of
buffer B (20 mM ammonium hydroxide in acetonitrile, pH 10) from
0 to 95% over 60 min. The resulting fractions were evaporated to
dryness and resuspended in 1% formic acid prior to analysis by
nano-LC MSMS using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific).
High pH RP fractions were further fractionated using an Ultimate
3000 nano-LC system in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). In brief, peptides in 1% (vol/vol)
formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap
column (Thermo Scientific). After washing with 0.5% (vol/vol)
acetonitrile 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, peptides were resolved on a
250 mm × 75 lm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse-phase analytical
column (Thermo Scientific) over a 150-min organic gradient, using
seven gradient segments (1–6% solvent B over 1 min, 6–15% B over
58 min, 15–32% B over 58 min, 32–40% B over 5 min, 40–90% B
over 1 min, held at 90% B for 6 min and then reduced to 1% B over
1 min) with a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Solvent A was 0.1% formic
acid, and Solvent B was aqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic
acid. Peptides were ionised by nano-electrospray ionisation at
2.0 kV using a stainless-steel emitter with an internal diameter of
30 lm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 275°C.
All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass
spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2.0 software (Thermo Scien-
tific) and operated in data-dependent acquisition mode using an
SPS-MS3 workflow. FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of
120,000, with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 400,000
and a max injection time of 100 ms. Precursors were filtered with
an intensity range from 5,000 to 1E20, according to charge state (to
include charge states 2–6) and with monoisotopic precursor selec-
tion. Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a
dynamic
window
(60s � 10 ppm).
The
MS2
precursors
were
isolated with a quadrupole mass filter set to a width of 1.2 m/z.
ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGC target of 10,000, max
injection time of 70 ms and CID collision energy of 35%.
For FTMS3 analysis, the Orbitrap was operated at 30,000 resolu-
tion with an AGC target of 50,000 and a max injection time of 105 ms.
Precursors were fragmented by high energy collision dissociation
(HCD) at a normalised collision energy of 55% to ensure maximal
TMT reporter ion yield. Synchronous precursor selection (SPS) was
enabled to include up to five MS2 fragment ions in the FTMS3 scan.
The raw data files were processed and quantified using Proteome
Discoverer software v2.1 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against
the UniProt Human database (134,169 entries) using the SEQUEST
algorithm. Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and
MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Search criteria included the
oxidation of methionine (+15.9949) as a variable modification and
carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0214) and the addition of
the TMT mass tag (+229.163) to peptide N-termini and lysine as
fixed modifications. Searches were performed with full tryptic diges-
tion and a maximum of one missed cleavage was allowed. The
reverse database search option was enabled, and all peptide data
were filtered to satisfy false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%.
Reticulocyte deformability measurements using ARCA
1 × 106 BEL-A-derived reticulocytes were resuspended in 200 ll
polyvinylpyrrolidone solution (PVP viscosity 28.1; Mechatronics
Instruments, The Netherlands). Samples were assayed in an ARCA
(Dobbe et al, 2002) consisting of a plate–plate optical shearing stage
(model CSS450) mounted on a Linkam imaging station assembly
and temperature controlled using Linksys32 software (Linkam
Scientific Instruments, Surrey, UK). The microscope was equipped
with an LMPlanFL 50× with a 10.6 mm working distance objective
(Olympus, Essex, UK) illuminated by a X-1500 stroboscope (Perki-
nElmer, The Netherlands) through a band-pass interference filter
(CWL 420 nm, FWHM 10 nm; Edmund Optics, Poppleton, UK).
Images were acquired using a uEye camera (UI-2140SE-M-GL; IDS
GmbH, Obersulm, Germany). At least 1,000 cell images per sample
were acquired and analysed using bespoke ARCA software.

The paper explained
Problem
The provision of blood for patients who require repeated blood trans-
fusions, as well as for individuals with rare blood types, presents an
enormous challenge to transfusion services worldwide. Patients with
RBC disorders such as thalassaemia or sickle-cell disease require regu-
lar transfusions. With repeated transfusion, alloimmunisation often
occurs due to incompatibility at the level of minor blood group anti-
gens. Individuals with rare blood group phenotypes, such as those
with the Bombay phenotype and Rhnull individuals, require difficult-
to-source blood from individuals with the same rare phenotype other-
wise risk haemolytic transfusion reactions.
Results
We have generated a selection of erythroblast cell lines with key
blood group proteins knocked out which can be differentiated to
produce reticulocytes. Furthermore, we have combined knockouts to
produce a single cell line which can generate reticulocytes with
absence of multiple blood group proteins.
Impact
The generation of in vitro derived RBCs to supplement or complement
the donation system is a major focus of the RBC research community.
This is the first study to generate deformable reticulocytes from an
immortalised adult erythroblast cell line which has been genetically
edited using CRISPR–Cas9 to improve transfusion compatibilities. The
first recipients of an in vitro derived transfusion product are antici-
pated to be those for whom alloimmunisation or rare blood group
phenotypes make blood matching difficult or impossible to achieve
within the donor population. We have demonstrated CRISPR-mediated
gene editing as a flexible approach to the successful production of
in vitro derived RBCs with customised or unique blood group pheno-
types that could ultimately facilitate transfusion of patients with
unmet clinical needs.
