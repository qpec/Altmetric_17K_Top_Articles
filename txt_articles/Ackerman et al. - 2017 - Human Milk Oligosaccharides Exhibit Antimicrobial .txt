Abstract
Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that 
causes invasive infections of both children and adults. During pregnancy, GBS is a significant 
cause of infection of the fetal membranes (chorioamnionitis), which can lead to intra-amniotic 
infection, preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal sepsis. Recently, breastfeeding has been thought to 
represent a potential mode of GBS transmission from mother to newborn, which might increase 
the risk for late-onset sepsis. Little is known, however, about the molecular components of breast 
milk that may support or prevent GBS colonization. In this study, we examine how human milk 
oligosaccharides (HMOs) affect the pathogenesis of GBS. HMOs from discrete donor samples 
were isolated and profiled by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass 
spectrometry (MS). Growth and biofilm assays show that HMOs from mothers of specific milk 
groups can modulate the growth and biofilm formation of GBS. High-resolution field-emission 
gun scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the 
quantitative biofilm assays and demonstrated cell arrangement perturbations in bacterial cultures 
treated with specific oligosaccharides. These findings demonstrate that HMOs affect the growth 
and cell biology of GBS. Finally, this study provides the first example of HMOs functioning as 
anti-biofilm agents against GBS.

Human milk is the model source of nutrition for the developing infant. Professional bodies, 
such as the World Health Organization,1 American Academy of Pediatrics,2 and the U. S. 
Department of Health and Human Services3 recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 
six months of life followed by integration into a mixed diet through two years of age and 
beyond.
In addition to providing nourishment, human milk is among the earliest vehicles for 
intestinal bacterial colonization.4 There are an estimated 400 species of bacteria present in 
human milk at any given time.5-6 Although the majority of these bacteria are symbiotic or 
commensal species with roles varying from metabolic to immune enhancing, the 
transmission of bacteria via human milk consumption also causes newborn diseases.7-9 
Nevertheless, breast milk consumption leads to critical modulation of the host immune 
development, which promotes both tolerance and immunity. This protection is due, in part, 
to human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), the third largest macromolecular component of 
human milk.10-11
Structurally, HMOs incorporate just five monosaccharide residues. Still, there are 
approximately 200 unique structures that have been observed.12 Interestingly, not all women 
produce the same oligosaccharides. Instead, oligosaccharide structure and composition vary 
across Lewis blood group and secretor status and throughout the duration of nursing.13 
Lewis blood groups are based on the presence of certain antigens synthesized by fucosyl 
transferases, and secretor status is determined by the activity of enzymes responsible for 
secreting antigens into body secretions.14 HMOs distinguish human milk from that of other 
mammals and, consequently, assist in conferring benefits during the perinatal period that are 
not observed through formula feeding. For example, HMOs serve as prebiotics that select for 
the growth of symbiotes.11 Moreover, HMOs are anti-adhesive antimicrobial agents or free 
flowing receptor decoys that block the attachment of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, 
preventing bacterial adhesion and colonization, the first stage of infection.10
The project described herein originated from the observation that human milk is a potential 
channel for vertical transmission of Streptococcus agalactiae, more commonly known as 
Group B Streptococcus (GBS).15-17 GBS is a Gram-positive pathogen that is a common

 cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis.18-19 In addition to neonatal disease, GBS is a 
leading cause of both human and bovine mastitis.20-21
In industrialized countries, prenatal screening coupled with targeted antibiotic prophylaxis 
during labor and delivery has reduced the rate of GBS early onset neonatal sepsis (i.e. sepsis 
that occurs during the first week of life).22-23 This approach, however, is not universally 
practiced, particularly in low and middle-income countries where the quality of perinatal 
health care is variable.24 Moreover, there is no preventative or curative solution to GBS 
infection occurring after the first week of life (late onset GBS disease).
Like many bacterial species, an important aspect of GBS pathogenesis is it’s ability to form 
biofilms, a well-known virulence pathway that provides increased resistance to antimicrobial 
agents as well as host defenses.25 Based on the established evidence that HMOs possess 
antimicrobial activity, we hypothesized milk oligosaccharides could modulate both the 
bacterial growth and biofilm production of GBS. Previous research has demonstrated the 
importance of GBS capsule polysaccharide biosynthesis in mediating biofilm formation, 
supporting our hypothesis that oligosaccharides could influence biofilm establishment.26-27 
Additionally, GBS capsular polysaccharides from type Ib and II are similar in structure to 
certain human milk oligosaccharides.28 A study by Pritchard and coworkers showed mouse 
antibodies for GBS capsular polysaccharides bind to HMOs.28 Moreover, the Bode and Le 
Doare groups have reported that HMOs inhibit the proliferation of GBS in vitro29-31 (Figure 
1).
Considering that recent data supports breastfeeding as a contributory factor to late-onset 
GBS transmission, there is a compelling need to understand what molecular components of 
human milk, which is generally protective for the neonate, might positively or negatively 
impact pathogen transmission. Moreover, our research team has a core interest in 
discovering and examining compounds produced by the host, which are protective against 
GBS. Herein, we report the antimicrobial properties of oligosaccharide isolates from donor 
human milk samples as well as their effect on biofilm formation and biofilm architecture.
METHODS
PURIFICATION OF HMOS
Human milk was obtained from five healthy, lactating women between 3 days and 3 months 
postnatal and stored at −20°C. The de-identified milk was provided by Dr. J-H Weitkamp 
from the Vanderbilt Department of Pediatrics under a collection protocol approved by the 
Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board (IRB#100897). Milk samples and the 
respective components from subsequent purification steps were kept separate. The lipid 
components were removed by skimming after centrifugation. Proteins were precipitated by 
addition of ethanol at 4°C and subsequent centrifugation. The HMO-containing supernatant 
was concentrated in vacuo and purified by P-2 Gel (H2O eluent) and the oligosaccharides 
were dried by lyophilization.

 MS AND MS/MS ANALYSIS OF HMO SAMPLES
Dried HMO samples were reconstituted in water to approximately 1 mg/mL. The HMO 
solutions were deposited on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) target 
plate as follows: 1 μL HMO was spotted followed by 0.2 μL 10 mM NaCl and 1 μL DHB 
matrix (60 mg/mL in 50% methanol). The spots were allowed to air dry and were analyzed 
in positive ion mode on a 9.4T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass 
spectrometry (MS) (Bruker Solarix). Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode 
from m/z 300-2500. Sodium ion adducts of HMO’s were detected with a mass accuracy of 
>2 ppm.
MS/MS analysis was performed for selected ions with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer 
equipped with a MALDI source (LTQ XL, Thermo Scientific). Selected sodium adduct ions 
of interest were isolated with a 1 amu window and fragmented via CID using a collision 
energy of 35 eV.
BACTERIAL STRAINS AND CULTURE CONDITIONS
S. agalactiae strain CNCTC 10/84 (ATCC) was cultured on tryptic soy agar plates 
supplemented with 5% sheep blood (blood agar plates) at 37°C in ambient air overnight. 
Bacteria were subcultured from blood agar plates into Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) and 
incubated under shaking conditions at 37°C in ambient air overnight. The following day, 
bacterial density was measured spectrophotometrically using optical density measurements 
at 600 nm (OD600), and bacterial numbers were determined using the predetermined 
coefficient of 1 OD600= 109 CFU/mL.
BACTERIAL GROWTH AND VIABILITY ANALYSES
S. agalactiae strain CNCTC 10/84 cells were cultured overnight in THB and then 
subcultured by inoculating 106 cells per 5 mL of THB or THB supplemented with 1% 
glucose. Cultures were grown under shaking conditions in THB alone or supplemented with 
5 mg/mL HMOs isolated from the various human milk samples (Donors 1-5) or in THB 
supplemented with 1% glucose or THB supplemented with 1% glucose and 5 mg/mL HMOs 
isolated from the various human milk samples (Donors 1-5) at 37°C in ambient air. Bacterial 
growth was evaluated by spectrophotometric reading of OD600 and bacterial viability was 
evaluated by serial dilution and plating onto blood agar plates and quantifying viable colony 
forming units per mL of culture (CFU/mL).
BACTERIAL BIOFILM ASSAYS
S. agalactiae strain CNCTC 10/84 was grown overnight as described above prior to 
subculturing 106 bacterial cells into 200 μL THB supplemented with 1% glucose (to 
promote biofilm formation) in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Inc.). Bacterial cells 
were added to wells containing media alone or wells supplemented with 5 mg/mL HMOs 
isolated from the various human milk samples (Donors 1-5). Cultures were incubated under 
static conditions at 37°C in ambient air for 24h.
Optical density (OD600) was measured for each sample as a measure of bacterial growth. 
The medium was aspirated, and each well was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline

 (PBS, pH 7.4) to remove non-adherent cells. Wells were then stained with a 10% crystal 
violet solution for 15 minutes. After staining, the wells were again washed with PBS and 
then allowed to dry at room temperature for 30 minutes. After drying, crystal violet staining 
was solubilized with an 80% ethanol/20% acetone solution. The absorbance (OD560) was 
measured for each sample as a measure of biofilm formation. The data shown represents 5 
independent experiments, each with 3 technical replicates.
FIELD-EMISSION GUN SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Bacterial cells were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy as previously described with 
some modifications.32 Briefly, bacteria were cultured in THB supplemented with 1% 
glucose in wells containing 12 mm glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (Corning, 
Bedford MA) at 37°C for 24 hours. At 24 hours, supernatants were removed and samples 
were fixed with 2.0% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate 
buffer for 24 hours. Secondary fixation with 0.1% osmium tetroxide was performed for 5 
minutes prior to sequential dehydration with increasing concentrations of ethanol. After 
ethanol dehydration, samples were dried at the critical point using a critical point dryer 
machine (Tousimis), mounted onto aluminum sample stubs, and sputter-coated with 80/20 
gold-palladium. Afterward, samples were painted with a thin strip of colloidal silver 
(Electron Microscopy Sciences) at the edge to facilitate charge dissipation. Samples were 
imaged with an FEI Quanta 250 field-emission gun scanning electron microscope. Images 
shown are representative of three separate experiments.
CONFOCAL LASER SCANNING MICROSCOPY ANALYSES
Bacterial cells were cultured as above in wells containing THB supplemented with 1% 
glucose and containing glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine. Cultures were grown 
under static conditions for 24 hours at 37°C. At 24 hours, coverslips were washed with PBS 
prior to staining with LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit, which includes both Syto 
9 (green) and propidium iodide (red) (Life Technologies) to visualize bacterial cells and 
calcofluor white (blue) (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize carbohydrate capsule/matrix within the 
biofilm.
Coverslips were stained for 15 minutes followed by 2 washes with PBS. Both, SYTO 9 and 
propidium iodide stain nucleic acids, but propidium iodide is only able to penetrate damaged 
cell membranes and competes with SYTO 9 staining within dead bacterial cells. When used 
concurrently, stained bacteria with intact cell membranes will fluoresce green and cells with 
damaged cells will stain fluorescent red. Calcofluor white binds to β-1,3 and β-1,4 
polysaccharides such as chitin and cellulose has been shown to stain the extrapolymeric 
substances in biofilms of Streptococcus species and other bacteria.33-35 Coverslips were then 
mounted on glass microscope slides using Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc.) Samples 
were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 710 Meta Inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope with 
Zen 2011 software.
BACTERIAL BIOFILM ASSAYS WITH ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE
Bacterial biofilm assays were carried out as previously described in the bacterial biofilm 
assay section with some modifications. Bacterial cells were added to wells containing media

 alone, media and Polymixin B (1 to 10 μg/mL), media supplemented with HMOs (5 mg/
mL), or media, HMOs (5 mg/mL), and Polymixin B (1 to 10 μg/mL). The data shown 
represents 3 independent experiments, each with 3 technical replicates.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
MALDI-FTICR MS/MS PROFILING OF HMOS REVEALS LEWIS BLOOD GROUPS OF 
DONORS
HMO expression patterns are known to vary from mother to mother and depend largely on 
the mother’s secretor and Lewis blood status.10, 29, 36-37 Recent reports have demonstrated 
the use of mass spectrometry and NMR analysis to categorize human milk samples by 
mother secretor and Lewis blood group status.38-40 Kunz and coworkers developed a high 
throughput mass fingerprinting technique that uses MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI-TOF 
MS/MS.38 Their work shows that the MS and MS/MS fragmentation peaks and intensities, 
major fucose-containing oligosaccharides and their fucosyl linkage types can be identified 
and the corresponding secretor/Lewis status assigned. Based on the analysis presented by 
Kunz and coworkers,38 we investigated MS/MS fragmentations of parent peaks m/z 657 and 
1022. Analysis of MS/MS of m/z 657 revealed Donors 2, 3, 4, and 5 to have a fragmentation 
m/z 511 present, which is associated with secretor-types Le(a−b+) and Le(a−b−), whereas 
and Donor 1 was missing this characteristic fragment ion and thus designated as a 
nonsecretor-type Le(a+b−) (Figure 2A). Distinguishing between secretor-types Le(a−b+) 
and Le(a−b−) required analysis of MS/MS of m/z 1022, particularly the relative intensities 
of main fragment ions at m/z 730 and m/z 876 (Figure 2B). Based on this analysis, Donors 2 
and 4 were identified as Le(a−b+) and Donors 3 and 5 were identified as Le(a−b−) (Table 1).
HMOS MODULATE GROWTH AND VIABILITY OF S. AGALACTIAE
We next sought to understand how HMOs affected the growth and viability of GBS, a 
common pathogen in the neonatal period, in two growth environments. First, GBS cells were 
grown in media alone (Todd Hewitt Broth, THB) or THB containing HMOs from different 
donor breast milk samples. Cultures were measured spectrophotometrically at OD600 as a 
measurement of bacterial growth and samples were serially diluted and plated on blood agar 
plates to confirm bacterial cell viability. Interestingly, HMOs from donor 1 demonstrated 
marked anti-microbial activity against GBS compared with media alone (Figure 3), resulting 
in approximately 40% growth inhibition. Additionally, HMOs from donor 3 inhibited GBS 
growth to a lesser degree and growth curves demonstrated a significant decrease in bacterial 
growth for the first 8 hours of culture (Figure 3), with percent inhibition holding near 23% 
for hours 4-6 and dropping to 14.4% at hour 7. Donors 2, 4, and 5 showed no significant 
effect on GBS growth in THB.
Next, GBS cells were grown in THB containing 1% glucose or THB containing both 1% 
glucose and HMOs from different donor breast milk samples. Growth was measured as 
described previously. As before, HMOs from donor 1 demonstrated marked anti-microbial 
activity against GBS compared with the control (Figure 4). However, after 22 hours, growth 
begins, suggesting that the HMOs from donor 1 are acting as a bacteriostatic agent. HMOs

 from all other donors (2-5) showed no significant effect on GBS growth in THB 
supplemented with 1% glucose.
EVALUATION OF HMO EFFECT ON GBS BIOFILM FORMATION
In order to evaluate biofilm formation, a plate based biofilm assay was utilized that allows 
for measurement of bacterial growth as well as biofilm production noted by crystal violet 
staining. Results are expressed as a ratio of the biofilm produced to the number of bacterial 
cells present (biomass). GBS biofilm production was largely unaffected by the presence of 
HMOs in the growth media (Figure 5a). HMOs from donor 1 seemed to significantly 
increase the biofilm/biomass ratio of cells grown in THB alone (p=0.0008 by one-way 
ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparison test). However, this result was due to 
inhibition of cell growth (as shown in Figure 3), which is in contrast to the restored growth 
observed after 22 hours in THB with 1% glucose (Figure 4). When GBS cells were grown in 
media supplemented with glucose, which has been shown to promote biofilm formation,25 
supplementation with HMOs from donor 3 significantly diminished the biofilm/biomass 
ratio (p = 0.0018 by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparison test) 
(Figure 5b). A comparison of the relative biofilm amounts produced shows that in THB 
alone none of the donor HMOs had a significant effect (Figure 5c). However, HMOs from 
donors 1 and 3 significantly reduced the amount of biofilm produced when grown in THB 
with 1% glucose (p < 0.05 by way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparison 
test) (Figure 5d). Numerical measurements used to compare biofilm formation and IC50 
values for HMOs from donors that inhibited growth are shown in Figure 5e.
MICROSCOPIC EVALUATION OF BIOFILMS GROWN IN THE PRESENCE OF HMOS
In addition to biofilm quantification, we evaluated if incubation with HMO’s resulted in any 
structural differences to GBS biofilms. Biofilms were grown in media supplemented with 
1% glucose to enhance biofilm formation and compared to media also supplemented with 
HMOs from the 5 donor breast milk samples and then analyzed by high-resolution scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate changes in biofilm architecture and size. Compared 
to media alone, GBS cells incubated with HMOs from donor 1 demonstrated less diffuse 
biofilms and with smaller biofilm mushroom structures (Figure 6). Additionally, GBS 
biofilms grown in the presence of HMOs from donor 3 and 5 had less prominent nutrient 
channels compared to GBS biofilms grown in the presence of HMOs from Donors 2 and 4. 
This observation aligns with the breast milk donor categorization of Lewis blood groups by 
MALDI profiling, suggesting that HMO groups may lead to alterations in GBS biofilm 
structure. We then examined these biofilms at higher magnification to visualize finer details 
in biofilm structure. SEM analysis at high magnification revealed that while most donor 
samples had little effect on the cellular organization of the biofilm, samples grown with 
HMOs from donor 1 demonstrated changes in GBS chaining morphology. GBS strain 10/84 
phenotypically forms long chains. However, donor 1 seemed to induce a truncated chain 
phenotype that is shorter than the control sample as well as a denser packing morphology 
within the biofilm (Figure 7).
Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to analyze structural and compositional 
aspects of GBS 10/84 biofilms. Bacterial biofilms were grown in media alone (THB + 1%

 glucose) or media supplemented with HMOs from 5 donor breast milk samples. Biofilms 
grown in the presence of donor 3 showed a decrease in thickness of the biofilm relative to 
biofilms grown in media alone as seen by a comparison of the x- and y-axis views of Figure 
8. Additionally, comparison of the first and last z-stack images show more intense 
carbohydrate (blue) content at the apical surface of the biofilm relative to the base, which is 
mostly composed of dead (red) and live (green) cells (Figure 9).
While there is preliminary evidence that late-onset GBS transmission is associated with 
breast-feeding, we have demonstrated that HMOs isolated from distinct donors exhibit 
antimicrobial properties. Moreover, we have demonstrated that HMOs also disrupt the 
formation of biofilms produced by this pathogen. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first example of HMOs serving as anti-biofilm agents.
Given the discovery of the modulatory effects of HMOs against GBS, it is peculiar to note 
the diversity of effects displayed by glycans from each donor (Table 2). HMOs from donor 1 
(non-secretor) significantly inhibited the growth of GBS in both THB (Figure 3) and THB 
supplemented with 1% glucose (Figure 4) and changed the morphology of the biofilm 
(Figure 6). HMOs from donor 3 (secretor) significantly inhibited GBS growth in THB for 
the first 8 hours of a 24-hour growth period (Figure 3) and significantly decreased in vitro 
biofilm production as measured by the biofilm/biomass ratio (Figure 6). Additionally, donors 
3 and 5 affected the visual nutrient channel formation of GBS biofilms as show by SEM 
(Figure 5). HMOs from donors 2 and 4 showed no significant antibacterial or anti-biofilm 
effects.
This data provides insight, at the molecular level, to the protective measures available from 
the host to decrease risk of GBS transmission. Previously, human milk based biologics have 
demonstrated modulatory effects on streptococcal biofilm formation. For example, 
lactoferrin and IgA inhibit biofilm formation while lactose and casein enhance biofilm 
formation in Streptococcus mutans.41 Our study reveals pooled HMOs from distinct donors 
modulate biofilm formation in GBS. Furthermore, our work indicates pooled HMOs can 
inhibit bacterial growth. Interestingly, genetic analyses in related streptococcal species, such 
as S. mutans, reveal that accumulation of galactose metabolism intermediates can inhibit 
bacterial growth.42 Thus, it remains possible that exposure of GBS to HMOs may serve to 
alter carbohydrate metabolism leading to accumulation of toxic intermediates which 
ultimately repress bacterial growth or biofilm formation.
The combinatorial approach to study antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties of HMOs 
from both secretors and non-secretors has provided insight into how the milk of different 
mothers might influence infant health in relationship to GBS. The data presented in this 
paper add to previous studies supporting the importance and potential inhibitory effect of 
HMOs in defending against GBS colonization.
We speculate the anti-biofilm activity could be related to metabolism, as it is possible the 
addition of exogenous sugars saturates the bacterial community to provide excess nutrients. 
This action would negate advantages associated with biofilm formation. Alternatively, 
HMOs may interfere with the bacterial communication pathways (i.e. quorum sensing) 
Ackerman et al.

 necessary for biofilm formation. A final suggestion is that HMOs are synergistic with or 
enhance naturally occurring antimicrobials (such as AMPs) that may be present.
While research into the mechanism of action is ongoing in our laboratory, we have 
conducted a study to probe the postulated synthetic lethality of HMOs and AMPs. As shown 
in Figure 10, when exposed to a cocktail of HMOs from donors 2-5 and polymixcin B, GBS 
growth is not enhanced relative to the control. The cocktail of donor 1 HMOs and 
polymyxin B completely inhibited growth of the colony. Interestingly, when the same 
experiment was conducted in the presence of 1% glucose, HMOs from donor 1 
demonstrated no synergistic effects.
When examining changes to biofilm, we observed that as the amount of AMP is increased, 
biofilm production is decreased. Thus far, we have no observed enhancement by HMOs 
from any donor. Thus, we conclude that HMOs, depending on donor, may have the potential 
to increase susceptibility to an AMP. However, we have not observed any HMO-AMP 
synergy that reduces biofilm production.
Future studies toward the effects of individual HMOs on GBS may uncover unique structural 
motifs responsible for HMO antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties. Moreover, expanding 
the scope of GBS strains to include others of clinical relevance will provide further insight to 
the protective mechanisms of human milk glycans. Expanding the number of human milk 
oligosaccharide samples will fully define the extent of variability in effects of HMOs on 
GBS pathogenesis. Finally, we are currently studying cellular trafficking, RNA sequencing 
and proteomics, and additional HMO-antimicrobial cocktails, in order to tease out additional 
information regarding a mechanism of action. Results to this end, will be reported in due 
course.
