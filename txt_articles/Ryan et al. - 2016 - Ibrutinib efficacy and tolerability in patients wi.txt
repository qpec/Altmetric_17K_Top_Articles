Key Points
• Ibrutinib provided effective
salvage therapy in CLL
relapse post–alloHCT,
resulting in sustained MRD
negativity without GVHD
development.
• Ibrutinib selectively depleted
pre–germinal B cells and Th2
helper cells and may enhance
donor Th1 T-cell–mediated
GVL effects.
Ibrutinib, a potent and irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of both Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase and interleukin-2 inducible kinase (ITK), has been used to treat relapsed/refractory
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with prolongation of progression-free and overall
survival. Here, we present 27 patients with relapsed CLL following allogeneic hema-
topoietic cell transplant (HCT) who subsequently received ibrutinib salvage therapy.
Sixteen of these patients were part of multi-institutional clinical trials and achieved an
overall response rate of 87.5%. An additional 11 patients were treated at Stanford
University following US Food and Drug Administration approval of ibrutinib; 7 (64%)
achieved a complete response, and 3 (27%) achieved a partial response. Of the 9 patients
treated at Stanford who had mixed chimerism–associated CLL relapse, 4 (44%) converted
to full donor chimerism following ibrutinib initiation, in association with disease
response. Four of 11 (36%) patients evaluated by ClonoSeq achieved minimal residual
disease negativity with CLL <1/10 000 white blood cells, which persisted even after
ibrutinib was discontinued, in 1 case even after 26 months. None of the 27 patients
developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) following ibrutinib initiation. We postulate
that ibrutinib augments the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) benefit through a T-cell–mediated effect, most likely due to ITK inhibition. To
investigate the immune modulatory effects of ibrutinib, we completed comprehensive immune phenotype characterization of
peripheralB and T cells from treated patients. Our results show that ibrutinib selectively targets pre–germinal B cells and depletes Th2
helper cells. Furthermore, these effects persisted after drug discontinuation. In total, our results provide evidence that ibrutinib
effectively augments GVL without causing GVHD. (Blood. 2016;128(25):2899-2908)
Introduction
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) is used to treat
patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and
provides long-term disease-free survival.1 In a recent retrospective
study of 52 CLL patients who progressed following HCT, the 2- and
5-year overall survival rates posttransplant were 67% and 38%,
respectively.2 These results demonstrate the continued need for
additional effective therapeutic agents in the setting of post–allo-HCT
relapse.
Ibrutinib, a potent and irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of both
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase and interleukin-2 inducible kinase (ITK), as
well as several other tyrosine kinases, has been used to treat relapsed/
refractory (R/R) CLL, with high response rates and prolonged
progression-free and overall survival.3-8 In one study of 132 CLL
patients with either treatment-naive or R/R CLL, the most common
responses to single agent ibrutinib were durable partial responses, with
83% overall survival rate at 30 months of follow-up.9 ITK plays a key
role in the activation of both Th1 and Th2 cells. In Th1 cells, ITK
signalingissupportivebutdispensabletoredundantrestinglymphocyte
kinase signaling, whereas in Th2 cells, ITK signaling is essential to
activation.10-12 The subversion of the Th2 subpopulation via ibrutinib
results in skewing away from a Th2 cytokine profile, as evidenced by
the observed decrease in interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-4, and IL-13, in
patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib.12
The inhibition of ITK is of unique interest following allogeneic
transplant because we postulate that the Th1-mediated graft-versus-
leukemia (GVL) benefit will reduce leukemia relapse risk. Recent
studies have reported on small numbers of patients with CLL who
relapsed following allo-HCT and were treated with ibrutinib as a

 salvage therapy with promising results.2,13 Here, we present 27 patients
with relapsed CLL following allo-HCT who benefited from ibrutinib
salvage therapy. Sixteen of these patients were part of multi-
institutional clinical trials, and an additional 11 patients were treated
at Stanford University following US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval of ibrutinib. In our studies,ibrutinib proved to be a safe
and effective salvage therapy for CLL following allogeneic transplant.
Ibrutinib led to sustained disease response and therapeutic donor
immune modulation, improving GVL effects without contributing to
graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) development. Our comprehensive
immune phenotype characterization of peripheral B and T cells
collected from Stanford patients treated with ibrutinib shows that
ibrutinib selectively targets pre–germinal center B cells and depletes
Th2helper cells.Furthermore,these immune modulatoryeffects persist
following treatment discontinuation.
Patients and methods
Multi-institutional clinical trial cohort
Data were first collected for patients with R/R CLL who had undergone prior
allo-HCT and had been treated with ibrutinib on a Pharmacyclics-sponsored
clinical trial, either as a single agent or in combination with ofatumumab. These
patientswerein1of4clinicaltrials(supplementalTable1,availableontheBlood
Web site). All patients received 420 mg ibrutinib daily, except for 2 patients who
received 840 mg daily. Efficacy evaluation included response assessment
according to the International Workshop on CLL criteria (2008), and
hematologic adverse events (AEs) were graded using the Hallek criteria.14
Stanford University cohort
We additionally studied 11 Stanford allo-HCT patients who experienced CLL
relapse as defined by the 2008 International Workshop on CLL criteria14 after
FDA approval of ibrutinib in November 2013 and were not already part of the
aforementionedclinicaltrials.These patientsreceivedmonotherapywith420mg
ibrutinib daily and were monitored on an institutional review board–approved
researchbloodsampleprotocol.Theywereevaluatedforresponseat1monthand
3 months and at subsequent 3-month intervals, with concurrent AE evaluation.14
The cutoff date for data assessment was 1 March, 2016.
MRD monitoring and donor chimerism assessment
Minimal residual disease (MRD) and donor CD3 chimerism analysis15 was
performedforallpatientstreatedatStanford.Thisincludedthe11patientstreated
off-trial and 2 of the multi-institutional trial cohort patients. CLL MRD was
measured by immunoglobulin H (IgH) high-throughput sequencing using the
ClonoSeq test (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA).16,17
Immune phenotype analysis
Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis was carried out with cell staining
methods as described previously.18,19 After thawing cryopreserved peripheral
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples, cell suspensions were tested with the
LIVE/DEAD kit (Life Technologies, San Diego, CA) with at least 85% viability
after thawing. Cells were then washed and stained for 15 minutes with mixtures
of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against cell-surface marker proteins,
including CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD19, CD23, CD24, CD25, CD27, CD38,
CD45, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L, CCR7, CD127, CXCR5 (CD185), IgD,
IgM, Va24, and CD230. The 21 antibodies were measured in multiplex fashion,
with antibodies segregated by fluorochrome labels into 4 separate incubation
mixtures. A fifth incubation mixture was used to assess the levels of the
intracellular proteins T-bet, GATA3, and BCL-6. Following cell-surface
staining, PBMCs were washed and resuspended in 4% formaldehyde solution
for 2 to 16 hours at 4°C. Fixed PBMCs were then incubated in permeabilization
buffer (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and further incubated for 30 minutes with
antibodies against the intracellular proteins. All aforementioned antibodies were
obtained from BioLegend, except for the Va24 antibody, which was obtained
from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Flow cytometry data were acquired using an
LSRII flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ)
and analyzed using FlowJo (FlowJo, Ashland, Oregon).
Results
CLL trial cohort patient characteristics
A total of 16 patients from 4 ibrutinib clinical trials for relapsed CLL
hadundergonepriorallo-HCT(Table1;supplementalTable1).Median
patientagewas 54.5years (range,43-68),and11patients were male.Ten
of 16 patientshad a del17p chromosomal abnormality, and 3 patients had
a del11q chromosomal abnormality. Twelve of the 16 patients had
undergone 4 or more therapies prior to ibrutinib initiation. Ibrutinib was
initiated at a median time of 27 months posttransplant (range, 8-115).
Stanford Cohort patient characteristics
The Stanford cohort not treated as part of the trials described above
consisted of 11 patients (Table 1; supplemental Table 2). They relapsed
between 1 month and 8.5 years following reduced-intensity condi-
tioning allo-HCT with leukemic clonal progression quantified by
ClonoSeq. Ten of the 11 patients had pathological lymphadenopathy
progression. Biopsies confirmed CLL relapse, and Epstein-Barr virus
stains of biopsy samples were negative. Prior to the initiation of
ibrutinib, all patients failed to respond to immune suppression taper
and, in several cases, chemotherapy and/or donor lymphocyte infusion
(DLI).
Median patient age at time of ibrutinib initiation was 59.4 years
(range, 41-68), and 7 of 11 patients were male. Four patients had
a del17p chromosomal abnormality, and 4 patients had a del11q
chromosomal abnormality. Nine of the patients had undergone 4 or
more therapies prior to ibrutinib initiation. Ibrutinib was initiated at a
median time of 73.4 months posttransplant (range, 2.1-100.7).
CLL disease response and ibrutinib tolerability: CLL
trial patients
In the cohort of patients treated as part of multi-institutional clinical
trials, 15 patients with evaluable lymphadenopathy experienced
dramatic reduction in lymph node size, with an overall median
reduction of 88.6% (Figure 1A). In this cohort, there was an overall
response rate (ORR) of 87.5% (14 of 16 patients), as determined by
investigator-assessed responses (Figure 1B). None of the investigator-
assessed best responses were progressive disease. Two patients
achieved a complete response, 10 patients achieved a partial response,
and 2 patients had partial responses with lymphocytosis. One patient
had stable disease, and 1 patient with a del17p chromosomal
abnormality was not evaluable for response. The ORR response rate
was similar between all patientsassessed and the subset of patientswith
a del17p chromosomal abnormality, in which the ORR was 80%. The
24-monthprogression-freesurvivalandoverallsurvivalrateswereeach
77% (Figure 1C) and 75%, respectively.
Inthiscohort,mediandurationofibrutinib treatmentwas19months
(range, 0.4-39), and 14 patients were treated with ibrutinib for longer
than 12 months. No dose reductions were reported. At the time of data
cutoff, 11 patients were continuing treatment. Reasons for discontin-
uation included disease progression (n 5 2), AEs (n 5 2), and
withdrawal of consent (n 5 1).
The most common treatment-emergent AEs observed in these
clinical studies were diarrhea (n 5 11), upper respiratory tract infection

 (n 5 5), cough (n 5 5), contusion (n 5 5), and arthralgia (n 5 5)
(Figure 1D; supplemental Table 3). Treatment-emergent grade $3
severe AEs were observed in 12 patients(supplemental Table 4). These
severe AEs included pneumonia (n 5 2), 3 serious bleeding events
(subdural hematoma [n 5 1], perirenal hematoma [n 5 1],
postprocedural hemorrhage [n 5 1]), and the following additional
events (n 5 1 for each event): atrial flutter, bone lesion, bronchitis,
Campylobacter gastroenteritis, colitis, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia,
neutropenia, hematuria, herpes zoster, herpes zoster disseminated,
hypercalcemia, lymph gland infection, otitis externa, otitis media,
influenza pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, syncope, and urinary
retention. The only AE leading to discontinuation of ibrutinib was
pneumonia in 2 patients; both were fatal events (at 0.9 and 2.3 months).
Two additional deaths occurred on study due to disease progression at
24 and 28 months.
CLL disease response and ibrutinib tolerability:
Stanford cohort
Inthe11patientstreatedaspartoftheStanfordoff-trialcohort,theORR
was 91%. Seven patients (64%) achieved a complete response, 3
patients (27%) achieved a partial response, and 1 patient (9%) who had
initial response later developed progressive disease (supplemental
Table 2). The one patient who developed progressive disease
(SPN5435) died after 8 months of therapy. The higher ORR observed
in the Stanford cohort is likely due to a lower disease burden at time of
ibrutinib initiation, which was more proximal to post–allo-HCT
relapse, as ibrutinib had already been FDA approved.
The median duration of ibrutinib treatment in this cohort was
8.4 months (range, 0.5-21.4) with 6 patients continuing treatment. One
patient (SPN3873) discontinued ibrutinib due to drug intolerance
manifesting as a papular rash with pruritus and oral ulcers. All of these
symptoms resolved within 7 days of drug discontinuation, and the
patient did not have GVHD. Two additional patients died while on
ibrutinib despite achieving clinical benefit. One patient (SPN5919) had
active human herpesvirus 6 viremia at time of graft infusion and
succumbed to uncontrollable human herpesvirus 6 encephalitis (at
0.5 months of treatment, 3 months posttransplant). The second patient
(SPN5904) experienced sudden death (at 1.5 months of treatment,
5 months posttransplant); autopsy showed pericarditis and right atrial
thrombus and, notably, no lymphadenopathy. Other AEs experienced
in this patient cohort included fatigue (n 5 7), diarrhea (n 5 1), nausea
(n 5 1), and pericardial effusion (n 5 1).
Lymph node reduction
ForthepatientstreatedatStanfordwithlymphadenopathyandavailable
computed tomography scan assessment (n 5 8), there was an average
73% reduction in lymph node size after only 6 months of treatment
(supplemental Figure 1). One patient (SPN3431) presented at relapse
with a pelvic mass confirmed by core needle biopsy to be CLL. The
mass measured 16 cm by 13 cm and was eroding the pelvic bone
and compressing the patient’s vagina and uterus. Remarkably, within
7 months of ibrutinib treatment, she had undetectable CLL levels by
IgH high-throughput sequencing, and a computed tomography scan
at 9 months of ibrutinib treatment showed almost complete resolution
of the pelvic mass (supplemental Figure 2).
Ibrutinib post–allo-HCT achieves MRD negativity
Blood CLL burden was followed in 11 patients by ClonoSeq
(supplemental Table 2). Ibrutinib therapy achieved CLL MRD
negativity (,1 CLL clone per 10 000 white blood cells [WBCs]) in 4
patients (36%), with 3 of these patients achieving undetectablelevels of
CLL (,1 CLL clone per 1 million WBCs; Figure 2A-B,F). Ibrutinib
initiation was associated with a transient 1-log increase in peripheral
blood CLL with subsequent decrement (supplemental Figure 3). This
initial increase, most prominent in Figure 2B, is attributed to the
mobilization of CLL cells into the peripheral blood as previously
described.20,21
Remarkably, MRD negativity persisted following the discontinu-
ation of ibrutinib.Twopatients(SPN3975 and SPN3431;supplemental
Table 2) discontinued ibrutinib after their CLL levels became
undetectable, and both continue to have MRD ,0.01% up to 9 months
and 26 months, respectively, after discontinuation (Figure 2A-B). In
addition, patient SPN3873, who stopped ibrutinib due to drug
intolerance, continued to have decreasing CLL burden off ibrutinib
and achieved MRD negativity 18 months after discontinuation
(Figure 2D).
Favorable effects on donor chimerism
Donor chimerism levels were followed for all patients treated at
Stanford. CLL progression following allo-HCT is associated with

 mixed donor T-cell chimerism,22,23 and indeed, 9 patients treated at
Stanford had mixed chimerism–associated CLL relapse (range of CD3
donor chimerism at relapse, 8% to 95%). With ibrutinib initiation, 4 of
these patients (44%) converted from mixed to full donor chimerism
(shown in Figure 2A,C-E). Conversion required 5 to 11 months of
therapy. Specifically, SPN3975 had failed to maintain full donor CD3
chimerism after rituximab and 5 dose-escalated donor lymphocyte
infusions (dose range, 1 3 107 to 1 3 108 CD31 cells per kilogram
recipient weight) but after 1 year of ibrutinib treatment achieved full
donor chimerism (Figure 2A). Four patients relapsed following allo-
HCT despite having full donor chimerism.
No GVHD development
None of the 27 patients developed GVHD following initiation of
ibrutinib treatment. One patient who had developed oral and skin
chronic GVHD (cGVHD) following donor lymphocyte infusions
experienced full resolution of these cGVHD symptoms after 6 months
of ibrutinib treatment (Figure 2A).
Ibrutinib selectively targets pre–germinal center B cells and
depletes Th2 helper cells
We conducted blood immune phenotype characterization of PBMC
samples from 10 patients who were treated at Stanford; samples were
from 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following ibrutinib initiation.
Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis for the B- and T-cell
populations studied are shown in Figures 3A and 4A, respectively.
Analysis of the subsets of CD191 B-cell populations shows that
ibrutinib rapidly depleted CLL (CD51CD231) following an initial
brief peripheral increase (Figure 3B; supplemental Table 5). Ibrutinib
also depleted the CD191CD381CD271IgD1 cells, previously de-
scribed as pre–germinal center (pre-GC) B cells, which have been
shown to associate with cGVHD,24 with a statistically significant
decreased pre- to postibrutinib ratio after only 3 months of ibrutinib
treatment (P , .01). In contrast, CD191CD271IgD2CD382 isotype-
switched memory B cells persisted throughout ibrutinib therapy
(Figure 3B).
Analysis of the T-cell subpopulations showed that the absolute
number of CD31CD81 T cells was unchanged at an average of
490 cells/mL at 6 months of ibrutinib treatment (Figure 4B; sup-
plemental Table 6). In contrast, CD41 T cells were 50% reduced from
an average of 430/mL preibrutinib to an average of 210/mL by
6 months. Further analysis of the CD41 T cells shows a 75% reduction
of GATA3 expressing Th2 CD41 cells, while in contrast, there was no
significantchangeinthenumberofTbet-expressingTh1CD41cells.In
addition, initiation of ibrutinib caused a rapid depletion of CD41
CXCR51BCL61 follicular helper T (TFH) cells from circulation, with
none detected by 3 months (P , .01) (Figure 4B).

 Immune modulatory effects of ibrutinib persist after
treatment discontinuation
We conducted the same immune phenotype assessment of PBMC
samples from 3patientswhodiscontinued ibrutinib;samples were from
3, 6, and 12 months after ibrutinib discontinuation. These results
revealed that compared with preibrutinib treatment, the CD191CD381
CD271IgD1 pre-GC subpopulation remained depleted while the
CD191CD271IgD2CD382 memory B cell subpopulation persisted
following ibrutinib discontinuation (Figure 3C). Analysis of the T-cell
subpopulations after ibrutinib discontinuation revealed that compared
with preibrutinib samples, levels of GATA3 expressing Th2 CD41
cells remained unchanged, while in contrast, levels of Tbet-expressing
Th1 CD41 cells were relatively increased (Figure 4C).
Discussion
In total, ibrutinib provided effective and tolerable salvage therapy for
CLL relapse following allogeneic HCT. Here, we present 27 patients
who were treated with ibrutinib after CLL relapse following allo-HCT.
The large majority (81%) of the patients in the clinical trial cohort
had failed intervening salvage therapies posttransplant, including

 rituximab, combination chemotherapy, and DLI. Despite these
previous treatment failures, ibrutinib treatment provided an 87.5%
ORR. Furthermore, thisresponsewas persistent,withonly 3 additional
progressions occurring after the 24-month observation period. In the
Stanford cohort, there was similarly a 91% ORR. Our results contrast
those recently reported by Rozovoski et al in which the 2- and 5-year
survivalrates for patients withCLLdiseaseprogression following allo-
HCT were only 67% and 38%, respectively, demonstrating that the
majority of patients with progressive disease posttransplant have poor
long-term survival.2 They presented 5 patients treated with ibrutinib
who all had clinical responses and were alive after a median follow-up
duration of 16 months. Similarly Link et al recently reported that 5
post–allo-HCT CLL patients treated with ibrutinib salvage therapy
achieved partial responses with no relapse at 1 year of follow-up. One
patient achieved MRD negativity.13
Ibrutinib was tolerated with a safety profile similar to the one
observed in the overall population of patients with R/R CLL treated
with ibrutinib in the phase 3 clinical trial as part of the RESONATE
study. In thatcohort,57%of patients inthe ibrutinib grouphad atleast1
AE of grade 3 or higher.8 In our multi-institutional cohort of trial
patients who had undergone allo-HCT prior to ibrutinib initiation, 69%
of patients had at least 1 AE grade 3 or higher (11 of 16 patients). The
most common AEs in this cohort of trial patients post–allo-HCT were
diarrhea (69%), upper respiratory tract infection (31%), cough (31%),
arthralgia (31%), and contusion (31%). In the patients treated with
ibrutinib in the RESONATE study, these were also some of the most

 common AEs, occurring with similar frequency. Diarrhea occurred in
48%ofpatients,cough in19%,upperrespiratory tractinfectionin16%,
and arthralgia in 17%.8 Causes of ibrutinib discontinuation in the
Stanford off-trial cohort are similar to those listed in a report on patients
with R/R CLL treated with ibrutinib as part of the phase 2 or 3 clinical
trials who then discontinued ibrutinib. In that study, reported causes
included disease progression, a case of recurrent ulcers, and 2 cases of
sudden death.25 Overall, in comparison with alternative therapies, the
AEs are similar to, if not better than, those that would be expected for
those with combination chemotherapy, DLI, or even repeat transplant.
OurstudieswereinitiatedaftertheremarkableoutcomeofSPN3975,
the sixth patient to ever receive ibrutinib on the first clinical trial testing
ibrutinib (PCYC1102). Despite failure of multiple intervening CLL
therapies following relapse 1 year posttransplant (including oxaliplatin/
cytarabine/fludarabine/rituximab,26 dose-escalated rituximab, and
dose-escalated DLI), it was ibrutinib treatment that successfully led
to conversion of the T-cell compartment to full donor chimerism and
achieved undetectable CLL levels (Figure 2A).27 In this index patient,

setting, which are evident in our cohort of Stanford patients. First,
patients treated with ibrutinib have achieved complete response in
association with conversion to full donor T-cell chimerism conversion
(44%). Second, ibrutinib achieved CLL MRD negativity in 4 patients
(36%). Third, MRD ,0.01% persisted even after ibrutinib was
discontinued, in 1 case even after 26 months.
We postulate that ibrutinib is achieving sustained GVL augmen-
tation through a T-cell–mediated effect due to ibrutinib inhibition of
ITK activity. Both Th1 and Th2 cells rely on ITK signaling. However,

From 
 inTh1cells,restinglymphocytekinaseprovidesanadditionalsignaling
pathway that theoretically rescues the Th1 cells from the ibrutinib-
induced ITK inhibition, leading to disproportionate effects on Th2
cells.12 Previous studies investigated the effects of ibrutinib on Th1 and
Th2 subpopulations via analysis of cytokines in primary samples of
patients treated withibrutinib.Onestudy reported an observed decrease
in serum Th2-type cytokines, including IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13,12
and another similarly showed a decrease in IL-10 levels following
treatment.13
Here, we report for the first time comprehensive immune
phenotype of B and T cells using primary samples from patients
with CLL treated with ibrutinib following allo-HCT. Our results
show that ibrutinib leads to dramatic depletion of Th2 cells. This
subpopulation is decreased as early as 3 months after ibrutinib
initiation and continues to decrease with continued treatment
(Figure 3B). On the other hand, the Th1 subpopulation and
cytotoxic CD81 T cells persist without any evidence of depletion.
Thus, our results provide evidence that ibrutinib may augment the
GVL effect through persistence of the Th1 and cytotoxic CD81
T-cell populations, resulting in CLL MRD eradication. Ibrutinib
efficacy in the post–allo-HCT setting suggestive of augmented
GVL effect has previously been reported in 2 patients with
refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma.28 A recent study in a MCL
mouse xenograft model similarly demonstrated the role of ibrutinib
in augmenting antitumor activity. The addition of ibrutinib to anti-
CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells led to enhanced MCL
killing and higher rates of long-term remission.29 A pilot trial is
now underway to assess the efficacy of combining ibrutinib with
anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells to treat R/R CLL (NCT
02640209).
An emerging hypothesis for the mechanism of ibrutinib-mediated
GVL benefit is that ibrutinib effectively disrupts the CLL tumor
microenvironment and reduces T-cell pseudoexhaustion.30,31 Studies
have shown that CD81T cells from patients with CLL exhibita stateof
acquired dysfunction with defects in proliferation and cytotoxicity.32
This exhaustion is thought to develop from chronic activation, similar
to the phenomenon observed in chronic viral infections. Direct contact
between T cells and tumor cells from patients with CLL induces
defective actin polymerization and subsequent immunological syn-
apse formation, which can impair cytotoxicity.33,34 Recent studies of
primary samples from patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib show
that ibrutinib may decrease chronic T-cell activation, as evidenced by a
decrease in the activation markers HLA-DR and CD39.30 Decreased
PD-1 surface expression was also observed, and it has been shown that
the combination of ibrutinib and either anti–PD-L1 antibodies or
intratumoral CpG injection enhances antitumor responses,35,36 sug-
gesting that increased T-cell activation is critically important. Another
recent study investigating the effect of ibrutinib on chimeric antigen
receptor–expressing T cells demonstrated that defects in T-cell
proliferation and activation were improved after 5 to 11 cycles of
ibrutinib therapy.37 Thus, it is possible that direct elimination of CLL
through ibrutinib Bruton’s tyrosine kinase targeting reduces T-cell
exhaustion, leading to more effective T-cell immunity.
Remarkably, these GVL effects are accomplished in the absence of
GVHD. None of the 27 patients treated as part of this study developed
GVHD. Many of the therapies given to CLL patients who relapse
following allo-HCT, including DLI, lead to an increased risk of
GVHD.38 Notably, 1 patient in this study (SPN3975) who had
persistent cGVHD prior to ibrutinib initiation experienced full
resolution of cGHVD symptoms within 6 months of treatment. In
murine studies, ibrutinib has already been shown to improve clinical
and pathological manifestations of cGHVD.39
Our multiparameter flow-cytometric analyses provide insight into
identifying the possible mechanisms by which ibrutinib affects the
processofGVHDdevelopment.Ibrutinibtargetspre-GCBcells,which
have been shown to associate with cGVHD, and causes rapid depletion
of CD41CXCR51BCL61 TFH cells from the circulation (Figure 4B).
TFH cells play an important role in B-cell activation,40 and much of our
group’s previously published work has shown the critical role that
B cells, and specifically antibodies to HY antigens, play in the
development of GVHD.19,41,42 Recent studies specifically linked TFH
cells to the promotion of B cell involvement in cGVHD.43 Depletion of
both pre-GC B cells and TFH cells may thus contribute to protection
against GVHD development. The efficacy of ibrutinib in treating
cGHVD requires further investigation, and a phase 1/2 clinical trial of
ibrutinib treatment of patients with cGVHD who have failed therapy
with corticosteroids is underway to assess this area of therapeutic
potential (NCT #02195869).
Limitations to this study include the heterogeneity of the patient
population. All patients had received a wide range of previous
therapies and started ibrutinib therapy at various intervals
following both allo-HCT and relapse post–allo-HCT. Furthermore,
while we have proposed that ibrutinib augments GVL benefit
through Th2 subversion and enhancement of cytotoxic CD81 T-
cell activity, we have not interrogated these mechanisms directly.
Ongoing studies of mixed-lymphocyte reactions with patient
T cells against primary CLL before and after ibrutinib exposure
will provide further elucidation.
Although it has been reported that ibrutinib monotherapy for CLL
rarely achieves MRD negativity,9,44 4 patients in this study achieved
MRDnegativitywithibrutinibtreatment.The factthatibrutinib leadsto
MRD negativity in the post–allo-HCT setting, but not as initial
monotherapy pretransplant, suggests that ibrutinib-related enhance-
ment of the GVL effect in the posttransplant setting contributes to the
achievement of MRD negativity. In analyzing those patients in our
study who achieved MRD negativity versus those who did not, we
explored factors that would have an impact on alloimmunity, including
preceding use of rituximab or DLI, tapering of immune suppressive
medications following ibrutinib initiation, and development of
full donor chimerism. However, our patient sample size was unfortu-
nately too small to observe any correlations or make any conclusions
regarding which factors may be augmenting the efficacy of ibrutinib in
theposttransplantsetting.Thiswillbethegroundworkforfuturestudies
that continue to investigate the mechanisms by which ibrutinib
mediates both effective suppression of CLL and Th2 T cells and
enhancement of the donor Th1 T-cell–mediated GVL benefit.
