Background.—While migraines have been associated with emotional disturbances, it remains unknown whether the
intensity of emotional expression is directly related to migraine frequency.
Objective.—The present study investigated depression/anxiety among migraineurs.
Methods.—This cross-sectional study included 588 clinical outpatients in Taiwan. Migraines were stratified by attack
frequency, with and without auras, and with well-controlled confounding variables. Demographic and clinical data, includ-
ing sleep characteristics, were collected. Multivariable linear regressions were employed to examine whether migraine fre-
quency (1-4 headache days per month, 5-8 headache days per month, 9-14 headache days per month, or >14 headache days
per month) was associated with depression/anxiety symptoms, as indicated by the Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI) and
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Subscales (HADS).
Results.—BDI total scores were highest in patients with chronic migraines (mean 6 SD: 13.2 6 8.5), followed by those
with high frequency (12.1 6 8.5), medium frequency (10.6 6 8.0), low frequency (9.1 6 7.1), and lowest in nonmigraine con-
trols (6.6 6 5.9), with a significant trend in frequency (P trend< .001); similar results were obtained for HADS scores. BDI
and HADS scores were independently related to high-frequency episodic and chronic migraine frequency and to poor sleep
quality. The relationship between BDI score and migraine frequency was present in both aura-present (P trend 5 .001) and
aura-absent subgroups (P trend 5 .029).
Conclusion.—Higher migraine frequency, either with or without auras, correlated with higher symptom scores of anxi-
ety and depression.

 INTRODUCTION
Headache, a common somatic problem, can
result in emotional distress and disruption of daily
life. The World Health Organization has recognized
primary headache disorders, including migraines, as
important public health issues owing to their high
prevalence,
wide
demographic
distribution,
and
important functional and socioeconomic implica-
tions.1 The most common comorbidities in patients
with migraines are anxiety and depression,2 fol-
lowed by sleep disturbances.3,4 These disorders are
reported to be contributory factors in triggering
migraines, but may also be due to recurrent, severe
migraine attacks.5
The association of depression and anxiety with
headache depends more on headache frequency than
diagnostic category (eg, migraine or tension-type
headaches).6 Furthermore, headache frequency is an
important predictor of health-related quality of life.7
Affective comorbidities increase migraine-associated
health care costs and utilization,8 worsen quality of
life, and can lead to disability.9 Migraineurs tend to
experience heightened anxiety and emotional stress
as well as disturbed contentment, vitality, and sleep,
even during headache-free periods during which
there is fear of impending attacks.10 Interestingly,
women who suffer from migraines with auras suffer
from depression and anxiety more frequently than
those without auras.11
There
may
be
a
bidirectional
association
between depression, migraines,12 and headache char-
acteristics, including frequency, as these factors tend
to have a strong influence on anxiety and depression
symptoms, as well as on quality of life.13 Migraineurs
are also more likely to suffer from comorbid depres-
sion and anxiety than either comorbidity alone.14
Moreover, increased migraine frequency is associ-
ated with an increased risk of mood/anxiety disor-
ders.15 However, the linear correlation between
migraine frequency and mood/anxiety disorders is
still not clear. It is not distinguished by grouping fre-
quency of migraine attacks, whether it is associated
with severity scores of depression and anxiety, and
with
or
without
aura
compared
to
controlled
subjects.
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis
that
migraine
frequency
may
be
predictive
of
depression/anxiety severity, regardless of the pres-
ence of auras. Specifically, we evaluated the rela-
tionship between severity of depression/anxiety and
migraine frequency while controlling for potentially
confounding factors (eg, sleep quality, employment,
education, smoking status, and alcohol and coffee
consumption).
METHODS
Patients.—This cross-sectional study enrolled 623
subjects that attended an outpatient headache clinic
in the Department of Neurology at Tri-Service
General Hospital (TSGH) between June 2014 and
May 2016. The current study expanded the dataset
on which we previously published two articles on
migraineurs in association with restless legs syn-
drome16 and sleep quality.4 Patients suffering from
migraines,
both
with
and
without
auras,
were
enrolled after providing informed consent according
to the criteria of the International Headache Soci-
ety.17 The study protocol received approval from the
Institutional Review Board of TSGH. After exclud-
ing
patients
with
medication
overuse
headache
(MOH), those with insufficient data to determine
migraine frequency, and those with missing informa-
tion on clinical characteristics, a total of 588 subjects
were
finally
included
for
the
analysis.

the patients that participated in this study, 65 sub-
jects suffered from chronic migraines (�15 headache
days/month

 months). In addition, 179 nonmigraine volunteers
were selected with the following criteria: no family
history of migraines and no previous diagnosis of
other primary or secondary headache disorders,
except for infrequent episodic tension-type head-
aches
(<6
days/year).
Subjects
who
completed
the screening questionnaire were interviewed by a
board-certified neurologist and headache specialist
(F-CY) to confirm the diagnosis of migraines and
to exclude emotion-related headaches, as deter-
mined according to the International Classification
of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version).17
The
sample
size
determination
was
calculated
according to a previous study,18 which investigated
the correlation between Beck’s Depression Inven-
tory (BDI)19 scores and migraine frequency in 179
women. The mean scores were 15.1 (SD 5 12.4),
18.7 (SD 5 11.3), and 21.2 (SD 5 11.1) in the 53
controls, 37 episodic migraineurs, and 89 chronic
migraineurs, respectively. With a pooled standard
deviation
of
19.1,
we
obtained
an
effect
size
(Cohen’s f) of 0.138. Given the alpha of 0.05 and
power of 0.80, a minimum sample size of 510 was
required. We conducted a power analysis for an F
test (analysis of variance).
Psychometrics.—Patients were interviewed with a
structured
questionnaire
packet
containing
the
BDI,19 the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Sub-
scales (HADS),20 a restless legs syndrome (RLS)
screening questionnaire from the RLS Foundation,
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),21 and
the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire
(MIDAS). Patients who scored �18 on the BDI
(maximum score 5 63) were classified as depressed.
The HADS is a 14-item scale, with seven items
related to anxiety and seven items related to depres-
sion. Each item is rated on a four-point scale (0, not
at all; 1, sometimes; 2, often; and 3, all the time),
giving a maximum subscale score of 21. The PSQI
estimates sleep quality over the prior month. A
PSQI final score of 6 was considered indicative of
poor sleep. Participants who answered ‘‘yes’’ to at
least 6/11 RLS symptoms screening questionnaire
items were considered to have a high probability of
RLS. The MIDAS, a five-item questionnaire, evalu-
ates disability over the previous 3 months. We use
two tools, BDI and HADS, for the depression sever-
ity assessment. We also expected to detect the criti-
cal point of depression early, and help with early
diagnosis, particularly to prevent possible suicidal
behavior.
Data Analysis.—Data are reported as means 6
standard deviations (SDs) of continuous variables
or as numbers and proportions of categorical varia-
bles. Patients with migraines were classified into
four ordinal migraine frequency groups (described
above). Linear trends in the distributions of subject
characteristics were assessed across the migraine
and nonmigraine control group using the Cochran-
Armitage chi-square test for categorical variables
or a linear contrast of univariate linear regression
for continuous variables. To investigate the effect
of migraine frequency on BDI and HADS scores,
we performed tests of linear contrast in multivari-
able linear regression analyses with adjustments for
gender, age, body mass index (BMI), education,
employment, smoking status, alcohol consumption,
coffee consumption, and PSQI score. This analysis
was stratified for migraines with versus without
auras. Finally, we carried out multivariable linear
regression analyses to explore factors associated
with BDI and HADS scores. Data analysis was
conducted using SPSS 22 (IBM SPSS, Armonk,
NY: IBM Corp). The statistical significance was set
as alpha 5 0.05.
RESULTS
Subject Characteristics.—Demographic and clini-
cal characteristics of the nonmigraine control and
migraine groups are presented as the observational
data and summarized in Table 1. Among the 409
subjects with migraines, 129 (31.5%) reported expe-
riencing
preattack
auras.
No
group
associated
trends in distribution of auras, gender, age, BMI,
employment, alcohol consumption, or coffee con-
sumption emerged. Moreover, higher frequency of
migraine attacks correlated with higher scores on
the MIDAS, PSQI, and BDI, as well as higher sub-
scores on the anxiety and depression portions of
the HADS (all P < .001). Subjects with chronic
migraines (�15 hd/months) were slightly less edu-
cated than the other groups (P 5 .044) and subjects
Headache

 in the nonmigraine control group were less likely to
smoke
than
subjects
in
the
migraine
groups
(P 5 .001).
Effect of Migraine Frequency on BDI and HADS
Scores.—BDI and HADS score data derived from
multivariable linear regression analysis are reported
in Table 2 and associated means are shown in
Figure 1. Trend tests indicated that migraine fre-
quency
was
associated
with
BDI
total
score
(P 5 .001), as well as HADS anxiety (P 5 .002)
and depression (P < .001) subscores after adjusting
for subject characteristics. These associations per-
sisted regardless of the presence or absence of
auras.
Factors
Associated
with
BDI
and
HADS
Scores.—The results of multivariable linear regres-
sion analyses investigating factors associated with
BDI and HADS scores are reported in Table 3.
Subjects in all four migraine groups had higher
BDI and HADS scores than the nonmigraine control
group, with the exception of the HADS depression
subscore comparison between the 5-8 hd/months and
nonmigraine control groups (P 5 .052). Poor sleep
quality (PSQI total score � 6) was also associated
with high BDI and HADS scores. In addition, alco-
hol consumption emerged as an independent factor
of BDI total score (P 5 .035).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that the severity of
depression (BDI and HADS depression scores) and
anxiety (HADS anxiety score) were related to
migraine frequency, after adjusting for gender, age,
BMI,
employment,
education,
smoking,
alcohol
consumption, coffee consumption, MIDAS score,
and PSQI total score. These correlations were

of
patients
who
had
migraines with or without auras. For all three mea-
sures, group mean scores were highest for the
chronic frequency group. We did not see any signif-
icant gender-related differences.11
Our finding of a positive relationship between
increased migraine frequency, with or without auras,
and depression and anxiety is consistent with prior
findings.11 Moreover, the mean BDI score for our
nonmigraine
control
group
was
similar
to
that
reported by studies conducted in Germany22 and
Taiwan.4 Although we ruled out the presence of
emotion-induced headache23 in this study, it remains
to be determined whether recurrent headaches may
be a manifestation of emotional disturbance.
Previous studies have suggested a positive
relationship
between
headache
frequency
in
migraineurs and the presence of depression and
anxiety,9 but without grouping the number of days
with migraine attacks, the presence of aura, and
comparison to nonmigraine control subjects. Thus,
we employed narrower bins of attack frequency

 differentiation (1-4, 5-8, 9-14, and �15 hd/months).
This work also differs from prior studies in that
we included a nonmigraine control group and
accounted for potential confounding factors, such
as alcohol consumption, employment, and sleep
quality. We found that migraineurs who smoked
and, to a lesser extent, who attained higher levels
of education, tended to have higher migraine fre-
quencies. The suggested influence of smoking on
migraines is consistent with a prior cross-sectional
population study that reported higher prevalence
of headaches among smokers than nonsmokers.24
Our present finding that poor sleep was associ-
ated with greater migraine frequency is also consis-
tent
with
prior
work
showing
that
migraine
frequency correlates with poor sleep quality and a
higher prevalence of sleep difficulties.4 Additionally,
after adjusting for baseline characteristics, our multi-
variate factor analysis indicated that sleep quality
may be an independent predictor of emotional dis-
tress. Thus, the effects of poor sleep quality on
migraine-related variables appeared independent to
the presence of affective comorbidities.25
Factors such as emotional distress and inci-
dence of headache may influence each other via
some common pathophysiological mechanism. First,
pain severity has been shown to correlate with emo-
tion
intensity.26
More
specifically,
emotional
responses have the potential to alter pain perception
by modulating nociceptive signaling in the descend-
ing pain pathway.27 The periaqueductal gray, which
controls descending pain modulation, projects to
serotonergic neurons in the medulla as well as to
noradrenergic neurons in the pons and tegmentum.28
Central serotonin activity may become diminished
when
a
person
experiences
successive
migraine
attacks, which may predispose one to recurrent head-
aches; moreover, the resultant low serotonin concen-
trations may lead to a decline in pain perception
threshold.29 Second, a recent meta-analysis confirmed
that patients with chronic pain have an elevated risk
of developing depression.30 Third, the pathophysiol-
ogy of migraine encompasses activation of the trige-
minovascular pathway via pain signals initiated in
peripheral intracranial nociceptors, and a dysfunction
of central regulation of neural excitability and pain.31

 Central monoaminergic disturbances appear to be
common
to
migraine
and
depression/anxiety.32
Reduced systemic serotonin levels have been detected
in migraineurs during and between attacks.33 Further,
it has been suggested that migraines may be caused
by a dopamine-noradrenalin imbalance in pain matrix
neurons due to aberrant tyrosine metabolism.34 The
central
monoaminergic
dysfunction
model
of
migraines has led to antidepressant prophylactic treat-
ment.35
Central
sensitization
and
hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation have also been
implicated in both migraine and affective disorders.36
Interestingly, migraines with auras, comorbid with
anxiety disorders and major depression, have been
associated with the NcoI polymorphism in the DRD2
gene.37 Regardless of whether a common pathogene-
sis underlies migraines and depression/anxiety, the
current literature suggests that mood and anxiety dis-
orders may worsen migraines, while poorly controlled
migraines may exacerbate emotional problems.
An interrelationship between migraines and
emotional distress has also been described in ado-
lescents and children.38 Notably, recurrent head-
aches have been linked with anxiety and depression
in early adolescence,39 and children who have head-
aches have an increased risk of developing serious
depressive symptoms.40 Sleep and mood disorders
are also common in adolescents with migraines, and
teenagers with chronic migraine are particularly
prone to dysthymia and sleep issues.29
This
study
had
several
strengths,
which
included its controlled study design, large number
of subjects, demographically similar groups, differ-
entiated subgroups, use of validated questionnaires,
consideration of sleep quality and RLS, analysis of
migraine subgroups (with or without auras), and
robust statistical analysis. However, this study had
several limitations worth mentioning. First, the use
of a cross-sectional design limited our ability to
make causal inferences. Second, the use of study
population from a department within a single hospi-
tal limits the broad generalizability of our findings.
Third, emotional symptoms were evaluated with
self-rated
scales
rather
than
with
an
objective
assessment. Furthermore, all subjects completed the
screening questionnaire and were interviewed by a
board-certified neurologist and headache specialist
regarding the migraine attacks. Despite this evalua-
tion process, there might be a few nonmigraine
headaches not distinguished from migraine attacks.
Additionally,
there were fewer subjects
in the
chronic migraine group than in other migraine
groups.
Thus,
future
studies
should
focus
on
increasing the recruitment of patients with chronic
migraines. In addition, in the present study, the
control group included individuals with infrequent
episodic
tension-type
headaches
(<6
days/year)
defined according to the International Classification
of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta ver-
sion).17 A previous study suggests that tension-type
headache is associated with psychiatric disorders,
including anxiety and depression, especially in indi-
viduals with a high frequency of headache epi-
sodes.41 However, infrequent episodic tension-type
headaches may have less impact on psychiatric dis-
orders. In this study, out of 179 nonmigraine sub-
jects,
20
had
infrequent
episodic
tension-type
headaches. We will try to exclude this population in
the future to maintain homogeneity in the control
group. Another limitation of our study is that most
participants
with
high
frequencies
and
chronic
headaches had been prescribed migraine preventing
agents,
such
as
calcium
channel
blockers,
b-blockers, antiepileptic drugs, or even antidepres-
sants. All these preventive medications may have
effects on depression or anxiety. But for the maxi-
mal benefit of participants, we used the preventive
intervention to improve their quality of life. In the
future, we will take that into consideration and
exclude this confounding problem.
In conclusion, the present findings support the
hypothesis that greater migraine frequency, with or
without auras, is associated with increased symptom
scores of anxiety and depression. Poor sleep qual-
ity, as indicated by the PSQI score, was also found
to be an independent predictor of more severe
depression and anxiety symptoms. Taken together,
these findings suggest that preventive pharmacolog-
ical treatments may reduce the risk of depression
and anxiety problems in migraineurs.
