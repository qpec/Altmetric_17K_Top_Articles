Neighborhood influences in the etiology of schizophrenia have been emphasized in a number of systematic reviews, but causality
remains uncertain. To test the social drift hypothesis, we used three complementary genetically informed Swedish cohorts. First, we
used nationwide Swedish data on approximately 760 000 full- and half-sibling pairs born between 1951 and 1974 and quantitative
genetic models to study genetic and environmental influences on the overlap between schizophrenia in young adulthood and
subsequent residence in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods. Schizophrenia diagnoses were ascertained using the National
Patient Registry. Second, we tested the overlap between childhood psychotic experiences and neighborhood deprivation in early
adulthood in the longitudinal Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development (TCHAD; n = 2960). Third, we investigated to what
extent polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia predicted residence in deprived neighborhoods during late adulthood using the
TwinGene sample (n = 6796). Sibling data suggested that living in deprived neighborhoods was substantially heritable; 65% (95%
confidence interval (95% CI): 60–71%) of the variance was attributed to genetic influences. Although the correlation between
schizophrenia and neighborhood deprivation was moderate in magnitude (r = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.20–0.24), it was entirely explained by
genetic influences. We replicated these findings in the TCHAD sample. Moreover, the association between polygenic risk for
schizophrenia and neighborhood deprivation was statistically significant (R2 = 0.15%, P = 0.002). Our findings are primarily
consistent with a genetic selection interpretation where genetic liability for schizophrenia also predicts subsequent residence in
socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods. Previous studies may have overemphasized the relative importance of environmental
influences in the social drift of schizophrenia patients. Clinical and policy interventions will therefore benefit from the future
identification of potentially causal pathways between different dimensions of cognitive functions and socioeconomic trajectories
derived from studies adopting family-based research designs.

INTRODUCTION
The pioneering work of Faris and Dunham1 in the late 1930s found
increased incidence of schizophrenia in socially disorganized
residential areas characterized by high rates of poverty, marital
instability, residential mobility, and ethnic heterogeneity. Despite
considerable efforts to understand the nature of this ecological
association, its potential causal mechanisms (both in terms of the
direction of the effects as well as the underlying etiology) remain
largely uncertain.
Proponents of the social causation interpretation have pro-
posed a number of hypotheses postulating that the development
of schizophrenia results from early exposure to adverse neighbor-
hood stressors, accumulated over time, particularly in individuals
with genetic liabilities.2–5 In contrast, the drift interpretation
suggests that the association goes in the opposite direction;
namely that psychotic patients tend to gradually undergo
downward social mobility (or to ‘drift’) into deprived neighborhoods
following employment difficulties associated with experiencing
psychotic-like symptoms and declining cognitive functioning.6,7
Systematic reviews have generally claimed support for the
social causation interpretation.8,9 However, the evidence is limited
and inconclusive; most of the findings are either based on small
and selected clinical samples, ecological study designs with
inadequate
adjustment
for
individual-level
confounders
or
population-based studies with genetically uninformed designs.
Large-scale,
eco-epidemiological
studies
that
simultaneously
account for individual, familial and social contextual determinants
are therefore integral in clarifying underlying mechanisms.10,11
The only genetically informed study using nationwide longitudinal
registry data failed to support the causal interpretation; the
authors concluded that familial confounding fully explained the
impact of neighborhood characteristics (for example, deprivation
and urbanicity), measured from birth up to adolescence, on later
schizophrenia.12
Much less is known about the magnitude and etiology of drift
mechanisms in patients with schizophrenia. Quantitative and
molecular genetic studies have consistently found that indicators
of socioeconomic status are considerably influenced by genetic
influences.13 Notably, a recent Scottish twin study14 estimated the
heritability of deprived neighborhood residence to 71% (95%
confidence interval: 69–73%), which is similar in magnitude to that
of schizophrenia.15 What remains unknown is to what degree the

 genetic influences that contribute to the liability of schizophrenia
overlap with those of neighborhood deprivation. In contrast to
studies on poor social functioning outcomes in individuals with
schizophrenia that tend to focus on environmental explanations
(for example, marked changes to social policy and socioeconomic
disparities),16–20 a shared genetic etiology between schizophrenia
and socioeconomic deprivation would imply that such associa-
tions are, at least partly, due to genetic confounding.
We adopted multiple genetically informed designs to address
the following aims:
1. To estimate the contributions of genetic and environmental
influences on adulthood deprived neighborhood residence.
2. To estimate such influences on the overlap between schizo-
phrenia and subsequent residence in deprived neighborhoods.
3. To explore the association between subclinical measures of
psychotic experiences during childhood and adolescence with
neighborhood deprivation during early adulthood.
4. To examine whether polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia
predict neighborhood deprivation in late adulthood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sibling study
Swedish nationwide registries.
Statistics Sweden maintains all nationwide
Swedish longitudinal registries with routinely gathered governmental data.
Individual data can be linked across registers via a unique civic registration
number assigned to all Swedish residents at birth or upon immigration. To
ensure confidentiality, we were granted access to anonymized data after
approval from the Regional Research Ethics Committee at Karolinska
Institutet.
We used the Total Population Register to identify all individuals born in
Sweden between 1951 and 1974 and linked their data with the Multi-
Generation Register to identify all biological full and half siblings in the
sample and generate family pedigree structures. Censoring information on
mortality and migration dates was obtained from the Cause of Death and
Migration Registries, respectively. We identified individuals with hospital
discharges and associated schizophrenia diagnoses using the National
Patient Register that encompasses data on psychiatric inpatient care since
1973 (ICD-8, -9 and -10) as well as specialist (non-general practitioner)
outpatient care since 2001 (ICD-10). The Small Area Marketing Statistics
Register provided data on annual neighborhood residence between 1982
and 2009. Neighborhood characteristics data were aggregated from the
Total Population Register, census registries, as well as the National Crime
Register, which includes all criminal convictions in lower general court in
Sweden since 1973.
Subjects.
Between 1951 and 1974, a total of 2 628 631 live births that
could be linked to two biological parents were registered in Sweden. We
excluded individuals who died (n = 41 440) or emigrated (n = 163 868)
before age 35 years to have sufficient follow-up time. Further, we excluded
those who could not be assigned to residential areas between ages 31 to
35 (n = 37 315) resulting in a sample of 90.8 percent (n = 2 386 008) of the
original cohort. From this population sample, we subsequently identified
all
biological
full
siblings
(n = 1 615 719),
maternal
half
siblings
(n = 232 720) and paternal half siblings (n = 279 758). In families with
multiple offspring, we selected the oldest two siblings born within 5 years
from one another to reduce bias due to violation of the equal environment
assumption for siblings in our analyses. The final sample included 759 536
sibling pairs (592 009 full-sibling pairs, 68 684 maternal half-sibling pairs
and 82 913 paternal half-sibling pairs).
Measures
Schizophrenia.
We defined study participants as having schizophrenia if
they had been hospitalized with any diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD-8/9:
295; ICD-10: F20) on at least two separate occasions, irrespective of any
psychiatric comorbidity, before age 31 years. Although single-episode
hospitalizations of schizophrenia have been validated in the Swedish
Patient Registry;21 this stricter definition is commonly used to increase
diagnostic precision by minimizing the risk of obtaining false-positive
cases.15
Neighborhood deprivation.
We defined neighborhoods according to the
Small Area Marketing Statistics classification system that delineates very
small and socioeconomically homogenous residential areas,22,23 Annual
neighborhood deprivation scores were generated on the basis of the
following aggregated indicators; proportion of residents aged 25–64 years
with no secondary school qualifications, immigrant status, divorced and
the neighborhood crime rate.12 Despite Sweden’s comprehensive welfare
policies, previous studies suggest stark socioeconomic differences22,24 and
the occurrence of psychotic disorders has been found to be strongly
nonlinearly distributed across neighborhoods with the highest concentra-
tions being observed in the most deprived areas.12,25 To account for such
nonlinear effects, we used a binary measure indicating whether the study
participant had ever resided in a deprived neighborhood, defined as the
95th percentile of the continuous distribution, between ages 31 and 35. A
total of 260 957 study participants, corresponding to approximately 11
percent of the sample, fulfilled this criterion.
Analyses
Sibling models.
In our initial analyses, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) for
living in a deprived neighborhood in siblings of a proband with
schizophrenia compared with sibling of an individual without schizo-
phrenia using the binary logistic regression model. For genetically
influenced traits, larger ORs for full rather than half siblings are expected
given that they share on average 50 and 25 percent of their co-segregating
genes, respectively. Similarly, for traits to be influenced by shared
childhood environmental factors, we expected the ORs for maternal half
siblings to be larger than those for paternal half siblings owing to the
assumption that the former share their childhood environment to a
substantially greater extent.26
Quantitative genetic sibling models.
We subsequently fitted univariate,
quantitative genetic structural equation models27 that explicitly estimate
the relative importance of three sources of variation in schizophrenia and
neighborhood deprivation; additive genetic effects, shared environmental
effects and unique environmental effects, the latter of which also includes
measurement error. We estimated these sources of variation by constrain-
ing sibling correlations in the variance components to their expected
values; additive genetic correlations between full siblings was set to 0.5
and half siblings to 0.25, respectively, while the shared environmental
correlation was set to 1.0 for full siblings, 0.83 for maternal half siblings and
0.03 for paternal half siblings. The latter two assumptions were empirically
chosen on the basis of a study demonstrating that 83 percent of maternal
half siblings and 3 percent of paternal half siblings were registered to live
in the same household in the 1960–1990 Swedish national censuses.28 We
accounted for potential gender and cohort effects by adjusting for sex and
birth year as covariates in all the models.
By implementing the Cholesky decomposition method,29 we estimated
the bivariate correlation between schizophrenia and neighborhood
deprivation and stratified the correlation by genetic and environmental
influences. We additionally specified a liability-threshold model to account
for the binary nature of our phenotypes30 but relaxed the equal thresholds
assumption because we observed differences in the prevalence of the
phenotypes between full and half siblings. All the models were fitted in R/
OpenMx 1.3.31
The twin study
Subjects.
The
TCHAD
(Twin
Study
of
Child
and
Adolescent
Development)32 is a population-based longitudinal twin study including
all twins born in Sweden between May 1985 and December 1986 who
were alive and Swedish residents at the end of 1994 (n = 2960). The study
participants and their parents were surveyed via mailed questionnaires at
three different time points (1994, 1999 and 2002). We excluded study
participants whose parents had decided not to participate and those who
lacked information on their residential areas in adulthood (n = 240).
Although
participation
rates were
substantially
lower in
ethnically
heterogeneous residential areas, the attrition rates at follow-up did not
vary by reported psychotic symptoms.33 The final sample included 1355
twin pairs, distributed over 533 monozygotic twin pairs and 822 dizygotic
twin pairs. The determination of zygosity was based on a validated
algorithm derived from questionnaire data measuring the physical

 similarities between the twins as well as the extent to which others tend to
confuse them for one another.32
Measures
Psychotic experiences.
We classified children whose parents reported that
their child had experienced auditory hallucinations according to the Child
Behavior Checklist anytime throughout the studied period as having had
psychotic experiences.34 Measures of auditory hallucinations, especially
when reported by parents,35 have been found to strongly predict
psychotic experiences in general.36
Neighborhood deprivation.
Neighborhood deprivation was measured
during 2 years (2008 and 2009) for the TCHAD sample and using a wider
definition (75th percentile) owing to the small sample size and relatively
fewer participants from the most deprived neighborhoods.
Analyses.
Quantitative genetic twin models
We fitted quantitative genetic models to the TCHAD data equivalent to
those used for siblings as described above. Genetic correlations between
monozygotic and dizygotic twins were set to 1.0 and 0.5, respectively, and
we assumed that both groups shared childhood environments with their
co-twins.
Polygenic risk scores
Subjects and genotyping.
The TwinGene study includes a total of 22 390
twins born 1958 or earlier, invited to participate between 2004 and 2008.
Overall, 12 614 twins (56.3%) consented to participate and donated blood
samples, which were genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpress chip
containing probes for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The details
on the data collection procedures have been described elsewhere.37 One
twin from each pair was randomly selected for inclusion to yield a data set
of 6796 unrelated individuals, avoiding potential biases from analyses of
genetically correlated subjects.
Measures
Neighborhood deprivation.
Owing to the TwinGene study design, the
study participants were increasingly economically affluent and healthy as
compared with population controls. Therefore, we decided to study the
relative differences in their exposure to neighborhood deprivation by
averaging their continuous deprivation scores between 1999 and 2004.
Analysis
The discovery SNP set was generated from the results of the genome-wide
association
study
of
schizophrenia
from
the
Psychiatric
Genomics
Consortium38 and comprised 97 046 SNPs in relative linkage equilibrium.
The weightings for each SNP based on the strength of its association in the
discovery genome-wide association study were applied to the target
sample, TwinGene, to calculate aggregated polygenic risk scores for each
subject using PLINK v1.07.39 The scores were generated for P-value
thresholds from 0.01 to 1. We fitted linear regression models to assess the
proportion of variance in neighborhood deprivation attributed to the
polygenic risk scores, incorporating 10 principal components accounting
for population substructure and estimated the R2 by subtracting the effects
due to the covariates alone.
RESULTS
We estimated that 0.4% of the full-sibling pairs had at least one
occurrence of schizophrenia while the equivalent estimate in half
siblings was 0.6% (Table 1). Moreover, we found that sibling pairs
who had been affected by schizophrenia were twice as likely to
live in deprived neighborhoods between ages 31 and 35 than
population controls (24 vs 12%). Similar results were found for
those affected by psychotic experiences in the twin study.
In agreement with previous studies,15 we found a high familial
recurrence risk for schizophrenia (Supplementary eTable 1).
Similarly, we found that living in deprived neighborhoods in
adulthood also tended to run in families (OR = 2.10–3.24; eTable 2).
The likelihood of living in deprived neighborhoods was increased
for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia compared with

 unrelated controls (OR = 2.88–3.70; Table 2). The corresponding
OR for a full sibling to a proband with schizophrenia was also
substantially increased (OR = 1.90). Comparisons across sibling
types demonstrated that the likelihood of residing in a deprived
neighborhood was substantially higher among full siblings than
half siblings, suggesting the presence of genetic influences.
Commensurate results were found for psychotic experiences in
the twin study, such that the odds to live in a deprived
neighborhood for a monozygotic twin to a proband with
psychotic experiences was substantially increased (OR = 7.03) as
compared with a dizygotic twin (OR = 1.23).
The univariate quantitative genetic models are presented in
Table 3. We found that neighborhood deprivation in adult
Swedish siblings, between ages 31 and 35, was substantially
heritable with additive genetic influences accounting for 65% of
the variance. Further, 3% of the variance was attributed to shared
childhood environmental influences. In the twin study, when twins
in the age range 23 to 24 were assessed for neighborhood
deprivation, the heritability estimate was found to be reduced by
approximately a third (41%). Additive genetic influences substan-
tially explained the differences in both schizophrenia and
psychotic experiences (73% and 90%, respectively), whereas we
did not find any shared environmental influences.
The bivariate quantitative genetic models (Figure 1) revealed a
moderately sized correlation between schizophrenia and neigh-
borhood deprivation (r = 0.22; 95% confidence interval: 0.20–0.24),
which was replicated in the twin study (r = 0.20; 0.04–0.36). The
partitioning of the phenotypic correlations into genetic and
environmental influences demonstrated that genetic influences
almost entirely accounted for these correlations. The unique
environmental influences were not significantly different from
zero
(Pschizophrenia = 0.58;
Ppsychotic
experiences = 0.29).
Complete
model parameters are presented in Supplementary eTable 3.
Last, we found an association between polygenic risk scores for
schizophrenia and living in deprived neighborhoods in mid-to-late
adulthood across the P-value thresholds for the SNPs (Table 4). All
of
the
associations
were
statistically
significant
from
zero
(Po0.05) and increasing as a function of the thresholds. The
polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia explained approximately
0.15% of the variance in neighborhood deprivation when using
all SNPs.
DISCUSSION
We investigated the influences of schizophrenia and psychotic
experiences on subsequent residence in deprived neighborhoods.
We found that living in deprived neighborhoods in adulthood was
a substantially heritable trait with genetic influences accounting
for 65% of the observed variation. Consistent with recent
systematic reviews,8,9 we found that individuals diagnosed with
schizophrenia, as well as children with subclinical psychotic
experiences, were more likely to live in deprived neighborhoods
as compared with population controls. However, in contrast to
these reviews, we found limited support for the interpretation that
environmental factors causes the social drift into deprived
neighborhoods because the associations were fully confounded
by genetic influences. Complementary analyses using molecular
genetic data revealed, for the first time to our knowledge, that
polygenic
risk
for
schizophrenia
in
nonclinical
participants
predicted living in deprived neighborhoods in late adulthood.
Consistent with a recent Scottish twin study,14 we found that
genetic influences seem to explain 65 percent of the variance in
adulthood residence in deprived neighborhoods measured over a
period of 5 years. Together, these findings indicate that there is
genetic liability that increases the likelihood of living in deprived
neighborhoods in the entire population and not only among
individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and their relatives. It is
important to note, however, that environmental influences, and in

 particular those that are not shared within a family, remain
important and account for approximately a third of the variation in
deprived neighborhood residence.
Our next three aims focused specifically on understanding the
underlying mechanisms that might explain why individuals with
psychotic disorders tend to live in deprived neighborhoods. We
found that the association between schizophrenia and adulthood
neighborhood deprivation, albeit moderate in magnitude, was
fully explained by shared genetic influences. In other words, the
excess likelihood of adulthood residence in deprived neighbor-
hoods in schizophrenia patients was explained by genetic
factors that also increased their liability to be diagnosed with
schizophrenia.40 Our twin data suggested a similar mechanism for
the likelihood of early adulthood residence in deprived neighbor-
hoods among children experiencing auditory hallucinations.
Importantly, this link was also apparent on the molecular level
when we observed statistically significant associations between
polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia among non-patients and
neighborhood deprivation in late adulthood. The shared genetic
influences likely target a broader spectrum of problems, including
psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairments and language diffi-
culties that are more common in families with individuals with
non-affective
psychotic
disorders.41,42
These
problems
have
previously been linked to poor vocational outcomes (for example,
failure to maintain stable employment, low earnings and so on),
particularly in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia,43 but our
findings suggest that the elevated rates of these problems also
extend to residents of deprived neighborhoods.
Our results should be interpreted in light of some methodolo-
gical limitations. First, we relied on national patient registry data
for the ascertainment of schizophrenia cases and we adopted a
narrow definition of the disorder to achieve a high level of
specificity. Sensitivity tests using a broader measure of non-
affective psychosis (Supplementary eTable 4) was nevertheless
commensurate with the presented findings. Second, given that
the National Patient Register provides data starting from 1973,
which implies that the oldest cohort members were 22 years of
age at the time of its inception, we may have misclassified
schizophrenia exposure for some of the older individuals. The
extent of this bias is likely minimal, however, as we found that the
prevalence rate of schizophrenia was higher, albeit marginally, in
cohorts born between 1951 and 1958 (0.29%; 95% confidence
interval: 0.27–0.30%) than among their younger peers who were
born between 1959 and 1967 (0.25%; 95% confidence interval:
0.24–0.26%). Third, we used broader neighborhood deprivation
measures in the included twin studies due to a combination of
power and sample selection issues as described above. However,
sensitivity tests using broader deprivation measures in the sibling
study supported our conclusions (Supplementary eTable 5).
Fourth, we were unable to assess neighborhood exposure before
the onset of schizophrenia in the sibling study owing to the lack of
neighborhood data before 1982. However, our approach enabled
us to have follow-up data spanning almost three decades.
Moreover, the complementary twin study included exposure data
preceding adulthood neighborhood residence (that is, where the
children were still living in their parents’ home when they
reported the hallucinations) and replicated the findings of the
sibling study. Fifth, we estimated substantially smaller, albeit
statistically significant, effects using the polygenic risk scoring
method as compared with the quantitative genetic models. This

 was expected, however, because GWA studies only account for
common variants.44
Last, quantitative genetic models involve a number of assump-
tions, including, but not limited to; no assortative mating, equal
exposure across sibling types and a constant shared environ-
mental correlation for each sibling type.11 Although assortative
mating in schizophrenia is established,45 a violation of this
assumption will likely contribute to a downward bias of the
genetic influences.46 Half siblings tend to experience higher
prevalence of both phenotypes, which is why we allowed for the
estimation of different thresholds across sibling types. The
specification of a constant shared environmental correlation for
Swedish half siblings may be problematic as the correlation has
been shown to vary across birth cohorts (for example, the
proportion of half siblings that share their environments have
increased in younger cohorts) as well as with age (for example,
half siblings tend to share their environments to a lesser extent as
they transition from early childhood to adolescence), particularly
in paternal half siblings.47 We conducted, therefore, two sets of
complementary sensitivity analyses to test the stability of the
presented parameter estimates. First, we specified a number of
alternative and plausible shared environmental correlations for
the half siblings (Supplementary eTable 6) but only observed
negligible differences. Second, we cross-linked the baseline
population with the data from the Swedish Twin Registry, which
allowed us to identify all monozygotic twins (n = 8830) and
dizygotic
twins
(n = 23 030)
in the
population
sample.
We
subsequently re-fitted the quantitative genetic models on the
sample of twins and full siblings. The results matched the
presented findings; a moderately sized correlation (r = 0.22; 0.19–
0.26) that was entirely attributed to common genetic influences
(for example, the unique environmental contributions were not
significantly different from zero; P = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that the association between schizophrenia
and later residence in deprived neighborhoods is consistent with a
genetic selection interpretation where the overlap between the
phenotypes is primarily explained by common genetic influences.
Considering recent developments within psychiatric genetics to
incorporate environmental risk factors into molecular genetic
investigations of psychiatric disorders (for example, exploring
gene–environment
interactions),
the
findings
of
this
study
highlight the importance of combining such endeavors with
family-based research designs to further our understanding of the
underlying causal mechanisms.11,48,49 The development of clinical
and policy interventions will, therefore, benefit from future
identification of potential pathways between different dimensions
of cognitive functions and socioeconomic trajectories.
