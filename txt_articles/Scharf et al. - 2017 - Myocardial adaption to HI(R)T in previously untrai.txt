Abstract
Objective
Although musculoskeletal effects in resistance training are well described, little is known
about structural and functional cardiac adaption in formerly untrained subjects. We prospec-
tively evaluated whether short term high intensity (resistance) training (HI(R)T) induces
detectable morphologic cardiac changes in previously untrained men in a randomized con-
trolled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study.
Materials and methods
80 untrained middle-aged men were randomly assigned to a HI(R)T-group (n = 40; 43.5±5.9
years) or an inactive control group (n = 40; 42.0±6.3 years). HI(R)T comprised 22 weeks of
training focusing on a single-set to failure protocol in 2–3 sessions/week, each with 10–13
exercises addressing main muscle groups. Repetitions were decreased from 8–10 to 3–5
during study period. Before and after HI(R)T all subjects underwent physiologic examination
and cardiac MRI (cine imaging, tagging).
Results
Indexed left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) volume (LV: 76.8±15.6 to 78.7±14.8 ml/m2; RV:
77.0±15.5 to 78.7±15.1 ml/m2) and mass (LV: 55.5±9.7 to 57.0±8.8 g/m2; RV: 14.6±3.0 to
15.0±2.9 g/m2) significantly increased with HI(R)T (all p<0.001). Mean LV and RV remodel-
ing indices of HI(R)T-group did not alter with training (0.73g/mL and 0.19g/mL, respectively
[p = 0.96 and p = 0.87]), indicating balanced cardiac adaption. Indexed LV (48.4±11.1 to
50.8±11.0 ml/m2) and RV (48.5±11.0 to 50.6±10.7 ml/m2) stroke volume significantly in-
creased with HI(R)T (p<0.001). Myocardial strain and strain rates did not change following
resistance exercise. Left atrial volume at end systole slightly increased after HI(R)T (36.2±

training was unchanged (0.47 vs. 0.47, p = 0.79).
Conclusion
22 weeks of HI(R)T lead to measurable, physiological changes in cardiac atrial and ventricu-
lar morphologic characteristics and function in previously untrained men.
Trial regristration
The PUSH-trial is registered at the US National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov),
NCT01766791.
Introduction
Resistance training (RT) is an increasingly popular method of conditioning for recreational
purposes and in competitive athletes. In 2011, about 24% of middle-aged and older adults in
the US performed strength-training activities at least twice a week [1]. Besides recreation, RT
is increasingly used in prevention and rehabilitation [2].
Although the benefits of RT on the skeletal muscle are well established [3], the effect on car-
diac morphology and function remains equivocal. Based on predominantly cross-sectional
studies of elite athletes using echocardiography, two types of ventricular remodeling have been
postulated: ‘Concentric’ cardiac hypertrophy in response to strength training due to pressure
load and ‘eccentric’ hypertrophy in endurance trained athletes as a result of volume load [4–7].
In concentric remodeling myocardial mass and wall thickness are increased without substan-
tial change in cavity size. Eccentric cardiac adaption is characterized by cavity dilation and
thickening of the ventricular wall [8]. Data from cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), allowing evaluation of smaller changes in left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) cardiac
volume and mass than other imaging modalities, are limited [9]. A cross-sectional cardiovas-
cular MRI study by Fleck et al. [10] showed concentric LV myocardial adaption in RT whereas
others did not [11,12]. To our knowledge there are no longitudinal cardiovascular MRI stud-
ies, especially in previously sedentary individuals, to evaluate specific cardiac adaption in RT.
In addition, most previous cardiovascular MRI studies focused only on specific aspects of car-
diac adaption, for example, LV hypertrophy without assessment of the RV [13]. Besides benefi-
cial cardiovascular adaption [14] there is still controversy whether high-intensity RT (HI(R)T)
may also induce pathologic structural remodeling of the heart [15]. A comprehensive evalua-
tion of the myocardial structural changes associated with RT is necessary to differentiate physi-
ologic changes from cardiac maladaption. The Physical adaptions in Untrained on Strength
and Heart (PUSH)-trial was designed to address these issues.
Materials and methods
Trial design
The Physical adaptions in Untrained on Strength and Heart (PUSH) study was conducted in
collaboration of the Department of Radiology and the Institute of Medical Physics (IMP),
Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Germany. Study period was
from April 2012 to July 2013. We conducted a 22-week randomized controlled exercise trial
with a parallel group design, focusing on the effect of high intensity, single set resistance exer-
cise protocols (HI(R)T) on functional and morphologic cardiac parameters in middle-aged

 (30–50 years old) untrained males compared to sedentary controls. Details of the whole PUSH
trial have been described before [16].
The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Faculty of Medicine of the
Friedrich-Alexander-University (FAU) of Erlangen-Nuremberg (ethics application number
53_12 B) and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. PUSH complied with
the Declaration of Helsinki “Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Sub-
jects”. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01766791).
Outcomes
Primary study outcome.
Myocardial mass (MM) changes as determined by cardiac MRI
from baseline to the end of the intervention after 22 weeks of exercise.
Secondary study outcome.
Changes in end-diastolic volume (EDV) as determined by
cardiac MRI from baseline to the end of the intervention after 22 weeks of exercise.
Changes of trial outcomes after trial commencement
Originally, we planned to assess the effects of detraining on changes in myocardial mass and
end-diastolic volume induced by 22 weeks of HI(R)T. Therefore, we intended to perform fol-
low-up cardiac MRI examinations six months after the end of the training period. However,
because most of the participants (n = 31) continued RT after the intervention period, revers-
ibility of myocardial adaption was not tested.
Study population
Sample size was determined (G�power, version 3.1.3; 2009, Faul et al., Dusseldorf, Germany)
[17]. We estimated that a sample size of 32 individuals in each group would have a power of
90% to detect a between-group difference of 5±3g in myocardial mass (MM) with α = 0.05.
Assuming a drop-out rate of 20% our goal was to recruit 40 subjects per group.
Eligible study members were untrained (i.e., � 1 resistance exercise session/week; � 2 total
exercise sessions/week during the last 2 years) men between 30 and 50 years of age. Initially,
two-thousand randomly selected men in the area of Erlangen (Germany), aged 30–50 years,
were contacted using the citizen’s register of the municipality. Of those who responded 138 men
were assessed for eligibility (Fig 1). All participants completed a medical history and physical
activity questionnaire. All subjects denied the use of illicit substances and underwent physical
examination, 12-lead rest electrocardiography, and echocardiographic examinations. Hyperten-
sion was defined as a systolic blood pressure � 140 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure � 90
mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medications. Prevalent diabetes mellitus was defined as fast-
ing glucose � 126 mg/dL, haemoglobin A1c � 6.5%, or use of antidiabetic medications. After
clinical evaluations fifteen subjects were excluded from the study because of a too high fitness
level ([resistance] training > 1 session/week, n = 3), contraindication to MRI (n = 1), diseases/
medications that affect muscle metabolism (n = 5), evidence of active cardiac/cardiovascular dis-
ease (n = 2), predictable absence during intervention > 2 weeks (n = 3), and severe obesity
(body mass index > 35 kg/m2, n = 1). Of the 123 men remaining, three were unwilling to be ran-
domly allocated to a group and quit the study. Physical characteristics at baseline and post-train-
ing, profile of risk factors, and past medical history anamnesis are shown in Table 1.
Randomization procedures
Stratified for age (4 stratas of 5 years), 120 participants were randomly assigned to three study
arms by a uniform allocation rate (1 : 1 : 1): HI(R)T- (n = 40), control- (n = 40), and HI(R)T &

 protein supplementation-group (n = 40) (Fig 1). The latter one was investigated by the collabo-
rative institute and did not receive cardiac MRI [16]. For the allocation, lots in opaque plastic
shells were drawn by the participants themselves. Neither participants nor researchers knew
the allocation beforehand. Finally, group status of the study subjects was listed and participants
were assigned to the different study arms by the principle investigators.
Training procedure
Before the actual training period of HI(R)T-group there was a pre-phase consisting of two
weeks initiation and four weeks of conditioning (applying 1–2 sessions/week, 10 exercises,
each with two sets of 10–15 repetitions). Members of HI(R)T-group were then trained for 16
weeks with a linearly periodized resistance exercise protocol subdivided in 4-week phases with
each 4th week as a rest week. The exercise program consisted of two to three supervised ses-
sions per week addressing the main muscle groups by 10–13 exercises out of a pool of 17
Fig 1. Flow-chart of the PUSH-study: 138 male volunteers were enrolled in this study. After clinical
evaluations fifteen subjects were excluded from the study due to medical reasons. Three subjects refused
random allocation to one study group. Finally, 120 participants were randomly assigned to a HI(R)T- (n = 40),
control- (n = 40), and HI(R)T & protein supplementation-group (n = 40). The latter one was investigated by the
collaborative institute and did not receive cardiac MRI [16]. All subjects of HI(R)T- and control-group received
cardiac MRI before and after the intervention period. BMI, body mass index; HI(R)T, high-intensity

 exercises conducted on resistance devices (MedX, Ocala, FL, USA). We used a single-set-to-
failure protocol with prescribed exercise intensity as a range of repetitions (e.g., 6–8) that had
to be accomplished under the premise of work to momentary muscle failure. The number of
repetitions was consistently decreased from 8–10 to 3–5 repetitions during the training period.
Daily data were recorded on duration and type of training activities performed throughout the
study period. During the whole study period, the control group was requested to maintain
their lifestyle and physical activity. Detailed exercise program and procedure has been
described previously [16].
Cardiac MRI protocol
Cardiac MRI at baseline (before the introductory training) and post-training MRI was
performed on a 1.5-T unit (Magnetom Avanto, VB 17A; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany) using a six-channel phased-array surface and spine matrix receiver coil. Four-,
three-, and two-chamber long- and short-axis cine images (Fig 2) were acquired by using
breath-hold balanced steady-state free-precession sequences with retrospective electrocar-
diographic gating with the following scan parameters: field of view, 215 to 265×300 to 340
mm2; slice thickness, 6 mm; intersection-gap, 1.5 mm; repetition/echo time, 41.25 to 50.7/1.12

cardial strain was assessed using a prototype balanced steady-state free-precession-based tag-
ging sequence with the following image acquisition parameters: complementary spatial

Blinding
Outcome assessors were blinded to study subjects’ group assignment. All personal data was
removed from cardiac MRI exams by the study nurse. Readers evaluated studies independently
and in random order.
Image analysis
Quantitative image analysis was performed using dedicated software (Argus 4.01; Siemens
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). LV and RV functional analysis was performed in consensus
by two observers with more than 5 (—) and more than 14 (—) years of experience in MRI.
Tracing of the endo- and epicardial borders from base to apex was performed manually at end
diastole and end systole. Papillary muscles and epicardial adipose tissue were excluded. All
results were divided by BSA to minimize differences of myocardium parameters related to
weight and height. LV wall thickness was defined as the average of six segment thickness mea-
surements (anterior, anterolateral, anteroseptal, inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal). We
calculated the LV and RV remodeling index (myocardial mass/end-diastolic volume). An
increased remodeling index is consistent with concentric hypertrophy, whereas a reduced
remodeling index is indicative of isolated cavitary dilation [18]. In addition, the maximum left
atrial (LA) volume was calculated according to the biplane area-length method and indexed
for BSA [19]. An enlarged LA volume index was defined as greater than 55mL/m2. Three-
dimensional left ventricular analysis of myocardial strain was performed using semi-automatic
software (InTag, CREATIS, Lyon, France).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using software (SPSS, 21.0; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA and
R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing 2016, Vienna, Austria). The

 primary analysis was intention-to-treat and involved all patients who were randomly assigned,
independently of compliance or lost to follow-up. Normal distribution of variables was
checked graphically and statistically (Shapiro-Wilks-Test). Change from baseline was analyzed
and compared in HI(R)T- versus control-group in a linear mixed effects model with random
intercept where measurement occasions are nested in patients. Patients who were lost to fol-
low-up are considered to be missing at random conditional on the previous measurement
occasions (MAR) and were included in the model via estimation of the covariance structure
within maximum likelihood estimation. Mean changes from baseline ± standard errors are
shown together with baseline values ± standard deviations. Differences in mean changes of HI
(R)T-group versus control-group are presented with 95% confidence interval and error proba-
bility (p value). Each shown result is inherently adjusted for baseline differences in considered
outcome but not for other baseline values. Analyses adjusted for age, BMI, BSA and heart rate
are not shown here, but yielded no substantially different results. A two-sided P-value of less
than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
During the intervention period there were two drop-outs in the HI(R)T-group (removed,
n = 1; loss of interest, n = 1). No significant intra- or intergroup differences for baseline and
post-training physical characteristics, risk factors, and past medical history were determined
for HI(R)T and controls (Table 1). In HI(R)T resting heart rate marginally but not significantly
decreased from 77 bpm at baseline to 75 bpm post-training (p = 0.081). Electrocardiographic
patterns in exercise and control group remained unchanged during the study period.
MRI-derived baseline and post-training LV and RV functional and morphologic parame-
ters are detailed in Table 2. Image quality was diagnostic in all the cardiac MRI examinations.
None of the participants, except one control subject, had a decreased LV ejection fraction (EF)
below 50%, neither before nor after the intervention period. All RV EF values were within the
normal range for healthy adults (47%-74%).
Compared to controls, indexed LV and RV myocardial mass had significantly increased in
the HI(R)T-group after 22 weeks training by 2.8% and 2.2% (Fig 3). Mean values and ranges
for LV wall thickness in both study arms remained unchanged (HI(R)T: baseline, 6.7–10.4
mm and post-training 6.6–11.0 mm; controls: 5.7–11.0 mm and 5.7–10.9 mm; p = 0.766).
Parallel to enhanced myocardial mass in HI(R)T subjects, values for indexed LV and RV
end-diastolic volumes were significantly higher (2.5% and 2.2%) after the intervention period
compared to controls. Higher end-diastolic volumes were associated with greater LV and RV
stroke volumes (4.9%, 4.4%) and slightly smaller end-systolic volumes (-1.6%, -2.5%). Only
one subject in the HI(R)T-group (LV: 99 ml) and three controls (LV: 95, 102, 103 ml) were
beyond normal LV ranges for healthy, male, non-athletic subjects (LV: 47–92 mL/m2). No sub-
ject exceeded normal limits for RV end-diastolic volumes (RV: 55–105 mL/m2).
In the HI(R)T-group changes in LV and RV myocardial mass were highly correlated with
increments in end-diastolic volume (Pearson correlations: LV = 0.649 and RV = 0.690; both
p<0.001). LV and RV remodeling indices in the exercise-group remained unchanged after 22
weeks of HI(R)T (LV, 0.74g/mL ± 0.01; RV, 0.19g/mL ± 0.08; p = 0.96 and p = 0.87) compared
to baseline values (LV, 0.73g/mL ± 0.10; RV, 0.19g/mL ± 0.02). This is indicative of balanced
cardiac adaption (Fig 4). In addition, in HI(R)T LV-to-RV ratios for indexed end-diastolic vol-
ume and myocardial mass did not alter with training (EDV: 1.00 vs. 1.00, p = 0.025; MM: 3.84
vs. 3.86, p = 0.981).
Mean value for indexed maximum LA volume at end systole increased by 2.2% from 36.2
mL/m2 ± 7.9 to 37.0 mL/m2 ± 8.4 (p = 0.411) with HI(R)T. In control- and HI(R)T-group

 ratios of indexed end-systolic LA volume to end-diastolic LV volume at baseline (0.47 vs. 0.47,
p = 0.890) and after the intervention (0.47 vs. 0.46, p = 0.488) were comparable.
Peak systolic circumferential strain before and after the intervention period ranged between
-10% to -25% without significant intergroup differences for HI(R)T- and control-group sub-
jects (Table 3). Intragroup analysis of HI(R)T-members showed no significant differences
between baseline and post-training within the three LV levels for circumferential (Ecc), radial
(Err), and for longitudinal strain (Ell).
Discussion
This longitudinal cardiac MRI study shows that a relatively short period (22 weeks) of HI(R)T
in previously untrained male subjects induces significant morphologic changes of the LV and
RV.
Previous cross-sectional echocardiographic [20–22] and MRI [10] studies postulated con-
centric cardiac hypertrophy in resistance training. In contrast, increase in LV and RV myocar-
dial masses in our investigation was associated with an equivalent increment in end-diastolic
ventricular volumes. These findings are supported by comparable remodeling indices of HI(R)
T subjects at baseline and post-training, indicating balanced cardiac adaption without prepon-
derance of one specific remodeling mechanism.

 The discrepancy between results found in our investigation and previous cross-sectional
studies might in part be explained by differences in imaging modalities. Compared to echocar-
diography, cardiac MRI provides high quality images and is intrinsically three dimensional

22 weeks of HI(R)T on MRI derived measures of indexed LV and RV myocardial mass (MM), end-

declined. LV = left ventricle; and RV = right ventricle.

 (i.e., does not rely on geometric assumptions). Especially, evaluation of the RV myocardial
mass and volume is limited using echocardiography [23,24]. Cardiac MRI is therefore consid-
ered the current reference standard for LV and RV volume and mass assessment [25]. Con-
flicting study findings might also be related to effects of type, intensity, and duration of
training. In contrast to previous studies [10,20–22] our population consisted of sportive inex-
perienced subjects with presumably higher potential for cardiac remodeling than active
sportsmen.
In the present study, there were no differences in the LV/RV ratios for volume and mass
indices, indicating balanced cardiac adaption of both chambers. This is in contrast to a previ-
ous animal study in rats [26] postulating isolated LV hypertrophy without changes in the RV
and agrees with a longitudinal cardiac MRI study by Spence et al. [24], showing mild morpho-
logical RV adaption after six months of intense resistance training.
Indexed LV and RV myocardial masses at baseline and after the training period were below
previously reported mean values for healthy male subjects (LV, 69–112 g/m2 and RV, 16–36 g/
m2, respectively) [27,28]. We suppose that this is related to a larger body surface area of our
study subjects as compared to previous investigations. Indexed LV and RV myocardial mass
above upper limits is supposed to be associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality
[29]. None of our study participants had exaggerated LV or RV myocardial mass values. This
is due to participants’ low baseline fitness level and the relatively short training period within
this study.
Mean LV wall thickness of all study subjects at baseline (8.1 mm) is lower than that of previ-
ously reported reference values (8.8–9.0 mm) for healthy, male, non-athletic subjects [5,30].
This discrepancy might be due to the selection of older individuals in our study (30–50 years).
Compared to previous cross-sectional studies assessing elite strength trained athletes (range,
9–16 mm) [31,32] and Olympic weight lifters (mean, 9.8 mm) [33], LV ventricular septum
thickness in our HI(R)T-members after the intervention period was much lower. This reflects
the different fitness level.
Ventricular remodeling of HI(R)T-members in our investigation is accompanied by a bal-
anced increase in LA dilation. However, LA enlargement in our study (2.2%) was lower than
that observed in previously sedentary individuals after a comparable period of high-intensity
interval training (13%) [34] and in long-time elite endurance athletes (up to 62%) [35].
Besides the beneficial cardiovascular effects of regular resistance exercise training there is
still uncertainty whether high-intensity RT is associated with cardiac maladaption. Post mor-
tem investigations in athletes suffering from sudden cardiac death detected myocardial inter-
stitial fibrosis [36] and animal studies in rats have demonstrated that intensive resistance
exercise leads to overexpression of LV proteome which similar changes found in the initial

 phase of heart failure [15]. It has been shown that strain-technologies can be used to evaluate
the function of the ventricular fiber architecture [37] and to measure dynamic changes in the
geometry and fibrous structure of the heart [38]. In our study, we found no association of HI
(R)T in previously untrained men and myocardial damage. To assess myocardial deformation
we focused on circumferential strain analysis as radial strain has been shown to be relatively
imprecise, because only a small number of tags span the myocardial wall [39]. Circumferential
strain values at systole in our study ranged from -10% to -25%. This corresponds to results of
previous investigations in healthy subjects [40]. Global longitudinal strain is a strong predictor
for major adverse cardiac events [41] and a meta-analysis by Huttin et al. [42] defined a cut-off
level from -12.8% to -10.2% for peak systolic longitudinal strain to predict adverse remodeling
after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Unchanged longitudinal strain values in our
study contrast with an echocardiographic longitudinal study by Schmidt et al., who showed an
increase (by 6%) in systolic longitudinal strain after 12 months of RT [43]. Discrepancies prob-
ably reflect differences in imaging modality, training duration, and younger age of subjects in
our study.
Physiologic morphologic adaption in our study is supported by unremarkable electrocar-
dio-graphic patterns before and post-training. Therefore, we hypothesize that the mentioned
changes in protein expression are related to a physiological process with transient myocardial
adaption leading to enhanced cardiac structure and function. This is supported by the findings
of a concomitant increased expression of protective proteins described in the study by Dantas
et al. [15] and an improvement of collagen deposition and inflammatory profile after RT in
chronic heart failure rats in a study by Alves et al. [44].
LV and RV ejection fraction in our study slightly improved after HI(R)T. This finding is
attributable to the larger EDV of hypertrophied ventricles.
As our study comprises a relatively broad age range with a relevant distribution of physical
characteristics, risk factor profile, and fitness level we hypothesize that physiologic cardiac adap-
tions to HI(R)T found in our investigation are generalizable to a large part of the population.
Our study has several limitations. Because our study involved only volunteers, not clinically
suffering from cardiac disease, intravenous contrast agent was not applied. Therefore, we
could not measure delayed gadolinium-enhancement, indicating potential cardiac fibrosis.
Risk factors (e.g. hypertension) and impact of medication in a small number of participants
might influence study results although subgroup study analysis showed no statistically relevant
effect. We performed MRI only at the beginning and end of the training or waiting period, so
we do not have information about time specific effects on cardiac adaption in the course of the
study. This is due to the high training effort for participants and methodical limitations.
Because most of the study subjects continued RT after the intervention period, reversibility of
myocardial adaption could not be tested. The long-term dynamics of myocardial adaption in
HI(R)T need to be addressed in further studies. We did not perform MRI with exercise or
pharmacological stress, which in part may explain the relatively wide range in end-systolic vol-
ume. We also did not perform a direct comparison to the effects of other types of training (e.g.,
endurance training), known cardiac diseases (e.g. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or the abuse
of anabolic substances to describe differences in cardiac adaption. We did not test participants
for anabolic steroid abuse but all study subjects denied the use of illicit substances.
Conclusion
This longitudinal cardiovascular MRI study suggests that a relatively short period of HI(R)T in
previously untrained men is associated with physiological, significant changes in cardiac atrial
and ventricular morphologic characteristics and function.
