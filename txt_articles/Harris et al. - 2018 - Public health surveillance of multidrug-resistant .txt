Summary
Background Traditional methods for molecular epidemiology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are suboptimal. Whole-genome 
sequencing (WGS) offers ideal resolution to describe population dynamics and to predict and infer transmission of 
antimicrobial resistance, and can enhance infection control through linkage with epidemiological data. We used 
WGS, in conjunction with linked epidemiological and phenotypic data, to describe the gonococcal population in 
20 European countries. We aimed to detail changes in phenotypic antimicrobial resistance levels (and the reasons for 
these changes) and strain distribution (with a focus on antimicrobial resistance strains in risk groups), and to predict 
antimicrobial resistance from WGS data.
Methods We carried out an observational study, in which we sequenced isolates taken from patients with gonorrhoea 
from the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme in 20 countries from September to 
November, 2013. We also developed a web platform that we used for automated antimicrobial resistance prediction, 
molecular typing (N gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing [NG-MAST] and multilocus sequence typing), and 
phylogenetic clustering in conjunction with epidemiological and phenotypic data.
Findings The multidrug-resistant NG-MAST genogroup G1407 was predominant and accounted for the most 
cephalosporin resistance, but the prevalence of this genogroup decreased from 248 (23%) of 1066 isolates in a previous 
study from 2009–10 to 174 (17%) of 1054 isolates in this survey in 2013. This genogroup previously showed an 
association with men who have sex with men, but changed to an association with heterosexual people (odds 
ratio=4·29). WGS provided substantially improved resolution and accuracy over NG-MAST and multilocus sequence 
typing, predicted antimicrobial resistance relatively well, and identified discrepant isolates, mixed infections or 
contaminants, and multidrug-resistant clades linked to risk groups.
Interpretation To our knowledge, we provide the first use of joint analysis of WGS and epidemiological data in an 
international programme for regional surveillance of sexually transmitted infections. WGS provided enhanced 
understanding of the distribution of antimicrobial resistance clones, including replacement with clones that were 
more susceptible to antimicrobials, in several risk groups nationally and regionally. We provide a framework for 
genomic surveillance of gonococci through standardised sampling, use of WGS, and a shared information architecture 
for interpretation and dissemination by use of open access software.

Introduction
Gonorrhoea and antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae are public health concerns globally. Clinical 
resistance to the last options of the first-line therapies of 
gonorrhoea, the extended-spectrum cephalosporins 
(namely, cefixime and ceftriaxone) and azithromycin, has 
emerged.1–5 This worrying situation, along with the 
potentially severe complications of untreated gonorrhoea, 
mean that gonorrhoea is a global public health 
problem.1,2,5,6
The European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance 
Programme (Euro-GASP) monitors antimicrobial re- 
sistance in gonococci in the European Union/European 
Economic Area (EU/EEA; appendix 1).3,4,6,7 Euro-GASP also 
performs molecular typing of gonococcal isolates, 
particularly to describe the gonococcal population in 
the EU/EEA, transmission of antimicrobial resistant 
strains, and associations with epidemiological character-
istics of the patients. In a previous Euro-GASP molecular 
typing study,8 1066 isolates collected in 2009–10 were typed 
with N gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing 
(NG-MAST). The key findings included a high prevalence 
of 
the 
multidrug-resistant 
NG-MAST 
genogroup 
1407 (G1407) across the EU/EEA. G1407 accounted for 
nearly all resistance to cefixime, the first-line antimicrobial 
for monotherapy in the EU/EEA at that time, and showed

decreased susceptibility or resistance (or both) to 
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin.8
Since 2010, the patterns of antimicrobial resistance in 
gonococci have changed in the EU/EEA. In 2012, 
combination therapy (ceftriaxone plus azithromycin), 
which was already being used in several countries, was 
officially recommended for all the European countries.9,10 
Since then, cefixime resistance has decreased and 
azithromycin resistance has increased.4,9 It is crucial to 
understand whether these changes to resistance are due 
to the introduction of combination therapy,10 or changes 
to sexual behaviour in sexual networks or the gonococcal 
population, other reasons, or a combination of these 
factors. Linkage of molecular typing data to antimicrobial 
resistance and epidemiological data can elucidate 
changes to strain distributions overall and among risk 
groups. 
Whole-genome 
sequencing 
(WGS) 
allows 
finer 
resolution and improved accuracy compared with typing 
schemes that are based on a small number of genetic 
loci. With WGS, the true baseline of genomic 
heterogeneity of the gonococcal population and the 
spread of antimicrobial resistance among gonococcal 
strains in the EU/EEA can be described (for instance, to 
inform outbreak investigations). We can elucidate the 
associations of specific gonococcal strains or clades with 
antimicrobial resistance profiles (including genetic 
determinants of antimicrobial resistance) for therapeutic 
antimicrobials and for risk groups, nationally and at the 
EU/EEA level, to guide public health interventions. WGS 
has not previously been used within a structured regional 
programme for public health surveillance of sexually 
transmitted infections for several reasons. These reasons 
include cost, scale, or an absence of automated systems 
and intuitive interpretation methods linking genomics to 
antimicrobial resistance and epidemiological data and 
providing data in formats that can inform the public 
health response, or a combination of these factors.
We aimed to use WGS of gonococcal isolates from 
20 EU/EEA countries in conjunction with epidemiological 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the terms “Neisseria gonorrhoeae” OR 
“gonorrhoea” with “sequencing” OR “molecular epidemiology” 
for papers published in English between Jan 1, 2000, and 
Dec 5, 2017. Previously, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 
N gonorrhoeae was mainly used to investigate molecular 
epidemiology at a national or local level in the USA (national: 
isolates with reduced cephalosporin susceptibility and 
cephalosporin-susceptible isolates [236 isolates] and isolates 
resistant to cephalosporins, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin 
[1102 isolates]), Canada (national: azithromycin-resistant 
isolates [246 isolates] and isolates with decreased cephalosporin 
susceptibility [169 isolates]), the UK (Brighton: 1407 isolates), 
and Brazil (Rio de Janeiro: 116 isolates), and have focused on a 
few isolates that were selected because of their antimicrobial 
resistance, for examining single strains or local outbreaks 
(including determining transmission). To our knowledge, except 
for one study that examined a low number of selected 
azithromycin-resistant isolates (75 isolates) from 17 European 
countries, there have been no regional studies that used WGS of 
N gonorrhoeae.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, we report the first use of WGS in conjunction 
with relevant epidemiological and phenotypic data in an 
international programme for regional surveillance of sexually 
transmitted infections and we improve the understanding of 
the distribution of resistant clones in different risk groups 
nationally and regionally. For simplified, appropriate analysis in 
gonococcal genomic projects, a publicly available and 
user-friendly web application was adapted and optimised for 
N gonorrhoeae and used for all analyses and dissemination of 
results to participating countries. We used WGS to investigate 
1054 Euro-GASP isolates (consecutive susceptible and resistant 
isolates) that were collected in 20 European countries in 2013 
and we describe the genomic baseline of the European 
gonococcal population, identify antimicrobial resistant clades 
and clones and their associations with patient metadata, 
predict antimicrobial resistance, and compare our results with a 
European molecular survey from 2009–10. We show that WGS 
produces a significantly higher and more accurate resolution of 
gonococcal isolates than do other molecular epidemiological 
typing methods, such as N gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence 
typing and multilocus sequence typing, such that discrepant 
isolates, mixed infections, and contaminants can be identified 
in surveillance programmes by use of our pipeline, and that 
antimicrobial resistance can be accurately predicted in most 
cases.
Implications of all the available evidence
Use of WGS in conjunction with relevant epidemiological and 
phenotypic data in N gonorrhoeae surveillance programmes 
provides enhanced understanding of the distribution of 
antimicrobial resistance clades and clones in different risk 
groups nationally and regionally. Current molecular methods, 
such as N gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing and 
multilocus sequence typing, do not provide the resolution nor 
accuracy necessary for molecular epidemiology, and their use 
should be discouraged. WGS can additionally identify 
discrepant isolates, mixed infections, and contaminants, and 
predict antimicrobial resistance. The provision of data through 
a simple-to-use web application that enables ongoing addition 
and analysis of new genomic data with rapid phylogenetic 
analysis and antimicrobial resistance prediction within an 
epidemiological context enables the ongoing national and 
regional surveillance of N gonorrhoeae with WGS.

and phenotypic data to describe the genomic baseline of 
the European gonococcal population, identify antimicrobial 
resistance clades and clones and their associations with 
patient metadata, predict antimicrobial resistance, and 
compare our results to the Euro-GASP 2009–10 NG-MAST 
survey.8 For simplified, appropriate analysis in gonococcal 
genomic projects, we also aimed to make data available 
through development of a publicly available and user-
friendly web application for gonococci, for analysis and 
dissemination of results to participating countries.
Methods
Euro-GASP sampling 
From Sept 1 to Nov 30, 2013, 1218 isolates that were linked 
to epidemiological information were collected from 
clinics and hospitals in 21 Euro-GASP countries. In 
accordance with the Euro-GASP protocols,3,4,7,9 laboratories 
collect only one isolate per patient from those who were 
infected multiple times within a 4-week period or at 
several anatomical sites, to represent different gonorrhoea 
episodes. For this study, each country was asked to, where 
possible, contribute 50 isolates from September to 
November, 2013. In Spain, the Netherlands, and the UK, 
where 50 isolates represented fewer than 10% of the total 
gonorrhoea 
cases, 
100 
isolates 
were 
requested. 
 
Furthermore, some countries with fewer than 50 isolates 
from September to November, 2013 (Cyprus, Iceland, and 
Malta), were asked to add previous isolates, giving an 
extended study duration (appendix 1).3,4,7,9 
After decentralised (12 countries) or centralised (eight 
countries) 
antimicrobial 
susceptibility 
testing, 
all 
countries participating in Euro-GASP reported their 
antimicrobial susceptibility data through The European 
Surveillance System (European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control, Stockholm, Sweden). In addition 
to the antimicrobial susceptibility data, countries 
reported epidemiological data that were linked to the 
gonorrhoea cases through The European Surveillance 
System.3,4,7 Epidemiological data collected with each 
isolate, where possible, included the date that the clinical 
specimen was obtained, the anatomical site that the 
specimen was isolated from, sex, age, sexual orientation, 
previous 
gonorrhoea 
diagnosis, 
other 
sexually 
transmitted infections diagnosed during the current 
gonorrhoea infection, place of residence, type of clinic 
that the patient visited, HIV status, and probable country 
of infection.
All gonococcal isolates were cultured as part of routine 
diagnostics, and isolates or data were submitted to the 
Euro-GASP surveillance study with no information that 
would enable patient identification; ethical approval was, 
therefore, not required. We tested viable isolates for which 
country representatives had permitted molecular typing 
with WGS. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done 
to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) with Etests (bioMérieux; Marcy-l’Étoile, France) for 
cefixime and ceftriaxone, and an agar dilution breakpoint 
method or Etests for ciprofloxacin, azithro 
mycin, and 
spectinomycin. SIR (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) 
breakpoints 
from 
the 
European 
Committee 
on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing were applied. 
WGS procedures and analyses
We extracted DNA from a single colony of each isolate with 
a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit (Promega; 
Madison, WI, USA) or a QIAsymphony instrument 
(Qiagen; Hilden, Germany), and whole-genome sequenced 
purified DNA extracts, as described (appendix 1).11
We derived multilocus sequence typing (MLST) 
sequence types, NG-MAST sequence types, and NG-
MAST genogroups in silico from the WGS data. Known 
antimicrobial resistance determinants (appendix 2) were 
searched against the sequence assemblies of the isolates 
by use of BLASTn under default parameters. Antimicrobial 
resistance determinants were grouped into sets of one or 
more that collaboratively provide antimicrobial resistance. 
Complete sets indicate intermediate or full resistance 
predicted to the specified antimicrobial drug; incomplete 
sets may confer inter 
mediate or no resistance (appendix 2).
We examined the associations between NG-MAST 
genogroups, antimicrobial resistance, and patient charac- 
ter 
istics (sex, age, and sexual orientation; appendices 1 
and 2).12–15 The statistical analyses are detailed in appendix 1. 
Changes in phenotype distribution were assessed with 
TreeBreaker (appendix 1).16

Results
Quality-checked WGS data linked to antimicrobial 
resistance profiles and epidemiological data were 
obtained for 1054 (87%) of 1218 isolates from 20 countries 
(no isolates available from Ireland). Sex of the patient 
was reported for 1045 (99%) of 1054 isolates and age of 
the patient was reported for 1023 (97%) isolates. Among 
the 1045 patients with reported sex, 884 (85%) were male 
and 161 (15%) were female. The median age was 31 years 
for men and 24 years for women, with a peak in the 
25–30 age group for men (185 [21%] of 861 isolates with 
reported patient age and sex) and in the 20–29 age group 
in women (50 [31%] of 160 isolates with reported patient 
age and sex). Sexual orientation of the patient was 
reported for 499 (47%) of isolates, of which 294 (59%) 
were from a patient with a reported heterosexual 
orientation. Of the 414 (47%) men who reported their 
sexual orientation, 206 (50%) reported being men who 
have sex with men (MSM).
Antimicrobial resistance in the 1054 isolates is 
summarised in table 1. 562 (53%) isolates showed

phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, 71 (7%) to azithro-
mycin, 51 (5%) to cefixime, five (<1%) to ceftriaxone, and 
none to spectinomycin (before re-testing of discrepant 
isolates identified through WGS). Resistance to 
ciprofloxacin across countries ranged from 28 (26%) of 
106 isolates in the UK to seven (88%) of eight isolates in 
Cyprus, and resistance to azithromycin from 14 (29%) of 
48 isolates in Greece to none in nine countries. Cefixime-
resistant isolates were identified in 12 (60%) countries, 
and resistance varied from 11 (23%) of 48 isolates in 
Greece to none in nine countries. Five (<1%) ceftriaxone-
resistant isolates were identified in Spain.
MLST and NG-MAST sequence types and genogroups, 
including associations with patient epidemiological 
characteristics and antimicrobial resistance, are shown in 
table 2 and the appendix 2. Isolates were assigned to 
103 MLST sequence types and 377 NG-MAST sequence 
types (160 NG-MAST geno 
groups), of which 23 MLST 
sequence types and 17 NG-MAST sequence types included 
ten or more isolates. 35 (34%) of 103 MLST sequence types, 
249 (66%) of 377 NG-MAST sequence types, and 84 (53% ) 
of 160 NG-MAST genogroups contained only one isolate. 
As in 2009–10,8 NG-MAST G1407 (n=174 isolates) was the 
predominant genogroup and was significantly associated 
with resistance to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and 
cefixime (p<0·0001 with χ²) and an increased MIC of 
ceftriaxone (p<0·0001 with logistic regression; appendix 2). 
However, the prevalence of G1407 decreased significantly 
from 2009–10 to 2013, from 248 (23%) of 1066 isolates8 to 
174 (17%) of 1054 isolates (p<0·0001 in a Z-test). 
Furthermore, in 2013, G1407 was significantly associated 
with patients who were older (at least 45 years; odds ratio 
[OR] 1·01 [95% CI 1·00–1·03]; p=0·0463) and heterosexual 
(4·29 [2·12–8·67]; p<0·0001; appendix 2), whereas, in 
2009–10, G1407 was associated with MSM.8 However, 
G1407 was also associated with missing sexual orientation 
metadata (1·86 [1·32–2·61]; p=0·0004 with χ²), which 
might confound these results if absence of data was not 
random. G2400 and G4995, associated with MSM, and 
G51, associated with young  (age 15–24 years) heterosexual 
people, were more prevalent in 2013 than in 2009–10 
(appendix 2).8
Six isolates were contaminated with a substantial 
amount of non-gonococcal DNA (>100 kb of DNA from 
Mycoplasma spp). 23 isolates contained mixed gonococcal 
sequences, indicating mixed infections, contamination, 
or both.
Genomic 
antimicrobial 
resistance 
determinants,1 
which were identified by Whole Genome Sequence 
Analysis (WGSA) are detailed in appendix 2. On the basis 
of the genomic results, 34 discrepant isolates were 
identified and re-phenotyped. 17 isolates that were 
originally reported as ciprofloxacin-resistant, but had no 
known ciprofloxacin resistance mutations, re-tested as 
susceptible, and four isolates reported as susceptible but 
that contained a gyrA Ser91Phe substitution, which is 
known to confer ciprofloxacin resistance, re-tested as 
resistant. Two additional isolates with a gyrA Ser91Phe 
substitution had ciprofloxacin MICs of less than 
0·06 mg/L even after re-testing. PCR showed that neither 
of the phenotypically tested isolates had a gyrA Ser91Phe 
substitution, which suggested a sample mix-up. 
Ten isolates reported to be cefixime-resistant re-tested as 
susceptible, and one isolate that was reported to be 
cefixime-susceptible was resistant in re-testing. Although 
all five ceftriaxone-resistant isolates from Spain possessed 
the mosaic penAXXXIV allele that is associated with 
decreased susceptibility or resistance to extended-
spectrum cephalosporins, they did not have a unique 
genotype to explain the resistance, and did not cluster on 
the WGSA tree. All five isolates were therefore re-tested 
and found to be susceptible to ceftriaxone. The MICs of 
all isolates with discrepant results regarding susceptibility 
to extended-spectrum cephalosporins were close to the 
resistance breakpoint (>0·125 mg/L) and were initially 
tested via decentralised testing with agar dilution, 
whereas centralised re-testing was done with Etests. 
Figure 1 shows the MICs for isolates (after re-testing) 
that showed combinations of the antimicrobial resistance 
determinants in appendix 2. Ciprofloxacin resistance (in 
549 isolates) was only found in isolates containing a gyrA 
Ser91Phe substitution, except for one isolate from Spain 
(MIC=0·094 mg/L), shown in light green. This isolate was 
the only one that contained a gyrA Asp95Asn substitution

without also containing the Ser91Phe substitution, which 
indicates that, in rare isolates, gyrA Asp95Asn alone 
might cause low-level ciprofloxacin resistance. 71 isolates 
were azithromycin-resistant. No isolates had high-level 
azithromycin resistance (MIC≥256 mg/L) or had the 
associated 23S rDNA 2045A→G (2059A→G Escherichia 
coli numbering) mutation. All but one isolate with 
azithromycin MICs of at least 2 mg/L (11 isolates) had the 
2597C→T (2611C→T E coli numbering) 23S rDNA 
mutation, which was not seen in isolates with MICs of 
less than 2 mg/L. The remaining isolate (azithromycin 
MIC=2 mg/L) contained the mtrR promoter 23_25delA 
deletion, which is associated with increased azithromycin 
MICs. Decreased susceptibility and resis 
tance to cefixime 
was particularly associated with penAX and penAXXXIV 
alleles (which contain the mosaic penA allele indicator 
substitutions Ile312Met, Val316Thr, and Gly545Ser). All 
isolates with a cefixime MIC of more than 0·125 mg/L 
had a mosaic penAX (six isolates), penAXXXIV (35 isolates), 
or a novel allele differing from penAXXXIV by a single 
aminoacid substitution (one isolate). However, 158 iso 
lates 
with mosaic penA alleles had a cefixime MIC of less than 
or equal to 0·125 mg/L, including one penAX, 
153 penAXXXIV, three penALXXII, and one novel allele. 
The latter two alleles differ from penAXXXIV by a single 
aminoacid substitution.
Even after re-testing, the antimicrobial MIC values of 
some genotypes clearly varied between participating 
countries, despite isolates being intermingled in the 
phylogeny (appendix 1). Countries with decentralised 
testing often reported higher MICs for cefixime, whereas 
ceftriaxone 
MICs 
for 
Portuguese 
isolates 
were 
significantly lower than those for all other countries 
(p<0·0001 with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).
WGSA identified 41 639 variable sites between 
921 genotypes in the core genomes of the sequenced 
isolates. The whole-genome phylogeny (figure 2) revealed 
a population structure that was generally concordant 
with 
MLST 
(consistency 
index 
0·843, 
retention 
index 0·974) and NG-MAST (0·922, 0·944). These 
concordances are artificially inflated by the high number 
of uninformative singleton MLST (35 of 103 MLST 
sequence types) and NG-MAST (249 of 377 NG-MAST 
sequence types) sequence types identified, which provide 
no information on isolate relationships and are 
concordant with any phylogeny. For both MLST and NG-
MAST, after exclusion of mixed samples, incorrect 
clusterings that were identified by use of the WGS tree 
were explained by sequence type convergences or 
reversions that were primarily caused by homologous 
recombination of typing alleles. Clustering of NG-MAST 
into genogroups compounded this effect, leading to

increased levels of genogroup homoplasy on the tree 
(0·795, 0·941).
The shortcomings of MLST and NG-MAST can be 
illustrated, for example, by isolates possessing mosaic 
penA alleles, which formed two discrete clades in the 
WGS phylogeny (figure 2). One clade contained penAX 
(clade M1) and the other contained penAXXXIV 
(clade M2). Neither MLST nor NG-MAST accurately 
associated isolates with these two clinically important 
clades. M1 comprised seven isolates from six countries, 
which had been assigned to five NG-MAST genogroups 
and a single MLST (sequence type 7363). Although all M1 
isolates shared a single MLST, sequence type 7363 also 
included a larger group of phylogenetically distant isolates 
that did not have penAX alleles and showed lower cefixime 
MICs than the isolates in the M1 clade (M1: mean=0·234, 
SD=0·123 [seven M1 clade isolates]; 71 non-M1 sequence 
type 7363: 0·040, 0·022). M2 comprised 193 isolates in 
11 NG-MAST genogroups (58 NG-MAST sequence types) 
dominated by G1407 (172 isolates) and eight MLST 
sequence types, dominated by sequence type 1901 
(166 isolates). Neither NG-MAST G1407 nor MLST 
sequence type 1901 was restricted to this clade. MLST 
sequence type 1901 included a further 58 related isolates 
that did not have a mosaic penA, whereas G1407 included 
two phylogenetically distant isolates that seemed to have 
undergone 
recent 
recombination 
events 
at 
both 
NG-MAST 
alleles 
(appendix 
1), 
rendering 
them 
indistinguishable with NG-MAST. Neither of these 
isolates possessed a mosaic penA allele, and both had 
cefixime MICs of 0·016 mg/L compared with a mean of 
0·124 mg/L (SD 0·105) for all other G1407 isolates.
An alternative to typing methods such as NG-MAST or 
MLST is to identify important clades by examination of 
genotypic or phenotypic markers, such as mosaic penA 
alleles, SIR data, or patient demographic data. This strategy 
allows more accurate monitoring of clades or subclades of 
the gonococcal population that pose the biggest threat to 
public health and it can potentially aid decisions on 
treatment and interventions. The TreeBreaker algorithm16 
divided the branches leading to clades M1 and M2 with 
only cefixime SIR data (appendix 1). Similarly, results for 
azithromycin and ciprofloxacin SIR (appendix 1) identified 
clades of importance for these drugs. Four clades were 
associated with an increased incidence of azithromycin-
resistant or intermediate-resistant isolates, whereas five 
were associated with ciprofloxacin resistance, consistent 
with several gains of the gyrA Ser91Phe substitution. By 
use of reported patient sexual orientation to identify clades 
(appendix 1), five clades were identified that were associated 
with heterosexual people, including a basal split in the tree 
between an MSM-associated clade and a heterosexual-
associated clade, which later transmitted back into an 
MSM population.
The superior resolution of WGS versus NG-MAST and 
MLST, and linking to epidemiological data, has the 
potential to allow early identification of novel outbreak or 
high-risk clones (eg, as defined by antimicrobial 
resistance). Analysis of pairwise geographical and 
cophenetic distances (distances between pairs of isolates 
on the tree; figure 3) showed that geographical mixing 
occurred very rapidly. The geographical separation of 
two 
isolates 
greater 
than 
30 
single 
nucleotide 
polymorphisms apart was essentially random, whereas 
about 80% of isolates separated by one single nucleotide 
polymorphism (or not separated) were from the same 
country (and about 60% from the same city or region), 
despite only about 7% of isolate pairs being from the 
same country.
The development of resistance to dual gonorrhoea 
therapy (ceftriaxone plus azithromycin) is of particular 
concern. WGSA allowed rapid identification of two clades 
(figure 4), each comprising three closely related isolates 
(two to five single nucleotide polymorphisms distant), that 
contained a mosaic penAXXXIV that conferred decreased 
susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, a 
23S 
rRNA 
2597C→T 
mutation 
that 
conferred 
azithromycin resistance, and gyrA Ser91Phe substitution 
that conferred ciprofloxacin resistance. The MICs of all six 
isolates were 8–16 mg/L for azithromycin and more than 
32 mg/L for ciprofloxacin. The cefixime MICs for four 
isolates were at least 0·125 mg/L, but all were susceptible 
to ceftriaxone. The epidemiological characteristics of the 
two clades were strikingly similar. In both cases, the three 
isolates were from the same country (Spain and Denmark), 
with a single isolate from a heterosexual man isolated 1 
month before the two other isolates, which were from 
heterosexual men and women and were isolated on a 
single day in the same location. These characteristics 
clearly support the genomic evidence that suggest that 
these isolates are epidemiologically linked.

Discussion
We report the findings of the first Euro-GASP WGS-
based structured gonococcal survey in the EU/EEA. The 
multidrug-resistant NG-MAST genogroup G1407, which 
has been previously described in the EU/EEA,8,18 USA,19,20 
and Canada21,22 is decreasing in prevalence because 
of replacement by more cephalosporin-susceptible geno- 
groups. An association between G1407 and hetero- 
sexuals was also indicated in this 2013 survey, in contrast 
with the association with MSM seen in 2009–10.8 This 
decrease in G1407 prevalence and changes in its 
epidemiological features could be due to many factors. 
Such possible factors include the increased use of more 
sensitive molecular diagnostics and increased testing of 
extra-genital sites (particularly the pharynx) among 
MSM, which have contributed to improved detection of 
the G1407 reservoir. This increase in detection has 
enabled appropriate and effective treatment with 
combination therapy (ceftriaxone plus azithromycin).10 
By contrast, the previous first-line therapy (cefixime 
monotherapy) was not effective against cefixime-resistant 
G1407 infections, particularly in pharyngeal infections. 
G1407 appears to have been replaced by cefixime-
susceptible genogroups that might have a higher fitness. 
Thus, four of the most prevalent genogroups in 2013 
(G21, G51, G2400, G4995) were not common in 2009–10 
(appendix 1), illustrating the instability of the gonococcal 
population in the EU/EEA, and why constant monitoring 
of the population is essential. These four genogroups 
were associated with known risk groups (MSM and 
young heterosexuals), illustrating that new clones can 
expand rapidly in these populations.
We showed in regional surveillance programmes of 
sexually transmitted infections internationally that 
WGS has many benefits over NG-MAST and MLST, 
which are suboptimal for molecular epidemiology. For 
example, WGS identifies mixed infections 
and 
contaminants 
in 
samples, 
accurately 
predicts 
antimicrobial resistance in many cases, highlights 
inconsistencies between geno- 
typic and phenotypic 
antimicrobial resistance, and provides greatly improved 
epidemiological accuracy and resolution. WGS also 
allows identification of important gonococcal clades or 
clones on the basis of informative genomic markers, 
rather than typing alleles with no relevance to clinically 
important phenotypes. For example, the NG-MAST 
genogroup G1407 excludes isolates in the same WGS 
clade with identical antimicrobial resistance phenotypes 
and that contain the mosaic penAXXXIV allele, while 
simultaneously including unrelated isolates that neither 
contain penAXXXIV nor show increased extended-
spectrum cephalosporin MIC. Although NG-MAST 
genogroups fitted the WGS phylogeny relatively well, 
these and other inaccuracies (figure 2) highlight the

Data in the top left box are the phylogenetic reconstruction of the relationships of isolates in part of the Euro-GASP tree, generated by the Whole Genome Sequence 
Analysis web application. Red circles are isolates belonging to the two clusters with predicted resistance to azithromycin, based on the presence of known genetic 
determinants. Branch two-letter labels represent the country of origin of the isolates. The scale bar relates to horizontal branch lengths and indicates the number of single 
nucleotide polymorphisms that are proposed to have occurred on the branches. Data in the top right panel are the geographical distribution of isolates in the collection. 
The red pie charts at each location indicate predicted resistance to azithromycin. The larger pie chart is the total predicted azithromycin resistance in the entire collection. 
Data in the lower panel are the predicted resistance profiles of the six isolates that are highlighted in red in the top left panel. Red circles indicate predicted resistance and 
orange circles indicate where known determinants of decreased susceptibility are present, although these determinants do not necessarily lead to resistance.

flaws of MLST and NG-MAST, which simultaneously 
split clinically important, phylogenetically related 
isolates, and include phylogenetically unrelated, less 
relevant isolates. Such situations result in reduced 
power for statistical and epidemiological analyses 
(appendix 2). Furthermore, because of the NG-MAST 
genogrouping methodology, two of the most prevalent 
genogroups (G25 and G2992) in the 2009–10 Euro-GASP 
survey8 became merged in our analysis, making 
comparison between the two surveys difficult. Over 
time, such problems will worsen as variation in the 
NG-MAST and MLST alleles continues to accrue, and 
will affect our ability to track emerging clones with 
these methods.
We also adapted, optimised, and used N gonorrhoeae 
WGSA as a mechanism for user-friendly, publicly 
accessible, WGS-based molecular epidemiology to allow 
rapid analysis and visualisation of genomic phylogenetic 
relationships and the results of in-silico molecular typing 
with geographical and patient metadata. Nevertheless, to 
fully benefit from ongoing genome-based molecular 
epidemiological surveillance by use of WGSA, reporting 
of metadata in Euro-GASP and other programmes or 
projects needs to improve. WGSA also predicts anti-
microbial resistance from genomic markers. Although 
genotypic prediction of antimicrobial resistance shows 
great promise, it will never completely replace phenotypic 
antimicrobial resistance testing because novel and 
unknown antimicrobial resistance determinants cannot 
be identified, and the correlations between many 
antimicrobial resistance determinants and the MICs of 
antimicrobials are currently suboptimal. Genotypic 
predictions will, however, supplement phenotypic testing 
by highlighting discrepancies to inform re-testing and 
strengthen the external quality assessment programme 
of Euro-GASP. We showed that WGS highlighted several 
cases where the antimicrobial resistance phenotype 
was incorrect. Centralised re-phenotyping supported 
the genotypic prediction in most cases. Furthermore, 
the phenotypic antimicrobial resistance results for 
phylogenetically closely related isolates varied between 
participating countries, particularly where testing was 
decentralised. Concordantly, Eyre and colleagues23 
showed that gonococcal MICs from a global convenience 
collection could only be accurately predicted from the 
genotype if the country of testing was included in the 
model. Such inconsistencies might negatively affect 
the clinical relevance of Euro-GASP surveillance, break-
points from the European Committee on Antimicrobial 
Susceptibility Testing, our ability to monitor the 
distribution and spread of antimicrobial resistance, and 
our ability to improve the accuracy of genomic anti-
microbial resistance prediction. Despite the small 
number of discrepant isolates, this highlights the 
clinical importance of standardised and quality-assured 
phenotypic testing and WGS analysis in future Euro-
GASP surveys.
As previously described,4,7 the main limitations of Euro-
GASP include the low number and possibly suboptimal 
representativeness of isolates from some countries, 
lower number of isolates from women, and low level of 
reporting of some key epidemiological variables, such as 
sexual orientation. However, the representativeness of 
Euro-GASP was evaluated in detail in 2017
. This study24 
showed that the overall prevalence of antimicrobial 
resistance reported by Euro-GASP appropriately reflects 
the antimicrobial resistance situation in EU/EEA and 
weighting of the data did not provide very different 
overall antimicrobial resistance estimates. Nevertheless, 
improving the representativeness of Euro-GASP remains 
crucial and this work is part of the ongoing Euro-GASP 
work programme.
Genomic epidemiology of gonococci using WGSA also 
allows rapid, interactive, and nearly real-time tracking of 
high-risk clones and identification of outbreaks. These 
clones and outbreaks can be visualised with associated 
epidemiological 
characteristics 
and 
antimicrobial 
resistance data for clinical and public health purposes, 
such as to guide enhanced testing and screening, tailored 
treatment, or interventions for infection control in risk 
groups at national or international levels. More broadly, 
lineages associated with antimicrobial resistance or 
patient demographics can be identified with methods 
such 
as 
TreeBreaker,16 
which 
identify 
changing 
distributions of variables across the phylogenetic tree. 
This ability to automatically and rapidly identify changes 
in the demographics of the host population illustrates 
the clinical and epidemiological potential of genomic 
epidemiology 
to 
monitor 
high-risk 
transmission 
networks. On a smaller scale, interactive visualisation in 
WGSA allowed us to identify two short transmission 
chains within individual participating countries that 
showed resistance to azithromycin and ciprofloxacin 
and decreased susceptibility to extended-spectrum 
cephalosporins. It is important to identify such lineages 
quickly to allow intervention strategies to be targeted at 
such high-risk strains as soon as they begin to emerge. 
Automated systems could be used to highlight such 
clades for further epidemiological investigation.
For molecular epidemiology and in surveillance of the 
antimicrobial resistance of gonococci nationally and 
internationally, WGS should soon be the method of 
choice. WGS becomes more cost-effective every year, and 
platforms such as WGSA provide automated analysis of 
WGS data linked to patient metadata. However, 
appropriate funding, capacity building, and quality 
assurance remain essential for use of WGS in national 
and international surveillance of gonococci.
