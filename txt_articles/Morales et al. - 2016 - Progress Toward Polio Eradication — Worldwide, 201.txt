Progress Toward Polio Eradication — Worldwide, 2015–2016
Michelle Morales, MD1,2; Rudolf H. Tangermann, MD3; Steven G.F. Wassilak, MD2
In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate 
poliomyelitis. Wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission persists in 
only two countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan) after the removal of 
Nigeria from the list of countries with endemic polio in September 
2015.* Indigenous WPV type 2 has not been detected since 1999 
and was declared eradicated by the Global Commission for the 
Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication in September 2015.† 
Since November 2012, when the last case of WPV type 3 was 
detected in Nigeria, WPV type 1 has been the sole circulating 
type of WPV (1). This report summarizes global progress toward 
polio eradication during 2015–2016 and updates previous reports 
(2). In 2015, 74 WPV cases were reported in two countries 
(Afghanistan and Pakistan), a decrease of 79% from the 359 
WPV cases reported in 2014 in nine countries; 12 WPV cases 
have been reported in 2016 (to date), compared with 23 during 
the same period in 2015 (3). Paralytic polio caused by circulating 
vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) remains a risk in areas with 
low oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) coverage. Seven countries, 
including Pakistan, reported 32 cVDPV cases in 2015 (4). In four 
of these countries, ≥6 months have passed since the most recent 
case or isolate. One country (Laos) with VDPV transmission in 
2015 has reported three additional cVDPV cases in 2016 to date. 
Encouraging progress toward polio eradication has been made 
over the last year; however, interruption of WPV transmission 
will require focus on reaching and vaccinating every missed child 
through high quality supplementary immunization activities 
(SIAs) and cross-border coordination between Afghanistan and 
Pakistan (5,6).
Routine Poliovirus Vaccination Coverage
Estimated global coverage among infants aged ≤1 year 
with 3 doses of OPV (OPV3) through routine immunization 
was 88% in 2014 (the most recent year for which complete 
data are available). WHO and the United Nations Children’s 
Fund estimate that OPV3 coverage by WHO region was 80% 
in the African Region, 86% in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region, 95% in the European Region, 90% in the Region of 
the Americas, 90% in the South-East Asia Region, and 87% 
in the Western Pacific Region; considerable inter- and intra-
country variability exists. National OPV3 coverage was 75% 
in Afghanistan and 72% in Pakistan; coverage is estimated to 
be substantially lower in areas with WPV transmission (5–7).
Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs)
In 2015, approximately 2 billion OPV doses were adminis-
tered during 231 SIAs in five WHO regions (Table 1), including 
1.2 billion doses administered during national immunization 
days, 770 million during subnational immunization days, 
11 million during child health days, and 22 million during 
large-scale door-to-door SIAs (“mop-up” activities) in areas 
where poliovirus was known or suspected to be circulating. 
Approximately 1.2 billion of the administered doses were tri-
valent (tOPV, containing OPV types 1, 2, and 3), 843 million 
were bivalent (bOPV, containing types 1 and 3), and 5 million 
were monovalent type 1 OPV doses.
Poliovirus Surveillance
Polio cases caused by either WPV or cVDPV are detected 
through surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and sub-
sequent stool specimen testing at WHO-accredited laboratories 
in the Global Polio Laboratory Network. The main indicators of 
adequate surveillance include 1) an annual nonpolio AFP rate 
of ≥1 case per 100,000 population aged <15 years for countries 
in WHO regions certified as polio free, or a rate of ≥2 for all 
other countries and 2) adequate stool specimens collected from 
≥80% of reported AFP cases.§ In 2015, both performance indi-
cators were met nationally in six (75%; Afghanistan, Guinea, 
Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Ukraine) of the eight countries 
reporting WPV and cVDPV cases during 2015–2016. Although 
Afghanistan and Pakistan both met these AFP surveillance 
indicators, evidence suggests ongoing gaps in AFP surveillance 
quality, based on review of case epidemiology, results of envi-
ronmental sampling, and subnational indicators (8).

Reported Poliovirus Cases
Countries reporting WPV cases. In 2015, a total of 74 
WPV cases were identified (Figure); 54 (73%) were detected 
in Pakistan, and 20 (27%) were detected in Afghanistan. No 
WPV cases were identified in countries outside of Pakistan and 
Afghanistan during 2015–2016 (to date). During January 1–
May 4, 2016, the low transmission season for polio, 12 cases 
were reported worldwide; eight were detected in Pakistan and 
four in Afghanistan (Table 2).
Afghanistan reported 20 cases in 16 districts in 2015, compared 
with 28 cases in 19 districts in 2014, representing a 29% reduc-
tion in the number of cases reported. In 2015, 40% of cases were 
reported from Nangarhar province in the eastern region. During 
January 1–May 4, 2016, four WPV cases were detected (three in 
Kunar province in the eastern region and one in Helmand province), 
compared with one case detected during the same period in 2015.
Pakistan reported an 82% decrease in the number of WPV 
cases reported, from 306 cases in 44 districts in 2014 to 54 cases 
in 23 districts in 2015. During January 1–May 4, 2016, eight 
WPV cases were reported, compared with 22 cases during the 
same time period in 2015, representing a 64% decrease. All 
five regions reporting WPV in Pakistan reported a decreased 
number of cases in 2015; the decrease was largest (91% reduc-
tion in cases) in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.
Countries reporting cVDPV cases. In 2015, a total of 
32 cVDPV cases were reported from seven countries. Outbreaks 
of cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) occurred in Laos (eight cases), 
Madagascar (10 cases), and Ukraine (two cases), and outbreaks 
of cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) occurred in Guinea (seven cases), 
Myanmar (two cases), Nigeria (one case), and Pakistan (two cases).

Four of the seven countries with cVDPV cases in 2015 had 
continued transmission from cVDPV cases in 2014, including 
Guinea (one case), Madagascar (one case), Nigeria (30 cases), and 
Pakistan (21 cases). Countries reporting cVDPV cases in 2015 
with ≥6 months since the most recent case include Pakistan (most 
recent case February 9, 2015), Ukraine (July 7, 2015), Madagascar 
(August 22, 2015), and Myanmar (October 5, 2015). Laos 
reported three additional cVDPV1 cases in 2016 (to date), for a 
total of 11 cases during the outbreak; to date, no cVDPV2 cases 
have been reported in 2016. However, an environmental sample 
collected in Borno State, Nigeria, in March 2016 recently tested 
positive for cVDPV2 and is linked to prior circulation.
Discussion
Substantial gains toward polio eradication were made in 
2015, with a 79% decrease in the number of polio cases 
reported worldwide compared with the number of cases 
reported in 2014. The removal of Nigeria from the list of 
countries with endemic polio in 2015 creates the opportunity 
for the African Region to join the Region of the Americas and 
the South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and European regions, as 
the fifth of six WHO regions to be certified free of indigenous 
WPV. Certification will occur after a minimum of 3 years of 
sensitive AFP surveillance. In addition, the Global Commission 
for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication’s declaration 
of the eradication of WPV type 2 in 2015, and the absence of 
reported circulation of WPV type 3 since 2012, allows focus on 
WPV type 1 as the sole circulating type of WPV in the world, 
endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan. WHO considers the 
continued transmission of WPV type 1 between both coun-
tries to constitute a public health emergency of international 
concern under the 2005 International Health Regulations.¶ 
Continued focus on identifying groups of children who 
missed polio vaccination through routine immunization or 
SIAs, improving SIA quality, and increasing AFP surveillance 
sensitivity in these countries is needed to stop transmission.
In 2015, Afghanistan had a major reduction in WPV cases. 
The majority of cases were reported from Nangarhar province 
in eastern Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan, and were 
genetically linked to cases in Pakistan, emphasizing the need for 
continued improvement of cross-border coordination and SIA 
synchronization. Although some children are missed during SIAs 
in Afghanistan because of inaccessibility and security concerns, 
the majority are missed during SIAs because of managerial issues, 
including inadequate microplanning and campaign implemen-
tation. The southern region, although accessible for program 
implementation, has very limited access for supervision and 
monitoring. Innovative approaches, such as the 4th-day revisit 
strategy during campaigns, the use of permanent vaccination 
teams dedicated to regular house-to-house visits, and vaccina-
tion at transit points leading in and out of insecure areas need 
to continue to be regularly used to reach all missed children (5). 
The recent establishment of emergency operations centers at the 
national level and in three critical regions enhances the country’s 
capacity to plan and implement polio eradication activities.
Progress in Pakistan accounted for most of the sharp decline 
in the number of polio cases during 2015–2016. The substan-
tial gains made are, at least in part, attributable to the establish-
ment of a cohesive national emergency operations center that 
implemented a rigorous National Polio Eradication Emergency 
Action Plan (6). However, operational problems with vaccina-
tion of all children during SIAs, program accountability at all 
levels, and ongoing movement of unvaccinated children across 
the Afghanistan-Pakistan border remain challenges facing the 
polio program in Pakistan.
Although no WPV cases were detected in countries without 
endemic WPV circulation, seven countries reported cVDPV 
outbreaks during 2015–2016, demonstrating the risk for 
VDPV emergence associated with low OPV coverage. In each 
of these countries, certain factors, such as the concurrent Ebola 
epidemic in Guinea and instability in vaccine procurement 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission is now endemic in only 
Afghanistan and Pakistan. During 2014–2015, outbreaks of WPV 
in five countries without endemic polio were successfully 
ended, and Nigeria was removed from the list of countries with 
endemic polio transmission.
What is added by this report?
WPV transmission has continued in Afghanistan and Pakistan 
during 2016; compared with transmission in 2015, the number 
of WPV cases decreased. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 
remains a risk in areas with low oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) 
coverage, with five countries reporting ongoing outbreaks 
during 2015–2016. In April 2016, 154 countries and territories 
discontinued use of type 2 Sabin vaccine by simultaneously 
switching from trivalent OPV (containing types 1, 2, and 3) to 
bivalent OPV (containing types 1 and 3) for routine and 
supplementary immunization.
What are the implications for public health practice?
With progress made toward interruption of WPV transmission in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, the world is closer than ever to the 
eradication of polio. To stop transmission, continued coopera-
tion between the two countries is needed, with a focus on 
identifying groups of missed children, improving quality of 
supplementary immunization activities, and increasing the 
sensitivity of acute flaccid paralysis surveillance.

and public trust in Ukraine, diminished the quality of routine 
immunization services and allowed the emergence and spread 
of the outbreaks. Approximately 95% of cVDPV cases since 
2006 have been caused by cVDPV2 (9). Therefore, with cer-
tification of the eradication of WPV type 2, in April 2016, 
154 of 155 planned countries and territories** discontinued 
use of type 2 Sabin vaccine by switching from tOPV to 
bOPV for routine and supplementary immunization during 
a globally synchronized initiative that spanned 2 weeks, from 
April 17–May 1, 2016 (9). The global switch from tOPV to 
bOPV will markedly reduce the risk associated with type 2 
cVDPV emergence and transmission; however, the global 
community must continue to support strong routine immu-
nization service delivery to curb the risk for type 1 or type 3 
cVDPV outbreaks or transmission after WPV importation 
from countries with endemic poliovirus transmission.
With progress made during 2015–2016 toward interruption 
of WPV transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the world 
is closer than ever to the eradication of polio. Continued coop-
eration between the two countries is needed for this goal to be 
reached. In addition, the greater worldwide community needs 
to remain vigilant in implementing the Global Polio Eradication 
Initiative’s Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan for 
2013–2018 to end WPV and VDPV transmission (10).
