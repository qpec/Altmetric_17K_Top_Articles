Abstract
Background: Mobile phone usage has been rapidly increasing worldwide. mHealth could efficiently deliver high-quality health
care, but the evidence supporting its current effectiveness is still mixed.
Objective: We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews to assess the impact or effectiveness of mobile health
(mHealth) interventions in different health conditions and in the processes of health care service delivery.
Methods: We used a common search strategy of five major scientific databases, restricting the search by publication date,
language, and parameters in methodology and content. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Measurement Tool to
Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist.
Results: The searches resulted in a total of 10,689 articles. Of these, 23 systematic reviews (371 studies; more than 79,665
patients) were included. Seventeen reviews included studies performed in low- and middle-income countries. The studies used
diverse mHealth interventions, most frequently text messaging (short message service, SMS) applied to different purposes
(reminder, alert, education, motivation, prevention). Ten reviews were rated as low quality (AMSTAR score 0-4), seven were
rated as moderate quality (AMSTAR score 5-8), and six were categorized as high quality (AMSTAR score 9-11). A beneficial
impact of mHealth was observed in chronic disease management, showing improvement in symptoms and peak flow variability
in asthma patients, reducing hospitalizations and improving forced expiratory volume in 1 second; improving chronic pulmonary
diseases symptoms; improving heart failure symptoms, reducing deaths and hospitalization; improving glycemic control in diabetes
patients; improving blood pressure in hypertensive patients; and reducing weight in overweight and obese patients. Studies also
showed a positive impact of SMS reminders in improving attendance rates, with a similar impact to phone call reminders at
reduced cost, and improved adherence to tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus therapy in some scenarios, with evidence
of decrease of viral load.
Conclusions: Although mHealth is growing in popularity, the evidence for efficacy is still limited. In general, the methodological
quality of the studies included in the systematic reviews is low. For some fields, its impact is not evident, the results are mixed,
or no long-term studies exist. Exceptions include the moderate quality evidence of improvement in asthma patients, attendance
rates, and increased smoking abstinence rates. Most studies were performed in high-income countries, implying that mHealth is
still at an early stage of development in low-income countries.

 Introduction
Mobile phone usage has been rapidly increasing worldwide
[1,2]. In many high-income countries, mobile phone
subscriptions exceed the population, and in many low- and
middle-income countries, this number is expanding faster than
other infrastructures [2]. Mobile technology’s mobility,
instantaneous access, and direct communication allow for faster
transfer of health information, which in turn supports medical
and public health practices. These characteristics define mobile
health (mHealth). mHealth could transform the worldwide
delivery of health services, especially in low- and middle-income
countries. This includes simple apps and complex technologies
including voice, text messaging (short message service, SMS),
multimedia message service, Bluetooth technology, and others
[3].
mHealth is increasingly being used (1) for patient
communication, monitoring, and education, (2) to reduce the
burden of diseases linked with poverty, (3) to improve access
to health services, clinical diagnosis, and treatment adherence,
and (4) for chronic disease management [4-6].
It is commonly stated that mHealth effectively improves the
quality of care and that it can quickly be adapted on a large scale
and at low cost, but evidence regarding its effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness is still lacking in different areas. As the
evidence in this field is consistently growing, many systematic
reviews have already been performed. A thorough review of
available evidence is essential to guide clinical and health policy
decisions. Consequently, complex reviews, which may assess
multiple interventions, different or distinct populations, and
different outcomes may adequately support health policy
decision making in this context [7]. Therefore, the objective of
this study was to perform a systematic review of systematic
reviews that assessed the effectiveness of mHealth interventions
in different health conditions and in the processes of health care
service delivery, in order to investigate for which areas there is
evidence and which areas still require further studies.
Methods
This study is a systematic review of systematic reviews and is
part of a series of four reviews that assessed the impact to
telehealth strategies in different health conditions and in health
care service delivery. The study was conducted in accordance
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and the methodological
considerations when using existing systematic reviews [7].
Search Strategy and Inclusion Criteria
A literature search was performed using MEDLINE (accessed
by PubMed), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Cochrane (Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials, Cochrane Methodology Register, Database
of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, National Health Service
Economic Evaluation Database), Literatura Latino-Americana
e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), and Indice
Bibliográfico Español de Ciencias de la Salud (IBECS) in
November 2015. Cochrane, LILACS, and IBECS were assessed
by Virtual Health Library (Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde). The
search was restricted to studies in humans, publication date
(from January 1, 2000, up to the search data), and publication
language (English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese).
We used a common search strategy and allocated relevant
studies to their respective reviews before assessing their risk of
bias and extracting data. The search strategies for each database
are given in Multimedia Appendix 1. All studies were included
in the software StArt (State of the Art through Systematic
Review) [8]. In this software, different combinations of the
terms “systematic” and “review” identified systematic reviews
by title or abstract.
An additional search using the same terms and parameters was
performed in February 2016. The new search was more specific
to make assessment manageable and was supplemented by a
manual search of reference lists [9].
Study Selection
Systematic reviews covering the effectiveness or cost-benefit
analysis of eHealth interventions were included. Exclusion
criteria were (1) studies about feasibility, user acceptance, or
usability, (2) studies that assessed “perceived benefits,” and (3)
nonsystematic reviews.
Initial screening was based on titles and abstracts, and articles
were independently evaluated. Abstracts lacking information
were retrieved for full-text evaluation. Subsequently, 2
investigators independently evaluated full-text articles and
determined eligibility. Authorship, journal, or years were not
blinded.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Five investigators conducted data extraction following
standardized criteria, and results were reviewed by 2 senior
researchers. The following data were extracted: journal,
publication 
year, 
databases 
searched, 
time 
period,
setting/scenario, theme/specialty, objective, intervention type,
number of studies, total number and countries of patients, study
design, whether a review of systematic reviews or meta-analysis
was performed, outcomes, main results, lessons and barriers for
implementation, and main limitations. For cost analysis, the
type and the perspective (ie, patient, health care provider, and/or
society) were also extracted. Studies were evaluated using the
Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR)
checklist for assessing methodological quality [10].
Results
A flow diagram of literature search and study selection results
is shown in Figure 1. The database first search resulted in 10,106
articles, the updated search resulted in 572 articles, and 11
studies were found from additional sources. After exclusion of
duplicates, 625 articles were screened and 537 were excluded.
Full text of 88 eligible articles was reviewed. Out of these, 62
were excluded for not meeting the criteria relating to study type,
intervention, or outcome. Three studies [5,11,12] were excluded
for being included in a systematic review of systematic reviews
that was included in this manuscript, to avoid duplication. The
23 studies remaining were included in this systematic review.

Descriptive Analysis of the Systematic Reviews
General Characteristics of Reviewed Papers
The 23 systematic reviews included (Multimedia Appendix 2)
were published between 2009 and 2016 in 16 journals. The
systematic reviews involved 371 studies. After verifying the
sample size of each study, we found that at least 79,665
participants were included. In these reviews, systematic literature
searches were performed from 1950 to April 2015 (see
Multimedia Appendix 2).
Of the reviews, 17 included studies that were performed in low-
and middle-income countries, 13 included studies in multiple
settings, 6 specified particular settings, and 2 did not describe
the setting. mHealth modalities described were mainly apps for
chronic diseases, but also for disease management, treatment
adherence, and changes in health behavior. Nine studies
performed a meta-analysis [13-21].
Objective
The main objective of the reviews was to analyze the impact or
effectiveness of mHealth interventions on chronic and
noncommunicable diseases. Other focuses were to analyze
mHealth in supporting chronic diseases management, health
behavior change, attendance at appointments, disease and
rehabilitation management, and the use of mHealth strategies
by health workers.
Intervention
Different devices were used, including mobile phones,
smartphones, personal digital assistants, MP3, phone plus app,
medical device connected to phone by cord or wirelessly, and
many others.
The most frequent intervention was SMS for reminders,
education, motivation, or prevention. Sensors and point-of-care
diagnosis, data collection, provider-provider communication,
patient-provider communication, decision support, client
education, provider work planning, training, protocol-based
treatment, voicemail, videos, immediate physician feedback
from a central location, cloud-based interactive voice response,
disease management calls, disease monitoring, automated email
to clinicians, treatment adherence, and phone counseling were
also used.
These interventions were performed for smoking cessation, to
increase physical activity, chronic disease management,
chemotherapy-related symptoms monitoring, sexual health
behavior safety, alcohol consumption reduction, medication

 adherence, appointment attendance, stress management and
anxiety reduction, vaccination timeliness, prenatal support,
reduction in emergency referrals or adverse events, health
information access, cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills, patient
satisfaction, and social functioning.
Hall et al [22] categorized 12 common applications: (1) client
education and behavior change, (2) sensors and point-of-care
diagnostics, (3) registries and vital events tracking, (4) data
collection and reporting, (5) electronic health records, (6)
electronic decision support: information, protocols, algorithms,
checklists, (7) provider-provider communication: user groups
and consultation, (8) provider work planning, (9) provider
training and education, (10) human resource management, (11)
supply chain management, and (12) financial transactions and
incentives.
Multiple interventions were used on significantly varied targets,
and the duration of follow-up varied from a few minutes to up
to 24 months.
Control Group
The control group care was not clear in some reviews [16,23,24],
but others were very specific.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes assessed were clinical outcomes (eg,
frequency of hypoglycemic events, symptoms, deaths), surrogate
outcomes (eg, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], blood pressure,
lipid profile, cardiovascular disease risk profiles, lung function
tests results, nebulizer use, weight, body mass index [BMI]),
behavioral or lifestyle changes (eg, sexual behavior, smoking
cessation, increase in physical activity), and processes of care
(eg, attendance rates, compliance with medication taking, data
management, communication performance, time to diagnosis,
time to treatment, changes in professionals’ workload).
The secondary outcomes were cost, patient satisfaction, and
potential harms and adverse effects.
Quality of Included Studies
Multimedia Appendix 3 shows the results of the quality
assessment of the 23 systematic reviews. Ten were rated low
quality (AMSTAR score 0-4), seven moderate quality (score
5-8), and six were high quality (score 9-11).
Regarding bias risk assessment, 10 reviews did not explicitly
report on study quality assessment. Two specified that the risk
of bias was mostly either low or unclear [25]. Free et al [18,19]
related that only 4 trials were at low risk of bias in all areas. All
studies included in Car et al [13] had high risk of bias.
Baron et al used the McMaster University quality assessment
tool and reported that the overall quality was poor [26]. Fanning
et al used the Guide to Community Preventative Services data
extraction form and reported that 7 studies were rated “fair” and
4 were “good” [16]. Three reviews [27] used the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [28]
reporting varying methodological quality, with some providing
insufficient information.
Two reviews reported adequate sequence generation for
randomization [20]. De Jongh et al [17] reported adequate
sequence generation in 3 of 4 and that none of the included
studies were clear if the allocation was concealed. A potential
for bias occurred from the apparent lack of blinding of outcome
assessors. In Vodopivec-Jamsek et al [27], allocation
concealment was considered adequate in 2 studies and unclear
in 2 studies. Only one study reported on blinding of personnel
collecting and analyzing samples. No mention is made of
blinding of outcome assessors or researchers, which could have
introduced bias.
Incomplete data analysis methods varied, with analysis and
reporting based on intention-to-treat analysis and on only
participants who completed the study, which could influence
generalizability of the findings. Substantial heterogeneity was
detected across analyses; however, a post hoc decision to
conduct the main analysis using a random-effects model resulted
in no difference in the interpretation of findings. Bacigalupo et
al [29] also used Cochrane guidance [28], reporting that 4 of 7
studies presented low risk of bias. The only studies in which
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and
Evaluation (GRADE) methodology [30] was used were those
published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
[13,15,17,20,27].
Main Results
The reviews show a variety of results, as expected, for using
different devices and different mHealth interventions on
different populations. The most widely used and successful
intervention was SMS addressed to chronic disease patients.
Positive impact was reported on clinical outcomes, adherence
to treatment and care, health behavior changes, disease
management, attendance rates, and others. However, some
reviews showed conflicting results, with no significant
differences between intervention and control groups.
Clinical Outcomes
Asthma
Positive impact has been demonstrated with moderate-quality
evidence that text messaging interventions showed greater
improvements in the pooled symptom score (mean difference
0.36, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.17) compared with the control group
[17]. Very low-quality evidence (GRADE Very Low) showed
the following: increased office visits in the SMS group, whereas
increased hospital admissions for the control group [17]; a
reduction in hospitalizations and better symptom control using
home spirometry transmission to physicians via SMS and
telephone counseling [25]; increased unscheduled visits to the
emergency department and hospitalizations using mobile
phone-based interactive self-care software plus management
feedback on pulmonary function [25]; and improvements in
cough and nighttime symptoms and decreased daily doses of
medication using peak flow and symptoms monitoring via SMS
[31].
Cardiac Rehabilitation
Exercise capacity in cardiac rehabilitation improved a 6-minute
walk test from 524-637 meters (P=.009) in monitored exercise
training assisted by a mobile phone app. In an 8-week,

 nonrandomized clinical trial, there was 17.6% (SD 16.1)
improvement in mobile (n=30) versus 11.5% (SD 35.9) in
control group (n=32) (P>.05) [32].
Congestive Heart Failure
Mobile technology counseling led to fewer symptom complaints
in congestive heart failure subjects [25]. There was relative risk
reduction (20%) of death or hospitalization and better quality
of life with nurse telephone intervention and cardiologist support
[33].
Chronic Lung Diseases
An SMS program improved cough symptoms and sleep quality
[34]. Mobile phones recorded respiratory symptoms during
exercise training that increased walking distance [34].
Chemotherapy Symptoms
No statistically significant effects were demonstrated on
chemotherapy-related toxicity symptoms when patients used a
mobile phone app to report symptoms and receive self-care
advice [18].
Diabetes
Educational group sessions for diabetic women via SMS showed
positive effects on sleep, positive actions, and coping [35].
Surrogate Outcomes
Asthma
There was moderate-quality evidence that text messaging
intervention led to greater improvements in peak flow variability
(mean difference -11.12, 95% CI -19.56 to -2.68) compared
with the control group. No significant differences existed
between groups in impact on forced vital capacity or forced
expiratory flow in 1 second (GRADE Moderate) [17].
Forced expiratory flow in 1 second improved after 4 months of
home spirometry transmission to physicians via SMS and
telephone counseling [25]. Using mobile phone-based,
interactive self-care software plus management feedback on
pulmonary function showed evidence of improvement in
pulmonary function and health-related quality of life and
decreased unscheduled visits to emergency departments and
hospitalizations, plus an increase in the proportion of participants
who received leukotriene inhibitors [25].
Cardiac Rehabilitation
Improvement in at least 1 risk factor (relative risk [RR] 1.4,
95% CI 1.1-1.7) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that
assessed the impact of lifestyle counseling, mobile intervention,
devices for home monitoring plus SMS messaging of
recommendations, compared to lifestyle counseling alone. The
mHealth group was more likely to achieve goals for blood
pressure (BP) (62.1% vs 42.9%), HbA1c (86.4% vs 54.2%), and
BMI (0.37 kg/m2decrease vs 0.38 increase). No significant
differences in smoking cessation, cholesterol, or medication
adherence [32].
Chronic Lung Diseases
Three RCTs showed nonsignificant results in lung function
parameters [34].
Diabetes
Educational program via SMS for self-management improved
HbA1c, 
low-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol, 
and
microalbuminuria [33]. Cloud-based interactive voice response
calls and automated email for clinicians reduced HbA1c [33].
SMS promoting medication adherence reduced fasting plasma
glucose and 2-hour, postprandial glucose [33]. SMS with tailored
instructions on diabetes mellitus care to adolescents and elderly
patients improved HbA1c [34]. Diabetes self-management
intervention reduced HbA1c [18]. Diabetes education and advice
via mobile phone and SMS significantly reduced HbA1c [31].
A mobile phone-based, home glucose monitoring program study
decreased HbA1c from 13.2% to 10.5% after 3-6 months [35].
Text messaging improved HbA1c, with positive results in 6 of
8 studies [36]. Daily glucose readings were transmitted via
mobile phone to a physician who made adjustments plus clinic
appointment [25].
The results were mixed on the impact of mobile telemonitoring
supporting diabetes management and feedback on HbA1c but
were more consistently positive for studies in type 2 diabetes.
Ten of the 13 studies in type 2 diabetes and 4 of 7 studies on
type 1 diabetes found mHealth led to HbA1c improvement [26].
Studies without health care professional feedback led to HbA1c
improvement, suggesting professional feedback might not be
necessary [26]
However, one study showed reduced benefit: educational group
sessions for diabetic women via SMS showed higher diastolic
blood pressure (+7 mmHg) and less spiritual hope at 6 months,
and frequent texters had higher BMI and more sedentary time
[35]
HIV Management
Text messages to maintain contact, monitor, and respond to
medication issues in patients on antiretrovirals statistically
significantly reduced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
viral load by improving adherence [18].
Hypertension
Improvement in BP has been demonstrated with SMS or voice
mail and immediate physician feedback [33]; SMS enabling
interactive monitoring, where the provider sets reminders for
patients, collects data, and schedules visits [34]; and electronic
salt sensor and mobile sensor [34].
However, other reviews showed no benefit. Two trials showed
no statistically significant reduction in BP [18]. Groups that did
or did not receive alerts and reminders had nearly equal
percentages of patients with controlled BP at follow-up [31].
Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease
Significant improvements were shown with automatic
sphygmomanometer, blood glucose and lipid meter, and mobile
phone [34].
Weight Loss
Moderate-quality evidence of short-term weight loss in
overweight and obese adults with BMI of 25-39.9 using mHealth
structured program was shown [29]. Mobile phone personalized

 advice and motivation observed a significant improvement in
percent of body fat lost; however, BMI and systolic and diastolic
BP were unchanged [31].
Behavioral or Lifestyle Changes
Physical Activity
Seven of 14 trials reported statistically significant benefits on
self-reported physical activity outcomes, but no statistically
significant change was demonstrated on trials using SMS to
reduce calorie intake and increase physical activity or for trials
targeting physical activity only, diet only, or diet and physical
activity [18].
Smoking Cessation
Positive results have been demonstrated with moderate-quality
evidence that mobile phone-based cessation interventions
increased abstinence rates at 26 weeks (RR 1.67 95% CI
1.46-1.90, 12 RCTs in high income countries, 11,885
participants, GRADE Moderate). Six studies verified quitting
biochemically at 6 months (RR 1.83 95% CI 1.54-2.19) [20].
SMS-based 
smoking 
cessation 
interventions 
doubled
biochemically verified smoking cessation at 6 months [18].
Sexual Behavior
One study showed statistically significant benefits on behavior
change [18].
Processes of Care
Antenatal Support
Pregnant women connecting to their health care provider through
bidirectional mobile phone messaging were more likely to have
skilled birth attendants [37].
Attendance Rates
A consistent improvement on attendance rates has been
demonstrated. Text message reminders improved the rate of
attendance at health care appointments compared with no
reminders (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.03-1.17) (7 studies, 5841
participants, GRADE Moderate) [15]. They had a similar impact
to phone call reminders (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.02) (3 studies,
2509 participants, GRADE Moderate). Text messages plus
postal reminders improved attendance rates at appointments
compared to postal reminders (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.19) (1
study, 291 participants, GRADE Low) [13].
In a limited study, Shetty et al [38] compared the effect of one
SMS reminder sent to type 2 diabetes patients every third day
for 1 year. Although there was no significant reduction in the
mean HbA1c values in either group, the percentage of patients
with HbA1c<8% decreased significantly in the SMS group. Free
et al [18] included one study assessing SMS reminders on
attendance for vaccination at different time points (as different
studies). The relative risk was 1.19 (95% CI 1.15-1.23), but
there was significant heterogeneity (I2=99.7%, P<.001) [33].
In 8 studies Free et al [19] observed that the pooled effect on
appointment attendance using text message reminders versus
no reminder was RR 1.06 (95% CI 1.05-1.07) [19]. There was
no effect on the number of cancelled appointments (RR 1.08,
95% CI 0.89-1.30), and no difference in attendance using SMS
reminders versus other reminders (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.02)
[19].
Hall et al [22] assessed 6 studies in low- and middle-income
countries. The studies showed mHealth interventions to be
beneficial, except a pilot study in rural Swaziland [39]. Mahmud
et al [40] trained community health workers to use mobile
phones for reporting on patient adherence, send appointments
reminders, and answer physician queries. This evaluation was
based on a retrospective observational study, with the possibility
of recall bias.
Data Collection and Health Care Team Communication
Studies that included data collection as a primary mHealth
function demonstrated that mobile phones effectively collect
and report data, transfer patient-relevant information, and reduce
the need for face-to-face communication [37]. There is a
reduction in communication delays and improvement on data
collection and reporting [23]. One trial reported a statistically
significant improvement in nurse/surgeon communication using
mobile phones [19].
Adherence to Treatment
mHealth strategies are beneficial to increase adherence to
treatment in diabetes patients: SMS to increase adherence to
prescriptions in type 2 diabetes [25], electronic blister packs
with SMS communication [34], and insulin adherence among
type 1 diabetes patients who received tailored text messages
with goal-specific prompts [31].
Compliance with medication taking among memory-impaired,
HIV-positive patients significantly increased compared to those
without impairment. Hepatitis A and B dose vaccination
schedules also increased among international travelers with
reminders sent to mobile phones [31].
Hall et al reported improved adherence to tuberculosis treatment
by using text messages and adherence to HIV therapy, with
evidence of reduction of viral load [22], although the authors
did not perform quality assessment. The authors commented
that a risk-benefit analysis that assessed mHealth reminders to
improve tuberculosis medication adherence showed increased
mortality and disability-adjusted life years compared to directly
observed treatments, and that an RCT in China observed no
benefit with voice calls. They also reported limited evidence of
contraceptive knowledge improvement with the use of an SMS
education scheme; risk reduction of contracting dengue fever,
but no significant improvement over alternative schemes;
antenatal care improvement, with increases in using skilled birth
attendants and women with 4 antenatal visits; and improved
vaccination rates in rural Kenya [22].
Hamine et al observed in 2 studies that text messaging tailored
to counteract negative beliefs about asthma and education was
associated with improved adherence to medication [34].
Diagnosis
Hall et al mentioned studies showing improvement of diagnostic
rates of dermatological conditions with mobile teledermatology
[17]. However, two trials using mobile phones to transmit photos
to offsite clinicians reported significant reductions in correct
diagnoses compared to an onsite specialist [18]. One trial

 reported reduction in quality of electrocardiography (ECG)
transmitted via mobile phone to an ECG transmitted by fax, but
with no effects on ECG interpretation [18]. Krishna et al [31]
showed that fewer days to diagnosis and treatment were reported
among those who were notified of test results via text messages.
Cost
The following studies assessed costs, with evidence of reduction
when compared to control groups. SMS reminders were more
cost-effective than telephone and were equally efficacious [25].
SMS was found to be 35% and 45% less expensive, respectively,
per attendance through reductions in research assistants’ work
hours and in telecommunications costs. SMS reminders were
less expensive than mobile phone reminders [33,40]. The relative
cost of the text message per attendance was 55% and 65% of
the cost of phone call reminders [13]. There was a reduction in
patient burden to transportation time and costs in African
countries [23]. The cost of text-based support per 1000 enrolled
smokers was GB 278 per quitter, but when future health service
costs were included, text-based support was considered a
cost-saver [20].
Patient Satisfaction
The individual studies did not assess this outcome.
Potential Harms and Adverse Effects
Only 
3 
reviews 
assessed 
this 
outcome 
[15,17,27].
Vodopivec-Jamsek et al [27] reported one study where mobile
phone messaging was used to support smoking cessation and
that messaging did not have any impact on rates of pain in the
thumb or finger joints (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74-1.59), or car crash
rates (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.58-1.35) at 26 weeks follow-up.
Discussion
Principal Findings
The current evidence shows benefits of mHealth in chronic
disease management, improving symptoms and peak flow
variability in asthma patients and chronic pulmonary diseases
symptoms; heart failure symptoms, reducing deaths and
hospitalization and improving quality of life; glycemic control
in diabetes patients; and improving BP in hypertensive patients.
SMS reminders improved attendance rates at reduced costs and
improved adherence to tuberculosis and HIV therapy in some
scenarios, with evidence of decrease of viral load.
Mobile devices may improve patient-provider communication,
facilitating assistance in disease management. It may increase
the likelihood of delivering health interventions to hard-to-reach
populations. Whittaker et al [20] listed advantages of using
mobile interventions: convenience, ease, cost-effectiveness,
scalability, personalization, and “the ability to send
time-sensitive messages with an ‘always on’ device.” Hamine
et al [34] observed that mHealth tools can impact patients who
are less inclined to engage with traditional health services.
Aranda-Jan et al [23] reported that governments may benefit
from increased support of patient management and increased
direct communication in rural areas. Health workers may receive
support through professional networks and can prioritize efforts
and increase their role in active case detection using disease
surveillance systems. Baron et al [26] assessed studies involving
data transferring for diabetes management and suggested that
recording and tracking of data might increase patients’
motivation to self-manage.
The most popular mHealth intervention was behavior change
interventions using text messaging. The low cost and low
broadband requirements facilitate the spread of applications,
even in low-income countries.
Different uses of motivation have also been described as a tool
to be used in mHealth interventions in some of the systematic
reviews analyzed. These are mainly focused on patient
motivation in different contexts on chronic diseases [36],
communicable diseases [23], physical activity [16,29,31], and
empowerment in the use of services [37].
Two reviews [14,32] reported lessons learned: patient needs
must be met, training and support provided, users engaged in
the development and implementation of the tools, and
consideration of patient age and education level. Usage might
improve with user-centered design, engagement strategies, and
feedback to the users.
This study provides a thorough review of available evidence on
effectiveness of mHealth interventions in different health
conditions and in the processes of health care service delivery,
so it useful to guide clinical and health policy decisions.
However, there are some limitations of the studies that need to
be addressed.
Studies assessing mHealth interventions usually do not include
the assessment of risks, consumer satisfaction, and acceptability
of the intervention [17]. None reported studies assessing security
and confidentiality. Chen et al [41] noted that mobile phone
numbers frequently change in China, reducing certainty the
message was delivered to the correct recipient. This was not
assessed elsewhere. Particularly in low-income countries where
mobile phones are frequently shared, these are important
confidentiality issues that must be taken into account when
designing interventions [15]. De Jongh et al [23] warned of
inaccurate data input, misinterpretation of the information, and
difficulties in reading due to vision or literacy problems and
remarked that text messaging cannot capture verbal and
nonverbal cues. Norwell suggested that doctors agree on
vocabulary to minimize the risk of patients’ misunderstanding
the message [38]. Risks associated with mobile phone messaging
in general may apply, such as car accidents [23].
Other drawbacks related to mHealth initiatives were reported
by Hamine et al [34] Some patients’ concerns included
dependence 
on 
professional 
supervision, 
unnecessary
medicalization, fear of technology failure, and difficulty in
understanding and using the technology. Provider concerns
related to data review and response times, increased clinical
workload and workflow, record maintenance, and concerns
about supervision and technology dependence. Aranda-Jan et
al [23] reported difficulties in monitoring text message content,
data underreporting, and the possibility of biased responses
from participants.
Two reviews cite availability and poor connectivity as barriers
[34]. Most identified the main limitation as the small number

 of RCT studies, patients enrolled, and the low-to-moderate
quality of evidence. Researchers should validate their pilot study
findings through follow-up studies with adequate research
designs and appropriate controls [17]. Aranda-Jan et al [23]
mention that claimed benefits are unclear and long-term results
uncertain. Also, only 2 reviews assessed funding [15]. This is
important to identifying conflicts of interest. To improve the
suboptimal reporting and standardize Web-based and mobile
health interventions, the CONSORT-EHEALTH was developed,
a checklist that is an extension of the CONSORT statement
[42].
Costs have not been routinely assessed. Such costs may be
dependent on the nature of the intervention and the size and
characteristics of the target group [17]. More attention to cost
implications seems warranted [27]. Additionally, future studies
should compare effects in different contexts [27].
Conclusion
Although mHealth is growing in popularity, the evidence for
efficacy is still limited. Positive results were reported for chronic
disease management, improving chronic pulmonary diseases
symptoms and heart failure symptoms, reducing deaths and
hospitalization and improving quality of life, and improving
glycemic control in diabetes patients and BP in hypertensive
patients. SMS reminders improved attendance rates and
improved adherence to tuberculosis and HIV therapy in some
scenarios. However, in general the methodological quality of
the studies included in the systematic reviews is low. For some
fields, its impact is not evident or is mixed. Exceptions are the
moderate improvement in asthma patients, attendance rates, and
smoking cessation rates.
