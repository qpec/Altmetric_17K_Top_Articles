Empirical Article
The first studies of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) 
began to appear in the psychiatric research literature in 
1984 with the influential article by Norman Rosenthal 
and colleagues at the National Institutes of Mental 
Health. In 1987, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev.; DSM-III-R; American 
Psychiatric Association, 1987) included a “seasonal pat­
tern” modifier for diagnoses of major depression and 
bipolar disorder (including not otherwise specified ver­
sions of both disorders). Subsequent editions of the DSM 
also included an optional modifier for these diagnoses 
(DSM-IV—American Psychiatric Association, 1994; DSM-
IV-TR—American Psychiatric Association, 2000; DSM-
5—American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Regardless 
of DSM edition, the basic criteria for diagnosing seasonal 
pattern are meeting the diagnostic criteria for major 
depression and experiencing recurrences that cor­
respond to particular seasons. The most commonly 
reported pattern is that of symptoms emerging in the fall 
and winter and remitting in the spring and summer.
The close correspondence in time between the emer­
gence of SAD in the psychiatric literature and the 
 
inclusion of a seasonal pattern modifier in DSM-III-R sug­
gests that the research base for major depression with 
seasonal pattern was a small number of SAD studies 
(Hansen, Skre, & Lund, 2008). Following their meeting 
with Rosenthal and his research colleague, Michael 
Terman, Robert L. Spitzer, chair of the Work Group to 
Revise DSM-III, and Janet B. W. Williams, text editor, 
reported that the seasonal pattern modifier was included 
in DSM-III-R (Spitzer & Williams, 1989). Seasonal pattern 
had not been considered by the DSM-III-R Mood Disorders 
Advisory Committee. The inclusion of the seasonal pat­
tern modifier was justified because it was considered to 
be more diagnostically valid than other included mood 
diagnoses, 
such 
as 
melancholia 
and 
dysthymia. 
Consideration was given to creating a separate diagnosis 
for SAD, but this idea was rejected because it would have

Major Depression With Seasonal  
Variation: Is It a Valid Construct?
Megan K. Traffanstedt, Sheila Mehta, and  
Steven G. LoBello
Auburn University at Montgomery
Abstract
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is based on the theory that some depressions occur seasonally in response to reduced 
sunlight. SAD has attracted cultural and research attention for more than 30 years and influenced the DSM through 
inclusion of the seasonal variation modifier for the major depression diagnosis. This study was designed to determine 
if a seasonally related pattern of occurrence of major depression could be demonstrated in a population­based study. 
A cross­sectional U.S. survey of adults completed the Patient Health Questionnaire–8 Depression Scale. Regression 
models were used to determine if depression was related to measures of sunlight exposure. Depression was unrelated 
to latitude, season, or sunlight. Results do not support the validity of a seasonal modifier in major depression. The 
idea of seasonal depression may be strongly rooted in folk psychology, but it is not supported by objective data. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing seasonal variation as a diagnostic modifier of major depression.

placed by default all other mood disorders in a nonsea­
sonal mood disorder category (Spitzer & Williams, 1989).
Work on the DSM-IV revision permitted consideration 
of research findings relevant to major depression with 
seasonal variation, much of which, again, centered pri­
marily on the SAD literature, rather than DSM-defined 
depression literature (Bauer & Dunner, 1993). Eliminating 
the concept of seasonality was considered, but major 
depression with seasonal pattern was ultimately retained 
in DSM-IV primarily based on response to treatment data 
(light therapy studies) and “natural history” (Bauer & 
Dunner, 1993, p. 166). Prior to the publication of DSM-5, 
Rosenthal (2009) argued that the SAD construct had gar­
nered enough scientific support to warrant inclusion in 
the DSM-5 as a separate disorder. Although SAD was not 
included in DSM-5, the category of major depression 
with seasonal pattern as an optional modifier was 
continued.
Research on SAD has provided the basis for major 
depression with seasonal pattern, but much of the 
research on SAD has used the Seasonal Pattern Assessment 
Questionnaire (SPAQ) for case identification (Kasper, 
Wehr, Bartko, Gaist, & Rosenthal, 1989; Levitt & Boyle, 
2002; Magnusson, 1996; Rosen et al., 1990; Rosenthal, 
Bradt, & Weir, 1987; Steinhausen, Gundelfinger, & Metzke, 
2009; Zubieta, Engleberg, Yargic, Pande, & Demitrack, 
1994). Despite its frequent use in studies of SAD, the 
SPAQ is not without significant problems that seriously 
challenge its validity as a measure of major depression 
with seasonal variation.
First, the SPAQ does not measure major depression as 
defined by the DSM. Six items on the SPAQ compose the 
Global Seasonality Scale (Murray, 2004), and these items 
query the extent to which certain behaviors (mood, eat­
ing, weight, sleep, energy, social activity) “change” with 
the seasons. In contrast, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for 
major depression specify possible symptoms of depressed 
mood, fatigue, and weight loss during the previous two 
weeks. DSM-5 major depression criteria, such as feelings 
of worthlessness or guilt, concentration difficulties, and 
thoughts of suicide, form no part of the SPAQ assessment 
of SAD (Hansen et al., 2008).
Second, the SPAQ relies on recall of past depressive 
episodes to establish cases of SAD. In clinical settings, 
recall of events is often a starting point in formulating 
diagnoses, but corroboration of self­reports by significant 
others and retrospective review of records may be of 
considerable value in supporting or ruling out diagnostic 
considerations. However, to establish the existence of a 
clinical syndrome, methods that do not rely solely on 
recall of multiple distant past events are clearly prefera­
ble. The SPAQ requires recall of mood variations over at 
least one year, possibly longer, which respondents may 
not be able to report reliably.
A question of the validity of retrospective recall of 
symptoms was of concern in establishing the DSM diag­
nosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). 
Research on PMDD that did rely on retrospective recall 
produced inflated prevalence estimates. The DSM diag­
nostic criteria for PMDD require daily symptom ratings 
over two consecutive menstrual cycles with symptom 
reduction evident between cycles (Zachar & Kendler, 
2014). Similarly, prevalence of SPAQ­identified SAD cases 
tends to drop when DSM­consistent major depression 
measures are employed (Blazer, Kessler, & Swartz, 1998; 
Levitt & Boyle, 2002; Nayyar & Cochrane, 1996; 
Steinhausen et al., 2009). Research studies that have uti­
lized both the SPAQ and some form of DSM­based diag­
nostic criteria suggest that major depression is not 
strongly related to SPAQ­identified SAD (Magnusson, 
1996; Mersch et al., 2004; Steinhausen et al., 2009; 
Thompson & Cowan, 2001; Thompson, Thompson, & 
Smith, 2004).
Between the publication of DSM-IV and that of DSM-
5, evidence accumulated contradicting the claim that 
some recurrent episodes of major depression are linked 
to seasonal changes. These studies have two characteris­
tics in common: (a) They use measures of depression 
that more closely approximate DSM major depression 
diagnostic criteria, and (b) they are cross­sectional or 
longitudinal studies based on larger, or population­rep­
resentative samples. For example, a retrospective study 
of 1,500 patient records found no relationship between 
season and diagnoses of depression based on DSM-IV 
criteria (Posternack & Zimmerman, 2002). Because of 
the SPAQ’s reliance on recall, the authors of another 
study administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS), a measure of current depression, to sea­
sonal cohorts randomly selected from a population reg­
istry during four seasons (Magnusson, Axelsson, Phil, 
Karlsson, & Oskarsson, 2000). They reported no sea­
sonal variation in mean depression scores, a finding that 
held after adjusting for age and place of residence. A 
smaller longitudinal study reported a pronounced sea­
sonal pattern when using the SPAQ but not the HADS 
(Nayyar & Cochrane, 1996). More recently, Kerr and col­
leagues (2013) reported on seasonal variations in depres­
sive symptoms in two longitudinal study samples in 
which participants completed depression scales over the 
course of several years. The authors found little if any 
association between seasonal change or solar radiation 
exposure and depression. Although the study findings 
are compelling, the authors report that samples were not 
population­representative and participants lived in the 
U.S. Midwest and Northwest. This latter circumstance 
limited variation in latitude of residence, a factor that 
supposedly corresponds with seasonal mood variation, 
particularly at latitude extremes.

We are left with doubts of whether SAD research pro­
vides any basis for the creation of the novel diagnostic 
category major depression with seasonal variation. 
Historically, major depression with seasonal variation has 
been entangled with the SAD construct, and SAD research 
has relied to a large extent on the SPAQ. The SPAQ has 
little overlap with DSM depression criteria and is vulner­
able to recall and other forms of bias. However, irrespec­
tive of the validity of the SAD construct, confidence in the 
validity of major depression with seasonal variation would 
be strengthened if seasonal variation in the prevalence of 
depression were demonstrated in a study that (a) utilizes 
a depression measure consistent with DSM diagnostic cri­
teria; (b) is based on a large, population­representative 
sample; (c) is conducted such that interviewers and 
respondents are unaware of the seasonal hypothesis; and 
(d) controls for the effects of variables other than season­
ality known to be correlated with depression (e.g., sex, 
employment status; Dooley, Prause, & Ham­Rowbottom, 
2000; Hasin, Goodwin, Stinson, & Grant, 2005). These are 
the salient characteristics of the current study, which is 
designed to investigate whether depression scores in the 
general population, as well as prevalent cases of major 
depression, display seasonal variation as predicted by 
SAD theory and as specified in DSM-5.
Method
Materials and procedure
The research described in this article was exempt from 
review by the Institutional Review Board at Auburn 
University at Montgomery.
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) is an annual health behavior survey that gathers 
current information regarding health risk behaviors, 
health care access, and preventative measures (Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). The 
standardized questionnaire is administered as a random­
digit dialing telephone survey performed in the United 
States at the state level (including territories) to gather 
information about current risk behaviors and health prac­
tices (CDC, 2013). The 2006 BRFSS data set was selected 
for this study because incentives for administering the 
Anxiety and Depression Module were available that year, 
and 36 states gave this part of the survey (CDC, 2007). 
This survey module includes the Patient Health 
Questionnaire–8 (PHQ­8), a measure of current depres­
sion (Kroenke et al., 2009; Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002).
The Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk 
Trends (SMART) is a subset of the 2006 BRFSS created to 
provide county­level estimates of health behaviors and 
risks within metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas 
(CDC, 2011). Metropolitan statistical areas are counties 
with 50,000 or more inhabitants, and micropolitan statis­
tical areas are counties with at least 10,000 but fewer than 
50,000 inhabitants (CDC, 2011). The SMART data set con­
tained data from 21 states (63 counties) that had admin­
istered the PHQ­8.
Participants: Total sample 
The study cohort began with 34,876 survey respondents. 
Age was missing for 329 respondents, and the interview 
year was coded as 2007 instead of 2006 for 253 respon­
dents. These 582 participants were excluded from analy­
sis, leaving a final sample of 34,294 adult respondents, or 
98.3% of the original study cohort. Participants ranged in 
age from 18 to 99 years with a mean age of 52 years 
(SD = 16.7). Table 1 summarizes basic demographic 
information about the respondents.
Participants: Depressed sample
If major depression with seasonal variation is a rare dis­
order, then evaluating seasonal change in depression 
scores of the total sample may have the effect of conceal­
ing this pattern. To account for this possibility, we reran 
all of our analyses on the subsample of respondents who 
scored within the depressed range on the PHQ­8 depres­
sion scale (PHQ­8 ≥ 55; see next section). This depressed 
sample consisted of 1,754 participants between 18 and 93 
years of age with a mean age of 48.2 years (SD = 14.3). 
Table 1 also summarizes demographic information about 
this depressed sample.
PHQ-8 Depression Scale
The PHQ­8 is an adaptation of the Patient Health 
Questionnaire–9 (PHQ­9; Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002). The 
PHQ­9 consists of 9 items that reflect the symptoms of 
major depressive episode as specified in DSM-5 (Dhingra, 
Kroenke, Zack, Strine, & Balluz, 2011). The PHQ­8 com­
prises eight questions that ask how many days during the 
past two weeks the participant experienced a given 
symptom of depression. The PHQ­9 contains an item 
about suicidal ideation that is omitted from the PHQ­8. 
The item is eliminated because interviewers collecting 
data for large­scale telephone surveys lack the resources 
to conduct a clinical assessment or arrange a proper 
intervention for respondents who express thoughts of 
suicide or self­harm. The PHQ­9 is a valid and reliable 
measure of depression consistent with DSM diagnostic 
criteria, and the PHQ­8 has similar operating characteris­
tics (Kroenke et al., 2009; Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002).
PHQ­8 scores were determined by summing across 
the 8 item scores. Thus PHQ­8 scores ranged from 0 to 
112 total symptom days. This method of scoring the

PHQ­8, known as PHQ­8 Days, and using a cut score of 
55 symptom days, has a sensitivity of .91 and specificity 
of .99 when compared with scores produced by a DSM-
based PHQ­8 scoring algorithm (Dhingra et al., 2011).
Season
Season was constructed as a continuous variable follow­
ing Kerr et al. (2013). The 2006 winter solstice was 
December 21, and this date was designated as 0, with 
successive days serially numbered 1 to 364. To approxi­
mate a sinusoidal function, we constructed a polynomial 
regression model for the continuous season variable that 
also included the square and cube of this variable to 
model quadratic and cubic effects.
Latitude
Respondents were classified as living in northern, mid­
dle, or southern latitudes based on residence at the time 
of the survey. Respondents in the northernmost latitude, 
between 42.3°N and 45.2°N latitudes, lived in Maine, 
Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Vermont, 
Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The middle latitude communi­
ties, between 32.4°N and 36.1°N latitudes, were in 
Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Mississippi, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, and parts of Texas. The communities in the 
southernmost latitudes, between 27.6°N and 30.4°N lati­
tudes, were located in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.

for most U.S. cities and towns (U.S. Naval Observatory 
[USNO] Astronomical Applications Department, 2014). 
The sunlight data for each 2006 date were obtained for 
every community and county in the BRFSS SMART 
county­level data set. The range of sunlight on any date 
within each latitude band was as follows: Northern lati­
tude ranged from 8 hours 43 minutes to 15 hours 37 
minutes, middle latitude ranged from 9 hours 42 minutes 
to 14 hours 37 minutes, and southern latitude ranged 
from 10 hours 11 minutes to 14 hours 7 minutes.
Using the interview date, state, and county data 
included in the BRFSS data, the latitude variable, and the 
USNO data on sunlight, a four­category sunlight expo­
sure variable was created. Respondents were classified 
into one of four groups based on amount of daylight on 
the day of interview: (a) 8 to 9 hours 59 minutes, (b) 10 
to 11 hours 59 minutes, (c) 12 to 13 hours 59 minutes, 
and (d) 14 hours or more of sunlight. The numbers of 
respondents within each latitude band, sunlight exposure 
category, and season (as categories based on 2006 dates 
of solstices and equinoxes; USNO, n.d.) of interview are 
summarized in Table 1.
Design
The study design is cross­sectional and we conducted dif­
ferent analyses in an effort to discover a relationship 
between sunlight exposure and depression. The first analy­
sis evaluated the relationship of season modeled as a con­
tinuous variable and depression. If depression prevalence is 
related to season, then a polynomial regression model 
should yield significant cubic effect for the season variable.
The second analysis sought to determine if latitude or 
season, either independently or in interaction, could 
explain significant variation in depression scores. 
Interaction effects of latitude and season consistent with 
SAD theory would manifest as higher depression scores 
among people living at northern latitudes during the 
winter season, and lower depression scores among peo­
ple in southern latitudes during summer.
Latitude and season are proxy variables for sunlight 
exposure duration, which is the hypothesized causal 
variable responsible for seasonal variation in depression. 
Because of the relationship among these variables, it is 
not reasonable to include the sunlight duration variable 
in the same model with the latitude and season variables. 
There is an additional practical reason for excluding sun­
light duration from the model that contains the latitude 
and season variables. Within the southernmost latitude 
band, there are no days with sunlight duration of less 
than 10 hours per day. Thus, placing this variable in inter­
action with latitude band produces an empty cell. The 
categorical sunlight exposure variable was evaluated sep­
arately in an analysis that excludes the latitude and sea­
son variables.
The separate multiple regression models were con­
structed as described earlier with PHQ­8 depression score as 
the criterion variable. Each model included a set of control 
covariates typically associated with depression. Control 
covariates were age (in years) and age squared, race/ethnic­
ity (six categories), sex (male, female), educational level 
(seven categories), marital status (seven categories), and 
employment status (seven categories). Variables were 
entered simultaneously in these regression analyses. All anal­
yses were conducted for the total and depressed samples.
Statistical 
analysis 
employed 
the 
SAS 
PROC 
SURVEYREG module (SAS Institute, 2008), which accom­
modates data from surveys administered using complex 
sampling strategies. The analyses were weighted using 
the BRFSS variable designed for use with the SMART data 
set (_cntywt). Weighting the analysis adjusts standard 
errors for sampling strategy effects of nonresponse and 
number of household telephones. Survey design effects 
including first sampling stage stratification (state, phone 
density, geographic region) and clustering of phone 
numbers were also specified in the analyses.
Results
Season
Models were constructed with PHQ­8 scores as the crite­
rion variable and including the season variable along with 
the quadratic and cubic terms to determine if a sinusoidal 
function fit the data as predicted by SAD theory. An 
absence of effect with a model that included the quadratic 
term but not the cubic term meant that the cubic term 
would also not be significant. Nevertheless, we present the 
results of the third order polynomial model for both the 
total and depressed samples. Results indicated that the 
season variables were not significantly related to depres­
sion scores in either sample. The absence of a curvilinear 
function means that a linear model is suitable for describ­
ing the relationship of depression and season. Table 2 
summarizes the results of regression models for season 
plus all control covariates for the total and depressed sam­
ples. Several control covariates were significantly related to 
depression scores in both samples, with only the model 
control covariates accounting for a significant proportion 
of variance in depression scores, F(29, 34,150) = 25.76, p < 
.0001, R2 = .1406, for the total sample, F(28, 1,650) = 16.77, 
p < .0001, R2 = .1316, for the depressed sample. For each 
variable in both the total and depressed samples, semipar­
tial r2 are presented as estimates of the unique effects asso­
ciated with season and each control covariate.
Latitude band and season
The next set of analyses evaluated the relationship of lati­
tude of residence and season to determine if these

commonly used proxy variables for sunlight exposure 
were related to current depression while controlling for 
the covariates. Table 3 summarizes these statistically sig­
nificant regression models for the total sample, F(31, 
34,150) = 25.76, p < .0001, R2 = .1407, and the depressed 
sample, F(30, 1,650) = 16.77, p < .0001, R2 = .1320. Only 
the model control covariates contributed to the statistical 
significance of the models. There were no significant 
main effects for season or latitude, nor was there a sig­
nificant interaction of these variables for either the total 
or depressed samples. Semipartial r2 values are reported 
in Table 3 to indicate unique effects attributable to each 
variable in the model.
Sunlight exposure
Finally, models were constructed to determine if sunlight 
exposure was related to depression for either the total or 
depressed samples. Table 4 presents the results of the 
analyses for the total and depressed samples. For both 
samples, the models accounted for a significant propor­
tion of the variance in depression scores, F(29, 34,150) = 
27.12, p < .0001, R2 = .1408 for the total sample, F(28, 
1,650) = 18.04, p < .0001, R2 = .1242, for the depressed 
sample. However, a significant effect for sunlight expo­
sure duration on depression scores was not found in 
either sample.
Discussion
Major depression with seasonal variation was included in 
the DSM–III-R (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) 
largely based on research on SAD. However, the SAD 
construct and typical method of measuring it (i.e., the 
SPAQ) have little in common with the DSM construct of 
major depression. SAD theory holds that some affective 
disturbances are triggered by lack of sunlight, and many 
studies of SAD have investigated mood changes associ­
ated with proxies for this variable, such as seasonal 
changes or residence at various distances from the 
equator.
The purpose of this study was to determine if major 
depression was associated with these proxies for sunlight 
exposure, as well as sunlight exposure itself. There was 
no indication that depression is associated with seasonal 
changes in either the total sample or the sample of indi­
viduals with elevated depression scores. Had the data 
been characterized by seasonal fluctuations in depres­
sion, the polynomial regression model would have fit the 
data better than the linear model, but this is not the case. 
The prevalence of depression as measured by the PHQ­8 
is quite stable across the seasons.
Likewise, we found no association of depression with 
latitude of residence. The hypothesis that affect is related 
to latitude has received inconsistent support in the litera­
ture. Rosen et al. (1990) reported that prevalence of 
SPAQ­identified SAD cases declined across northerly to 
southerly U.S. latitudes. However, a number of studies 
have failed to replicate this finding using both the SPAQ 
and DSM­based criteria for depression (Blazer et al., 
1998; Brancaleoni, Nikitenko, Grassi, & Hansen, 2009; 
Haggarty, Cernovsky, & Husni, 2001; Levitt & Boyle, 2002; 
Mersch, Middendorp, Bouhuys, Beersma, & Van den 
Hoofdakker, 1999).

Finally, there is no indication that depression is related to 
sunlight exposure on the day of the interview. This finding 
is not surprising. If the proxy variables for sunlight are unre­
lated to depression, then unless these are very poor proxy 
variables, we would not expect sunlight exposure and 
depression to be related, either. Sunlight duration on the 
day of the interview is a reasonable estimation of the poten­
tial sunlight exposure around the time of the interview. 
Inspection of the sunlight tables from the USNO indicates 
that sunlight duration typically only varies 0 to 2 minutes 
from day to day. There have been other reports that support 
this finding and cast doubt on sunlight exposure as a causal 
factor in depression. Hansen et al. (2008) reported no 
increase in depression in northern Norway during the two­
month­long “dark period” (p. 121). A large­scale study of 
residents of Tromsø, Norway, a city north of the arctic circle 
and also subject to the two­month polar night, found nei­
ther an increase in self­reported mental distress during the 
polar night nor a decrease in reported mental distress dur­
ing the polar day (Johnsen, Wynn, & Bratlid, 2012).

Traffanstedt et al.
The idea that depression occurs along with seasonal 
changes or worsens in winter appears to be a well­
entrenched folk theory. A Google search for news items 
of the term “winter depression” yielded 993,000 hits. 
Similar search terms yielded the indicated number of 
news item hits: “winter blues” (7,460,000), “seasonal 
affective disorder” (19,800), and “seasonal depression” 
(34,300). SAD research participants, who are frequently 
identified using the SPAQ, may reconstruct past experi­
ences in accordance with this folk theory. Early SAD 
research (e.g., Rosenthal et al., 1984) in particular has 
been criticized for recruiting participants by advertise­
ment (Bauer & Dunner, 1993; Hansen et al., 2008), a 
technique predisposed to self­selection bias. Researchers 
employing this recruitment technique may begin the 
project expecting to discover a particular pattern of 
behavior and absent experimental safeguards those 
expectancies would be subject to confirmation bias.
Whether by accident or design, this combination of 
methodological shortcomings is nearly ideal for confirm­
ing a folk theory. However, establishing psychiatric diag­
noses is a consequential activity and evidence from 
studies that allow the possibility of disconfirmation 
should be given substantial weight (Meehl, 1978; Popper, 
1962). The particular strengths of the present study are 
the measurement of depression in a manner consistent 
with DSM criteria and the absence of expectation of any 
relationship between current depression and seasonality 
among respondents or interviewers. The sample is repre­
sentative of the U.S. population, and large enough to 
bring sufficient statistical power to the design, which also 
controlled for the effects of variables that are associated 
with depression.
The results of this study add to the findings of other 
studies that have used measures consistent with DSM 
major depression criteria (Kerr et al., 2013; Magnusson 
et al., 2000; Nayyar & Cochrane, 1996; Posternack & 
Zimmerman, 2002). The findings cast serious doubt on 
major depression with seasonal variation as a legitimate 
psychiatric disorder. In clinical cases of recurrent depres­
sion, stressful life events associated with episodes may 
coincidentally co­occur with seasonal changes for some 
people. Identifying sunlight exposure as the putative 
cause of depression would necessitate separating its 
effects from the effects of co­occurring stressors.
The current study cannot rule out the possibility that 
major depression with seasonal variation exists, but at a 
low base rate. For example, Blazer et al. (1998) in an 
analysis of National Comorbidity Study data found that 
1.6% of the major depression cases (representing 0.3% of 
the general population), reported seasonally related 
recurrent depression episodes. One problem with large­
scale epidemiological studies such as reported here is 
that it is difficult to detect conditions with low base rates. 
Low base rates pose difficulties for case identification 
even with instruments that have excellent sensitivity and 
specificity (Glaros & Kline, 1988).
The findings of Blazer et al. (1998), however, do not 
validate the presence of such a taxon. Although they 
used an instrument consistent with DSM criteria for major 
depression, Blazer et al. (1998) also relied on questioning 
participants about past episodes of depression. Their 
method was more stringent than found in studies using 
the SPAQ, but nevertheless, it is subject to the problem of 
recall bias identified earlier.
Depression is a recurrent illness (Burcusa & Iacono, 
2007). Because all episodes of depression occur in some 
season, chance occurrence in two consecutive winters 
would explain some apparent seasonality. The role of 
chance as an explanation diminishes in cases where epi­
sodes are experienced in three or more consecutive win­
ters. Even so, the existence of such cases would not in 
themselves demonstrate that changes in sunlight expo­
sure are responsible for the depression. Merely being 
depressed during winter is not evidence that one is 
depressed because of winter.
If major depressive disorder with seasonal variation is 
a folk psychological construct with limited empirical sup­
port, the implications of including it in the DSM are that 
the expected course of legitimate cases of depression 
may be misconstrued and improperly treated. Societal 
consequences also inevitably accrue; for example, 
employees with SAD have won lawsuits against employ­
ers who failed to accommodate the disorder (Ekstrand v. 
School District of Somerset, 2012; Twohey, 2010). The 
weight of accumulating evidence, including the evidence 
presented here, indicates that the burden of proof for 
including the seasonal variation modifier for major 
depression in DSM has shifted to those who would con­
tinue to do so.
