The Quality of Outpatient Care Delivered to Adults
in the United States, 2002 to 2013
David M. Levine, MD, MA; Jeffrey A. Linder, MD, MPH; Bruce E. Landon, MD, MBA, MSc
IMPORTANCE Widespread deficits in the quality of US health care were described over a
decade ago. Since then, local, regional, and national efforts have sought to improve quality
and patient experience, but there is incomplete information about whether such efforts have
been successful.
OBJECTIVE To measure changes in outpatient quality and patient experience in the United
States from 2002 to 2013.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We analyzed temporal trends from 2002 to 2013 using
quality measures constructed from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a
nationally representative annual survey of the US population that collects data from
individual respondents as well as respondents’clinicians, hospitals, pharmacies, and
employers. Participants were noninstitutionalized US adults 18 years or older (range,
20 679-26 509 individuals each year).
MEASURES Outpatient quality measures were compiled through a structured review of prior
studies and measures endorsed by national organizations. Nine clinical quality composites
(5 “underuse”composites, eg, recommended medical treatment; 4 “
overuse”composites, eg,
avoidance of inappropriate imaging) based on 39 quality measures; an overall patient
experience rating; and 2 patient experience composites (physician communication and
access) based on 6 measures.
RESULTS From 2002 to 2013 (MEPS sample size, 20 679-26 509), 4 clinical quality
composites improved: recommended medical treatment (from 36% to 42%; P < .01),
recommended counseling (from 43% to 50%; P < .01), recommended cancer screening (from
73% to 75%; P < .01), and avoidance of inappropriate cancer screening (from 47% to 51%;
P = .02). Two clinical quality composites worsened: avoidance of inappropriate medical
treatments (from 92% to 89%) and avoidance of inappropriate antibiotic use (from 50% to
44%; P < .01 for both comparisons). Three clinical quality measures were unchanged:
recommended diagnostic and preventive testing (76%), recommended diabetes care (68%),
and inappropriate imaging avoidance (90%). The proportion of participants highly rating
their care experience improved for overall care (from 72% to 77%), physician communication
(from 55% to 63%), and access to care (from 48% to 58%; P < .01 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite more than a decade of efforts, the clinical quality of
outpatient care delivered to American adults has not consistently improved. Patient
experience has improved. Deficits in care continue to pose serious hazards to the health of
the American public.

O
ver a decade ago, McGlynn and colleagues1 reported
that adults in the United States received just over half
of recommended health care services. Since then,
there have been local, regional, and national efforts to im-
prove the quality of health care, including expanded quality
measurement and public reporting programs2,3; increased
adoptionofpay-for-performance4;increasedadoptionofvalue-
based purchasing by private and public payers; broad encour-
agement of electronic health record use5; improved coverage
for recommended services6; and expansion of patient-
centered medical homes.7 In recent years, these efforts have
beencomplementedbyanincreasingfocusonoverusethrough
programs such as the American Board of Internal Medicine
Foundation’
s Choosing Wisely initiative8 and increasing
attention to patient-reported outcomes.9-11
Despite these efforts, there are few national data to gauge
whether the quality of care in the United States is improving.
Studies to date have been limited by reliance on a small num-
ber of quality measures,12,13 attention to specific diseases,14-17
modest measurement of overuse,18 or reduced generalizabil-
itybyfocusingonMedicare19-22oronlythosewithausualsource
of care.1,23 Most have yielded only year-long snapshots of qual-
ity, precluding a broad appraisal of change.24 Some harbor cau-
tiousoptimismthatcareisimproving,whileothersexpressfrus-
tration at the perceived slow pace of improvement.25,26
To determine whether efforts to improve outpatient qual-
ity have been successful, we measured 46 indicators of the
quality of outpatient care delivered to adults in the United
States over the past decade in the areas of recommended care,
inappropriate care, and patient experience. Evaluation of care
quality performance may enable policymakers, clinicians, and
health system leaders to target key areas for attention and
improvement.
Methods
The Harvard Medical School institutional review board deter-
mined this study to not be human subject research and there-
fore exempt from approval.
Data Source and Study Population
We analyzed data from the 2002 to 2013 Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative annual sur-
veyofrepeatedcrosssectionsofthenoninstitutionalizedUnited
States civilian population.27 The MEPS sample is drawn from
respondents to the annual National Health Interview Survey.
The MEPS uses a complex survey design that delivers English
orSpanishcomputer-assistedpersonalinterviewstocollectde-
tailed data on demographic characteristics, health conditions,
health status, medical services utilization, medications, cost,
source of payments, health insurance coverage, income, em-
ployment, experience with care, and access to care. Overall
annual response rates ranged from 50% to 65% (mean, 59%).
The MEPS then supplements self-reported information by
contacting respondents’clinicians (mean response rate, 86%),
hospitals (91%), pharmacies (75%), and employers (86%). Of
those contacted, the MEPS records any and all encounters with
these entities. Clinicians specify details regarding office vis-
its (eg, diagnostic tests, cost); hospitals specify admissions (eg,
cost); pharmacies specify individual medications dispensed
(eg, dose, formulation, cost); and employers specify details
about insurance coverage. For each encounter, the clinician,
hospital, or pharmacy has the option to complete a computer-
assisted telephone interview (CATI) or can send medical and
billing records that are abstracted via the same CATI proce-
dure. For example, if a patient reported visiting a physician for
back pain and receiving an opioid prescription, the physician
would corroborate that a medication was prescribed, and the
pharmacy would corroborate the formulation, dose, and fre-
quency of the opioid prescription. In cases of discrepancy be-
tween respondents’self-report and other sources, the MEPS
use the other sources, although the MEPS does not reveal how
frequently this occurs.
The MEPS includes 2 additional mail-back surveys: the
adult self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) and the diabe-
tes care survey (DCS). The SAQ, administered to all adult re-
spondents, includes items from the Consumer Assessment of
Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey, the 12-
item Short Form (SF-12), and additional items measuring re-
spondents’attitudes about health care (annual response rate
range, 91%-94%). The DCS, administered only to respon-
dentswithself-reporteddiabetes,includesitemsrelatedtocare
for diabetes (annual response rate range, 88%-97%).
We restricted our analyses to the adult population ages 18
years or older. Sample sizes ranged from 20 679 to 26 509
respondents per year.
Clinical Quality Measures
We reviewed all Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Informa-
tion Set (HEDIS) measures23; all ambulatory process mea-
sures endorsed by the National Quality Forum (representing
measures from numerous advisory/governing bodies)28; all
ambulatory measures from McGlynn and colleagues1 (based
on more than expert opinion and not related to cancer treat-
ment or pregnancy); all ambulatory process measures in the
National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report29; all rec-
ommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF)30; and all measures from work on overuse by
Schwartz et al, 20,31 Colla et al,32 and Choosing Wisely33
(eAppendix in the Supplement).
Key Points
Question How has the quality of outpatient care delivered to
adults in the United States changed from 2002 to 2013?
Findings Analyses of a nationally representative cross-sectional
survey show that the quality of outpatient care inconsistently
improved. From 2002 to 2013, 4 clinical quality composites
improved, 2 worsened, and 3 were unchanged. Patient experience
improved. Most composites continued to demonstrate
disappointingly low absolute rates, even when improvement
occurred.
Meaning Deficits in care continue to pose serious hazards to the
health of the American public.

We excluded duplicate measures and measures that
could not be accurately and reliably constructed and
assessed using the MEPS. We also excluded a small number
of measures that were controversial (n = 5), such as prostate
cancer screening (USPSTF grade I [“insufficient evidence”]
for most of our study period)34,35 or that had major changes
over time (n = 22), such as statin use for patients with diabe-
tes (which became an official recommendation in 2013)36 or
avoiding β-blocker use for patients with concomitant airway
disease.37 For measures with only minor changes over time
(n = 4), we used consistent measure definitions to ensure
valid comparison. For example, recommendations for influ-
enza vaccination changed between 2002 and 2013.38,39
However, the recommendation to vaccinate persons 50
years or older has remained consistent; thus, our measure
examines vaccination only among persons 50 years or older.
Similarly, to reconcile most breast cancer screening recom-
mendations, we applied less stringent criteria over the time
period: screening once every 2 years for women 50 to 74
years old. Thus, our measures are broadly applicable to care
delivered over time and currently.
After applying the exclusion criteria, we evaluated per-
formance over time on 39 clinical quality measures, includ-
ing 25 underuse measures and 14 overuse measures (Table 1;
eAppendix in the Supplement).
From these measures, we constructed 5 clinically mean-
ingful underuse composites (eg, recommended cancer screen-
ing), where delivery of the service is likely of benefit to the pa-
tient, and 4 overuse composites (eg, avoidance of imaging in
specificclinicalsituations),wheredeliveryoftheserviceiscon-
sidered either inappropriate or of little to no benefit (Table 1).
To calculate performance for each measure, we first identi-
fied those respondents who were eligible for the measure (eg,
those with diabetes) and then whether or not they received the
particular care (eg, eye examination). To calculate compos-
ites, we divided all instances in which recommended care was
delivered(forunderusemeasures)oravoided(foroverusemea-
sures)bythenumberoftimesparticipantswereeligibleforcare
in the category, as others have done.1 Theoretically, compos-
ites could range from 0 to 100%.
Patient Experience Measures
We evaluated MEPS measures of patient experience drawn
from the CAHPS questionnaire that referred to a patient’
s over-
all health care experience in the past year (Table 1). A global
rating measure asked about patient experience with all health
providers (0, “worst health care possible,” to 10, “best health
carepossible”).Thephysiciancommunicationcompositeasked
4 items (eg, “How often did the physician spend enough time
with you?”), and the access to care composite included 2 items
(eg, “How often did you get a medical appointment as soon as
wanted?”). Responses for each item were coded from “never”
(1) to “always” (4). To better discriminate changes over time,
we assessed high ratings in overall care, physician communi-
cation, and access to care, similar to HEDIS analyses.23 We di-
chotomized all measures such that a positive response in-
cluded 8, 9, or 10 for the items scored from 0 to 10 and 4 for
the items scored from 1 to 4 (Table 1). As a sensitivity analy-
sis, we also rescaled 1 to 4 measures to a 0 to 10 scale, as oth-
ers have done (eFigure in the Supplement).68 We calculated
each composite by first computing the mean for each respon-
dent and then taking the mean for all respondents.
Statistical Analysis
In all analyses we accounted for the complex design of the
MEPS, applying survey estimation weights, primary sam-
pling unit clusters, and sampling strata to allow for national
estimates adjusted for nonresponse, as recommended by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.69,70 We present
weighted percentages. To examine whether performance was
improved at the end of the study period compared with the
beginning, we compared composites in 2002 and 2013 with
χ2 tests adjusting for the complex survey design.71 We per-
formed all analyses with SAS statistical software (version 9.4).
We considered 2-sided P < .05 to be significant.
Results
From 2002 to 2013, the US adult population aged (mean age
increasedfrom45to47years;P < .01),becamelesswhite(from
71% to 65%; P < .01), more Hispanic (from 12% to 15%; P < .01),
morelikelytohavegraduatedcollege(from15%to18%;P < .01),
and less likely to smoke cigarettes (from 21% to 16%; P < .01)
(Table 2; eTable 1 in the Supplement). There were decreases
in private insurance coverage (from 74% to 66%; P < .01), hav-
ing a usual source of care (from 77% to 74%; P < .01), and em-
ployment (from 72% to 69%; P < .01). Rates of chronic dis-
eases increased. In 2002, 8% of Americans had 3 or more
chronic diseases compared with 18% in 2013 (P < .01). No
changesoccurredinperceivedhealthstatus(27%reportedtheir
overall health as excellent) or activities of daily living.
Provision of Recommended Care
Rates of recommended medical treatment delivery
improved from 36% in 2002 to 42% in 2013 (P < .01)
(Table 3; Figure, A). The most pronounced improvements in
this composite were improvements in the use of β-blockers
for heart failure (41% to 65%; P < .01) and statins for stroke
(34% to 57%; P < .01). Declines occurred in the use of an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin
receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB) in patients with concomitant
diabetes and hypertension (from 64% to 58%; P < .01) and
controller medications among patients with poorly con-
trolled asthma (from 71% to 59%; P < .01). Rates of recom-
mended counseling delivery improved from 43% in 2002 to
50% in 2013 (P < .01), driven most by smoking cessation
counseling (from 49% to 61%; P < .01). Recommended can-
cer screening improved minimally (from 73% to 75%;
P < .01), with marked improvement in colorectal cancer
screening (from 48% to 63%; P < .01), offset by decreasing
rates of breast cancer screening (from 81% to 77%; P < .01)
and cervical cancer screening (from 90% to 86%; P < .01).
Other underuse composites (diagnostic and preventive
testing [76%; P = .05] and diabetes care [68%; P = .21]) were
unchanged (Table 3; Figure, A).

bWhere possible, these references refer to a detailed discussion of the clinical
area that supports each measure. The National Quality Forum and other
organizations have adopted these discussions to a measure definition with
numerators and denominators (eAppendix in the Supplement for further

consistent measure definitions to ensure valid comparison (see Methods for
details).
c See eAppendix in the Supplement for details and sensitivity analyses
regarding identification of visit types.
dFrom 2009 to 2013, we were able to extract the numerator as given. From
2002 to 2008, we were not able to distinguish between colonoscopy and
sigmoidoscopy, nor between a 5-year or 10-year screening interval, nor
between screening vs diagnostic procedure. The change in phrasing of these
questions likely follows the change in recommendations.67
e Most measures recommend a 6-week delay, but the MEPS only consistently
separates visits by month.
f “Top-coded”indicates that a response was dichotomized as follows: response
of 4 on a Likert scale of 1-4 or responses of 8, 9, or 10 on a Likert scale of 1-10
were counted as positive. For comparison, we present linear measures
rescaled 0 to 10 in eFigure in the Supplement.

Respondents’rating of physician communication improved
from 8.1 out of 10 in 2002 to 8.5 out of 10 in 2013 (P < .01). Re-
spondents increasingly noted their physician “always” spent
enough time with them (46% to 55%; P < .01). The percent-
age who “always” had access to care (a 4 out of 4) increased
from 48% in 2002 to 58% in 2013 (P < .01). On a scale of 0 to
10, access to care improved from 7.6 in 2002 to 8.0 in 2013
(P < .01).
Discussion
Despite local, regional, and national efforts to improve care,
we found inconsistent improvements in the quality of outpa-
tient care delivered to adults over the past decade in this large,
nationally representative study. Although there were areas of
improvement, including provision of recommended medical
treatments, recommended counseling, and avoidance of in-
appropriate cancer screening, there were also areas of de-
cline, including avoidance of inappropriate antibiotic prescrib-
ingandavoidanceofinappropriatemedicaltreatments.Several
composites continued to demonstrate disappointingly low ab-
solute rates and small absolute changes, even when improve-
ment occurred, such as for recommended medical treatment
and inappropriate cancer screening. Patient experience with
care showed consistent, significant improvements. All of
this occurred in the context of an American population that
became, on average, 1.6 years older, slightly poorer, and
accrued more health conditions, although with unchanged
self-rated general health status.
Continued deficits in recommended care have important
implications for the health of Americans. About 1 in 4 eligible
Americans failed to receive recommended cancer screening,

diagnostic and preventive testing, or diabetes care. About 60%
of eligible Americans did not receive beneficial cardiovascu-
larandpulmonarytherapies.Forexample,inheartfailure,only
57% and 65% of eligible Americans took recommended ACEi/
ARB and β-blocker medications, despite a 16% and 4% abso-
lutereductioninmortality,respectively.73,74Similarly,inpoorly
controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, only 35%
of eligible Americans took a recommended controller medi-
cation in 2013, a treatment that reduces exacerbations by 25%
and hospitalizations by 17%.75
Waste and possible harm from overuse of care are also sub-
stantial. About half of older Americans received cancer screen-
ing when it was unlikely to prolong life. About half of Ameri-
cans who made a visit for viral illnesses received inappropriate
antibiotics, which exposes patients to adverse drug events, in-
creases costs, and increases the prevalence of antibiotic resis-
tant bacteria.76 Almost 1 in 6 Americans who made a visit for
back pain received an inappropriate lumbar radiograph—the
largest radiation dose of any plain film examination (equiva-
lent to 70 chest radiographs).77 Importantly, many of these
trends worsened. When considered in the context of increas-
ing health care spending (approximately 15% of gross domes-
tic product [$5700 per person] in 2002 vs approximately 17%
[$9100 per person] in 2013),78 these areas represent prime tar-
gets for efforts to improve the value of care delivered by elimi-
natingservicesthathaveaneutralornegativeimpactonhealth.
Although early research suggests that initiatives such as Medi-
care’
s accountable care organization (ACO) programs may be
impacting overuse of low-value services, we see little evi-
dence of widespread improvements during our study.20
Substantial and consistent improvements were seen in pa-
tient experience. From 2002 to 2013, 5% more Americans re-
ported excellent global experience with care and 8% more
thought highly of their physician’
s communication, rela-
tively large effects.68 When first introduced, there was con-
siderable controversy over whether experience measures were
valid measures of health care quality,10,79 yet over our study
period, measurement and reporting of patient experience has
become standard. In addition to being publicly reported be-
ginning in 2007, patient experience is becoming increasingly
important for reimbursement. For instance, patient experi-
ence measures are components of quality measured and re-
warded in Medicare’
s managed care programs.68,80 Our data
likely demonstrate that health care systems have responded
to these and other incentives and invested to improve patient
experience. Whether other areas of care could be influenced
with a similar system of reporting remains to be seen.
Similarly, Americans who reported always having access
to care improved by 10%. Access improved despite increased
proportions of adults who were uninsured or used public in-
surance, key factors associated with worse access to primary
care.81 However, we specifically did not examine primary care
access measures, but instead examined access to any medi-
cal care. Therefore, use of emergency departments, retail clin-
ics,andothernontraditionalmedicalestablishmentsmayhave
improved Americans’perception regarding access.82
For quality of care, several possibilities exist for the in-
consistent gains and disappointing absolute rates observed.
First, despite recent efforts to transition to alternative pay-
ment models such as value-based purchasing, fee-for-
serviceremainsdominantintheUS.83Althoughdataaremixed,
fee-for-service incentives may run counter to efforts to im-
prove the global delivery of recommended care and to avoid
inappropriate care, as payments are not linked to appropri-
ateness or quality.84 Moreover, most standalone pay-for-
performance programs used to mitigate fee-for-service incen-
tives have had little to no impact on quality. In contrast,
integrated care networks that operate on a global budget and
take a population health approach to achieving quality,85,86
programs that include integrated pay-for-quality,87-89 and in-
stitutionsthatengageinsubstantivequalityimprovement,90,91
have shown improvements in the quality of outpatient care.
Second, most quality measures, including many of those
we examined, are focused on the provision of primary care,

but the United States underinvests in primary care.92 Com-
prehensive primary care is associated with lower costs,
improved health outcomes, greater efficiency, and reduced
disparities.93 Primary care spending in the United States ac-
counts for only 6% to 8% of total medical expenditures, a
number likely unchanged for over a decade.94 Current efforts
to improve the delivery of primary care through the patient-
centered medical home have yielded inconsistent effects
on quality, though these efforts may evolve and strengthen
over time.95
Third,broadpolicychangesandreformeffortsmaybenec-
essarybutnotsufficienttoimprovequality.Manyinputsaffect,
for example, whether an individual obtains colorectal cancer
screening. Perhaps social determinants of health create bar-
riers, or perhaps personal health beliefs impact the decision.
The complexity and interconnectedness of health care mean
that a single policy or national improvement initiative may be
insufficient to bolster quality.
Fourth, changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) are not reflected in our data, as key insurance provi-
sions began in October 2013.96 The ACA may be crucial to the
requisite multipronged effort to align payers, clinicians, and
patients. It has encouraged organizational changes through
ACOs and renewed investment in primary care through pro-
grams such as the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative and
National Health Service Corps. The ACA has also accelerated
efforts to move away from fee-for-service toward pay-for-
value and bundled payment programs. Perhaps most impor-
tantly, 30 million more Americans now have health insur-
ance. Whether these efforts will lead to measurable
improvements in national quality remains to be seen.
Limitations
Our study has limitations. First, we could not always measure
all potential relevant exclusions when calculating quality mea-
sures (eg, bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer screening).
However, others have shown only small differences when ac-
counting for multiple exclusions with billing data.31 The MEPS
does not rely on administrative data but instead on a rich com-
bination of self-report and clinical data, and our estimates are
oftencomparablewithothers(eTable2intheSupplement).We
consciously chose not to adjust for population characteristic
changes in an effort to demonstrate actual care delivery. Most
important, our measures are internally consistent over time so
changes in rates are likely to reflect true changes.
Second, our quality measures do not address all outpa-
tient care. However, to our knowledge, the MEPS represents
one of the largest nationally representative sets of consis-
tently collected quality measures available for more than a de-
cade. The study by McGlynn and colleagues1 from over a de-
cade ago was seminal work covering 18 outpatient categories
(excluding cancer treatment and pregnancy) with 81 mea-
sures (excluding those based only on expert opinion). How-
ever, it was a single point in time, included only people seek-
ing medical care in 12 metropolitan areas, had a response rate
of 34%, and had denominators with fewer than 30 individu-
als for half of the 81 measures (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Our present analysis builds on the work of McGlynn and

colleagues1 with a nationally representative population-
based sample; 15 outpatient categories encompassing 46 mea-
sures; additional measures of medication safety, overuse, and
patient experience; 50% to 65% response rates; and higher
sample sizes (most measures with denominators >1000;
just 1 measure with denominator <30). Like McGlynn et al,1 we
focused on process and structure measures to identify por-
tions of the health care system in need of improvement. These
measures are most often under the control of clinicians and
the health care system.97 Because of our structured search and
exclusion criteria, our measures capture clinically important
care that has been the focus of improvement efforts and have
remained relevant for over a decade.
Third, although our composites capture change in the ag-
gregate, they are not meant to enable comparison between, for
example, diabetes care and cardiovascular care, because some
individual measures might be easier to achieve than others.
Similarly, the complexity of health care limits our ability to de-
termine exact reasons for such inconsistent improvements
in quality.
Fourth, whereas most measures were corroborated by a
second or third source, 16 clinical measures relied only on self-
report (Table 1). Although self-report has been shown to have
reasonable concordance with electronic medical records and
administrative sources, this can vary by item.98,99 Any bias
would be internally consistent over time.
Conclusions
Despite more than a decade of efforts to improve the quality
of health care in the United States, the quality of outpatient
care delivered to adults has not consistently improved. There
have been improvements in patient experience. Current defi-
cits in care continue to pose serious hazards to the health of
the American public in the form of missed care opportunities
as well as waste and potential harm from overuse. Ongoing na-
tional efforts to measure and improve the quality of outpa-
tient care should continue, with a renewed focus on identify-
ing and disseminating successful improvement strategies.
