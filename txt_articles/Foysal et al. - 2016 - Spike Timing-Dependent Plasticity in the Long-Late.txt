The long-latency stretch reflex (LLSR) in human elbow muscles probably depends on multiple pathways; one possible contributor is the
reticulospinal tract. Here we attempted to induce plastic changes in the LLSR by pairing noninvasive stimuli that are known to activate
reticulospinal pathways, at timings predicted to cause spike timing-dependent plasticity in the brainstem. In healthy human subjects,

(C-25ms-Bi); click alone (C only); and biceps alone (Bi only). The average stimulus rate was 0.67 Hz. Subjects left the laboratory wearing

Introduction
The reticulospinal tract is a major descending motor pathway,
which is typically considered to convey commands for gross mo-
tor functions, such as maintaining posture, locomotion, and
reaching movements (Matsuyama and Drew, 2000; Prentice and
Drew, 2001; Buford and Davidson, 2004; Davidson and Buford,
2006; Dyson et al., 2014). Recent work in primates has shown that
the reticulospinal tract may also contribute to hand function, in
parallel with the more prominent corticospinal tract (Riddle et
al., 2009; Riddle and Baker, 2010; Baker, 2011; Soteropoulos et al.,
2012). Following corticospinal damage, connections from the
reticulospinal tract to motoneurons controlling the upper limb
strengthen selectively to flexors (Zaaimi et al., 2012). This prob-
ably underlies the selective recovery of function seen after stroke
or spinal cord injury, when extensors remain weak but flexors
regain strength, sometimes even to the extent of an unhelpful
spasticity.
These observations motivate the search for principled interven-
tions to modify reticulospinal connections, which could enhance
functional recovery after lesion. Previous work has induced plastic

Significance Statement
This report is the first demonstration that the long-latency stretch reflex can be modified by repeated, precisely timed pairing of
stimuli known to activate brainstem pathways. Furthermore, pairing was achieved with a portable electronic device capable of
delivering many more stimulus repetitions than conventional laboratory studies. Our findings open up new possibilities for basic

 changes in the cortex by consistently pairing stimuli that act on a
common circuit. By the principles of spike timing-dependent plas-
ticity, if a postsynaptic neuron is activated consistently after a pre-
synaptic input, that input is strengthened; reversing this timing
weakens the input (Markram et al., 1997). Plasticity protocols can
use pairs of stimuli delivered using microelectrodes (Bi and Poo,
2001), or can time one stimulus at a fixed delay after spontaneous
neural spikes (Jackson et al., 2006). It is also possible to induce plas-
ticity using noninvasive stimuli. Example paradigms targeting
the cortex pair transcranial magnetic brain stimulation with
peripheral nerve stimulation (Stefan et al., 2000) or stimula-
tion of the motor points of two hand muscles (Ridding and
Uy, 2003). To date, no reports have attempted to induce plas-
ticity in reticulospinal pathways.
An essential prerequisite to induce spike timing-dependent
plasticity is to find two stimuli that converge on a common target
circuit. It is well known that the brainstem nuclei that give rise to
the reticulospinal tract receive extensive afferent input (Leiras et
al., 2010); electrical stimulation in the periphery will thus gener-
ate robust synaptic input. We recently demonstrated that primate
reticular neurons fire bursts of action potentials after loud audi-
tory clicks (Fisher et al., 2012). We therefore hypothesized that
precisely timed pairing of peripheral shocks with clicks may lead
to plasticity in reticulospinal circuits.
Experimental study of plasticity finally requires a way to mea-
sure any changes. For the corticospinal system, motor-evoked
potentials following transcranial magnetic brain stimulation
are typically used to assay connectivity. Similarly unambiguous
noninvasive measures of reticulospinal function are not avail-
able. One option may be to assess the long-latency stretch reflex
(LLSR). For distal muscles acting on the digits or wrist, the LLSR
appears to have a substantial component passing via the primary
motor cortex and the corticospinal tract (Cheney and Fetz, 1984;
Matthews et al., 1990), although even the LLSR in finger muscles
has a reticulospinal contribution (Soteropoulos et al., 2012). For
muscles acting on the elbow and shoulder, although there is un-
doubtedly a corticospinal contribution (Evarts and Tanji, 1976;
Pruszynski et al., 2011b), there is evidence that this is reduced
compared with more distal muscles (Fellows et al., 1996) and that
there may also be a subcortical component (Kimura et al., 2006).
We therefore hypothesized that LLSR in a more proximal muscle
might partially measure reticulospinal output (Kurtzer, 2015),
and that paired stimuli targeted to induce plasticity in reticu-
lospinal pathways might modify the LLSR.
To date, most experiments on synaptic plasticity have paired
stimuli for only short periods, working within the confines of a
laboratory setting. While changes may be induced, they typically
fade after approximately an hour. We wished instead to develop
protocols that could be applied for many hours while the subject
went about their normal daily activities. To this end, we devel-
oped a wearable electronic device that is capable of delivering the
required stimuli in a portable system. In this report, we describe
the successful induction of plasticity using this device measured
as a change in LLSR, which may partially reflect spike timing-
dependent processes within the brainstem.
Materials and Methods
Results were obtained from 74 healthy volunteers (22 male; age range,
19–84 years) from �89 experiments. All procedures were approved by
the local ethical committee of Newcastle University Medical School, and
full written consent was obtained from each participant.
Measurement of stretch reflex. Subjects were seated in a rigid chair,
fitted with a five-point harness to prevent trunk and shoulder move-
ments. An electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from the biceps and
brachioradialis muscles of the right arm, using adhesive surface elec-
trodes (brachioradialis muscle: model H59P, Kendall; biceps muscle:
model H91SSG, Kendall) placed over the muscle belly with an interelec-
trode spacing of 2 cm for the brachioradialis and 3–5 cm for the biceps.
Electrodes were connected to a Digitimer D360 amplifier (gain, 1000;
bandpass filter, 30 Hz to 2 kHz). The arm was fitted into a robotic device,
which measured elbow flexion angle and could generate torques around
the elbow using a powerful motor (part #353301, Maxon; with a 25:1
planetary gearhead and a further 1.6:1 reduction ratio generated by the
gear wheels and belt drive linking the motor to the drive shaft). The
forearm was partially pronated, and the shoulder was flexed at 45° and
abducted at 90° (Fig. 1A). Subjects were instructed to maintain a 90°
flexion against a background torque by moving a cursor related to elbow
angle into a target displayed on a computer screen. With a delay of 1.5–2 s
after the target was acquired (chosen at random from a uniform distri-
bution), the motor torque increased to a high level (�86 Nm, measured
as a static torque when activating the motor for a prolonged period) for
150–200 ms, generating an elbow extension movement with a near-
constant velocity of 150–300°/s. This was a little lower than the expected
velocity obtained by taking the specified free-running speed of the motor
and correcting for the gearing (404°/s). It is likely therefore that the large
torque generated by the motor rapidly accelerated the arm to a terminal
velocity, in which friction in the gears and bearings was equal and oppo-
site to the motor torque. These perturbations evoked consistent short-
and long-latency reflexes (Thilmann et al., 1991; Trumbower et al., 2013)
in the recorded muscles. Subjects were told to return the arm to the
central target after each perturbation, but were not required to do this
within any time constraints. A total of 60 trials was recorded for each
session, comprising 20 trials at each of three levels of background torque.
Levels of background torque were determined individually for the sub-
ject to allow comfortable task performance, and ranged from 0 to 4.5 Nm;
the same levels were used for that subject in both recording sessions.
EMG, elbow displacement, and motor torque signals together with
markers indicating task events were captured with a personal computer
(5 kHz sampling rate) using a 1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic
Design). Subsequent analysis involved constructing averages of rectified
EMG, using custom scripts written in the MATLAB environment.
Experimental protocol. All experiments followed the same general pat-
tern (Fig. 1B). Subjects came to the laboratory before 9:30 A.M., and a
set of stretch reflex recordings were made. They were then fitted with a
wearable electronic device, designed to deliver electrical and auditory
stimuli. The wearable device generated constant-current electrical stim-
uli to the biceps muscle (surface electrodes and placement as above;
220 V compliance; 150 �s pulse width; more proximal electrode nega-
tive). The intensity was adjusted to be just below the motor threshold
(defined as a visible muscle twitch); subjects reported a weak paresthesia
produced by the stimulus. Auditory stimuli were generated by delivering
a 0.1-ms-wide, 12-V-square excitation pulse into a miniature earpiece;
this produced a brief click with an intensity of 110 dB SPL. Based on
calculations provided by Rosengren et al. (2010), this intensity delivered
at 0.66 Hz for 8 h corresponds to an A-weighted intensity of 68 dB LAeq
(equivalent continuous level), which is well below the recommended safe
limit for hearing of 85 dB LAeq given by the UK Control of Noise at Work
Regulations (The Stationery Office, 2005). The earpiece was placed in
either the left or the right ear. We found no consistent differences that
were dependent on which ear was stimulated; recordings from monkey
reticular formation also showed that cells could be activated by clicks
delivered to a wide area of the scalp by a bone vibrator (K. M. Fisher, B.
Zaaimi, and S. N. Baker, personal communication). Stimuli were deliv-
ered with an interstimulus interval of 1.25–1.75 s (chosen at random
from a uniform distribution). Subjects then left the laboratory and con-
tinued their usual daily activities. As most subjects were staff or students
in the university, this typically involved office or laboratory tasks, such as
typing and soldering. After 5:00 P.M., they returned, the wearable device
was removed, and a further set of stretch reflex recordings was made.
Because the electrodes over the biceps muscle were used for both record-
ing reflex responses and for stimulation, they were kept in place for the
whole day, ensuring consistency between the morning and evening re-

 cordings. For the brachioradialis muscle, either the electrodes were also
left in place all day or their location was marked after the morning session
with a UV fluorescent marker pen; this ensured that electrodes could be
replaced in exactly the same location for the evening reflex recording.
Four different stimulus combinations were tested in different experi-
ments; these are illustrated in Figure 1C–F, together with a schematic that
indicates the effects in the brainstem, which we hypothesized each would
generate, given previous work. The first paradigm placed the electrical
stimulus 10 ms before the click. We expect the biceps stimulus to gener-
ate an EPSP within the reticular formation in a human subject with a
latency of �10 ms (see Discussion). The click should generate an action
potential burst after �7 ms (Fisher et al., 2012). We predicted therefore
that this timing would lead to the EPSP consistently arriving just before
the spike burst, and should lead to long-term potentiation. By contrast,
when the click preceded the electrical stimulus by 25 ms (Fig. 1D), this
should place the EPSP after the spike burst, and generate long-term
depression. Two control conditions (Fig. 1E,F) tested the effect of giving
electrical or auditory stimuli alone. Some subjects participated in more
than one of these paradigms; at least 1 week separated different experi-
ments in the same subject.
Analysis. Figure 2A illustrates 10 sweeps of raw EMG from a single
subject following the perturbation. An average of the elbow displacement
trace revealed a nearly linear ramp perturbation (Fig. 2B). One problem
that we encountered was considerable variation in the level of back-
ground EMG before the perturbation onset. Since it is known that the
stretch reflex scales with background activation (Matthews, 1986), an
inconsistent background would render comparisons of the morning and
evening reflex recordings invalid.
Figure 2C illustrates the approach taken to this problem. We first mea-
suredthebackgroundEMGineachofthe60availablesweepsoverthe50ms
before perturbation onset, for both morning and evening recordings. The
interval from the largest to the smallest background measured was divided
into20equallyspacedbins,andeachsweepwasallocatedtooneofthesebins.
This led to a distribution histogram, as shown in Figure 2C. For each bin, we
tooktheminimumcountbetweenthemorningandeveningrecordings.For
the session that had this minimum, all sweeps falling in that bin were used.
Fortheothersession,anumberofsweepsequaltotheminimumcountwere
chosen at random. Following this procedure for all bins led to selection of a
subsetofsweeps,withequalnumbersinbothmorningandeveningsessions,
and with a very similar mean background EMG level. These sweeps were
averaged together, generating traces, as shown in Figure 2D.
Following previous work (Mortimer et al., 1981; Pruszynski et al.,
2011a), responses were categorized by their latency (Fig. 2D) as short-
latency stretch reflex (R1; 20–50 ms), long-latency stretch reflex (R2;
50–100 ms), and voluntary reflex response (�100 ms). Within the R1
and R2 windows, the percentage increase of the area under the curve
relative to the background was used as a measure of reflex amplitude. The
significance of changes in reflex amplitude were assessed using t tests on
the single sweep measures of the area under the curve above background,
with a threshold of p � 0.05.
Results
Figure 2D illustrates an example result from one subject, in which
the wearable device was programmed to deliver electrical stimuli
to the biceps muscle 10 ms before a click (Fig. 1C, protocol). The
background level of EMG was very similar for recordings made
before and after the wearable device intervention (Fig. 2D, red
vs black traces), confirming the efficiency of the method of sweep
selection described in Materials and Methods (Fig. 2C). Although
very similar for the R1 component, the long-latency stretch reflex
(R2) was noticeably enhanced in the later recording. Figure 2F
presents measures of the area under the curve for each response
window; there was a significant increase in the R2 response.
Figure 3 presents group results for recordings from the biceps
muscle. These have been separated into R1 (Fig. 3A,B) and R2
(Fig. 3C,D) components. Figure 3, A and C, shows mean reflex
amplitudes, calculated across all subjects participating in a given
wearable device protocol (as defined in Fig. 1C–F). The R2 com-
ponent showed a significant increase (p � 0.0002, paired t test),
on average from 176% to 263% of baseline (an increase of 49%)
for the condition where the electrical stimulus preceded the click
by 10 ms. There was a significant decrease (p � 0.005, paired t
test), on average from 239% to 165% of baseline (a decrease of
31%) when the click preceded the electrical stimulus by 25 ms
(Fig. 3C). The direction of these effects was as predicted on the
Figure1.

 basis of spike timing-dependent plasticity (Fig. 1C,D). There was
no significant difference in the size of the control reflex (before
wearable device stimulation) between these two experiments. A
small but significant decrease (by 17%; p � 0.02, paired t test) was
also seen in the R1 reflex for the second protocol. The control
protocols, where either electrical or auditory stimuli were given
alone, produced no significant changes (p � 0.05, paired t test).
It is now well recognized that plasticity protocols often lead to
substantial heterogeneity in response across subjects (Wiethoff et
al., 2014); some of this may be determined by genetic factors
(Cheeran et al., 2008). Accordingly, Figure 3, B and D, examines
at the single-subject level how many showed significant changes.
Each bar shows the number of subjects with significant increases,
significant decreases. or no significant change for a given protocol
and response window. For protocols with no significant change
in average response, the pattern across subjects tended to be in-
consistent, with some increases and decreases seen. However, for
R2 reflex following paired stimulation, a clear pattern emerged
that supported the group-averaged data. When the electrical
stimuli preceded the click, 15 of 25 subjects showed a significant
rise in R2, compared with only 2 of 25 subjects showing a de-
crease. By contrast, when the click preceded the electrical stimu-
lus, 24 of 33 subjects showed a drop in R2 amplitude, but only
5 of 33 subjects showed a rise. To see counts as extreme as 15 of
25 and 24 of 33 subjects is highly unlikely by chance (p �
10 �17, based on the binomial distribution, with n � 25 and
n � 33 respectively and success probability p(hit) � 0.025).
Similar results were obtained if we considered simply whether
reflexes increased or decreased, regardless of whether these
changes were significant for an individual subject (electrical
stimulus before click, 23 of 25 subjects showed increased R2;
click before electrical stimulus, 26 of 33 subjects showed de-

 creased R2; both p � 0.002 based on binomial distribution
with p(hit) � 0.5).
The wearable device protocols examined involved electrical
stimulation of the biceps muscle; however, stretch reflex re-
cordings were made from both biceps and brachioradialis,
which are both elbow flexors in the arm posture tested. This
allowed us to examine the extent to which changes in reflex
amplitude were specific to the stimulated muscle or might
spread to anatomical agonists. Figure 4 presents the results for
the brachioradialis muscle, in a format similar to those shown
in Figure 3. No significant changes were seen in any of the
group averages (Fig. 4A,C). At the single-subject level, similar
numbers of subjects in a given protocol
showed significant increases or de-
creases (Fig. 4B,D), suggesting that this
reflected noise fluctuations in ampli-
tude measurement rather than consis-
tent plastic changes.
Discussion
Pathways contributing to the
long-latency stretch reflex
Following the discovery of the LLSR (Ham-
mond,1954),considerableresearchfocused
on the pathways responsible. This reached a
consensus by the early 1990s that the LLSR
in muscles acting on the digits or wrist was
mediated largely by Group Ia muscle affer-
ents traversing a transcortical pathway
(Matthews,1991).However,thisdidnotex-
clude other contributions. For example,
some continued to argue that cutaneous af-
ferents play a dominant role (Corden et al.,
2000); earlier studies suggested that the
LLSR was a spinal reflex mediated by slower
conducting Group II afferents (Matthews,
1984), although subsequent results did not
support this (Matthews, 1989). For muscles
acting around the elbow or shoulder, motor
cortical recordings in monkeys reveal evi-
dence for some transcortical contribution
(Evarts and Tanji, 1976; Pruszynski et al.,
2011b).Transcranialmagneticbrainstimuli
delivered over motor cortex and timed to
coincide with the LLSR are facilitated, also
suggesting a transcortical contribution
(Pruszynski et al., 2011b). However, evi-
dence from patients with motor disorders
suggests that the transcortical route for the
LLSR may be less important in elbow mus-
cles compared with the hand (Thilmann et
al., 1991; Fellows et al., 1996). The tonic vi-
brationreflex,whichmayrelatetotheLLSR,
relies on the brainstem reticular formation
(Gillies et al., 1971). Even for finger pertur-
bations, we have recently shown that the re-
ticular formation probably contributes to
the LLSR (Soteropoulos et al., 2012). It
therefore seems probable that the reticular
formation contributes to LLSR in more
proximal muscles as well (Kurtzer, 2015),
and could even be the dominant pathway.
Such evidence caused us to measure
changes in the LLSR following elbow
perturbations after a paired stimulus protocol designed to tar-
get reticulospinal output. Our finding that the LLSR exhibits
plastic changes, in a manner consistent with our predictions of
how paired stimuli should modify reticulospinal output, is
consistent with a reticulospinal role in elbow muscle LLSR.
Spike timing-dependent plasticity
Several features of our results suggest that we were able to induce
spike timing-dependent plastic changes. First, the control condi-
tions that delivered either electrical stimulation of biceps alone or
clicks alone failed to generate consistent changes in the reflex

 measures. This not only controls for the
effects of the unpaired stimuli, but also
provides confidence that there were no
consistent changes in the reflexes between
the morning and evening assessments,
caused, for example, by diurnal rhythms
or fatigue. Second, it is striking that shift-
ing the relative timing of the two stimuli
by only 35 ms should have had such a pro-
found effect, reversing an average facilita-
tion in biceps R2 reflex to a suppression.
Finally, plastic changes were seen only in
the biceps muscle, which was stimulated,
and not in the closely related agonist
brachioradialis. This seems to fulfil the
“specificity” criterion of long-term poten-
tiation whereby effects are limited to the
stimulated site, although we cannot rule
out the alternative possibility that only
pathways targeting the biceps are capable
of showing these changes.
The stimulus timings were chosen
based on the expected delays to generate
activity within the reticular formation.
In monkeys, we know that reticular re-
sponses to clicks have and onset latency of
�7 ms (Fisher et al., 2012). Although the
human head is larger, most of this delay
relates to central processing rather than
axonal conduction, so that it is likely to be
only slightly longer in humans. Electrical
stimulation of the human median nerve at
the wrist produces EEG responses attrib-
uted to the medial lemniscus, with a la-
tency of �14 ms (Taylor and Black, 1984);
effects should reach the reticular forma-
tion shortly afterward. We estimate the
distance between the biceps motor point
and the wrist as 350–400 mm; using a fast
afferent conduction velocity of 85 m/s,
this would imply a reduction of 4–5 ms in
latencies to account for the more proxi-
mal stimulus site. Synaptic potentials in
the reticular formation should thus start
at �10 ms after the biceps electrical stim-
ulus. Stimulating the biceps motor point
10 ms before the click should therefore
place the earliest synaptic potentials
from afferent input at �7 ms before the
action potential burst generated by the
click. This timing is therefore appropri-
ate to generate potentiation of the synaptic inputs.
When reversing the timings, we must also take account of the
duration of the action potential burst; neural firing can continue
for up to 25 ms after the click (Fisher et al., 2012). Placing the
biceps stimulus 25 ms after the click should, therefore, position
the synaptic potentials from afferent input at �10 ms after the
end of the action potential burst; this should be appropriate to
depress the synaptic inputs.
It is impossible to be certain of the site of the plastic changes
that we have measured in the LLSR, but the success of the chosen
timings argues that some modification of synapses may have oc-
curred within the brainstem itself. Other possibilities are within
spinal cord interneurons, or within the cortex, but the anatomy
of the conduction delays conspires to make these less likely. If a
spinal cord interneuron discharged following a click-elicited re-
ticulospinal burst, this would be at least 3–4 ms later than the
burst onset in the brainstem. This estimate is based on the fact
that central motor conduction time from M1 to cervical enlarge-
ment in human is �7 ms (Jaiser et al., 2015). The brainstem is
approximately halfway along this path, and fast reticulospinal
and corticospinal fibers have a similar conduction velocity (Rid-
dle et al., 2009). By contrast, an afferent volley following the
biceps stimulus would arrive at the cervical enlargement 3–4 ms
earlier than at the brainstem. The interval between the responses

 then increases from the estimate of 7 ms at the brainstem esti-
mated above, to �14 ms at the spinal cord; this is less likely to
drive plastic changes. For the cortex, the responses to biceps stim-
ulation will be delayed by �6 ms relative to the brainstem, but
those following the auditory click by substantially more: the ear-
liest cortical auditory-evoked potential occurs with 50 ms latency
(Farrell et al., 1980). The responses in the brainstem appear best
timed to generate spike timing-dependent changes, although it is
impossible to rule out a contribution from other centers.
A small suppression was seen in the R1 reflex when the biceps
stimulus followed the click (Fig. 3A), indicating that changes within
spinal circuits may also have played a role in our results. Human
subjects, monkeys, and rats can all learn to increase or decrease the
size of an H reflex (the electrical analog of the R1 reflex) if appropri-
ately rewarded (Thompson and Wolpaw, 2014). In monkeys
subjected to repeated reflex testing, but with no attempt at up- or
down-conditioning, there is a progressive reduction of the R1 reflex
(Meyer-Lohmann et al., 1986). In the rat, reflex conditioning de-
pends on the corticospinal tract and sensorimotor cortex, but not
otherdescendingpathways(ChenandWolpaw,1997,2002;Chenet
al., 2006a,b). Down-conditioning leads to increases in identifiable
GABAergic terminals in the spinal cord (Wang et al., 2006), but is
dependent on an intact cerebellum (Chen and Wolpaw, 2005);
therefore, spinal plasticity seems to be guided and maintained by
supraspinal pathways. It is likely that conceptually similar processes
areoccurringhere,althoughwhetherthesamecentralstructuresand
descendingpathwaysthatcontributetoreflexconditioningintherat
are responsible in this case remains to be determined.
The LLSR is known to change depending on the behavioral con-
text;thisappearsflexiblytointegratetheknownbiomechanicsofthe
limb (Kurtzer et al., 2008). It is unclear how the plastic changes that
we have seen would interact with these task-dependent changes. It is
also unclear how long plastic changes would last, and whether they
could be prolonged by applying the stimulus pairing for longer than
the�7hthatwetestedinthisreport.Allofthesequestionsremainto
be addressed in future studies. However, this report marks the first
demonstration of plasticity in the LLSR induced with paired stimu-
lusparadigms,andmayindicatethatbrainstemaswellascorticospi-
nal descending systems can undergo plastic changes. Previous work
has shown that rehabilitation after spinal cord injury can be en-
hanced by up- or down-conditioning of spinal reflexes (Chen et al.,
2006c; Thompson et al., 2013). We hope that the novel protocol
introduced here may open up new possibilities for enhancing reha-
bilitationduringrecoveryfromstrokeorspinalcordinjury,inwhich
we have shown that brainstem pathways play an important role
(Zaaimi et al., 2012).
