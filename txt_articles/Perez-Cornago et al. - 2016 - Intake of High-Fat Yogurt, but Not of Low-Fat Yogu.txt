Abstract
Background: Yogurt and prebiotic consumption has been linked to better health. However, to our knowledge, no longi-
tudinal study has assessed the association of yogurt and prebiotic consumption with depression risk.
Objective: We longitudinally evaluated the association of yogurt and prebiotic consumption with depression risk in a
Mediterranean cohort.
Methods: The SUN (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra) Project is a dynamic, prospective cohort of Spanish university
graduates. A total of 14,539 men and women (mean age: 37 y) initially free of depression were assessed during a median
follow-up period of 9.3 y. Validated food-frequency questionnaires at baseline and after a 10-y follow-up were used to
assess prebiotic (fructans and galacto-oligosaccharide) intake and yogurt consumption (<0.5, $0.5 to <3, $3 to
<7, and $7 servings/wk). Participants were classified as incident cases of depression when they reported a new clinical
diagnosis of depression by a physician (previously validated). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to
calculate HRs and 95% CIs.
Results: We identified 727 incident cases of depression during follow-up. Whole-fat yogurt intake was associated
with reduced depression risk: HR for the highest [$7 servings/wk (1 serving = 125 g)] compared with the lowest (<0.5
servings/wk) consumption: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.98; P-trend = 0.020). When stratified by sex, this association was
significant only in women (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.87; P-trend = 0.004). Low-fat yogurt consumption was associated
with a higher incidence of depression (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.65; P-trend = 0.001), although this association lost
significance after the exclusion of early incident cases, suggesting possible reverse causation bias. Prebiotic consumption
was not significantly associated with depression risk.
Conclusions: Our study suggests that high consumption of whole-fat yogurt was related to a lower risk of depression in
women of the SUN cohort. No association was observed for prebiotics. Further studies are needed to clarify why the
yogurt-depression association may differ by fat content of the yogurt.

Introduction
Unipolar depression has reached epidemic proportions worldwide
and is expected to be the leading cause of disability in developing
countries by the year 2030 (1). Although depression seems to be a
multifactorial disease (2), diet has recently emerged as a determi-
nant factor for the prevention and treatment of this mental
disorder (3). Current studies have shown that diet influences gut
microbiota composition and activity (4), and that this, in turn,
may influence brain function, including depressive illness (5, 6).
Some of the mechanisms that may link these functions include
immune, neural, and metabolic pathways (5). Therefore, the gut
microbiota–brain axis has been proposed as an underlying link
between diet quality and depression (6).
Both probiotics and prebiotics are able to enhance and
maintain a healthy gut microbiota in humans (7). Probiotics are
defined as ‘‘live microorganisms that, when administered in

 adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host’’ (8).
Probiotics must survive the gastrointestinal transit to exert a
health-promoting effect (9), and they can be consumed in
various forms, but mainly as either a functional food, such as in
yogurt/fermented milk formulas with live probiotic bacteria, or
as encapsulated supplements. Probiotic bacteria such as Bifido-
bacterium bifidum and/or Lactobacillus acidophilus can be
added to yogurts and fermented milks (8), and there is currently
a wide range of yogurts and fermented milks on the market that
contain probiotic bacteria (10). Commercial yogurt fulfills the
current concept of probiotics if it contains viable, live, and
abundant beneficial bacteria (namely Streptococcus thermophilus
and Lactobacillus bulgaricus) at a minimum concentration of 107
CFUs/g (9). Above this concentration, several health benefits
linked to the presence of live bacteria in yogurt have been
observed (11). Commercial yogurt consumption has been
suggested to favorably alter the gut microbiota and gut function
(12), decrease the risk of overweight or obesity and metabolic
syndrome (13, 14), improve immune-system activity (15), and
lead to a better lipid profile (16). To date, the association between
yogurt or fermented milks and depression has not been investi-
gated; however, probiotic consumption was previously reported
to be associated with reduced anxiety and depressive-like behav-
iors in some small-scale human studies (17).
A prebiotic is defined as ‘‘a selectively fermented ingredient
that results in specific changes in the composition and/or activity
of the gastrointestinal microbiota, thus conferring benefit(s)
upon
host
health’’
(18).
Fructans
[fructo-oligosaccharides
(FOSs)10 and inulin] and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs) are
the most important prebiotic sources, and they are mostly
present in fruit, vegetables and whole grains (19). Among the
beneficial effects attributed to prebiotics are the intestinal
growth of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium and/or
Lactobacillus strains), the improvement of gut barrier function
and host immunity, a lower risk of overweight or obesity, and
mitigation of inflammatory responses (20–22). Moreover, pre-
biotic administration may have antidepressant effects by mod-
ulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the immune
system, and metabolite-mediated pathways (5).
Considering that the suggested beneficial effects of probiotics
and prebiotics on brain development and behavior through the
gut microbiota–brain axis are mainly based on animal studies
and small short-term human studies (5, 6), it is of great interest
to determine whether the consumption of prebiotics and yogurt or
fermented milks is associated with a reduced risk of depression
in the long term in a large human study. Therefore, our aim was
to prospectively assess the association of yogurt (total, whole-
fat, and low-fat) and prebiotic consumption with the incidence
of depression among university graduates enrolled in a longitu-
dinal study with an average follow-up period >9 y, the Seguimiento
Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project.
Methods
Study population. The SUN study is a prospective cohort study with
continually open recruitment (i.e., a dynamic design), started in
December 1999 with alumni of the University of Navarra, registered
professionals from some Spanish provinces, and other university
graduates. Detailed information on this cohort has been described
elsewhere (23). Briefly, at enrollment and every 2 y, self-reported
questionnaires are administered to collect and update medical and
lifestyle information, although dietary information was collected only
twice, at baseline and after 10 y of follow-up.
For the present analysis, we included 21,291 participants who had
answered the baseline questionnaire before March 2012 to ensure that
all participants had the opportunity to answer the 2-y follow-up
questionnaire. Participants who reported total energy intakes at base-
line outside of recommended limits (total energy intakes >4000 and
>3500 kcal/d in men and women, respectively, and intakes <800 kcal/d in
men and <500 kcal/d in women; n = 2011) were not included in the
analysis (24). Participants with cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular
disease at the beginning of the study were also excluded (n = 1198). We
excluded 2085 participants who reported antidepressant medication
at baseline or who had a history of physician-diagnosed depression
throughout their life. Of the 16,000 remaining participants, 1427
subjects were lost to follow-up (retention rate: 91%), and 31 participants
had missing data on some of the variables of interest. Finally, data from
14,539 participants were included in our main longitudinal analysis.
This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki,
and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of Navarra. The completion of the self-administered ques-
tionnaire was considered to imply informed consent (23).
Assessment of prebiotic and yogurt consumption. Dietary intake
was measured by a self-administered 136-item semiquantitative FFQ
administered twice, at baseline and after 10 y of follow-up, which has
been previously validated in Spain (25). The FFQ used in this study was
not focused on each individual food but on food groups. The intraclass
correlation coefficient for dairy products from the FFQ and from four
3-d food records was 0.84 (26). To determine usual dietary intake over
the previous year, frequencies of intake were measured in 9 categories,
ranging from ‘‘never or almost never’’ to ‘‘six or more times per day.’’
As previously detailed (22), we used dietary intakes from the FFQ to
calculate the total fructans (FOSs and inulin) and GOS consumption,
and these values were updated in 29% of participants who completed
the 10-y follow-up FFQ. This percentage is not high, largely because of
the late entry in the cohort and its dynamic design. Total prebiotic
consumption was estimated by summing total fructans and GOS
consumption. The main food contributors to fructans and GOS intakes
in our cohort were vegetables (the main contributor was asparagus) and
cereals (the main contributors were both white bread and whole-grain
bread) (22).
Participants reported the frequency of whole-fat and low-fat yogurt
consumption in both FFQs (at baseline and after 10 y of follow-up),
whereas total yogurt consumption was calculated by summing the
previous 2 food items. Participants were allocated into 4 categories
according to servings (1 serving = 125 g) of yogurt (total, whole-fat
[;3% fat], and low-fat (;0.1% fat)] consumed per week: <0.5 servings
(<63 g), $0.5 to <3 servings ($63 to <250 g), $3 to <7 servings ($250
to <875 g), and $7 servings ($875 g).
Outcome assessment. Information on physician-diagnosed depression
is updated biennially (Q_2-Q_14). Thus, we defined as an incident case
of depression any participant who responded affirmatively to the
question ‘‘Have you ever been diagnosed with depression by a medical
doctor?’’ and who was free of depression at baseline. Self-reported
medical diagnosis of depression has been previously validated in a
subsample of this cohort by using the Structured Clinical Interview for

 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
Edition, as the gold standard (27). The percentage of confirmed depression
cases was 74.2% (95% CI: 63.3%, 85.1%) and the percentage of
confirmed nondepression cases was 81.1% (95% CI: 69.1%, 92.9%).
Assessment of covariates. Demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex,
and marital and employment status), lifestyle behaviors [e.g., smoking
status, leisure-time physical activity, total energy intake, adherence to the
Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) by using the MedDiet score proposed by
Bach et al. (28), and fiber consumption], weight gain (>3 kg) in the 5 y
before entering the cohort, BMI, and comorbidity information (e.g.,
prevalence/history of cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease) were
collected in the baseline questionnaire. Participants also answered
questions about personality and behavior, such as their levels of
competitiveness, anxiety, and dependence, by using Likert scales with
values in the range of 0–10. Finally, physical activity was assessed with a
validated questionnaire (29).
Statistical analysis. Chi-square tests for trend (categorical variables)
and ordinary least-squares linear regression analyses (continuous vari-
ables) across categories or prebiotic and yogurt consumption were used
for comparisons of baseline characteristics. We categorized our exposure
variables in quartiles, because quartiles allow for a sufficiently high (and
equally sized) sample size in each category and for assessment of dose-
response trends.
Cox regression models were fitted to assess the relation of yogurt and
prebiotic consumption at baseline with the risk of developing depression
during follow-up, at which time HRs (95% CIs) were calculated. Tests
for linear trend across quartiles of yogurt or prebiotic consumption were
performed by assigning the median value of intake within each category
and treating these as continuous variables in the respective multivariable-
adjusted Cox regression models. Prebiotic and yogurt consumption data
were updated after 10 y of follow-up, and Cox regression models with
time-dependent exposures were also fitted. Age was used as the underlying
time variable. Age at baseline was used as the entry time variable. Birth
date was taken as the origin of the time scale. Exit time was defined as a
diagnosis of depression or age at censoring due to death or loss to follow-
up. Analyses were stratified by date of recruitment (2-y periods) and
deciles of age. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by using
the Schoenfeld residuals method.
In the multiple-adjusted models, the following potential confounders
were included as covariates: age (underlying time variable), sex, smoking
(never, current, former, or missing), physical activity (quartiles), total
energy intake (quartiles), baseline BMI (quartiles), living alone (yes or
no), unemployment (yes or no), marital status (married or not), and the
3 personality traits [competitiveness (higher scores, more competitive),
relaxation (lower scores, more relaxed), and dependency or locus of
control (higher scores, more dependent)]. Two a priori–defined tests for
interaction by sex and age (#40 or >40 y) were conducted by introducing
interaction terms in the model and then comparing the models with and
without the interaction term by using likelihood ratio tests. We conducted
stratified analyses according to the fat content to explore potential
differential associations because other studies have suggested a possible
difference (30).
Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our
estimates. We reconducted our analyses with the use of the following
alternative assumptions: 1) additionally adjusting for adherence to the
MedDiet; 2) additionally adjusting for other fiber consumption apart
from prebiotics (only in the prebiotic analysis); 3) additionally adjusting
for n–3 PUFAs; 4) excluding early incident cases of depression (until 2 y
of follow-up); 5) including prevalent cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular
disease; 6) including only those participants with prevalent obesity [BMI
(in kg/m2) >30]; 7) including only those participants who had gained
$3 kg in the past 5 y; 8) changing the energy limits (5th–95th
percentiles); 9) including only women and excluding early incident cases
of depression (until 2 y of follow-up); and 10) including only men and
excluding early incident cases of depression (until 2 y of follow-up). The
rationale for the exclusion of these early cases was that cases diagnosed
early during the follow-up period might be more likely to have been
present as subclinical cases at baseline. All of the analyses were 2-tailed,
and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed
by using STATA version 12.0 (StataCorp).
Results
The characteristics of participants subdivided by categories of
total prebiotic and yogurt consumption are shown in Table 1.
The highest category of total prebiotic consumption included a
higher proportion of women, nonsmokers, unemployed partic-
ipants, and participants with better adherence to the MedDiet,
who were more physically active, and with a lower BMI. There
were higher proportions of women, nonsmokers, younger people,
unemployed participants, and participants living alone among
those in the highest category of total yogurt consumption.
Moreover, participants with a higher yogurt consumption were
more physically active and had better adherence to the MedDiet.
After 9.3 y of follow-up, a total of 727 incident cases of
depression were identified. The exposure variables were all defined
by using repeated measurements of diet (baseline and after 10 y of
follow-up). No interaction was observed between age or sex and
any of the dietary exposures (P-interaction = 0.12–0.90). How-
ever, there was a significant sex 3 low-fat yogurt intake interaction
(P-interaction = 0.017), so these data are also presented for each
sex separately.
The association between prebiotic consumption and the risk
of depression is shown in Table 2. In all of the participants, the
multiple-adjusted model showed that although a higher con-
sumption of fructans, GOSs, and total prebiotics seemed to be
associated with a lower risk of depression [HRs (95% CIs) for
the highest compared with the lowest quartile of intake: 0.94
(0.74, 1.20) for fructans, 0.87 (0.69, 1.08) for GOSs, and 0.92
(0.73, 1.17) for total prebiotics], this association was not
significant. When analyses were divided by sex, no association
between prebiotic intake (fructans, GOSs, and total prebiotics)
and depression risk was observed.
Table 3 shows the HRs for depression in relation to yogurt
consumption. With consideration of all participants, whole-fat
yogurt intake was associated with a decreased risk of depression
[HR for the highest ($7 servings/wk) compared with the lowest
(<0.5 servings/wk) consumption: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.98;
P-trend = 0.020]. Conversely, a higher consumption of low-fat
yogurt was related to a higher risk of depression [HR for the
highest ($7 servings/wk) compared with the lowest (<0.5
servings/wk) consumption: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.65; P-trend =
0.001], but there was no evidence of an association with total
yogurt intake. Stratified analyses showed that the previous
associations between yogurt consumption and incident depres-
sion were only significant in women [HRs (95% CIs) for the
highest ($7 servings/wk) compared with the lowest (<0.5
servings/wk) consumption: 0.66 (0.50, 0.87; P-trend = 0.004)
and 1.37 (1.07, 1.76; P-trend < 0.001) for whole-fat and low-fat
yogurt, respectively].
The association between fructans, GOSs, and total prebiotic
consumption and the incidence of depression remained nonsig-
nificant in all of our sensitivity analyses (Supplemental Table 1),
and no association between total yogurt consumption and the
risk of depression was observed (Supplemental Table 2). When
nonobese participants and those with a stable weight in the past
5 y were excluded, the inverse association between whole-fat
yogurt consumption and the risk of depression was attenuated
(Supplemental Table 2). However, excluding early incident cases
of depression (until 2 y of follow-up); additionally adjusting for
adherence to the MedDiet or n–3 PUFAs; including participants

 with prevalent cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease; and
including those with energy limits between the 5th and 95th
percentiles did not alter the results. In analyses stratified by sex
we observed that the inverse association between whole-fat
yogurt and depression risk in women remained statistically
significant even after excluding early incident cases. Importantly,
the positive association of low-fat yogurt consumption with the
incidence of depression was no longer significant after excluding
early cases of depression (Supplemental Table 2). This was
observed in all of the participants and also in women.
Discussion
In this prospective study, we found that a higher consumption of
whole-fat yogurt was related to a lower risk of depression in
women. The consumption of prebiotics or total yogurt was not
significantly associated with depression risk. These longitudinal
results are novel, and this is, to our knowledge, the first
prospective study that analyzed the association between yogurt
and prebiotic consumption and depression risk.
Unhealthy diets have been shown to have a detrimental
effect on depression due to their harmful effects on hormones,
the immune system, neurodegenerative factors, and the ex-
pression of potentially damaging genes (31–35). Conversely,
healthy dietary patterns, such as the MedDiet, the Alternative
Healthy Eating Index, or a plant-based (‘‘provegetarian’’)
dietary pattern, might have a protective effect against the incidence
of depression (36).
Recent evidence suggests that prebiotics, including fructans
and GOSs, modulate brain function by modifying the gut
microbiota, decreasing low-grade inflammation, and/or influ-
encing the production of neurochemicals (5, 6). Prebiotics are
fermented by beneficial bacteria, including Bifidobacterium
and Lactobacillus, to produce SCFAs, which may suppress
proinflammatory cytokines (37). A recent study in healthy
volunteers showed that those supplemented with bimuno-
GOSs had lower cortisol awakening reactivity (a reliable
marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity),
whereas FOS administration had no effect (38). An animal
study showed that prebiotic feeding increased brain-derived
neurotropic factor expression, probably through the involve-
ment of gut hormones (39). The same authors also showed that
the ingestion of bimuno-GOSs attenuated postinflammatory
anxiety in mice (40). In the current study we did not find any
significant association between prebiotic consumption and the
risk of depression. However, the point estimates suggest that
prebiotic consumption, especially GOSs, might be associated
with a lower risk of depression; therefore, it would be of great
interest to replicate these analyses in a cohort with a larger
number of incident cases of depression to increase the statistical
power.
A surprising finding of our study was a direct association
between low-fat yogurt consumption and depression risk
among women. However, this association was no longer
significant after excluding those cases of depression that
occurred within the first 2 y of follow-up. Therefore, this
association might be due to reverse causality, so that subclinical

 (i.e., ‘‘hidden’’) cases of depression at baseline might be
responsible for the higher low-fat yogurt consumption among
participants who were diagnosed with depression early in the
follow-up of the cohort. In fact, 1725 of the 2085 partici-
pants with prevalent depression consumed yogurt in our
cohort.

 Our finding of an inverse association between whole-fat
yogurt consumption and depression is consistent with previous
studies (41, 42). A cross-sectional study in 1745 pregnant
Japanese women showed an association between a higher intake
of yogurt and a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during
pregnancy (41). A fermented milk product with probiotics might
positively affect the activity of brain regions that control central
processing of emotion and sensation in healthy women (42).
Furthermore, yogurt consumption has been related to a lower
risk of overweight or obesity and metabolic syndrome (13, 14),
diseases that have been previously related to depression (43).
Moreover, preclinical research in rodents suggested that probi-
otics produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects by benefi-
cially affecting neural systems (noradrenaline) and normalizing
corticosterone release and concentrations of inflammatory bio-
markers (44, 45).
An association between the gut microbiota and depression
has been found in humans (46), and an increase in beneficial
bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria have
been observed after the consumption of commercial yogurt
supplemented with probiotics in healthy adults (47). A human
study showed that the status of the gut microbiota of mothers
may have important repercussions for the mental and neuro-
developmental health of their children (48). Several studies have
reported that >1 3 107 CFUs � g21 � d21 (9) or 1 3 109 CFUs �
serving21 � d21 (49) are enough to produce health benefits.
Therefore, if a yogurt contains $1 3 107 CFUs/g, the consumption
of 1 serving of yogurt (125 g)/d would be necessary to produce the
health benefit. We acknowledge that probiotics have a transient
effect on the gut microbiota. As stated by the International
Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics, most probi-
otics should be consumed daily for obtaining their expected health
benefit. In addition, further research is needed in the field of yogurt
consumption and changes in gut microbiota because it is still
necessary to clarify which bacterial populations are involved in
depression (50), although studies with Bifidobacterium infantis
show promising results (51).
The current study showed opposite results for the association
of whole- and low-fat yogurt consumption with the incidence
of depression. This explained why total yogurt consumption
was not related to depression risk. Because whole- and low-fat
yogurts seem not to differ in bacterial concentration (52), the
probiotic hypothesis does not appear to fully explain the
opposite associations found between whole- and low-fat yogurt
consumption and depression risk in our results, although it may
support the inverse association observed between whole-fat
yogurt and depression. Together with beneficial bacteria, yogurt
also contains zinc, vitamins (riboflavin, vitamin A, vitamin
E, thiamine, vitamin B-6, and folate), protein, carbohydrates
(lactose, glucose, and galactose), fat (including CLA), and
minerals (calcium, magnesium, and potassium). However, the
nutritional composition of yogurt varies depending on the
species and strains of bacteria used in the fermentation, the type
of milk (whole, semi-skim, or skim), fortification methods, store
conditions, etc. (15, 53). CLA has been proposed to have gut
anti-inflammatory properties (54), which may, in turn, improve
immune activity (15). Depression has been related to low-grade
inflammation, as well as with low folate consumption (34, 35).
Whole-fat yogurt contains a higher amount of fat (which
includes CLA) and folate than does fat-free yogurt (53). This
hypothesis may contribute, at least in part, to explain why we
only observed an inverse association for whole-fat yogurt consump-
tion but not for low-fat yogurt.
The inverse association between whole-fat yogurt consump-
tion and depression risk was significant only in women, although
no significant interaction between whole-fat yogurt and sex was
found. We may hypothesize that these differences are because, in
general, women are more conscious of their diet (55) and this
may lead to a lower measurement error in this group. Moreover,
women are more likely to suffer from depression than men (56).
The current study has some strengths and limitations. Strengths
of this study include its prospective longitudinal design, the use
of previously validated methods (25), the large sample size, and
the repeated measurements of diet. Participants were highly
educated, which increases the quality of self-reported infor-
mation and reduces the potential for misclassification bias. In
addition, the restriction to a fairly homogenous subgroup of
participants with regard to educational level minimizes the
potential for residual confounding and is an excellent technique to
improve the internal validity of our results. In addition, the long-
term follow-up may reduce the potential for reverse causation
bias.
A limitation of this study is that dietary intake and clinical
diagnosis of depression were self-reported; however, both
methods have been previously validated in our cohort (26, 27).
Although our FFQ asks about the consumption of low- or
whole-fat yogurt, it does not differentiate among other yogurt
varieties (e.g., bio- or probiotic yogurt). Together with fructans
and GOSs, other prebiotic sources should be acknowledged, but
they were not included in the analysis because there are currently
not enough data available in the literature (22). Moreover, our
FFQ is composed of 136 items and information on some possible
foods that contain prebiotics was not collected. We assumed a
relatively long induction period (from 0 to 10 y) for the
association of diet and depression. This may potentially be a
strong assumption. However, dietary habits tend to be corre-
lated within individuals across years of follow-up. Although 10 y
was the longest possible follow-up period, most cases occurred
after a follow-up period that was considerably shorter than 10 y.
Although the follow-up questionnaires were mainly focused on
outcomes (disease incidence, including depression incidence)
and were completed every 2 y, the full-length FFQ was admin-
istered twice, at baseline and after 10 y of follow-up, which
allowed the use of updated information on diet after 10 y.
Another potential limitation is that our participants are university
graduates and research in other population groups is needed
before our findings can be extrapolated to the general population.
Finally, it would have been of interest to determine the gut
microbiota composition of the participants, but stool samples
were not available in this study.
In summary, a high consumption of whole-fat yogurt was
related to a lower risk of depression in women of the SUN
cohort. The consumption of prebiotics was not significantly
associated with depression risk. The different effect observed
depending on the fat content of the yogurt encourages further
prospective studies to clarify these matters.
