ABSTRACT
Epigenetic regulation is based on a network of complexes that modulate
the chromatin character and structure of the genome to impact gene expression, cell
fate, and development. Thus, epigenetic modulators represent novel therapeutic targets
used to treat a range of diseases, including malignancies. Infectious pathogens such as
herpesviruses are also regulated by cellular epigenetic machinery, and epigenetic thera-
peutics represent a novel approach used to control infection, persistence, and the result-
ing recurrent disease. The histone H3K27 methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1 (EZH2/1)
are epigenetic repressors that suppress gene transcription via propagation of repressive
H3K27me3-enriched chromatin domains. However, while EZH2/1 are implicated in the
repression of herpesviral gene expression, inhibitors of these enzymes suppressed pri-
mary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these com-
pounds blocked lytic viral replication following induction of HSV reactivation in latently
infected sensory ganglia. Suppression correlated with the induction of multiple inflam-
matory, stress, and antipathogen pathways, as well as enhanced recruitment of immune
cells to in vivo infection sites. Importantly, EZH2/1 inhibitors induced a cellular antiviral
state that also suppressed infection with DNA (human cytomegalovirus, adenovirus) and
RNA (Zika virus) viruses. Thus, EZH2/1 inhibitors have considerable potential as general
antivirals through the activation of cellular antiviral and immune responses.
IMPORTANCE
A significant proportion of the world’
s population is infected with her-
pes simplex virus. Primary infection and subsequent recurrent reactivation can result in
diseases ranging from mild lesions to severe ocular or neurological damage. Herpesvi-
ruses are subject to epigenetic regulation that modulates viral gene expression, lytic rep-
lication, and latency-reactivation cycles. Thus, epigenetic pharmaceuticals have the po-
tential
to
alter
the
course
of
infection
and
disease.
Here,
while
the
histone
methyltransferases EZH2/1 are implicated in the suppression of herpesviruses, inhibitors
of these repressors unexpectedly suppress viral infection in vitro and in vivo by induction
of key components of cellular innate defense pathways. These inhibitors suppress infec-
tion by multiple viral pathogens, indicating their potential as broad-spectrum antivirals.

 neonatal infections can result in death, developmental delays, or persisting neurolog-
ical issues (1, 2). In addition to these pathologies, HSV-2 infection is linked to enhanced
acquisition and transmission of HIV (3–5).
The most widely utilized antiherpetic pharmaceuticals target the viral DNA poly-
merase to interfere with late-stage viral replication. However, drug-resistant strains
emerge (6, 7), particularly in immunocompromised individuals (8). Furthermore, these
compounds do not adequately control subclinical infectious viral shedding, which is
the most prevalent means of transmission.
Many DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, are subject to epigenetic regulation
where productive infection, persistence, and quiescence/latency are determined, in
part, by the modulation of chromatin associated with the viral genomes (9–14).
Epigenetic regulation is mediated by families of histone modification enzymes, adaptor
recognition proteins, and chromatin remodelers. Thus, components of the cellular
epigenetic machinery represent a plethora of novel therapeutic targets that can be
used to modulate the expression of specific gene sets and alter the course of disease.
Inhibitors of LSD1 and members of the JMJD2 family of histone H3K9 demethylases
have been shown to suppress HSV infection and reactivation from latency (15–18). In
a contrasting approach, histone deacetylase inhibitors have been components of some
strategies to induce HIV reactivation and deplete latent viral reservoirs (19–21).
More recently, inhibitors of the histone H3K27 methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1
(EZH2/1) have been developed as potential therapeutics for treating cancers with EZH2
gain-of-function mutations (22–30). As components of Polycomb repressive complex 2
(PRC2), EZH2/1 mediate gene repression primarily through propagation of H3K27me3,
which results in domains of nucleosomal compaction (31–33). However, these enzymes
also modulate genes whose promoters exhibit bivalent histone markers (H3K27me3
and H3K4me3) that enable the transition to either an active or a repressed state during
environmental signaling and differentiation (34, 35).
EZH2/1 PRC2 complexes have also been implicated in the regulation of the lytic-
latency cycles of multiple members of the herpesvirus family, including HSV (9, 12, 13,
36–43). Upon infection of permissive cells, the HSV genome is assembled into chro-
matin structures that initially exhibit both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 repressive histone
methylation signatures (10, 18, 40, 44, 45). Initiation of lytic infection requires the
recruitment of a cellular transcriptional coactivator complex (HCF-1) that contains
histone H3K9 demethylases (LSD1, JMJD2s) and histone H3K4 methyltransferases
(SETD1A, MLLs), which limits the accumulation of H3K9me3 and increases the levels of
active H3K4me3 to promote the transcription of viral immediate-early (IE) genes (17, 18,
46). Similarly, the levels of H3K27me3 associated with the viral genome decrease over
the course of productive infection in a manner dependent on IE protein ICP0 and viral
DNA replication (40). Importantly, both the H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 markers have
been associated with the establishment and maintenance of HSV latency in sensory
neurons (37, 39, 47, 48) Inhibition of either the HCF-1-associated H3K9 demethylases
or the UTX/JMJD3 H3K27 demethylases prevents productive viral reactivation (15–
18, 49, 50).
Here, in contrast to the anticipated suppressive role of EZH2/1, inhibition of these
histone methyltransferases results in reduced HSV gene expression and lytic infection
in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, inhibitors did not induce reactivation but rather
suppressed the spread of viral reactivation in a ganglion explant model. Investigation
of the mechanisms involved in the antiviral activities of these inhibitors revealed that
treatment induces multiple components of antipathogen pathways that result in an
enhanced cellular antiviral state. Importantly, the antiviral effects are not limited to HSV
but also extends to other representative nuclear DNA viruses (human cytomegalovirus
[hCMV], adenovirus 5 [Ad5]), as well as an unrelated RNA virus (Zika virus [ZIKV]).

bution of EZH2/1-catalyzed H3K27 methylation to suppression of viral gene expression
during lytic infection, primary human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells were pretreated
with the EZH2/1 catalytic inhibitors GSK126, GSK343, and UNC1999 (25, 26, 29) for 5 h
and infected with HSV-1 (Fig. 1A to D and F). Strikingly, in contrast to the anticipated
enhancement of viral gene expression, each compound suppressed viral IE gene
transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, treatment with astemizole, a
compound that interferes with the association of EZH2/1 with the chromatin binding
subunit of the PRC2 complex (EED, embryonic ectoderm development) (24), also
suppressed viral IE gene expression (Fig. 1A and E to F). Thus, suppression of HSV gene
expression was dependent on either inhibition of the catalytic activity of EZH2/1 or
prevention of the assembly of the PRC2 complex. Pretreatment of cells with GSK126 for

 1 h was sufficient to reduce viral IE expression, while recovery of suppressed viral IE
gene expression could be rescued within 6 to 12 h following washout of the com-
pounds (see Fig. S1A to C in the supplemental material).
To determine if EZH2/1 inhibitors would suppress viral lytic growth and spread, cells
were infected with HSV-1 for 8 h to allow one round of replication and subsequently
treated with the vehicle, GSK126, GSK343, or the viral DNA replication inhibitor acy-
clovir (ACV) for 12 h. As shown by immunofluorescent staining for the viral DNA
replication protein UL29/ICP8, treatment with each compound potently suppressed
productive viral spread from the initial infected cells (Fig. 1G) and decreased viral yields
by 2 to 3 logs (Fig. 1H).
EZH2/1 inhibitors reduce the number of transcriptionally active viral genomes.
Suppression of HSV-1 IE gene expression was not due to a block in the transport of viral
genomes to the nucleus and was relatively independent of the multiplicity of infection
(MOI) (Fig. S1D and E). However, the suppression of viral IE gene expression suggested
that EZH2/1 inhibitors acted at an early stage of infection. Therefore, cells were treated
with the vehicle, GSK126, or UNC1999; infected with HSV-1 for 1.5 h; and stained for a
marker of active HSV-1 transcriptional foci (ICP4). As shown in Fig. 2A to D, treatment
with either drug reduced the number of transcriptionally active viral genomes per cell.
Suppression of IE transcription was further supported by chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion (ChIP) assays, which demonstrated a reduction in the levels of the IE coactivator
HCF-1, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and the euchromatic marker H3K4me3 associated
with the viral IE-ICP0 promoter (Fig. 2E). In contrast, no significant change in occupancy
of the control cellular glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter
was evident. Therefore, in stark contrast to the anticipated effect, inhibition of EZH2/1

 resulted in reduced IE gene expression, decreased numbers of transcriptionally acces-
sible viral genomes, and suppression of lytic infection.
EZH2/1 inhibitors induce a cellular antiviral state. These data suggested that
EZH2/1 inhibitors might induce an antiviral state that results in suppression of the viral
genome. In support of this, the number of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) foci, a marker
of stress- and pathogen-induced cellular responses (51), was higher in GSK126- and
UNC1999-treated cells than in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3A and B). Furthermore,
interferon-alpha (IFN-�) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) mRNAs were significantly upregulated
in GSK126-treated cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that EZH2/1 inhibitors might mediate viral
repression via IFN/immune signaling-related pathways. To directly address this, the
mRNA levels of a selection of IFNs/IFN receptors were measured in GSK126-treated cells
with a quantitative PCR (qPCR) Profiler array (Fig. 3D; Table S1A). Compared to vehicle,
treatment of cells with GSK126 enhanced the levels of nine genes (�1.5-fold; P � 0.05),
including those encoding IL-6, the IL-6 receptor, IFN-�1, and IFN-�2.
Global differentials in gene expression were next assessed by microarray analyses of
HFF cells treated for 4 h with GSK126 or GSK343 (Table S1B). Among the most
significantly induced transcripts in both GSK126- and GSK343-treated cells were those
encoding transcription factors, regulatory proteins, and components of immune sig-
naling and cellular stress response (oxidative and unfolded protein response [UPR])
pathways. Strikingly, ISGs (IFN-stimulated genes) were clearly overrepresented in the
genes modulated by GSK126 or GSK343 (GSK126, 158 [59.0%] of 268 genes; GSK343, 95
[70.9%] of 134 genes), as indicated by overlap with the Interferome database (52)
(Fig. 3E; Table S1B). Furthermore, of the 87 genes differentially regulated by both
inhibitors, 61 (71.1%) were ISGs. Ingenuity pathway analyses (IPAs) of the differentially
regulated genes (Fig. S2A and B; Table S1B) supports the induction of proinflammatory
and stress response pathways in both GSK126- and GSK343-treated cells.
As shown in Fig. 3F and Table S1B, enriched pathways identified by IPA were
grouped into six supercategories that illustrate the modulation of immune signaling
and cellular antiviral pathways in inhibitor-treated cells. A subset of the genes induced
in the qPCR arrays and microarrays could be further organized into a functional
network. In this network, IFNs (IFNA1/2, IFNAR1), inflammatory cytokines and mediators
(IL-6, IL-8, PTGS2), and transcription factors that induce the expression of inflammatory
and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response factors (CEBPB, Fos, ATF4, DDIT3) are
nodes with functional relationships (STRING [53]) that illustrate the modulation of a
broad spectrum of antipathogen pathways by EZH2/1 inhibitors (Fig. 3G). These results
are consistent with previous observations in cancer cell lines that depletion of SUZ12,
a subunit of the EZH2/1-PRC2 complex, resulted in the expression of a class of ISGs
whose promoters exhibited bivalent (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) histone methylation
markers (54). The results are also complemented by analyses of data sets (GEO data set
GSE81267) published by Qi et al. (28) where treatment of Karpas422 cancer cells with
a novel inhibitor targeting the PRC2 subunit EED (EED226) induced antipathogen gene
cascades that parallel the inflammatory and stress pathways shown here (Fig. S2C and
D; Table S1C). Thus, inhibition of EZH2/1 results in the differential regulation of ISGs and
components of cellular defense pathways in a manner dependent on EZH2/1 catalytic
activity and PRC2 complex integrity.
To define the kinetics, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses were per-
formed with cells treated with GSK126 for 1, 2, or 5 h (Table S1D). Strikingly, the results
support the induction of antipathogen response pathways by 2 h, with significant
enhancement of these pathways by 5 h (Fig. 3H; Fig. S2E and Table S1D). Components
induced by 2 h formed a functional network enriched in signaling molecules (IL-6,
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 [MAP3K8], SGK1/3) and transcription
factors (Fos, CEBPB/CEBPD, DDIT3, NR4A1/2, ATF3) that are regulators of antiviral and
stress response pathways (Fig. 3I). Importantly, although EZH2/1 inhibitors induced IFNs
and ISGs, GSK126 treatment of cells lacking the type 1 IFN receptor (IFNAR1�/�) still
prevented the spread of HSV infection (Fig. S3). Thus, suppression is mediated in a

 manner that does not require IFNAR1 signaling. The induction of transcription factors

 EZH2/1 inhibition suppresses the infection of multiple viral pathogens. On the
basis of the regulation of multiple antiviral components and pathways by EZH2/1
inhibitors, it was hypothesized that these compounds would function as broad-
spectrum antiviral inhibitors. Indeed, GSK126 and GSK343 both suppressed the IE gene
expression of two other nuclear DNA viruses, Ad5 and hCMV (Fig. S4). To determine if
these inhibitors would suppress an RNA virus with a distinct life cycle, HFF cells were
treated with GSK126 and infected with ZIKV, a member of the Flavivirus family. As
shown in Fig. 4A to C, GSK126 significantly reduced both the number and size of ZIKV
focus-forming units (FFU; plaques) in a dose-dependent manner. These results were
further supported by a GSK126-meditated reduction in the number of ZIKV-infected
cells at 1 and 2 days postinfection (dpi), as measured by intracellular staining for ZIKV
antigens (Fig. 4D). Finally, while pretreatment was modestly more efficient at suppres-
sion of infection at lower GSK126 concentrations, it was clearly not essential to effect
significant suppression (Fig. 4E).
EZH2/1 inhibitors suppress primary HSV infection and enhance the recruitment
of immune cells to the site of infection in vivo. Given the suppression of HSV-1 gene
expression and lytic infection in culture, as well as the regulation of antiviral signaling,
the impact of EZH2/1 inhibitors on HSV-1 ocular and intranasal infections was assessed
in vivo. BALB/c mice were infected via the ocular route and treated topically with the
vehicle, the viral DNA replication inhibitor ACV, or EZH2/1 inhibitors for 7 dpi. As shown
in Fig. 5A, GSK126 or UNC1999 treatment significantly reduced the progression of
infection, as measured by ocular viral yields (infectious virus titers) and viral DNA loads.
Suppression of ocular infection by topical GSK126 treatment was evident as early as 3
dpi, with a significant decrease in the infectious virus titer per eye at 5 dpi (Fig. 5B). In
mice infected via the intranasal route, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of GSK126 also
significantly reduced viral loads in nasal tissues (Fig. 5C).
EZH2/1 inhibitor treatment resulted in the induction of antiviral signaling pathways
in vitro and the suppression of primary infection in vivo. To characterize drug-induced
changes in cellular immunity, neutrophil recruitment to the site of HSV infection was
assessed. Neutrophils are typically the first immune cells to migrate into infected
tissues, and neutropenic individuals suffer from recurrent HSV infections. Mice were

 mock infected or infected with HSV-1 via the ocular route and treated topically with
GSK126, ACV, or the vehicle for 7 days. Ocular sections were costained to detect
HSV-1-infected cells and neutrophils. Strikingly, while neutrophils were modestly re-
cruited in the vehicle- or ACV-treated mice, treatment with GSK126 resulted in a clear
increase in these cells within the cornea, iris, and anterior chamber of the infected eyes
(Fig. 5D; Fig. S5). Importantly, enhanced neutrophil recruitment was dependent on viral
infection and was not evident in mock-infected mice.
Reduction in HSV-1 reactivation-spread correlates with stimulation of immune
signaling pathways in mouse ganglia. Explantation of latently HSV-1-infected sen-
sory ganglia into culture promotes induction of viral reactivation. To determine if
EZH2/1 inhibitors would suppress reactivation, ganglia from latently infected mice were
explanted in the presence of the vehicle, ACV, or EZH2/1 inhibitors for 48 h. GSK126,
GSK343, and astemizole each reduced viral yields, as measured by infectious titers and
viral DNA loads (Fig. 6A; Fig. S6A).
Reduced viral yields can result from suppression of the initial primary reactivation
events and/or suppression of the spread of reactivated virus in the ganglia. To discrim-

 inate between these, latently infected ganglia were explanted in the presence of the
vehicle, ACV, GSK126, or GSK343 for 48 h and sections were stained for the viral lytic
replication protein UL29 (ICP8) (Fig. 6B to D). Ganglia explanted in the presence of the
viral DNA replication inhibitor ACV served as comparative controls, as this compound
does not suppress the primary reactivation events (single UL29� cells) but blocks viral
replication and spread from the initiating neuron (clusters of UL29� cells). As shown in
Fig. 6C and D, slightly lower numbers of individual/single UL29� neurons (primary
reactivation events) were seen in the presence of GSK126 (7.7/ganglion) and GSK343
(7.6/ganglion) than in the presence of ACV (10.7/ganglion). However, the primary
impact of these compounds was clearly in reducing the spread of the infection from the
initiating neurons to adjacent cells (clusters) in a manner comparable to that of ACV.
As shown during lytic infection of cultured HFF cells, suppression of viral
reactivation-spread in ganglion explants was likely to be due to EZH2/1 inhibitor
modulation of antiviral signaling. This was confirmed by RNA-Seq analyses of genes
differentially regulated in mock-infected and HSV-1-infected ganglia explanted for 12 h
in the presence of GSK126 relative to the vehicle (Table S1E). In mock-infected ganglia,
GSK126 treatment induced 13 ISGs, including that for CXCL1, while 24 ISGs, including
those for CXCL1-3, CXCL5, CSF2-3, CCL2, LIF, IL-11, and IL-6, were induced in HSV-1-
infected ganglia (Fig. S6B; Table S1E). Thus, analogous to the enhanced recruitment of
neutrophils by GSK126 in HSV-infected eyes relative to that in mock-infected eyes
(Fig. 5D; Fig. S6), the stimulation of these antiviral pathways is also enhanced in
HSV-infected ganglia compared to that in mock-infected ganglia.
Pathway, Interferome, and STRING analyses clearly illustrate the induction of proin-
flammatory and immune cell recruitment pathways by GSK126 (Fig. 6E and F; Fig. S6C

PTGS2, MMP3, and LIF was common to both the HFF and ganglion RNA-Seq data sets
(Table S1D and E), a more extensive set of chemokines (CXCL5, CCL2, CXCL3), adhesion
molecules (SELP, ICAMI, SELE), and factors required for hematopoiesis and maturation
(CSF2, CSF3) was induced in the ganglion tissue. It is likely that this differential stems
from the more diverse cell population, including resident immune cells, in the infected
ganglia in vivo relative to the clonal nature of the HFF cultures. Furthermore, the
induction of the neutrophil chemotactic factors CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5 is
consistent with the robust recruitment of these cells to the sites of ocular HSV-1
infection (Fig. 5D; Fig. S5).
DISCUSSION
Small-molecule compounds targeting components of the epigenetic machinery
hold significant promise as novel approaches to control diseases ranging from malig-
nancies and developmental disorders to acute or chronic viral infections. Recently,
inhibitors of the histone H3K27 methyltransferases EZH2/1 have been developed on the
basis of the potential to treat some diffuse large B-cell, follicular, and non-Hodgkin’
s
lymphomas (23, 55–57). Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of EZH2/1 has shown
promising results in tumor regression in cancer cell lines, mouse tumor xenograft
models, and human phase I trials (7, 23, 25–30, 58).
Many viruses, including herpesviruses, are subject to regulation by the cellular
epigenetic machinery. EZH2/1 complexes have been linked to the control of lytic and
latency stages of multiple herpesviruses, including HSV, Kaposi’
s sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and hCMV, where these complexes and the associated
H3K27me3 marks repress viral lytic gene expression. For HSV, both the H3K9me3 and
H3K27me3 heterochromatic markers are associated with the genome upon lytic infec-
tion and likely represent an initial host cell antiviral response. Similarly, in sensory
neurons, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks and PRC complex subunits are associated
with the latent HSV-1 genome and have been hypothesized to play a role in the
establishment and/or maintenance of latency.
Specific epigenetic inhibitors can modulate HSV lytic infection, latency, and reacti-
vation. Inhibitors of the histone H3K9 demethylases (LSD1, JMJD2) block initiation of
HSV infection, while inhibitors of the H3K9 and H3K27 demethylases (UTX/JMJD3) block
reactivation from latency. Most strikingly, inhibition of LSD1 in vivo enhances epige-
netic repression of the latent HSV genomes, which correlates with a reduction of
reactivation and viral shedding (15). Here, treatment of primary cells with EZH2/1
inhibitors suppressed HSV gene expression, decreased the spread of the infection to
adjacent cells, and blocked the spread of viral reactivation in latently infected sensory
ganglia. In vivo, EZH2/1 inhibitors suppressed primary HSV infection and enhanced
immune cell infiltration at the site of infection. Thus, despite the fact that the PRC2
complex plays roles in the suppression of HSV lytic gene expression and the promo-
tion of latency, the data presented here support a role for EZH2/1 inhibitors in the
induction of an antiviral state that is clearly dominant over the loss of any direct PRC2
suppression of the HSV genome.
Treatment of primary cultured cells with EZH2/1 inhibitors induced the expression
of regulators and components of pathways encompassing inflammation, IFN signaling,
oxidative stress, and the ER-UPR. These included IFNs and IFN receptors (i.e., IFNA1/2,
IFNE, IFNAR1), transcription factors (i.e., Fos, JunD, NF-�B [NF-�B1, NFKBIZ], NR4A1 to -3,
CEBPB, CEBPD, ATF3) that modulate the expression of immune and inflammatory
components, and kinases/signaling molecules (i.e., MAP3K8, IRAK2, IER3, SGK1/3) that
amplify the host cell response to infection. Ultimately, the induction of cytokines/
chemokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-8 [CXCL1/2], CSF2, CSF3, IL-11, CXCL3, CXCL5, CCL2) correlates
with clearance of infection in vivo.
Collectively, the genes induced by these inhibitors compose a multifaceted antiviral
state where 40.6 to 70.9% of the differentially regulated genes are ISGs. Furthermore,
in addition to HSV, EZH2/1 inhibitors suppressed infection with other nuclear DNA

 viruses (hCMV, adenovirus), as well as ZIKV, a member of the Flavivirus family. Thus,
EZH2/1 complexes are clearly critical modulators of cellular antipathogen defense
pathways. It is, however, important to note that in addition to those factors involved in
the stimulation of immune or antipathogen responses, EZH2/1 inhibitor treatment also
resulted in the induction of genes that are involved in feedback pathways that limit
excessive stress and inflammatory signaling through dampening of receptor signaling
(i.e., SOCS2, IL-1RN, DUSP1), transcriptional repression (i.e., ATF3, MAFG), destabilization
of AU-containing mRNAs encoding inflammatory proteins (i.e., ZFP36), and processing
of reactive oxygen species (i.e., OXR1).
Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to circumvent cellular antiviral strategies
and IFN responses. However, the pathogens tested here do not efficiently escape the
multiple ISGs and antiviral pathways induced by EZH2/1 inhibitors. Furthermore, while
the EZH2/1-PRC2 complex plays roles in the repression of herpesviruses, the impacts of
EZH2/1 inhibitors in vivo are more complex and include the induced recruitment of
antiviral immune cell populations. Importantly, the impacts of EZH2/1 inhibitors in vivo
were clearly enhanced in infected tissues and animals relative to those in uninfected
controls. Thus, these inhibitors amplify cellular antiviral responses and contribute to the
induction of immune cell responses in a context-dependent manner. The results are
analogous to the synergistic/enhanced induction of ISGs in cells treated with both
EZH2/1 inhibitors and IFN-�, lipopolysaccharide, IL-1�, or tumor necrosis factor alpha
relative to treatment with each compound alone (54).
Immune surveillance in latently infected sensory ganglia contributes to the sup-
pression of HSV reactivation (59–63). Resident T cells and delivery of IFNs to neurons
undergoing viral reactivation repress lytic induction while also preserving neuronal
survival. In explanted ganglia, EZH2/1 inhibitors suppressed productive reactivation
and spread of HSV from the initiating neurons. Thus, while speculative, it is possible
that immune suppression responses could be enhanced by compounds such as EZH2/1
inhibitors, resulting in a decrease in productive clinical reactivation and viral shedding.
Strikingly, although PRC2 components repress herpesvirus gene expression, the
induction of antiviral pathways by EZH2/1 inhibitors clearly drives immune-mediated
suppression of viral infection. Thus, in addition to their antioncogenic potential, EZH2/1
inhibitors may have a role as general antivirals for short-term enhancement of viral
clearance, for suppression of persistent infections and drug-resistant mutants, or as
enhancers of immune responses where no specific pharmaceutical antiviral is available.
PRC2 epigenetic inhibitors currently in clinical trial for cancer therapy may provide an
initial therapeutic resource for new or emerging pathogens (e.g., ZIKV).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and viral infections. Telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized HFF, MRC-5, and Vero cells
were maintained in accordance with standard procedures. Fibroblast cultures were derived from TAC73
(IFNAR1�/�) and control C57BL/6J mice. HSV-1 (F and 17), hCMV (Towne), and Ad5 infections were done
in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (DMEM) containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 1 h at 37°
C.
ZIKV (H/PF/2013) infections were done in Opti-MEM containing 2% FBS for 4 h at 37°
C.
Inhibitor treatment. Cells were pretreated with GSK126 (30 �M), GSK343 (35 �M), UNC1999 (15 �M),
astemizole (30 �M), ACV (100 �M), or the vehicle for 4 to 5 h unless specified otherwise in the
appropriate figure legend. Viral adsorption was done in the absence of an inhibitor but included
postadsorption for the times indicated. The inhibitors used and their sources are listed in Text S1.
Viral yields. Viral DNA levels in genomic DNA from HFF cells and mouse tissues were determined by
qPCR, and samples were normalized on the basis of the levels of the cellular GAPDH gene. The sequences
of the primer sets used are listed in Text S1. Viral titers were determined from homogenates of mouse
tissues or HFF cells.
Reverse transcription-qPCR and qPCR. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (Isolate II RNA minikit;
Bioline) with a qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences) or a Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis
kit (Thermo Scientific). For ganglia, tissues were first homogenized in TriPure Reagent (Roche catalog no.
11667165001) with Lysing Matrix D (MP Biomedicals catalog no. 6913-100) and a FastPrep-24 Instrument
(MP Biomedicals). DNAs or cDNAs were quantitated in triplicate by qPCR with SYBR green master mix
(Roche) and a Mastercycler ep realplex4 (Eppendorf; Realplex 2.2v software) or a QuantStudio 3 (Applied
Biosystems; QuantStudio 1.4v software). The sequences of the primer sets used are listed in Text S1.
qPCR arrays, microarrays, and RNA-Seq. Total RNAs from mouse ganglia or HFF cells were isolated
with an Isolate II RNA minikit (Bioline) as noted above. RNA quality (an RNA integrity number of �8.5)
was verified by Bioanalyzer for all qPCR array, microarray, and RNA-Seq samples. Differentials in the

 expression of genes for IFNs and IFN receptors were determined with RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays (Qiagen
catalog no. PAHS-064ZA) (three independent experiments). Microarrays were completed with Illumina
Human HT-12 v4.0 Expression BeadChip as detailed in Text S1. RNA-Seq analyses (HiSeq2000/2500
system; Illumina) of libraries (TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero; Illumina) from three indepen-
dent replicates were done as described in Text S1. Statistical analyses of microarray and RNA-Seq data
are described in Text S1.
Western blot assays. Western blot assays of resolved nuclear protein extracts were done with the
antibodies listed in Text S1. Blots were visualized with WesternBright Quantum (Advansta) and quanti-
tated with a G:BOX Chemi XT4 (Syngene; GeneTools 4.03.02.0v software).
ChIP assays. ChIP assays were done as described in detail in Text S1.
Animals and infections. (i) Trigeminal ganglion explants. BALB/c mice were infected with 5 � 105
PFU of HSV-1 (strain F) via the ocular route as previously described (64). Latently infected trigeminal
ganglia were harvested 30 to 45 days after clearance of the primary infection. Trigeminal ganglia were
bisected, and paired halves were explanted in medium with the vehicle and inhibitors for 48 h.
(ii) Primary ocular and intranasal HSV infections. BALB/c mice were infected with 2 � 105 PFU of
HSV-1 (strain F)/eye. The vehicle, ACV (30 to 100 �M), and EZH2/1 inhibitors (GSK126, 30 to 60 �M;
UNC1999, 15 �M) were applied topically to the surface of the eye twice daily beginning at 12 h
postinfection (hpi). Eyes were harvested on the days postinfection indicated to obtain viral yields and
tissue sections. Mice were infected intranasally with 5 � 105 PFU of HSV-1 (strain F) and treated i.p. with
the vehicle, ACV (50 mg/kg) or GSK126 (50 mg/kg) beginning 1 day prior to infection. Viral yields from
nasal tissue were determined at 7 dpi. Animal care and handling were done in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Guidelines and as approved by the NIAID Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining with the antibodies listed in
Text S1 was done in accordance with standard protocols. Cells were visualized with a Leica TCS SP5
confocal microscope with LASAF software (version 2.6.0). Deconvolution was completed with Huygens
Essential (Scientific Volume Imaging, 15.10.1P6v), and sequential z sections were assembled with Imaris
software (Bitplane AG, 8.1.2v).
Ganglion and ocular immunohistochemical staining. Latently HSV-1-infected trigeminal ganglia
were explanted for 48 h into DMEM--10% FBS in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Explanted ganglia
or primary infected eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)--phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with the antibodies listed in Text S1 as previously described
(64). Sequential z-stack images were collected with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.
ZIKV FFU assay. Following treatment with the vehicle or EZH2/1 inhibitors, HFF cells were infected
with ZIKV (100 FFU/2 � 104 cells) and overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in Opti-MEM containing 2% FBS.
Cells were fixed at 40 hpi with 1% PFA--PBS and stained with pan-Flavivirus monoclonal antibody (MAb)
E60. Infected foci were quantitated and scored by size with an ImmunoSpot Macroanalyzer (Cellular
Technologies, ImmunoCapture v.6.5.7).
ZIKV intracellular staining assay. Vehicle- or EZH2/1 inhibitor-treated HFF cells were infected with
ZIKV (30,000 FFU/2.2 � 105 cells) for 40 h. Cells were fixed in Fix/Perm Solution (BD Biosciences) and
stained with anti-ZIKV antibody ZV67. The percentage of infected cells was determined by flow
cytometry.
Statistical analyses. Data are presented as means � the standard error of the mean (SEM). Where
appropriate, statistical analyses (Prism 7.0) included analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’
s post hoc
test for multiple comparisons, two-tailed t tests for individual comparisons, and Wilcoxon matched-pair
signed-rank tests for comparisons of paired vehicle- and compound-treated ganglia. Details are pre-
sented in Table S2.
