Summary
Air pollution is the world’s largest single environmen-
tal health risk (WHO). Particulate matter such as
black carbon is one of the main components of air
pollution. The effects of particulate matter on human
health are well established however the effects on
bacteria, organisms central to ecosystems in humans
and in the natural environment, are poorly under-
stood. We report here for the first time that black
carbon drastically changes the development of bacte-
rial biofilms, key aspects of bacterial colonisation
and survival. Our data show that exposure to black
carbon induces structural, compositional and func-
tional changes in the biofilms of both S. pneumoniae
and S. aureus. Importantly, the tolerance of the bio-
films
to
multiple
antibiotics
and
proteolytic
degradation is significantly affected. Additionally, our
results show that black carbon impacts bacterial col-
onisation
in
vivo.
In
a
mouse
nasopharyngeal
colonisation model, black carbon caused S. pneumo-
niae to spread from the nasopharynx to the lungs,
which is essential for subsequent infection. There-
fore our study highlights that air pollution has a
significant effect on bacteria that has been largely
overlooked. Consequently these findings have impor-
tant
implications
concerning
the
impact
of
air
pollution on human health and bacterial ecosystems
worldwide.
Introduction
Particulate matter (PM), a major component of air pollution
(Kelly and Fussell, 2011; Kelly and Fussell, 2012), has a
detrimental impact on both human and environmental
health (Janssen et al., 2012; Kelly and Fussell, 2012; Thur-
ston and Lippmann, 2015; Xu et al., 2016). Current WHO
guidelines set limits for both the 24-hour and annual mean
concentrations of different size fractions of PM. PM10, that
is, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less
than 10 mm, should be kept below a 20 mg/m3 annual
mean, and a 50 mg/m3 24-hour mean. Stricter limits are set
for PM2.5 as this size fraction is associated with more dam-
aging health effects, and should be kept below an annual
mean of 10 mg/m3, and 25 mg/m3 over a 24 hour period.
However despite WHO and EU legislation to reduce air
pollution, PM levels exceed these recommended guide-
lines (WHO, 2006; 2016), particularly in industrialised
regions (Janssen et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014).
PM and other air pollutants spread in the atmosphere
and cross national boundaries, settling on plants and soils,
as well as contaminating fresh and marine water (Forbes
et al., 2006; Cattaneo et al., 2010). PM therefore has the
potential to affect multiple essential ecosystems globally,
as well as having a known major impact on human health
and morbidity. PM exposure causes increased respiratory
and cardiovascular disease (Faustini et al., 2012; Shah
et al., 2015; Thurston and Lippmann, 2015; Costello et al.,
2016), and are strongly associated with increased acute
respiratory infections, including pneumonia (Brugha and
Grigg, 2014; MacIntyre, 2014; Qiu et al., 2014; Chang
et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016). Indeed, air pollution is
responsible for an eighth of all global deaths per year
(WHO, 2014).

 Many studies have shown that inhalation of PM causes
host tissue damage, inflammation, oxidative stress and
alteration in cardiovascular functioning, as well as signifi-
cantly impacting the immune response by impairing
macrophage function (Host et al., 2007; Lundborg et al.,
2007; Kelly and Fussell, 2011; 2012; Heal et al., 2012;
Rylance et al., 2015). However, these host-focused studies
do not fully account for all the observations of PM-related
diseases in humans. Importantly, there is a major omission
in our understanding of the impact of PM because there
have been no studies on the direct impact of PM on the
behaviour of bacteria. This is surprising considering that
bacteria are directly responsible for respiratory infections,
and play a key role in the diversity and functioning of the
normal microbiome, which is crucial for maintaining the
health of the host. Therefore it is essential to further under-
stand the role bacteria play in the detrimental impacts of
air pollution.
A major component of PM is black carbon (BC), a by-
product of fossil fuel combustion. In developed countries
diesel exhaust fumes are the major source of BC, whereas
in the developing world BC mostly arises from indoor burn-
ing of biomass for heat and fuel. BC is a chemically and
biologically active pollutant that can generate oxidative
stress, induce inflammation, and be mutagenic (Janssen
et al., 2012; Butterfield et al., 2015). In 2014, black carbon
(BC), a major component of PM, levels ranged from 1 to 7
mg/m3 across the UK, and the country-wide average was
1.6 mg/m3 (Butterfield et al., 2015). In general, higher con-
centrations were recorded at the roadside in comparison
to other urban environments. However, Europe and North
America only account for about 13% of global BC emis-
sions, whereas developing countries are responsible for
�80%, with the biggest global contributors to BC being
China and India (USEPA, 2012; Ni et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2014). BC exposure is strongly implicated in predis-
position
to
respiratory
infectious
disease,
which
is
particularly damaging to children under 5 years old (Jans-
sen et al., 2012; Brugha and Grigg, 2014).
To address whether bacteria are an unexplained mecha-
nism for BC induced morbidity, we investigated the impact
of BC on two model bacterial species; Streptococcus
pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Both are impor-
tant respiratory tract commensals intermittently carried by
a large section of the population without signs of disease
as part of the normal microbiome. However they are also
globally important human pathogens; S. pneumoniae is
the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia, and S. aureus is
a significant cause of respiratory and skin and tissue dis-
ease (Wertheim et al., 2005; Edwards et al., 2012; Shak
et al., 2013).
We report here that BC significantly affects the behavior
of S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. Our data show that BC
impacts biofilm formation, an essential aspect of bacterial
colonisation and environmental survival. Exposure to BC
induced significant changes in S. pneumoniae and S. aure-
us biofilm structure, composition and function. Importantly,
BC differentially altered the tolerance of biofilms to proteo-
lytic degradation and multiple antibiotics, increasing S.
pneumoniae survival against penicillin, the front line treat-
ment of bacterial pneumonia. Furthermore this work
shows that BC does indeed impact bacterial colonization
in vivo. In a murine colonisation model, black carbon
induced S. pneumoniae to spread from the nasopharynx
to the lungs, which is a prerequisite for invasive disease in
a susceptible host. Therefore, if extrapolated these data
show, for the first time, that air pollution could have a signif-
icant effect on human bacterial infection that has been
largely overlooked.
Results
Black carbon alters S. pneumoniae and S. aureus
biofilm structure
To investigate our hypothesis that air pollution alters bacte-
rial
colonisation
and
hence
impacts
environmental
survival, the impact of black carbon on biofilm formation
was determined. Bacteria within biofilms are highly pro-
tected against environmental stresses; including metals,
protease degradation, the host immune response and anti-
biotics (Domenech et al., 2012; Marks et al., 2012; De la
Fuente-Nunez et al., 2013; Nicholson et al., 2013). There-
fore, biofilms are an important facet of colonisation and
can act as a reservoir for infection, dispersing bacteria to
spread to other sites (Marks et al., 2013).
To investigate the impact of BC on bacterial biofilms, S.
pneumoniae strains D39 and PR201, and S. aureus strains
SH1000, Newman, and USA300, were exposed to 30–100
mg/ml BC during biofilm formation. BC concentrations were
based on previous research into the effects of BC on the
host, as well as research into the effects of other pollutants
on bacteria (Tellabati et al., 2010; Vesterdal et al., 2012;
Suraju et al., 2015). These concentrations do not represent
actual atmospheric BC concentrations in the UK which
range from 1 to 7 mg/m3 (Butterfield et al., 2015) because
atmospheric BC is inhaled over time, with constant deposi-
tion
within
the
respiratory
tract,
therefore
high
concentration suspensions are typically used to model this
long-term exposure. Both encapsulated (D39) and non-
capsulated (PR201) pneumococci were used to determine
if the presence of a capsule altered the response to BC. In
addition, encapsulated S. pneumoniae form poor biofilms
in vitro therefore investigations using advanced imaging
could only be completed with the closely-related non-cap-
sulated isolate. The impact on biofilm formation was
assessed by advanced microscopy and by enumeration of
viable biofilm and planktonic bacteria, as well as those
cells loosely adhered to the biofilm. Interestingly, the data

 show that BC drastically alters bacterial biofilm formation
(Figs 1 and 2) and notably, a striking and differential impact
was observed between the biofilm structures of S. pneu-
moniae and S. aureus.
BC caused a dramatic alteration in the architecture of
non-capsulated S. pneumoniae PR201 biofilms, resulting
in a structure with complex protrusions and channels (Fig.
1b and d). This is in contrast to S. pneumoniae biofilms
formed in the absence of BC, which were relatively flat
structures with a low surface area, limiting environmental
contact (Fig. 1a and c). BC-induced biofilms were also
found to be significantly thicker and more irregular than
control biofilms (Fig. 1e–g, p � 0.01). TEM showed that the
pneumococcal cells within the biofilm were closely associ-
ated with the BC particles (Supporting Information Fig.
S1a and b), a feature also observed by SEM (Fig. 1b and
d). This proximity to the BC had no obvious impact on the
S. pneumoniae cell shape, but in the presence of BC there
appeared to be a higher proportion of dividing cells and
fewer ‘ghost’ dead cells, correlating with an increase in the
number of viable S. pneumoniae found in the biofilm (Fig.
1h); although BC had no significant effect on total cell via-
bility of either S. pneumoniae strain investigated.
The BC-induced complex architecture and increased
thickness of the biofilm did not affect biofilm integrity
because there was no change in the proportion of loosely
associated and planktonic S. pneumoniae cells compared
with biofilm cells. This was true for encapsulated and non-
capsulated S. pneumoniae (Fig. 1h and i). Interestingly, S.
pneumoniae biofilms formed in the presence of quartz, a
particle of similar size to BC but chemically inert, did not
induce any changes in biofilm structure (Supporting Infor-
mation Fig. S2c and d). This shows that the effect of BC
on biofilm formation is not merely due to the physical pres-
ence of exogenous particles acting as a scaffold for the
biofilm rather it demonstrates that BC induces a biological
effect on the bacteria.
BC also altered S. aureus biofilm formation, but different
effects were observed. Similar to S. pneumoniae, BC sig-
nificantly increased the average thickness of S. aureus
biofilms (Fig. 2e–g; p � 0.001; Supporting Information Fig.
S3e–g; p � 0.001). Additionally, the biofilm structure was
altered in that BC induced development of bulky masses
that protruded from the normally smooth surface of the bio-
films, although the structure observed was not as complex
as that of S. pneumoniae BC-biofilms (Fig. 2b, d, f, and g,
Supporting Information Fig. S3b, d and f, and S4b and d).
In contrast to S. pneumoniae, BC exposure altered the
integrity of the S. aureus biofilm. In the absence of BC, S.
aureus biofilms were formed with only a small proportion of
the total number of cells loosely-adhered to the biofilm
(Fig. 2h; Supporting Information Fig. S3h and S4e). In the
presence of BC, however, there was a significant decrease
in the number of biofilm cells (Fig. 2h; p � 0.0001,
Supporting Information Fig. S3h p � 0.0001), and a signifi-
cant increase in the loosely associated cells (Fig. 2h;
p � 0.001), showing that biofilm structural integrity had
been altered.
Unexpectedly, unlike S. pneumoniae, BC was found to
be detrimental to S. aureus strains SH1000 and Newman,
because exposure to BC significantly decreased (p � 0.05)
the total number of viable S. aureus cells compared with
the control (Fig. 2h, Supporting Information Fig. S3h).
Interestingly however, BC did not significantly affect the
viability of the methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain
USA300 (Supporting Information Fig. S4e), demonstrating
that the effect of BC differs between S. aureus strains.
TEM analysis did not reveal any significant effect of BC on
the structure of the S. aureus cells (Supporting Information
Fig. S1c–f). Together our data show that BC changes bac-
terial
biofilm
formation and
structure by
two
model
bacteria, but importantly, there is intra- and inter-species
variation in the impact of BC.
Black carbon induces changes in proteolytic degradation
of the biofilm
To investigate whether BC affects biofilm function, the bio-
films were treated with proteinase K to determine the
impact on the tolerance to proteolytic degradation (Nichol-
son et al., 2013). Non-BC exposed biofilms of S. aureus
Newman and S. aureus USA300 were significantly dis-
rupted by treatment with proteinase K, showing that these
biofilms are mainly proteinaceous in composition (Table 1
p �; 0.01). In contrast, S. aureus SH1000 and the S. pneu-
moniae PR201 control biofilms were not significantly
disrupted by proteinase K treatment, suggesting that these
biofilms contained less protein (Table 1).
Interestingly BC exposure altered the sensitivity of all
biofilms to proteinase K. BC-biofilms of S. aureus Newman
and USA300 became less sensitive to proteinase K degra-
dation,
whereas
the
S.
aureus
SH1000
and
S.
pneumoniae BC-exposed biofilms became considerably
more degraded by proteinase K (Table 1). These results
suggest that BC has a notable effect on the protein compo-
nent of the biofilms, reducing protein content of the S.
aureus Newman and USA300 biofilms but increasing that
of S. aureus SH1000 and S. pneumoniae.
Black carbon alters the tolerance of biofilms to multiple
antibiotics
Bacterial biofilms are known to be highly resistant to antibi-
otics therefore the effect of BC on tolerance of the biofilms
to antibiotics was assessed. Preformed biofilms grown in
the presence or absence of 100 mg/ml BC were washed
and incubated with or without antibiotics in growth medium
for 3 h. 100 mg/ml BC results in major structural changes

 and therefore this concentration is optimal to test if BC
induces functional changes. After incubation, bacterial via-
bility was assessed. The percentage survival of bacteria
exposed to antibiotics, compared with non-exposed con-
trols, was then calculated. S. aureus and S. pneumoniae
were exposed to the b-lactams oxacillin and penicillin G,
respectively, which inhibit cell wall synthesis. S. aureus bio-
films were also exposed to daptomycin, a lipopeptide
which disrupts the cell membrane, and tetracycline, which
inhibits intracellular protein synthesis.
It is noteworthy that the concentration of each antibiotic
required to markedly reduce the viability of bacteria within
control S. aureus biofilms was considerably higher than
the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed for
planktonic bacteria (Fig. 3). Planktonic S. aureus cells are
sensitive to �2 lg/ml oxacillin, 1 lg/ml daptomycin, and
2 lg/ml tetracycline (EUCAST, 2015), whereas 50 mg/ml
oxacillin, 256 lg/ml daptomycin and 512 lg/ml tetracycline
were required to reduce the viability of S. aureus biofilms.
None of these antibiotic concentrations resulted in total
bacterial eradication in control biofilms, clearly demonstrat-
ing
that
biofilms
have
increased
antibiotic
tolerance
compared with planktonic cells.
Our data show that BC has a differential effect on bacte-
rial biofilm tolerance to antibiotics irrespective of the mode
of action. S. aureus Newman and the MRSA USA300 bio-
films formed in the presence of BC showed significant
decreases in tolerance to oxacillin (Fig. 3d; p 5 0.03 and
Fig. 3g; p 5 0.035 respectively). BC-biofilms of S. aureus
Newman also showed significant decreases in tolerance to
daptomycin and tetracycline (Fig. 3e; p 5 0.037, and Fig.
3f; p 5 0.046. In contrast, BC had no significant effect on
percentage survival of S. aureus SH1000 biofilms exposed
to any of the test antibiotics (Fig. 3a–c), instead there was
a reproducible but non-significant increase in survival of
BC-biofilms for all three antibiotics. This increase in
SH1000 tolerance to oxacillin was significant, however,
when biofilms were exposed to the antibiotic in PBS and
not
growth
media
(Supporting
Information
Fig.
S5;
p � 0.01); S. aureus Newman and USA300 also still dem-
onstrated the observed significant decrease in tolerance to
oxacillin using this method (Supporting Information Fig.
S5;
p � 0.05).Importantly,
biofilms
of
S.
pneumoniae
formed in the presence of BC showed a significantly
increased resistance to penicillin G, a front line antibiotic
(Fig. 3j; p < 0.004). S. pneumoniae is the major cause of
pneumonia worldwide therefore this has major implications
for the treatment of this disease.
To allow for comparison of the antibiotic tolerance of dif-
ferent strains, data was presented as percentage survival
(Fig. 3). It should be noted however that small percentage
changes correlate to biologically relevant differences in
bacterial CFUs. For example, the percentage survival of S.
aureus Newman biofilms after treatment with daptomycin
is 0.043% (Fig. 3e) in the control condition, and 0.002% for
biofilms formed in the presence of BC. In the control condi-
tion, this corresponds to 3.26 3 109 CFU/ml without
antibiotic treatment and 1.41 3 106 CFU/ml with daptomy-
cin
treatment,
which
represents
a
3
log
decrease.
Whereas BC-formed biofilms had a CFU/ml of 1.99 3 109
in the absence of daptomycin treatment, and 4.12 3 104
CFU/ml with daptomycin treatment, representing a 5 log
decrease.
Together, our data show that BC affects the function of
bacterial biofilms by altering tolerance to antibiotics with
different modes of action. Additionally, our data show that
there is an association between the tolerance of the bio-
films to antibiotics and the level of proteolytic degradation.
Biofilms of S. aureus Newman and USA300 formed with
BC demonstrated decreased degradation by proteinase K
in comparison to controls, and a decreased tolerance to
antibiotics. In contrast, biofilms of S. aureus SH1000 and
S. pneumoniae formed with BC both show increased deg-
radation by proteinase K in comparison to controls, and
reduced sensitivity to b-lactam antibiotics. Therefore these
data suggest an association between the overall biofilm
protein composition and the protectivity of these biofilms
against antibiotics.
Black carbon promotes spread of bacteria to the lungs
A significant percentage of the population carries S. pneu-
moniae
asymptomatically
in
the
nasopharynx,
and
dissemination of S. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx to
the lower respiratory tract is key to subsequent pneumo-
coccal disease. Bacteria, including S. pneumoniae, can be
introduced into the nasopharynx through inhalation of PM/
bacterial aggregates (Cao et al., 2014). Therefore, to
determine whether BC affects bacterial colonisation and
subsequent dissemination, a S. pneumoniae murine colo-
nisation model was used. Normally with this in vivo model,
there is asymptomatic colonisation of the nasopharynx but
no spread of bacteria into the lungs, or the bloodstream
(Richards et al., 2010).
Mice were intranasally inoculated with (i) BC alone, (ii)
non-BC treated S. pneumoniae, (iii) S. pneumoniae with
Fig. 1. The effect of black carbon on S. pneumoniae biofilm structure. Biofilms of S. pneumoniae PR201 (a–h) and D39 (i) were cultured in the
presence or absence of 30–100 lg/ml BC. Biofilms were imaged by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) at increasing resolutions (a–d). Light
microscopy was used to quantify biofilm thickness (e.g. n 5 18). Images are representative of the entire biofilm structure. Viable bacterial cells
were measured by sequential removal and quantification of planktonic, loosely-adhered, and biofilm bacteria (h, i, n 5 4). Error bars

 BC or (iv) saline as a control. Blood was taken and naso-
pharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavages were performed
to determine bacterial carriage at predetermined time-
points. A concentration of 7mg/ml BC was used because
this does not produce any adverse host response and
therefore any observed effect is due to the bacteria and
not due to a significant effect on the host. The lungs,
spleen, cervical lymph nodes and nasopharyngeal tissue
were taken from separate mice for histological analysis.
Significantly, the data show that BC promotes the spread
of S. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx to the lungs
(Fig. 4). At 7 days post-inoculation, there was the same
level of colonisation in the upper respiratory tract of mice
co-exposed to S. pneumoniae and BC, and those infected
with S. pneumoniae alone (Fig. 4a). In contrast, in the
lungs, bacteria were only detected when the mice had
been exposed to S. pneumoniae and BC (Fig 4b;
p � 0.01). No S. pneumoniae were found in the blood in
any condition. Histological analysis of the nares, lungs,
cervical lymph nodes and spleen of control and BC-
exposed mice did not reveal any overt signs of an inflam-
matory response nor were any BC particles detected at
these sites (Supporting Information Figs S6 and S7). The
mice exposed to BC and S. pneumoniae did not display
any overt clinical signs of disease despite the observation
of �3.68 Log10 CFU/ml in the bronchoalveolar lavages.
The fact that S. pneumoniae is only detected in the lungs
of mice exposed to BC shows that inoculation in the pres-
ence of BC promotes the dissemination of S. pneumoniae
to the lower respiratory tract, increasing the opportunity for
bacteria to cause invasive disease such as pneumonia.
Discussion
In this study we show that a major component of air pollu-
tion, BC, significantly affects bacterial colonisation and
biofilm formation, thereby demonstrating that a biological
effect of air pollution has been overlooked. Consequently
this work establishes a new paradigm; that the detrimental
impact of particulate pollutants on human health is not only
just due to direct effects on the host, but also involves the
effect on bacterial behaviour in the host.
Our data provides strong evidence for the first time that
BC alters bacterial colonisation. In the presence of BC, S.
pneumoniae biofilms were considerably thicker and more
complex than their control counterparts, as well as sub-
stantially more sensitive to proteolytic cleavage and
importantly, more resistant to antibiotics. The biofilm struc-
ture induced by BC in this study is characteristic of the
honey-comb structure of pneumococcal biofilms only previ-
ously observed in vivo or on biotic surfaces in vitro (Marks
et al., 2012). This suggests that BC acts as a novel signal
to induce pneumococcal biofilm formation, promoting colo-
nisation of the respiratory tract. The increased sensitivity
of S. pneumoniae biofilms to proteolytic degradation is
also interesting because in vivo, where S. pneumoniae will
be exposed to degrading enzymes, it could result in
increased dispersal of the biofilm and subsequent coloni-
sation of S. pneumoniae at other body sites. The increase
in antibiotic resistance of pneumococcal biofilms formed in
the presence of BC is particularly worrying as this could
affect the treatment of pneumococcal infections during
exposure to PM.
BC also impacts the behavior of S. aureus by inducing
thicker, more irregular biofilms with decreased structural
integrity. These biofilm changes could also result in an
increase in the detachment and dissemination of S. aureus
from the biofilm in vivo. Interestingly BC appeared to
inversely affect the sensitivity of the S. aureus biofilms to
proteinase K and antibiotics. S. aureus Newman and
USA300 BC-formed biofilms demonstrated decreased
sensitivity to proteinase K and increased antibiotic sensitiv-
ity compared with non-exposed biofilms. In contrast, S.
aureus SH1000 showed increased proteinase K sensitivity
and decreased antibiotic sensitivity. These data suggest
that BC exposure results in changes in biofilm composition
that directly alter biofilm function. Additionally, these data
suggest a novel link between total biofilm protein composi-
tion and tolerance to different classes of antibiotics. This
association could be due to BC inducing specific proteins
such as the penicillin binding proteins, proteins that change
the surface charge, or efflux transporters, or a more gener-
al change in the overall protein composition. Further
investigation is required to determine the specific mecha-
nisms by which these changes occur as well as the impact

 on tolerance to other environmental stressors such as the
immune response.
Our data demonstrate that BC also impacts colonisation
in vivo and promotes the spread of S. pneumoniae from the
nasopharynx to the lungs in a murine respiratory tract model.
The determinants of the shift from asymptomatic colonisa-
tion to invasive disease have yet not been fully established.
Our data identify a novel specific signal that induces S. pneu-
moniae to shift from colonisation of the nasopharynx to the
lungs. These results suggest that BC induction of S. pneu-
moniae dissemination and subsequent colonisation of the
lungs could be a key factor in how air pollutants cause
increased lower respiratory tract infectious disease.
The presence of S. pneumoniae in the lungs did not
cause any clinical signs of disease nor did the bacteria
induce any inflammatory changes. The lack of an inflam-
matory response could be due to BC particles altering the
immune system, as has been previously observed, thereby
reducing the capacity of the host immune system to mount
a response to the bacteria (Zhou and Kobzik, 2007; Mush-
taq et al., 2011; Chaudhuri et al., 2012; Mannucci et al.,
2015; Rylance et al., 2015; Longhin et al., 2016). Alterna-
tively, although BC increased the spread of bacteria to the
lower respiratory tract (LRT) and thereby provided an
increased potential to cause disease, this may only be
realised in a susceptible host, such as the very young, or
the elderly (Janssens and Krause, 2004; O’Brien et al.,
2009), or further acute or chronic exposure to stress such
as pollutants (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, the impact of BC on S.
pneumoniae colonisation may explain why exposure to PM
is associated with bacterial pneumonia (Brugha and Grigg,
2014; MacIntyre et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2014) and exacer-
bation of chronic infectious diseases such as asthma and
COPD (Cortez-Lugo et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2015; Xu
et al., 2016).
This study clearly demonstrates that BC has an intra
and inter-species differential impact on two respiratory
pathogens. Therefore BC, and other air pollutants, could
also have a significant effect on other bacterial species.
The impact of BC on bacteria could affect microbial ecolo-
gy in many different niches, such as natural microbiomes,
resulting in the unbalancing of ecosystems (Fig. 5). In fact,
the diversity of marine bacterial communities has been
shown to be impacted by BC (Cattaneo et al., 2010), an
effect that has the potential to cause serious problems for
oceanic cycles. Consequently our study shows the impor-
tance of the impact of BC on bacteria and the subsequent
risks to our health and well-being.

Fig. 3. The effect of black carbon (BC) on biofilm tolerance to
antibiotics. Biofilms of S. aureus SH1000 (a–c), Newman (d–f), and
USA300 (g–i), and S. pneumoniae PR201 (j) were cultured in the
presence or absence of 100 lg/ml BC for 24 h. Planktonic and
loosely-adhered bacteria were then removed and biofilms were
either incubated with 3 ml of an antibiotic-containing medium or
control medium for 3 h at 378C in 5% (v/v) CO2. For S. aureus,
oxacillin (50 mg/ml in BHI 1 2% (w/v) NaCl), daptomycin (256 mg/ml
in BHI 1 50 mg/ml CaCl2) and tetracycline (512 mg/ml in BHI) were
used. For S. pneumoniae PR201, penicillin G (1 mg/ml) was used in
BHI. Planktonic and loosely-adhered cells were then removed and
biofilm bacteria quantified. n � 3. Error bars represent 6 1 SEM.
Significance was determined by unpaired t-tests.

and
non-

investigated. S. pneumoniae strains were cultivated on 5% (v/
v) horse blood agar, and S. aureus strains cultured on Luria
agar (LA). Prior to each assay, overnight cultures were centri-
fuged, and pellets were resuspended to a matching CFU in
the chosen medium.
Black carbon and quartz
Black Carbon was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (UK) under
product number 699632. This was provided as a powder with
a size distribution of <500 nm, with <500 ppm trace metals,
and a weight of 12.01 g/mol. For use in assays, a stock solu-
tion of BC was made by dispersing the powder in dH2O which
had been sterilised by autoclaving at 120˚C at 15 pSI for 15
min. It is noteworthy that BC aggregates in liquid therefore
size of particles can change. Quartz reference particles
(BCR66 - Distrilab) with a size distribution of 3500–350 nm
were also employed in this work. Quartz is chemically stable
and therefore does not react with most substances even at
high temperatures.
Biofilm assay
A novel method to elucidate biofilm structure was developed
from previous work (Munoz-Elias et al., 2008). This methodol-
ogy reproducibly quantifies total bacterial growth and gives an
indication of the biofilm structure by assessing changes in the
ratio of biofilm cells compared with the loosely adherent and
planktonic cells. Bacterial cultures (3 ml) were supplemented
with 0, 30, 50 or 100 mg/ml black carbon (BC) and seeded into
wells of 12-well plates. Media choice for biofilm formation was
determined based on optimisation assays. S. pneumoniae
D39 biofilms were formed in Todd-Hewitt Broth 1 0.5% (w/v)
yeast extract (THY), and PR201 in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI).
S. aureus SH1000 biofilms were formed in BHI 1 4% (w/v)
NaCl, and S. aureus Newman and USA300 in BHI 1 1% (w/v)
glucose. 12 well plates were then incubated at 378C in a 5%
(v/v) CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. After incubation, planktonic
bacteria were gently removed without disrupting the biofilm,
and retained. The remaining biofilms were carefully washed
with 3 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and this wash was
also kept. Biofilm bacteria were then removed with CellScrap-
ers (VWR) into 1ml PBS. Each fraction was vortexed for 30 s
and serial dilutions were plated to determine colony forming
units (CFU).
Antibiotic tolerance of biofilms
To assess antibiotic sensitivity, the biofilm protocol detailed in
the previous section was used. Biofilms were formed in the
presence of 100 mg/ml black carbon, and then exposed to anti-
biotics. For this, the protocol was adjusted so that after the
removal of planktonic bacteria and the wash step, either 3 ml
medium alone or medium with antibiotics were added to each
well and incubated at 378C 5% (v/v) CO2 for 3 h. Biofilms were
then washed and CFUs enumerated as for the standard bio-
film assay. All antibiotics were used at a concentration which
caused significant biofilm degradation but not total biofilm

morbidity. n 5 5 per group. Conditions were compared with individual t-tests. Error bars represent 6 1 SEM. Statistical significance is denoted

 eradication, based on optimisation assays. For S. aureus, oxa-
cillin (50 mg/ml in BHI 1 2% (w/v) NaCl (Huang et al., 1993)),
daptomycin (256 mg/ml in BHI 1 50 mg/ml CaCl2 (Fuchs et al.,
2002)) and tetracycline (512 mg/ml in BHI) were used. For S.
pneumoniae PR201, penicillin G (1 mg/ml) was used in BHI.
Proteolytic degradation of biofilms
To investigate the role of protein in the extracellular biofilm
matrix, the standard biofilm protocol previously detailed was
again employed. Biofilms were formed in the presence of 100
mg/ml black carbon, and then 3 ml of 100 mg/ml Proteinase K
in 10 mM Tris- HCl, adjusted to pH 7.5, was added to each
well after supernatant removal and washing (Nicholson et al.,
2013). Control wells containing buffer alone were also includ-
ed. Biofilms were then incubated at 378C 5% (v/v) CO2 for
2 h, and bacterial numbers were quantified.
Microscopy
Bacterial cultures were inoculated into 12-well plates contain-
ing 13 mm round glass coverslips, and were incubated at
378C in a 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. For scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), coverslips were then washed with
PBS, fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, washed in 0.1 M
S€
orensens buffer, gold coated, and viewed with a Hitachi S-
3000H SEM (Dykstra and Reuss, 2003). For transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), coverslips were washed with
PBS, infused with 10% (v/v) BSA, then fixed with 2.5% (v/v)
glutaraldehyde and 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide/1.5% (w/v)
potassium ferricyanide. Coverslips were dehydrated in an eth-
anol, propylene oxide, Spurr’s Modified Resin series and
polymerised overnight. Sections of around 90 nm thickness
were cut from within each biofilm with a Reichert ultracut E
ultramicrotome, stained with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate
and Reynold’s lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL JEM-1400
TEM (Glauert and Lewis, 2014). For measurements of biofilm
thickness, 18 cross-sections were taken from the biofilm and
were measured blind at 12 equally spaced points with light
microscopy.
In vivo colonisation
All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Home
Office Project Licence and adhered to the UK Animals (Scien-
tific Procedures) Act (1986). Na€
ıve 8 week old female outbred
MF1 mice were obtained from Charles River, UK. Upon arriv-
al, mice were housed in groups of 2–5, depending on study
requirements, and allowed to acclimatise for one week in the
Division of Biomedical Services, University of Leicester, on a
12 h light-dark cycle and access to food and water ad libitum.
For the colonisation experiment, mice were intranasally inocu-
lated with 15 ml of either (i) PBS as a control, (ii) 6.45 3 105
CFU S. pneumoniae D39, (iii) 7 mg/ml BC alone, or (iv) a mix-
ture of 6.45x105 CFU S. pneumoniae D39 with 7 mg/ml BC,
whilst held in a horizontal position. For inoculation, mice were
anaesthetised with 2.5% (v/v) isoflurane and held in a horizon-
tal position during inoculation. Seven mice were used per
group, 28 in total. Allocation of mice to each group, the order
in which groups were inoculated, and the order in which each
cage was culled for sample recovery, was randomised. Mice
were regularly monitored (at least once daily) for signs of dis-
ease for the duration of the experiment. At 7 days post-
infection,
five
mice
were
culled
from
each
group
to
assess bacterial load. Mice were deeply anaesthetised with
2.5% (v/v) isoflorane and blood was collected by cardiac punc-
ture in which the animal was exsanguinated under terminal
anaesthesia. Death was confirmed by cervical dislocation.
Bronchoalveolar and nasopharyngeal lavages were performed
to determine bacterial carriage at each time-point. Bronchoal-
veolar lavages were performed by instilling 500 ml tripticase
soy broth supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol (TSBG) into
the lungs via the trachea, recovering the lavage fluid, and
repeating this twice. Nasopharyngeal lavages were performed
by washing through the nasopharynx with 500 ml TSBG three
times. Lavages were then serially diluted and plated to deter-
mine bacterial viability. For histological analysis, an additional
two mice per group were deeply anaesthetised with 2.5% (v/v)
isoflurane and culled by cervical dislocation. Death was con-
firmed by exsanguination. The lungs, spleen, cervical lymph
nodes and nasopharyngeal tissue were then removed and
fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin for 24–48 h. Samples were embed-
ded in paraffin for histological sectioning, and were stained
with
haematoxylin
and
eosin
and
analysed
by
light
microscopy.
Statistical analysis
Data are summarised as standard error of the mean (SEM)
and were analysed using GraphPad Prism version 6.04
(GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Biofilm quantification
results were validated by at least three biological replicate
experiments. In vivo experiments were carried out with n 5 7
in each group. Quantification of biofilm thickness was carried
out on n 5 18 distinct biofilm sections per condition. ANOVA or
t-tests were used to determine significance as appropriate.

Fig. S1. The effect of black carbon on internal biofilm struc-
ture. Biofilms of S. pneumoniae (a,b), S. aureus SH1000
(c,d) and Newman (e,f) were cultured in the presence or
absence of 100 lg/ml BC and imaged by transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM). Images are representative of the
entire biofilm structure.
Fig. S2. Quartz has no effect on biofilm architecture. Bio-
films of S. aureus SH1000 (a, b) and S. pneumoniae
PR201 (c,d) were cultured with and without 30 lg/ml Quartz
and
imaged
by
scanning

microscopy
(SEM).
Images are representative of the entire biofilm structure.
Fig. S3. The effect of black carbon on S. aureus Newman
biofilms. Biofilms of S. aureus Newman were cultured in the
presence or absence of 30 - 100 lg/ml BC. Biofilms were
imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at increas-
ing resolution (a-d) and light microscopy was used to quan-
tify biofilm thickness (e-g, n518). Viable bacterial cells were
measured
by
sequential
removal
and
quantification
of
planktonic, loosely- adhered, and biofilm bacteria (h, n54).
Error bars represent 6 1 SEM. Significance was determined
by t-tests (g) or ANOVA (h) * p�0.05, *** p�0.001, ****
p�0.0001.

biofilms. Biofilms of S. aureus USA300 were cultured in the
presence or absence of 30 - 100 lg/ml BC. Biofilms were
imaged by scanning electron microscopy at increasing reso-
lution (a-d). Images are representative of the entire biofilm
structure. Viable bacterial cells were measured by sequen-
tial
removal

Fig. S5. BC alters biofilm antibiotic tolerance. Biofilms of S.
aureus SH1000 (a), Newman (b), and USA300 (c) were cul-
tured in the presence or absence of 100 lg/ml BC for 24 h.
Planktonic and loosely-adhered bacteria were then removed
and biofilms were either incubated with 3 ml of 50 mg/ml
oxacillin in PBS supplemented with 2% (w/v) NaCl, or with
buffer alone as a control, for 3 h at 378C in 5% (v/v) CO2.
After incubation, planktonic and loosely adherent bacteria
were removed and discarded, and the remaining biofilm

Fig. S6. Histological analysis of lungs and nares at 7 days
post-inoculation. Female MF1 mice were mice intranasally
inoclated with 15 ml of PBS, Black Carbon (BC), S. pneu-
moniae D39 (D39), or D39 and BC together (D391BC).
Mice were culled 7 days post inoculation. Formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue sections of lungs (A-D) and
nares (E-H) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin
(H1E). Sections were imaged using light microscopy
using 5x or 10x magnification. Physical features of notes
are labelled for identification.
