Introduction
Dropping out of high school is related to a number of negative outcomes. For example, the 
median income of persons ages 18 through 67 who had not completed high school was roughly 
$25,000 in 2012.1 By comparison, the median income of persons ages 18 through 67 who 
completed their education with at least a high school credential, including a General Educational 
Development (GED) certificate, was approximately $46,000. Over a person’s lifetime, this 
translates into a loss of approximately $670,000 in income for a person who did not complete 
high school compared to a person with at least a high school credential (Rouse 2007).2 Among 
adults age 25 and older, a lower percentage of dropouts are in the labor force than are adults who 
earned a high school credential. Similarly, among adults in the labor force, a higher percentage 
of dropouts are unemployed than are adults who earned a high school credential (U.S. 
Department of Labor 2013). In addition, dropouts age 25 and older reported being in worse 
health than adults who are not dropouts, regardless of income (Pleis, Ward, and Lucas 2010). 
Dropouts also make up disproportionately higher percentages of the nation’s institutionalized 
population.3 In a comparison of those who drop out of high school and those who complete high 
school, the average high school dropout costs the economy approximately $250,000 over his or 
her lifetime in terms of lower tax contributions, higher reliance on Medicaid and Medicare, 
higher rates of criminal activity, and higher reliance on welfare (Levin and Belfield 2007).4
This report builds upon a series of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports 
on high school dropout and completion rates that began in 1988. It presents estimates of rates in 
2012, provides data about trends in dropout and completion rates over the last four decades 
(1972–2012),5 and examines the characteristics of high school dropouts and high school 
completers in 2012. Four rates are presented to provide a broad picture of high school dropouts 
and completers in the United States, including the event dropout rate, the status dropout rate, the 
status completion rate, and the adjusted cohort graduation rate. Each rate contributes unique 
information. Information about individuals who pass the GED exam is provided to place the 
different rates into context relative to this widely used alternative high school credential. The 
appendices also include information on the averaged freshman graduation rate. In addition, 
Appendix Table A-4 presents Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate (AFGR) data. The AFGR is 
1 U.S. Department of Commerce, Census Bureau, Current Population Survey (CPS), March 2013. However, these are not all high 
school dropouts: 1.0 percent of persons ages 18 through 67 were enrolled in high school in 2012 (U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, October 2012). 
2 Rouse estimates a lifetime loss of $550,000 using 2004 March CPS data. The estimate here is adjusted for inflation between March 
2004 and March 2012 using March-to-March consumer price index adjustments. 
3 See discussion later in this report. 
4 Levin and Belfield estimate costs at $209,000 as of 2004. The estimate here is adjusted for inflation between March 2004 and 
March 2012 using March 2004 and March 2012 consumer price index adjustments. 
5 Trend analyses show a pattern of decline in event dropout rates prior to 1990, a brief upward trend from 1990 through 1995, and 
then another decline through 2012. As a result, in this report, overall trends from 1972 to 2012 are reported, as well as separate 
trends from 1972 through 1990, 1990 through 1995, and 1995 through 2012, to increase the understanding of patterns over time in 
these rates. 
 Introduction

a proxy indicator for cohort rates such as the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate (ACGR). The 
AFGR uses aggregated counts of students by grade and the overall diploma count, as opposed to 
individual student-level data, to estimate an on-time graduation rate. While the AFGR is not as 
accurate as the ACGR, it can be estimated annually as far back as the 1960s.  
•
The event dropout rate estimates the percentage of high school students who left high
school between the beginning of one school year and the beginning of the next without
earning a high school diploma or an alternative credential (e.g., a GED). This report presents
a national event dropout rate for students attending public or private schools using the
Current Population Survey (CPS) and state event dropout rates for public high school
students using the Common Core of Data (CCD). Event dropout rates can be used to track
annual changes in the dropout behavior of students in the U.S. school system.
•
The status dropout rate reports the percentage of individuals in a given age range who are
not in school (public or private) and have not earned a high school diploma or an alternative
credential. The rate is calculated using CPS data. Supplemental data are also presented from
the American Community Survey (ACS), which allows analyses of those in institutionalized
group quarters. The status dropout rate focuses on an overall age group as opposed to
individuals in the U.S. school system, so it can be used to study general population issues.
•
The status completion rate indicates the percentage of individuals in a given age range who
are not currently enrolled in high school and who have earned a high school diploma or an
alternative credential, irrespective of when or where the credential was earned.6 The rate is
calculated using CPS data. It focuses on an overall age group as opposed to individuals in the
U.S. school system, so it can be used to study general population issues.7
•
The adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) indicates the proportion of public high
school freshmen who graduate with a regular diploma 4 years after starting 9th grade. The
rate is calculated by state education agencies (SEAs) and submitted to the U.S. Department
of Education through the EDFacts submission system. It focuses on public high school
students as opposed to all high school students or the general population. It provides a
measure of the extent to which public high schools are graduating students within the
expected period of 4 years after initially starting 9th grade. The ACGR also accounts for
students who transfer in from another state, immigrate to the United States and enroll in
public school, transfer out to another state, emigrate to another country, or die.
More information about how the rates are derived and about the data that are used for 
these rates is provided briefly in the body of the report, with more detail provided in appendix A. 
As noted in the rate descriptions, data presented in this report are drawn from the annual 
October CPS, the annual CCD collections, EDFacts, the annual ACS, and the annual General 
Educational Development Testing Service (GEDTS) statistical reports. Data in the CPS files are 
collected through household interviews and are representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized 
population in the United States, including students attending public and private schools. The CCD 
6 The status completion rate is not the inverse of the status dropout rate (i.e., status completion does not equal 100 minus the status 
dropout rate). The rates are based on different age ranges, and the completion rate excludes high school students from its 
denominator, whereas high school students are included in the denominator of the status dropout rate.  
7 Seastrom et al. (2006a) refer to this rate as the “Current Population Survey High School Completion Indicator.”

and EDFacts data are collected from SEAs about all public schools and school systems in the 
United States, and contain aggregates of administrative record data kept by these agencies that 
include all public school students in this country. The ACS collects data on the U.S. resident 
population through interviews with households and persons in group quarters facilities. The 
individuals in group quarters facilities surveyed in the ACS include incarcerated persons, 
institutionalized persons, and the active duty military who are residing in the United States. The 
GEDTS data are also built from administrative record data kept by the testing service, and contain 
information about all GED test takers (data presented in this report are restricted to individuals in 
the 50 states and the District of Columbia).8
As with all data collections, those used in this report are useful for calculating some types 
of estimates, but poorly suited for calculating other types. For example, CPS data are well suited 
for studying the civilian, noninstitutionalized population in the United States, including students 
attending public and private schools, but do not provide information about military personnel or 
individuals residing in institutionalized group quarters, such as prison inmates or patients in 
long-term medical or custodial facilities. Data from CPS cannot produce estimates below 
regional levels of geography for the age groups used in this report. Data from the CCD are 
appropriate for studying public school students in a given year, but do not provide information 
on private school students or young people who did not attend school in the United States. Other 
datasets can provide more detailed information on the processes and precise timelines associated 
with completing high school or dropping out.9
Though capable of generating estimates for smaller levels of geography and for individuals 
in a wider range of group quarter settings than CPS data, ACS data are not available for longer 
trend analyses and lack many demographic and income details available in CPS. GEDTS data 
are helpful for identifying the number of people who take and pass the GED examination in a 
given year, but do not contain information about schools that GED test takers attended before 
taking the GED test. In addition, the EDFacts adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) is based 
on records for individual students and measures the percentage of students who graduate within 
4 years of starting 9th grade.  
Differences between individuals who completed high school with a regular high school 
diploma and those who completed high school with alternative credentials such as a GED are 
discussed in the report. Because the GED is the primary option available to individuals to 
complete high school outside of a regular high school curriculum and because of limitations 
with CPS and ACS data in terms of being able to effectively identify GED and other 
8 Appendix A contains information about the data collections and describes in detail how the rates are computed. 
9 Many states have student-level administrative record systems that follow student progress over time that can be used for this kind 
of analysis. NCES is supporting the development of similar systems across additional states (see http://nces.ed.gov/programs/slds/ 
for details) and periodically conducts national-level longitudinal studies of high school students that can be used for such analysis 
(e.g., the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009).

alternative credential holders,10 alternative credential recipients are not included in dropout 
counts and are not separated from regular diploma holders in the status completion rates. 
Separate estimates of GED recipients are provided, however, based on GEDTS data. 
Published data from GEDTS do not allow age-specific estimates by any other characteristics 
(e.g., 18- to 24-year-olds by sex), so details provided in this report are limited to age range 
information. 
All changes or differences noted in this report were tested using Student’s t statistic and are 
statistically significant at the p ≤ .05 level. Two-tailed t-tests are used throughout. Analyses did 
not include adjustments for multiple comparisons. When significance tests fail to meet the p ≤ .05 
criterion and the comparison is of substantive interest, terminology such as “no measurable 
difference was found” is used in this report. Regression analysis was used to test for trends across 
age groups and over time. Standard error tables are available in appendix C. 
10 GED recipients are combined in the CPS and ACS data with other alternative credential holders, and the estimates of all 
alternative credential holders from the CPS and ACS tend to be lower than GEDTS-estimated counts of GED recipients alone.

Findings 
National Event Dropout Rates 
The national event dropout rate presented here is based on data from the CPS and is an 
estimate of the percentage of both private and public high school students who left high school 
between the beginning of one school year and the beginning of the next without earning a high 
school diploma or an alternative credential, such as a GED. Specifically, the rate describes the 
percentage of youth ages 15 through 24 in the United States who dropped out of grades 10–12 
from either public or private schools in the 12 months between one October and the next (e.g., 
October 2011 to October 2012).11 The measure provides information about the rate at which U.S. 
high school students are leaving school without receiving a high school credential. As such, it can 
be used to study student experiences in the U.S. secondary school system in a given year. It is not 
well suited for studying how many people in the country lack a high school credential 
irrespective of whether they attended U.S. high schools, nor does it provide a picture of the 
dropout problem more generally because it only measures how many students dropped out in a 
single year, and students may reenter the school system after that time. More detail about the 
definition and computation of the event dropout rate and other rates along with a summary table 
of how rates in this report relate to each other can be found in appendix A. 
•
Event dropout rates: On average, 3.4 percent of students who were enrolled in public or
private high schools in October 2011 left school before October 2012 without completing a
high school program (table 1). No measurable change was detected in the event dropout rate
between 2011 and 2012 (3.4 percent in 2011); however, since 1972, event dropout rates have
trended downward, from 6.1 percent in 1972 to 3.4 percent in 2012 (figure 1 and table 2).12
The rate declined through the 1970s and 1980s reaching 4.0 percent in 1990. Between 1990
and 1995, the rate increased to 5.7 percent. The rate then declined again, reaching 3.4
percent in 2009, and has remained around this rate through 2012. These fluctuations between
1990 and 2012 resulted in no measurable difference between the 1990 and 2012 event
dropout rates.
•
Event dropout rates by sex: There was no measurable difference in the 2012 event dropout
rates for males and females, a pattern generally found since 1972 (table 3). Exceptions to this
pattern occurred in 4 years—1974, 1976, 1978, and 2000—when males had measurably
higher event dropout rates than females.
11 Data on 9th-grade dropouts are not available in the Current Population Survey (see appendix A for more information). The state 
event dropout rates for public high school students presented later in this report are based on the Common Core of Data, which 
includes 9th-graders.  
12 Trend analyses were conducted using regressions. See appendix A for more details. 
 Findings
6 
• Event dropout rates by race/ethnicity:13 Black and Hispanic students had higher event 
dropout rates than White students in 2012 (6.8 percent vs. 5.4 percent vs. 1.6 percent) 
(table 1). The general downward trend in event dropout rates over the 4-decade period from 
1972 through 2012 observed in the overall population was also found among White, Black, 
and Hispanic students (table 3).14 However, the decreases happened at different times over 
this 40-year period for these racial/ethnic groups. The pattern found among White students 
mirrored that in the overall population: a decrease in event rates from 1972 through 1990, an 
increase from 1990 through 1995, and another decrease from 1995 through 2012. Black 
students also experienced a decline from 1972 through 1990 and an increase from 1990 
through 1995, but their event dropout rates fluctuated and no measurable trend was found 
between 1995 and 2012. Hispanic students, on the other hand, experienced no measurable 
change in their event dropout rates from 1972 through 1990 or from 1990 through 1995, but 
did experience a decline from 1995 through 2012.  
• Event dropout rates by family income: In 2012, the event dropout rate of students living in 
low-income families was greater than the rate of their peers from high-income families (5.9 
percent vs. 1.3 percent) (table 1).15 Students from low-, middle-, and high-income families 
experienced an overall decline in event dropout rates during the nearly 4-decade period of the 
mid-1970s through 2012 (figure 1 and table 4). Comparable income data are not available for 
1974, so trend analyses were conducted from 1975 onward. All three groups of students 
experienced declines in event dropout rates from 1975 through 1990. Rates for those from 
low-income families fell from 15.7 percent to 9.5 percent. Rates for students from middle-
income families fell from 6.0 percent to 4.3 percent, and rates for those from high-income 
families fell from 2.6 percent to 1.1 percent. From 1990 to 1995, event dropout rates for 
students from low-, middle-, and high-income families trended upward. Between 1995 and 
2012, the event rates for students from low-, middle-, and high-income families trended 
downward.  
• Event dropout rates by age: Students who pursued a high school education past the typical 
high school age were at higher risk than others of becoming an event dropout (table 1). The 
2012 event dropout rates for students in the typical age range for fall high school enrollment 
(ages 15 through 17) were lower than those for older students (ages 20 through 24). 
Specifically, 2.2 percent of 15- through 16-year-olds and 1.9 percent of 17-year-olds 
13 All of the 2012 tables report data for the following four racial/ethnic categories: White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; 
Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic; and Hispanic. The first three categories consist of individuals who identified as only one race 
and who did not identify as Hispanic. The fourth category consists of Hispanics of all races and racial combinations. For 2012 status 
dropout and status completion rates (tables 6, 9, and 10, respectively), results for two additional racial/ethnic groups are presented: 
American Indian/Alaska Natives and persons of Two or more races are included in the total, but not shown separately for 2012 event 
dropout rates and for event dropout, status dropout, and status completion results for prior years. For simplicity, the terms “White,” 
“Black,” “Asian/Pacific Islander,” “American Indian/Alaska Natives,” and “Two or more races” are used in the text of this report 
without the “non-Hispanic” label.  
14 The trend analyses conducted to examine this four-decade period are based on annual rate estimates for each year from 1972 
through 2012. Separate trend analyses were also conducted for each racial/ethnic group separately for trends across the three shorter 
time periods indicated in the bullet: 1972–1990, 1990–1995, and 1995–2012. Because of small sample sizes for many of the earlier 
years, reliable trend analyses could not be conducted for Asian Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and persons of 
Two or more races. 
15 “Low income” is defined here as the lowest 20 percent of all family incomes, while “high income” refers to the top 20 percent of 
all family incomes. In 2012, low-income families included those with $18,400 or less in family income, while high-income families 
included those with $90,824 or more in family income. For respondents missing data for family income (20.4 percent of the 
weighted sample in table 1), cold-deck procedures were used to impute data.

• Event dropout rates by disability status: In 2012 students with disabilities had higher event 
dropout rates compared to students without disabilities (10.0 percent vs. 3.2 percent) (table 
1).16
• Event dropout rates by geographic region: There were no measurable differences found in 
the event dropout rates for high school students across regions for 2012 (table 1). 
State Event Dropout Rates for Public High School Students 
State-level event dropout rates for public high school students are calculated using data 
from 1993 through 2012 from the CCD. The 2012 rate reported in this publication reflects the 
percentage of public school students who were enrolled in grades 9–12 at some point during the 
2011–12 school year, but were not enrolled in school in October 2012 and had not earned a high 
school diploma or completed a state- or district-approved education program.17 Rates for prior 
years were calculated in a similar manner.18 State event dropout rates are useful for evaluating 
the performance of public high school systems in reporting states. They do not include 
information about individuals outside the public school system. Rates are presented for the 
District of Columbia and the 50 states for the 2011–12 school year (table 5). 
• State event dropout rates for 9th- through 12th-grade public high school students: The 
2011–12 CCD event dropout rates ranged from 1.3 percent in New Hampshire to 7.0 percent 
in Alaska (table 5). In all, event dropout rates for public high school students in grades 9–12 
were lower than 2.0 percent in eight states: New Hampshire, 1.3 percent; Alabama, 1.4 
percent; New Jersey, 1.4 percent; Utah, 1.5 percent; Idaho, 1.9 percent; Minnesota, 1.9 
percent; Virginia, 1.9 percent; Wisconsin, 1.9 percent. Three states had event dropout rates 
of 6.0 percent or more: New Mexico, 6.4 percent; Michigan, 6.9 percent; Alaska, 7.0 
percent.  
• Combining data from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, approximately 3.3 percent of 
public high school students dropped out of grades 9–12 during the 2011–12 school year.  
16 Individuals identified in this report as having a disability were reported to have difficulty with at least one of the following: 
hearing, seeing even when wearing glasses, walking or climbing stairs, dressing or bathing, doing errands alone, concentrating, 
remembering, or making decisions. 
17 State and local policies can affect the numbers of graduates reported in the CCD. For example, some states have in-school General 
Education Development (GED) programs that require fewer credit hours than a regular high school track, but lead to the award of 
regular diplomas. 
18 Some states report using an alternative 1-year period from one July to the next. Rates for those states are presented because event 
dropout rates based on the July-July calendar are comparable to those calculated using an October-to-October calendar (Winglee et 
al. 2000).

National Status Dropout Rates 
The status dropout rate measures the percentage of individuals who are not enrolled in high 
school and who do not have a high school credential. The status dropout rate is higher than the 
event rate in a given year because the status dropout rate includes all dropouts in a particular age 
range, regardless of when or where they last attended school, including individuals who may have 
never attended school in the United States. Based on the 16- through 24-year-old age range, the 
measure provides an indicator of the percentage of young people who lack a high school 
credential. While useful for measuring overall educational attainment among young adults in the 
United States, the status dropout rate is not useful as an indicator of the performance of schools 
because it includes those who never attended school in the United States. Using data from the 
CPS, the status dropout rates in this report show the percentage of young people ages 16 through 
24 who are out of school and who have not earned a high school diploma or alternative 
credential, such as a GED. 
• Status dropout rates: In October 2012, approximately 2.6 million 16- through 24-year-olds 
were not enrolled in high school and had not earned a high school diploma or alternative 
credential (table 6). These status dropouts accounted for 6.6 percent of the 39 million 
noninstitutionalized, civilian 16- through 24-year-olds living in the United States. Among all 
individuals in this age group, status dropout rates trended downward between 1972 and 
2012, declining from 14.6 percent to 6.6 percent (figure 2 and table 7). The status dropout 
rate trended downward between 1972 and 1990, fluctuated between 1990 and 1995, and then 
trended downward again between 1995 and 2012.  
• Status dropout rates by sex: Males ages 16–24 had a higher status dropout rate than 
females in 2012 (7.3 vs. 5.9 percent) (table 6).  
• Status dropout rates by race/ethnicity: The 2012 status dropout rates for Asian/Pacific 
Islander (3.3 percent) and White (4.3 percent) 16- to 24-year olds were lower than those for 
Black (7.5 percent), Hispanic (12.7 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native (14.6 
percent) 16- to 24-year-olds.  
The status dropout rate for Black (7.5 percent) 16- to 24-year olds was lower than the rate for 
Hispanics (12.7 percent) and for American Indians/Alaska Natives (14.6 percent) (table 6). 
The status dropout rate for persons of Two or more races (5.5 percent) was lower than the rate 
for Hispanics (12.7 percent), but not measurably different from the rates for White, Black, 
Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native 16- to 24-year olds.  
In the past two decades since 1990, the White-Black gap in status dropout rates has 
narrowed (figure 2 and table 8).  
The percentage of Hispanics ages 16–24 who were dropouts was consistently higher than that 
of Black and White 16- to 24-year-olds throughout the 40-year period of 1972–2012 (figure 2 
and table 8). White and Black status dropout rates fell from 1972 to 2012, from 12.3 to 4.3 
percent and from 21.3 to 7.5 percent, respectively. Between 1972 and 1990, Hispanic status 
dropout rates showed no clear trend, but since 1990 they have demonstrated a downward 
trend, falling from 32.4 percent in 1990 to 12.7 percent in 2012.  
 Findings
9 
In 2012, some 24.7 percent of Hispanic 16- through 24-year-olds born outside the United 
States were status high school dropouts (table 6). Hispanics born in the United States had 
lower status dropout rates than immigrant Hispanics (8.8 percent and 8.6 percent for “first 
generation” and “second generation or higher,” respectively).19 In each “recency of 
immigration” category in table 6, Hispanic youth had higher status dropout rates than non- 
Hispanic youth.  
• 
(
Status dropout rates by age: Persons ages 16 and 17 had lower status dropout rates in 2012 
2.2 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively) than 18, 19, and 20- through 24-year-olds (5.5 
percent, 8.8 percent, and 7.8 percent, respectively), at least in part because most 16- and 17-
year-olds were still actively pursuing a high school diploma (table 6).20
• Status dropout rates by disability status: Sixteen- through 24-year-olds with disabilities 
had a status dropout in 2012 that was about twice as large as the rate for their peers 
without disabilities (14.4 vs. 6.3 percent) (table 6).  
Estimates in the preceding discussion of status dropout rates focused on the civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population. Data from the American Community Survey are available to 
provide comparable estimates for those in institutionalized group quarters largely composed of the 
incarcerated population. 
• Status dropout rates by institutionalized group quarter setting: In 2012, approximately 35.4 
percent of 16- to 24-year-olds in institutionalized group quarters were status dropouts (table 9). 
This compares to a status dropout rate of 6.6 percent among 16- to 24-year-olds in the 
noninstitutionalized population.21
National Status Completion Rates 
The status completion rate indicates the percentage of young people who have left high 
school and who hold a high school credential. The rate reported here is based on CPS data and 
represents the percentage of 18- through 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in high school and 
who have earned a high school diploma or an alternative credential, including a GED 
certificate.22 The status completion rate includes individuals who may have completed their 
education outside the United States, so the rate is not suited for measuring the performance of 
the education system in this country. The status completion rate is not the inverse of the status 
dropout rate (i.e., status completion does not equal 100 minus the status dropout rate). The 
19 Individuals defined as “first generation” were born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, but one or both of their parents 
were born outside the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Individuals defined as “second generation or higher” were born in the 50 
states or the District of Columbia, as were both of their parents. 
20 In 2012, data from the CPS show that high school enrollment rates by age group were 95.4 percent for 16-year-olds, and 90.1 
percent for 17-year-olds (estimates not shown in tables). 
21 While the CPS and ACS status dropout rates for the overall noninstitutionalized population of 16- through 24-year-olds are both 
6.6 percent, differences between the sources by demographic characteristics differ. Moreover, differences in design features of the 
ACS and CPS such as item wording and periodicity lead to somewhat different status dropout counts and rates from the two data 
sources. 
22 Appendix A provides information about alternative credentials in the CPS data.

rates are based on different age ranges, with the status dropout rate reported for 16- through 
24-year-olds and the status completion rate reported for 18- through 24-year-olds. The 
completion rate excludes high school students from its denominator, whereas high school 
students are included in the denominator of the status dropout rate. 
• Status completion rates: In 2012, some 91.3 percent of 18- through 24-year-olds not 
enrolled in high school had received a high school diploma or alternative credential (table 
10).23 Overall, status completion rates have increased since 1972 (figure 4 and table 11), 
but during the 1970s they exhibited no consistent trend. Since 1980, the rate has shown an 
upward trend, starting at 83.9 percent in 1980 and rising to 91.3 percent in 2012.  
• Status completion rates by sex: Females ages 18–24 who were not enrolled in high school 
in 2012 had a higher status completion rate (92.3 percent) than their male counterparts (90.3 
percent) (table 10).  
• Status completion rates by race/ethnicity: In 2012, among 18- through 24-year-olds not 
currently enrolled in high school, Asian/Pacific Islander (94.9 percent) and White (94.6 
percent) young adults had status completion rates greater than 90 percent. Both had rates that 
were higher than Black (90.0 percent), Hispanic (82.8 percent), and American Indian/Alaska 
Native (79.0 percent) young adults (table 9). The status completion rate for persons of Two 
or more races (91.9 percent) did not measurably differ from the rates for White or 
Asian/Pacific Islander young adults.  
Status completion rates for White, Black, and Hispanic young adults exhibited no general 
patterns of change during the 1970s, but rates trended upward for each group between 
1980 and 2012 (figure 4 and table 12).  
In 2012, some 69.3 percent of Hispanic 18- to 24-year-olds born outside the United States 
and not currently enrolled in high school were status high school completers (table 10). In 
comparison, status completion rates were higher for Hispanics born in the United States 
(87.5 percent for “first generation” and 88.3 percent for “second generation or higher”), 
although in each immigrant category Hispanics had lower status completion rates than non-
Hispanics. No measureable differences were detected between first generation and second 
generation Hispanic 18- to 24-year olds. 
• Status completion rates by sex and race/ethnicity: For Hispanic 18- to 24-year-olds, 
status completion rates differed by sex (figure 5). In 2012, females (84.8 percent) had 
higher status completion rates than their male (80.8 percent) counterparts. No measurable 
differences by sex were detected in the status completion rates of White, Black, American 
Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Two or more races young adults.  
• Status completion rate by disability status: In 2012, persons ages 18–24 with disabilities 
and who were not enrolled in high school had a lower status completion rate (81.5 percent) 
than their peers without disabilities (91.7 percent) (table 10).  
• Status completion rates by geographic region: Among 18- through 24-year-olds, those in 
the West had lower status completion rates (90.5 percent) in 2012 than their counterparts in 
the Midwest (92.6 percent) (table 10).  
23 Considering all 18- through 24-year-olds, irrespective of enrollment status, 85.3 percent held a high school credential in October 
2012 (estimate not show in tables).

General Educational Development (GED) Credentials and National Status 
Completion Rates 
GED programs allow individuals who would otherwise lack a high school credential, 
because they did not complete a regular high school program of study, to obtain an alternative 
credential. Not completing a regular high school program can occur for several reasons, 
including dropping out of high school and immigrating into the country without ever enrolling in 
U.S. high schools. The GED is accepted by most colleges and universities that require a high 
school diploma for admission, and most companies that have positions requiring a high school 
diploma accept the GED as an alternative credential (American Council on Education 2009).  
While GEDs provide an important opportunity for those who do not earn a regular high 
school diploma to obtain a high school credential, GED recipients tend to fare significantly worse 
than those holding regular diplomas across a range of measures. For example, while GED 
recipients who go on to postsecondary education experience the same economic benefits as 
regular high school diploma earners who access postsecondary education, GED recipients attend 
postsecondary programs at much lower rates than regular high school diploma earners (American 
Council on Education 2010).  
Once in postsecondary education programs, completion rates are much lower for GED 
recipients than for those holding regular high school diplomas. Also, while high school dropouts 
with relatively low cognitive skills experience improved incomes if they earn a GED, dropouts 
with relatively high cognitive skills do not experience increased earnings after earning a GED 
(see Boesel, Alsalam, and Smith [1998] and Tyler [2003] for overviews of GED research). 
To better understand how the number and rate of young people passing the GED exam 
relate to different estimates presented in this report, data from the GED Testing Service are used 
to estimate the number of GED holders in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population in 2012.24 
Estimates of those passing the exams provide an approximation of those being awarded GEDs. 
It is possible to pass the tests and not meet additional criteria required to obtain the credential in 
some states. Data on GED credential issuance are not consistently available across the United 
States. Estimates are provided for 18- through 24-year-olds to correspond to the age range used 
for the status completion rates.25
24 To determine how many people in a given age range passed the GED exam requires summation of reported data over multiple 
years of GEDTS reports. For example, the number of 18- through 24-years-olds in 2012 who passed the GED exam was estimated 
by taking the sum of those who passed the exam in 2012 at ages 18-24 plus those who passed the exam in 2011 at ages 17 through 
23 plus those who passed the exam in 2010 at ages 16-22, and so on. See appendix A of this report for details of this calculation.  
25 Civilians in the noninstitutionalized population are the focus of the status dropout and completion rates. To align the GED 
estimates with this population, data from the Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2004 (U.S. Department 
of Justice 2004) prorated to 2012 and data provided by the Defense Manpower Data Center for active-duty military personnel in 
2012 were used. See appendix A of this report for details of how the GED estimates were aligned with the noninstitutionalized 
population. 
                                                          
 
 Findings
12 
• National estimates of 18- through 24-year-olds with a GED in 2012: There were 
approximately 1,620,000 persons ages 18 through 24 in 2012 who had passed the GED exam 
in 2012 or in prior years (data not shown in tables). This represents 5.3 percent of the civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population of 18- through 24-year-olds who were not in high school in 
2012. 
• Status completion rates for 18- through 24-year-olds and the GED in 2012: Among 18- 
through 24-year-olds who were high school completers in 2012, approximately 6.0 percent 
had passed the GED exam. Subtracting out those who passed the GED exam, the status 
completion rate in 2012 for regular high school diploma holders and those holding alternative 
credentials other than a GED was 85.3 percent (data not shown in tables).26
Focusing on the 18- through 24-year-old population without consideration of high 
school enrollment, approximately 84.7 percent held some form of high school credential in 
2012, with 5.3 percent holding a GED and 79.4 percent holding a regular high school diploma 
or other alternative credential (data not shown in tables).27
Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates for Public School Students 
The adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) provides information about the percentage of 
public high school students who graduate on time—that is, 4 years after starting 9th grade for the 
first time—with a regular diploma. Regular diploma earners are individuals who are awarded a 
regular high school diploma or a diploma that recognizes some higher level of academic 
achievement. They can be considered as students who meet or exceed the coursework and 
performance standards for high school graduation established by a state or other relevant 
authority. Other high school completers who were awarded alternate credentials such as a 
certificate of completion or GED are not included in the ACGR calculations because they are not 
considered regular graduates.  
The rate follows the progress of a cohort of first-time 9th graders over the 4 school years 
between the time they start high school through the school year in which they are scheduled to 
graduate assuming a standard 4-year high school experience. The denominator of the rate is the 
number of 9th graders in the cohort, adjusted for students moving into and out of the school or 
jurisdiction to attend a high school elsewhere. The numerator is the number of students in the 
adjusted cohort who hold a regular or advanced high school diploma 4 years after starting 9th 
26 The CPS data used for the status completion rate include those holding alternative credentials (such as a GED) in the count of 
completers. Other alternative credentials exist, so removing the GED count from the count of completers does not result in a count of 
regular high school diploma holders. For discussion of alternative credentials offered by public school systems, please see Thurlow, 
Vang, and Cormier (2010). 
27 Similar estimates could be made in reference to the 16- through 24-year-old population, which is the focus of the status dropout 
rate. There were approximately 1,559,000 persons ages 16 through 24 in 2012 who had passed the GED exam in 2012 or prior years 
(data not shown in tables). This represents 4.1 percent of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of 16- through 24-year-olds in 
2012.

grade for the first time.28
• National adjusted cohort graduation rate for public school students: For SY 2010–11, the 
estimated national 4-year ACGR for public high school students was 79 percent, and for SY 
2011–12 it was 80 percent. This indicates that nearly 4 out of 5 students receive a regular high 
school diploma within 4 years of starting 9th grade for the first time (table 13).29
• State adjusted cohort graduation rates for public school students: For the class of 2011–
12, the ACGR ranged from 59 percent in the District of Columbia to 89 percent in Iowa 
(figure 6 and table 13). Fifteen states had rates of 85 percent or higher: Connecticut, 85 
percent; Kansas, 85 percent; Maine, 85 percent; Massachusetts, 85 percent; Indiana, 86 
percent; Missouri, 86 percent; New Hampshire, 86 percent; New Jersey, 86 percent; North 
Dakota, 87 percent; Tennessee, 87 percent; Nebraska, 88 percent; Texas, 88 percent; 
Vermont, 88 percent; Wisconsin, 88 percent; Iowa, 89 percent. Only two states and the 
District of Columbia had rates below 70 percent: The District of Columbia, 59 percent; 
Nevada, 63 percent; Oregon, 68 percent. Finally, three states did not report ACGR data for 
2011–12: Idaho, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. These states have approved timeline extension 
requests to delay reporting of the ACGR. 
28 The disclosure mitigation methods applied to the 2011–12 ACGR and AFGR data require that rates be rounded to whole numbers.   
29 The United States 4-year ACGR was estimated using both the reported 4-year ACGR data from 47 states and the District of 
Columbia and using imputed data for Idaho, Kentucky, and Oklahoma. The Bureau of Indian Education and Puerto Rico were not 
included in the United States 4-year ACGR estimate.

NOTE: The event dropout rate indicates the percentage of youth ages 15 through 24 who dropped out of grades 10–12 
between one October and the next (e.g., October 2011 to October 2012). Dropping out is defined as leaving school 
without a high school diploma or alternative credential, such as a General Educational Development (GED) certificate. 
Low income is defined as the bottom 20 percent of all family incomes for the year; middle income is between 20 and 80 
percent of all family incomes; and high income is the top 20 percent of all family incomes. Data on family income are 
missing for 1974. Estimates beginning with 1987 reflect new editing procedures for cases with missing data on school 
enrollment items. Estimates beginning with 1992 reflect new wording of the educational attainment item. Estimates 
beginning with 1994 reflect changes due to newly instituted computer-assisted interviewing. For details about changes in 
the Current Population Survey (CPS) over time, please see Kaufman, P., Alt, M.N., and Chapman, C. (2004). Dropout

NOTE: The status dropout rate indicates the percentage of 16- through 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in high school 
and who lack a high school credential. High school credentials include high school diplomas and alternative credentials, 
such as a General Educational Development (GED) certificate. Beginning in 2003, respondents were able to identify 
themselves as being of Two or more races. The 2003 through 2012 categories for White, non-Hispanic; and Black, non-
Hispanic contain only respondents who indicated just one race. The Hispanic category includes Hispanics of all races and 
racial combinations. Due to small sample sizes for some or all of the years shown in the figure, Asians/Pacific Islanders 
and American Indians/Alaska Natives who are not Hispanic are included in the totals but not shown separately. The 
“Two or more races, non-Hispanic” category is also included in the total in 2003 through 2012 but not shown separately 
due to small sample sizes. The variability of Hispanic status rates reflects, in part, small sample size of Hispanics in 
earlier years of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Beginning with 1987, estimates reflect new editing procedures for 
cases with missing data on school enrollment items. Estimates beginning with 1992 reflect new wording of the educational 
attainment item. Estimates beginning with 1994 reflect changes due to newly instituted computer-assisted interviewing.

1 This is an estimate of the population of 15- through 24-year-olds enrolled during the previous year in high school based on the 
number of students still enrolled in the current year and the number of students who either graduated or dropped out the previous 
year. 
2 Respondents were able to identify themselves as being of Two or more races. The White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; 
and Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic categories consist of individuals who considered themselves to be one race and who did 
not identify as Hispanic. The Hispanic category consists of Hispanics of all races and racial combinations. Due to small sample 
size, American Indians/Alaska Natives and those who identified themselves as being of Two or more races, non-Hipanic are 
included in the total but are not shown separately. 
3 Low income is defined as the bottom 20 percent of all family incomes for the year; middle income is between 20 and 80 percent 
of all family incomes; and high income is the top 20 percent of all family incomes. In 2012, low income was defined as $18,400 
or less, and high income was defined as $90,824 or more. Cold deck imputation was used for families with missing income data 
(20.36 percent of the weighted sample).  
4 Age when a person dropped out may be 1 year younger, because the dropout event could occur at any time over a 12-month 
period. 
5 Individuals defined as “first generation” were born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, but one or both of their parents 
were born outside the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Individuals defined as “second generation or higher” were born in the 
50 states or the District of Columbia, as were both of their parents. 
6 Individuals identified as having a disability reported at least one of the following: difficulty hearing, seeing even when wearing 
glasses, walking or climbing stairs, dressing or bathing, doing errands alone, concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. 
NOTE: The event dropout rate indicates the percentage of youth ages 15 through 24 who dropped out of grades 10–12 between 
one October and the next (e.g., October 2011 to October 2012). Dropping out is defined as leaving school without a high school 
diploma or alternative credential, such as a General Educational Development (GED) certificate. Detail may not sum to totals 
because of rounding.

1 This is an estimate of the population of 15- through 24-year-olds enrolled during the previous year in high school based on the 
number of students still enrolled in the current year and the number of students who either graduated or dropped out the 
previous year. 
2 Estimates beginning in 1987 reflect new editing procedures for cases with missing data on school enrollment items. Estimates 
beginning in 1992 reflect new wording of the educational attainment item. Estimates beginning in 1994 reflect changes due to 
newly instituted computer-assisted interviewing. For details about changes in the Current Population Survey (CPS) over time, 
please see Kaufman, P., Alt, M.N., and Chapman, C. (2004). Dropout Rates in the United States: 2001 (NCES 2005-046). 
National Center for Education Statistics, Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. Washington, DC.  
NOTE: The event dropout rate indicates the percentage of youth ages 15 through 24 who dropped out of grades 10–12 between 
one October and the next (e.g., October 2011 to October 2012). Dropping out is defined as leaving school without a high school 
diploma or alternative credential, such as a General Educational Development (GED) certificate.

1 Beginning in 2003, respondents were able to identify themselves as being of Two or more races. The 2003 through 2012 
White, non-Hispanic; and Black, non-Hispanic categories consist of individuals who considered themselves to be one race and 
who did not identify as Hispanic. The Hispanic category includes Hispanics of all races and racial combinations. Due to small 
sample sizes for some or all of the years shown in the table, Asians/Pacific Islanders, non-Hispanic and American 
Indians/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic are included in the totals but not shown separately. The “Two or more races, non-
Hispanic” category is also included in the total in 2003 through 2012 but not shown separately due to small sample size.

NOTE: The event dropout rate indicates the percentage of youth ages 15 through 24 who dropped out of grades 10–12 between

diploma or alternative credential, such as a General Educational Development (GED) certificate. Some estimates differ from 
those in previously published reports because of data updates.

1 Low income is defined as the bottom 20 percent of all family incomes for the year; middle income is between 20 and 80 percent 
of all family incomes; and high income is the top 20 percent of all family incomes. In 2012, low income was defined as $18,400 
or less, and high income was defined as $90,824 or more. Cold deck imputation was used for families with missing income data 
(20.36 percent of the weighted sample).

— Not available. These states do not report dropouts that are consistent with the NCES definition. 
‡ Reporting standards not met. Dropout data were missing for more than 20 percent of grade total membership. 
1 Average event dropout rate for all reporting states. Prior to 2002–03, too few states reported to calculate a reporting states total. 
2 These states used an alternative calendar for each year shown, reporting students who drop out between one July and the next. The rates from 
both calendar approaches are comparable (see Winglee et al. 2000).  
3 The following states reported data using the alternative calendar of one July to the next in the years indicated: Alaska (1995–96 and 1999–2000 
through 2001–02); Hawaii (2000–01); Idaho (1993–94 through 1998–99); New York (1998–99 and 2000–01 through 2003–04); Ohio (1993–94); 
Oklahoma (1993–94 through 2000–01); South Dakota (1993–94 through 1998–99); Virginia (1993–94 through 1999–2000); Wisconsin (1993–
94 through 1996–97 and 1998–99); and Wyoming (1993–94). 
4 Data for 2008–09 for California and Nevada were imputed, due to item non-response, based on the prior year reported data. 
5 Effective in the 1995–96 school year, Louisiana changed its dropout data collection from school-level aggregate counts reported to districts to 
an individual student-record system. The apparent increase in the dropout rate is partly due to the resulting increased ability to track students. 
NOTE: These event dropout rates measure the percentage of public school students in grades 9–12 who dropped out of school between one 
October and the next (e.g., October 2011 to October 2012). Data are reported by states to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for 
Education Statistics. The Common Core of Data (CCD) includes public school students only. Some estimates differ from those in previously 
published reports because of updates to the estimates.

1 Respondents were able to identify themselves as being of Two or more races. The White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; 
Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic; and American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic categories consist of individuals who 
considered themselves to be one race and who did not identify as Hispanic. Non-Hispanics who identified themselves as 
multiracial are included in the “Two or more races, non-Hispanic” category. The Hispanic category consists of Hispanics of all 
races and racial combinations.  
2 Individuals defined as “first generation” were born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, but one or both of their parents 
were born outside the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Individuals defined as “second generation or higher” were born in the 
50 states or the District of Columbia, as were both of their parents. 
3 Individuals identified as having a disability reported at least one of the following: difficulty hearing, seeing even when wearing 
glasses, walking or climbing stairs, dressing or bathing, doing errands alone, concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. 
NOTE: The status dropout rate indicates the percentage of 16- through 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in high school and who 
lack a high school credential. High school credentials include high school diplomas and alternative credentials, such as a General 
Educational Development (GED) certificate. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1 Beginning in 2003, respondents were able to identify themselves as being of Two or more races. The 2003 through 2012 
White, non-Hispanic; and Black, non-Hispanic categories consist of individuals who considered themselves to be one race and 
who did not identify as Hispanic. The Hispanic category includes Hispanics of all races and racial combinations. Due to small 
sample sizes for some or all of the years shown in the table, Asians/Pacific Islanders, non-Hispanic and American 
Indians/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic are included in the totals but not shown separately. The “Two or more races, non-
Hispanic” category is also included in the total in 2003 through 2012 but not shown separately due to small sample size. 
2 Estimates beginning in 1987 reflect new editing procedures for cases with missing data on school enrollment items. Estimates

1 Institutionalized group quarters include adult and juvenile correctional facilities, nursing facilities, and other health care 
facilities.  
2 Noninstitutionalized group quarters include college and university housing, military quarters, facilities for workers and religious 
groups, and temporary shelters for the homeless. Among those counted in noninstitutionalized group quarters in the ACS, only 
the residents of military barracks are not included in the civilian noninstitutionalized population in the Current Population 
Survey.  
3 Total includes other race/ethnicity categories not separately shown. 
NOTE: This table uses a different data source than tables 6, 7, and 8; therefore, total status dropout rate estimates are not directly 
comparable to the 2012 estimates in tables 6, 7, and 8.

1 Respondents were able to identify themselves as being of Two or more races. The White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; 
Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic; and American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic categories consist of individuals who 
considered themselves to be one race and who did not identify as Hispanic. Non-Hispanics who identified themselves as 
multiracial are included in the “Two or more races, non-Hispanic” category. The Hispanic category consists of Hispanics of all 
races and racial combinations.  
2 Individuals defined as “first generation” were born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, but one or both of their parents 
were born outside the 50 states or the District of Columbia. Individuals defined as “second generation or higher” were born in 
the 50 states or the District of Columbia, as were both of their parents. 
3 Individuals identified as having a disability reported at least one of the following: difficulty hearing, seeing even when 
wearing glasses, walking or climbing stairs, dressing or bathing, doing errands alone, concentrating, remembering, or making 
decisions. 
NOTE: Status completion rates measure the percentage of 18- through 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in high school and 
who also hold a high school diploma or alternative credential, such as a General Educational Development (GED) certificate. 
Excludes those enrolled in high school or a lower education level. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1 Beginning in 2003, respondents were able to identify themselves as being of Two or more races. The 2003 through 2012 
White, non-Hispanic; and Black, non-Hispanic categories consist of individuals who considered themselves to be one race and 
who did not identify themselves as Hispanic. The Hispanic category includes Hispanics of all races and racial combinations. 
Due to small sample sizes for some or all of the years shown in the table, Asians/Pacific Islanders, non-Hispanic and American 
Indians/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic are included in the totals but not shown separately. The “Two or more races, non-
Hispanic” category is also included in the total in 2003 through 2012 but not shown separately due to small sample size.

1The United States 4-year ACGR was estimated using both the reported 4-year ACGR data from 47 states and the District of 
Columbia and using imputed data for Idaho, Kentucky, and Oklahoma. The Bureau of Indian Education and Puerto Rico were 
not included in the United States 4-year ACGR estimate. 
2The Department of Education’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education approved a timeline extension for these states 
to begin reporting 4-year ACGR data, resulting in the 4-year ACGR not being available for these states in SY 2011–12.

Rates: School Years 2010–11 and 2011–12. First Look. (NCES 2014-391), tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Census Bureau, Current Population Survey (CPS), October 2012. 
Common Core of Data 
The Common Core of Data (CCD) is NCES’s primary database on public elementary and 
secondary education in the United States. It is a comprehensive, annual, national statistical 
database of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts containing data 
designed to be comparable across all states. This database can be used to select samples for other 
NCES surveys and provide basic information and descriptive statistics on public elementary and 
secondary schools and schooling in general.  
The CCD collects statistical information annually from approximately 100,000 public 
elementary and secondary schools and approximately 18,000 public school districts (including 
supervisory unions and regional education service agencies) in the 50 states, the District of 
Columbia, Department of Defense (DoD) dependents schools, the Bureau of Indian Education, 
Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Three categories of information are collected in the CCD survey: general descriptive information 
on schools and school districts; data on students and staff; and fiscal data. The general descriptive 
information includes name, address, phone number, and type of locale; the data on students and 
staff include selected demographic characteristics; and the fiscal data pertain to revenues and 
current expenditures. 
The EDFacts data collection system is the primary collection tool for the CCD. 
Coordinators from state education agencies (SEAs) submit the CCD data at different levels (school, 
agency, and state) to the EDFacts collection system. Prior to submitting CCD files to EDFacts, 
SEAs must collect and compile information from their respective local education agencies (LEAs) 
through established administrative records systems within their state or jurisdiction.  
Once SEAs have completed their submissions, the CCD survey staff analyzes and verifies 
the data for quality assurance. Even though the CCD is a universe collection and thus not subject to 
sampling errors, nonsampling errors can occur. The two potential sources of nonsampling errors 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-3
are nonresponse and inaccurate reporting. NCES attempts to minimize nonsampling errors through 
the use of annual training of SEA coordinators, extensive quality reviews, and survey editing 
procedures. In addition, each year, SEAs are given the opportunity to revise their state-level 
aggregates from the previous survey cycle. 
NCES uses data from the CCD to calculate event dropout rates and averaged freshman 
graduation rates (AFGRs). The event dropout rate uses CCD enrollment data collected through 
EDFacts data group 39 within file 052 and CCD dropout counts collected through EDFacts data 
group 326 within file 032. The AFGR also uses CCD enrollment data as well as CCD graduate 
counts collected through EDFacts data group 306 within file 040. For more information about 
these data groups, please see file specifications 052, 032, and 040 for the relevant school years, 
available at http://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html.  
Defining and Calculating Event Dropout Rates Using the CCD 
In calculating the event dropout rate, high school dropouts for a given school year 
include students who were 
•
enrolled in school at some time during the school year;
•
expected to be in membership the following school year; and
•
not enrolled in grades 9–12 by October 1 of the following year.
Dropouts do not include students who were 
•
reported as a dropout the year before;
•
among students who graduated high school by completing the state graduation
requirements, receiving a high school equivalency credential without dropping out of
school, or completing a state or district-approved educational program;
•
confirmed as having transferred to another public school district, private school, or state
or district-approved educational program;
•
temporarily absent due to suspension or illness; or
•
deceased.
The high school event dropout rate is the number of dropouts divided by the number of 
students enrolled in grades 9–12 at the beginning of that school year. In cases where LEAs or 
SEAs report students and dropouts in an ungraded category, the National Center for Education 
Statistics (NCES) prorates ungraded students and dropouts into grades in order to calculate an 
aggregated dropout rate for 9th- through 12th-grade students.  
Not all states follow a fall-to-fall school year. The Common Core of Data (CCD) 
dropout count is based on an October–September school year in which a student’s dropout 
status is determined at the beginning of the year. Some states follow a July–June calendar in 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-4
which a student’s dropout status is determined at the end of the school year. Dropout rates in 
states that follow an alternative reporting calendar are comparable with rates for states that 
follow the October–September calendar (Winglee et al. 2000) and are included in the CCD data 
files.  
The CCD definition attributes dropouts to the grade and school year for which they do 
not meet their obligation. Students who complete 1 school year but fail to enroll in the next 
school year are counted as dropouts from the school year and grade for which they failed to 
return. For example, a student completing 10th grade in SY 2008–09 who does not enroll the 
next year would be reported as an 11th grade dropout for SY 2009–10.  
Students who leave high school to enroll in high school equivalency preparation 
programs are reported as dropouts, unless the district tracks these students and reports as 
dropouts those who fail to complete the program. If a high school equivalency program is an 
accepted high school credential in the state’s Data Usage and Availability, students who have 
received a high school equivalency by October 1 are not considered dropouts, regardless of 
where they prepared for the test. 
Defining and Calculating Averaged Freshman Graduation Rates Using the CCD 
The AFGR provides an estimate of the percentage of high school students who graduate 
within 4 years of first starting 9th grade. The rate uses aggregate student enrollment data to 
estimate the size of an incoming freshman class and counts of the number of diplomas awarded 
4 years later. The incoming freshman class size is estimated by summing the enrollment in 8th 
grade in year one, 9th grade for the next year, and 10th grade for the year after, and then 
dividing by three. The averaging has a smoothing effect that helps compensate for prior year 
retentions in the 8th-, 9th-, and 10th-grade enrollment counts. Although not as accurate as a 4-
year graduation rate computed from a cohort of students using student record data like the 
ACGR, the AFGR can be computed with widely available cross-sectional data. Based on a 
technical review and analysis of several 4-year graduation rates, the AFGR was selected as the 
most accurate indicator, excepting only the ACGR, from a number of alternative estimates that 
can be calculated using available cross-sectional data (Seastrom et al. 2006a, 2006b).  
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-5
The following formula provides an example of how the AFGR would be calculated for 
the graduating class of 2012:1
Number of regular high school diplomas awarded in SY 2010–12 
(The number or 8th-graders enrolled in the fall 2007 plus the 
number of 9th-graders enrolled in the fall 2008 plus the number 
of 10th-graders enrolled in the fall of 2009) divided by 3 
The AFGR was intended to address a lack of regular information about timeliness of 
graduating from public high schools. Precise measures of how long it takes for a student to 
graduate high school require data sources that follow the progress of each individual student 
over time. Until recently, most states lacked data systems that captured individual public-school 
student-level data over time. The AFGR was developed to utilize data that were available across 
the 50 states on a regular basis to provide a general and comparable measure of the percentage 
of public high school students who graduate with a regular high school diploma within 4 years 
of first entering 9th grade. The AFGR is useful for longitudinal analysis of graduation rates 
since the data used to generate the AFGR are available going back in time to at least the 1960s. 
State and local policies can affect the numbers of regular high school diploma recipients 
(REGDIP) reported. There are differences in what a regular high school diploma represents 
across states. EDFacts file specifications for both annual and cohort REGDIP define a regular 
diploma as the high school completion credential awarded to students who meet or exceed 
coursework and performance standards set by the state or other approving authority. While this 
language provides a definition of common intent, the requirements required to earn a high 
school diploma varies among states. States therefore have differing requirements for REGDIP 
in terms of required attendance, coursework requirements (Carnegie Units), and exit exams. 
EDFacts 
EDFacts is a centralized data collection through which SEAs submit K-12 education data 
to the U.S. Department of Education (ED). All data in EDFacts are organized into “data groups” 
and reported to ED using defined file specifications. Depending on the data group, SEAs may 
submit aggregate counts for the state as a whole, or detailed counts for individual schools or school 
districts. EDFacts does not collect student-level records. The entities that are required to report 
EDFacts data vary by data group, but may include the 50 states, District of Columbia, Department 
of Defense (DoD) dependent schools, the Bureau of Indian Education, Puerto Rico, American 
Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin islands. More information about 
EDFacts file specifications and data groups can be found at www.ed.gov/edfacts. 
1 Eighth-, 9th-, and 10th-grade enrollment was adjusted to include a prorated number of ungraded students using the ratio of the 
specified grade enrollment to the total graded enrollment. The same ratio was used to prorate ungraded students for the 
disaggregated enrollment counts (race/ethnicity and gender). 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-6
EDFacts is a universe collection and is not subject to sampling error, but nonsampling 
errors such as nonresponse and inaccurate reporting may occur. The U.S. Department of Education 
attempts to minimize nonsampling errors by training data submission coordinators and reviewing 
the quality of state data submissions. However, anomalies may still be present in the data. 
Differences in state data collection systems may limit the comparability of EDFacts data 
across states and across time. To build EDFacts files, SEAs rely on data that were reported by their 
schools and school districts. The systems used to collect these data are evolving rapidly and differ 
from state to state. 
In some cases EDFacts data may not align with data reported on SEA websites. States may 
update their websites on different schedules than they use to report to ED. Further, ED may use 
methods to protect the privacy of individuals represented within the data that could be different 
from the methods used by an individual state.  
EDFacts Four-Year adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR) data are collected in data 
groups 695 and 696 within files 150 and 151, respectively. EDFacts collects these data groups on 
behalf of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. For more information about these 
data groups, please see file specifications 150 and 151 for the relevant school year, available 
at http://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html.  
Defining and Calculating Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates 
The ACGR is calculated based on the number of students who graduate in 4 years or less 
with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted 
cohort for the graduating class. In order to calculate and report the 4-year ACGR states must 
follow the progress of each individual 9–12 grade student over time and maintain documentation of 
students who enter or leave schools or districts within their state. From the beginning of ninth 
grade (or the earliest high school grade) students who are entering that grade for the first time form 
a cohort that is “adjusted” by adding any students who subsequently transfer into the cohort from 
another state and subtracting any students who subsequently transfer out, emigrate to another 
country, or die. The following formula provides an example of how the 4-year adjusted cohort  
The ACGR rate for the 2011–12 class is formulated as follows: 
Number of cohort members who earned a  
regular high school diploma by the end of SY 2011–12 
Number of first-time 9th-graders in fall 2008 (starting cohort) plus students 
who transferred in, minus students who transferred out, emigrated, or died 
during school years 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, and 2011–12 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-7
SEAs report ACGR data for each school, LEA, and for the state total cohort rate. The 
methodology of the ACGR, as it was designed, allows for the movement or transfer of students 
from one school to another, while only counting each student once. A student may change schools 
and thus exit their prior school’s cohort and enter their new school’s cohort, but stay in the same 
district and state cohort. Similarly, a student who changes districts within a state will move to the 
new school and district for the ACGR, but will stay in the state’s cohort. In order to subtract or 
transfer a student out of a cohort, the school or LEA must have official written documentation that 
the student enrolled in another school or in an educational program that culminates in the award of 
a regular high school diploma. 
Unless specified, the ACGR data in this report and the associated data files reflect the data 
as reported by each SEA. The ACGRs required under the current Title I regulations are more 
comparable across states than were graduation rates submitted by SEAs under prior regulations. 
However, there has been some variation in the way that individual states have interpreted and 
understood the methodology specified in the statute. Examples of ways the calculated ACGR may 
vary among states include 
•
how students are identified for inclusion in certain subgroups;
•
how the beginning of the cohort is defined;
•
whether summer school students are included; and
•
the criteria of what constitutes a diploma that meet the regulatory definition of a regular
high school diploma.2
Current Population Survey 
The Current Population Survey (CPS) provides nationally representative data for the 
civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States. The survey is conducted in a 
sample of 50,000–60,000 households each month. Households are interviewed for four successive 
monthly interviews, are not interviewed for the next 8 months, and then are reinterviewed for the 
following 4 months. Typically, the first and the fifth interviews are conducted in person, with the 
remaining conducted via computer-assisted telephone interviewing. The sample frame is a 
complete list of dwelling-unit addresses at the time of the decennial Census updated by 
demolition and new construction listings. The population surveyed excludes members of the 
armed forces, inmates of correctional institutions, and patients in long-term medical or custodial 
facilities; it is referred to as the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The household-level 
nonresponse rate was 9.6 percent in the 2012 October basic CPS, and the person-level 
nonresponse rate for the school enrollment supplement was an additional 9.2 percent. These 
2 Under 34 C.F.R. § 200.19(b)(1)(iv) a regular high school diploma is defined as “the standard high school diploma that is awarded 
to students in the State and that is fully aligned with the State’s academic content standards or a higher diploma and does not include 
a high school equivalency credential, certificate of attendance, or any alternative award.” 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-8
rates cannot be combined to derive an overall person-level response rate. For more information, 
please see Current Population Survey, October 2012: School Enrollment and Internet Use 
Supplement File (U.S. Department of Commerce 2013). An adult member of each household 
serves as the respondent for that household, supplying basic monthly data for each member of 
the household. In addition, in October of each year, supplementary questions regarding school 
enrollment are asked about eligible household members age 3 and older. Data are collected about 
individuals who attend or attended public schools and private schools, who were homeschooled, 
or who never attended school in the United States. 
CPS data on educational attainment and enrollment status in the current year and prior year 
are used to identify dropouts and completers, and additional items in the CPS data are used to 
describe some of their basic characteristics. The CPS is the only source of national time series 
data on dropout and completion rates. However, because the CPS collects no information on 
school characteristics and experiences, its usefulness in addressing dropout and completion 
issues is primarily for providing insights on who drops out and who completes school. Sample 
sizes in the CPS collections do not support stable state-level estimates. 
There are important differences in data collection procedures between the CPS and the 
CCD. First, the CCD collection includes only data for public schools, whereas the CPS counts
include students who were enrolled in either public or private schools and some individuals who
were never enrolled in school in the United States. Second, the CCD collects data about students
from a given state’s public school system. CPS data are based on where individuals currently
reside, so the state of residence may differ from the state or country of earlier school attendance.
Third, the CCD collection includes dropouts in grades 7–12, versus grades 10–12 in the CPS
(although the CCD event rates are reported only for grades 9–12 in this report). Fourth, the CCD
collection is based on administrative records rather than on individual self-reports based on
household surveys, as in the CPS. Finally, data in the CCD are collected from the full universe of
public schools, whereas data in the CPS are collected from a sample of households, not the full
universe of households. As a result, CPS data have sampling errors associated with estimates,
whereas CCD data do not. For more information on CPS sampling errors and how to interpret
them, see “Statistical Procedures for Analyzing CPS-Based Estimates” below.
Defining and Calculating Dropout and Completion Rates Using the CPS 
Event Dropout Rates 
The October Supplement to the CPS is the only national data source that currently can be 
used to estimate annual national dropout rates. As a measure of recent dropout experiences, the 
event dropout rate measures the proportion of students who dropped out over a 1-year interval. 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-9
The numerator of the event dropout rate for 2012 is the number of persons ages 15–243
surveyed in October 2012 who were enrolled in grades 10–12 in October 2011, who were not 
enrolled in high school in October 2012, and who also did not complete high school (that is, had 
not received a high school diploma or an alternative credential such as a GED) between October 
2011 and October 2012. 
The denominator of the event dropout rate for 2012 is the sum of the dropouts (that is, the 
numerator) and all persons ages 15–24 who were attending grades 10–12 in October 2011, who 
were still enrolled in October 2012, or who graduated or completed high school between October 
2011 and October 2012. 
The dropout interval is defined to include the previous summer (in this case, the summer of 
2012) and the previous school year (in this case, the 2011 school year), so that once a grade is 
completed, the student is then at risk of dropping out of the next grade. Given that the data 
collection is tied to each person’s enrollment status in October of 2 consecutive years, any 
student who drops out and returns within the 12-month period is not counted as a dropout. 
Status Dropout Rates 
The status dropout rate reflects the percentage of individuals who are dropouts, regardless 
of when they dropped out. The numerator of the status dropout rate for 2012 is the number of 
individuals ages 16–244 who, as of October 2012, had not completed high school and were not 
currently enrolled. The denominator is the total number of 16- through 24-year-olds in October 
2012. 
Status Completion Rates 
The numerator of the high school status completion rate is the number of 18- through 24- 
year-olds5 who had received a high school diploma or an alternative credential such as a GED. 
The denominator is the number of 18- through 24-year-olds who are no longer in elementary or 
secondary school. 
GED Credentials and the Status Completion Rate. Prior to 2000, editions of this series of 
high school completion and dropout reports presented estimates of overall status completion 
rates and estimates of the method of completion—graduation by diploma or completion 
3 This age range was chosen in an effort to include as many students in grades 10-12 as possible. Because the rate is based on 
retrospective data, it is lagged 1 year, meaning that some 15-year-olds have turned age 16 by the time of the interview. 
4 Age 16 was chosen as the lower age limit because, in some states, compulsory education is not required after age 16. Age 24 was 
chosen as the upper limit because it is the age at which free secondary education is no longer available and the age at which the 
average person who is going to obtain a GED does so. 
5 Age 18 was chosen as the lower age limit because most diploma holders earn their diploma by this age. Age 24 was chosen as the 
upper limit because it is the age at which free secondary education is no longer available and the age at which the average person 
who is going to obtain a GED does so. 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-10 
through an alternative credential such as the GED—based on data obtained through CPS 
reporting. Because of changes in the CPS introduced in 2000, data on the method of 
completion were not comparable with prior-year CPS estimates and the method-of-completion 
data were no longer reported in NCES reports generally. Please see the discussion of the GED 
Testing Service data below for further information. 
Data Considerations for the CPS 
Over the last several decades, data collection procedures, items, and data preparation 
processes have changed in the CPS. Some of these changes were introduced to ensure that CPS 
estimates were comparable to those from decennial Census collections, some were introduced to 
reflect changes in the concepts under study, some were introduced to improve upon measures, 
and some were introduced to develop measures for new phenomena. The effects of the various 
changes have been studied to help ensure they do not disrupt trend data from the CPS. For a 
summary of the changes and studies of their effects, please see appendix C of Dropout Rates in 
the United States: 2001 (Kaufman, Alt, and Chapman 2004). 
CPS data include weights to help make estimates from the data representative of the 
civilian, noninstitutionalized population in the United States. These weights are based on 
decennial Census data that are adjusted for births, deaths, immigration, emigration, etc., over 
time. 
Imputation for Item Nonresponse in the CPS. For many key items in the October CPS, the 
U.S. Census Bureau imputes data for cases with missing data due to item nonresponse. However, 
the U.S. Census Bureau did not impute data regarding the method of high school completion 
before 1997. Special imputations were conducted for these items using a sequential hot deck 
procedure implemented through the PROC IMPUTE computer program developed by the 
American Institutes for Research. The hot-deck method assigns imputed values from survey 
respondents who answered an item (donors) to similar survey respondents who did not 
(recipients). Donors and recipients are matched based on various respondent characteristics. For 
the CPS data, three categories of age, two categories of race, two categories of sex, and two 
categories of citizenship were used to match donors with recipients for any given item. The 
procedure ensures that information from one donor is not used for a large number of 
recipients. This prevents bias from being introduced into the data set if all the recipients were 
imputed from one donor. 
Age and Grade Ranges in CPS Estimates. The age and grade ranges used in the CPS 
measures of dropout rates are constrained by available data. Ideally, the estimates would be able 
to capture reliable estimates of children in grades as low as grade 9. However, the CPS asks the 
question about enrollment in the previous October only about individuals age 15 and older. 
Many 9th-graders are younger than age 15, so 10th grade was selected as the lower boundary of

grade ranges in the event dropout rate. 
Accuracy of CPS Estimates. CPS estimates in this report are derived from samples and are 
subject to two broad classes of error—sampling and nonsampling error. Sampling errors occur 
because the data are collected from a sample of a population rather than from the entire 
population. Estimates based on a sample will differ to some degree (dependent largely on sample 
size and coverage) from the values that would have been obtained from a universe survey using 
the same instruments, instructions, and procedures. Nonsampling errors come from a variety of 
sources and affect all types of surveys—universe as well as sample surveys. Examples of sources 
of nonsampling error include design, reporting, and processing errors and errors due to 
nonresponse. The effects of nonsampling errors are more difficult to evaluate than those that 
result from sampling variability. As much as possible, procedures are built into surveys in order 
to minimize nonsampling errors. 
The standard error is a measure of the variability due to sampling when estimating a 
parameter. It indicates how much variance there is in the population of possible estimates of a 
parameter for a given sample size. Standard errors can be used as a measure of the precision 
expected from a particular sample. The probability that a sample statistic would differ from a 
population parameter by less than the standard error is about 68 percent. The chances that the 
difference would be less than 1.65 times the standard error are about 90 out of 100, and the 
chances that the difference would be less than 1.96 times the standard error are about 95 out of 100. 
Prior to 2010, standard errors for percentages and numbers of persons based on CPS data 
were calculated using the following formulas: 
Percentage: 
where p          =  the percentage (0 < p < 100), 
N         =  the population on which the percentage is based, and 
b 
=  the regression parameter, which is based on a generalized 
variance formula and is associated with the characteristic. 
Number of persons: 
where x 
=  the number of persons (i.e., dropouts), 
T 
=  population in the category (e.g., Black 16- to 24-year-olds), and 
b 
=  as above. 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-12
For instance, in 2009, b is equal to 2,131 for the total and White population, 2,410 for the 
Black population, 2,744 for the Hispanic population, and 2,410 for the Asian/Pacific Islander 
population ages 14–24. For regional estimates, b is equal to 1.06 for the Northeast, 1.06 for the 
Midwest, 1.07 for the South, and 1.02 for the West. 
CPS documentation explains the purpose and process for the generalized variance 
parameter:  
Experience has shown that certain groups of estimates have similar relations 
between their variances and expected values. Modeling or generalizing may 
provide more stable variance estimates by taking advantage of these 
similarities. The generalized variance function is a simple model that 
expresses the variance as a function of the expected value of a survey 
estimate. The parameters of the generalized variance function are estimated 
using direct replicate variances. (Cahoon 2005, p. 7) 
Beginning with the 2010 CPS data, standard errors were estimated using Fay’s Balanced 
Repeated Replication (Fay-BRR). While the generalized variance model provides a comprehensive 
calculation for standard errors, BRR better accounts for the two-stage stratified sampling process of 
the CPS; where the first stage of the CPS Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) is the geographic area, 
such as a metropolitan area, county, or group of counties. The second stage is households within 
these geographic areas. By its use alone, BRR estimates standard errors using half sample variance 
calculations; where half of the weights are multiplied by zero and the other half are multiplied by 
two. With Fay-BRR, estimates are provided through a perturbation factor, where ƒ (0 ≤ ƒ < 1). One 
half of the sample is weighted by a specified factor and the second half is multiplied by 2 minus 
that factor. For the CPS October supplement, 160 replicate weights were used in Fay-BRR 
calculations.  
American Community Survey 
The Census Bureau began fielding the American Community Survey (ACS) in 1996, testing 
various data collection and sampling options. Data necessary to generate national level statistics for 
households and individuals not living in group quarters became available with the 2000 collection. 
Full data collection for the U.S. population outside of group quarters began with the 2005 ACS 
collections. Beginning that year and continuing through the present, the survey has been mailed to 
approximately 250,000 residential addresses in the United States and Puerto Rico each month. The 
survey collects household and individual demographic, socioeconomic, and housing data 
comparable in content to the Long Form of the Decennial Census. Survey content is primarily 
determined by federal law, federal regulations, and court decisions. Monthly data are aggregated to 
provide annual estimates. Estimates for single months are not supported.  
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-13
In 2006, ACS sampling was expanded to include those living in group quarters. Annual 
results are available for areas with populations of 65,000 or more beginning with the 2006 data. 
Estimates for populations and areas with populations of 20,000 or more require 3 years of 
aggregated ACS data. The first such estimates became possible with the 2008 collections. 
Estimates for smaller populations and geographic areas the size of Census tracts require 5 years of 
aggregated ACS data and first became possible with the 2010 ACS collections. Note that estimates 
of the population not in group quarters can be generated beginning with the 2005 data for 
populations and areas with 65,000 or more members, and one year earlier for estimates requiring 3 
and 5 years of data, respectively (U.S. Department of Commerce 2009). 
Data Considerations for the ACS 
Estimates in this report from the ACS focus on status dropout rates for the institutionalized 
population, and for the noninstitutionalized population. The rates are derived using the same 
approach as that used for estimating status dropout rates from the CPS data. ACS data include 
weights to make estimates from the data representative of households and individuals in the United 
States. These weights are based on annual population updates generated by the Census Bureau to 
be representative of the U.S. population as of July 1. Replicate weights are also developed for use 
in derivation of variance estimates that account for the complex sample design of the study. Data 
are fully imputed before release to the public and flags are available to identify which values have 
been imputed for which cases.  
Statistical Procedures for Analyzing CPS- and ACS-Based Estimates 
Because CPS and ACS data are collected from samples of the population, statistical tests 
are employed to measure differences between estimates to help ensure they are taking into 
account possible sampling error.6 The descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using 
Student’s t statistic. Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a type I 
error,7 or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the 
Student’s t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing 
these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. 
Student’s t values may be computed to test the difference between percentages with the 
following formula: 
6 The CCD and GEDTS data are universe data collections and therefore do not require statistical testing, such as that used for 
estimates from the CPS sample survey data. 
7 A Type I error occurs when one concludes that a difference observed in a sample reflects a true difference in the population from 
which the sample was drawn, when no such difference is present. It is sometimes referred to as a “false positive.” 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-14
where P1 and P2 are the estimates to be compared and se1 and se2 are their corresponding 
standard errors. 
Several points should be considered when interpreting t statistics. First, comparisons based 
on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the 
magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or proportions 
but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a 
small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large t statistic. 
Second, there is a possibility that one can report a “false positive” or type I error. In the 
case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference measured with a particular 
sample showed a statistically significant difference when there was no difference in the 
underlying population. Statistical tests are designed to control this type of error. These tests are 
set to different levels of tolerance or risk, known as alphas. The alpha level of .05 selected for 
findings in this report indicates that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be 
produced no more than 1 time out of 20 when there was no actual difference between the 
quantities in the underlying population. When p values are smaller than the .05 level, the null 
hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities is rejected. Finding no 
difference, however, does not necessarily imply that the values are the same or equivalent. 
Third, the probability of a type I error increases with the number of comparisons being 
made. Bonferroni adjustments are sometimes used to correct for this problem. Bonferroni 
adjustments do this by reducing the alpha level for each individual test in proportion to the 
number of tests being done. However, while Bonferroni adjustments help avoid type I errors, 
they increase the chance of making type II errors. Type II errors occur when there actually is a 
difference present in a population, but a statistical test applied to estimates from a sample 
indicates that no difference exists. Prior to the 2001 report in this series, Bonferroni adjustments 
were employed. Because of changes in NCES reporting standards, Bonferroni adjustments are 
not employed in this report. 
Regression analysis was used to test for trends across age groups and over time. Regression 
analysis assesses the degree to which one variable (the dependent variable) is related to one or 
more other variables (the independent variables). The estimation procedure most commonly used 
in regression analysis is ordinary least squares (OLS). When studying changes in rates over time, 
the rates were used as dependent measures in the regressions, with a variable representing time 
and a dummy variable controlling for changes in the educational attainment item in 1992 (= 0 for 
years 1972 to 1991, = 1 after 1992) used as independent variables. Significant and positive slope 
coefficients suggest that rates increased over time. Conversely, significant and negative 
coefficients suggest that rates decreased over time. Because of varying sample sizes over time, 
some of the estimates were less reliable than others (i.e., some years’ standard errors were larger 
than those for other years). In such cases, OLS estimation procedures do not apply, and it is 
necessary to modify the regression procedures to obtain unbiased regression parameters. This is 
 Appendix A—Technical Notes
A-15
accomplished by using weighted least squares regressions.8 Each variable in the analysis was 
transformed by dividing by the standard error of the relevant year’s rate. The new dependent 
variable was then regressed on the new time variable, a variable for 1 divided by the standard 
error for the year’s rate, and the new editing-change dummy variable. All statements about trend 
changes in this report are statistically significant at the .05 level. 
GED Testing Service 
The GED Testing Service (GEDTS) collects data on individuals who take the GED exam 
each year and on individuals who pass the exam each year. These data are collected from test 
sites both in the United States and internationally. The GEDTS releases the data in aggregate 
form in annual statistical reports. The reports are organized to allow readers to differentiate 
between those individuals taking and passing the exam in the United States and those taking and 
passing the exam outside of the United States. Though GEDTS designs and administers the 
exams, many related policies are set by states and sometimes jurisdictions within a state. For 
example, determinations of who can take the exam, how much preparation is required, how and 
when the exam can be retaken, how much the exam costs, and the official name of the resulting 
credential is set by states and sometimes jurisdictions within a state 
(see http://www.gedtestingservice.com/testers/2014policypages for details). 
Prior to 2000, NCES completion and dropout reports presented estimates of those holding 
alternative credentials, such as GEDs, directly from CPS data as part of the status completion 
rate. Examination of the changes in the CPS alternative credential items in the October 2000 and 
subsequent surveys has indicated that these estimates may not be reliable estimates of alternative 
high school completions.9 Therefore, CPS estimates of the method of alternative high school 
completion are no longer presented in NCES reports. Because GED recipients do have notably 
different life experiences than those with no high school credential and those with a regular high 
school diploma, the loss of information about alternative credential holders was an important 
measurement problem. In response, NCES developed an approach for using GEDTS to estimate 
how many young people in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population in a given age range had 
earned a GED by passing the GED exam. It is important to acknowledge here that Mishel and 
Roy (2006) simultaneously and independently developed a similar approach for research that 
they were conducting. 
Table A-2 provides a summary of the data released by GEDTS on the number of people 
passing the exam each year and the age distribution of those passing the exam (American

Council on Education, GED Testing Service 1991–2002, 2003–06, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 
2011, 2012). Data from GEDTS are provided for those in the general population for the 50 
states and the District of Columbia, and separately for facilities that would not be included in 
the CPS sampling frame (referred to as state and federal contract facilities in the table title). 
For the U.S. population, GEDTS indicates that approximately 205,000 persons ages 18–24 
passed the GED in 2012. The GED status rate indicates the percentage of individuals in a 
given age range who passed the GED exam irrespective of when they passed the exam.10 In 
order to derive the GED status rate, data from several GEDTS reports were combined. For 
18- through 24-year-olds, this was done by adding the count of 18- through 24-year-olds who
passed the exam in 2012 to counts of people who were ages 18–24 in 2012, but who passed
the exam in earlier years. The number of 18- through 24-year-olds who passed the exam in
2012 was added to the number of 17- through 23-year-olds who passed the exam in 2011.
That sum was added to the number of 16- through 22-year-olds who passed the exam in
2010, the number of 16- through 21-year-olds who passed the exam in 2009, the number of
16- through 20-year-olds who passed the exam in 2008, the number of 16- through 19-year-
olds who passed the exam in 2007, the number of 16- through 18-year-olds who passed the
exam in 2006, the number of 16- and 17-year-olds who passed the exam in 2005, and the
number of 16-year-olds who passed the exam in 2004. Sixteen-year-olds in 2004 would have
been 24 in 2012. Based on this approach, approximately 1,618,000 persons ages 18 through
24 held a GED in 2012.
Because the CPS-based status rates developed for this report focus on individuals in the 
civilian, noninstitutionalized population, adjustments were made to the GED count estimates. 
GED count data are reported by year the GED was earned, whereas the status rates reflect the 
experience of individuals over multiple-year periods. As such, individuals might have been part 
of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population when they earned a GED, and subsequently 
joined the military or the prison populations. Alternatively, individuals might have been in the 
military or in prison when they earned a GED and subsequently reentered the civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population. To account for both possibilities, information for those passing 
the exams in facilities that are not part of the CPS sampling frame were drawn from GEDTS 
reports (table A-3), adjusted in the same way as the data from table A-2 and combined with 
those data. Combining information from tables A-2 and A-3 provides counts of individuals 
who were 18–24-years-old in 2012, irrespective of where they were when they took the exams. 
The combined data were then adjusted to account for the possibility that by 2012, those 
who passed the GED in civilian, noninstitutionalized settings might no longer be in that 
population, and those who passed the exams while on active duty military or while in 
institutionalized group quarters might now be in the civilian noninstitutionalized population. To 
make these adjustments, data for current active-duty military personnel for 2012 were obtained 
10 The GED Testing Service reports 20- through 24-year-olds as one age group. Single year of age data for those in the 20- to 24-
year-old group was estimated by dividing the group count by 5 in a given year.

from the Defense Manpower Data Center, and data for those in prisons and jails were estimated 
from the Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2004 (U.S. 
Department of Justice 2004). More recent prison data, including inmate educational attainment, 
were not available. Rates of inmates holding GEDs was derived from the 2004 correctional 
facility data. The rates were then applied to 2012 prison data that contained prison inmate age 
distributions (table A-3). Prison data for 2012 were drawn from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 
Prison Inmates at Midyear–2012 (U.S. Department of Justice 2013). After these adjustments, 
the estimated number of 18- through 24-year-old individuals in the civilian, noninstitutionalized 
population holding a GED in 2012 was approximately 1,540,000. A similar approach was used 
to estimate the number of 16- to 24-year-olds in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population 
holding a GED in 2012. Note, adjustments for other institutionalized group quarters that might 
affect the relationship between the GEDTS and CPS data could not be directly estimated.

‡ Reporting standards not met. Reported number of graduates exceeded grade 12 membership. 
1 Reporting states totals include any of the 50 states and the District of Columbia that reported all data elements. 
2 Due to item non-response, data for California and Nevada were imputed based on prior year reported data. 
3 New Hampshire included homeschooled students in reported membership in 2000–01. This could inflate the denominator for 
the AFGR in 2002–03, 2003–04, and 2004–05 slightly. 
4 Data for Connecticut are imputed due to unusually high diploma counts that were unconfirmed by the state. 
5 Maine’s estimated first-time 9th graders were edited to include 1,419 9th grade, publicly funded private school students that 
were not reported as 9th graders on the 2006–07 Common Core of Data (CCD) but were reported as 10th graders in 2007–08 
and as diploma recipients in 2009–10. 
NOTE: The averaged freshman graduation rate (AFGR) is an estimate of the percentage of an entering freshman class 
graduating in 4 years. For 2011–12, it equals the total number of diploma recipients in 2011–12 divided by the average 
membership of the 8th-grade class in 2007–08, the 9th-grade class in 2008–09, and the 10th-grade class in 2009–10. Ungraded 
students were allocated to individual grades proportionally to the reported enrollments by grade.

For definitions of dropout and completion rate estimates, please see the discussions above 
and table A-1. 
Age. This represents the age of the subject at the time of data collection. 
Disability. In the Current Population Survey (CPS), individuals are identified as having a 
disability if they were reported to have difficulty with at least one of the following: 
hearing, seeing even when wearing glasses, walking or climbing stairs, dressing or 
bathing, doing errands alone, concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. 
Family income. In the Current Population Survey (CPS), family income is derived from a 
single question asked of the household respondent. Income includes money income 
from all sources, including jobs, business, interest, rent, and social security payments. 
The income of nonrelatives living in the household is excluded, but the income of all 
family members 14 years old and older, including those temporarily living away, is 
included. Family income refers to receipts over a 12-month period. 
There are several issues that affect the interpretation of dropout rates by family income 
using the CPS. First, it is possible that the family income of the students at the time 
they dropped out was somewhat different from their family income at the time of the 
CPS interview. Furthermore, family income is derived from a single question asked of 
the household respondent in the October CPS. In some cases, there are persons ages 
15–24 living in the household who are unrelated to the household respondent, yet 
whose family income is defined as the income of the family of the household 
respondent. Therefore, the current family income of the respondent may not accurately 
reflect that person’s family background. In particular, some of the young adults in the 
15- through 24-year age range do not live in a family unit with a parent present.
GED, or General Educational Development. General Educational Development (GED) 
tests are standardized tests designed to measure the skills and knowledge that students 
normally acquire by the end of high school. The tests are developed by the American 
Council on Education’s GED Testing Service. People who pass may receive an 
alternative high school credential. 
Geographic regions. There are four Census regions used in this report: Northeast, 
Midwest, South, and West. The Northeast consists of Maine, New Hampshire, 
Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and 
Pennsylvania. The Midwest consists of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, 
Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas. The 
 Appendix B—Glossary 
B-2
South consists of Delaware, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, West 
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, 
Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. The West consists 
of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, 
Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii. 
Recency of immigration. Recency of immigration was derived from a set of questions on 
the CPS survey inquiring about the country of birth of the reference person and his or 
her mother and father. From these questions, the following three categories were 
constructed: (1) born outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia, (2) first 
generation, and (3) second generation or higher. “First generation” is defined as 
individuals who were born in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, but who 
had at least one parent who was not. “Second generation or higher” refers to 
individuals who themselves, as well as both of their parents, were born in one of the 50 
states or the District of Columbia. These three categories were subdivided using the 
variable for the subject’s race/ethnicity (see below), so that there were six categories: 
the three immigration categories plus a Hispanic and non-Hispanic category for each of 
the three immigration categories. 
Race/ethnicity. This variable is constructed from two variables in the CPS. One asks about 
the subject’s ethnic background and the second asks about the subject’s race. Those 
reported as being of Hispanic background on the ethnic background question are 
categorized as Hispanic, irrespective of race. Non-Hispanics are then categorized by 
race. Beginning in 2003, respondents were able to indicate two or more races. Those 
who indicated two or more races and who did not indicate that they were Hispanic are 
categorized as “Two or more races, non-Hispanic.” 
Sex. This represents the sex of the subject.
