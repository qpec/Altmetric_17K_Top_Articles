Patients with metastatic melanoma rarely display tumor- 
specific immune cells sufficient for thwarting disease progres-
sion (Restifo et al., 2012). Adoptive transfer of autologous 
peripheral blood (PB)–derived, antigen-specific T cells can 
increase the frequency of melanoma-specific T cells with a 
very tolerable safety profile (Y
ee et al., 2002; Wallen et al., 
2009; Chapuis et al., 2012). When used as monotherapy, this 
approach has been effective in delaying disease progression. 
But sustained, complete tumor regression is rare, in part due 
to the short in vivo survival of transferred cells, as well as in-
hibitory signals limiting full T cell activation (Y
ee et al., 2002; 
Wallen et al., 2009; Chapuis et al., 2012).
Antibodies that block human CTL–associated antigen 
4 (CTLA4) function in part by preventing inhibitory sig-
nals after antigen-specific engagement of the TCR, releasing 
the brake on the population of extant tumor-specific CTL 
(Sharma et al., 2011). Used alone, CTLA4 blockade produces 
disease control in 22% of patients with metastatic melanoma 
(Hodi et al., 2010; Schadendorf et al., 2015). However, dura-
ble complete remissions (CRs), reflecting the development 
of long-term immune-mediated tumor control, have been 
observed in a minority of patients (range 0–7%; Hodi et al., 
2010; Prieto et al., 2012; Wolchok et al., 2013). Most non-
responders do not benefit from additional courses of anti- 
CTLA4 (Wolchok et al., 2013).
As the quality and magnitude of T cell responses 
prompted by anti-CTLA4 alone is usually insufficient to 
eradicate the tumor, we hypothesized that an ex vivo source 
of melanoma-reactive CTL might not only provide sufficient 
substrate for anti-CTLA4 to enhance tumor lysis, but also 
trigger the development of de novo responses to nontargeted 
antigens (epitope spreading; Ribas et al., 2003).
T
o generate tumor-specific CTL with enhanced in vivo 
persistence, we primed antigen-specific cells in vitro in the 
Adoptive transfer of peripheral blood–derived, melanoma-reactive CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) alone is generally 
insufficient to eliminate bulky tumors. Similarly, monotherapy with anti-CTLA4 infrequently yields sustained remissions in 
patients with metastatic melanoma. We postulated that a bolus of enhanced IL-21–primed polyclonal antigen-specific CTL 
combined with CTLA4 blockade might boost antitumor efficacy. In this first-in-human case study, the combination successfully 
led to a durable complete remission (CR) in a patient whose disease was refractory to both monoclonal CTL and anti-CTLA4. 
Long-term persistence and sustained anti-tumor activity of transferred CTL, as well as responses to nontargeted antigens, 
confirmed mutually beneficial effects of the combined treatment. In this first-in-human study, Chapuis et al. demonstrate that 
the combination of adoptive cellular therapy with CTLA4 blockade induces long-term remission in a melanoma patient resis-
tant to both modalities administered serially and individually.

and selected polyclonal CTL from autologous melanoma-

Clinical evaluation
This 53-yr-old male presented with stage III melanoma on 
his lower right thigh. He underwent wide local excision and 
inguinal node dissection (Clark level 4, Breslow 1.5 mm, no 
ulceration, 3/8 lymph nodes involved), followed by 12 mo of 
adjuvant IFN-α treatment. 4 yr later, he developed metastatic 
disease with supraclavicular, subcarinal, and right hilar masses 
uniformly positive for melanoma tumor antigen 1 (MART1). 
In anticipation of adoptive transfer studies, his PBMCs were 
collected. He then received four cycles of high-dose IL-2, but 
experienced disease progression.
He received two infusions of monoclonal MART1- 
specific T cells (1010 cells/m2) 30 d apart, each followed by 
low-dose s.c. IL-2 (250,000 U/m2 every 12 h). The second 
infusion was preceded by selective CD25hi T regulatory cell 
depletion (denileukin diftitox); the melanoma progressed. 
The 
patient received anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody (ipilim-
umab 3 mg/kg × 4 doses) that partially slowed tumor growth 
initially, but 4 mo later, he developed new metastases.
Finally, he received IL-21–primed polyclonal MART
-1–
specific T cells at a dose of 1010/m2, immediately followed by 
a single course of ipilimumab (same dosing as above; Pollack 
et al., 2014). The T cell infusion was preceded by low-dose 
cyclophosphamide (CY) conditioning (300 mg/m2 × 1) and 
followed by a 2-wk course of low-dose s.c. IL-2. Although 
the entire regimen could be administered in the ambulatory 
setting, he was hospitalized for monitoring of potential cell 
infusion–associated adverse events (AEs).
No serious AEs were observed, apart from expected 
transient (<24 h) culture-negative fevers (≥38.3°C) asso-
ciated with CTL-induced cytokine release syndrome, and 
lymphopenia lasting 10 d (Chapuis et al., 2013). Before CTL 
infusions (Fig. 1 A), the patient presented with PET+ sub-
carinal and right hilar masses (Fig. 1, B and C). Serial im-
aging demonstrated progressive disease after the first course 
of CTL infusions, followed by ipilimumab monotherapy. The 
patient had bulky disease in the paratracheal, supraclavicu-
lar, and subcarinal regions at the time the combined therapy 
with IL-21–primed, polyclonal MART
-1–specific 
T cells plus 
ipilimumab was initiated. 12 wk (day 384) after the start of 
the combined treatment, progressive tumor reduction was as-
sociated with the development of vitiligo (Fig. 1 D), manifest 
as depigmentation of the eyebrows and eyelashes. The patient 
achieved a CR by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 
(REC 
IST) and immune-related response criteria (Wolchok 
et al., 2009) at year 3, and remains disease-free 5 yr later, with 
no additional therapy or long-term immune side effects other 
than persistent vitiligo.
Persistence, clonality, phenotype, and function of 
monoclonal and polyclonal CTL in vivo
The first course of monoclonal MART1-specific CTL 
yielded a peak CTL frequency of 2.1% of total CD8+ T 
cells 1 d after the second infusion; CTL rapidly disappeared. 
Combined therapy resulted in a 4% peak 1 wk after infu-
sion and frequencies of 1.2 and 4% 2 and 4 yr later, respec-
tively (Fig. 2 A). Tracking of the monoclonal CTL (clone 
120; Fig. 2 B, inset pie chart), using high-throughput TCRβ 
sequencing (HTT 
CS), confirmed that the peak response was 
a result of the infused clone, which was not detected in pre-
infusion PBMC samples or in PBMC samples taken at any 
time point after day 29 (Fig. 2 B, graph). Polyclonal CTL 
included 13 clonotypes with frequencies >0.1% (Fig. 2 C, 
inset pie chart). HTT 
CS tracking revealed that one clonotype 
(TCR-1) represented the majority of detected antigen-spe-
cific CTL after infusions (Fig. 2 C, graph). T
o assess pheno-
typic and functional differences that could account for the 
preferential survival of long-lived IL-21-primed CTL, com-
pared with monoclonal CTL, we assessed surface expression 
of markers associated with long-lived memory 
T cells (CD28, 
CD62L, C-C Chemokine Receptor 7 [CCR7]), activation/
exhaustion (programmed cell death protein 1 [PD1]), and 
function (IFN-γ, TNF
, and IL-2 production in response to 
cognate antigen). The polyclonal CTL product expressed 
CD28 (55.1%) and low PD1 (12%), and produced IFN-γ, 
TNF
, and IL-2 (Fig. 2 D, top graph), whereas monoclonal 
CTL expressed none of the memory markers, a higher frac-
tion of PD1 (44%), and produced only IFN-γ in response 
to cognate antigen (Fig. 2 D, bottom graph). After adoptive 
transfer, the polyclonal CTL additionally expressed CD62L 
in vivo (Fig. 2 E). After 12 wk (day 385), they expressed all 
three memory markers (CD28, CD62L, and CCR7), main-
tained low PD1 expression (12%) and produced IFN-γ, TNF
, 
and IL-2 in response to cognate antigen (Fig. 2 F), all features 
consistent with central memory T cells (Restifo et al., 2012).
Response to nontargeted antigens (antigen spreading)

A3, independent of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
restriction, was tested at indicated time points throughout the 
patient’s treatment course (Fig. 3). PBMCs taken before and 
up to 80 d after the first infusion of monoclonal CTL showed 
low/no reactivity to the overlapping peptides (<10 IFN-γ 
spots/105 PBMC). After the initial ipilimumab treatment,

antigen-spreading was still not detected (day 295). However, 
6, 12, and 27 wk (days 349, 390, and 495) after the start of 
combined therapy the patient developed a marked response 
to multiple peptides within each melanoma-associated pro-
tein. Frequencies matched or exceeded MART1-specific 
responses in some cases, suggesting antigen spreading, coinci-
dent with a >80% reduction in tumor burden (Fig. 1).
Thus, we have shown that IL-21–primed, polyclonal 
MART1-specific CTLs plus ipilimumab achieved com-
plete, durable tumor eradication with minimal side effects 
in a patient whose melanoma was refractory to monoclo-
nal MART1-specific CTL and subsequent single-agent ip-
ilimumab. Although the immune component responsible 
for tumor eradication cannot be precisely determined here, 
our observations elucidate three critical factors for immune- 
mediated tumor regression.
First, polyclonal IL-21–primed CTLs achieved higher 
peak frequencies and longer persistence in vivo, compared 
with identical doses of monoclonal CTLs. Reduced ex vivo 
manipulation (≤6 wk vs. ≥12 wk) plus IL-21 addition during 
priming (Pollack et al., 2014) generated CTLs that had un-
dergone fewer divisions and had characteristics associated 
with enhanced survival. Specifically, expression of CD28 and 
a retained capacity to secrete IL-2 after exposure to cognate 
antigen (T
opp et al., 2003) likely facilitated the robust per-
sistence of transferred tumor-specific cells.
Second, ipilimumab exposure likely enhanced the anti-
tumor activity of the transferred cells. By enabling unob-

structed engagement of B7 with CD28 (instead of CTLA4), 
the CD28+ CTL subset may have preferentially survived/ex-
panded through continued production/secretion of autocrine 
IL-2. Consistent with this hypothesis, CTL examined in vivo 
months after transfer nearly all expressed CD28+, retained the 
capacity to secrete IL-2 in response to cognate antigen, and 
had low PD1 expression (Freeman et al., 2000). In contrast, 
CD28–, IL-2–, and PD1hi monoclonal cells did not survive

beyond 1 d after transfer without ipilimumab exposure. With 
ipilimumab, the transferred cells further acquired the canon-
ical markers of long-lived memory cells CD62L and CCR7, 
suggesting that the remaining cells were now programmed to 
persist (Unsoeld et al., 2002; Wölfl et al., 2011).
Finally, the targeted immune response provided by 
tumor-specific CTLs, plus the proinflammatory context 
fostered by anti-CTLA4 blockade, were both required for 
epitope spreading (Ribas et al., 2003). Whereas epitope 
spreading has been demonstrated in some patients receiv-
ing anti-CTLA4 antibody monotherapy (Kvistborg et al., 
2014), no evidence of antigen spreading or a clinical re-
sponse was evident in this patient before receiving the 
combination therapy. Although delayed responses can occur 
after ipilimumab alone, this usually occurs by 3 mo (Wol-
chok et al., 2009). Our patient demonstrated unequivocal 
disease progression with the appearance of a new lesion 7 
mo after ipilimumab monotherapy. As melanoma is a highly 
mutated tumor, antigen-spreading may have increased the 
number and strength of T cells targeting multiple anti-
gens beyond the ones assessed here (Schreiber et al., 2011). 
Multivalent responses may have blocked the outgrowth 
of antigen-loss tumor variants such that complete tumor 
eradication could occur.
We conclude that combining CTLA4 blockade with 
the transfer of well-characterized, robust antitumor CTLs 
represents an encouraging strategy to enhance the activity 
of the adoptively transferred CTL and induce de novo anti-
tumor responses. This strategy may hold broad promise for 
immune checkpoint blockade-resistant melanomas.

Clinical protocols. 
 All clinical investigations were conducted 
according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. This pa-
tient was first enrolled in protocol FHC 
RC #2271 (mono-
clonal CTL plus denileukin diftitox, three patients treated), 
then #2225 (polyclonal CTL plus ipilimumab, 10 patients 
treated). Of the 10 patients treated on protocol #2225, two, 
including the patient described here, achieved ongoing 
CRs (beyond 12 wk), two achieved partial responses, three 
achieved stable disease, and three had progressed at 12 wk. 
Both protocols were approved by the FHC 
RC Institutional 
Review Board and the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion and were registered at MD Anderson Clinical Trials as 
NCT00945269 and NCT00871481.

The second infusion was preceded by Ontak (18 mcg/kg i.v. 
6, 4, and 2 d before infusion), and both infusions were fol-
lowed by low-dose IL-2 (250,000 U/m2 s.c. twice daily for 
14 d). In protocol #2225, the patient received CY (300 mg/
m2 i.v.) before the infusion of 1010 polyclonal, IL-21–primed 
(Pollack et al., 2014) MART127-35 CTL/m2, immediately fol-
lowed by low-dose s.c. IL-2 and ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 
3 wk × 4 doses; Hodi et al., 2010). Radiological responses 
were evaluated according to the mWHO-based immune- 
related response criteria (Wolchok et al., 2009).
Isolation and expansion of monoclonal MART1-specific CTLs 
(without IL-21). 
 PBMCs were collected by leukapheresis, and 
all ensuing ex vivo manipulations were performed in the clin-
ical Good Manufacturing Practices Cell Processing Facility of 
the FHC 
RC. Donor PBMCs were stimulated three times for 
7–10-d cycles with autologous DCs pulsed with the 
HLA*0201-restricted MART
-126-35 (EAA 
GIG 
ILTV) peptide 
(Anaspec) at a DC to effector ratio of 1:2–10 to obtain suffi-
cient frequencies (>5%) of MART1-reactive CD8+ T cells. 
On day 2 of each stimulation, the γc-chain cytokines IL-2 
(12.5 IU/ml), IL-7 (5 ng/ml), and IL-15 (1 ng/ml) were 
added. Cultures that contained ≥5% specific CD8+ T cells, 
assessed by multimer analysis, were cloned by limiting dilu-
tion, and then stimulated twice using the rapid expansion 
protocol (Riddell et al., 1992; Ho et al., 2006). CTL products 
were frozen, thawed, and washed before infusion, for a total 
production time of 12–13 wk.
Isolation and expansion of polyclonal MART1-specific CTLs 
(with IL-21). 
 PBMCs were depleted of CD25+ T cells 
(Miltenyi Biotec) to eliminate regulatory T cells, and stimu-
lated twice for 7 d with autologous DC pulsed with 
MART126-35. DC stimulations were supplemented with the 
same γc-chain cytokines plus IL-21 (30 ng/ml) on day 1. Cul-
tures that contained ≥5% specific CD8+ T cells were clini-
cal-grade sorted (Influx cell sorter; BD) and stimulated twice 
using the Rapid Expansion Protocol. The total production 
time was 6 wk. The purity and phenotype, as well as the Vβ 
repertoire of each CTL product immediately before infusion, 
are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1, respectively. There was no 
overlap in the 
Vβ repertoire of both products.
T cell tracking by peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimers. 
 Allophy-
cocyanin-conjugated MART1-specific antigen pMHC mul-
timers (FHC 
RC Immune Monitoring Core Facility) were 
used to detect transferred CTL in PBMCs collected after in-
fusions, with a staining sensitivity of 0.05% of total CD8+ T 
cells, as previously described (Chapuis et al., 2012).
T cell tracking by HTT 
CS. 
 T
o guarantee that all tracked clono-
types were tumor-specific, only pMHC multimer-binding 
cells within the CTL infusion products were selected by flow 
cytometry before DNA isolation for HTT 
CS. The HTT 
CS 
limit of detection was set at 0.001% of all TCR reads, below 
which frequencies could not be reliably determined (Robins 
et al., 2012). The HTT 
CS frequency of each clonotype is 
based on all 
TCR 
Vβ chain reads, from both CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells (Robins et al., 2009).

CS results are reported as a percentage of CD8+ 
cells using the formula: HTT 
CS frequencies × ([% total 
CD8+ T cells] + [% total CD4+ T cells]/[% total CD8+ T

Flow cytometry. 
 Monoclonal and polyclonal CTL products 
pretransfer and PBMCs after transfer were identified by bind-
ing to a specific pMHC multimer, and analyzed by flow cy-
tometry after staining with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs 
to CD4, CD16, CD19 (exclusion channel), CD8, CD28, 
CD62L, CCR7, and PD1 (BD). Assessments of the intracel-
lular cytokine expression of IFN-γ, 
TNF
, and IL-2 in response 
to cognate antigen were performed, as previously described 
(Papagno et al., 2007). Cells were analyzed on an LSR 
II in-
strument (BD) using FAC 
SDiva software.
ELISpot assays. 
 Amino acid peptides, 15 aa in length offset by 
5 aas, were grouped into pools of 20–30 peptides spanning 
MART1, NY
-ESO-1, gp100, tyrosinase, and MAGE A3 (2, 2, 
5, 4, and 3 pools, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich). Peptide pools 
were used to stimulate PBMCs at indicated time points, and 
T cell reactivity was quantified using a human IFN-γ ELIS-
pot assay, as previously described (Scheibenbogen et al., 2000). 
This method quantifies CD8+ and CD4+ T cell reactivity to 
peptide pools independent of HLA restriction.
