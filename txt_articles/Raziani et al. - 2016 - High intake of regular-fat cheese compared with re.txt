ABSTRACT
Background: Regular-fat cheese contains a high amount of saturated
fat. Therefore, dietary guidelines in many countries recommend the
consumption of reduced-fat cheese as opposed to regular-fat cheese.
However, the negative effect of regular-fat cheese is still under debate.
Objectives: The aim was to compare the effects of regular-fat
cheese with an equal amount of reduced-fat cheese and an isocaloric
amount of carbohydrate-rich foods on LDL cholesterol and risk
factors for the metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Design: The study was a 12-wk randomized parallel intervention
preceded by a 2-wk run-in period. A total of 164 subjects with $2
MetS risk factors were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 intervention
groups: regular-fat cheese (REG), reduced-fat cheese (RED), or a no-
cheese, carbohydrate control (CHO) group. Subjects in the REG and
RED groups replaced part of their daily habitual diet with 80 g cheese/
10 MJ, whereas subjects in the CHO group did the same with bread and
jam corresponding to 90 g and 25 g/10 MJ, respectively.
Results: A total of 139 subjects completed the intervention. The
primary outcome, LDL cholesterol, was not significantly different
between the REG and RED diets or between the REG and CHO
diets. There was no significant difference in HDL cholesterol be-
tween the REG and RED diets, but HDL cholesterol tended to be
higher with the REG diet than with the CHO diet (0.06 6 0.03
mmol/L; P = 0.07). Insulin, glucose, and triacylglycerol concentra-
tions as well as blood pressure and waist circumference did not
differ significantly between the 3 diets.
Conclusion: A high daily intake of regular-fat cheese for 12 wk did
not alter LDL cholesterol or MetS risk factors differently than an equal
intake of reduced-fat cheese or an isocaloric amount of carbohydrate-
rich foods. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02616471.

INTRODUCTION
Current dietary guidelines, including the Nordic Nutrition Rec-
ommendations 2012 and the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans
2015, recommend limiting the intake of foods high in saturated fat to
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).4 Regular-fat
cheese (classified as a full-fat dairy product) would be expected
to increase total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Accordingly,
the guidelines recommend the replacement of full-fat cheese
with reduced-fat alternatives. Although it is well established that
the consumption of dairy fat from butter and cream causes an
increase in LDL cholesterol (1–3), less is known about dairy fat
from other foods. Observational studies on specific dairy prod-
ucts indicate that cheese consumption does not have any adverse
effect on heart health and may, in fact, reduce the risk of cor-
onary artery disease and/or stroke (4–9). Several randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) have also shown that cheese, despite its
high content of saturated fat, has a neutral or even beneficial
effect on total cholesterol and/or LDL cholesterol compared
with dairy products such as butter (10–12).
Insulin resistance has, in combination with abdominal obesity,
been suggested to be one of most important risk factors for
metabolic syndrome (MetS). Current evidence suggests that
cheese consumption may improve impaired glucose tolerance (13)
and decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (14). In addition,
cheese consumption has been found to be inversely associated with
the incidence of MetS (15, 16), although not consistently (17).
These findings indicate that not all dairy products can be con-
sidered equal with regard to CVD and T2D risk. Furthermore, they
emphasize the importance of considering whole foods and not

 macronutrient composition alone when evaluating CVD risk
markers, because these might be modified by the food matrix. A
recent meta-analysis of RCTs found no association between full-
fat and low-fat dairy intakes and cardiometabolic risk factors (18).
To our knowledge, it has not yet been investigated how regular-fat
cheese consumption affects blood lipids and other risk factors
compared with reduced-fat cheese. Nonetheless, under free-living
conditions, when a person reduces the intake of regular-fat cheese
in an attempt to improve her or his health, it is likely that the person
would compensate by either choosing reduced-fat cheese or by
limiting the amount of cheese and eating something else instead,
such as bread and a spread. The primary objective of the current
study was to compare the effects of a high daily intake of regular-
fat cheese with an equal intake of reduced-fat cheese or an iso-
caloric amount of carbohydrate-rich foods on LDL cholesterol and
MetS risk factors in a study population of men and women with $2
MetS risk factors. As a secondary objective, it was assessed
whether cheese consumption affected women and men differently,
as suggested by observational data (8). We hypothesized that the
intake of regular-fat cheese would not be associated with in-
creased LDL cholesterol or MetS risk factors compared with the
intake of reduced-fat cheese.
METHODS
Study design
This study was a 12-wk randomized parallel-intervention
study preceded by a 2-wk run-in period. During the 2-wk run-in
period, subjects received 250 mL skimmed milk/d (0.1%; Arla)
and were asked to refrain from consuming other dairy products.
Subjects were then randomly allocated to 3 intervention groups:
regular-fat cheese (REG), reduced-fat cheese (RED), or a non-
cheese, carbohydrate control (CHO) by means of randomization
sequences stratified by sex and smoking status and generated by
using R (19). Conditions before and on sampling days were
standardized. Thus, subjects were requested to be fasting for 12 h
(maximum of 0.5 L water allowed), not to perform extreme
physical activity for 24 h, and not drink alcohol for 24 h before the
blood sampling. Fasting blood samples were drawn after the 2-wk
run-in period at baseline (week 0) and after the 12-wk intervention
period. In addition to blood samples, anthropometric variables
(weight, height, and waist circumference), blood pressure, and body
composition were measured. The study was carried out at the
Department of Nutrition, Exercise, and Sports, Faculty of Sciences,
University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark, from February
2014 to May 2015 and was approved by the Municipal Ethical
Committee of Copenhagen (H-4-2013-099). Due to logistical is-
sues, the study had 4 study periods. The first period was from
February to July 2014, the second period was from September to
December 2015, the third period was from November 2014 to
January 2015, and the fourth period was from January to May 2015.
Subjects
Subjects were recruited for the study through advertisements in
local newspapers. A total of 193 subjects were selected for
screening, and 164 were randomly assigned as study participants
(see Figure 1 for participant flowchart). Inclusion criteria were
18–70 y of age, BMI (in kg/m2) of 18.5–37.5, waist circum-
ference .80 cm for women and .94 cm for men, and $1 ad-
ditional established risk factor for the MetS by using the
following criteria: systolic blood pressure .130 mm Hg and/or
diastolic blood pressure .85 mm Hg, triacylglycerols .1.7
mmol/L, HDL cholesterol ,1.00 mmol/L for men and ,1.3
mmol/L for women, and/or glucose .5.6 mmol/L. Exclusion
criteria were chronic diseases (known T2D, CVD, or other
chronic diseases that could affect the study outcome), milk al-
lergy, the use of prescription medicine that could affect the
results of the study (e.g., lipid-lowering agents), .10 h of
strenuous physical activity/wk, drug and alcohol abuse, blood
donation ,1 mo before study commencement or during the
study period, simultaneous participation in other clinical studies,
pregnant or lactating woman or women who were planning to
become pregnant during the intervention, or inability to comply
with the procedures required by the protocol. A total of 6 sub-
jects were smokers, and they did not change smoking habits
during the intervention. Subjects were asked to refrain from
dietary supplements and blood donation during the entire in-
tervention. In addition, they were asked to maintain their usual
physical activity levels and alcohol habits throughout the in-
tervention. All of the subjects gave their informed consent in
writing after receiving written and oral information about the
study. Habitual physical activity level was assessed by using
a validated physical activity questionnaire. Physical activity as
well as basal metabolic rate, on the basis of age, sex, and weight,
were used to calculate the subject’s energy requirement and
thereby the amount of test food to consume (20).
Experimental diets
Subjects in the REG and RED groups were provided with
equal amounts of regular-fat Danbo (25% fat; Riberhus; Arla)
and cheddar (32% fat; Sharp Cheddar; Lactalis) cheeses and
reduced-fat Danbo (13% fat; Riberhus) and cheddar (16% fat;
Sharp Cheddar) cheeses, respectively. In the CHO group, cheese
was replaced with white-wheat bread (Kohberg) and sugar-
sweetened jam (Fynbo). The subjects could choose between 5
different flavors of jam, including strawberry, raspberry, blue-
berry, blackcurrant, and orange, all containing 50 g fruit/100 g
and 45 g added sugar/100 g. The cheese supplied in the REG
group contained an amount of energy similar to the bread and jam
supplied to the CHO group. The cheese supplied in the RED
group contained w17% less energy than the cheese in the REG
group. Subjects in all 3 groups were also provided with 250 mL
skimmed milk/d (0.1% fat; Arla) throughout the intervention
and were asked not to consume any other dairy products in this
period. The subjects were guided in how to substitute the
cheese or bread for food items from their habitual diets. Sub-
jects were given a list of food items equaling the energy con-
tent of the test foods, and it was then up to the individual
subject to decide which food items to replace. The remaining
part of the subjects’ habitual diet was not controlled, and they
were asked to maintain their usual diets. Subjects were allo-
cated to an energy level of 8, 10, 12, or 14 MJ depending on their
estimated energy requirement. The daily amounts of cheese provided
corresponded to 80 g $ d21 $ 10 MJ21, whereas the daily amounts
of bread and jam corresponded to 90 and 25 g $ d21 $ 10 MJ21,
respectively. The composition of the 3 intervention diets is shown
in Table 1.

 During the run-in period before baseline measurements and in
week 12 of the intervention, subjects completed a 3-d dietary
food record to provide information about their dietary intake
during the intervention. Two weekdays and 1 weekend day were
included in the dietary record to take into account any differences
in nutrient intake during weekdays and weekend days. Subjects
were instructed not to let the recording influence their food
consumption. At the beginning of the intervention, subjects re-
ceived a scale and a study food diary in which they were asked to
note the weight of all of the intervention food not consumed,
together with an explanation of why consumption had been
avoided. Subjects attended the department each week to collect
the intervention food and were asked to bring their food diaries
for compliance control. Compliance was measured as a per-
centage of test food consumed compared with test food handed
out to the subjects.
Analytic procedures
Blood samples
Blood samples were drawn for the measurement of serum blood
lipids (total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerols),
serum C-reactive protein (CRP), free fatty acids (FFAs), plasma
glucose, and serum insulin. LDL and HDL cholesterol were
assessed by using an enzymatic colorimetric procedure (ABX
Pentra LDL Direct CP and ABX Pentra HDL Direct CP, re-
spectively; Horiba ABX). Total cholesterol and triacylglycerol
concentrations were assessed in serum by enzymatic procedures
(cholesterol oxidase-phenol 1 aminophenazone and glycerol-3-
phosphate oxidase-phenol 1 aminophenazone, respectively). The
analysis was carried out with an ABX Pentra 400 Chemistry
Analyzer. Interassay CVs for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
HDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerols were 2.4%, 2.7%, 2.0%, and
3.5%, respectively. Intra-assay CVs for total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerols were 0.9%,
0.7%, 1.2%, and 3.8%, respectively. CRP concentrations were
measured by using a high-sensitivity immunometric assay (ABX
Pentra CRP CP). Inter- and intra-assay CVs for CRP were 3.4%
and 2.3%, respectively. FFAs were assessed by using an enzymatic
colorimetric procedure (ABX Pentra FFA CP). Inter- and intra-
assay CVs for FFAs were 2.0% and 1.7%, respectively. Glucose
concentrations were measured with an enzymatic procedure (ABX
Pentra Glucose HK CP) and were analyzed with an ABX Pentra
400 Chemistry Analyzer. Inter- and intra-assay CVs for plasma
glucose were 2.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Insulin was measured
by chemiluminescent immunoassay with an Immulite 1000
(Siemens Medical Solution Diagnostics). Inter- and intra-assay

 CVs for insulin were 3.5% and 4.2%, respectively. Insulin re-
sistance was calculated by using HOMA-IR with the following

Anthropometric measures
Fasting body weight was measured after the run-in period
(week 0), halfway through the intervention (week 6), and
postintervention (week 12) to the nearest 0.1 kg with subjects
wearing light clothing and having emptied their bladder in ad-
vance (Lindeltronic 8000 scale; Lindells). Height was measured
after the run-in (week 0) without shoes to the nearest 0.5 cm with
a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca). Waist and hip circumfer-
ences were measured after the run-in period (week 0), halfway
through the intervention (week 6), and postintervention (week
12) with a flexible nonelastic tape around subjects while dressed
in underwear and standing in an upright position with 25–30 cm
distance between their feet. Waist circumference was measured
horizontally at the midpoint between the lower rim of the ribs
and the top of the iliac crest. Hip circumference was measured at
the level of trochanter major and pubic symphysis. The average
of 2 consecutive measurements rounded to the nearest 0.5 cm
was used.
A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner (GE Prodigy)
was used for the determination of body composition (fat mass and
lean body mass) after the run-in period (week 0) and post-
intervention (week 12). Subjects were scanned in a fasting
condition while wearing light clothing. Their feet were wrapped
in fabric enclosed by Velcro straps to maintain the same position
during the duration of the scan. All scans were performed at
an appropriate scanning speed according to the subject’s body
weight and sagittal diameter. Quality control and calibration
were performed before each scan by using a Lunar Aluminum
Spine Phantom (GE Prodigy).
Blood pressure
Fasting blood pressure was measured after the run-in period
(week 0), halfway through the intervention (week 6), and
postintervention (week 12). After 5 min of rest in a reclined
position with an empty bladder, 3 consecutive measurements
were performed by using an automatic sphygmomanometer
(UA-787; A&D Co. Ltd.). A cuff of the appropriate size was
placed directly on the skin 2 cm from the elbow. Conversation
during measurement was not allowed. All of the measurements
were recorded and the mean of the last 2 measurements was used.
Sample size calculation
The power calculation was based on a previous study in which
a difference of 0.25 6 0.46 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol was
observed between a regular-cheese diet and a cheese diet with
conjugated linoleic acid (22). To detect a similar difference in
our study, 57 subjects had to be included in each intervention
group (assuming a significance level of 5% and 80% power). In
addition, sample size was recalculated after the first period. The
updated sample size calculation was based on estimated means and
residual SEs, which were obtained from an interim analysis by
using an ANCOVA model fitted to LDL-cholesterol measurements
from the 38 subjects in period 1. The model included adjustments
for baseline LDL cholesterol, age, sex, and change in body fat. To
detect significant differences in LDL cholesterol between the in-
tervention groups (significance level of 5% and 80% power), a total
of 48 subjects were needed in each group. Thus, 144 subjects were
needed to complete the study. A total of 168 subjects were enrolled
in the study to allow for a 15% drop-out rate.
Statistical analysis
All of the statistical analyses were performed by using R (R Core
Team, 2015) (19). For all outcomes except for dietary records, the
effect of the intervention was evaluated by means of an intention-to-
treat (ITT) analysis with the use of linear mixed models based on all
subjects completing the run-in period. Missing values and outliers
were imputed by means of baseline observation carried forward, and
if needed, simple mean imputation was used for missing baseline
outcome values. In addition, complete-case analyses were carried out
to gauge the efficacy of the intervention (only complete-case analyses
were carried out for dietary records). All of the models included
adjustments for baseline outcome, age, sex, BMI, and change in body
fat as fixed effects, whereas differences between periods were
modeled by means of random effects. For each outcome, 2 pairwise
comparisons were evaluated—the REG compared with the RED
diet and the REG compared with the CHO diet—by using post hoc
t tests based on the linear mixed models. The resulting 2 P values
were adjusted for multiplicity (23). For the primary outcome,
P values were adjusted for the interim analysis used for re-
calculation of the sample size (24). Model checking of assumptions
of variance homogeneity and normality was carried out by means
of residual and normal probability plots. Results are presented as
means 6 SEMs. A significance level of 0.05 was used.
RESULTS
Subjects
Of the 164 subjects randomly assigned to the study, 150
subjects (100 women and 50 men) entered the 12-wk intervention
period and 139 subjects (92 women and 47 men) completed the
12-wk intervention. Five subjects (4 women and 1 man) in the
REG group, 3 subjects (1 woman and 2 men) in the RED group,
and 3 subjects (3 women) in the CHO group dropped out during
the intervention. The main reasons for discontinued intervention
were personal practical problems, illness unrelated to the study,
and inability to follow study protocol. The baseline character-
istics of subjects who completed the study are listed in Table 2.
Baseline characteristics of dropouts did not differ from those of
study completers (data not shown).
Lipids and cholesterol homeostasis
Changes from baseline as well as differences between groups
for total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; ratios of total cholesterol to
HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol; tri-
acylglycerols; and FFAs are shown in Table 3. The ITT analyses
showed no significant differences for these outcomes between
the REG and RED diets or between the REG and CHO diets (all

 P $ 0.07). Complete-case analyses showed similar results
(Supplemental Table 1). There were no differences between
men and women for any of the blood lipid measurements in
either the ITT analyses or the complete-case analyses.
Glucose homeostasis and CRP
Changes in mean serum concentrations of insulin, glucose, and
CRP and calculated HOMA-IR are also shown in Table 3. ITT
analyses showed no significant differences for any of these
outcomes between the REG and RED diets or between the REG
and CHO diets (all P $ 0.12). Complete-case analyses showed
similar results (Supplemental Table 1).
Anthropometric measures and blood pressure
Changes in mean anthropometric measures, body composition,
and blood pressure are shown in Table 4. ITT analyses showed
no significant differences in body weight, fat mass, lean body
mass, waist circumference, or blood pressure between the REG
and RED diets or between the REG and CHO diets (all P $
0.16). Complete-case analyses showed similar results (Supple-
mental Table 2).
Dietary intake and compliance
On the basis of daily completed food diaries and weekly
conversations, compliance in all 3 groups was considered good
(.95%) with regard to adherence to assigned intervention foods
and refraining from other dairy products. There were no sig-
nificant differences in compliance between the 3 diet groups in
amount of test food consumed (REG group: 98.9% 6 0.3%;
RED group: 98.8% 6 0.4%; CHO group: 99.3% 6 0.3%).
Dietary records
Results from the 3-d weighted dietary records in week 12 are
shown in Table 5. No differences were observed in energy in-
take between groups. Fat intakes (in grams and percentage of
energy) were significantly higher with the REG diet than with
the RED diet (P , 0.05) and the CHO diet (P , 0.001). Sat-
urated fat was significantly higher with the REG diet than with
the RED (P , 0.01) and CHO (P , 0.001) diets. The amount of
MUFAs was significantly higher with the REG diet than with the
CHO diet (P , 0.01), whereas PUFAs did not differ between the
diets. The intake of carbohydrate was greater with the CHO diet
than with the REG (P , 0.001) and RED (P , 0.001) diets.
However, dietary fiber did not differ between the diets. As

 expected, calcium intake was significantly higher with the REG
diet than with the CHO diet (P , 0.001).
DISCUSSION
Our results showed that daily consumption of 64–112 g regular-
fat cheese for 12 wk did not modify LDL cholesterol or MetS
risk factors differently than equal amounts of reduced-fat
cheese or carbohydrate-rich foods. These findings are consistent
with our hypothesis that cheese consumption, both regular-fat
and reduced-fat, has a neutral effect on metabolic risk factors.
The fact that subjects in all 3 groups remained weight-stable
throughout the intervention indicates that the observed effects
were independent of changes in body weight. Our results are in
line with a recently published Norwegian study, which showed
no changes in LDL cholesterol or any of the MetS factors after
8 wk of cheese intake with different fat contents compared with
a control group (25). Our results are also in accordance with
a study by Thorning et al. (26), who found no difference be-
tween a high-fat cheese diet and a carbohydrate-rich diet on
concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, tri-
acylglycerols, insulin, or glucose. However, they observed a 5%
higher HDL-cholesterol concentration (P = 0.012) with the
cheese diet than with the carbohydrate-rich diet. In our study,
a small increase in HDL cholesterol was observed with the REG
diet compared with the CHO diet, although this increase was not
significant (P = 0.07). This partly reflects the well-characterized
impact of total fat on HDL metabolism. Other studies have
shown that cheese intake is associated with higher HDL-cho-
lesterol concentrations (27, 28). These findings are in accor-
dance with a meta-analysis that showed that the replacement of
all classes of dietary fat with carbohydrates yields unfavorable
changes in HDL cholesterol, with significant decreases in some
HDL subgroups (29, 30). According to the literature, a high
concentration of circulating HDL cholesterol is considered
beneficial with regard to cardiovascular health, although the
mechanism for the apparent beneficial effect is not fully un-
derstood (31–33). Thus, it is reasonable to consider that

 unbeneficial changes in LDL cholesterol caused by SFAs are
counteracted by their favorable effect on HDL cholesterol. This
hypothesis might be a possible explanation for the less harmful
effect of saturated fat in relation to CVD shown in several
current meta-analyses (31, 34, 35).
The present study was designed to assess the effects of 12 wk
of high cheese consumption under conditions similar to real life,
without controlling the subjects’ habitual diet and by using
manufactured products normally consumed by the Danish pop-
ulation. According to the subjects’ dietary records, subjects in
the REG group consumed 7.7% of energy from SFAs from other
nondairy sources, whereas subjects in the RED and CHO groups
consumed 6.2% and 8.8% of energy from SFAs from other
nondairy sources, respectively. An interesting finding in the
current study was that, despite a significant increase in SFA
intake (primarily due to the regular-fat cheese) during the REG
diet compared with the RED and CHO diets, LDL cholesterol
did not differ between the diets. This finding could partly be
explained by the fact that MUFA intake was significantly higher
with the REG diet than with CHO diet. MUFAs have been
suggested to reduce LDL cholesterol instead of carbohydrates
(36, 37). Thus, the higher intakes of MUFAs during the REG
intervention period could possibly have diminished the effect
of SFAs on LDL cholesterol. Energy intake remained similar
during the intervention in all 3 groups, suggesting that subjects
in the RED and CHO groups replaced energy from saturated fat
with other sources, mainly carbohydrates. The health effects of
replacing saturated fat depend highly on what is consumed in-
stead. PUFAs, but not carbohydrates, have been associated with
a reduced risk of coronary artery disease (38).
Intervention studies on specific regular-fat dairy products
compared with reduced-fat products are limited. However, sev-
eral RCTs have explored how the food matrix modulates the
effect of dairy fat on CVD risk markers by comparing cheese with
butter (10–12, 39–41). A meta-analysis of 5 RCTs concluded
that, despite a similar intake of saturated fat, cheese consump-
tion significantly decreased LDL cholesterol by 6.5% and HDL
cholesterol by 3.9% compared with butter (42). These results
emphasize the importance of considering whole foods when
evaluating CVD risk markers, because they might be modified
by food matrix.
Despite a significantly higher intake of carbohydrates during
the CHO diet in our study, fasting triacylglycerol concentra-
tions did not differ significantly from the REG and RED diets.
This result was interesting because the control diet mainly
consisted of medium– and high–glycemic index (-GI) car-
bohydrate-rich foods (white bread and jam), which have been
shown to increase triacylglycerol concentrations in some studies
(36, 43). However, this finding might be due to the weight-
maintenance design of the current study. Sloth et al. (44)
found no differences in triacylglycerol concentrations with
a high-carbohydrate diet with a low GI than with a high-
carbohydrate diet with a high GI in a 10-wk parallel study.
Here, ad libitum intake was allowed, and both diet groups
experienced a small decrease in body weight, in contrast to the
present study. Moreover, cheese has been suggested to decrease
triacylglycerol by inhibiting stearoyl-CoA desaturase, a rate-
limiting enzyme in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (45); how-
ever, we did not observe lower triacylglycerol concentrations
with the 2 cheese diets.
The current study found no difference in fasting glucose, insulin,
or HOMA-IR between the REG and RED groups. However, it
seems that the effect of cheese intake on T2D risk markers is
inconsistent. In healthy subjects, a current study found higher
fasting plasma glucose after cheese consumption than after butter
consumption (12), whereas another found lower insulin concen-
trations after cheese consumption than after a nondairy control diet
(41). Finally, a third study found higher postprandial glucose
concentrations after cheese intake (39), whereas others observed
no effect of cheese on glucose or insulin values (10). Thus, the
effect of cheese intake on indicators of insulin sensitivity requires
further exploration. In a recent study in pigs, Thorning et al. (46)
investigated how cheese with different ripening times affects blood
lipid, glucose, and insulin concentrations. Short-term ripened
cheddar caused higher serum insulin concentrations than did long-
term ripened cheddar, indicating that insulin responses to cheese
consumption may depend on the ripening duration of the cheese.
LDL cholesterol was not affected by ripening time, nor were total
cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, or triacylglycerol concentrations.
Therefore, it is unlikely that ripening duration is involved in the
observed effect of cheese intake on blood lipids. However, these
results have yet to be confirmed in human subjects.
The strength of the current study was its long duration and the
relatively large sample size compared with similar trials. The current
study also strived to imitate real-life settings by not matching the
diets for energy content or macronutrient composition, making it
possible to directly compare regular-fat cheese and reduced-fat
cheese as whole foods. Limitations of the present study include the
fact that subjects were free-living; thus, potential confounding by
other dietary and lifestyle factors was present. It was also not
possible to blind the study to subjects and staff due to the nature of
the diets. However, the laboratory technicians conducting the blood
analyses were not aware of the intervention allocation.
In conclusion, our results indicate that the consumption of
regular-fat cheese in high daily amounts does not affect serum lipid
concentrations, fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, blood
pressure, or waist circumference differently than do reduced-fat
cheese or carbohydrate-rich foods in a population with $2 MetS
risk factors. Our results suggest that, for most individuals, it is
reasonable to include regular-fat cheese as part of a healthy diet.
