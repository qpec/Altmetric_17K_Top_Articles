Background: Public trust in immunization is an increasingly important global health issue. Losses in confidence in
vaccines and immunization programmes can lead to vaccine reluctance and refusal, risking disease outbreaks
and challenging immunization goals in high- and low-income settings. National and international immunization
stakeholders have called for better monitoring of vaccine confidence to identify emerging concerns before they
evolve into vaccine confidence crises.
Methods: We perform a large-scale, data-driven study on worldwide attitudes to immunizations. This survey –
which we believe represents the largest survey on confidence in immunization to date – examines perceptions
of vaccine importance, safety, effectiveness, and religious compatibility among 65,819 individuals across 67
countries. Hierarchical models are employed to probe relationships between individual- and country-level
socio-economic factors and vaccine attitudes obtained through the four-question, Likert-scale survey.
Findings: Overall sentiment towards vaccinations is positive across all 67 countries, however there is wide vari-
ability between countries and across world regions. Vaccine-safety related sentiment is particularly negative in
the European region, which has seven of the ten least confident countries, with 41% of respondents in France
and 36% of respondents in Bosnia & Herzegovina reporting that they disagree that vaccines are safe (compared
to a global average of 13%). The oldest age group (65+) and Roman Catholics (amongst all faiths surveyed)
are associated with positive views on vaccine sentiment, while the Western Pacific region reported the highest
level of religious incompatibility with vaccines. Countries with high levels of schooling and good access to health
services are associated with lower rates of positive sentiment, pointing to an emerging inverse relationship be-
tween vaccine sentiments and socio-economic status.
Conclusions: Regular monitoring of vaccine attitudes – coupled with monitoring of local immunization rates – at
the national and sub-national levels can identify populations with declining confidence and acceptance. These
populations should be prioritized to further investigate the drivers of negative sentiment and to inform appropri-
ate interventions to prevent adverse public health outcomes.

1. Introduction
Vaccine confidence is an increasingly important global public health
issue, with decreases in confidence leading to well-documented cases of
disease outbreaks, setbacks to global polio eradication as well as other
immunization goals, and contentious political debates in high and
low-income countries alike (Brown et al., 2010; Hanley et al., 2015;

 Khetsuriani et al., 2010; Larson et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2016). The World
Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE)
on Immunization (WHO, 2014) as well as national immunization
programmes (US Dept. Health and Human Services, 2015) have called for
better monitoring of vaccine confidence and hesitancy to inform the devel-
opment of communication and other interventions to address confidence
gaps, to sustain confidence in vaccines and immunization programmes
and to avert confidence crises and their public health consequences.
In March 2012, the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy con-
vened to define “vaccine hesitancy” and to develop and standardize sur-
vey frameworks within which the scale and determinants of vaccine
hesitancy and vaccine confidence can be measured (Larson et al.,
2015a, 2015b). A number of studies have since investigated attitudes to-
wards vaccines in diverse contexts, including investigation of attitudes
towards immunization programmes (Dubé et al., 2016), vaccine hesi-
tancy among general practitioners (GPs) (Verger et al., 2015), the detri-
mental effects of non-voluntary immunization campaigns (especially
amongst those already expressing negative vaccine sentiment)
(Betsch and Böhm, 2016), and social network analyses identifying clus-
tering of vaccine-refusing households (Onnela et al., 2016).
This latter study is particularly important in the context of vaccine refus-
al, since it supports a growing body of research which underscores the role
of clusters of non-vaccinators in lowering herd immunity and allowing for
disease outbreaks (Salathé and Bonhoeffer, 2008; Liu et al., 2015). The US
Centers for Disease Control have also recognized this phenomenon,
highlighting also the vulnerability of under-vaccinated groups to imported
diseases, and noting a paradigm-shift away from access as the primary
barrier to vaccinations and towards “philosophical objections” (CDC,
2013). It is thus worth stressing the importance of monitoring performance
in vaccination programmes (de Figueiredo et al., 2016) and identifying and
monitoring hesitant groups: small clusters of non-vaccinators can have dis-
proportionately adverse effects on herd immunity and epidemic spread.
Our objectives in this paper are to: respond to international calls for
monitoring public confidence in immunization; examine worldwide
variation in attitudes, exploring the socio-economic determinants of
vaccine attitudes; and, finally, interpret and discuss the results in the
context of global immunization and monitoring systems. This study –
in collaboration with WIN/Gallup International Associationi – draws
from the ten-question Likert survey proposed by SAGE (Larson et al.,
2015a, 2015b) and comprises survey responses from 65,819 individuals
across 67 countries to questions on vaccination importance, safety, ef-
fectiveness, and religious compatibility. This study builds on a five-
country vaccine confidence survey conducted in collaboration with
Win/Gallup International in 2014 (Larson et al., 2014a, 2014b). We be-
lieve this study to be of unprecedented scale in the vaccine confidence
literature, and a potential cornerstone for monitoring of public confi-
dence in immunization. We begin by exploring worldwide variation in
attitudes to four statements investigating individuals' perceptions of
the importance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines, as well as the com-
patibility with their religious beliefs. We then highlight regional trends
in vaccine safety perceptions and explore socio-economic determinants
of vaccine sentiments using logistic hierarchical modelling.
2. Methods
2.1. Data
Individual-level vaccine-sentiment and socio-economic data in this
study was collected through a WIN/Gallup International Association
survey. The WIN/GIA Annual Survey has been conducted annually
since 1977. In 2015, in collaboration with the Vaccine Confidence Pro-
ject at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,ii WIN-Gallup
International extended their annual 14-question survey conducted in
67 countries to include four questions related to attitudes towards vac-
cines. A total of 65,819 persons were interviewed globally,iii with a sam-
ple of around 500 men and 500 women interviewed either face-to-face
(28 countries, n = 30,230), via telephone (16 countries, n = 13,062), or
online (23 countries, n = 22,527). Algeria reported the fewest respon-
dents (398), whilst Afghanistan reported the most (2080). The field-
work was conducted between September 2015 and December 2015.
The interview method selected in each country was largely determined
by the availability of the internet and the phone. In those countries
where the internet is widely used (e.g. Europe) the majority of field-
work was carried out via online panels. In those countries where
phone penetration is sufficiently high a random digit dial telephone
methodology was used. In those countries with poor internet and land-
line phone coverage (e.g. Pakistan) interviews were carried out face-to-
face following a (multi-stage) random probability methodology. In each
country only one mode of interviewing was used.
Each respondent was asked to rate – on the five-point Likert
scale: strongly agree, tend to agree, do not know, tend to disagree,
strongly disagree – the extent to which they agreed with four
statements pertaining to vaccination: “vaccines are important for
children to have”; “overall I think vaccines are safe”; “overall I
think vaccines are effective”; and “vaccines are compatible with my
religious beliefs”. In addition to these survey responses, individual
respondents' sex, age, income level, religion, work status, and
educational level were recorded. The overall missing data fraction
is 6.4%, however, this varies substantially by country and covariate:
sex, age, work status, and education have ~1% missing data, whereas
religion and income have ~11% missing values. Missing responses
are present within the question response data though their
prevalence is difficult to establish since “no response” and “do not
know” are coded collectively. The number of “do not know/no
response” to each of the four questions is 3%, 5%, 4%, and 12%
respectively, suggesting 3% as a likely upper threshold for those
providing no response.
To allow the statistical investigation into socio-economic factors
that affect country-wide variation in response data, country-level
data was also collected from a variety of sources including the
World Health Organization, the World Bank, and the United Nations
Development Programme. This set of socio-economic factors – which
includes GDP, births attended by skilled health staff, child mortality,
access to sanitation, access to water, total health spending, and mean
years in school – allows variation of country-level variables with
response to be investigated in addition to the individual-level
factors.
2.2. Statistical Analysis
A hierarchical logistic model is used to probe the ties between
individual- and country-level variables and attitudes to vaccines. The
responses to each question are dichotomized into positive versus non-
positive (including do not know or no response), with partial pooling
between countries via a combination of random effects and regression
on country level factors. There are a total of 18 missing data points
(out of a total of 469) for the country-level factors, which are imputed
using mean-imputation. Odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals)
are derived for risk factors. Full details of the model are provided in
the Supplementary materials. R 3.3.0 is used for all analyses and
stargazer is used to create Table 1 (R, 2016; Hlavac, 2013).

 3. Results
Immunization-response data is renormalized after removing “do not
know/no response” responses. An overall summary by question and
country (stratified by world region as defined by the World Health
Organization) is shown in Fig. 1 using weighted responses, which are
adjustments to account for over- or under-represented individuals
within the population. (World regions are categorized by WHO region
according
to
the
definitions
at
www.who.int/about/regions/en
(accessed 08/07/2016): AFR (Africa region); AMR (Americas region);
EMR (Eastern Mediterranean region); EUR (European region); SEAR
(South-East Asia region); and WPR (Western Pacific region).) Overall
differences in responses between the six WHO regions are again
shown as Likert responses in Fig. 2a and worldwide vaccine attitudes
to vaccine safety are mapped in Fig. 2c (South, 2011).
Variability in vaccine sentiment across countries and WHO regions is
investigated by considering the fraction of respondents who either
agree or disagree with the four statements on immunization (Fig. 1).
The EUR region reports the highest mean-averaged (across all countries
in the region) negative responses for vaccine importance, safety, and ef-
fectiveness (8.0%, 17.0%, and 11.3%, respectively) and seven of the ten
most negatively-reporting countries to vaccine safety are in EUR. Pairwise
t-tests between regional means demonstrate that EUR has more
importance- and safety-related skepticism than AFR, AMR, EMR, and
SEAR (at p = 0.05), and that WPR has more safety-related skepticism
than SEAR. EUR has more effectiveness-related skepticism than AMR.
SEAR and WPR report the most religious incompatibility (25.7% and
24.3% respectively): pairwise t-tests reveal significance at p = 0.05 be-
tween these two regions and the four others, but none between them.
In Fig. 1, countries are ranked by the percentage of (normalized)
negative sentiment expressed towards a given question. (All figures
quoted are normalized responses.) Respondents from Bangladesh
(0.3%), Ecuador (0.4%), and Iran (0.5%) report the lowest levels of im-
portance-related skepticism, whilst respondents from Russia (17.1%),
Azerbaijan (15.7%), and Italy (15.4%) report the highest (the global av-
erage is 5.8%). With regard to vaccine safety, Bangladesh (0.2%), Saudi
Arabia (1.2%), and Argentina (1.3%) report the lowest levels of skepti-
cism, whilst respondents from France (45.2%), Bosnia & Herzegovina
(38.3%), and Japan (31.0%) have the highest (the global average is
13.0%). Argentina (1.3%), Ethiopia (2.1%), and Ecuador (2.2%) have the
lowest levels of effectiveness-related doubts, whilst Bosnia & Herzego-
vina (27.3%), Russia (20.1%), and Italy (18.7%) have the highest (global
average 9.1%). With regard to religious compatibility, Saudi Arabia
(2.3%), Finland (2.6%), and Brazil (3.2%) have the lowest levels of report-
ed incompatibility, whilst Mongolia (50.5%), Thailand (44.4%), and
Vietnam (31.8%) have the highest (global average 15.4%).

Fig. 1. Weighted responses to survey questions by country and WHO region Renormalized Likert responses by country and world region across the four survey statements, with mean-
averaged (across all countries within a region) negative sentiment displayed (vertical grey lines). Within each statement countries are ranked by the percentage of negative responses. The
European region performs poorly for vaccine importance, safety, and effectiveness-related skepticism, with Southern and Eastern European countries performing poorly for vaccine safety,
though France and Italy are notable exceptions. The South East Asian and Western Pacific Region have high levels of religious-based vaccine incompatibility, notably in Mongolia, Vietnam,
and Thailand.

 In EUR, vaccine safety and importance are concerns, though there is rela-
tively little reported religious incompatibility. In WPR, however, great
concerns are expressed about safety, importance, and religious compatibility
(Fig. 2a). Pearson correlations between the fractions of negative responses
(across countries) between questions reveals that responses are more consis-
tent among vaccine importance, safety, and effectiveness than with religious
compatibility (Fig. 2b). A notable trend is the observation that the number of
respondents who report more positive sentiment for vaccine importance
is larger than that for vaccine safety. The striking consistency in this trend
across most of the countries surveyed is clear in Fig. 2d. This suggests that
vaccination intent could be buffered by perceived importance, implying that
people are willing to take a risk given an effective guard against disease. As
suggested by the correlation in responses of vaccine importance and
vaccine safety, individual responses between vaccine effectiveness and
vaccine safety are very similar (see Supplementary material), though we
note a higher fraction of countries with no significant difference and some
countries with a higher fraction of respondents reporting that vaccines are
safe then effective (Nigeria, Ghana, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Bangladesh).
Worldwide levels of vaccine-safety skepticism are mapped in Fig. 2c.
With the notable exceptions of France and Italy – which have high levels of
safety-based vaccine skepticism – Western and Northern European countries
express less concern about vaccine safety than Eastern and Southern European
countries. Spatial contiguity is not limited to Europe: USA, Canada, and Mexico
have higher levels of safety concerns than countries in South America; and
China, Mongolia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam all have high fractions of
negative responses.
Results of the logistic hierarchical model employed to investigate the
link between both individual- and country-level predictors, and attitudes
towards immunizations, are shown in Table 1. To compare data on different
scales, country-level factors have been z-scored so that a unit increase in
country-level factor is associated with the reported odds ratios. Parameters
with p-values lower than 0.05 are considered. An interpretation of the
quantitative links between vaccine attitude and socioeconomic factors re-
quires consideration of corrections for multiple comparisons. As we consid-
er a moderately complex modelling framework and many of the factors we
consider are interdependent, a choice of correction is not straightforward.
We would like to highlight factors plausibly connected to attitudes to vac-
cines and so type II errors are – to a large extent – of greater concern. Factors
highlighted as significant tend to be consistent across the four models con-
sidered, which adds credibility to their association with vaccination atti-
tude. We therefore throughout report full 95% confidence intervals and
uncorrected p-values so the reader can interpret link strength as required.
Males are less likely to think vaccines are important than females
(odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80 to 0.94), but
there are no significant differences between the sexes for vaccine safety,
effectiveness, or religious compatibility. Those aged 25–34 are less likely
to believe vaccines are safe compared to 18–24 year olds (OR 0.88, CI
0.77–1.00); over 65s are both more likely to report that vaccines are effec-
tive (OR 1.39, CI 1.11–1.76) and to express religious incompatibilities (OR
1.27, CI 1.05–1.53). Any level of education elevates positive views to-
wards immunizations for vaccine importance, effectiveness, and religious
compatibility; yet, notably, not for vaccine safety. Masters/PhD – the
highest educational level – is not associated with more positive views
on vaccine importance and effectiveness than those with no education.
The fifth income quintile is associated with less positive vaccine senti-
ment across all four statements than higher income bands. Those unem-
ployed are more likely to hold negative sentiment for vaccine safety (OR
0.77, CI 0.67–0.90) and effectiveness (OR 0.79, CI 0.67–0.92) than the
baseline group. Compared to Roman Catholics, religious groups – includ-
ing atheists/agnostics and with possible exceptions of Hindus and Jews –

 are less likely to hold positive vaccine sentiment for vaccine importance
and vaccine safety. Other Christians and atheists/agnostics are more likely
to have religious compatibility issues; however, it should be noted that it
is unclear whether atheists/agnostics could have reasonably answered
this question, since the phrasing assumed the respondent's religiosity.
For vaccine importance, countries with higher levels of births attended by
skilled health staff (OR 0.66, CI 0.49–0.88) and schooling (OR 0.56, CI 0.43–
0.72) are associated with less positive responses, whilst countries with high
GDP per capita (OR 1.56, CI 1.25–1.95) are associated with more positive
responses. For vaccine safety and effectiveness, the results are similar, except
health expenditure is associated with negative responses, and sanitation
access is associated with positive responses (for vaccine effectiveness only).
Higher levels of births attended by skilled health staff (OR 0.79, CI 0.65–
0.96) and schooling (OR 0.80, CI 0.66–0.97) are associated with anti-vaccine
sentiment for religious compatibility, whilst higher levels of sanitation access
(OR 1.29, CI 1.01–1.65) are associated with pro-vaccine sentiment.
4. Discussion
We have performed a large-scale, data-driven study into worldwide
variations in attitudes to vaccines. We find that vaccine safety sentiment
is more negative in the European and the Western Pacific regions,
where nine of the ten least confident countries are located (France,
Bosnia & Herzegovina, Russia, Ukraine, Greece, Armenia, Slovenia,
Japan, and Mongolia). Conversely, vaccines are perceived to be safe
across countries surveyed in the South East Asian region (Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Thailand, and India). The more negative vaccine-safety per-
ceptions in the European region is striking, particularly given
Table 1
Results of the logistic hierarchical regression.
Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the fixed effects in the logistic hierarchical model (see Supplementary materials). Survey responses are dichotomized so that odds ratios great-
er than one (for example) represent an association between explanatory variable and positive vaccine sentiment. Males are less likely to think vaccines are important than females. Any
level of education elevates pro-vaccine views for importance, efficacy, and religious compatibility but not for vaccine safety. Over 65s are both more likely to report that vaccines are ef-
fective (OR 1.39, CI 1.11–1.76) and to express religious incompatibilities. Countries with higher levels of education and a higher fraction of births attended by skilled health staff are as-
sociated with decreased odds of pro-vaccination attitudes.

 widespread access to vaccines. Our research thus stresses the emerging
shift away from access to vaccines as the primary barrier to vaccination in
many countries, a finding supported by other European studies, such as a
recent review which finds vaccine side-effects and vaccine safety as the
most commonly-cited reservation amongst the public (Yaqub et al., 2014).
The extreme negative sentiment around vaccine safety reported in
France builds upon multiple strands of vaccine controversies and distrust
that have evolved in France over the past two decades. These include con-
troversies relating to side effects of the hepatitis B vaccine (Marshall,
1998); physician-led petitions disputing the hexavalent vaccine for in-
fants and the HPV vaccine (Collange et al., 2016); and hesitancy amongst
general practitioners with nearly one in four GPs responding that some
vaccines recommended by the French public health authorities are not
useful (Verger et al., 2015), and many reporting doubt in immunization
programmes (Raude et al., 2016). Although the highest levels of vaccine
skepticism were reported in Europe, the longer term global impacts
should not be underestimated as reported in separate research on trans-
national influences of vaccine sentiment (Larson et al., 2014a, 2014b).
We find that a larger proportion of respondents report more positive-
ly on vaccine importance than vaccine safety, suggesting that perceptions
of vaccine importance may mitigate losses in vaccination uptake (with
similar results for the difference between vaccine effectiveness and vac-
cine safety, though noticeable exceptions for Nigeria, Ghana, Pakistan, In-
donesia, and Bangladesh – see Supplementary material). Many countries
are found to have strong faith-compatibility issues, most notably in Thai-
land and Mongolia. In addition to investigating the relationship between
vaccine importance, vaccine safety and vaccination intent, there is also a
pressing need to clarify the vaccination intent of individuals who think
that vaccines are incompatible with their faith. Religious fundamentalism
has been cited as a major factor of polio refusal in Afghanistan, Nigeria,
and Pakistan (Ahmed et al., 2013; Warraich, 2009) which have moderate
religious objection rates within the Muslims sampled (3%, 12% and 14%
respectively); however, faith type alone is not linked to vaccination issues
and interacts with other national factors: Saudi Arabia – a country with
100% Muslim respondents – has a very low religious objection rate
(2%). As Grabenstein notes in a review of religious teachings and vaccina-
tion (Grabenstein, 2013), there are few religious groups, with the excep-
tion of Christian Scientists, whose official religious texts explicitly reject
immunization. Grabenstein's review found that most vaccine reluctance
and refusal, sometimes attributed to religious beliefs, is more related to
vaccine safety or other personal beliefs that are shared across a social net-
work within a religious congregation. Political, cultural, and historical
context modifies the effect of religion rather than being specifically tied
to theological beliefs. Our survey findings – showing varying views within
one religious group – also suggest that different political, cultural, and his-
torical contexts can additionally influence vaccine opinion.
The results of the hierarchical regression suggest that countries with
higher mean years of schooling are less likely to report positive vaccine senti-
ment, however within a country those with some education hold more
positive views on vaccine importance, effectiveness, and religious compatibil-
ity (though markedly not safety) than those without. There is evidence in the
recent literature to suggest that more highly educated elites in the Nether-
lands (Hak et al., 2005), the United States (Gilkey et al., 2014; Jones et al.,
2010), and Canada (Foty et al., 2010) hold vaccine skeptic views, which is
in keeping with the highest level of education of surveyed respondents (Mas-
ters/PhD) having the same vaccine importance sentiment as those with no or
little education. Further systematic reviews have highlighted the variability of
correlations found between education and vaccine confidence, with no clear
pattern except to show that education does not always imply confidence
(Brown et al., 2010; Larson et al., 2014a, 2014b). Other individuals with low
income, and the unemployed, also exhibit less positive vaccine views
The results of this study provide valuable insights on public opinion of
vaccines which can help enable policymakers and stakeholders to identify
countries of particular concern with respect to the four surveyed areas of
vaccine hesitancy. This study can hence be used as a baseline with which to
compare future surveys on vaccine hesitancy (thus monitoring the evolution
of vaccine hesitancy) and with which future surveys can be tailored to iden-
tify hesitancies toward particular vaccinations and investigate local drivers of
hesitancy. The findings herein, coupled with the recent literature on vaccine
confidence, point to the importance of continued worldwide monitoring of
confidence in vaccines, so that policymakers can monitor the effects of their
interventionsonimmunizationattitudesandacceptanceandmoreeffectively
allocate resources to address hesitancy issues and build confidence.
A limitation of this study is the generality of the survey questions,
which do not reveal whether the attitudes are related to specific vac-
cine(s) which an individual may have concerns about. A study of repeat-
ed surveys of vaccination attitudes in France (Peretti-Watel et al., 2013)
also considers general vaccine-skepticism, finding a link between chil-
dren unvaccinated against MMR and unfavorable attitudes towards vac-
cines as a whole. The ability to investigate the effect of skepticism
towards a particular vaccine on other vaccines and would help under-
stand how skepticism towards a particular vaccine can drive other
harmful vaccination behaviors. To address these issues, we propose an
extension to the five-point Likert scale questions to include statements
on immunization intent for specific vaccines.
A further limitation is the inability in the present study to track
temporal changes of immunization attitude. Repeated surveys allow
for a better understanding of the complex interplay between socio-eco-
nomic, political, and religious characteristics, vaccine sentiment, immu-
nization intent, and immunization rates (de Figueiredo et al., 2016).
Monitoring systems can be developed to track confidence, forecast
areas of concern, and lessen hesitancy through targeted intervention.
We believe this research has far-reaching public health implications,
and is particularly important in light of the variable progress in reaching
the Millennium Development Goals and implications for moving for-
ward in the context of new Sustainable Development Goals. The inter-
connectivity of vaccine confidence, confidence in the health system,
public trust in government more broadly, and socio-economic status
alongside the influences of religious and philosophical beliefs, suggest
that measuring vaccine confidence can be a valuable window on bigger
issues at play in the evolving health and development landscape.
