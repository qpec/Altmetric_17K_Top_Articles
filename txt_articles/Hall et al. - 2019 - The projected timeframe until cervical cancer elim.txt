Summary
Background In 2007, Australia was one of the first countries to introduce a national human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccination programme, and it has since achieved high vaccination coverage across both sexes. In December, 2017, 
organised cervical screening in Australia transitioned from cytology-based screening every 2 years for women aged 
from 18–20 years to 69 years, to primary HPV testing every 5 years for women aged 25–69 years and exit testing for 
women aged 70–74 years. We aimed to identify the earliest years in which the annual age-standardised incidence of 
cervical cancer in Australia (which is currently seven cases per 100 000 women) could decrease below two annual 
thresholds that could be considered to be potential elimination thresholds: a rare cancer threshold (six new cases per 
100 000 women) or a lower threshold (four new cases per 100 000 women), since Australia is likely to be one of the 
first countries to reach these benchmarks.
Methods In this modelling study, we used Policy1-Cervix—an extensively validated dynamic model of HPV vaccination, 
natural history, and cervical screening—to estimate the age-standardised incidence of cervical cancer in Australia 
from 2015 to 2100. We incorporated age-specific coverage of the Australian National HPV Vaccination Program in 
girls, including the catch-up programme, and the inclusion of boys into the vaccine programme from 2013, and a 
change from the quadrivalent to the nonavalent vaccine from 2018. We also modelled the effects of the transition to 
primary HPV screening. We considered two scenarios for future screening recommendations regarding the cohorts 
who will be and who have been offered the nonavalent vaccine: either that HPV screening every 5 years continues, or 
that no screening would be offered to these women.
Findings We estimate that, in Australia, the age-standardised annual incidence of cervical cancer will decrease to 
fewer than six new cases per 100 000 women by 2020 (range 2018–22), and to fewer than four new cases per 
100 000 women by 2028 (2021–35). The precise year of attaining these rates is dependent on the population used for 
age-standardisation, HPV screening behaviour and test characteristics, the incremental effects of vaccination of men 
on herd immunity in women, and assumptions about the future frequency of benign hysterectomies. By 2066 
(2054–77), the annual incidence of cervical cancer will decrease and remain at fewer than one case per 100 000 women 
if screening for HPV every 5 years continues for cohorts who have been offered the nonavalent vaccine, or fewer 
than three cases per 100 000 women if these cohorts are not screened. Cervical cancer mortality is estimated to 
decrease to less than an age-standardised annual rate of one death per 100 000 women by 2034 (2025–47), even if 
future screening is only offered to older cohorts that were not offered the nonavalent vaccine.
Interpretation If high-coverage vaccination and screening is maintained, at an elimination threshold of four new 
cases per 100 000 women annually, cervical cancer could be considered to be eliminated as a public health problem in 
Australia within the next 20 years. However, screening and vaccination initiatives would need to be maintained 
thereafter to maintain very low cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates.

Introduction
In May, 2018, the Director-General of WHO called for a 
“coordinated action globally to eliminate cervical 
cancer”.1,2 An elimination threshold in terms of cervical 
cancer incidence has not yet been defined, but an 
absolute incidence of cervical cancer could be chosen 
for such a threshold.
The incidence of cervical cancer and the associated 
mortality rate in Australia are among the lowest in the 
world. After the introduction of the National Cervical 
Screening Program (NCSP) in 1991, cervical cancer 
incidence in Australia decreased by approximately 
50% in women older than 25 years.3 The NCSP involved 
cytology-based screening every 2 years, from age 
18–20 years to age 69 years. Coverage of this programme, 
as reported in 2017, was approximately 70·2% over the 
3-year period 2013–15, and 83·0% over the 5-year period 
2011–15.4 On Dec 1, 2017, Australia transitioned to 
the renewed NCSP, a programme that involved 
primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening every

5 years for women aged 25–69 years and exit testing for 
women aged 70–74 years, with partial genotyping for 
HPV types 16 and 18 and liquid-based cytology triage 
for other HPV types.5 Large-scale clinical trials6 and 
detailed modelling7 suggest that primary HPV screening 
is more effective at detecting cervical abnormalities and 
preventing cervical cancer than screening with cytology 
at shorter intervals.6,7
Australia was the first country in the world to initiate a 
national publicly-funded HPV vaccination programme 
and to document its effects on intermediate outcomes.8–11 
The Australian National HPV Vaccination Program 
(NHVP) was rolled out in 2007, and used a quadrivalent 
vaccine (Gardasil [Merck]) in a three-dose schedule.12 
The 
quadrivalent 
vaccine 
protects 
against 
HPV 
types, 6, 11, 16, and 18; it is of note that HPV types 16 and 
18 are implicated in more than 70% of cervical cancers in 
Australia.13,14 The NHVP involves routine vaccination of 
girls aged 12–13 years, and a catch-up programme ran 
for women aged 14–26 years until 2009. Boys aged 
12–13 years were included in the programme from 2013, 
and a catch-up programme for boys aged 14–15 years ran 
until the end of 2015.14 There is increasing medical 
literature that documents the substantial effects that the 
NHVP has had on lowering the prevalence of vaccine-
included HPV types, anogenital warts, and precancerous 
lesions in cohorts who have been offered vaccination.8,15–17 
Coverage of the full course of three doses of the vaccine 
in those turning 15 years in 2016 was reported to be 
78·6% in girls and 72·9% in boys.
In 2018, the quadrivalent vaccine was replaced by a 
two-dose course of the nonavalent vaccine.18 Based on 
the underlying HPV type distribution among cervical 
cancers in Australia, the nonavalent vaccine will protect 
against HPV types that are implicated in about 90% of 
cases of cervical cancer.13 In Australia, this vaccine is 
predicted to reduce the lifetime risk of diagnosis with 
cervical cancer in vaccinated cohorts by 10% compared 
with those offered the quadrivalent vaccine, and by 
52% compared with unvaccinated cohorts, in the context 
of primary HPV screening.19 In the future, less frequent 
screening might be recommended for women who have 
been offered the nonavalent vaccine as adolescents; 
potentially, this frequency could be one or two screens in 
a lifetime.20,21
In a 2018 analysis,22 we estimated the combined effects 
of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine and a 2018 transition to 
HPV screening in Australia until 2035, with a focus on 
the transitional effects. This study is an extension of this 
previous analysis; we aimed to estimate the incidence of 
cervical cancer until 2100, explicitly accounting for the 
implemen 
tation of the nonavalent vaccine from 2018, 
and to estimate the year in which the elimination of 
cervical cancer as a public health issue will be achieved 
in Australia. We considered two scenarios for cohorts 
who are offered the nonavalent vaccine at age 
12–13 years: either that HPV screening continues, or 
that cervical screening is phased out and not offered to 
these cohorts.
The early adoption of both HPV vaccination and 
HPV-based cervical screening, high uptake of the vaccine, 
and high participation in screening position Australia as 
the first country that is likely to eliminate cervical cancer 
as a public health issue. We therefore aimed to identify the 
earliest years by which cervical cancer incidence could 
decrease below two absolute levels that could be 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies published in English from 
Jan 1, 2010, to Sept 24, 2018. The search terms used were 
“cervical cancer” and “timing OR timeline AND elimination”. 
No previous studies were identified that estimated the time to 
elimination of cervical cancer in any country. Australia was the 
first country in the world to initiate a fully funded national 
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme and has 
instituted HPV screening, and therefore is on track to be the 
first country to use interventional strategies to eliminate 
cervical cancer as a public health problem.
Added value of this study
We simulated the local HPV vaccination and screening 
environment in Australia, including the introduction of primary 
HPV testing in 2017, and the nonavalent HPV vaccine in 2018. 
We found that the incidence of cervical cancer is likely to decrease 
below a potential elimination threshold of fewer than four new 
cases per 100 000 women annually by 2028 (range 2021–35). 
Because the current cervical screening programme in Australia, 
which offers HPV testing every 5 years to women aged 
25–69 years and exit testing to women aged 70–74 years, is 
unlikely to be cost-effective for women who have received the 
nonavalent HPV vaccine as girls, we considered the effects of 
ceasing cervical screening in these cohorts; an age-standardised 
annual incidence of fewer than four cases per 100 000 women 
was still achieved and maintained in this scenario. Screening 
would continue to be required for older cohorts.
Implications of all the available evidence
The findings of this study offer a valuable insight into the 
achievability and timeliness of the call to action for cervical 
cancer elimination. Australia, the global front runner in cervical 
cancer prevention, is on track to eliminate cervical cancer as a 
public health problem by 2028 (range 2021–35). However, this 
population-level finding does not necessarily mean that 
inequities will not persist in some groups of women. Effective 
communication strategies will be required to maintain high 
coverage rates of the HPV vaccine (for younger cohorts) and of 
cervical screening (for women in older cohorts who were not 
offered the nonavalent vaccine).

considered as potential elimination thresholds: a rare 
cancer thres 
hold (an annual age-standardised incidence of 
six new cases per 100 000 women, as defined in Europe 
and Australia)23,24 and a lower threshold (four new cases 
per 100 000 women annually).
Methods
Model platform and parameterisation
In this modelling study, we used a well established and 
validated model platform, Policy1-Cervix.25 In brief, 
the platform consists of a dynamic model of HPV 
transmission, vaccination, natural history, and carcino-
genesis, which is overlaid with a model of cervical 
screening. Further details of the model structure are 
shown in the appendix (pp 3–4). The model input 
parameters are also described in the appendix (pp 4–5) 
and previous work.22,25
Vaccination assumptions
Our model assumed use of the nonavalent vaccine from 
2018, with a vaccine uptake (defined as a completed 
 
course) of 82% in girls and 76% in boys aged 12 years, 
based on the midpoint of observed two-dose and three-
dose coverage from 2017,18 assuming full efficacy of the 
vaccine at two doses if appropriately spaced. Observed 
vaccine uptake in previous years is also explicitly 
modelled; year-specific and age-specific vaccination 
coverage is based on published data and have previously 
been described in detail.22 The model assumed that 
vaccination of girls with the quadrivalent vaccine began 
in 2007, and that this vaccination included girls and 
women aged 12–26 years during the catch-up programme 
that ran until December, 2009, followed by ongoing 
vaccination of girls aged 12 years. The model assumed 
that vaccination of boys with the quadrivalent vaccine 
started in 2013, and included catch-up vaccination for 
boys aged 14–15 years until the end of 2014, followed by 
ongoing vaccination of boys aged 12 years. Vaccine 
efficacy was assumed to be 100% against vaccine-
included types, and duration was assumed to be lifelong. 
Cross-protection against non-vaccine included types was 
not considered. Incomplete courses were assumed to 
confer no protection.
Modelled scenarios and outcomes
We predicted the age-standardised incidence of cervical 
cancer and associated mortality rates in Australia each year 
from 2015 to 2100, considering all women aged up to 
84 years. Two screening scenarios were considered. The 
first screening scenario assumed that screening continues 
in all cohorts, regardless of whether they were offered 
the quadrivalent vaccine or the nonavalent vaccine. 
Assumptions about screening programme management 
and participation and vaccine coverage in boys and girls 
have previously been described in detail.22 The second 
screening scenario assumed ceasing cervical screening in 
cohorts offered the nonavalent vaccine as preadolescent 
girls (aged 12–13 years), but assumed that HPV screening 
every 5 years continues for older, unvaccinated cohorts and 
cohorts offered the quadrivalent vaccine, in accordance 
with the renewed NCSP. Although we have previously 
found that two screens per lifetime would remain cost-
effective in these cohorts,20 these two assumptions (no 
screening vs the renewed NCSP) bounds a wide range of 
intermediate screening possibilities for cohorts offered the 
nonavalent vaccine. Because of the herd protection that is 
provided by the high vaccine coverage in Australia, we did 
not distinguish between screening assumptions for 
vaccinated and unvaccinated women within cohorts who 
had been offered the nonavalent vaccination.
The model simulated cohorts of women in Australia 
born between 1931 and 2100 to obtain annual estimates of 
the incidence of cervical cancer and asso 
ciated mortality 
from 2015 to 2100. We defined the year of elimination as 
the first year when the age-standardised annual incidence 
(ages 0–84 years, standardised to the Australian Standard 
Population, 2001) decreased to fewer than four new cases 
per 100 000 women or six new cases per 100 000 women 
(as appropriate). These thresholds were chosen because 
an annual incidence of four cases per 100 000 people is 
two-thirds of the Australian and European definitions of a 
rare cancer,23,24 and represents a relative reduction in 
cervical cancer incidence of more than 70% compared 
with the global average age-standardised rate, which was

14 cases per 100 000 women in 2012. Cumulative lifetime 
risks of cervical cancer were calculated for individual 
birth cohorts born between 1971 (the first cohort offered 
cytology screening every 2 years from age 18–20 years) 
and 2090. For calculations of mortality rates, we assumed 
that stage-specific cervical cancer survival was unchanged 
from the current rate (a conservative assumption)—ie, 
that mortality improvements were entirely derived 
from reductions in the incidence of cervical cancer 
from vaccination, screening, and downstaging due to 
screening.
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was done to quantify the effects of 
several factors on the predicted year of elimination. 
Parameters considered in one-way analysis included: 
HPV test sensitivity, liquid-based cytology test sensitivity 
(for reflex testing of HPV-positive women), compliance 
to routine cervical screening, the frequency of benign 
hysterectomy, inclusion of boys in the NHVP, and 
age-standardising population structure assumptions. 
Parameter assump 
tions and outcomes of the sensitivity 
analysis are described in detail in the appendix (p 8). 
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data and had final responsibility to submit for 
publication.
Results
The base-case estimates for the age-standardised 
(Australian Standard Population, 2001) annual incidence 
of invasive cervical cancer and associated mortality from 
2015 to 2100 are shown in figure 1; these estimates are 
shown in the presence and absence of the continuation of 
screening for cohorts who are offered the nonavalent 
vaccine at age 12–13 years. Assuming ongoing high 
coverage of existing vaccination and screening, the rare 
cancer threshold of six new cases per 100 000 women 
each year will be achieved in 2020 and cervical 
cancer elimination (if defined as four new cases per 
100 000 women each year) is predicted to occur in 2028. If 
existing HPV-based screening continues, the incidence of 
cervical cancer would reach 0·57 cases per 100 000 women 
in 2100, which is 91% lower than the simulated 
incidence in 2006 (pre-vaccination; 6·66 new cases per 
100 000 women) and 96% lower than the incidence in 
1990 (before the introduction of organised cervical 
screening; 13·5 cases per 100 000 women). In a scenario 
in which cohorts offered the nonavalent vaccine are not 
screened, cervical cancer incidence is estimated to be 
2·31 cases per 100 000 women in 2100, which is 65% lower

than the incidence in 2006 and 83% lower than the 
incidence in 1990. Under this scenario the incidence of 
cervical cancer and associated mortality rates are expected 
to reach a steady state by 2090. 
Mortality from cervical cancer is predicted to decrease 
to one new case per 100 000 women annually by 2034 and 
to remain around this rate. If screening continues in the 
cohorts who are offered the nonavalent vaccine, mortality 
will continue to decrease to less than 0·15 cases per 
100 000 women each year (which equates to fewer than 
three cases per 1 million women) by 2100 (figure 1). The 
annual cases of and deaths from cervical cancer for both 
scenarios are shown in the appendix (pp 6–7). 
The age-standardised annual incidence of cervical 
cancer per 100 000 women, stratified by HPV-type group 
(16 or 18 vs other types) and age are shown in figure 2. 
Cervical cancer that is attributable to HPV types 16 or 18 is 
predicted to decrease to fewer than four new cases per 
100 000 women by 2021, and the incidence of cervical 
cancer that is attributable to HPV types other than 16 and 
18 is already less than this value. If cohorts who are 
offered the nonavalent vaccine are not screened, the 
incidence of cervical cancer that is attributable to HPV 
types other than 16 or 18 is predicted to increase from 
2043 onwards, which is when the first of these cohorts 
would have entered the screening programme. In the 
scenario that assumes that all cohorts receive ongoing 
cervical screening, reductions in the incidence of cervical 
cancer relative to that in 2100 are estimated to be 
91% compared with incidence in 2006 (before the 
introduction of the quadrivalent vaccine; 0·23 cases 
per 100 000 women in 2100 vs 2·57 cases per 
100 000 women in 2006) and 94% compared with 
incidence in 1990 (ie, before the introduction of organised 
cervical screening; 4·14 cases per 100 000 women) in 
women aged 15–29 years; 92% versus 2006 (0·98 cases 
per 100 000 women in 2100 vs 12·25 cases per 
100 000 women in 2006) and 96% versus 1990 (21·86 cases 
per 100 000 women) in those aged 30–49 years; and 
91% versus 2006 (0·82 cases per 100 000 women in 2100 
vs 9·41 cases per 100 000 women in 2006) and 96% versus 
1990 (21·38 cases per 100 000 women) in those aged 
50–84 years. If cohorts who are offered the nonavalent 
vaccine are not screened, reductions in the incidence of 
cervical cancer in 2100 are estimated to be 91% compared 
with incidence in 2006 and 94% compared with incidence 
in 1990 in women aged 15–29 years (at an estimated 
incidence in 2100 of 0·23 cases per 100 000 women); 
74% versus 2006 and 85% versus 1990 in those aged 
30–49 years (3·23 cases per 100 000 women); and 
51% versus 2006 and 78% versus 1990 in those aged 
50–84 years (4·64 cases per 100 000 women).
The cumulative lifetime risk of cervical cancer and 
associated mortality by birth cohort for women born 
between 1971 and 2090 is shown in figure 3, both in the 
presence and the absence of continuation of the renewed 
NCSP for cohorts who are offered the nonavalent vaccine. 
Each birth cohort is uniquely affected by factors 
associated with cervical screening and the vaccination 
programme. Notably, in the scenario where all cohorts 
are eligible for cervical screening, the cumulative lifetime 
risk of disease and associated mortality decreases for 
cohorts born in 2006 or later, which corresponds to the 
cohorts offered the nonavalent vaccine. In the context of

Data are (A) cumulative lifetime risk; and (B) cumulative lifetime risk, relative to the prevaccinated risk. 
The prevaccinated risk refers to the cumulative lifetime risk calculated for the 1971 birth cohort (ie, the 
first Australian cohort who received organised cervical screening and were not offered human papillomavirus 
vaccination). NCSP=National Cervical Screening Program.

ongoing HPV screening every 5 years for these cohorts, 
for cohorts born in 2006, the cumulative lifetime risk of 
cervical cancer is 0·07% and the cumulative lifetime risk 
mortality is 0·02%. These numbers represent an 
89·9% reduction in lifetime risk of cervical cancer 
diagnosis and 90·0% reduction in lifetime risk of death 
associated with cervical cancer compared with these risks 
in the 1971 birth cohort in Australia (vs 0·52% risk of 
cancer and 0·15% risk of cervical cancer mortality in 
1971). In the scenario in which the cohorts who are 
offered the nonavalent vaccine are not screened, their 
lifetime risk of cervical cancer and mortality is higher 
than those who are screened. In the cohort born in 2006 
(the first cohort offered the nonavalent vaccine), the 
lifetime risk of cervical cancer diagnosis is 0·33% and 
the lifetime risk of death associated with cervical cancer 
is 0·15% (figure 3). Notably, the lifetime risk of death 
associated with cervical cancer under this scenario for 
those born in 2006 is equivalent to that of cohorts born in 
Australia in 1971, who have been offered screening with 
cytology since age 20 years and HPV-based screening 
since age 47 years, but who are unvaccinated. The lifetime 
risk of cervical cancer diagnosis in cohorts offered 
the nonavalent vaccine in this scenario would be 
approximately equal to that for the 1988 cohort, who were 
vaccinated with the quadrivalent vaccine at age 19 years 
under the NHVP catch-up in 2007 and who were offered 
primary HPV screening from 2018 (figure 3).
The findings of this analysis are highly sensitive to 
the population used for age-standardisation and the 
frequency of benign hysterectomy in these assump 
tions 
change the predicted year of cervical cancer elimination 
(at the threshold of four new cases per 100 000 women 
each year) by up to 7 years (figure 4).26–28 However, 
parameter assumptions for primary (and triage) 
screening test sensitivity and screening compliance, and 
the exclusion of boys from the NHVP had little effect on 
the predicted year of elimination. Overall, our base-case 
estimate for the year of cervical cancer elimination was 
2028 (if a threshold of four new cases per 100 000 women 
each year is used), but a sensitivity analysis indicates that 
the elimination year could vary from 2021 to 2035.
Discussion
We found that, if the current levels of vaccination and 
screening coverage are maintained, the annual incidence 
of cervical cancer in Australia is likely to decrease to 
fewer than six new cases per 100 000 women by 2020 
(range 2018–22) and to fewer than four cases per 
100 000 women by 2028 (2021–35). The annual incidence 
of cervical cancer could decrease to one new case per 
100 000 by 2066 (2054–77) if the existing HPV-based 
screening programme continues in cohorts who are 
offered the nonavalent vaccine; but if screening is 
discontinued in these cohorts, the annual incidence will 
plateau at around three cases per 100 000 women. We 
estimate that the mortality rates associated with cervical 
cancer will decrease to less than one case per 
100 000 women by 2034 (2025–47). These estimates 
depend on several factors, including the population used 
for age-standardisation: incidence will decrease to less 
than four cases per 100 000 women between 2021 and 
2035, depending on these factors.
The incidence of cervical cancer and associated 
mortality are predicted to decrease steadily following an 
initial fluctuation after the transition from cytology-based 
screening every 2 years to primary HPV screening every 
5 years, because of the increased effectiveness of 
screening and the replacement of the quadrivalent 
vaccine with the nonavalent vaccine in 2018. The annual 
age-standardised incidence of cervical cancers that are 
attributable to HPV types 16 or 18 is expected to decrease 
sharply soon after the transition to primary HPV 
screening, in response to the differential management of 
women with HPV types 16 or 18 in the renewed NCSP. 
Continuing reductions in the incidence of cervical cancer 
will also result from the introduction of the NHVP 
programme in 2007
. A reduction in the incidence of 
cervical cancer that is associated with HPV types other 
than 16 or 18 is predicted to occur more slowly than for 
those attributed to HPV 16 or 18 because cervical cancer 
that is attributable to HPV types other than 16 or 18 is 
more common in older women.29
Previous studies21,30 that evaluated cervical screening in 
cohorts who have been vaccinated with the nonavalent 
vaccine in several developed countries found that routine 
HPV screening every 5 years for women aged 25–74 years 
might not be cost-effective. It is therefore possible that 
the frequency of screening in Australia will eventually be 
reduced for women who have been vaccinated with the 
nonavalent vaccine. Although it is likely that some form 
of HPV-based screening will be offered to these cohorts, 
we simulated an extreme case in which women are not 
offered any cervical screening. We did not distinguish 
between vaccinated and unvaccinated women within 
cohorts being offered the nonavalent vaccine in 
Australia, because findings suggest that the reduction

in vaccine-preventable infections is high (87%) in 
unvaccinated women in cohorts who have been offered 
vaccination; these reductions in infections are similar 
to those reported for vaccinated individuals in the 
cohort (94%).17 Although these findings relate to HPV 
types included in the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, the 
herd protection provided by the nonavalent vaccine is 
anticipated to be at least as substantial as the quadrivalent 
vaccine, owing to the fact that HPV type 16 (included in 
the quadrivalent vaccine and the nonavalent vaccine) 
might be the most difficult type to eliminate.31 We found 
that the annual age-standardised incidence of cervical 
cancer in Australia is predicted to plateau below a 
potential elimination threshold (at four cases per 
100 000 women) if cohorts offered the nonavalent vaccine 
do not receive cervical screening.
Our medium-term predictions for the incidence 
of cervical cancer are similar to estimates published 
for England,32 which found that primary HPV screening 
and vaccination with the nonavalent vaccine (with 
screening coverage and vaccine uptake assumptions in 
women similar to those that we used in this analysis) is 
likely to reduce the annual age-standardised incidence of 
cervical cancer and the associated mortality rate in 
England by 28% in 2036–40 compared with estimates of 
incidence over the same time period in which cytology 
every 3 years and vaccination against only HPV 
types 16 and 18 were used. Our results are broadly 
consistant with this finding, since we found that 
scenarios that assumed a transition to the renewed NCSP 
showed an age-standardised incidence of cervical cancer 
that was 33% lower than if the pre-renewed NCSP had 
been maintained (as previously published).22 In a 
sensitivity analysis, we found that, had boys not been 
included in the NHVP in Australia, the elimination of 
cervical cancer would have been delayed by 2 years, 
which is broadly consistent with the findings from Marc 
Brisson and colleagues’ systematic review and meta-
analysis,31 which indicated that the relative reduction 
in HPV16 prevalence after vaccinating women at 
80% coverage increased by only 7% when boys were 
added to the vaccination pro 
gramme. The vaccination 
coverage of girls in Australia is high: the national three-
dose coverage for girls turning 15 years in 2016 is 78·6%. 
In this context, our findings suggest that the addition of 
vaccination of boys has not substantially affected the 
timing of elimination in Australia.
There are several strengths to our analysis. To our 
knowledge, this study represents the first estimation of 
the time to elimination of cervical cancer at a country 
level. We separately reported the incidence of cervical 
cancer and associated mortality rate,25 in which we 
simulated the transition to the renewed NCSP in 
December, 2017, and the introduction of the nonavalent 
vaccine in 2018. We used a model of HPV transmission, 
vaccination, HPV natural history, and cervical screening, 
which has been comprehensively calibrated and validated 
in several settings.22 We con 
sidered detailed Australian 
vaccination coverage and screening compliance rates and 
herd effects. Manage 
ment assumptions regarding the 
renewed NCSP were based on the programme guidelines5 
that were published in 2016, and expert advice. The 
effectiveness of cervical screening depends on the 
distribution of underlying health states in the population 
(for example, whether women are disease-free, HPV-
infected, or have cervical pre-cancer or cancer), the 
characteristics of the screening test used (such as test 
sensitivity and specificity), and screening behaviour 
(such as whether women return as recommended for 
their next test). All these factors are modelled explicitly 
for each cohort of women with the Policy1-Cervix 
platform. To determine population-level outcomes, each 
individual cohort is simulated.
Our study has some limitations. As with any modelling 
study, the results that we present are dependent on the 
assumptions made. For example, we assumed no vaccine 
efficacy at one dose (a conservative assumption for 
vaccine efficacy). We assumed a vaccine coverage rate 
with the new two-dose schedule that was halfway between 
the currently observed two-dose and three-dose coverage 
for boys and girls; however, if higher coverage is achieved 
for two-dose course-completion we might have under-
estimated the effects of HPV vaccination in Australia. We 
did not account for immigration effects in the model, 
which could result in the underestimation of the time to 
elimination, because 28% of the Australian population in 
2015 was born overseas, and not all immigrants have a 
history of cervical screening or HPV vaccination.33 A 
further exploratory analysis (data not shown) found that 
immigration might delay the timeline to elimination of 
cervical cancer in Australia by up to 4 years, assuming 
that 28% of the population do not benefit from HPV 
vaccination. This finding is likely to be a worst-case 
scenario, since many immigrants have HPV vaccination 
programmes in their countries of birth, or they arrive at 
an age that is young enough for them to be eligible to 
receive free HPV vaccination in Australia.2,34,35 Additionally, 
high female-only coverage by HPV vaccines in Australia 
has already been shown to have produced herd effects in 
unvaccinated women, and the level of coverage we have 
assumed is close to that where modelling studies suggest 
that vaccine-included HPV types could eventually be 
eradicated.17,31 Some immigrants might arrive with an 
infection that subsequently causes cancer, since these 
typically are acquired at younger ages, which reinforces 
the importance of screening.36
Our findings imply that the elimination of cervical 
cancer could be on the horizon for high-income countries, 
such as Australia. Our findings suggest that continuation 
of nonavalent vaccination might be sufficient to keep 
cervical cancer incidence at fewer than four cases per 
100 000 women; however, a concurrent national cervical 
screening programme is necessary for reducing the 
incidence of cervical cancer even further (such as to less

than one case per 100 000 women each year). Of those 
adolescents in Australia who turned 15 years in 2016, 
79% of girls and 73% of boys are fully vaccinated whereas, 
in less developed regions, it was estimated that only 
2·7% of women aged 10–20 years have been fully 
vaccinated.37 Cervical cancer incidence in low-income and 
middle-income countries could also be substantially 
reduced through a combination of screening and 
vaccination; however, major initiatives are required to 
achieve high coverage of vaccination and cervical 
screening.
It is important to note that our analysis provides 
predictions across the entire Australian population, and 
the findings are not generalisable to specific population 
subgroups, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
women, migrants, or disadvantaged subpopulations. 
Although the effects of HPV vaccination in Australia 
appear to have been similar in Indigenous and non-
Indigenous Australians15,38 and across areas of different 
socioeconomic groups,39 participation in screening differs 
by Indigenous status and area-level socioeconomic 
status.4,40 Indigenous women are 2·5 times more likely to 
be diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 3·8 times more 
likely to die of the disease than non-Indigenous women.41 
This discrepancy is, in part, due to lower participation in 
screening.41 The new primary HPV screening programme 
will include the option of self-collection for under-screened 
women, which could help improve the acceptability of 
screening for Indigenous Australian women. However, it 
is likely that if disparities continue to persist, elimination 
of cervical cancer will be delayed for Indigenous women. 
To achieve equity for all population subgroups in the 
elimination of cervical cancer, it will be important to 
reduce disparities in screening participation between 
population subgroups and to maintain high coverage by 
vaccination across all groups.
In conclusion, our analysis has, to the best of our 
knowledge, been the first study to quantify the timeline 
to cervical cancer elimination in Australia, the first 
country that is positioned to achieve it through active 
control measures. If high-coverage vaccination and 
screening is maintained, and if an elimination threshold 
of four cases per 100 000 women is chosen, cervical 
cancer is on track to be eliminated as a public health 
problem in Australia within the next 20 years. However, 
screening and vaccination initiatives would need to be 
maintained thereafter to continue to achieve very low 
incidence of, and mortality from, cervical cancer.
