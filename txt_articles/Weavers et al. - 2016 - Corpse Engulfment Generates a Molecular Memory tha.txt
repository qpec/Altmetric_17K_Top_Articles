SUMMARY
Macrophages are multifunctional cells that perform
diverse roles in health and disease. Emerging evi-
dence has suggested that these innate immune cells
might also be capable of developing immunological
memory, a trait previously associated with the adap-
tive system alone. While recent studies have focused
on the dramatic macrophage reprogramming that
follows infection and protects against secondary
microbial attack, can macrophages also develop
memory in response to other cues? Here, we show
that apoptotic corpse engulfment by Drosophila
macrophages is an essential primer for their inflam-
matory response to tissue damage and infection
in vivo. Priming is triggered via calcium-induced
JNK signaling, which leads to upregulation of the
damage receptor Draper, thus providing a molecular
memory that allows the cell to rapidly respond to
subsequent injury or infection. This remarkable plas-
ticity and capacity for memory places macrophages
as key therapeutic targets for treatment of inflamma-
tory disorders.
INTRODUCTION
Traditionally, the innate immune system has been distinguished
from the adaptive system by its marked lack of immunological
memory (Roitt et al., 2006). While innate (phagocyte-mediated)
responses were considered to be the rapid and non-adaptable
‘‘first line of defense’’ against tissue damage and infection, the
ability to mount highly specific and adaptable responses had
been restricted to the lymphocyte-mediated adaptive system.
However, there is now increasing evidence that cells of the
innate immune system can become reprogrammed to develop
immunological memory of previous encounters (Netea et al.,
2011; Quintin et al., 2014).
The development of such innate memory is of clear impor-
tance to those organisms that lack an adaptive immune system
(such as plants and invertebrates), which can provide valuable
resistance to secondary infections in the absence of lympho-
cyte-mediated responses (Durrant and Dong, 2004; Pham
et al., 2007; Rodrigues et al., 2010). However, innate immune
memory also provides important protection in mammalian sys-
tems, where it functions in parallel with classical B and T cell-
dependent adaptive responses. Indeed, mice lacking functional
T and B cells can develop cross-protection against secondary
bacterial and fungal infections based on innate immune training
alone (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012; Quintin et al., 2012). Mono-
cytes, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells have emerged
as the main innate immune cells responsible for this priming
phenomenon and appear to undergo a profound phenotypic re-
programming upon exposure to microbial stimuli that changes
their response to secondary infection (Bowdish et al., 2007).
Until now, research in this field has primarily focused on the
innate training that occurs in response to primary infection and
the mechanisms by which this confers resistance to secondary
microbial attack—a process that has been termed ‘‘trained
immunity’’ (Bistoni et al., 1986, 1988; Quintin et al., 2012; Vec-
chiarelli et al., 1989). However, innate immune cells, such as mac-
rophages, are multifunctionalcells that not only fight infection, but
also perform a range of additional key roles in health and disease.
These include the phagocytosis and clearance of dying apoptotic
cells, the removal of necrotic cells within damaged tissue, the
deposition and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM), and
the surveillance of abnormal (e.g., cancer) cells (Murray and
Wynn, 2011; Wood and Jacinto, 2007). Therefore, it is conceiv-
ablethat macrophages mightalso become‘‘trained’’ anddevelop
immunological memory in response to these other stimuli.
The concept of macrophages as multifunctional cells raises
the possibility that exposure to each individual stimulus could
reprogram the macrophage so that is responds differently to
subsequent stimuli. It is well documented that macrophages
display remarkable phenotypic plasticity and can acquire
specialized functional phenotypes (often described as M1/M2)
in response to a variety of different environmental cytokines
and pathogens, giving rise to a spectrum of different macro-
phage subsets that play diverse roles during host defense,
wound repair, and tissue homeostasis (Martinez and Gordon,
2014; Mosser and Edwards, 2008).

 One of the key functions of macrophages in vivo is the clear-
ance of dying apoptotic cells, both during normal develop-
ment/tissue homeostasis (Jacobson et al., 1997; Kerr et al.,
1972; Wood et al., 2000) and at sites of inflammation (Martin
and Leibovich, 2005). Although apoptosis was traditionally
considered to be ‘‘immunologically neutral’’ (Meagher et al.,
1992; Stern et al., 1996), more recent studies have suggested
it may have powerful immunological effects, being both pro or
anti-inflammatory depending on context (Savill et al., 2002).
Determining the exact mechanism by which apoptosis affects
macrophage behavior in vivo requires a genetically tractable
model in which it is possible to precisely manipulate different
macrophage stimuli and intracellular signaling pathways. Here,
the Drosophila embryo serves as an ideal system, which has
been used extensively to model the innate inflammatory
response to tissue damage and infection (Evans et al., 2015;
Moreira et al., 2010; Razzell et al., 2013; Vlisidou et al., 2009).
We exploit the optical translucency of the Drosophila embryo
to observe macrophage priming in real time in vivo using high-
resolution time-lapse imaging.
In this study, we exploit the natural apoptotic cell death that
occurs during Drosophila development to investigate the role
of corpse uptake on the response of macrophages to tissue
damage and infection in vivo. We find that corpse phagocytosis
is an essential step to prime macrophages for a robust inflamma-
tory recruitment to wounds and uptake of bacteria. We go on to
dissect the molecular mechanism by which these immune cells
build this memory and show that corpse uptake triggers rapid
intracellular calcium bursts within the macrophage, that together
with elevated JNK activity and expression of the CED-1 homolog
Draper, are required for the macrophage priming effect. Naive
macrophages, from H99 mutants that lack programmed cell
death, are unresponsive to wounds and bacterial invasion, but
these defects can be rescued by uptake of UV-induced
apoptotic corpses or ectopic activation of Draper expression.
We conclude that apoptotic corpses generate a molecular
memory within macrophages that has a subsequent pro-inflam-
matory effect on macrophage behavior that could function in vivo
to boost the innate inflammatory response at inflamed sites
associated with extensive apoptotic cell death.
RESULTS
Macrophages Employ Diverse Strategies to Clear Dying
Apoptotic Cells In Vivo
During embryogenesis, Drosophila macrophages (hemocytes)
migrate from their origin in the head mesoderm, along highly ste-
reotypical routes posteriorly along the ventral nerve cord (VNC;
Figure 1A) (Tepass et al., 1994). At this time, significant numbers
of apoptotic cells are generated during the developmental
sculpting of tissues, including neurons within the VNC, and these
are rapidly phagocytosed by the migrating macrophages (Movie
S1; Figures 1B–1G) (Franc et al., 1999; Suzanne and Steller,
2013; Tepass et al., 1994).
Macrophages initially migrate along the midline of the VNC,
guided by local PDGF/VEGF (Pvf) guidance cues expressed
along the route of migration (Cho et al., 2002; Wood et al.,
2006). The leading ‘‘pioneer’’ cells rarely leave the midline as
they
migrate
posteriorly
and
predominantly
phagocytose
apoptotic corpses in their near vicinity (Figure 1D; Movie S1),
but occasionally they extend long cytoplasmic arms (‘‘pseudo-
pods’’) that contact and engulf outlying apoptotic corpses that
are positioned more laterally (up to 40 mm from the midline) (Fig-
ure 1E; Movie S1). These pseudopods are rapidly retracted back
into the cell body, delivering the apoptotic corpse to the cell for
degradation.
In contrast, macrophages positioned further back in the
migrating cluster are less spatially constrained (Evans et al.,
2010) and migrate laterally out from the midline in response to
an apoptotic corpse (arrow, Figure 1B). These macrophages
move directly toward the dying cells (Figure 1F; Movie S1), re-
turning back to the midline once engulfment is complete, and
only rarely extend the long pseudopods characteristic of the
leading cells. The relative contributions of each uptake strategy
for the two different populations are depicted in Figure 1G. The
differences in uptake strategy most likely reflect early spatial
constraints within the developing embryo; macrophages migrate
in the extracellular space between the overlying epithelium and
underlying VNC, and this space develops in a strict anterior to
posterior fashion (Evans et al., 2010).
Individual macrophages progressively phagocytose large
numbers of apoptotic corpses that accumulate in the cytoplasm
as large vacuoles (inset, Figure 1H). Quantification of corpse up-
take reveals that over 80% of macrophages have engulfed and
contain at least four corpses by stage 14 (Figure 1I). At this stage,
macrophages have completed their developmental migrations
and reached the three rows characteristic of mature embryos
(Figure 1H). The original populations of ‘‘leading’’ and ‘‘trailing’’
macrophages have become interspersed along the rows. Corp-
ses can be detected by immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3
(Figure 1J). In order to visualize apoptotic cells in living embryos,
we expressed the fluorescent caspase sensor Apoliner (Bardet
et al., 2008) ubiquitously throughout the embryo (Figure 1K).
The Apoliner sensor comprises mRFP and eGFP fluorophores,
separated by a specific caspase cleavage site, and is normally
retained at the cell surface through a mCD8 transmembrane
domain. Upon caspase activation, the sensor is cleaved and
eGFP translocates to the nucleus. Using this approach, GFP-
positive apoptotic nuclei were observed within macrophages in
living embryos (arrowheads, Figure 1K).
Apoptotic Corpses Prime Drosophila Macrophages for
Detection of Tissue Damage
To establish whether apoptotic corpse engulfment influences a
macrophage’s ability to respond to tissue damage, we gener-
ated embryos that completely lacked apoptosis (Figure 2). We
utilized a chromosomal deletion (deficiency Df(3)H99) that re-
moves the three genes head-involution-defective (hid), reaper
(rpr), and grim (grm) that control developmental programmed
cell death in Drosophila (Chen et al., 1996; Grether et al., 1995;
White et al., 1994, 1996). In their absence, the normal regimen
of programmed cell death does not occur, resulting in embryos
that completely lack apoptosis (White et al., 1994). The ‘‘naive’’
macrophages have no opportunity to engulf apoptotic corpses
and so lack the large intracellular vacuoles (phagocytosed

1659
 corpses) characteristic of wild-type cells (cf. Figure 2A with Fig-
ure 2G; Movie S2).
Despite the lack of apoptosis in the developing nerve cord
(and other tissues), macrophage specification and develop-
mental dispersal along the VNC appears indistinguishable from
wild-type (Figure 2B). Macrophages are present in normal
numbers (Figure S1A), migrate laterally at speeds similar to
wild-type (Figure S1B), and exhibit normal contact inhibition of
locomotion (Davis et al., 2012), reaching the stereotypical
three-row arrangement by stage 14 (Figure 2C). Apoptotic
corpse clearance therefore seems not to be required for early
macrophage development or migration (Cho et al., 2002).
However, when H99 mutant embryos were wounded the
normal inflammatory response of macrophages was completely
blocked such that naive H99 macrophages failed to accumulate
at the wound site and continued with contact-inhibition migration

 stereotypical of unwounded embryos (compare Figures 2D–2D00
with control Figures 2F–2F00, quantified in Figure 2E; Movie S3),
despite normal production of the pro-inflammatory wound
attractant H2O2 (Figures 2I and 2J) (Moreira et al., 2010; Niet-
hammer et al., 2009). Although H99 macrophages are not at-
tracted over long distances toward the damaged tissue, those
macrophages in the immediate vicinity of the wound are seen
to phagocytose necrotic wound debris (arrowheads, Figure 2H),
indicating that they are not impaired in their ability to detect or
phagocytose damaged, dying cells.
Taken together, these data suggest that macrophages
generate a molecular memory of their encounter with an
apoptotic corpse, and that uptake of these corpses may be an
essential pre-requisite for macrophage detection of tissue dam-
age in vivo.
An alternative explanation for the impaired inflammatory
recruitment of macrophages in H99 mutants is that apoptotic
corpses at wild-type wounds are a key attractant contributing
to macrophage inflammatory chemotaxis. However, this cannot
be the case, because apoptosis could not be detected in the
damaged epithelium following wounding by CC3 immunostain-
ing (Figures 2K–2L0), Apoliner imaging (Figures S1C–S1D0), or
Acridine Orange staining (Figures S1E–S1F0). CC3 positive
corpses were observed within macrophages at the wound site
(arrowheads, Figures 2L and 2L0), but they are also found outside
of the wound (outlines, Figure 2K; also arrows, Figure S1E) and
likely reflect corpses engulfed during prior developmental
dispersal; indeed 100% of macrophages contain at least one
apoptotic corpse in unwounded embryos by this stage (Figures
1H–1K). To further confirm that apoptotic cell death at the wound

 site does not play a role in macrophage recruitment, we analyzed
the

wound
response
following
inhibition
of
apoptosis within the wounded epithelium (Figures S1G and
S1H). Expression of the pan-caspase inhibitor p35 (Bump et al.,
1995; Hay et al., 1994) throughout the epithelium did not affect
macrophage recruitment to wounds (Figures S1G and S1H).
Given that caspases have been implicated in playing a role in
cell motility that is unrelated to apoptosis (Geisbrecht and Mon-
tell, 2004), we tested whether caspase activity is required within
macrophages for their wound recruitment (Figures S1I and S1J).
However, macrophage-specific expression of p35 (Bump et al.,
1995; Hay et al., 1994) had no effect on inflammatory wound
recruitment, macrophage numbers, or migration speed (Figures
S1I and S1J; data not shown).
Experimental Priming of Naive Macrophages by
Apoptotic Corpse Uptake Rescues the Wound
Inflammatory Response
To determine whether macrophages are primed by performing
phagocytosis per se or specifically require uptake of apoptotic
corpses, we tested whether engulfment of fluorescent beads
(of approximately the same size as a corpse) could artificially
prime naive H99 macrophages (Figures 3A–3G). Both wild-type
(Figures 3A and 3A0) and naive H99 macrophages (Figures 3C
and 3C0) readily phagocytose fluorescent beads injected into
the hemolymph. Bead uptake did not, however, rescue the in-
flammatory wound recruitment defect of naive H99 macro-
phages (Figures 3D–3D00, 3E, and low magnification in 3G) nor
did it affect the recruitment of wild-type macrophages to wounds
(Figures 3B–3B00, 3E, and low magnification in 3F).
These data suggest that macrophage priming by phagocy-
tosis is specific to the uptake of apoptotic corpses. To test
this, we attempted to prime naive H99 macrophages in vivo by
stimulating apoptotic corpse uptake (Figures 3H–3M). Apoptosis
can be experimentally induced in individual cells in vivo by a
focused pulse of 405 nm (UV) laser illumination (Figures 3H–
3H00) (Moreira et al., 2010). Following UV exposure, the targeted
epithelial cell is rapidly extruded from the surrounding epithelium
by a contractile actin cable (insets, Figures 3H and 3H0) and the
cell delaminates basally into the interior of the embryo (inset, Fig-
ure 3H00). The dying cell is rapidly detected by nearby macro-
phages that engulf the cell as it delaminates from the epithelium
(Figures 3H–3H00).
UV induces apoptosis in H99 embryos despite the absence of
the upstream rpr, hid, and grim genes (Figures 3I and 3J) (White
et al., 1994). In this way, apoptotic corpses could be generated
and observed within H99 macrophages by CC3 staining both
during (Figure 3I) and after engulfment (Figure 3J). To attempt
to rescue macrophage priming, multiple apoptosis events were
triggered in H99 mutants to ensure that the majority of naive
H99 macrophages had engulfed at least one apoptotic corpse
(Figure 3K). Strikingly, this approach successfully rescued
macrophage recruitment to tissue damage, when the wounds
were made 90 min post-corpse induction (Figures 3L–3L00 and
3M). This rescue was not observed for wounds made only
30 min following corpse uptake (Figure 3M), suggesting that
apoptosis-induced macrophage priming requires more than
30 min post-phagocytosis to alter cell behavior.
Corpse-Associated Calcium Bursts Are Essential for
Macrophage Detection of Tissue Damage
Intracellular calcium signaling has been linked to apoptotic
corpse uptake in worms, flies, and mammals (Cuttell et al.,
2008; Gronski et al., 2009; Rubartelli et al., 1997) and was a
promising candidate to mediate the macrophage priming
response. We monitored the intracellular calcium dynamics of
macrophages in real time (Figure 4), by macrophage-specific
expression of the intracellular calcium reporter GCaMP3 (Tian
et al., 2009). Macrophages experienced frequent but transient
increases in cytosolic calcium levels (GCaMP3 fluorescence)
that were each associated with apoptotic corpse engulfment
(Figures 4A–4F; Movies S4 and S5). We find that 100% of cal-
cium flashes are accompanied by corpse uptake (observed
from a total of 68 phagocytic events in 45 different macro-
phages). Tracking of individual macrophages over time revealed
that multiple calcium flashes occur within a single cell (Figures
4C and 4E), with each flash being linked to separate corpse
engulfment events (Figures 4D0 and 4F0).
To determine whether the macrophage calcium transients
were an important mechanism mediating macrophage priming,
we expressed parvalbumin (PV), a vertebrate-specific calcium
binding protein that negatively regulates calcium levels in
Drosophila (Harrisingh et al., 2007; Mortimer et al., 2013), spe-
cifically in macrophages (Figure 4G). Inhibition of calcium
flashes in macrophages significantly impaired their inflamma-
tory response to tissue damage (Figure 4G and 4G0). There
was a dramatic reduction in the number of macrophages re-
cruited to the wound (Figure 4H), similar to that seen in H99
mutants, although macrophage number, developmental migra-
tion speed, and corpse uptake were unaffected (Figures S2A–
S2C). These data indicate that apoptotic corpse-associated
calcium flashes are indeed required to prime the macrophage
response to tissue damage. Notably, phagocytosis of fluores-
cent beads did not cause an observable increase in GCaMP3
fluorescence (Figures S2D–S2D00), consistent with our observa-
tion that bead uptake is unable to rescue the wound recruit-
ment defect (Figure 3).
Macrophage Priming Requires Elevated JNK Activity
and Draper Expression
The CED-1 homolog Draper, a phagocytic receptor expressed
on macrophages, is required for apoptotic corpse uptake (Man-
aka et al., 2004) but has also been linked to calcium homeostasis
(Cuttell et al., 2008) and macrophage migration to wounds
(Evans et al., 2015). Draper might therefore be a pivotal player
responsible for apoptotic corpse and calcium-flash induced
macrophage priming to tissue damage. Analysis of Draper tran-
script and protein levels suggests that Draper expression in
macrophages is induced following corpse uptake (Figures 5A–
5H). In wild-type macrophages, draper transcript levels dramat-
ically increase during development following phagocytosis of
apoptotic corpses (Figures 5A and 5B; see Figures S3A and
S3B for control sense staining). We also performed a compre-
hensive temporal analysis of Draper protein levels in vivo (Fig-
ures 5C–5E). Naive stage 11 macrophages exhibit low levels of
cytosolic Draper prior to corpse engulfment (Figures 5C and
5C0). Draper expression increases following corpse uptake and
1662
Cell 165, 1658–1671, June 16, 2016
 Draper protein localizes in punctae around the engulfed corpse
in stage 13 macrophages (Figures 5D–5D00). By stage 15, Draper
levels have further increased in mature macrophages and Draper
relocalizes to the macrophage cortex (Figures 5E and 5E0).
To test whether Draper expression is induced downstream of
corpse uptake, we analyzed Draper levels in H99 macrophages
(Figures 5F–5H). We found only minimal levels of Draper tran-
script (Figure 5F) and protein (Figures 5G and 5G0) in H99

 macrophages, similar to that observed in naive wild-type macro-
phages prior to corpse uptake (Figure 5C). However, Draper
levels were strongly increased in H99 macrophages that had
engulfed a UV-induced apoptotic corpse 90 min earlier (Figures
5H and 5H0). To determine whether elevated Draper expression
also requires corpse-associated calcium flashes, we analyzed
Draper levels following inhibition of calcium signaling in macro-
phages expressing Parvalbumin; Draper levels were low in
these macrophages (Figures 5I and 5I0) despite normal corpse
uptake (Figure S2C) and were more similar to that observed in

macrophages.
Despite the lack of drpr expression, H99 macrophages can
efficiently engulf inert beads (Figure 3C) suggesting that Draper
expression is not required for bead phagocytosis. Indeed, we
find that drprD5-null mutant macrophages engulf beads normally
(Figures S3C and S3C0).
These data suggest that the failure of H99 macrophages to
detect wounds might be caused by their lack of corpse-induced
Draper expression. We therefore tested whether ectopic expres-
sion of Draper within H99 macrophages could rescue the inflam-
matory response to tissue damage. Indeed, we found that H99
macrophages with ectopic Draper expression were now robustly
recruited to wounds in a wild-type manner (Figures 5J–5L).

 Macrophage numbers and developmental migration speeds
were unaffected in these embryos (Figures S3D and S3E).
Elevated Draper expression therefore appears sufficient to prime
macrophages for wound detection, bypassing the need for
corpse uptake.

(A–E0) Draper transcript (A and B) and protein (C and E) levels increase upon corpse uptake. Naive stage 11 macrophages have low levels of Draper transcripts
(arrowheads, A) and protein (arrowheads, C and C0) that increase after corpse uptake (D and E); Draper protein relocalizes from corpse-associated punctae
(arrowheads, D and D00) to the cell cortex (arrowheads, E0).
(F–L00) Stage 15 H99 macrophages have low Draper transcript (arrowheads, F) and protein (arrowheads, G and G0) levels but Draper expression is increased
90 min after UV-induced corpse uptake (arrowheads, H and H0). Inhibition of macrophage calcium signaling also disrupts Draper expression (arrowheads, I).
Ectopic Draper expression in H99 macrophages (driven by srp-Gal4) restores macrophage wound recruitment (J–J00 and K) to wild-type levels (L–L00). For (K), data
are represented as mean ± SEM; ns, not significant; **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 via one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. See also

 we first examined JNK signaling activity within wild-type macro-
phages, using the JNK transcriptional reporter TRE-eGFP that
contains Drosophila AP-1 binding sites upstream of the eGFP
gene (Chatterjee and Bohmann, 2012). TRE-eGFP was absent
in naive macrophages prior to corpse engulfment (Figures 6A–
6A00), but expression increased during development as macro-
phages began to clear apoptotic cells (Figures 6B–6B00 and
6C–6C00). To assess whether corpse uptake is required for JNK
activation, we analyzed TRE-eGFP fluorescence in an H99
mutant background (Figures 6D–6F). H99 macrophages lacked
TRE-eGFP reporter activity at all developmental stages (Figures
6D–6F), suggesting JNK signaling is activated downstream of
corpse uptake. We also tested whether corpse-associated cal-
cium flashes are required for JNK activation by analyzing the ac-
tivity of the TRE-eGFP reporter following macrophage-specific
expression of the calcium inhibitor Parvalbumin (Figures 6G
and 6H). Similar to the H99 mutants, inhibition of calcium
signaling completely abrogated TRE-eGFP reporter activity

(A–H00) JNK activity (green, treGFP reporter) is absent from naive macrophages (red, anti-Fascin) at stage 12 (arrowheads; A–A00). JNK activity increases as
macrophages engulf corpses; JNK activity is initially mosaic (B–B00) and detected in some macrophages (arrows) but not others (arrowheads) but later spreads
to all macrophages (arrows, C–C00). JNK activity is not detected in naive H99 macrophages (arrowheads, D–F00) or following inhibition of calcium signaling
(arrowheads, G–H00).
(I–L0) Inhibition of JNK signaling (srp > bskDN) impairs the wound inflammatory response (compare I–I00 with wild-type in J–J00; quantified in K) and disrupts Draper
expression (red; arrowheads, L and L0), but wound recruitment is rescued by ectopic Draper expression (K). Macrophages were labeled using cytoplasmic GFP
(I, J, and L) and nuclear Red-Stinger (I and J). For (K), data are represented as mean ± SEM; ns, not significant; **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 via one-way ANOVA

 within macrophages at all developmental stages examined, sug-
gesting that JNK signaling is activated downstream of macro-
phage calcium flashes.
We next explored whether macrophages required JNK activity
for their inflammatory recruitment to tissue damage. JNK
signaling was selectively inhibited in macrophages by express-
ing a dominant-negative form of Basket (Drosophila JNK) (Ada-
chi-Yamada et al., 1999), and this significantly impaired macro-
phage recruitment to laser-induced wounds (cf. Figures 6I–6I00
to Figures 6J–6J00; quantified in 6K). JNK inhibition did not affect
macrophage numbers, developmental migration speeds, or
corpse uptake (Figures S4A–S4C). Analysis of Draper levels in
these macrophages revealed a strong reduction in Draper
expression (Figures 6L and 6L0), suggesting that corpse-induced
JNK signaling primes the macrophage inflammatory response
by activating Draper expression. Consistent with this, we find
that overexpression of Draper can rescue the wound recruitment
defect caused by macrophage JNK inhibition (Figure 6K).
Given that macrophage priming occurs via JNK signaling and
elevated Draper expression, we tested whether ectopically
increasing JNK activity or Draper levels in wild-type macro-
phages could amplify the wound response. However, neither
constitutive activation of JNK signaling nor Draper overexpres-
sion within wild-type macrophages affected wound recruitment
(data not shown).
Apoptotic Corpse-Associated Calcium Bursts and JNK
Signaling also Prime Macrophages for Bacterial Uptake
Tissue damage in vivo endangers the host to attack by microbial
pathogens, raising the possibility that apoptotic corpse uptake
mightalso prime macrophages to fight infection. Drosophila mac-
rophages efficiently recognize and phagocytose bacteria in vivo
(Tan et al., 2014; Vlisidou et al., 2009). We monitored macrophage
interactions with non-pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in real
time (Figures 7A; Movie S6). Wild-type macrophages of stage
15 embryos efficiently recognized and bound RFP-expressing
E. coli at their surface (Figure 7B) that were rapidly phagocytosed
into the cell body for degradation (arrowheads, Figures 7B0 and
7B00). We confirmed that the bacteria had been successfully en-
gulfed by using pH-sensitive pHrodo-E. coli that only fluoresce
once inside phagosomes (Figures 7C–7C00). Strikingly, the ability
to phagocytose E. coli appeared to correlate with macrophage
maturity and corpse uptake. Naive macrophages from early
(stage 10) embryos, that did not contain any apoptotic corpses,
failed to engulf E. coli (Figure 7D). However, macrophages from
stage 11 embryos that had engulfed apoptotic cells, now also
phagocytosed nearby E. coli (Figure 7E).
This correlation suggests that, just as for wound recruitment,
apoptotic corpse uptake might be a prerequisite for bacterial
phagocytosis. We therefore examined whether naive H99 mac-
rophages are competent to phagocytose E. coli (Figures 7F–
7H). Following bacterial injection into H99 mutants, E. coli
became clustered at the H99 macrophage surface (Figure 7F)
but were not stably bound (E. coli motility indicated by blue track,
Figure 7G) and were never phagocytosed (Figure 7G; Movie S6;
and quantified in Figure 7P). This internalization defect was
confirmed by the absence of fluorescence following injection
of pHrodo-E. coli into H99 embryos (Figure 7H).
Again, this priming effect does not reflect a general require-
ment for phagocytosis per se because H99 macrophages that
had engulfed fluorescent beads could not phagocytose E. coli
(Figure 7I). Importantly, bead uptake itself does not inhibit
E. coli uptake by wild-type macrophages (data not shown).
Just as for the wound priming effect, macrophages are specif-
ically primed for infection by uptake of apoptotic corpses, since
H99 macrophages that had engulfed UV-induced apoptotic
corpses were rescued in their ability to phagocytose E. coli after
90 min (Figure 7J; quantified in Figure 7P). This rescue was cell
autonomous as H99 macrophages within the same embryo,
that had not engulfed a UV-induced corpse, could not engulf
E. coli (Figure 7K).
To examine whether the same molecular machinery is em-
ployed to prime macrophages to detect infection, as demon-
strated for tissue damage, we assessed the role of calcium
signaling, JNK activity, and Draper levels on macrophage uptake
of E. coli (Figures 7L–7O). Inhibition of either intracellular calcium
bursts (using Parvalbumin) or JNK signaling (using dominant-
negative Basket) significantly blocked E. coli recognition and
phagocytosis (Figures 7L and 7M; quantified in Figure 7P).
E. coli failed to adhere to the macrophage surface and instead
moved freely in the extracellular space evading capture by the
macrophages. Ectopic expression of Draper in H99 macro-
phages could rescue the uptake of E. coli (Figure 7N; quantified
in Figure 7P) and pHrodo-E. coli (Figures 7O and 7O0) even in the
absence of apoptotic corpse engulfment.
DISCUSSION
Innate immune cells such as macrophages possess remarkable
phenotypic
plasticity
and
can
become
reprogrammed
in
response to a variety of environmental cytokines and pathogens
to develop a type of immunological memory (Martinez and Gor-
don, 2014; Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Netea et al., 2011). Until
now, research has primarily focused on the role of infection in
triggering the development of innate immune memory, whereby
cells of the innate system become ‘‘primed’’ following primary
infection and confer increased resistance to secondary microbial
attack (Netea et al., 2011; Quintin et al., 2012; Bistoni et al., 1986,
1988; Vecchiarelli et al., 1989). This process has been recently
termed ‘‘trained immunity.’’
However innate cells, particularly macrophages, perform a
diverse range of functions during tissue homeostasis and repair,
including clearance of apoptotic corpses, tissue remodeling
upon wounding, and tumor surveillance (Feng and Martin,
2015; Murray and Wynn, 2011; Noy and Pollard, 2014; Wood
and Jacinto, 2007). Yet, the role of these stimuli in macrophage
priming has yet to be explored. Here, we demonstrate that mac-
rophages also become reprogrammed in response to phagocy-
tosis of apoptotic corpses, which primes the macrophage for a
robust inflammatory response to tissue damage and microbial
infection. Using Drosophila as our genetically tractable model,
we show that naive macrophages, which have not engulfed
apoptotic cells (within H99 mutants that lack programmed cell
death), fail to efficiently detect and migrate to sites of sterile tis-
sue damage in vivo. H99 macrophages also fail to recognize or
phagocytose E. coli from the extracellular space. Both defects

(A–K) Wild-type macrophages (green, srp >GFP) engulf RFP-E. coli (arrowheads, red; A, insets B–B00) or pHrodo-E. coli (red; C–C00). Naive stage 10 macrophages
do not engulf RFP-E. coli (arrowheads, D), but RFP-E. coli is taken up by mature stage 11 macrophages (arrowheads, E). H99 macrophages fail to phagocytose
E. coli (F and G) or pHrodo-E. coli (H); RFP-E. coli cluster at the macrophage surface (arrowhead, F) but are not stably bound or engulfed (blue E. coli track, G).
Bead engulfment (I; arrow, yellow) does not rescue the H99 bacterial uptake defect (I, blue E. coli track; arrowhead, RFP-E. coli), but phagocytosis of UV-induced
apoptotic corpses (asterisks, J) does rescue uptake (arrowhead, J). H99 macrophages that lack corpses in the UV-treated embryo fail to engulf RFP-E. coli
(arrowhead, K; blue, E. coli track).
(L–P) Inhibition of calcium signaling (L; srp >parvalbumin) or JNK activity (M; srp > bskDN) inhibits macrophage (srp > GFP) uptake of RFP-E. coli (arrowheads;
blue E. coli tracks). Ectopic Draper expression in H99 macrophages (driven by srp-Gal4) rescues uptake of RFP-E. coli (arrowheads, N) and pHrodo-E. coli
(arrowheads, O and O0). E. coli uptake is quantified in (P) (data are represented as mean ± SEM; ***p < 0.001 via one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple
comparisons test).

 are specifically rescued by uptake of apoptotic corpses by H99
macrophages but cannot be rescued by phagocytosis per se, as
demonstrated by uptake of inert fluorescent beads.
We have dissected the intracellular signals that act down-
stream of corpse engulfment to elicit these changes in macro-
phage behavior. We show that apoptotic corpse engulfment
rapidly triggers intracellular calcium bursts within the macro-
phage cytosol (see also Cuttell et al., 2008) and that these are
essential for macrophage priming, as genetic abrogation of cal-
cium signaling (using the calcium binding protein Parvalbumin)
impaired the macrophage response to tissue damage and bac-
terial infection.
In recent studies of brain injury, intracellular calcium bursts
activated the JNK signaling pathway in injured astrocytes (Gao
et al., 2013). In our study, JNK activity was strongly associated
with corpse uptake in wild-type macrophages but was absent
from both H99 macrophages (that lacked apoptotic corpses)
and Parvalbumin-expressing macrophages (following inhibition
of calcium signaling). We show genetically that JNK signaling
is required in macrophages for their efficient recruitment to
wounds and also for uptake of extracellular E. coli.
Activation of JNK signaling in Drosophila glial cells enhances
phagocytic activity by inducing expression of the phagocytic re-
ceptor and CED-1 homolog Draper (Macdonald et al., 2013).
Draper, a multi-functional receptor responsible for the phagocy-
tosis of apoptotic cells and invading microbial pathogens (Man-
aka et al., 2004; Cuttell et al., 2008; Hashimoto et al., 2009), has
recently been identified as an important damage receptor con-
trolling macrophage recruitment to sites of tissue damage in vivo
(Evans et al., 2015). We therefore postulated that Draper could
provide a crucial link between corpse-induced JNK activity
and priming for the inflammatory response. We find that levels
of Draper transcripts are increased in wild-type macrophages
following corpse uptake, and this is accompanied by relocaliza-
tion of Draper protein from cytosolic punctae to the cell cortex.
However, Draper levels are low in naive macrophages of H99
mutants and following inhibition of calcium or JNK signaling.
Furthermore, elevated Draper expression can rescue the wound
recruitment and bacterial uptake defect of H99 mutant macro-
phages, bypassing the need for apoptotic corpse uptake.
We thus propose a model whereby naive macrophages, prior
to corpse uptake, are ‘‘anti-inflammatory’’ and insensitive to tis-
sue injury and infection. We suggest that low basal levels of
Draper in naive macrophages are insufficient to allow robust
detection of wound-induced tissue damage or invading bacteria.
Macrophages can be developmentally reprogrammed, however,
by phagocytic uptake of apoptotic corpses, a process that only
requires minimal Draper expression. Apoptotic corpse uptake
triggers rapid intracellular calcium bursts in the macrophage,
which, in turn, promotes JNK activity and increases Draper
expression. Primed macrophages display a pro-inflammatory
phenotype as the elevated Draper levels sensitize the macro-
phage for efficient detection of tissue damage and invading
bacteria.
We suggest that such corpse-induced macrophage priming
confers important protection during host defense in vivo, to
augment the innate immune response at sites of inflammation
and infection where there are high numbers of dying cells. This
is particularly relevant during severe and persistent infections,
where apoptotic cell death is a prominent feature of inflamed
sites. In the absence of such primed responses, failure to clear
the dying apoptotic cells would lead to exacerbated tissue dam-
age as these cells progressed to secondary necrosis. Given that
phagocytic clearance of apoptotic corpses has been linked to
many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Savill et al.,
2002; Taylor et al., 2000), further insight into the cellular and mo-
lecular mechanisms underlying this priming phenomenon is
likely to have important clinical applications.
One of the remaining challenges is to establish the longevity of
macrophage priming—whether priming lasts for the remainder
of an individual’s lifetime and if this memory is transmitted in
the germline. Studies in plants have demonstrated that systemic
acquired resistance (SAR)-induced immune priming is transge-
nerational, as initial infection and induction of SAR in the parental
plants conferred resistance to re-infection in their offspring (Luna
et al., 2012; Slaughter et al., 2012). Emerging evidence from both
plants and animals suggest long-term immune priming or
‘‘training’’ requires large-scale epigenetic reprogramming (Fu
and Dong, 2013; Quintin et al., 2014; Slaughter et al., 2012).
Whether apoptotic corpses induce such long-term changes in
macrophage behavior is an important future challenge.
It is becoming clear that macrophage behavior in vivo is a
complex function of all experiences in its immunological past,
as each successive stimulus imparts new cellular memory. As
we have demonstrated in our study, by changing levels of
PAMP and DAMP receptors on their surface, macrophages are
able to build a memory of a previous event and consequently
adapt and reshape their response to a subsequent assault.
The exact macrophage phenotype might also depend on the
order in which these encounters occurred, as emerging epidemi-
ological evidence suggests vaccine efficacy could be affected
by the order of vaccine administration (Blok et al., 2015). Model
organisms such as Drosophila, with their advanced genetic
tractability and powerful non-invasive live imaging capabilities,
will serve as valuable in vivo models to dissect the fundamental
cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this innate
immune priming.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Drosophila Stocks and Genetics
Fly stocks were maintained according to standard protocols (Greenspan,
1997). All crosses were performed at 25�C unless otherwise stated. For a full
list of genotypes, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures (Table S1).
Drosophila mutants and transgenic lines were obtained from the Bloomington
Stock Centre unless otherwise stated (Table S1).
Microscopy and Wounding
Embryos of the appropriate developmental stage were collected from over-
night apple juice plates, dechorionated in bleach for 1 min and mounted on
double-sided sticky tape on glass slides in 10S Voltalef oil (VWR). Wounds
were induced using a nitrogen-pumped Micropoint ablation laser tuned
to 435 nm (Andor Technologies) (Razzell et al., 2013). Microinjections and
UV-induced apoptosis were performed as before (Tan et al., 2014; Moreira
et al., 2010). For Amplex Red staining, dechorionated embryos were incubated
in a 1:1 mixture of heptane:Amplex Ultrared solution (50 mM in PBS) for 30 min
and mounted as above. Imaging was performed on a PerkinElmer UltraView
spinning disc system or Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. Image

 processing was performed using ImageJ (NIH), Adobe Photoshop, or Adobe
Illustrator software. For a detailed description of image processing and
analysis, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Immunostaining and In Situ Hybridization
Immunostaining was performed using standard techniques with the antibodies
listed (Table S2). An extra amplification step was performed where required
using biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) and streptavi-
din-conjugated flouorphores (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Carefully staged
embryos were oriented and mounted on a glass slide in Vectashield (Vector
Labs), and imaging was performed on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope.
drpr RNA localization was performed by in situ hybridization using Digoxygenin
(DIG)-labeled RNA probes generated by in vitro transcription from cDNA tem-
plates (GH03529, BDGP). Hybridization and staining was performed according
to standard protocols (Nagaso et al., 2001; Tautz and Pfeifle, 1989).
