Background. Recipients of high-dose vs standard-dose influenza vaccines have fewer influenza illnesses. We evaluated the com-
parative effectiveness of high-dose vaccine in preventing postinfluenza deaths during 2012–2013 and 2013–2014, when influenza 
viruses and vaccines were similar.
Methods. We identified Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years who received high-dose or standard-dose vaccines in communi-
ty-located pharmacies offering both vaccines. The primary outcome was death in the 30 days following an inpatient or emergency 
department encounter listing an influenza International of Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code. 
Effectiveness was estimated by using multivariate Poisson regression models; effectiveness was allowed to vary by season.
Results. We studied 1 039 645 recipients of high-dose and 1 683 264 recipients of standard-dose vaccines during 2012–2013, 
and 1 508 176 high-dose and 1 877 327 standard-dose recipients during 2013–2014. Vaccinees were well-balanced for medical con-
ditions and indicators of frail health. Rates of postinfluenza death were 0.028 and 0.038/10 000 person-weeks in high-dose and 
standard-dose recipients, respectively. Comparative effectiveness was 24.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], .6%–42%); there was 
evidence of variation by season (P = .12). In 2012–2013, high-dose was 36.4% (95% CI, 9.0%–56%) more effective in reducing mor-
tality; in 2013–2014, it was 2.5% (95% CI, –47% to 35%).
Conclusions. High-dose vaccine was significantly more effective in preventing postinfluenza deaths in 2012–2013, when 
A(H3N2) circulation was common, but not in 2013–2014.

Much of the impetus to expand influenza immunization pro-
grams has been prompted by a desire to reduce serious com-
plications of influenza infections, including death. It has been 
recognized at least since the 1957 A(H2N2) pandemic that 
older persons and those with some chronic health conditions, 
including pulmonary and cardiac compromise, are at the great-
est risk of severe influenza outcomes [1, 2]. Recent randomized 
trials of influenza vaccines conducted in older populations have 
used more common outcomes as endpoints, typically labora-
tory-confirmed infections [3, 4]. Trials assessing influenza-as-
sociated mortality are unfeasible, given the low likelihood of 
death following influenza infection during seasonal epidemics, 
even among the older persons at greatest risk. In fact, the best 
evidence available from randomized placebo-controlled studies 
of inactivated influenza vaccines among older persons demon-
strated vaccine efficacy of 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
26%–77%) for the prevention of symptomatic clinical illness 
associated with serologic evidence of influenza illness [5].
Several approaches to improving the clinical effectiveness 
of influenza vaccines for older adults are being investigated. In 
December 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
licensed an injectable inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine 
containing more antigen (60 µg vs 15 µg per strain) for use 
among adults aged ≥65 years, hereafter referred to as “high-
dose vaccine” [6]. High-dose vaccine was approved under 
FDA accelerated approval regulations, for which licensure 
was based on studies showing that high-dose vaccine elicited 
higher hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers in adults aged 
≥65 years than standard-dose vaccine for influenza A(H1N1) 
and A(H3N2) viruses, and noninferior titers for B viruses 
[7–9]. A manufacturer-sponsored postlicensure randomized

trial of high-dose vs standard-dose vaccine among approxi-
mately 30 000 subjects aged ≥65 years was conducted during 
2011–2012 and 2012–2013 [3]. It demonstrated that high-dose 
vaccine was more efficacious in preventing laboratory-con-
firmed influenza infections (relative efficacy, 24.2% [95% CI, 
9.7%–36.5%]). Despite its large size, this trial was not pow-
ered to estimate the comparative efficacy of these vaccines 
against more serious influenza illnesses as primary outcomes. 
In an observational study among Medicare beneficiaries aged 
≥65 years who were vaccinated in 2012–2013 with high-dose 
vs standard-dose vaccines in pharmacies [10], we found that 
high-dose vaccine was 22% (95% CI, 15%–29%) more effec-
tive than standard-dose vaccines in preventing influenza-re-
lated office visits. This finding was consistent with the relative 
efficacy of high-dose vaccine in the postlicensure trial, which 
used culture- or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed 
influenza infection as the primary outcome [3]. We also found 
a 22% (95% CI, 16%–27%) reduction in influenza hospitaliza-
tions in the high-dose group [10].
Here we assess the risk of death after a diagnosed influenza 
infection among Medicare beneficiaries who received influenza 
vaccines in 2012–2013 or 2013–2014. Based on results from 
previous randomized and observational studies [3, 10, 11], we 
hypothesized that high-dose vaccine would prevent 20%–30% 
more influenza-associated deaths than standard-dose vaccine.
METHODS
Data Sources
Data were collected from Medicare administrative files (see 
https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/decide-
how-to-get-medicare/whats-medicare/what-is-medicare.
html for a summary). Medicare provides US government–
sponsored health insurance to >40 million US residents 
aged ≥65 years and to approximately 9 million persons aged 
<65 years who are disabled or have end-stage renal disease. 
We linked enrollment data for beneficiaries receiving fee-
for-service care with claims from inpatient (Medicare Part 
A) and outpatient care (Part B) settings, as well as claims for 
prescription drugs dispensed in outpatient settings (Part D). 
Pharmacy data were drawn from the Provider Enrollment, 
Chain, and Ownership System, the National Plan and 
Provider Enumeration System, and the National Council 
for Prescription Drug Programs databases. The proportion 
of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza viruses 
among samples submitted to laboratories collaborating with 
the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance 
System (NREVSS) was used to monitor the intensity of influ-
enza activity during the study period [12].
Participants
The base population was drawn from Medicare beneficiaries aged 
≥65 years enrolled in fee-for-service care through Medicare parts 
A and B. Enrollment on the date of vaccination and for at least 
6 months prior to vaccination was required, so that data were 
available to detect comorbid medical conditions. Beneficiaries 
with Part C coverage (managed care plan enrollment) were 
excluded because regulations regarding coverage for medica-
tions and vaccines are more homogenous among those receiving 
fee-for-service care. Beneficiaries who first enrolled in Medicare 
for any reason other than reaching 65, specifically being disabled 
or having end-stage renal disease, were excluded. We selected 
beneficiaries who received inactivated influenza vaccines from 
5 August 2012 through 31 January 2013 for the 2012–2013 sea-
son, and from 4 August 2013 through 31 January 2014 for the 
2013–2014 season. Dates were formatted to reflect the reporting 
of NREVSS influenza virus data—weekly, from Sunday through 
Saturday. Beneficiaries recorded as receiving both high-dose 
and standard-dose vaccines between 1 August and 31 May of 
the following year were excluded. From this group of beneficia-
ries, we obtained the study population. They were beneficiaries 
who received an influenza vaccination at a community-located 
pharmacy. This restriction was applied to identify beneficiaries 
who met a minimum standard of physical and mental health, 
demonstrated by an ability to visit a pharmacy and request an 
influenza vaccination [10]. To help adjust for temporal and geo-
graphical factors that influenced the availability of or access to 
high-dose vaccine, the study population was further restricted 
to those beneficiaries who received a standard- or high-dose 
vaccine at a community-located pharmacy that vaccinated at 
least 1 Medicare beneficiary with the alternative influenza vac-
cine in the 14 days preceding or following each vaccination date. 
Figure 1 summarizes the cohort selection process.
Influenza Vaccine Exposure
Participants were defined as exposed to high-dose or stan-
dard-dose vaccines by using Healthcare Common Procedure 
Coding System (HCPCS) and Current Procedural Terminology 
(CPT) codes for high-dose vaccine (CPT 90662 code) or stan-
dard-dose vaccine (CPT codes 90655–90661 or 90724; HCPCS 
codes G0008, Q2035–Q2038). The 2012–2013 influenza vac-
cines dispensed in the northern hemisphere contained anti-
gens representing the following viruses: an A/California/7/2009 
(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-
like virus, and a B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus [13]. For the 
2013–2014 season, trivalent vaccines contained the following 
antigens: an A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, 
an A(H3N2) virus antigenically like the cell-propagated pro-
totype virus A/Victoria/361/2011(A/Texas/50/2012), and a B/
Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus [14]. B/Wisconsin/1/2010 and 
B/Massachusetts/2/2012 are both B/Yamagata lineage viruses, 
and thus serologic cross-reactivity was expected with these 2 
antigens. The vaccine components used in the 2012–2013 and 
2013–2014 influenza vaccines were similar, suggesting that 
pooled estimates of vaccine effects might be possible.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was postinfluenza death, defined as a 
death occurring in the 30 days following a Medicare claim for 
an inpatient hospitalization or an emergency department visit 
with a diagnosis of influenza, identified using the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) codes 487.xx and 488.xx. To permit comparison of 
our findings with those from previous randomized and obser-
vational studies [3, 10, 11], we included 2 secondary outcomes: 
(1) hospitalizations and emergency department visits listing an 
ICD-9-CM code for influenza; and (2) likely influenza-related 
office visits, defined by a visit with claims for a rapid influenza 
diagnostic test (CPT code 87804) and for dispensing of a treat-
ment regimen of oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) 
within 2 days of the test. The latter outcome was examined in a 
cohort restricted to participants who were enrolled in Medicare 
Part D on the day of influenza vaccination, so that we could 
identify prescriptions for a therapeutic course of oseltamivir.
Person-time Under Observation
Follow-up time began 14 days after the date of the vaccination, 
to permit the development of vaccine-specific immunity [15], 
and continued until the first of the following events: disen-
rollment from Medicare Part A or B; the outcome of interest; 
or death. For the influenza-related illness outcome, beneficia-
ries were also censored if they disenrolled from Medicare Part 
D. Using numbers of postinfluenza deaths in the entire cohort, 
we estimated we had adequate power to detect a 30% reduc-
tion in postinfluenza deaths in the high-dose vaccine group 
(Supplementary Table 1).
Variables of Interest
Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, and ethnicity), 
and region of residence as characterized by the Department of 
Health and Human Services (DHHS) were collected for each 
participant. During the 6-month period prior to receipt of an 
influenza vaccine, we categorized preexisting medical con-
ditions with the Hierarchical Condition Categories used for 
Medicare risk adjustment [16]. Participants were identified in 
the following categories: asthma, blood disorders, chronic lung 
disease, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disorders, liver disor-
ders, neurological conditions, and immune system dysfunction. 
Several indicators of frail physical health were also collected for 
each participant (see Supplementary Materials).
Data Analyses
To determine whether the 2 cohorts were similar, differences 
in baseline covariates were evaluated using standardized mean 
differences, calculated as the difference in means or propor-
tions of a variable divided by its pooled standard deviation. 
Standardized mean differences are not influenced by population 
size, and may provide a more meaningful measure of differences 
in large cohorts than standard hypothesis tests. A standardized 
mean difference of ≥0.1 between groups was considered mean-
ingful [17].
Each calendar week during the study period in each DHHS 
region was classified into low, medium, or high influenza peri-
ods, based on detections of influenza viruses during that week

and in that region. High, medium, and low periods of influ-
enza activity were defined as weeks when the proportion of 
respiratory samples that tested positive for influenza was the 
≥75th, 55th–75th, or <55th percentile for each region/season, 
respectively [10].
Rates of each study outcome were calculated as the number 
of events during influenza periods divided by person-time mea-
sured in weeks. To improve specificity, our analyses focused on 
events occurring during high influenza periods. Three Poisson 
regression models were used. In the first, comparative vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) was estimated during high influenza periods 
with a covariate for season (2012–2013 or 2013–2014). A sec-
ond model included all covariates listed in Table 1, to adjust for 
potential residual confounding after restricting participation to 
beneficiaries who were vaccinated in pharmacies. In the first 2 
models, we pooled outcomes from 2012–2013 and 2013–2014. 
A third added a vaccine-season interaction term to the second, 
to evaluate whether effectiveness varied substantially by sea-
son. A log-likelihood ratio test was used to assess whether the 
interaction term statistically improved model fit; a P value of 
<.1 was considered significant. VE was estimated as [(1 – rate 
high-dose recipients/rate standard-dose recipients) × 100] and 
95% CIs were estimated. Analyses were conducted using R 
3.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) 
and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). 
All analyses were performed with de-identified data collected 
for administrative purposes by the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, and thus informed consent was not required 
by the US DHHS.
RESULTS
During the study period, >33 million Medicare beneficiaries 
aged ≥65 years received influenza vaccinations (Figure 1). In 
2012–2013, 17% of vaccinees received the high-dose vaccine 
(2.8 million beneficiaries), while 24% received the high-dose 
vaccine in 2013–2014 (3.9 million beneficiaries). We studied 
5 797 090 persons who received high-dose or standard-dose 
vaccines at 29 669 community-located pharmacies during the 2 
seasons. During 2012–2013, 1 039 645 of 2 722 909 (38.2%) sub-
jects meeting entry criteria received high-dose vaccine; during 
2013–2014, 1 508 176 of 3 385 503 (44.5%) received high-dose 
vaccine. For the influenza-related illness outcome, requiring 
outpatient prescription-drug coverage reduced the number of 
subjects to 1 530 966 and 2 273 211 in the 2012–2013 and 2013–
2014 seasons, respectively.
Subjects receiving high-dose or standard-dose vaccine were 
similar with respect to baseline covariates, including health 
conditions, low-income status, and indicators of frail health. 
Low and virtually identical proportions of high-dose and stan-
dard-dose recipients used home oxygen, wheelchairs or walk-
ers, or had claims for falls, fractures, or dementia (Table 1), 
suggesting that substantial confounding of vaccine exposure 
by health status was unlikely. There were differences by region 
of residence among high-dose and standard-dose vaccinees 
(Table 1).When we restricted the population further to those 
who received prescription drug coverage, the findings were very 
similar (Supplementary Table 2). The characteristics of benefi-
ciaries who received standard- or high-dose vaccine in the first 
and the second study seasons did not differ (Supplementary 
Table 3).
Rates of postinfluenza death, hospitalized influenza, and 
influenza-related visits were plotted by vaccine type and by low, 
medium, and high influenza period in Figure 2. Rates for each 
outcome were higher during the first season, when A(H3N2) 
viruses predominated in the United States. The likelihood of 
postinfluenza death was 57% lower during 2013–2014, when 
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated.
During both seasons, 83 postinfluenza deaths occurred in 
the high-dose group during 30 079 255 person-weeks of obser-
vation (rate, 0.028/10 000 person-weeks), and 162 deaths in the 
standard-dose group during 42 696 182 person-weeks (rate, 
0.038/10 000 person-weeks), representing a risk difference of 
–0.01/10 000 person-weeks (95% CI, –.019 to –.002), and an 
incidence rate ratio of 0.73 (95% CI, .59–.95). When examined 
by season of occurrence, differences in the rate of each outcome 
by vaccine type were greater in 2012–2013 (Figure 2).
Estimates of comparative effectiveness for influenza-related 
illness, hospital-diagnosed influenza, and postinfluenza death 
were similar in models that adjusted only for season and those 
that included covariates for potential confounders (Table 2). 
However, comparative effectiveness varied significantly by 
season for influenza-related illness (P value for season-vac-
cine interaction = .006) and for hospital-diagnosed influenza 
(P = .041); for postinfluenza death, the P value was .12. Given 
the consistently higher estimates of comparative effectiveness 
during the first season of the study, we presented season-spe-
cific estimates for each outcome (Table 2). During 2012–2013, 
comparative VE for the primary outcome of postinfluenza 
death was 36.4% (95% CI, 9%–56%), while during the following 
season it was minimal and not significant (2.5% [95% CI, –47% 
to 35%]).
DISCUSSION
In our study population, we found a significant reduction of 
approximately 35% in postinfluenza deaths associated with receipt 
 
of high-dose vs standard-dose vaccines in 2012–2013, but not in 
2013–2014. The 2012–2013 reduction was accompanied by sig-
nificant decreases of approximately 20% in influenza-related vis-
its and hospital-based influenza diagnoses. The latter 2 findings 
are consistent with the results from our previous study (which 
used slightly different eligibility criteria and only 2012–2013 
data) [10], and those from analyses of a manufacturer-sponsored

 Comparative Effectiveness of High-Dose Vaccine in Preventing Influenza Deaths • JID 2017:215 (15 February) • 515
trial [3, 11]. The internal and external consistency of our find-
ings suggests that the use of high-dose vaccine in Medicare 
beneficiaries during 2012–2013 prevented additional influen-
za-related deaths. Despite 31 million person-weeks of follow-up 
time during 2012–2013, the magnitude of this reduction in 
mortality was not precisely estimated (95% CI, 9%–56%). As the 
outcomes of greatest interest when considering alternative vac-
cination strategies are often rare (eg, influenza-related mortality 
or serious vaccine adverse events), large postlicensure observa-
tional studies are vital in understanding the comparative effects 
of new vaccine formulations—randomized trials are unable to 
answer all relevant policy questions. Multiple seasons of obser-
vational data analyzed with appropriate longitudinal methods 
will be critical to providing valid information to those consider-
ing alternative influenza vaccine recommendations.
Persons aged 65 years and older experience the highest rates of 
many serious complications of influenza—including prolonged 
hospitalization, the need for intensive care, and death—during 
most interpandemic influenza seasons [18–21]. During seasonal 
epidemics in which influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominate, rates

 516 • JID 2017:215 (15 February) • Shay et al
of serious complications are higher, often by a factor of 2 to 3 [21, 
22]. Influenza A(H3N2) virus circulation was common during the 
2012–2013 influenza season [14], leading to higher rates of influen-
za-associated outcomes; thus, we had improved power during the 
first season to detect a difference in our rarest outcome, postinflu-
enza mortality. During the 2013–2014 influenza season, receipt of 
high-dose vaccine was associated with a significant reduction only 
in the rate of hospitalized influenza. This reduction was smaller 
in magnitude than that found in the 2012–2013 season. There are 
several plausible reasons that the comparative effectiveness of high-
dose vaccine was reduced or absent during 2013–2014, including 
differences in the individuals who received high-dose vaccine by 
season, differences in the circulation patterns of specific influenza 
viruses by season, and differences in the antigenic relatedness of 
vaccine and wild-type viruses by season.
Although more high-dose vaccine was used in 2013–2014, 
both in terms of total vaccinations administered and in the pro-
portion of participants who received it, we found no evidence 
that the characteristics of high-dose recipients differed by sea-
son. On the other hand, A(H3N2) viruses predominated in 
2012–2013 [14], and 90% of influenza A detections in 2013–2014 
were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses [23]. Data from the randomized 
trial suggested that relative efficacy of high-dose vaccine might 
be greater for A(H3N2) than for A(H1N1) viruses, but this dif-
ference was not statistically significant (23.3% [95% CI, 6.0%–
37.5%] and 11.1% [95% CI, –160% to 70.2%], respectively) [3]. 
Therefore, it is uncertain if our findings might reflect a difference 
in comparative effectiveness by A subtype. Influenza B viruses 
circulated in both seasons, representing 20%–30% of influenza 
detections [14, 23], so differences in B virus activity are unlikely 
to explain our findings. There was no evidence of antigenic drift 
in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during the 2 study seasons: 99% of 
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterized were antigenically simi-
lar to A/CA/7/2009-like viruses [14, 23]. The great majority of 
A(H3N2) viruses characterized in 2012–2013 were antigeni-
cally similar to cell culture–propagated A/Victoria/361/2011 
viruses [24]. A change in the A(H3N2) vaccine strain from A/
Victoria/361 in 2012–2013 to A/Texas/50 in 2013–2014 was 
recommended because ferret antisera made with egg-propa-
gated A/Victoria/361 did not recognize more recent cell cul-
ture–propagated A(H3N2) viruses well. Ferret antisera made 
with egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012 (which was genetically 
closely related to A/Victoria/361) better recognized the viruses 
that were tested [24]. Low effectiveness of the 2012–2013 vac-
cine against reverse transcription PCR–confirmed A(H3N2) 
virus infections was found [25]. Low effectiveness was based 
mainly on mutations associated with adaptation to growth in 
eggs, and not on mutations associated with antigenic drift [25]. 
Without samples of postvaccination sera and of the infecting 
influenza viruses from participants, we cannot conclude that 
2012–2013 high-dose vaccine led to a broader or improved 
immune response than did standard-dose vaccine, although we 
can expect that its administration did lead to higher HAI titers 
to that season’s wild-type H3N2 viruses on a population level, 
based on published immunogenicity data [3, 26, 27].
During 2012–2013, estimates of influenza VE were 39% (95% 
CI, 29%–47%) for medically attended A(H3N2) infections 
among US subjects of all ages; estimates were lower and non-
significant among those aged ≥65 years (11% [95% CI, –41% 
to 43%]) [28]. Given the greater relative severity of A(H3N2) 
seasons in older adults, this low effectiveness estimate (which 
should be interpreted in light of its broad CI) highlights the 
need to improve VE for recent A(H3N2) strains, especially 
among those aged ≥65. We lacked data on infecting viruses, 
and cannot make subtype-specific VE estimates. However, how 
comparative VE varies during seasons dominated by different 
influenza types/subtypes deserves further investigation as new 
vaccines are introduced.
This study has limitations. The lack of laboratory results in 
Medicare data means that none of our outcomes represented 
laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. As our comparative 
effectiveness results for influenza-related visits (defined by a 
claim for a rapid influenza test followed by receipt of oseltami-
vir) were concordant with those from a randomized trial that 
used laboratory-confirmed influenza illness as a primary out-
come [3], we may have identified a valid proxy for a medically 
attended influenza infection in the Medicare population. Our 
2 more serious outcomes were defined only by influenza diag-
noses made in a hospital setting. Some data suggest that use of 
influenza diagnostic tests by clinicians has increased since the 
2009 pandemic; thus, the diagnosis of serious influenza infec-
tions may have improved recently [29, 30]. As in all observa-
tional research, it is possible that our findings were biased with 
residual confounding. In vaccine studies focusing on older 
adults, residual confounding associated with chronic condi-
tions which are not well characterized by a simple dichotomous 
indicator—for example, a clinical history of chronic heart fail-
ure—can be especially problematic [31, 32]. The consistency of 
our findings with those of the randomized trial of high-dose 
vaccine suggests that we have successfully addressed this issue 
through restriction of the study population to those vacci-
nated in community pharmacies. It is possible that knowledge 
by a care provider of the influenza vaccine type a participant 
received affected decisions to test for or to diagnose influenza. 
However, the lack of published clinical results for high-dose 
vaccine during the study period and the lack of recommenda-
tions to favor high-dose over standard-dose influenza vaccines 
make such a bias unlikely. A final limitation is that restricting 
participation to those Medicare beneficiaries vaccinated in 
pharmacies may decrease the generalizability of our findings. 
On the other hand, it is essential that comparative effectiveness 
studies address the possibility of confounding by indication, 
and the use of restriction to minimize this bias in large observa-
tional studies has been advocated [33, 34].

 Comparative Effectiveness of High-Dose Vaccine in Preventing Influenza Deaths • JID 2017:215 (15 February) • 517
Our findings suggest that high-dose influenza vaccines and 
perhaps other vaccines designed to elicit higher HAI immune 
responses among older adults may yield the most benefits 
during seasons when influenza A(H3N2) viruses are wide-
spread. A recent meta-analysis estimated that the effective-
ness of standard-dose inactivated vaccines among adults aged 
>60 years for laboratory-confirmed A(H3N2) infection was 
only 24% [35]. The authors concluded that influenza vaccines 
offering better protection against A(H3N2) infection are criti-
cally needed. The availability of A(H3N2) vaccines offering sub-
stantially better protection for older adults and their widespread 
use in this population could lead to meaningful reductions in 
influenza-associated morbidity and mortality.
