 Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain
The Brainstorm Consortium
Abstract
Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share 
symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 
brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control 
participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. 
Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more 
distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing 
between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we 
conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and 
phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of 
common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based 
methods in understanding their etiology.
Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Brain disorders may exhibit shared symptoms and substantial epidemio-
logical comorbidity, inciting debate about their etiologic overlap. However, detailed study of 
phenotypes with different ages of onset, severity, and presentation poses a considerable challenge. 
Recently developed heritability methods allow us to accurately measure correlation of genome-
wide common variant risk between two phenotypes from pools of different individuals and assess 
how connected they, or at least their genetic risks, are on the genomic level. We used genome-wide 
association data for 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants, as well as 17 phenotypes 
from a total of 1,191,588 individuals, to quantify the degree of overlap for genetic risk factors of 
25 common brain disorders.

 phenomena such as behavioral change, loss of motor function, or alterations of consciousness. 
Directly observable phenomena (such as the presence of emboli, protein tangles, or unusual 
electrical activity patterns) generally define and separate neurological disorders from psychiatric 
disorders. Understanding the genetic underpinnings and categorical distinctions for brain disorders 
and related phenotypes may inform the search for their biological mechanisms.
RESULTS: Common variant risk for psychiatric disorders was shown to correlate significantly, 
especially among attention deficit hyper-activity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, major 
depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia. By contrast, neurological disorders appear more 
distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders, except for migraine, which was 
significantly correlated to ADHD, MDD, and Tourette syndrome. We demonstrate that, in the 
general population, the personality trait neuroticism is significantly correlated with almost every 
psychiatric disorder and migraine. We also identify significant genetic sharing between disorders 
and early life cognitive measures (e.g., years of education and college attainment) in the general 
population, demonstrating positive correlation with several psychiatric disorders (e.g., anorexia 
nervosa and bipolar disorder) and negative correlation with several neurological phenotypes (e.g., 
Alzheimer’s disease and ischemic stroke), even though the latter are considered to result from 
specific processes that occur later in life. Extensive simulations were also performed to inform 
how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity influence genetic 
correlations.
CONCLUSION: The high degree of genetic correlation among many of the psychiatric disorders 
adds further evidence that their current clinical boundaries do not reflect distinct underlying 
pathogenic processes, at least on the genetic level. This suggests a deeply intercon nected nature 
for psychiatric disorders, in contrast to neurological disorders, and underscores the need to refine 
psychiatric diagnostics. Genetically informed analyses may provide important “scaffolding” to 
support such restructuring of psychiatric nosology, which likely requires incorporating many levels 
of information. By contrast, we find limited evidence for widespread common genetic risk sharing 
among neurological disorders or across neurological and psychiatric disorders. We show that both 
psychiatric and neurological disorders have robust correlations with cognitive and personality 
measures. Further study is needed to evaluate whether overlapping genetic contributions to 
psychiatric pathology may influence treatment choices. Ultimately, such developments may pave 
the way toward reduced heterogeneity and improved diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric 
disorders.
Subsection of genetic risk correlations among brain disorders and quantitative phenotypes. 
Heritability analysis of brain disorders points to pervasive sharing of genetic risk among 
psychiatric disorders. These correlations are largely absent among neurological disorders but are 
present for both groups in relation to neurocognitive quantitative phenotypes. Only significant

 The classification of brain disorders has evolved over the past century, reflecting the medical 
and scientific communities’ assessments of the presumed root causes of clinical phenomena 
such as behavioral change, loss of motor function, spontaneous movements, or alterations of 
consciousness. Directly observable phenomena (such as the presence of emboli, protein 
tangles, or unusual electrical activity patterns) generally define and separate neurological 
disorders from psychiatric disorders (1). Understanding the genetic underpinnings and 
categorical distinctions between brain disorders may be helpful in informing the search for 
the biological pathways underlying their patho-physiology (2, 3).
Studies of twins and families have indicated that, in general, brain disorders (excepting those 
caused by trauma, infection, or cancer) show substantial heritability (4). Epidemiological 
and twin studies have explored patterns of phenotypic overlaps (5–7), and comorbidity has 
been reported for many pairs of disorders, including bipolar disorder and migraine (8), 
stroke and major depressive disorder (MDD) (9), epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), and epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (10, 11). 
Furthermore, direct etiological links may also exist—e.g., mutations in the same ion channel 
genes confer pleiotropic risk for multiple distinct brain phenotypes (12–14). Genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) have demonstrated that individual common risk variants can 
overlap across traditional diagnostic boundaries (15, 16) and that disorders such as 
schizophrenia, MDD, and bipolar disorder can have genetic correlations (17).
GWASs have also demonstrated that common genetic variation contributes to the heritability 
of brain disorders. Generally, this occurs via the combination of many common variants—
examples include Alzheimer’s disease (18), bipolar disorder (19), migraine (20), Parkinson’s 
disease (21), and schizophrenia (22)—each with a small individual effect. In addition to 
locus discovery, the degree of distinctiveness (23) across neurological and psychiatric 
phenotypes can be evaluated with the introduction of novel heritability-based methods (24) 
and sufficiently large sample sizes for robust heritability analysis. These analyses can shed 
light on the nature of these diagnostic boundaries and explore the extent of shared common 
variant genetic influences.
Study design
The Brainstorm Consortium, a collaboration among GWAS meta-analysis consortia for 25 
disorders (Table 1), was assembled to perform a comprehensive heritability and correlation 
analysis of brain disorders. We included meta-analyses of any common brain disorders for 
which we could identify a GWAS meta-analysis consortium of sufficient size for heritability 
analysis. The total study sample consists of 265,218 cases of different brain disorders and 
784,643 controls (Table 1) and includes at least one representative of most ICD-10 (10th 
revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems) blocks covering mental and behavioral disorders and diseases of the central 
nervous system (CNS). Also included are 1,191,588 samples for 13 behavioral-cognitive 
phenotypes (n = 744,486 individuals) traditionally viewed as brain-related, as well as 4 
additional phenotypes (n = 447,102 individuals) selected to represent known, well-
delineated etiological processes {immune disorders (Crohn’s disease), vascular disease

 (coronary artery disease), and anthropomorphic measures [height and body mass index 
(BMI)]} (Table 2).
GWAS summary statistics for the 42 disorders and phenotypes were centralized and 
underwent uniform quality control and processing (25). To avoid potential bias arising from 
ancestry differences, we used European-only meta-analyses for each disorder and generated 
new meta-analyses for those datasets where the original sample sets had diverse ancestries. 
Clinically relevant subtypes from three disorders (epilepsy, migraine, and ischemic stroke) 
were also included; in these cases, the subtype data-sets are parts of the top-level dataset 
(Table 1).
We have developed a heritability estimation method, linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) 
regression (24), which was used to calculate heritability estimates and correlations, as well 
as to estimate their statistical significance from block jackknife–based standard errors. More 
formally, we estimate the common variant heritability (h2g) of each disorder, defined as the 
proportion of phenotypic variance in the population that could theoretically be explained by 
an optimal linear predictor formed using the additive effects of all common (minor allele 
frequency >5%) autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The genetic 
correlation for a pair of phenotypes is then defined as the correlation between their optimal 
genetic predictors. Heritability for binary disorders and phenotypes was transformed to the 
liability scale. We further performed a weighted least-squares regression analysis to evaluate 
whether differences relating to study makeup (such as sample size) were correlated with the 
magnitude of the correlation estimates. Finally, we performed a heritability partitioning 
analysis (25) by means of stratified LD score regression to examine whether the observed 
heritability for the disorders or pheno-types was enriched into any of the tissue-specific 
regulatory regions or functional category partitions of the genome, using 10 top-level tissue-
type and 53 functional partitions from Finucane et al. (26). Simulated phenotype data was 
then generated under different scenarios by permuting 120,267 genotyped individuals from 
the UK Biobank (25) to evaluate statistical power and aid in interpreting the results (25).
Heritability estimates and their error sources
We observed a similar range of heritability estimates among the disorders and the 
behavioral-cognitive phenotypes (fig. S1, A and B, and table S1 and S2), roughly in line 
with previously reported estimates from smaller datasets (table S3). Three ischemic stroke 
subtypes (cardioembolic, large-vessel disease, and small-vessel disease) as well as the 
“agreeableness” personality measure from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (27) had 
insufficient evidence of additive heritability for robust analysis and thus were excluded from 
further examination (25). The only observed correlation between heritability estimates and 
factors relating to study makeup (table S4 and fig. S1, C to F) was a modest correlation 
between age of disorder onset and heritability, suggesting that early onset brain disorders 
tend to be more heritable. Because some of our interpretation of the results depends on lack 
of observed correlation, we explored the behavior of observed correlation versus power (fig. 
S2A), standard errors (fig. S2B), and the individual results (fig. S2, C and D) to identify 
where we can be reasonably robust in claiming lack of correlation.

 The common variant heritability estimates for the psychiatric and neurological disorders 
were generally somewhat lower than previously reported estimates from common variants 
(table S5). When comparing estimates reported here with those previously reported in 
studies with smaller sample sizes (28), a similar pattern was observed for the behavioral-
cognitive traits, with the exception of “openness,” “neuroticism,” and “never/ever smoked” 
(defined as those who have never smoked versus those who have smoked at some point) 
suggesting that some attenuation in heritability is observed when moving to larger sample 
sizes. Measures related to cognitive ability, such as childhood cognitive performance 
[heritability estimate of 0.19 (SE: 0.03)] and years of education [heritability estimate of 0.30 
(SE: 0.01)], yielded estimates that were more consistent with previous estimates of the herita 
bility of intelligence (29, 30), suggesting that the cognitive measures may be less prone to 
phenotypic measurement error and/or have a higher heritability overall than the personality 
measures.
These heritability estimates should be interpreted somewhat cautiously, as they reflect the 
phenotype ascertained in each study and will be deflated in the presence of diagnostic 
heterogeneity, ascertainment errors, or unusual contributions of high-impact rare variants. To 
evaluate potential sources of these differences, we explored three approaches (25): 
evaluating the differences in real data, simulation work (table S5), and quantifying the 
magnitude of effect for potentially implied misclassification (table S6).
In comparison with heritability estimates obtained using twin and family data, the more 
diverse selection and survival biases in the underlying data may attenuate the heritability 
estimates and correlations, as may increased within-disorder heterogeneity introduced by the 
larger meta-analyses. A related explanation for the lower estimates of heritability may be 
that increasing sample sizes have led to expanded inclusion criteria, meaning that less 
severely affected cases with a lower overall burden of risk factors (both genetic and 
environmental) might be included, which in turn would attenuate estimates of heritability. 
However, the successful identification of genome-wide significant loci suggests that these 
larger samples are nevertheless very useful for genetic studies, and the simulation results 
suggest that this has, at most, a limited effect on estimated genetic correlations (fig. S9). 
Even so, some of the pairs of phenotypes included here lack sufficient power for robust 
estimation of genetic correlations. Moreover, our analyses examine only the properties of 
common variant contributions; extending these analyses to include the effects of rare 
variants may further inform the extent of genetic overlap. For example, epilepsy and ASD 
show substantial overlap in genetic risk from de novo loss-of-function mutations (31), in 
contrast to the limited common variant sharing observed in this study. This may suggest that 
the rare and common variant contributions to genetic overlap may behave differently and 
that incorporating the two variant classes into a single analysis may provide further insight 
into brain disorder pathogenesis.
To address the possibility of methodological differences contributing to the differences in the 
estimates, and although LDSC and GREML have previously been shown to yield similar 
estimates from the same data (24), we performed our own comparison in Alzheimer’s 
disease data (32) (selected on the basis of data availability). In Alzheimer’s disease, the 
previously published heritability estimate [0.24 (SE: 0.03)] is significantly different from the 
Page 5

 estimate in the current study [0.13 (SE: 0.02)]. These differences may reflect implicit 
heterogeneity in a much larger case collection used in the current study (effective sample 
size 10,494 versus 46,669) and the potential reasons listed above, but they could also be due 
to methodological variability (most of the previous approximations listed in table S3 are 
estimated with a different methodology). To evaluate this, we applied the same analytical 
process used in this paper to the summary statistics of the GERAD (Genetic and 
Environmental Risk in Alzheimer’s Disease) cohort (3941 cases and 7848 controls) from the 
Alzheimer’s disease meta-analysis, where the previous heritability estimate was calculated. 
There, we obtained a heritability estimate of 0.25 (SE: 0.04), which agrees closely with the 
published estimate of 0.24 (SE: 0.03), suggesting that the different approximations may 
reflect differences between datasets rather than methodological variability.
Correlations among brain disorders
We observed widespread sharing across psychiatric disorders (Fig. 1 and fig. S3) by 
expanding the number of brain disorder pairs studied beyond those previously reported (17), 
but similar sharing was not observed among neurological disorders. Among the psychiatric 
disorders, schizophrenia showed significant genetic correlation with most of the psychiatric 
disorders, whereas MDD was positively (though not necessarily significantly) correlated 
with every other disorder tested. Further, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, 
MDD, and ADHD each showed a high degree of correlation to the four others [average 
genetic correlation (rg) = 0.40] (table S7A). Anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia also demonstrated significant sharing among themselves 
(Fig. 1), as did Tourette syndrome (TS), OCD, and MDD, as well as ASD and 
schizophrenia. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed no significant correlation with 
any of the other psychiatric phenotypes (though some correlation to ADHD and MDD was 
observed), and both ASD and TS appear to potentially be more distinct from the other 
psychiatric disorders. The modest power of the ASD, PTSD, and TS meta-analyses, 
however, limits the strength of this conclusion (fig. S2C).
Neurological disorders showed a more limited extent of genetic correlation than that of the 
psychiatric disorders (Fig. 2, fig. S4, and table S7A), suggesting greater diagnostic 
specificity and/or more distinct etiologies. Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, 
generalized epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis (MS) showed little to no correlation with other 
brain disorders. The highest degree of genetic correlation among the neurological disorders 
was observed for focal epilepsy (average rg = 0.46, excluding the other epilepsy datasets), 
though none of the correlations were significant, reflecting the relatively modest power of 
the current focal epilepsy meta-analysis (fig. S2C). However, the modest heritability and the 
broad pattern of sharing observed for focal epilepsy may be consistent with heterogeneity 
and potentially even diagnostic misclassification across a range of neurological conditions.
In the cross-category correlation analysis, the observed pattern is consistent with limited 
sharing across the included neurological and psychiatric disorders (Fig. 3; average rg = 
0.03). The only significant cross-category correlations were with migraine, suggesting that 
this disorder may share some of its genetic architecture with psychiatric disorders: migraine 
and ADHD (rg = 0.26, P = 8.81 × 10−8), migraine and TS (rg = 0.19, P = 1.80 × 10−5), and

 migraine and MDD (rg = 0.32, P = 1.42 × 10−22 for all migraine; rg = 0.23, P = 5.23 × 10−5 
for migraine without aura; rg = 0.28, P = 1.00 × 10−4 for migraine with aura).
We observed several significant genetic correlations between the behavioral-cognitive or 
additional phenotypes and brain disorders (Fig. 4 and table S7B). Results for cognitive traits 
were dichotomous among psychiatric phenotypes (fig. S5A), with ADHD, anxiety disorders, 
MDD, and TS showing negative correlations to the cognitive measures and anorexia 
nervosa, ASD, bipolar disorder, and OCD showing positive correlations. Schizophrenia 
showed more mixed results, with a significantly negative correlation to intelligence but a 
positive correlation to years of education. Among neurological phenotypes (fig. S5B), the 
correlations were either negative or null, with Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke, early onset stroke, and migraine showing significantly 
negative correlations. Correlations between college attainment and years of education with 
bipolar disorder (24), Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia have been previously reported 
(33).
Among the personality and symptom measures, significant positive correlations were 
observed between neuroticism and anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorders, migraine, migraine 
without aura, MDD, OCD, schizophrenia, and TS [fig. S6, A and B; replicating previously 
reported correlations with MDD and schizophrenia (34)]; between depressive symptoms and 
ADHD, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, MDD, and schizophrenia; and between subjective 
well-being and anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and MDD. For smoking-related measures, 
the only significant genetic correlations were between never/ever smoked and MDD (rg = 
0.33, P = 3.10 × 10−11) as well as ADHD (rg = 0.37, P = 3.15 × 10−6).
Among the additional phenotypes, the two examples of disorders with well-defined 
etiologies had different results. Crohn’s disease, representing immunological 
pathophysiology, showed no correlation with any of the study phenotypes, whereas the 
phenotype representing vascular pathophysiology (coronary artery disease) showed 
significant correlation to MDD (rg = 0.19, P = 8.71 × 10−5) as well as the two stroke-related 
phenotypes (rg = 0.69, P = 2.47 × 10−6 g to ischemic stroke and rg = 0.86, P = 2.26 × 10−5 to 
early onset stroke), suggesting shared genetic effects across these phenotypes. Significant 
correlations were also observed for BMI, which was positively correlated with ADHD and 
MDD, and negatively correlated with anorexia nervosa [as previous ly reported with a 
different dataset (24)] and schizophrenia.
Our enrichment analysis (fig. S7 and tables S8 to S12) demonstrated significant heritability 
enrichments between the CNS and generalized epilepsy, MDD, TS, college attainment, 
intelligence, neuroticism, and the never/ever smoked trait; between depressive symptoms 
and adrenal/pancreatic cells and tissues; as well as between hematopoietic cells (including 
immune system cells) and MS (fig. S7, A and B, and tables S8 and S9). We replicated the 
reported (CNS) enrichment for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and years of education 
(tables S8 and S9) and observed the reported enrichments for BMI (CNS), years of 
education (CNS), height (connective tissues and bone, cardiovascular system, and other), 
and Crohn’s disease (hematopoietic cells) from the same datasets (fig. S7, C and D) (26).

 MDD, and schizophrenia) and migraine, which was the only cross-correlated neurological 
disorder, show enrichment to conserved regions (tables S10 and S12), whereas the other 
neurological disorders with similar numbers of loci (MS, Alzheimer’s disease, and 
Parkinson’s disease) do not (fig. S7, A and B). Enrichment to conserved regions was also 
observed for neuroticism, intelligence, and college attainment and to H3K9ac peaks for BMI 
(tables S11 and S12).
Discussion
By integrating and analyzing the genome-wide association summary statistic data from 
consor tia of 25 brain disorders, we find that psychiatric disorders broadly share a 
considerable portion of their common variant genetic risk, especially across schizophrenia, 
MDD, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and ADHD, whereas neurological disorders are 
more genetically distinct. Across categories, psychiatric and neurologic disorders share 
relatively little common genetic risk, suggesting that multiple different and largely 
independently regulated etiological pathways may give rise to similar clinical manifestations 
[e.g., psychosis, which manifests in both schizophrenia (35) and Alzheimer’s disease (36)]. 
Except for migraine, which appears to share some genetic architecture with psychiatric 
disorders, the existing clinical delineation between neurology and psychiatry is corroborated 
at the level of common variant risk for the studied disorders.
On the basis of the observed results, we performed some exploratory analyses to address 
concerns about diagnostic overlap and misclassification, which are particularly relevant to 
psychiatric disorders, owing to their spectral nature. Given that the broad and continuous 
nature of psychiatric disorder spectra has long been clinically recognized (37–39) and that 
patients can, in small numbers, progress from one diagnosis to another (40), we evaluated to 
what extent this kind of diagnostic overlap could explain the observed correlations. Genetic 
correlation could arise if, for example, patients progress through multiple diagnoses over 
their lifetime or if some specific diagnostic boundaries between phenotype pairs are 
particularly porous to misclassification (table S5). Although, for instance, migraine and 
schizophrenia are unlikely to be mistaken for one another, there may be more substantial 
misclassification between particular psychiatric disorders, consistent with the clinical 
controversies in classification. Previous work (41) suggests that substantial misclassification 
(on the order of 15 to 30%, depending on whether it is uni- or bidirectional) is required to 
introduce false levels of genetic correlation. We found that the observed levels of correlation 
are unlikely to appear in the absence of underlying genetic correlation (table S6), as it is 
apparent that a very high degree of misclassification (up to 79%) would be required to 
produce the observed correlations in the absence of any true genetic correlation and that 
reasonably expected misclassification would have limited impact on the observed rg (fig. 
S8). Therefore, these results suggest true sharing of a substantial fraction of the common 
variant genetic architecture among psychiatric disorders as well as between behavioral-
cognitive measures and brain disorders. We also performed large-scale simulations to 
explore the effect of sample size, polygenicity, and degree of correlation on power to detect 
significant correlations. First, we established that the observed heritability of the simulated 
misclassified traits in the UK Biobank data behaves as would be theoretically expected (fig. 
S9A) and that the effects on observed correlation (fig. S9, B and C) are in line with the 
Page 8

 estimates from family data (41). Reasonably low levels of misclassification or changes to the 
exact level of heritability appear unlikely to induce significant correlations, as observed in 
the power analysis (fig. S10), though a lower observed heritability caused by substantial 
misclassification (fig. S9A) will decrease the power to estimate true genetic overlap.
The high degree of genetic correlation among the psychiatric disorders adds further evidence 
that current clinical diagnostics do not reflect specific genetic etiology for these disorders 
and that genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders do not respect clinical diagnostic 
boundaries. Rather, this finding suggests a more interconnected genetic etiology, in contrast 
to that of neurological disorders, and underscores the need to refine psychiatric diagnostics. 
This study may provide important “scaffolding” to support a framework for investigating 
mental disorders, incorporating many levels of information to understand basic dimensions 
of brain function.
The observed positive genetic correlations are consistent with a few hypothetical scenarios. 
For example, this observation may reflect the existence of some portion of common genetic 
risk factors conferring risks for multiple psychiatric disorders and where other distinct 
additional factors, both genetic and nongenetic, contribute to the eventual clinical 
presentation. The presence of significant genetic correlation may also reflect the phenotypic 
overlap between any two disorders; for example, the sharing between schizophrenia and 
ADHD might reflect underlying difficulties in executive functioning, which are well-
established in both disorders (42), and that the shared risk arises from a partial capture of its 
shared genetic component. Similarly, we might speculate that a shared mechanism 
underlying cognitive biases may extend from over-valued ideas to delusions (ranging from 
anorexia nervosa and OCD to schizophrenia), and that this heritable intermediate trait 
confers pleiotropic risk to multiple outcomes. This kind of latent variable could give rise to 
the observed genetic correlation between disorders, owing to the shared portion of variation 
affecting that variable. Though a combination of these is likely, more genome-wide 
significant loci are needed to evaluate these overlaps at the locus level.
Conversely, the low correlations observed across neurological disorders suggest that the 
current classification reflects relatively specific genetic etiologies, although the limited 
sample size for some of these disorders and the lack of inclusion of disorders conceived as 
“circuit-based” (e.g., restless legs syndrome, sleep disorders, and possibly essential tremor) 
constrain the full generalizability of this conclusion. On the basis of our observations, 
degenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases) would therefore not 
be expected to share their polygenic risk profiles with a neuroimmunological disorder (such 
as MS) or neurovascular disorder (such as ischemic stroke). Similarly, we see limited 
evidence for the reported comorbidity between migraine with aura and ischemic stroke (43) 
(rg = 0.29, P = 0.099); however, the standard errors of this comparison are too high to draw 
strong conclusions. At the disorder subtype level, migraine with and without aura (rg = 0.48, 
P = 1.79 × 10−5) show substantial genetic correlation, whereas focal and generalized 
epilepsy (rg = 0.16, P = 0.388) show much less.
The few significant correlations across neurology and psychiatry—namely, between 
migraine and ADHD, MDD, and TS—suggest modest shared etiological overlap across the

 neurology-psychiatry distinction. The comorbidity of migraine with MDD, TS, and ADHD 
has been previously reported in epidemiological studies (44–47), whereas the previously 
reported comorbidity between migraine and bipolar disorder seen in epidemiological studies 
(48) was not reflected in our estimate of genetic correlation (rg = −0.03, P = 0.406).
Several phenotypes show only very low-level correlations with any of the other disorders 
and phenotypes that we studied, despite large sample size and robust evidence for 
heritability, which suggests that their common variant genetic risk may largely be unique. 
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and MS show extremely limited sharing with the 
other phenotypes and with each other. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of each of these conditions (49–51), as it has for migraine (52) and many 
psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia (53), but no considerable shared heritability 
was observed with either of those conditions nor with Crohn’s disease, nor did we observe 
enrichment for immune-related tissues in the functional partitioning (fig. S7) as observed for 
Crohn’s disease. Although this does not preclude the sharing of individual 
neuroinflammatory mechanisms in these disorders, the large-scale lack of shared common 
variant genetic influences supports the distinctiveness of disorder etiology. Further, we 
observed significant enrichment of heritability for immunological cells and tissues in MS 
only, showing that inflammation-specific regulatory marks in the genome do not show 
overall enrichment for common variant risk for either Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases 
[though this does not preclude the effects of specific, not particularly polygenic 
neuroinflammatory mechanisms (54)]. Among psychiatric disorders, ASD and TS showed a 
similar absence of correlation with other disorders, although this may reflect small sample 
sizes.
Analysis of the Big Five personality measures suggest that the current sample sizes may be 
large enough for correlation testing. Neuroticism, which has by far the largest sample size, 
shows several significant correlations. Most significant of these was to MDD (rg = 0.737, P 
= 5.04 × 10−96), providing evidence for the link between these phenotypes, as reported for 
polygenic risk scores (55) and twin studies (56, 57); as well as other psychiatric disorders 
(Fig. 4 and table S7B). The correlation between MDD and anxiety disorders, with a similar 
pattern of correlation and the dimensional measures of depressive symptoms, subjective 
well-being, and neuroticism suggests that they all tag a similar underlying etiology. The 
significant correlation between coronary artery disease and MDD supports the link between 
MDD and CAD (58), and the observed correlation between ADHD and smoking initiation 
(rg = 0.374, P = 3.15 × 10−6) is consistent with the epidemio-logical evidence of overlap (59) 
and findings from twin studies (60).
For the neurological disorders, five (Alzheimer’s disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, 
ischemic and early onset stroke, and migraine) showed significant negative genetic 
correlation to the cognitive measures, whereas two (epilepsy and focal epilepsy) showed 
moderate negative genetic correlation (fig. S5). For Alzheimer’s disease, poor cognitive 
performance in early life has been linked to increased risk for developing the disorder (61), 
but to our knowledge no such connection has been reported for other phenotypes. Among 
the psychiatric disorders, ADHD, anxiety disorders, and MDD show a significant negative 
correlation to cognitive and education attainment measures, whereas the remaining five of

 the eight psychiatric disorders (anorexia nervosa, ASD, bipolar disorder, OCD, and 
schizophrenia) showed significant positive genetic correlation with one or more cognitive 
measures. These results suggest the existence of a link between cognitive performance in 
early life and the genetic risk for both psychiatric and neurological brain disorders. The basis 
of the genetic correlations between education, cognition, and brain disorders may have a 
variety of root causes, including indexing performance differences on the basis of behavioral 
dysregulation (e.g., ADHD relating to attentional problems during cognitive tests), or may 
reflect ascertainment biases in certain disorders conditional on impaired cognition (e.g., 
individuals with lower cognitive reserve being more rapidly identified for Alzheimer’s 
disease), but the results could also suggest a direct link between the underlying etiologies.
BMI shows significant positive genetic correlation to ADHD, consistent with a meta-
analysis linking ADHD to obesity (62), and negative genetic correlation with anorexia 
nervosa, OCD, and schizophrenia. This is consistent with evidence for enrichment of BMI 
heritability in CNS tissues (26) that suggest neuronal involvement (63); this may also 
provide a partial genetic explanation for lower BMI in anorexia nervosa patients even after 
recovery (64). Given that no strong correlations were observed between BMI and any of the 
neurological phenotypes, BMI’s brain-specific genetic architecture may be more closely 
related to behavioral phenotypes. Ischemic stroke and BMI show surprisingly little genetic 
correlation in this analysis (rg = 0.07, P = 0.26), suggesting that although BMI is a risk 
factor for stroke (65), there is little evidence for shared common genetic effects. These 
analyses also suggest that the reported reduced rates of cardiovascular disease in individuals 
with histories of anorexia nervosa (66, 67) are more likely due to BMI-related secondary 
effects. The limited evidence of genetic correlation of anorexia nervosa with intracerebral 
hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, early onset stroke, and coronary artery disease suggests that 
any lower cardiovascular mortality is more likely due to direct BMI-related effects rather 
than to genetic risk variants.
The genetic correlation results presented here indicate that the clinical boundaries for the 
studied psychiatric phenotypes do not reflect distinct underlying pathogenic processes. This 
suggests that genetically informed analyses may provide a basis for restructuring of 
psychiatric nosology, consistent with twin- and family-based results. In contrast, 
neurological disorders show greater genetic specificity, and although it is important to 
emphasize that while some brain disorders are underrepresented here, our results 
demonstrate the limited evidence for widespread common genetic risk sharing between 
psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, we provide strong evidence that both 
psychiatric and neurological disorders show robust correlations with cognitive and 
personality measures, indicating avenues for follow-up studies. Further analysis is needed to 
evaluate whether overlapping genetic contributions to psychiatric pathology may influence 
treatment choices. Ultimately, such developments are promising steps toward reducing 
diagnostic heterogeneity and eventually improving the diagnostics and treatment of 
psychiatric disorders.

 Materials and methods summary
We collected GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics for 25 brain disorders and 17 other 
phenotypes from various consortia and, where necessary, generated new, non–sex-stratified 
European cohort– only versions of the meta-analyses (25). All datasets underwent uniform 
quality control (25). For each trait, by using the LDSC framework (24), the total additive 
common SNP heritability present in the summary statistics (h2g) was estimated by 
regressing the association χ2 statistic of a SNP against the total amount of common genetic 
variation tagged by that SNP, for all SNPs. Genetic correlations (rg; i.e., the genome-wide 
average shared genetic risk) for pairs of phenotypes were estimated by regressing the 
product of z-scores, rather than the χ2 statistic, for each phenotype and for each SNP. 
Significance was assessed by Bonferroni multiple testing correction via estimating the 
number of independent brain disorder pheno-types via matrix decomposition (25). 
Functional and partitioning analyses for the GWAS data-sets were also performed using 
LDSC regression. Power analyses and simulation work to aid in interpretation of the results 
were conducted using genotype data from the UK Biobank resource (25).
