ABSTRACT
Background and objective: Whilst the impact of clini-
copathological factors on the prognosis of malignant
pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is well understood, socio-
economic and geographic factors have received less
attention. We analysed the relationship between geo-
graphic and socioeconomic factors upon survival and
treatment
provision
in
a
large
series
of
patients
with MPM.
Methods: We assessed MPM patients awarded compen-
sation between 2002 and 2009 with additional MPM
incidence data from the New South Wales (NSW) Can-
cer Registry. The impact of geographic remoteness, dis-
tance from oncological multidisciplinary team (MDT)
and Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and
Disadvantage (IRSAD) upon survival, clinical features
and treatment received was analysed.
Results: We identified 910 patients (67% residing in
major cities; 92% <50 km from MDT). Median overall
survival was 10.0 months. On multivariate analysis, age
>70 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.39), male gender (HR =
1.36), non-epithelioid histological subtype (HR = 2.18)
and IRSAD status by decreasing quintile (HR = 1.06)
were independent prognostic factors. There was no sig-
nificant advantage for patients residing in major cities
(10.6 months
vs
8.8 months;
P = 0.162)
or
within
50 km of MDT (10.3 months vs 7.8 months; P = 0.539).
Patient’s geographic location and distance to MDT did
not impact chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy or
extrapleural pneumonectomy provision. Socioeconom-
ically disadvantaged patients were significantly less
likely
to
receive
chemotherapy
(37.4%
vs
54.8%;
P = 0.001).
Conclusion: This study provides evidence for differ-
ences in the treatment and survival according to socio-
economic status for compensated MPM patients in
NSW. Further research is warranted to seek additional
explanations for the differences noted by comparing the
treatments and outcomes of compensated and non-
compensated MPM patients in NSW.

INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly
lethal tumour arising from the pleural mesothelial sur-
face affecting populations formerly exposed to asbestos.1
Following World War 2, the demand for inexpensive,
fire-retardant (building) materials rapidly surged in
Australia and New South Wales (NSW) was not an
exception. Although the first reports on the carcinoge-
nicity of asbestos appeared from 1953,2,3 it was not until
2003 that all forms of asbestos were banned in Australia.
The NSW Dust Diseases Board (DDB) is a state
agency providing compensation and support for indivi-
duals exposed to asbestos in an occupational setting in
NSW. The DDB collects comprehensive data from all

SUMMARY AT A GLANCE:
The impact of geographic and socioeconomic fac-
tors upon survival in patients with malignant pleural
mesothelioma (MPM) is unclear. Despite ‘universal’
health
care,
socioeconomic
status
significantly
affects health outcomes. No significant impact on
survival is noted for patients residing further from
oncology services. Further prospective research may
guide resource allocation.

 patients registered, including demographic, exposure
history and clinicopathological details.
We previously examined a large series of subjects
awarded compensation by the DDB and analysed the
impact of clinicopathological factors upon survival.4
Less
is
known
about
the
potential
associations
between socioeconomic and geographic factors and
survival of MPM patients. Cancer registry data from
South East England between 1985 and 2002 revealed
differences in the utilization of chemotherapy, radio-
therapy and surgery between geographically distinct
cancer networks. However, this did not appear to
impact upon survival.5
In Australia, 69% of the population live in major
cities with the remainder residing in regional areas.6
In 2013, the potential influence of the place of resi-
dence on patterns of care was studied in a relatively
small series of MPM patients.7 Major differences in
survival and treatment receipt between patients living
in major cities or regional NSW were not noted. How-
ever, there remain concerns about the impact of living
in ‘remote Australia’.8 Other studies assessing the
impact of remoteness in NSW have demonstrated a
significant survival detriment for patients residing in
remote locations across a variety of malignancies.9,10 A
significant distance to the nearest cancer centre may
be associated with a delay of diagnosis and treatment.
At the same time, socioeconomic factors might influ-
ence access to medical services. Therefore, we decided
to investigate the potential associations between geo-
graphic and socioeconomic factors and treatment pro-
vision and survival in a larger series of MPM patients
across NSW.
METHODS
Patient data
We reviewed clinical, pathological and treatment data
collected from patients who had developed MPM as a
result of exposure to asbestos in an occupational
setting.
We identified 1121 MPM patients awarded compen-
sation by the DDB between 1 January 2002 and
31 December 2009. Patients were excluded if they
resided or if their care was received outside of NSW
(17%), had a diagnosis of primary peritoneal mesotheli-
oma (<1%) or basic clinical data were unavailable
(<1%). Clinical and pathological data of MPM patients
were extracted from the DDB database, and supple-
mented with information from data from treating clini-
cians where available.
NSW Death Certificates were linked to the DDB
records, and mortality ascertained up to 27 June 2012.
The demographic data extracted included gender, date
and age of diagnosis, residential address at registration,
asbestos exposure and smoking history. This study was
approved by the Sydney Local Health District Ethics
Committee (HREC/12/CRGH/73).
Location of residence was classified according to the
Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC)
Remoteness Classification in the categories of major
city, inner regional, outer regional and remote NSW.11
Patient’s
place
of
residence
was
also
classified
according to the Index of Relative Socioeconomic
Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD), a composite
measure of a number of social and economic factors
such as income, rental costs, internet access and
employment.12 Suburbs were categorized in quintiles
based on their IRSAD relative to other NSW suburbs.
The
‘Canrefer’
(Cancer
referral
network,
www.
canrefer.org.au) tool developed by the Cancer Institute
NSW divides suburbs of residency according to their
proximity to the nearest oncological multidisciplinary
team
(MDT,
0–10,
10–20,
20–50,
50–100
and
100–200 km). We utilized this tool for the purpose of
assessing this proximity in our patients, according to
the predefined criteria.
Individual pathology reports (diagnostic biopsy/sur-
gical specimen), radiological reports (computed tomog-
raphy (CT) imaging to estimate clinical stage as per
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria13)
and treatment data (surgery, chemotherapy and radio-
therapy) were reviewed.
To assess the external validity of our results, we com-
pared the number of DDB subjects to incident MPM
subjects registered with the NSW Cancer Registry by
postcode and Local Health District (LHD). Briefly, noti-
fications to the NSW Cancer Registry of invasive can-
cers are mandated under the NSW Public Health Act
2010. We mapped the number of DDB and NSW Can-
cer Registry patients by NSW postcodes. Maps were
produced using the R programme for statistical com-
puting and the ggplot2 package.
Statistical analysis
The
impact of demographic and clinical variables
(including IRSAD divided in quintile groups) upon prog-
nosis was assessed using log-rank analysis and Kaplan–
Meier assessment. Variables with P < 0.20 were then
analysed with adjustment for other covariates in a multi-
variate Cox regression model. Survival was defined as
the period from diagnosis to death or censorship.
Chi-square testing analysed the effect of IRSAD sta-
tus (highest and lowest IRSAD quintiles), distance to
MDT and remoteness classification upon clinical fac-
tors (including age, gender, stage, histological subtype
and smoking history) and treatment received. The ana-
lyses were performed using IBM SPSS Version 22 (IBM
Corp., NY, USA).
Adding
NSW
Cancer
Registry
data,
age-
standardized incidence rates were calculated. Count
numerator data from each case series were grouped
to create combinations for LHDs and 5-year age
groups with denominator data obtained from the
NSW Health statistics website (http://www.healthstats.
nsw.gov.au). Due to sparseness of case series data,
we combined all numerator and denominator data
for the period 2002–2009. The age group weightings
used were from the Australian 2001 standard popula-
tion. Rates were calculated separately for both case
series using the dstdize command using Stata Statisti-
cal Software: 12.0 (StataCorp Lp, College Station, TX,
USA). Age-standardized incidence rate estimates and
their 95% lower and upper confidence limits are
presented.

 RESULTS
Patient characteristics
A total of 1121 MPM subjects were awarded compensa-
tion by the NSW DDB between 2002 and 2009. Of
these, 910 (81%) were included in this analysis. Patients
were excluded if residing (or undergoing medical
follow-up) outside of NSW (17%), having primary peri-
toneal disease (<1%) or missing basic clinical informa-
tion (<1%). One thousand five hundred and ninety-six
patients were notified to the NSW Cancer Registry dur-
ing the period 2002–2009, suggesting that subjects
registered with the DDB and who live and receive treat-
ment in NSW represent about 57% of all MPM patients.
The geographic distributions of these case series are
shown in Figure 1. Generally, MPM patients were less
likely to be included in this study if they lived in LHDs
that bordered another state or territory (Fig. S1, Sup-
plementary Information).
Patient characteristics for the DDB series are given in
Table 1. Ninety percent were males, median age
72 years and histological subtype: epithelioid in 60%
(13% biphasic/17% sarcomatoid/10% unknown). The
majority of patients resided in major cities (67%), 33%
of them were from either inner regional or outer
regional areas and <1% of patients lived in remote
NSW. Sixty-five percent of patients were within 10 km
distance of an oncology unit with access to a multidis-
ciplinary (thoracic or general) oncology meeting and
92% within a distance of 50 km of an oncology unit.
Forty percent of patients for whom smoking history
was available were never-smokers. Forty-one percent
of patients had chemotherapy, the majority receiving a
platinum-pemetrexed combination. Seven percent of
patients underwent radical surgical treatment (extra-
pleural pneumonectomy) and post-operative radiother-
apy was prescribed in 4% of patients.
Survival analysis
Median survival of the whole group of 910 patients
was 10 months (range: 0–124 months). As previously
reported,4
non-epithelioid
histological
subtype,
advanced age and male gender were significantly
(P ≤ 0.001)
associated
with

survival
(Table 2). Median survival was 1.8 months longer
among
patients
in
major
cities
compared
with
regional/remote areas (10.6 months vs 8.8 months),
although
this
was
not
statistically
significant
(P = 0.162). A similar finding was observed among
those residing closer than 50 km to a thoracic or
general oncology MDT (10.3 months vs 7.8 months),
but
again
not
statistically
significant
(P = 0.539).
Lower socioeconomic status was significantly associ-
ated with a reduction in median survival (P = 0.046),
with
a
4.6-month
difference
in
survival
between
highest
and
lowest
socioeconomic
quintiles
(8.4 months vs 13.0 months).
On multivariate analysis, age, gender, histological
subtype and IRSAD quintile remained independent
prognostic factors, whereas no significant differences
between area of residence were noted (Table 3). Upon
analysis of patients who received chemotherapy, IRSAD
quintile remained a statistically significant independent
prognostic factor (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.09 (95% CI:
1.01–1.16; P = 0.022)).
Impact of socioeconomic and geographic
factors on clinical pathways
Sixty-seven percent of patients resided within major
cities in NSW according to ASGC Remoteness Classifi-
cation. Patients living in cities were older than those
living in regional/remote NSW (age < 70: 38.7% vs
45.9%; P = 0.037). Most other characteristics (gender,
histological subtype, tumour stage at diagnosis and
treatment provided) were comparable. Patients from
regional/remote areas were less likely to receive pallia-
tive radiotherapy than patients residing in major cities
(16.0% vs 23.9%; P < 0.01).
A similar observation was made when we stratified
patients according to distance to the nearest multidisci-
plinary oncology meeting, with no significant differ-
ences in regards to clinicopathological factors, surgical
intervention and chemotherapy receipt. The use of

DISCUSSION
Prognostic factors for MPM such as age, gender and
histological subtype have been well established in a
number of studies.4,14,15 However, the effects of geogra-
phy and socioeconomic status upon survival have
received less attention.
Whilst the majority of Australians reside within
major cities, a dispersed population live in regional
centres and smaller towns throughout the country.6
Previous studies in MPM have failed to reveal major
differences in prognosis or treatment received between
individuals living in metropolitan NSW compared with
regional areas.7 In the current series encompassing
over 900 patients, the median survival of those living in
metropolitan areas and closer to an oncological MDT
meeting was increased by approximately 2 months.
This increase was not statistically significant, with no
difference noted on multivariate analysis suggesting
that the differences on univariate analysis could be
accounted for by other factors.
Further analyses demonstrated that patients residing
in rural/regional areas, or those further from an MDT,
were, apart from age, well matched to their metropoli-
tan counterparts. Furthermore, the utilization of che-
motherapy, surgery and post-operative radiotherapy
did not differ. However, the use of palliative radiother-
apy in the treatment of MPM was reduced. This is not
surprising as rural patients with symptomatic concerns
may prefer to seek local palliative care support as an
alternative to palliative radiotherapy in a distant centre.
It is important to note, however, that our series
included very few patients residing in ‘remote’ or ‘very
remote’ areas. As such, even in large series such as
this, the true impact of living in regional/remote areas
upon survival is difficult to establish. The advent of vir-
tual clinical reviews and multidisciplinary meetings via
phone or video may serve to further alleviate the diffi-
culties faced by patients from outer regional and
remote areas.
In our series, residing in geographic areas of greater
socioeconomic disadvantage conferred an independent
survival detriment. Furthermore, significantly fewer
patients in lower socioeconomic areas received chemo-
therapy. This is consistent with meta-analyses per-
formed
in
patients
with
more
common
cancer
diagnoses
where
patients
in
socioeconomically
deprived settings were less likely to receive surgery or
chemotherapy.16

 mortality rates and an increased risk of advanced stage
disease in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged
populations.17,18
A number of factors may contribute to these find-
ings. The higher rates of co-morbidities in lower socio-
economic areas are well established, likely influencing
decisions to prescribe chemotherapy.19,20 Furthermore,
higher smoking rates, as evident in our analysis, may
be associated with a greater risk of co-morbidity that
may also influence treatment decisions. Due to the ret-
rospective nature of this study, our conclusions are
limited by the fact that not all clinical data (co-morbid-
ities) were available. However, when restricting ana-
lyses
to
patients
receiving
chemotherapy,
IRSAD
groups remain a statistically significant prognostic fac-
tor, suggesting that the receipt of chemotherapy alone
is not a confounding factor.
Whilst universal health care should minimize the
disparity between higher and lower socioeconomic
groups, it has limited influence over other financial fac-
tors such as ‘gap’ payments, the ability to take time off
work, transport to health centres and the availability of
support services. Furthermore, although DDB financial
compensation is available to all NSW workers exposed
to asbestos in an occupational setting, victims of asbes-
tos exposure in the environmental and self-employed
settings are excluded from DDB support. As such, we
query whether the socio-economic disparity demon-
strated in this study may be more expressed in uncom-
pensated patients for whom the financial pressures
may be more pronounced.
As such, we recommend that further research be
undertaken to better understand factors that may influ-
ence MPM treatment and survival such as assessment
of co-morbidities and patient and physician treatment
preferences. We also consider that population-based
studies using data linkage methods would be important
to investigate MPM treatment and outcome differences
between patients who received DDB compensation and
those who did not.
Comparison between MPM patients awarded com-
pensation by the NSW DDB and those registered by
the NSW Cancer Registry demonstrates a similar geo-
graphical distribution. Of note, all districts appear to
have a significant volume of patients who were not
awarded compensation by the NSW DDB for whom
patterns of care and treatment outcomes remain
unknown. This appears to be relatively consistent
across the majority of LHDs; however, in a number of
districts,
the
DDB
rates
were
comparatively
low.
Patients receiving medical care outside of NSW were
excluded from the DDB dataset, and as such the
majority of patients at close proximity to state borders
do not appear in this series. However, variable Dust
Diseases Authority (DDA)/DDB awareness in amongst
some regional areas may contribute. This will require
assessment in future research.
The impact of MPM can be demonstrated across
communities regardless of geographic and socioeco-
nomic boundaries. Whilst geographic boundaries do
not appear to influence the receipt of chemotherapy
and surgical intervention, the consequences of socioec-
onomic status upon both the receipt of treatment and
survival are clear.
