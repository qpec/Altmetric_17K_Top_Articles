Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal disease with no 
known cause. Case studies primarily of athletes and several case-control studies have suggested 
that high levels of strenuous physical activity (PA) may increase the risk for ALS. This 
relationship has yet to be evaluated among women in population-based cohort studies.

 OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the relationship between PA and risk for ALS mortality in a large 
cohort of postmenopausal women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled 
161 809 postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 79 years (mean [SD] age, 63.6 [7.24] years), between 
1993 and 1998 into either a clinical trial or an observational study at 40 clinical research centers 
across the United States. We conducted a cohort study from November 2014 to September 2015 
using baseline and mortality data during an average of 9.6 years of follow-up from the entire WHI 
cohort, through September 1, 2013 (with 1.1% lost to follow-up), to address whether there is a 
relationship between PA and ALS mortality.
EXPOSURES—The WHI assessed frequency and duration of mild, moderate, and strenuous PA 
at baseline via self-administered questionnaire.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Underlying cause of death from ALS collected from 
death certificates.
RESULTS—The WHI enrolled 161 809 women, of whom 165 died of ALS; women who died of 
ALS were older (median age, 66 years; interquartile range, 61-69 years) compared with the total 
WHI study population (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 57-69 years). Age-adjusted ALS 
mortality rates varied from 7.4 (95% CI, 5.5-9.9)/100 000 person-years for no strenuous PA to 
10.6 (95% CI, 5.6-20.0)/100 000 person-years for strenuous PA 3 or more days per week (P = .07). 
Adjusted for age and body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in 
meters squared), the odds ratio for death from ALS for participants with strenuous PA 3 or more 
days per week compared with no reported strenuous PA was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.02-2.37; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study to report 
an increased risk for ALS mortality associated with strenuous PA in postmenopausal women. The 
association between strenuous PA and ALS risk observed does not compromise the overall benefit 
of strenuous PA for total mortality, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer reported in other 
WHI investigations, but it may provide an important clue to the etiology of ALS, if replicated by 
other studies.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of degenerative motor neuron 
disease in adulthood,1 with an estimated incidence between 1 and 2 cases per 100 000 
persons per year.2,3 The incidence of ALS rises with increasing age, particularly among 
men, with a mean age at onset of approximately 55 to 58 years.4,5 The disease is typically 
rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal, with a median survival of approximately 2 to 4 
years after onset.1
The specific cause of ALS is unknown.6 Approximately 5% to 10% of cases are familial and 
characterized by an autosomal mode of inheritance.7–11 Expansion of hexanucleotide repeat 
sequences in the noncoding region of C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of familial 
ALS and is present in about 10% of sporadic cases.12,13 The remaining majority of sporadic 
cases have no single identifiable causative agent. Cigarette smoking14,15 and other 
environmental and occupational exposures16–19 have been reported as increasing risk for 
ALS. Increased risk for ALS mortality has also been observed in men with a history of 
military service.20,21

 Recent research has suggested a link between strenuous physical activity (PA) and ALS 
onset. Early investigations noted higher rates of death from ALS among professional athletes 
than in the general population.22–24 Only a few population-based studies have investigated 
the potential relationship between strenuous PA or past participation in athletics and the 
occurrence of ALS, yielding inconsistent results.25,26 Some case-control studies have 
provided moderate evidence for an increased incidence of ALS later in life related to leisure 
PA and sports participation,18,27–29 while other studies have reported no association between 
the volume of leisure PA and ALS.30
To date, no large population-based longitudinal study has enrolled enough women, has 
collected information on strenuous PA, and has provided enough follow-up time to assess 
risk for death from ALS. We used data from more than 161 000 women in the Women’s 
Health Initiative (WHI)31 to evaluate the relationship between strenuous PA and risk of ALS 
mortality. We hypothesized that frequency, duration, and energy expenditure of strenuous PA 
are associated with an increased risk for ALS mortality. As a secondary evaluation, we 
examined relationships between light and moderate intensity PA to determine whether there 
may be an intensity effect for PA and the risk for death from ALS.
Methods
The WHI recruited 161 809 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years between 1993 and 
1998 at 40 clinical centers across the United States into 1 or more arms of the clinical trial 
component or into the observational study.31 We conducted a cohort study from November 
2014 to September 2015 using baseline and mortality data from all women enrolled in the 
WHI, regardless of the study component. The primary end point was underlying cause of 
death from ALS reported on death certificates. Mortality follow-up has been practically 
complete, with only about 1.1% lost to follow-up. Information on 165 deaths in which ALS 
was the underlying cause was available for the current study based on follow-up to 
September 1, 2013. Institutional review board approval was obtained at each clinical center, 
overseen by the WHI coordinating center. All participants provided written informed 
consent.
A self-administered personal habits questionnaire ascertained usual PA, exercise, and 
lifestyle information at the time of WHI enrollment. Physical activities and exercise were 
classified as mild, moderate (described as not exhausting), or strenuous or very hard 
(described as “work[ing] up a sweat and your heart beats fast”), with examples given for 
each category. Activity frequency within each category was reported in days per week and 
duration was estimated in 20-minute increments (<20, 20-39, 40-59, and ≥60 minutes). 
Metabolic equivalent task (MET) scores assigned to each category from a compendium of 
PAs32 were used to calculate energy expenditure in MET-hours per week in each category 
from reported frequency and duration (using the midpoint of the 20-minute intervals). These 
summary variables have been used in several analyses of the WHI cohort.33–35 The 
frequency, duration, and energy expenditure within each intensity of PA were considered 
individually in examining the relationship between PA and ALS mortality. An additional 
question asked participants to indicate whether they usually did strenuous or very hard 
exercise 3 or more days per week at ages 18, 35, and 50 years.

 The PA questions have been tested for reliability and validity in the WHI population.36,37 
The test-retest reliability for PA variables, including strenuous PA, reported as a weighted κ 
coefficient ranged from 0.67 to 0.71.38,39 The interclass correlation coefficient for total 
energy expenditure for recreational activity was 0.77. Sixty-three women completed both the 
7-day PA recall and the WHI personal habits questionnaires and wore an accelerometer for 1 
week. Both questionnaires correlated well (r = 0.73) with the accelerometer. The WHI 
measure of PA had comparable validity, sensitivity, and measurement bias compared with 
the 7-day PA questionnaire.37
The entire WHI cohort (n = 161 809) was used for the analyses. Descriptive statistics 
characterized the study population. Categorical variables are presented as frequency and 
percentage and continuous variables are reported as mean (standard deviation) or, if the 
distribution was skewed, median (interquartile range). Two-sample t tests compared baseline 
PA variables between WHI participants who died of ALS and the remaining cohort. Age-
adjusted mortality rates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using direct 
method with the entire WHI population as the standard population. To quantify hazard ratios 
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for ALS mortality, we used Cox proportional hazards 
models adjusted for potential confounders. Sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding 
women who died of ALS within 2 years of WHI baseline (n = 4). Analyses were performed 
with SAS version 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute, Inc). All tests were 2-sided at α = .
05.
Results
The WHI study has included 165 women with ALS as the underlying cause of death as of 
the 2013 follow-up. Among these women, the mean (SD) follow-up time to death or censor 
was 9.59 (4.0) years (range, 0.87-17 years). The distribution of baseline characteristics and 
unadjusted percentage of deaths from ALS for the WHI cohort are presented in Table 1. 
Women who died of ALS had a median age of 66 years (interquartile range, 61-69 years) at 
study entry, were predominantly non-Hispanic white (n = 145 [87.9%]), and were not 
employed at the time of enrollment (n = 101 [61.2%]). Baseline characteristics associated 
with ALS mortality in this sample included increased age (P < .001), lower body mass index 
(BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) (P = .04), not 
having diabetes (P = .03), and marital status of never married and married compared with 
divorced, separated, or widowed (P = .04). Reported cardiovascular disease and cancer at 
baseline were not significantly related to the risk of ALS. Risk was slightly higher among 
women who reported arthritis, but there was no observed relationship with joint pain, 
generally associated with decreased PA, or with depression score (data not shown).
Baseline characteristics of women and reported frequency and energy expenditure of 
strenuous PA for the entire WHI cohort are shown in eTable 1 and the eFigure in the 
Supplement. Overall, 12.6% of women reported strenuous PA on 3 or more days per week 
and 70.8% reported no strenuous PA. There was an elevated percentage of deaths from ALS 
with increasing frequency of strenuous PA in the WHI, with percentage of death from ALS 
varying from 0.09% for 0 days per week to 0.16% for 4 days per week (P for trend = .06) 
(Table 2). Age-adjusted ALS mortality rates varied from 7.4 (95% CI, 5.5-9.9)/100 000

 person-years for women who reported no strenuous PA to 10.6 (95% CI, 5.6-20.0)/100 000 
person-years for women who did strenuous PA on 3 or more days per week (P = .07).
Women who died of ALS compared with those who did not die of ALS had greater mean 
(SD) minutes of strenuous PA per week (39.1 [75.3] vs 29.3 [68.3] min/wk, respectively; 
age-adjusted P = .04) and energy expenditure from strenuous PA (4.6 [8.8] vs 3.4 [8.0] 
MET-h/wk, respectively; age-adjusted P = .03) (Table 3). There was no association between 
increasing duration of strenuous PA per episode at baseline and death from ALS (P for trend 
= .29) (Table 2). There were no significant associations between frequency or duration of 
either mild or moderate PA and ALS mortality (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Women also self-reported information on strenuous PA 3 or more days per week at ages 18, 
35, and 50 years (Figure 1). About half (50.6%) of the women with eventual death from 
ALS reported that they had performed strenuous PA 3 or more days per week at age 50 
years, with a similar percentage at age 35 years (43.4%) and at age 18 years (46.8%). The 
HR for ALS mortality with strenuous PA 3 or more days per week compared with no 
strenuous PA at age 50 years was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.16-2.15), with a similar, although 
attenuated, association at baseline. However, there was no association between strenuous PA 
at ages 18 or 35 years and risk of ALS mortality.
In post hoc analysis, the association of strenuous PA with ALS mortality by baseline 
characteristics listed in Table 1 was further evaluated by comparing age-adjusted rates of 
death from ALS dichotomized into 3 or more days per week of strenuous PA vs no strenuous 
PA (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Age-adjusted rates of death from ALS were higher for 
those who participated in strenuous PA 3 or more days per week vs no strenuous PA for 
practically all categories except some college, hypertension, and high cholesterol levels. The 
age-adjusted rates of death from ALS for strenuous PA 3 or more days per week by baseline 
cigarette smoking, BMI, and diabetes status are presented in Figure 2. Smoking status was 
defined as never (<100 cigarettes/lifetime), past (≥100 cigarettes/lifetime and no use in the 
previous 6 months), and current (any cigarette use in the previous 6 months). Current 
smoking was relatively rare in the WHI (7.0%), and only 13 deaths from ALS occurred 
among current smokers. Age-adjusted rates of death from ALS had a nonsignificant increase 
across smoking categories. The association between strenuous PA and ALS mortality was 
primarily among women who were past cigarette smokers (Figure 2), with an age-adjusted 
HR of 2.34 (95% CI, 1.30-4.18) for ALS mortality with strenuous PA on 3 or more days per 
week compared with no strenuous PA among these women.
Body mass index was inversely related to death from ALS (Table 1). In stratified analysis, 
the age-adjusted HR was 2.47 (95% CI, 1.01-6.07) for ALS mortality with strenuous PA on 
3 or more days per week compared with none among women with a BMI of 30.0 or higher, 
and the relationship among women with a BMI lower than 25.0 or between 25.0 and 29.9 
was nonsignificant (Figure 2). In a logistic regression model adjusted for age and BMI, the 
odds ratio for death from ALS was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.02-2.37; P = .04) for women with 3 or 
more days per week of strenuous PA compared with no reported strenuous PA.

 Diabetes status was also associated with ALS mortality (Table 1), with women reporting no 
diabetes at baseline having higher rates of ALS mortality. In stratified analysis (Figure 2), 
the age-adjusted HR for death from ALS among nondiabetic women with 3 or more days per 
week of strenuous PA vs none was 1.46 (95% CI, 0.96-2.21). The few deaths from ALS 
among diabetic women (n = 3) and no deaths from ALS among diabetic women who 
performed strenuous PA on 3 or more days per week prohibited calculation of an HR for this 
subgroup.
In Cox proportional hazards models (Table 4), there was a nonsignificant trend for 
increasing hazard for death from ALS with increasing duration of strenuous PA (P = .11) 
when adjusted for education, cigarette smoking, region, race/ethnicity, BMI, and age. For 
duration of strenuous PA for 40 minutes or longer compared with no strenuous PA, the HR 
for ALS mortality was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.07-2.51). In a similar adjusted model, the HR was 
1.65 (95% CI, 0.99-2.73) for ALS mortality with 3 or more days per week of strenuous PA 
compared with no reported strenuous PA at baseline.
Discussion
The identification of modifiable risk factors for ALS is a promising approach to minimize 
the burden of this disease and to begin generating hypotheses as to the etiology, especially in 
sporadic cases. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to describe the relationship 
between PA and risk for ALS mortality in a cohort of postmenopausal women. The results of 
this WHI follow-up study support a possible direct association between strenuous PA, but 
not less intense PA, and risk of death from ALS that was independent of age, education, 
BMI, and smoking.
The largest population-based case-control study of lifetime PA and the risk of ALS was 
conducted recently by Huisman et al27 in the Netherlands. A total of 636 cases and 2166 
controls were identified who completed a semistructured questionnaire on lifelong 
occupations, sport activity, and active recreational hobbies. The ALS cases had significantly 
higher levels of leisure PA compared with controls, similar to the WHI findings. No 
significant effects were seen for cases and controls for organized strenuous PA such as 
marathons or triathlons or in occupational activity.
What might be the pathophysiology of strenuous PA and ALS risk? Harwood et al25 
suggested a relationship between oxidative stress and ALS. Increased metabolism during 
strenuous exercise may increase oxidative stress possibly associated with abnormal 
mitochondrial activity, potentially resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species and 
neuronal cell damage in genetically susceptible individuals. Longstreth et al40 also proposed 
that intense motor nerve firing during strenuous PA may cause glutamate toxic effects. The 
stronger positive association of strenuous PA and risk of death from ALS among former 
smokers in the WHI may be consistent with a cumulative effect of oxidative stress from 
cigarette smoking14 and increased amounts of strenuous PA following smoking cessation, 
eg, to prevent weight gain or as part of overall behavioral changes. Individuals who lack 
adequate antioxidant response perhaps from genetic abnormalities or dietary deficiencies 
may be at increased risk, consistent with the recent observation of a substantially decreased

 risk of ALS associated with increased intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.41 The 
suggested compound effect of oxidative stress from cigarette smoking and PA and 
inadequate antioxidant response supports the idea of a long preclinical phase of ALS similar 
to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.42
Associations between BMI and diabetes and risk for death from ALS were also observed in 
this sample. The lowest incidence of ALS was observed among women with a baseline BMI 
of 30.0 or higher, and very few deaths from ALS occurred among women with diabetes. One 
large longitudinal study that evaluated motor neuron disease, primarily ALS, among 1.3 
million women in England found an inverse association of BMI and ALS risk.43 However, 
the investigators did not include measures of PA. A very large population-based case-control 
study evaluated 3650 ALS cases from the Danish registry between 1982 and 2009 and 365 
000 controls matched on age and sex,44 finding a strong inverse association of both diabetes 
and obesity for patients with ALS who were aged 40 years or older. Another recent 
population-based case-control study in the Netherlands found that lower presymptomatic 
BMI was associated with ALS, increased energy intake, and fat consumption,45 adjusted for 
lifetime PA. These 4 large studies, including the WHI, are consistent in demonstrating the 
inverse association of BMI years before diagnosis of ALS and contribute to recent evidence 
that whole-body and cellular metabolism may play a role in the development of ALS.46
Any adverse association of strenuous PA and risk of death from ALS should be evaluated in 
the context of the known benefits of PA in the WHI34–36,47,48 and many other studies.49–52 
Previous studies of PA and health outcomes in the WHI reported that higher PA levels were 
associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer,35 ovarian cancer,47 cardiovascular disease,36 
and improved survival in women with incident breast cancer.34 The HR for increased risk for 
ALS mortality with strenuous PA in the WHI, even in this low-activity population, was 
similar in magnitude to the increased HR for total mortality, coronary heart disease 
incidence, and breast cancer incidence from no strenuous PA in the WHI during the same 
period. Therefore, even if substantiated by other studies, these findings should not affect the 
recommendations for increasing strenuous PA according to national guidelines.53
The low incidence of ALS restricts longitudinal studies of specific risk factors and ALS to 
very large cohorts. The WHI cohort has relatively complete mortality follow-up, information 
from participants about strenuous PA at baseline and ages 18, 35, and 50 years, and 
information on many other factors; therefore, it provided a unique opportunity to evaluate 
the possible association of strenuous PA and ALS. Even so, there are important limitations 
to the WHI data set.
The WHI was not designed to study ALS. Therefore, we depended on death certificates for 
underlying cause of death. It is possible that some women in the WHI with incident ALS 
who died were coded to another underlying cause of death, such as pneumonia and 
respiratory failure, thereby reducing the total number of incident deaths from ALS. Our 
estimated rate of ALS based on age of the cohort is consistent with the literature.2,4,5 It is 
thus unlikely that any missing deaths from ALS, eg, coded to another cause of death, 
substantially biased the observed associations with PA.

 The prevalence of strenuous PA 3 or more days per week in the WHI cohort was only 13%, 
thus reducing the power of the study despite the large sample size. The information on PA 
was collected from a self-administered questionnaire, which can introduce recall bias, 
particularly for reporting PA levels at ages 18, 35, and 50 years. Duration of strenuous PA 
was reported in 20-minute intervals, with a maximum of 1 hour or more. This may lead to 
underestimation of total energy expenditure from strenuous PA for those who reported 
exercising for at least 1 hour at a time. However, the strenuous PA measure was strongly 
related to the risk of other diseases (such as breast cancer and cardiovascular disease) and 
total mortality, was repeatable over time, and was correlated with accelerometer measures.
34–39,47,48
The analyses investigating the associations between other baseline characteristics and ALS 
mortality by strenuous PA were conducted post hoc, with limited exposure data collected at 
one time. Therefore, it is not possible to fully separate the influence of the primary exposure 
of strenuous PA on BMI, diabetes status, smoking, etc, and vice versa. The observed 
relationships between BMI, diabetes, and smoking and ALS mortality should thus be 
interpreted cautiously. It is also possible that other unmeasured factors explain the 
association between PA and death from ALS.
Conclusions
This study raises an interesting question about whether there may be a subpopulation of 
individuals more susceptible to adverse effects of strenuous PA or whether there are 
combinations of environmental exposures, such as tobacco smoke, unique occupations, 
genetic variations, or health states (ie, diabetes and BMI), and strenuous PA that increase 
risk for ALS. The results of this study, if replicated, may provide a clue for further 
etiological research into ALS and the effects of strenuous PA on neurological function. 
Additional longitudinal studies, especially in populations that are enriched with more 
physically active participants than the WHI, have more detailed measures of exposures, and 
include better evaluation of patients with ALS, are necessary to further test the relationship 
between strenuous PA and ALS mortality.

 Key Points
Question
Is strenuous physical activity a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mortality in 
postmenopausal women?
Findings
In this cohort study of 161 809 women enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative, there 
were 165 deaths from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through 2013. Women who self-
reported strenuous physical activity on 3 or more days per week at baseline had 
significant 56% increased odds for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mortality, adjusted for 
age and body mass index.
Meaning
If replicated by other studies, the observed association between strenuous physical 
activity and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mortality provides a clue to the etiology of the 
disease.

bCalculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
cThere were only 3 deaths from ALS among women with diabetes, with no deaths from ALS 
among diabetic women who performed strenuous PA on 3 or more days per week; age-
adjusted mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals could not be calculated by level of 
strenuous PA.
dSmoking status was defined as never (≥100 cigarettes/lifetime), past (100 cigarettes/lifetime 
and no use within the past 6 months), or current (any use within the past 6 months).
