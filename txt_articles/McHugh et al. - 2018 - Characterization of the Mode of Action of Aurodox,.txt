ABSTRACT
Recent work has demonstrated that the polyketide natural product Au-
rodox from Streptomyces goldiniensis is able to block the pathogenesis of the murine
pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. In this work, we aimed to gain a better understand-
ing of the mechanism of action of the compound. We show that Aurodox down-
regulates the expression of the type III secretion systems of enteropathogenic and
enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Furthermore, we have used transcriptomic analy-
sis to show that Aurodox inhibits the expression at the transcriptional level by re-
pressing the master regulator, ler. Our data support a model in which Aurodox acts
upstream of ler and not directly on the secretion system itself. Finally, we have
shown that Aurodox, unlike some traditional antibiotics, does not induce expression
of RecA, which is essential for the production of Shiga toxin. We propose that these
properties nominate Aurodox as a promising antivirulence therapy for the treatment
of these infections.

E
nterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a zoonotic pathogen responsible for
foodborne outbreaks of diarrhea which can escalate to hemorrhagic colitis and
hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) (1). Symptoms of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli
(EPEC) infection are typically less severe; however, this pathotype remains the leading
cause of diarrheal deaths in the developing world (2). As with many other Gram-
negative pathogens, EHEC and EPEC utilize the type III secretion system (T3SS) to
promote host colonization (3). The T3SS is a needle-like apparatus which facilitates the
translocation of effector proteins to the epithelial cells of the gut. Through the injection
of these proteins, which include the translocated intimin receptor (Tir) and the
mitochondrion-associated protein (Map), EHEC and EPEC are able to polymerize actin
filaments and form intimate junctions with epithelial cells, where several other viru-
lence factors are expressed to destabilize cellular processes (4–6). In the case of EHEC
infection, symptoms can extend beyond the intestine, as strains typically carry phage-
derived Shiga toxins (Stx) which target organs such as the kidneys and brain (7). This
often leads to the life-threatening condition HUS (1).
The T3SS of EHEC and EPEC is encoded by the highly conserved locus of enterocyte
effacement (LEE) island (8). This pathogenicity island contains 42 genes on five con-
served operons and is regulated by the master regulator, Ler. In turn, ler is regulated by
specific regulators, such as GrlA and GrlR, in addition to global regulators which
mediate LEE expression in response to environmental stimuli (9).
The reliance of EHEC and EPEC on the T3SS to initiate infection has identified it as
a target for novel therapies to fight infection. Typically, these are part of a wider
antivirulence approach in which the aim is to prevent infection by the inhibition of a
single virulence factor without inducing a reduction in growth (10). Currently, treat-
ment of EHEC infections with traditional antibiotics is not recommended due to

 stimulation of the bacterial SOS response (11). In response to DNA damage caused by
antibiotics, the SOS response protein RecA is overexpressed, which results in activation
of the Stx-encoding phage (12). Hence, Stx production is upregulated and symptom
severity increases. Additionally, the disruption to the native gut microbiome by broad-
spectrum antibiotics can have negative consequences for the patient (13). As EHEC and
EPEC infections are typically cleared naturally, antivirulence approaches to treatment of
EHEC and EPEC represent an exciting new strategy for the treatment of these infections.
In addition, compounds that do not affect bacterial growth or survival reduce the
evolutionary selective pressure on strains resistant to the treatment (10), enhancing the
long-term viability of the therapy.
Small-compound inhibitors of the EPEC and EHEC T3SS have previously been
identified (14, 15). Notably, members of the salicylidene acylhydrazide (SA) family have
been shown to inhibit T3S in a range of enteric pathogens, including EPEC, EHEC, and
Salmonella enterica (16). However, these compounds were found to bind to several
bacterial protein targets, and their mode of action has been shown to result from
synergistic effects arising from a perturbation of the function of several conserved
metabolic proteins (17). Therefore, the conclusion was that although effective, the SAs
were rather promiscuous (17).
Several antivirulence compounds are actually natural products of other bacterial
species (16). Aurodox, a specialized metabolite of Streptomyces goldiniensis, was shown
by Kimura et al. (18) to inhibit the translocation of T3SS encoded effectors in EPEC,
without affecting growth in vitro. Low concentrations (1.5 �M) were shown to inhibit
secretion, and abolition of detectable effector proteins was observed at 6 �M. More-
over, the effect of the compound in vivo was tested through the use of a Citrobacter
rodentium murine infection model in which it was shown that mice treated with the
compound survived lethal infections with limited effects on the intestinal tract. Al-
though the effects of the compound on T3S in EPEC were characterized, the wider
effects and the mechanism of action of the compound were not elucidated (18).
Therefore, there is a need to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action
of Aurodox.
Aurodox was originally discovered in 1973 as an antibiotic compound with antibac-
terial effects upon Gram-positive pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staph-
ylococcus aureus (19). Aurodox has since been well characterized in terms of its
bactericidal mechanism, with a mild effect upon E. coli growth reported using concen-
trations greater than 1 mg/ml, 200 times higher than used in T3S assays (5 �g/ml) (20).
Vogeley et al. determined the crystal structure of Aurodox bound to elongation factor
Tu (EF-Tu) of Thermus thermophilus, which confirmed their hypothesis that Aurodox
initiated a conformational change in EF-Tu which prevented it from dissociating from
the ribosome, blocking elongation activity (21). The limited spectrum of antibiotic
activity of Aurodox has resulted in its being rejected as an antibiotic to treat infections
in humans, yet the discovery of the novel T3SS inhibitory properties suggests that
Aurodox may be a candidate drug for repurposing.
In this study, we characterized the effect of Aurodox on T3S in EHEC O157:H7
(TUV93-0), EPEC O127:H6 (E2348/69), and Citrobacter rodentium (ICC168), demonstrat-
ing that the Aurodox effects are independent of growth. Furthermore, we used
transcriptomic analysis to show that Aurodox inhibits the T3SS at the level of transcrip-
tion by repression of the LEE master regulator, ler. Furthermore, we suggest a model in
which Aurodox acts upstream of Ler and not directly on the T3SS itself. Finally, we show
that Aurodox does not induce expression of RecA, which is essential for the production
of Stx. We propose that these properties make Aurodox a candidate antivirulence
therapy for the treatment of EPEC and EHEC infections.

Aurodox inhibits the translocation of T3SS-associated effector proteins with-
out affecting growth. In a previous study, Kimura et al. (18) demonstrated that

 dependent manner. We aimed to explore the effect of the compound on other
LEE-encoding pathogens, primarily EHEC (TUV93-0) and C. rodentium (ICC168), and
determine whether the mechanism of T3SS inhibition was independent of an inhibition
in growth.
Each strain was cultured in media appropriate for the expression of the T3SS (22).
Aurodox was added to the cultures at the point of inoculation at increasing concen-
trations ranging from 1.5 �g/ml to 5 �g/ml (1.2 to 6 �M), and bacteria were grown
through 4 generations to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.7 to 0.9. Supernatant
proteins were precipitated and whole-cell lysates prepared as a comparator. The
fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.
For the supernatant fractions, a concentration-dependent reduction in T3SS-
associated effector proteins was observed (Fig. 1A). The dominant bands from the gel
were excised to permit in-gel trypsin digestion and analysis by tandem mass spectrom-
etry. This confirmed that for all three pathogens, the two most dominant bands were
comprised of three well-known effector proteins: Tir, EspB, and EspD (Fig. 1A and Tables
S3 to S5 in the supplemental material). In contrast, there was no change in the profile
of the cellular proteins (Fig. 1A), indicating that the mechanism was not due to a
generic block in protein synthesis. Furthermore, these data allowed us to rule out an
effect on general secretion as EspP, which is secreted in a Sec-dependent manner, was
consistently detected in high abundance, even after Aurodox treatment (Table S4).
At the highest concentration used (5 �g/ml), Aurodox did not inhibit growth of
EPEC, EHEC, or C. rodentium (Fig. 1B). Importantly, no statistically significant decrease in
cell viability was observed (data not shown). Therefore, at the concentration of Aurodox
used, the mechanism of T3S inhibition is independent of any defect in growth or
viability. This result confirms data by Kimura et al. (18) showing no effect of Aurodox on

 growth of EPEC and extends our understanding to the related pathogens C. rodentium
and EHEC.
Aurodox inhibits the ability of EHEC to attach to and efface epithelial cells.
Previous studies using a murine infection model tested the inhibitory effects of
Aurodox on C. rodentium pathogenicity, demonstrating a marked improvement in the
survival of infected mice and a reduction in colon damage when treated with Aurodox
(18); however, the effects were not demonstrated at the cellular level.
To investigate the effects of Aurodox on the attachment of EHEC to host cells, which
is known to be driven via the T3SS, we used an in vitro infection assay. The effect of
Aurodox (5 �g/ml) on uninfected HeLa cells was tested to confirm that there was no
overt cytotoxicity of the compound (Fig. 2A). HeLa cells were infected with 107 EHEC
bacteria constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Host cell actin
cytoskeleon was stained with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 555. In addition, cell lysis was
carried out to quantify the attached bacteria as a percentage of the initial inoculum.
Epifluorescence microscopy images were used to quantify the infected cells and to
investigate any effects on cell morphology.
At a mutliplicity of infection of 150, untreated EHEC produced consistent infections,
with all HeLa cells showing adherent bacteria. The HeLa cells displayed morphological
changes associated with bacterial infection, including actin condensation caused by
lesion formation and cell rounding (Fig. 2A). Addition of Aurodox substantially reduced
both phenotypes, with only 36% of cells becoming infected and a marked reduction in
attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. Indeed, the infections by EHEC were typically
restricted to a small number of bacteria per cell (�5). Quantification of bacterial
adherence efficiency by CFU counts showed a �3-log reduction in EHEC colonisation
when treated with Aurodox (Fig. 2C), demonstrating the potent antivirulence capacity
of Aurodox.
Aurodox inhibits expression of multiple virulence genes, including the LEE. To
gain insights into the possible molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of the
T3SS, we used whole-transcriptome analysis. EHEC was grown in minimal essential
medium (MEM)-HEPES with or without 5 mg/ml of Aurodox, and RNA was extracted
from triplicate cultures. Transcripts were mapped to the EHEC EDL933 reference
genome, and the mean fold change was calculated. In total, 84 chromosomal genes
and 4 pO157 genes were significantly downregulated (using a fold change of �1.5 and
an EDGE test P value of �0.05) (Fig. 3A and Table S6). Consistent with the secretion
data, analysis of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) transcription revealed downregu-

 lation of the island after treatment with Aurodox (Fig. 3B), with 25 of the 41 LEE genes
significantly downregulated, including the master regulators ler and grlA (9) (Fig. 3A
and B). Aurodox also repressed expression of genes encoding non-LEE-encoded effec-
tor proteins secreted by the T3SS, such as NleB and EspG. Moreover, there was no
significant downregulation of genes encoding T3SS-independent effector proteins,
such as EspP.
The data also revealed that many genes in the colanic acid biosynthesis operon were
downregulated in the presence of Aurodox. Our initial results show that 20 of the 21
genes in this operon are downregulated in response to Aurodox, with 15 of the 20
genes showing significant changes (P � 0.05) (Table S6). Notably, expression of rcsA, a
key regulator of colanic acid biosynthesis that is known to form part of the Ler-
dependent regulon (23), was downregulated 2.5-fold. These data suggest that suppres-
sion of the colanic acid operon is likely due to expression changes in the key regulators
RcsA and Ler. These changes could indicate further potential of Aurodox for the
treatment of EHEC infections, as colanic acid production is required in vivo during
infection (24).

 In addition, 103 genes were upregulated in the presence of Aurodox, which include
various metabolic genes (prpR, trpA, and trpB), and genes encoding sensory proteins
(e.g., narQ). Importantly, there was no upregulation of SOS response-associated genes
or virulence genes. The most upregulated gene was ecpD, encoding a putative fimbrial
chaperone protein, with a log2 fold change of 5.
Aurodox inhibits T3SS expression through downregulation of the master reg-
ulator Ler. To confirm the virulence-related Aurodox targets identified by RNA se-
quencing (RNA-seq), we used GFP gene reporter assays to validate observed changes
in gene expression. GFP reporter plasmids for ler and the housekeeping gene rpsM were
introduced into strains, and fluorescence was measured during exponential phase. This
showed that in EHEC expression of ler was significantly reduced in the presence of
Aurodox (Fig. 3C). There was no significant change in expression of the housekeeping
gene rpsM (Fig. 3C), consistent with the RNA-seq data. A reduction in ler expression was
also observed for EPEC (Fig. S1), implying a common mechanism by which Aurodox
causes a reduction of T3SS expression.
Overexpression of Ler overrides EHEC inhibition of the T3SS by Aurodox.
Inhibition of the T3SS by Aurodox could be explained by a number of mechanisms.
These include (i) directly inhibiting Ler expression or function, (ii) binding to a com-
ponent of the T3SS resulting in negative feedback of ler, or (iii) affecting an upstream
regulator of ler. To test if expression of structural components of the T3SS affected
expression of Ler, we used a series of EPEC deletion mutants in various apparatus
proteins. The rationale was that if a structural component was a target of Aurodox,
then this would have to result in downregulation of ler and therefore the other
genes in the T3SS and the wider Ler regulon. However, analysis of four structural
components of the T3SS apparatus proteins showed that there was no effect on ler
transcription when assayed using a GFP reporter (Fig. 4A). Moreover, addition of
Aurodox resulted in reduced expression of ler in both wild-type (WT) EHEC and an
escC deletion mutant (Fig. 4B). These data show that there is no apparent feedback
from structural components on the expression of the master regulator of the T3SS
itself and that Aurodox results in downregulation of ler, irrespective whether the
T3SS is fully assembled.
We then questioned if a regulator upstream or downstream of Ler was the target.
To address this, EHEC was transformed with the pVS45 plasmid carrying ler under
transcriptional control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (25). By selectively overpro-
ducing Ler we could test the sensitivity of EHEC to Aurodox-mediated T3SS inhibition.

 The transformed strain was grown in media to induce LEE expression both in the
presence and absence of 5 �g/ml of Aurodox and 2% arabinose to induce expression
of Ler. The fractions were analyzed using immunoblotting with antibodies against the
T3SS protein Tir. In the absence of arabinose (uninduced Ler), the addition of Aurodox
results in T3SS inhibition as seen in previous experiments (Fig. 4C). However, overex-
pression of Ler by addition of arabinose completely overcame the phenotype of
T3SS-mediated repression normally associated with addition of Aurodox (Fig. 4C). This
result indicates that Aurodox acts either by directly acting on Ler or by a mechanism
involving an upstream regulator of Ler.
Aurodox does not induce the SOS response in EHEC. Antimicrobial compounds
that induce DNA damage are known to stimulate the bacterial SOS response. A key
protein in this regulon is RecA, a coprotease that functions in the autocatalytic cleavage
of the LexA and the � repressors, resulting in derepression of approximately 40
genes involved in the SOS response and, importantly, an increased expression of
bacteriophage-encoded Stx (26). As a potential treatment for EHEC infection, we
therefore aimed to investigate if Aurodox had any undesirable effects on Stx expres-
sion. RNA-seq data did not reveal differential expression of SOS regulated genes (as
defined by Fernández et al. [27]) in response to Aurodox. To validate this, EHEC was
transformed with a plasmid containing a recA-gfp fusion and gene expression was
measured over a time course (Fig. 5). Ciprofloxacin was used a positive control of RecA
expression and provided log-fold stimulation compared with the uninduced control
(Fig. 5). In contrast, the data show that Aurodox does not induce recA transcription in
EHEC at the 4- and 8-h time points (Fig. 5). The data imply that addition of Aurodox
does not induce the SOS response and therefore, by implication, Stx expression,
enhancing the potential of the compound to be used as a treatment for EHEC
infections.
To test this hypothesis, we directly examined the effect of Aurodox on Stx expres-
sion in vitro. To test this, Citrobacter rodentium DBS100 was used. This strain has been
lysogenized by an Stx2dact-producing phage and produces functional Stx. This strain
was cultured in the presence of Aurodox, ciprofloxacin, and both Aurodox and cipro-
floxacin. The secreted proteins were harvested and probed using an antibody for the
beta subunit of the Shiga toxin (Fig. 5B). The resulting bands showed that Aurodox
does not induce the expression of Stx, in contrast to Ciprofloxacin. These findings
therefore enhance the potential of the compound to be used as a treatment for EHEC
infections.

 DISCUSSION
The central role of T3SSs in the pathogenesis of many bacterial species provides the
impetus to develop strategies that interfere with their function. To this end, “virulence
blockers” have been described that selectively target the expression or function of
T3SSs in a number of bacterial species, including Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Chlamydia pneumoniae (28, 29). While screening
programs can readily find compounds that inhibit the T3SS, identifying inhibitors that
work both in vitro and in vivo with high selectivity has proven challenging. Therefore,
the discovery by Kimura et al. (18) that Aurodox could protect mice from a lethal
infection with C. rodentium was an important one.
In this study, we attempted to address three questions. First, can Aurodox block the
function of the T3SS in EHEC O157:H7, as well as EPEC and C. rodentium? This is
important to address because there are very limited treatment options for EHEC
infections due to complications associated with Shiga toxin expression. Second, are
there inhibitor-specific transcriptional responses that may help us understand the
mode of action? Third, does Aurodox alter the bacterial the SOS response affecting
expression of bacteriophage-encoded Stx?
In agreement with Kimura et al. (18), we observed that Aurodox resulted in a
concentration-dependent inhibition of T3S in EPEC and C. rodentium. The same result
was found in EHEC, a result that shows a likely common mechanism of inhibition.
Importantly, at the concentrations used, there were no effects on bacterial growth rate
or viability in any of the species tested. This finding suggests that the mechanism by
which Aurodox inhibits the T3SS is distinct from the reported target of bactericidal
activity, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) (21), a vital component of the protein biosynthesis
machinery. It is notable that Aurodox is an extremely poor antibiotic against E. coli, with
previous work showing limited inhibition zones at 1 mg/ml, some 200� the concen-
trations used to inhibit the T3SS (19). Furthermore, the distinct natures of the mecha-
nisms of T3S inhibition and bactericidal activity have positive implications for resis-
tance. Although resistance to Aurodox as an antibiotic may arise through mutations in
EF-Tu, these mutations would not confer resistance to Aurodox as an inhibitor of the
T3SS or restore virulence. Although it is possible mutations in ler or its regulators may
result in resistance to Aurodox as a T3S inhibitor, these would not be strongly selected
for in the same way as conventional antibiotics.
Our transcriptomic data provide the first insight into how Aurodox affects global
gene expression. Remarkably, only 3.24% of the genome showed a significant up- or
downshift in transcription. This shows excellent specificity and selectivity of inhibition,
both very desirable qualities for an antivirulence compound (10). Perhaps predictably,
much of the LEE was seen to be downregulated, including transcription of the master
regulators ler and grlA (9). Further, many of the genes affected were part of the Ler
regulon, suggesting a mode of action centered around this protein. Critically, overex-
pression of Ler by an inducible expression system, completely overrides the effects of
Aurodox on secretion of Tir via the T3SS. Our data also confirm that deletion of
components of the T3SS system, such as structural proteins, does not lead to transcrip-
tional feedback on LEE1. In conjunction with the transcriptomics data, our working
model is that Aurodox binds a target that affects transcription of ler. The complexity
and high molecular weight of Aurodox suggest that the compound may have the
ability to compromise the integrity of the outer membrane on cell entry and hence
activate the membrane stress response sigma factor, RpoE. Increased expression of this
sigma factor has been reported to reduce T3S via downregulation of ler, particularly in
the presence of zinc (30). However, our transcriptomal analysis has shown a 1.54-fold
downregulation of the sigma factor, and therefore, we believe that this pathway is
unlinked. Elucidating specific targets for antivirulence compounds is often challenging
(31), and proving a specific target for Aurodox would be problematic because it is a
complex natural product, making labeling or modification extremely difficult.
We have also demonstrated, for the first time, that Aurodox does not stimulate

 expression of RecA, a key protein that helps mediate the SOS response in E. coli (32).
The SOS response is known to be a key regulator of lambdoid bacteriophage transcrip-
tion by stimulating autocleavage of the phage repressor, cI, in response to DNA
damage, triggering a cascade that leads to transcription of the Q antiterminator
transcript and the lytic cycle (33). As both the stxA and stxB genes in EHEC strains
are located on the genomes of resident prophages (34), it is not surprising that they are
upregulated by the SOS response, which can induced by treatments that damage
bacterial DNA, including UV light, selected antibiotics, and mitomycin C. This response
to traditional broad-spectrum antibiotics has made treatment of EHEC problematic and
highlights an important advantage of Aurodox: it can suppress virulence without the
“sting in the tail” associated with Shiga toxin expression and damage.
A further interesting aspect of Aurodox biology would be to explore any wider
effects on the microbiota. The gut microbiota has long been recognized to contribute
to health and disease by influencing gut maturation, host nutrition, and pathogen
resistance (35). Moreover, the density and diversity of the gut microbiota offers ample
opportunities for the horizontal transfer of genetic material, including antibiotic resis-
tance genes. Therefore, it would be important to understand if Aurodox was indeed
highly targeted toward a small subset of pathogens or if it had any undesirable effects
on the wider gut microbiota, which could be monitored using methods such as
metagenomics. Overall, our work shows that Aurodox works in a highly targeted
manner that supports its strong consideration for repurposing as treatment against
EHEC infection in humans.

Louis, MO) with 5.62 g/liter of L-glutamine and EPEC was grown in Glutamax-Dulbecco modified Eagle
medium (DMEM) (Sigma) at 37°
C at 180 rpm. C. rodentium was also grown in Glutamax-DMEM (Sigma)
and was cultured statically at 37°
C with 5% CO2. Growth and cell viability assays were carried out in
lysogeny broth. For selection of plasmids, chloramphenicol or ampicillin was included at 20 or 50 �g/ml,
respectively.
Acquisition and storage of Aurodox. Aurodox was purchased in its pure form (Enzo Life Sciences,
Farmingdale, NY). A 1-mg/ml stock solution was prepared by dissolving the compound in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). The overall concentration of DMSO was �0.5% in all experiments. We also purified
Aurodox directly from S. goldiniensis according to the method of Berger et al. (19) and found the same
effects. However, for consistency we used commercially available Aurodox.
Analysis of secreted proteins. Overnight cultures were used to inoculate each strain into the
appropriate prewarmed medium to an initial OD600 of 0.05. The strains were grown with increasing
concentrations of Aurodox to an OD600 of 0.7 to 0.9 before being centrifuged at 3,800 rpm for 10 min to
separate the cell mass. Cell lysates were prepared using BugBuster protein extraction buffer (Merck, NJ).
The supernatant was removed, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to
a concentration of 10% and incubated overnight at 4°
C. The suspension was centrifuged at 3,800 � g for
1 h to form a protein pellet which was suspended in 100 �l of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The samples were then
mixed 1:1 with loading dye (Novex, Waltham, MA) and run on a 4 to 12% SDS-PAGE gel at 120 V for 1
h. Gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie brilliant blue stain (Novex) and destained in water
overnight. When required, bands were excised for subsequent in-gel digestion and analysis. Proteins
analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry were given a MASCOT score to indicate the probability of the
identification being correct.
Analysis of the effect of Aurodox on in vitro growth and cell viability. Overnight cultures of EHEC
(TUV93-0), EPEC (E2348/69), and C. rodentium (ICC186) were used to inoculate 200-ml Erlenmeyer flasks
containing 50 ml of LB broth with or without 5 �g/ml of Aurodox to an initial OD600 of 0.05. This was
carried out in triplicate. At each time point, 100 �l of culture was removed and diluted 1/10 in LB
medium, and the OD600 was measured by spectrophotometry. The standard error mean of optical
densities was calculated, and a standard curve was plotted using GraphPad Prism. The lines were fitted
according to Weilbul formula and error bars were plotted as standard deviations from the means. P
values were determined using an unpaired t test. For cell viability assays, each strain was grown to and
OD600 of 3.0 both with and without Aurodox, and CFU were determined through the serial dilution
method.
Infection of HeLa epithelial cells with EHEC O157:H7. A 24-well tissue culture plate containing
coverslips was seeded with 107 HeLa cells in MEM-HEPES containing 5.62 g/liter of L-glutamine and 10%
fetal calf serum. These were left to grow overnight. In parallel, two cultures of TUV93-0 prpsM-gfp (with
or without 5 �g/ml of Aurodox) were grown in 5-ml volumes under T3SS-inducing conditions until an
OD600 of 0.6 was reached. The HeLa cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before

 500 �l of fresh MEM-HEPES (with or without 5 �g/ml of Aurodox) was added, in addition to 15 �l of
bacterial culture. The plate was then centrifuged at 250 � g for 3 min and was left to incubate initially
for 1 h. Serial dilutions of the inoculum were carried out and spotted onto LB agar to determine the CFU
(as described above). After the initial hour, cells were washed three times with sterile PBS, and 600 �l of
fresh MEM-HEPES with or without 5 �g/ml of Aurodox was added before incubation for a further 3 h. To
quantify the adherent EHEC bacteria on treated and untreated cells, the cells were washed four times
with sterile PBS and lysed through the addition of 1% Triton in PBS and incubation at room temperature
for 10 min. Serial dilutions were spotted onto LB agar to determine the adherent CFU. Colonization
efficiency was calculated as a percentage of the initial inoculum. To visualize the infections using
wide-field epifluorescent microscopy, cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min
at room temperature) before permeabilization with 0.1% Triton in PBS (5 min at room temperature) and
staining with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher; 1 in 500 dilution and 1 h at room temperature).
Cells were mounted using Vectashield with 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and sealed with clear
nail polish. Images were acquired at a magnification of �400 on a Zeiss Axioimager M1. For represen-
tative images, 11 z-slices of 0.55 �m were acquired before deconvolution using default settings in Zeiss
Zen Pro software. Host cells were classified as infected if any bacteria were seen to be associated with
them.
mRNA extraction. EHEC (TUV93-0) was cultured as described above in triplicate, both with and
without 5 �g/ml of Aurodox. The cultures were mixed with 2 volumes of RNAprotect reagent (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) at room temperature before being centrifuged at 3,800 � g to harvest a cell pellet. RNeasy
kit (Qiagen) was used to extract total RNA before TURBO DNase (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) was used to
remove genomic DNA. Furthermore, a MICROBExpress mRNA enrichment kit (Ambion) was used to
enrich samples for mRNA. The quality of the mRNA was determined using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer
at the University of Glasgow Polyomics Facility.
Transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. cDNA synthesis and sequencing were performed
at the University of Glasgow Polyomics Facility (Illumina NextSeq 500), obtaining 75- or 100-bp single-
end reads. Treated and untreated samples were sequenced in triplicate. FastQC (Babraham Bioinformat-
ics, Cambridge, UK) was used to for quality control. Reads were trimmed accordingly using CLC Genomics
Workbench (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Trimmed reads were mapped to the EDL933 reference genome
(NCBI accession number NC_002655.2), allowing for 3 mismatches per read and at least 5 reads per
feature. Analysis of differential expression was performed using the Empirical analysis of DGE tool, which
implements the EdgeR Bioconductor tool. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a positive
or negative absolute fold change of �1.5 and a corrected P value of �0.05 (false-discovery rate of 5%).
Gene Ontology functional grouping was summarized according to information available on Colibase and
the RegulonDB. Figures were generated using GraphPad Prism and Microsoft Excel.
In vitro GFP fusion reporter assays. Electrocompetent EHEC, EPEC, and C. rodentium cells were
transformed with the promoter-gfp reporter plasmids listed in Table S2. The transformants were
inoculated in to 10 ml of the appropriate medium and cultured as previously stated. Samples
were removed at the desired time points to take measurements of the OD600. To determine the overall
fluorescence, 200 �l of culture was transferred into a black 96-well plate and fluorescence was read with
excitation of 485 nm and emission at 550 nm, using the FLUOstar Optima fluorescence plate reader
system (BMG Labtech, UK). This was carried out in triplicate. To determine the normalized fluorescence
value, the background fluorescence intensity from untransformed cells was first subtracted and the
subsequent values were normalized by dividing fluorescence by OD600. The data are the means for the
three samples, and error bars represent the standard deviations.
Overexpression of ler. Electrocompetent EHEC cells were transformed with pVS45 plasmid contain-
ing the ler gene under the control of an arabinose-induced promoter and grown on 50 �g/ml of
ampicillin. A transformant colony was then used to prepare an overnight culture, which was subse-
quently inoculated into T3SS-inducing conditions as described above. At an OD600 of 0.2, 2% arabinose
was added. The supernatant protein fractions were then precipitated and analyzed using SDS-PAGE as
previously explained. Proteins for Western blot analysis were run on a 4 to 12% bis-Tris gel and
transferred to an Amersham ECL nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) using the Nupage
Novex gel transfer system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Blocking was then carried out using 5% skimmed
milk powder in PBS-Tween (PBST). The membrane was then incubated with the anti-Tir primary antibody
overnight in 1% milk powder–PBST buffer at a 1:1,000 dilution. Antibodies for GroEL (Abcam) were used
as a control for bacterial cell lysis at the same dilution. The following morning, the membrane was
washed three times with PBST for 10 min before being incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:2,000 dilution in 1% milk in PBST. The membrane
was again washed three times with PBST. Finally, the membrane was developed with SuperSignal West
Pico chemiluminescent ECL (Thermo Fisher) substrate for 5 min before being transferred to a dark room
in a cassette and exposed to X-ray film for 30 s.
Detection of Shiga toxin expression in C. rodentium DBS100 by Western blotting. C. rodentium
DBS100 containing the Stx phage was cultured in 2 ml of DMEM at 37°
C and 200 rpm until an OD600 of
0.6 was reached. The whole-cell fraction was removed from by centrifugation at 3,800 � g for 10 min.
Secreted proteins were harvested as previously described. Proteins for Western blot analysis were run on
a 4 to 12% bis-Tris gel and transferred to an Amersham ECL polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane
(GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) using the Nupage Novex gel transfer system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). No
blocking was carried out. The membrane was incubated with anti-Stx (beta subunit) antibody (1/1,000
concentration) overnight at 4°
C and washed three times with PBST. The membrane was incubated for 1
h with anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:2,000 dilution in 1% milk in PBST and
