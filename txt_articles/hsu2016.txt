ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Oral anticoagulation (OAC), rather than aspirin, is recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)
at moderate to high risk of stroke.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to examine patient and practice-level factors associated with prescription of aspirin
alone compared with OAC in AF patients at intermediate to high stroke risk in real-world cardiology practices.
METHODS The authors identified 2 cohorts of outpatients with AF and intermediate to high thromboembolic risk
(CHADS2 score $2 and CHA2DS2-VASc $2) enrolled in the American College of Cardiology PINNACLE (Practice Innovation
and Clinical Excellence) registry between 2008 and 2012. Using hierarchical modified Poisson regression models adjusted
for patient and practice characteristics, the authors examined the prevalence and predictors of aspirin alone versus OAC
prescription in AF patients at risk for stroke.
RESULTS Of 210,380 identified patients with CHADS2 score $2 on antithrombotic therapy, 80,371 (38.2%) were
treated with aspirin alone, and 130,009 (61.8%) were treated with warfarin or non-vitamin K antagonist OACs. In the
cohort of 294,642 patients with CHA2DS2-VASc $2, 118,398 (40.2%) were treated with aspirin alone, and 176,244
(59.8%) were treated with warfarin or non-vitamin K antagonist OACs. After multivariable adjustment, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, unstable and stable angina, recent coronary artery
bypass graft, and peripheral arterial disease were associated with prescription of aspirin only, whereas male sex, higher
body mass index, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, prior systemic embolism, and congestive heart failure were
associated with more frequent prescription of OAC.
CONCLUSIONS In a large, real-world cardiac outpatient population of AF patients with a moderate to high risk of
stroke, more than 1 in 3 were treated with aspirin alone without OAC. Specific patient characteristics predicted
prescription of aspirin therapy over OAC. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2016;67:2913–23) © 2016 by the American College of

 A
trial
fibrillation (AF)
is
the
most
common cardiac arrhythmia world-
wide and imparts significant stroke
risk (1). Risk stratification schemes, including
the CHADS2 score (2) and the more recent
CHA2DS2-VASc score (3), have been devel-
oped to estimate the risk of thromboembo-
lism in AF patients on the basis of specific
risk factors (2,3). In patients with AF deter-
mined to be at intermediate to high risk for
thromboembolism,
anticoagulation
with
warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) or the
newer non-vitamin K antagonist oral antico-
agulant agents (OACs) reduces morbidity and mor-
tality (4,5). Previous studies have demonstrated that
aspirin therapy is not as beneficial as OAC for reduc-
tion of thromboembolism (6), yet it is well known
that appropriate OAC prescription in AF patients at
risk for stroke outside clinical trial settings falls short
of guideline-based expectations (7). The extent to
which AF patients at risk for stroke are prescribed
only aspirin and the factors that determine such a
practice are not well known. Additionally, the preva-
lence of concomitant antiplatelet agent prescription
in contemporary patients with AF who are and are
not prescribed OAC has not been well studied.
We sought to investigate the prevalence and pre-
dictors of treatment with aspirin only compared with
OAC therapy by cardiovascular specialists in a cohort
of outpatients with AF at a moderate to high risk for
thromboembolism using data from the National Car-
diovascular Data Registry (NCDR)’s Practice Innova-
tion and Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE). Use of this
prospective national registry of cardiovascular care in
the United States provides a unique opportunity to
examine patterns of both aspirin and OAC prescrip-
tion in routine practice among outpatients with AF, as
well as the use of other antiplatelet agents (i.e.,
thienopyridine prescription).
METHODS
DATA SOURCE. The NCDR PINNACLE registry was
created in 2008 by the American College of Cardiol-
ogy as the first national, prospective, office-based
cardiac quality-improvement registry in the United
States
(8).
Participating
academic
and
private
practices collect longitudinal, point-of-care data that
includes patient demographics, symptoms, comor-
bidities, vital signs, medications, laboratory values,
and recent hospitalizations with either paper forms,
or modification of a practice’s electronic medical re-
cord using a standardized collection tool to compre-
hensively obtain and transmit uniform data. NCDR
registry data quality assurance is maintained through
standardized data collection and transmission pro-
tocols, rigorous data definitions, and periodic data
quality audits, which have shown much >90% raw
accuracy of data abstraction (9). Quality checks and
analyses of the data have been performed at St.
Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute (Kansas City,
Missouri),
the
primary
analytical
center
for
the
PINNACLE registry.
STUDY POPULATION. There were a total of 1,147,227
patients enrolled into the PINNACLE registry between
January 1, 2008, and December 30, 2012. We excluded
patients without AF (n ¼ 689,722 excluded), patients
deemed not able to be prescribed aspirin or OAC
therapy (n ¼ 17,627 excluded), as assessed by the
treating clinician and specified on data collection
forms (due to medical, patient, or system reason), and
those not prescribed any antithrombotic therapy at all
(n ¼ 112,222 excluded). We further restricted the
cohort to patients known to be at moderate to high
risk for thromboembolism (CHADS2 score $2, with
1 point for congestive heart failure, hypertension,
age $75 years, and diabetes, and 2 points for stroke/

 Cardiology/American
Heart
Association/European
Society of Cardiology guidelines in place during the
study timeframe, which defined as a Class I indication
(i.e., recommendation that the treatment is useful/
effective) the use of OAC instead of aspirin alone for
the primary prevention of stroke in at-risk AF pa-
tients with a CHADS2 score $2 (10). Therefore, our
final primary study cohort was composed of 210,380
patients with AF from 123 practices in 38 states across
the United States (Figure 1). Of the 123 practices
included in the PINNACLE registry, 97 (78.9%) prac-
tices were located in an urban/suburban setting.
The
regional
breakdown
of
practice
locations
included the following: 27 (22%) in the West; 17
(13.8%) in the Northeast; 33 (26.8%) in the Midwest;
and 46 (37.4%) in the South. We also conducted a
secondary analysis, using the CHA2DS2-VASc score, a
more sensitive tool to risk-stratify AF patients who
may be at risk for stroke and benefit from anticoag-
ulant therapy (3); use of this risk score may have
influenced cardiovascular specialist prescription of
OAC during the study timeframe, as reflected in
updated European Society of Cardiology guidelines
from 2012 (11) and subsequently published updated
guidelines after the study timeframe (12). These
updated guidelines, published in 2014, advise the use
of the CHA2DS2-VASc score for the assessment of
stroke risk, and state as a Class I recommendation the
use of OAC therapy for patients with nonvalvular AF
and a CHA2DS2-VASc score $2 (12). In addition to
carrying over all of the same exclusion criteria listed
previously, this cohort was restricted to AF patients
with a CHA2DS2-VASc score $2, with 1 point for
congestive heart failure, hypertension, age $65 years
[2 points if age $75 years], diabetes, female sex, and
coronary or peripheral arterial disease, and 2 points
for
stroke/TIA.
Selection
of
this
CHA2DS2-VASc
score $2 cohort led to inclusion of an additional
84,262 patients, for a total cohort of 294,642 patients.
Because antiplatelet therapy may be indicated for
reasons other than AF among those with cardiovas-
cular disease, we also stratified analyses in both the
CHADS2 score $2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score $2 cohorts
by those patients with and without a coronary heart
disease risk equivalent condition, which was consid-
ered a diagnosis of any of the following: coronary

myocardial infarction; prior coronary artery bypass
graft (CABG) surgery; or peripheral arterial disease.
To minimize over-representation by patients with
multiple visits, only data from each patient’s index
visit during the study period were used. The index
visit was considered the first encounter where a
diagnosis
of
AF
was
specified.
To
ensure
that
misclassification of OAC prescription was not over-
looked by examining only the index visit, we per-
formed
a
sensitivity
analysis
to
determine
the
number of patients that would be reclassified as being
prescribed an OAC by increasing the window from
baseline to within 1 year following the index visit.
STUDY OUTCOMES. Our primary study outcome was
treatment with aspirin therapy (alone or in combina-
tion with another antiplatelet agent) versus any U.S.
Food and Drug Administration–approved OAC for
stroke prevention in patients with AF, which included
warfarin, dabigatran or rivaroxaban (apixaban and
edoxaban had not yet been approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration during the study timeframe).
Aspirin therapy was defined as prescription of aspirin,
either alone or in combination with clopidogrel,
ticlopidine,
prasugrel,
and/or
dipyridamole.
Fre-
quencies of OAC prescription with aspirin and/or other
antiplatelet agents (i.e., thienopyridine or dipyr-
idamole), as well as aspirin plus antiplatelet agent
prescription were analyzed. Treatment with a thie-
nopyridine was defined as prescription of clopidogrel,
ticlopidine,
or
prasugrel.
Patients
treated
with
aspirin/dipyridamole combination only were included
in the aspirin group.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Normally distributed contin-
uous variables are expressed as mean � SD, whereas
categorical variables are expressed as proportions.
Unadjusted differences were compared using the
chi-square test for categorical variables, and Student t
tests for continuous variables, as appropriate.
To investigate the independent associations of
various characteristics with the outcome of aspirin
alone versus OAC prescription, we constructed hier-
archical modified Poisson regression models adjusted
for patient and practice-level characteristics. These
models included site as a random effect to account for
patient clustering within sites. All covariates consid-
ered to be potential predictors were entered in the
multivariable
model
and
included
patient-level
characteristics (age, body mass index [BMI], sex,
congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, stroke or
TIA, systemic embolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
coronary
artery
disease,
unstable
angina,
stable
angina,
prior
myocardial
infarction,
prior
CABG
surgery, and peripheral arterial disease) and practice-
level characteristics (U.S. geographical region, urban
location, and clinic volume). Candidate covariates
selected for the multivariate analyses were chosen a
priori on the basis of plausibility that they could be
associated with differential prescription of aspirin
alone versus OAC. Additional analyses adjusted for
any thienopyridine use were performed to evaluate
associations of these predictors with prescription of
aspirin alone versus OAC, independent of the need
for thienopyridine prescription. The highest missing
rate for variables was BMI (28.7%); therefore, a
missing indicator was included in models that con-
tained this variable. Additionally, missing data were
assumed to be missing at random and were imputed
with 10 imputation sets, in which all patient variables
were used to inform the imputation model (13).
Because the rate of OAC prescription exceeded 10%,
we used modified Poisson regression models at all
steps to estimate relative prescription rates with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) directly (instead of odds
ratios obtained from logistic regression, which may
overestimate effect differences) (14). Statistical tests
were 2-sided and considered significant if they yiel-
ded a p value <0.05. Analyses were performed using
the SAS statistical package, version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina), R version 2.15.3 (Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and IVE-
Ware (Institute for Social Research, University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan).
RESULTS
Among the 210,380 patients with a CHADS2 score $2,
there were 80,371 (38.2%) treated with aspirin alone
and 130,009 (61.8%) treated with warfarin or non-
vitamin K antagonist OACs. Of the 294,642 patients
with CHA2DS2-VASc $2, 118,398 (40.2%) were treated
with aspirin alone, and 176,244 (59.8%) were treated
with warfarin or non-vitamin K antagonist OACs.
Patient and practice characteristics among treated
AF patients in each cohort stratified by prescription of
aspirin alone versus OAC are shown in Table 1. In both
the CHADS2 score $2 cohort and the CHA2DS2-VASc
score $2 cohort, AF patients prescribed aspirin alone
instead of OAC were younger, had lower BMI, were
more often female, and were more likely to have
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, coro-
nary artery disease, unstable angina, stable angina,
prior myocardial infarction, prior CABG surgery, and
peripheral artery disease. Compared with those who
were prescribed OAC, patients in both cohorts who
were
prescribed
aspirin
alone
were
more
often
treated in the South and West, in nonurban practices,

 and at practices with a higher volume of patients.
Patients with AF treated with aspirin or OAC therapy
differed from patients with AF excluded from the
analyses with respect to several baseline character-
istics (Online Table 1).
In the CHADS2 score $2 cohort, the mean CHADS2
score was 2.8 � 1.0. Of the 130,009 patients (61.8%)
who were treated with OACs, warfarin was the most
commonly used therapy (n ¼ 118,178 [90.9%]), fol-
lowed by dabigatran (n ¼ 9,363 [7.2%]) and rivarox-
aban
(n
¼
2,468
[1.9%]).
In
the
CHA2DS2-VASc
score $2 cohort, the mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was
2.2 � 1.2. Similarly, of the 176,244 patients (59.8%)
who were treated with OACs, warfarin was the most
commonly used therapy (n ¼ 159,668 [90.6%]), fol-
lowed by dabigatran (n ¼ 13,122 [7.4%]), and rivar-
oxaban (n ¼ 3,454 [2.0%]). In a sensitivity analysis
evaluating reclassification of patients prescribed an
OAC within 1 year of the index visit, a small propor-
tion of patients (1.9%, n ¼ 2,507 of 135,056) not
prescribed an anticoagulant agent at baseline were
prescribed OAC in follow-up. Evaluation of practice-
level variation of OAC prescription revealed that the
median practice rate for OAC prescription in the
CHADS2 score $2 cohort was 64.9%, with a significant
variation
in
OAC
prescription,
as
evidenced
by
an interquartile range of 56.4% to 69.9%. The median
practice rate for OAC prescription in the CHA2DS2-
VASc score $2 cohort was 63.3%, with variation
represented by an interquartile range of 55.2% to
68.7% (Figures 2A and 2B).
In both the CHADS2 score $2 cohort and the
CHA2DS2-VASc score $2 cohort, concomitant use of
any thienopyridine (mainly clopidogrel) was higher
in those patients prescribed aspirin. Concomitant
prescription of aspirin alone as well as aspirin þ
thienopyridine was not uncommon in patients who
were prescribed an OAC (Table 2). Combination dual
antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and any thienopyr-
idine was much less common in patients prescribed
OAC than aspirin, in the range of 5.7% to 6.0% in both
the CHADS2 score $2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score $2
cohorts. Among patients treated with OAC, concom-
itant antiplatelet therapy was more often prescribed
in patients prescribed a non-vitamin K antagonist
OAC compared with warfarin (Online Table 2).

Aspirin Use in Anticoagulation-Eligible AF Patients
2917
 The majority of patients in both the CHADS2
score $2 cohort (n ¼ 127,188 [60.5%]) and CHA2DS2-
VASc score $2 cohort (n ¼ 171,401 [58.2%]) had a
coronary heart disease equivalent condition. In both
the CHADS2 score $2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score $2
cohorts, when stratified by the presence of a coronary
heart disease risk equivalent diagnosis, aspirin use
was more common in patients prescribed OAC, but
did not top 55.2%. Even in patients without a coro-
nary heart disease risk equivalent diagnosis, aspirin
use was as high as 31.2% in patients also prescribed an
OAC. Thienopyridine use was mostly reserved for
patients with a coronary heart disease risk equivalent
diagnosis (Table 2).
After
multivariable
adjustment,
hypertension,
dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, prior myocar-
dial infarction, unstable and stable angina, recent
CABG, and peripheral arterial disease were associated
with more frequent prescription of aspirin only,
whereas male sex, higher BMI, prior stroke/TIA, prior
systemic embolism, and congestive heart failure were
associated with more frequent prescription of OAC in
both
the
CHADS2
score
$2
and
CHA2DS2-VASc
score $2 cohorts (Central Illustration). The associa-
tions
of
all
covariates
included
in
the
adjusted
multivariable models evaluating predictors of aspirin
versus OAC prescription are summarized in Online
Table 3. In subanalyses including any thienopyr-
idine use in the multivariable model, thienopyridine
prescription was associated with more frequent pre-
scription of aspirin compared with OAC in both the
CHADS2 score $2 (relative prescription rate: 1.61; 95%
CI: 1.58 to 1.61; p < 0.001) and CHA2DS2-VASc score $2
cohorts (relative prescription rate: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.52
to 1.57; p < 0.001) (Online Figure 1).

Despite a well-established association of AF with
stroke, significant lack of OAC prescription to reduce
thromboembolism in at-risk candidates has been
demonstrated in several large-scale studies, with
aspirin prescription prevalence as high as 28% to 38%
in patients who were prescribed an antithrombotic
agent at all (15,16). These previous studies described
primarily U.S. patients in the era of warfarin therapy,
and were before the promulgation of the importance
of stroke risk scores to aid in risk stratification. Clin-
ical risk scores, including the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-
VASc scores, have been developed to elucidate and
quantify stroke risk in AF patients to aid in the deci-
sion to prescribe antithrombotic therapies (2,3). In
our study, we used the CHADS2 score, because this
risk scheme was the predominant scoring system
contemporary with the study period. In order to
expand upon the robustness of our findings, we also
studied the same cohort of AF patients as assessed by
the CHA2DS2-VASc score, because this risk scheme
may improve discrimination of AF patients at risk for
stroke and thromboembolism and is supported by
updated guidelines published near the end of and
after the study timeframe (11,12). In the GARFIELD
registry (Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD),
a multinational, observational study of 10,614 AF
patients enrolled between 2009 and 2011 at 540 sites
in 19 non-U.S. countries and cared for by general
practitioners, cardiologists, and neurologists, 25.3%
of patients with a CHADS2 score $2 were prescribed
aspirin instead of OAC, but the study did not evaluate
predictors of aspirin prescription (17). Because 38.2%
of AF patients with a CHADS2 score $2 were pre-
scribed aspirin alone in our study, there is clearly a
continued lack of a guideline-adhering prescription
of OAC in U.S. cardiovascular specialist practices. The
assertion that aspirin does not adequately protect
against thromboembolism in AF patients has been
extensively studied, highlighted by a meta-analysis
of 4,052 patients with AF who experienced nearly

 one-half the stroke risk when treated with warfarin
rather than aspirin (hazard ratio: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.43 to
0.71) (18). Although inadequate knowledge regarding
these data may explain the guideline nonadherence
among
cardiology
specialists,
other
reasons,
including justifiable clinical circumstances, concerns
for bleeding in specific patients, or patient refusal of
this therapy, may be responsible.
Patients with risk factors for coronary athero-
sclerosis and myocardial infarction are often treated
with aspirin as primary prevention therapy, and
those with previous acute coronary syndrome are
treated with aspirin as secondary prevention ther-
apy, as per clinical guidelines (19). In our large
cohort of AF patients at risk for stroke, risk factors
for coronary atherosclerosis, including hypertension
and dyslipidemia, predicted aspirin over OAC ther-
apy prescription. Additionally, characteristics asso-
ciated
with
coronary
atherosclerosis,
including
coronary
artery
disease
itself,
prior
myocardial
infarction, unstable and stable angina, recent CABG,
and
peripheral
arterial
disease,
also
were
more
often predictive of aspirin prescription. It is possible
that cardiovascular specialists may be more inclined
to treatment with aspirin therapy in such patients,
despite concomitant indications for anticoagulation
due to AF. This may reflect the misperception that
aspirin exhibits adequate efficacy compared with
OAC, or may be driven by concerns for bleeding risk
when using combination therapy (20). That prior
stroke/TIA, prior systemic embolism, and congestive
heart failure were associated with more frequent
prescription
of
OAC
suggests
that
these
specific
components of both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc
scores may be weighed more by the prescribing
clinician in a decision to choose appropriate OAC
over
aspirin-only
therapy.
Interestingly,
after
multivariable adjustment, men with AF in our study
had a 6% greater odds of OAC prescription versus
aspirin
therapy,
despite
previous
studies
that
demonstrate an increased stroke risk in women (3).
This
paradoxical
practice
pattern
suggests
that
female sex as an important stroke risk factor in AF
remains largely unappreciated. Previous data from
the PINNACLE registry suggest that a sex bias may
exist on the basis of lower prescription rates of OAC
in
women
treated
in
real-world
U.S.
cardiology
practices (21). Significant variability of OAC pre-
scription across individual practices was observed
(as shown in Figure 2); this suggests that focusing
on factors at the practice level, and not simply at
the individual physician level, may prove important
in future efforts to rectify proper prescription of
OAC in AF patients at risk for stroke.
A significant number of patients prescribed OAC for
AF were also prescribed antiplatelet therapy. Dual
antiplatelet therapy was prescribed in 19.2% to 20.6%
of the patients who were prescribed aspirin alone.
Among those receiving OAC, aspirin was prescribed in
just over one-half of all patients with coronary heart
disease equivalent conditions and one-third of pa-
tients without any coronary heart disease equivalent
conditions. It is also important to emphasize that a
substantial proportion of AF patients without a car-
diovascular risk equivalent (approximately one-third)
were prescribed both an OAC and aspirin, placing
those patients at higher risk for bleeding, without any
evidence of benefit. This category of patients likely
represents “low-hanging fruit” for changing practice
(presumably via prescriber education) in a fashion
that
would
mitigate
risk
for
bleeding,
without
reducing the efficacy of thromboembolism preven-
tion (22). Triple therapy, including an anticoagulant
agent and 2 antiplatelet drugs, was prescribed in
approximately 6%. Although guidelines recommend
aspirin therapy in all acute coronary syndrome pa-
tients who are able to take it (23), consensus guide-
lines for anticoagulant-indicated AF patients with
stable coronary heart disease and its equivalents are
lacking, with either little mention (24), or recom-
mendations to only continue antiplatelet therapy
for 1 year after an acute coronary syndrome. Our
finding that a large proportion of patients prescribed
OAC are also prescribed aspirin therapy suggests that
further studies evaluating cardiovascular outcomes in
AF patients with stable coronary heart disease pre-
scribed various antithrombotic strategies are needed.
Additionally, clarification and subsequent promulga-
tion of consensus guidelines on concomitant anti-
platelet and anticoagulation use appears warranted,
particularly
because
coronary
heart
disease
risk
equivalents have now been incorporated into the
CHA2DS2-VASc score as part of consensus AF guide-
lines (12).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, although the PINNACLE
registry does ascertain whether an anticoagulant
agent is contraindicated, the data are not sufficiently
granular to calculate the HAS-BLED score (i.e., the
PINNACLE registry does not capture data on medica-
tion use predisposing to bleeding, labile international
normalized ratios, or alcohol or drug use) (25), nor
does it contain data on renal insufficiency or aspirin
dose prescribed. This additional information may
have been helpful to quantify the bleeding risk among
those who received aspirin versus OAC prescription to
determine whether bleeding risk was associated with
prescription preference. However, because the net
clinical benefit of warfarin actually increases with the

2921
 HAS-BLED score (given that the score generally mir-
rors the stroke-risk scores), a higher bleeding risk
alone should not justify aspirin, rather than an anti-
coagulant agent. In fact, data support a net clinical
benefit for OAC over aspirin therapy in AF patients
at risk for stroke, despite increased bleeding risks
(26). Second, the PINNACLE program enrolled pa-
tients from motivated cardiology practices dedicated
to quality improvement. Therefore, antithrombotic
therapy prescription patterns in other U.S. practices
may differ from those reported in this study, poten-
tially reducing the generalizability of our results.
Third, specific data are unavailable regarding previ-
ous bleeding complications or exact reasons for con-
traindications to anticoagulant therapy, and therefore
we cannot determine the validity of a reported
contraindication. Fourth, the main data analyzed
consisted of OAC prescription at the index AF visit.
Although the index visit may not capture OAC pre-
scription at any time in patient follow-up, a sensitivity
analysis that included follow-up visits out to 1 year
after the index visit demonstrated that only a small
proportion of additional patients (<2%) were pre-
scribed OAC. Fifth, the PINNACLE registry does not
contain follow-up data to ascertain outcomes, such as
subsequent stroke or bleeding, and does not contain
follow-up laboratory data to assess therapeutic anti-
coagulation
status
with
warfarin.
Future
studies
should focus on these outcomes as they relate to
aspirin versus OAC prescription, as well as effects of
prescription of additional antiplatelet agents. Finally,
some may argue that the PINNACLE data collection
form may not reflect actual prescription of the drug,
much less what patients actual receive or consume;
however, that distinction is arguably minimally rele-
vant for the purposes of this study, because the
data recorded on the form likely more purely reflects
the intent or perceived “correct” prescription of
medications. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the
possibility that, despite best efforts for accurate data
collection,
underreporting
of
OAC
prescription
occurred by those recording this information.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite a lack of evidence for aspirin’s use for
thromboembolic prophylaxis in patients with AF at
moderate to high risk of stroke, and clear benefit with
the use of OACs, nearly 1 in 3 of these patients in this
large,
quality-improvement
registry
of
cardiology
outpatients with AF at intermediate to high risk of
stroke were prescribed aspirin alone. Several specific
patient
characteristics
predicted
prescription
of
aspirin
therapy
over
OAC
therapy,
particularly
comorbidities related to coronary atherosclerosis and
its risk equivalent diseases. These data indicate a gap
in care, most prominent in patients with or at risk for
coronary artery disease, and should draw attention to
a high rate of prescription of aspirin therapy in AF
patients at risk for stroke, despite previous data that
show aspirin to be inferior to OAC in this population.
The specific patient characteristics associated with
this practice, including those related to coronary ar-
tery
disease,
highlight
opportunities
to
improve
appropriate prescription of OAC in AF, including
identifying knowledge gaps that might be informed
by future studies.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: In a cardiac
outpatient population of patients with AF at
moderate to high risk of stroke, a relatively high
proportion of patients were treated with aspirin
rather than anticoagulant agents, and this was
associated with conditions related to coronary
heart disease.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies
should investigate the impact of the availability of
non-vitamin K antagonist OACs on the choice of
antithrombotic agent for patients with AF and the
role of performance improvement programs on
adherence to guideline-directed management.
