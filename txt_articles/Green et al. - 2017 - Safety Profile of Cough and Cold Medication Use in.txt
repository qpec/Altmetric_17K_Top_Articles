BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The safety of cough and cold medication (CCM) use in children has 
been questioned. We describe the safety profile of CCMs in children <12 years of age from a 
multisystem surveillance program.
METHODS: Cases with adverse events (AEs) after ingestion of at least 1 index CCM ingredient 
(brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, 
guaifenesin, phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine) in children <12 years of age were 
collected from 5 data sources. An expert panel determined relatedness, dose, intent, and 
risk factors. Case characteristics and AEs are described.
RESULTS: Of the 4202 cases reviewed, 3251 (77.4%) were determined to be at least potentially 
related to a CCM, with accidental unsupervised ingestions (67.1%) and medication errors 
(13.0%) the most common exposure types. Liquid (67.3%), pediatric (75.5%), and single-
ingredient (77.5%) formulations were most commonly involved. AEs occurring in >20% of 
all cases included tachycardia, somnolence, hallucinations, ataxia, mydriasis, and agitation. 
Twenty cases (0.6%) resulted in death; most were in children <2 years of age (70.0%) 
and none involved a therapeutic dose. The overall reported AE rate was 0.573 cases per 
1 million units (ie, tablets, gelatin capsules, or liquid equivalent) sold (95% confidence 
interval, 0.553–0.593) or 1 case per 1.75 million units.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of AEs associated with CCMs in children was low. Fatalities occurred 
even less frequently. No fatality involved a therapeutic dose. Accidental unsupervised 
ingestions were the most common exposure types and single-ingredient, pediatric liquid 
formulations were the most commonly reported products. These characteristics present an 
opportunity for targeted prevention efforts.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: Before 2008, the 
US Food and Drug Administration became aware of 
serious and sometimes fatal adverse events related 
to cough and cold medications (CCMs). Limited data 
have been available to assess the safety of these 
products for children.
WhaT ThIs sTuDy aDDs: This study describes 
the safety profile and risk factors associated with 
CCMs from the largest pediatric safety surveillance 
study on these products. These findings can inform 
prevention and other safety intervention measures 
to improve the safety of CCM use in children.

 GREEN et al
Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and 
cold medications (CCMs) have been 
used to treat the symptoms of upper 
respiratory infection in children for 
decades. In 2007, concerns were 
raised via a citizen’s petition that 
CCMs had not been proven to be safe 
or effective in children <6 years of 
age and claimed that these products 
were not generally recognized as 
safe and effective by professional 
organizations and agencies.1 This 
led to voluntary relabeling of the 
dosing instructions to specify 
“do not use in children less than 
4 years old, 
” withdrawal of the 
concentrated infant formulations, 
and reminders from the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) to never 
use CCM in children <2 years of age. 
At the time of these events, little 
data were available to appropriately 
assess the efficacy or safety of these 
products for children. Statements 
by representatives for the American 
Academy of Pediatrics noted that 
these medications should be labeled 
with warnings that serious adverse 
events (AEs) have been reported 
with the use of OTC CCMs, and that 
OTC CCMs have not been shown to be 
effective in children.2, 
 
3
Before 2007, CCMs were used by 
an estimated 10% of US children 
every week, with the highest use in 
children <5 years of age.4 Despite 
these voluntary labeling changes and 
limited research evaluating efficacy 
in children, caregivers continue 
to administer these medications 
to children, and some physicians 
may continue to recommend their 
use, even among children <4 years 
of age.5 
– 
7 Although caregivers and 
physicians continue to use and 
recommend CCMs, and AEs requiring 
emergency department visits and 
hospitalizations continue, there 
has been some decrease in the 
volume of reports.4, 
 
8, 
 
9 Continued 
use is also demonstrated by the fact 
that US consumers spend over $5 
billion (Information Resources, Inc 
[multioutlet sales]) annually on these 
products.
In response to safety concerns 
associated with these products, 
the Pediatric Cough and Cold 
Safety Surveillance System was 
launched in 2008 and was designed 
to understand the safety profile 
of these medications by collecting 
data on significant AEs associated 
with pediatric exposures to CCMs, 
determining the causal relationship 
of the events to the CCM exposure, 
and identifying risk factors or root 
causes to inform prevention and 
other safety intervention measures.
MeThODs
The Pediatric Cough and Cold Safety 
Surveillance System continually and 
systematically collects data from 
5 data sources: (1) the National 
Poison Data System of the American 
Association of Poison Control 
Centers, (2) the FDA Adverse Event 
Reporting System (FAERS), (3) 
English-language medical literature, 
(4) US-based news/media reports, 
and (5) manufacturer postmarketing 
safety databases (Table 1).
Case inclusion criteria from 
each data source are: patient 
age <12 years; exposure to at 
least 1 product that contains ≥1 
of the 8 most common active 
pharmaceutical ingredients in CCMs: 
brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, 
dextromethorphan, 
diphenhydramine, doxylamine, 
guaifenesin, pseudoephedrine, and 
phenylephrine; report of at least 1 
significant AE as defined by the case 
definition for each data source  
(Table 1); and that the event 
occurred in the United States.
Potential cases were initially 
reviewed by using the Guideline

Cases that reported a medical 
outcome of moderate effect, 
major effect, or death.
Real-time surveillance software algorithms identified eligible cases by age, index drug, 
and medical outcome. Standardized data collection sheet included patient information, 
products involved, dose, duration of use, drug administration technique, clinical course, 
clinical effects, and outcomes. Deidentified case records were received.
FAERS
Fatal and nonfatal AEs based on 
the International Conference 
on Harmonization definition.
The FAERS database was searched quarterly to identify eligible cases by age and index 
drug. The deidentified records were obtained from the FDA as MedWatch forms with 
standardized fields for patient demographics, exposure information, suspect drugs, 
concomitant medications, AEs, and case narrative.
Medical literature
Cases that met minimum 
eligibility criteria.
English-language medical literature was systematically searched weekly to identify eligible 
cases. Search results were reviewed and the full text of publications that potentially 
included eligible cases were obtained.
News/media reports
Cases that met minimum 
eligibility criteria.
A weekly search using software algorithms was conducted to identify eligible cases in 
regional or national news and media reports. All reports were publicly available. The full 
article was retrieved for reports that potentially contained an eligible case.
Manufacturer postmarketing 
safety databases
Fatal and nonfatal serious AEs 
based on the International 
Conference on Harmonization 
definition.
Participating manufacturers searched their safety databases quarterly by age and index 
drug to identify eligible cases. The deidentified record was delivered as either a FDA 
MedWatch form or World Health Organization’s Council for International Organizations 
of Medical Sciences form with standardized fields for patient demographics, exposure 
information, suspect drugs, concomitant medications, AEs, and case narrative.

on Detection and Management 
of Duplicate Individual Cases 
and Individual Case Safety 
Reports standards to identify 
duplicates.10 Key data elements 
were systematically extracted 
and reconciled from each case 
per written work instructions 
and assembled into standardized 
summaries. Autopsy reports were 
sought for all fatal cases and included 
in the source documents. These 
summaries were then reviewed by 
the expert panel in combination 
with all source documents. The 
relationship between each AE and 
reported medication (CCMs as well 
as any other medications taken) 
was assigned to 1 of 4 categories: 
related, potentially related, unlikely 
related, and unable to determine. 
The expert panel assigned the intent 
of CCM administration to 1 of 3 
categories: therapeutic (including 
medication errors), nontherapeutic 
(including accidental unsupervised 
ingestion [AUI]), or unknown. Panel 
members independently reviewed 
each case, and all final decisions 
by the panel were formed during 
face-to-face meetings or conference 
calls. Decisions were based on the 
entire body of information available 
for each case using a priori rules. 
Cases for which there was initial 
disagreement among the panel 
members were re-reviewed and 
debated by the panel until consensus 
was reached. Although precise 
doses could not be determined 
from the available information, 
exposures were assigned to 1 of 
3 dose categories, therapeutic, 
supratherapeutic, or unknown, 
based on established monograph 
dosing guidelines, 
11 
– 
16 accepted, 
professional, child-specific dosing 
guidance, and child-specific 
research.17
The expert panel consists of 5 
authorities from the specialties of 
pediatrics, critical care medicine, 
toxicology, clinical pharmacology, 
emergency medicine, and forensics. 
Using standardized definitions, the 
expert panel determined whether 
each event was related, potentially 
related, unlikely related, or if 
the relatedness was unable to be 
determined. These determinations 
were made based on evaluation of 
the history of ingestion, drug levels 
(if available), clinical course, and the 
likelihood of an alternative cause. For 
all cases determined to be unlikely 
related, an alternative cause for the 
event was determined.
Cases were included for analysis if 
the expert panel determined that at 
least 1 AE was potentially related to 
at least 1 of the 8 most common OTC 
CCM ingredients. Variables analyzed 
included age, sex, exposure type, 
characteristics, clinical effects, and 
rates of reported events adjusted by 
product sales. Clinical effects were 
coded by using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; 
Maintenance and Support Services 
Organization, McLean, VA) preferred 
term. CCM unit sales (ie, tablets, 
gelatin capsules, or liquid equivalent) 
data from food, drug, and big-box 
retailers (Information Resources, Inc, 
Chicago, IL) were used to calculate 
the rates of reported AE cases per 
unit of CCM drug sold to adjust for 
drug availability.
All analyses were performed by 
using SAS software, version 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Cases 
detected as of March 31, 2015, with 
an event date between January 1, 
2009 and December 31, 2014, were 
included. Although data collection 
for the multisystem surveillance 
program launched in 2008, events 
from 2009 to 2014 were included 
for these analyses because sales data 
were not available before 2009.
ResuLTs
A total of 4202 cases met eligibility 
criteria for expert panel review. 
Of these, 3251 (77.4%) were 
determined to be at least potentially 
related to an index CCM ingredient 
and were included in the analysis 
(Fig 1). The most common exposure 
types were AUIs (67.1%) and 
medication errors (13.0%). Forty-six 
percent (46.0%) of the cases involved 
a child aged 2 to <4 years, of which 
the majority (n = 1326/1495; 88.7%) 
were AUIs. Medication errors were 
relatively more common in children 6 
to <12 years of age (44.7%). Sex was 
similar among AUIs and medication 
errors, with the slight majority 
(54.1%) involving boys. The drug 
was self-administered in almost all 
(99.8%) of the AUI cases, with 5 
(0.2%) involving administration by a 
sibling <6 years of age. The majority 
of exposures occurred in the child’s 
own home (90.3%), which did not 
differ greatly by exposure reason 
group. Among medication errors, 
most cases involved administration 
by the child’s parent (44.2%) or 
alternate caregiver, such as another 
family member or babysitter (42.1%) 
(Table 2).
More cases involved liquid  
(67.3%) and pediatric (75.5%) 
formulations than solid (32.3%)  
or adult (15.4%) formulations. 
Single-ingredient products (77.5%)  
were more likely to be reported 
than fixed-combination ingredient 
products (23.3%) (Table 2). CCM 
mentions were representative of 
available products on the market 
with diphenhydramine (n = 1892; 
58.2%) and dextromethorphan  
(n = 1257; 38.7%) accounting for 
the majority of mentions. Although 
diphenhydramine predominated 
among AUIs (n = 1374; 62.9%), 
dextromethorphan predominated 
among medication error cases  
(n = 252; 59.6%). The most common 
AEs reported were tachycardia, 
somnolence, hallucinations, ataxia, 
mydriasis, and agitation (Table 3). 
The most commonly reported events 
(eg, tachycardia, somnolence, and 
hallucinations) did not differ between 
AUI and medication error cases.
Twenty (0.6%) fatal cases were 
reported, of which autopsy

 GREEN et al
reports were received for 10 cases 
(50.0%). Two cases were AUIs, 
2 were medication errors, and 9 
involved other exposure reasons 
(6 homicides, 1 use of a CCM as 
a sleep aid, and 2 unspecified 
nontherapeutic indication for use). 
The intent was not reported in the 
remaining 7 cases. The majority of 
fatal events occurred in children 
<2 years of age (n = 14; 70.0%). 
Exposure characteristics were often 
not reported among fatal cases, but 
when information was known, most 
involved doses administered by a 
parent (n = 8; 40.0%) and occurred 
in the child’s own residence (n = 8; 
40.0%). Two cases involved self-
administration of a CCM, both of 
which were AUIs. Similar to nonfatal 
cases, diphenhydramine (n = 13; 
65.0%) and dextromethorphan (n = 
5; 25.0%) were the most common 
index ingredients involved, with 
the addition of chlorpheniramine 
(n = 4; 20.0%). Seven fatal cases 
involved only a single-ingredient 
CCM product. The remaining 13 
fatal cases involved 27 nonindex 
ingredient mentions, including 6 
cases involving a prescription opioid 
combination CCM. Four fatal cases 
(20.0%) involved a supratherapeutic 
dose, and in 16 cases (80.0%), the 
dose could not be determined. 
Although the dose could not be 
determined in many cases, no death 
was determined to be the result of 
a therapeutic dose of a CCM index 
ingredient.
The reported AE rate adjusting for 
sales was 0.573 cases per million 
units sold (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.533–0.593) or 1 case per 1.75 
million units (ie, tablets, gelatin 
capsules, or liquid equivalent) sold 
(Table 4). The rate of AUI cases 
(0.385 [95% CI, 0.369–0.401]) was 
5 times that of medication error 
cases (0.075 [95% CI, 0.068–0.082]). 
That is, 1 AUI case occurred per 
2.60 million units (ie, tablets, gelatin 
capsules, or liquid equivalent) sold 
compared with 1 medication error 
case occurred per 13.33 million units 
(ie, tablets, gelatin capsules, or liquid 
equivalent) sold (Table 4). Among all 
cases, the rate of AEs involving liquid, 
pediatric formulation, and single-
ingredient products was higher than 
the rate of AEs involving solid, adult 
formulation, and fixed-combination 
ingredient products (Table 5).
DIscussIOn
Reported AEs from pediatric 
exposures to CCMs were uncommon, 
with the majority occurring by self-
administration in children <4 years 
old. Most cases reported transient, 
non–life-threatening clinical effects 
consistent with what we know 
about these medications and their 
mechanism of action. Also notable 
was that only 13.0% of cases were 
associated with medication errors, 
thus suggesting that medication 
errors that lead to a significant effect 
were rare.
Concerns raised at the 2007 FDA 
Joint Meeting of the Nonprescription 
Drugs Advisory Committee and the 
Pediatric Advisory Committee were 
focused on CCM use in children <4 
years of age, especially the use of 
combination CCMs. A previous report 
described characteristics of fatal 
cases related to CCMs similar to those

observed in this study, with most 
involving supratherapeutic doses 
given by adults or other caregivers to 
children <2 years of age.18 Our results 
confirm the focus on these younger 
age groups, but suggest that the 
availability of medication in the home 
and CCM storage practices that make 
the medication accessible to toddlers 
most often lead to AEs rather than 
therapeutic use per se. This risk is 
not unique to CCMs, because children 
<4 years of age are at high risk for 
any type of ingestion due to the 
exploratory nature of children this 
age and given that any high volume 
and/or dose ingested may lead to an 
AE due to their small size.
Contrary to initial concerns with 
fixed-combination CCM products, 
the number of cases that involved 
a single-ingredient product was 
4 times greater than the number 
of cases that involved a fixed-
combination CCM product when 
adjusted for product sales. A 
small number of cases reported 
an exposure to both a single-
ingredient and fixed-combination 
product. Although this scenario 
may result in a supratherapeutic 
dose of a CCM, it was not a common 
occurrence. Additionally, we 
found that products containing 
antihistamines (diphenhydramine 
and chlorpheniramine) and 
dextromethorphan were the 
most commonly involved index 
ingredients. Antihistamines are 
marketed for cough and cold 
symptoms as well as for allergy 
relief14 and for sleep (in adults) 
and are more readily available 
in the home than the other index 
ingredients according to the sales 
data.
Although these data suggest that 
CCMs when used as directed are 
generally safe in children and rates 
of reported AEs are low, efficacy 
was not assessed in our study. CCMs 
are intended to treat the symptoms 
associated with coughs and colds 
rather than treating the underlying 
disease. These symptoms are self-
limiting and difficult to measure, 
particularly in children. Caregivers 
often report symptom relief and sales 
data suggest continued use of these 
products in children. Randomized

pediatric) involving 4835 patients 
(3799 adults, 1036 children). The 
small number of trials in each 
category, the limited quantitative 
data reported, and the marked 
variation in patient populations, 
interventions, and outcome measures 
prohibited the pooling of data.19 
Hence, the authors’ conclusion 
was that the available data were 
inadequate and an evaluation of 
efficacy was not feasible. Although 
the safety profile garnered by this 
large surveillance network provides 
a reassuring comprehensive risk 
evaluation, additional well-designed 
efficacy trials of CCMs are still 
needed to conduct a true benefit-risk 
assessment. Understanding what 
benefit(s) these medications may 
provide is essential considering that 
no medication is without risk.
Although previous reports8, 
 
20 
suggest that pediatric CCM exposures 
reported to US poison centers 
were higher in the period before 
the launch of this surveillance 
system, our results suggest that 
additional efforts are warranted 
to prevent pediatric CCM AEs and 
should focus on the prevention 
of AUIs and medication errors in 
children <4 years of age. Specifically, 
there appear to be opportunities 
with single-ingredient, pediatric 
liquid products. Child-resistant 
packaging, proper measuring, 
and flow-restriction delivery 
devices may make the biggest 
impact on decreasing both types 
of exposures.21, 
 
22 Manufacturing 
controls to prevent inappropriate 
use and reduce medication errors 
include standardization of units both 
on the label and dosing devices (ie, 
milliliters instead of teaspoons), 
flow restrictors on liquid medication 
bottles, and limitations in the 
total medication content in liquid 
preparations. These initiatives 
have been developed with the goal 
of limiting product accessibility, 
confusion regarding units of measure, 
inappropriate dose administration, 
and ultimately toxicity.21, 
 
23, 
 
24 In 
addition to packaging, caregiver 
education on safe storage and proper 
supervision is always important in 
preventing AUIs. Poison prevention 
campaigns from organizations, such 
as American Association of Poison 
Control Centers, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s 
PROTECT Up & Away Campaign, 
the National Safety Council, and 
Safe Kids, should continue to be 
supported and emphasized.
The strengths of this study include 
the use of multiple national data 
sources and that each case was 
adjudicated by an expert panel. 
The size of the study was large and

encompassed 6 years of data (2009 
to 2014). The data capture system 
was unique in that it collected 
real-world consumer experiences, 
which are data not obtainable from 
randomized control trials. Reporting 
to the surveillance system was timely 
and extended a quarter beyond the 
study time period to account for the 
delayed reporting that is common 
with surveillance systems. The study 
is limited by reliance on spontaneous, 
self-reports that were captured after 
the voluntary product changes. As 
with any surveillance system that is 
reliant on spontaneous reporting, not 
all CCM AE cases are detected, and 
thus the rates are underestimates of 
all exposures. However, even if this 
surveillance system captured only 
10% of all cases, the rates of CCM AE 
exposures would still be low. Finally, 
not all characteristics surrounding 
the events of the exposure were 
consistently reported, which is 
particularly limiting in the evaluation 
of dose and related outcomes done 
for this study.
cOncLusIOns
Overall, 3251 cases with AEs related 
to CCMs were reported from 2009 to 
2014 in our surveillance system. The 
overall rate of AEs was equivalent 
to 1 case per 1.75 million units (ie, 
tablets, gelatin capsules, or liquid 
equivalents) sold, indicating these 
events are rare. The majority of 
AEs occurred in children <4 years 
of age (59.7%), involved an AUI 
(67.1%), and were nonfatal (99.4%). 
Fatalities were more rare (n = 20) 
and occurred mostly in children <2 
years of age; none were determined 
to have involved a therapeutic 
dose. Single-ingredient, pediatric 
liquid formulations were the most 
commonly reported formulations and 
present an opportunity for targeted 
prevention efforts.
