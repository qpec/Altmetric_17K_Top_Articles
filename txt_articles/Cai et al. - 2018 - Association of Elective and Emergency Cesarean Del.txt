Abstract
IMPORTANCE Global cesarean delivery (CD) rates have more than doubled over the past 2 decades,
with an increasing contribution from elective CDs. Cesarean delivery has been linked to early
childhood overweight and obesity, but limited studies have examined elective and emergency CDs
separately.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether elective or emergency CD was associated with risk of early
childhood overweight.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were drawn from the Growing Up in Singapore
Toward Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study, an ongoing prospective mother-child birth cohort study.
Participants were pregnant women aged 18 years or older with homogeneous parental ethnic
background in their first trimester recruited between June 2009 and September 2010 (n = 1237) at
2 major public hospitals in Singapore. Those with type 1 diabetes or undergoing chemotherapy or
psychotropic drug treatment were excluded. Data analysis commenced in October 2017.
EXPOSURES Delivery mode obtained from clinical records. Elective and emergency CD examined
separately against vaginal delivery as reference.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Body mass index–for–age z scores at age 12 months calculated
based on 2006 World Health Organization Child Growth Standards from infant weight and
recumbent crown-heel length measurements taken between December 2010 and April 2012. High
body mass index status at risk of overweight was defined as a z score of more than 1 SD and less than
or equal to 2 SDs. Overweight was defined as a z score of more than 2 SDs.
RESULTS Among 727 infants analyzed (51.2% [372] male), 30.5% (222) were born via CD, of which
33.3% (74) were elective. Prevalence of at risk of overweight and overweight at age 12 months was
12.2% (89) and 2.3% (17), respectively. Elective CD was significantly associated with at risk of
overweight or overweight at age 12 months after adjusting for maternal ethnicity, age, education,
parity, body mass index, antenatal smoking, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational
diabetes, and sex-adjusted birth weight–for–gestational age (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.08-3.90;
P = .03). The association persisted after further adjustment for intrapartum antibiotics and first 6
months infant feeding, 2 potential mediators of early childhood overweight and obesity (odds ratio,
2.02; 95% CI, 1.05-3.89; P = .04). No significant associations were found for emergency CD. Analysis
with multiple imputation for missing covariates yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Choice of delivery mode may influence risk of early childhood
overweight. Clinicians are encouraged to discuss potential long-term implications of elective CD on

Introduction
Global cesarean delivery (CD) rates have more than doubled over the past 2 decades, particularly in
more developed countries.1 Noteworthily, the contribution from elective CD has increased
significantly.2-4 Elective CDs are typically performed in the absence of maternal or fetal indications.5
The rising CD rates have been attributed to multiple biopsychosocioeconomic and cultural factors,
including increased maternal age, increased prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fear
of childbirth, favorable public perception, and increased consumer autonomy, of which different
permutations are likely to exist among populations.6-8
Cesarean delivery has been associated with early childhood overweight and obesity amidst
inconclusive evidence.9-13 Widely regarded as a public health epidemic, overweight and obesity are
linked to childhood and adult morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, orthopedic
problems, depression, low self-esteem, and social marginalization.14-16 Early childhood overweight
and obesity are also likely to persist into middle childhood and adolescence.17,18 In 2016, the World
Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 41 million children younger than 5 years were affected by
overweight or obesity worldwide, half of them in Asia.19 The same report highlighted the importance
of addressing obesogenic risk factors in pregnancy and infancy, 2 critical developmental periods,
with delivery mode implicated as 1 such factor.
Various schools of thought underlie the association between delivery mode and early childhood
overweight and obesity. Studies have shown that delivery mode establishes initial gut microbiome
diversity in newborns,20 which continues to diverge throughout infancy until age 6 months.21-23 This
led to the theory that the altered initial gut microbiome in infants born via CD modulates energy
harvest and metabolism through interaction with diet, thereby increasing susceptibility to
subsequent overweight.24,25 Proponents of the microbiota maturity concept, however, believe that
time point of acquisition of a mature gut microbiota, rather than initial microbiome, was predictive of
subsequent adiposity.26,27 Alternatively, it has been proposed that stress-response signaling during
delivery may shape long-term metabolic trajectories via epigenetics28 or hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis modulation independent of microbiome.29 Although the exact underlying mechanism
remains unclear, we hypothesize that infants born via elective CD differ from those born via
emergency CD in terms of overweight susceptibilities, likely inherently due to absence or presence
of labor or membrane rupture. However, few studies have examined emergency and elective CD
separately owing to inadequate data on delivery mode subgroups, which may partially explain the
inconclusive evidence of association.30-32
Variable study setting and covariate adjustment may also contribute to the contradictory
results. Results from existing population-specific studies may have limited generalizability owing to
strong racial/ethnic and geographical disparities in childhood overweight and obesity.33,34
Gestational diabetes, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared]), maternal and infant antibiotics, and birth weight, together with
gestational age, were common confounders not adjusted for in studies investigating the association
between cesarean delivery and childhood overweight and obesity.35,36 With increasingly multiethnic
communities due to enhanced global migration and mobility, more comprehensive population-
specific prospective studies on the impact of elective and emergency CD on early childhood
overweight and obesity are warranted.
Controlling for potential confounding and mediating effects from multiple maternal and infant
factors, this mother-offspring birth cohort study of a multiethnic Asian population aimed to

 investigate whether elective and emergency CD were independently associated with risk of
childhood overweight at age 12 months. We hypothesize that infants born via elective CD vs
emergency CD may differ in risk of overweight during early childhood.
Methods
Study Design
Data were drawn from the ongoing Growing Up in Singapore Toward Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO)
prospective mother-child birth cohort study.37 Data analysis commenced in October 2017. Pregnant
women in their first trimester (n = 1237) were recruited between June 2009 and September 2010
from KK Women’
s and Children’
s Hospital or National University Hospital, 2 major public hospitals in
Singapore. Citizens or permanent residents aged 18 years or older with homogeneous parental ethnic
background (Chinese, Malay, or Indian) were included. Those with type 1 diabetes or undergoing
chemotherapy or psychotropic drug treatment were excluded.
All participants gave written informed consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Centralised Institutional Review Board of SingHealth and Domain Specific Review Board of Singapore
National Health Care Group. This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cohort studies.
Exposures
Delivery mode was obtained from hospital delivery reports by trained health personnel. Vaginal
delivery included spontaneous vaginal delivery, assisted breech delivery, vacuum extraction, and
forceps delivery. For this study, elective CD was defined as a CD conducted as a result of advanced
planning due to reasons such as maternal request, history of CD and malpresentation, and/or a
decision made more than 24 hours before delivery due to nonemergency maternal or fetal conditions
such as maternal obesity, diabetes, and macrosomia. Emergency CD was defined as a CD that was
not planned or scheduled, and/or a decision made during the 24 hours before delivery due to
deteriorating maternal or fetal health. These are working definitions by health care professionals in
practice. To better address our hypothesis, CD was reclassified into intrapartum and nonlabor
according to whether the procedure took place before or after labor onset and/or
membrane rupture.
Anthropometric Outcome
Between December 2010 and April 2012, infant anthropometric measurements were taken by
trained health personnel at age 12 months. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.001 kg using the
Seca 334 calibrated weighing scale (Seca GmbH & Co KG). Recumbent crown-heel length was
measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a Seca 210 Mobile Measuring Mat.
Based on WHO 2006 Child Growth Standards, infant weight and length were computed into
non–ethnic-specific BMI-for-age z scores (BAZs) using WHO Anthro software (version 3.2.2).38 At risk
of overweight was defined as a BAZ greater than 1 SD and less than or equal to 2 SDs and overweight
was defined as a BAZ greater than 2 SDs.39 These high BMI statuses40 were analyzed as a single
category in this study. Not at risk of overweight was defined as a BAZ less than or equal to 1 SD.
Covariates
Maternal ethnicity, age, educational level, antenatal smoking status, and infant feeding mode during
first 6 months of life were assessed through questionnaires administered by interviewers who were
trained health personnel. Early pregnancy BMI, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, intrapartum
antibiotic administration, and infant sex, birth weight, and gestational age were obtained from
hospital case notes. Sex-adjusted birth weight–for–gestational age (BW-for-GA) z scores were
subsequently calculated.41 Early pregnancy BMI was classified according to the WHO reference for
Asian individuals42 and was preferred to prepregnancy BMI because of concerns of recall bias and

 underreporting of prepregnancy weight, especially for the higher BMI groups.43,44 A high correlation
was found between the 2 variables in this study sample (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.96;
P < .001). Gestational diabetes was diagnosed based on WHO criteria.45 Details are included in the
eAppendix in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Participant characteristics were compared using χ2 or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and
1-factor analysis of variance for continuous variables (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Association of delivery mode with at risk of overweight and overweight at age 12 months was
analyzed using binary logistic regression (n = 727). Three models were used. Model 1 gave the
unadjusted association (crude model). Model 2 was adjusted for potential confounders, including
maternal ethnicity, age at delivery (continuous), educational level, parity, early pregnancy BMI,
antenatal active or passive smoking, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, GDM, and infant
sex-adjusted BW-for-GA z score (continuous) (eAppendix in the Supplement). Continuous covariates
were used in linear terms. We used linktest to check whether the nonlinear form of a continuous
variable provided any better fit than the linear form. Model 3 further adjusted for intrapartum
antibiotics and infant feeding during the first 6 months, 2 potential mediators of early childhood
overweight. In each of these models, CD subgroups were analyzed as 2 indicator variables with
vaginal delivery as reference. Potential interactions between covariates and delivery mode were
tested using cross-product terms.
Secondary analyses were repeated using multiply imputed missing values for covariates in
regression analysis. Maternal education (n = 10), early pregnancy BMI (n = 58), antenatal smoking
status (n = 11), GDM (n = 65), intrapartum antibiotics (n = 1), sex-adjusted BW-for-GA z score (n = 5),
and infant feeding (n = 115) were imputed 20 times via multiple imputation analyses by chained
equation46 such that the total sample size was 956. Results of the 20 analyses were pooled using the
Rubin rule47 (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Additional association analyses were performed with the outcome variables of BAZ in
continuous form and BMI status in ordinal form using multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic
regression (Probit link), respectively.
Maternal and infant characteristics are presented as number (percentage) or mean (SD).
Regression analyses are presented as odds ratios (ORs) or β coefficients with 95% confidence
intervals. Two-tailed P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM) and Stata release 13 (StataCorp). Syntax is
available in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Results
Study Participants
Of the 1237 mother-child pairs recruited, 727 (51.2% [372] male infants) were included in the primary
analysis (Figure). The 3 subsets of participants had similar maternal education, early pregnancy BMI,
hypertensive disorders, intrapartum antibiotics, delivery mode, infant sex, infant feeding during first
6 months, and BAZ at age 12 months, but differed in terms of ethnicity, age, parity, antenatal smoking
status, GDM, and sex-adjusted BW-for-GA z score (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Of the 727 singletons analyzed, 30.5% (222) were born via CD. Elective CD rate was 10.2%, or
33.3% (74) of total CD births. The nonlabor CD rate was 19.8%, or 64.9% (144) of total CD births.
Prevalence of at risk of overweight and overweight at age 12 months was 12.2% (89) and 2.3% (17),
respectively.
Maternal and infant characteristics among the different modes of delivery are summarized in
Table 1. Infants born via elective CD, compared with vaginally delivered infants, had the highest
sex-adjusted BW-for-GA z score (0.44 vs 0.11) and BAZ at age 12 months (0.13 vs −0.19) and were
more likely to be born to mothers of older age (33.10 vs 31.19 years) and higher parity (82.4% vs

 60.6%). Infants born via emergency CD were more likely than infants born via elective CD to be born
to mothers who had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (11.5% vs 5.5%) and intrapartum
antibiotics administered (48.6% vs 32.3%). Row percentages are presented in eTable 2 in the
Supplement.
Delivery Mode and Anthropometric Outcomes
Elective CD was significantly associated with risk of overweight and overweight at age 12 months
(unadjusted OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.18-3.86; P = .01) (Table 2). The association remained significant after
adjusting for potential confounding effects from maternal ethnicity, age at delivery, educational level,
parity, early pregnancy BMI, antenatal active or passive smoking, hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy, GDM, and infant sex-adjusted BW-for-GA (adjusted OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.08-3.90; P = .03).
The association persisted after additional adjustment for intrapartum antibiotics and infant feeding
during the first 6 months, 2 potential mediators of early childhood overweight and obesity (final
adjusted OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.05-3.89; P = .04). No significant associations were found for emergency
CD in unadjusted and adjusted models.
Regression analyses with imputed missing covariates returned similar results, showing elective
CD significantly associated with risk of overweight and overweight at age 12 months (unadjusted OR,
2.13; 95% CI, 1.25-3.62; P = .005 and final adjusted OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.07-3.48; P = .03), but no
association for emergency CD (Table 3).
Additional analyses using reclassified CD yielded similar trends of association. Nonlabor CD was
associated with risk of overweight and overweight at age 12 months (unadjusted OR, 1.83; 95% CI,
1.14-2.93; P = .01) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Associations were not significant in adjusted models
(P = .06).
Analyses using BAZ as a continuous outcome variable and BMI status as an ordinal outcome
variable (ie, not at risk of overweight, at risk overweight, overweight) produced findings consistent
with our primary analyses (eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity analyses stratified by parity were performed, as significant interaction was found for
parity. Both CD modes were significantly associated with risk of overweight and overweight among
parous mothers, with elective CD having a higher OR (eTable 6 in the Supplement). Among
nulliparous mothers, only emergency CD was significantly associated with lower risk of overweight
despite similar ORs.

 Discussion
Our study provides novel evidence of an association between elective CD and increased childhood
overweight risk as early as the age of 12 months. The few existing studies we are aware of that
examined CD subgroups separately and similarly found an increased risk for elective CD included
older children aged 3 to 7 years.30-32 Among studies that did not discriminate between elective and
emergency CD, the earliest age of proven association was 2 years.13 These studies also had more
mixed results, with a few finding no significant association between CD and early childhood
overweight.13,48,49 Future studies may consider analyzing CD subgroups separately to increase clarity
of results. With early infancy implicated as a critical obesogenic microbiome developmental period,
we postulate that earlier outcome assessment may yield greater effect of association due to lesser
interference from external influences, such as diet, sleep, and physical activity. Assessment at an
earlier time may also reduce sample attrition rates in prospective studies, increasing sample size and
thus statistical power.
Our main findings revealed disparate association of elective and emergency CD with early
childhood overweight. Additional analyses demonstrated a greater risk in nonlabor CD compared
with intrapartum CD. Together, these findings substantiate our hypothesis that infants born via
elective CD differ from infants born via emergency CD in terms of overweight susceptibilities, likely
owing to absence of labor exposure and/or membrane rupture. One possible underlying mechanism
could be the partial microbial exposure during emergency CD from membrane rupture, as proposed
by a 2013 study50 that found the lowest bacterial richness and diversity in fecal microbiota of infants
born via elective CD at age 3 to 4 months. Alternatively, it could be that the substantially lower stress
response from absence of labor stimulus experienced by infants born via elective CD, shown to have
the lowest serum cortisol levels at birth,51 conferred a suboptimal differentiation of cell types
involved in long-term health.52 An interplay of these factors with the environment may be
more likely.
However, our main findings are contrary to existing studies that unanimously found an
association between nonelective CD and early childhood overweight.30-32 A recent study also
reported higher abundance of proadipogenic Lachnospiraceae family and higher risk of overweight

 and obesity in infants born via emergency CD to obese mothers.53 This obesogenic vertical
microbiome transmission theory is supported by evidence of independent association of maternal
overweight and obesity with neonatal gut microbiome and childhood overweight and obesity, albeit
in infants born via CD not classified as emergency or elective.54 The conflicting results may have
arisen from varying definitions of elective CD (participant-reported elective vs maternal request vs
planned CD) and lack of adjustment for intrapartum antibiotics, an important mediating factor.
Another reason may be residual confounding, a challenge in studies examining causality between
delivery mode and childhood overweight and obesity. Some studies attempted to circumvent this by
investigating sibling discordance, but results remained inconclusive.55,56
In addition, our sensitivity analyses provided new evidence of parity as a modifying factor.
Opposite trends of association between emergency CD and risk of early childhood overweight were
observed for nulliparous and parous women. This was similar for elective CD, although not achieving
statistical significance in nulliparous women. However, it must be noted that the small sample size
(n = 13) of elective CD in the nulliparous subgroup could have restricted statistical power. Existing
literature inconsistently adjusted for parity, and no studies stratified their analyses by parity, to our
knowledge.30-32,48,49,55,56 Hence, we can only postulate that our findings on parity may be a
consequence of the association between multiparity and maternal overweight and obesity,57 which
then parallels the obesogenic vertical microbiome transmission theory discussed above, although
again, parity was not adjusted for in these studies.53,54 Further studies are needed to prove or
disprove this. Nevertheless, our study highlights the importance of (1) analyzing CD subgroups
separately and (2) stratifying analyses by parity in gaining better understanding of the relationship
between delivery mode and early childhood overweight.
The overall CD rate of 30.5% in our study is comparable to that of 30.5% published by the
Ministry of Health, Singapore, in 2004, although the breakdown of CD subgroups was not reported
then.58 It is, however, higher than the Southeast Asia estimate of 14.8% and the estimate of 27.2% for
more developed countries published by a recent worldwide analysis, although still within the
reported ranges of 1.7% to 32.0% and 13.9% to 38.1%, respectively.1 This is worrisome, as overall CD
rates above the threshold of 9% to 16% were reportedly not associated with decreases in maternal,
neonatal, and infant mortality outcomes even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors.59 The
procedure has been associated with poorer short- and long-term maternal outcomes, including
longer hospital stay and placenta previa, and increased risks of undesirable neonatal and childhood
health outcomes, including respiratory complications, atopy, allergy, and type 1 diabetes.7,60-63
Existing studies on CD subgroup rates, however, were far less common. Elective and emergency
CD rates in our study were 10.2% and 20.3%, while nonlabor and intrapartum CD rates were 19.8%
and 10.7%, respectively. As past figures were not available, we were unable to assess the local
elective CD trend. A 2009 Southeast Asian study64 found that maternal request contributed 2.1% to
the overall CD rate in Indonesia. Our results were closer to estimates in developed countries. The
2010 UK national estimates were 9.3% and 14.5% for elective and emergency CD, respectively,
defined based on the UK Office for Population Censuses and Surveys classification codes R17 (not in
labor) and R18 (in labor).65 Switzerland estimated the rate of “
caesarean section on maternal request
prior to the onset of labour”
3 at 5.1% and “
caesarean section with medical indication prior to and after
onset of labour”
3 at 22.3%. It is apparent that elective CD is loosely defined among studies, with
some considering it an indication. The elective CD rate in our study increased substantially when it
was reclassified as nonlabor CD, further emphasizing the point that CD definitions are a crucial aspect
of future studies. Therefore, there is a pressing need for greater specificity and standardization of CD
subgroups to yield more comparable results and better insights.
Prevalence of at risk of overweight in our study was 12.2%, compared with the Southeast Asia
estimate of 8.1% and the estimate of 21.4% for developed countries.66 These estimates were based
on children aged 0 to 5 years using similar WHO Child Growth Standards cutoffs. Prevalence of
overweight in our study was 2.3%, compared with the 4.6% and 11.7% estimates for Southeast Asia
and developed countries, respectively.66 A Singapore study on Chinese preschoolers aged 6 to 72

 months found an overweight prevalence of 7.5% to 8.1% using 3 different BMI-based cutoffs.67 The
variation in results may be due to different age groups examined and different cutoffs defining
childhood weight status. The high prevalence of at risk of overweight is a cause for concern,
especially as worldwide rates have been projected to increase by 2020.68 From a public health
perspective, there may be value in allocating resources for preventive efforts targeting at-
risk infants.
Strengths of our study included large sample size, longitudinal design, and standardization of
data collection, which helped increase reliability and validity. Data collection was designed to
minimize recall bias; participants were not required to recall prepregnancy BMI in favor of pregnancy
BMI, and infant feeding was assessed at 3-month instead of 6-month intervals. The comprehensive
data also allowed for examination of CD subgroups separately while accounting for important
potential confounding and mediating factors such as GDM and intrapartum antibiotics. Intrapartum
antibiotics had not been adjusted for in previous studies. Antibiotics administered during labor have
been shown to affect vertical transmission of maternal vaginal microflora, and thus should not be
ignored as an important mediating factor.69
Limitations
A limitation of our study was the lack of data on paternal characteristics. Studies have proven
paternal overweight and obesity and its underlying genetic and environmental basis, including
familial predisposition to obesogenic appetitive traits, paternal eating behavior, and parenting style,
as a significant risk factor of childhood overweight.70-74 Adjustment for paternal factors would have
contributed to increased study robustness. In addition, our comparison analyses suggest potential
selection bias in the primary analysis group. However, the differing characteristics have been
adjusted for as covariates in the regression analyses, so they are unlikely to have caused bias in the
results. Furthermore, secondary analyses that included 229 additional participants returned similar
results. Measurement errors may also potentially exist, although the same calibrated equipment was
used by trained health personnel and the average of multiple measurements were taken. The
multiethnicity of our study population, while giving us insight into delivery mode and early childhood
overweight in a local context, may limit the generalizability of our results.
Conclusions
This study suggests that choice of delivery mode may influence risk of early childhood overweight.
More population-specific prospective studies examining emergency and elective CD as separate
subgroups are warranted. Additional studies may explore population-specific factors underlying the
rising trend in elective CD rates. Further validation of these findings may expand our preventive
strategy against childhood metabolic disorders. Clinicians may be encouraged to discuss potential
long-term implications of elective CD on child metabolic outcomes with patients who intend to have
children.
