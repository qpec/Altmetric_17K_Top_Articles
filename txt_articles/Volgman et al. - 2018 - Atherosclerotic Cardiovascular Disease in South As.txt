AHA SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT
Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease 
in South Asians in the United States: 
Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Treatments
A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
Circulation
https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/circ
ABSTRACT: South Asians (from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, 
Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) make up one quarter of the world’s 
population and are one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the United 
States. Although native South Asians share genetic and cultural risk 
factors with South Asians abroad, South Asians in the United States can 
differ in socioeconomic status, education, healthcare behaviors, attitudes, 
and health insurance, which can affect their risk and the treatment and 
outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). South Asians 
have higher proportional mortality rates from ASCVD compared with 
other Asian groups and non-Hispanic whites, in contrast to the finding 
that Asian Americans (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, 
and Vietnamese) aggregated as a group are at lower risk of ASCVD, 
largely because of the lower risk observed in East Asian populations. 
Literature relevant to South Asian populations regarding demographics 
and risk factors, health behaviors, and interventions, including physical 
activity, diet, medications, and community strategies, is summarized. 
The evidence to date is that the biology of ASCVD is complex but is no 
different in South Asians than in any other racial/ethnic group. A majority 
of the risk in South Asians can be explained by the increased prevalence 
of known risk factors, especially those related to insulin resistance, and 
no unique risk factors in this population have been found. This scientific 
statement focuses on how ASCVD risk factors affect the South Asian 
population in order to make recommendations for clinical strategies to 
reduce disease and for directions for future research to reduce ASCVD in 
this population.

AND GUIDELINES
S
outh Asians (people from Bangladesh, Bhutan, In-
dia, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) 
make up one quarter of the world’s population1 
and are one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in 
the United States.2 There is abundant medical literature 
from different countries such as India,3,4 Pakistan,5 Can-
ada,6–9 the United Kingdom,10 and Singapore11–13 that 
has demonstrated a higher atherosclerotic cardiovascu-
lar disease (ASCVD) risk in South Asians compared with 
other populations. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and di-
abetes mellitus (DM) have also been shown to be more 
frequent among Fiji Indians.14,15 Although people living 
in South Asian countries share genetic and cultural risk 
factors with South Asians living abroad, South Asians 
residing in the United States can differ in socioeconomic 
status, education, healthcare behaviors, attitudes, and 
health insurance, which can affect their risk and the 
treatment and outcomes of ASCVD. Small cohort stud-
ies in the United States have shown that South Asians 
have a higher risk of ASCVD compared with other racial 
or ethnic groups.16,17 South Asians have been found to 
have a higher proportional mortality rate from ischemic 
heart disease compared with other Asian ethnic groups 
and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs)18 (Figure 1). Asian 
Americans (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, 
Korean, and Vietnamese) when aggregated as a group 
are at lower risk of ASCVD, in part because of the lower 
ASCVD risk observed in East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, 
and Korean) populations.19
The success of primary and secondary CVD preven-
tion guidelines20–22 provided by the American Heart 
Association (AHA) and other AHA campaigns such as 
Life’s Simple 723 and Go Red For Women,24 along with 
other efforts to decrease CVD mortality in women over 
the past decade,25 has been remarkable. It is the hope 
of the authors of this statement that ASCVD mortality 
will decrease in the US South Asian population through 
increased awareness of the higher risk of ASCVD in 
South Asians and implementation of the actionable 
recommendations included in this statement.
Literature on demographics and biological and non-
biological mechanisms contributing to excess ASCVD, 
health behaviors, and interventions, including physical 
activity, diet, medications, and community strategies, in 
South Asians is summarized. We focus on potentially 
unique contributors to ASCVD risk in the South Asian 
community, clinical strategies to reduce disease, and 
directions for future research to reduce ASCVD in this 
high-risk population.
METHODS
The writing group members, nominated by the AHA 
Manuscript Oversight Committee, have a broad 
range of expertise on South Asians and CVD. A gen-
eral framework outlined by the committee chairs was 
used to conduct a comprehensive literature review 
to summarize existing evidence, to indicate gaps in 
current knowledge, and to formulate recommenda-
tions. Only English-language studies were reviewed, 
with PubMed/MEDLINE as our primary resource, 
as well as the Cochrane Library Reviews, Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, and US Census 
data as secondary resources. Inductive methods and 
descriptive studies that focused on ASCVD outcomes 
incidence, prevalence, treatment response, and risks 
were included. Because of the wide scope of these 
topics, members of the writing group were respon-
sible for drafting individual sections selected by the 
chair of the writing group, and the writing group 
chair assembled the complete statement. Studies 
done in countries outside the United States were 
included only if they could be applicable to the US 
South Asian population. The conclusions of this state-
ment reflect the views of the authors and do not 
necessarily represent the official view of the AHA. All 
members of the writing group had the opportunity to 
comment on the initial drafts and approved the final 
version of this document. The manuscript underwent 
extensive AHA internal peer review before consider-
ation and approval by the AHA Science Advisory and 
Coordinating Committee.
DEMOGRAPHICS 
South Asian Populations in the United 
States
Individuals who identify as South Asians are from a di-
verse set of communities and cultures with family ori-
gins from 7 countries that are most commonly listed as 
part of South Asia: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Mal-
dives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. South Asians have 
a tradition of being dispersed around the world as a 
result of a number of factors, including colonialism, po-
litical instability, persecution, and economic opportunity. 
People of South Asian descent have immigrated to the 
United States dating back to the late 18th century, with 
the bulk of the migration occurring in the early 1960s. 
South Asian immigration has occurred primarily in 3 
waves. The first wave, mainly from the Indian state of 
Punjab, occurred from the 1890s to 1920s. The second 
wave began with the passage of the 1965 Immigration 
and Nationality Act. During that time (1966–1977), a 
total of 20 
000 highly skilled professionals and 25 
000 
physicians emigrated from India to the United States.26 
The third wave occurred in the mid 1980s and encour-
aged family reunification, allowing parents and extend-
ed families of the settled professionals to immigrate to 
the United States.27
By 2010, according to the US Census, there were 
>3.4 million South Asians living in the United States

(individuals indicated this racial/ethnic minority group 
alone or in combination with another racial/ethnic mi-
nority group).28 Most South Asians in the United States 
are of Asian Indian origin (≈80%), with rapidly grow-
ing Bhutanese and Nepali populations.28 An estimated 
226 000, or 6%, of South Asians in the United States 
are ≥65 years of age.29 As shown in Figure 2, geo-
graphically, the top states that had the largest num-
bers of South Asians were California, New York, New 
Jersey, Texas, and Illinois,2,29 with most of the South 
Asians residing in urban metropolitan areas in these 
states.30 South Asians constitute a relatively young 
population compared with other minority groups in 
the United States (in 2012, the mean age of South 
Asians was 36 years compared to a mean age of 40.2 
years in NHWs) and continue to show a slightly greater 
proportion of females than males (53% versus 47% in 
2008–2012).31
The South Asian population is diverse with regard 
to not only regional and religious practices but also 
the many discrete spoken and written languages, in-
cluding Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Malayalam, Punjabi, 
Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. Language barriers have been 
reported to exist for middle-aged and older South 
Asians, particularly if the older adult is monolingual 
in a South Asian language. This can have a profound 
effect on access to health care and inclusion in the 
healthcare system for ongoing preventive and medi-
cal care. Poverty resulting in poor lifestyle choices 
such as those seen in the population in rural Nepal 
also significantly increases the risk of ASCVD among 
South Asians living in poorer countries.32 Furthermore, 
there appears to be heterogeneity within a single eth-
nic group such as, for example, the observed regional 
variations in ASCVD prevalence and mortality rates 
among South Asians in India.33
From a population perspective, it is imperative 
that the health needs of this racial/ethnic minority 
group are critically examined to ensure culturally ap-
propriate medical and health services, to address a 
variety of serious health conditions they face, to cre-
ate informed policy decisions, and to improve cur-
rent and future clinical research in this racial/ethnic 
minority group.

ASCVD in South Asians
lowed from South Africa and Trinidad.34,35 By the 1970s 
and 1980s, multiple studies of South Asians in the Unit-
ed Kingdom revealed earlier onset, higher incidence, 
and higher standardized mortality rates from ASCVD in 
South Asians compared with NHWs.36–38
Migration of South Asians to North America in-
creased in the 1960s and 1970s. Initially, people origi-
nating from various Asian countries were identified as 
Asian Americans in large databases, making it difficult 
to understand health and disease patterns in specific 
Asian subpopulations. Researchers have suggested dis-
aggregating Asian subgroups and cardiovascular out-
comes to better inform prevention and treatment strat-
egies in various Asian populations.39,40
At the turn of the 21st century, researchers started 
observing high rates of ASCVD among Asian Indians 
(also known by the more comprehensive term South 
Asians) residing in the United States and Canada.7,16,41,42 
In addition to having a high burden of ASCVD, South 
Asians in the United States were found to have higher 
hospitalization and mortality rates from ASCVD com-
pared with other racial/ethnic minority groups.43–46 
An analysis of a patient cohort from 1978 to 1985 in 
Northern California revealed significantly higher rates 
of hospitalization for ASCVD among South Asians in 
a longitudinal follow-up compared with 7 other racial/
ethnic minority groups, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.4 
compared with NHWs.45 In an analysis of >10 million 
national death records, South Asian men and women 
had a proportionately higher mortality from ischemic 
heart disease.18 The proportionate mortality burden 
from ischemic disease, as reflected by the proportional 
mortality rates, was highest in Asian Indian men (1.43) 
and women (1.12), followed by Filipino men (1.15), 
compared with NHW men (1.08) and women (0.92).18 
A majority of men and women from other Asian sub-
groups had less proportionate mortality (lower propor-
tional mortality rates) from ischemic disease compared 
with NHWs.18
Detection of Subclinical CVD
The use of computed tomography angiography to iden-
tify high-risk patients in the South Asian population is 
a young and growing field. Computed tomography an-
giography has been able to demonstrate variable AS-
CVD distribution patterns, higher amounts of stenosis,

and smaller luminal diameters in South Asians. A study 
showed that South Asians in a US cohort had smaller 
normalized proximal left anterior descending artery lu-
minal diameters compared with NHWs.47 Specifically, 
South Asians in this cohort also displayed more severe 
ASCVD on computed tomography angiography as de-
termined by both increased mean percent stenosis and 
a higher number of patients with multiple diseased ves-
sel segments.47 As demonstrated in multiple studies, 
South Asians were younger with a higher prevalence of 
DM and dyslipidemia compared with NHWs.
Among other cohorts of 4 ethnicities (NHWs, Asians, 
Hispanics, and blacks), Asian Indians were investigated 
for coronary artery calcification (CAC) burden com-
pared with the other racial/ethnic groups.48 Asian In-
dians, who represented ≈10% of the cohort, had an 
increased mean calcium score, and the Asian Indian 
race was a significant independent predictor of CAC se-
verity, even when controlling for traditional ASCVD risk 
factors. Among those >60 years of age, the prevalence 
of high CAC burden (scores >100) in Asian Indians is 
greater than in all other ethnic groups.
The MASALA study (Mediators of Atherosclerosis in 
South Asians Living in America) is still in its infancy in 
terms of long-term follow-up but has used methods 
including CAC and carotid intimal-medial thickness 
(CIMT) estimation by ultrasound to predict cardiovascu-
lar events. CIMT can help to visualize and quantify sub-
clinical atherosclerosis and has the potential of being an 
additional risk stratification tool. Within the MASALA 
cohort, preliminary data showed an increased inter-
nal/common carotid medial thickness compared with 
matched subjects in the MESA cohort (Multi-Ethnic 
Study of Atherosclerosis).49 Furthermore, the MASALA 
cohort compared with the MESA cohort demonstrated 
that South Asians had higher CAC scores than blacks 
and Latinos but scores similar to those of NHWs and 
Chinese Americans.50 A sex difference in CAC was 
seen, with any detectable CAC being similar between 
South Asian and NHW men (68%), whereas the rates 
of CAC were greater in NHW women compared with 
South Asian women (43% versus 37%). Predictors of 
CAC among South Asians included male sex, age, DM, 
cholesterol medication use, and hypertension. Further 
studies are needed to address the potential merit of us-
ing CAC to risk-stratify patients who would otherwise 
be deemed at low risk by traditional ASCVD risk factors.
The presence of peripheral artery disease increases 
the risk of major cardiovascular events. The measure of 
ankle-brachial index has been used as a noninvasive, 
low-cost screening approach for the detection of pe-
ripheral artery disease in South Asian populations in 
Sri Lanka,51 Singapore,52 and Pakistan.53 Ankle-brachial 
index screening of Asian populations in Singapore re-
vealed that peripheral artery disease was more preva-
lent among the Indian and Malay subgroups.52
Stroke
Major federal surveys have only recently started classi-
fying Asian Americans into subgroups, including Asian 
Indians (South Asians).39 As a result, population-specific 
data for diseases such as stroke, heart failure, and pe-
ripheral arterial disease are very limited for South Asians 
in the United States. In addition, few studies have as-
sessed the incidence or prevalence of these diseases in 
the South Asian population in the United States. As a re-
sult of this lack of literature in disease states other than 
ASCVD, this statement focuses only on ASCVD risk in 
South Asians.
CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS 
AND OUTCOMES
Angiography
South Asians undergoing angiography in the United 
States have been found to have smaller coronary lu-
minal diameters, higher-grade coronary artery ob-
structions, and a higher prevalence of multivessel dis-
ease.47,54 However, in a UK study using strict criteria, no 
differences were noted in coronary luminal diameter or 
severity of disease in matched pairs of South Asian and 
NHW men.55
Revascularization
A number of studies in the United Kingdom and Cana-
da have evaluated outcomes after percutaneous coro-
nary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery in South Asians compared with other popula-
tions.56–60 Most studies have shown similar use of re-
vascularization procedures in South Asians and other 
populations, although South Asians are more likely to 
have multivessel disease requiring coronary artery by-
pass graft surgery. This pattern of a higher likelihood 
of multivessel disease persists even after adjustment 
for differences in the prevalence of DM and other 
risk factors. Outcomes after PCI are generally similar 
in South Asians and NHWs, although several studies 
have demonstrated better cardiovascular outcomes in 
South Asians. Studies evaluating cardiovascular events 
and mortality after isolated coronary artery bypass graft 
have shown consistently poorer outcomes for South 
Asians compared with NHW populations.56–60

14 820 sex-matched controls from 52 countries, in-
cluding 1732 AMI cases and 2204 controls recruited 
from 5 South Asian countries. The INTERHEART study 
demonstrated that modifiable risk factors had similar 
contributions to ASCVD among native South Asians 
and that the prevalence of traditional risk factors 
largely accounts for the differences in the earlier age 
at onset of myocardial infarction (MI) between South 
Asians and other racial/ethnic groups. Collectively, 
these traditional risk factors accounted for approxi-
mately the same population-attributable risk in native 
South Asians compared with participants in other parts 
of the world.3,4 There were lower rates of protective 
factors among migrants compared with those residing 
in their native countries, which may be attributable in 
part to socioeconomic disparities.61 These mechanisms 
and risk factors are related, and we address each indi-
vidually below.
Biological Mechanisms
Insulin Resistance, Metabolic Syndrome,  
and Type 2 DM
Perhaps the greatest risk factor disparity in South Asians 
is seen in the occurrence of type 2 DM (T2DM) and im-
paired glucose tolerance. South Asians have at least a 
2-fold higher prevalence of T2DM, a higher incidence 
of new-onset DM, and a higher prevalence of impaired 
glucose tolerance compared with NHWs.62 It is well rec-
ognized that T2DM is an independent risk factor and 
predictor of ASCVD. The number of people with T2DM 
in South Asia is projected to reach ≈120 million by the 
year 2030.63 It is established that those with DM have a 
2- to 3-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death.4,61,64
There is a disproportionately high prevalence of met-
abolic syndrome (MetS) and insulin resistance in South 
Asians that may explain the higher prevalence of T2DM 
and ASCVD.65–67 South Asians born in the United States 
show evidence of an altered metabolic profile (elevated 
plasma insulin levels, altered plasma lipid profile, and 
higher truncal skin-fold thickness) in young adulthood 
compared with young adults of European descent in 
the United States.68 In this study, South Asian young 
adults also had lower IGFBP-1 (insulin-like growth fac-
tor–binding protein) and higher plasma leptin levels.68 
A study of middle-aged South Asian men in the United 
Kingdom showed that lower cardiorespiratory fitness 
was associated with insulin resistance.69 Another study 
of South Asian women showed lower adiponectin lev-
els (independently of insulin resistance) compared with 
NHWs, indicating that the association between insulin 
resistance and adiponectin may be different in South 
Asian women than in NHW women.70 Although fast-
ing glucose levels are similar between South Asians and 
NHWs, South Asians have higher fasting insulin levels 
and greater insulin resistance.6,8,71–73
The MASALA study is a prospective long-term study 
carried out in the United States that uses a community-
based cohort enrolling 900 South Asians between 40 
and 79 years of age without known CVD.74 This study 
found a higher prevalence of DM in South Asians (23%) 
compared with other ethnicities after adjustment for 
age and adiposity (6% in NHWs, 18% in blacks, 17% 
in Latinos, and 13% in Chinese Americans). To ex-
plain these findings, the MASALA study investigators 
postulated that South Asians might have lower β-cell 
function.75,76 Furthermore, they noted that 9.7% of 
participants reported gestational DM, and women with 
gestational DM were 3.2 times more likely to develop 
DM than those without gestational DM. Prior data have 
shown that women with elevated hemoglobin A1c in 
the first trimester are at a higher risk for gestational 
DM.77 These observations highlight the need for early 
intervention in this young high-risk population.78
Obesity
Obesity and overweight status are increasing globally. 
There is a strong association between body mass index 
(BMI) and cardiometabolic disorders. The World Health 
Organization and the American Diabetes Association79 
have recommended lowering the BMI cutoff points for 
defining overweight status and obesity in South Asians 
to improve the identification of cardiometabolic risk in 
this population.80 MetS is a cluster of risk factors for DM 
and CVD that are believed to be linked to insulin re-
sistance. MetS is characterized by increased abdominal 
adiposity, elevated blood pressure, high triglycerides, 
low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and high fasting 
blood glucose levels. The International Diabetes Fed-
eration and the “harmonized” definitions of MetS have 
ethnicity-specific waist circumference cutoffs and a 
lower fasting glucose cutoff (≥100 mg/dL) point, which 
may accurately capture more South Asians at risk.81
The definition of obesity varies between studies us-
ing BMI versus waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). One limitation 
of relying on BMI is that it does not take into account 
the distribution of body fat differentials, which may be 
better assessed with WHR.40 The MASALA study done 
in the United States showed that compared with NHWs, 
South Asians were less physically active and had lower 
adiponectin and higher resistin levels.82 South Asians 
had lower BMI, body weight, and waist circumference 
compared with all other racial/ethnic minority groups 
except Chinese Americans in MESA.82 South Asians had 
higher levels of visceral fat, higher levels of intermus-
cular fat and hepatic fat, and less pericardial fat vol-
ume compared with NHWs and Chinese Americans but 
greater levels compared with blacks.82 Furthermore, 
they had less total lean abdominal muscle mass com-
pared with all other racial/ethnic minority groups.82 A 
study of an electronic health record cohort in Northern 
California showed that despite lower BMI values and

lower prevalence of overweight/obesity than NHWs, 
South Asian men and women had higher rates of MetS 
over the range of BMI values.83
A recent meta-analysis of 50 Canadian studies 
showed that despite having similar BMIs, South Asian 
Canadians had a higher body fat percentage and South 
Asian women had higher WHRs compared with white 
Canadians. In terms of fat distribution, the mean to-
tal abdominal adipose tissue was higher in South Asian 
men compared with NHW men, but this difference was 
not seen in women. In addition, South Asian Canadi-
ans had more visceral and deep subcutaneous fat com-
pared with superficial subcutaneous fat.84 South Asians 
had a greater amount of abdominal adipose tissue 
compared with NHWs.85 A cross-sectional survey com-
paring Indians, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Europeans 
from the Newcastle Heart Project demonstrated higher 
rates of obesity based on BMI >30 kg/m2 in Indian and 
Pakistani people compared with Bangladeshis. How-
ever, the WHR was higher in Bangladeshi and Pakistani 
people compared with Indians. When all South Asians 
were compared with Europeans, the obesity rates (BMI 
≥30 kg/m2) were higher in South Asians.10 Migrants 
from South Asia have been shown to have higher BMIs 
compared with South Asians who remained in their na-
tive country.86,87
In South Asians, high BMI has been shown to be a 
weak risk factor for CVD mortality.88 Although some 
limitations exist in the INTERHEART study (eg, it was a 
case-control study and many risk factors were self-re-
ported), this study provided important data on obesity-
related AMI risk factors in South Asians compared with 
other racial/ethnic minority groups in the world. There 
was an increased risk of AMI in South Asian patients 
with high WHR.4 Higher population-attributable risks in 
South Asians with higher WHR contributed to higher 
rates of CVD. There was also a higher prevalence of 
abdominal obesity in Bangladesh compared with other 
South Asian countries.3 Abdominal obesity, as mea-
sured by WHR, has been shown to be an independent 
predictor of AMI in Indians,89 who are generally young-
er at the time of their first MI.8,90
Dyslipidemia
Dyslipidemia is likely an important factor contribut-
ing to the increased CVD risk observed in South Asian 
populations.3 The typical lipoprotein pattern seen in 
individuals of South Asian descent who are living in 
Western societies is characterized by hypertriglyceri-
demia68 and low levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C).91 
Although levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cho-
lesterol (LDL-C) may not appear elevated, this popu-
lation has a high incidence of qualitatively abnormal 
LDL-C particles characterized by smaller size and lower 
density.92 In a study that compared South Asian indi-
viduals living in India with those living in the United 
States,93 South Asians in the United States had higher 
plasma levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and 
LDL-C and lower levels of HDL-C. Studies compar-
ing Asian subgroups within the general population of 
Singapore found no significant differences in plasma 
concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and 
LDL-C among Indian, Malay, and Chinese popula-
tions.94,95 However, in one of these studies, significant-
ly lower levels of the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 were 
observed in the Indian population, which the authors 
suggest might contribute to the higher susceptibility 
of the Indian ethnic group to coronary heart disease.94 
Potential pathophysiological explanations for the ath-
erogenic dyslipidemia pattern include a higher preva-
lence of insulin resistance,96,97 which is frequently seen 
in South Asian populations, and abnormalities in CETP 
(cholesteryl ester transfer protein).98 South Asian pop-
ulations have been found to have 30% higher CETP 
activity levels than comparable European populations 
after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and waist circum-
ference (P<0.0001).98 This was positively associated 
with higher triglycerides and increased LDL-C particle 
number and inversely associated with HDL-C and LDL-
C particle size. A recent study99 of >16 000 Asian In-
dians in California showed that Asian Indians were 3 
times more likely to have low HDL-C (odds ratio [OR], 
3.93 for women and 3.00 for men; P<0.001) and 
twice as likely to have high triglycerides (OR, 2.12 for 
women and 2.67 for men; P<0.001) compared with 
NHWs and only slightly more likely to have high LDL-C 
(OR, 1.16 for women and 1.30 for men; P<0.001).99 
Small, dense LDL-C particles are known to be asso-
ciated with increased triglyceride and apolipoprotein 
B levels,100,101 and the INTERHEART study showed el-
evated apolipoprotein among South Asians with MI 
compared with subjects from other countries (61.5% 
versus 48.3%, respectively).3
Lipoprotein(a)
Another lipid abnormality that is seen in South Asians 
is the elevation of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels.102,103 
Lp(a) is structurally similar to LDL, with an additional di-
sulfide-linked glycoprotein called apolipoprotein(a).104 
There are considerable differences in the mean plasma 
Lp(a) concentrations between different populations 
and ethnic groups.105 Higher serum Lp(a) concentra-
tions have been reported in South Asian populations 
by most investigators,6,106,107 but other investigators 
have not found increased levels in South Asians.108 A 
study comparing the levels of evaluated Lp(a) and gen-
otypes in 3 South Asian populations (Indian, Pakistani, 
and Bangladeshi) with those of a European population 
found no significant difference in Lp(a) levels between 
South Asian men and European men; however, it did 
find higher Lp(a) levels in South Asian women com-
pared with European women.108 The investigators at-

tributed this difference to the higher Lp(a) levels in Pak-
istani women compared with Indian and Bangladeshi 
women.108 Some studies have shown an association 
between elevated Lp(a) in South Asians and athero-
sclerosis103 and clinical cardiovascular events,102 where-
as other studies have not.109 Another study examined 
the association of Lp(a) with carotid atherosclerosis in 
South Asians.103 The study investigators evaluated CIMT 
in South Asian patients with T2DM and found that the 
prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis (as detected by 
CIMT) among subjects with elevated Lp(a) (>20 mg/
dL) was significantly higher than in those with Lp(a) 
levels <20 mg/dL (26.9% versus 16.3%; P=0.003).103 
Furthermore, multiple logistic regression analyses of 
CIMT with other CVD risk factors showed that only 
age (P=0.010), LDL-C (P=0.032), and Lp(a) (P=0.021) 
were significantly associated with carotid atheroscle-
rosis. A study that reported a positive relationship be-
tween Lp(a) and clinical events evaluated young South 
Asian patients (<45 years of age) who had had MI and 
found that the mean Lp(a) level was 22.28±5.4 mg/dL 
in the affected patients versus 9.28±22.59 mg/dL in 
the unaffected control subjects.102 Another study eval-
uated Lp(a) levels in South Asian and Chinese Ameri-
cans compared with NHWs, as well as the relationship 
between Lp(a) and ASCVD outcomes in these popula-
tions.109 This study found that South Asian and NHW 
men had higher Lp(a) levels than Chinese men, with a 
trend toward similar associations in women. However, 
there was no association between higher Lp(a) levels 
and ASCVD events in South Asians, a fact the investi-
gators attributed to not having a sufficient number of 
outcomes to confirm this finding.
Plasma Lp(a) levels are very highly genetically con-
trolled (>90% of its variability can be explained by 
genetic variants within the gene). Undoubtedly, the 
frequencies of these genetic variants within different 
populations will largely determine Lp(a) levels, so differ-
ences between racial/ethnic groups can automatically 
be attributed to differences in the frequency of Lp(a) 
genetic variants that affect these levels.
Recent powerful mendelian randomization and 
other large studies strongly suggest a causal link be-
tween LDL, triglycerides, and Lp(a) and ASCVD, but 
not between HDL and ASCVD.110,111 These causal in-
ferences are important to keep in mind because they 
should apply to all racial/ethnic groups, including 
South Asians.
The ratio of apolipoprotein B100 to apolipoprotein AI 
can predict atherogenesis, and the increase in this ratio 
is more prevalent in South Asians compared with other 
ethnicities.112,113 The INTERHEART study found that the 
prevalence of an elevated ratio of apolipoprotein B100 
to apolipoprotein AI was higher among South Asians 
with MI compared with subjects from other countries 
(61.5% versus 48.3%, respectively).3
Hypertension
Hypertension is an important risk factor for the de-
velopment of CVD. In native South Asians, there is an 
increased risk of AMI in those with a history of hyper-
tension,3,89 and urbanization has had a negative impact 
on CVD risk factors.114 Reports have also shown worse 
coronary risk factors, including hypertension, in South 
Asians who migrate to the United Kingdom or Canada 
compared with native South Asians.71,84,86,87,115 In the 
United States, one of the most common CVD risk fac-
tors in South Asians is hypertension, with a prevalence 
of 43% in men and 35% in women in the MASALA 
study116 and an overall age-adjusted prevalence of 27% 
as shown in the NYC CHS (New York City Community 
Health Survey).117
The NYC CHS included a small cohort of South 
Asians with hypertension (n=144) compared with Chi-
nese (n=555) and NHWs (n=5987), and in this study, 
the South Asians with hypertension were younger, were 
more likely to be male, had a lower mean BMI, had a 
higher individual poverty level, and were less likely to 
speak English at home compared with NHW adults.117 
In the MASALA study, hypertension was associated 
with DM and prediabetes in Indians.118 In the NYC CHS, 
South Asians had a higher prevalence of self-reported 
use of antihypertensive medications and reported eat-
ing fewer servings of fruits and vegetables compared 
with NHWs.117 Dietary patterns can affect the develop-
ment of hypertension in South Asians, and those with a 
higher consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and 
nuts have been shown to have lower odds of develop-
ing hypertension.119 Contrary to the NYC CHS, in the 
California Health Interview Survey, South Asians with 
hypertension (n=1158) had 2.19 greater odds of be-
ing overweight/obese, but in agreement with the NYC 
CHS, they were more likely to be male.120 In addition, 
neighborhood environment and its association with hy-
pertension in South Asians have been examined. Higher 
perceived neighborhood social cohesion in South Asian 
women in the MASALA study was associated with 
decreased incidence of hypertension.121 Data on ideal 
blood pressure goals, optimal medication regimen, 
medication adherence, etc, are lacking for South Asians 
living in the United States.
Chronic Kidney Disease
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared 
with the general population are at a significantly el-
evated risk of developing subsequent CVD. There is a 
paucity of data on CKD in South Asians living in the 
United States. The National Kidney Foundation states 
that Asian Americans are at a higher risk for kidney dis-
ease and kidney failure compared with NHWs, and the 
high prevalence of DM and hypertension appears to be 
a contributing factor, among others.122 Studies in the 
United Kingdom reported that the prevalence of severe

CKD (stages 4–5) was higher in the South Asian group 
compared with NHWs,123,124 and among patients with 
CKD in Canada, Asians appeared to have faster disease 
progression compared with NHWs.125 A recent study126 
compared cross-sectional data of Indians living in the 
United States (MASALA study) with those living in India 
(Center for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South 
Asia study) and showed that the CKD prevalence rates 
among Indians were relatively similar in men living in 
US cities and those living in Indian cities; however, there 
was a higher prevalence of proteinuria in those living in 
US cities and an increased prevalence of low glomeru-
lar filtration rate of <60 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2 in those liv-
ing in Indian cities. In the case of Indian women, there 
were higher prevalence rates of CKD and albuminuria 
in those living in US cities but a slightly higher preva-
lence of glomerular filtration rate <60 mL·min−1·1.73 
m−2 in those living in Indian cities. The prevalence of 
CKD rises with age regardless of sex in Indians living in 
both US and Indian cities. The prevalence of hyperten-
sion was similar in Indians with CKD living in Indian or 
US cities, but there was a lower prevalence of DM in 
Indian patients with CKD living in US cities. Compared 
with patients with CKD living in US cities, those living 
in India were less likely to be treated with medications, 
and substantially fewer reached treatment goals for hy-
pertension (blood pressure <140/90 mm 
Hg) and T2DM 
(hemoglobin A1c <7.0 mmol/mol).126
Inflammation and Thrombosis
The risk of ASCVD in South Asians may be increased 
by a prothrombotic milieu made up of higher levels of 
homocysteine, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and 
Lp(a),6,93 along with a proinflammatory state,127 charac-
terized by higher levels of inflammatory markers such 
as CRP (C-reactive protein), leptin, interleukin-6, and 
tumor necrosis factor-α. The role of inflammation in the 
initiation, progression, and clinical sequelae of athero-
sclerosis is a subject of intense investigation. An increase 
in inflammation might contribute to the increased risk 
of ASCVD in the South Asian patient population.
Homocysteine has been identified as a risk factor 
for ASCVD in South Asians.128–130 Higher homocysteine 
levels are found among South Asians compared with 
NHWs in several countries.128,129,131 A possible explana-
tion for the higher homocysteine level in South Asians 
may be cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency. A small cohort 
study conducted in India found a very high prevalence 
of hyperhomocystinemia (>15 μmol/L) in 75% of South 
Asian subjects, which strongly correlated with a cobala-
min deficiency, with no difference between vegetarians 
and nonvegetarians.132 Despite this, studies of homocys-
teine lowering in other populations have not shown sig-
nificant cardiovascular benefit. For instance, the HOPE-2 
trial (second Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) ran-
domized subjects with preexisting CVD or DM to pla-
cebo or active treatment with folic acid and vitamin B. 
Despite lowering homocysteine levels by ≈25%, the ac-
tive treatment had no apparent benefit in reducing the 
cardiovascular events in the HOPE-2 study.133
High-sensitivity CRP has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. High-sensitivity CRP 
levels are also predictive of the development of DM 
and correlate with the number of abnormalities in 
MetS.134,135 Studies in South Asians have shown a posi-
tive association between CRP and ASCVD, which was 
previously attributed to the high prevalence of abdom-
inal obesity and insulin resistance in the South Asian 
population.136 A large multiethnic study in Canada ex-
amined CRP levels in 1250 adults of South Asian, Chi-
nese, European, and aboriginal ancestry.6 CRP levels 
were higher in South Asians than in Chinese and Euro-
peans, even after adjustment for metabolic factors. CRP 
was independently associated with ASCVD after adjust-
ment for Framingham risk factors, atherosclerosis, an-
thropometric measurements, and ethnicity, adding to 
the evidence that South Asians may have an underlying 
proinflammatory state contributing to their excess risk 
for ASCVD.127,129,136–138
In addition to CRP
, proinflammatory adipokines, in-
cluding tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, leptin, 
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, angiotensinogen, 
and resistin, have been proposed to link insulin resis-
tance to atherosclerosis.139,140 Adipose tissue is also the 
source of anti-inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic adi-
pokines, of which adiponectin is the best studied.141–143 
Numerous studies have suggested that altered adipo-
kine milieu may play a role in the increased vascular risk 
observed in South Asians.131,137,138 Abnormalities in the 
adiponectin-insulin sensitivity axis in nondiabetic South 
Asians have linked visceral adiposity to atherogenesis in 
this population. Adiponectin levels among South Asians 
have been shown to be lower compared with NHWs, 
with parallel increases in insulin resistance, impaired fi-
brinolysis, and altered endothelial function in the South 
Asian group.144 Thus, low adiponectin levels in non-
diabetic South Asians not only may reflect increased 
CVD risk but also may be linked to the development of 
DM.145 In addition, change in levels of adipokines may 
explain decreased insulin sensitivity among nondiabetic 
South Asians compared with other ethnicities.
Genetic Factors
Evolutionary Theories for the Genetic Predisposition to 
ASCVD and Related Risk Factors in South Asians
Differences in the prevalence of metabolic risk factors 
and CVD between South Asians and non–South Asian 
populations may be driven in part by differences in ge-
netic variation. This hypothesis is supported by data 
suggesting that an individual’s susceptibility to develop-
ing CVD-related metabolic traits and CVD is heritable to 
a substantial degree.146,147 Several conflicting theories

posit how our evolutionary past may have contributed 
to these ethnic differences, including the thrifty gene 
hypothesis (evolutionary consequence of positive selec-
tion for variations in genes that favor energy storage 
that were beneficial during times of famine),148,149 the 
drifty gene hypothesis (absence of positive selection on 
leanness),150 and a third theory149 that hypothesizes that 
descendants who migrated to cold regions acquired ge-
netic variants influencing genes for cold adaption that 
confer higher metabolic rates and resistance to obesi-
ty.149 Although there is no consensus on which theory 
is most scientifically plausible, more widescale genetic 
discovery efforts across ethnic subpopulations may help 
clarify which, if any, of these theories apply.
Current State of Understanding of the Genetics of 
ASCVD and Related Risk Factors in South Asians
Technological advances coupled with large human co-
hort studies have enabled genome-wide association 
studies (GWASs) and whole-exome and -genome se-
quencing studies91,151–160 that are elucidating the genet-
ic architecture of risk for CVD, DM, and obesity in the 
general population, as well as genetic risk factors and 
potential differences in susceptibility to these diseases 
in South Asians. Examples include a GWAS focused on 
identifying genetic variants for T2DM in 5561 South 
Asians with DM and 14 
458 control subjects with a 
large replication sample of South Asian ancestry, which 
identified common genetic variants at 6 new loci as be-
ing associated with DM (GRB14, ST6GAL1, VPS26A, 
HMG20A, AP3S2, and HNF4A)161; another GWAS of 
T2DM focused on Punjabi Sikhs from India also found 
novel associations.162
Such studies highlight the potential for novel ge-
netic discoveries in cardiometabolic diseases by focused 
studies in specific racial/ethnic populations. However, 
although variations across the genome and patterns 
within that variation are complex and different in these 
subgroups, the majority of studies have suggested that 
the underlying biological pathways are actually similar. 
Thus, although the genetics of CVD in ethnic subpop-
ulations can be characterized by allelic heterogeneity 
(in which different variants in the same genetic locus 
cause the same phenotype), the genes and resulting 
biology are common, with differences in risk reflecting 
differences in the frequency of casual variants in those 
genes. In obesity and T2DM, diseases epidemiologically 
enriched in South Asian populations, there is in fact lit-
tle or no evidence for the enrichment of disease genes 
in South Asians. For example, a recent study of WHR 
did not identify any novel genetic associations in South 
Asians and found that risk allele frequencies for known 
obesity loci were not enriched in South Asians compared 
with Europeans,163 arguing against population-specific 
genetic variants to explain the increased risk of central 
obesity in South Asians. Relatedly, a GWAS of T2DM 
found that some loci identified in European populations 
were not significantly associated with T2DM in South 
Asians but that 2 important T2DM loci (CDKAL1 and 
HHEX/IDE/KIF11) showed association, with evidence 
of locus and allelic heterogeneity.164 Furthermore, the 
most consistent association from GWASs of T2DM with 
common variants in the TCF7L2 gene has been repli-
cated in Indian Asian and other populations.165 Similar 
commonalities have been seen in ACVD: Variants in the 
chromosome 9p21 locus, the most consistent genetic 
finding for CVD in European populations, also are as-
sociated with CVD in a North Indian population,166 and 
another large GWAS for coronary artery disease con-
ducted in Europeans and South Asians found little evi-
dence for ancestry-specific associations.167
Of note, an interesting recent study further high-
lights the importance of studying different racial and 
ethnic subgroups. In this study, Saleheen et al168 se-
quenced the protein-coding regions of >10 
000 in-
dividuals within the PROMIS study (Pakistan Risk of 
Myocardial Infarction), made up of subpopulations 
with a high prevalence of consanguinity, and identified 
homozygous loss-of-function mutations and related 
phenotypes in many genes, including APOC3 (a gene 
harboring known mutations protective for coronary 
heart disease), thereby articulating a systemic survey 
of “human knockouts” through studying this unique 
population.
Future Directions to Better Understand Genetics 
and Molecular Factors for ASCVD in South Asian 
Populations
There is heterogeneity of the incidence of CVD and re-
lated metabolic risk factors, including DM and obesity, 
by ethnicity, the more pronounced effects on those dis-
ease traits being induced by urbanization. The known 
heritability of these disease traits strongly suggests an 
underlying genetic architecture to disease susceptibil-
ity with variation by racial/ethnic group. Elucidating this 
architecture in South Asians is an important compo-
nent to understanding the epidemiology of disease in 
this high-risk population and clarifying the most likely 
evolutionary theory to explain high disease rates. This 
will require more dedicated population-based studies 
with careful attention to population substructure, com-
parisons of effects across different ethnic groups, ex-
plicit evaluation of gene-environment interactions, and 
evaluation of molecular factors other than DNA-based 
“static” variation, including epigenetic effects, metabo-
lomics, and proteomics. In parallel, efforts need to be 
expanded to better understand population variation 
in the genome in South Asians. Resources such as the 
Indian Genome Variation Consortium project,169 Singa-
pore Genome Variation Project,170 and a recent study

genome sequencing in 168 South Asians, thus resulting

Nonbiological Mechanisms
Acculturation and Health Behaviors
Acculturation is defined as the adoption of the cus-
toms, beliefs, principles, and actions of 1 cultural group 
by members of a different cultural group. It has been 
hypothesized that 4 acculturation strategies exist: inte-
gration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization. 
Integration strategy involves one maintaining one’s 
own heritage and incorporating customs of the new 
culture. The assimilation strategy is the abandonment 
of one’s own heritage and adoption of the host culture. 
The separation strategy is the rejection of the new cul-
ture and maintenance of one’s own heritage, whereas 
in marginalization, the individual abandons both his or 
her own heritage and the host culture.172
South Asians participating in the MASALA study pro-
vide us with an estimate of the proportion of South 
Asians living in the United States who have adopted 
each of these acculturation strategies. More than half 
followed the integration strategy; about one quar-
ter followed the assimilation strategy; and one fifth 
 
followed the separation strategy. No individuals report-
ed adopting the marginalization strategy. Those indi-
viduals in the separation group had a strong desire for 
South Asian traditions (performing religious ceremo-
nies, fasting on specific occasions, living in joint family 
homes, using spices for health and healing, having an 
arranged marriage), eating South Asian food at home, 
grocery shopping at South Asian stores, and having 
South Asian friends. Those participants in the assimila-
tion group had a low desire for South Asian traditions 
and reported lower frequency of fasting and an equiva-
lent preference for foods and friends from South Asia 
and other ethnicities. Those individuals in the integra-
tion group had less desire for South Asian traditions 
compared with the separation group but more than 
the assimilation group. Those with no religious affilia-
tion, higher per-capita household income, greater per-
centage of life in the United States, and good spoken 
English were less likely to be in the separation strategy 
group compared with the integration and assimilation 
strategy groups.172 More research is necessary to bet-
ter understand the impact of acculturation strategies 
on cardiovascular health and outcomes in South Asian 
immigrants to the United States.
Acculturation in other migrant groups has been 
shown to be associated with poor health behaviors and 
higher rates of developing hypertension, DM, obesity, 
and CVD.173,174 A surrogate marker for acculturation is 
a longer duration of US residency, which in the MESA 
study was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in 
other ethnic groups.175–177 Similarly, a longer duration of 
residence in the United States has been associated with 
higher levels of CAC in South Asians from the MASALA 
study.178
An additional concept is biculturalism, which occurs 
when one affiliates not only with one’s own heritage 
but also with the culture of the host country. When bi-
culturalism has been indirectly assessed as fluency in 
native language and English in Asian Americans, it has 
been shown to be associated with lower rates of obesity 
as measured by BMI.179 In the MASALA study, there was 
a suggestion that most participants were acculturated 
because the majority had lived in the United States for 
≥20 years and spoke English. In an attempt to achieve 
a multidimensional approach to acculturation/bicultur-
alism, the MASALA study investigators created a tra-
ditional cultural beliefs scale using 7 questions. Those 
who had moderate scores on the traditional cultural 
beliefs scale were found to have decreased CIMT com-
pared with those with either higher or lower scores.178
The MASALA study also noted that as South Asians 
lived in the United States for longer periods of time, 
they tended to westernize their diets by incorporat-
ing more fat, alcohol, and red meat; however, those 
who consumed a vegetarian diet tended to have lower 
fasting glucose and improved HDL levels.76 The MA-
SALA study revealed that South Asian migrants have 
adopted the adverse dietary habits of Western coun-
tries, thereby substituting the suboptimal South Asian 
diet pattern (discussed in the following section) with a 
Western dietary pattern that is potentially even more 
deleterious.180
Diet
As South Asians have migrated to the United States, 
much of the dietary habit and patterns have reflected 
a combination of traditional cultural cuisines and ac-
culturation to the developed Western world. Among 
all US Asians, South Asians have the highest rates 
of truncal obesity, which is linked in part to dietary 
choices.181 Dietary habits have a tremendous impact 
on the primary prevention of and reduction in the 
risk of development of ASCVD, as well as reducing 
risk for recurrence after a cardiovascular event.182,183 
The South Asian diet typically has a high percentage 
of carbohydrates and saturated fats, often consist-
ing of lentils, vegetables, rice, meats, and chapatis or 
breads.184 Many South Asians adopt a vegetarian diet 
for religious or cultural reasons, and this often leads 
to an absence of lean meats and an increase of fats 
and carbohydrates in their diets.185 In addition, the po-
tential for cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency increases 
in those consuming a vegetarian diet.132 The MASALA 
study specifically investigated dietary patterns and

demonstrated 2 distinct dietary patterns among South 
Asians in the United States: a distinct Western pattern 
that incorporated dairy products, fried snacks, pizza, 
and potatoes and a vegetarian diet that included high 
amounts of snacks, rice, and sugar-sweetened bever-
ages.76 Within this same cohort, diets high in animal 
protein had an association with increased abdominal 
size and total cholesterol.76 Although dietary choices 
and their social and cultural relationships for South 
Asians in the United States are integrally linked, the 
literature on this subject is somewhat limited. Often, 
for immigrants, food from native countries provides a 
source of cultural bonds among individuals.186 There-
fore, specific targeted interventions to change dietary 
choices to reduce the risk of ASCVD must take into 
account the strong link between cuisine and home 
culture. One possible approach is the reintroduction 
of traditional whole grains into the diet, which were 
more common in the South Asian diet in the early 
1900s.187,188 In this regard, prospective studies and 
coaching programs are being implemented to try to 
mitigate CVD risk among South Asians.189
Physical Activity
Lack of physical activity is a significant risk factor for 
many chronic diseases. A strong association exists be-
tween inactivity and insulin resistance, CVD, T2DM, 
cancer, anxiety, and obesity.190 A low level of physical 
activity is independently associated with the develop-
ment of DM among South Asians.191 There is a dose-
response relationship between physical activity and 
physical fitness192 and positive health outcomes. How-
ever, this relationship may not be identical across eth-
nic groups.193 South Asians have low physical activity 
rates compared with other racial/ethnic minorities, and 
in 1 cohort, only 52% of participants met the recom-
mended guidelines through leisure-time physical activ-
ity as measured by accelerometers.194 Furthermore, the 
average number of daily steps was 6904, which is in 
the “low active” classification of the number of recom-
mended daily steps. There are few data on specific lev-
els or types of physical activity performed on a routine 
basis by South Asian individuals in the United States. 
Specific reasons as to why South Asians in the United 
States tend to be less active than other ethnicities are 
not well elucidated. There is a definite knowledge gap 
in the understanding of the importance of exercise and 
physical activity in the prevention of CVD. In fact, when 
270 South Asians were asked what factors were impor-
tant for coronary heart disease prevention, only 49% 
stated that exercising was important.195 A study exam-
ining the physical activity environments of patients with 
coronary heart disease in Canada found that South 
Asian patients had lower availability of home exercise 
equipment and perceived convenience of local physi-
cal activity facilities but better and safer neighborhood 
environments compared with NHW patients.196 Many 
studies in the United Kingdom have documented lower 
physical activity levels197–201 and lower cardiorespiratory 
fitness69 among South Asians. Increasing the aware-
ness of the importance of physical activity in a high-risk 
group like South Asians in the United States could po-
tentially reduce the risk of development of future CVD.

Tobacco use is a major modifiable risk factor for CVD 
and has been shown to be the most important risk 
factor associated with AMI.3,89 Tobacco in all forms 
(cigarettes, bidis, and chewable tobacco) is associated 
with an increased risk of AMI.202 In South Asians, the 
prevalence rates of smoking are much lower in wom-
en compared with men.3 Rates of tobacco use are very 
high in India, with ≈14% of women and 47% of men 
either smoking or chewing tobacco.203 Men in South 
Asia typically smoke cigarettes or bidis or chew tobac-
co leaves, whereas women are more likely to chew 
tobacco and less likely to smoke.204 US data show simi-
lar or lower rates of tobacco use in South Asian men 
compared with the general population and low rates 
of cigarette smoking in South Asian women. In South 
Asians in the United States, smoking prevalence was 
low in the MASALA study, with only ≈5% of men and 
≈1% of women reported as smokers.116 Although the 
number of first-generation female South Asian smok-
ers constituted only a small proportion of the total 
South Asian women, they represented nearly half of 
the total South Asian female cigarette smokers.205
Exploratory research with focus groups has demon-
strated the use of numerous culturally specific tobac-
co products among South Asians living in the United 
States, including smoked (bidi, hookah) and smoke-
less (gutkha, naswar, paan, paan masal, zarda) prod-
ucts. There are also inaccuracies in knowledge of CVD 
risks and misperceptions of the health effects of these 
tobacco products. In addition, South Asians cite the 
importance of using culturally specific products at cel-
ebrations and social functions as a means to express 
hospitality to other South Asians and maintenance of 
their heritage to outsiders, that is, ethnic expression of 
being a South Asian.206,207 The use of culturally specific 
tobacco products (smoked or smokeless) is high.208,209 
Community-based efforts are necessary to educate 
South Asians on the health risks of tobacco products, 
and strong emphasis needs to be placed on interven-
tions to reduce the use of smoked and smokeless to-
bacco products.210,211
Social, Psychological, and Environmental Factors
Studies have indicated an association between ASCVD 
and social, psychosocial, and environmental factors, 
including social support, stress, depression, optimism, 
and neighborhood residence.212–222 However, there is a 
paucity of studies that focus on the association of these

factors with heart disease risk for South Asians, particu-
larly in the United States.
The INTERHEART study reported that measures of 
depression and stress at work or home were among 
9 modifiable risk factors that accounted for most of 
the population-attributable risk for AMI in native South 
Asians.3 Adverse psychosocial factors (depression and 
stress at work or home) were strongly associated with 
increased risk of AMI in native South Asians (OR, 2.62; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76–3.90 for partici-
pants from South Asia; OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.58–2.13 
for participants from other countries; P=0.03). Psycho-
social factors were significantly associated with AMI 
for both sexes in native South Asians, but the popu-
lation-attributable risk associated with psychosocial 
stress or depression was significantly higher for women 
(P=0.005).
A cross-sectional study of 894 South Asian men and 
women from the MASALA study investigated the asso-
ciation of psychosocial factors, including anger, anxiety, 
depressive symptoms, current and chronic stress, and 
everyday hassles, with CIMT.223 The results showed that 
the impact of psychosocial factors on subclinical ath-
erosclerosis differed for South Asian men and women. 
For women, current life stress and life stress reported 
over the past 6 months were positively associated with 
common CIMT after adjustment for age, traditional 
CVD risk factors, diet, and physical activity. Women 
with high and chronic stress had lower social support, 
less exercise time, and higher BMI. Among men, anxi-
ety and depressive symptoms were positively associated 
with common CIMT in analyses that adjusted for age 
and traditional CVD risk factors, but after adjustment 
for diet and physical activity, only anxiety remained a 
significant predictor of common CIMT. Men with high 
anxiety and depressive symptoms reported significantly 
less physical activity, spent more time watching televi-
sion, and had lower levels of social support. The study 
did not find an independent association between so-
cial support and CIMT, nor did social support mediate 
or moderate the association of psychological variables 
with CIMT. The mechanism by which these factors may 
affect carotid wall thickness remains unclear, and ad-
ditional research is needed to elucidate the complex 
relationships between psychosocial factors and athero-
sclerosis and to identify potential risk-reduction inter-
ventions that limit the progression of atherosclerosis in 
this population.
In summary, the current literature shows that South 
Asians face disadvantages across a range of psychoso-
cial factors, including chronic stressors, psychological 
characteristics, and protective social factors, which are 
thought to be associated with ASCVD risk and prog-
nosis. Additional prospective studies are needed to ex-
plore these factors as indicators of ASCVD risk for this 
population already at increased risk for ASCVD.
Health Services
The availability and receipt of health services repre-
sent critical components of the clinical management 
of patients with ASCVD.224 Understanding potential 
differences in the availability and use of health ser-
vices among racial/ethnic minority groups is important 
to ensure comparable quality of care among cardiac 
patients.225,226 Data on health service use patterns of 
South Asians are limited, particularly in US populations.
A study conducted in the United Kingdom found 
that among 672 patients (156 South Asian, 516 
white) who underwent PCI for ST-segment–elevation 
MI, South Asians were more likely to have longer pre-
hospital and posthospital delays, resulting in longer 
overall hospital delays (median, 314 minutes; inter-
quartile range, 195–679 minutes), compared with 
whites (median, 240 minutes; interquartile range, 
182–468 minutes).227 In multivariate analysis, South 
Asian ethnicity was an independent predictor of post-
hospital delay (arrival time to intervention; P=0.006). 
A prospective study of 150 330 patients (118 323 
classified as white, 5486 classified as Asian, and 
26 521 unclassified) who presented to the emergency 
department with chest pain in hospitals in England 
and Wales found that South Asian patients were less 
likely to arrive by ambulance than NHW patients (OR, 
0.64; 95% CI, 0.60–0.69) in age- and sex-adjusted 
analyses, regardless of diagnosis (MI, acute coronary 
syndrome, and other chest pain).228 This difference 
was more marked for women (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 
0.49–0.66) compared with men (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.61–0.73; P for ethnicity and sex interaction=0.05). 
There was no evidence of delay in the receipt of 
thrombolysis after hospital arrival in South Asians. 
South Asians were more likely to receive thromboly-
sis (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.10–1.30), particularly if they 
had nonspecific changes on the ECG (OR, 1.84; 95% 
CI, 1.55–2.18). In analyses stratified by sex, the ethnic 
differences were larger for men than for women, sug-
gesting a lower threshold for giving therapy to South 
Asian men with chest pain. A major limitation of this 
study was that Asians were grouped together and the 
UK investigators assumed that most of the patients in 
the Asian group were South Asians.
Studies show differences in the receipt and outcomes 
of cardiac procedures, indicating that South Asians re-
ceive angiography and revascularization procedures 
less often but have better survival outcomes after these 
procedures compared with other patients.229–231 Among 
7794 patients (2189 South Asians, 5605 NHWs) with 
recent-onset chest pain in the United Kingdom, more 
South Asian patients had atypical chest pain than 
NHWs (59.9% versus 52.5%; P<0.001).232 South Asian 
patients were less likely than NHW patients to receive 
angiography for typical or atypical symptoms (HR, 0.52; 
95% CI, 0.41–0.67 for typical symptoms; HR, 0.59;

dian provinces that included 3061 South Asian, 1473 
Chinese, and 77 
314 other Canadian patients found 
that South Asians were less likely to undergo revascu-
larization (PCI or coronary artery bypass graft; HR, 0.94; 
95% CI, 0.90–0.98) compared with other Canadian 
patients during 10.5 years of follow-up after coronary 
angiography among patients with ASCVD.231 There was 
no significant difference in 30-day risk-adjusted mor-
tality (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.98–1.62) compared with 
other Canadians, but South Asians had a better survival 
of up to 10.5 years (risk-adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 
0.63–0.93) that persisted in analyses stratified by sex, 
age, and status of revascularization. A study from the 
United Kingdom consisting of 279 
256 patients under-
going PCI from 2004 to 2011 (259 
318 whites, 19 
938 
South Asians) found that South Asians were younger 
and had more CVD risk factors, particularly DM, and 
more multivessel coronary disease than NHWs; there 
was no difference in risk-adjusted mortality for a me-
dian follow-up period of 2.8 years (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 
0.94–1.05).229 A retrospective cohort study of 41 
615 
patients with a diagnosis of AMI (2190 South Asians, 
946 Chineses, 38 
479 NHWs) treated in Canada report-
ed that South Asians compared to NHWs were more 
likely to undergo cardiac catheterization within 30 days 
(HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.16–1.52) and had a 35% lower 
relative risk of mortality over a median of 3.2 years (HR, 
0.65; 95% CI, 0.57–0.72); there was no difference in 
the receipt of revascularization.230 A meta-analysis of 12 
populations (14 
531 South Asians with 1591 coronary 
events, 274 
977 NHW patients with 63 
758 coronary 
events) found that South Asians were more likely to re-
ceive revascularization (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.24–1.81) 
and had a better prognosis (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74–
0.82) compared with NHWs.233
Cardiac rehabilitation is considered an important 
component of care for cardiac patients; however, it is 
commonly underused by patients.234–236 Two qualita-
tive studies explored potential barriers for participation 
among South Asian patients in the United Kingdom 
and Canada.237,238 A UK study with 20 cardiac patients 
(12 Pakistani, 6 Indian, and 2 Bangladeshi)237 reported 
that the patients had a limited understanding of their 
diagnosis, had cardiac misconceptions, reported nega-
tive experiences with healthcare services, valued social 
networks in accessing care, had fatalistic health beliefs, 
and cited religious reasons and cultural expectations 
(eg, mixed-sex classes were a problem for women), 
which were potential barriers.237 Reasons for nonat-
tendance included the setting and timing of classes, 
language barrier, transportation problems, and poor 
understanding of cardiac rehabilitation. A second study 
among 16 South Asian patients in Canada238 reported 
4 key themes, including the importance of predischarge 
discussions about cardiac rehabilitation with care pro-
viders, knowledge about the comprehensive nature of 
services available in cardiac rehabilitation programs, the 
importance of referrals and postdischarge follow-up by 
the rehabilitation program, and the need for personal 
autonomy in deciding to attend the cardiac rehabilita-
tion program.238
Future research is needed to understand the factors 
that may influence healthcare practices for this popu-
lation in the United States, including potential referral 
bias, appropriateness of procedures, patient preferenc-
es, and shared decision making for treatment options.
INTERVENTIONS IN THE UNITED 
STATES
Clinical Utility of Risk Assessment Tools
Although several population-specific risk assessment 
tools exist (Table 1), none of the currently available 
models are derived from or prospectively validated in 
US South Asians.239 The traditional tools that are used 
include the Framingham Risk Score, AHA/American Col-
lege of Cardiology pooled cohort equation, Prospective 
Cardiovascular Munster Score, Systemic Coronary Risk 
Evaluation, and FINRISK (Finland Cardiovascular Risk 
Study) risk calculator.240 However, it is well recognized 
that all of these calculators have limitations and under-
estimate CVD risk in South Asians because they have 
not been derived from or validated in this higher-risk 
group. In fact, investigators who developed the AHA/
American College of Cardiology pooled cohort equa-
tion predicting the risk of a first ASCVD event acknowl-
edged the possible underestimation of risk in certain 
populations, including South Asians.241,238b
Age is a driving factor in the estimation of absolute 
risk in most risk scores, and thus, South Asians tend 
to have lower scores, although they have multiple risk 
factors at younger ages.239 This situation has led some 
to advocate for a correction factor to be applied to the 
Framingham Risk Score to account for the higher risk of 
disease in South Asians by multiplying the score by 1.4 
to 1.5.242,243
In the United Kingdom, the QRISK2 (the most re-
cent version of the QRISK calculator, which estimates 
the risk of getting CVD over a lifetime using the risk 
factors of smoking, BMI, cholesterol/HDL ratio, and sys-
tolic blood pressure) algorithm has been derived and 
validated in 2.3 million people to accurately estimate 
cardiovascular risk in different ethnic groups in England 
and Wales. Unlike previous calculators, it counts South 
Asian ethnicity as an additional risk factor, and median 
scores for South Asians are higher than those of oth-
er tools. QRISK2 may still underestimate risk in South 
Asian women, but it may have a more reasonable risk

prediction in men.244,245 The ETHRISK (web-based risk 
calculator that attempts to improve estimates of risk in 
black and minority ethnic groups for practical use in 
primary prevention) risk calculator is a modified version 
of the Framingham CVD risk assessment tool that has 
been designed for UK ethnic groups. It uses the preva-
lence ratios for CVD for each ethnic group compared 
with the general population and adjusts for differences 
in mean risk factor levels and prevalence of smoking 
between each ethnic group. The UKPDS risk engine is a 
T2DM-specific risk calculator based on the UK Prospec-
tive Diabetes Study246 that also takes ethnicity into ac-
count as a factor in the calculation.
Similar risk assessment tools to estimate CVD risk 
in different ethnic groups have yet to be developed 
and validated in the United States. However, further 
validation of the AHA/American College of Cardiology 
pooled cohort equation in subjects enrolled in the MA-
SALA study may be possible in the future as CVD events 
accrue in this cohort over time.116
Several barriers to developing an accurate risk pre-
diction tool remain, including that the ethnicity of the 
South Asian population is quite heterogeneous, com-
prising populations from 7 countries with different 
lifestyles; that there are certain subsets who have no 
published prospective data and thus World Health Or-
ganization risk prediction charts are the best we have247; 
and that perhaps incorporating novel risk factors may 
improve the accuracy of the existing prediction tools. 
Ultimately, accurate risk prediction will require integra-
tion of ethnicity into our current calculators. Among 
the currently available calculators, for South Asians, 
QRISK2 might be more appropriate for risk calculation 
because it integrates South Asian ethnicity, although 
with the caveat that it has been developed on the basis 
of a South Asian population in the United Kingdom. 
Alternately, a tool specific for South Asians accounting 
for ethnic variations should be developed and validated 
in this population.
Physical Activity and Diet
As detailed in the earlier sections, poor diet, lack of 
physical activity, obesity, and T2DM are some of the 
risk factors that significantly contribute to the increased 
risk for ASCVD in South Asians living in South Asian 
countries, as well as migrant South Asian populations 
in the United States and other countries, compared 
with other racial or ethnic groups.3,248,249 In light of this 
evidence, studies implementing lifestyle interventions 
in South Asian populations have used strategies to ad-
dress some or many of these ASCVD risk factors.
Similar to the approaches used in studies on migrant 
South Asian populations in Europe249–251 and Canada,252 
the interventions in the United States reported to date 
have also focused on diet modifications and measures 
to improve physical activity in the migrant South Asian 
populations. A study reported that intervention with a 
calorie-restricted, relatively low-carbohydrate diet for 
3 months resulted in weight loss and improved insu-
lin sensitivity and associated CVD risk factors in over-
weight, insulin-resistant South Asian Indian women 
living in the United States.253 Another randomized 
crossover study tested the effect of a combined therapy 
with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements 
and rosuvastatin in South Asian subjects with dyslipid-
emia living in the New York metropolitan area.254 The 
results revealed improvements in the lipid profile and 
indexes of endothelial function such as brachial artery 
ultrasound measures of endothelium-dependent vaso-
dilation.254 Two separate studies in Korean Americans255 
and Sikh Asian Indians living in New York City256 at risk 
for DM incorporated culturally tailored Diabetes Pre-
vention Program approaches and investigated the ef-
fect of 6-month-long interventions led by community 
health workers to improve nutrition and physical activ-
ity, combined with counseling on stress, DM preven-
tion, and complications of DM and CVD. The interven-
tions resulted in beneficial changes in clinical variables 
(BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glu-
cose, and cholesterol) and health behaviors (physical 
activity, food behaviors, and DM knowledge) in these 
populations.255,256 Similarly, a culturally adapted ver-
sion of the Diabetes Prevention Program257 has been

successfully used in South Asian diabetics in India,258 
although the lifestyle interventions had a more mod-
est effect in reducing DM risk in the South Asians in 
India. CURE-D (Culturally Relevant Exercise for Type 2 
Diabetes) was a randomized controlled study in South 
Asian women with DM in the San Francisco Bay area 
that implemented a twice-weekly, 8-week-long exer-
cise intervention consisting of Bollywood dancing.259 
The results of this study revealed statistically significant 
reductions in body weight and hemoglobin A1c levels in 
the intervention group compared with women in the 
control group who received usual care.259 The SAHELI 
study (South Asian Heart Lifestyle Intervention) was 
conducted in partnership with the Chicago Metropoli-
tan Asian Family Services and Northwestern University 
in a small population of South Asian immigrants at 
risk for ASCVD.260 The intervention involved interactive 
group classes focused on increased physical activity, 
healthful diet, and weight and stress management for 
a period of 6 months, which resulted in a significant 
weight loss and a greater sex-adjusted decrease in he-
moglobin A1c.260 Another single-arm intervention study 
by the same investigators similarly used the community-
academic partnership model to implement a 16-week-
long twice-a-week exercise regimen and healthy eat-
ing intervention in South Asian mothers at risk for DM 
and demonstrated significant weight loss and multiple 
physical and psychosocial benefits in the participants.261 
It is also noteworthy that modern technology has been 
successfully used in studies of South Asian population 
health in the United States and other countries. This 
includes web-based data collection tools261 and mobile 
phone text messaging approaches to ensure adherence 
to improved lifestyle modifications.189,262
As illustrated by these studies, tailored interventions 
that take cultural context into account appear to be 
the best approach for ensuring the success of both di-
etary and physical activity interventions in South Asian 
populations.263 For example, incorporation of nutrition-
ally advantageous ancient whole grains as carbohy-
drate substitutes may be more culturally acceptable for 
South Asians,188 as would be culturally relevant physi-
cal activity interventions.252,259 In addition, the role of 
perceived barriers to healthy diet, physical activity, be-
havioral modifications,264,265 acculturative stressors,265 
and other cultural/dietary behavior patterns unique to 
immigrants187 needs to be recognized and addressed to 
achieve the goal of significant ASCVD risk reduction in 
this high-risk population.
Medications for CVD Management in 
South Asians
Statin Therapy
Data on the impact of South Asian ethnicity on the re-
sponse to medications used for CVD primary or sec-
ondary prevention are scarce. A consensus statement 
on dyslipidemia management in South Asian subjects 
was recently published.267 LDL-C–lowering therapy with 
statins is the mainstay in the pharmacological treatment 
of hypercholesterolemia in South Asians, with a sug-
gested LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL in high-risk patients 
and <70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients according to 
this consensus statement.267 However, because of the 
paucity of primary data in South Asian populations, 
the vast majority of recommendations in this state-
ment were extrapolated from Western guidelines, and 
treatment goals were derived from studies performed 
mostly in NHW populations.267
The 2013 American College of Cardiology/AHA 
“Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to 
Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults” 
identified 4 statin benefit groups and made recommen-
dations for the use of high-intensity and moderate-in-
tensity statin therapy in secondary and primary preven-
tion.22 The estimates of 10-year risk for ASCVD were 
based on data from multiple community-based popula-
tions and are applicable to black and NHW men and 
women 40 through 79 years of age. The recommenda-
tion for other ethnic groups was to use the equations 
for NHWs, although the writing group acknowledged 
that the estimates may underestimate the risk for in-
dividuals from some racial/ethnic groups, especially 
American Indians, some Asian Americans (eg, of south 
Asian ancestry), and some Hispanics (eg, Puerto Ricans), 
and may overestimate the risk for others, including 
some Asian Americans (eg, of east Asian ancestry) and 
some Hispanics (eg, Mexican Americans).238b
The HOPE-3 trial included India as one of the many 
study sites. It was found that in an ethnically diverse 
intermediate-risk population without CVD, treatment 
with rosuvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/d resulted in a sig-
nificantly lower risk of cardiovascular events than pla-
cebo.268 However, more specific data on South Asians 
and Indian population would be helpful.
Lipid guidelines have recommended the use of lower 
statin doses in all Asians269; however, whether this also 
applies to South Asians, a population at high risk for 
ASCVD, was unclear. One study evaluated the lipid-
modifying effects of statins in South Asian and NHW 
patients with established ASCVD and found similar 
reductions in LDL-C and increases in HDL-C in South 
Asians and NHWs.270 The findings suggested that South 
Asian patients should be treated with statin therapy at 
doses that would be prescribed to NHW patients and 
have been confirmed by other similar studies.271,272
Head-to-head comparisons of different statins in 
South Asians have demonstrated that both rosuvastatin 
and atorvastatin are well tolerated and effective in this 
population. The IRIS trial (Investigation of Rosuvastatin 
in South Asians) randomized South Asians residing in 
the United States and Canada to either rosuvastatin or

atorvastatin (10 or 20 mg/d) for 6 weeks.273 The results 
showed that LDL-C levels decreased by 45% with ro-
suvastatin 10 mg versus 40% with atorvastatin 10 mg 
(P=0.002) and by 50% with rosuvastatin 20 mg versus 
47% with atorvastatin 20 mg (P=NS).
Combination Drug Therapy
Ezetimibe is a nonstatin medication that lowers plasma 
levels of LDL-C by inhibiting the activity of the NPC1L1 
(Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) protein, resulting in reduced 
intestinal cholesterol absorption. In IMPROVE-IT (Im-
proved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy Inter-
national Trial), the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin 
further reduced LDL-C levels by ≈24% compared with 
simvastatin monotherapy in a population of predomi-
nantly NHW patients stabilized within 10 days after an 
acute coronary syndrome.274 In this study, the addition 
of ezetimibe to simvastatin resulted in a significant 2% 
absolute reduction (HR, 0.936; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99; 
P=0.016) in the composite of cardiovascular death, ma-
jor coronary event, or stroke compared with placebo af-
ter 7 years.274 Stitziel275 sequenced the exons of NPC1L1 
in 7364 patients (844 South Asians) with ASCVD and 
14 
728 control subjects (1107 South Asians). Naturally 
occurring mutations that disrupt NPC1L1 function were 
found to be associated with reduced plasma LDL-C lev-
els and a reduced risk for ASCVD in individuals with var-
ious ethnic backgrounds, including South Asians. This 
finding suggested that inhibitory drugs such as ezeti-
mibe could reduce LDL-C levels in South Asians similar 
to other populations. In another study, ezetimibe and 
statin combination therapy was examined in 64 South 
Asian Canadians with ASCVD or DM and persistent hy-
percholesterolemia on statin therapy.276 Patients were 
randomized to receive ezetimibe 10 mg/d coadmin-
istered with statin therapy or a doubling of their cur-
rent statin dose. At 6 weeks, the proportion of patients 
achieving target LDL-C (<77 mg/dL) was significantly 
higher among patients treated with the ezetimibe and 
statin compared with those on the doubled statin dose 
(68% versus 36%, respectively; P=0.031) with an OR 
of 3.97 (95% CI, 1.19–13.18), accounting for base-
line LDL-C levels and adjusting for age. At 12 weeks, 
76% of patients receiving ezetimibe-statin combination 
achieved target LDL-C compared with 48% of the pa-
tients in whom the statin dose was doubled (adjusted 
OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.01–10.89; P=0.047). No serious 
adverse effects were recorded; however, this was a rela-
tively small study, and further comparative studies on 
combination therapy specifically in South Asian popula-
tions are needed.276
Two combination therapy trials of simvastatin with 
niacin in patients with CVD failed to show benefit be-
yond simvastatin: AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Inter-
vention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High 
Triglycerides and Impact on Global Health Outcomes)277 
and HPS-2 THRIVE (Second Heart Protection Study).278 
Despite favorable effects on HDL-C, triglycerides, LDL-
C, and Lp(a), these studies did not demonstrate in-
cremental clinical benefit with niacin. No South Asian 
studies have been conducted on the effects of niacin on 
cardiovascular outcomes, and such studies are unlikely 
to be conducted because a meta-analysis of trials using 
niacin has shown its lack of benefit beyond statins even 
in patients with dyslipidemia from MetS.279
Fibrates
Fibrates have also been studied in a number of trials, ei-
ther alone or in combination with statin therapy. Statins 
primarily target LDL-C; fibrates preferentially increase 
HDL-C, lower triglycerides, and increase the size of 
LDL-C particles, which may be particularly beneficial for 
South Asians. The 2 major studies, the FIELD trial (Fe-
nofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes) 
and the ACCORD trial (Action to Control Cardiovascular 
Risk in Diabetes), enrolled predominantly NHWs (84% 
and 91%, respectively).280 Although the composite end 
point of nonfatal MI and death caused by ASCVD did 
not improve with the addition of fenofibrate, it was 
found to significantly lower the risk of nonfatal MI and 
coronary revascularization in the FIELD study. The AC-
CORD trial found no benefits on CVD outcomes when 
fenofibrate was added to simvastatin versus simvastatin 
monotherapy in >5000 diabetic subjects over 5 years, 
despite increasing HDL-C and reducing triglycerides.281 
No outcomes trial of fenofibrate has been conducted 
specifically in South Asians in the United States.
Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 
Inhibitors
More recently, clinical trials have suggested that en-
hancing LDL receptor function by targeting PCSK9 
(proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), a serine 
protease that promotes the degradation of LDL recep-
tor, may provide a highly effective approach to lower-
ing LDL-C and Lp(a) levels in humans. The FOURIER trial 
(Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 
Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) demonstrated 
that the addition of evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor, to 
statin therapy over several years significantly reduced 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in predomi-
nantly NHW patients with clinically evident ASCVD.282 
Although there are currently no specific data in South 
Asians, combination therapy with PCSK9 inhibition ap-
pears promising to target the various dyslipidemias in 
this high-risk population.
Prospective studies with a larger South Asian sample 
size and longer follow-up period are needed to accu-
rately assess the efficacy and safety profile of these 
agents in South Asian populations. Data are needed 
to assess whether the use of combination therapy 
improves cardiovascular outcomes in the South Asian 
patient population, given their high prevalence of ath-

Other Drugs
Diabetic Drugs
The pathophysiology of T2DM may be influenced by 
ethnicity in terms of defects in insulin secretion and 
insulin resistance.283,284 South Asians exhibit increased 
insulin resistance compared with NHWs, and the differ-
ence in the pathophysiology of T2DM could influence 
the responses to antidiabetic drugs. The initiative by the 
South Asian Federation of Endocrine Societies suggests 
that, on the basis of efficacy, pleiotropic benefits, safe-
ty, and low costs, sulfonylureas should be considered 
as drugs of choice for the treatment of DM in South 
Asians living in South Asia.285 However, some observa-
tions suggest that South Asians may exhibit a better 
response to incretin-based therapies such as dipepti-
dyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 
analogs compared with commonly used drugs such as 
sulfonylureas and metformin.286 To propose modalities 
of treatment in a flexible manner suitable to the Indian 
population, the India Diabetes Management Algorithm 
Proposal Group has put forward an algorithm for the 
management of DM in Asian Indians, taking into ac-
count factors specifically relevant to South Asians in In-
dia such as early onset, occurrence in nonobese people, 
increased insulin resistance, differences in β-cell func-
tion, ethnic dietary practices (high-carbohydrate diet), 
and low socioeconomic status.287 Pharmacogenomic 
studies to understand genetic contributions to indi-
vidual variability in response to hypoglycemic drugs are 
needed to optimize the appropriate therapeutic regi-
men for South Asians with DM.
Hypertension and Heart Failure Drugs
Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
with medications such as angiotensin-converting en-
zyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers con-
trols hypertension and is the established therapeutic 
approach for heart failure resulting from systolic and 
diastolic dysfunction.288–291 The limited information 
available suggests that South Asians respond to these 
antihypertensive drugs in a manner similar to NHWs.292 
Most of the data on these medications were obtained 
from NHW populations, and increased representation 
of South Asians is needed in future studies evaluating 
traditionally used and newer heart failure medications.
Medication Adherence
Given the disproportionately high rate of ASCVD-relat-
ed morbidity and mortality in the South Asian popula-
tion, adherence to medications is critical to the effec-
tiveness of CVD risk management. A systematic review 
of CVD medication adherence in native and immigrant 
South Asian patients noted that the primary factors 
related to nonadherence were both unintentional and 
intentional. Thus, successful interventions aimed at im-
proving adherence in this population must address both 
mechanisms. A review of use and adherence to cardio-
vascular medications shows that adherence is quite 
low in studies conducted in the native countries of the 
South Asians.91
A Canadian study of adherence to medications after 
an acute AMI showed that Chinese and South Asian 
patients were less likely to adhere to commonly pre-
scribed medications compared with their non-Asian 
counterparts.293
Multiple studies have been performed in Cana-
da,293–297 the United Kingdom,298 and Asia91 to exam-
ine the use and adherence to cardiac medications in 
South Asians, but few studies have been performed in 
the United States. One study in the United States that 
included South Asians is a prospective, observational 
study: the REACH registry (Reduction of Atherothrom-
bosis for Continued Health). REACH enrolled 49 
602 
outpatients with ASCVD, cerebrovascular disease, and/
or peripheral arterial disease from 7 predefined ethnic/
racial groups, NHW, Hispanic, East Asian, South Asian, 
other Asian, black, and other races (including any race 
distinct from those specified), and found that medica-
tion use was similar in all ethnic groups.299
Variations in the Metabolism of Cardiac 
Medications
Ethnicity is known to account in part for interindividual 
variability in the pharmacodynamics and pharmacoki-
netics of medications, including cardiometabolic drugs; 
these differences translate into variability in efficacy 
and side-effect profiles between ethnic subgroups. Al-
though clinical factors such as diet, concomitant medi-
cations, and age are partially related to this variability, a 
significant proportion can be related to the underlying 
genetic differences between ethnic subgroups in drug 
metabolism pathways.300 In fact, the US Food and Drug 
Administration has published a guidance document 
that details situations for drugs that could have differ-
ential effects by ethnicity.301
Genetic polymorphisms in key proteins can reside in 
1 of 4 key pathways related to drug effects: pharmaco-
kinetic pathways (ie, in drug-metabolizing enzymes that 
control absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimi-
nation of a drug and thus affect drug concentration), 
pharmacodynamic pathways (affecting interaction be-
tween the drug and its target), pathways related to the 
disease process (ie, not directly affecting the drug but 
affecting the underlying disease process, which then 
modifies the drug effect), and off-target pathways (ie, 
idiosyncratic responses). Genetic variants in pharmaco-
kinetic pathways are some of the most common phar-
macogenetic effects, and many show differences across

ethnic subgroups. Although a comprehensive review is 
beyond the scope of this document, it is important to 
highlight that these differences exist and to note a few 
key examples.
For example, it is well established that genetic poly-
morphisms in CYP2C19 influence the metabolism of 
many drugs, including clopidogrel, with clear effects on 
platelet responsiveness to this medication, depending 
on the underlying genetic milieu of this gene. These 
genetic polymorphisms vary by frequency in ethnic sub-
groups and result in ethnic differences in “clopidogrel 
resistance.” For example, the most common CYP2C19 
loss-of-function allele (which results in reduced clopi-
dogrel metabolism and thus lower effective doses of 
the active drug that is converted by CYPC19 from the 
prodrug) is the *2 allele (c.681G>A; rs4244285), which 
has allele frequencies of 35% in South and Central 
Asians, 29% in East Asians, but only 15% in Euro-
pean and African subgroups. CYP2C19*3 (c.636G>A; 
rs4986893) has a frequency of 2% in South and Cen-
tral Asian populations, 9% in East Asian populations, 
but <1% in European and African populations.302 This 
genetic milieu is then used to classify individuals into 
groups of extensive, intermediate, or poor metaboliz-
ers. The frequencies of CYP2C19 poor metabolizers are 
2% to 5% in whites and Africans but 15% in Asians.302 
These underlying genetic differences result in differ-
ences in platelet responsiveness to the drug. Concomi-
tantly, large meta-analyses have shown that patients 
with acute coronary syndromes treated with clopido-
grel who are undergoing PCI and are CYP2C19*2 het-
erozygotes or homozygotes have an increased risk for 
major adverse cardiovascular events and stent throm-
bosis compared with wild-type *1 homozygotes.303 
These data led the US Food and Drug Administration 
to implement a boxed warning on the clopidogrel label 
noting the diminished effectiveness of the drug in poor 
metabolizers, but it did not require genetic testing. Fur-
thermore, a comparison of clinical event rates in Asians 
has not revealed significant differences in outcomes in 
patients undergoing PCI.304
Another example of polymorphisms relates to statin 
medications. It has been suggested that Asian popu-
lations require lower doses of statin for therapeutic 
effects similar to those in non-Asians,269 which could 
be related to underlying genetic differences in statin 
metabolism–related genes, although there have been 
almost no direct comparisons between ethnic sub-
groups. Studies focused on genetic differences in drug-
metabolizing enzymes in South Asians have confirmed 
genetic differences in the ABCG2 gene, which influ-
ences rosuvastatin and chemotherapeutic metabolism 
(with reduced function alleles having frequencies of 
15%–45% in South Asians compared with 2%–14% 
in whites).300 Data have suggested a higher effective 
rosuvastatin dose in Asians than in NHWs. In an open-
label pharmacokinetic study of 40 mg rosuvastatin giv-
en to Asian Indian subjects living in Singapore, it was 
found that ratios for the plasma concentration-time 
curve were 1.63 compared with NHW subjects, with 
even higher ratios in Chinese and Malay subjects.305 
The reason could be underlying genetic differences in 
several genes that influence rosuvastatin metabolism, 
including SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9. In fact, la-
beling in the United States recommends a low initial 
starting dose in Asians and attention to the potential 
for greater exposure relative to NHWs when dose esca-
lation is considered.
Allele frequencies of other genetic variants in genes 
targeted by cardiovascular medications that influ-
ence the pharmacokinetics of these medications also 
appear to be different in Asian populations. These 
include genetic variations in CYP1A2 (verapamil, 
propranolol), CYP2C8 (troglitazone, pioglitazone, 
rosiglitazone, repaglinide, verapamil, cerivastatin, 
amiodarone), CYP2A6 (influences nicotine metabo-
lism), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP3A5 (tacrolimus me-
tabolism), ABCB1 (digoxin, verapamil, quinine), CY-
P2D6 (β-blockers, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, 
and many other drugs), and SLCO1B1 (statins).300,306 
Unfortunately, although many of these vary specifi-
cally in South Asians, several of these studies group 
East and South Asians together or evaluate only East 
Asians when calculating these allele frequencies. In 
addition, polymorphisms in the N-acetyltransferase 
(NAT) gene, a phase II conjugating liver enzyme, result 
in patients with slow acetylator phenotypes who ex-
perience increased risk of toxicity from procainamide 
and hydralazine or with fast acetylator phenotypes 
potentially having reduced response to these medi-
cations. Whether the ethnic distribution differences 
in these polymorphisms translate into clinically sig-
nificant differences in efficacy, dosing, or side effects 
of these medications in South Asians compared with 
other ethnic subgroups has not been evaluated.
Although there are clear genetic differences in al-
lele frequencies in genes that control drug effects, in 
general, the medical community has not taken those 
differences into account when dosing cardiovascular 
medications. There is a need for further research into 
ethnic pharmacogenetic differences, especially in South 
Asians. Most studies group East and South Asians to-
gether; in fact, in the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion recommendations for reporting of race, all Asians 
are grouped together.307 In addition to more detailed 
classification of Asians, it may be important to further 
subclassify South Asians because allele frequencies vary 
even by South Asian subpopulations.306 More research 
is also needed as to whether underlying differences in 
allele frequencies in variations in drug-metabolizing 
enzymes and other genes influencing drug response 
translate into clinically relevant and important differ-

Community Strategies
South Asians need to be better informed about their 
risk for CVD and illness and how to access healthcare 
services to reduce and manage those risks, as well as 
the benefits of prevention efforts. Over the past decade, 
community-level, regional, and national efforts have fo-
cused on raising the awareness of health issues affect-
ing South Asians. At the South Asian Heart Center at El 
Camino Hospital in Mountain View, CA,308 targeted care 
to patients in the South Asian community is delivered 
through culturally specific and sensitive health educa-
tion, preventive care, and treatment options. These ef-
forts have led to specific programming designed to ad-
dress the epidemic of DM and heart disease in South 
Asians through the AIM to Prevent program.308 Part-
nering with neighboring academic centers and physi-
cians and through a combination of comprehensive risk 
screening, interventions, culturally appropriate lifestyle 
medication counseling and personalized coaching, this 
program has reached >5000 participants to date. Sev-
eral community and academic centers have clinical pro-
grams specifically targeting the reduction of cardiomet-
abolic risk in South Asian patients, including Prevention 
& Awareness for South Asians at the Palo Alto Medical 
Foundation309 and Stanford South Asian Translational 
Heart Initiative at Stanford University Medical Center.310
Similarly, on the East Coast of the United States, in-
vestigators are engaging members of the South Asian 
community through a variety of programming with aca-
demic-community partnerships at the New York Univer-
sity Center for the Study of Asian American Health.311 
Integrative models have allowed the assessment of the 
multilevel factors that influence South Asian health and 
resulted in access for South Asians to specific healthcare 
information, education, and services for CVD preven-
tion and treatment. The center comprises cardiologists, 
public health professionals, social service providers, 
nurses, students, and community health workers who 
together educate the community about heart disease 
and prevention through support group meetings and 
health education sessions.312 Nonprofit organizations in 
other countries such as Canada also support similar ini-
tiatives to promote cardiovascular health in South Asian 
populations.313
Programs in the Midwest have followed closely the 
models of the previously noted centers. SAHELI314 is an 
academic community partnership in Chicago that has 
successfully used group classes focusing on physical 
activity, adherence to a healthful diet, and weight and 
stress management to elicit behavioral change in physi-
cal activity, diet intake, and stress reduction.49,260,315 
Lastly, the emergence of cross-national collaborations316 
provides another example of how cooperation and col-
laboration are necessary to fully study and understand 
the unique role of biological and nonbiological mecha-
nisms that contribute to excess risk of ASCVD risk in 
South Asians.
The South Asian Health Initiative317 is a community-
based participatory research partnership between the Im-
migrant Health and Cancer Disparities Center at Memo-
rial Sloan Kettering Cancer and the South Asian Council 
for Social Services.318 This partnership seeks to develop 
more targeted research and evidence-based practice and 
policy approaches for the South Asian community by im-
proving health outcomes within the community. It is our 
hope that these nationwide initiatives will eventually lead 
to a lessening of the health disparities that exist and ulti-
mately to provide long-term development of best clinical 
practices that can be used in existing clinics that treat 
individuals of all racial/ethnic groups.
Complementary and Alternative or 
Traditional Medicine Approaches
Currently, many complementary and alternative medi-
cine approaches are also in practice to achieve CVD pre-
vention and treatment. Complementary and alternative 
medicine approaches include the use of nutraceuticals (vi-
tamins, amino acid, and natural antioxidants and miner-
als), herbal remedies, various psychological and relaxation 
approaches (mind/body therapies, hypnosis, biofeedback 
and cognitive therapy, etc), various alternative medicine 
disciplines (including Qigong and TaiChi, Ayurveda, and 
yoga), Native American practices, homeopathy, osteopa-
thy, and specific modalities (eg, acupuncture, auriculo-
therapy, chelation, aromatherapy, music therapy, sauna, 
meditation and prayer, Shiatsu, and massage).319,320 
Ayurvedic treatment consists of the use herbal prepara-
tions, diet, yoga, meditation, and other practices.320 Al-
though Ayurvedic herbal treatments have not been con-
vincingly proven to be effective, yoga has been shown 
to be useful in patients with heart disease and hyperten-
sion.320 Promising complementary and alternative medi-
cine approaches such as herbal medicines might be 
appropriate for validation in large randomized trials.320

AND GUIDELINES
ferences in prevalence of risk factors largely, if not entirely, 
driving differences in the onset and severity of disease, 
although the presence of risk factors unique to South 
Asian cannot be ruled out. The degree to which these 
differences are driven by underlying genetic susceptibility 
versus environmental exposures remains unclear. There is 
a need for dedicated population-based studies of unique 
risk factors, biomarkers, and molecular pathways medi-
ating CVD risk that are carefully conducted and include 
direct comparisons with non-Asian comparator popula-
tions, paying careful attention to population substructure 
and explicit evaluation of gene-environment interactions 
and epigenetic effects. The advancement in technolo-
gies in the fields of genomics, epigenetics, proteomics, 
and metabolomics affords the scientific community an 
evolving toolbox that can be applied to such studies.
In addition, there is a great need for dedicated phar-
macogenetics studies in South Asians. With the known 
clear differences in allele frequencies of drug-metaboliz-
ing enzymes and other key proteins affecting drug re-
sponse, efforts to provide a more personalized approach 
to choosing the right medication and right dose for 
South Asian populations will require more careful col-
lection of ethnicity information, including differentiating 
between South and East Asians and evaluating whether 
underlying genetic allele frequency differences translate 
into clinically relevant and actionable differences.
Clinical Strategies to Reduce Disease
Until the needed evidence base in the United States is ac-
quired, we suggest using available international tools and 
guidelines to personalize the treatment of South Asian 
populations in the United States. Because it seems ap-
parent that much of the risk in South Asian populations 
is carried in insulin resistance, we recommend using the 
International Diabetes Federation race-specific cut points 
for diagnosing MetS.321 This document recommends a 
cut point for waist circumference >90 cm (35.4 in) in 
South Asian men and >80 cm (31.5 in) in South Asian 
women to diagnose MetS.321 As for risk calculations, we 
put forward potential use of the UK QRISK2 calculator.243 
Race is among the inputs for this calculator, and included 
options are Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, or other Asian, 
offering race-specific risk assessment for South Asians. 
There is an urgent need to validate risk scores in South 
Asians in the United States and to better understand dif-
ferential risk within South Asians subpopulations. Finally, 
we need educational efforts aimed at populations at 
risk. Specifically, targeting community gathering areas, 
including temples and cultural and health fairs, to help 
raise awareness will be key to improve awareness of to 
the increased CVD risk in this population.
Unanswered Questions and Directions 
for Future Research
Table 2 provides a summary of ongoing research list-
ed in the ClinicalTrials.gov website to study CVD and 
cardiometabolic risk of South Asians in the United 
States, United Kingdom, and Canada. As this docu-
ment details, there are several gaps in our knowledge 
base about heart disease in South Asians. Therefore, 
as we move forward, first and foremost, we need ad-
ditional research. We need research that can identify 
environmental, biological, and physiological factors 
that contribute to CVD among South Asian patients. 
Federal and private funds are needed to accomplish 
this research. Advocacy efforts targeting federal agen-
cies should continue and increase. Private philanthropic 
efforts should also be increased. The AHA has initiated 
a series of events such as Go Red Sari that have the 
potential to garner further research funds for this im-
portant cause.323 In addition, we need to ensure that all 
stakeholders are represented at the research table and 
that capable researchers are supported. Efforts aimed 
at nurturing and promoting researchers with the nec-
essary interest, talent, and training to undertake this 
research should be prioritized. Specific research areas 
we suggest in Table 3 include (1) defining specific cut 
points for waist circumference and BMI that identify in-
creased risks for cardiometabolic disease among South 
Asians; (2) understanding the contribution of metabolic 
risk factors such as low HDL-C and high triglycerides in 
the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in South Asians; (3) 
validating/improving ASCVD risk calculators in South 
Asian populations in the United States; (4) performing 
research to help elucidate the specific genetic contribu-
tions to atherosclerosis risk in South Asian patients; (5) 
performing research to identify high-risk younger South

CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Evidence to date has confirmed the higher burden of 
CVD in South Asians in the United States, particularly 
ischemic heart disease. Table 4 summarizes findings on 
ASCVD in South Asians in the United States, and Table 5 
lists recommendations for clinicians that are based on 
our findings. Current clinical risk calculators may under-
estimate risk in this higher-risk group. Our recommen-
dation to use the QRISK2 calculator may help in clinical 
decisions to encourage earlier adoption of therapeutic 
lifestyle changes and possible medications to decrease 
CVD risk as early as childhood years. We urge healthy 
living from birth in South Asians, with major preventive 
efforts against obesity in childhood. Lp(a) is associated 
with coronary heart disease in various ethnic groups 
Table 4. CVD in South Asians: Summary of Findings
Epidemiology
  
Multiple studies of South Asians in the United Kingdom have revealed earlier onset, higher incidence, and higher standardized mortality rates from ASCVD in 
South Asians compared with NHWs.36–38
  
South Asians in the United States have a higher proportional mortality rate from ischemic heart disease compared with other Asian ethnic groups and NHWs 
in the United States.18
Biological mechanisms contributing to excess risk of ASCVD
  
The greatest risk factor disparity in South Asians is seen in the occurrence of T2DM and impaired glucose tolerance. South Asians have at least a 2-fold higher 
prevalence of T2DM, a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus, and a higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance compared with NHWs.324
  
South Asians born in the United States show evidence of an altered metabolic profile (elevated plasma insulin levels, altered plasma lipid profile, and higher 
truncal skin-fold thickness) in young adulthood compared with young adults of European descent in the United States.68
 Women with gestational diabetes mellitus were 3.2 times more likely to develop diabetes mellitus than those without gestational diabetes mellitus.78
 There is an increased risk of AMI in South Asian patients with high WHR.4
  
A comparison of South Asian individuals living in India with those living in the United States reveals that South Asians in the United States have higher 
plasma levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-C and lower levels of HDL-C.93 Potential pathophysiological explanations for the atherogenic 
dyslipidemia pattern seen in South Asian populations include a higher prevalence of insulin resistance in this population96,97 and abnormalities in CETP
.98
  
The MASALA study and others have demonstrated that South Asians and Asian Indians have a high prevalence of CAD despite a lower prevalence of some 
traditional risk factors for CAD.
  
The National Kidney Foundation states that Asian Americans are at a higher risk for kidney disease and kidney failure compared with NHWs, and diabetes 
mellitus and high blood pressure appear to be contributing factors, among others.122
Risk assessment tools and detection of subclinical CVD
  
The QRISK2 algorithm has been derived and validated in 2.3 million people to accurately estimate CVD risk in different ethnic groups in England and Wales 
and takes into account South Asian ethnicity as an additional risk factor. Median scores for South Asians are higher than those of other tools.
 CT has been able to demonstrate the following:
   
South Asians display more severe CAD on CT as determined by both increased mean percent stenosis and a higher number of patients with multiple 
diseased vessel segments.47
  Asian Indian race is a significant independent predictor of CAC severity, even when controlling for traditional risk factors for CHD.
   
The prevalence of high CAC burden (scores >100) among Asian Indians is greater than in all other ethnic groups (NHWs, Asians, Hispanics, and blacks 
among those >60 y of age).48
  A longer duration of residence in the United States has been associated with higher levels of CAC in South Asians in the MASALA study.178
Nonbiological mechanisms contributing to excess risk of ASCVD
  
There are lower physical activity rates in South Asians compared with other race/ethnic minorities, and in 1 cohort, only 52% of participants met the 
recommended guidelines through leisure-time physical activity as measured by accelerometers.194
  
In South Asians in the United States, smoking prevalence is relatively low, although the use of culturally specific tobacco products (ie, bidis, chewing tobacco) 
is prevalent.
 Diets are high in refined carbohydrates and saturated fat and low in fruits and vegetables (despite common vegetarianism).
  
Tailored interventions that take cultural context into account appear to be the best approach for ensuring the success of both dietary and physical activity 
interventions in South Asian populations.263
AMI indicates acute myocardial infarction; ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAC, coronary artery calcium; CAD, coronary artery disease; CETP

cholesteryl ester transfer protein; CHD, coronary heart disease; CT, computed tomography; CVD, cardiovascular disease; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol;

and may be useful additional information to assess in 
patients with a family history of premature coronary 
heart disease. Imaging techniques (such as CAC) may 
be useful for more accurate risk stratification, which 
should be studied in this high-risk population.
Future studies should focus on increasing representa-
tion of South Asians in clinical trials and elucidating ge-
netic and pharmacogenetic differences specific to South 
Asians to enhance precision medicine efforts. Commu-
nity strategies in limited settings have been successful to 
date and may be adopted in a more widespread manner 
to lower disease risks. At the individual level, concerted 
effort has to be made with regard to the doctor-patient 
relationship. Clinicians have to demonstrate “cultural 
competency” not only when it comes to understanding 
the increased risk of ASCVD in South Asian patients but 
also when making recommendations on diet and lifestyle 
modification. Clinicians should be able to provide South 
Asian patient–specific recommendations and resources 
on dietary changes, physical activity, and medications 
to these high-risk patients. At the population level, the 
recent introduction into the 115th US Congress of the 
South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act 
of 2017325 by Representative Pramila Jaypal is an impor-
tant step in the right direction that calls on the govern-
ment to provide for research and cardiovascular health 
among the South Asian population of the United States.

Table 5. Recommendations for Clinicians
To calculate ASCVD risk, use guidelines recommended by the AHA/ACC 
pooled cohort equations.238b
  
Consider using the UK QRISK2 calculator, although it is based specifically 
on the South Asian population in the United Kingdom (https://qrisk.
org/2017).
Use primary and secondary CVD prevention guidelines.20–22
Use the International Diabetes Federation race-specific cut points for 
diagnosing MetS.321 Cut points of waist circumference >90 cm (35.4 in) 
in South Asian men and >80 cm (31.5 in) in South Asian women are 
recommended.321
Closely follow up women with gestational diabetes mellitus for the 
development of diabetes mellitus.
Increase educational efforts by targeting community gathering areas, 
including temples and cultural and health fairs, to help raise awareness 
as a key effort to improve awareness of the increased CVD risk in this 
population.
Demonstrate at the individual doctor-patient level “cultural competency” 
in understanding the increased risk of ASCVD in South Asian patients and 
provide South Asian–specific recommendations on medications, diet, and 
lifestyle modifications.
AHA/ACC indicates American Heart Association/American College 
of Cardiology; ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CVD, 
cardiovascular disease; MetS, metabolic syndrome; and QRISK2®, the most 
recent version of the QRISK calculator, which estimates the risk of getting 
cardiovascular disease over a lifetime using the risk factors of smoking, body 
mass index, cholesterol/HDL ratio, and systolic blood pressure.
