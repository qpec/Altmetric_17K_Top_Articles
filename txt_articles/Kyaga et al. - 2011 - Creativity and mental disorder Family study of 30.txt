 Creativity has long been associated with mental disorder,
epitomised by Aristotle’s claim that ‘no great genius has ever
existed without a strain of madness’
.1 Today, it is still a common
view that prominent creative individuals frequently have a
psychiatric disorder and that creativity is enhanced in specific
mental disorders.2 One reason to study the alleged link between
creativity and psychopathology is to gain a deeper understanding
of patients’ needs and experiences. Creativity is a source of well-
being and loss of creativity is experienced as unpleasant.3 People with
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder4 often discontinue medication
because of reported loss of creativity and other cognitive impair-
ments. A link between creativity and psychopathology is also of
interest given that severe mental disorders have persisted throughout
evolution despite occurring during the reproductive years.5–9
The study of the association between creativity and psychiatric
disorders has primarily been addressed in two types of studies.
Some studies assess psychiatric disorders in eminent, creative
individuals using structured diagnostic interviews or retrospective
analysis of written biographies.2,10–14 One of the earliest attempts
to use this approach was Lange-Eichbaum’s study of over 800
people regarded as geniuses published in 1931.10 He argues that
it is within the group of individuals with exceptional gifts and a
concomitant psychopathology that history’s greatest geniuses are
found; exemplified by Michelangelo, Luther, Napoleon, Beethoven,
Schopenhauer and Strindberg, among others. He states ‘it cannot
simply be a chance matter that among geniuses the healthy
constitute only a small minority’. Following Lange-Eichbaum,
Juda investigated 294 highly gifted artists and scientists born in
German-speaking countries between 1650–1900.11 She concluded
that there is no definite relationship between highest mental
capacity and psychic illness, but that highly gifted individuals
had increased rates of psychopathology. More recent studies have
further strengthened these conclusions. Andreasen, for example,
demonstrated increased risk for affective disorder in general and
for bipolar disorder in particular in 30 creative writers at the
University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, compared with healthy
controls.12 Similarly, Jamison found increased risk for affective
disorder
in
47
British writers.13
Ludwig
used
reviews
of
biographies published in the New York Times Book Review
between 1960 and 1990 as selection criteria, identifying 1005
eminent individuals. Based on their biographies, he found an
overrepresentation
of
bipolar
disorder,
schizophrenia-like
psychosis and depression in the creative arts group.14
A few studies have evaluated creativity in people with manifest
psychopathology. Santosa et al compared individuals with bipolar
disorder, unipolar disorder, healthy creative, and non-creative
controls using the Barron–Welsh Art Scale.15 They found that
people with bipolar disorder and healthy creative controls scored
higher than those with unipolar depression and non-creative
controls. Another study reported increased creativity in 40
American adults with bipolar disorder compared with healthy
controls using the same instrument.16 To avoid bias caused by
the debilitating effects of mental illness, some studies have
included relatives of those with psychiatric disorders. For example,
Karlsson
investigated
486
male
relatives
of
people
with
schizophrenia born in Iceland between 1851 and 1940. Compared
with the general population, the relatives were more often
represented in a listing of prominent people.17 There was also a
significant increase in those specifically successful in creative
endeavours, although the number of people included were small.
By comparing different branches of a kindred, Karlsson concluded
that certain branches were high in both schizophrenia and
giftedness, whereas others were low in both. Based on these and
other findings of increased creativity in relatives of patients,16,18
including adopted children,19,20 a genetic basis for the link
between creativity and psychopathology has been suggested.8,12
However, because the prior studies relied on biographical data
of eminent individuals or small cohorts of patients,21 the alleged
link between creativity and mental disorder warrants further

Background
There is a long-standing belief that creativity is coupled with
psychopathology.
Aims
To test this alleged association and to investigate whether
any such association is the result of environmental or
genetic factors.
Method
We performed a nested case–control study based on
Swedish registries. The likelihood of holding a creative
occupation in individuals who had received in-patient
treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or unipolar
depression between 1973 and 2003 and their relatives
without such a diagnosis was compared with that of
controls.
Results
Individuals with bipolar disorder and healthy siblings of
people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were
overrepresented in creative professions. People with
schizophrenia had no increased rate of overall creative
professions compared with controls, but an increased rate in
the subgroup of artistic occupations. Neither individuals with
unipolar depression nor their siblings differed from controls
regarding creative professions.
Conclusions
A familial cosegregation of both schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder with creativity is suggested.
Declaration of interest

 study. Therefore, we conducted a large population-based study of
the occurrence of creative occupations among individuals with
schizophrenia,
bipolar
disorder
or
unipolar
depression
in
conjunction with their relatives compared with controls without
such disorders and their relatives. We also investigated whether
such an association was mediated by IQ.
Method
National registers
We performed a nested case–control study using longitudinal
Swedish total population registers. The primary key for register
linkage was the unique personal identification number assigned
to each Swedish citizen, including immigrants upon their
arrival in the country. The Hospital Discharge Register (National
Board of Health and Welfare) provided discharge diagnoses for all
in-patient treatment episodes for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder
and unipolar depression in Sweden between 1973 and 2003.
The
Multi-Generation
Register
(Statistics
Sweden)
enables
identification of biological relatives of an index person, including
all individuals born in Sweden since 1932 and whoever registered
as living in Sweden after 1960. National censuses (Statistics
Sweden) based on mandatory self-report questionnaires completed
by all adult citizens in 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990 provided
information on professions in the entire Swedish population.
Information on IQ (men only) was collected from the Military
Service Conscription Register (Swedish Defence Recruitment
Agency), based on compulsory conscription for all men. This
information included IQ test results for all 18- to 19-year-old
men between 1969 and 2006 (n = 1 742 684). Data were requested
from the respective agencies and, following an internal ethical
audit at each agency, merged by Statistics Sweden.
The Regional Ethics Committee at the Karolinska Institutet
approved the study (2005/174-31/4). Informed consent was not
required since data were anonymised immediately after merging
by Statistics Sweden.
Disease classifications
Diagnoses were coded according to the ICD-8, ICD-9 and
ICD-10.22–24 A hierarchical approach was assigned to differentiate
between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and unipolar depression.
Any individual with an event in the Hospital Discharge Register
of one of the diagnoses assigned to schizophrenia (ICD-8:
295.0–295.6, 295.8, 295.9; ICD-9: 295A–295G, 295W, 295X;
ICD-10: F20) was coded as having schizophrenia. Individuals with
an event of bipolar disorder (ICD-8: 296.1, 296.3, 296.8; ICD-9:
296A, 296C, 296D, 296E, 296W; ICD-10: F30, F31), but not
schizophrenia, were coded as having bipolar disorder. Finally,
any individual with an event of unipolar depression (ICD-8:
296.2, 300.4; ICD-9: 300E, 311; ICD-10: F32.0–F32.2, F32.4–
F32.9, F33–F39), but not schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, was
coded as having unipolar depression. Relatives of all those with
a psychiatric diagnosis and controls were not allowed to have
any event of any of the three diagnoses. Schizoaffective disorder
was not investigated in the present study. No information was
available on individuals treated solely in out-patient facilities.
In-patient diagnoses of schizophrenia have good to excellent
validity, with 94% agreement when compared with research
diagnoses, based on semi-structured interviews and medical
records.25 The validity on a single depressive episode in the Danish
National
Psychiatric
Register
has
demonstrated
sufficient
precision for clinical practice, with increasing validity correlated
to increasing severity (65–83%).26 To our knowledge, no study
on the validity of unipolar depression or bipolar disorder
diagnoses in the Hospital Discharge Register in Sweden has been
published.
Creative occupations
Occupation from the censuses was coded according to the Nordic
Classification of Occupations.27 As suggested by previous authors,
artistic and scientific occupations were defined as creative
professions (Table 1).11,28,29 Artistic occupations were further
subdivided into visual and non-visual artistic occupations to
accommodate for domain-specific differences in creativity.30
Throughout
this
article,
creative
professions
denotes
the
aggregated artistic and scientific occupations, whereas creative
occupations is used for creative professions as well as for any of
the subgroups (i.e. artistic, scientific, visual artistic and non-visual
artistic). Individuals reporting a creative occupation in at least one
of the censuses were considered creative. Individuals without
information
on
occupation
(including
those
reporting
no
occupation or unspecified occupation) were excluded from the
analyses. Finally, a less creative group (accountants and auditors)
was defined to test the specificity of the creative occupations. This
is in line with Holland’s widely used theory of vocational
personalities
and
work
environments,

Nordic
Classification of Occupations code 051: University teachers. This
group is described by Statistics Sweden as individuals ‘conducting
research and teaching at the university’, including occupations that
generally require active research or examination at the PhD level,31
excluding researchers only active outside of the academic field.
Information on occupations is based on mandatory self-report
questionnaires that were mailed to every household in Sweden.
The censuses are more than 99% complete.32 The validity of the
occupational information in the Swedish censuses has also been
investigated by comparing survey data collected during personal
interviews in 1977 and 1979–1981 to census data from 1980, with
a high level of agreement between the two sources (i.e. Nordic
Classification of Occupations 3-digit level: approximately 70%;
2-digit level: approximately 80%; 1-digit level: approximately
90%).33
We
compared
non-response
rates
regarding
occupation
among those with a psychiatric diagnosis (the case group) and
the control group and their siblings without a psychiatric
diagnosis. Those in the case group had higher rates of missing data
than their respective controls (schizophrenia: 55% v. 20%; bipolar
disorder: 25% v. 18%; unipolar depression: 25% v. 22%), whereas
healthy siblings of those in the case group had similar rates
of

data
compared
with
their
respective
controls
(schizophrenia: 18% v. 15%; bipolar disorder: 16% v. 14%;
unipolar depression: 18% v. 17%). To understand how missing
data
status
influenced
the
associations,
we
compared
the
prevalence of creativity in siblings of those in the case group with
or without missing data on occupation. Siblings of people with
schizophrenia with a missing value significantly more often had
creative professions compared with siblings of those with
schizophrenia
with
a
valid
occupation
(2.57%
v.
1.95%,
P50.001). The opposite was true for siblings of people with
unipolar depression (1.14% v. 1.57%, P50.001). No significant
differences were found in siblings of those with bipolar disorder.
IQ
In Sweden, conscription and associated assessment of IQ is
compulsory for males, but individuals with known severe medical
and psychological handicaps living in institutions were excluded
(approximately 2% in the beginning of the 1990s; B. Carlstedt,
personal communication, 2011). Two tests were used during the
study period. The first test (1969–1994) was based on written
questionnaires, and the second (1994 and onwards) was computer
based. Both tests address four dimensions of the intelligence
construct (logical/inductive, verbal, spatial/visual and theoretical/
technical) and include 160 questions (40 for each dimension).34
Results were presented from 1 to 9, standardised against the entire
population with a mean of 5 (s.d.= 2). A higher value indicates
greater cognitive capacity.
Statistical analysis
We used a nested case–control strategy to study associations
between having a creative occupation and being diagnosed with
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or unipolar depression or being
a first-, second-, or third-degree relative of these individuals.
Ten individuals matched on gender and birth year were randomly
selected as controls from the Multi-Generation Register for each
person in the case group and each of their relatives; controls
had to be alive, within the country, and without any in-patient
episode for the studied disorder at the date of the first
hospitalisation of the individual in the case group (incidence
density
sampling).
This
method
avoids
bias
due
to
the
complication that individuals in the population registers enter
the study at different times (i.e. left truncation) and allows equal
follow-up time of relatives of those in the case and the control
groups.35 To assess the association between a creative occupation
across each class of the case group and relatives, we estimated odds
ratios using conditional logistic regression in PROC PHREG in
SAS version 9.2 on Windows XP professional. The odds ratios
presented can be viewed as risk ratios, considering the use of
incidence density sampling. Since several correlated pairs of
relatives from every family could be included in an analysis, a
robust sandwich estimator was used to adjust for the correlated
data when calculating the confidence intervals.
To further investigate the familial effect, we examined the rates
of creative occupations in non-affected half-siblings of those in the
case group who shared either a mother (maternal half-siblings) or
a father (paternal half-siblings). The rationale for this comparison
is that maternal half-siblings are exposed more to common
environments than are paternal half-siblings, but are equally
genetically related (on average 25%); that is, not only have
maternal half-siblings been exposed to a similar intrauterine
environment, it has also been observed that 91% of children stay
with their mother after a divorce.36 Thus, if creative occupations
were more common in maternal half-siblings compared with
paternal half-siblings, this would suggest that early environmental
factors are important in determining creativity.35
Results
We identified 54 042 people (29 479 males and 24 563 females)
with schizophrenia, 29 644 people (11 910 males and 17 734
females) with bipolar disorder and 217 771 people (84 352 males
and 133 419 females) with unipolar depression. Since the data in
the registries are longitudinal and truncated, descriptive data for
the case group (Table 2) are presented only for individuals born
in 1958. The numbers in the case group, control group and
relatives in the different creative occupations are presented in
online Table DS1.

found between females and males, only pooled results are
presented.
Schizophrenia subgroup
Compared with the control group, those with schizophrenia (odds
ratio (OR) = 0.98, 95% CI 0.88–1.08) demonstrated no difference
in having a creative profession (Fig. 1), but showed a significantly
decreased likelihood of holding a scientific occupation (OR = 0.63,
95% CI 0.51–0.79; online Table DS2). There was also a significant
increase in the likelihood of holding an artistic occupation
(OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01–1.28), which in turn was mainly as a
result of an increase in visual artistic occupations (OR = 1.30,
95% CI 1.13–1.49).
Parents and siblings of people with schizophrenia were
significantly more likely to hold a creative profession compared
with the control group (ORParents = 1.55, 95% CI 1.43–1.67;
ORSiblings = 1.36, 95% CI 1.26–1.48). This increase was present
across all creative domains. Offspring of those in the schizo-
phrenia subgroup showed no significant increase in creative
professions overall, although there was an increased likelihood
of holding an artistic occupation, primarily of the visual domain
(OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.18–1.62), a finding that is in line with
the individuals with schizophrenia. In general, no significant
associations were found in second- and third-degree relatives of
those in the schizophrenia subgroup compared with the control
group.
Bipolar disorder subgroup
Individuals
with
bipolar
disorder
were
significantly
over-
represented in creative professions compared with the control
group (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.22–1.48). This was primarily
because of an increased likelihood of both visual (OR = 1.42,
95% CI 1.23–1.64) and non-visual (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.20–1.73)
artistic occupations.
First-degree relatives of those with bipolar disorder were more
likely than those in the control group to hold a creative profession
in general (Fig. 1), with higher odds ratios for scientific than
artistic occupations (online Table DS2). As with the schizophrenia
subgroup, second- and third-degree relatives of those in the
bipolar subgroup in general showed no significantly increased rate
of creative occupations, except that uncles/aunts and nephew/
nieces were more likely to have a scientific occupation.
Unipolar depression subgroup
Individuals with unipolar depression showed no increased rate of
overall creative professions (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.90–0.99).
Similarly, there was no consistent pattern with respect to the
frequency of creative occupations in relatives of those with
unipolar depression.
Accountants and auditors
People with bipolar disorder and their first-degree relatives
generally displayed no significant associations with accountants
and auditors, whereas those with schizophrenia or unipolar
depression and their first-degree relatives generally displayed
significant decreases in the likelihood of holding such an
occupation. More distant relatives of individuals of all three
diagnoses generally showed no significant associations with
accountants and auditors.

Half-siblings and IQ
We found no consistent pattern of differences between maternal and
paternal half-siblings (creative professions maternal v. paternal:
schizophrenia OR = 1.26 (95% CI 0.91–1.74) v. 1.08 (95% CI
0.82-1.41); bipolar disorder: OR = 1.21 (95% CI 0.75–1.94) v. 1.03
(95% CI 0.71–1.49); unipolar depression: 0.81 (95% CI 0.66–
1.00) v. 0.98 (95% CI 0.85-1.14); online Table DS2).
We found that IQ (men only) was generally higher in people
with creative occupations, but lower in those with schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, unipolar depression and their respective relatives,
compared with people without any of the three diagnoses (Table
3). To determine whether IQ mediated the association between
creativity and psychopathology, it was included as a continuous
covariate in the regression model. As a result, however, the
associations were strengthened rather than attenuated (Table 4).
No significant interaction effects between IQ and creative
occupations were found.
Discussion
Main findings
This Swedish total population case–control study is several
magnitudes larger than previous studies and demonstrates an
increased likelihood for both people with schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder, as well as for their respective relatives, to work
in a creative occupation, compared with controls. Differences in
IQ (available for men only) did not account for these associations.
Thus, the present study lends strong support to the notion that
creativity is familiarly coupled to schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder, which has been suggested in prior studies.2,10–20,37
By contrast, individuals with unipolar depression and their
relatives demonstrated no consistent pattern of associations with
artistic and scientific occupations. This indicates that creative
occupations are specifically linked to schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder rather than to psychopathology per se. Furthermore, the
lack of positive associations with accountants and auditors in any
of the studied diagnoses compared with the control group suggests
that the artistic and scientific occupations are specific for creativity.
Even though the present study does not explain what
mechanisms may underlie the observed association between
mental disorder and creative occupations, it is noteworthy that
the likelihood of creative occupations in relatives of those in the
case group was highest among healthy first-degree relatives and
this gradually decreased with increasing familial distance to these
individuals. Additionally, there were no significant differences
between the maternal and paternal half-siblings. These results
hence suggest a genetic rather than environmental explanation
to the familial cosegregation of creativity and psychopathology,
even though the comparison between maternal and paternal
half-siblings had low power. Related to this, a recent intriguing
finding is the associations between creativity and specific genetic
polymorphisms.38

 Kyaga et al
assumes that susceptibility alleles to mental disorders in patients
or relatives also harbour adaptive advantages that increase
fitness.7,39,40 Along with creativity, other balancing benefits have
been suggested; for example, bipolar disorder as an adaption to
long winters and schizophrenia as a consequence of language
evolution.41,42 The balancing selection hypothesis fits with the
present study in which the association with creativity peaks in
first-degree relatives of those with a mental disorder, rather than
in the patients themselves. This is congruent with the so called
‘inverted-U’ relationship between creativity and psychopathology.18
Hence, in absence of a debilitating illness, the relatives of those
with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder might benefit from
increased
creativity,
which
in
turn
might
increase
fitness.
Creativity has for example been coupled to an increased number
of sexual partners.8 This could thus be one explanation why these
disorders
have
prevailed
throughout
human
history.7–9,43
However, theoretical work and available empirical data are
contradictory;7 among others, findings of reduced fertility in
people with schizophrenia and their relatives disagree with this
notion.5–6,44 This has led some authors to propose the alternative
mutation
selection hypothesis,
which instead suggests that
psychiatric disorders simply reflect mutational load.7
Creative occupations in schizophrenia v. bipolar
disorder
Two general patterns emerged when people with schizophrenia
and their relatives were compared with those with bipolar disorder
and their relatives. First, those with schizophrenia were less likely
than those with bipolar disorder to hold a creative profession.
Second, relatives of people with schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder were overrepresented in both artistic and scientific
occupations;
however,
whereas
relatives
of
those
with
schizophrenia
had
their
highest
increased
rate
in
artistic
occupations, relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder were
instead
more
overrepresented
in
scientific
occupations.
Interestingly, the latter finding corroborates Juda’s finding that
schizophrenia occurs in artists and bipolar disorder in scientists.11
The schizophrenic spectrum has been proposed to convey a
decrease in common sense, demonstrated by individuals with
schizophrenia outperforming controls in logical deduction that
is in conflict with common sense.45,46 To be less restrained by
common sense might, speculatively, confer an advantage in artistic
occupations but a disadvantage in scientific occupations.28 The
increased creativity in bipolar disorder, on the other hand, might
be driven by hypomanic periods with ensuing augmented
fluency,47,48 which is an important aspect of creativity.21 This
assumption is supported by increased productivity in creative
individuals during hypomania.13
Strengths and limitations
Along with nationwide representation and absence of selection
bias, the major strength of this study is that we were able to study
the relatives of affected individuals. This circumvents the bias
sequels that the mental disorders per se exert on any measure of
creativity. The main finding of this study is therefore that the
non-affected first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia
or bipolar disorder demonstrated increased creativity compared
with a control group, whereas the individuals in the case group
themselves showed only modest increases in creativity.
One limitation with this study is the narrow definition of
scientific occupations as those solely active within the academic
area. A second limitation is the use of different diagnostic systems
(i.e. ICD-8, ICD-9 and ICD-10) throughout the cohort. Finally,
the general use of artistic and scientific occupations as a proxy
for creativity is a limitation, considering the many different ways
to measure creativity.49 But, although creativity could be assumed
to be an essential part in many different occupations and areas of
life, it has been argued that creativity is at the core of artistic and
scientific occupations.50 Feist has also demonstrated that artists
and scientists have shared psychological traits.28 Nevertheless,
the consequential restriction of this study to creativity expressed
in working life should be noted given that schizophrenia might
be more associated with creative avocations rather than vocational
activities.20 Individuals with schizophrenia in this study also had a
limited response rate on occupational status (45%), potentially
introducing bias due to missing data. However, since creative
professions were more common among the siblings of those with
schizophrenia with missing values regarding occupation, the lack
of association in people with schizophrenia could possibly be an
underestimation of the true association.
In conclusion, the present study found a clear association
between specific psychopathologies and creative occupations.
Although it is tempting to speculate that this might explain the
paradox that mental disorders persist through evolution despite
decreased
fitness,
there
are many other
plausible
theories
addressing this issue.40–42 Future studies are needed to elucidate
if creativity is distinct from other human traits, such as
intelligence or language, that might confer increased risk for
psychosis.39
