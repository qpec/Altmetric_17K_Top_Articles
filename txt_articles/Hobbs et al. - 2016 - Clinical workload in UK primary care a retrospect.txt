of 100 million consultations in England, 2007–14

Institute for Health Research School for Primary Care Research
Summary
Background Primary care is the main source of health care in many health systems, including the UK National Health 
Service (NHS), but few objective data exist for the volume and nature of primary care activity. With rising concerns 
that NHS primary care workload has increased substantially, we aimed to assess the direct clinical workload of general 
practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses in primary care in the UK.
Methods We did a retrospective analysis of GP and nurse consultations of non-temporary patients registered at 
398 English general practices between April, 2007, and March, 2014. We used data from electronic health records 
routinely entered in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, and linked CPRD data to national datasets. Trends in 
age-standardised and sex-standardised consultation rates were modelled with joinpoint regression analysis.
Findings The dataset comprised 101 818 352 consultations and 20 626 297 person-years of observation. The crude 
annual consultation rate per person increased by 10·51%, from 4·67 in 2007–08, to 5·16 in 2013–14. Consultation 
rates were highest in infants (age 0–4 years) and elderly people (≥85 years), and were higher for female patients than 
for male patients of all ages. The greatest increases in age-standardised and sex-standardised rates were in GPs, with 
a rise of 12·36% per 10 000 person-years, compared with 0·9% for practice nurses. GP telephone consultation rates 
doubled, compared with a 5·20% rise in surgery consultations, which accounted for 90% of all consultations. The 
mean duration of GP surgery consultations increased by 6·7%, from 8·65 min (95% CI 8·64–8·65) to 9·22 min 
(9·22–9·23), and overall workload increased by 16%. 
Interpretation Our fi
 ndings show a substantial increase in practice consultation rates, average consultation duration, 
and total patient-facing clinical workload in English general practice. These results suggest that English primary care 
as currently delivered could be reaching saturation point. Notably, our data only explore direct clinical workload and 
not indirect activities and professional duties, which have probably also increased. This and additional research 
questions, including the outcomes of workload changes on other sectors of health care, need urgent answers for 
primary care provision internationally.

Introduction
Primary care is central to the provision of health care in 
many developed health systems, including the National 
Health Service (NHS), providing most fi
 rst-contact health 
care; disease diagnosis, monitoring, and management; 
and disease prevention, through screening and health 
promotion. In many countries, primary care is also the 
gatekeeper to secondary care in hospital, and can provide 
sickness certifi
 cation access to benefi
 ts. However, despite 
this high volume of health-care activity internationally 
(about 90% of all NHS contacts occur in primary care), 
remarkably few data are available for the volume and 
nature of primary care activity from any country. 
Most estimates of primary care workload are from the 
UK, but are either very old,1 only provide crude consultation 
rates (up to 2009),2 or are based on survey recall.3 In the 
past few years, concerns have increased, especially in the 
UK, that primary care is overwhelmed by unsustainable 
workload increases, with pressures on emergency 
departments reported as due to reduced access to general 
practice. There are also rising diffi
  culties in recruitment to 
general practice vacancies and training posts. The 2015 
general practitioner (GP) worklife satisfaction survey 
showed the lowest overall job satisfaction since the surveys 
started in 2001.4 We therefore did this study to obtain 
accurate data for the volume and nature of primary care 
workload.
Methods
Study design and population
We did this retrospective analysis of GP and nurse 
consultations of non-temporary patients registered at 
398 English general practices between April, 2007, and 
March, 2014. Analysis was not restricted to patients who 
were continuously registered throughout the study period. 
We used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
(CPRD)—a large database of patient-level anonymised 
primary care electronic health records. Data are available

for 674 practices covering 6·9% of the UK population,5 
including 11·3 million patients (4·4 million alive) shown 
to be broadly representative with regard to age, sex,5 and 
ethnic origin.6 The CPRD includes only practices meeting 
quality checks on completeness and reliability of the data.7 
We excluded so-called unacceptable data (ie, data not 
meeting quality criteria set by CPRD) in the database, 
since 90% of these data are linked to temporary patients.7
CPRD research is covered by a broad National Research 
Ethics Service ethics approval system. This study was 
approved by the CPRD Independent Scientifi
 c Advisory 
Committee.
Procedures
We linked CPRD data to national datasets of two types: 
datasets routinely available with CPRD, such as 
deprivation data based on the English Index of Multiple 
Deprivation, and bespoke linkages at practice level to 
staffi
  ng data,8 rurality,9 patient satisfaction,10 and Quality 
and Outcomes Framework11 scores for 2013–14.  Because 
the bespoke linkages could increase the risk of 
unintentional (deductive) disclosure of specifi
 c GP 
practices and we were obliged to receive aggregate data 
in quintiles.
CPRD data are clinical entries made routinely in 
primary care electronic health records by GPs and 
practice staff
  (practice nurses, health-care assistants, and 
administrative staff
 ) coded to type of contact, using a total 
of 51 codes. We categorised these codes into fi
 ve entry 
types: face-to-face surgery consultations, telephone 
contacts, home visits, administrative, and other. Staff
 
 
roles, based on login details, are coded using 67 roles, 
which we categorised into four roles: GP, nurse, other 
clinicians, and administrative. Here we report on GP and 
practice nurse direct patient contacts in face-to-face or 
telephone consultations and home visits. All the recorded 
activity and timings (start and end time of consultations) 
represent accurately collected workload data, but might 
not capture all the time involved with each patient contact.
We calculated person-years of observation for each age 
and sex strata over the 7 years. Crude rates were calculated 
for each year of observation and, for comparisons across 
years, rates were age-standardised and sex-standardised 
to the 2013 mid-year English population.12 We calculated 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Few data exist for workload in primary care internationally. We 
searched PubMed on Sept 4, 2015, and again on Feb 15, 2016, 
with the search terms “workload”, “primary care”, and “general 
practice”. We also checked citations. All relevant English-language 
publications were considered with no methodological or quality 
restrictions imposed. Most evidence is based on surveys of 
practitioners or patients (mainly in the UK, Australia, and Europe), 
with a few observational studies (usually of workload associated 
with certain disease presentations), or very few trials of diff
 ering 
ways of primary care delivery and eff
 ect on trial-measured 
workload (eg, telephone triaging in the ESTEEM trial; Campbell JL 
et al, 2014). Objective data for clinical workload in primary care 
are scarce and, in the UK, were last published in 2008, and only for 
overall consultation numbers. By contrast, increased published 
dat 
a exist for physician perceptions of rapidly rising demand and 
unsustainable workload. Data matching perceptions of workload 
against evidence for activity are therefore needed.
Added value of this study
This study reports the most recent objective data for primary 
care consultation numbers and consultation rates (crude and 
population adjusted), and is the fi
 rst to analyse duration of 
consultations. Our fi
 ndings show a substantial increase in 
practice consultation rates, average consultation duration, and 
total patient-facing clinical workload in English general practice 
over 7 years between 2007 and 2015. These fi
 ndings are based 
on the largest analysis of consultations, more than 20 million 
person-years of observation, from one of the most validated 
databases of routinely collected electronic clinical records in the 
world (the Clinical Practice Research Datalink).
Implications of all the available evidence
Increasing subjective evidence of rising workload in 
international primary care, especially in the UK, is borne out in 
this objective analysis. Direct clinical workload in primary care 
has increased consistently in the UK, over and above the 
growth in the population and the growth in general 
practitioner (GP) and nurse numbers, and is likely to continue 
growing. Perceptions of unsustainability of this workload from 
GP surveys in the UK also seem to have an objective evidence 
base, since the mean duration of face-to-face consultations is 
approaching the maximum duration available for most booked 
consultations in the UK—ie, that the system might be 
approaching saturation. Evidence also showed that one 
response to coping with this increased workload—use of 
telephone triage—is accelerating rapidly (doubled in 
the 7 years), despite fi
 ndings showing that this strategy does 
not reduce overall primary care workload, only appeals to a 
subset of the population, and might reduce the proportion of 
primary care devoted to preventive activities. These data 
confi
 rm a mechanism to provide ongoing workload statistics 
for health planning. More research is needed into the 
outcomes of workload changes on other sectors of health care, 
such as admissions, on prescribing or investigation trends, or 
linked to disease states or comorbidities. The present data also 
provide a mechanism to generate workforce numbers that 
might be predicted are needed to cover demand from patients, 
based on specifi
 c population demographics. All these 
additional research questions need urgent answers for primary 
care provision internationally.

percentage changes from the fi
 rst year (2007–08) to the 
last year (2013–14). 
CPRD round down contact entries to the nearest whole 
minute—eg, 8 min 59 s is recorded as 8 min. Consultation 
durations of less than 1 min are recorded in CPRD data 
as zero. For analyses, we assumed these durations to 
be of 30 s. After examination of the distribution of 
consultation durations, those lasting longer than 60 min 
were truncated at 60 min. Such entries might be artifacts, 
for example not closing a record at the end of a clinic, but 
could still be accurate, for example if an urgent admission 
had to be arranged. However, this censoring only aff
 ected 
0·9% of consultations. 
Notably, the duration of home visits represents time 
spent recording what happened on visits, rather than the 
actual time spent doing the visit, which provides a 
substantial underestimate of visit duration. We examined 
duration data for each year and calculated mean duration 
for each age and sex strata. We calculated changes in 
duration between the fi
 rst year (2007–08) and the last 
year (2013–14) for each type of staff
  and contact.
Statistical analysis
Trends 
in 
age-standardised 
and 
sex-standardised 
consultation 
rates 
were 
modelled 
with 
joinpoint 
regression,13 which identifi
 ed the estimated location of any 
signifi
 cant change in the slope of a trend line.14 Each 
joinpoint represents a year with an estimated change of 
trend in rates. A maximum of one joinpoint was allowed 
for each model considered; this was the default value 
according to the number of observations in each model. 
The overall signifi
 cance level for permutation tests was 
α=0·05. We estimated the annual percentage change for 
each trend line, with associated confi
 dence intervals. A 
confi
 dence interval could not be calculated if there were 
too few datapoints in a line segment.
We calculated a composite measure of total patient 
facing workload for GPs and nurses by multiplying the 
age-specifi
 c, sex-specifi
 c, and year-specifi
 c consultation 
rate for each stratum by the average duration of 
consultations in minutes for those strata. These 
calculations were then totalled for each year to provide an 
estimate of the total number of patient contact hours per 
10 000 person-years. This fi
 gure was then expressed as 
number of clinical days per 10 000 person-years by 
dividing the total time by a notional 6 h (estimated 
duration of two booked sessions per day). 
We did analysis with Stata (version 14), Microsoft Excel 
2010, and Joinpoint Regression Programme (version 
4.2.0.2).13

Results
Overall, 398 practices were included, with around 
360 practices contributing to the fi
 rst 4 years of 
observation, declining to 316 practices by 2013–14. The 
practices tended to be large, with mean list sizes of more 
than 9600 patients in 2014, from 9000 patients in 2007 
(appendix). The dataset comprised 101 818 352 con-
sultations and 20 626 297 person-years of observation 
(appendix). Contributing practices were located across 
England, although mostly in southern regions, with 
4·65 full-time equivalent GPs on average (excluding 
registrars), and 154 (40%) of 386 practices were training 
practices (appendix). Practices were slightly over-
representative of those achieving high QOF scores 
(appendix).
Age-specifi
 c consultation rates had a J-shaped 
distribution, with the highest rates in infants aged 
0–4 years, decreasing to the lowest levels in the 15–24-year 
age group in male patients and the 5–14-year age group 
in female patients, before rising in each age band, 
reaching a peak in patients older than 85 years (table 1). 
Age and sex patterns of consultation rates were consistent 
across all years (table 1). Consultation rates were slightly 
higher in boys than girls in the 0–4-year age group, but 
were signifi
 cantly higher in women than men at ages 
15–44 years, which probably represents consultations 
regarding contraception, maternal, and prenatal health. 
In terms of crude consultation numbers, most 
consultations were in adults aged 25–74 years (62% in 
2013–14), mainly due to the numbers in the population in 
these groups (appendix). After standardisation of age and 
sex to the 2013 mid-year English population, consultation 
rates increased by 9·1% over the 7 years, with statistically 
signifi
 cant, but constant, annual percentage increases of 
1·4% (95% CI 1·1–1·8; fi
 gure).
For GPs, overall standardised consultations increased 
signifi
 cantly by 12·36% over the 7 years (fi
 gure, appendix). 
Surgery consultations, which accounted for most GP 
consultations, increased by 5·20% (appendix), with 
signifi
 cant increases for the fi
 rst 5 years (1·3% per year, 
95% CI 1·3–1·4) followed by a non-signifi
 cant decrease of 
1·6% (fi
 gure). The biggest change was in GP telephone 
consultations rates, which increased by 99·6% over 
7 years (appendix), with a constant signifi
 cant change of 
11·1% per year (95% CI 7·8–14·5 fi
 gure). Conversely, GP 
visit rates decreased steadily by a small but signifi
 cant 
–1·8% (95% CI –2·5 to –1·1) per year, but represent only 
2% of consultations. 
For practice nurses, overall age-adjusted and sex-
adjusted consultation rates in the fi
 rst 2 years showed a 
non-signifi
 cant increase of 2·1% per year (95% CI

–1·1 to 5·3) then a non-signifi
 cant decrease of –0·8% per 
year (–1·8 to 0·3; fi
 gure). Face-to-face nurse consultations 
remained stable, whereas telephone rates showed a 
slight, non-signifi
 cant decrease of 0·6% per year (95% CI 
–2·5 to 1·3). Nurse home-visit rates decreased by –6·5% 
per year (95% CI –8·8 to –4·1) for the fi
 rst 5 years.  
The consultation rate per patient per year in English 
primary care rose by 10·51% from 2007–08 to 2013–14 
(table 2). Most of the increase was in GP consultations, 
which increased by 13·67% over the 7 years (table 2).
The mean duration of overall consultations with GPs or 
nurses was 8·86 min by 2013–14, representing a 4·94% 
(95% CI 4·82–5·06) increase (or 25 s) over the 7 years 
(table 3). Larger increases were shown at the extremes of 
the age range, with increases of 9·3% in children aged 
0–4 years and 10·1% in adults aged 85 years and older 
(table 3). Patients aged 45–64 years consistently had the 
longest consultations (table 3). Most increases in 
consultation duration happened in the fi
 rst 4 years, with a 
1·8% (95% CI –0·4 to 4·1) non-signifi
 cant annual 
percentage rise until 2010–11, when the rate of increase 
plateaued. The increase in mean duration of consultations 
overall was moderated by the increasing proportion of GP 
telephone consultations, which had a mean duration of 
5·4 min (95% CI 5·3–5·4) in 2013–14. The mean duration 
of GP face-to-face surgery consultations increased 
signifi
 cantly by 6·7%, from 8·65 min (95% CI 8·64–8·65) 
in 2007–08, to 9·22 min (9·22–9·23) in 2013–14 (appendix). 
Nurse face-to-face consultations were of a similar 
duration to those of GPs at 9·72 min (95% CI 9·71–9·73). 
This time slowly, but signifi
 cantly, increased at an annual 
percentage change of 1·08% (95% CI 0·4–1·7) each year. 
The duration of nurse telephone consultations steadily 
and signifi
 cantly increased by 2·8% (95% CI 2·2–3·4) 
each year, reaching a mean duration of 5·69 min (95% CI 
5·66–5·72) in 2013–14.
The number of clinical days needed for consulting per 
10 000 person-years increased by 16·0% over the 7 years 
(table 4). We recorded a U-shaped association with age, 
with the lowest increases in 25–74 year olds and the 
largest increases in the patients older than 85 years most 
elderly people (table 4). There were increases of 3·8% per 
year (95% CI 1·9–5·6) per year in the fi
 rst 4 years, with a 
non-signifi
 cant increase of 1·2% (–0·7 to 3·0) per year 
thereafter.
Of the 1270 days of direct patient contact time in 
2013–14, 913 (95% CI 911·4–914·8; 72%) days represented 
GP consultations, with an 18·2% increase in days over 
the 7 years (appendix). Time spent doing GP face-to-face 
consultations increased by 13·5%, and total time spent 
doing telephone consultations by GPs more than doubled, 
from 39 days (95% CI 38·7–29·1) per 10 000 person-years 
in 2007–08, to 80 days (79·5–80·3) per 10 000 person-
years in 2013–14. The number of days of nurse face-to-
face consultation time also increased, by 11·4%, although 
this increase represented a smaller proportion of the 
overall workload (342 days [95% CI 341·0–343·5; 27% of 
total direct patient consulting time).
There was little association between consultation rates 
and deprivation at the practice level, which might have 
resulted from the aggregation step. We therefore did an 
exploratory univariate analysis of Index of Multiple 
Deprivation scores at the patient level, which showed a 
strong association between deprivation and overall 
consultation rate (appendix).
Discussion 
These are the fi
 rst comprehensive data for the direct 
clinical workload of GPs and practice nurses in primary 
care, analysing both duration and rates of consultation 
over 2·5 million patient-years. Number and duration of 
consultations increased between 2007 and 2014, leading 
to substantial increases in workload, especially for GPs.
The number of consultations per patient per year in 
English primary care rose by roughly 10% between 
2007–08 and 2013–14. Most of these consultations were 
face-to-face contacts with GPs in the surgery. The English 
population has also rapidly increased, by 5·7% from 
51·4 million in 2008, to 54·3 million in 2014.15 This overall 
population rise was additionally associated with a 
disproportionate rise in elderly people and infants 
younger than 5 years (UK had highest birthrate in Europe

in 2012), with both age extremes associated with 
signifi
 cantly higher consultation rates, and rate of rise, 
than any other group. In patient-level univariate analysis, 
rates of consultation in patients in the most deprived 
quintile were 3·5% higher than those in patients in the 
middle quintile and 15% higher than those in the least 
deprived quintile. 
The increasing number of consultations per patient, 
and the increasing number of patients, has been 
compounded by a decrease in the number of full-time 
equivalent GPs per 100 000 patients. On the basis of 
national data, the number of GPs in England (full-time 
equivalent, excluding registrars and retainers) rose by 
5·5% between 2007 and 2014, from 30 936 to 32 628.16 
After accounting for population growth, these data 
represent a 1% decrease in full-time equivalent GPs per 
100 000 patients (from 60·9 to 60·6 GPs). Full-time 
equivalent numbers of practice nurses increased slightly 
by 3·5%, from 14 554 in 2007, to 15 062 in 2014.
In our study, we recorded slightly lower overall 
consultation rates and rate of rise in consultations than 
shown in the only previous study of consultation rates 
between 1995–96 and 2008–09,2 from which data were 
extrapolated to suggest 340 million primary care 
consultations per annum in 2013.17 These adjusted 
consultation rates per practitioner show workload 
changes over and above any extra demand from 
population growth. We recorded consistent rises in age-
standardised and sex-standardised consultation rates 
over the 7 years, equivalent to a 1·4% annual rise in 
overall consultations. The biggest increase (12·4%) was 
in GP consultation rates. These increases comprised 
small reductions in visit rates, moderate rises in 
face-to-face consultations, and huge rises in telephone 
consultations. All the annual rises driving these increases 
were statistically signifi
 cant, but with a fl
 attening of the 
increase in face-to-face consultations in the last year. For 
practice nurses, the rise in consultations was less 
substantial, with a 0·9% increase over 7 years and 
fl
 attening of the rates from 2009. The rise for nurses is 
based on a small (3%) increase in face-to-face 
consultations, with reductions in telephone consultations 
of a tenth and in visit consultations of almost half. 
For the fi
 rst time, we report on the duration of 
consultations by type. We recorded a small (5%) but 
consistent increase in consultation time for practitioners 
during the period of observation. Average face-to-face 
consultation times with an English GP rose by 7% for 
GPs and by 6% for nurses. These duration data are 
important. First, they show multiple eff
 ects of rising 
workload: the 12·4% increase in GP consultation rates 
linked to a 4% rise in mean consultation duration, shows 
that GP direct clinical workload has risen by 18·2% in 
7 years. The equivalent increases for overall GP and 
practice nurse consultations were 9·1% for consultation 
rates and 5% for duration, showing an overall 16% 
increase in overall measurable direct clinical workload.

Second, the data suggest that a common strategy 
advocated for coping with rising workload—use of 
telephone triage—has been widely deployed by GPs in 
England, but has become less effi
  cient, with a doubling of 
telephone consulting rates over 7 years and small rises in 
the time needed to do these consultations. The increases 
in time needed for telephone consultations is important 
because the evidence for same-day telephone triage shows 
that it does not reduce overall workload,16 due to the time 
involved in telephone calls (60% of the time seeing the 
patient face to face) and the proportion (about a third) of 
calls resulting in a subsequent surgery consultation.18
Our fi
 ndings show that perceptions of rapidly rising 
workload in English general practice are well founded. 
The reason why practitioners feel so pressured might be 
because the overall system seems to be approaching 
saturation. Most English practices off
 er patients 10 min 
appointment slots. These timings are based on an 
expectation that some consultations will be shorter than 
others, or that patients will not attend and therefore 
some longer consultations can be accommodated within 
the booked clinic length. Because the mean face-to-face 
consultation time is now approaching 10 min, the GP or 
nurse will eventually have to consult throughout the 
booked clinic length, with no break. This situation will be 
undoubtedly demanding, in view of the various clinical 
problems being dealt with.
Our study has several limitations. We can only report 
on time spent recording consultations. Staff
  types are 
likely to be reliable being based on individuals’ unique 
login details. For patient visits, the electronic health 
record is only opened to record what was done during the 
visit and does not capture time with the patient. The start 
and end times of most surgery consultations (which 
accounted for most consultations) are probably accurate 
being consecutive consultations, but we adjusted for 
failure to close a record by censoring all consultations at 
1 h; less than 1% of consultations exceeded this time and 
some consults might take more than 1 h. Furthermore, 
because CPRD round down contact entries to the nearest 
whole minute, these consultation duration data are likely 
to be systematically underestimated.
Although the CPRD database is representative of the 
UK population, we only assessed workload for English 
practices (a sponsor requirement). The practices included 
represent around 4·5% of English practices, but were 
35% larger on average (2014 mean CPRD list size of 
9650 compared with 7171 for all English practices).8 
The biggest limitation is that data are only available for 
consultations involving direct patient contact: no data are 
available for time spent on patient-related clinical activity 
consequential on consultations, such as arrangement of 
hospital referrals. We also cannot quantify other 
professional activities, such as teaching, audit, or 
continuing professional development. These aspects of 
GP workload are likely to have also increased substantially 
since 2007
. Because the 2015 GP worklife survey reported

that direct patient care accounts for 62% of GP’s work 
time,4 our data could under-represent total workload by 
more than 40%. 
In conclusion, English general practice has absorbed 
consistent major rises in workload relating to direct 
patient care, with particularly marked increases for GPs 
in surgery and especially telephone consultations. There 
are few rapid solutions to workload pressures in primary 
care. Immediate steps might include increasing the 
availability of practitioner consulting time by reducing 
the non-direct clinical workload for a period. NHS plans 
to expand GP numbers by 5000 will take time and are 
dependent on an improved appeal of general practice as a 
career choice for which the major drivers are perceived 
status and reward for the specialty. The perception of 
general practice as a stressful, work-pressured, low-status 
career choice with excessive administration19 needs to 
change. Unfortunately, one main response to workload 
pressures—more telephone triaging—might help cope 
with demand, but could undermine some key roles of 
general practice in disease prevention. One important 
focus for the NHS could be strategies to reduce patient 
health-seeking behaviours and increase self-manage-
ment. If the English population continues to rise overall, 
as is predicted, and proportions of elderly and young 
people rise disproportionately, the rises in consultation 
rates are likely to accelerate.
