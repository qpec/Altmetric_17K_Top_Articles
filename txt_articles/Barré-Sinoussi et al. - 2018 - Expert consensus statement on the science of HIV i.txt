Abstract
Introduction: Globally, prosecutions for non-disclosure, exposure or transmission of HIV frequently relate to sexual activity, biting,
or spitting. This includes instances in which no harm was intended, HIV transmission did not occur, and HIV transmission was extre-
mely unlikely or not possible. This suggests prosecutions are not always guided by the best available scientific and medical evidence.
Discussion: Twenty scientists from regions across the world developed this Expert Consensus Statement to address the use
of HIV science by the criminal justice system. A detailed analysis of the best available scientific and medical research data on
HIV transmission, treatment effectiveness and forensic phylogenetic evidence was performed and described so it may be bet-
ter understood in criminal law contexts. Description of the possibility of HIV transmission was limited to acts most often at
issue in criminal cases. The possibility of HIV transmission during a single, specific act was positioned along a continuum of risk,
noting that the possibility of HIV transmission varies according to a range of intersecting factors including viral load, condom
use, and other risk reduction practices. Current evidence suggests the possibility of HIV transmission during a single episode
of sex, biting or spitting ranges from no possibility to low possibility. Further research considered the positive health impact of
modern antiretroviral therapies that have improved the life expectancy of most people living with HIV to a point similar to
their HIV-negative counterparts, transforming HIV infection into a chronic, manageable health condition. Lastly, consideration
of the use of scientific evidence in court found that phylogenetic analysis alone cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that
one person infected another although it can be used to exonerate a defendant.
Conclusions: The application of up-to-date scientific evidence in criminal cases has the potential to limit unjust prosecutions
and convictions. The authors recommend that caution be exercised when considering prosecution, and encourage governments
and those working in legal and judicial systems to pay close attention to the significant advances in HIV science that have
occurred over the last three decades to ensure current scientific knowledge informs application of the law in cases related to
HIV.

INTRODUCTION
At least 68 countries have laws that specifically criminalize HIV
non-disclosure, exposure, or transmission.Thirty-three countries
are known to have applied other criminal law provisions in similar
cases (Unpublished data, HIV Justice Network, 2018). Most
prosecutions have related to perceived risk of HIV acquisition
associated with sexual activity but prosecutions have also
occurred for acts such as biting and spitting (Unpublished data,
HIV Justice Network, 2018). These laws and prosecutions have
not always been guided by the best available scientific and medi-
cal evidence [1], have not evolved to reflect advancements in
knowledge of HIV and its treatment, and can be influenced by
persistent societal stigma and fear associated with HIV [2]. HIV
continues to be singled out, with prosecutions occurring in cases
where no harm was intended; where HIV transmission did not
occur, was not possible or was extremely unlikely; and where
transmission was neither alleged nor proven [1,3].

 In this context, 20 HIV scientists with expertise in scien-
tific research, epidemiology, and patient care from regions
across
the
world
developed
this
Consensus
Statement,
prompted by concern that criminal law is sometimes applied
in a manner inconsistent with contemporary medical and sci-
entific evidence: including overstating both the risk of HIV
transmission and also the potential for harm to a person’s
health and wellbeing. Such limited understanding of current
HIV science reinforces stigma and may lead to miscarriages
of justice. It may also undermine efforts to address the HIV
epidemic [4]. The Consensus Statement has been endorsed
by additional scientists from across the globe (See Supple-
mentary Material S1), and by the International AIDS Society,
the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care and
the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. An Exec-
utive Summary of this Statement is included as Supplemen-
tary Material S2.
This Consensus Statement aims to assist scientific experts
considering individual criminal cases in which HIV non-disclo-
sure, (perceived or possible) exposure, or transmission has
been alleged. It provides expert opinion regarding individual
HIV transmission dynamics (i.e. the “possibility” of transmis-
sion), long-term impact of chronic HIV infection (i.e. the “harm”
of HIV), and the application of phylogenetic analysis as evi-
dence.
It
describes
the
possibility
of
HIV
transmission
between individuals who have engaged in a specific act at a
specific time under specific circumstance, as that is usually the
focus of criminal cases, and aims to communicate current sci-
entific evidence relating to HIV in a manner understandable
to a non-scientific audience. The Consensus Statement has
been translated into French, Russian and Spanish (See Supple-
mentary Material S3–S5).

DISCUSSION
The first part of this Statement focuses on the possibility of
HIV transmission during specific acts that are commonly con-
sidered in prosecutions: sexual activity, biting or spitting [3]. It
does not reference other ways HIV may be transmitted, for
example, through blood transfusion, needle stick injury, inject-
ing drugs or breastfeeding.
An initial meeting in Seattle (February 2017) decided the
contents and framing of this Consensus Statement. A detailed
literature review was prepared based on a search for litera-
ture published in English using the PubMed online database
up to April 2017. Specific search terms relating to the possi-
bility of HIV transmission were used, including “HIV and viral
load,” “HIV sexual transmission risk per act,” “oral sex HIV
transmission,” “anal sex HIV transmission,” “vaginal sex HIV
transmission condom per act,” “anal sex HIV transmission con-
dom per act,” and “anal sex HIV transmission circumcision per
act.” Key articles were used to search for related articles.
Preference was given to meta-analyses, reviews and important
studies. Other sources were identified by the expert authors.
Abstracts from scientific conferences were used as appropri-
ate.
The authors next engaged in multiple rounds of drafting
and review, considering the best available scientific and medi-
cal research data according to the following hierarchy: system-
atic review of randomized clinical trials; randomized clinical
trials; and comparative studies (i.e. cohort studies, case–
control studies and historical control studies). Two teleconfer-
ences were held to discuss a preliminary draft, followed by
three rounds of redrafting via electronic correspondence by
all authors. National and international legal experts, including
UNAIDS staff members, were consulted on the application of
the criminal law in cases involving HIV. A second face-to-face
meeting was convened in Paris (July 2017) to resolve out-
standing data analysis issues. Further rounds of comment and
redrafting were undertaken by the authors to ensure agree-
ment that the Consensus Statement accurately relayed cur-
rent scientific research related to HIV transmission, harms
and the use of scientific evidence in court.
The authors considered numerical findings and statistical
estimates from all studies cited herein, including data sum-
maries from reports presented in systematic or table form
(for example, the works of Patel et al. [5]). Evidence establish-
ing estimates of the possibility of HIV transmission through
different acts varies in both type and quality; the authors fac-
tored these considerations into their assessment of the possi-
bility associated with different acts. The authors considered
that the evidence regarding transmission via different acts
falls into three categories (Table 1).
When describing the evidence, the authors aimed to use
scientific concepts in ways that are helpful in the context of
criminal law. For example, the statistical concept of confidence
intervals is designed to address uncertainty inherent in results
derived from sampling a subset of a population. When dealing
with probabilities that are or approach zero, confidence inter-
vals take on special significance because the fact that some-
thing was not observed to happen during a study cannot
prove that it could never happen. The larger the study, the
more precisely the authors can estimate that the probability is
zero. Consequently, a zero probability calculated from study
data is associated with a confidence interval from zero to a
small, positive probability. It is important that calculations of
confidence intervals are not misinterpreted to exaggerate
remote theoretical possibilities.

 Consideration of the methodology and results of studies
cited in this Consensus Statement informed the development
of three descriptors located along a continuum to describe
the possibility of HIV transmission during a single, specific act
(Table 2).
Importantly, this Consensus Statement is not intended as a
public health document to inform HIV prevention, treatment
and care messaging or programming. Its approach, based on
individual-level risk which may be applied in criminal justice
settings, differs from descriptions of population-level risks that
are used in the context of public health, which often describe
sexual acts as ranging from “low risk” to “high risk.” The differ-
ences between the public health descriptors and those used
in this Consensus Statement reflect both history and context.
First, public health definitions used to describe HIV transmis-
sion risk were developed during the early days of the HIV epi-
demic, before the emergence of recent evidence on HIV
transmission. Second, they describe relative risk (not absolute
risk) as a means to help people reduce the possibility of HIV
transmission by comparing different acts.
Although the simplicity of such public health terminology
was originally intended to support effective, broad-based pub-
lic health education campaigns for HIV prevention, its general-
ized categories now pose real problems for those developing
current HIV health promotion messaging based on up-to-date
scientific evidence [6], including evidence of the different vari-
ables that modify risk associated with specific acts, such as
viral load. In some instances, understanding of the riskiness of
certain sexual acts communicated by public health characteri-
zations has also been misapplied in the context of criminal
proceedings, for example, the Canadian case of Mabior [7,8].
Consequently, although sexual transmission is a common form
of HIV transmission at a global population level, this Consen-
sus Statement recognizes that the possibility of HIV transmis-
sion
during
a
single
sexual
encounter
ranges
from
no
possibility to low possibility, while it ranges from no possibility
to negligible possibility in cases of spitting or biting. This
approach to the science of HIV in the context of criminal law
is similar to that used in national scientific consensus state-
ments from Australia [9], Canada [10], Sweden [11] and
Switzerland [12].

Possibility of transmission: overview
HIV is not easily transmitted from one person to another. It is
a relatively fragile virus that is transmitted through specific
well-described routes. It is not passed on through airborne,
droplet, fomite, contact or vector-borne transmission routes
and cannot penetrate intact human skin [13].
For HIV transmission to occur, certain basic conditions must
exist:
○ There must be a sufficient amount of the virus in particular
bodily fluids (i.e. blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal flu-
ids, vaginal fluids, or breast milk).
○ A sufficient quantity of at least one of those bodily fluids
must come into direct contact with sites in the body of an
HIV-negative person where infection can be initiated. These
are usually mucous membranes, damaged tissue or inflamed
ulcers, but not intact skin.
○ The virus must overcome the person’s innate immune
defences so that infection can be established and propagated.
Most everyday activities carry no risk of HIV transmission
because these conditions are not met. Leaving aside par-
enteral or vertical transmission, intimate contact, such as sex-
ual intercourse, is usually required for transmission. Even in
those cases, the per-act chance of transmission is zero to low
(with estimates ranging from 0% to 1.4% per act) [5].
2.2

Factors influencing the possibility of HIV
transmission
The possibility of HIV transmission associated with individual
acts varies according to a range of intersecting factors. When
multiple intersecting factors are present, their effect is mini-
mized or amplified to various degrees [14].
• Correct use of a condom prevents HIV transmission
Correct use of a condom (either male or female) prevents
HIV transmission because the porosity of condoms is protec-
tive against even the smallest sexually transmissible patho-
gens, including HIV [15]; latex and polyurethane condoms act
as an impermeable physical barrier through which HIV cannot
pass. Correct condom use means the integrity of the condom
is not compromised and the condom is worn throughout the
sex act in question. Correct use of a condom during sex
means HIV transmission is not possible.
Population level studies have found that consistent condom
use for anal or vaginal sex dramatically reduces the possibility of
HIV transmission even when factoring in instances of incorrect
use or breakage [16-21]. For example, a meta-analysis of 14
studies found that long periods of consistent use of male con-
doms during vaginal sex reduces the possibility of HIV transmis-
sion by at least 80% [22]. However, more recent research
suggests that this may be an underestimate [23], with the meta-
analysis described including non-standard data analysis meth-
ods which may have led to recruitment and other biases which
could have lowered the level of prevention observed [22,23].
Population-level research is only relevant in cases where
multiple sex acts have occurred and it is not known whether
condoms were correctly used in each instance. The population
level estimate of 80% condom effectiveness does not exist as
a stand-alone estimate of HIV transmission risk but must be
applied against risk associated with different sex acts. For
example, if the estimated risk of HIV transmission from an
HIV-positive man to a woman during a single episode of

 condomless vaginal sex is 0.08% [5], then the risk of transmis-
sion when a condom is used can be understood as at least
80% lower, or 0.016% (less than 2 in 10,000) [5]. Importantly,
when other risk reduction factors are present (e.g. low viral
load or withdrawal before ejaculation) the possibility of HIV
transmission, even in the event of incorrect condom use, is
further reduced.
To reiterate, HIV cannot be transmitted in individual cases
where a condom has been used correctly (i.e. it was worn
through the sex act in question and its integrity was not
compromised). The population-level estimates can only apply
in situations where multiple instances of condom use have
occurred, including occasional instances of incorrect use and
breakage.
• Viral
load
that
is
low
or
“undetectable”
significantly
decreases or eliminates the possibility of HIV transmission
Soon after acquiring HIV, a person’s viral load is very high but
typically decreases over the first few weeks as their immune sys-
tem responds. If a person does not commence treatment, their
viral load remains fairly stable for some time, while the immune
system is gradually depleted. In advanced HIV infection, viral
load usually increases to higher levels again.
Antiretroviral
therapy
prevents
HIV
from
replicating,
thereby significantly reducing the viral load in a person’s bod-
ily fluids. When effective antiretroviral therapy is commenced,
viral load usually drops to levels that are undetectable by cur-
rent standard laboratory blood tests within a few weeks or
months. Testing availability and lower limits of detection vary
in different parts of the world, with lower limits of detection
ranging from around 20 viral copies/mL to 400 copies/mL. A
small percentage of people living with HIV (often referred to
as long-term non-progressors) have a low viral load without
taking antiretroviral therapy because their immune systems
are able to control HIV [24-28].
Reduced viral load improves immune function and dramati-
cally decreases the long-term likelihood of illness and death. It
also greatly reduces the possibility of HIV transmission [29-
31]. Decreases in viral load are associated with concomitant
decreases in the likelihood of HIV transmission [32-35], mean-
ing that many people on treatment cannot transmit HIV.
Recent analyses from key studies (namely, HPTN052, PART-
NER and Opposites Attract) involving both heterosexual and
male couples of different HIV status have not identified any
cases of sexual transmission from a person with an unde-
tectable viral load [29,30,36,37]. These findings have trans-
formed public health messaging. For example, the United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now
describes the estimated possibility of HIV transmission from
an HIV-positive person with an undetectable viral load (as a
result of effective antiretroviral treatment) as “effectively no
risk” [6].
In 2011, the HPTN052 trial (conducted in Botswana, Brazil,
India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, the United States
and Zimbabwe), which investigated the impact of early treat-
ment initiation, observed no HIV transmission from 1763 peo-
ple on antiretroviral therapy who had a stable viral load below
400 copies/mL. Partners of HIV-positive participants were fol-
lowed for the equivalent of 8509 person-years. The only
transmission from people on treatment occurred either early
in treatment (before viral load was stabilized below 400
copies) or when viral load was above 1000 copies/mL on two
consecutive visits [29,37].
The PARTNER and Opposites Attract studies found no HIV
transmission from people with a viral load below 200 copies/
mL after more than 75,000 acts of condomless vaginal or anal
sex [18,30,38]. In the PARTNER study, heterosexual couples
reported approximately 36,000 condomless sex acts and
homosexual male couples reported about 22,000 condomless
sex acts [30]. No HIV transmission occurred between partners
in the study. Eleven cases of new HIV infection did occur,
however, phylogenetic analysis found that in all cases, the
infection resulted from sexual contact with someone other
than the person’s regular sexual partner. The Opposites
Attract study included nearly 17,000 condomless sex acts
among men. No HIV transmission was reported between part-
ners involved in the study, while three cases of new HIV infec-
tion resulted from sexual contact with someone other than
the person’s regular sexual partner [18].
A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis also found no
transmission where viral load fell below a threshold of
between 50 and 500 copies/mL (depending on the study)
[39]. Another study reported no transmission when viral load
was lower than 400 copies/mL [40]. A number of other stud-
ies have provided evidence that low (but detectable) viral load
dramatically decreases (and may eliminate) the possibility of
transmission. For example, early studies involving participants
who were not taking antiretroviral therapy identified no
instances of transmission among couples where one partner
was living with HIV and had a low but detectable viral load:
below 1500 copies/mL (Uganda) [32], below 1094 copies/mL
(Thailand) [33] and below 1000 copies/mL (Zambia) [34]. The
Ugandan study found that the probability of transmission
through vaginal intercourse where viral load was lower than
1700 copies/mL was 1 in 10,000 [41].
While short-lived, small-magnitude increases in viral load,
known as “blips,” occur among many individuals adhering to their
antiretroviral therapy [42,43], they are not an indication that HIV
therapy is “failing;” are not considered to be clinically significant;
and have not been shown to increase the possibility of HIV trans-
mission during sex [44,45]. Large-scale studies among couples of
different HIV status have included many HIV-positive partici-
pants who experienced blips in their viral load during the course
of the study. Consequently, such blips have been factored into
the observed reduction in transmissions.
• Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) significantly decreases the
possibility of HIV acquisition
PrEP describes the use of antiretroviral medication by HIV-
negative people prior to HIV exposure to prevent HIV acquisi-
tion [46-50]. One recent study has found PrEP to be up to
95% effective among adherent users [50], however, only a
handful of cases of PrEP failures in adherent individuals have
ever been described suggesting that it is likely that PrEP is
more than 95% effective.
• Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) significantly decreases the
possibility of HIV acquisition
PEP describes short-term use of antiretroviral treatment
by an HIV-negative person after an exposure to HIV. If
Barr�

4
 started within 72 hours of exposure and taken for 28 days with
good adherence, PEP significantly reduces the likelihood of the
person becoming HIV-positive because it can stop HIV from
establishing itself in a person’s immune cells even after the virus
has entered a person’s body [51,52]. Although PEP is not 100%
effective, high rates of success have been reported [51,53-67]
(e.g. 81% among patients using older-style treatments [67] and
up to 100% among patients using newer treatments [68]). The
effectiveness of PEP appears to be influenced by a number of
factors, with effectiveness generally increasing the sooner PEP is
commenced and as the amount of HIV entering a person’s body
decreases [68].
• Medical Male Circumcision decreases the possibility of HIV
transmission from women to men
Medical male circumcision reduces the possibility of HIV
transmission from HIV-positive women to HIV-negative men by
approximately 50% [69]. Circumcision may also decrease sexual
transmission of HIV among men who have sex with men for
HIV-negative men who are exclusively the insertive partner,
although studies are not conclusive [70].
• Risk reduction practices such as withdrawal or strategic
positioning decrease the possibility of HIV transmission
Some people living with HIV use risk reduction practices
such as withdrawal prior to ejaculation or strategic positioning
(i.e. receptive-only anal intercourse) when engaging in con-
domless sex with an HIV-negative person or person of
unknown serostatus [71-73]. Such actions decrease the possi-
bility of HIV transmission during sex where a possibility exists
[71]. For example, a 2010 study found that the likelihood of
transmission during anal sex reduced by approximately two-
thirds when the HIV-positive insertive partner did not ejacu-
late [73]. The possibility of transmission is also known to be
lower when an HIV-positive partner is the receptive, rather
than insertive, partner during anal sex [73-75].
• Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) can increase the pos-
sibility of HIV transmission in some circumstances
The presence of some untreated STIs, particularly ulcerative
STIs, in either partner has been associated with an increased
likelihood of HIV transmission during sexual activity when the
person living with HIV does not have a low viral load [76].
When genital ulcers are present in both partners, the risk is
further increased [14]. However, the presence of an STI does
not increase the possibility of transmission if the HIV-positive
person is on effective antiretroviral therapy [30], or if the
HIV-negative person is taking PrEP [48,49].

The possibility of HIV transmission through
sex
HIV transmission through sex usually occurs as a result of
bodily fluids containing enough HIV coming into contact with
mucous membranes located in: the foreskin or urethra of the
penis; the cervix or vagina; the anus; or the rectum. HIV trans-
mission is also possible through contact with oral mucous
membranes but these are much less vulnerable to HIV trans-
mission [58].
2.3.1
|
Oral sex, including oral-penile sex and oral-
vaginal sex
 The possibility of HIV transmission from oral sex per-
formed on an HIV-positive person, including when the per-
son does not have a low viral load and/or a condom is not
used, varies from none to negligible depending on the
context [77,78].
Oral sex is promoted as a safer sex option for partners of
different HIV status wanting to engage in intimate sexual acts,
with its practice reportedly very common.
Oral sex is known to involve a much lower possibility of
HIV transmission than vaginal or anal intercourse [79,80]. In
fact, the risk of HIV transmission as a result of oral sex is so
low that scientists have been unable to establish a statistically
sound estimate.
The few clinical studies investigating transmission through
oral sex have failed to find any cases of HIV transmission
[74,81,82]. A study of heterosexual couples and a study of les-
bian couples found no transmission resulting from oral sex
[81,82]. A third study involving men who have sex with men
showed no seroconversions among participants who reported
performing only fellatio (with ejaculation) on men who were
HIV-positive or of unknown HIV status [74]. A statistical
model applied to these findings concluded that the per-con-
tact risk from oral sex was between zero and 0.04% (4 in
10,000) [78] and these values are used in some reports
[79,80,83]. Given the study found no seroconversions, the
upper bound of 0.04% can be understood as an upper bound-
ary of possibility.
 There is no possibility of HIV transmission from oral sex
performed on an HIV-positive person when the HIV-posi-
tive partner has a low viral load, or a condom is properly
used, or the HIV-negative partner is taking PrEP [78].
While there are no studies investigating the impact of
antiretroviral therapy or PrEP on the possibility of transmis-
sion during oral sex, it is our expert opinion that there is no
possibility of HIV transmission associated with oral sex per-
formed on an HIV-positive individual on antiretroviral therapy,
or performed by a person taking PrEP. Similarly, correct con-
dom use reduces the likelihood of HIV transmission to zero.
2.3.2
|
Vaginal-penile intercourse
 The possibility of HIV transmission from vaginal-penile
intercourse when the HIV-positive partner does not have
a low viral load and a condom is not used is low [84]. The
likelihood of transmission decreases further if no ejacula-
tion occurs inside the HIV-negative partner’s body.
Two meta-analyses of heterosexual couples [14,84] found
the likelihood of HIV transmission during one act of vaginal
intercourse is low: 0.08% (8 in 10,000) in the absence of risk
cofactors [5,14,41,84]. It is not clear whether the likelihood of
transmitting HIV from a man to a woman during vaginal inter-
course is higher than transmission from a woman to a man.
Some studies have found no difference, while others suggest

5
 the possibility of HIV transmission from a man to a woman is
about twice that of transmission from a woman to a man
[14,35,83,84].
 The possibility of HIV transmission from vaginal-penile
intercourse when the HIV-positive partner has a low viral
load or uses a condom or the HIV-negative partner is tak-
ing PrEP varies from none to negligible depending on the
context [29,38].
Numerous studies, as discussed above, have shown that the
possibility of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive partner
who has a low viral load during vaginal-penile intercourse is
none to negligible [29,37-39,85]. There has not been a
reported case of transmission through vaginal-penile inter-
course from a person with an undetectable viral load in any
clinical trial.
HIV cannot be transmitted when a condom is used correctly
because HIV cannot pass through intact latex or polyurethane.
Similarly, there is no possibility of HIV transmission when a
person has an undetectable viral load.
2.3.3
|
Anal-penile intercourse
 The possibility of HIV transmission when a condom is not
used and the HIV-positive partner does not have a low
viral load is low, whether the receptive partner is male or
female [86]. The likelihood is lower where the HIV-positive
partner takes the receptive, rather than the insertive, role.
It is also lower if the HIV-positive insertive partner does
not ejaculate inside the receptive partner.
Studies show that receptive condomless anal intercourse by
heterosexual or same-sex couples is associated with a higher
likelihood of HIV transmission than receptive condomless vagi-
nal intercourse [5,87,88]. Individual studies have produced
estimates of per-act likelihood of HIV transmission for anal
sex from 0.01% (1 in 10,000) to more than 3% (300 in
10,000) [20,75,84,88-91]. The likelihood of transmitting from
the insertive to the receptive partner is higher than the
reverse [18,75,84].
Two systematic reviews (2010 and 2014) report a per-act
estimate of approximately 1.4% (140 in 10,000) for receptive
anal sex (i.e. when the HIV-positive person is the insertive part-
ner) [5,86]. A 2010 prospective cohort study found that the
likelihood fell from 1.43% (143 per 10,000) with ejaculation to
0.54% (54 per 10,000) with no ejaculation [89]. Per-act likeli-
hood of transmission was estimated to be 0.11% (11 in
10,000) when the HIV-negative person is the insertive partner
[5].
 The possibility of HIV transmission through anal-penile
intercourse when the HIV-positive partner has a low viral
load, or uses a condom, or the HIV-negative partner is
taking PrEP varies from none to negligible depending on
the context The likelihood is similar whether the receptive
partner is male or female [85,86].
There is negligible possibility of HIV transmission from an
HIV-positive partner who has a low viral load during anal-
penile intercourse. As discussed above, both the PARTNER
study and the Opposites Attract study observed no transmis-
sion after approximately 39,000 acts of condomless anal sex
when viral load was below 200 copies/mL [30,92]. In fact,
there has not been a reported case of transmission from a
person with an undetectable viral load in any clinical trial.
HIV cannot be transmitted when a condom is used correctly
because HIV cannot pass through intact latex or polyurethane.
Similarly, there is no possibility of HIV transmission when a
person has an undetectable viral load.

The possibility of HIV transmission from
casual contact, spitting and biting
2.4.1
|
Casual contact
HIV cannot be transmitted via contact with an environmental
surface such as a chair, bench or toilet; from food or drink; or
from casual human contact such as hugging, sharing household
objects or eating together.
HIV cannot survive long in air and is unable to penetrate
intact skin. No case of HIV infection from contact with an
environmental surface, food or drink or through casual human
contact has ever been identified despite many scientific stud-
ies considering this possibility [93-98].
2.4.2
|
Biting and spitting
 There is no possibility of HIV transmission via contact with
the saliva of an HIV-positive person, including through
kissing, biting or spiting.
Numerous studies have considered the possibility of HIV
transmission via saliva but none has found any evidence,
including a 1997 study of 34,000 cases in the UK [99]. The
absence of HIV transmission via saliva is attributed to two
factors: saliva contains a very small amount of HIV [100],
and several inhibitory components in oral secretions mean
saliva acts to protect susceptible cells from HIV infection
[101-106].
 There is no possibility of HIV transmission from biting or
spitting where the HIV-positive person’s saliva contains
no, or a small quantity of, blood.
Current evidence suggests HIV cannot be transmitted even
when saliva contains small quantities of blood. Despite early
research suggesting a theoretical risk of transmission if saliva-
containing blood enters a person’s body through contact with
mucosal tissue (for example, landing in an eye or mouth), no
cases of HIV transmission resulting from the spitting of blood
have been reported [107]. Consequently, it is our expert opin-
ion that there is no possibility of HIV transmission from saliva
containing small quantities of blood.
 The possibility of HIV transmission from biting where the
HIV-positive person’s saliva contains a significant quantity
of blood, and their blood comes into contact with a
mucous membrane or open wound, and their viral load is
not low or undetectable varies from none to negligible.

 Many studies have detailed a large number of cases where
bites have not resulted in HIV transmission [108-112] or
found transmission to be unlikely [107,109,113,114].
For transmission to be plausible in the case of biting, the
HIV-positive person must have blood in their mouth at the
time of the bite, a sufficient amount of HIV must be present
in the blood of the HIV-positive person, and the bite must be
deep enough to penetrate the HIV-negative person’s skin
causing trauma and tissue damage [106,107,115]. Even when
all these conditions are present, the possibility of transmission
during a single bite is negligible at most.

Significant improvements in life expectancy
and quality of life for people living with HIV
The second section of this Consensus Statement considers
the harms of HIV because persistent misconceptions exagger-
ating the harms of HIV infection appear to influence applica-
tion of the criminal law [3]. Criminal law takes into account
the possible harms caused by a potential offence as well as
the likelihood of the offence itself, thus, for example, defini-
tions of bodily harm are distinct from grievous bodily harm,
which are distinct from manslaughter or murder. Conse-
quently, it is important to emphasize the huge changes in the
outlook for people living with HIV that have been achieved
over the past decades.
The natural course of untreated HIV infection varies widely
from person to person [116]. If untreated, most people experi-
ence an asymptomatic phase that lasts from two to 15 years,
during which the virus replicates, gradually undermining their
immune system. A small percentage of people with HIV have
immune systems that block replication of the virus for an
indefinite period [117], but the large majority of people even-
tually develop AIDS if untreated (approximately half within
10 years [118]). AIDS is defined as the presence of specific
laboratory markers and/or opportunistic infections and specific
diseases which, if antiretroviral therapy is not commenced,
eventually result in a person’s death.
Antiretroviral therapies dramatically reduce HIV-associated
disease progression. Globally, treatment guidelines have been
revised to recommend initiation of antiretroviral treatment
immediately following diagnosis of HIV infection because most
people on treatment will achieve an undetectable viral load
and maintain a healthy immune system, will remain in good
health, and will avoid the complications of long-term HIV
infection [119,120]. Even those who start treatment with a
high viral load and adhere to therapy can expect a dramatic
reduction in viral load, to a point where significant immune
system recovery occurs so that they can enjoy good long-term
health [121]. For many, effective treatment requires taking a
single pill each day.
Studies from many countries have consistently shown that
antiretroviral therapies have radically increased life expec-
tancy, that life expectancy has continued to improve over
time, and that the long-term health and quality of life of
people living with HIV has drastically improved [122-141].
Life expectancy for young people with HIV commencing
antiretroviral therapy now approaches that of a young per-
son in the general population [45,132,134,135,137]. Further-
more, use of antiretroviral therapies has shifted cause of
death of people
living
with HIV from traditional AIDS-
defining illnesses to non-HIV-related causes [142,143] similar
to those affecting the general population [144]. Similarly, clin-
ical management has shifted to include management and
treatment of health issues associated with aging, including
menopause and cardiovascular disease [143-150], and inter-
ventions to influence “lifestyle choices” such as
tobacco
smoking [151]. In some sub-populations, ongoing clinical care
has the potential to increase life expectancy of people living
with HIV beyond that of their HIV-negative counterparts
[135].
Although HIV causes an infection that requires continuous
treatment with antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV
can live long, productive lives including working, studying, trav-
elling, having relationships, having and raising children, and
contributing to society in various other ways.

Establishing proof of HIV transmission
The final section of this Consensus Statement recognizes the
importance of the correct use of scientific and medical evi-
dence in HIV-related prosecutions where proof of actual
transmission from one person to another is at issue.
International guidance on HIV in the context of the criminal
law recommends that “proof of causation, in relation to HIV
transmission, should always be based on evidence derived
from a number of relevant sources, including medical records,
rigorous scientific methods and sexual history” [1].
 Medical records can provide contextual information but
cannot establish transmission between a complainant and
a defendant.
The circumstances of the nature and timing of a sexual rela-
tionship or other potential sources of a person’s HIV infection
must be central to any case where sexual transmission of HIV is
alleged. When available and lawfully obtained, medical records
are valuable for identifying the last HIV-negative and first HIV-
positive test of the complainant and the defendant. Considering
the diagnostic window period of each test, this information can
be used to establish the period during which the complainant
acquired HIV and whether the defendant was HIV-positive dur-
ing this time. Importantly, whether the complainant or defendant
was infected first cannot be based on who tested HIV-positive
first or which person brought charges against the other.
Information related to HIV viral load and CD4 counts
included in medical records has sometimes been presented as
evidence establishing the timing of HIV infection. However,
viral loads and CD4 counts show considerable inter- and
intra-individual variation and therefore cannot be used to
determine exactly when someone acquired HIV [152].
 Phylogenetic analysis can be used as a forensic tool. The
results can be compatible with, but cannot conclusively
prove, the claim that a defendant has infected a com-
plainant. Importantly, phylogenetic results can exonerate a
defendant when the results are not compatible with the
allegation that the defendant infected the complainant.
Phylogenetic analysis compares the evolutionary relation-
ship between different persons’ HIV, but results must be
interpreted cautiously alongside other factual and medical evi-
dence when used in criminal cases [153]. The complexity of
Barr�

7
 phylogenetic analysis arises, in part, from the fact that HIV is
a fast-evolving virus. Mutations of the virus occur repeatedly
so that every person living with HIV has more than one virus
variant [154]. During transmission, a limited number of virus
variants (one to a few) are transmitted, but these will also
mutate to form new variants so that no two persons’ HIV is
identical [155].
Phylogenetic analysis of HIV involves estimating the evolu-
tionary relationships of HIV variants, for example, to investi-
gate HIV transmission networks for public health purposes.
In criminal cases, phylogenetic analysis involves investigating
whether the complainant(s) and the defendant(s) are part of
the same transmission network. The network is represented
as a phylogenetic “tree.” Notably, the phylogenetic tree must
be understood as an HIV gene tree, which may differ from
the transmission history, because HIV variants may predate
transmission
or
disappear
after
transmission
[156]
and
because some persons in the transmission network may not
have been diagnosed and/or sampled before constructing
the tree.
HIV phylogenetics is very different from profiling of human
DNA as, given the ongoing evolution of each person’s HIV
variants, phylogenetics cannot obtain an “exact match.” When
there appears to be a “phylogenetic match” between two indi-
viduals’ HIV it means two or more variants are epidemiologi-
cally “linked”, not that they are the same [155,157]. HIV
phylogenetic evidence can exonerate a defendant accused of
transmitting HIV to a complainant because if the virus strains
detected in the defendant and complainant are unrelated, the
phylogenetic evidence conclusively contradicts the claim that
the defendant was the source of the complainant’s virus.
[155,158].
Recent advances in DNA sequencing and phylogenetics
allow some consideration of direction and timing of transmis-
sion [159-162], but these methods are currently neither pre-
cise nor accurate enough to prove who infected whom
[155,163]. This
is
partly
because
there
may
always
be
unknown and undiagnosed individuals from the transmission
network [155]. Consequently, currently phylogenetic analysis
cannot eliminate the possibilities that the complainant infected
the defendant, that both were infected by a third party
[158,163], or more complex scenarios of transmission that
have resulted in the defendant and complainant having HIV
variants that are epidemiologically linked. The fact that having
HIV does not protect against a subsequent “super”-infection
with a different variant adds complexity [158]. In particular,
confidence about the direction of infection is undermined
when a defendant and complainant have engaged in numerous
sexual acts which may have facilitated multiple transmission
events back and forth [155].
Phylogenetic analysis is complex, and consequently it is
important that HIV phylogenetics for forensic purposes is per-
formed and interpreted by experts who fully understand the
limitations of the technique and explicitly state these limita-
tions in written reports and oral testimony. Interpretation of
phylogenetic results for forensic purposes requires expertise
about phylogenetics and the distinction between virus evolu-
tionary trees and transmission histories. This is not straightfor-
ward and methodologies have not yet been standardized
[155]. The reliability of evidence derived from phylogenetic
analysis depends on a number of methodological factors
including use of adequate “local controls” [164-166] and data-
base sequences [167-169] which must be selected using con-
sistent selection criteria [155]. International research shows
that phylogenetic evidence used in criminal trials has not
always satisfied these requirements [155].

CONCLUSIONS
Given the evidence presented in this document, we strongly
recommend that more caution be exercised when considering
criminal prosecution, including careful appraisal of current sci-
entific evidence on HIV-related risks and harms. This is instru-
mental to reduce stigma and discrimination and to avoid
miscarriages of justice.
In this context, we hope this Consensus Statement will
encourage governments and those working in the legal and
judicial system to pay close attention to the significant
advances in HIV science that have occurred over the last
three decades, and make all efforts to ensure that a correct
and complete understanding of current scientific knowledge
informs any application of the criminal law in cases related to
HIV.
