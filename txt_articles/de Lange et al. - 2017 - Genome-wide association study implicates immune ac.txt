Abstract
Genetic association studies have identified 215 risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease 1–8, 
which have revealed fundamental aspects of its molecular biology. We performed a genome-wide 
association study of 25,305 individuals, and meta-analyzed with published summary statistics, 
yielding a total sample size of 59,957 subjects. We identified 25 new loci, three of which contain 
integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways identified as important therapeutic targets in 
inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in 
response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4, ITGB8) and at previously implicated 
loci (ITGAL, ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression increasing allele also increases disease 
risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in the primary immune deficiency gene 
PLCG2 and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new 
common variant associations continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification 
and prioritization.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, debilitating, disorder of the gastrointestinal 
tract that includes two common disease subtypes, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. 
Disease pathogenesis is poorly understood but is likely driven by a dysregulated immune 
response to unknown environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals. 
Treatment regimes often use potent immunomodulators to achieve and maintain remission of 
symptoms. However, patients commonly experience side effects, lose response to treatment, 
or develop complications of IBD, with many ultimately requiring major abdominal surgery. 
Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and targeted follow-up using the 
Immunochip have been very successful at identifying genetic risk loci for IBD, but increased 
biological understanding has not yet had a significant impact on therapy for these disorders.
In order to further expand our understanding of the biology of these disorders we carried out 
a GWAS of 12,160 IBD cases and 13,145 population controls of European ancestry that had 
not been included in any genome-wide meta-analysis of IBD to date (Supplementary Table 
1, Online Methods). We imputed genotypes using a reference panel comprising whole 
genome sequences from 4,686 IBD cases9 and 6,285 publically available population 
controls10,11. Following quality control (Online Methods) we tested 9.7 million sites for 
association. At the 232 IBD associated SNPs in the latest meta-analysis by the International 
IBD Genetics Consortium1, 228 had effects in the same direction in our data, 188 showed at 
least nominal evidence of replication (P<0.05) and none showed significant evidence of 
heterogeneity of effect by Cochrane’s Q test. Among these replicated loci was a genome-
wide significant association on chromosome 10q25 that was only previously significantly 
associated with Crohn’s disease in individuals of East Asian ancestry3,7, further supporting 
near complete sharing of genetic risk loci across populations1. We meta-analyzed our new 
GWAS data with previously published summary statistics from 12,882 IBD cases and 
21,770 population controls imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel1 
(Supplementary Figures 1-3, Supplementary Table 2). We observed inflation of the summary 
statistics (λGC = 1.23 and 1.29 for Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, respectively), but LD score 
regression demonstrated that this was due to broad polygenic signal, rather than confounding 
population substructure (both intercepts = 1.09, Online Methods).
We identified 25 new loci at genome-wide significance (Table 1). In order to identify causal 
variants, genes and mechanisms, we performed a summary-statistic fine-mapping analysis 
on these loci, as well as 40 previously discovered loci that were genome-wide significant in 
our data but where fine-mapping had not yet been attempted12 (Online Methods, 
Supplementary Table 3). In order to be confident about fine-mapping inferences, we 
restricted subsequent analyses to 12 signals where we had high quality imputed data for all 
relevant variants (Online Methods). At 6 of these 12 loci we identified a single variant with 
>50% probability of being causal (Table 2, Supplementary Figures 4-6). Among these were 
two loci where a single variant had >99% probability of being causal: a missense variant 
predicted to affect protein function in SLAMF8, (rs34687326, p.Gly99Ser, Figure 1a), and 
an intronic variant in the key regulator of Th17 cell differentiation, RORC13. SLAMF8 is a 
cell surface receptor that is expressed on activated myeloid cells and has been reported to 
negatively regulate inflammatory responses by inhibiting their migration to sites of 
inflammation14 and repressing their production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)15. This,

 together with the observation that the risk-decreasing allele (MAF=0.1) is predicted to affect 
protein function (CADD=32.0, 92nd percentile of missense variants)16, suggests further 
experiments evaluating a possible gain-of-function mechanism may be worthwhile. RORC 
encodes RORγt, the master transcriptional regulator of Th17 cells13 and group 3 innate 
lymphoid cells17. Both of these cell types play important roles in defence at mucosal 
surfaces, especially in the intestine, and have been shown to contribute to the homeostasis 
between the intestinal immune system and gut microbiota18,19, an equilibrium that is 
known to be lost in inflammatory bowel disease20. Pharmacologic inhibition of RORγt has 
been shown to offer therapeutic benefit in mouse models of intestinal inflammation, and 
reduces the frequency of Th17 cells isolated from primary intestinal samples of IBD 
patients21.
In loci where fine-mapping was less clearly resolved, we searched for likely functional 
variants, observing a missense variant (CADD=16.5, 50.2% probability of causality) in 
PLCG2. Furthermore, after conditioning on this variant, we discovered a second, 
independent, likely functional (CADD=34.0, 74.6% probability of causality) missense 
variant in the same gene (P=2x10-8). PLCG2 encodes a phospholipase enzyme that plays a 
critical role in regulating immune pathway signalling22, and has previously been implicated 
in two autosomal dominant immune disorders. Intragenic deletions in its autoinhibitory 
domain cause antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (familial cold 
autoinflammatory syndrome 3, MIM 614468)23 and heterozygous missense variants (e.g. 
p.Ser707Tyr) lead to a phenotype that includes intestinal inflammation24 (Figure 1b).
A more general overlap between candidate IBD GWAS genes and Mendelian disorders of 
inflammation and immunity has been previously observed in 163 loci discovered at that 
time25. We replicated this finding in our list of 241 loci (p < 10-6, Supplementary Table 4), 
and observed that this enrichment is even stronger when considering just the 26 loci where a 
gene can be confidently implicated by fine-mapping to a coding variant or colocalisation 
with an eQTL (27% vs 3%, p=2x10-5). In addition to PLCG2 we identified an association 
between Crohn’s disease and an intronic variant in NCF4 (P=1.76x10-8). This gene encodes 
p40phox, a component of the NADPH-oxidase system that is responsible for the oxidative 
burst in innate immune cells and which is a key mechanism of killing phagocytosed bacteria. 
Rare pathogenic variants in NCF4 cause autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease, 
characterized by Crohn’s disease-like intestinal inflammation and defective ROS production 
in neutrophils26. Our associated variant, rs4821544, had previously been suggestively 
associated with small bowel Crohn’s disease27,28, and when we stratified patients by 
disease location we found that the effect was consistently stronger for small bowel compared 
to large bowel disease (Supplementary Figure 7).
Among the remaining 21 novel loci we noted three that were within 150kb of integrin genes 
(ITGA4, ITGAV and ITGB8), while a previously associated locus overlaps with a fourth 
integrin, ITGAL. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that there is an IBD specific 
association that affects expression of ICAM1, which encodes the binding partner of 
ITGAL29. Integrins are cell adhesion mediators with bi-directional signalling capabilities 
that play a crucial role in leukocyte homing and cell differentiation in inflammation and 
cancer30. Given the strong candidacy of these genes, we sought potentially causal molecular

 mechanisms that would connect the IBD associated SNPs to integrin regulation. Our fine-
mapping analysis excluded the possibility that these associations are caused by protein-
coding changes, so we next tested for effects of IBD risk SNPs on integrin gene expression 
in immune cells using twelve publicly available eQTL datasets. While many eQTLs and 
GWAS signals show some degree of correlation, inferences about causality require more 
robust statistical co-localization of the two signals. Remarkably, we observed three of our 
five associations had >90% probability of being driven by the same variants as monocyte-
specific stimulus response eQTLs (ITGA4, PLPS_24hr=0.984; ITGAL, PLPS_24hr=0.980; 
ICAM1, PLPS_2hr=0.961; Supplementary Table 5). A fourth association, ITGB8, is difficult 
to map due to extended linkage disequilibrium in the locus, but shows intermediate evidence 
of co-localization (PLPS_24hr=0.712) in response to the same stimulus (Figure 2). All four of 
the IBD risk increasing alleles upregulate expression of their respective genes, suggesting 
that increased levels of pro-inflammatory cell surface markers in response to stimulus may 
be a consistent mechanism of action. Proving this hypothesis would require showing that 
IBD risk alleles causally change stimulus-response expression (e.g. by targeted editing of 
each allele in cell lines homozygous for the low risk haplotype), and moreover that such 
changes have physiological relevance to disease processes.
One line of evidence that supports such disease relevance for integrins and their counter-
receptors is their recent emergence as important therapeutic targets in IBD. Most 
promisingly, the monoclonal antibodies vedolizumab and etrolizumab, which target the 
components of the α4β7 dimer (encoded by ITGA4 and ITGB7, and responsible for the gut-
homing specificity of certain leukocytes), have demonstrated efficacy in IBD31–33. 
Additionally, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting ICAM1 has shown promise in the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis and pouchitis34. The importance of gut-selectivity for 
therapeutic approaches is highlighted by the antibodies that bind the αL and α4 integrin 
subunits (encoded by ITGAL and ITGA4, respectively). Therapies targeting αL 
(efalizumab) and α4 (natalizumab) demonstrated potential in Crohn’s disease35,36, but both 
medications have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML)37. This potentially fatal condition is likely mediated by binding to integrin dimers 
that are not gut-specific, leading to impaired leukocyte migration to the central nervous 
system and JC virus infection of the brain. Owing to the risk of PML, efalizumab has been 
withdrawn from the market and natalizumab is not licensed for Crohn’s disease in Europe.
Integrins are not only important in cell trafficking, but can also participate in cellular 
signalling. For example, the αVβ8 heterodimer – both subunits of which are encoded by 
genes which are now within confirmed IBD loci (ITGAV and ITGB8, respectively) – is a 
potent activator of TGFβ38, with a range of cell-type specific effects. Furthermore, mice 
with dendritic-cell specific deletion of this complex had impaired regulatory T cell function 
and severe colitis39, whereas deleting the complex in regulatory T cells themselves 
prevented them from suppressing pathogenic T cell responses during active inflammation40. 
While no current IBD therapeutics target αVβ8 directly, promising early results of an oral 
antisense oligonucleotide to the inhibitory TGFβ-signalling protein SMAD741, itself 
encoded by a locus identified by genetic association studies25, demonstrate the therapeutic 
potential of modifying TGFβ signaling in Crohn’s disease.

 In addition to the connections to anti-integrin and anti-TGFβ therapies described above, IBD 
GWAS have previously implicated loci containing other therapeutically relevant genes, such 
as those in signalling pathways relevant to the targets of anti-TNF and anti-p40 IBD 
therapies (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 6). These discoveries have demonstrated that the 
importance of the biological pathways underlying associations, and their potential 
therapeutic relevance, are not necessarily reflected in their GWAS effect sizes. For example, 
the modest odds ratios of the signals near integrin genes (1.10-1.12) required tens of 
thousands of samples to detect at genome-wide significance. Furthermore, analyses aimed at 
understanding the specific cellular contexts in which these genes are active in IBD, as well 
as the risk-increasing direction of effect (e.g. consistent up-regulation of integrins in 
response to LPS stimulus), are only beginning to bear fruit.
Our study has demonstrated that continuing to pursue GWAS, even in a well studied 
complex disease like IBD, has the potential to complement other powerful approaches, such 
as targeted genotyping (via the Immunochip) and large-scale genome and exome 
sequencing. In two cases we have implicated genes in which different variants have 
previously been shown to cause immune-related Mendelian disorders, echoing a connection 
made to the very first Crohn’s disease risk gene, NOD2, in which rare missense mutations 
cause the autosomal dominant granulomatous disorder Blau syndrome42. Finally, while the 
individual effect sizes of our newly discovered associations are modest, our results show that 
GWAS continues to deliver new loci, which help understand many aspects of disease 
biology, including possible mechanisms of known therapies. For example, four IBD 
associations that plausibly co-localize with changes in integrin expression underscore the 
value of comprehensive catalogs of the regulatory consequences of GWAS variants in 
specific cells and contexts. Even when specific genes are implicated, cellular assays with 
relevance to disease physiology (for example, protein response to bacterial stimulus in 
colonic organoids) will be needed to achieve the ultimate payoff from prospectively mining 
these signals for promising targets for new therapeutics.

New genome-wide genetic data
GWAS samples and genotyping—Following ethical approval by Cambridge MREC 
(reference: 03/5/012), 11,768 British IBD cases, diagnosed using accepted endoscopic, 
histopathological and radiological criteria, were consented into the study and genotyped on 
the Human Core Exome v12.1. 10,484 population control samples genotyped on the Human 
Core Exome v12.0 were obtained from the Understanding Society Project. Genotypes were 
called using optiCall43.

 GWAS quality control—We removed variants that did not overlap between the two 
versions of the chip, had missingness > 5%, a significant difference in call rate between 
cases and controls (P < 1x10-5), deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in 
controls (P < 1x10-5), or that were affected by a genotyping batch effect (significant 
association [P < 1x10-5] between an outlier group of cases discovered using principal 
component analysis [PC1 < -0.005], and the remainder of the samples). We then removed 
samples with missingness > 1%, heterozygosity ±3 standard deviations from the mean, 
mismatch between reported and genotypic sex, first-degree relatives or closer (kinship 
coefficient > 0.177), and non-European samples identified through principal component 
analysis with HapMap3 populations. After quality control, data were available for 4,474 
Crohn’s disease, 4,173 ulcerative colitis, 592 IBD-unclassified cases and 9,500 controls for 
296,203 variants.
Whole-genome sequenced samples—We generated low-coverage whole genome 
sequences for 4,686 IBD cases and 3,781 population controls from the UK IBD Genetics 
Consortium (UKIBDGC) and UK10K Consortium, respectively. Detailed information on 
sequencing, genotype refinement and quality control are described elsewhere9.
Imputation—These sequences were combined with 2,504 samples from the Phase 3 v5 
release of the 1000 Genomes project (2013-05-02 sequence freeze) to create a phased 
imputation reference panel enriched in IBD-associated variants. We used PBWT44 to 
impute from this reference panel (114.2 million total variants) into our new GWAS 
described above.
Association testing, meta-analysis, and quality control
Association testing—Prior to association testing, we removed all samples that were 
included in previous IBD GWAS meta-analyses (Supplementary Table 1). We then tested for 
association to ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and IBD separately within the sequenced 
samples and new GWAS using SNPTEST v2.5, performing an additive frequentist 
association test conditioned on the first ten principal components for each cohort. We 
filtered out variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.1%, INFO < 0.4, or strong 
evidence for deviations from HWE in controls (pHWE<1x10-7).
Meta-analysis—We used METAL (release 2011-03-05) to perform a standard error 
weighted meta-analysis of our sequencing and GWAS cohorts with the publicly available 
International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) meta-analysis 
summary statistics1, after applying the additional MAF ≥ 0.1%, and INFO ≥ 0.4 filters to the 
IIBDGC data.
Quality control—The output of the fixed-effects meta-analysis was further filtered, and 
sites with high evidence for heterogeneity (I2>0.90) were discarded. Only sites for which all 
cohorts passed our quality control filters were included in our analysis. In addition, we 
discarded genome-wide significant variants for which the meta-analysis p-value was not 
lower than all of the cohort-specific p-values.

 LD score regression—We performed LD score regression using LDSC v1.0.0 and 
European linkage disequilibrium (LD) scores from the 1000 Genomes Project (downloaded 
from https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2) on our 
filtered meta-analysis summary statistics for all sites with INFO > 0.95. This INFO 
threshold is to avoid confounding due to poor imputation, as recommended by the 
authors45.
Locus definition
Computing LD windows—An LD window was calculated for every genome-wide 
significant variant in any of the three traits (Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, IBD), defined 
by the left-most and right-most variants that are correlated with the main variant with an r2 
of 0.6 or more. The LD was calculated in the GBR and CEU samples from the 1000 
Genomes Phase 3, release v5 (based on 20130502 sequence freeze and alignments). Loci 
with overlapping LD windows, as well as loci whose lead variants were separated by 500kb 
or less, were subsequently merged, and the variant with the strongest evidence of being 
associated was kept as the lead variant for each merged locus.
Identifying novel loci—A locus was annotated as known if it contained at least one 
variant previously reported at genome-wide significance (irrespective of the LD between that 
variant and the most associated variants in the locus). To ensure that putatively novel signals 
were not due to long-range LD with variants in previously reported loci, we conducted 
conditional analysis in our new GWAS for all variants in loci which were less than 3Mb 
away from a known locus. Putatively novel loci already known in a lower order IBD trait 
(e.g. a previously known Crohn’s disease locus coming up as an IBD locus) were also 
removed from this list. This did not apply where, for example, a known Crohn’s disease 
locus was now associated with ulcerative colitis, or vice versa.
Fine-mapping
Approximate Bayes factors were calculated from the meta-analysis effect sizes and standard 
errors described above by applying equation (2) of Wakefield46, assuming a prior variance 
on the log odds ratios of 0.04 (the default prior used by the software SNPTest, and used by 
Maller et al47). We then performed fine-mapping using these Bayes factors as described in 
Maller et al to calculate the posterior that each variant is causal, and the 95% credible set for 
each association (the smallest set of variants with posteriors that sum to at least 95%). For 
each association we use the meta-analysis results for the phenotype (Crohn’s disease, 
ulcerative colitis or IBD) specified in Supplementary Table 2. We only consider a locus to be 
confidently fine-mapped if there are no variants in the Phase 3 v5 release of the 1000 
Genomes project (2013-05-02 sequence freeze) in high LD (r2 ≥ 0.6) with our hit SNP, but 
missing from our dataset, and no variants in our data within high LD (r2 > 0.8) that fail 
during our QC procedure.
eQTL overlap
Identifying eQTL overlaps—Twelve eQTL datasets were searched to identify variants 
within the 25 newly identified IBD risk loci that are associated with variation in gene 
expression (Supplementary Table 7). Splice-QTLs based on exon-ratio48 and transcript-
de Lange et al.

 ratio49–51 were also included in the search where available (Supplementary Table 7). The 
most significant variant-gene associations were extracted from each eQTL/splice-QTL 
dataset and were reported as candidates if that variant had r2 > 0.8 with any of the lead SNPs 
in the 25 IBD risk loci.
Testing for co-localization—We tested for co-localization between IBD association 
signals and eQTLs using the coloc2 method52, implemented in the R package coloc. We 
used a window size of 250kb on either side of the IBD association, and implemented the 
default settings as recommended. Each test was repeated using two different values for the 
prior probability of co-localization, p12: 1x10-5 and 1x10-6.
Signalling pathway definitions
We identify the following immune pathways as relevant to classes of approved IBD 
therapeutics: the IL12 and IL23 signalling pathways (ustekinumab53), the TNFa signalling 
pathway (infliximab54, adalimumab55), and the integrin signalling pathway 
(vedolizumab31,32). Genes involved in these pathways were identified from the Molecular 
Signatures Database canonical pathways gene sets (C2; http://software.broadinstitute.org/
gsea/msigdb/genesets.jsp?collection=CP). These gene lists had been previously curated by 
the Pathway Interaction Database56. The integrin signalling gene list was comprised of all 
unique genes from the following gene sets: integrin beta1 pathway 
(PID_INTEGRIN1_PATHWAY), integrin beta7 pathway (PID_INTEGRIN5_PATHWAY) 
and integrin cell surface interactions (PID_INTEGRIN_CS_PATHWAY). The list of TNFa 
signalling genes was obtained from PID_TNF_PATHWAY and the list of IL-23/IL-12 p40 
signalling genes was comprised of all unique genes from the PID_IL12_PATHWAY and 
PID_IL23_PATHWAY.

 Figure 1. Likely causal missense variants.
For A) SLAMF8 and B) PLCG2, local association results are plotted with point size 
corresponding to LD to our lead variant and color to fine-mapping probability (purple > 
50%, intermediate blue 10-50%, navy blue <10%). Gene body diagrams and protein domain 
annotations are taken from ENSEMBL, and partial predicted crystal structures for both 
proteins are obtained from the SWISS-MODEL repository.

 Figure 3. IBD-associated loci containing genes in immune pathways related to classes of 
approved therapeutics.
All IBD loci are divided into the studies where they were first identified1. Loci that contain 
a gene in one of four signalling pathways related to targets of three classes of approved IBD 
therapeutics (Online Methods) are highlighted, with those where the pathway gene has been 
confidently identified as the causal IBD gene labelled. Despite the general pattern that effect 
size decreases from left to right, therapeutically relevant associations continue to be found.
