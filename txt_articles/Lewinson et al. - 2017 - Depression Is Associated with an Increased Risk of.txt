The factors that contribute to the development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) among patients with psoriasis are not
well known; however, systemic inflammation is believed to be important. On the basis of recent laboratory
work demonstrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with increased systemic inflammation,
we hypothesized that patients with psoriasis who develop MDD are at increased risk of subsequently devel-
oping PsA. We utilized The Health Improvement Network, a primary care medical records database, to identify
73,447 individuals with psoriasis. Patients were followed up to 25 years until the development of the primary
outcome of PsA or the censor date. The exposure of interest was the development of MDD. Cox proportional-
hazards models showed that patients with psoriasis who developed MDD were at significantly increased risk of
subsequently developing PsA compared with patients who did not develop MDD, even after accounting for
numerous covariates (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.05e1.80, P ¼ 0.021). This result was main-
tained through numerous sensitivity analyses. These data support the hypothesis that MDD increases the risk
of developing PsA among patients with psoriasis, suggesting a need for heightened prevention and manage-
ment of MDD in patients with psoriasis.

INTRODUCTION
Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by
pruritic, erythematous, scaling papules, and plaques (Nestle
et al., 2009). Approximately 8.5% of patients with psoriasis
have psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (Ogdie et al., 2013), which is
characterized by psoriasis plus inflammation of joints and other
extra-articular manifestations. Although many studies have
highlighted potential risk factors for PsA development, such as
psoriasis severity (Reich et al., 2009), obesity (Love et al., 2012),
alcohol use (Wu et al., 2015), and smoking (Li et al., 2012), the
pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the develop-
ment of PsA among patients with psoriasis are not well known.
Given the similar genetic and inflammatory associations
between psoriasis and PsA (Huffmeier et al., 2010; Veale et al.,
2005), immune activation to external stressors is a proposed
mechanism (Barnas and Ritchlin, 2015). It is believed that
elevated systemic inflammation contributes to more severe
psoriatic disease (Dowlatshahi et al., 2013), suggesting the
possibility of a particular “threshold” that is crossed leading to
manifestations beyond skin disease.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that individuals with
major depressive disorder (MDD) have elevated serum
inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-a
(Dowlati et al., 2010), and that increased levels of tumor
necrosis factor-a are associated with reduced activity of
serotonin transporters (Krishnadas et al., 2016) relevant to
MDD pathophysiology. Also, both psoriasis and PsA are
associated with MDD (Dalgard et al., 2015; Dommasch
et al., 2015; Kurd et al., 2010), commonly attributed to
the physical and/or cosmetic disability incurred by psoriatic
disease. The concept of high levels of systemic inflamma-
tion driving psoriatic disease severity (Dowlatshahi et al.,
2013) warrants an investigation on whether the presence
of MDD may in fact predispose to PsA in patients with
psoriasis. In addition, MDD is known to be associated with
poor health behaviors such as unhealthy diet and physical
inactivity (Trudel-Fitzgerald et al., 2016), which could also
contribute toward the development of PsA. Population-
based studies are ideal to address the role of MDD in PsA
development, given their large and nationally representative
samples, lengthy follow-up times, and ability to determine
risk of incident PsA given an MDD exposure in patients with
psoriasis.

 Our objective was to evaluate clinical data to elucidate the
possible role of MDD in the progression of inflammatory
disease from one organ system (the skin) to involving multiple
organ systems, and thereby highlight a possible risk factor
for PsA development among patients with psoriasis. We
hypothesized that patients with psoriasis and comorbid
incident MDD would be at a greater risk of developing PsA
compared with those who have psoriasis without comorbid
incident MDD.
RESULTS
Participants and descriptive data
We utilized The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a
general practice medical records database in the United
Kingdom (UK), to identify 73,447 individuals with an inci-
dent psoriasis diagnosis who were followed until the devel-
opment of PsA or the censor date (Figure 1). The median
(interquartile range, IQR) age at psoriasis diagnosis was 49.5
years (IQR 19.0 years). The median follow-up time in the
study was 5.1 years (IQR 6.9 years).
Between the study start time at psoriasis diagnosis and the
study end point at PsA diagnosis or censor date, we identified
5,216 (7.1%) patients with psoriasis who developed MDD.
Among those who developed MDD, the median time from
psoriasis diagnosis to MDD diagnosis was 3.1 years (IQR 4.7
years). Those who developed MDD were more likely to be
younger, female, current smokers, with at least one comor-
bidity, socially deprived, and with moderate-severe psoriasis,

identifying eligible patients with
psoriasis within THIN and then

(MDD) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

 and less likely to be obese or alcohol users (all P-values
<0.0001, Table 1). Among patients with moderate-severe
psoriasis, the most commonly used therapies were metho-
trexate and phototherapy (Table 2).
Among all patients with psoriasis, 1,466 (2.0%) developed
PsA during the observation period. Among patients with
psoriasis with MDD, the median time from MDD to PsA was
2.9 years (IQR 4.2 years). Among patients with psoriasis
without MDD, the median time from psoriasis to PsA was 2.6
years (IQR 4.8 years).
Outcomes data
Using Cox-proportional hazards models, we found that patients
with psoriasis who developed MDD had a significantly
increased risk of subsequently developing PsA compared with
those who did not develop MDD (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR]
1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28e1.90, P < 0.0001).
Using a likelihood ratio test simultaneously evaluating the sig-
nificanceof allinteractionterms(eachcovariatebyMDD),there
was no evidence for effect modification (P ¼ 0.387). Through
backward elimination, alcohol use was the only covariate that
was identified as having a potential confounding effect on the
MDD and PsA association among patients with psoriasis. In the
most parsimonious model, adjusted only for alcohol use, MDD
remained a significant risk factor for the development of PsA
among patientswithpsoriasis(HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.10e1.80, P ¼
0.007). To provide a conservative estimate of risk, when
adjusted for all covariates including age, sex, obesity status,
smoking status, alcohol use, Charlson comorbidity index,
Townsend deprivation index, and psoriasis severity, the rela-
tionship remained significant (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05e1.80, P ¼
0.021). There was no evidence against the proportional hazards
assumption based on the Shoenfeld residuals (P ¼ 0.287). These
results are summarized in Table 3 and in Kaplan-Meier failure
curves in Figure 2. Together, these findings support our original
hypothesis that MDD would significantly increase the risk of
developing PsA among individuals with psoriasis.
Sensitivity analyses
When restricting case definitions of psoriasis to only those
whose diagnosis of psoriasis was at least 2 years after registra-
tion in THIN, MDD remained a significant predictor for the
development ofPsA afteradjustmentforall covariates (HR 1.41,
95% CI 1.05e1.90, P ¼ 0.023). Similar results were obtained
when restricting to those with at least 5 years in THIN before
psoriasis diagnosis (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.04e2.33, P ¼ 0.030).
These analyses confirmed that identification of incident psori-
asis was achieved. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to
evaluatethe use ofa moreinclusive therapy list for thedefinition
of moderate-severe psoriasis. In this case, similar results were
obtained showing that MDD increases the risk of developing
PsA (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03e1.77, P ¼ 0.030). An expanded

DISCUSSION
Associations between MDD and psoriasis or PsA have
been documented previously and largely attributed to the
physical or cosmetic disability incurred by psoriatic disease
(Dalgard et al., 2015; Kurd et al., 2010; McDonough et al.,
2014; Schmitt and Ford, 2007). The present study has
expanded our knowledge in this area by identifying a tem-
poral relationship between psoriasis, MDD, and PsA and
conservatively demonstrates that MDD increases the risk of
developing PsA among patients with psoriasis by as much as
37%. As such, this study highlights important considerations
for clinicians, who should exercise heightened awareness
and primary prevention strategies for MDD among patients
with psoriasis, as MDD appears to significantly increase the
risk of developing PsA.
Because we based our definition of psoriasis severity on
the use of systemic therapies (Gelfand et al., 2006; Kurd
et al., 2010), some of which are also used to treat PsA, it
could have been suspected that patients with moderate-
severe psoriasis are protected from PsA as they are being
treated for PsA before it is diagnosed. However, psoriasis
severity was not found to be an effect modifier or confounder
in this study, therefore suggesting that our definition of pso-
riasis severity was not positively or negatively associated with
the outcome of PsA. Similarly, although smoking and obesity
have been documented as risk factors for PsA previously (Li
et al., 2012; Love et al., 2012), these were not found to be
effect
modifiers
or
confounders
in
the
present
study.
Conversely, only alcohol demonstrated a confounding effect
that attenuated the risk of developing PsA among those with
MDD, but the association remained significant.
This study draws into question the role of MDD in the
development of PsA. MDD is known to be associated with
poor health behaviors such as unhealthy diet and physical
inactivity (Trudel-Fitzgerald et al., 2016), and thus it is
possible that these negative health behaviors, indirectly
captured in our data as MDD, contribute toward the devel-
opment of PsA. Supporting this, recent studies have demon-
strated that regular exercise (Naldi et al., 2014), weight loss
(Gisondi et al., 2008), and low-energy diets (Jensen et al.,
2013) can all improve psoriasis symptoms and severity.
Similarly, perceived lack of social support may lead to
increased susceptibility to psoriasis exacerbations (Picardi
et al., 2005). Taken together, it is possible that detrimental
health behaviors associated with MDD may be important
factors that contribute to increased risk of PsA and should be
explored in future studies.
It is well known that both psoriasis and PsA are inflam-
matory diseases with similar underlying serum markers and
genetic links (Huffmeier et al., 2010; Veale et al., 2005);
however, it is relatively recent that MDD is also believed to
contribute to systemic inflammation (Dowlati et al., 2010).
From our results, it remains possible that MDD superimposed
on psoriasis may alter an individual’s inflammation so as to
increase the risk of PsA development. This hypothesis is in
agreement with basic science research showing that MDD is
associated with increased systemic inflammation (Iwata
et al., 2013; Krishnadas et al., 2016). In light of this, further
study of MDD in the context of inflammatory disease seems
crucial. In addition, these results raise the possibility that
although MDD is a distinct medical diagnosis, it could be a
potential manifestation of PsA for select patients, similar to
anterior uveitis, enthesitis, or onycholysis. It should be
highlighted that although our results support the concept of

Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazards ratio
of developing psoriatic arthritis (PsA) based on whether psoriasis patients
were exposed to major depressive disorder or not. As can be seen from
these models, MDD significantly increases the risk of developing PsA
among patients with psoriasis when using unadjusted models as well as
models accounting for numerous covariates.

 MDD and systemic inflammation, systemic inflammation
was not objectively captured in our data, and thus it is not
possible to confirm that this mechanism occurred in the
present study.
At present, it is not possible to discern whether MDD
increased the risk of PsA by means of negative health be-
haviors or systemic inflammation, and this should be a
focus of future research. Importantly, our data show that
MDD contributed to an increased risk of PsA, but this
relationship was not causal, that is, patients with psoriasis
without MDD also developed PsA and not all patients with
psoriasis with MDD developed PsA. Thus, other risk factors
remain to be discovered that also contribute to the devel-
opment of PsA.
Strengths and limitations
This study is strengthened by the use of a population-based
design, a large and nationally representative sample, and
long follow-up time. In addition, the study utilized medical
records from a primary care database, and thus results are
less likely to be affected by a specialty bias. Given the
large sample size, caution must be exercised in deter-
mining the clinical relevance of statistically significant
results.
Patient misclassification was likely infrequent given previ-
ous validation studies on psoriasis and PsA in THIN (Ogdie
et al., 2014; Seminara et al., 2011); however, in cases
where misclassification did occur, it is not expected that
misclassification would occur differentially in favor or against
diagnosis of psoriasis, MDD, PsA, or psoriasis severity
because data were recorded in primary care offices where
hypotheses of our study were not known.
Although we did not assess health care utilization directly
as a confounder in the association between exposure and
outcome, which could introduce surveillance bias for the
outcome, we did include the Charlson comorbidity index as
an indirect measure. We also note that UK NICE guidelines
(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2012)
recommend annual screening of all patients with psoriasis for
PsA using validated tools and referral to a rheumatologist for
complete workup when PsA is suspected. As a result, both
the referent and MDD groups should have been actively
screened for PsA, and therefore the risk of surveillance bias
should be minimal. In addition, given that 99% of the UK
population is registered with a family physician and 5% of
the UK population is captured in THIN, it is not likely that
patients with psoriasis selected into our study would differ
from other patients with psoriasis in the UK regarding their
risk of developing MDD and PsA.
The design used in this study allowed us to study a large
number of patients to identify cases of PsA among patients
with psoriasis—a relatively infrequent outcome. As a result,
MDD was identified as a risk factor for PsA development.
However, a limitation of this design is that we are unable to
consider all possible confounding or mediating variables and
thus are unable to develop a causal model for why MDD
increases the risk of PsA. Future research is needed to identify
potential mechanisms by which MDD increases the risk of
PsA, and may include factors such as inflammation, lifestyle,
or therapies associated with MDD.
Lastly, although our analysis assessed MDD as a risk factor
for PsA among patients with psoriasis, it is possible that this
association may be explained in part by mediating effects,
which were not assessed directly in this study. Similarly,
serum markers of systemic inflammation were not evaluated
in this study.
Conclusions
We utilized a large, nationally representative medical records
database with up to 25 years of follow-up to identify that
MDD significantly increased the risk of developing PsA
among patients with psoriasis. Consequently, heightened
attention for preventing and managing MDD in patients with
psoriasis may be warranted. Future research is necessary to
elucidate the possible mechanisms by which MDD contrib-
utes to the increased risk of PsA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source, setting, and study design
THIN was used as a data source. THIN is an electronic database that
contains general practice medical records from more than 12 million
individuals in the UK. In the UK, 99% of individuals are registered
with a general practice physician, and THIN represents approxi-
mately 5% of the UK population. When a patient joins a THIN-
registered practice, this date serves as their start date in THIN. Any
medical history before joining THIN is not available; however, if an
individual has a chronic disease, codes for these diseases are ex-
pected to appear after joining in THIN. In the UK, all specialist re-
ferrals originate from patients’ general practice physician, and data
from specialists’ offices and hospitals are returned to the general
practice for recording in THIN. Thus once in THIN, the patient’s full
medical history is documented from the date of joining the practice,
until death or transfer out of practice. Patients registered in THIN
have similar age and sex distributions to the general UK population
(Wallace et al., 1998). Therefore, THIN is a large, representative
database with longitudinal follow-up and detailed medical history.
Data for this study were collected prospectively from the year 1987
to 15 May 2012, representing up to 25 years of follow-up. THIN has
been used previously for the study of psoriasis (Chiesa Fuxench
et al., 2016; Gelfand et al., 2006; Yeung et al., 2013), PsA
(Dubreuil et al., 2014; Ogdie et al., 2015), and MDD (Kurd et al.,
2010; Meier et al., 2004; Rait et al., 2009).
Study population and sample size
THIN was used to identify adults aged 20e90 years with new-onset
(incident) psoriasis. Psoriasis was defined by the presence of any one
of the Read codes for psoriasis validated previously (Seminara et al.,
2011). Read codes are the standard clinical codes used in UK gen-
eral practice, based on International Classifications of Disease (ICD)
codes. The approach by Seminara et al. (2011) demonstrated a 90%
positive predictive value for psoriasis when validated against a
general practice physician’s clinical assessment. To be included in
the study, the patient must have been enrolled in THIN for at least 1
year without a psoriasis code to ensure that cases of psoriasis were
incident. This has been done previously when defining incident
psoriasis in THIN (Dubreuil et al., 2014). By using a 1-year washout
for inclusion in our study, prevalent cases of psoriasis who could
have been treated before joining a THIN practice were excluded. In
addition, any patients with diagnoses of MDD or PsA before psori-
asis diagnosis were excluded. Together, these factors contribute to
clear discernment of the temporal sequencing of events in the

 population data. Follow-up time began at first service date with a
psoriasis code (after the patient’s practice reached acceptable mor-
tality reporting). Any patients meeting these criteria were included in
the study, yielding 73,447 individuals with psoriasis.
Outcome
The primary outcome was the development of PsA. Censoring occurred
when the patient died, transferred out of the practice, or reached the
end of the study period. The time of outcome was defined as the first
date on which either the outcome of PsA was observed or the patient
became censored. The development of PsA was defined by the pres-
ence of any one of the PsA Read codes previously validated (Ogdie
et al., 2014). This method demonstrated an 85% positive predictive
value for PsA when validated against a physician’s clinical assessment
(Ogdie et al., 2014), thus contributing to a low risk of misclassification
bias of PsA. Although exclusion of cases with Read codes for rheu-
matoid arthritis or osteoarthritis was considered, previous PsA valida-
tion research in THIN (Ogdie etal., 2014) has shown thatthiswould not
enhance our positive predictive value for selecting true cases of PsA,
and so the recommended and validated approach of utilizing a single
PsA code without any further exclusions was performed. Because
diagnosis of PsA was based on the presence or absence of a PsA Read
code, there were no missing data for this outcome. As this study aimed
to estimate the risk of developing PsA among those with psoriasis, any
cases of PsA preceding the psoriasis diagnosis were excluded.
Exposure
The exposure in this study was the development of MDD. This
exposure was defined by the presence of any one of the MDD Read
codes selected based on expert consensus from psychiatrists and
represents a definition of a depressive disorder, not just a limited
number of depression symptoms. The date of exposure was taken as
the date on which one of these Read codes first appeared on the
patient’s record. Patients with codes for bipolar disorder, mania, or
hypomania were excluded. This case definition of MDD is likely
more specific than previously used definitions in patients with pso-
riasis in THIN (Kurd et al., 2010). Because diagnosis of MDD was
based on the presence or absence of a MDD Read code, there were
no missing data for the exposure. Any cases of MDD preceding the
psoriasis diagnosis or occurring after a diagnosis of PsA were
excluded. MDD was treated as a time-dependent exposure whereby
the observation time was partitioned into unexposed time (between
the psoriasis diagnosis and the diagnosis of MDD) and exposed time
(from the MDD diagnosis until the outcome occurred or the end of
the study period). This was done to minimize the threat of survival
bias that could result from patients having to survive or be free of PsA
by definition until at least the MDD diagnosis in the exposed group,
but not in the unexposed group who did not develop MDD (Zhou
et al., 2005). Once exposed to MDD, there was no mechanism to
revert a patient back to the unexposed group, and thus our analysis
accounts for ever having a diagnosis of MDD and not just a current
episode of major depression. This is consistent with the diagnostic
definition
of
MDD,
as
contained
in
the
DSM-5
(American
Psychiatric Association, 2013), in which the diagnosis of MDD is
characterized by one or more episodes of major depression—the
diagnosis of MDD remains when patients’ episodes remit. For pa-
tients who died or transferred out of practice before MDD or PsA
development, this data was considered in our analysis as either
exposed time (if MDD was present) or unexposed time (if no MDD).
Variables
Age was taken as the age at the time of psoriasis diagnosis. The
sample demonstrated a bimodal age distribution at psoriasis diag-
nosis (Supplementary Figure S1 online). Based on this, the trough
between the two modes can be seen at approximately 45 years of
age. Therefore, age was stratified based on age < 45, or age � 45,
representing early versus late onset psoriasis.
Sex was taken as the biological sex at the time of psoriasis diag-
nosis and stratified as male or female.
Obesity status was based on body mass and height records in
closest proximity to the date of psoriasis diagnosis, from which body
mass index was calculated and stratified on the World Health Or-
ganization definition of whether obesity was present (body mass
index � 30 kg/m2), absent (body mass index < 30 kg/m2), or missing.
Smoking status was based on records in closest proximity to
psoriasis diagnosis and stratified based on current smoker, ex-
smoker, never smoker, or missing.
Alcohol use was based on records in closest proximity to psoriasis
diagnosis and stratified based on user (any amount), nonuser (none),
or missing.
The Charlson comorbidity index, a validated index of a patient’s
relative burden of disease based on Read codes (Khan et al., 2010),
and used previously in psoriasis (Yeung et al., 2013), was determined
from available Read codes within 3 years of the index date (St
Germaine-Smith et al., 2011).
The Townsend deprivation index, a validated index on socio-
economic status from geographical location (Townsend et al., 1986),
was based on the participant’s postal address closest to the index
date.
The presence of mild versus moderate-severe psoriasis was
defined from medication usage—an approach that has been used in
other psoriasis THIN studies (Gelfand et al., 2006; Kurd et al., 2010).
Specifically, individuals were considered to have moderate-severe
psoriasis if they had a drug code for any of the following therapies
between the time of psoriasis diagnosis and study censoring date:
acitretin, azathioprine, cyclosporine, etretinate, hydroxycarbamide,
methotrexate, mycophenolic acid, and phototherapy with or without
psoralen. Given that each of these medications may alter systemic
inflammation, the psoriasis severity variable also accounted for
medication use that could affect the development of PsA. Patients
without codes for any of the above therapies were classified as mild
psoriasis. Because severity was based on the presence or absence of
codes, there were no missing data for this covariate.
All covariates, except psoriasis severity, were determined in as
close proximity to the index date of psoriasis diagnosis as possible.
Thus, the characteristics of the study population may be taken as the
presenting features of the patients in clinical practice.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using STATA/MP v13.1 with a two-tailed
significance level of 0.05. Chi-square tests were used to compare
baseline data between patients with psoriasis who developed MDD
and patients with psoriasis who did not develop MDD. Kaplan-Meier
failure curves were generated to display the development of PsA over
the full follow-up time. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
evaluate the risk of developing PsA among patients with psoriasis who
had MDD, expressed as a HR with corresponding 95% CIs. We
included all interaction terms in the initial model and evaluated for
possible effect modification by means of an omnibus likelihood ratio
test that compared this model with a model without interactions. As no

 interactions were found to be significant, we then developed a fully
adjusted model that controlled for age, sex, obesity status, smoking
status, alcohol use, Charlson comorbidity index, Townsend depriva-
tion index, and psoriasis severity as covariates and used a backward
elimination procedure to assess each covariate for possible con-
founding effects. From this, a more parsimonious model was generated
that only included covariates that induced a large (i.e., >10%) change
to the resulting HR when removed from the model. Ultimately, alcohol
use was the only covariate identified as inducing a change of this
magnitude. An unadjusted model was also explored. The proportional
hazards assumption was evaluated by testing the Schoenfeld residuals.
Sensitivity analyses evaluated whether the 1-year washout period
used to define incident cases of psoriasis differed from results that
utilized a 2- or 5-year washout period for defining incident cases. In
addition, the definition of moderate-severe psoriasis was altered as a
sensitivity analysis to include a broader list of therapies developed
based on UK NICE guidelines for psoriasis and PsA, and also based
on expert consensus from a dermatologist and rheumatologist. This
expanded list included adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, dapsone,
dexamethasone, efalizumab, etanercept, gold, golimumab, hydro-
cortisone, hydroxycarbamide, infliximab, leflunomide, predniso-
lone,
prednisone,
sulfasalazine,
thalidomide,
ustekinumab
in
addition to the therapies described previously. Steroids were only
considered if they were taken orally, intramuscularly, or intrave-
nously. These therapies were used in sensitivity analyses as opposed
to the primary analysis as it was anticipated that recording of these
highly specialized therapies may not be as well recorded in THIN
(Ogdie et al., 2014).
