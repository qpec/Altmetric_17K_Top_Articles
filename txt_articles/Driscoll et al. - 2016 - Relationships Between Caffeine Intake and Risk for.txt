Abstract
Background: Nonhuman studies suggest a protective effect of caffeine on cognition. Although human literature remains less consistent, 
reviews suggest a possible favorable relationship between caffeine consumption and cognitive impairment or dementia. We investigated the 
relationship between caffeine intake and incidence of cognitive impairment or probable dementia in women aged 65 and older from the 
Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study.
Methods: All women with self-reported caffeine consumption at enrollment were included (N = 6,467). In 10 years or less of follow-up 
with annual assessments of cognitive function, 388 of these women received a diagnosis of probable dementia based on a 4-phase protocol 
that included central adjudication. We used proportional hazards regression to assess differences in the distributions of times until incidence 
of probable dementia or composite cognitive impairment among women grouped by baseline level of caffeine intake, adjusting for risk 
factors (hormone therapy, age, race, education, body mass index, sleep quality, depression, hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
smoking, and alcohol consumption).
Results: Women consuming above median levels (mean intake = 261 
mg) of caffeine intake for this group were less likely to develop incident 
dementia (hazard ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [0.56, 0.99], p = .04) or any cognitive impairment (hazard ratio = 0.74, confidence 
interval [0.60, 0.91], p = .005) compared to those consuming below median amounts (mean intake = 64 
mg) of caffeine for this group.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest lower odds of probable dementia or cognitive impairment in older women whose caffeine consumption 
was above median for this group and are consistent with the existing literature showing an inverse association between caffeine intake and 
age-related cognitive impairment.
Key Words: Dementia—Aging—Hormone therapy—Cognitive impairment—Cognitive function
Mounting evidence from nonhuman animal studies suggests a pro-
tective effect of caffeine (1–3) and other bioactive components of 
coffee (4) on cognition. In vitro and preclinical studies underscore 
some mechanisms by which caffeine may exert protective effects 
against cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (2,5). 
AD, an age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most com-
mon cause of dementia, is characterized by a progressive cogni-
tive impairment, memory loss being a hallmark, and represents the 
culmination of neuropathological changes (amyloid-β plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles deposition) thought to evolve over several

 decades (6). Moreover, in animal models, caffeine seems to have a 
positive effect not only on behavior but also on certain aspects of 
AD-related neuropathology, such as beta-amyloid levels (1,7,8).
The potential protective effect of caffeine is thought to occur 
primarily through the blockade of adenosine A2A receptors (ARs), 
whose expression and function become aberrant with both normal 
aging and age-related pathology (9). Adenosine acts by facilitating 
A2A and acting on the inhibitory A1 receptors to integrate dopa-
mine, glutamate, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling, 
thereby modulating synaptic plasticity in regions relevant to learning 
and memory and providing the molecular and cellular bases for AR 
role in modulating cognition (10). Furthermore, ARs are increasingly 
recognized as potential targets for reversing cognitive impairment 
within the context of both normal and pathological aging, and there 
is support for AR activity-related reversal of cognitive impairment in 
animal models of AD, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and 
schizophrenia (11).
Lastly, epidemiological studies, although less consistent (12–16), 
generally report an inverse association of caffeine intake with age-
related cognitive impairment and AD (13,17,18). Moreover, it has 
been reported that baseline plasma caffeine levels are lower by 50% 
in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progressed 
to dementia 2–4 years later compared to those who remained stable 
(19). It is well known that age increases the risk of developing AD. 
With mean population age rising steadily and some predictions indi-
cating that the AD prevalence will quadruple by 2050 (20), there is 
an alarming need for effective treatments that prevent, delay or slow 
the disease that is already the sixth leading cause of death in the 
developed world (21).
We investigated the relationship between caffeine intake and 
overall incidence of probable dementia (PD) or global cognitive 
impairment in postmenopausal women aged 65 and older from the 
Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a randomized 
controlled clinical trial of postmenopausal hormone therapy (22). 
WHIMS offers an unprecedented opportunity to examine these rela-
tionships in a large and well-defined, prospectively studied cohort of 
women who were free of dementia at baseline. Our aim is to char-
acterize the relationship between caffeine consumption and the inci-
dence of PD or global cognitive impairment.
Methods
Participants
All women who provided self-reported caffeine data within 6 months 
of WHIMS enrollment, nested within the Women’s Health Initiative 
(WHI) randomized clinical trial of hormone therapy, and had at least 
one follow-up cognitive assessment (N = 6,467 of 7,497 enrolled in 
WHIMS) (22), were included. WHIMS examined the relative effect 
of 0.625 
mg/d conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone and in com-
bination with 2.5 
mg/d medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE + MPA) 
on the incidence of global cognitive decline and PD (23). Participants 
were randomly assigned, through the WHI hormone trials, with equal 
probability to active therapy (CEE if prior hysterectomy; CEE + 
MPA if no prior hysterectomy) or matching placebo. WHIMS enroll-
ment spanned 1995–1999. Through 2007, global cognitive function 
was assessed annually by centrally trained, masked, and certified 
technicians and interviewers using the 100-point Modified Mini 
Mental State (3MS) exam (24). Subsequently, during the Women’s 
Health Initiative Memory Study of the Epidemiology of Cognitive 
Health Outcomes (WHIMS-ECHO), annual assessment was based 
on the 40-point Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified 
(TICSm) (25,26). All participants provided written informed con-
sent. Studies were approved by the National Institutes of Health and 
the Institutional Review Boards of participating institutions.
The WHIMS clinical trial design, eligibility criteria, recruitment 
procedures, and a detailed description of the protocol for detect-
ing PD and MCI have been published (22). The central adjudication 
committee consists of three board-certified specialists (two neurol-
ogists and one geriatric psychiatrist) with extensive experience in 
dementia, who reviewed medical records to inform the diagnosis. All 
cases judged as PD by the local physician specialists were indepen-
dently reviewed by the central adjudicators, as well as 50% of MCI 
cases and 10% of cases without dementia. In WHIMS-ECHO, when 
women screened positive for cognitive impairment (TICSm < 31), a 
reliable and preidentified informant was interviewed by telephone 
using the validated Dementia Questionnaire (27) to assesses the his-
tory of cognitive and behavioral changes, functional impairments, 
and health events that can affect cognitive functioning (eg, stroke). 
If MCI case progressed to PD, PD was used as the outcome for that 
patient.
Caffeine intake was based on self-report at baseline using the 
Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (28). Caffeine intake was 
estimated from FFQ questions about coffee, tea, and cola beverage 
intake, including frequency and serving size. The FFQ does not have 
separate questions about caffeinated and decaffeinated beverages; 
hence, it was assumed that all intake was of caffeinated forms of these 
beverages. Personal Habits Questionnaire queried specifically about 
drinking caffeinated coffee each day. Those who reported drinking 
coffee each day were asked “How many cups of regular (non-decaf) 
coffee do you usually drink each day?” (if none, mark “None”; 
potential answers: None, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 or more). Potential 
confounders (eg, age, education, body mass index, hypertension, and 
prior cardiovascular disease) were collected at WHI enrollment via 
self-report and standardized assessments at WHI enrollment (23). 
The caffeine intake for the main analyses purposes was based on the 
FFQ, and only related to the cups of coffee obtained via Personal 
Habits Questionnaire as we could not otherwise discern the source 
caffeine in our sample as the FFQ does not have separate questions 
about caffeinated and decaffeinated beverages, hence it was pre-
sumed that all intake was of caffeinated forms of these beverages.
Statistical Analyses
Participants were grouped according to self-reported caffeine intake 
at baseline to examine differences among groups with respect to risk 
factors for PD and baseline global cognitive impairment (3MS) in 
WHIMS. We examined relationships that baseline caffeine intake 
(grouped into quartiles) had with risk factors for PD alone or in 
combination with MCI (composite cognitive impairment) or global 
cognitive performance (3MS) using analysis of variance and chi-
square tests. Composite cognitive impairment (MCI + PD) has been 
historically reported in previously published WHIMS manuscripts, 
given that originally the MCIs were a few, and hence were grouped 
together with PD as a cognitively impaired; we include it here for 
comparison purposes.
We used proportional hazards regression to assess differences in 
the distributions of times until incidence of PD or composite cog-
nitive impairment among women grouped by baseline level of caf-
feine intake. Follow-up was censored at the last cognitive assessment 
or 10-year postrandomization. General linear models were used to 
examine relationships that caffeine intake has with global cognitive 
function over time based on 3MS scores or PD. All models included 
hormone therapy assignment, age, race/ethnicity, and education

 as covariates. Additional models adjusted for risk factors that are 
related to caffeine intake (body mass index, sleep quality, depres-
sive symptoms, hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, and 3MS scores at baseline).

 women had either some college education or a college degree; fewer 
than 8% had not completed high school. Most women had no prior 
history of cardiovascular disease (89%) or diabetes (92%). About 
5% of the women were still working and the distribution of women 
currently working was similar across caffeine intake. The distribution 
of self-reported daily caffeine intake (mg/d) at baseline is presented 
in Figure 1; mean (SD) self-reported daily caffeine intake at baseline 
in this sample of women with follow-up cognitive data in WHIMS 
was 172 (134) mg/d. To help provide perspective, an 8-ounce cup of 
brewed coffee contains 95 
mg of caffeine, 8-ounces of brewed black 
tea contains 47 
mg and a 12-ounce can of carbonated cola contains 
33 
mg. Across 10 years of follow-up, caffeine intake was queried two 
additional times. The Spearman correlation of self-reported intake 
over time ranged from .60 to .63.
Of the women included in this study during their initial 10 years 
of follow-up, 209 women received a classification of PD and 388 
received a classification of any impairment (composite cognitive 
impairment = MCI + PD) based on a standard four-phase protocol 
that included central adjudication.
Mean (SD) follow-up times for surveillance for cognitive impair-
ment (ie, until an event or censoring) were slightly longer for women 
consuming above the median caffeine intake at baseline compared to 
others: 7.2 (2.3) versus 6.9 (2.5) years. In our sample, greater levels of 
caffeine intake at baseline were associated with a reduced incidence of 
both PD (Figure 2a) and composite cognitive impairment (Figure 2b). 
Those women consuming above median levels of caffeine intake for 
this group were less likely to develop incident PD (adjusted hazard 
ratio [HR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.56, 0.99], p = .04) 
or composite cognitive impairment (adjusted HR = 0.74, 95% CI 
[0.60, 0.91], p = 0.005) compared to those women consuming below 
median amounts of caffeine (Table 2). Similarly, women consuming 
more caffeine had higher levels of global cognitive functioning as 
indexed by higher 3MS scores both with and without full covariate 
adjustment (p < 0.001; Table 3) compared to women who consumed 
below median amounts of caffeine for this group (Figure 3), and covar-
iate adjustment for baseline 3MS dampened the association between 
caffeine intake and incidence of cognitive impairment (adjusted HR 
[PD alone] = 0.80, 95% CI [0.60, 1.06], p = 0.12; adjusted HR [PD + 
MCI composite] = 0.81, 95% CI [0.65, 1.00], p = 0.05).
There was a significant relationship between dietary caffeine and 
cups of caffeinated coffee consumed per day in this sample (r = .44, 
p < .0001). Furthermore, the results of proportional hazards regres-
sions with full covariate adjustments that examined the relationships 
between dietary caffeine and both composite cognitive impairment 
(HR = 0.68, 95% CI [0.53, 0.88], p = 0.003) or PD (HR = 0.64, 95% 
CI [0.46, 0.90], p = 0.01) remained significant even after adjusting 
for cups of caffeinated coffee per day.
Discussion
Above median (for this group) baseline caffeine intake level 
(mean intake for the upper 50% = 261 
mg; mean intake for lower 
50% = 64 
mg) is associated with lower incidence of both PD and 
global cognitive impairment in this sample of generally healthy, com-
munity-dwelling, postmenopausal women. Covariate adjustment for 
baseline 3MS dampened the association between caffeine intake and 
incident global cognitive impairment, suggesting that the examined 
associations may be partly mediated by the baseline level of cogni-
tive functioning. This is not entirely surprising for the WHI sample, 
given the initial reports whereby generally adverse effects of hor-
mone therapy on cognition were exacerbated in women with lower 
baseline cognitive function (29).
Our findings suggesting lower risk of PD incidence in women 
with higher caffeine consumption are generally consistent with the 
literature. Although we cannot generalize to men, our findings are in 
agreement with Ritchie and colleagues (17), who reported a protec-
tive relationship between caffeine and cognition in women, but not 
men. A study of European men did report, however, that the men 
who consumed three cups of coffee per day had the lowest cogni-
tive decline over a 10-year period (30). Our study is also in general

 agreement with the literature review, which reports a modest reduc-
tion in rates of cognitive decline across six studies over a follow-up 
ranging from 1.3 to 10 years (31).
This study comes with some inherent limitations that may limit 
generalizability. The sample is not population-based, is relatively 
highly educated and some biases may have arisen due to differen-
tial survivorship. All participants are older, postmenopausal, and 
female. The limitations, however, should not undermine the many 
unique aspects of the study, including the large number of exten-
sively screened and characterized community-dwelling, older women 
through detailed prospective follow-up and relatively short intervals 
between assessments. As is the case with most studies to date report-
ing lower incidence of cognitive impairment in caffeine consumers, 
we are also unable to show clear dose response with cups of caf-
feinated coffee per day. Still, it is likely that caffeine consumption 
is underestimated as we are not able to discern potential dietary 
sources of caffeine other than coffee or tea and the FFQ does not 
have separate questions about caffeinated and decaffeinated bever-
ages; hence, it was assumed that all intake was of caffeinated forms 
of these beverages. Furthermore, the source of caffeine may be an 
important consideration for future research. Nonetheless, dietary 
caffeine was significantly correlated with cups of caffeinated coffee 
in our sample. Further research is needed in order to assess or con-
firm the exposure through more objective, biological assays com-
pared to self-reported caffeine intake, and also to isolate potential 
acute effects that caffeine may have on cognitive performance.
The mounting evidence of caffeine consumption as a potential 
protective factor against cognitive impairment is exciting given that 
caffeine is also an easily modifiable dietary factor with very few 
contraindications. The literature suggests several possible mecha-
nisms that may provide clues to the causal pathways. At normal 
daily consumption range per person, which is 2–4 cups of coffee 
(2.4–4.0 
mg/kg) (32), the primary action of caffeine is that of a non-
selective adenosine receptor antagonist (see a review by Rosso and 
colleagues (33)). The physiologic role for adenosine and its receptors 
have been widely studied in recent years and implicated in a range

 of neurological properties, including regulation of sleep, anxiety, 
memory, and cognitive performance (34). Further research is needed 
in order to determine whether coffee consumption may have a major 
effect on the incidence of dementia and age-related cognitive impair-
ment in general, as well as the mechanisms that may lend them-
selves to new preventative strategies and pharmacologic avenues 
of research. There is a convergence of molecular studies revealing 
ARs as molecular targets for integrating neurotransmitter signaling 
and controlling synaptic plasticity. Studies of cognition under nor-
mal and pathological aging will stimulate the necessary translational 
investigations of adenosine and AR antagonists, such as caffeine, as 
novel strategies to modulate cognitive impairments.
We report a lower risk of PD or global cognitive impairment 
incidence in women with higher caffeine consumption, which are 
generally consistent with the literature. Although more studies are 
needed to verify the consistency of reports (35), given that caffeine 
intake is easily modifiable, it is important to quantify its relation-
ship with cognitive health outcomes not only from preventative 
stand point but also to better understand the underlying mecha-
nisms and their involvement in dementia and cognitive impair-
ment. Given that AD prevalence is expected to quadruple by 2050 
(10), even a small reduction in age-related cognitive impairment 
or dementia burden would thereby have significant public health 
implications.
