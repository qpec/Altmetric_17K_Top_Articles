Abstract
Objective: The preventable proportion of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) may decrease over time as standards of care improve. We
aimed to assess the proportion of HAIs prevented by multifaceted infection control interventions in different economic settings.
Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched OVID Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, and The Cochrane
Library for studies published between 2005 and 2016 assessing multifaceted interventions to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract
infections (CAUTIs), central-line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), ventilator-associated
pneumonia (VAP), and hospital-acquired pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation (HAP) in acute-care or long-term care
settings. For studies reporting raw rates, we extracted data and calculated the natural log of the risk ratio and variance to obtain pooled risk
ratio estimates.
Results: Of the 5,226 articles identified by our search, 144 studies were included in the final analysis. Pooled incidence rate ratios associated
with multifaceted interventions were 0.543 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.445–0.662) for CAUTI, 0.459 (95% CI, 0.381–0.554) for
CLABSI, and 0.553 (95% CI, 0.465–0.657) for VAP. The pooled rate ratio was 0.461 (95% CI, 0.389–0.546) for interventions aiming at SSI
reduction, and for VAP reduction initiatives, the pooled rate ratios were 0.611 (95% CI, 0.414–0.900) for before-and-after studies and 0.509
(95% CI, 0.277–0.937) for randomized controlled trials. Reductions in infection rates were independent of the economic status of the study
country. The risk of bias was high in 143 of 144 studies (99.3%).
Conclusions: Published evidence suggests a sustained potential for the significant reduction of HAI rates in the range of 35%–55%
associated with multifaceted interventions irrespective of a country’s income level.

Few studies have estimated the number of infections prevented or
lives saved if hospitals applied best practices in infection preven-
tion and control (IPC). More than 30 years ago, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s Study on the Efficacy of Noso-
comial Infection Control (SENIC) project made such an estimate.1
The authors concluded that 30%–35% of most healthcare-
associated infections (HAIs) were preventable with effective
surveillance and control programs. Numerous studies have since
examined interventions to reduce the most common HAIs: cen-
tral-line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-
associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), ventilator-associated
pneumonia (VAP) and surgical site infection (SSI). Harbarth
et al 2 performed a systematic literature review to describe
multimodal intervention studies to give a crude estimate of the
proportion of potentially preventable nosocomial infections
almost 20 years later, in 2004. They concluded that great
potential existed to decrease nosocomial infection rates, from a
minimum reduction effect of 10% to a maximum effect of 70%,
depending on the setting, study design, baseline infection rates,
and type of infection. In 2011, a review by Umscheid et al 3
confirmed that as many as 65%–70% of cases of CLABSI and
CAUTI and 55% of cases of VAP and SSI might be preventable
with current evidence-based strategies, with CLABSI having the
highest number of preventable deaths and the highest cost
impact. Irrespective of these consistent numbers on reported
preventable proportions of infections in the past, the effect of
interventions that aim to further reduce HAIs may diminish
over time as quality initiatives and infection control programs
improve, especially in higher income settings—a phenomenon
known as the law of diminishing returns.
We therefore aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-
analysis on the proportion of preventable HAIs among the adult
patient population in different economic settings based on the
literature published in 2005–2016.

 Methods
Data sources and searches
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we performed an
electronic search of OVID Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL (The
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature),
PubMed, and The Cochrane Library for articles published
between January 1, 2005, and October 7, 2016, based on a pre-
viously defined protocol. The search strategy was developed with
the help of an experienced librarian with expertise in literature
searches for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. For the
detailed search strategy, see Supplemental Table S1.
Study selection
We included all quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case-
control studies, and randomized controlled trials evaluating
multifaceted interventions to reduce CAUTIs, CLABSIs, SSIs,
VAP, and hospital-acquired pneumonia in nonventilated patients
(HAP) in acute-care or long-term care settings that reported
infection rates as an outcome. Interventions were considered
multifaceted if 2 or more interventions (eg, education AND
surveillance, preoperative skin decolonization AND changes in
the preoperative skin disinfection protocol) with the aim of
reducing HAIs were performed. Surveillance of HAIs or audits
were only considered interventions if these measures were com-
bined with feedback. There was no restriction by study site,
country, or follow-up period. Only studies published in English
were considered eligible. Studies were excluded if they were cases
series, case reports, outbreak reports, or ecological studies; if they
included patients <16 years of age; or if they investigated only 1
specific intervention measure.
Two authors (P.W.S. and S.P.K.) screened the title and abstract
of each reference identified by the search and applied the inclusion
criteria. For possibly relevant articles, the full-text article was
reviewed independently by the 2 authors. Final inclusion of studies
was determined by agreement of both reviewers and involvement
of a third author (H.S.) in cases of discrepancy. After in-depth
discussion of the different opinions, the authors agreed unan-
imously on the final classification and inclusion of all studies.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two authors (P.W.S. and S.P.K.) independently extracted data
from published reports. In the case of missing data, no attempts
were made to contact study authors, and these articles were
subsequently excluded. Data extraction was performed using a
standardized data collection form. The reviewers extracted data
on study design, population and setting, interventions tested, and
outcome measurement. Countries were classified by economic
income group according to the World Bank list of economies
(March 2017 version).4 The primary outcome measure was the
proportion of infected patients or the infection rate. Data were
extracted as proportions if results were only reported as prob-
ability of events or as rates per number of device days. If rates
were not reported per number of device days but were only
reported per number of patient days, the latter was extracted.
To assess methodological quality and risk of bias in rando-
mized controlled studies and controlled before-and-after studies,
included articles were examined for (1) generation of allocation
sequence, (2) concealment of allocation, (3) similarity of baseline
outcome measurement, (4) similarity of baseline characteristics,
(5) addressing incomplete outcome data, (6) prevention of
knowledge of allocated interventions, (7) protection against
contamination, (8) freedom of selective outcome reporting, and
(9) freedom from other risks of bias.5,6 For interrupted time-series
analyses, we assessed (1) independency of other changes, (2)
prespecification of the shape of the intervention effect, (3) like-
lihood of affection of data collection by the intervention,
(4) appropriate analysis, (5) prevention of knowledge of the
allocated intervention during the study, (6) addressing incomplete
outcome data, (7) freedom of selective outcome reporting, and (8)
freedom from other risk of bias.5,6 Because uncontrolled before-
and-after studies are generally considered low quality, no further
quality assessment was performed for this type of study.5
Data synthesis and analysis
For studies reporting only aggregated data without the possibility
to calculate raw numbers, no data synthesis was performed. For
studies reporting raw rates, we calculated the natural log of the
risk ratio and variance to meta-analyze the extracted data and to
obtain pooled risk ratio estimates. Data synthesis was performed
using STATA version 11.1 software (StataCorp, College Station,
TX). Because heterogeneity was anticipated between studies,
random effects models using the method of DerSimonian and
Laird, with the estimate of heterogeneity being taken from the
inverse-variance fixed-effect model (for meta-analysis of rates) or
the Mantel-Haenszel model (for meta-analysis of proportions)
were used for all analyses to obtain a summary estimate (inci-
dence rate ratio [IRR] or rate ratio [RR], as appropriate) of the
average effect with its 95% confidence interval (CI). A continuity
correction of 0.5 to the counts from both groups of the study were
added where a study contained a zero count in either the control
group or the intervention group.5,7
Statistical heterogeneity was initially inspected graphically in a
forest plot. We quantified the degree of heterogeneity using the
I 2 statistic and defined heterogeneitiy a priori as I 2 > 60%. Sub-
group analyses for differences between country economic income
categories were performed using fixed-effect models if criteria for
heterogeneity were not met. P values <.05 were considered sta-
tistically significant.
Publication bias was investigated using a funnel plot in which
the standard error of the effect estimate of each study was plotted
against the estimate and was quantified using the Egger test.
Results
Study selection
The review process is summarized in Figure 1. Of the 5,226 articles
retrieved with our search strategy, 208 were retained for full-text
review, and 144 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included
in the systematic review and meta-analysis.8–152 Included studies are
described in Table 1. There were 138 quasi-experimental studies
(95.8%): 1 controlled before-and-after study, 137 uncontrolled
before-and-after studies.8–15,17–44,46–49,51–59,61–120,122–133,135–140,142–152

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection
One cluster-randomized controlled trial reported an IRR of
0.644 (95% CI, 0.456–0.910) associated with a multifaceted
intervention to reduce CAUTI rates (Supplementary Fig. S1a).50
Data from 18 before-and-after studies were available for
meta-analysis.20,26,32,46,52,58,61,71,78,79,83,102,116,129,135,137,142,149
Compared to standard of care, multifaceted interventions were
associated with a pooled IRR of 0.543 (95% CI, 0.445–0.662),
with overall heterogeneity of I 2 = 78.9%. Significant reductions
in CAUTI incidence could be observed in all country economic
income groups, although differences between subgroups could
not be explored due to high heterogeneity (Fig. 2). The 7 studies
reporting aggregated data on CAUTI rates demonstrated
between

RR (95% CI) of the before-and-after studies was 0.611 (95% CI,
0.414–0.900). The 2 RCTs showed a pooled RR of 0.509 (95% CI,

 Healthcare-associated pneumonia
Only 2 uncontrolled before-and-after studies on HAP met the
inclusion criteria.90,146 One study showed an adjusted OR of 0.16
(95% CI, 0.01–0.94) associated with a multifaceted intervention
for prevention of postoperative pneumonia.90 Another study
reported a significant reduction of 43.6% of HAP rates, from
0.78% (preintervention) to 0.44% (postintervention).146
Study quality
The risk of bias in all but 1 of the included studies was high.
Uncontrolled before-and-after studies were a priori defined to be
at high risk of bias.8–15,17–44,46–49,51–59,61–120,122–133,135–140,142–152
All 5 randomized controlled trials and the controlled before-
and-after study were considered at high risk of bias because study
participants and study personnel were unblinded throughout
(Supplementary Table S6).43,50,60,120,134,141 Risk of bias was
unclear in the remaining 1 interrupted time-series analysis.45
Discussion
In our extensive systematic review of 5,226 screened and 144
included articles published over a 12-year period between 2005
and 2016, the pooled IRRs associated with multifaceted inter-
ventions for HAI reduction were 0.543 (95% CI, 0.435–0.662) for
CAUTI, 0.459 (95% CI, 0.381–0.554) for CLABSI, and 0.553 (95%
CI, 0.465–0.657) for VAP. The pooled RR was 0.461 (95% CI,
0.389–0.546) for interventions aiming at SSI reduction, and
for VAP interventions, the pooled RRs were 0.611 (95% CI,
0.414–0.900) for before-and-after studies and 0.509 (95% CI,
0.277–0.937) for randomized controlled trials. Relative reductions
of infection rates were independent of country economic income
status, indicating that quality improvement projects with multi-
faceted interventions may result in substantial reducions of
infection rates irrespective of the economic setting.
The proportion of HAIs that is preventable is still under
debate.3 Our observed ranges of reductions associated with the
implementation of multfaceted, evidence-based interventions are
in line with previous estimates.1–3 Our results confirmed the
findings by Harbarth et al2 that the largest effect was attributed to
interventions targeting CLABSI prevention. Interestingly, the
avoidable proportion of HAI does not seem to decrease over time
as would be predicted by the law of diminishing returns given the
increasingly widespread availability and expected implementation
of evidence-based practices for HAI reduction.153 However, for an
accurate comparison, these findings must be considered in the
context of changes in epidemiology over time. From 1997 to 2008,
an increase of the percentage of the elderly (≥65 years of age)
population from 12% to 37% was described in the United States,
and a similar increase of this elderly fraction in hospitalized
patients was reported.154 Increasing age is associated with a
higher rate of hospitalization.155 Furthermore, aging predisposes
to the development of chronic diseases, increasing the likelihood
of multimorbidity.156 Later studies likely included a larger frac-
tion of older and sicker patients—a vulnerable population prone
to HAIs and increased morbidity and mortality resulting from
HAIs. Therefore, it would seem that increasing implementation of
evidence-based best practies has been met with global trends of
aging and multimorbidity, which necessitate additional efforts to

 further reduce HAIs. Overall, the HAI target should likely be
considered an ever-moving group of individuals at risk who enter
and leave the healthcare system.
Our findings demonstrate that even in high income countries,
where high adherence to current recommendations may be
expected, there remains considerable room for improvment. The
persistance of a 30%–50% potential reduction in HAI with the
implementation of evidence-based strategies demonstrates that
current recommendations have not been sufficiently imple-
mented. Importantly, the quality of infection control measures
cannot be inferred on country economic classification alone.
However, due to the heterogeneity of studies included in our
dataset and lack of information on process indicators, we were
unable to determine whether the actual efforts to achieve a
reduction of HAI differed between studies from different
economies. Although many hospitals, particularly in high income
settings, may claim that they adhere to current evidence-based
standards, implementation science has demonstrated a large
discrepancy between the intention to effect change by employing
standard operating procedures and true implementation of such
practices into daily practice.157,158 On the other hand, our results
may also indicate that there is room for improvement after
implementation of basic infection control measures that reduce
HAI rates to levels that do not attract further attention.
Our systematic review and meta-analysis included multi-
faceted interventions only. Another highly interesting, and until
now unresolved, question concerns the individual contribution of
the single components of bundled interventions. Although not
addressed in the current study, more profound knowledge would
help guide bundle development by focusing on the most efficient
elements of these interventions.
The studies reviewed in this analysis only covered known
measures for IPC. The evolution of risk related to the acquisition
of HAIs in medicine, however, is unknown. On one hand, med-
ical innovations may reduce the risk of HAIs due to less invasive
techniques (eg, minimal invasive surgery or noninvasive ventila-
tion). On the other hand, novel technologies allowing interven-
tions on patient populations that were previously ineligible for
certain treatments due to impaired health status may be asso-
ciated with an increased risk of HAIs. Even factors that may be
perceived as unmodifiable today may be alterable in the future.
Therefore, continuous efforts in the field of IPC are needed to
keep up with medical progress. Such efforts must consider not
only extrinsic factors (including medical devices) but also
intrinsic factors (ie, host and microbes). In the future, IPC should
and will be integrated more intrinsically in all medical procedures.
In addition to the medical duty to prevent harm to patients,
recent literature further illustrates that infection prevention pro-
grams are cost-effective when factoring in the incremental costs of
HAIs to hospitals.3 This particularly applies to settings were
complications are not reimbursed or even associated with
penalizations.159,160
The fact that we observed publication bias for studies on
CAUTI and SSI and that risk of bias was high in 143 of 144
studies (99.3%) needs to be considered. An uncontrolled study
design with before-and-after assessment of the intervention effect
was used in most studies; thus, bias due to the influence of
unmeasured extraneous factors that change over time cannot be
excluded. Moreover, blinding was not performed in the 4 ran-
domized controlled trials that were included, which may also have
distorted the reported results. As in other fields of medicine,
smaller intervention trials with negative results may remain
unpublished.161 The HAIs addressed in this systematic review and
meta-analysis mainly consist of device-associated infections.
These infections, however, represent only a fraction of all HAIs.
Data about the preventable proportion of non–device-associated
infections are scarce; only 2 studies on HAP were included in our
study. Lastly, the clear majority of the included papers reported
on a single HAI or on only 1 type of SSI, which indicates that
even though the interventions are multifaceted, their focus is
nevertheless narrow. Additional, higher-quality data are clearly
required
to
guide
prevention
efforts
from
a
governance
perspective.
The preventable proportion of HAIs reported by this sys-
tematic literature review and meta-analysis of 35%–55% suggests
that there remains much to be desired in terms of implementation
of evidence-based best practices. Our study findings should
motivate healthcare institutions that aim to improve quality of
patient care and to reduce infection rates to develop their own
customized, multifaceted strategies to improve patient outcomes.
