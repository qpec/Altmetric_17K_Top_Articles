Abstract
Background: Severe trauma continues to represent a global public health issue and mortality and morbidity in
trauma patients remains substantial. A number of initiatives have aimed to provide guidance on the management
of trauma patients. This document focuses on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following
trauma and encourages adaptation of the guiding principles to each local situation and implementation within
each institution.
Methods: The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was founded in
2004 and included representatives of six relevant European professional societies. The group used a structured,
evidence-based consensus approach to address scientific queries that served as the basis for each recommendation
and supporting rationale. Expert opinion and current clinical practice were also considered, particularly in areas in
which randomised clinical trials have not or cannot be performed. Existing recommendations were reconsidered
and revised based on new scientific evidence and observed shifts in clinical practice; new recommendations were
formulated to reflect current clinical concerns and areas in which new research data have been generated. This
guideline represents the fourth edition of a document first published in 2007 and updated in 2010 and 2013.
Results: The guideline now recommends that patients be transferred directly to an appropriate trauma treatment
centre and encourages use of a restricted volume replacement strategy during initial resuscitation. Best-practice use
of blood products during further resuscitation continues to evolve and should be guided by a goal-directed
strategy. The identification and management of patients pre-treated with anticoagulant agents continues to pose a
real challenge, despite accumulating experience and awareness. The present guideline should be viewed as an
educational aid to improve and standardise the care of the bleeding trauma patients across Europe and beyond.
This document may also serve as a basis for local implementation. Furthermore, local quality and safety
management systems need to be established to specifically assess key measures of bleeding control and outcome.
Conclusions: A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidance are key to improving
patient outcomes. The implementation of locally adapted treatment algorithms should strive to achieve
measureable improvements in patient outcome.

 Background
Severe trauma is a major global public health issue.
Traumatic injury contributes to about one in ten mortal-
ities, resulting in the annual worldwide death of more
than 5.8 million people [1, 2], a number that is predicted
to increase to >8 million by 2020 [3]. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic accidents,
suicides and homicides are the three leading causes of in-
jury and violence-related deaths [4]. As a consequence,
there have been numerous national and international ini-
tiatives that aim to prevent violence and traumatic injuries
and to provide guidance on the treatment of trauma vic-
tims. Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding is the leading
cause of potentially preventable death among injured
patients [5, 6] and the bleeding trauma patient repre-
sents a significant financial burden for societies [7],
therefore improvements in the management of the
massively
bleeding
trauma
patient
via
educational
measures and state-of-the-art clinical practice guide-
lines should improve outcomes by assisting in the
timely identification of bleeding sources, followed by
prompt measures to minimise blood loss, restore tis-
sue perfusion and achieve haemodynamic stability.
Over the past decade the specific pathophysiology as-
sociated with bleeding following traumatic injury has
been increasingly recognised and management strategies
are evolving. Upon hospital admission about one-third
of all bleeding trauma patients already show signs of
coagulopathy [8–15] and a significant increase in the
occurrence of multiple organ failure and death compared
to patients with similar injury patterns in the absence of a
coagulopathy [8, 9, 11, 16, 17]. The early acute coagulopa-
thy associated with traumatic injury has recently been
recognised as a multifactorial primary condition that
results from a combination of bleeding-induced shock, tis-
sue
injury-related
thrombin-thrombomodulin-complex
generation and the activation of anticoagulant and fibrino-
lytic pathways (Fig. 1) [9–11, 14, 18–23]. The severity of
the coagulation disorder is influenced by environmental
and therapeutic factors that result in, or at least contribute
to, acidaemia, hypothermia, dilution, hypoperfusion and
coagulation factor consumption [9, 10, 18, 24–26].
Moreover, the coagulopathy is modified by trauma-
related factors such as brain injury and individual pa-
tient-related factors that include age, genetic background,
co-morbidities, inflammation and pre-medication, espe-
cially oral anticoagulants, and pre-hospital fluid ad-
ministration [26–28].
A number of terms have been proposed to describe
the specific trauma-associated coagulopathic physiology,
including Acute Traumatic Coagulopathy [10, 29], Early
Coagulopathy of Trauma [11], Acute Coagulopathy of
Trauma-Shock [18], Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy [30]
and Trauma-Associated Coagulopathy [31].
This European clinical practice guideline, originally
published in 2007 [32] and updated in 2010 [33] and
2013 [34], represents the fourth edition of the guideline
and is part of the European “STOP the Bleeding Cam-
paign”, an international initiative launched in 2013 to re-
duce morbidity and mortality associated with bleeding
following traumatic injury [35]. With this guideline we
aim to achieve a broader awareness of the pathophysiology
of the severely bleeding trauma patient and to provide
guidance for the clinician by including not only manage-
ment recommendations but also an overview of the most
relevant scientific publications, highlighting areas in which
further research is urgently required. We recognise the di-
vergence in international clinical practice in the initial
management of patients following traumatic injury, de-
pending on the availability of rapid point-of-care coagula-
tion testing to facilitate goal-directed therapy. Trauma
systems without rapid point-of-care testing tend to use
fixed ratio protocols during the phase of rapid bleeding, as
central laboratory coagulation results are available too late
to guide therapy.
Although this set of recommendations outlines corridors
for diagnosis and treatment, the author group believes that
the greatest outcome improvement can be achieved
through education and process adaptation by local clinical
management guidelines or algorithms, the use of checklists
and management bundles and participation in quality
management programmes that contribute to national or
international trauma databases. Therefore, this guideline
attempts to suggest clinically relevant pathways for diagno-
sis and therapy in order to facilitate adaptation of the guid-
ing principles to each local situation and implementation
within each institution. We believe that adherence to
local management guidelines or algorithms should be
assessed on a regular basis and will lead, if communicated
adequately, to greater adherence. If incorporated into local
practice, these clinical guidelines have the potential to en-
sure a uniform standard of care across Europe and be-
yond, and better outcomes for the severely bleeding
trauma patient.
Methods
The recommendations made in this guideline are graded
according to the Grading of Recommendations Assess-
ment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system
[36], summarised in Table 1. According to the GRADE
scheme, the number associated with each recommenda-
tion reflects the strength of the recommendation by the
author group, with “we recommend” (Grade 1) being
stronger and “we suggest” (Grade 2) being weaker, while
the letter reflects the quality of the scientific evidence.
Comprehensive, structured, computer-based literature
searches were performed using the indexed online data-
base MEDLINE/PubMed, supplemented by screening of

 reference lists within relevant publications. The aim of
each search strategy was to identify randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and systematic reviews
that addressed specific scientific queries. In the absence
of high-quality scientific support, case reports, observa-
tional studies and case control studies were also considered
and the literature support for each recommendation
graded accordingly.
Boolean
operators
and
medical
subject
headings
(MeSH) were applied to structure each literature search.
Appropriate MeSH terms were identified and adjusted if
needed to address the scientific queries formulated by
the authors. Limitations to the search results included
“humans” and “English language”. The time period
was limited to 3 years if the query was previously
considered in the 2013 guideline. For new queries,
the time period was not restricted or limited to 3 or
10 years depending on the number of abstracts identified
by each search. The questions addressed the correspond-
ing MeSH terms and the limitations applied to each
search are listed in Additional file 1. Abstracts identified
by each search strategy were screened by a subset of
authors and if considered relevant, full publications
were evaluated.
Selection of the scientific queries addressed screening
and evaluation of the literature, formulation of the rec-
ommendations and the supporting rationales was per-
formed by members of the Task Force for Advanced
Bleeding Care in Trauma, which was founded in 2004.
The Task Force comprises a multidisciplinary team of
pan-European experts representing the fields of emer-
gency medicine, surgery, anaesthesiology, haematology
and intensive care medicine. Among the authors are rep-
resentatives of the European Society for Trauma and
Emergency Surgery (ESTES), the European Society of
Anaesthesiology (ESA), the European Shock Society

The guideline update process involved several remote
(telephone or internet-based) meetings, extensive elec-
tronic communication and one face-to-face consensus
conference. In January 2015 the authors participated in a
web conference during which the queries to be ad-
dressed in the updated guideline were defined. Screening
and evaluation of abstracts and full publications identi-
fied by the structured searches and formulation of draft
recommendations and rationales was performed by
working subgroups. Each chapter was reviewed by a
separate working subgroup and then the entire author
group. The wording of each recommendation was
finalised during a face-to-face consensus conference
that took place in April 2015. After revisions and approval
by the author group, the manuscript was approved by
the endorsing societies between August 2015 and
January 2016. An update of this manuscript is anticipated
in due time.
Results
I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding
Minimal elapsed time
Recommendation 1 We recommend that severely in-
jured patients be transported directly to an appropriate
trauma facility. (Grade 1B)
We recommend that the time elapsed between
injury and bleeding control be minimised. (Grade 1A)
Rationale
Because relatively few hospitals provide all of the ser-
vices required to treat patients with multiple injuries,
many healthcare systems have developed trauma net-
works or systems. The underlying aims of trauma care
organisation is to move patients to a multi-specialist
care as early as possible, yet still provide immediate crit-
ical interventions. These aims can come into conflict,
and there are a number of different means with which to
resolve these issues, resulting in large variations in
trauma care systems both between and within countries
and a consequent significant heterogeneity in the litera-
ture. The evidence is weak, but there is a general con-
sensus that the organisation of a group of hospitals into

 a “trauma system” leads to about a 15 % reduction in
trauma death, with about a 50 % reduction in “prevent-
able death” [37–39]. Inter-hospital transfer of patients
does not seem to change overall mortality [40], and the
evidence neither supports nor refutes direct transport
from the accident scene to a major trauma centre [41].
However, there is some evidence that a lower threshold
for trauma centre care should be used in patients aged
>65 years [42]. No definitive conclusion can be drawn
about the relationship between a hospital’s trauma pa-
tient volume and outcomes [43]. Despite a lack of evi-
dence there is a consensus that “systemised” trauma
care that matches each patient to the most appropriate
treatment facility is advantageous, whereby the defin-
ition of “appropriate” will depend on the patient profile,
the nature of the injuries and the hospital facilities
available.
Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for on-
going haemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed
time between the traumatic injury and admission to the
operating theatre is minimised. More than 50 % of all
trauma patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 h of
injury [6]. Despite a lack of evidence from prospective
RCTs, well-designed retrospective studies provide evi-
dence for early surgical intervention in patients with
traumatic haemorrhagic shock [44–46]. In addition,
studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise
the importance of minimising the time between admis-
sion and surgical bleeding control in patients with trau-
matic haemorrhagic shock [47, 48]. Minimisation of
time to surgery is an accepted principle of trauma care
and is unlikely to ever be tested in a clinical trial due to
lack of equipoise.
Tourniquet use
Recommendation 2 We recommend adjunct tourni-
quet use to stop life-threatening bleeding from open ex-
tremity injuries in the pre-surgical setting. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
When uncontrolled arterial bleeding occurs from man-
gled extremity injuries, including penetrating or blast in-
juries or traumatic amputations, a tourniquet is a simple
and efficient method with which to acutely control
haemorrhage [49–53]. Tourniquet application has be-
come standard of care for the control of severe external
haemorrhage following military combat injuries, and
several publications report the effectiveness of tourni-
quets in this specific setting in adults [49–52, 54] and
children [55]. A study of volunteers showed that any
tourniquet device presently on the market works effi-
ciently [53]. The study also showed that “pressure point
control” was ineffective because collateral circulation
was observed within seconds. Tourniquet-induced pain
was not often reported by patients. No evidence or opin-
ion supports the use of tourniquets in the context of
closed injuries.
Tourniquets should be left in place until surgical
control of bleeding is achieved [50, 52]; however, this
time span should be kept as short as possible. Im-
proper or prolonged placement of a tourniquet can
lead to complications such as nerve paralysis and
limb ischaemia [56], however these effects are rare
[54]. Some publications suggest a maximum applica-
tion time of 2 h [56]. Reports from military settings
describe cases in which tourniquets have remained in
place for up to 6 h with survival of the extremity
[50].
Much discussion has been generated recently about
the translation of this evidence to civilian practice, as
there is little published evidence. Bleeding from most ci-
vilian wounds can be controlled by local pressure, how-
ever uncontrolled external bleeding from either blunt
[57] or penetrating [58] limb injury should be controlled
with a tourniquet.
Ventilation
Recommendation 3 We recommend the avoidance of
hypoxaemia. (Grade 1A)
We recommend normoventilation of trauma patients.
(Grade 1B)
We suggest hyperventilation in the presence of
signs of imminent cerebral herniation. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Tracheal intubation of severely injured patients is a
delicate decision that involves risks and requires
proper skill and training of the operator. The funda-
mental objective of intubation is to ensure adequate
ventilation, adequate oxygenation and to guarantee
the patency of the airway. There are well-defined situ-
ations in which intubation is mandatory, for example
airway obstruction, altered consciousness [Glasgow Coma
Score (GCS) ≤8], haemorrhagic shock, hypoventilation or
hypoxaemia [59]; however, other aspects should also be
considered. For example, the introduction of positive pres-
sure can induce potentially life-threatening hypotension in
hypovolaemic patients [60], and some authors have
reported
increased
mortality
associated
with
pre-
hospital intubation [61].
Several factors influence the success of intubation and
therefore a patient’s prognosis. Rapid sequence induction
appears to be the best method [62], however several as-
pects remain to be clarified, such as who is best suited
to make the decision to intubate, which drugs to use,
which rescue device and the ideal infrastructure of emer-
gency services. Most of the available data come from
retrospective studies, which are open to bias, therefore
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 5 of 55
 controversy remains about the appropriate use of
tracheal intubation in patients following traumatic
injury [63].
The negative effects of hypoxaemia are well known,
particularly in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI)
[64, 65], therefore, high oxygen concentrations are gen-
erally used to ensure oxygen delivery to ischaemic areas
in the initial management of these patients. Some stud-
ies, however, have suggested that the achievement ex-
treme hyperoxia is associated with increased mortality
[66]. The reason for this is unclear, but may be related
to increased production of free radicals or enhancement
of hyperoxic vasoconstriction, hence, avoidance may
be prudent. The level of hyperoxia that can become
harmful in trauma patients has not been defined, but
most studies consider a PaO2 above 200–300 mmHg
(27–40 kPa) to be too high [67, 68].
Adequate ventilation can affect the outcome of severe
trauma
patients.
There
is
a
tendency
for
rescue
personnel to hyperventilate patients during initial resus-
citation [69, 70], and hyperventilated trauma patients ap-
pear to have increased mortality when compared with
non-hyperventilated patients [66]. Target PaCO2 should
be 5.0–5.5 kPa (35–40 mmHg).
The effect of hyperventilation on bleeding and out-
come in patients with severe trauma without TBI is not
known. There are several potential mechanisms by
which the adverse effects of hyperventilation and hypo-
capnia could be mediated, including increased vasocon-
striction with decreased cerebral blood flow and impaired
tissue perfusion. Cerebral tissue lactic acidosis has been
shown to occur almost immediately after induction of
hypocapnia in children and adults with TBI and haemor-
rhagic shock [71]. In addition, an even modest level of
hypocapnia [<27 mmHg (3.6 kPa)] may result in neuronal
depolarisation with glutamate release and extension of the
primary injury via apoptosis [72]. In the setting of absolute
or relative hypovolaemia, an excessive rate of positive-
pressure ventilation may further compromise venous re-
turn and produce hypotension and even cardiovascular
collapse [73, 74].
The only situation in which hyperventilation-induced
hypocapnia may play a potential role is imminent cere-
bral herniation. The decrease in cerebral blood flow pro-
duced by acute hypocapnia during hyperventilation
causes a decrease in intracranial pressure that can be
used for short periods of time and in selected cases such
as imminent brain herniation. The presence of signs
such as unilateral or bilateral pupillary dilation or de-
cerebrate posturing are indicators for an extreme risk of
imminent death or irreversible brain damage. Hyperven-
tilation may be used under these circumstances to try to
gain time until other measures are effective [75, 76].
There are no clinical studies that evaluate this practice,
however, there is a clear physiological rationale. Given
the extreme risk of death if no measures are undertaken,
the risk–benefit balance seems favourable, however it is
important to normalise PaCO2 as soon as feasible.
Ventilation with low tidal volume (6 ml/kg) is rec-
ommended in patients with or at risk of acute respira-
tory distress syndrome (ARDS) [77]. In patients with
normal lung function, the data is more controversial,
but there is increasing evidence to support the idea
that the injurious effect of high tidal volume may be
initiated very early. Randomised studies demonstrate
that short-term ventilation (<5 h) with high tidal
volume (12 ml/kg) without positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP) may promote pulmonary inflamma-
tion and alveolar coagulation in patients with normal
lung
function
[78].
Although
more
studies
are
needed, the early use of protective ventilation with
low
tidal
volume
and
moderate
PEEP
is recom-
mended, particularly in bleeding trauma patients, who are
all at risk of ARDS.
II. Diagnosis and monitoring of bleeding
Initial assessment
Recommendation 4 We recommend that the physician
clinically assess the extent of traumatic haemorrhage
using a combination of patient physiology, anatomical
injury pattern, mechanism of injury and the patient’s
response to initial resuscitation. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
While blood loss may sometimes be obvious, neither vis-
ual estimation nor physiological parameters are good
guides to the degree of bleeding [79]. The mechanism of
injury represents an important screening tool with which
to identify patients at risk of significant haemorrhage.
For example, the American College of Surgeons defined
a threshold of 6 m (20 ft) as a “critical falling height” as-
sociated with major injuries [80]. Further critical mecha-
nisms include high-energy deceleration impact, low-
velocity versus high-velocity gunshot injuries, etc. The
mechanism of injury in conjunction with injury severity
and the patient’s physiological presentation and response
to resuscitation should further guide the decision to
initiate early surgical bleeding control as outlined in
the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol
[81–84]. Table 2 summarises estimated blood loss based
on initial presentation according to the ATLS classifica-
tion system. The ATLS classification has been demon-
strated to be a useful guide that allows the quantification
of blood loss with acceptable accuracy in haemorrhagic
shock [85]. However, several groups have highlighted
discrepancies associated with the weight assigned each
parameter when assessing blood loss that makes it difficult
to classify patients using this system. Mutschler et al.
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 6 of 55
 analysed the adequacy of this classification and found that
more than 90 % of all trauma patients could not be cate-
gorised according to the ATLS classification of hypovol-
aemic shock [86]. The same group analysed the validity of
the ATLS classification and concluded that this system
may underestimate mental disability in the presence of
hypovolaemic shock and overestimate the degree of tachy-
cardia associated with hypotension [87]. A retrospective
analysis of the validity of the ATLS classification showed
that increasing blood loss produces an increase in heart
rate and decrease in blood pressure, but to a lesser degree
than suggested by the ATLS classification. In addition,
there are no significant changes in respiratory rate or
in level of consciousness with bleeding [88]. Table 3
characterises the three types of response to initial fluid
resuscitation, whereby the transient responders and the
non-responders are candidates for immediate surgical
bleeding control.
Specific scores to predict the risk of haemorrhagic
shock may be useful to provide prompt and appropriate
treatment. The shock index (heart rate divided by sys-
tolic blood pressure) may be useful in predicting critical
bleeding [89] and can help to identify trauma patients
that will require intervention to achieve haemostasis
[90]. Paladino et al. [91] analysed the usefulness of the
shock index and found that this index may be useful to
draw attention to abnormal values, but that it is too in-
sensitive to rule out disease and should not lower the
suspicion of major injury. The Trauma-Associated
Severe Hemorrhage (TASH) score uses seven parame-
ters [systolic blood pressure, haemoglobin (Hb), intra-
abdominal fluid, complex long bone and/or pelvic
fractures, heart rate, base excess and gender] to predict
the probability of mass transfusion. Maegele et al. [92]
retrospectively analysed a dataset of severely multiply
injured patients from the German Trauma Registry to
confirm the validity of the TASH score to predict the
individual probability of massive transfusion and there-
fore ongoing life-threatening haemorrhage. The TASH
score was re-validated with 5834 patients from the
same registry [93].
Immediate intervention
Recommendation 5 We recommend that patients pre-
senting with haemorrhagic shock and an identified
source of bleeding undergo an immediate bleeding
control procedure unless initial resuscitation measures
are successful. (Grade 1B)

 Rationale
The source of bleeding may be immediately obvious,
and penetrating injuries are more likely to require surgi-
cal bleeding control. In a retrospective study of 106 ab-
dominal vascular injuries, all 41 patients arriving in
shock following gunshot wounds were candidates for
rapid transfer to the operating theatre for surgical bleed-
ing control [94]. A similar observation in a study of 271
patients undergoing immediate laparotomy for gunshot
wounds indicates that these wounds combined with
signs of severe hypovolaemic shock specifically require
early surgical bleeding control. This observation is true
to a lesser extent for abdominal stab wounds [95]. Data
on injuries caused by penetrating metal fragments from
explosives or gunshot wounds in the Vietnam War con-
firm the need for early surgical control when patients
present in shock [96]. In blunt trauma, the mechanism
of injury can to a certain extent determine whether the
patient in haemorrhagic shock will be a candidate for
surgical bleeding control. Only a few studies address the
relationship between the mechanism of injury and the
risk of bleeding, however, and none of these publications
describes a randomised prospective trial with high-level
evidence [97]. We have found no objective data describ-
ing the relationship between the risk of bleeding and the
mechanism of injury resulting in skeletal fractures in
general or of long-bone fractures in particular.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of pelvic in-
jury. Motor vehicle crashes cause approximately 60 %
of pelvic fractures followed by falls from great height
(23 %). Most of the remainder result from motorbike
collisions and vehicle-pedestrian accidents [98, 99].
There is a correlation between “unstable” pelvic frac-
tures and intra-abdominal injuries [98, 100]. An associ-
ation between major pelvic fractures and severe head
injuries, concomitant thoracic, abdominal, urological
and skeletal injuries is also well described [98]. High-
energy injuries produce greater damage to both the
pelvis and organs. Patients with high-energy injuries re-
quire more transfusion units, and more than 75 % have
associated head, thorax, abdominal or genitourinary in-
juries [101]. It is well documented that ‘unstable’ pelvic
fractures are associated with massive haemorrhage
[100, 102], and haemorrhage is the leading cause of
death in patients with major pelvic fractures. Vertical
shear pelvic ring fractures with caudal displacement of the
hemi-pelvis may disrupt the pelvic floor and pelvic vascu-
lature far more than standard vertical shear injuries.
Inferior displacement of the hemi-pelvis using X-ray
imaging should therefore alert the surgeon to the possible
presence of severe arterial injuries [103].

Further investigation
Recommendation 6 We recommend that patients
presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an uniden-
tified source of bleeding undergo immediate further
investigation. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
A patient in haemorrhagic shock with an unidentified
source of bleeding should undergo immediate further as-
sessment of chest, abdominal cavity and pelvic ring,
which represent the major sources of acute blood loss in
trauma. Aside from a clinical examination, X-rays of
chest and pelvis in conjunction with ultrasonography
[106] are recommended diagnostic modalities during the
primary survey [84, 107, 108].
In selected centres, readily available computed tom-
ography (CT) scanners [109] may replace conven-
tional
radiographic
imaging
techniques
during
the
primary survey. Huber-Wagner et al. analysed the ef-
fect of the distance between the trauma room and
the CT scanner on the outcome in a multicentre
study involving 8004 adult major blunt trauma pa-
tients at 312 hospitals and showed that close proxim-
ity of the CT scanner to the trauma room has a
significant positive effect on the survival of severely
injured patients. The authors suggest that emergency
department planning place the CT scanner in the
trauma room or within 50 meters [110]. In their sys-
tematic literature review, Jorgensen and colleagues
found no evidence that pre-hospital ultrasound of the
abdomen or chest improves the treatment of trauma
patients [111].
Imaging
Recommendation 7 We recommend early imaging
(ultrasonography or contrast-enhanced CT) for the
detection of free fluid in patients with suspected
torso trauma. (Grade 1B)
Intervention
Recommendation 8 We recommend that patients
with significant intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or
retroperitoneal bleeding and haemodynamic instability
undergo urgent intervention. (Grade 1A)
Further assessment
Recommendation 9 We recommend CT assessment
for haemodynamically stable patients. (Grade 1B)

 Rationale
Blunt abdominal trauma represents a major diagnostic
challenge and an important source of internal bleeding.
Ultrasonography has been established as a rapid and non-
invasive diagnostic approach for the detection of intra-
abdominal free fluid in the emergency room [112–114].
Large prospective observational studies determined a high
specificity and accuracy but low sensitivity of initial ultra-
sonographic examination for detecting intra-abdominal
injuries in adults and children [115–121]. Liu and
colleagues [122] found a high sensitivity, specificity
and accuracy of initial ultrasound examination for the
detection of haemoperitoneum. Ultrasonography has a
high specificity but a low sensitivity for detecting free
intraperitoneal fluid in penetrating torso trauma [123]
and in blunt abdominal trauma in children [124]. A
positive ultrasound suggests haemoperitoneum, but a
negative initial abdominal ultrasound should direct further
diagnostic investigations.
The role of CT scanning in acute trauma patients is
well documented [125–132], and in recent years imaging
for trauma patients has migrated towards multislice
computed tomography (MSCT). The integration of mod-
ern MSCT scanners in the emergency room area allows
the immediate assessment of trauma victims following ad-
mission [127, 128]. Using modern MSCT scanners, total
whole-body scanning time may be reduced to less than
30 seconds. In a retrospective study comparing 370 pa-
tients in two groups, Weninger and colleagues [128]
showed that faster diagnosis using MSCT led to shorter
emergency room and operating room time and shorter in-
tensive care unit (ICU) stays [128]. Huber-Wagner et al.
[109] also showed the benefit of integration of the whole-
body CT into early trauma care. CT diagnosis significantly
increases the probability of survival in patients with poly-
trauma [110]. Whole-body CT as a standard diagnostic
tool during the earliest resuscitation phase for polytrau-
matised patients provides the added benefit of identifying
head and chest injuries and other bleeding sources in
multiply injured patients.
Some authors have shown the benefit of contrast
medium-enhanced
CT
scanning.
Anderson
et
al.
[133, 134] found high accuracy in the evaluation of
splenic injuries resulting from trauma after administration
of intravenous (i.v.) contrast material. Delayed-phase CT
may be used to detect active bleeding in solid organs. Fang
et al. [135] demonstrated that the pooling of contrast
material within the peritoneal cavity in blunt liver injuries
indicates active and massive bleeding. Patients with this
finding showed rapid deterioration of haemodynamic sta-
tus, and most required emergent surgery. Intraparenchy-
mal pooling of contrast material with an unruptured liver
capsule often indicates a self-limited haemorrhage, and
these patients respond well to non-operative treatment.
Tan and colleagues [136] found that patients with hollow
viscus and mesenteric injuries following blunt abdominal
trauma exhibited an abnormal preoperative CT scan. Wu
et al. [137] showed the accuracy of CT in identifying se-
vere, life-threatening mesenteric haemorrhage and blunt
bowel injuries.
Compared to MSCT, all traditional techniques for
diagnostic and imaging evaluation are associated with
some limitations. The diagnostic accuracy, safety and ef-
fectiveness of immediate MSCT are dependent on so-
phisticated
pre-hospital
treatment
by
trained
and
experienced emergency personnel and short transporta-
tion times [138, 139]. If an MSCT is not available in the
emergency room, the realisation of CT scanning implies
transportation of the patient to the CT room, therefore
the clinician must evaluate the implications and poten-
tial risks and benefits of the procedure. During trans-
port, all vital signs should be closely monitored and
resuscitation measures continued. For those patients in
whom haemodynamic stability is questionable, imaging
techniques such as ultrasound and chest and pelvic radi-
ography may be useful. Peritoneal lavage is rarely indi-
cated if ultrasound or CT are available [140]. Transfer
times to and from all forms of diagnostic imaging need
to be considered carefully in any patient who is haemo-
dynamically unstable. In addition to the initial clinical
assessment, point-of-care testing results, including full
blood count, haematocrit (Hct), blood gases, and lactate,
should be readily available under ideal circumstances.
The hypotensive patient (systolic blood pressure below
90 mmHg) presenting free intra-abdominal fluid accord-
ing to ultrasonography or CT is a potential candidate for
early surgical intervention if he or she cannot be stabi-
lised by initiated fluid resuscitation [141–143]. A retro-
spective study by Rozycki and colleagues [144] of 1540
patients (1227 blunt, 313 penetrating trauma) assessed
with ultrasound as an early diagnostic tool showed that
the ultrasound examination had a sensitivity and specifi-
city close to 100 % when patients were hypotensive.
A number of patients who present with free intra-
abdominal fluid according to ultrasound can
safely
undergo further investigation using MSCT. Under normal
circumstances, adult patients need to be haemodynamic-
ally stable when MSCT is performed outside of the emer-
gency room [144]. Haemodynamically stable patients with
a high-risk mechanism of injury, such as high-energy
trauma or even low-energy injuries in elderly individuals,
should be scanned after ultrasound for additional injuries
using MSCT. As CT scanners are integrated in resuscita-
tion units, whole-body CT diagnosis may replace ultra-
sound as a diagnostic method.
MSCT is the gold standard for the identification of
retroperitoneal haemorrhage (RPH). After injection of
i.v. contrast solution, CT identified RPH in all cases
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 9 of 55
 (100 %) and may show the source of bleeding (40 %) by
extravasation of contrast media [145].
Haemodynamically unstable patients with significant
intrathoracic, intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleed-
ing may need urgent intervention. In these cases with
thoracic trauma and chest bleeding the insertion of a
chest tube is the first surgical step, usually just prior
to acute damage control thoracotomy. Surgical bleeding
control is necessary in unstable patients presenting
with haemoperitoneum. Patients with pelvic trauma
and significant retroperitoneal haematoma may need
external compression, retroperitoneal packing or ur-
gent radiologic embolisation for pelvic haemorrhage
control [146–148].
Haemoglobin
Recommendation 10 We recommend that a low ini-
tial Hb be considered an indicator for severe bleeding
associated with coagulopathy. (Grade 1B)
We recommend the use of repeated Hb measure-
ments as a laboratory marker for bleeding, as an initial
Hb value in the normal range may mask bleeding.
(Grade 1B)
Rationale
Hb or Hct assays are part of the basic diagnostic
work-up for trauma patients. Currently the use of Hb
rather than Hct is widespread, and the latter is a cal-
culated parameter derived from the Hb. However,
most studies on which these recommendations are
based analysed Hct rather than Hb. Because both pa-
rameters are used interchangeably in clinical practice,
in these guidelines we refer to both parameters ac-
cording to the parameter described by the literature
to which we refer.
The diagnostic value of the Hb or Hct for detecting
trauma patients with severe injury and occult bleeding
sources has been a topic of debate [149–151]. A major
limit of the Hb/Hct’s diagnostic value is the confounding
influence of resuscitation measures on the Hb/Hct due
to administration of i.v. fluids and erythrocyte concen-
trates [152–154]. In addition, initial Hb or Hct may not
accurately reflect blood loss because patients bleed
whole blood and compensatory mechanisms that move
fluids from interstitial space require time and may not
be reflected in initial measurements. The concept of the
low sensitivity of initial Hb/Hct for the detection of se-
vere bleeding has been challenged. In a retrospective
study of 196 trauma patients, Ryan et al. [155] found
that Hct at admission closely correlates with haemor-
rhagic shock. Other authors also recommended that the
initial Hct play a greater role in the assessment of blood
loss in trauma patients. In a retrospective analysis of
1492 consecutive trauma patients Thorson et al. found
that the initial Hct is associated more strongly with the
need for transfusion than other parameters such as heart
rate, blood pressure or acidaemia, suggesting that fluid
shifts are rapid after trauma and imply a more important
role for Hct in the initial assessment of trauma victims
[156]. An initial low Hb level is one of the predictive cri-
teria for massive transfusion using the TASH [92] and
Vandromme [157] scores.
Thorson et al. [158] analysed changes in Hct in two
successive determinations and concluded that the
change in Hct is a reliable parameter with which to
detect blood loss. Two prospective observational diag-
nostic studies also showed the sensitivity of serial Hct
measurements in the detection of patients with severe
injury [149, 150]. Decreasing serial Hct measurements
may reflect continued bleeding; however the patient
with significant bleeding may maintain the serial Hct
in the context of ongoing resuscitation and physio-
logical
compensatory
mechanisms.
Acute
anaemia
may play an adverse role in the clotting process be-
cause a low Hct may reduce platelet marginalisation
with a potentially negative impact on platelet activa-
tion. Moreover Schlimp et al. [159] demonstrated that
levels of fibrinogen lower than 150 mg/dl are detected
in as many as 73 % of the patients with admission Hb
lower than 10 g/dl.
Serum lactate and base deficit
Recommendation 11 We recommend serum lactate
and/or base deficit measurements as sensitive tests
to estimate and monitor the extent of bleeding and
shock. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
Serum lactate has been used as a diagnostic parameter
and prognostic marker of haemorrhagic shock since the
1960s [160]. The amount of lactate produced by anaer-
obic glycolysis is an indirect marker of oxygen debt, tis-
sue hypoperfusion and the severity of haemorrhagic
shock [161–164]. Similarly, base deficit values derived
from arterial blood gas analysis provide an indirect esti-
mation of global tissue acidosis due to impaired perfu-
sion [161, 163]. Vincent and colleagues [165] showed
the value of serial lactate measurements for predicting
survival in a prospective study in patients with circula-
tory shock. This study showed that changes in lactate
concentration provide an early and objective evaluation
of a patient’s response to therapy and suggested that re-
peated lactate determinations represent a reliable prog-
nostic index for patients with circulatory shock [165].
Abramson and colleagues [166] performed a prospective
observational study in patients with multiple traumatic
injuries to evaluate the correlation between lactate clear-
ance and survival. All patients in whom lactate levels
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 10 of 55
 returned to the normal range (≤2 mmol/l) within 24 h
survived. Survival decreased to 77.8 % if normalisation
occurred within 48 h and to 13.6 % in those patients in
whom lactate levels were elevated above 2 mmol/l for
more than 48 h [166]. These findings were confirmed in
a study by Manikis et al. [167], who showed that initial
lactate levels were higher in non-survivors after major
trauma and that prolongation of time to normalisation
of lactate levels of more than 24 h was associated with
the development of post-traumatic organ failure [167].
The determination of lactate and/or base deficit may be
particularly important in penetrating trauma. In this
type of trauma, triage vital signs such as blood pres-
sure, heart rate and respiratory rate do not reflect the
severity of injury and are not related to lactate or
base deficit levels [168].
The reliability of lactate determination may be lower
when traumatic injury is associated with alcohol con-
sumption. Ethanol metabolism induces the conversion
of pyruvate to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase, causing
an increase in the level of lactate in the blood. In
alcohol-associated trauma, therefore, base deficit may be
a better predictor of prognosis than lactate [169],
although some authors suggest that ethanol-induced
acidosis may also affect base deficit, masking the
prognosis of trauma patients [170]. Therefore, in the
case of traumatic injury associated with alcohol con-
sumption, the results of the lactate measurements
should be interpreted with caution.
Similar to the predictive value of lactate levels, the ini-
tial base deficit, obtained either from arterial or periph-
eral venous blood [171] has been established as a potent
independent predictor of mortality in patients with trau-
matic haemorrhagic shock [169]. Davis and colleagues
[172] stratified the extent of base deficit into three cat-
egories: mild (-3 to -5 mEq/l), moderate (-6 to -9 mEq/l)
and severe (<-10 mEq/l), and established a significant
correlation between the admission base deficit, transfu-
sion requirements within the first 24 h and the risk of
post-traumatic organ failure or death [172]. The same
group of authors showed that the base deficit is a better
prognostic marker of death than the pH in arterial blood
gas analyses [173]. Mutschler et al. [174] analysed a co-
hort of 16,305 severely injured patients derived from the
German Trauma Registry database and concluded that
the determination of base deficit upon emergency de-
partment admission predicts transfusion requirements
and mortality better than ATLS classification [174].
Furthermore, the base deficit was shown to represent
a highly sensitive marker for the extent of post-
traumatic shock and mortality, both in adult and
paediatric patients [175, 176].
In contrast to the data on lactate levels in haemor-
rhagic shock, reliable large-scale prospective studies on
the correlation between base deficit and outcome are
still lacking. Although both the base deficit and serum
lactate levels are well correlated with shock and resusci-
tation, these two parameters do not strictly correlate
with each other in severely injured patients [177]. There-
fore, the independent assessment of both parameters is
recommended for the evaluation of shock in trauma pa-
tients [161, 163, 177].
Coagulation monitoring
Recommendation 12 We recommend that routine
practice include the early and repeated monitoring of
coagulation, using either a traditional laboratory
determination
[prothrombin
time
(PT),
activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) platelet counts
and fibrinogen] (Grade 1A) and/or a viscoelastic
method. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Standard coagulation monitoring comprises the early
and repeated determination of PT, APTT, platelet counts
and fibrinogen. Increasing emphasis focuses on the im-
portance of fibrinogen and platelet measurements. It is
often assumed that the conventional coagulation screens
[international normalised ratio (INR) and APTT] moni-
tor coagulation, however these tests monitor only the
initiation phase of blood coagulation, and represent only
the first 4 % of thrombin production [178]. It is there-
fore possible that the conventional coagulation screen
appears normal, while the overall state of blood coagula-
tion is abnormal [13, 179–183]. In addition, the delay in
detection of traumatic coagulopathy can influence out-
come, and the turnaround time of thromboelastometry
has
been
shown
to
be
significantly
shorter
than
conventional laboratory testing, with a time saving of
30–60 min [181, 184, 185]. Viscoelastic testing may
also be useful in the detection of coagulation abnor-
malities associated with the use of direct thrombin in-
hibitors such as dabigatran, argatroban, bivalirudin or
hirudin. Furthermore, (early) variables of clot firmness
assessed by viscoelastic testing have been shown to be
good predictors for the need for massive transfusion,
the incidence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events
and for mortality in surgical and trauma patients
[181, 186–195]. Therefore, complete and rapid moni-
toring of
blood coagulation and fibrinolysis using
viscoelastic methods may facilitate a more accurate
targeting of therapy compared to conventional labora-
tory tests alone.
Tools such as thromboelastometry and portable coa-
gulometers have been developed to detect coagulopathy
in the emergency room or at the bedside, improving the
availability of real-time data to guide patient manage-
ment. Portable coagulometers that provide INR or
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 11 of 55
 APTT seem to provide acceptable accuracy for point-of-
care INR testing in the emergency department compared
with
laboratory-based
methods
[196–198],
however
others have observed a lack of agreement with conven-
tional laboratory determinations [199]. The usefulness of
the parameters measured is therefore limited.
Viscoelastic methods provide a rapid assessment of
coagulation to support clinical decision-making, gener-
ating a growing confidence in these methods and in-
creased use [200, 201]. Case series using viscoelastic
testing to assess trauma patients have been published.
One study applied rotational thrombelastography to 23
patients, but without a comparative standard [179].
Johansson et al. [180] implemented a haemostatic re-
suscitation regime [early platelets and fresh frozen
plasma (FFP)] guided using thrombelastography in a
before-and-after study (n = 832), which showed im-
proved outcomes. In a retrospective study of cardio-
vascular surgery patients (n = 3865) the combined use of
thromboelastometry and portable coagulometry resulted
in a reduction in blood product transfusion and thrombo-
embolic events, but did not influence mortality [202].
Rapid thrombelastography is a new variant of viscoelastic
testing in which coagulation is initiated by the addition of
kaolin and tissue factor that appears to reduce the meas-
urement time compared with conventional thrombelasto-
graphy [203].
Despite the widespread use of viscoelastic methods,
the usefulness has recently been questioned. In a re-
cent systematic review Hunt et al. [204] found no evi-
dence of the accuracy of thrombelastography and very
little evidence to support the accuracy of thromboelas-
tometry and were therefore unable to offer any advice
about the use of these methods [204]. In another sys-
tematic review Da Luz et al. [205] concluded that only
limited evidence from observational studies support
the use of viscoelastic tests to diagnose early traumatic
coagulopathy, but while these tests may predict blood-
product
transfusion,
mortality
and
other
patient-
important
outcomes
may
be
unaffected
[205].
A
number of other limitations to the use of viscoelastic
methods have been described. Larsen et al. [206] found
that thrombelastography was unable to distinguish coagu-
lopathies caused by dilution from thrombocytopenia,
whereas thromboelastometry was indeed capable of
distinguishing these two different types of coagulopa-
thy and suggesting the correct treatment [206]. The
use of thrombelastography may thus lead to unneces-
sary transfusion with platelets, whereas the application
of thromboelastometry may result in goal-directed
fibrinogen substitution. Although use is rapidly increas-
ing, controversy remains at present regarding the utility
of viscoelastic methods for the detection of post-
traumatic coagulopathy.
The agreement between viscoelastic methods and
standard coagulation test also remains a matter of
debate.
Some
studies
find
acceptable
agreement
[207–209],
however
a
number
of
other
studies
found significant discrepancies [25, 199, 210, 211]
even among different viscoelastic methods (throm-
belastography and thromboelastometry). Hagemo et
al. [212] found that the correlation was highly vari-
able at different stages of the clotting process and
between centres, highlighting the need for clarifica-
tion and standardisation of these techniques. One
limitation of viscoelastic tests is the lack of sensitiv-
ity to detect and monitor platelet dysfunction due
to antiplatelet drugs. If platelet dysfunction is ex-
pected, point-of-care platelet function tests, for ex-
ample whole blood impedance aggregometry, should be
used in addition to viscoelastic tests [213, 214]. More
research is required in this area, and in the meantime
physicians should use their own judgement when devel-
oping local policies.
It is theoretically possible that the pattern of change in
measures of coagulation such as D-dimers may help to
identify patients with ongoing bleeding. However, a single
publication showed that the positive predictive value
of D-dimers is only 1.8 % in the postoperative and/or
post-traumatic setting [215], therefore traditional methods
of detection for ongoing bleeding, such as serial clinical
evaluation of radiology (ultrasound, CT or angiography)
should be used.
III. Tissue oxygenation, type of fluid and temperature
management
Tissue oxygenation
Recommendation 13 We recommend a target systolic
blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg until major bleeding
has been stopped in the initial phase following
trauma without brain injury. (Grade 1C)
In patients with severe TBI (GCS ≤8), we recommend
that a mean arterial pressure ≥80 mmHg be main-
tained. (Grade 1C)
Restricted volume replacement
Recommendation
14
We
recommend
use
of
a
restricted volume replacement strategy to achieve
target blood pressure until bleeding can be controlled.
(Grade 1B)
Vasopressors and inotropic agents
Recommendation
15
In
the
presence
of
life-
threatening hypotension, we recommend administra-
tion of vasopressors in addition to fluids to maintain
target arterial pressure. (Grade 1C)
We recommend infusion of an inotropic agent in
the presence of myocardial dysfunction. (Grade 1C)

Page 12 of 55
 Rationale
In order to maintain tissue oxygenation, traditional
treatment of trauma patients used early and aggressive
fluid administration to restore blood volume. This ap-
proach may, however, increase the hydrostatic pressure
on the wound, cause dislodgement of blood clots, a dilu-
tion of coagulation factors and undesirable cooling of
the patient. The concept of “damage control resuscita-
tion” aims to achieve a lower than normal blood pres-
sure, also called “permissive hypotension”, and thereby
avoid the adverse effects of early aggressive resuscitation
using high doses of fluids while there is a potential risk
of tissue hypoperfusion during short periods [216]. The
general effectiveness of permissive hypotension remains
to be confirmed in randomised clinical trials, however,
two studies published in the 1990s demonstrated in-
creased survival when a low and delayed fluid volume
resuscitation concept was used in penetrating [217] or
penetrating and blunt [218] trauma. However, in con-
trast to these studies, no significant differences in sur-
vival were found in two further trials in patients with
either penetrating and blunt trauma [219] or blunt
trauma alone [220].
Several retrospective analyses published in the last few
years demonstrated that aggressive resuscitation tech-
niques, often initiated in the pre-hospital setting, may be
detrimental for trauma patients [9, 28, 221, 222]. One of
these studies showed that this strategy increased the
likelihood that patients with severe extremity injuries de-
veloped secondary abdominal compartment syndrome
(ACS) [221]. In that study, early large-volume crystalloid
administration was the greatest predictor of secondary
ACS. Moreover, another retrospective analysis using the
German Trauma Registry database, including 17,200
multiply injured patients, showed that the incidence of
coagulopathy increased with increasing volume of i.v.
fluids administered pre-clinically [9]. Coagulopathy was
observed in >40 % of patients with >2000 ml, in >50 %
with >3000 ml and in >70 % with >4000 ml adminis-
tered. Using the same trauma registry, a retrospective
matched pairs analysis (n = 1896) demonstrated that
multiply injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity
Score (ISS) ≥16 points and a systolic blood pressure
≥60 mmHg at the accident site who received pre-
hospital low-volume resuscitation (0–1500 ml) had a
higher survival rate than patients in whom a pre-
hospital high-volume strategy (≥1501 ml) was used
[28]. These results are supported by another retro-
spective analysis of patients from the US National
Trauma Data Bank [222]. In this study the authors
analysed 776,734 patients, of whom about 50 % re-
ceived pre-hospital i.v. fluid and 50 % did not. The
group of patients receiving preoperative i.v. fluids were
significantly more likely to die (OR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.05 to
1.17), an association which was especially marked in pa-
tients with penetrating mechanisms of injury (OR 1.25,
95 % CI 1.08 to 1.45), hypotension (OR 1.44, 95 % CI 1.29
to 1.59), severe head injury (OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.17 to
1.54) and patients undergoing immediate surgery (OR
1.35, 95 % CI 1.22 to 1.50). The authors concluded that
the routine use of pre-hospital i.v. fluid for all trauma pa-
tients should be discouraged. It should be noted that
this study, and especially its conclusion, has been cri-
ticised [223].
Initial use of a restrictive volume replacement strategy
is supported by a prospective randomised trial that ana-
lysed
the
consequences
of
an
initial
intra-hospital
hypotensive resuscitation strategy in trauma patients
with haemorrhagic shock [224]. In this study, with nearly
all of the 90 patients suffering from penetrating trauma,
patients who had at least one documented in-hospital
systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg were randomised to
a target minimum mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg
or 65 mmHg. One major drawback to this study was
that no statistically significant difference between the ac-
tual mean arterial pressure was observed between the
two groups over the duration of the study (64.4 mmHg
vs. 68.5 mmHg, P = 0.15). Although the authors could
not demonstrate a survival difference for the two treat-
ment strategies at day 30, 24 h postoperative death and
coagulopathy were increased in the group with the
higher target minimum pressure. The patients in this
group received not only more i.v. fluids overall, but also
more blood product transfusions. Another study that
supports a restrictive volume replacement strategy was
reported by Brown et al. [225]. In this study 1216 trauma
patients with an ISS >15 were included; 51 % suffered
from hypotension, defined as a systolic arterial blood
pressure (SAP) <90 mmHg. 68 % of the patients received
a volume load of >500 ml crystalloid solution. The
authors demonstrated that administration of >500 ml
pre-hospital crystalloid was associated with worse out-
come in patients without pre-hospital hypotension but
not in patients with hypotension. The administration of
>500 ml crystalloid was associated with a correction of
hypotension. The authors suggested that pre-hospital vol-
ume resuscitation should be goal-directed based on the
presence or absence of hypotension. Recently, Schreiber
et al. [226] assessed the feasibility and safety of controlled
resuscitation (n = 97) in hypotensive trauma patients com-
pared to standard resuscitation (n = 95). Patients were en-
rolled and randomised in the pre-hospital setting. Eligible
patients
had
a
pre-hospital
systolic
blood
pressure
≤90 mmHg. Controlled resuscitation patients received
250 ml fluid if no radial pulse or an SAP <70 mmHg was
present and additional 250 ml boluses to maintain a radial
pulse or a systolic blood pressure ≥70 mmHg. The mean
(SD) crystalloid volume administered during the study

 period was 1.0 l (1.5) in the controlled resuscitation group
and 2.0 l (1.4) in the standard resuscitation group. ICU-
free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury and renal fail-
ure did not differ between the groups.
A meta-analysis by Kwan et al. analysed randomised
trials that investigated the timing and volume of i.v. fluid
administration in bleeding trauma patients [227]. The
authors identified three trials that addressed the timing
of administration and that included a total of 1957 pa-
tients. Three studies investigated volume load, but in-
cluded only 171 patients. In contrast to the retrospective
analysis described above, the meta-analysis failed to
demonstrate an advantage associated with delayed com-
pared to early fluid administration nor of smaller com-
pared to larger volume fluid administration in this small
group of prospective studies that included only a very
limited number of patients. A further meta-analysis that
assessed seven retrospective observational studies that
included a total of 13,687 patients and three prospective
studies that included 798 patients estimated a small
benefit in favour of a restricted volume replacement
strategy [228], however, the authors cautioned that the
available studies were subject to a high risk of selection
bias and clinical heterogeneity.
It should be noted that a damage control resuscitation
strategy using restrictive volume replacement is contra-
indicated in patients with TBI and spinal injuries, be-
cause an adequate perfusion pressure is crucial to ensure
tissue oxygenation of the injured central nervous system
[229]. Rapid bleeding control is of particular importance
in these patients. In addition, the concept of permissive
hypotension should be carefully considered in the elderly
patient, and may be contraindicated if the patient suffers
from chronic arterial hypertension [230].
In conclusion, a damage control resuscitation strategy
that aims to achieve a lower than normal systolic blood
pressure of 80–90 mmHg using a concept of restricted
fluid replacement in patients without TBI and/or spinal
injury is supported by the literature, however strong
evidence from RCTs is lacking.
Vasopressors may also be required transiently to sus-
tain life and maintain tissue perfusion in the presence of
life-threatening hypotension, even when fluid expansion
is in progress and hypovolaemia has not yet been cor-
rected. Norepinephrine (NE) is often used to restore
arterial pressure in septic and haemorrhagic shock
and is now recommended as the agent of choice for
this purpose during septic shock [231]. Although NE
has some β-adrenergic effects, it acts predominantly
as a vasoconstrictor. Arterial α-adrenergic stimulation
increases arterial resistance and may increase cardiac
afterload; NE exerts both arterial and venous α-adrenergic
stimulation [232]. Indeed, in addition to its arterial vaso-
constrictor effect, NE induces venoconstriction at the level
of the splanchnic circulation in particular, which increases
the pressure in capacitance vessels and actively shifts
splanchnic blood volume to the systemic circulation
[233]. This venous adrenergic stimulation may recruit
some blood from the venous unstressed volume, i.e.,
the volume that fills the blood vessels without gener-
ating intravascular pressure. Moreover, stimulation of
β2-adrenergic receptors decreases venous resistance
and increases venous return [233].
Animal studies that investigated uncontrolled haemor-
rhage have suggested that NE infusion reduces the
amount of fluid resuscitation required to achieve a given
arterial pressure target, is associated with lower blood
loss and significantly improved survival [234, 235].
However, the effects of NE have not been rigorously
investigated in humans during haemorrhagic shock. An
interim analysis performed during an ongoing multicentre
prospective cohort study suggested that the early use of
vasopressors for haemodynamic support after haemor-
rhagic shock may be deleterious in comparison to aggres-
sive volume resuscitation and should be used cautiously
[236]. This study has several limitations, however. First,
this was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study
and was not designed to answer the specific hypothesis
tested, and second, the group receiving vasopressors had a
higher rate of thoracotomy. Thus, a prospective study
to define the effect of vasopressors on patients during
haemorrhagic shock is clearly needed.
A double-blind randomised trial to assess the safety
and efficacy of adding vasopressin to resuscitative fluid
has been performed [237]. Patients were given fluid
alone or fluid plus vasopressin (bolus 4 IU) and i.v. infu-
sion of 200 ml/h (vasopressin 2.4 IU/h) for 5 h. The fluid
plus vasopressin group needed a significantly lower total
resuscitation fluid volume over 5 days than the control
group (P = 0.04). The rates of adverse events, organ dys-
function and 30-day mortality were similar.
Vasopressors may be useful if used transiently to sus-
tain arterial pressure and maintain tissue perfusion in
the face of life-threatening hypotension. If used, it is es-
sential to respect the recommended objectives for SAP
(80–90 mmHg) in patients without TBI.
Because vasopressors may increase cardiac afterload if
the infusion rate is excessive or left ventricular function
is already impaired, an assessment of cardiac function
during the initial ultrasound examination is essential.
Cardiac dysfunction could be altered in the trauma pa-
tient following cardiac contusion, pericardial effusion or
secondary to brain injury with intracranial hypertension.
The presence of myocardial dysfunction requires treat-
ment with an inotropic agent such as dobutamine or epi-
nephrine. In the absence of an evaluation of cardiac
function or cardiac output monitoring, as is often the case
in the early phase of haemorrhagic shock management,
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 14 of 55
 cardiac dysfunction must be suspected in the presence of
a poor response to fluid expansion and NE.
Type of fluid
Recommendation
16
We
recommend
that
fluid
therapy using isotonic crystalloid solutions be initiated
in the hypotensive bleeding trauma patient. (Grade 1A)
We suggest that excessive use of 0.9 % NaCl solution
be avoided. (Grade 2C)
We recommend that hypotonic solutions such as
Ringer’s lactate be avoided in patients with severe
head trauma. (Grade 1C)
We suggest that the use of colloids be restricted
due to the adverse effects on haemostasis. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Although fluid resuscitation is the first step to restore
tissue perfusion in severe haemorrhagic shock, it is still
unclear whether crystalloids or colloids, and more specif-
ically which crystalloid or which colloid, should be used in
the initial treatment of the bleeding trauma patient.
In most trauma studies 0.9 % sodium chloride was
used as the crystalloid solution. However, recent studies
suggest that this crystalloid may increase acidosis and
the incidence of kidney injury in healthy volunteers or
critically ill adults [238, 239]. In contrast to 0.9 % so-
dium chloride, balanced electrolyte solutions contain
physiological or near-physiological concentrations of
electrolytes. Recently, in a small prospective randomised
trial in 46 trauma patients a balanced electrolyte solution
improved acid-base status and caused less hyperchlorae-
mia at 24 h post injury compared to 0.9 % sodium chlor-
ide [240]. A secondary analysis of this study demonstrated
that the use of a balanced electrolyte solution resulted in a
net cost benefit in comparison to the use of 0.9 % saline
chloride [241]. Therefore, if 0.9 % sodium chloride is used
it should be limited to a maximum of 1–1.5 l.
If crystalloids are used, hypotonic solutions such as
Ringer’s lactate should be avoided in patients with TBI
in order to minimise a fluid shift into the damaged
cerebral tissue. In addition, the use of solutions with
the potential to restore pH may be advantageous, since
a recent study demonstrated that Ringer’s acetate solu-
tion more rapidly ameliorated splanchnic dysoxia, as
evidenced by gastric tonometry, than Ringer’s lactate
[242].
Whether
an
advantage
for
certain
isotonic
balanced crystalloids with respect to a reduced morbid-
ity or mortality exists is not clear and remains to be
evaluated [241, 243].
The most recent Cochrane meta-analysis on the type
of fluid, colloids or crystalloids, failed to demonstrate
that colloids reduce the risk of death compared to resus-
citation with crystalloids in critically ill patients treated
in an ICU [244]. The authors compared the use of
albumin or plasma protein fraction with crystalloids,
performing an analysis of 24 trials that included a total
of 9920 patients, and demonstrated a pooled risk ratio
(RR) of 1.01 (95 % CI 0.93 to 1.10). Twenty-five trials
compared hydroxyethyl starch (HES) to crystalloids in a
total of 9147 patients, demonstrating a beneficial effect
in favour of crystalloids [RR 1.10 (1.02 to 1.19)], and
modified gelatin was assessed in 11 trials that included a
total of 506 patients showing neither a beneficial nor a
deleterious effect [RR 0.91 (0.49 to 1.72)]. The authors
concluded that there is no evidence that resuscitation
with colloids has any beneficial effect on survival, and
HES may even cause harm. However, neither the time
point of fluid resuscitation nor the duration and dosages
of fluid resuscitation were analysed or discussed. Never-
theless, at the present time good data demonstrating the
benefit of colloids are lacking.
Since colloids are also more expensive than crystal-
loids, if fluids are used during the initial treatment phase
as part of the restricted volume replacement strategy,
administration of crystalloids rather than colloids to
treat the hypotensive bleeding trauma patient seems to
be justified. Also in later stages of resuscitation, large
volume crystalloid administration is not independently
associated with multiple organ failure [245]. In addition,
if high ratios of FFP:RBC (red blood cells) cannot be ad-
ministered to trauma patients, a retrospective study
showed that resuscitation with at least 1 l crystalloid per
unit RBC seems to be associated with reduced overall
mortality [246].
At present it is not clear whether, and if, which col-
loids should be used if crystalloids fail to restore target
blood pressure. Bunn et al. published a Cochrane meta-
analysis with the aim of comparing the effects of differ-
ent colloid solutions in a total of 5484 patients thought
to require volume replacement [247]. From this review,
there is no evidence that one colloid solution is more ef-
fective or safer than any other, although the confidence
intervals were wide and do not exclude clinically signifi-
cant differences between colloids. Nevertheless, there
are conflicting meta-analysis data showing on the one
hand increased kidney injury and increased mortality in
critically ill patients treated with HES [248, 249] and on
the other hand no differences in the incidence of death
or acute kidney failure in surgical patients receiving 6 %
HES [250]. It seems doubtful whether any conclusions
can be drawn from these studies performed mostly
under completely different conditions than are present
in the acute hypovolaemic trauma patient. In addition to
these conflicting results, a recent in vitro study using
blood from healthy volunteers demonstrated that coagu-
lation and platelet function are impaired by all HES and
gelatin solutions [251]. However, gelatin-induced coagulop-
athy was reversible with the administration of fibrinogen,
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 15 of 55
 whereas HES-induced coagulopathy was not. So far, only
one small RCT described a benefit for a HES solution in
trauma patients. HES (130/0.4) provided significantly bet-
ter lactate clearance and less renal injury than saline in 67
penetrating trauma patients [252]. Because only 42 blunt
trauma patients were included in the study, no differences
in these parameters could be observed using the different
solutions. Therefore, if colloids are administered in patients
in whom crystalloids fail to restore target blood pressure,
dosing should be within the prescribed limits and, if HES
is employed, a modern HES solution should be used.
A number of studies have investigated hypertonic so-
lutions. In 2008, a double-blind RCT in 209 patients
with blunt traumatic injuries analysed the effect of treat-
ment with 250 ml 7.5 % hypertonic saline and 6 % dex-
tran 70 compared to lactated Ringer’s solution on organ
failure [253]. The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated
no significant difference in organ failure and in ARDS-
free survival. However, there was improved ARDS-free
survival in the subset (19 % of the population) requiring
10 U or more of packed RBC [253]. A clinical trial with
brain injury patients found that hypertonic saline re-
duced intracranial pressure more effectively than dextran
solutions with 20 % mannitol when compared in equi-
molar dosing [254]. However, Cooper et al. found almost
no difference in neurological function 6 months after
TBI in patients who had received pre-hospital hyper-
tonic saline resuscitation compared to conventional
fluid [255]. Moreover, two large prospective rando-
mised multicentre studies by Bulger and co-workers
[256, 257] analysed the effect of out-of-hospital ad-
ministration of hypertonic fluids on neurological out-
come
following
severe
TBI
and
survival
after
traumatic hypovolaemic shock. These studies were
not able to demonstrate any advantage compared to
normal 0.9 % saline among the 2184 patients in-
cluded. In contrast, a recent study demonstrated that
hypertonic solutions interfere with coagulation in this
group of patients [258].
In conclusion, the evidence suggests that hyper-
tonic saline solutions are safe, but will neither im-
prove survival nor improve neurological outcome
after TBI. So far only one study reported that initial
fluid resuscitation with hypertonic saline dextran was
beneficial and improved survival compared to normal
saline [259].
Erythrocytes
Recommendation 17 We recommend a target Hb of 7
to 9 g/dl. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Oxygen delivery to tissues is the product of blood flow
and arterial oxygen content, which is directly related to
the Hb concentration, therefore decreasing Hb might be
expected to give tissue hypoxia. However, compensatory
responses to acute normovolaemic anaemia occur, in-
cluding macro- and microcirculatory changes in blood
flow, so the clinical effects of low Hb are complex.
RCTs that have evaluated Hb thresholds for transfu-
sion in critically ill patients have consistently found that
restrictive transfusion strategies (Hb thresholds between 7
and 9 g/dL) are as safe as, or safer than, liberal strategies
(thresholds ≥9 g/dL) [260–263], with the possible excep-
tion of patients following cardiac surgery [264] or with
acute coronary syndrome. These studies have excluded
patients with massive bleeding. No prospective RCT has
compared restrictive and liberal transfusion regimens in
trauma patients. A subset of 203 trauma patients from the
Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC)
trial [260] was re-analysed [265]. A restrictive transfu-
sion regimen (Hb transfusion trigger <7.0 g/dl) re-
sulted in fewer transfusions compared with the liberal
transfusion regimen (Hb transfusion trigger <10 g/dl)
and appeared to be safe. However, no statistically sig-
nificant benefit in terms of multiple organ failure or
post-traumatic infections was observed. It should be
emphasised that this study was neither designed nor
powered to answer these questions with precision. In
addition, it cannot be ruled out that the number of
RBC units transfused merely reflects the severity of
injury.
Nevertheless,
RBC
transfusions
have
been
shown in multiple studies to be associated with in-
creased mortality [266–270], lung injury [270–272],
increased infection rates [273, 274] and renal failure
in trauma victims [269].
Because anaemia is a possible cause of secondary is-
chaemic damage, concerns have been raised about the
safety of restrictive transfusion strategies in the subpop-
ulation of patients with TBI. Most early clinical informa-
tion comes from retrospective observational studies with
important methodological limitations. These data have
yielded inconsistent results on the effects of RBC trans-
fusion on markers of cerebral perfusion and metabolism
in patients with isolated severe TBI. Two systematic re-
views published in 2012 stressed the lack of high-level
scientific evidence for a specific Hb transfusion trigger
in this setting [275, 276]. More recently, two studies
have focused on the effect of anaemia and RBC transfu-
sion on neurological outcome after TBI [277, 278]. A
retrospective review of data collected prospectively in
1158 patients with a GCS ≤8 in the absence of haemor-
rhagic shock found that RBC transfusion was associated
with worse outcomes (28-day survival, ARDS-free sur-
vival, 6-month neurological outcome) when the initial
Hb was >10 g/dl [277]. No relationship between RBC
transfusion and outcomes was found in patients with an
initial Hb ≤10 g/dl [277]. In a 2 × 2 factorial design RCT
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 16 of 55
 of 200 patients with TBI at two clinical sites, Robertson
et al. compared two Hb transfusion thresholds (7 or
10 g/dl), and separately compared administration of
erythropoietin (EPO) or placebo [278]. Patients were en-
rolled within 6 h of injury and 99 patients were assigned
to the 7 g/dl transfusion threshold and 101 patients to
the 10 g/dl threshold. The main outcome was neuro-
logical recovery at 6 months that was assessed using the
Glasgow Outcome Scale dichotomised as favourable or
unfavourable. No advantage was found in favour of the
10 g/dl Hb level. In the 7 g/dl threshold group, 42.5 % of
patients had a favourable outcome, compared to 33.0 %
in the 10 g/dl threshold group (95 % CI for difference
−0.06 to 0.25). There was no difference in mortality.
More thromboembolic events were observed in the
10 g/dl threshold group [278]. Overall, patients with se-
vere TBI should not be managed with a Hb transfusion
threshold different than that of other critically ill
patients.
Erythrocytes contribute to haemostasis by influencing
the biochemical and functional responsiveness of acti-
vated platelets via the rheological effect on platelet mar-
gination and by supporting thrombin generation [279].
The effects of the Hct on blood coagulation have not
been fully elucidated [280]. An acute reduction of the
Hct results in an increase in the bleeding time [281,
282], with restoration upon re-transfusion [281]. This
may relate to the presence of the enzyme elastase on the
surface of RBC membranes, which may activate coagula-
tion factor IX [283, 284]. However, an animal model
showed that a moderate reduction in Hct does not in-
crease blood loss from a standard spleen injury [282],
and an isolated in vitro reduction of the Hct did not
compromise blood coagulation as assessed by thromboe-
lastometry [285].
Alternative methods of raising Hb have been little
studied.
The
erythropoietic
response
is
blunted
in
trauma patients [286] and therefore the administration
of epoetin alpha appears an attractive option. In a first
prospective randomised trial in ICU patients (n = 1302,
48 % being trauma patients) a significant reduction
in RBC transfusion percentage from 60.4 to 50.5 %
(P < 0.001) and reduction in the median number of RBC
units transfused from two to one (P < 0.001) was observed
[287]. In the subgroup of trauma patients 28-day mortality
was also reduced [OR 0.43 (0.23 to 0.81)] [287]. In a
subsequent prospective randomised trial in ICU patients
(n = 1460, 54 % being trauma patients) no significant re-
duction in RBC transfusions was found [288]. Thrombotic
complications were higher in epoetin alpha-treated pa-
tients [HR 1.58 (1.09 to 2.28)], however this difference was
observed exclusively in patients without heparin prophy-
laxis [288]. Nevertheless, a trend towards a reduced mor-
tality was found in the entire group of ICU patients, and
trauma patients had a lower 29-day [adjusted HR 0.37
(0.19 to 0.72)] and 140-day mortality [adjusted HR 0.40
(0.23 to 0.69)] when treated with epoetin alpha. A third
prospective randomised trial enrolled patients (n = 194)
with major blunt orthopaedic trauma [289], and no signifi-
cant effect of epoetin alpha was found, however this study
was characterised by a nearly 50 % drop-out rate during
the study and a non-significant result is therefore not
surprising.
The relatively limited effect of epoetin alpha treatment
on transfusion needs may be surprising given the
blunted EPO response in trauma patients [286]. How-
ever, iron metabolism is also altered after trauma, with
iron not being fully available for haematopoiesis [286].
Neither iron metabolism nor availability are fully under-
stood following traumatic injury and complicated by the
fact that certain proteins such as ferritin are massively
upregulated after trauma as part of the acute-phase re-
sponse [286]. Intravenous iron may therefore represent
another attractive option with which to foster haem-
atopoiesis. Indeed, studies that assess the effect of
i.v. iron (with [290, 291] or without [292] concomi-
tant epoetin alpha) showed reduced RBC transfu-
sions [290–292], postoperative infections [290–292],
length of hospital stay [291] and mortality in pa-
tients with hip fractures [291]. While i.v. iron ap-
pears to be promising, oral iron is largely ineffective
[293]. In the near future, the Efficacy of Ferric Carboxy-

Period
(PAHFRAC-01) project, a prospective randomised multi-
centre study (NCT01154491), will provide further insight
into the benefit of i.v. iron and epoetin alpha treatment in
patients with hip fracture [294].
In non-trauma patients a meta-analysis showed that
preoperative i.v. iron administration was efficacious in
correcting preoperative anaemia and in lowering RBC
transfusion rates in elective surgery, but found an in-
creased infection rate [295]. This potential risk has not
been evaluated for postoperative i.v. iron administration
or in trauma patients. Interestingly, i.v. iron treatment in
20,820 haemodialysis patients was associated with a
trend towards lower infection rates, lower mortality and
a shorter hospital stay [296]. Similarly, i.v. iron treatment
equally in anaemic mice with sepsis did not cause in-
creased mortality and corrected anaemia [297]. Short-
term preoperative treatment with iron carboxymaltose
and epoetin alpha also resulted in a highly significant de-
crease in postoperative infectious complications (12.0 to
7.9 %) and a shortening of hospitalisation by ap-
proximately 1 day in anaemic patients undergoing
orthopaedic surgery [291]. In addition, 30-day mor-
tality decreased from 9.4 to 4.8 % in patients with
hip fractures [291]. The potential adverse effect of
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 17 of 55
 i.v. iron administration in trauma patients may thus
be overestimated and certainly remains to be investi-
gated further.
Temperature management
Recommendation 18 We recommend early applica-
tion of measures to reduce heat loss and warm the
hypothermic patient in order to achieve and maintain
normothermia. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Hypothermia, a core body temperature <35 °C, is associ-
ated with acidosis, hypotension and coagulopathy in se-
verely injured patients. The effects of hypothermia
include altered platelet function, impaired coagulation
factor function (a 1 °C drop in temperature is associated
with a 10 % drop in function), enzyme inhibition and fi-
brinolysis [298–300]. Body temperatures below 34 °C
compromise blood coagulation, but this has only been
observed when coagulation tests (PT and APTT) are car-
ried out at the low temperatures seen in patients with
hypothermia, and not when assessed at 37 °C as is routine
practice for such tests.
The profound clinical effects of hypothermia ultim-
ately lead to higher morbidity and mortality [301],
and hypothermic patients require more blood prod-
ucts [302]. In a retrospective study of 604 trauma pa-
tients who required massive transfusion, a logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that a temperature
lower than 34 °C was associated with a greater inde-
pendent risk of mortality of more than 80 % after
controlling for differences in shock, coagulopathy, in-
jury severity and transfusion requirements (OR 1.87;
95 % CI 1.18 to 3.0; P = 0.007) [303]. A recent study
performed a secondary data analysis of 10 years of
the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study (PTOS),
which analysed 11,033 patients with severe TBI and
demonstrated that spontaneous hypothermia at hos-
pital admission was associated with a significant in-
crease in the risk of mortality in patients with severe
TBI [304]. Steps to prevent hypothermia and the risk
of hypothermia-induced coagulopathy include removing
wet clothing, covering the patient to avoid additional heat
loss, increasing the ambient temperature, forced air warm-
ing, warm fluid therapy, and, in extreme cases, extracor-
poreal re-warming devices [305–307].
Whereas accidental or induced hypothermia should
clearly be avoided in patients without TBI, contradictory
results have been reported in patients with TBI. In this
trauma setting several large multicentre clinical trials
failed to show an effect of therapeutic hypothermia
[308–310], while a recent meta-analysis by Crossley et
al., which also included several single-centre studies,
demonstrated an overall reduction in mortality and poor
outcomes [311]. Earlier meta-analyses that examined
mortality and neurological outcomes associated with
mild hypothermia in TBI were not able to demonstrate
such a benefit, which might be explained by the use of
different exclusion and inclusion criteria for the analysis
[312, 313]. Another reason for controversial results
could be differences in the speed of induction and dur-
ation of hypothermia, for example it has been shown
that 5 days of long-term cooling is more efficacious than
2 days of short-term cooling when mild hypothermia is
used to control refractory intracranial hypertension in
adults with severe TBI [314, 315]. Moreover, the situ-
ation might be different if hypothermia in TBI is com-
pared
to
conventional
treatment
that
allows
fever
episodes or compared to strict temperature control be-
tween 35.5 and 37 °C [310]. Therefore, at the present
time no recommendation can be made in favour of the
therapeutic use of whole-body hypothermia in TBI
patients.
IV. Rapid control of bleeding
Damage control surgery
Recommendation 19 We recommend that damage
control surgery be employed in the severely injured pa-
tient presenting with deep haemorrhagic shock, signs
of ongoing bleeding and coagulopathy. (Grade 1B)
Other factors that should trigger a damage control
approach
are
severe
coagulopathy,
hypothermia,
acidosis, inaccessible major anatomic injury, a need
for
time-consuming
procedures
or
concomitant
major injury outside the abdomen. (Grade 1C)
We recommend primary definitive surgical man-
agement in the haemodynamically stable patient
and in the absence of any of the factors above.
(Grade 1C)
Rationale
The severely injured patient arriving at the hospital with
continuing bleeding or deep haemorrhagic shock gener-
ally has a poor chance of survival without early control
of bleeding, proper resuscitation and blood transfusion.
This is particularly true for patients who present with
uncontrolled bleeding due to multiple penetrating injur-
ies or patients with major abdominal injury and unstable
pelvic fractures with bleeding from fracture sites and
retroperitoneal vessels. The final common pathway in
these patients is the exhaustion of physiological reserves
with resulting profound acidosis, hypothermia and coag-
ulopathy, also known as the “bloody vicious cycle” or
“lethal triad”.
In 1983, Stone et al. described the techniques of abbre-
viated laparotomy, packing to control haemorrhage and
of deferred definitive surgical repair until coagulation
has been established [316]. Several articles have since
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 18 of 55
 described the beneficial results of this approach, now re-
ferred to as “damage control” [317–320]. This approach
should be considered in patients with major abdominal
injury and a need for adjunctive use of angioembolisa-
tion, major abdominal injury and a need to evaluate as
early possible other injuries, major abdominal injury and
traumatic amputation of a limb. Factors that should trig-
ger a damage control approach in the operating theatre
are temperature ≤34 °C, pH ≤7.2, an inaccessible major
venous injury, a need for time-consuming procedures in
a patient with suboptimal response to resuscitation or
inability to achieve haemostasis due to recalcitrant coag-
ulopathy [321, 322].
Damage control surgery of the abdomen consists of
three components: the first component is an abbreviated
resuscitative laparotomy for control of bleeding, the res-
titution of blood flow where necessary and the control
of contamination. This should be achieved as rapidly as
possible without spending unnecessary time on trad-
itional organ repairs that can be deferred to a later
phase. The abdomen is packed and temporary abdom-
inal closure is performed. Packing aims to compress liver
ruptures or exert direct pressure on the sources of
bleeding and abdominal packing may permit further at-
tempts to achieve total haemostasis through angiography
and/or correction of the “lethal triad”. The removal of
packs should preferably be deferred for at least 48 h to
lower the risk of re-bleeding.
The second component of damage control surgery is
intensive care treatment, focused on core re-warming,
correction of the acid-base imbalance and coagulopathy
as well as optimising the ventilation and the haemo-
dynamic status. If complementary angiography and/or
further injury investigation is needed, it should be per-
formed during this phase.
The third component is the definitive surgical repair
that is performed only when target parameters have
been achieved [95, 317–320, 323, 324]. Although the
concept of “damage control” intuitively makes sense, no
RCTs exist to support it. Retrospective studies support
the concept showing reduced morbidity and mortality
rates in selective populations [320].
The same “damage control” principles have been ap-
plied to orthopaedic injuries in severely injured patients.
Scalea et al. were the first to coin the term “damage con-
trol orthopaedics” [325]. Relevant fractures are primarily
stabilised with external fixators rather than primary
definitive osteosynthesis [325–327]. The less traumatic
nature and shorter duration of the surgical procedure
aims to reduce the secondary procedure-related trauma.
Definitive osteosynthesis surgery can be performed after
4–14 days when the patient has recovered sufficiently.
Retrospective clinical studies and prospective cohort
studies seem to support the concept of damage control.
The only available randomised study shows an advantage
for this strategy in “borderline” patients [327]. The dam-
age control concept has also been described for thoracic
and neurosurgery [328, 329]. In addition to damage con-
trol surgical approaches, damage control anaesthesia or
resuscitation comprises a number of important measures
described in the other recommendations within this
document.
Pelvic ring closure and stabilisation
Recommendation 20 We recommend that patients
with pelvic ring disruption in haemorrhagic shock
undergo immediate pelvic ring closure and stabilisa-
tion. (Grade 1B)
Packing, embolisation and surgery
Recommendation 21 We recommend that patients
with ongoing haemodynamic instability despite ad-
equate pelvic ring stabilisation receive early pre-
peritoneal packing, angiographic embolisation and/or
surgical bleeding control. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
The mortality rate for patients with severe pelvic
ring disruptions and haemodynamic instability re-
mains high [330, 331]. The early detection of these
injuries and initial efforts to reduce disruption and
stabilise the pelvis as well as containing bleeding is
therefore
crucial.
Markers
of
pelvic
haemorrhage
include anterior-posterior and vertical shear defor-
mations on standard roentgenograms, CT “blush”
(active arterial extravasation), bladder compression
pressure, pelvic haematoma evident by CT and on-
going haemodynamic instability despite adequate frac-
ture stabilisation [332–334].
The initial therapy for pelvic fractures includes
control of venous and/or cancellous bone bleeding
by pelvic closure as a first step [335]. Some institu-
tions use primarily external fixators to control haem-
orrhage
from
pelvic
fractures
[332],
but
pelvic
closure may also be achieved using a pelvic binder, a
pelvic C-clamp or improvised methods such as a bed
sheet [335, 336]. In addition to the pelvic closure,
fracture stabilisation and the tamponade effect of the
haematoma, pre-, extra or retroperitoneal packing
will reduce or stop the venous bleeding [337–339].
Pre-peritoneal packing is used to decrease the need
for pelvic embolisation and may be performed simultan-
eously, or soon after, initial pelvic fracture stabilisation.
The most commonly embolised vascular bed and there-
fore the most studied is the pelvis [340]. Pelvic packing
could potentially aid in early intrapelvic bleeding control
and provide crucial time for more selective haemorrhage
management [337, 339].
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 19 of 55
 Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the
aorta (REBOA) has been used in patients in end-stage
shock following blunt and penetrating trauma together
with embolisation of the vascular bed in the pelvis.
Descriptions of REBOA are few and there are no pub-
lished trials. Some combined approaches are reported
and the technology is evolving [331]. These techniques
can be combined with a consecutive laparotomy if
deemed necessary [337]. This may decrease the high
mortality rate observed in patients with major pelvic
injuries who have undergone laparotomy as the pri-
mary intervention, however non-therapeutic laparotomy
should be avoided [341]. Time to pelvic embolisation for
haemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures may affect
survival [331, 342].
Angiography and embolisation are currently accepted
as highly effective means with which to control arterial
bleeding that cannot be controlled by fracture stabilisa-
tion [146, 332, 336, 339, 341, 343, 344]. Radiological
management can also be usefully applied to abdominal
and thoracic bleeding [345–349]. Martinelli et al. [350]
report the use of intra-aortic balloon occlusion to reduce
bleeding and permit transport to the angiography the-
atre. In contrast, Morozumi et al. suggest the use of mo-
bile digital subtraction angiography in the emergency
department
for
arterial
embolisation
performed
by
trauma surgeons themselves [351]. A number of authors
argue that permissive hypotension while obtaining pelvic
stabilisation and/or angiography (damage control resus-
citation, hypertonic solutions, controlled hypothermia)
could achieve better survival. Institutional differences in
the capacity to perform timely angiography and embol-
isation may explain the different treatment algorithms
suggested by many authors. Reports on transcatheter
angiographic embolisation suggest a 100 % higher mor-
tality during off-hours due to lack of radiological service
[352], therefore a multidisciplinary approach to these se-
vere injuries is required.
Local haemostatic measures
Recommendation 22
We recommend the use of
topical haemostatic agents in combination with other
surgical measures or with packing for venous or
moderate arterial bleeding associated with parenchy-
mal injuries. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
A wide range of local haemostatic agents are currently
available for use as adjuncts to traditional surgical tech-
niques to obtain haemorrhagic control. These topical
agents can be particularly useful when access to the site
of bleeding is difficult. Local haemostatic agents include
collagen, gelatin or cellulose-based products, fibrin and
synthetic glues or adhesives that can be used for both
external and internal bleeding while polysaccharide-
based and inorganic haemostatics are still mainly used
and approved for external bleeding.
The use of topical haemostatic agents should consider
several factors such as the type of surgical procedure,
cost, severity of bleeding, coagulation status and each
agent’s specific characteristics. Some of these agents
should be avoided when autotransfusion is applied, and
several other contraindications need to be considered
[353, 354]. The capacity of each agent to control bleed-
ing was initially studied in animals, but increasing ex-
perience in humans is now available [353–369].
The different types of local haemostatic agents are
briefly presented according to their basis and haemo-
static capacity.
� Collagen-based agents trigger platelet aggregation,
resulting in clot formation when in contact with a
bleeding surface. They are often combined with a
procoagulant substance such as thrombin to
enhance the haemostatic effect. A positive
haemostatic effect has been shown in several human
studies [360–363].
� Gelatin-based products can be used alone or in
combination with a procoagulant substance [353].
Swelling of the gelatin in contact with blood reduces
the blood flow and, in combination with a
thrombin-based component, enhances haemostasis
[357–359]. The products have been successfully used
for local bleeding control in brain or thyroid surgery
when electrocautery may cause damage to nerves
[356] or to control bleeding from irregular surfaces
such as post-sinus surgery [355].
� Absorbable cellulose-based haemostatic agents have
been widely used to treat bleeding for many years, and
case reports as well as a prospective observational
human study support their effectiveness [368].
The oxidised cellulose-based product can be
impregnated with polyethylene glycol and other
salts and achieve comparable and more rapid
haemostasis compared to the combined
products described below [367].
� Fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives have both
haemostatic and sealant properties, and their
significant effect on haemostasis has been shown in
several randomised controlled human studies
involving vascular, bone, skin and visceral surgery
[364–366].
� Polysaccharide-based haemostatics can be divided
into two broad categories [353]: N-acetyl-
glucosamine-containing glycosaminoglycans purified
from microalgae and diatoms and microporous
polysaccharide haemospheres produced from potato
starch. The mechanism of action is complex and
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 20 of 55
 depends on the purity or combination with other
substances such as cellulose or fibrin. A number of
different products in the form of pads, patches or
bandages are currently available and have been
shown to be efficient for external use and for
splanchnic bleeding in animals. An observational
study showed that haemorrhage control was
achieved using a poly-N-acetyl glucosamine-based
bandage applied to ten patients with severe hepatic
and abdominal injuries, acidosis and clinical
coagulopathy [369].
Although the evidence is mainly observational, these
agents have become widely used.
V. Initial management of bleeding and coagulopathy
Coagulation support
Recommendation 23 We recommend that monitoring
and measures to support coagulation be initiated im-
mediately upon hospital admission. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
Some means with which to evaluate trauma-related co-
agulopathy have been developed [370], however, these
largely confirm the main pathophysiological mechanisms
described above [371, 372]. While several general patho-
physiological mechanisms can be described that result in
trauma-related coagulopathy, it is essential to quickly
determine the type and degree of coagulopathy in the
individual patient in order to determine the most
prominent cause or causes to be treated specifically
in a goal-directed manner [373].
Early monitoring of coagulation is essential to de-
tect trauma-induced coagulopathy and to define the
main causes, including hyperfibrinolysis [13, 25, 179,
183, 374]. Early therapeutic intervention does im-
prove coagulation tests [375], reduce the need for
transfusion of RBC, FFP and platelets [12, 376], re-
duce
the
incidence
of
post-traumatic
multi-organ
failure, shorten length of hospital stay [12] and may
improve survival [377, 378]. Interestingly, the success
of early algorithm-based and goal-directed coagula-
tion management in reducing transfusions and im-
proving outcome, including mortality, has also been
shown in cardiac surgery [202, 379–381]. Therefore,
early algorithm-based and goal-directed coagulation
management treatment is likely to improve the out-
come of severely injured patients [382, 383]. This
has indeed been shown in a prospective randomised
study [384] and in a large study assessing the introduction
of such a concept in two large Italian trauma centres
[385]. However, there are also studies in which no survival
benefit could be shown [375, 386, 387]; variation in
published results may be due to choice of coagulation
monitoring tests (negative trials tended to use trad-
itional laboratory values such as PT, APTT and plate-
let count) and type of therapy used (negative trials
tended to use only FFP and platelets [379–381, 384].
Initial coagulation resuscitation
Recommendation 24 In the initial management of pa-
tients with expected massive haemorrhage, we rec-
ommend one of the two following strategies:
� Plasma (FFP or pathogen-inactivated plasma) in a
plasma–RBC ratio of at least 1:2 as needed. (Grade
1B)
� Fibrinogen concentrate and RBC according to Hb
level. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
We define “initial resuscitation” as the period between
arrival in the emergency department and availability
of results from coagulation monitoring (coagulation
screen, fibrinogen level and/or viscoelastic monitoring
and platelet count). There are still conflicting opin-
ions about use of plasma as the initial strategy to
support coagulation, and several authors, mainly in
Europe, strongly disagree with the initial transfusion
of patients based on an empirical ratio rather than
guided by concurrent laboratory data (goal-directed
therapy) [388]. In the absence of rapid point-of-care
coagulation testing to facilitate goal-directed therapy,
initial treatment with blood components in a fixed ra-
tio may constitute a reasonable approach. If concurrent
coagulation results are available, they should be used to
guide therapy.
In May 2005, based on reports from the ongoing con-
flict in Iraq, an international expert conference on
massive transfusion hosted by the US Army’s Institute of
Surgical Research introduced a new concept for the re-
suscitation of patients with massive bleeding and recom-
mended the immediate administration of coagulation
components with a 1:1:1 ratio for RBC, plasma and
platelets [389–391] until laboratory measurements to
adjust therapy were available. In the following few years
retrospective evidence from both military and civilian
practice suggested improved outcomes in patients with
massive bleeding after the adoption of a massive transfu-
sion protocol, including the early administration of high-
dose plasma therapy [392]. Several subsequent studies
focused on this strategy to determine whether standard
doses of plasma and platelets in a fixed ratio relative to
RBC were able to improve survival. Notwithstanding a
large number of studies, the evidence with respect to the
use of high ratios shows conflicting results. Although
many authors suggested that early and aggressive plasma
transfusion may reduce mortality [393], the optimal
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 21 of 55
 FFP:RBC and platelet:RBC ratio was controversial because
of the possible survival bias that flaws most studies
[394, 395]. Survival bias is the bias resulting from the fact
that surviving patients are more likely to receive more
plasma and platelets compared with non-survivors,
because they live long enough to receive those blood
products. A prospective multicentre study that included a
large population of patients undergoing massive transfu-
sion showed that high FFP:RBC and platelet:RBC ratios
are associated with a survival benefit, also when time-
dependency is accounted for [225], however other authors
have come to opposite conclusions [396]. Khan et al. were
unable to confirm significant increases in procoagulant
factor levels or consistent correction of any measure
of clot function when FFP was delivered during the
acute phase of ongoing bleeding [396]. The recent Prag-
matic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios
(PROPPR) randomised clinical trial in 680 trauma patients
who were suspected to sustain or had experienced massive
blood loss [397, 398] reported that there was no difference
in overall survival between early administration of plasma,
platelets and RBC in a 1:1:1 ratio (FFP:platelets: RBC)
compared to 1:1:2. However more patients in the 1:1:1
group achieved “anatomic” haemostasis and fewer experi-
enced death due to exsanguination by 24 h. The early use
of platelets and high level of FFP use in the 1:1:1 group
was not associated with a significantly increased rate of
complications. The early administration of platelets as
described in Recommendation 29 is important, however
from a practical standpoint platelets may not be readily
available during the initial resuscitation period de-
scribed here.
As with all products derived from human blood, the
complications associated with FFP treatment include cir-
culatory overload, ABO incompatibility, transmission of
infectious diseases (including prion diseases) and mild
allergic reactions. Transfusion-related acute lung injury
(TRALI) [399, 400] is a severe adverse effect associated
with the presence of leucocyte antibodies in transfused
plasma. The risk of TRALI has been greatly reduced by
avoiding the use of plasma from women with a history
of pregnancy [401]. Transmission of infectious diseases
can be minimised by the use of pathogen-inactivated
plasma (industrial purified plasma).
Further controversy concerns the use of plasma to cor-
rect the decreased fibrinogen levels associated with
haemorrhagic shock. Haemostasis is critically dependent
on fibrinogen as a substrate for clot formation and the
ligand for platelet aggregation. Fibrinogen is the single
coagulation factor that is affected more and earlier in as-
sociation with trauma-induced coagulopathy. Many bleed-
ing trauma patients with trauma-induced coagulopathy
present with a fibrinogen depletion, below levels currently
recommended for therapeutic supplementation. Recently
Schlimp et al. [159] demonstrated that levels of fibrinogen
lower than 1.5 g/l are detected in as many as 73 % of pa-
tients with an admission Hb lower than 100 g/l and in
63 % of those with a BE lower than -6. Moreover, Rourke
et al. [402] found low fibrinogen in 41 % of the patients
who were hypotensive on admission. In this study,
hypotension, increasing shock severity and a high degree
of injury (ISS ≥25), were all associated with a reduction in
fibrinogen levels. Fibrinogen depletion is associated with
poor outcomes and survival improves with administered
fibrinogen [403]. Fibrinogen is by far the coagulation pro-
tein with the highest plasma concentration. One litre of
plasma contains on average 2 g of fibrinogen. Therefore
for very initial coagulation support, while waiting for the
results of viscoelastic or laboratory tests, it has been
proposed to administer 2 g of fibrinogen to mimic
the expected 1:1 ratio corresponding to the first four
units of RBC and potentially correct hypofibrinogenaemia
if already present [385, 404]. Recent experimental data
show that administration of fibrinogen does not suppress
endogenous fibrinogen synthesis [405].
Administration of plasma to bleeding patients may sta-
bilise fibrinogen levels, avoiding a further decrease, but
plasma transfusions cannot contribute to a significant
increase in fibrinogen level unless very high volumes are
infused [406]. The Activation of Coagulation and Inflam-
mation in Trauma (ACIT) study [396] confirmed these
findings, showing that the percentage of coagulopathic
patients increased with a standard near 1:1 FFP:RBC
transfusion protocol. Similar results were recently re-
ported by Khan et al. [15]. Again, a 1:1 FFP:RBC transfu-
sion
protocol
did
not
alleviate
coagulopathy;
the
percentage of coagulopathic patients even increased the
longer this treatment lasted. Interestingly, in the same
study it was shown that only high-dose fibrinogen ad-
ministration resulted in improved coagulation and a re-
duction in coagulopathy. Furthermore, both FFP and
pathogen-inactivated plasma need to be group-matched,
thawed and warmed prior to administration. Therefore,
unless pre-thawed plasma is available, plasma transfu-
sion cannot be initiated at the same time as universal
RBC transfusion. An average delay of 93 min was re-
ported by Snyder et al. [394] and recently confirmed
by Halmin et al. [407], possibly explaining why a
real-life targeted plasma:RBC ratio is achieved only a
few
hours
after
treatment
initiation.
During
this
interval the fibrinogen level is likely to be lower
than desired.
Antifibrinolytic agents
Recommendation 25 We recommend that tranexamic
acid be administered as early as possible to the
trauma patient who is bleeding or at risk of signifi-
cant haemorrhage at a loading dose of 1 g infused
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 22 of 55
 over 10 min, followed by an i.v. infusion of 1 g over
8 h. (Grade 1A)
We recommend that tranexamic acid be adminis-
tered to the bleeding trauma patient within 3 h after
injury. (Grade 1B)
We suggest that protocols for the management of
bleeding patients consider administration of the first
dose of tranexamic acid en route to the hospital.
(Grade 2C)
Rationale
Tranexamic acid (trans-4-aminomethyl cyclohexane-1-
carboxylic acid; TXA) is a synthetic lysine analogue that
is a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen. TXA is dis-
tributed throughout all tissues, and the plasma half-life
is 120 min [408]. The Clinical Randomisation of Antifibri-
nolytic therapy in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2)
trial [409] assessed the effects of early administration of a
short course of TXA on death, vascular occlusive events
and the receipt of blood product transfusion in trauma pa-
tients who were bleeding or at risk of significant bleeding.
The trial randomised 20,211 adult trauma patients with or
at risk of significant bleeding to either TXA (loading dose
1 g over 10 min followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or
matching placebo within 8 h of injury. The primary out-
come was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury. All
analyses assessed the intention-to-treat population. All-
cause mortality was significantly reduced with TXA by
1.5 %, and the risk of death due to bleeding was signifi-
cantly reduced by 0.8 % and a reduction in bleeding deaths
by one-third, mainly through preventing exsanguination
within the first 24 h [410, 411]. One retrospective study
has suggested that TXA is of no benefit in patients with
viscoelastic hyperfibrinolysis [412] and another found
TXA to reduce multiple organ failure and mortality in se-
verely injured shocked patients [413]. This discrepancy is
probably attributable to methodological limitations.
The risk of precipitated thrombosis with the use of the
lysine analogues TXA and ε-aminocaproic acid had been
of major theoretical concern; however CRASH-2 showed
that the rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was not
altered, while post-traumatic arterial thromboses, espe-
cially myocardial infarction, were lower with the use of
TXA. No adverse events were described with the use of
TXA in CRASH-2, although an increased rate of seizures
has been described in patients receiving a high-dose TXA
undergoing cardiac surgery [414], probably reflecting
the role of fibrinolytic molecules as neurotransmitters.
An unplanned subgroup analysis of the CRASH-2 data
[415] showed that early treatment (≤1 h from injury) sig-
nificantly reduced the risk of death due to bleeding by
2.5 %. Treatment administered between 1 and 3 h also
reduced the risk of death due to bleeding by 1.3 %.
Treatment given after 3 h increased the risk of death
due to bleeding by 1.3 %; therefore we recommend that
TXA not be given more than 3 h following injury. In
order to ensure that TXA is given early, the administra-
tion of TXA at the pre-hospital site of injury needs to be
planned, and we suggest that protocols for the manage-
ment of bleeding patients consider administration of the
first dose of TXA at the site of injury. If TXA is re-
stricted to massive transfusion protocols or only used in
patients clinically judged to be at “high risk”, it is esti-
mated that only 40 % of the potential benefit from this
treatment will be achieved [416]. For the full benefit,
TXA should therefore be administered to all patients
with trauma and significant bleeding. Thus TXA should
be included as part of each institutional “trauma man-
agement protocol” not the “massive blood loss” or
“major haemorrhage” protocols.
The cost-effectiveness of TXA in trauma has been
calculated in three countries [417, 418]: Tanzania as
an example of a low-income country, India as a
middle-income country and the UK as a high-income
country. The cost of TXA administration to 1000 pa-
tients was US$17,483 in Tanzania, US$19,550 in India
and US$30,830 in the UK. The estimated incremental
cost per life year gained of administering TXA was
$48, $66 and $64 in Tanzania, India and the UK
respectively.
ε-aminocaproic acid is also a synthetic lysine analogue
that has a potency tenfold weaker than that of TXA. It is
administered at a loading dose of 150 mg/kg followed by
a continuous infusion of 15 mg/kg/h. The initial elimin-
ation half-life is 60–75 min and must therefore be admin-
istered by continuous infusion in order to maintain
therapeutic drug levels until the bleeding risk has dimin-
ished. This agent is a potential alternative to TXA if TXA
is not available.
Due to concerns about safety [419] the use of aproti-
nin is not advised in bleeding trauma patients, now that
TXA has been shown to be efficacious and safe.
VI. Further resuscitation
Goal-directed therapy
Recommendation 26 We recommend that resuscita-
tion measures be continued using a goal-directed
strategy guided by standard laboratory coagulation
values and/or viscoelastic tests. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Treatment of the bleeding trauma patient is carried out
in a manner that supports the concept that normalisa-
tion of coagulation parameters will improve outcomes,
although there is little evidence for or against this pre-
sumption. During initial resuscitation the state of the co-
agulation system is unknown until test results are
available, therefore blood, blood products and other
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 23 of 55
 treatment is administered using a “best guess” policy,
with local variation as there is no firm evidence for the
best “formula” to follow. The “best guess” policy usually
comprises a specified ratio of RBC, FFP and other treat-
ments, given in “bundles” or “packs”. During further re-
suscitation as more information becomes available from
laboratory or point-of-care tests, the treatments being
administered are modified and management switches to
becoming goal-directed. If no information is available
initially, it is reasonable to presume that the severely in-
jured patient is coagulopathic and initiate “best guess”
treatment. During further resuscitation, a goal-directed
approach is appropriate.
Clinicians need to be aware of the time lag between a
sample being taken and the result being available, but
should not delay treatment while waiting for a result.
Delays in coagulation results represent a much greater
challenge in the absence of point-of-care testing. Lack of
awareness of the dynamic status of the patient’s condi-
tion can lead to treatment that is always “behind the
curve”. To avoid this hazard, patient treatment should
be determined by a combination of the test results and
the clinician’s judgement about how the patient’s coagu-
lation status may have changed since the test was taken.
The specific goals for treatment are explored in the fol-
lowing sections.
Fresh frozen plasma
Recommendation 27 If a plasma-based coagulation
resuscitation strategy is used, we recommend that
plasma (FFP or pathogen-inactivated plasma) be ad-
ministered to maintain PT and APTT <1.5 times the
normal control. (Grade 1C)
We recommend that plasma transfusion be avoided
in patients without substantial bleeding. (Grade 1B)
Rationale
Plasma (thawed FFP or pathogen-inactivated plasma) is
used for many years and throughout the world as a
source of coagulation factors. FFP contains about 70 %
of the normal level of all clotting factors; therefore, it
would seem to be an adequate source for replacement;
however, different preparations show great variability
[256]. We recommend the use of FFP if a plasma-based
coagulation strategy is applied and there is evidence of
coagulation factor deficiency as evidenced by a pro-
longed PT and APTT greater than 1.5 times the normal
control or viscoelastic measures. RCTs that investigate
the utility of this approach have never been conducted,
however this strategy is widely applied. Management of
haemorrhage should be carefully monitored to ensure
that FFP transfusion is appropriate, as it is associated
with significant risks, including circulatory overload,
allergic reactions and TRALI.
A prolongation of “clotting time” or “reaction time”
using viscoelastic tests may also be considered an indica-
tion for the administration of FFP, however the scientific
evidence for this is scarce and a normalisation of fibrino-
gen level as described in recommendation 28 will often
normalise these parameters.
Fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate
Recommendation 28 If a concentrate-based strategy
is used, we recommend treatment with fibrinogen
concentrate or cryoprecipitate if significant bleeding
is accompanied by viscoelastic signs of a functional
fibrinogen deficit or a plasma fibrinogen level of less
than 1.5–2.0 g/l. (Grade 1C)
We suggest an initial fibrinogen supplementation
of 3–4 g. This is equivalent to 15–20 single donor
units of cryoprecipitate or 3–4 g fibrinogen concen-
trate. Repeat doses must be guided by viscoelastic
monitoring and laboratory assessment of fibrinogen
levels. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Fibrinogen is the final component in the coagulation
cascade, the ligand for platelet aggregation and therefore
key to effective coagulation and platelet function [280, 420].
Hypofibrinogenaemia is a common component of com-
plex coagulopathies associated with massive bleeding.
Fibrinogen levels decrease early in many patients who
sustain severe trauma, and low fibrinogen levels are as-
sociated with higher transfusion requirements and in-
creased mortality [421]. Since there are no fibrinogen
reserves outside the plasma, the overall stock of fi-
brinogen within the body amounts to just 10 g in a
80 kg individual, which means that a sharp fall in
fibrinogen
level
cannot
be
quickly
compensated.
Recently, Schlimp et al. [159] demonstrated that fi-
brinogen levels on admission show strong correlation
with rapidly obtainable routine laboratory parameters
such as Hb and base excess. Fibrinogen levels lower
than 1.5 g/l are detected in as many as 73 % of trauma pa-
tients with an admission Hb lower than 10 g/dl and in
63 % of those with a BE lower than -6. Moreover Rourke
et al. [402] observed low fibrinogen levels in 41 % of the
patients who were hypotensive on admission.
Coagulopathic civilian trauma patients had a median
fibrinogen concentration of 0.9 g/l [interquartile ratio
(IQR) 0.5–1.5 g/l] in conjunction with a maximum fi-
brinogen thromboelastometric maximum clot firmness
(MCF) of 6 mm (IQR 0–9 mm) using thromboelasto-
metry, whereas only 2.5 % of healthy volunteers had a
MCF of <7 mm [25]. In trauma patients, a MCF of
7 mm was associated with a fibrinogen level of ap-
proximately
1.5–2.0
g/l
[191].
During
postpartum
haemorrhage, fibrinogen plasma concentration is the

Page 24 of 55
 only coagulation parameter independently associated
with progress towards severe bleeding, with a level <2 g/l
having a positive predictive value of 100 % [422].
An early observational study suggested that fibrinogen
substitution
can
improve
survival
in
combat-related
trauma
[403].
In
the
civilian
setting,
the
use
of
thromboelastometry-guided
fibrinogen
replacement
reduced the exposure to allogeneic blood products
[12, 378, 385]. Retrospective reviews of single-centre
experiences managing massive blood loss in trauma
patients have also suggested a reduced mortality when
compared to expected mortality [378] and increased
30-day survival [423]. However, there are still no ad-
equately powered prospective clinical trials to demon-
strate the risk:benefit of using a source of additional
fibrinogen to manage bleeding trauma patients [424, 425].
It has been suggested that the required fibrinogen dosage
may be estimated based on the results of thromboelasto-
metric monitoring using a simple formula: the administra-
tion of 0.5 g fibrinogen to 80 kg patient may increase the
A10 MCF by 1 mm, the application of which may facilitate
a rapid and predictable increase in plasma fibrinogen to a
target level [426].
The retrospective Military Application of Tranexamic
Acid in Trauma Emergency Resuscitation (MATTERs II)
study of massive military bleeding suggested that cryopre-
cipitate may independently add to the survival benefit of
TXA in the seriously injured patient who requires transfu-
sion [427]. However, cryoprecipitate is often administered
with great delay: in the Prospective, Observational, Multi-
center, Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study
[428] the median time from admission to the first
cryoprecipitate unit was 2.8 h (IQR 1.7–4.5) and in
the ACIT study [396], cryoprecipitate was adminis-
tered only after the first six units of blood. A small
randomised, controlled feasibility trial suggested that
the early administration of cryoprecipitate in trauma
patients is possible [429].
Methodological issues associated with the various
techniques with which to measure fibrinogen concen-
tration remain [430, 431]. The Clauss method is the
most
frequently
recommended
laboratory
method,
however in the presence of artificial colloids such as
HES this method may overestimate the actual fibrinogen
concentration, but remains the gold standard as it measures
fibrinogen function directly [431]. Fibrinogen thromboelas-
tometry is also influenced by Hct [432] and factor XIII
levels [433].
The issue of whether the administration of fibrino-
gen via factor concentrate, cryoprecipitate or FFP is
associated with an increased risk of hospital-acquired
VTE has never been systematically addressed. How-
ever, fibrinogen levels are expected to rise as part of
the acute phase response after major surgery and
trauma [371, 434–436] even without intraoperative
fibrinogen administration. Interestingly, intraopera-
tive
administration
of
fibrinogen
concentrate
in
trauma patients [371] or in patients undergoing car-
diac surgery resulted in higher intra- and early post-
operative fibrinogen levels but fibrinogen levels were
identical on postoperative days 1–7 in patients with
and without intraoperative fibrinogen administration
[436, 437].
The rationale for fibrinogen administration should be
read in conjunction with that for plasma (Recommenda-
tion 27). There is insufficient evidence to support a firm
statement about which of the two strategies is best, or if
even a combined used of both strategies could be of
benefit.
Platelets
Recommendation 29 We recommend that platelets
be administered to maintain a platelet count above
50 × 109/l. (Grade 1C)
We suggest maintenance of a platelet count above
100 × 109/l in patients with ongoing bleeding and/or
TBI. (Grade 2C)
If administered, we suggest an initial dose of four
to eight single platelet units or one aphaeresis pack.
(Grade 2C)
Rationale
Although platelets play a pivotal role in haemostasis
after injury, the effect of platelet transfusion is con-
troversial. Historically, platelet transfusion was based
on critical thresholds of platelet counts. One small
prospective study performed in massively transfused
patients found a platelet count of <100 × 109/l as the
threshold
for
diffuse
bleeding
[438],
and
another
study indicated a platelet count <50 × 109/l or fibrino-
gen <0.5 g/l as the most sensitive laboratory predic-
tors of microvascular bleeding [439]. However, an
older prospective randomised trial evaluating prophy-
lactic platelet transfusion at a ratio to whole blood of
1:2 versus same amount of plasma in patients receiv-
ing ≥12 units of whole blood in 12 h concluded that
platelet administration did not affect microvascular
non-surgical bleeding [440]. Recently, it was shown
that a low or decreasing platelet count in trauma patients
predicts greater mortality [441] and proactive administra-
tion of platelets in patients with massive bleeding due to
ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms increased survival
from 30 to 45 % when the platelet count was >50 × 109/l
as compared to <50 × 109/l and further increased to 69 %
for those with platelet count >100 × 109/l [442].
A lower than normal platelet count also predicts
progression of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and
mortality after TBI [443, 444]. In patients with blunt
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 25 of 55
 TBI, a platelet count of ≤100 × 109/l was found to be
an independent predictor of ICH progression using
repeated head CT, need for neurosurgical intervention
and mortality [445]. However, platelet transfusion did
not influence the outcome in patients with TBI and
moderate
thrombocytopenia
(50–107 × 109/l)
[446].
Accordingly, at this time there is weak scientific evi-
dence to support a particular platelet count threshold
for platelet transfusion in the trauma patient.
The normal therapeutic dose of platelets is one con-
centrate (60–80 × 109 platelets) per 10 kg body weight.
One aphaeresis platelet product, which is approximately
equivalent to six whole blood-derived units, generally
contains approximately 3–4 × 1011 platelets in 150–
450 ml donor plasma [447, 448], depending on local col-
lection practice. The platelet-rich plasma used in the
United States contains fewer platelets than the high-
output platelet concentrate manufactured by apheresis
or pooling five buffy coats mainly used in Europe [449].
This difference should be considered when analysing the
results of studies supporting higher levels of platelet
transfusion. A dose of four to eight platelet units or a
single-donor aphaeresis unit is usually sufficient to pro-
vide haemostasis in a thrombocytopenic, bleeding pa-
tient and should increase the platelet count by 30–50 ×
109/l [375]. However, the usual 60–70 % recovery rate in
peripheral blood may be lower under conditions associ-
ated with increased platelet consumption [449]. The
platelets transfused must be ABO-identical, or at least
ABO-compatible, in order to provide a good yield [448].
Early, up-front administration of platelets in patients
with massive bleeding who are not yet thrombocytope-
nic is controversial. In initial acute loss, the bone mar-
row
and
spleen
variably
release
platelets
into
the
circulation, and therefore their decrease in the periph-
eral blood is delayed. As a result, platelet counts are typ-
ically within normal range (150 × 109/l to 400 × 109/l)
during early traumatic coagulopathy [441, 450–452].
Upon admission, platelet count <150 × 109/l has been re-
ported in only 4 % of trauma patients with an ISS of 5
and in 18 % of patients with ISS >5 [450]. In another
study, less than 5 % of patients arrived in the emergency
room with a platelet count <100 × 109/l [11]. In a large
cohort study over an 8.5 year period, platelet counts de-
creased markedly in the 2 h after hospital admission and
1 × 109/l/h over the next 22 h, suggesting an important
role for the treatment administered [441]. A platelet
count of 50 × 109/l may be anticipated when approxi-
mately two blood volumes have been replaced by fluid
or red cell components [421].
Platelet count on admission, may be predictive of out-
come as documented in some cohorts of massively
transfused trauma patients, in which platelet count was
inversely correlated with injury severity [450], morbidity
[443] and mortality [450, 451, 453]. The association be-
tween lower platelet counts and higher mortality applies
to platelet counts well into the normal range [441, 451],
suggesting that a normal platelet count may be insuffi-
cient for cellular-based haemostasis after severe trauma.
Thus, platelet count alone is a weak indicator of platelet
transfusion need because it ignores platelet function.
There is a growing body of evidence to support a
prominent role for platelet dysfunction in the patho-
physiology of traumatic coagulopathy [454, 455], and
it seems that moderate or even mildly decreased
platelet aggregation is strongly associated with mortality
[214, 456, 457]. Recently, it was found that platelet dys-
function (analysed by thromboelastographic platelet map-
ping) is present after injury even before substantial fluid
or blood products have been administered and continues
during the resuscitation period, suggesting a potential role
for early platelet transfusion in the management of trau-
matic coagulopathy [455]. In a retrospective cohort ana-
lysis of patients with TBI, it was possible to reverse
aspirin-like platelet inhibition in 42 % of patients using
platelet transfusion [458], while in a prospective study per-
formed in patients with isolated TBI, platelet dysfunction
involved the response to collagen and was not improved
by the administration of platelets [459].
There is still no high-quality evidence to support up-
front platelet transfusion or higher doses of platelets given
in pre-defined ratios with other blood products in trauma
patients. Although most of the combat [460, 461] and ci-
vilian studies [462–466], one meta-analysis [467] and one
systematic review [468] that investigated the impact of
platelet transfusion in severe trauma and massive transfu-
sion showed an improved survival rate among patients re-
ceiving high platelet:RBC ratios, such evidence provided
by retrospective and observational studies may be subject
to serious confounding factors, such as survivorship bias
[467] or co-interventions [469]. The timing of platelet
transfusion relative to the initiation of RBC and FFP trans-
fusion was not reported in most of the studies, and there
may be more than one optimal ratio depending on trauma
severity, degree and dynamics of blood loss and previous
fluid administration [467]. Another major drawback to
these observational studies is the wide range of plate-
let:RBC ratios examined, along with reported poor com-
pliance
with
specified
platelet
ratios
during
active
resuscitation [470]. Moreover, the actual number of plate-
lets transfused to each patient is unknown because blood
bank standards estimate only the minimum number of
platelets contained in apheresis and pooled platelet units
[468]. However, recent large prospective cohort studies
showed that a high platelet:RBC ratio was associated with
survival benefit as early as 6 h after admission, suggesting
that survivor bias is unlikely [469, 471]. Interestingly, in
one study the significant protective association between
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 26 of 55
 higher platelet ratios and mortality was concentrated dur-
ing the first 6 h only, in contrast to high plasma ratios
which were protective throughout the first 24 h [471].
Negative [472–474] and partially positive results [475]
with high platelet:RBC ratios were also reported in pa-
tients receiving massive transfusion. Interestingly, pa-
tients with penetrating injuries [472] and females [475]
do not benefit from high platelet:RBC ratios, and no dif-
ference in mortality was observed in patients with non-
massive transfusion receiving higher platelet:RBC ratios
[476]. When a research intervention (before-and-after
introduction of a massive haemorrhage protocol per-
formed with high plasma and platelet:RBC ratios) was
reported, improved survival was shown in three studies
[180, 392, 423], but not in a further study [477].
A small feasibility RCT that included trauma patients
expected to require a massive transfusion compared a
fixed ratio of RBC, FFP and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio to
standard practice (laboratory result-guided transfusion
protocol). Nascimento et al. found an all-cause 28-day
mortality of 32 % in the 1:1:1 group vs. 14 % in the la-
boratory result-guided transfusion protocol group (RR
for fixed ratio 2.27; 95 % CI 0.98 to 9.63, P = 0.053)
[384]. However, this study was not powered to detect a
difference in mortality and the 1:1:1 ratio was achieved
in only 57 % of the fixed ratio group.
One additional reason for the lack of clarity in these
studies is the difficulty in separating the effect of a high
platelet:RBC ratio from the effect of a high plasma:RBC
ratio. Patients receiving a combination of high plasma and
high platelet ratios had an improved 6-h, [463, 464, 469],
24-h [392, 460, 463, 465, 466, 469], 30-day [180, 392, 423,
460, 462, 463, 466], in-hospital [464] and discharge sur-
vival [465]. However, in comparison with increased plas-
ma:RBC ratios, the impact exerted by platelets on survival
was not as strong [472, 475], higher than the impact of
plasma [423] or even absent [473]. In contrast to the civil-
ian studies, US military experience with blood transfusions
demonstrated that higher platelet ratios are independently
associated with increased survival [478] and that the asso-
ciation was stronger for high platelet ratios than for high
FFP ratios [461]. In patients with TBI, transfusion of a
high platelet:RBC ratio and not a high plasma:RBC ratio
was found to be associated with improved survival [479].
Early (within minutes of arrival to a trauma centre)
administration of plasma, platelets and RBC is also
supported by the first RCT designed to evaluate the
benefit of blood product ratios (1:1:1 or 1:1:2 FFP:pla-
telets:RBC) on patient outcome [397]. More patients
in the 1:1:1 group achieved haemostasis and fewer ex-
perienced death as a result of exsanguination at 24 h.
However, a 1:1:1 ratio compared to a 1:1:2 ratio did
not result in significant differences in all-cause mortality
at 24 h or 30 days [397]. Unfortunately, this study did not
independently examine the effects of plasma and platelets
on outcomes.
A theoretical shortcoming of ratio-driven resuscita-
tion is over-transfusion with plasma and platelets,
resulting in no benefit or in added morbidity such as
multiple organ failure [466, 480]. Recent observa-
tions suggest that both early FFP (0–6 h) and de-
layed (7–24 h) platelet transfusions are risk factors
for hypoxaemia and ARDS after 24 h, respectively
[481]. The age of transfused platelets may also play
a role [482]. Although decreased morbidity due to
aggressive use of plasma and platelets has been re-
ported [382, 463, 464], evidence for routine early prophy-
lactic platelet transfusion as part of a massive transfusion
protocol is weak [483].
Calcium
Recommendation 30
We recommend that ionised
calcium levels be monitored and maintained within the
normal range during massive transfusion. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Acute hypocalcaemia is a common complication of
massive transfusion [484]. Citrate added to stored blood
binds calcium and may reduce the serum level of the
ionised fraction [485]. Two observational cohort studies
showed that low ionised calcium levels at admission are
associated with increased mortality as well as an in-
creased need for massive transfusion [486, 487]. Hypo-
calcaemia during the first 24 h can predict mortality and
the need for multiple transfusion better than the lowest
fibrinogen concentrations, acidosis and the lowest plate-
let counts [486]. Measurement of ionised calcium levels
at admission may facilitate the rapid identification of pa-
tients who require massive transfusion, allowing for earl-
ier preparation and administration of appropriate blood
products. However, no data are available to demonstrate
that the prevention of ionised hypocalcaemia reduces
mortality among patients with critical bleeding who re-
quire massive transfusion.
Calcium in the extracellular plasma exists either in a
free ionised state (45 %) or bound to proteins and other
molecules in a biologically inactive state (55 %). The
normal concentration of the ionised form ranges from
1.1 to 1.3 mmol/l and is influenced by the pH; a 0.1 unit
increase in pH decreases the ionised calcium concentra-
tion by approximately 0.05 mmol/l [488]. The availability
of ionised calcium is essential for the timely formation
and stabilisation of fibrin polymerisation sites, and a de-
crease in cytosolic calcium concentration precipitates a
decrease in all platelet-related activities [489]. In addition,
contractility of the heart and systemic vascular resistance
are low at reduced ionised calcium levels. Combining
beneficial cardiovascular and coagulation effects, the level
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 27 of 55
 of ionised calcium concentration should therefore be
maintained within the normal range [489].
Early hypocalcaemia following traumatic injury shows
a significant correlation with the amount of FFP trans-
fused and also with the amount of infused colloids, but
not with crystalloids. Hypocalcaemia is most common
in association with FFP and platelet transfusion be-
cause these products contain high citrate concentra-
tions. Citrate undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism,
and hypocalcaemia is generally transient during stand-
ard transfusion procedures. Citrate metabolism may
be
dramatically
impaired
by
hypoperfusion
states,
hypothermia and in patients with hepatic insufficiency
[489].
Antiplatelet agents
Recommendation 31 We suggest administration of
platelets in patients with substantial bleeding or
intracranial haemorrhage who have been treated with
antiplatelet agents. (Grade 2C)
We suggest the measurement of platelet function
in patients treated or suspected of being treated with
antiplatelet agents. (Grade 2C)
We suggest treatment with platelet concentrates if
platelet dysfunction is documented in a patient with
continued microvascular bleeding. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Conflicting data exist about the effects of antiplatelet
agents (APA), mainly aspirin and clopidogrel, on trau-
matic bleeding. Data from non-elective orthopaedic
procedures show either increased perioperative blood
loss in patients taking APA prior to surgery [490, 491]
or no effect [492–494]. The need for blood transfusion
in orthopaedic patients on APA is also controversial,
being either higher [491, 495, 496] or similar to con-
trol patients [492–494, 497, 498]. Pre-injury use of
APA did not affect morbidity and mortality in retro-
spective studies of patients with pelvic fractures [495]
or general trauma without brain injury [499], but had
conflicting effects on early hip fracture surgery out-
come [491, 494, 497, 498, 500]. Aspirin was associated
with a significantly increased need for postoperative
blood transfusion (adjusted OR 1.8; 95 % CI 1.04 to
3.3) and significantly higher all-cause mortality (ad-
justed HR 2.35; 95 % CI 1.23 to 4.49) during 1 year
after hip fracture surgery in one observational cohort
study
[491].
However,
retrospective
studies
have
shown that postoperative outcomes of hip fracture
surgery in patients on clopidogrel were similar to
those not taking the agent at the time of surgery per-
formed within 48 h [497, 498, 500, 501], except for a
significantly longer hospital stays in some studies
[494, 498].
The role of pre-injury APA in the genesis of ICH in
patients with blunt head trauma is controversial as well
[502–506]. One observational study found a fivefold in-
crease in traumatic ICH in patients on APA [502]. Even
mild head trauma (GCS 14–15) while on APA was associ-
ated with a high incidence of ICH [507–509], mandating a
longer period of observation for delayed ICH in this group
of patients [510, 511]. Others failed to demonstrate the as-
sociation [503, 504, 506], however, pre-injury use of clopi-
dogrel was significantly associated with ICH following
minor trauma (OR 16.7; 95 % CI 1.71 to 162.7) [512].
The relationship between outcome and pre-injury
APA in the setting of ICH is conflicting in both the
trauma [504, 508, 513–518] and stroke literature [519–
522]. In the setting of non-trauma-related ICH, a recent
retrospective cohort analysis indicated that pre-injury
APA administration was an independent risk factor for
death within 7 days (OR 5.12; P = 0.006) and within
90 days (HR 1.87; P = 0.006) [522], but a systematic re-
view, which did not include the latter study, showed
that pre-ICH APA users experienced only modestly
increased mortality (OR 1.27; 95 % CI 1.10 to 1.47)
and little or no increase in poor clinical functional
outcome (OR 1.10; 95 % CI 0.93 to 1.29) [523]. In
patients with blunt head trauma, a meta-analysis of
case-control and cohort studies showed only a slight
and non-significant increased risk of death in patients
who were taking pre-injury APA [524]. However, the
effect of pre-injury APA on traumatic ICH is still
controversial as more recent studies found both an
association of worsening of the lesion [525, 526] and
need for neurosurgical intervention [526] or no influ-
ence on survival and need for neurosurgical interven-
tion [527].
Few studies have directly focused on outcome associ-
ated with a specific APA. Those that have analysed the
use of clopidogrel prior to both spontaneous and trau-
matic ICH reported worsened outcome compared to
controls:
increased
mortality
[518,
520],
increased
morbidity [528], including progression of the lesion
[503, 508, 520, 529], need for neurosurgical interven-
tion [503, 529] and an increase in disposition to a
long-term facility [518, 520]. Pre-injury aspirin did
not affect outcomes in mild to moderate head injury
[504, 530] or mortality [458] in observational studies
but increased haemorrhage volume and mortality in
one RCT [531]. Surprisingly, reduced platelet activity
has been shown in patients with ICH in the absence
of known aspirin use [458, 532] and this was associ-
ated with more ICH volume growth and worse 3-
month outcome [533].
Early platelet dysfunction was also prevalent after se-
vere TBI in the absence of APA treatment [534] and im-
paired platelet function (with or without the use of APA)
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 28 of 55
 demonstrated using an aspirin detection assay was asso-
ciated with increased haematoma volume [516]. However,
greater platelet inhibition was identified among patients
taking a combination of APAs compared to those on sin-
gle agents [532].
Lower platelet counts add additional risks. TBI pa-
tients on pre-hospital APA with a platelet count of
135 × 109/l or less were 12.4 times (95 % CI 7.1 to
18.4) more likely to experience progression of initial
ICH on repeated head CT scan; those with a platelet
count of 95 × 109/l or less were 31.5 times (95 % CI
19.7 to 96.2) more likely to require neurosurgical
intervention [444].
These findings, coupled with the fact that 20–30 % of
patients are non-responders to aspirin, clopidogrel or
both agents [535], suggest that reliable measures of
platelet function would be useful in the setting of the
bleeding trauma patient to guide clinicians in the use of
platelet transfusion or other reversal agents. Patients
with occult platelet dysfunction who would benefit from
platelet transfusion could be identified [536] or unneces-
sary platelet transfusion avoided [458].
Currently, there is no agreement on the optimal assay
for platelet function, and controversy exists as to
whether ICH in the setting of APA use warrants platelet
transfusion. Transfusion of platelets has a low grade rec-
ommendation in the guidelines on ICH management in
patients on APA [537] and is currently indicated for pa-
tients on clopidogrel and traumatic haemorrhage, al-
though its clinical utility remains to be established [538].
Retrospective studies have failed to show an outcome
benefit from platelet transfusion in patients on APA with
spontaneous [521, 522, 539] or traumatic [514, 540, 541]
ICH. A meta-analysis that included six small studies on
the impact of platelet transfusion on survival in patients
with pre-injury APA who experienced ICH, either spon-
taneous or traumatic, found no clear benefit [542]. Simi-
larly, a systematic review of five retrospective registry
studies on traumatic ICH provides inadequate evidence
to support the routine use of platelet transfusion in pa-
tients with pre-injury antiplatelet use [505]. However,
the timing of platelet administration was not optimal in
some studies [533, 539], and a small prospective study
showed that early platelet transfusion, within 12 h of
symptom onset, improved platelet activity and was asso-
ciated with smaller final haemorrhage size and more in-
dependence at 3 months [543].
An in vitro study performed in healthy volunteers tak-
ing aspirin and clopidogrel showed that an equivalent of
two to three platelet pools could normalise platelet func-
tion in patients treated with APA [544]. However, fur-
ther studies on the effect of platelet transfusion on
platelet function in patients with traumatic ICH have
been conflicting and inconclusive [458, 459, 545–547].
Platelet transfusion restored platelet function measured
using an antiplatelet detection assay in patients on as-
pirin in some studies [458, 545], but not in others [546]
and not in patients on clopidogrel [545]. In contrast, the
effect of ex vivo platelet supplementation on platelet ag-
gregation in blood samples from patients treated with
aspirin, clopidogrel or ticagrelor showed improved ag-
gregation independent of antiplatelet therapy [547].
However, while the aspirin effect was completely re-
versed, the recovery of ADP-dependent aggregation was
limited even with a high dose of platelets (up to five
apheresis units). One small prospective trial also showed
that platelet transfusion improved aspirin-induced but
not collagen trauma-induced platelet dysfunction mea-
sured using multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) in
patients with isolated TBI [459]. The outcome benefit of
platelet transfusion in patients with non-traumatic ICH
on aspirin is supported by a recent RCT [531]. These di-
vergent results could be explained by the different
amounts of platelets transfused, from one pack [546] to
three to five units of apheresis platelets [458]. Another
explanation for the observation that platelet transfusion
shows no obvious benefit is that the inhibitory effect of
the APA is not normalised due to recent ingestion of
APA, which may also inactivate transfused platelets
[543]. The results of a multicentre RCT on platelet
transfusion in patients with APA-associated ICH are
awaited [548].
The suggested dose for normalisation of platelet ac-
tivity in healthy volunteers given aspirin alone or a
combination of aspirin and clopidogrel was five and
ten to 15 platelet units, respectively [544]. Successful
perioperative management of patients on aspirin and
clopidogrel requiring urgent surgery using two apher-
esis platelet units was recently reported [549]. Given
that an active metabolite of clopidogrel persists after
cessation of the medication and that the half-life of
transfused platelets is short, recurring platelet transfu-
sion may be justified [550].
Besides platelet transfusion, current potential anti-
platelet reversal therapies include desmopressin and re-
combinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa)
[538]. The rationale for treatment with desmopressin in
patients treated with aspirin alone is included as part of
Recommendation 32 (see next section). In healthy vol-
unteers, rFVIIa reversed the inhibitory effects of aspirin
and clopidogrel [551]. Interestingly, the effective dose
was lower than the dose used in haemophilia patients
[552]. In addition, TXA was shown to partially improve
platelet function in patients treated with dual antiplatelet
therapy as measured using MEA [553]. Potential ef-
fectiveness in improving haemostasis in trauma pa-
tients receiving APA was also shown for fibrinogen
concentrate [554].

 Desmopressin
Recommendation 32 We suggest that desmopressin
(0.3 μg/kg) be administered in patients treated with
platelet-inhibiting drugs or with von Willebrand
disease. (Grade 2C)
We do not suggest that desmopressin be used
routinely in the bleeding trauma patient. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
Desmopressin (DDAVP; 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vaso-
pressin)
enhances
platelet
adherence
and
platelet
aggregate growth on human artery subendothelia and
is the first choice in the treatment of bleeding in pa-
tients with von Willebrand disease, a disorder which
occurs in roughly 1 in 100 patients [555, 556]. Two
meta-analyses in patients not diagnosed with von
Willebrand disease [557, 558] were able to demon-
strate either a trend towards a reduced perioperative
blood loss [557] or a small significant reduction in
blood transfusion requirements [-0.29 (-0.52 to -0.06)
units per patient] [558]. Patients with impaired plate-
let function as assessed by a platelet function analyser
[559] or whole blood multiple electrode aggregometer
[560] may benefit from desmopressin therapy. Con-
cerns regarding possible thromboembolic complica-
tions [561] were not confirmed in the last meta-
analysis from 2008 [558].
Although desmopressin has been shown to improve
platelet function in volunteers on aspirin [562] and clo-
pidogrel [563] and perioperatively in patients with mild
inherited platelet defects [564], the use of desmopressin
for acquired bleeding disorders is not supported by
sound clinical evidence. One older meta-analysis sug-
gested a benefit of desmopressin in patients taking as-
pirin [565], and desmopressin has been recommended in
patients taking platelet inhibitors who suffer an ICH
[538, 566]. The standard dose is 0.3 μg/kg diluted in
50 ml saline and infused over 30 min [564]. Recently,
two small prospective studies have shown that desmo-
pressin can improve platelet function in patients with
ICH who have received aspirin [567] or not [568] prior
to the event. Identification of impaired platelet function
with a platelet function analyser PFA-100 [559] or whole
blood MEA [560] might be helpful in the identification
of patients who could benefit from desmopressin ther-
apy. The combined effect of platelet concentrates and
subsequent administration of desmopressin has also
been advocated to enhance the recovery of normal plate-
let function [569], however, desmopressin and platelet
administration was not associated with either a de-
creased risk of early radiographic haemorrhage progres-
sion (OR 1.40, 95 % CI 0.80 to 2.40; P = 0.2) or mortality
(OR 1.50, 95 % CI 0.60 to 4.30; P = 0.4) in patients with
traumatic ICH [570].
Desmopressin appears to be efficacious in the mitiga-
tion of platelet inhibition by adenosine diphosphate re-
ceptor inhibitors such as clopidogrel [571] and ticagrelor
[572]. Equivalent data for prasugrel appear not to have
been published.
There are only a few studies on the use of desmopressin
in general trauma, ICH or TBI [538]. However, in patients
with ICH and reduced platelet activity and/or prior aspirin
use, desmopressin (0.4 µg/kg) shortened platelet function
analyser closure time and increased von Willebrand factor
levels [568]. Conversely, in a recent retrospective study on
early ICH progression in 401 patients with TBI (54 on
platelet inhibitors prior to trauma) the co-administration
of desmopressin (0.3 µg/kg) with platelet transfusion was
found inefficacious in terms of slowing the early ICH pro-
gression [570]. Nevertheless, desmopressin has been rec-
ommended in patients treated with platelet inhibitors with
intracerebral bleeding [538, 566] and in trauma patients
with von Willebrand disease [573]. Interestingly, desmo-
pressin
prevents
the
development
of
hypothermia-
induced impairment of primary haemostasis [574] and sig-
nificantly
increases
platelet
aggregation
during
hypothermia and acidosis [575].
Prothrombin complex concentrate
Recommendation 33 We recommend the early use of
prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) for the
emergency reversal of vitamin K-dependent oral anti-
coagulants. (Grade 1A)
We suggest the administration of PCC to mitigate
life-threatening post-traumatic bleeding in patients
treated with novel oral anticoagulants. (Grade 2C)
Provided that fibrinogen levels are normal, we sug-
gest that PCC or plasma be administered in the bleed-
ing patient based on evidence of delayed coagulation
initiation using viscoelastic monitoring. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
The use of PCC has been shown to be superior to FFP in
the rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonists [576–578] with
evidence of less haematoma formation in those with head
injury [579, 580]. It is therefore the agent of choice to re-
verse the effects of vitamin K antagonists [581].
No universally adopted reversal strategies for the
non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC)
have been established, but despite limited clinical evi-
dence, though data from animal studies exist [582],
PCC has been used anecdotally to reverse the effect
of NOAC [582–586]. The specific approach and ra-
tionale in patients on new oral anticoagulants are
outlined in the recommendations on novel anticoagu-
lants (R34-35).
Thromboelastometry appears to be a useful tool to guide
PCC therapy in patients with traumatic coagulopathy
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 30 of 55
 [12, 587–591]. With an ageing population, more trauma pa-
tients are likely to have been pre-treated with vitamin K an-
tagonists or oral direct inhibitors, therefore every trauma
unit should have an established management policy for
these patients [592, 593].
Because there are variations in the composition of
PCC, the dosage should be determined according to the
instructions of the individual manufacturer [594, 595]. A
retrospective
study
that
included
42
patients
with
warfarin-associated TBI and an INR ≥1.5 examined the
effect of different doses of PCC. A dose of 35 IU/kg
PCC compared to 25 IU/kg was associated with a higher
percentage of INR reversal and a more rapid time (me-
dian time to INR reversal 6.9 h in the low-dose group
and 1.9 h in the moderate-dose group) to INR normal-
isation in patients with TBI. In contrast, a RCT in pa-
tients with vitamin K antagonist-associated ICH showed
no difference between two doses (25 IU/kg vs. 40 IU/kg)
of four-factor PCC in terms of achieving target INR
<1.5, however a lower INR was achieved with the higher
dosage [596, 597].
The use of PCC is associated with an increased risk of
both venous and arterial thrombosis during the recovery
period, therefore the risk of thrombotic complications
due to treatment with PCC should be weighed against
the need for rapid and effective correction of coagulopa-
thy [598–603]. Beyond emergency reversal of vitamin K
antagonists, safety data on PCC used in trauma patients
are scarce [604]. Activated PCC (aPCC) may be associ-
ated with a higher risk of thrombosis compared to non-
activated PCC according to some expert opinion [605]
due to presence of activated factor IX, because the
thrombogenic trigger associated with PCC infusion oc-
curs at the level of factor X activation as a part of aPCC
[593]. In a study evaluating two doses of four-factor
PCC in patients with vitamin K antagonist-associated
ICH no safety concerns were raised regarding the 40 IU/
kg dose [597]. Nevertheless, PCC administration to major
trauma patients resulted in an increased endogenous
thrombin potential over 3 days which was not reflected in
standard laboratory coagulation tests [371]. Therefore,
thromboprophylaxis as early as possible after control of
bleeding has been achieved is prudent in patients who
have received PCC.
Direct oral anticoagulants – factor Xa inhibitors
Recommendation 34 We suggest the measurement of
plasma levels of oral anti-factor Xa agents such as
rivaroxaban,
apixaban
or
edoxaban
in
patients
treated or suspected of being treated with one of
these agents. (Grade 2C)
If measurement is not possible or available, we sug-
gest that advice from an expert haematologist be
sought. (Grade 2C)
If bleeding is life-threatening, we suggest treatment
with TXA 15 mg/kg (or 1 g) intravenously and high-
dose (25-50 U/kg) PCC/aPCC until specific antidotes
are available. (Grade 2C)
Direct oral anticoagulants – thrombin inhibitors
Recommendation 35 We suggest the measurement
of dabigatran plasma levels in patients treated or
suspected
of
being
treated
with
dabigatran.
(Grade 2C)
If measurement is not possible or available, we sug-
gest thrombin time and APTT to allow a qualitative
estimation of the presence of dabigatran. (Grade 2C)
If
bleeding
is
life-threatening,
we
recommend
treatment with idarucizumab (5 g intravenously)
(Grade 1B), or, if unavailable, we suggest treatment
with high-dose (25–50 U/kg) PCC/aPCC, in both
cases combined with TXA 15 mg/kg (or 1 g) intraven-
ously. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
In recent years, direct oral anticoagulants for the pre-
vention of VTE, prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation,
acute coronary syndrome and treatment of pulmonary
embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) have
been developed. The primary modes of action by these
novel drugs are direct factor Xa inhibition (rivaroxaban,
apixaban and edoxaban) or thrombin inhibition (dabiga-
tran) [606]. Physicians are therefore increasingly likely to
be confronted with trauma patients who have been
treated with one of these drugs [607], which exert an ef-
fect on both coagulation tests [607, 608] and haemosta-
sis [609].
No published clinical studies and very little clinical ex-
perience in trauma patients who have been treated with
one of these drugs exist [608, 610]. However, animal
studies and ex vivo human studies on the effect of three-
and four-factor PCC/aPCC and recombinant factor VIIa
have been published. In summary, although not com-
pletely consistent, laboratory coagulation tests, parame-
ters of viscoelastic tests and of thrombin generation
were
(nearly)
normalised
with
high-dose
treatment
[611–619]. Whether this effect results in improved
haemostasis with reduced bleeding may depend on the
level of the anticoagulants; no effect on bleeding was
seen at a rivaroxaban plasma concentration of approxi-
mately 500–700 ng/ml in rabbits [609] while a concomi-
tant reduction in bleeding was found at a dabigatran
plasma concentration of 65 ng/ml in mice [620]. Also in
rats, progressive doses of four-factor PCC were able to
reverse the bleeding volume [621]. At a rivaroxaban
plasma concentration of approximately 150 ng/ml bleed-
ing volume was normalised with a PCC dose of 25 U/kg,
at a rivaroxaban plasma concentration of approximately
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 31 of 55
 280 ng/ml normalisation of bleeding required a PCC
dose of 50 U/kg and at a rivaroxaban plasma concentra-
tion of approximately 480 ng/ml even the administration
of 100 U/kg PCC was unable to reduce the elevated
blood loss [621].
Measurement of the plasma concentration of these an-
ticoagulants is recommended in order to ascertain
whether and to what extent these agents might exert
and influence the coagulation system [622]. There are
no threshold values above which a significant effect is to
be expected, since the effect is gradual with increasing
plasma concentration [621]. However, low concentra-
tions (<30 ng/ml) may be regarded as having a very mild
and likely a clinically insignificant effect [622]. High
levels (>200–300 ng/ml) are likely to seriously com-
promise coagulation, and fatal exsanguinations have
been described.
If factor Xa antagonist treatment is known or sus-
pected, anti-factor Xa activity can be measured using a
substrate-specific anti-factor Xa test. If unavailable, anti-
factor Xa activity tests for low molecular weight hep-
arin (LMWH) can be used to gather qualitative informa-
tion about the presence of a factor Xa antagonist. If
factor IIa antagonist treatment is known or suspected,
dabigatran-calibrated thrombin time can be measured.
Factor Xa and IIa inhibitors have an effect on viscoelas-
tic tests [623], however these tests provide an overall
snapshot of the coagulation state, and the observed
changes cannot be used to estimate the specific effect of
Xa/IIa inhibition on coagulation. If measurement is not
possible or available, thrombin time and APTT can be
used to qualitatively assess the presence of dabigatran. If
anti-factor Xa activity is detected, high-dose (25–50 U/
kg) PCC/aPCC treatment may be initiated. We suggest
an initial dose of 25 U/kg, repeated if necessary, as a
cautious approach given the possible thrombotic poten-
tial of PCC/aPCC products [599]. In the presence of
anti-FIIa activity due to dabigatran, treatment with dabiga-
tran antidote idarucizumab (5 g i.v.) should be initiated
[624, 625], or if unavailable, preoperative haemodialysis con-
sidered [626, 627]. The co-administration of TXA is gener-
ally indicated in trauma patients (see Recommendation 25).
In addition, in patients undergoing hip replacement
surgery with rivaroxaban thromboembolic prophylaxis,
the use of TXA reduced postoperative blood loss
[628]. The use of recombinant factor VIIa has been
described, but cannot be recommended as a first-line
treatment. The involvement of a haematologist with
expertise in coagulation should be considered.
As of late 2015 idarucizumab, the antidote to dabiga-
tran, had received marketing approval from the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European
Medicines Agency (EMA). Specific antidotes against Xa
antagonists are in development, including andexanet alfa,
a specific factor Xa inhibitor-reversing agent [629], how-
ever, these are not yet approved for clinical use [630, 631].
Recombinant activated coagulation factor VII
Recommendation 36 We suggest that the off-label
use of rFVIIa be considered only if major bleeding
and traumatic coagulopathy persist despite all other
attempts to control bleeding and best-practice use of
conventional haemostatic measures. (Grade 2C)
Rationale
rFVIIa should be considered only if first-line treatment
with a combination of surgical approaches, best-practice
use of blood products, (RBC, platelets, FFP, and cryopre-
cipitate/fibrinogen resulting in a Hct above 24 %, plate-
lets above 50 × 109/l and fibrinogen above 1.5–2.0 g/l),
the use of antifibrinolytics and correction of severe acid-
osis, severe hypothermia and hypocalcaemia fail to con-
trol bleeding.
rFVIIa acts on the patient’s own coagulation system
and adequate numbers of platelets and fibrinogen levels
are needed to support activity [632, 633]. pH and body
temperature should be restored as near to physiological
levels as possible, since even small reductions in pH
and temperature result in slower coagulation enzyme
kinetics [299, 300, 634]. Predictors of a poor response
to rFVIIa are a pH <7.2 (P < 0.0001), a platelet count
<100 × 109/l (P = 0.046), and blood pressure ≤90 mmHg
(P < 0.0001) [635]. In one study administration of
rFVIIa to patients with a pH of <6.9 appeared futile
[636]. In another study from the The Australian and
New Zealand Haemostasis Registry a pH <7.1 prior to
rVFIIa administration was independently associated with
an increased 28-day mortality [637]. Moreover, hypocal-
caemia is frequently present in severely injured patients
[638], therefore monitoring of ionised calcium is neces-
sary, and administration of intravenous calcium may be
required [639].
Despite numerous case studies and series reporting
that treatment with rFVIIa can be beneficial in the treat-
ment of bleeding following trauma, there are few high-
quality studies [640–643]. A multicentre, randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined the ef-
ficacy of rFVIIa in patients with blunt (n = 143) or pene-
trating (n = 134) trauma [644] and showed that patients
with blunt trauma who survived for more than 48 h
assigned to receive rFVIIa 200 μg/kg after they had re-
ceived eight units of RBC and a second and third dose
of 100 μg/mg 1 and 3 h later had a reduction in RBC
transfusion requirements and the need for massive
transfusions (>20 units of RBC) compared to placebo.
They also had a significantly reduced incidence of
ARDS. In contrast, there were no significant effects in
the penetrating trauma patients in this study, although
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 32 of 55
 trends towards reduced RBC requirements and fewer
massive transfusions were observed. Similar results and
trends were observed in other retrospective studies and
case reports [645–647]. A further randomised clinical
trial [648] aimed to evaluate rFVIIa as an adjunct to direct
haemostasis in major trauma patients who bled four to
eight RBC units within 12 h of injury and were still bleed-
ing despite strict damage control resuscitation and opera-
tive management. Patients were treated with rFVIIa
(200 μg/kg initially; 100 μg/kg at 1 and 3 h) or placebo.
The trial was terminated early (n = 573) due to difficulty in
consenting and enrolling sicker patients and resulting low
mortality rates that prompted a futility analysis. Throm-
botic adverse events were similar across study cohorts.
A recent study from the German trauma registry com-
paring two matched groups of 100 patients each with or
without early administration of rFVIIa found no difference
in mortality or transfusion requirements between groups,
however, there was an increased incidence of multiple
organ failure in the rFVIIa group (82 % vs. 62 %) [649]. In
a retrospective study of thromboelastographic-guided
haemostatic therapy in 38 abdominal trauma patients, 20
patients who received rFVIIa (average dose 52.3μg/kg) ex-
perienced decreased R time and were transfused with
RBC, platelets and FFP significantly less compared to 18
patients not given rFVIIa [650].
In contrast, the use of rFVIIa in isolated head injury
was found to be harmful in a case-controlled study of
patients with traumatic ICH, with the risk of death
appearing to increase with administration regardless of
the severity of injury [651]. No reliable evidence from
RCTs exists to support the effectiveness of haemostatic
drugs in reducing mortality or disability in patients with
TBI [652]. In warfarin-treated patients with TBI the use
of recombinant factor VIIa did not improve mortality or
reduce the use of plasma [653]. As there is no evidence
that would lead a clinician to consider rFVIIa in ICH
caused by isolated head trauma, the previous negative
recommendation – “We do not suggest the use of
rFVIIa
in
patients
with
intracerebral
haemorrhage
caused by isolated head trauma” has been removed from
this version of the guideline, as this conclusion is self-
evident.
If used, the dose(s) of rFVIIa is still under debate.
Whereas the dosing administered in the published RCTs
in trauma patients was recommended by a group of
European experts [654], Israeli guidelines based on find-
ings from a case series of 36 patients who received
rFVIIa on a compassionate-use basis [641] proposed an
initial dose of 120 μg/kg (between 100 and 140 μg/kg)
and (if required) a second and third dose. Pharmacoki-
netic modelling techniques have shown that the dose
regimen for rFVIIa treatment used in the RCT described
above is capable of providing adequate plasma levels of
drug to support haemostasis [655]. Bain et al. compared
their institutional rFVIIa low-dose protocol to previous
practice using higher doses of rFVIIa. The total dose of
rFVIIa in pre-protocol patients (n = 80) was significantly
higher (62 μg/kg) compared to 48 μg/kg in post-protocol
patients (n = 117) but no differences were found in out-
come measures such as mortality, blood product use or
adverse events [656].
In a recent prospective non-randomised trial evaluat-
ing 87 patients with isolated TBI and coagulopathy at
admission, in addition to blood products 38 patients
were administered a single dose of rFVIIa (20 μg/kg)
intravenously. Not surprisingly, the improvement in INR
as a primary outcome measure was significantly greater
in the rFVIIa group, but hospital mortality was similar
in both groups [657].
If rFVIIa is administered and if possible, the patient
and/or next of kin should be informed that rFVIIa is
being used outside the currently approved indications
(off-label use), especially since the use of rFVIIa may
increase
the
risk
of
thromboembolic
complications
[658]. A meta-analysis showed a higher risk of arterial
thromboembolic adverse events (5.6 % in patients re-
ceiving rFVIIa versus 3.0 % in placebo-treated patients)
among over 2000 patients enrolled in placebo-controlled
trials outside currently approved indications in various
clinical settings [659]. In trauma patients, rFVIIa use
was not associated with an increased risk of thrombo-
embolic complications [660]. In a recent retrospective
single-centre cohort study that analysed 152 surgical and
trauma patients that received different doses of off-label
rFVIIa,
the
overall
incidence
of
thromboembolic
events was 12.5 % without any difference between
low (30 μg/kg) and high dose (100 μg/kg) rFVIIa. A
higher incidence of thromboembolic events (approxi-
mately 21 %) was found in cardiothoracic surgery and
penetrating trauma [661].
Thromboprophylaxis
Recommendation 37 We recommend pharmacological
thromboprophylaxis within 24 h after bleeding has
been controlled. (Grade 1B)
We recommend early mechanical thromboprophy-
laxis with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC)
(Grade 1C) and suggest early mechanical thrombopro-
phylaxis with anti-embolic stockings. (Grade 2C)
We do not recommend the routine use of inferior
vena cava filters as thromboprophylaxis. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
The risk of hospital-acquired VTE is high after mul-
tiple trauma, exceeding 50 %; PE is the third leading
cause of death in those who survive beyond the
third
day
[662].
There
are
few
RCTs
that
have
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 33 of 55
 investigated thromboprophylaxis in trauma patients,
and the use of anti-embolic stockings has never been
evaluated in this group. A meta-analysis was unable
to show any reduction in the rate of DVT with IPC
[663], however mechanical methods are widely used
because of the low bleeding risk.
A systematic review and meta-analysis [664] showed
that any type of heparin thromboprophylaxis decreases
DVT and PE in medical-surgical critically ill patients,
and LMWH compared with twice daily unfractionated
heparin (UFH) decreases both the overall rate and symp-
tomatic rate of PE. Major bleeding and mortality rates
did not appear to be significantly influenced by heparin
thromboprophylaxis in the ICU setting. Another study
of 289 patients who developed VTE during or after a
critical care stay showed that thromboprophylaxis failure
was more likely with elevated body mass index, a per-
sonal or family history of VTE and those administered
vasopressors [665].
Side effects associated with the use of heparin in-
clude heparin-induced thrombocytopenic thrombosis.
This effect is seen more frequently with UFH than
LMWH. The severity of trauma has been associated
with the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,
therefore the greater the risk, the greater the import-
ance of monitoring platelet counts in trauma patients
[666]. In summary, the use of heparin once haemo-
stasis has been achieved is the most efficacious op-
tion for trauma patients. In those with a bleeding
risk, mechanical methods are preferable. Due to the
varied
results
from
trials
comparing
UFH
with
LMWH, we do not recommend one over the other.
Because LMWHs are mainly excreted renally, unlike
UFH, which is excreted via the liver as well, there is
risk of accumulation in patients with renal failure,
therefore dose adjustments and/or monitoring should
be performed with LMWH according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Contraindications to pharmacological thromboprophy-
laxis include patients already receiving full-dose anticoa-
gulation, those with significant thrombocytopenia (platelet
count <50 × 109/l), an untreated inherited or acquired
bleeding disorder, evidence of active bleeding, uncon-
trolled hypertension (blood pressure >230/120), a lumbar
puncture/spinal analgesia expected within the next 12 h
or performed within the last 4 h (24 h if traumatic), proce-
dures with a high bleeding risk or a new haemorrhagic
stroke, although a recent systematic review found
that pharmacological thromboprophylaxis appears to
be safe among patients with TBI and stabilised haem-
orrhagic patterns [667].
The use of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters is com-
mon; however no evidence of added benefit when used in
combination with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis
exists. PE still occur despite the presence of a filter,
and filters have short- and long-term complication
rates, are associated with high cost and often provide
a false sense of security, delaying the use of effective
pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Furthermore, in-
ferior vena cava filters require a second invasive pro-
cedure to remove.
The optimal timing for the initiation of pharmaco-
logical thromboprophylaxis is often difficult to judge.
Data from 175,000 critical care admissions showed
that the risk of mortality was higher in those who
did not receive thromboprophylaxis during the first
24 h [668]. This reflects the concern that those who
bleed have a higher rate of VTE than those who do
not [669].
There is inadequate research on the use of mechan-
ical thromboprophylaxis in critical care. The recent
Clots in Legs or Stockings after Stroke (CLOTS 3)
study was the first large RCT to look at the utility of
IPC in 2876 stroke patients and showed a clear bene-
fit with a reduction in DVT from 12.1 to 8.5 % and
an absolute reduction of 3.6 % (95 % CI 1.4 to 5.8),
with a non-significant reduction in death [670]. While
the population in this study is different from those in
critical care, both populations have similar risk factors
(immobility and acute-phase response), which led us
to upgrade the recommendation for IPC.
VII. Guideline implementation and quality control
Guideline implementation
Recommendation 38 We recommend the local imple-
mentation of evidence-based guidelines for manage-
ment of the bleeding trauma patient. (Grade 1B)
Assessment of bleeding control and outcome
Recommendation 39 We recommend that local clinical
quality and safety management systems include
parameters to assess key measures of
bleeding
control and outcome. (Grade 1C)
Rationale
Evidence to support the effectiveness of patient manage-
ment algorithms in changing clinical care is weak, however
local implementation of a multidisciplinary, evidence-
based treatment algorithm or clinical management guide-
line for the bleeding trauma patient is likely to create
awareness among all involved medical specialities and to
improve mutual understanding. The local treatment algo-
rithm allows, within the framework of the available evi-
dence, flexibility to accommodate local pre-hospital rescue
conditions, locally available diagnostic and therapeutic op-
tions and improves the consistency of care. However, any
guideline is designed for the “average” patient, therefore the
Rossaint et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:100 
Page 34 of 55
 clinician must adapt and tailor treatment to best accommo-
date each individual case.
If key interventions described in a guideline are imple-
mented, outcomes are likely to be improved [671, 672]
and death and other complications reduced [673]. More-
over, treatment according to management guidelines
may be associated with cost savings [674]. Unfortunately,
strict guideline adherence is often challenging in a com-
plex case with poor prognosis, therefore the association
between guideline adherence and good outcomes is not
necessarily causal.
The implementation of our recommendations might be
facilitated by a checklist approach analogous to the Safe
Surgery Initiative [675], which led to fewer postoperative
complications [676]. In addition or alternatively, it may be
possible to implement our recommendations using bun-
dles as has been successfully achieved during implementa-
tion of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [677].
Suggested items that should be included in such a check-
list are summarised in Table 4. Suggested patient manage-
ment bundles are listed in Table 5.
Training in trauma care should emphasise the key
role of coagulation in determining outcome. Increas-
ing clinician knowledge and understanding in this
area should be an integral part of the implementation
of the algorithm. All trauma care centres should
evaluate their own performance using a routine insti-
tutional quality management programme. An audit of
adherence to best practice, including feedback and
practice change where needed should be included as
part of the local implementation of these guidelines.
In order to evaluate the quality of care provided to
the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we
suggest that adherence to the following quality stan-
dards be assessed:
� Time from injury to the initiation of intervention to
stop bleeding (surgery or embolisation) in hypotensive
patients who do not respond to initial resuscitation.
� Time from hospital arrival to availability of a full set
of blood results [full blood count, PT, fibrinogen,
calcium, viscoelastic testing (if available)].

Discussion
These guidelines on the management of significant
bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma re-
flect the
current published literature as identified
using structured queries to identify relevant published
abstracts and full publications. Expert opinion and
current clinical practice were also considered, particu-
larly in areas in which randomised clinical trials have
not or cannot be performed for practical or ethical
reasons. Recommendations published in previous edi-
tions of the guideline [32–34] were reconsidered and
revised based on new scientific evidence and observed
shifts in clinical practice as appropriate. In addition,
new
recommendations
were
formulated
to
reflect
current clinical concerns and areas in which new re-
search data have been generated. All recommenda-
tions
were
developed
using
a
consensus
process
among the author group, comprising a multidisciplin-
ary, pan-European task force that includes representa-
tives from relevant European professional societies.
Figures 2 and 3 graphically summarise the current
recommendations included in this guideline.
In the initial resuscitation phase of treatment, the
current edition of the guideline now recommends not
only that the time between injury and bleeding con-
trol
be
minimised,
but
that
the
severely
injured
patient
be
transferred
directly
to
an
appropriate
trauma treatment centre, which may not be the same
as the nearest medical facility. The recommendations
on ventilation measures have also now been refined
to include a general recommendation to avoid hypox-
aemia (Grade 1A), normoventilation in the bleeding
trauma patient in general (Grade 1B), but with a sug-
gestion to apply hyperventilation to the brain-injured
patient (Grade 2C) to decrease intracranial pressure.
The former recommendation to avoid the use of a
single Hct measurement as a marker for bleeding has
also been differentiated to recommend that a low ini-
tial Hct value serve as a signal for possible severe
bleeding and coagulopathy, but that monitoring con-
tinue even in the presence of an initial normal value
(both Grade 1B).
A new section has been added to specifically recommend
a restricted volume replacement strategy (Grade 1B)
and the recommendations on fluid therapy have been
condensed to generally recommend the initial use, if
any, of isotonic crystalloid solutions (Grade 1A), but
avoid excessive use of 0.9 % NaCl (Grade 2C), colloid
solutions (Grade 2C) and hypotonic solutions such as
Ringer’s lactate in patients with head injury (Grade 1C).
The chapter on surgical interventions has been updated
with publications that have become available in the in-
terim where appropriate, but the overall recommendations
have not changed compared to the previous edition of the
guideline.
To reflect different strategic approaches that depend
on the availability of rapid point-of-care coagulation test-
ing to facilitate goal-directed therapy, a new section has
been added to the chapter on the initial management of
bleeding and coagulopathy that recommends either the
use of plasma and erythrocytes in a ratio of at least 1:2

(ultrasonography or 
contrast-enhanced CT) 
should be employed to 
detect free fluid in 
patients with suspected 
torso trauma.

 R19
Damage control surgery
***
Damage control surgery should be 
employed in the severely injured 
patient presenting with deep 
haemorrhagic shock, signs of 
ongoing bleeding and coagulopathy. 
Severe coagulopathy, hypothermia, 
acidosis, inaccessible major 
anatomic injury, a need for time-
consuming procedures or 
concomitant major injury outside the 
abdomen should also trigger a 
damage control approach. Primary 
definitive surgical management 
should be employed in the 
haemodynamically stable patient in 
the absence of any of these factors.
R34
Direct oral anticoagulants  – FXa inhibitors 
***
Plasma levels of oral anti-factor Xa agents 
such as rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban
may be measured in patients treated or 
suspected of being treated with one of these 
agents. If measurements are not possible or 
available advice from an expert haematologist 
may be sought. Life-threatening bleeding may 
be treated with i.v. TXA15 mg/kg (or 1 g) and  
high-dose (25-50 U/kg) 
PCC/aPCC until specific antidotes are 
available.
R21
Packing, embolisation & surgery
***
Patients with ongoing 
haemodynamic instability despite 
adequate pelvic ring stabilisation 
should undergo early preperitoneal
packing, angiographic embolisation
and/or surgical bleeding control. 
R20
Pelvic ring closure and 
stabilisation
***
Patients with pelvic ring disruption in 
haemorrhagic shock should undergo 
immediate pelvic ring closure and 
stabilisation. 
R28
Fibrinogen & cryoprecipitate
***
If a concentrate-based strategy is used, fibrinogen concentrate or 
cryoprecipitate should be administered if significant bleeding is 
accompanied by viscoelastic signs of a functional fibrinogen deficit or a 
plasma fibrinogen level of less than 1.5-2.0 g/l. An initial fibrinogen 
supplementation of 3-4 g, equivalent to 15-20 single donor units of 
cryoprecipitate or 3-4 g fibrinogen concentrate may be administered. 
Repeat doses must be guided by viscoelastic monitoring and 
laboratory assessment of fibrinogen levels.
R27
Plasma
***
In a plasma-based coagulation 
strategy plasma (FFP or pathogen-
inactivated plasma) should be 
administered to maintain PT and 
APTT<1.5 times the normal 
control. Plasma transfusion should 
be avoided in patients without 
substantial bleeding.
R36
Recombinant activated 
coagulation factor VII
***
Off-label use of rFVIIa may be  
 
considered only  
if major bleeding and 
traumatic coagulopathy persist 
despite standard attempts to 
control bleeding and best
-
practice use of conventional 
haemostatic measures. 
R33
Prothrombin complex concentrate
***
PCC should be 
used early for the emergency reversal of vitamin K-
dependent oral anticoagulants. PCC may be 
administered to mitigate life-threatening post-
traumatic bleeding patients treated with novel 
anticoagulants. If fibrinogen levels are normal, PCC  
or plasma may be administered in the bleeding 
patient based on evidence of delayed coagulation 
initiation using viscoelastic monitoring. 
R14
Restricted volume replacement
***
A restricted volume replacement 
strategy should be used to achieve 
target blood pressure until bleeding 
can be controlled.  
R13
Tissue oxygenation
***
A target systolic blood pressure of 
80-90 mmHg should be employed 
until major bleeding has been 
stopped in the initial phase following 
trauma without brain injury. A mean 
arterial pressure ≥80 mmHg should 
be maintained in patients with 
severe TBI.
R18
Temperature management
***
Early application of measures to 
reduce heat loss and warm the 
hypothermic patient should be 
employed to achieve and maintain 
normothermia. 
R17
Erythrocytes
***
Treatment should aim to achieve a 
target Hb of 7-9 g/dl. 
R22
Local haemostatic measures
***
Topical haemostatic agents should 
be employed in combination with 
other surgical measures or with 
packing for venous or moderate 
arterial bleeding associated with 
parenchymal injuries.
R30
Calcium
***
Ionised calcium levels 
should be monitored 
and maintained within 
the normal range 
during massive 
transfusion. 
R32
Desmopressin
***
Desmopressin (0.3 µg/kg) 
may be administered in 
patients treated with platelet-
inhibiting drugs or with von 
Willebrand disease. 
Desmopressin may not be 
administered routinely in the 
bleeding trauma patient.
III. Tissue oxygenation, type of 
fluid and temperature 
management
R15
Vasopressors and 
inotropic agents
***
In addition to fluids, vasopressors 
should be administered to maintain 
target blood pressure in the 
presence of life-threatening 
hypotension. An inotropic agent 
should be infused in the presence of 
myocardial dysfunction. 
R29
Platelets
***
Platelets should be administered to 
maintain a platelet count >50
109/l. A 
platelet count >100
109/l in patients with 
ongoing bleeding and/or TBI 
 may be maintained. If administered,   
an initial dose of 4-8 single platelet units or 
one aphaeresis pack may be used. 
R31
Antiplatelet agents
***
Platelets may be administered in patients with 
substantial bleeding or intracranial haemorrhage who 
have been treated with APA. Platelet 
function may be measured in patients treated or 
suspected of being treated with APA. 
Platelet concentrates may be used if platelet 
dysfunction is documented in a patient with continued 
microvascular bleeding. 
R16
Type of fluid 
***
Use of isotonic crystalloid solutions 
should be initiated in the 
hypotensive bleeding trauma patient. 
Hypotonic solutions such as Ringer’s 
lactate should be avoided in patients 
with severe head trauma. Excessive 
use of 0.9% NaCl solution might be 
avoided and use of colloids might be 
restricted.
R26
Goal-directed therapy
***
Resuscitation measures 
should be continued using a 
goal-directed strategy guided 
by standard laboratory 
coagulation values and/or 
viscoelastic tests.
R35
Direct oral anticoagulants –
Thrombin inhibitors
***
Dabigatran plasma levels may be measured in patients 
treated or suspected of being treated with dabigatran. If 
measurements are not possible or available thrombin 
time and APTT may be measured to allow a qualitative 
estimation of the presence of dabigatran. 
Life-threatening bleeding  should be treated with 
idarucizumab (5 g i.v.) or if unavailable it may be treated 
with high-dose (25-50 U/kg) PCC / aPCC, in both cases 
combined with TXA 15 mg/kg (or 1 g) i.v. 
R25
Antifibrinolytic agents
***
TXA should be administered as early as possible to the trauma patient 
who is bleeding or at risk of significant haemorrhage at a loading dose of 1 g 
infused over 10 min, followed by an i.v. infusion of 1 g over 8 h. 
TXA should be administered to the bleeding trauma patient within 3 h 
after injury. Protocols for the management of bleeding patients might consider 
administration of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital.
R23
Coagulation support
***
Monitoring and measures to support 
coagulation should be initiated 
immediately upon hospital admission. 
V. Initial management 
of bleeding and 
coagulopathy
R24
Initial resuscitation
***
Initial management of patients with expected 
massive haemorrhage should include either plasma 
(FFP or pathogen-inactivated plasma) in a plasma-
RBC ratio of at least 1:2 as needed or 
fibrinogen concentrate and RBC 
according to Hb level.
VI. Further 
resuscitation
IV. Rapid control of bleeding
R37
Thromboprophylaxis
***
Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis
should be employed within 24 h after 
bleeding has been controlled. Early 
mechanical thromboprophylaxis with 
intermittent pneumatic compression 
should be applied and early 
mechanical thromboprophylaxis with 
anti-embolic stockings may be 
applied. Inferior vena cava filters as 
thromboprophylaxis should not be 
routinely employed.

 (Grade 1B) or fibrinogen concentrate and erythrocytes
(Grade 1C). Similarly, further resuscitation measures
should be guided by a goal-directed strategy (Grade 1C)
using either the conventional blood products or a factor
concentrate-based strategy. The sections that discuss the
management of patients pre-treated with novel anticoag-
ulants have been further expanded to reflect accumulat-
ing
experience
and
awareness
of
the
necessity
of
monitoring for potential exposure, particularly in the
elderly population, and suggestions for treatment and
haematological consultation (Grade 2C).
The present guideline should be viewed as an educa-
tional aid to improve and standardise the care of the bleed-
ing trauma patients across Europe and beyond. The
recommendations that comprise the final chapter continue
to encourage the local implementation of evidence-based
guidelines for the management of the bleeding patient
following traumatic injury and that local quality and safety
management systems specifically assess key measures of
bleeding control and outcome.
Conclusions
The
appropriate
management
of
trauma
patients
with massive bleeding and coagulopathy remains a
major challenge in routine clinical practice. A multidiscip-
linary approach
and
adherence
to
evidence-based
guidance are key to improving patient outcomes. The
implementation of locally adapted treatment algorithms
should strive to achieve measureable improvements in
patient outcome.
Key messages
� Traumatically injured patients should be transported
as quickly as possible and treated by a specialised
trauma centre whenever possible.
� Measures to monitor and support coagulation
should be initiated as early as possible and used to
guide resuscitation.
� A damage control approach to surgical intervention
should guide patient management.
� Awareness of potential thrombotic risk and pre-
treatment with anticoagulant agents, particularly in
older patients, should be part of routine clinical
management.
� Local adherence to a multidisciplinary, evidence-based
treatment protocol should serve as the cornerstone of
patient management and undergo regular quality
assessment.
