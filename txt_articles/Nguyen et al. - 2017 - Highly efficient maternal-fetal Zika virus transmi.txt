Abstract
Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with human congenital fetal anomalies. To
model fetal outcomes in nonhuman primates, we administered Asian-lineage ZIKV subcuta-
neously to four pregnant rhesus macaques. While non-pregnant animals in a previous study
contemporary with the current report clear viremia within 10–12 days, maternal viremia was
prolonged in 3 of 4 pregnancies. Fetal head growth velocity in the last month of gestation
determined by ultrasound assessment of head circumference was decreased in comparison
with biparietal diameter and femur length within each fetus, both within normal range. ZIKV
RNA was detected in tissues from all four fetuses at term cesarean section. In all pregnan-
cies, neutrophilic infiltration was present at the maternal-fetal interface (decidua, placenta,
fetal membranes), in various fetal tissues, and in fetal retina, choroid, and optic nerve (first
trimester infection only). Consistent vertical transmission in this primate model may provide
a platform to assess risk factors and test therapeutic interventions for interruption of fetal
infection. The results may also suggest that maternal-fetal ZIKV transmission in human
pregnancy may be more frequent than currently appreciated.

 Author summary
Maternal ZIKV infection in pregnancy is associated with severe fetal anomalies, including
microcephaly. It has been shown that infection manifests differently in pregnancy than in
the non-pregnant state, with prolonged maternal viremia. ZIKV is spread by mosquitos
and through sexual contact and since its first detection in early 2015, has become endemic
to the Americas. While much has been learned from studying infected human pregnan-
cies, there are still many questions concerning transmission of ZIKV from mother to
fetus. Investigating ZIKV infection in non-human primates could help answer these ques-
tions due to similarities in the immune system, and the tissues separating the fetus from
the mother during pregnancy. Our study serves to model ZIKV transmission in early and
late pregnancy, as well as study the effects of this infection on the fetus and mother at
these different times in pregnancy. The data collected provides an important insight on
ZIKV in pregnancy where the pregnancies have been monitored throughout the entire
infection period until term, and suggests that vertical transmission may be very efficient,
although severe fetal outcomes are uncommon.
Introduction
Zika Virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is spread by Aedes mosquitoes [1, 2] and sexual
contact [3–9]. ZIKV, first detected in the Americas in early 2015, is now endemic. In utero
infection with ZIKV circulating in Oceania and the Americas has been associated with
increased incidence of fetal microcephaly [10, 11]. Fetal findings include placental calcifica-
tions, growth restriction, arthrogryposis, severe central nervous system (CNS) malformations
[11–16], intraocular calcifications, cataracts [17, 18] and skeletal [19, 20], and sensory [20] dis-
orders. The constellation of developmental abnormalities observed following ZIKV infection
during pregnancy is termed “congenital Zika syndrome” [21–23]. Prolonged viremia (>14
days) during pregnancy compared to nonpregnant individuals (7–10 days [24]) has been
noted [24–26]; however, the potential association between prolonged maternal viremia and
congenital Zika syndrome is not clear at this time.
Nonhuman primates are important models for human infectious disease, and ZIKV infec-
tion in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) has been established [27–29]. Viremia in nonpreg-
nant Indian rhesus macaques has been shown to persist for 7–10 days, similar to human
infection [27–29]. Nonhuman primate pregnancy has salient similarities to human pregnancy,
including hemochorial placentation with extensive trophoblast invasion and remodeling of
decidual spiral arteries [30–32] and prolonged gestation with a similar trajectory of fetal devel-
opment [33]. Maternal infection with a high dose (5000-fold higher than our current study) of
an Asian viral strain (strain FSS13025, Cambodia 2010) in a single pigtail macaque (Macaca
nemestrina) resulted in maternal viremia and severe fetal neurodevelopmental abnormalities
as well as fetal and placental infection [34].
It was previously reported that while moderate infectious doses of ZIKV are cleared
promptly in nonpregnant macaques, initial data from two pregnant macaques infected in the
first trimester showed prolonged viremia, similar to reports of human pregnancies [28]. Here
we report that the fetuses of these two first trimester ZIKV pregnancies, as well as two addi-
tional late second/early third trimester infections, had maternal-fetal ZIKV transmission with
vRNA and pathology in fetal tissues as well as at the maternal-fetal interface.

 Results
Maternal ZIKV in blood and other body fluids
Four pregnant macaques were infected by subcutaneous injection of 1x104 PFU of the Asian-
lineage ZIKV strain H.sapiens-tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-01_v1c1 [28], which is closely
related to strains circulating in the Americas. Animals 827577 and 680875 were infected at 31
or 38 days gestation, respectively (mid-first trimester) (term 165±10 days). Animals 598248
and 357676 were infected at 103 or 118 days gestation, respectively (late second/early third tri-
mester). ZIKV RNA was measured in plasma, urine, saliva, and amniotic fluid, and ultrasound
imaging of the fetus was performed following infection through ~155 days gestation (Figs 1A
and S1). All monkeys had detectable plasma viremia for 11 to 70 days post-inoculation (dpi)
(Figs 1B and 2A) and at least one day of detectable vRNA in urine. Two macaques had detect-
able vRNA in saliva, and one macaque infected at the beginning of the third trimester had
detectable vRNA in amniotic fluid on 15, 22, and 36 dpi (118, 125, and 139 days gestation,
respectively) (Fig 1B).
Innate and adaptive immune responses to ZIKV
The duration of viremia was prolonged in three of four pregnant macaques in comparison to
non-pregnant animals infected by the same route, dose, and strain of ZIKV in a previous study
[28] (Fig 2A; compare colored and gray lines). Those animals were infected contemporane-
ously (within 4 weeks) with the monkeys in the current study. To evaluate maternal immune
responses, peripheral blood CD16+ natural killer (NK) cell and CD95+CD28- CD8 effector T
cell proliferation were monitored by flow cytometry for Ki-67 expression. Although responses
were variable, there was generally higher proliferation relative to baseline in peripheral blood
CD16+ NK cells than in CD95+CD28- CD8+ effector T cells (Fig 2B), and these responses
were not qualitatively different from nonpregnant animals (Fig 2B, grey tracings). The num-
bers of circulating plasmablasts tended to increase more slowly in third-trimester infections;
however, the response did not distinctly differ between the first and third trimesters (Fig 2C).
Sera from macaques that were infected with ZIKV in the first or third trimesters neutralized
ZIKV-FP across a range of serum dilutions. Indeed, neutralization curves prepared using sera
from all 4 animals revealed a similar profile as compared to sera from ZIKV-infected nonpreg-
nant animals (Fig 2D). All animals developed neutralizing antibodies (nAb) with a 90% plaque
reduction neutralizing antibody test (PRNT90) titer of 1:160 (827577 and 598248) or 1:640
(660875 and 357676) by 28 dpi. Interestingly, animal 660875 (first trimester infection) had
more vigorous and prolonged NK, T cell, and plasmablast responses to infection compared to
the other three pregnancies. ZIKV infection was not associated with consistent changes in
complete blood cell counts or serum chemistry in pregnant animals (Fig 3).
Assessment of fetal growth
Sonographic images (e.g., Fig 4) were obtained approximately weekly to monitor fetal growth
and viability. No significant fetal or placental abnormalities were observed. Fetal femur length
(FL) was typically within one standard deviation (SD) of mean database values for fetal rhesus
macaques across gestation [35], suggesting absence of symmetrical growth restriction (Fig
4A). The biparietal diameter (BPD) was within two SD of expected values across gestation (Fig
4B). However, during the last month of pregnancy, head circumference (HC) in all animals
was between one and three SD below the mean (Fig 4C).
To discern changes in fetal growth trajectories, we extrapolated the predicted gestational
ages (pGA) by mapping the observed fetal biometric measures in individual pregnancies onto

 normative growth curves for BPD, FL, and HC [35, 36]. Fig 5A–5D compare within each ani-
mal the pGA estimated by an average of BPD and FL with that estimated by HC. In 3 of 4 preg-
nancies, pGA as estimated by HC lagged 16.5 to 19 days behind the pGA estimated by an
average of BPD and FL. HC reflects both BPD and occipitofrontal diameters. Human fetuses
and infants affected by severe microcephaly in congenital ZIKV infection have vermis agenesis
(growth failure of the cerebellum) and reduced frontal cortex growth [11, 15, 18, 37]: regions
of the brain where growth deficits will give rise to a reduced occipitofrontal diameter. Fetal
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was also performed for the dams infected in the first

and is expressed relative to the infectivity of ZIKV-FP in the absence of serum. The concentration of sera indicated on the x-axis is expressed as log10
(dilution factor of serum). The EC90 and EC50, estimated by non-linear regression analysis, are also indicated by a dashed line. Neutralization curves for

 trimester (827577, imaged at 102 dpi [140 days gestation], and 660875, imaged at 60 dpi [91
days gestation]). These images provided evidence of normal volume, cortical thickness, sulca-
tion, and ventricular and extra-axial spaces (S2 Fig). However, it has been reported that
human infants whose mothers were infected with ZIKV during pregnancy have been born
with normal cranial anatomy, but developed microcephaly within 6 months [19, 38]. Thus,
further studies focused on macaque postnatal development are warranted.
Fetal viral burden and histopathology
All ZIKV pregnancies progressed without overt adverse outcomes. At 153–158 days gestation,
fetuses were surgically delivered, euthanized, and tissues collected. None of the fetuses had

 evidence of microcephaly or other abnormalities upon gross examination. Approximately 50
fetal and maternal tissues (S3 Fig) were collected from each pregnancy for histopathology and
vRNA by qRT-PCR. Results are summarized in Fig 6. ZIKV RNA was detected in all four
fetuses, albeit in different tissues in individual fetuses, and in some maternal tissues including
spleen, liver, lymph node, and decidua (Fig 6A). Notably, the pregnancy with the longest dura-
tion of viremia (827577; 70 days viremia (39–109 days gestation) had fetal tissues (optic nerve,
axillary lymph node) with the highest vRNA burden. However, the fetus from the short (9 day)
duration maternal viremia (119–127 days gestation) also had vRNA in fetal lymph node, peri-
cardium, and lung (Fig 6A).
Pathologists were blinded to vRNA and trimester of infection findings for histology evalua-
tion and scoring (Fig 6B; see S1 Data for a full listing of pathology findings). The maternal-
fetal interface in all four ZIKV infections presented minimal to moderate suppurative placenti-
tis with variable mineralization and necrosis, as well as minimal to moderate suppurative
mean. The data from the last month of pregnancy are also presented as a magnified view of the scatter of
individual data points on the right. Representative ultrasound images of FL, BPD, and HC are also shown at

 deciduitis (Fig 7). Three of four pregnancies had suppurative amnionitis and three of four
dams had mild to moderate suppurative splenitis. Histology confirmed normal CNS structures
and absence of encephalitis (inflammation) in all four fetuses. Morphologic fetal diagnoses
included: suppurative splenitis, suppurative to lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis, suppurative
alveolitis (pneumonia), and suppurative lymphadenitis (S1 Data). The duration of viremia or
trimester of maternal infection did not generally correlate with the severity or distribution of
scored fetal pathologies (Table 1), however it is significant that both fetuses infected during the
first trimester, but not the third trimester, had ocular pathology: inflammation of retina, cho-
roid, and optic nerve (Fig 8, S1 Data). A segment of the fetal axillary lymph node with the high-
est vRNA burden was immunostained for ZIKV. ZIKV NS2B-positive cells were observed in
lymph node medullary cords, a subset of which were CD163-positive macrophages (Fig 9).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that similar to human pregnancy, Indian rhesus macaque fetuses are
susceptible to congenital infection following maternal subcutaneous infection with a moderate
infectious dose of Asian-lineage ZIKV during the first or late second/early third trimesters.

 Maternal-fetal transmission in the rhesus macaque is highly efficient: 4 of 4 maternal infections
resulted in infected fetuses, and all pregnancies demonstrated pathology at the maternal-fetal
interface and in the fetus, with variable fetal vRNA distribution. Fetal infection was accompa-
nied by an apparent reduced trajectory of fetal HC in the last month of gestation, without

 overall fetal growth restriction. While we hypothesize that the duration of maternal viremia
correlates with risk for fetal impact, pathology at the maternal-fetal interface and fetal vRNA
in the pregnancy with the shortest duration of viremia following third trimester infection
suggests that the fetus is at risk even with a brief exposure to circulating maternal virus, as
reported in human pregnancy [12]. Indeed, our findings are consistent with the emerging pic-
ture of congenital Zika syndrome, in which microcephaly is the most severe of a range of
potential sequelae. Given the high rate of vertical transmission in our model in the absence of
severe developmental defects, it seems possible that there is a higher rate of human fetal in
utero ZIKV exposure than is currently appreciated, exposures which do not result in malfor-
mations obvious at birth, but may manifest later in postnatal development.
Models of vertical ZIKV transmission have been developed in mice [39, 40, 41, 42]. Mice
are generally not susceptible to ZIKV infection because ZIKV cannot subvert the interferon
response in mice as it does in humans [43]. However, studies have now been conducted with
mouse strains carrying deletions of the IFNAR or pattern recognition receptor genes (e.g.,
IRF3, IRF7) [40, 41]. In these models, placental infection and pathology is revealed, and there
is maternal-fetal transmission and fetal growth defects, loss and brain injury [39, 40, 41]. More
recently, an alternate approach in which virus is directly injected into the uterine wall adjacent
to the conceptuses has been reported in immunocompetent mice, and this model also results
in placental infection and transmission of the virus to the fetus [42]. However, neither immu-
nodeficient nor uterine injection models are directly relevant to the mode of transmission by
which the human fetus is exposed to ZIKV. While murine genetic models allow mechanistic
investigation of ZIKV pathophysiology that cannot be explored with samples from human
clinical patients, the murine maternal-fetal interface, placental structure, and pace and com-
plexity of fetal brain development are quite different from humans, whereas nonhuman pri-
mate pregnancy is very similar to human pregnancy in these critical areas for understanding
the impact of ZIKV on the fetus.
The NHP has previously been used to model TORCH infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus,
toxoplasma) on fetal infection and neuropathology [44–46], and listeriosis and other bacterial
infections on fetal loss and stillbirth [47, 48] and preterm labor [49]. Congenital ZIKV infec-
tion in macaques provides a tractable and translational model of human disease. While it has
previously been reported that infection of a pregnant pigtail macaque with a Cambodian ZIKV
strain resulted in severe fetal malformations of the central nervous system [34], we did not
observe this outcome in our study. It is theoretically possible that the lack of severe outcomes,
including microcephaly, in our study may be due to the use of a specific ZIKV strain or dose,
that rhesus monkeys, in general, are resistant to ZIKV-induced fetal neuropathology, or that
there is a difference in ZIKV susceptibility between the rhesus macaques in our study and the
single pigtail macaque used in the previous study. Regardless, lack of a severe outcome should
not be considered a limitation of our study, since it is also known that only a subset of human
maternal infections result in severe fetal outcomes [50], and our current study significantly
expands the data available regarding ZIKV infection in nonhuman primates. Modest fetal neu-
rodevelopmental outcomes with the model we have described in this current report may pro-
vide an opportunity to further evaluate factors which foster severe fetal developmental impact,
such as co-infection or previous exposure to other pathogens, and support the development of
strategies to prevent maternal-fetal transmission and reduce fetal virus burden. Further infor-
mation on the ontogeny of fetal infection and distribution of virus in the fetus during gestation
using relevant animal models will be important to establish before consideration of interven-
tional strategies, such as maternal or fetal passive immunization [51] in pregnant women pre-
senting with symptoms of ZIKV infection.

 Methods
Experimental design
Four pregnant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Indian ancestry were infected subcutane-
ously with 1x104 PFU ZIKV (Zika virus/H.sapiens-tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-01_v1c1) at
31, 38, 104, or 119 days gestation (term 165±10 days). All macaques utilized in the study were
free of Macacine herpesvirus 1, Simian Retrovirus Type D (SRV), Simian T-lymphotropic
virus Type 1 (STLV), and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus as part of the Specific Pathogen
Free (SPF) colony at WNPRC.
Ethics statement
The rhesus macaques used in this study were cared for by the staff at the Wisconsin National
Primate Research Center (WNPRC) according to regulations and guidelines of the University
of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which approved this study (pro-
tocol g005401) in accordance with recommendations of the Weatherall report and according
to the principles described in the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. All animals were housed in enclosures with at least 4.3, 6.0, or 8.0 sq. ft.
of floor space, measuring 30, 32, or 36 inches high, and containing a tubular PVC or stainless
steel perch. Each individual enclosure was equipped with a horizontal or vertical sliding door,
an automatic water lixit, and a stainless steel feed hopper. All animals were fed using a nutri-
tional plan based on recommendations published by the National Research Council. Twice
daily macaques were fed a fixed formula, extruded dry diet (2050 Teklad Global 20% Protein
Primate Diet) with adequate carbohydrate, energy, fat, fiber (10%), mineral, protein, and vita-
min content. Dry diets were supplemented with fruits, vegetables, and other edible objects
(e.g., nuts, cereals, seed mixtures, yogurt, peanut butter, popcorn, marshmallows, etc.) to pro-
vide variety to the diet and to inspire species-specific behaviors such as foraging. To further
promote psychological well-being, animals were provided with food enrichment, human-to-
monkey interaction, structural enrichment, and manipulanda. Environmental enrichment
objects were selected to minimize chances of pathogen transmission from one animal to
another and from animals to care staff. While on study, all animals were evaluated by trained
animal care staff at least twice each day for signs of pain, distress, and illness by observing
appetite, stool quality, activity level, physical condition. Animals exhibiting abnormal pre-
sentation for any of these clinical parameters were provided appropriate care by attending vet-
erinarians. Prior to all minor/brief experimental procedures, animals were sedated using
ketamine anesthesia, which was reversed at the conclusion of a procedure using atipamizole.
Animals undergoing surgical delivery of fetuses were pre-medicated with ketamine and gen-
eral anesthesia was maintained during the course of the procedure with isoflurane gas using an
endotracheal tube. Animals were monitored regularly until fully recovered from anesthesia.
Delivered fetuses were anesthetized with ketamine, and then euthanized by an intramuscular
or intraperitoneal overdose injection of sodium pentobarbital. Adult animals were not eutha-
nized as part of these studies.
Care and use of macaques
Female monkeys were co-housed with compatible males and observed daily for menses and
breeding. Pregnancy was detected by ultrasound examination of the uterus at approximately
20–24 days gestation following the predicted day of ovulation. The day of gestation was esti-
mated (+/- 2 days) based on the dams menstrual cycle and previous pregnancy history, obser-
vation of copulation, and the greatest length of the fetus at initial ultrasound examination

 which was compared to normative growth data in this species [35]. Ultrasound examination of
the conceptus was performed subsequent to ZIKV infection as described below. For all proce-
dures (i.e., physical examinations, virus inoculations, ultrasound examinations, blood and swab
collection), animals were anesthetized with an intramuscular dose of ketamine (10 mg/kg).
Blood samples from the femoral or saphenous vein were obtained using a vacutainer system or
needle and syringe. The four pregnant macaques were monitored daily prior to and after infec-
tion for any physical signs (e.g., diarrhea, inappetance, inactivity, atypical behaviors).
Inoculations
Zika virus/H.sapiens-tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-01_v1c1, originally isolated from a 51-year-
old female in France returning from French Polynesia with a single round of amplification on
Vero cells, was obtained from Xavier de Lamballerie (European Virus Archive, Marseille France).
The inoculating stock was prepared and validated as previously described [28]. A single harvest of
virus with a titer of 1.26 x 106 PFU/mL (equivalent to 1.43 x 109 vRNA copies/mL) was used for
all 4 challenges. Animals were anesthetized as described above, and 1 mL of inocula was adminis-
tered subcutaneously over the cranial dorsum. Post-inoculation, animals were closely monitored
by veterinary and animal care staff for adverse reactions or any signs of disease.
Immunophenotyping
The number of activated/proliferating peripheral blood lymphocyte subset cells was quantified
using a modified version of our protocol detailed step-by-step in OMIP-028 [52] as previously
reported [28]. Briefly, 0.1 mL of EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples were incubated
for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of a mastermix of antibodies against CD45
(clone D058-1283, Brilliant Violet 786 conjugate, 2.5 μl), CD3 (clone SP34-2 Alexa Fluor 700
conjugate, 5 μl), CD8 (clone SK2, Brilliant Violet 510, 2.5 μl), NKG2A/C (clone Z199, PE-Cy7
conjugate, 5 μl), CD16 (clone 3G8, Pacific Blue conjugate, 5 μl), CD69 (clone TP1.55.3, ECD
conjugate, 3 μl), HLA-DR (clone 1D11, Brilliant Violet 650 conjugate, 1 μl), CD4 (clone SK3,
Brilliant Violet 711 conjugate, 5 μl), CD28 (clone CD28.2, PE conjugate, 5 μl), and CD95
(clone DX2, PE-Cy5 conjugate, 10 μl) antigens. All antibodies were obtained from BD BioSci-
ences, with the exception of the NKG2A/C-specific antibody, which was purchased from Beck-
man Coulter, and the CCR7 antibody that was purchased from R&D Systems. The cells were
permeabilized using Bulk Permeabilization Reagent (Life Technology), then stained for 15
min with Ki-67 (clone B56, Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate) while the permeabilizer was present.
The cells were then washed twice in media and resuspended in 0.125 ml of 2% paraformalde-
hyde until they were run on a BD LSRII Flow Cytometer. Flow data were analyzed using
Flowjo software version 9.9.3.
Plasmablast detection
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from four ZIKV-infected pregnant rhe-
sus monkeys at 3, 7, 11, and 14 dpi were stained with the following panel of fluorescently
labeled antibodies (Abs) specific for the following surface markers to analyze for plasmablast
presence: CD20 FITC (L27), CD80 PE (L307.4), CD123 PE-Cy7(7G3), CD3 APC-Cy7 (SP34-
2), IgG BV605 (G18-145) (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), CD14 AF700 (M5E2),
CD11c BV421 (3.9), CD16 BV570 (3G8), CD27 BV650(O323) (all from BioLegend, San Diego,
CA), IgD AF647 (polyclonal) (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), and HLA-DR PE-TxRed
(TU
¨ 36) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to discriminate live cells. Cells were analyzed exactly as previously
described [28].

 Complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry panels
CBCs with white blood cell (WBC) differential counts were performed on EDTA-anticoagu-
lated whole blood samples on a Sysmex XS-1000i automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex
Corporation, Kobe, Japan). CBCs included the following tests: absolute WBC count, absolute
counts and percentages for WBC differentials, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin and
hematocrit, RBC indices (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell distribution width), platelet count,
and mean platelet volume. Blood smears were prepared and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain
(Wescor Aerospray Hematology Slide Stainer; Wescor Inc, Logan, UT). Manual slide evalua-
tions were performed on samples when laboratory-defined criteria were met (absolute WBC
count, WBC differential percentages, hemoglobin, hematocrit, or platelet count outside of ref-
erence intervals; automated WBC differential counts unreported by the analyzer; and the pres-
ence of analyzer-generated abnormal flags). Manual slide evaluations included WBC
differential and platelet counts with evaluation of WBC, RBC, and platelet morphologies.
Chemistry panels composed of 20 tests were performed on serum using a Cobas 6000 ana-
lyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Tests in each panel included glucose,
blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatine kinase, cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate amino-
transferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactic acid dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, gamma-gluta-
myl transferase, total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorous, iron,
sodium, potassium, and chloride. CBC and serum chemistry panel results were recorded in
the WNPRC Electronic Health Record (EHR) system with species, age, and sex-specific refer-
ence intervals provided within the reports generated through the EHR.
Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90)
Macaque serum samples were screened for ZIKV neutralizing antibodies utilizing a plaque
reduction neutralization test (PRNT) on Vero cells (ATCC #CCL-81). Endpoint titrations of
reactive sera, utilizing a 90% cutoff (PRNT90) were performed as previously reported [28, 53]
against ZIKV strain H.sapiens-tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-01_v1c1 [28]. Briefly, ZIKV was
mixed with serial 2-fold dilutions of serum for 1 hour at 37˚C prior to being added to Vero
cells and neutralization curves were generated using GraphPad Prism software. The resulting
data were analyzed by non-linear regression to estimate the dilution of serum required to
inhibit both 90% and 50% of infection.
Fetal rhesus biometric measurements
Dams were sedated with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) for sonographic assessments and
amniocentesis. The biparietal diameter (BPD) and head circumference (HC) were measured
on an axial image at the level of the hypoechoic thalami, with the echogenic interhemispheric
fissure/falx all well visualized [54, 55]. The BPD was measured from the outer margin of the
near calvarial echo to the inner margin of the deep calvarial echo. The HC was measured cir-
cumferentially at the outer margin of the calvaria [55–57]. The abdominal circumference was
measured on an axial plane at the level of the stomach and the bifurcation of the main portal
vein into the left and right branches, approximately perpendicular to the spine; the abdominal
circumference was measured around the outside of the margin of the fetal abdomen [55, 58].
The femur length (FL) was measured from the greater trochanter to the lateral condyle along
the distal end of the shaft, excluding the femoral head and the distal epiphysis [57]. Growth
curves were developed [55] for ZIKV-infected monkeys for BPD, HC, and FL. Mean mea-
surements and standard deviations at specified days of gestation in Rhesus macaques were
retrieved from Tarantal [35].

 Fetal rhesus amniocentesis
Under real-time ultrasound guidance, a 22 gauge, 3.5 inch Quincke spinal needle was inserted
into the amniotic sac. After 1.5–2 mL of fluid were removed and discarded due to potential
maternal contamination, an additional 3–4 mL of amniotic fluid were removed for viral
qRT-PCR analysis as described elsewhere [28]. These samples were obtained at the gestational
ages specified in Fig 1A. All fluids were free of any blood contamination.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Noninvasive imaging of the fetal brain was performed on isoflurane-anesthetized monkeys on
a clinical 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system (MR750, GE Healthcare, Waukesha,
WI). T1 and T2-weighted axial and sagittal images were acquired. T2-weighted axial images
were acquired with a single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) sequence. Scan protocol for S2A Fig:
respiratory gated multislice 2D acquisition; TE/TR = 141 / 2526 ms; Slice thickness: 2 mm;
acquired spatial resolution = 1.25 mm x 1.25 mm; receiver bandwidth = 651 Hz/pixel. For S2B
Fig, T1-weighted axial images were acquired with a multiecho spoiled gradient echo sequence.
The scan protocol for respiratory gated 3D acquisition under isoflurane anesthesia was itera-
tive decomposition with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation (IDEAL) processing for
reconstruction of in-phase images from 8 echoes; 2 shots, 4 echoes each shot; flip angle = 15
deg; TE min = 1.6 ms; TR = 15.4 ms; Slice thickness: 1 mm; acquired spatial resolution = 1.1
mm x 1.1 mm; receiver bandwidth = 488 Hz/pixel. Animals were intubated for anesthesia
under ketamine sedation, and imaging sessions lasted for approximately 1 hour.
Viral RNA isolation from urine, amniotic fluid, and oral/vaginal swabs
RNA was isolated from maternal and fetal plasma and PBMC, urine, amniotic fluid, and oral
and vaginal swabs using the Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega, Madison,
WI) on a Maxwell 16 MDx instrument as previously reported [28].
Viral RNA isolation from fetal and maternal tissues
Fetal and maternal tissues were processed with RNAlater (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturer protocols. Viral RNA was isolated from the tissues using the Maxwell 16
LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) on a Maxwell 16 MDx instrument (Pro-
mega, Madison, WI). A range of 20–40 mg of each tissue was homogenized using homogeniza-
tion buffer from the Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit, the TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) and two 5 mm stainless steel beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a 2 ml snapcap
tube, shaking twice for 3 minutes at 20 Hz each side. The isolation was continued according to
the Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit protocol, and samples were eluted into 50 μl
RNase free water.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
Viral RNA isolated from plasma, urine, oral swabs, amniotic fluid, and maternal or fetal tissues
was quantified by qRT-PCR using modified primers and probe adapted from Lanciotti et al.
[59] as previously described [53]. The SuperScript III Platinum one-step quantitative RT-PCR
system was used (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diag-
nostics, Indianapolis, IN). Assay probes were used at final concentrations of 600 nM and 100
nM respectively, along with 150 ng random primers (Promega, Madison, WI). Conditions and
methods were as previously described [28]. Tissue viral loads were calculated per mg of tissue.

 Cesarean section and tissue collection (necropsy)
At ~155 days gestation, fetal and maternal tissues were surgically removed at laparotomy.
These were survival surgeries for the dams. The entire conceptus within the gestational sac
(fetus, placenta, fetal membranes, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid) was collected and sub-
mitted for necropsy. The fetus was euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbitol (50
mg/kg). Tissues were carefully dissected using sterile instruments that were changed between
each organ and tissue type to minimize possible cross contamination. Each organ/tissue was
evaluated grossly in situ, removed with sterile instruments, placed in a sterile culture dish, and
sectioned for histology, viral burden assay, or banked for future assays. Sampling priority for
small or limited fetal tissue volumes (e.g., thyroid gland, eyes) was vRNA followed by histopa-
thology, so not all tissues were available for both analyses. Sampling of all major organ systems
and associated biological samples included the CNS (brain, spinal cord, eyes), digestive, uro-
genital, endocrine, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, and respiratory systems as
well as amniotic fluid, gastric fluid, bile, and urine. A comprehensive listing of all specific tis-
sues collected and analyzed is presented in Fig 6 and S3 Fig.
Biopsies of the placental bed (uterine placental attachment site containing deep decidua
basalis and myometrium), maternal liver, spleen, and a mesenteric lymph node were collected
aseptically during surgery into sterile petri dishes, weighed, and further processed for viral bur-
den and when sufficient sample size was obtained, histology. Maternal decidua was dissected
from the maternal surface of the placenta.
Histology
Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 14 days and transferred into 70% etha-
nol until routinely processed and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 μm) were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Pathologists were blinded to vRNA findings when tissue
sections were evaluated microscopically. Lesions in each tissue were described and scored for
severity as shown in Fig 6B, and assigned morphologic diagnoses assigned as listed in S1 Data.
Photomicrographs were obtained using a bright light microscope Olympus BX43 and Olym-
pus BX46 (Olympus Inc., Center Valley, PA) with attached Olympus DP72 digital camera
(Olympus Inc.) and Spot Flex 152 64 Mp camera (Spot Imaging), and captured using commer-
cially available image-analysis software (cellSens DimensionR, Olympus Inc. and spot software
5.2).
For immunohistochemistry, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight
then paraffin embedded. 5 μm sections were cut and deparaffinized. Antigen retrieval was
accomplished by incubation in heated (95˚C) 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) plus 0.05%
Tween-20. The sections were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 1 hour at room temp
then incubated overnight at 4˚C with rabbit anti Zika NS2B 1:100 (GeneTex GTX133308,
Irvine, CA) and mouse anti-CD163 1:100 (Novus, NB110-40686, Littleton, CO) or comparable
control IgGs (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz CA). Sections were rinsed with TBS + tween-20 (TBST)
3x and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies; donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647
(1:5000), donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:2500) for 1 hour at room temperature (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Sections were washed (3x TBST), exposed
to DAPI and mounted with Aqua Poly Seal (Polysciences Inc, Warrington, PA). Sections were
evaluated on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.
