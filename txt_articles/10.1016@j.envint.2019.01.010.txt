Background: The persistent environmental contaminants perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have gained atten-
tion due to their potential adverse health effects, in particular following early life exposure. Information on
human fetal exposure to PFASs is currently limited to one report on first trimester samples. There is no data
available on PFAS concentrations in fetal organs throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy.
Methods: We measured the concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA),
and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) in human embryos and fetuses with corresponding placentas and
maternal serum samples derived from elective pregnancy terminations and cases of intrauterine fetal death. A
total of 78 embryos and fetuses aged 7–42 gestational weeks were included and a total of 225 fetal organs
covering liver, lung, heart, central nervous system (CNS), and adipose tissue were analyzed, together with 71
placentas and 63 maternal serum samples. PFAS concentrations were assayed by liquid chromatography/triple
quadrupole mass spectrometry.
Results: All evaluated PFASs were detected and quantified in maternal sera, placentas and embryos/fetuses. In
maternal

samples,
PFOS

by
PFOA > PFNA > PFDA = PFUnA = PFHxS. Similarly, PFOS was detected in highest concentrations in embryo/
fetal tissues, followed by PFOA > PFNA = PFDA = PFUnA. PFHxS was detected in very few fetuses. In general,
PFAS concentrations in embryo/fetal tissue (ng/g) were lower than maternal serum (ng/ml) but similar to
placenta concentrations. The total PFAS burden (i.e. the sum of all PFASs) was highest in lung tissue in first
trimester samples and in liver in second and third trimester samples. The burden was lowest in CNS samples
irrespective of fetal age. The placenta:maternal serum ratios of PFOS, PFOA and PFNA increased across gestation
suggesting bioaccumulation in the placenta. Further, we observed that the ratios were higher in pregnancies
with male fetuses compared to female fetuses.
Conclusions: Human fetuses were intrinsically exposed to a mixture of PFASs throughout gestation. The

T
 compounds were detected in all analyzed tissues, suggesting that PFASs reach and may affect many types of
organs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PFASs pass the placenta and deposit to embryo and fetal
tissues, calling for risk assessment of gestational exposures.
1. Introduction
The perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are water- and grease-re-
sistant compounds widely used in industrial applications and consumer
products (Bach et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2014). PFASs consist of
simple alkyl chains where fluoride atoms replace hydrogen atoms,
forming strong carbon‑fluorine bonds resistant to degradation. This
makes these compounds highly persistent and bioaccumulative in the
environment, with longer chains more persistent than shorter ones (Key
et al., 1997). Many of the PFASs, such as perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA),
perfluorononanoic
acid
(PFNA),
perfluorodecanoic
acid
(PFDA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) are listed as Sub-
stances of Very High Concern and regulated under the Registration,
Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) in the
EU (REACH, 2017) due to their bioaccumulative properties and toxicity
for reproduction (Bach et al., 2015; De Solla et al., 2012; Olsen et al.,
2007; Tsuda, 2016). The United States Environmental Protection
Agency (2018) also collects data on PFASs in drinking water under the
Third
Unregulated
Contaminant
Monitoring
Rule.
Per-
fluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) is restricted in accordance to the
Stockholm Convention as a persistent organic pollutant (United Nations
Environment Programme, 2017). Many short-chain PFASs are still
widely used, however, they are believed to be less bioaccumulative and
less toxic (Brendel et al., 2018).
PFASs are amphiphilic compounds with estimated octanol-water
partition coefficients (logP) varying from 2.82 to 8.90 (Wang et al.,
2013), and can be detected in several human organs (Kärrman et al.,
2010; Maestri et al., 2006; Olsen et al., 2003; Pérez et al., 2013). In
general, lung tissue is suggested to accumulate the highest concentra-
tion of PFASs, although PFOS predominantly accumulated in liver and
PFOA in bones (Kärrman et al., 2010; Maestri et al., 2006; Pérez et al.,
2013). Mother-to-fetus transport of PFAS has been addressed in one
study that measured the concentrations in maternal serum, cord blood
and placenta and found that PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS were efficiently
transported from maternal to fetal circulation (Chen et al., 2017).
Prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA has been associated with low
birth weight in humans (Fei et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2014; Lauritzen
et al., 2017; Maisonet et al., 2012), although reports were inconsistent
(Bach et al., 2015; Olsen et al., 2009), underlining the need for more
studies. Further, maternal serum concentrations of PFDA and PFNA
have been associated with higher miscarriage rates (Jensen et al.,
2015), whereas PFOS and PFOA showed limited evidence for an asso-
ciation (Darrow et al., 2014). In rodents, high exposure of PFOS
(2–20 mg/kg) and PFOA (1–40 mg/kg) during pregnancy have been
associated with reduced postnatal survival, lower birth weight, de-
creased growth of the pups, disturbed lactation (Lau et al., 2006, 2004,
2003; Olsen et al., 2009), and disrupted thyroid function (Yu et al.,
2009). Interestingly, some of the associations appear to be modified by
the fetal sex. Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in cord blood have been
associated with an increased risk of congenital cerebral palsy in Danish
boys but not in girls (Liew et al., 2014). In contrast, PFOA in cord
plasma has been suggested to increase the thyroxine hormone level in
newborn girls but not in boys (de Cock et al., 2014). In rodents, prenatal
exposure to PFOA advanced the onset of puberty in male mice, with no
effect in female mice (Lau et al., 2006). Taken together, data on po-
tential adverse health effects of PFASs on human fetal development are
still inconclusive and possible sexually dimorphic associations have not
been fully addressed.
Chemical health risk assessment requires data on adverse health
effects and chemical exposure levels in the affected population.
Biomonitoring programs have shown that PFASs can be detected in the
serum of virtually everyone including pregnant women (Mørck et al.,
2015; Starling et al., 2014). However, biomonitoring programs do not
contain human fetal samples, and thus there is a lack of data concerning
human fetal exposure. We have previously measured tissue concentra-
tions of PFASs in human first trimester embryos and fetuses (gestational
weeks 7–12) and found a significant positive correlation between some
PFASs and gestational age (Mamsen et al., 2017). The present study
expands these analyses by including human fetal tissues from second
and third trimester, allowing for an evaluation of human fetal PFASs
exposure across the entire gestational period. We report fetal con-
centrations of six PFASs: PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, and PFHxS
in a total of 78 embryos and fetuses aged 7–42 gestational weeks. These
data provide i) important information on the transfer of PFASs from
maternal circulation to fetal organs and bioaccumulation during preg-
nancy; ii) actual fetal PFAS concentrations in vital organs during the
entire pregnancy, which is essential for better risk assessment and for
designing future experimental studies; and iii) tools for epidemiologists
to estimate fetal exposures based on maternal serum concentrations in
pregnancy cohort studies.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Human embryonic and fetal tissues, placentas and maternal blood
samples
First trimester embryonic and fetal tissues, including liver, lung,
heart, and spinal cord, together with placenta samples were obtained at
the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital
Skejby and Regional Hospital Randers, Denmark as described (Mamsen
et al., 2017). Tissues were obtained in 2014–2015 from healthy women
above the age of 18 years, who had decided to terminate pregnancy for
reasons other than fetal abnormality before gestational week 12. All
embryos and fetuses appeared morphologically normal. All participants
received oral and written information and gave their informed consent.
Maternal blood samples were obtained on the day of fetal evacuation.
Embryonic and fetal sex were determined by gonadal morphology and
confirmed by PCR (Nakahori et al., 1991). PFAS concentrations in first
trimester embryonic and fetal tissues has previously been published
(Mamsen et al., 2017).
Second and third trimester fetal samples were derived from preg-
nancies that resulted in intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) which under-
went an autopsy to determine cause of death at the Perinatal Pathology
Unit
at
Karolinska
University
Hospital,
Huddinge,
Sweden
in
2015–2016. The cause of fetal death was determined according to the
Stockholm classification (Varli et al., 2008) and was recorded (Supp.
Table 1) together with associated clinical data retrieved from autopsy
reports and medical records. Fetal sex was determined by gross mor-
phology. Fetal tissues collected included liver, lung, heart, brain, and
adipose tissue (when available) together with placenta samples. Ad-
ditionally, biobanked maternal serum samples obtained during routine
first trimester prenatal visit to the maternity care in gestational weeks
9–12 were retrieved from the Stockholm Medical Biobank and included
in the analyses. All data were completely anonymized.
2.2. Tissue processing
Tissue samples (mean weight: 0.064 g, range: 0.047–0.139 g) were
homogenized at a ratio of three parts 70% acetonitrile solution con-
taining all included isotopically labelled PFASs as internal standards

 (IS) to one part tissue on a Tissuelyser II (Qiagen, Copenhagen,
Denmark) for 60 s at 15 Hz at room temperature with 2 mm stainless
steel beads, thereafter shaken at room temperature for 30 min followed
by centrifugation at 1600 ×g according to Mamsen et al., 2017.
2.3. Analysis of PFASs
The analyses of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, and PFHxS in
serum, placenta and fetal tissue samples were performed by triple
quadrupole mass spectrometry (QTRAP 5500; AB Sciex, Foster City, CA,
USA)
coupled
to
a
liquid
chromatography
system
(LC/MS/MS)
(UFLCXR, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), as described pre-
viously (Mamsen et al., 2017). Serum calibration standards have been
previously described (Mamsen et al., 2017). Briefly, serum was used as
matrix for the calibration standards and also as a proxy matrix for the
tissue samples. The samples were prepared using three parts of 70%
acetonitrile solution containing the ISs, as above. The PFAS con-
centrations were quantified by peak area ratios between the analytes
and the IS and corrected for the chemical blank. The limit of quantifi-
cation (LOQ) was defined as the concentration corresponding to ten
times the standard deviation (SD) of the ratio of the peak at the same
retention time as the analyzed compounds and the corresponding IS
divided by the slope of the calibration line and determined in the
chemical blank samples (Supp. Table 2). The laboratory is part of the
Round Robin inter-comparison program for analyses of PFOS and PFOA
(Professor Dr. med. Hans Drexler, Institute and Out-Patient Clinic for
Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, University of Er-
langen-Nuremberg, Germany) with results within the program's toler-
ance limits.
2.4. Statistical methods
All statistical analyses were performed using the R programming
language (R Core Team, 2018) through RStudio (RStudio Team, 2016)
with the packages ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009), ggpubr (Kassambara,
2017), reshape2 (Wickham, 2007), gplots (Warnes et al., 2016), and
dichromat (Lumley, 2013). Analyses were performed only on samples
above LOQ. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare chemical con-
centrations among trimesters and Wilcox ranked test with Bonferroni
correction for post hoc comparisons. Correlation was investigated using
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The total PFAS burden for
different tissues were calculated by adding the averaged tissue con-
centrations of the five compounds analyzed in the samples. PFHxS was
not included because it was not measured in the first trimester samples.
Relative concentrations were computed by dividing the tissue con-
centration with either the maternal serum or placenta concentration for
each compound. The spinal cord of the first trimester and the brain of
the second and third trimester fetuses were grouped as central nervous
system (CNS) since they are all protected by the blood-brain barrier
(Daneman and Prat, 2015). Additionally, a linear regression model was
used to determine associations between PFAS tissue concentrations and
fetal age in days in both sexes. Significance was defined as p < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Sample characteristics
A total of 78 pregnancies were included, from which a total of 296
individual tissue samples were obtained. Maternal blood samples were
available in 63 cases. Fetal tissue was obtained from 38 first trimester
pregnancies, 18 second trimester pregnancies, and 22 third trimester
pregnancies (Table 1). Maternal and fetal characteristics are presented
in Table 1. The first trimester women were younger than the second
(p < 0.01) and third trimester women (p < 0.001) (Table 1). Ma-
ternal body mass index (BMI) during the first prenatal visit was sig-
nificantly higher in the third trimester group compared to the first
trimester group (p < 0.05) (Table 1). The most common causes of
death in the IUFD cases were placental insufficiency and intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR) (58%), and infection (13%) with the diag-
nosis being certain in 60% of the cases (Supp. Table 1).
3.2. PFAS quantification frequency
The LOQ ranged from 0.03 to 0.60 ng/ml for serum samples and
from 0.09 to 0.60 ng/g for tissue samples (Supp. Table 2). Samples
below LOQ were not included in further analyses. Quantification fre-
quencies of PFASs above LOQ are presented in a heat map to illustrate
the typical exposure patterns (Fig. 1). The quantification frequencies
were highest in maternal serum samples followed by placenta and fetal
tissues. The frequencies increased by trimester in fetal organs. The most
commonly detected compound was PFOS followed by PFOA and PFNA.
These chemicals were detected above LOQ in 100% of maternal serum
samples, in 93%, 82%, and 83% of placenta samples and 76%, 70% and
53% of fetal organs, respectively (Fig. 1, Supp. Table 3). The quantifi-
cation frequencies of PFDA, PFUnA, and PFHxS in maternal serum
samples were 92%, 81%, 65%, respectively. In the placenta, these were
quantified at a frequency of 28%, 11% and 0%, respectively, and 15%,
10% and 6% in fetal organs (Fig. 1, Supp. Table 3). In fetal tissues,
PFASs were most often detected in liver and lung followed by adipose,
heart and CNS (Fig. 1, Supp. Table 3).
3.3. PFASs concentrations in maternal serum, placenta, and fetal tissue
In maternal serum, PFOS was detected in the highest concentration
(median 4.91 ng/ml; range 1.04–16.66 ng/ml), followed by PFOA
(median 1.55 ng/ml; range 0.55–7.95 ng/ml), and PFNA (median
0.55 ng/ml; range 0.14–2.9 ng/ml) in all trimesters (Fig. 2A, Supp.
Table 3). PFDA (median 0.24 ng/ml; range 0.07–1.11 ng/ml), PFUnA
(median 0.32 ng/ml; range 0.1–1.73 ng/ml), and PFHxS (median
0.31 ng/ml; range 0.08–5.23 ng/ml) were all detected at similar low
concentrations in all trimesters (Fig. 2A, Supp. Table 3). Concentrations
of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA and PFUnA were significantly positively
correlated with each other (ρ = 0.37–0.83, p < 0.05) except for PFOA
with PFUnA (Supp. Fig. 1A). Only PFOS was positively correlated with
PFHxS (ρ = 0.65, p < 0.001) (Supp. Fig. 1A). PFOS and PFNA were

 significantly higher in maternal serum from the first trimester com-
pared to the second (p < 0.001) and third trimester (p < 0.001)
(Fig. 2A). The concentration of PFUnA was higher in the first trimester
maternal serum samples compared to the third trimester cohort
(p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A).
In placenta and fetal tissues, highest concentration quantified was
PFOS (placenta median 1.24 ng/g, range 0.45–3.87 ng/g; fetal tissues
median 0.83, range 0.19–12.61 ng/g) followed by PFOA (placenta
median 0.3 ng/g, range 0.15–0.99 ng/g; fetal tissues median 0.49 ng/g,
range 0.15–3.62 ng/g) (Fig. 2B, Supp. Table 3). Concentrations of
PFNA, PFDA and PFUnA were below 0.73 ng/g in all placenta and fetal
tissues analyzed (Fig. 2B, Supp. Table 3). PFHxS was detected only in
6% of all fetal tissues but when present, concentrations were relatively
high (median 0.75 ng/g; range 0.62–1.37 ng/g). Generally, the con-
centrations of PFAS in tissues were positively correlated with maternal
serum levels (Supp. Fig. 1B). The correlations reached statistical sig-
nificance in the case of PFOS in placenta (ρ = 0.34, p < 0.05), lung
(ρ = 0.34, p < 0.05) and adipose (ρ = 0.46, p < 0.05) as well as
PFOA in placenta (ρ = 0.32, p < 0.05), liver (ρ = 0.54, p < 0.001),
lung (ρ = 0.60, p < 0.001) and heart (ρ = 0.72, p < 0.001) (Supp.
Fig. 1B). Moreover, PFNA levels in the lung was also positively corre-
lated with the maternal serum (ρ = 0.42, p < 0.05) (Supp. Fig. 1B).
The placenta and liver concentrations of PFOA were higher in third
trimester than in first trimester (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). Liver concentra-
tions of PFOA and PFNA were higher in second trimester samples than
in first trimester cohort (p < 0.01), and the liver PFOA concentration
in second trimester was also higher than in third trimester (p < 0.05)
(Fig. 2B). The lung concentration of PFOA in the second trimester was
higher compared to the first trimester (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B).
The total concentration of PFASs, or the PFAS burden, was eval-
uated. PFHxS was not included because it was not measured in first
trimester fetal tissues. In the first trimester, the highest burden was
found in fetal lung tissue with a total concentration of 3.5 ng/g PFASs
(74% PFOS, 9% PFOA, 5% PFNA, 6% PFDA, and 6% PFUnA) (Fig. 3). In
second and third trimester, fetal liver had the highest PFAS burden,
which in second trimester summed up to 3.4 ng/g (39% PFOS, 34%
PFOA, 9% PFNA, 7% PFDA, 11% PFUnA) and in third to 2.9 ng/g (47%
PFOS, 21% PFOA, 8% PFNA, 10% PFDA, 14% PFUnA) (Fig. 3). The CNS
samples had the lowest PFAS burden in all trimesters (Fig. 3). Similar
results were found in second and third trimesters samples when PFHxS
was included (Supp. Fig. 2).
3.4. Maternal characteristics and PFASs concentrations
In our cohort, there was a negative correlation between BMI and
maternal serum concentrations of PFNA (ρ = −0.26, p < 0.05) and
PFUnA (ρ = −0.3, p < 0.05). However, this correlation was not found
in the placenta and fetal organ concentrations. Maternal age correlated
positively with the following compounds: PFOS in fetal adipose
(ρ = 0.55, p < 0.05), PFOA in fetal adipose (ρ = 0.44, p < 0.05), and
PFDA in placenta (ρ = 0.49, p < 0.05) and fetal liver (ρ = 0.52,
p < 0.05). No other significant correlations between PFAS concentra-
tions, maternal age and BMI were found.
3.5. PFASs in human fetal organs in relation to maternal concentrations
Maternal serum PFAS concentrations varied between trimesters and
this could affect fetal tissue concentrations and evaluation of fetal
transfer. We therefore normalized fetal tissue concentrations (ng/g) by
maternal serum concentrations (ng/ml). These fetal tissue:maternal
serum ratios were calculated only in those cases where data (> LOQ)
for paired samples (i.e. maternal serum and corresponding placenta and
fetal tissues) were available, and where at least three independent va-
lues (i.e. individual fetuses) could be calculated. The tissue:maternal
serum ratio presented in percent showed that tissues had, in general,
lower exposure than serum (median ratios < 100%) (Fig. 4A). For
PFOS, the highest relative ratios were found in placenta and liver, and
for PFOA and PFNA, in liver and adipose (Fig. 4A). The lowest fetal
tissue:maternal serum ratios for all compounds were found in CNS
samples (Fig. 4A). The median ratios were in general higher in second
and third trimester compared to first trimester. The ratios of PFOS,
PFOA, and PFNA in placenta and liver were significantly higher in the
second and third trimesters compared to the first (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A).
The fetal lung:maternal serum ratio of PFOA and PFNA were also

 significantly higher in the second and third trimesters compared to the
first trimester (p < 0.05).
All maternal serum samples were obtained during first trimester
while tissue samples for second and third trimesters were collected after
fetal death. We therefore also calculated fetal exposures in relation to
placenta exposure, as placenta and fetal tissues represent the same
sample collection time point. The fetal tissue:placenta ratios are pre-
sented in Fig. 4B. In contrast to the tissue:serum ratios that re-
mained < 100%, the tissue:placenta percentages were clearly higher
(Fig. 4B). The tissue:placenta ratios of PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnA
were close to or above 100% indicating similar or higher exposure in
fetal organs compared to placenta (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, several tis-
sue:placenta ratios of PFOA and PFNA were highest in second trimester
samples compared to the first and third trimester. The highest fetal
tissue:placenta ratios were detected in liver and the lowest in CNS.
3.6. Accumulation of PFASs during gestation
Possible bioaccumulation of PFASs in fetal tissues across gestation
in the whole cohort and in female and male fetuses separately was
evaluated. Due to the variation in maternal serum concentrations
(Fig. 2A), fetal tissue concentrations were normalized to maternal
serum before studying associations between fetal age and PFASs con-
centrations in tissues. Accumulation in placenta and fetal tissues across
gestation was evaluated by plotting the normalized concentrations as a
function of fetal age in days. Evidence of bioaccumulation was detected
in placenta for the following compounds: PFOS (p < 0.01), PFOA
(p < 0.001), and PFNA (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5). The placenta:serum ratio
(%) of PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA increased by 0.13% (p < 0.01), 0.07%
(p < 0.001), and 0.11% (p < 0.001), respectively, for every day in-
crease in fetal age. Interestingly, the placenta:serum ratio of PFOA was
5.6% higher in male fetuses than in female fetuses (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5).
The placenta:serum ratios of PFOS and PFNA were also higher in male
fetuses than in female fetuses but the difference did not reach statistical
significance (Fig. 5). We also studied bioaccumulation in fetal tissues
but
did
not
find
statistically
significant
associations
between
normalized exposure levels and fetal age.
4. Discussion
4.1. PFASs in fetal tissues and maternal serum
The concentrations of six PFASs were analyzed in a total of 225
human fetal organs, which to our knowledge is the largest human fetal
cohort available covering all three trimesters of pregnancy. Similar
studies are difficult to carry out in experimental settings using typical
laboratory animals such as mice and rats due to the very small size of
their fetal organs and technical limitations in detection limits. The re-
liability of rodents as models for human PFAS exposure could also be
questioned due to faster elimination of PFAS compounds in rats com-
pared to humans (Chang et al., 2012; Olsen et al., 2007; Sundström
et al., 2012; Vanden Heuvel et al., 1991). The maternal serum PFAS
concentrations measured in our cohort were similar to recent reports,
with the highest PFAS concentrations being PFOS, PFOA and PFNA
(Calafat et al., 2007; Manzano-Salgado et al., 2015; Mørck et al., 2015;
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). It is interesting
to note that the maternal serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations were
higher in the first trimester cohort compared to the second and third
trimester cohorts. Because all maternal serum samples were taken
during the first trimester, this difference may be related to differences
between the cohorts where the first trimester samples were obtained
from Denmark while the second and third trimesters were from
Sweden. However, PFAS levels in Danish and Swedish pregnant women
are generally similar (Jensen et al., 2015; Mamsen et al., 2017; Ode
et al., 2013). Year of sampling could also affect the levels, but in our
study, all samples were collected within a short period of time
(2014–2016). Due to the differing maternal serum levels, we have
analyzed the fetal exposure data both as absolute concentrations and as
relative levels normalized to maternal serum. In fetal tissues, PFOS,
PFOA and PFNA were detected in 76%, 70%, and 53% of the organs,
respectively, whereas PFDA, PFUnDA, and PFHxS were detected only in
15%, 10%, and 6% of the organs, respectively, suggesting that both

 long (≥C8-based) and short chained (C6-based, i.e. PFHxS) PFASs are
transferred from mother to fetus, although with different efficiencies.
The highest fetal PFAS burden was detected in liver and lung,
suggesting that these highly vascularized tissues are prone to accumu-
late PFASs to a higher extent than other organs. In adults, lung tissue
has been found to accumulate the highest concentration of PFASs in an
evaluation of brain, liver, lung, bone and kidney samples (Pérez et al.,
2013), which the present data supports and extends. In second trime-
ster, the highest concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were detected in the
liver, which were higher than first and third trimester samples. This
could be explained by the architecture of the prenatal hepatic vascular
system where a substantial part of the oxygenated umbilical venous
blood bypasses the liver via ductus venosus and is delivered directly to
the heart from which it is distributed to the whole fetus (Collardeau-
Frachon and Scoazec, 2008). The fraction of blood flow shunted from
the liver decreases through gestation with a steep fall from 60% to 30%
in week 20–26, resulting in an increased umbilical venous flow through
the liver (Pennati et al., 2003). This may explain why PFASs accumulate
in the liver exactly during this developmental period. Interestingly, CNS
was less exposed to all evaluated PFASs than the rest of the tissues,
which may suggest that the CNS is protected from exposure by the
blood-brain barrier already during fetal development. Compared to
reported adult tissue PFAS levels, the concentrations measured in our
fetal cohort remained lower except for PFOA in liver, where levels were
similar to adults, and for PFDA, PFUnA and PFHxS in liver, where our
fetal cohort had higher concentrations than reported for adults
(Kärrman et al., 2010; Pérez et al., 2013).
4.2. Fetal age positively associated with normalized placental
concentrations of PFOS, PFOA and PFNA
Fetal age was positively associated with the placenta:serum ratios of
the three most prevalently detected substances (PFOS, PFOA and
PFNA), suggesting that these substances accumulate in the placenta
across gestation and give rise to an increased fetal burden. These ob-
servations are in line with the well-known properties of PFASs as
compounds that are persistent and bioaccumulative. Previous studies
have shown that PFOS accumulates in human amniotic fluid during
pregnancy (Jensen et al., 2012), supporting the present findings that
PFASs may accumulate in human compartments across gestation. We
did not find other significant associations between fetal age and nor-
malized tissue exposure levels. This could partly be explained by the
lower quantification frequency of the compounds in fetal tissues as
compared to placenta, leading to a lower number of paired samples (i.e.
maternal serum and tissue) available for analysis and thereby, lower
statistical power. Moreover, as discussed above, some PFASs were
present in the highest concentration during the second trimester. For
example, both absolute and normalized levels of PFOA and PFNA in
liver were the highest in the second trimester compared to the first and
third. This creates a non-linear exposure pattern, which would not show
significant association with fetal age in linear regression modelling.
Interestingly, the accumulation of PFAS in placenta was higher in
pregnancies with male fetuses compared to pregnancies with female
fetuses, suggesting that PFASs may have a sexually dimorphic accu-
mulation pattern. Higher PFAS serum concentrations in men than
women have been described in adults (Góralczyk et al., 2015;
Nakayama et al., 2005), and the present data suggest that this di-
morphic accumulation may already be found during fetal life. Inter-
estingly, sexually dimorphic adverse outcomes of PFAS exposure have
been described in the literature. For example, in rodents, prenatal ex-
posure to PFOA had a significant effect on the fetal growth and de-
velopment of males, but to a much lesser extent in females (Nakayama
et al., 2005; Negri et al., 2017). Potentially differing intrinsic exposure
levels between sexes could contribute to this phenomenon. The higher
sensitivity of male fetuses to PFOA may be related to a less efficient
elimination in males, which have also been seen in rodents (Vanden

 Heuvel et al., 1991). In humans, prenatal exposure to endocrine dis-
rupting chemicals, including PFASs, has been associated with small-for-
gestational-age birth weights particularly in boys, suggesting that males
may be more susceptible to chemical exposures than females (Lauritzen
et al., 2017). Moreover, there are differences in placental function be-
tween male and female fetuses, which could lead to differing cumula-
tive exposure over gestation (Rosenfeld, 2015). Higher placental vas-
cular resistance has been found in pregnancies with female fetuses
compared to pregnancies with male fetuses (Widnes et al., 2017), which
could affect blood flow to the fetus and create different chemical ex-
posure between sexes.
4.3. Maternal BMI, age and PFASs concentrations
The present data suggest a negative correlation between BMI and
serum PFNA and PFUnA concentrations, which supports previous
findings (Kato et al., 2014; Lauritzen et al., 2016; Mamsen et al., 2017).
However, data on BMI and PFAS concentrations are inconsistent with
reports available on both no correlations (Nelson et al., 2010) or po-
sitive correlations (Fei et al., 2007). In addition, higher concentrations
of PFOS and PFOA were observed in cord blood of both underweight
and overweight women (Apelberg et al., 2007). These data, together
with previous findings, suggest the impact of BMI on PFAS accumula-
tion in women may be modified by multiple yet unknown confounding
factors. Maternal PFAS concentrations have previously been suggested
to increase with age (Kato et al., 2014; Lien et al., 2013; Mørck et al.,
2015). The present data can confirm that maternal age may be a risk
factor for increased fetal PFAS exposure burden.
4.4. Maternal PFAS concentrations are reflected in the fetus
In maternal serum, the concentrations of PFASs were positively
correlated with each other. These correlations indicate that an exposure
pattern exist, where higher exposure to one PFAS is connected to higher
exposure to other PFASs, confirming previous findings (Mørck et al.,
2015). Further, levels of PFOS, PFOA and PFNA in the maternal sera
were positively correlated with those in placenta and corresponding
fetal tissues, indicating that maternal PFASs exposure were mirrored in
the fetus and suggesting that a high maternal PFASs burden translate to
a high fetal burden. Correlated exposure patterns has previously been
detected in maternal serum and umbilical cord serum (Chen et al.,
2017; Kato et al., 2014; Manzano-Salgado et al., 2015).
4.5. Limitations
Second and third trimester fetal tissues were obtained from IUFD
cases, which deviate from normal pregnancies as the fetus died in utero
and may not be representative of normal fetuses. However, the IUFD
cases in our cohort were well-characterized, and the main causes of
death were placental insufficiency/IUGR and infections, which may
have limited impact on PFAS concentrations as there were no sig-
nificant differences on PFAS levels found between IUGR and non-IUGR
cases (data not shown). Moreover, geographical differences may play a
role in exposure variation as the first trimester came from Denmark and
the second and third trimesters came from Sweden. While serum PFAS
concentrations have previously been measured in Danish and Swedish
pregnant women and are generally similar (Jensen et al., 2015; Mamsen
et al., 2017; Ode et al., 2013), we addressed these differences in ex-
posure by normalizing the tissue levels with the concentrations in the
maternal serum.
5. Conclusions
Here we report human fetal tissue exposure of PFASs across the
entire gestation, together with concentrations in placental and maternal
serum. These data are valuable for risk assessors, experimental
biologists, epidemiologists and ecotoxicologists working with PFASs.
The values presented may even allow extrapolation of fetal exposure of
other similar chemical compounds through in silico modelling. All
evaluated PFASs crossed the placenta and reached the fetal organs
throughout gestation, although with different penetration efficiencies.
PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA were detected in the highest concentrations
both in maternal serum, placenta, and in fetal organs. Further, these
compounds accumulated in placenta across gestation, suggesting that
exposure increases with fetal age. The highest combined PFAS exposure
in fetal organs was found in lung and liver, and the lowest in CNS
samples. Only six PFASs were included in this study and considering
that the PFAS family contains hundreds of congeners, the total PFAS
burden can, therefore, be expected to be higher. These observations call
for urgent action to better map the adverse health effects of PFAS
during fetal development to revise safe exposure levels in humans.
