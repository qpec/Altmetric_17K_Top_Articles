Purpose
Being diagnosed with cancer causes major psychological distress; however, a majority of patients
lack psychological support during this critical period. Internet interventions help patients overcome
many barriers to seeking face-to-face support and may thus close this gap. We assessed feasibility
and efficacy of Web-based stress management (STREAM [Stress-Aktiv-Mindern]) for newly di-
agnosed patients with cancer.
Patients and Methods
In a randomized controlled trial, patients with cancer who had started first-line treatment within the
previous 12 weeks were randomly assigned to a therapist-guided Web-based intervention or a wait-
list (control), stratified according to distress level ($ 5 v , 5 on scale of 0 to 10). Primary efficacy end
point was quality of life after the intervention (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
Therapy–Fatigue). Secondary end points included distress (Distress Thermometer) and anxiety or
depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Treatment effect was assessed with analyses
of covariance, adjusted for baseline distress.
Results
A total of 222 of 229 screened patients applied online for participation. Between September 2014
and November 2016, 129 newly diagnosed patients with cancer, including 92 women treated for
breast cancer, were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 65) or control (n = 64) group.
Adherence was good, with 80.0% of patients using $ six of eight modules. Psychologists spent
13.3 minutes per week (interquartile range, 9.5-17.9 minutes per week) per patient for online
guidance. After the intervention, quality of life was significantly higher (Functional Assessment of
Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue: mean, 8.59 points; 95% CI, 2.45 to 14.73 points; P = .007) and
distress significantly lower (Distress Thermometer: mean, 20.85; 95% CI, 21.60 to 20.10; P = .03)
in the intervention group as compared with the control. Changes in anxiety or depression were not
significant in the intention-to-treat population (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: mean, 21.28;
95% CI, 23.02 to 0.45; P = .15). Quality of life increased in the control group with the delayed
intervention.
Conclusion
The Web-based stress management program STREAM is feasible and effective in improving quality
of life.

INTRODUCTION
Diagnosis of cancer elicits high levels of distress in
a majority of patients,1 which is associated with de-
creased quality of life as well as diminished treatment
tolerance2,3 and potentially worse disease course.4,5
Psychosocial support for patients with cancer is ef-
fective in alleviating distress and improving quality of
life, including fatigue, the most common complaint of
patients with cancer.2,6 However, a majority of newly
diagnosed patients with cancer lack psychosocial
support because of constraints on the part of both
providers and patients.6,7 Use of the Internet, which

 has become an integral part of our lives, has the potential to change this.
At least 70% of patients with cancer use the Internet as a source of
information shortly after diagnosis,8 making it a powerful platform for
reaching these patients. Recent approaches to integrating the Internet
intopatient care rangefrompatient forumsto information sitesand even
therapeutic games.9,10 Internet programs based on cognitive behavioral
techniques with patient guidance via regular online contact with a health
care professional (ie, therapist-guided programsor guided self-help) have
emerged as particularly effective options. For a range of psychological
disorders, including anxiety disorders and depression in those without
cancer,11,12 therapist-guided online interventions seem similarly effective
as face-to-face interventions.13 The success of Web-based guided self-
help in psychological disorders9,13 coupled with the need to further
improve access to psychosocial support for patients with cancer, espe-
cially outside of inner cities with large cancer centers,6 has boosted
interest in online interventions in oncology. Numerous piloted and
ongoing trials in patients with cancer seek to define suitable indications,
formats, and settings.14 The few larger published randomized controlled
trials15-17 show encouraging results, with improvement in a number of
relevant psychosocial domains, including coping with cancer,15 sexual
functioning,16 and distress17 in breast cancer survivors.
We designed the STREAM (Stress-Aktiv-Mindern) intervention
specifically for the particularly vulnerable period immediately after
first diagnosis of cancer.18 The rationale behind this early intervention
was three-fold. First, distress in patients with cancer peaks shortly after
diagnosis,18 irrespective of cancer type. Second, the time after di-
agnosis is busy with appointments for diagnostics and treatment.
Therefore, the self-management of time and location allowed by Web-
based interventions9 might be of particular value. Third, successful
early psychosocial interventions have shown potential to affect disease
course beyond psychosocial outcomes.19 We assessed feasibility and
efficacy of our therapist-guided Web-based stress management pro-
gram STREAM for newly diagnosed patients with cancer receiving
first-line treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Details are provided in the Appendix (online only) and the published
protocol.20 We included adult patients (age $ 18 years) with newly
diagnosed cancer who started first-line treatment (either systemic treat-
ment, including chemotherapy, hormonal treatment, or targeted therapy,
or radiotherapy) no longer than 12 weeks before study registration. Pa-
tients were required to provide written informed consent, read and write in
German, and have Internet access as well as basic computer skills. The
ethics committee approved the study (EKNZ339/13). Patients were
recruited online via the STREAM Web site of STREAM. We randomly
assigned eligible patients at a ratio of one to one using blocked ran-
domization with randomly selected block sizes to an intervention group or
a wait-list control group (Fig 1). Patients were stratified according to
baseline distress using an internationally accepted cutoff of $ 5 points on
the 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) of the Distress Thermometer
(DT).21
Intervention
We developed the Web-based intervention STREAM20 based on
established stress management intervention manuals22 that incorporate
cognitive behavioral– and mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques,
which we adapted to the Web context. STREAM consists of eight modules
(Appendix Table A1, online only), which can be completed in 60 to 90
minutes each. Daily use of downloadable audio files with relaxation and
guided-imagery exercises was encouraged. Participants were asked to
complete one module per week. Our therapists provided weekly written
feedback via integrated secured e-mail.
Patients in the control group underwent their cancer treatment locally
as planned and were recontacted by the study team 8 weeks after random
assignment (T2; Fig 1). After T2 assessments, they received access to the
online program. For patients in both groups, cancer treatment was de-
termined locally, and supportive care according to local standards may also
have included face-to-face psychosocial support and psychotropic drugs.
Assessments
Assessments were conducted electronically directly within the Web-
based program via the open source application LimeSurvey at baseline (T1)
and after the intervention or waiting period (control group), respectively
(T2). In addition, 2-month follow-up (T3) was performed in both groups.
Efficacy End Points
Primary end point was quality of life at T2, assessed using the val-
idated German version of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire.23 Minimal clinically mean-
ingful differences are not well defined but have previously been set between
7 and 9 points, both as intraindividual changes and differences in
groups.19,24

Online Stress Management in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Cancer
 Secondary efficacy end points were assessed at the same points in time
and evaluated psychological distress and anxiety or depression using the
validated German versions of the National Comprehensive Cancer Net-
work DT21 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),25
respectively. Effect sizes are expressed as partial eta squared (h2
p),26 with
the following cutoffs to categorize effect sizes into small (0.01), medium
(0.06), and large (0.14), as suggested by Cohen.27
Assessments During Intervention
Usability was evaluated after the first and last module with the System
Usability Scale; scores . 70 represent good usability.28 Therapeutic alliance
between patients and the online therapist was assessed using the Working
Alliance Inventory in its short form (12 items)29 after each module. Total score
ranges from 0 to 5, and scores .3.5 have been rated as goodworking alliances.30
Statistical Analyses and Sample Size Calculation
All analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) pop-
ulation defined as all patients who were randomly assigned. The per-
protocol (PP) population included all patients who underwent the pro-
gram in the intended timeframe (ie, the time between random assignment
and T2 assessments did not exceed 16 weeks, which is twice the minimal
duration of the program). To demonstrate a 9-point difference31 in FACIT-F
total score between baseline and T2 (after 8 weeks) in the intervention group
with a statistical power of 0.80 at a significance level of .05 (two sided),
60 participants were needed in each of the two conditions.
Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy outcomes were modeled with analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA), using postscore (T2) as the dependent variable, prescore (T1)
as the covariate, and group allocation (intervention v control) as the
independent variable. ANCOVAs were further adjusted for the stratifi-
cation factor distress (DT $ 5 v , 5). For the follow-up period, score
changes from T2 to T3 were analyzed with paired t tests, separately for each
group (no between-group comparisons). Multiple imputations (n = 99) by
chained equations32 using predictive mean matching33 incorporating all
variables of the linear models underlying ANCOVA were used to impute
missing outcome values.34 To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity
analyses were conducted for all outcomes in the PP population. In ad-
dition, sensitivity analyses were carried out using other methods for
handling missing data; more specifically, complete-case analyses and last
observation carried forward analyses, as specified in the protocol,20 were
computed for all outcomes in both the ITT and PP populations.
RESULTS
We screened 229 patients, of whom 129 were randomly assigned
between September 11, 2014, and November 24, 2016 (Fig 2). All
patients received first-line cancer treatment, which they started
a median of 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 6-22 days) and
14 days (IQR, 7-20 days) after signing informed consent in the
intervention and control groups, respectively. Patients were resi-
dents of Switzerland (n = 64), Germany (n = 59), Austria (n = 5),
and the United Kingdom (n = 1). Medical, psychological, and
socioeconomic baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1 and
were balanced between the groups. All 21 patients (control group,
n = 10; intervention group, n = 11) who scored 1 point in the Beck
Depression Inventory suicide item at baseline were immediately
contacted by telephone, but they clearly distanced themselves from
acute suicidal intent.
The intervention was designed to be feasible within 8 weeks.
However, median duration of the online intervention (between
first login to module one and postintervention assessment at T2)
was 11.7 weeks (IQR, 9.1-18.6 weeks). In the intervention group,
52 patients (80.0%) used at least six modules, and 49 (75.4%)
worked with all eight modules. Our psychologists spent a median
time of 165 minutes (IQR, 127-210 minutes) for administering the
online intervention (ie, 13.3 minutes [IQR, 9.5-17.9 minutes] per
patient each week). Usability of the program was rated high, with
a mean System Usability Scale score of 87.5 (IQR, 81.2-95.0) after
module one and of 90.0 (IQR, 82.5-95.0) after module eight. As
a measure of the therapeutic relationship between patient and
online therapist, patients reported a mean score in the Working
Alliance Inventory questionnaire of 3.77 (IQR, 3.38-4.14), similar
to that of previously reported online working alliances.30
Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes are listed in Table 2
and illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. Quality of life (FACIT-F) after
the intervention (T2; the primary end point) was significantly
higher in the intervention group as compared with the control
group (ANCOVA P = .007; Table 2). With a mean increase in total
FACIT-F score of 8.59 (95% CI, 2.45 to 14.73; P = .007) in the ITT
population and of 10.71 (95% CI, 4.49 to 16.94; P = .001) in the PP
population, changes were clinically meaningful.19,24 Effect sizes
were medium27 (h2
p = 0.063 and 0.114 in the ITT and PP pop-
ulations, respectively; Table 2). Increased scores within the fatigue
(4.51; 95% CI, 1.81 to 7.22; P = .002), physical well-being (2.01;
95% CI, 0.43 to 3.59; P = .01), and functional well-being subscales
(1.53; 95% CI, 0.11 to 2.95; P = .04) were major contributors to the
increase in total FACIT-F score, whereas social well-being and
emotional well-being scores were not (Table 2.).
Distress on the VAS (scored from 0 to 10) of the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network DT was significantly lower at T2
in the intervention group as compared with the control (20.85;
95% CI, 21.60 to 20.10; P =.03). As summarized in Table 2,
anxiety and depression (HADS) after the intervention (T2) were
not significantly lower in the intervention as compared with the
control group (P = .15) in the ITT population. However, decrease
in HADS score was statistically significant in the PP population
(22.09; 95% CI, 24.03 to 20.16; P = .03). All results were
confirmed in the prespecified sensitivity analyses (Appendix Table
A2). Figure 4 shows the percentage of patients who reported any
changes in scores between baseline and T2 for all three assessment
tools.
During the 2-month follow-up period of the intervention
group (T2 to T3), quality of life (FACIT-F T2 to T3: mean, 4.69;
95% CI, 20.74 to 10.12; P = .09), distress (DT T2 to T3:
mean, 20.29; 95% CI, 21.03 to 0.44; P = .4), and mood (HADS T2
to T3: mean, 20.82; 95% CI, 22.28 to 0.65; P = .27) did not
change significantly. In the follow-up phase (ie, after T2), 51
(79.7%) of 64 patients randomly assigned to the control arm opted
to start the STREAM program. For this group of patients, T2
represents the assessments immediately before and T3 the as-
sessments immediately after the online program. In an ITTanalysis
(n = 64), quality of life increased significantly (FACIT-F T2 to T3:
mean, 10.95; 95% CI, 6.18 to 15.71; P , .001) and distress de-
creased significantly (DT T2 to T3: mean, 21.25; 95% CI, 21.95
to 20.55; P = .001) between T2 and T3. Self-reported anxiety and
depression were also lower (HADS T2 to T3: mean, 22.83; 95%
CI, 24.29 to 21.36; P , .001). Again, results were confirmed in the
prespecified sensitivity analyses (Appendix Table A3, online only).

DISCUSSION
In this randomized controlled trial, newly diagnosed patients with
cancer reported significantly better quality of life and lower distress
on the DT after participating in the therapist-guided Web-based
stress management program STREAM. Recruitment to the
STREAM study via online channels was successful, and patients in
three countries, corresponding to a geographic area twice as large
as the United Kingdom, were reached. Thus, dissemination of
psychosocial interventions beyond urban centers, where face-to-face
psychosocial interventions are available,35 can be facilitated by
a Web-based approach. The STREAM intervention was feasible in
our population of patients during a period of active treatment of
different types of cancer with good adherence; 80% of patients
worked with at least six of the eight modules.16
Although it is indisputable that quality of life matters, it is also
inherently difficult to measure.36 To ensure robust and clinically relevant
data, we rely on well-validated and standardized questionnaires.1,23,25

Online Stress Management in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Cancer
 There is no clear cutoff for clinically meaningful increases in overall
quality of life in the FACIT-F score. However, on the basis of previous
studies, changes reported in the postintervention scores of this trial were
in a range that is considered highly noticeable to patients.19,24 Quality-
of-life analyses are often complicated by a large number of missing data.
In our study, the low number of missing data (90.7% of all randomly
assigned patients completed the primary assessment at T2) and ro-
bustness of the sensitivity analyses (Appendix Tables A2 and A3), in-
crease reliability of patient-reported outcomes.
Although the primary efficacy end point of better quality of
life after the STREAM intervention was clearly met, the effect of the
intervention on distress is less clear cut. The DT is an assessment
tool that allows patients to summarize all subjective aspects of
distress in a single number (VAS, 0 to 10). In its simplicity, the DT
therefore has the advantage of covering various dimensions of
distress, including physical, functional, social, socioeconomic,
spiritual, and emotional distress.21 However, the weight that pa-
tients assign, whether consciously or not, to each dimension is not
discernible from the DTscore. In contrast, the HADS questionnaire
covers exclusively the emotional dimension of distress, but it does
so in greater depth.25 Whereas self-reported distress on the DT
was lower after STREAM, with a small to medium effect size27
(h2
p = 0.043 and 0.069 in the ITTand PP populations, respectively),
emotional distress as assessed by HADS did not change. This leads
to the hypothesis that STREAM primarily affects dimensions of
distress other than anxiety or depression. Of note, in our pop-
ulation, HADS scores at baseline were rather low (mean, 12; IQR,
7-17), whereas baseline DTscores were high (mean, 6; IQR, 5-8). It
is therefore conceivable that a potential impact of STREAM on the
emotional dimension of distress (anxiety and depression) cannot
be assessed conclusively in our population. A study tailored spe-
cifically toward patients with high baseline levels of anxiety or
depression would be more appropriate to answer this specific
question.
Although STREAM was designed for and open to all newly
diagnosed patients with cancer, women with breast cancer un-
dergoing curative treatment represented the vast majority of the
study population. This leaves uncertainty regarding generalizability

 of the results, particularly toward men and toward the palliative
setting. Women with breast cancer are known to have the largest
social media network in the cancer community, which likely
allowed for effective online recruitment. The presence of other
cancer groups in the Internet community is only emerging, with
platforms such as that created by the Movember Foundation for
men with cancer.37 Such platforms may allow for integrating more
men into future studies. If targeted specifically, men with prostate
cancer also seem to be reachable via the Internet, as shown by an
Australian self-help online program, which integrated a patient
forum called My Road Ahead.38
At baseline, before random assignment, more patients in the
control group reported face-to-face psychological support and use
of psychotropic drugs than in the intervention group, although
the number was not statistically significant. Data on the amount
of time spent face to face with local psychologists during the course
of the trial were not collected; hence, potential bias cannot be
quantified. In contrast, attention bias toward the intervention
group, possibly introduced by the time our STREAM psychologists
spent online with the patients, may have affected outcome in-
versely. Because we opted for a care-as-usual (ie, wait-list) rather
than active control, this will need to be differentiated in future
studies.
A wait-list controlled design is generally accepted to control
for the effect of time on the outcome of interest. However, the
duration of the wait and consequently the timing of assessments
(T2) for the control group are prospectively defined and rigid,
whereas the timing of assessments (T2) in the interventions
group is dependent on the duration of the intervention and
therefore more variable. Hence, time sensitivity is only partially
accounted for. This is also true for our study, where median time
between T1 and T2 was 9.4 weeks (IQR, 8.6-12.1 weeks) for the
intervention group but was shorter in the control group
(median, 8.7 weeks; IQR, 8.3-9.3 weeks). Dynamic wait-list
controlled designs have been proposed to minimize this po-
tential bias.39
Another shortcoming of our trial is that we only show
a benefit in distress and quality of life for patients early after

 diagnosis, with a limited follow-up. It is conceivable, however, that
such an early intervention19 may be of particular importance to
prevent chronification of distress.40 Whether lower distress and
increased quality of life after STREAM translate into better
treatment tolerance and favorable disease course warrants addi-
tional studies.
The unique and common feature of study participants in this
trial was a recent diagnosis of cancer. In contrast, the few reported
randomized controlled trials on online support for patients with
cancer have mainly focused on cancer survivors (ie, interventions
later in the disease trajectory). In a randomized, wait-list con-
trolled trial, breast cancer survivors (on average, 3 years after
initial diagnosis) who participated in an online program in a similar
therapist-guided format as presented here reported significantly
improved sexual functioning (the primary end point of the trial) as
compared with the wait-list control group.16 Breast cancer survivors
were also the target population in the randomized trial for the Coping
With Cancer Workbook.15 Women who participated in this Web-
based self-help program reported better self-efficacy in coping with
cancer. Overall quality of life was not reported. The BREATH (Breast

 Cancer eHealth) intervention,17 a Web-based intervention based on
cognitive behavioral techniques but without therapist guidance, led to
reduced distress in breast cancer survivors; however, it was not
sustained during the 10-month follow-up.
In conclusion, with digital natives approaching an age that
places them at risk for developing age-associated diseases, in-
cluding cancer, use of the Internet in the health care setting will
likely further increase. In this randomized trial, we found that
a Web-based, guided self-help intervention resulted in a clinically
meaningful improvement in quality of life. Our results indicate that
Web-based, guided self-help has potential to efficiently support
newly diagnosed patients with cancer.

Appendix
Patients and Methods
Patient Eligibility Criteria and Recruitment
Rationale and design of this randomized trial have been published.20 We included adult patients (age $ 18 years) with newly
diagnosed cancer who started first-line treatment (either systemic treatment, including chemotherapy, hormonal treatment, or
targeted therapy, or radiotherapy) no longer than 12 weeks before study registration. Patients were required to provide written
informed consent, read and write in German, have Internet access, and have basic computer skills. To obtain informed consent,
a therapist provided detailed information about the study via telephone and went point by point through the informed consent
form. The informed consent form was then sent to the patient, who, if in agreement, sent the signed paper form back via post mail.
The Ethics Committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland approved the study (EKNZ 339/13). The trial is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02289014).
For safety reasons, patients were assessed at baseline for suicidal tendency by the suicide item of the Beck Depression Inventory
(Green KL, et al: J Clin Psychiatry 76:1683-1686, 2015). Our online program was not designed to support suicidal patients in acute
crises; therefore, patients with a score higher than 1 were contacted by telephone and referred to immediate local support.
Information on medical history was obtained from the patients during baseline assessments and confirmed by their treating
physicians, who we contacted by e-mail or telephone.
Patient Recruitment
Patients were recruited via the public Web site of STREAM (Stress-Aktiv-Mindern). To foster recruitment, we linked and
distributed information about the trial via the following channels: links from health-related Web sites, such as cancer leagues,
cancer hospitals, and patient advocate Web sites to the public Web site of STREAM; distribution of flyers in hospitals and during
cancer conferences; communication to medical lay press; and paid advertisement via Google and Facebook.
Study Design
We randomly assigned eligible patients at a ratio of one to one using blocked randomization with randomly selected block sizes
to an intervention group or a wait-list control group (Fig 1). Patients were stratified according to baseline distress, using an
internationally accepted cutoff of $ 5 points on the 10-point visual analog scale of the Distress Thermometer.21
Intervention
We developed the Web-based intervention STREAM20 based on established stress management intervention manuals22 that
incorporate cognitive behavioral– and mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques, which we adapted to the Web context.
STREAM aims at improving intra- and interpersonal coping strategies, thereby reducing perceived stress, anxiety, and fatigue as
well as enhancing quality of life. STREAM consists of eight modules (Appendix Table A1), which can be completed in 60 to 90
minutes each. Each module starts with a short mindfulness breathing exercise followed by text-based psychoeducation, reflection
on current individual emotional status, and acquisition of coping strategies including several exercises and worksheets. Daily use of
downloadable audio files with relaxation and guided-imagery exercises was encouraged. Participants were asked to complete one
module per week. Access to the next module was provided after the weekly online feedback of a therapist. Patients who had to
interrupt the program for medical or personal reasons were regularly contacted and offered continuation. The total duration of the
program was not limited. Therapists monitored participants’ progress in the program and contacted the participants via an
integrated and secured e-mail system to provide feedback and structure. Patients could use the integrated e-mail system to contact
their therapist whenever they felt the need to and were informed that the therapist would answer within 3 working days. Whenever
patients did not log in to the program for 7 days, therapists sent an e-mail reminder.
Therapists were four female psychologists with Master’s degrees in clinical psychology and clinical experience in psycho-
oncology. Three of them were in postgraduate psychotherapy training programs, and one was a licensed psychotherapist (C.U.).
This core team was supported by seven psychologists with Bachelor’s degrees in psychology, who worked under supervision of the

Urech et al
 licensed psychotherapist. All therapists were trained by the psychological study team leaders (A.G., C.U.) in applying the STREAM
program and met for weekly discussions, with input by a medical oncologist (V.H.), to align procedures and strategies. For data
protection, the program is password protected and secured by Secure Socket Layer encryption.
Control
Patients in the control group underwent their cancer treatment locally as planned and were recontacted by the study team
8 weeks after random assignment (T2; Fig 1). After T2 assessments, they received access to the online program. For patients in both
groups, cancer treatment was determined locally, and supportive care, according to local standards, may also have included face-to-
face psychosocial support and psychotropic drugs.
Assessments
Assessments were conducted electronically directly within the Web-based program via the open source application LimeSurvey
at baseline (T1) and after the intervention or waiting period (control group), respectively (T2). In addition, 2-month follow-up
(T3) was performed in both groups. Feasibility was assessed at two different levels: feasibility of online recruitment and feasibility
for patients to participate in the STREAM program while undergoing first-line treatment. According to the study protocol,
feasibility of online recruitment was confirmed when 120 patients (ie, the number needed to assess the primary efficacy outcome)
were recruited within a 2-year period; feasibility of participation during treatment was prespecified as a descriptive end
point—more specifically, the percentage of completers’ in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, where completers’ were defined
as patients who worked with at least six of eight modules.
Efficacy End Points
Primary end point was quality of life at T2, assessed in the validated German version of the Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire.23 The first 27 items are common to all Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
(FACT) questionnaires and cover different domains of quality of life, specifically physical well-being (seven items), social well-being
(seven items), emotional well-being (six items), and functional well-being (seven items). The last 13 items focus on various aspects
of fatigue, a key aspect of quality of life in patients with cancer, particularly during active treatment.6 FACIT-F total score ranges
from 0 to 160. Higher scores represent better quality of life. Minimal clinically meaningful differences are not well defined but have
previously been set between 7 and 9 points, both as intraindividual changes and differences in groups.19,24 For our sample size
calculation, we relied on the more stringent definition of 9 points. We chose FACIT-F, rather than the distress thermometer (DT), as
primary outcome because overall well-being, reflected by the multidimensional FACIT-F questionnaire, seems clinically more
important than changes in a single domain.23 Also, FACIT-F is better validated as outcome measure than DT, which often serves as
screening tool.21
Secondary efficacy end points were assessed at the same points in time and evaluated psychological distress and anxiety and
depression using the validated German versions of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network DT21 and the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS),25 respectively. Effect sizes are expressed as partial eta squared (h2
p),26 with the following cutoffs to
categorize effect sizes into small (0.01), medium (0.06), and large (0.14), as suggested by Cohen.27 Subgroup analyses are highly
explorative and, therefore, not part of this report.
Assessments During the Intervention
Usability was evaluated after the first and last module with the System Usability Scale (SUS), where scores . 70 represent good
usability.28 Therapeutic alliance between patients and online therapist was assessed using the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) in
its short form (12 items),29 adapted with 2 additional items specific to the online context after each module. Total score ranges from
0 to 5, and scores . 3.5 have been rated as good working alliances.30
Statistical Analyses and Sample Size Calculation
R version 3.4.0 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for all analyses. All analyses were
performed in the ITT population defined as all patients who were randomly assigned. The per-protocol (PP) population included
all patients who completed the program in the intended timeframe (ie, the time between random assignment and T2 assessments
did not exceed 16 weeks, which is twice the minimal duration of the program).
To demonstrate a 9-point difference31 in FACIT-F total score between baseline and T2 (after 8 weeks) in the intervention group
with a statistical power of 0.80 at a significance level of .05 (two sided), 60 participants were needed in each of the two conditions.
We assumed normally distributed data in both groups with a standard deviation of 6 18 (Pandey M, et al: World J Surg Oncol 3:63,

Online Stress Management in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Cancer
 2005). Data preparation of all continuous dependent variables included tests for normality, homogeneity of variances, and ex-
amination of outliers.
Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy outcomes (primary end point of FACIT-F; secondary end points of DT and HADS) were modeled with analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA), using the postscore (T2) as dependent variable, the prescore (T1) as covariate, and group allocation
(intervention v control) as independent variable. ANCOVAs were further adjusted for the stratification factor distress (DT $ 5 v , 5).
Multiple imputations (n = 99) by chained equations32 using predictive mean matching33 incorporating all variables of the linear
models underlying ANCOVA were used to impute missing outcome values.34 To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity
analyses were conducted for all outcomes in the perprotocol population. In addition, sensitivity analyses were carried out using
other methods for handling missing data; more specifically, CC analyses and LOCF analyses, as specified in the protocol,20 were
computed for all outcomes on both the ITT and PP populations.
2-Month Follow-Up Analyses
For the follow-up period, score changes from T2 to T3 were analyzed with paired t tests separately for each group (no between-
group comparisons). Again, multiple imputations were used for missing data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using CC and
LOCF analyses in the ITT and PP populations.

NOTE. Results of analyses of covariance for postintervention scores (T2) with baseline scores (T1) as covariate, adjusted for stratification factor distress in FACIT-F and HADS but not in DT because this would result in
model overspecification. First column (ITT/MI): primary analyses in the ITT population with MI for missing data. Other columns: sensitivity analyses in ITT and PP populations using MI, CC analyses, and LOCF analyses
for missing data. Note that the models for the PP population are identical because there were no missing data.
