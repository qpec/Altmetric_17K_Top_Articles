SUMMARY
Objective: We aimed to compare long-term social outcomes in young adults with
childhood-onset epilepsy (cases) with neurologically normal sibling controls.
Methods: Long-term social outcomes were assessed at the 15-year follow-up of
the Connecticut Study of Epilepsy, a community-based prospective cohort study
of children with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Young adults with childhood-onset epi-
lepsy with complicated (abnormal neurologic exam findings, abnormal brain imag-
ing
with
lesion
referable
to
epilepsy,
intellectual
disability
(ID;
IQ < 60)
or
informative history of neurologic insults to which the occurrence of epilepsy
might be attributed), and uncomplicated epilepsy presentations were compared
to healthy sibling controls. Age, gender, and matched-pair adjusted generalized
linear models stratified by complicated epilepsy and 5-year seizure-free status
estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] for each
outcome.
Results: The 15-year follow-up included 361 individuals with epilepsy (59% of
initial cases; N = 291 uncomplicated and N = 70 complicated epilepsy; mean
age
22 years
[standard
deviation,
SD 3.5];
mean
epilepsy
onset
6.2 years
[SD 3.9]) and 173 controls. Social outcomes for cases with uncomplicated epi-
lepsy with ≥5 years terminal remission were comparable to controls; cases
with uncomplicated epilepsy <5 years seizure-free were more likely to be less
productive (school/employment < 20 h/week) (aOR 3.63, 95% CI 1.83–7.20) and
not to have a driver’s license (aOR 6.25, 95% CI 2.85–13.72). Complicated
cases with epilepsy <5 years seizure-free had worse outcomes across multiple
domains; including not graduating high school (aOR 24.97, 95% CI 7.49–83.30),
being un- or underemployed (<20 h/week) (aOR 11.06, 95% CI 4.44–27.57),
being less productively engaged (aOR 15.71, 95% CI 6.88–35.88), and not living
independently (aOR 10.24, 95% CI 3.98–26.36). Complicated cases without ID
(N = 36) had worse outcomes with respect to productive engagement (aOR
6.02; 95% CI 2.48–14.58) compared to controls. Cases with complicated epi-
lepsy were less likely to be driving compared to controls, irrespective of
remission status or ID.
Significance: In individuals with uncomplicated childhood-onset epilepsy presentations
and 5-year terminal remission, young adult social outcomes are comparable to those
of sibling controls. Complicated epilepsy, notable for intellectual disability, and seizure
remission status are important prognostic indicators for long-term young adult social
outcomes in childhood-onset epilepsy.

Key Points
• In seizure-free individuals with uncomplicated child-
hood-onset epilepsy presentations, young adult social
outcomes are comparable to those of sibling controls
• Complicated epilepsy, notable for intellectual disabil-
ity, and seizure remission status are important prog-
nostic indicators for long-term social outcomes in
childhood-onset epilepsy
• Healthcare providers can counsel families regarding
their child’s long-term social prognosis and should
continue to strive for seizure freedom as a treatment
goal
One half of epilepsy first occurs during childhood.1,2
Understanding the natural history of childhood-onset epi-
lepsy is imperative to improving management and provid-
ing
children,
parents,
and
families
with
prognostic
information regarding long-term health and social out-
comes. Several population-based studies in Japan, Fin-
land, The Netherlands, Canada, and the United Kingdom
have examined long-term social outcomes (educational
attainment, employment, marital or relationship status,
living arrangements, having children, pregnancy, and driv-
ing) of adults with childhood-onset epilepsy.3–20 Some of
these studies have compared the long-term social out-
comes of different epilepsy subgroups intended to reflect
the presence of epilepsy without other neurologic impair-
ments or intellectual disability (ID) to healthy controls in
order to assess the impact of epilepsy alone without other
neurologic or intellectual impairment.8–11,13,15–17,21 The
Connecticut cohort has previously utilized the term “un-
complicated epilepsy” to refer to epilepsy in people with
a normal neurologic exam and brain imaging and without
significant ID (intelligence quotient, IQ >60) or a history
of neurologic insult(s) to which the occurrence of epilepsy
might be attributed (e.g., encephalitis).22 At present there
are conflicting data as to whether adults with childhood-
onset epilepsy with an uncomplicated epilepsy presenta-
tion have poorer than expected prognosis for attaining
benchmark social outcomes compared to controls without
epilepsy. Some studies have suggested that even adults
with childhood-onset epilepsy without other neurologic or
intellectual impairment can have worse outcomes than
controls,10,11,13,15–18 whereas others have found outcomes
to be comparable.9,21
We studied young adult social outcomes in the Connecti-
cut Study of Epilepsy, a community-based cohort study of
individuals with childhood-onset epilepsy followed longitu-
dinally since time of diagnosis. At the 15-year follow-up of
this study, we compared social outcomes (educational
attainment, employment, living arrangement, marriage,
having children, pregnancy, driving, and trouble with the
law) of young adults with childhood-onset epilepsy (cases)
versus sibling controls. Our study was designed to test
whether there were differences in social outcomes between
cases and sibling controls after considering complicated
presentation (abnormal neurologic exam, abnormal brain
imaging with lesion referable to epilepsy, IQ <60, or infor-
mative history of neurologic insult(s) to which the occur-
rence of epilepsy might be attributed) and terminal seizure
remission. We hypothesized case–control differences would
not persist in cases with uncomplicated epilepsy presenta-
tions that were also ≥5 years seizure-free.
Methods
Sample
Data were collected from the Connecticut Study of Epi-
lepsy, a community-based cohort of 613 children followed
prospectively since their initial diagnosis of epilepsy
(1993–1997; Fig. 1); children were initially identified from
the practices of 16 of the 17 pediatric neurologists in the
state of Connecticut, in addition to a few adult neurologists
and pediatricians. Eligible participants had an initial diagno-
sis of epilepsy by a participating physician during recruit-
ment and the onset of seizures having occurred before the
16th birthday. Participants were followed prospectively
until study conclusion in January of 2014; details of meth-
ods, recruitment, and follow-up procedures have been
described previously.23–26 Reassessment protocols that
included evaluation of social outcomes were conducted at 9
(2002–2006) and 15 (2008–2014) years after recruitment
into the study; the 15-year (or young adult) follow-up
included assessment of 361 cases (59% of initial cases) with
epilepsy, including 291 with uncomplicated and 70 with
complicated epilepsy presentations (Fig. 1). At the 15-year
assessment, siblings within 3 years of age of cases who did
not have seizures or a neurologic disability served as con-
trols (N = 173).
Data collection
Clinical and demographic data of young adults with epi-
lepsy were obtained with a structured interview with the

 case, sibling, or parent-proxy during initial enrollment and
at the 9- and 15-year reassessments. Demographic data
regarding race/ethnicity were self- or proxy-reported by
study participants according to investigator-defined cate-
gories. Study participants were contacted every 3–4 months
via phone to provide updates regarding seizure and treat-
ment status.
Clinical and demographic variables
At initial entry into the study and again 2 years later,
three epileptologists independently classified epilepsy syn-
dromes and seizure type for each case using data from inter-
views, neurologic medical chart review, neuroimaging, and
electroencephalography. Epilepsy syndromes were catego-
rized according to recent recommendations.27 At the young
adult assessment, antiseizure medication (ASM) status was
classified as currently taking or not taking ASMs.
Prognostic variables
Cases were designated as “uncomplicated” (vs. “compli-
cated”) if they had a normal neurologic exam, normal brain
imaging, did not have clear significant intellectual disability
(i.e., IQ had to be ≥60), and had no informative history of
insults to which the occurrence of epilepsy might be attribu-
ted (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, and hypoxic-
ischemic encephalopathy); these definitions have been uti-
lized previously in prior analyses of this cohort.22 The defi-
nition
of
uncomplicated
epilepsy
is
not,
however,
synonymous with benign. Participants who did not have
neuroimaging, but met the other criteria for the uncompli-
cated designation, were grouped in the uncomplicated cate-
gory. Complicated epilepsy presentation was generally
defined early in the course of epilepsy within the first few
years after diagnosis and certainly by the time a young child
was ready to enter school. At the 15-year reassessment, ter-
minal remission status was classified based on seizure-free
duration (≥5 or <5 years), according to the date of the last-
recorded seizure.
Young adult social outcomes
At the young adult assessment, a structured interview was
used to assess social outcomes: (1) employment and educa-
tional attainment, (2) living, family arrangements, and hav-
ing children, (3) driving status, and (4) trouble with the law.

Social Outcomes in Childhood-Onset Epilepsy
 These outcomes were selected based on those studied in
other long-term studies of childhood-onset epilepsy as
described previously. Employment and educational attain-
ment outcomes included the following: (1) employed ≥20 h
per week versus <20 h per week, (2) high school graduate
(or GED equivalent) versus <high school graduate (ex-
cluded subjects ≤18 years); (3) ≥4 year college degree ver-
sus <4 year college education (if ≥21 years old), and (4)
“productive” – being in a school degree (including techni-
cal) program or employed ≥20 h per week versus neither
employed ≥20 h per week or pursuing a degree; this com-
posite variable was created to reflect that being in a school
degree program or being employed can represent compara-
ble forms of productivity for young adults.28 Living and
family arrangement outcomes included the following: (1)
never married or single versus married, living together,
divorced, or separated (excluded subjects ≤18 years), (2)
have children (excluded subjects ≤18 years), (3) for women
only, ever been pregnant, and (4) live independently (on
own or in school dormitory or military; excluded sub-
jects ≤18 years). Other outcomes were whether an individ-
ual had the following: (1) a driving license or permit (if
≥16 years), and (2) ever been in trouble with the law; sub-
jects were asked, “Have you ever been in trouble with the
law?”
Analysis
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of cases
and sibling controls were compared using generalized lin-
ear models allowing for matched pairs. For each social
outcome, we compared cases to sibling controls using a
generalized linear model with a binomial distribution that
was adjusted for age, gender, and matched pairs. For each
outcome, we compared cases overall, in addition to differ-
ent case subgroups (uncomplicated N = 291; complicated
N = 70; uncomplicated ≥5 years seizure-free N = 227;
uncomplicated <5 years seizure-free N = 64; complicated
≥5 years seizure-free N = 33; complicated <5 years sei-
zure-free N = 37) to sibling controls (N = 173). Such
analyses were controlled for the possibility that some
cases and siblings were matched and some were not. Esti-
mated adjusted odds ratios (aORs), 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs), and p-values for each dichotomous social
outcome were calculated. We also conducted a sensitivity
analyses that compared those with complicated epilepsy
who did not have intellectual disability (excluded all with
IQ <60; N = 36) to sibling controls. Because pregnancy
as an outcome can have potentially differential meaning
and impact depending on the age of pregnancy, pregnancy
models were conducted for all ages and then again includ-
ing only those cases and controls that were >18 years of
age at the time of first pregnancy. Although the aforemen-
tioned models control for the potential uneven distribution
of social outcomes in cases (matched and unmatched)
compared
to
sibling
controls,29
we
also
conducted
subgroup analyses in which the models were restricted to
case and sibling control matched pairs. We also compared
overall sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, in
addition to all social outcomes between cases with and
without a sibling control using chi-square or t-test as
appropriate. A Holm-Bonferroni correction setting an a
priori p-value of p < 0.0007 was applied to all models in
order to correct for multiple comparisons. All analyses
were performed using SAS Enterprise Miner 6.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, U.S.A.).
Informed consent procedures
Parents initially provided written informed consent and
participants provided oral or written assent as appropriate
for age. During the follow-up, as case participants reached
the age of majority, they were recruited as young adults and
provided written consent at that time. For the 15-year
assessment, young adult cases and controls provided written
informed consent. Young cases and controls <18 years pro-
vided informed assent and their parents provided informed
consent for them to participate. Parents also provided writ-
ten informed consent for cases ≥18 years of age who were
unable to provide written consent on their own. Institutional
review board approval was obtained at all participating
institutions.
Results
Sample characteristics
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of study
participants (cases and sibling controls) are shown in
Table 1. The mean total follow-up time for cases was
15.8 years (SD 1.6). The mean age of cases at follow-up
was 21.9 years (SD 3.5). There were 36 cases in the compli-
cated epilepsy subgroup that did not have ID (IQ <60). The
mean age of cases having children (at the time of the 15-year
interview) was 24 (SD 3.1) with a range of 19–30 years; the
mean age of siblings with children was 23 (SD 6.3) with a
range of 21–46. The mean age of pregnancy for female
cases was 20 years (SD 3.6); there were 13 cases ≤18 years
at the time of their first pregnancy. The mean age of preg-
nancy for female controls was 22 years (SD 3); two con-
trols were ≤18 years at the time of their first pregnancy.
Uncomplicated cases tended to have more focal self-limited
(e.g., benign rolandic epilepsy) and genetic generalized
epilepsies and less focal nonsyndromic and other early onset
severe generalized (e.g., Doose, West syndrome) or unchar-
acterized epilepsies compared to those with complicated
presentations (p < 0.0001). Uncomplicated cases were also
more likely to be seizure-free ≥5 years (p < 0.0001) and to
be off ASMs (p < 0.0001) compared to complicated
cases.22,24 Such patterns of differences in syndrome
(p < 0.0001), remission status (p < 0.003), and taking
ASMs (p < 0.001) were similarly observed for those with
uncomplicated

(N = 36). A similar pattern of results was observed for the
subgroup case–control matched pair analysis (Table S1).
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between
cases with and without matched sibling pairs were compara-
ble (Table S2).
Epilepsy and sibling control outcomes
Overall, cases were more likely to be un- or underem-
ployed (<20 h per week) (aOR 2.00; 95% CI 1.36–2.93), to
be less productively engaged (aOR 3.02; 95% CI 1.75–
5.21), and to not have a driver’s license or permit (aOR
2.60; 95% CI 1.66–4.07) compared to the sibling control
group (Table 2). Obtaining a college degree, living inde-
pendently, marital status, pregnancy and having children, as
well as trouble with the law were no different compared to
the sibling control group. These patterns were similar in the
matched case–control pairs analysis (Table S3). Overall,
cases with and without sibling controls had comparable
social outcomes (Table S4).
Uncomplicated epilepsy, seizure remission, and social
outcomes
Overall, uncomplicated epilepsy was consistently associ-
ated with comparable social outcomes to those of the sibling
control group (Table 2). Those with uncomplicated epi-
lepsy who did not achieve 5-year seizure remission,
however, were more likely not to have a driver’s license or
permit (aOR 6.25; 95% CI 2.85–13.72) and to be less pro-
ductively engaged (aOR 3.63; 95% CI 1.83–7.20), and they
were somewhat more likely to be un- or underemployed
(aOR 2.65; 95% CI 1.44–4.89), not be living independently
(aOR 2.22; 95% CI 1.20–4.13), and not to have graduated
high school (aOR 4.82; 95% CI 1.29–17.99) compared to
the sibling group (Table 3). A similar pattern of results was
found in the subgroup matched pair analysis of uncompli-
cated cases compared to sibling controls (Table S3).
Complicated epilepsy, seizure remission, and social
outcomes
In contrast, those with complicated epilepsy had worse
outcomes than the sibling control group on many outcomes
(Tables 2, 4, and 5). Those with complicated epilepsy who
were also ≥5-year seizure-free had modestly better out-
comes compared to those who were not in remission, in ref-
erence to sibling controls. Notably, cases with complicated
epilepsy in remission were more likely to have not gradu-
ated high school (aOR 16.71; 95% CI 5.46–51.12), to be less
productively engaged (aOR 7.46, 95% CI 3.06–18.17), and
to not have a driver’s license or permit (aOR 9.36; 95% CI
3.84–22.82) (Table 4). Those with complicated epilepsy
who did not achieve seizure remission, however, had worse
outcomes compared to the sibling group across nearly all
outcomes; college graduation, marital status, pregnancy,

 and trouble with the law outcomes; however, they were
comparable. A similar pattern of results was found in the
subgroup matched pair analysis of complicated cases with
sibling pairs (Table S3).
When comparing those with complicated epilepsy who
did not have ID (N = 36) to sibling controls, we found a
similar pattern of differences. Notably, those with compli-
cated epilepsy without ID were more likely to be less pro-
ductively engaged (aOR 6.02; 95% CI 2.48–14.58) and to
not have a driver’s license permit (aOR 7.39; 95% CI 3.19–
17.12) and a trend to be more likely to have not graduated
high school (aOR 5.48; 95% CI 1.49–20.12) and to be un- or
underemployed (aOR 2.79; 95% CI 1.34–5.85) compared to
sibling controls (Table 5).
When pregnancy models were rerun excluding those
≤18 years of age at the time of first pregnancy, the pattern
of results remained the same, with comparable outcomes
between cases and sibling controls.
Discussion
In this community-based prospective study, young adults
(mean
age
22)
with
childhood-onset
uncomplicated
epilepsy presentations who were ≥5 years seizure-free at the
time of 15-year follow-up had social outcomes across all
domains that were comparable to neurologically normal sib-
ling controls. In contrast, cases with uncomplicated epilepsy
who were not in remission had worse outcomes with regard
to driving and productive engagement. Unsurprisingly,
cases with a complicated epilepsy presentation had worse
outcomes compared to sibling controls across numerous
outcomes. Notably, cases with a complicated epilepsy pre-
sentation who were not in remission had worse outcomes
compared to sibling controls across multiple domains (edu-
cation, employment, productivity, independent living, and
driving). Such worse outcomes persisted for those with
complicated epilepsy without intellectual disability com-
pared to sibling controls with regard to productive engage-
ment and driving. We found no evidence that young people
with epilepsy were more likely than sibling controls to have
trouble with the law. Complicated epilepsy (which includes
intellectual disability) and long-term seizure remission sta-
tus are important prognostic indicators for long-term young
adult social outcomes in childhood-onset epilepsy.

from Finland, The Netherlands, and Canada have reported

 that adults with childhood-onset epilepsy have lower than
average educational attainment and employment compared
to healthy controls or population expected norms14 includ-
ing those with epilepsy without other neurologic impair-
ment or intellectual disability,13,15,16 and those classified
as having “idiopathic epilepsy.”4,13,15,16 In fact, even for
those without neurologic impairment and in remission,
worse employment outcomes were evident when compared
to controls in the Finnish study.16 Furthermore, young
adults with a history of childhood absence epilepsy fol-
lowed prospectively in Nova Scotia had lower levels of
educational attainment and lower rates of employment
when compared to chronic disease controls with juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).18 Similar to our findings, two
separate studies from Japan and the United Kingdom found
comparable levels of educational attainment and employ-
ment when comparing only individuals with epilepsy with
normal intelligence8 and idiopathic epilepsy21 presenta-
tions, respectively, to controls. Our observation that cases
and controls had comparable levels of high school comple-
tion may be a reflection of high levels of access to and
receipt of special education services for children with epi-
lepsy in the Connecticut Study of Epilepsy, with nearly
half of cases with uncomplicated epilepsy presentations
receiving such services.30 Such outcomes may also reflect
changing trends and times, in which persons with disabili-
ties have potentially experienced greater benefits and less
stigma from improving social, educational, and occupa-
tional resources afforded by measures such as the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1990.2
Our finding that young adults with epilepsy were less
likely to live independently compared to their healthy sib-
lings was restricted to those with complicated epilepsy not
in 5-year remission, and with a trend for those with uncom-
plicated epilepsy not in remission. Similarly, fewer than
expected lived independently compared to the general
Dutch population if they were still on ASMs and had a “re-
mote symptomatic” epilepsy (akin to our concept of “com-
plicated”).14
Only
13%
of
those
with
symptomatic
generalized epilepsy followed prospectively in Nova Scotia
lived independently.3 Of note, we found that cases with
complicated epilepsy without intellectual disability had
comparable independent living outcomes compared to sib-
ling controls, suggesting that both remission status and
intellectual disability in persons with epilepsy are important
prognostic factors associated with independent living. Our
finding that young adults with epilepsy had social outcomes
comparable to those of their sibling controls with regard to
marital status is in contrast with findings from other stud-
ies.8,12,14,16 This finding, however, may reflect that fact that
our sample includes a cohort with younger adults (mean age
22) compared to other previously studied population-based
cohorts alongside a trend over time for a later age of
marriage in the United States.
Although we found that young adults with childhood-
onset epilepsy did not have any greater trouble with the law
compared to their sibling controls, we do acknowledge that
our question assessing trouble with the law was open-ended
leaving room for interpretation; it did not necessarily mean
that individuals had a formal criminal conviction. In the
Nova Scotia study, 2% of children with epilepsy and a nor-
mal IQ4 and 7% of those with idiopathic generalized epi-
lepsy
with
generalized
tonic–clonic
seizure
types20
followed
prospectively
reported
criminal
convictions,
respectively, although there were no differences observed
between those with absence epilepsy compared to those
with JRA.18 We did find that cases with complicated epi-
lepsy (irrespective of remission status or presence of ID)
and those with uncomplicated epilepsy that were not in 5-
year remission were less likely to drive compared to their
sibling controls. In the Turku, Finland study, driving rates
were similar for those with epilepsy with normal intelli-
gence in remission and off ASMs when compared to con-
trols,16 whereas individuals without remission reported
more driving restrictions compared to those in remission in
the Dutch study at 15-year follow-up.9
We acknowledge several limitations. Although we could
assess 15-year outcomes in nearly 60% of our original sam-
ple, we recognize that approximately 40% were not in this
follow-up cohort. The epilepsy characteristics including age
of onset, gender, and proportion of certain well-recognized
forms of epilepsy observed in this community-based cohort
are highly comparable to other population-based studies31;
however, our sample is predominantly Caucasian and
recruited from the state of Connecticut only and thus may
not be nationally representative of all young adults with
childhood-onset epilepsy. Although we were unable to
assess parental socioeconomic status using metrics of paren-
tal income or wealth, we suspect that this sample of children
(now adults) came from greater economic means compared
to other population-based samples. Furthermore, we have
previously devised the terminology of complicated and
uncomplicated epilepsy status as a means to separately
assess individuals with epilepsy without other significant
neurologic or intellectual disability utilizing data from mul-
tiple sources including neurologic exam, advanced brain
imaging, neurocognitive testing, and neurologic medical
history.22 These definitions, however, are not consistent
across other prospectively followed childhood-onset epi-
lepsy cohorts, making direct comparisons between cohorts
difficult; such cohort differences may, in part, explain some
dissimilarities in our findings. Finally, we acknowledge that
some of the differences in outcomes in the complicated
group compared to sibling controls are associated with our
inclusion of individuals with moderate to severe intellectual
disability (IQ <60); when we excluded those with ID from
the complicated group we did, however, find that differ-
ences in productive engagement and driving, did persist. In

Social Outcomes in Childhood-Onset Epilepsy
 uncomplicated group may have been in part due to those
individuals with focal self-limiting epilepsy etiology (e.g.,
benign rolandic epilepsy) all of whom were in terminal
remission.
Although young adults with epilepsy had overall poor
social outcomes related to employment, being productively
engaged in school or work, and driving, those with an
uncomplicated presentation who were at least 5 years sei-
zure-free had social outcomes comparable to neurologically
normal sibling controls. Young adults with a complicated
epilepsy presentation had worse outcomes across numerous
domains, with worse outcomes notably for those not in sei-
zure remission. Complicated epilepsy, notable for intellec-
tual disability, and seizure remission status are important
prognostic indicators for long-term young adult social out-
comes in childhood-onset epilepsy. Because complicated
epilepsy presentations were often characterized by signifi-
cant intellectual disability, it is not surprising that such cases
had worse long-term social outcomes. However, insofar as
the factors that contribute to complicated presentations of
epilepsy are largely knowable early in the course of epi-
lepsy, our results suggest that epilepsy healthcare providers
can counsel parents early regarding their child’s long-term
social prognosis as it pertains to complicated status. Further-
more, given the association of social outcomes with later
seizure remission status, patients and families should con-
tinue to work with providers over time, particularly as chil-
dren transition into adulthood, to strive for seizure freedom
as a continued long-term treatment goal.
