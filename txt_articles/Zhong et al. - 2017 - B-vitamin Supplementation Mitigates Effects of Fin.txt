Ambient fine particle (PM2.5) pollution triggers acute cardiovascular events. Individual-level preventions 
are proposed to complement regulation in reducing the global burden of PM2.5–induced cardiovascular 
diseases. We determine whether B vitamin supplementation mitigates PM2.5 effects on cardiac 
autonomic dysfunction and inflammation in a single-blind placebo-controlled crossover pilot trial. 
Ten healthy adults received two-hour controlled-exposure-experiment to sham under placebo, PM2.5 
(250 μg/m3) under placebo, and PM2.5 (250 μg/m3) under B-vitamin supplementation (2.5 mg/d folic 
acid, 50 mg/d vitamin B6, and 1 mg/d vitamin B12), respectively. At pre-, post-, 24 h-post-exposure, 
we measured resting heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) with electrocardiogram, and 
white blood cell (WBC) counts with hematology analyzer. Compared to sham, PM2.5 exposure 
increased HR (3.8 bpm, 95% CI: 0.3, 7.4; P = 0.04), total WBC count (11.5%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 24.0%; 
P = 0.04), lymphocyte count (12.9%, 95% CI: 4.4%, 22.1%; P = 0.005), and reduced low-frequency 
power (57.5%, 95% CI: 2.5%, 81.5%; P = 0.04). B-vitamin supplementation attenuated PM2.5 effect 
on HR by 150% (P = 0.003), low-frequency power by 90% (P = 0.01), total WBC count by 139% 
(P = 0.006), and lymphocyte count by 106% (P = 0.02). In healthy adults, two-hour PM2.5 exposure 
substantially increases HR, reduces HRV, and increases WBC. These effects are reduced by B vitamin 
supplementation.
Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution contributes to 3.7 million premature deaths per year worldwide, 
predominantly through acute effects on the cardiovascular system1. Indeed, PM pollution is the most frequent 
trigger for myocardial infarction at the population level2. Even at levels below the current National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards (NAAQS), associations of PM2.5 exposure with increased cardiovascular risk have been found 
in sensitive individuals3,4. Moreover, many urban areas outside of North America continue to have elevated levels 
of PM2.5 pollution1,5. Reducing the global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to PM2.5 pollution requires 
defined options for individual-level prevention that complement regulatory measures4.

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV), reflecting a perturbation in autonomic function6,7, is a sensitive marker 
that changes rapidly in response to PM2.5 exposure3. It represents a primary pathophysiologic intermediate that 
may proceed PM-related adverse cardiovascular events4. In the Normative Aging Study, we found associations of 
reduced HRV with short-term PM2.5 exposure that were limited to subjects with lower intakes of vitamin B6 or 
B12 and were abrogated in those with higher intakes6. These findings suggest that B vitamins provide protection 
against the effect of PM2.5 on the autonomic nervous system.
Previous epidemiologic studies have implicated B vitamin levels (folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12) in CVD sus-
ceptibility8,9. However, to date, the results from randomized clinical trials do not support the benefit of B vitamin 
supplementation for CVD prevention10–15. Recent studies suggest that B vitamins may minimize health effects 
of environmental stressors through their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties6,16. In animal models, B 
vitamin supplementation has been successfully used to curb oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic pheno-
type change due to environmental stressors17,18. However, no clinical trial has yet investigated whether B vitamin 
supplementation alters the biologic response to ambient air pollution exposure.
To the best of our knowledge, we established the first trial to evaluate whether B vitamin supplementation 
can attenuate the acute autonomic effects of PM2.5 using a single-blind crossover intervention with controlled 
exposure to fine concentrated ambient particles (fine CAP, i.e., PM2.5) in ten healthy adults. We investigated the 
PM2.5 effect on HRV and, because of the central role of inflammation in modulating the cardiovascular effects of 
PM2.5, on total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts, as well as the potential for B vitamins to counteract 
these effects.
Results
Study population and exposure levels. 
As previously described19, all volunteers (baseline characteristics 
described in Supplementary Table 1) completed three controlled exposure experiments (July 2013 to February 
2014) (Fig. 1). The baseline resting HR ranged from 43.0 to 74.0 bmp (median, 58.9 bpm), and did not vary sub-
stantially by age, gender, race, or being overweight.
The target PM2.5 concentrations were controlled by design; however, there was some variations in the actual 
PM2.5 concentration (Supplementary Table 2). Among all controlled exposures to PM2.5, the concentration varied 
from 100.6 to 287.5 μ 
g/m3 (median, 234.0 μ 
g/m3). Previous studies using the same exposure facility reported 
minimal PM2.5 concentration in medical air (median, 0.0 μ 
g/m3; interquartile range, 2.40 μ 
g/m3)20. No significant 
difference in PM2.5 concentration existed between exposure 2 and 3 (P = 
 0.38). During the study period, the 7-day 
moving average of ambient PM2.5 level was 9.30 ± 0.36 μ 
g/m3 in the study area.
Plasma concentrations of B vitamins. 
Four-week B vitamin supplementation significantly increased 
plasma concentrations of folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12 (P = 
 0.02, P = 
 0.004, P = 
 0.01; respectively), while placebo 
had no effect (P = 0.82, P = 0.75, P = 0.42, respectively) (Supplementary Table 3).
Effect of PM2.5 on heart rate (HR), HRV, and WBC without B vitamin supplement. 
In the absence 
of B vitamin supplement, HR increased (Fig. 2) and HRV decreased (Fig. 3) after PM2.5 exposure. Compared 
to sham, two-hour PM2.5 exposure was associated with 3.8 bpm (95% CI, 0.3 bpm, 7.4 bpm; P = 
 0.04) higher 
resting HR. PM2.5 exposure was associated with 33.6% (95% CI, − 
2.1%, 56.8%; P = 
 0.06), 57.5% (95% CI, 2.5%, 
81.5%; P = 
 0.04), and 35.9% (95% CI, − 
7.5%, 61.8%; P = 
 0.09) lower standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), 
low-frequency (LF) power, and low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio compared to sham, respectively 
(Supplementary Table 4). At 24 h post-exposure, we did not observe any significant effect of PM2.5 exposure on 
HR or HRV (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5).
Exposure to PM2.5 increased total and differential WBC counts, compared to sham (Fig. 5). Immediately after 
exposure, PM2.5 was non-significantly associated with 9.9% (95% CI, − 
0.8%, 21.8%; P = 
 0.07) and 10.0% (95% 
CI, − 
1.7%, 23.2%; P = 
 0.09) higher total WBCs and lymphocytes. Twenty-four hours later, PM2.5 exposure was 
significantly associated with 11.5% (95% CI, 0.3%, 24.0%; P = 
 0.04) and 12.9% (95% CI, 4.4%, 22.1%; P = 
 0.005) 
higher total WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, respectively (Supplementary Table 6).
B vitamin supplementation attenuated the effects of PM2.5. 
After four-week B vitamin supple-
mentation, the associations of PM2.5 with outcomes, for example, post-exposure HR (Pintervention = 
 0.003), HRV 
(Pintervention = 
 0.01 for LF), and total WBC count (Pintervention = 
 0.008), were significantly attenuated. The effect of 
PM2.5 on HR was no longer significant with B vitamin supplementation (− 
1.9 bpm, 95% CI, − 
4.6 bpm, 0.7 bpm; 
P = 
 0.14) (Fig. 2). Likewise, B vitamin supplementation reduced the effect size of PM2.5 by 90% for LF and 96%

for LF/HF ratio (Fig. 3). Further, exposure to two-hour PM2.5 was associated with 5.8% (95% CI, − 
127.8%, 
61.0%; P = 
 0.89; Pintervention = 
 0.01) and 1.6% (95% CI, − 
55.0%, 37.5%; P = 
 0.94; Pintervention = 
 0.06) lower LF and 
LF/HF ratio, respectively, with B vitamin supplementation (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, although 
non-significant, B vitamin supplementation attenuated the PM2.5 effect by 57% on SDNN, 97% on square root of 
the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (rMSSD), 77% on proportion of successive NN intervals 
with differences > 
50 msec (pNN50), and 81% on HF (Fig. 3).
The attenuation of the PM2.5-HR or PM2.5-HRV relationship (Pintervention = 
 0.003, 0.01, 0.03 for HR, rMSSD, and 
PNN50, respectively) by B vitamins remained significant at 24 h post-exposure (Fig. 4).
The associations of PM2.5 with post-exposure total and differential WBC counts were also weakened by 
 
B vitamin supplementation (Fig. 5). Compared to sham, effects of PM2.5 on WBCs were non-significant in the 
presence of B vitamin supplementation: two-hour PM2.5 exposure was associated with a − 
1.7% (95% CI, − 
9.6%,

(Supplementary Table 6). In summary, B vitamin supplementation reduced the PM2.5 effect by 117%, 134%, 76%, 
and 75% on total WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, respectively (Fig. 5).
Likewise, B vitamin supplementation attenuated the PM2.5 effects on total and differential WBC counts at 
24 h post-exposure (Pintervention = 
 0.006, 0.01, 0.02, 0.61 for total WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte) 
(Supplementary Table 6). B-vitamin supplementation significantly reduced the PM2.5 effect by 139% on total 
WBC, 165% on neutrophil, and 106% on lymphocyte (Fig. 5).
Sensitivity analysis. 
We dealt with potential influence by season by adjusting for spring/summer/fall/win-
ter in all models. In a sensitivity analysis, we additionally adjusted for seasonality (defined using sine and cosine 
functions)21 to further address residual confounding, and our conclusions remained the same (data not shown). 
We observed no significant changes in dietary intake of folic acid, vitamins B6, and B12 during the study period, 
therefore confounding due to dietary B vitamins was minimized (Supplementary Table 7). To rule out the pos-
sibility that the observed change in HRV was partially due to HR fluctuation, we adjusted for HR in PM2.5-HRV 
analysis and obtained similar results (data not shown). In addition, we conducted sensitivity analysis using 
HR-normalized HRV measurements and our conclusions were consistent (Supplementary Table 8).
Discussion
This single-blind crossover intervention trial with controlled exposure experiments found that two-hour expo-
sure to concentrated ambient PM2.5 (250 μ 
g/m3) has substantial physiologic impacts on HR, HRV, and WBCs 
among healthy adults. Further, we demonstrated that these effects are nearly abolished with four-week B-vitamin 
supplementation.
With ambient PM2.5 levels far exceeding NAAQS in many urban megacities worldwide22, pollution regulation 
remains the backbone of public health protection against its cardiovascular health effects. Indeed, improved car-
diovascular health, reflected in reduced morbidity and mortality, has been documented as pollution levels have 
decreased in the U.S23. Nevertheless, even in U.S. cities complying with NAAQS, cardiovascular effects of particle 
pollution have been observed, with no evidence for a threshold for effect in sensitive individuals3,4,6,22. Thus, the 
medical and public health communities have sought adjunct personal measures that might complement regula-
tion in reducing the cardiovascular risk of pollution in sensitive people24.
Previous studies suggested that dietary supplementations with vitamins C, vitamins E, or polyunsaturated 
fatty acids might protect against short-term air pollution-induced adverse cardiopulmonary responses25–27. In 
a randomized double-blinded controlled exposure study, Tong and coauthors successfully demonstrated that a 
four-week fish oil supplementation attenuated CAP-induced HRV reductions26. Our choice to assess the potential 
protective benefits of B vitamin supplementation against PM-induced cardiac autonomic dysfunction and inflam-
mation was motivated by the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunoepigenetic effects of B vitamins28,29. 
Recent epidemiological and in vivo studies suggest that B vitamins might be particularly protective against air 
pollution-induced cardiovascular effects—as it was demonstrated to modulate the epigenetic and inflammatory 
signaling pathways linking air pollution, intermediate biomarkers, and cardiovascular outcomes6,17,27,28. For 
example, folic acid and vitamin B6 lower chemokine release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and circu-
lating levels of pro-inflammatory molecules28,29, indicating reduced risk for acute cardiovascular events such as 
stroke. In mice model, folic acid protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear factor-kβ 
 pathway activa-
tion and adverse birth outcomes16. Furthermore, B vitamins are essential nutrients involved in the biochemical 
process of DNA methylation3. In the presence of air pollution, adequate B vitamin intake ensures proper epige-
netic status of leukocytes to warrant proper immuno-regulation, and prevents excessive oxidative damage to the 
cardiovascular system3. Although the results of randomized controlled trials on supplementation with folic acid, 
vitamin B6 and B12 do not support benefits of B vitamins for either primary or secondary CVD prevention12,14,15,30, 
the mentioned interactive biological properties of B vitamins render it a promising preventive strategy to min-
imize the cardiovascular damage due to ambient PM2.5 pollution. However, no prior clinical investigation has 
tested whether B vitamin supplementation can be used to guard the cardiovascular system from the adverse 
health effects of PM2.5.
Our findings of a primary autonomic effect of PM2.5 are consistent with previous human controlled exposures 
studies31–34, showing that short-term PM2.5 exposure perturbed cardiorespiratory autonomic function as reflected 
in increased HR and reduced HRV6. Immediately following two-hour exposure to ambient concentrated PM2.5, 
we observed a substantial increase in resting HR and a reduction in LF power. These results indicate a consistent 
reduction in HRV across five measures – which reflects the adverse pathophysiological modulations in cardiac 
autonomic control by PM2.5 exposure.
PM2.5 is a potent trigger for leukocyte-mediated inflammation, which is proposed as the key mechanism 
underlying the pathological modulation of the cardiovascular system by PM2.5 exposure4. Our data support this 
hypothesis by showing that two-hour PM2.5 exposure triggers increased total WBC count and lymphocyte count 
at 24-hour post exposure. In healthy adults, PM pollution increases the number of neutrophils and lymphocytes 
in alveolar lavage and peripheral blood35. While the underlying biological mechanism remains unclear, in vivo 
studies suggest that PM stimulates bone marrow via alveolar macrophages-mediated cytokine signaling, leading 
to accelerated release of immature leukocytes in to the circulation36,37.
Twenty-four hours after exposure, the effect of PM2.5 on HR and HRV weakened. However, PM2.5 exposure 
remained significantly associated with higher numbers of total WBCs and lymphocytes. Taken together, although 
the acute physiological responses due to PM2.5 exposure peak might be reversible, the pro-inflammatory effects

of PM2.5 appears to be sustained beyond 24 hours and represent a biomarker that could have clinical relevance to 
sensitive individuals in a community setting4.
For the first time, our trial provides evidences demonstrating the unique preventive benefits of B vitamin 
administration in the context of air pollution: B vitamin supplementation can diminish the acute effects of PM2.5 
on cardiac autonomic dysfunction and inflammatory markers. These findings are in agreement with our results 
from the Normative Aging Study6 – a population with average B vitamins intakes well above the standard dietary 
references – in which short-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower HRV (7.1% reduction in SDNN per 
10 μ 
g/m3 increase in PM2.5), and the adverse effect of PM2.5 was limited to subjects with lower (< 
median) intakes 
of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, or methionine.
This study has several strengths, including its crossover design with controlled exposure experiments – which 
simulate conditions similar to urban air pollution peaks, while allowing for control of exposure and treatment 
at the individual level. The Harvard ambient particle concentrators do not affect the concentration of gaseous 
pollutants, therefore, minimizing the confounding due to gaseous co-pollutants such as ozone and sulfur dioxide. 
All exposure experiments were conducted at the same time of day to eliminate impacts of diurnal variation. We 
adjusted for time-varying factors including season, chamber temperature and humidity to minimize their influ-
ence on the observed associations, while time invariant factors are controlled by the crossover design.
We acknowledge several limitations, however. We determined the number to recruit in the current study using 
power estimates that are penalized by conservative Bonferroni’s adjustments for multiple HRV indexes. Although 
our sample size is comparable to previous controlled CAP exposure studies, which succeeded in demonstrating 
health effects of CAP exposure32,33,38,39, our study is evidently limited in power to detect small effects with only 10 
subjects (30 controlled exposure experiments).
Further, treatment sequence could not be randomized due to the long half-life of B vitamins, therefore might 
be subject to confounding by period or ordering effects. For example, the first exposure experiment is likely to 
produce more distress on volunteers because of psychological effect. We intentionally provided medical air as the 
first exposure experiment; therefore the psychological effect is expected to bias the effect of PM2.5 towards the 
null. The short study duration with four-week intervals between exposure experiments also reduced the impact 
of temporal trends. In addition, we contrasted the post- vs pre-exposure status to ascertain all outcome measure-
ments, which is expected to be less prone to confounding due to temporal trend than the absolute values. While 
residual confounding is possible, considering the magnitude of our effect estimates and the consistency across 
different HRV index, it is unlikely that the observed association reflected bias from confounding. The crossover 
design of the present study was not complete, as we had no arm of B vitamin supplementation with sham expo-
sure. Therefore, separating the direct effect of B vitamins on cardiac autonomic dysfunction and inflammation 
(i.e., in the absence of air pollution) from the combined effect of both B vitamins and air pollution can be sta-
tistically challenging and requires strong assumptions. In addition, our study was limited to healthy adults from 
lightly polluted urban environment, therefore our findings might not be generalizable to populations that are at 
higher risk for pollution-induced cardiovascular effects (eg, children, older adults, individuals with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease, and individuals residing in heavily polluted areas).
Apart from avoiding exercising outdoors at peak pollution times, sensitive individuals have limited options 
to reduce exposure and associated cardiovascular risk. While regulation is the backbone of prevention, residual 
risk remains for those who are sensitive, and high exposures are, unfortunately, the rule still in many megacities 
throughout the world. The present study provides novel experimental evidence showing that an ambient PM2.5 
exposure peak has unfavorable effect on cardiac autonomic function and the immune system, which can be coun-
teracted by B vitamin supplementation. Our project inaugurates a line of research for the development of preven-
tive pharmacological interventions using B vitamins to contain the health effects of air pollution. Future studies 
will identify the precise pathophysiological processes of PM-induced cardiovascular responses and inflammation, 
as well as the mechanistic pathway underlying the protective effect of B vitamins.
Methods
Study population and sample size. 
We recruited ten healthy, 18–60-year-old, non-smoking volunteers 
who were not on any form of B vitamin supplementation or other medication, from the University of Toronto St. 
George campus and surrounding area (downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada)19. The number to recruit was deter-
mined through power calculation based on a 2-sided alternative at α 
 = 
 0.05/6 = 
 0.0833 to reflect a Bonferroni 
correction for multiple testing (six HRV indexes). We estimate 80% (90%) power to detect correlations with 
absolute magnitude of 0.40 (0.45) in ten volunteers with two repeated measures, which is less than or equal to 
the magnitude of the correlations reported in our previous studies33,38,39. The trial and experimental protocols 
were approved by all participating institutional review board (University of Toronto, St. Michael’s Hospital, and 
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health) and registered (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01864824, date of registration: 
May 8, 2013). All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All vol-
unteers provided written informed consent. The conduct of the trial was monitored by an independent data and 
safety monitoring committee.
Study design. 
We conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled crossover pilot trial (Fig. 1)19 with controlled 
exposure experiments (July 2013 to February 2014). A two-hour sham exposure experiment (exposure one, 
particle-free medical air) was included to provide baseline data. All volunteers then received placebo for four 
weeks preceding the two-hour exposure experiment to concentrated ambient PM2.5 (exposure two, 250 μ 
g/m3). 
After exposure two, we administered B vitamin supplements for four weeks before the next two-hour exposure 
experiment to PM2.5 (exposure three, 250 μ 
g/m3). The four-week placebo or B vitamin treatment also served as 
washout periods between exposure experiments to diminish the carryover effect of PM2.5 exposure19,40, while 
minimizing the impact of seasonality and temporal trend on the source and composition of the concentrated

ambient PM2.5. To ensure comparable conditions across all controlled exposure experiments to PM2.5, the present 
study could not randomize on the treatment (placebo vs B vitamins) sequence because vitamin B12 has a bio-
logical half-life longer than four months41. Study volunteers were blinded to exposure and treatment allocation. 
Based on our symptom survey, none of the volunteers was able to discern the exposure type for any exposure 
experiment.
Exposure facility. 
Harvard fine particle concentrators with a dilution control system delivered 
target-concentration PM2.5
42, and the sham exposures with medical air were generated as previously described38. 
The concentrated ambient PM2.5 air stream was delivered directly to the volunteer who was seated inside a 4.9 m3 
(1.1 × 
 1.9 × 
 2.0 m) Lexan enclosure, at rest and breathing normally via an “oxygen type” facemask covering his/
her nose and mouth. During each exposure experiment to PM2.5, particles were collected on Teflon filters for 
monitoring gravimetric determination of PM2.5 exposure mass concentration (μ 
g/m3).
Folic acid, vitamin B6 and B12 supplement. 
During three four-week periods, we administered one B 
vitamin tablet (2.5 mg folic acid, 50 mg vitamin B6, and 1 mg vitamin B12) or placebo daily. The placebo tab-
lets contain identical non-medical ingredients as the B vitamin tablets. Tablet preparation and packaging were 
done by an external lab (Jamieson Laboratory, Toronto, Canada). The label coding was blinded to the volunteers. 
We monitored volunteers’ plasma folic acid and vitamin B6 and B12 levels before each exposure experiment. A 
self-administered validated semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to assess dietary B vita-
min intake at the first and last visits to rule out potential impact from diet.
Heat rate, heart rate variability, and WBC measurement. 
We measured supine resting HR and HRV 
as the primary outcome before (pre-exposure) and after (immediately post-exposure and 24 h post-exposure) 
each exposure experiment, using high-resolution (1 KHz sample rate) digital 12-lead Holter electrocardiogram 
monitors (H12 + 
 recorder, Mortara Instruments, Milwaukee, WI). We extracted ten-minute HRV readings on 
time domain outcomes (SDNN, rMSSD, pNN50), and frequency domain outcomes (LF power, HF power, and 
LF/HF ratio). We discarded the first three minutes and the last two minutes during the ten-minute recording and 
analyzed the remaining five-minute electrocardiogram data using standardized techniques43. SDNN represents 
the total variability. PNN50, rMSSD, and HF are sensitive to high-frequency heart rate fluctuations and are con-
sidered as measures of cardiac vagal tone modulation, while LF power is linked to the activity of both sympathetic 
and parasympathetic nervous system.
Blood samples (pre-, post-, and 24 h post-exposure) were obtained in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
vacutainer tubes, stored at 4 °C, and subsequently processed in a local laboratory within two hours for total and 
differential WBC counts using the Technicon H-1 automated hematology analyzer (Technicon Instruments Corp,

We conducted graphical explorations and log10-transformed the HRV measures and 
WBC counts to improve normality and stabilize the variance. We examined the linear relationships between HR/
HRV/WBC and all independent variables and covariates, and observed no deviation from linearity. For the ease 
of interpretation, we scaled the effect estimates to the percent changes in HRV and WBC in all models.
We used linear mixed-effects models with a robust/sandwich estimator for the variance (Model 1) to account 
for within-subject correlation in the outcome measures. Random intercepts were assigned to each subject. In all 
models, we adjusted for covariates with potential influences on HR, HRV, and WBC – selected based on prior 
knowledge and the existing literature – season (fall/winter/spring/summer), chamber temperature, and relative 
humidity.

In the above model, Yij was the change in HR, HRV, or WBC (i.e., Δ 
HR = 
 post-exposure HR – pre-exposure 
HR) for participant i at exposure occasion j. β0 was the overall intercept, and bi was the separate random intercept 
for subject i with, bi ~ N(0, ϴ), εij ~ N(0, σ 
2). X1ij was a binary variable indicating exposure to PM2.5 or medical air. 
X2ij was a binary variable indicating placebo or B vitamin supplementation. X3ij–Xpij were the covariates, for par-
ticipant i at measurement j. The main effect of B vitamin supplementation was not included in the model, given 
volunteers did not receive any medical air exposure while on B vitamin supplementation. β1 represents the effect 
of PM2.5 exposure without B vitamin supplementation and β1 + β2 represents the effect of PM2.5 exposure with B 
vitamin supplementation. β2 thus represents the intervention effect of B vitamin supplementation (i.e, the attenu-
ation of PM2.5 effect due to B vitamin supplementation). A two tailed value of P ≤ 
 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. We represent the P value for the intervention effect, β2, by Pintervention. Analyses were performed using 
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC).
