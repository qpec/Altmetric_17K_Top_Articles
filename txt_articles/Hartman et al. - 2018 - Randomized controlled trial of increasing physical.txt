BACKGROUND: Increasing physical activity can improve cognition in healthy and cognitively impaired adults; however, the benefits
for cancer survivors are unknown. The current study examined a 12-week physical activity intervention, compared with a control con-
dition, on objective and self-reported cognition among breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Sedentary breast cancer survivors were
randomized to an exercise arm (n 5 43) or a control arm (n 5 44). At baseline and at 12 weeks, objective cognition was measured
with the National Institutes of Health Cognitive Toolbox, and self-reported cognition using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measure-
ment Information System scales. Linear mixed-effects regression models tested intervention effects for changes in cognition scores.
RESULTS: On average, participants (n 5 87) were aged 57 years (standard deviation, 10.4 years) and were 2.5 years (standard devia-
tion, 1.3 years) post surgery. Scores on the Oral Symbol Digit subscale (a measure of processing speed) evidenced differential
improvement in the exercise arm versus the control arm (b 5 2.01; P <.05). The between-group differences in improvement on self-
reported cognition were not statistically significant but were suggestive of potential group differences. Time since surgery moderated
the correlation, and participants who were �2 years post surgery had a significantly greater improvement in Oral Symbol Digit score
(exercise vs control (b 5 4.00; P <.01), but no significant improvement was observed in patients who were >2 years postsurgery
(b 5 21.19; P 5.40). A significant dose response was observed with greater increased physical activity associated with objective and
self-reported cognition in the exercise arm. CONCLUSIONS: The exercise intervention significantly improved processing speed, but
only among those who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past 2 years. Slowed processing speed can have substantial
implications for independent functioning, supporting the potential importance of early implementation of an exercise intervention
among patients with breast cancer. Cancer 2018;124:192-202. V

INTRODUCTION
Problems with cognition are common among breast cancer survivors, with estimates suggesting that up to 75% of patients
experience deficits that can last for years after the end of cancer treatments.1-3 Research suggests that cancer-related cogni-
tive impairments are not solely because of chemotherapy or other treatments2,4,5 but may result from common risk factors
for the development of both cancer and age-related cognitive decline.3,6 In addition, such impairment may be a symptom
of accelerated aging caused by cancer treatments and associated psychological stress.2,7,8 Although the prevalence of cogni-
tive deficits in breast cancer survivors is well documented, few evidence-based interventions exist to prevent or ameliorate
this decline.9
One intervention that potentially could improve cognition is increasing physical activity. The Institute of Medicine’s
report on cognitive aging recommends physical activity to reduce age-related cognitive decline.10 Many physical activity
interventions have been effective in improving cognition among both healthy and cognitively impaired populations.11-14
The general physical activity recommendation for breast cancer survivors is to engage in 150 minutes per week of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).15 However, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data
indicate that breast cancer survivors spend only approximately 25 minutes per week in MVPA.16 Studies of the impact of
physical activity on cancer-related cognitive impairments have great potential to improve the lives among the growing
number of cancer survivors.17

Original Article
 Few intervention studies have examined the effects
of physical activity on cognition in a cancer population. A
recent review of the literature18 indicated that there have
been only 2 trials that tested the impact of aerobic physical
activity interventions on cancer-related cognitive impair-
ments.19,20 Focusing on aerobic physical activity is impor-
tant, because it is consistent with guidelines for brain
health.21,22 These 2 studies yielded mixed findings: a 6-
week trial in 479 breast cancer survivors reported
improvements in self-reported cognition,20 but a 12-week
trial in 41 breast cancer survivors reported no improve-
ments in self-reported cognition.19 It is noteworthy that
neither study used objective measures of cognition. We
identified only 1 trial in cancer survivors that used objec-
tive cognitive measures. This recent study in 19 breast
cancer survivors enrolled in a 24-week physical activity
randomized controlled trial indicated that the exercise
arm had greater improvements in a measure of processing
speed compared with the control group.23 Several cross-
sectional studies in cancer survivors using objective mea-
sures of cognition have indicated that greater physical
activity is associated with several domains of cognition,
including information processing speed,24 memory,25
executive functioning,26 and attention.26 These studies
lend support to the hypothesis that increasing physical
activity may be an effective intervention for improving
cognition in breast cancer survivors.
To our knowledge, the current study is one of the
first completed randomized controlled trials among can-
cer survivors testing the impact of increasing physical
activity on both objective measures (ie, neurocognitive
testing) and self-reported measures (ie, cognitive abilities
and concerns). Because neurocognitive outcomes and self-
reported cognition reflect different aspects of cognition,
assessing both provides a fuller picture of how physical
activity can impact cancer survivors’ quality of life. The
objective of this study was to examine the effects of a 12-
week physical activity intervention, compared with a con-
tact control condition, on objective and self-reported
measures of cognition among breast cancer survivors. We
hypothesized that the physical activity intervention would
result in greater improvements in neurocognitive tests and
self-reported cognition compared with a waitlist wellness-
contact control. We also explored potential effect modi-
fiers as well as dose-response associations between changes
in physical activity and cognition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Memory and Motion study was a randomized con-
trolled trial of a 12-week physical activity intervention
compared with a waitlist wellness-contact control to test
changes in objective neurocognitive tests and self-
reported cognition among breast cancer survivors. Data
were collected from February 2015 through July 2016
and were analyzed from July to November 2016. The
University of California-San Diego Institutional Review
Board approved all study procedures, and all participants
provided written informed consent. This trial is regis-
tered with clinicaltrials.gov as National Clinical Trial
NCT02332876.
Eligible participants were female breast cancer survi-
vors, ages 21 to 85 years, who were diagnosed less than 5
years before study enrollment and had completed chemo-
therapy or radiation treatment. Other inclusion criteria
were: 1) sedentary, defined as self-reporting < 60 minutes
of MVPA in 10-minute bouts per week; 2) able to travel to
La Jolla, California, for study visits; 3) access to the inter-
net; and 4) self-reported that they were experiencing
“fogginess” or worsening of their memory, thinking, or
concentration. Exclusion criteria were: 1) a medical condi-
tion that could make it potentially unsafe to be in an unsu-
pervised physical activity intervention, as determined by
the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire27; 2) other
primary or recurrent invasive cancer within the last 10
years; and 3) unable to commit to a 3-month intervention.
Protocol
A detailed description of the protocol was previously pub-
lished.28 Briefly, participants were predominantly recruited
using cancer registry lists. Potential participants were
telephone-screened to determine eligibility. Interested and
eligible women were scheduled for an in-person visit. At
the baseline visit, participants provided signed informed
consent, a fasting blood draw was collected, height and
weight were measured, and participants completed a bat-
tery of neurocognitive tests and questionnaires assessing
self-reported cognition, as described below. At the end of
this visit, all participants were given an ActiGraph GT3X1
accelerometer (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) to wear for 7
days and then return at the randomization visit. All base-
line measures were repeated at the 12-week visit.
Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2
groups—an exercise arm or a control arm—in a 1:1 ratio.
Randomization was stratified according to whether or not
the women had received chemotherapy using a permuted
block-randomization scheme with random-sized blocks of 6
or 8. A computerized randomization scheme was created by
the Moores Cancer Center Biostatistics Shared Resource.
The sample size was determined based on 80% statistical
power for between-group effect sizes of 0.32 (Cohen f).

 After randomization, participants in both groups reviewed
the expectations and requirements of their group assignment
with study staff.
Physical activity intervention (exercise arm)
Participants randomized to the exercise arm had a 30-
minute to 45-minute in-person meeting at which they
went on a 10-minute walk at moderate intensity and
set physical activity goals. To promote behavior change
and accountability, participants were provided a Fitbit
One activity device (Fitbit, San Francisco, CA) as an
intervention tool. Participants were informed that
study staff would be able to see the physical activity
data collected by the Fitbit and that they would receive
feedback on the Fitbit data. Motivational interviewing
techniques were used to set a starting goal with a spe-
cific plan for meeting that goal. Participants discussed
how to gradually increase their aerobic exercise over
time and meet the study goal of at least 150 minutes of
MVPA per week.15 Participants received 2 telephone
calls (at the 2-week and 6-week time points) and emails
every 3 days throughout the 12-week intervention. The
intervention was delivered by a clinical psychologist
with extensive training and experience in promoting
behavior change (S.J.H.) and by a staff member (E.M.)
who was trained by S.J.H. For further details on the
intervention, see Hartman et al.28
Waitlist wellness-contact control condition
(control arm)
Participants randomized to the control arm received
emails on the same schedule as those in the exercise arm.
Emails addressed various women’s health topics, includ-
ing healthy eating, stress reduction, and general brain
health. After the completion of measures at the final visit,
participants in the control arm were provided with the
exercise intervention described above.
Measures
The primary outcome, objective neurocognitive function-
ing, was measured using The National Institutes of Health
(NIH) Toolbox Cognition Domain (nihtoolbox.org) at
baseline and at the 12-week time point. The NIH Tool-
box is a series of computer-based tests that can be adminis-
tered in approximately 45 minutes and has been validated
and normed in individuals ages 3 to 85 years. The testing
uses multiple forms and computer-adaptive testing to
minimize practice effects. It also has minimal floor and
ceiling effects. The tests provide age-standardized scores
for a Fluid Cognition Composite score and a Crystallized
Cognition Composite score.29 In addition, we examined
7 individual test scores of the Fluid Composite Score. Five
of the 7 tests have age-standardized scores, and the other 2
only provide raw scores (Oral Symbol Digit and Auditory
Verbal Learning).30
The second primary outcome, self-reported cogni-
tion, was measured with 2 scales from the Patient-
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS): Applied Cognition Abilities (Abilities) and
General Concerns (Concerns). The cognitive Abilities
and Concerns measures assess patient-perceived func-
tional abilities and problems in the past 7 days with regard
to cognitive tasks in specific areas (eg, concentration,
memory). Higher scores on the Abilities measure indicate
more positive perceptions of cognition, and higher scores
on the Concerns measure represent worse perceptions of
cognition. Both self-report measures are standardized T-
scores that have demonstrated good reliability and validity
with previous measures including the Functional Assess-
ment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function measure.31
The GT3X1 ActiGraph, a research-grade acceler-
ometer that is considered the gold-standard for measuring
free-living physical activity, was used to measure changes
in physical activity from baseline to 12 weeks. Participants
in both study arms wore the ActiGraph on the hip for 7
days before the randomization visit and for 7 days before
the final visit. The ActiGraph provides second-by-second
estimates of activity that can be categorized into minutes
spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity
using calibration thresholds.32 Sufficient wear time across
the 7 days was defined as having 5 days with � 600
minutes each of wear time or 3000 minutes (50 hours) of
total wear time across 4 days.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from height
and weight collected at the baseline and final visits. Partic-
ipants self-reported demographics, including age, educa-
tion, income, race/ethnicity, and marital status at
baseline. All breast cancer information and treatment
details were obtained from medical chart reviews. To esti-
mate time since diagnosis, we used the date of surgery,
because the exact date of diagnosis was not consistently
available from the medical charts.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using an intent-to-treat prin-
cipal, with missing data assumed missing at random and
accounted for in the longitudinal random-effects models
by using a likelihood-based estimation method, which
uses all available data and does not omit individuals with
partially missing data. Group differences in baseline char-
acteristics were assessed using t tests, chi-square tests, or 2-

 tailed Fisher exact tests (when warranted by small cell
counts) for categorical variables. Differences in baseline
physical activity were assessed using a mixed-effects
regression model of day-level activity, controlling for Acti-
Graph wear time, and included fixed-effect terms for
group. Logistic regression was used to assess group differ-
ences in the percentage of participants who met the study
goal (150 minutes per week of MVPA) at 12 weeks.
Mixed-effects regression models with a subject-level ran-
dom intercept and an unstructured covariance structure,
as determined by model Akaike Information Criterion
comparisons in the main-effects models, were used for all
other models. Contrasts were used to calculate the differ-
ence of change based on the regression model when exam-
ining group difference. Because the Crystalized Cognition
Composite Score was not expected to change with the
intervention, it was assessed as an outcome in all cognition
models to confirm expected patterns.29,33 Models to assess
the effects of the intervention on change in physical activ-
ity—measured at the day level—and changes in cognition
scores controlled for ActiGraph wear time and included
fixed-effect terms for group, time-point (baseline or 12
weeks), and time-by-group interactions. In the case of the
Oral Symbol Digit and Auditory Verbal Learning scores,
participant age was also controlled for, because these
scores are not age-adjusted.
Potential effect modifiers of the intervention (age,
chemotherapy, current receipt of tamoxifen or aromatase
inhibitor, and time since surgery) were tested for the Fluid
and Crystalized Cognition Composite Scores, any signifi-
cant individual neurocognitive test scores, and self-reported
cognitive abilities and concerns from the main-effects mod-
els. Effect modification was examined by adding the poten-
tial effect modifier and a 3-way interaction (time, group,
and effect modifier) to the mixed-effect regression models.
The significance of this interaction term was set at the .1
level, as is common practice with interactions. For signifi-
cant effect modifiers, subgroup analyses stratifying the sam-
ple at the median for the effect modifier were conducted.
Dose response was examined within the exercise arm using
mixed-effects regression models of average physical activity
per week (MVPA or total activity) on cognition scores,
controlling for ActiGraph wear time.
RESULTS
In total, 911 women were screened for eligibility; of those,
108 were eligible, and 97 came to the baseline visit. The
most common reasons for ineligibility included being too

 active (n 5 225), being unable/unwilling to attend clinic
visits (n 5 106), underwent breast cancer surgery >5 years
ago (n 5 81), and medical exclusion (n 5 36). At the
baseline visit, 10 women were deemed ineligible (high
blood pressure, n 5 8; physical limitation, n 5 2). Eighty-
seven participants were randomized to the exercise arm
(n 5 43) or the control arm (n 5 44). One participant
from each arm was lost to follow-up, resulting in a 97.7%
retention rate (exercise arm, n 5 42; control arm, n 5 43)
(for a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [CON-
SORT] diagram of the current study, see Fig. 1).
Baseline characteristics of the study participants,
stratified by randomization arm, are provided in Table 1.
Overall, the average age ( 6 standard deviation [SD]) of
women in the study was 57 6 10.4 years; they were pre-
dominantly white (82%), non-Hispanic (83%), and had a
college education or greater (71%). Participants were an
average of 30 6 16.7 months postsurgery, 61% had stage
I breast cancer, 53% had received chemotherapy, and
70% were currently receiving an aromatase inhibitor or
tamoxifen. The mean 6 SD, age-adjusted, standardized
composite scores were 115 6 14.4 points for Crystalized
Cognition and 103 6 14.7 points for Fluid Cognition.
The average scores (6SD) were 45.4 6 5.7 for Cognitive
Abilities and 43.3 6 6.9) for Cognitive Concerns. At
baseline, Cognitive Concerns were significantly lower in
the exercise arm with mean 6 SD scores of 41.8 6 5.5
versus 44.9 6 7.9 in the wellness control arm (P 5 .04).
At baseline, participants were engaging in an average of
14 6 14.4 minutes per day of MVPA and an average of
303 6 75.2 minutes (approximately 5 hours) per day of
total activity (light and MVPA), and they wore the Acti-
Graph on average 842 6 103 minutes per day. There
were no significant differences between the exercise and
control arms in baseline characteristics (P < .05).
Participants in the exercise arm had greater increases
in accelerometer-measured MVPA (mean increase: 14.2
vs 20.7 minutes per day; b 5 7.24; P < .0001) and total
activity (mean increase: 27.4 vs 4.9 minutes per day;
b 5 10.05; P 5 .02) than participants in the control arm.
The exercise arm also had greater increases in the number
of participants who met the study goal of 150 minutes per
week of MVPA compared with the control arm
(P 5 .006). BMI did not change significantly over time
(b 5 0.01; P 5 .84) (see Table 2).
Changes in objective and self-reported cognition
scores from baseline to 12 weeks between the exercise
and control arms are presented in Figure 2. Participants
in the exercise arm had significantly greater improve-
ments in the Oral Symbol Digit score, a measure of proc-
essing speed, compared with those in the control arm
(b 5 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-4.01;
P 5 .049). On all other neurocognitive measures (except
List Sorting, a measure of working memory), scores
increased significantly from baseline to 12 weeks, but
there were no significant between-group differences. For
self-reported cognition, there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference between the arms for Cognitive Abilities
(b 5 0.92; 95% CI, 20.14, 1.98; P 5 .087) or Cognitive
Concerns (b 5 21.38; 95% CI, 23.13, 0.37; P 5 .120).
Age, chemotherapy, current receipt of tamoxifen or
aromatase inhibitors, and time since surgery were tested as
potential effect modifiers of the relation between interven-
tion and change in the Crystalized and Fluid Composite

 Scores, and the Oral Symbol Digit score, and self-
reported Cognitive Abilities and Cognitive Concerns.
Time since surgery was a significant effect modifier for
change in the Oral Symbol Digit score (P 5 .079). When
we stratified the sample at the median time since surgery
(2 years), participants who were �2 years from surgery
had a significant intervention effect on change in the Oral
Symbol Digit score (b 5 4.01; 95% CI, 1.40-6.63;
P 5 .0033); in contrast, there was no intervention effect
in participants who were >2 years from surgery (see Fig.
3). No modification effect was observed for age, chemo-
therapy, or hormone therapy.
Within the exercise arm, a dose response was
observed for physical activity, such that a greater increase
in MVPA was positively associated with a greater
improvement in the Oral Symbol Digit score (b 5 0.20;
P 5 .016), self-reported Cognitive Abilities (b 5 0.99;
P < .0001),
and
self-reported
Cognitive
Concerns
(b 5 20.68; P < .0001). Specifically, a 15-minute per
day increase in MVPA, on average, was associated with a
3.0-point increase in the Oral Symbol Digit score, a 14.8-
point increase in the standardized self-report Cognitive
Abilities score, and a 10.2-point decrease in the standard-
ized self-report Cognitive Concerns score. A greater
increase in total activity (MVPA plus light activity) was
associated with a greater improvement in the Fluid Com-
posite score (b 5 0.03; P 5 .038) and the Picture
Sequence score (b 5 0.04; P 5 .039), indicating that a 30-
minute per day increase in total activity was associated, on
average, with a 0.84-point increase in the Fluid Compos-
ite score and a 1.3-point increase in the Picture Sequence
score. All other components of the Fluid Composite score
(except List Sorting) had a nonsignificant, positive associ-
ation with increased total activity (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This study is one of the first randomized controlled tri-
als of physical activity in breast cancer survivors with
comprehensive measures of cognition as the primary
outcome. The intervention was successful in increasing
physical activity over 12 weeks, and both groups exhib-
ited improved performance in most cognitive domains.
However, of 9 examined cognitive domains, only Proc-
essing Speed had significantly greater improvements in
the exercise arm compared with the control arm. These
findings are consistent with a recent randomized con-
trolled trial of 19 breast cancer survivors in which the
exercise arm had greater improvements only for a mea-
sure of processing speed23 and a cross-sectional study of

 accelerometer-measured physical activity was only
related to 1 cognitive domain: processing speed.24
Although the cross-sectional study was also conducted
by investigators from the current study, it concerned a
different sample of breast cancer survivors and used a
different neurocognitive test. Although the benefits of
physical activity were limited to this domain, it is an
important aspect of cognition, because it can impact
daily life,34,35 is sensitive to cancer-related cognitive
impairments, and is commonly impaired in breast can-
cer survivors.36-38 In addition, processing speed plays a
central role in cognition and can impact other cognitive
tasks, especially those related to learning and mem-
ory.35,39 Therefore, improved processing speed could
lead to improvements in other aspects of cognition.
Future studies are needed to determine whether sus-
tained physical activity over longer periods could lead
to more widespread improvements in cognition.

 Between-group differences for both measures of self-
reported cognition were not statistically significant; how-
ever, given the small sample size, the results may suggest
potential group differences. This is consistent with the sig-
nificant dose effect for MVPA observed for both aspects
of self-reported cognition. Although there are no guide-
lines for what constitutes clinically meaningful improve-
ment on these 2 measures, for other PROMIS quality-of-
life measures, minimally important differences among
cancer survivors have ranged from 2.5 to 6 points based
on standardized T-scores.40 Therefore, with an average
2.7-point improvement in Cognitive Abilities and a 4.8-
point reduction in Cognitive Concerns in the exercise
arm, many intervention participants may have experi-
enced clinically meaningful improvements in their every-
day cognitive functioning. Larger trials are needed to fully
test the impact of physical activity on self-reported
cognition.
In the current study, MVPA-associated improve-
ment in processing speed was significantly greater for
women who were closer to surgery but did not vary based
on other cancer-related factors, including whether or not
they had received chemotherapy. The physical and mental
impact of cancer is generally greater closer in time to diag-
nosis and treatment41; thus, there may be more potential
for improvements to occur when physical activity is
increased closer in time to treatments. The benefits
observed for processing speed suggest that increasing
physical activity may be most advantageous when initiated
closer to the time of surgery. It is also noteworthy that
neurocognitive testing improved for both groups on most
domains over the 12-week study. This improvement may
be related to the practice effects from repeated measure-
ments. For instance, familiarity with the tests may have
contributed to participants feeling less nervous, which
could lead to improved scores.42-44 These findings high-
light the important role of a control arm in ensuring that
observed changes in cognition are causally related to the
physical activity intervention. There is growing evidence
that cognitive problems in patients with cancer are not
limited to those who have received chemotherapy.2,45
Thus, the lack of effect modification for chemotherapy
and hormone therapy in our study suggests that increasing
physical activity may be helpful for improving cognitive
processing speed in breast cancer survivors regardless of
the treatments they received.
A significant dose response between minutes of
increased physical activity and improved neurocognitive
test performance and self-reported cognition in the exer-
cise arm was observed. It is noteworthy that, for the
neurocognitive tests, a dose response was observed for
total activity (MVPA plus light activity). This finding sug-
gests that all types of physical activity, not just those con-
ducted at moderate intensity, could be beneficial for
cognition. This finding is consistent with yoga and qigong
interventions, which reportedly improved cognition in
cancer survivors46-48 and in noncancer populations.22
Engaging in large amounts of MVPA can be challenging
for most individuals; a focus on increasing all intensities
of activity could be a more feasible strategy for breast can-
cer survivors. Future research should examine the neces-
sary minutes needed of different activity intensities to
improve cognition.
There are many potential mechanisms through
which physical activity could improve cognition. Self-
reported cognition is often associated with psychological
factors, including fatigue, anxiety, and depression.49,50 It
has been demonstrated in patients with cancer that physi-
cal activity decreases fatigue,51-54 anxiety,53 and depres-
sion,51,53,54 suggesting that physical activity also may
improve self-reported cognition. In addition, psychologi-
cal factors, including depression and anxiety, can impact
neurocognitive testing.55 There are also several biologic
mechanisms through which physical activity may improve
cognition. One is through the increase of cerebral blood
flow and oxygen transport to the brain.56-60 Increased
cerebral blood flow achieved through physical activity can
enhance the production of brain-derived neurotrophic
factor,61-63 a biomarker of brain health that plays a central
role in neuron survival, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity,
and cognitive function.64-66 Physical activity may also
reduce the impact of accelerated aging observed in cancer
survivors.2,3,6 At the cellular level, dynamic, epigenetic
DNA methylation profiles are associated with aging,67
cancer,67-69 physical activity,70 and cognition.71,72 It is
important to note that age-related DNA methylation is
associated with age-related gene transcription.67 More
research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms through
which physical activity improves cognition to support the
development of targeted interventions.
Although this was a randomized controlled trial
using objective and self-reported measures for cognition
and physical activity, several limitations should be noted.
This was a modestly sized study with limited power to
detect differences between groups; and, because of the
pilot nature of the study, we did not adjust for multiple
comparisons. The intervention only lasted for 12 weeks
and may not have been long enough to detect the impact
of physical activity on cognition. At baseline, approxi-
mately 20% of participants were engaging in 150 minutes

 of accelerometer-measured MVPA per week, which may
have limited our ability to detect group differences. The
small sample size also limited our ability to determine the
optimal dose and intensity of physical activity. These limi-
tations highlight the need for longer, fully powered trials
to determine whether the effectiveness of increased physi-
cal activity improves aspects of cognition beyond process-
ing speed and to establish the optimal dose and intensity
of activity for improving cancer-related cognitive decline.
We chose to use the NIH Cognition Toolbox rather than
the 3 core tests recommended in 2011 by the Interna-
tional Cognitive and Cancer Taskforce.73 The goal of
both initiatives was to increase comparability between
studies by using common methodology. We chose the
NIH Toolbox because it enhances comparability across
disease populations and is more comprehensive in the
domains measured. Future studies combining the NIH
Cognition Toolbox with the measures suggested by the
International Cognitive and Cancer Taskforce would be
helpful in further comparing results across oncology and
other population studies. Other limitations include the
predominantly well educated, high-intelligence (as indi-
cated by the Crystalized Composite Score), non-Hispanic
white sample of breast cancer survivors; future research in
cancer populations with greater diversity is needed.
This study provides preliminary support for the effi-
cacy of increasing physical activity to improve processing
speed and, potentially, self-reported cognition in breast
cancer survivors. With the growing interest in testing the
potential of physical activity to improve cognition in can-
cer survivors,74,75 this and other studies are likely to con-
tribute to our ability to make recommendations to the
growing number of cancer survivors on effective interven-
tions to improve cognition.
