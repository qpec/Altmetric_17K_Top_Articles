capable of somatic growth in young lambs

Treatment of congenital heart defects in children requiring right ventricular outflow tract
reconstruction typically involves multiple open-heart surgeries because all existing graft
materials have no growth potential. Here we present an ‘off-the-shelf’ vascular graft grown
from donor fibroblasts in a fibrin gel to address this critical unmet need. In a proof-of-concept
study, the decellularized grafts are implanted as a pulmonary artery replacement in three
young lambs and evaluated to adulthood. Longitudinal ultrasounds document dimensional
growth of the grafts. The lambs show normal growth, increasing body weight by 366% and
graft diameter and volume by 56% and 216%, respectively. Explanted grafts display
physiological strength and stiffness, complete lumen endothelialization and extensive
population by mature smooth muscle cells. The grafts also show substantial elastin
deposition and a 465% increase in collagen content, without signs of calcification, aneurysm
or stenosis. Collectively, our data support somatic growth of this completely biological graft.

 T
he incidence of surgical correction of congenital heart
defects has increased dramatically over the last several
decades. These defects, considered fatal just 30 years ago,
can often be corrected successfully with overall operative
mortality of o2% (refs 1,2). Reconstruction or replacement of
blood vessels, valves and cardiac chambers is frequently required
to repair or reform the appropriate anatomic configuration. The
use of synthetic materials, with zero growth potential and
unpredictable durability, is often the only way to achieve these
operative goals. The availability of tissue-engineered material,
with the ability to grow, heal and provide long-term durability,
would revolutionize the practice of congenital heart surgery.
Tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia with ventricular
septal defect are just two examples of cardiac defects that, despite
excellent long-term survival typically require multiple operative
procedures to replace the reconstructed connection between the
right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Currently, homograft
pulmonary artery conduits or bovine jugular vein grafts are the
only materials able to create this connection. These conduits have
no ability to grow and remodel with the somatic growth of the
child. Additionally, an intense inflammatory reaction to these
materials commonly occurs, resulting in early calcification and
failure3. Thus, these patients will sometimes require five to
seven operative procedures during their lifetimes even with a
‘successful’ corrective procedure4. Although a valved conduit
would benefit a larger patient population, and several research
groups are working on such grafts5–10, a conduit with the ability
to grow somatically would suffice for many patients with
competent
valves
who
require
cardiopulmonary
vascular
reconstruction. It might also be a compromise solution for
patients in need of a valved conduit absent the availability of one
with growth potential.
The application of a competent, readily available conduit, with
the ability to grow with the child, would eliminate the need for
multiple operations and the morbidities associated with these
procedures, possibly benefiting more than 1,000 pediatric patients
annually in the USA4. It would also dramatically reduce the
financial burden on the health care system associated with
currently used conduits that require periodic replacement to
accommodate child growth.
Pioneering research in this field has been conducted by
Shin’oka et al.11 with the landmark report of reconstruction of an
occluded pulmonary artery in a 4-year old patient with a
degradable synthetic polymer tube of the copolymer polylactic
acid/polycaprolactone
seeded
with
autologous
cells.
In
a
subsequent clinical trial, similar grafts seeded with autologous
bone marrow mononuclear cells were implanted into 42 patients
(median age 5.5 years)12. There was no graft-related mortality
with mean follow-up of 5.8 years although one patient had a
partial mural thrombosis, and four patients had graft stenosis13.
Histological examination of one graft was conducted after 12
years in a patient (implanted at age 4 years), showing graft
remodelling with complete lumen endothelialization and a
mature smooth muscle wall14. In addition, investigators have
conducted extensive research in the mouse aorta model to
elucidate the role of the seeded cells and the host response15–22.
In a sheep study using autologous cells seeded on a synthetic
polymer scaffold, Hoerstrup et al.23,24 implanted 18 mm diameter
polylactic
acid/poly-4-hydroxybutarate
tubes
seeded
with
autologous myofibroblasts into lambs as arterial replacements
for up to 240 weeks. Longitudinal computed tomography imaging
and explant histology revealed extensive remodelling and graft
growth.
Both
of
the
above
approaches,
although
successful
in
preclinical (Hoerstrup et al.) and clinical (Shin’oka et al.)
studies, require autologous cells to be isolated from the patient
and expanded before implantation. An ‘off-the-shelf’ graft that is
acellular and possesses growth potential via host cell invasion
post-implantation, as reported herein, would be a substantial
clinical advance. In addition, an acellular graft would eliminate
the need to develop a manufacturing process to isolate autologous
cells and reliably seed them onto the scaffold in order to translate
the technology into the clinic.
These completely-biological tubular grafts, consisting primarily
of cell-produced collagen, are derived from a sacrificial fibrin gel,
which is remodelled in a bioreactor by entrapped dermal
fibroblasts. After remodelling, the tubes are decellularized, which,
when done effectively, removes the need for immunosuppression,
but maintains the cell-produced matrix. The graft is grown to be
strongly aligned in the circumferential direction in order to
mimic the mechanical anisotropy associated with native arteries.
The goal of this study is to demonstrate proof-of-principle for
an ‘off-the-shelf’ graft that is capable of somatic growth and can
thus serve as a conduit for pediatric cardiac surgeries. These
acellular allografts are characterized, stored, and then implanted
into three lambs (average age 8 weeks), tracked longitudinally
with ultrasound, and then explanted after the lambs reach adult
size (age 50 weeks) for mechanical, biochemical and histological
characterization. These characterizations are performed in order
to answer key questions about the graft including immunogeni-
city, propensity for calcification, matrix remodelling in relation to
maintenance of stiffness and strength, capacity for recellulariza-
tion and somatic growth potential.
Results
Tissue-engineered arterial graft. Decellularized tissue-engi-
neered tubes (16 mm inner diameter) were evaluated for tensile
mechanical, suture retention and biochemical properties. The
resulting tubular grafts had thicknesses of 1.21±0.03 mm, which
was comparable to the pulmonary artery (1.15±0.20 mm).
A representative end and side view of the graft are shown
Fig. 1a,b. Histologically, the grafts were predominantly collagen
with a layer of residual fibrin on the lumenal surface (Fig. 1c).
Stretch-to-failure testing showed the grafts possessed an ultimate
tensile
strength
(UTS)
of
1.9±0.2 MPa
and
stiffness
of
3.6±1.2 MPa (Fig. 1d) in the circumferential direction. The tissue
tubes also possessed mechanical anisotropy, with stiffness being
4.5-fold higher in the circumferential direction than the axial
direction. The suture retention strength with 7-0 prolene suture
was 175±56 g. All of these values compared favourably to the
ovine pulmonary artery, including suture retention strength of
224±31 g for native pulmonary artery. The total collagen
concentration before implantation was 38±5 mg ml � 1 (Fig. 1e).
The DNA content after decellularization was 1±1% of the con-
tent before decellularization (from 422±59 ug ml � 1 of tissue
volume to 5.5±7.8 ug ml � 1).
The grafts were implanted interpositionally into the pulmonary
artery (Fig. 1f), following resection of a similar length of native
artery, in three lambs. 5-0 Maxon CV biodegradable sutures
(in vivo strength half-life of 4 weeks) were used to attach the graft
to the pulmonary artery at the anastomoses. In addition, to
ensure anastomoses could be identified at explant, silver clips
were sewn on top of the native artery near each anastomosis
(Fig. 1f).
Growth evaluation of pulmonary artery graft with ultrasound.
All animals were first evaluated with ultrasound at 8 weeks
following implantation to assess graft diameter, graft length,
blood velocity in the graft and right heart function. Figure 2a
shows a representative image of the graft 8 weeks after implant
with red arrows indicating the anastomoses. The grafts, although

 originally implanted as straight tubes, showed curvature similar to
the native pulmonary artery after 8 weeks. The second and third
ultrasounds were performed when the lambs reached the age of
30 and 50 weeks, respectively. Figure 2b shows a representative
image of the grafts at 50 weeks, with prominent curvature, no
indication of calcification (speckles in ultrasound), and no
evidence of graft stenosis or aneurysm. At 50 weeks, there was no
difference in diameter of the graft and adjacent native artery
(Fig. 2c) leading to laminar flow through the graft (Fig. 2d). This
was true for all three grafts (Supplementary Fig. 1). All animals
had healthy weight gains with an increase of 340% over the course
of study (Fig. 2e). The mid-graft diameter increased over the
course of implantation by 56% (Fig. 2f) and total volume of the
graft increased by 216%, as determined by measurements in
ultrasound (Fig. 2g). There was no pathological increase in flow
velocity measured within the graft during the study duration,
indicating a lack of stenosis (Fig. 2h). Further, there was no
measured increase/decrease in velocity downstream of the graft
indicating no pressure gradient across the graft. The right heart
function was also normal with no change in wall motion or
pulmonary valve function.
Explanted graft gross pathology. All grafts were explanted when
the animals were anatomically mature at age of 50 weeks. Grossly,
the explanted grafts looked larger in both diameter and length
when compared with the pre-implant graft. Figure 3a,b shows the
pre-implanted
and
explanted
grafts
at
the
same
scale
(Supplementary Fig. 2 shows images of all grafts at implant and
explant). The measured diameter and length of each graft at
implant and explant is reported in Table 1, and the diameter
compares well with that of the pulmonary artery in age-matched
1-year-old non-surgical sheep measured to be 22.3±2.1 mm
(n ¼ 3). The explanted grafts had a diameter consistent with the
adjacent pulmonary artery (Fig. 3b). The average wall thickness
of the right ventricle was 6.3±0.6 mm (Fig. 3c) and that in
non-surgical
sheep
was
7.2±0.3 mm
(c.f.
Supplementary
Fig. 2g,h). Cross-sections of the explanted graft showed homo-
geneous thickness across the length (Fig. 3d, red arrows
indicating lumenal and ablumenal surfaces). The anastomotic
regions had no scarring or stenotic tissue and the lumenal surface
transitioned smoothly from the native artery to the engineered
graft.
Explanted graft mechanical and biochemical properties. The
explanted grafts were cut into strips and stretched to failure. Graft
thickness was 0.85±0.09 mm as compared with explanted
pulmonary
artery
thickness
of
1.15±0.2 mm
and
control
pulmonary artery thickness of 1.26±0.14 mm. The explanted
graft stress–strain curves in the circumferential and axial direc-
tions, along with the pre-implant graft curves, are shown in
Fig. 3e. The graft UTS and modulus in the circumferential
direction were 1.5–2 fold higher than the age-matched control
and explanted pulmonary artery (Fig. 3f,g) with UTS in the
circumferential direction of 1.6±0.5 MPa and modulus of
3.3±0.8 MPa.
The
modulus
was
1.8-fold
higher
in
the
circumferential direction compared with the axial direction. In
order to assess how mechanically robust the fusion at the
anastomoses was and any influence of scar tissue formation, axial
strips from this region were compared with axial strips from the
graft and the adjacent pulmonary artery (Fig. 4a). UTS, maximum
tension and modulus were not different between the three regions
(Fig. 4b–d).
The explanted graft DNA content was 58% of the pulmonary
artery value, corresponding to a cell concentration of 119±15
million cells ml � 1 (Fig. 4e). The total collagen and elastin content
in the grafts were 180% and 49% of the pulmonary artery,
respectively (Fig. 4f). The total protein content was 80% of the
pulmonary artery (Fig. 4f). Based on collagen concentration, total
surface area, and thickness measured for implanted and explanted
grafts, the total collagen content of the explanted grafts was
224±51 mg, which was 465% higher than total collagen content
of the pre-implanted grafts (40±7 mg). There was also 277%
increase in total protein content of tissue. Compared with
pre-implant grafts, which had no detectable level of elastin,
explanted grafts contained substantial elastin (Fig. 4g). As for the
tensile mechanical properties, there were no differences in
compositional measures between the control and explanted
pulmonary artery groups.
Explanted graft histological analysis. The explanted graft and
pulmonary artery sections were stained to visualize the matrix
composition. Trichrome staining showed the multi-layer nature
of the pulmonary artery (Fig. 5a) and complete remodelling of the
lumenal fibrin layer into a dense collagen network and evidence
of recellularization along the entire graft’s length (Fig. 5b).
Further characterization with picrosirius red staining imaged
under polarized light showed crimped collagen fibers similar to

the entire pulmonary artery (Fig. 5e) and graft (Fig. 5f), with
evidence of mature elastin in the pulmonary artery (Fig. 5g) and
near the lumenal surface of the graft (Fig. 5h). The basement
membrane protein collagen IV was strongly expressed at the
lumenal surface of the pulmonary artery (Fig. 5i) and the graft
(Fig. 5j). Von Kossa staining showed no evidence of calcification

 (Fig. 5k,l), except at localized sites near the anastomoses in the
adjacent pulmonary artery where the sutures had degraded.
Immunostaining was performed in order identify the pheno-
type of the invaded host cells and then counterstained with
Hoechst. Recellularization across the entire thickness and length
of the grafts was observed (Fig. 6). The absence of CD45-
expressing cells indicated a lack of immune cell types in the
pulmonary artery (Fig. 6a) and the explanted graft (Fig. 6b).
Many cells present in the graft stained positive for a-smooth
muscle actin (a-SMA), calponin, and smoothelin (Fig. 6d,f,h),
which are markers for mature smooth muscle cells, with
smoothelin reported to be definitive in this respect25,26. Similar
staining was also seen in the native pulmonary artery (Fig. 6c,e,g).
In both the graft and native artery, few cells stained positive for
the proliferative marker Ki67, indicating a quiescent state for
most cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). The grafts had a complete
endothelial cell layer, as evidenced by the uniform expression of
Von Willebrand factor along both the pulmonary artery (Fig. 6g)
and the entire length of the graft (Fig. 6h). The endothelial cells
were also stained for E-selectin (CD62) to assess their activation
state, with no evidence of E-selectin activation seen in any of the
grafts or the adjacent pulmonary artery (Supplementary Fig. 4)
even after using overnight incubation in antigen retrieval buffer.
Further evidence of native-like tissue organization was observed
when cells were imaged for calponin in both the circumferential
and axial directions, showing elongated cells aligned in the
circumferential direction (Supplementary Fig. 5). Evidence of a
neo-adventitial layer including small vessels was evident on the
ablumenal
surface
of
the
explanted
grafts
(Fig.

Supplementary Fig 6).
Discussion
Tissue engineering has the potential to overcome the limitations
of existing treatments for congenital cardiovascular defects. An
ideal
treatment
option
would
be
durable,
not
prone
to
calcification, and possess the potential to somatic growth. To
this end, two groups have previously demonstrated growth
potential of synthetic biodegradable grafts seeded with autologous
cells13,22–24. The studies by Shin’oka et al. led to a clinical trial in
which 24 patients were enrolled12. While they have shown
promising results, their approach relies on isolating and seeding
the conduits with autologous cells before implantation. If growth
and remodelling could be demonstrated with an ‘off-the-shelf’
(acellular) conduit, this would simplify the procedure and the
GMP-regulated manufacturing processes to prepare the grafts for
clinical use.
Herein, we report an ‘off-the-shelf’ pulmonary artery replace-
ment capable of growing and remodelling. This study builds on
our prior research, which used decellularized engineered tissue
tubes as femoral artery grafts and tubular aortic heart valves in an
adult sheep model. Both studies demonstrated excellent graft
remodelling and function out to 24 weeks27,28 consistent with
the pioneering studies in adult animals by Niklason and
co-workers29. Based on the extensive recellularization and
mechanical durability of the matrices found in our adult sheep
studies, we undertook this study to investigate the growth
potential of the matrix by implanting anatomically-matched

 16 mm diameter grafts as a pulmonary artery replacement in
lambs. The completely biological and circumferential alignment
properties of these grafts are unique in comparison to grafts
used in the aforementioned studies by Shin’oka co-workers,
Hoerstrup co-workers and Niklasson co-workers among which
only those of Niklasson et al. are ‘off-the-shelf’, although not
tested for growth potential. The 16 mm diameter grafts were
evaluated for suture retention strength, which was comparable to
the native artery and similar to that reported by Dahl et al.29.
While, we did not measure burst pressure of our 16 mm grafts,
their UTS was comparable to previously reported values for our
4 mm grafts fabricated using the same methods and with burst
pressures exceeding 4,000 mm Hg (ref. 27). The animals were
evaluated from average ages of 8 weeks to 50 weeks, with
maximum graft implant duration of 44 weeks.
Over the course of the study, all animals were asymptomatic
and showed healthy weight gain. During the study duration, the
sheep increased in weight from 14 kg (8 week) to 67 kg (50 week),
which was comparable to reported weight gain by non-surgical
sheep30. To reduce the risk of clotting as a potential failure mode
in our assessment of somatic growth potential of our tissue-
engineered matrix, subdermal heparin was utilized for the
duration of this study, based on our prior aortic valve implant
experience28. No complications, bruising or bleeding were seen in
any animal with anticoagulant therapy for the duration of study.
Normal right heart function was observed with ultrasound 8
weeks post-surgery and at animal ages of 30 and 50 weeks.
Since we used biodegradable sutures that have a 4-week half-
life, rapid host cell invasion and subsequent matrix deposition
were necessary to fuse the anastomoses. Since we saw a uniform
flow tract in all animals at all time points, it was apparent that the
matrix fused with the pulmonary artery at the anastomoses before
suture degradation. Although the exact timeline of cell invasion
and fusion is not known for this study, we have previously shown
that grafts harvested after 8 weeks in the femoral artery position
had complete endothelial coverage near the anastomoses and
invasion of a-SMA positive cells from the surrounding tissue27.
Hence, it was not surprising in this study that sufficient
extracellular matrix was deposited to ensure fusion at the
anastomoses before the critical suture degradation point.
While the grafts were implanted as straight tubes, curvature
around the aorta (as seen in the native pulmonary artery) was
observed in the first ultrasound following implantation (8 weeks).
Initially, this would most likely be due to physical forces on the
graft; however, the cells invading the matrix remodelled the graft
over time, while maintaining this physiological geometry.
Importantly, graft diameter and length increased over the
duration of implantation, with diameter increased to the same
degree as seen in the adjacent pulmonary artery. The uniform
growth of the graft in all three animals contributed to the laminar
flow profiles and normal pressure gradient across the grafts based
on ultrasound examination. For comparison, in a growing lamb
study using synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) conduits, a
20 mm Hg increase in pressure gradient developed within 1 year
of implantation31. At the 50-week ultrasounds, it was challenging
to visually discern the actual anastomotic locations as there was
no narrowing, dilation or other markings to differentiate the graft
and pulmonary artery, which had indistinguishable diameters.
Evaluation of the explanted grafts confirmed uniform growth
with diameters matching the adjacent artery and no difference in
axial mechanical properties between the native artery above the
graft, the anastomotic region, and the graft.
The explant graft volume increased by 216% over the course of
implant, which was comparable to 244% volumetric increase of
the pulmonary artery measured by Gottlieb et al. with magnetic
resonance imaging32. For animal weight gains from 15 kg to

 65 kg, they also reported cross-sectional area of the pulmonary
artery increased from B300 mm2 to B600 mm2, or a B42%
increase in diameter, which is also comparable to the 56%
increase in diameter observed for our graft.
The strongest evidence of growth was seen when evaluating the
mechanical property measurements and total collagen content
together. No substantial change in mechanical properties between
pre-implant and post-implant graft was seen even though the
graft volume increased by 216%. This was most likely due to
465% more collagen measured in the explanted grafts, which
appeared highly organized. Additionally, the new collagen was
apparently deposited with the same circumferential alignment as
the pre-implant graft, since strong mechanical anisotropy existed
in the explanted tissue. In comparison, autologous cell-seeded
polymeric grafts implanted by Hoerstrup et al.23 showed
significantly higher stiffness of explanted grafts compared
with pulmonary artery; however, no anisotropic properties were
reported23. Although the collagen concentration in the explanted
grafts (325–398 ug collagen mg � 1 dry weight assuming a conver-
sion factor from wet weight to dry weight of 0.20) was higher
than in the explanted and control pulmonary arteries, it was in
the range reported by Dahl et al. (420–570 ug mg � 1) for their
implanted and explanted engineered arteries29. This higher
collagen content could explain the higher tensile modulus
relative to the adjacent pulmonary artery. It is unknown
whether it resulted in a lower compliance, as compliance was
not measured in this study, and we relied on the tangent modulus
for a direct comparison of intrinsic tissue stiffness (that is, at
strains beyond which structural changes likely occur, albeit
beyond physiological strains, independent of pre-load artifacts).
Compliance mismatch can lead to turbulent flow through
vascular grafts and intimal hyperplasia33,34; however, these were
not
observed,
indicating
any
compliance
mismatch
was
inconsequential.
Histologically, the graft exhibited substantial host cell invasion
and deposition of matrix proteins comparable to the pulmonary
artery. Although the pulmonary artery had B42% more cells,
histological comparisons showed that the explanted grafts also
contained mature, circumferentially-aligned smooth muscle cells
and a complete endothelium with basement membrane. Further,
the endothelial cells appeared to be in a non-activated phenotype
(absence of E-selectin binding). While sustained heparin was used
to ensure clotting would not occur, these results suggest it could
have been terminated at some point before the explantation
without risk of clotting due to the development of a non-activated
endothelium. How this time-point could best be ascertained in
the clinical setting is an interesting question. In a previous study
of 4 mm diameter grafts implanted interpositionally into the
sheep femoral artery, we removed all anticoagulants after 8 weeks
of implantation and no evidence of thrombosis was observed at
the 9-week explant35.
Histology of the explants also revealed an absence of two
critical failure mechanisms, calcification (negligible von Kossa
staining) and an immune response (negligible CD45 staining).
Calcification of animal-derived valves and vessels treated with
glutaraldehyde to mitigate an immunological response is a
common failure mode, being particularly problematic in pediatric
patients36. Since our ovine matrix was produced by a donor ovine
cell entrapped in a bovine fibrin gel and cultured in FBS, the
apparent absence of an immune response indicates the antigenic
load following the decellularization plus any remnant fibrin
or other bovine proteins was insufficient to elicit an immune
response. Clinical use will require use of human dermal
fibroblasts to minimize risk of a xenogeneic response to the
cell-produced matrix; we have shown the ability to create human
matrix tubes with properties comparable to ovine matrix tubes of
the same diameter with this fabrication process28.
In our explanted grafts, elastin content was at 49% compared
with pulmonary artery, with mature elastic fibers visible with
Verhoeff’s stain. In a previous growing lamb model, Hoerstrup
et al.23 did not measure elastin and detected none via histology.
Brennan et al.22 showed 47.2% more elastin deposition when
synthetic polymer scaffold was pre-seeded with autologous cells
compared with a cell-free scaffold. In comparison to pulmonary
artery, Brennan et al.22 reported elastin content at 51% in their
pre-seeded grafts after 26 weeks of implantation. Taking mature
elastin as a marker for positive growth and remodelling, this
acellular cell-produced matrix tube can thus remodel similar to
pre-cellularized polymer grafts reported in previous studies. It
is difficult to ascertain the contribution of the deposited
elastin
to
the
measured
tensile
mechanical
properties
because of the lack of specificity of elastase in treating tissue
to
selectively
remove
elastin
(unpublished
data).
Notwithstanding,
mechanical
testing
of
elastase-treated
arteries
from
a
mouse
model
of
Marfan
syndrome
in
conjunction with a multi-fiber hyperelastic constitutive model
was used to elucidate the role of elastin in load-bearing and
undulation of collagen fibers37. Studies in newborn knockout
mice lacking the elastin protein (Eln � / � ) have shown
dramatically
increased
arterial
wall
stiffness,
and
elastin
haploinsufficient mice (Eln þ / � ) that produce only half of
the elastin found in normal mice exhibit near-normal arterial
wall stiffness at birth but postnatal remodelling and stiffening
into adulthood38. Thus, it is not surprising that our explanted
grafts
exhibited
tensile
mechanical
properties
differing
somewhat from the pulmonary artery.

 Overall, this is the first report of an ‘off-the-shelf’’ tissue-
engineered vascular graft implanted in a growing lamb model that
exhibited somatic growth and normal physiological function for
nearly 1 year. All three implanted grafts were extensively
recellularized (including complete endothelialization), with orga-
nized collagen and elastin deposition, and no evidence of
calcification or aneurysm. They may thus serve as permanent
conduits for pediatric cardiac vessel repair, reconstruction, and
replacement.
Methods
Engineered tissue tubes. Ovine dermal fibroblast-seeded fibrin gels were formed
by adding thrombin (Sigma) and calcium chloride in 20 mM HEPES-buffered
saline to a suspension of cells (ovine dermal fibroblast from Coriell) and bovine
fibrinogen (Sigma). The final component concentrations of the suspension were as
follows: 4 mg ml � 1 fibrinogen, 0.38 U ml � 1 thrombin, 5.0 mM Ca þ þ and 1
million cells ml � 1. The suspensions were mixed and injected into a tubular glass
mold. The tubular grafts were cultured statically for 2-weeks and then transferred
to custom pulsed-flow-stretch bioreactors for an additional 5-week maturation
period using cyclic stretching with the strain amplitude increased from 3 to 7% at
rate of 1% per week39.
Following bioreactor conditioning, the tubes were decellularized. First the tubes
were placed on an orbital shaker at room temperature for 6 h with 1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma) followed by 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min,
extensively washed with PBS for 2 weeks at 4 �C, and then incubated at 37 �C
in 2 U ml � 1 deoxyribonuclease (Worthington Biochemical, DR1) in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS overnight. Grafts were sterilely stored at 4 �C until use
in phosphate buffer solution.
Graft implant in growing lamb model. Tissue-engineered ovine grafts were
implanted as pulmonary artery replacements in n ¼ 3 Dorset lambs (average
weight: 15.3 kg; average age at implant: 8.4 weeks; two male, one female). All
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of Minnesota and conform to NIH guidelines on Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. The surgeries were performed by the University of Minne-
sota’s Experimental Surgical Services. For all animals, anesthesia was induced by
administering 10 mg kg � 1 Ketamine (intramuscular) and 2–6 mg kg � 1 propofol
(intravenously). Animals were then incubated and maintained on isoflurane at
1–3% for the duration of surgery and monitored for heart rate, mean blood
pressure, fixed pupil location, corneal reflex absence and oxygen saturation to
ensure proper anesthesia. The heart was exposed by a left lateral thoracotomy with
dissection through the intercostal space. The animal was heparinized (250 IU kg � 1,
intravenously) and placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. The grafts were implanted
interpositionally using continuous 5-0 Maxon CV (Covidien) degradable sutures
after excising a similar length of the native main pulmonary artery. The native
pulmonary valve was left intact. In addition, prolene sutures were used to attach
two silver clips on the native pulmonary artery near the anastomoses to serve as
markers (Fig. 1f).
Post-surgery, animals received subcutaneous 750 IU heparin BID for the
duration of the study. For pain, animal received ketoprofen 1–2 mg kg � 1
(intramuscular) every 12–24 h as directed by the post-operative veterinarian.
Additionally slow release buphenorphine 0.27 mg kg � 1 (SQ) was given before
induction of anesthesia. Animals for the study were numbered as PAC1, PAC2 and
PAC3. The first ultrasound was performed 8 weeks following implantation. The
second and third ultrasounds were done when the animals were 30 weeks old and
before euthanasia at 50 weeks of age, respectively. Conduit dimensions, pressure
drop, flow velocity and flow profile (laminar or turbulent characteristics) were
measured from the ultrasound. Diameter and flow velocity were measured
mid-graft, and pressure drop was determined from velocity measurements
mid-graft and just beyond the distal anastomosis. Animals were heparinized
(300 IU kg � 1, intravenously) and then euthanized with beuthanasia given
intravenously at 87–90 mg kg � 1. Explanted grafts were photographed, cleaned of
loose connective tissue, and then dissected into strips for histological, biochemical
and mechanical characterization. N ¼ 3 non-surgical aged-match (50 week old)
sheep hearts were also collected and right ventricle wall thickness and pulmonary
artery diameter were measured. Samples from these control arteries were also
evaluated for tensile mechanical properties, biochemical analysis and
immunohistochemistry.
Mechanical testing. Tissue strips were cut from the engineered tissue tube before
implant (n ¼ 5) and following explant (n ¼ 3) with dimensions of B2 mm � 10
mm in both the circumferential and axial directions. In addition, non-surgical
control samples were collected from the age-matched control sheep (n ¼ 3) and the
explanted pulmonary artery (n ¼ 3). Following explant, additional axial strips were
cut that consisted of half native pulmonary artery and half engineered tissue from
the anastomotic regions. All samples were measured for dimensions and then
tested for tensile mechanical properties using an Instron mechanical testing system
and compression grips. The sample was stretched at constant rate of 10 mm min � 1
(strain rate of B5% per second). The tangent modulus (E) was defined as the slope
of the linear region of the stress–strain curve before failure. The peak stress was
defined as UTS. Maximum tension was defined as the UTS multiplied by the
average thickness and used in case all layers of a sample do not bear equal amounts
of load40. Mechanical anisotropy was defined as the ratio of the modulus of tissue
samples cut in the circumferential direction to the modulus of samples cut from the
tissue in the axial direction.
Suture tension properties were evaluated in accordance with ISO 7198. Briefly,
a 7-0 prolene suture (Ethicon Cat#8648G) was passed through a circumferential
tissue strip (B10 mm � 10 mm) 2 mm from the free edge. The suture was tied into
a loop and pulled at 50 mm min � 1 axially at constant rate until failure using an
Instron mechanical testing system. The maximum force before rupture was defined
as suture retention force. A thinner 7-0 suture was used, instead of 5-0 suture as
used for surgery, to give a conservative estimate of retention force.
Tissue composition and DNA analysis. The collagen mass content was quanti-
fied using a hydroxyproline assay previously described41 assuming 7.46 mg of
collagen per 1 mg of hydroxyproline. Insoluble elastin was measured by dissolving
tissue strip samples in NaOH and using a modified ninhydrin assay to measure
elastin42. The total protein content was measured using the ninhydrin assay43. The
tissue volume was calculated using the measured length, width and thickness of the
samples (reported in units of ml) was then used to calculate the sample mass
concentration (mg protein ml � 1 tissue) of collagen, total protein and elastin. For
total mass content of the pre-implant grafts (n ¼ 5) and explanted grafts (n ¼ 3)
and the control and explanted pulmonary artery segments (n ¼ 3), length, width
and thickness of the entire graft or arterial segment were used to measure total
volume, which was then multiplied by the respective sample mass concentration
(collagen, total protein or elastin). The DNA content was quantified with a
modified Hoechst assay for total DNA44.
Histology and immunostaining. Each explanted graft was histologically and
immunologically stained; multiple strips were cut to cover all regions of interest.
Circumferential and axial tissue strips of pre-implant and explanted grafts were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek), and frozen in
liquid N2. Cross sections of 9-mm thickness were stained with Lillie’s trichrome,
Verhoeff-Van Gieson elastin stain, and picrosirius red stain. Histological sections
were also immunostained for a-SMA (Sigma, A5228, clone#ACTA2, monoclonal
Mouse, 1:200 dilution), Calponin (Abcam ab46794, clone# EP798Y, monoclonal
Rabbit, 1:100 dilution), vimentin (Abcam, ab80667, clone#V9, monoclonal Mouse,
1:1000 dilution), Smoothelin (Calbiochem 400080Clone#R4A, monoclonal Mouse,
1:100 dilution), Von Willebrand Factor (Abcam ab6994, polyclonal Rabbit, 1:200
dilution), E-selectin (CD62E, Abcam, ab122964, polyclonal Rabbit, 1:200 dilution),
CD45 (US Biological C2399-07B, clone#10B1601, monoclonal Mouse, 1:200
dilution), Ki67 (Abcam ab15580, polyclonal Rabbit, 1:400 dilution), elastin
(Abcam ab21599, clone#BA4, monoclonal Mouse, 1:1000 dilution) and collagen IV
(Abcam, ab6586, polyclonal Rabbit, 1:200 dilution). All samples were blocked with
5% normal donkey serum, incubated in primary antibody at 2.5–5 ug ml � 1 and
stained with a Cy5-conjugated, species-matched secondary antibody (Jackson
Immunoresearch). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen
H3570). Positive controls For E-Selectin staining were generated by incubating a
fresh section of sheep femoral artery (1 cm segment) and a monolayer of cultured
endothelial cells in a 48-well plate overnight with tumour-necrosis factor-a
(R&D Systems 210-TA) at a concentration of 50 ng ml � 1 in EBM-2 medium
(Lonza CC-3156).
Statistics. Average value are plotted with ‘n’ value shown in figure legend. The s.d.
is reported as error bars for all averaged values. Statistical significance for differ-
ences between two groups was determined using Student’s t-test when comparing
two groups and analysis of variance with Tukey post-hoc analysis for more than
two groups. Paired symbols are used in figures to represent statistical difference
between two groups. Any reference to a difference in the Results and Discussion
sections implies statistical significance at the level Po0.05.
