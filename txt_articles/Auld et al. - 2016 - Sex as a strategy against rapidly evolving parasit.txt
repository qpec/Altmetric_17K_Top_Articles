Why is sex ubiquitous when asexual reproduction is much less costly? Sex
disrupts coadapted gene complexes; it also causes costs associated with
mate finding and the production of males who do not themselves bear off-
spring. Theory predicts parasites select for host sex, because genetically
variable offspring can escape infection from parasites adapted to infect the
previous generations. We examine this using a facultative sexual crustacean,
Daphnia magna, and its sterilizing bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa. We
obtained sexually and asexually produced offspring from wild-caught hosts
and exposed them to contemporary parasites or parasites isolated from the
same population one year later. We found rapid parasite adaptation to repli-
cate within asexual but not sexual offspring. Moreover, sexually produced
offspring were twice as resistant to infection as asexuals when exposed to para-
sites that had coevolved alongside their parents (i.e. the year two parasite).
This fulfils the requirement that the benefits of sex must be both large and
rapid for sex to be favoured by selection.
1. Background
One of the great paradoxes of biology isthat sex isthe dominant mode of reproduc-
tion when asexual reproduction is much less costly [1–3]. When all else is equal,
asexual populations have a higher effective birth rate than sexual populations,
because asexuals do not produce males [3], benefit from coadapted gene com-
plexes that sexual recombination would break apart, and avoid the many and
varied costs associated with securing a suitable mate. Asexuals should rapidlyout-
compete their sexual counterparts [4], yet in reality, sex is the dominant mode of
reproduction among Eukaryotes [5]. All else is clearly not equal.
Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain why sex dominates
over asex [5,6]. Chief among them is the Red Queen hypothesis, which states
that parasite-mediated selection is strongest against common contemporary
host genotypes [7–10]. Red Queen dynamics may favour sex over asex, because
sex (specifically, recombination associated with sex) can recycle alleles in such a
way to continually generate novel resistance genotypes on which selection can
act, thus maintaining host fitness despite endlessly evolving virulent parasite
populations [11,12]. There is compelling evidence that parasites can generate
this strong selective force: previous work has demonstrated that parasites adapt
to locally common host genotypes in time or space [13–16].
A productive method for testing whether parasitism favours sex over asex
involves comparing parasite resistance of obligately asexual and sexual host
lineages of a particular host species [16–18]. Such studies have effectively demon-
strated that obligate sexual lineages can outcompete obligate asexual lineages in
the face of parasitism. A complementary, though more rarely used, approach that
provides a direct test of the benefits of sex over asex involves using facultative
sexual organisms to compare the parasite susceptibility of sexual and asexual off-
spring from a single parent. Kelley et al. [19] demonstrated that sexually produced
offspring of the grass, Anthoxanthum odoratum had higher reproductive rates than
their asexually produced counterparts when planted near the maternal plant in a

 biologically realistic scenario; a subsequent study found that
such differences could be explained by differences in suscepti-
bility to a virus [20]. Here, we directly test the role of host
reproductive mode on parasite resistance using a facultative
sexual host, the crustacean Daphnia magna, and its sterilizing
bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa.
Wecollected healthywildD. magnathat were carrying sexual
eggs, and Pasteuria isolates from a natural pond population. By
allowing the healthy Daphnia to revert to asexual reproduction
after releasing their sexual eggs, and by hatching the sexuals
and maintaining them in a clonal state, we were able to take a
genetic snapshot of both the maternal (asexual) and offspring
(sexual) generation(seealso [21], whoused this methodto exam-
ine Daphnia inbreeding in the wild and in the laboratory). To test
the effect of rapid parasite evolution on offspring fitness, we col-
lected additional Pasteuria isolates from the same population the
following year. Ordinarily, in UK populations, Daphnia can only
pass sexual offspring on into the next year, because only sexual
eggs can undergo diapause and withstand winter conditions.
However, this simple time-shift experiment allowed us to simu-
late host strategies where either asexually produced eggs can
survive to hatch in the subsequent year, or sexually produced
eggs hatch immediately and face a non-evolved parasite popu-
lation. Indeed, previous time-shift experiments have taught us
much about the nature of host2parasite coevolution [22].
Here, we recorded the two principal infection characteristics:
proportion of hosts infected and Pasteuria transmission spore
density per infected host. By analysing both the overall trends
and underlying family-level genetic correlations, we were able
to add to previous workexaminingtherelativefitness of sexually
and asexually produced offspring [19,23]. Collectively, our find-
ings demonstrate that the parasite population evolved rapidly in
the field, whereas our laboratory experiments indicate temporal
changes in parasite-mediated selection on host genotypes,
favouring host sex over asex.
2. Methods
(a) Study system
In natural populations, sexually produced Daphnia eggs hatch in
the spring, and develop into adultsthat reproduce asexually. Daph-
nia later undergo sex as population density (and often parasite
prevalence) peaks [24,25], then revert to asexual reproduction.
The sexually produced eggs are deposited in the sediment and
remain in a state of diapause; these diapausing sexual eggs hatch
in the next or subsequent years to face a parasite population
shaped by coevolution with previous host generations [14,26].
Daphnia are orally infected by P. ramosa, a sterilizing bacterial para-
site, throughout the season (lasting from spring to early winter:
[26]). The likelihood of infection depends on genotypic specificity,
i.e. the precise combination of Daphnia and Pasteuria spore geno-
types [27]. When infection does occur, it leads to complete and
rapid host sterilization, and, after a period of within-host growth,
Pasteuria transmission spores are released from dead hosts [28].
(b) Sampling and experimental protocol
In June 2013 (year one), we collected 100 P. ramosa-infected
D. magna, and 52 healthy female Daphnia-carrying ephippia
(the melanized case containing one or two sexually produced
eggs) from a natural population at Kaimes Farm, Leitholm,
Scottish
Borders,
UK
(282004300W,
5584201500N;
see
[26]).
One year later (June 2014; year two), we collected another 100
Pasteuria-infected Daphnia. Individual infected Daphnia contained
0.4–6.1 million Pasteuria transmission spores.
Once in the laboratory, we homogenized infected females,
pooled the resulting spore suspensions according to collection
year and stored them at 2208C. Healthy females were kept indi-
vidually in the laboratory; once they released their ephippia, the
mothers returned to asexual reproduction (these offspring were
used to establish the asexual genotype line for each family). We
washed the ephippia in 10% bleach, and then kept them individu-
ally in 1 ml artificial medium [29] modified using one-twentieth of
the recommended selenium dioxide (SeO2) concentration [30].
Ephippia were exposed to natural sunlight on a windowsill and
were monitored daily for hatching. Twenty-one of the 54 ephippia
hatched (10 ephippia yielded one offspring, 11 ephippia yielded
two offspring). There were 21 Daphnia ‘families’: 10 families con-
sisted of one asexual and one sexual genotype; 11 families
consisted of one asexual and two sexual genotypes (figure 1).
We maintained eight independent replicates for each Daphnia
genotype for three generations to minimize variation in condition
that

maternal, or epigenetic effects. Animals were kept in jars contain-
ing 200 ml of modified artificial medium and fed 1.0 ABS
Chlorella vulgaris algal cells per Daphnia per day (ABS is the opti-
cal absorbance of 650 nm white light by the Chlorella culture). We
refreshed their medium three times per week. There were five
Daphnia per jar and jars were incubated at 208C on a 12 light
(L) : 12 dark (D) light cycle. The second-clutch neonates from
the third generation were used for the experiment.
We allocated neonates from each maternal family genotype to
one of two parasite infection treatments (yearone or year two para-
sites), following a split clutch design. There were eight replicates
per host genotype per parasite treatment. Each experimental repli-
cate consisted of eight hosts kept in 200 ml of artificial medium.
Parasite exposures were conducted as follows: replicates received
1 � 105 Pasteuria spores from either year one or year two isolates.
Replicates were stirred daily and fed low food (0.5 ABS Chlorella
per Daphnia per day) for the duration of parasite exposure to
increase spore uptake by hosts. Parasite exposure lasted 5 days.
After the parasite exposure period, replicates were changed into
fresh medium and given standard food (1.0 ABS Chlorella per
Daphnia per day). Replicates received fresh medium three times
per week and the experiment lasted for 30 days. We visually
scored the proportion of infected hosts on experimental day 20.
On day 30, Daphnia from each replicate were pooled, homogenized
with 100 ml of ddH2O, and three independent counts were
made from the resulting suspension using a Neubauer (improved)
counting chamber (0.0025 mm2 � 0.1 mm depth).

 (c) Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the MCMCglmm
(Markov Chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model)
package in R 3.0.2 [31,32] (all data are deposited in Dryad
doi:10.5061/dryad.nk27 k). This approach to linear mixed-effects
model analysis allowed us to estimate confidence intervals on the
magnitude of our random effects and on the genetic covariances
across different treatment conditions. We fitted three models.
First, we ensured the sampled asexual genotypes were geneti-
cally diverse by quantifying the proportion of the variance in
host resistance to year one parasites that was explained by the
identity of the asexual genotypes (model 1). Next, using data
for both sexual and asexual genotypes and parasite isolates
from both years, we tested the effects of reproductive mode
(asexual or sexual) and year of parasite collection (year one or
year two) on both the proportion of infected hosts (model 2)
and the density of parasite spores in infected hosts (model 3).
For all three models, we used Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo techniques to estimate the posterior mode and 95% cred-
ible intervals (CIs) for the fixed effects of host reproductive
mode, parasite year, and their interaction.
For model code, see the electronic supplementary material.
In model 1, we fitted host genotype as a random effect to the infec-
tion risk data for the asexual genotypes and year one parasite
isolate only (the model contained no fixed effects). For models 2
and 3, we fitted random effects for host genotype, as well as for
host family (each family comprised one asexual and up to two
sexually derived sister genotypes). For the family random effect,
we specified an unstructured variance2covariance matrix with
an interaction between family, reproductive mode, and parasite
year. This unstructured matrix allowed for heterogeneity in the
between-family variance across each of the four reproductive
mode-by-parasite year combinations, as well as covariance
between the family means under each of these four treatments.
We allowed the residual variance in infection to differ between
parasite isolates from the two years. The data for the proportion
of infected hosts in each jar were logit-transformed (models 1
and 2) and the spore densities were log-transformed (model 3) to
achieve a Gaussian distribution. The MCMCglmm models had
parameter-expanded priors and were run for 1 300 000 iterations,
with a burn-in of 300 000, sampling each 250th iteration. Autocor-
relation was low among consecutive thinned observations,
variance terms, and fixed effects (all less than 0.04). We tested
for, and found, convergence using the Heidelberger and Welch sta-
tionarity diagnostic [33]. Further, Gelman2Rubin diagnostics [34]
demonstrated that multiple model runs converged on the same
posterior distribution (three runs yielded a multivariate potential
scale reduction factor of 1.00).
3. Results
(a) Host sex and infection risk
The asexual genotypes we sampled from the wild differed in
their resistance to parasitism (figure 2): when challenged
with the year one parasite isolate, the proportion of infected
hosts varied from 0.08 to 0.87, and differences between host
genotypes explained a high proportion (0.59+ 0.41–0.75
95% CIs) of the random effect variance.
When hosts were challenged with the year one parasite, the
difference in resistance between asexual and sexual offspring
was small and non-significant (figure 3a: reproductive mode
effect
PMCMC ¼ 0.09;
electronic
supplementary
material,
table S1). Crucially, when offspring were exposed to year
two parasites, which had coevolved alongside their parents
in the previous year, the asexually produced genotypes had
low resistance to infection (46% infected), whereas sexually
produced offspring were over twice as resistant (15% infected,
figure 3a: reproductive mode � parasite year interaction
PMCMC ¼ 0.01; electronic supplementary material, table S1).
These changes in infection risk were specifically associated
with host sex; they were not driven by a general change in para-
site infectivity across years (parasite year effect PMCMC ¼ 0.91;
electronic supplementary material, table S1).
We also found that infection risk was highly correlated
between the sexual and asexual genotypes of each family
when challenged with year one parasites (figure 3b,c),
demonstrating a strong heritable component to parasite
resistance. By contrast, there was no correlation in resistance
between asexuals exposed to year one parasites and asexuals
exposed to year two parasites (i.e. when the host genetic
background is identical but the parasite samples differ); this
confirms the wild parasite population rapidly evolved over
the course of a single year (figure 3b,d). The genetic corre-

 to year two parasites) was also absent; moreover, the rank
order of host family infection risk changed across parasite iso-
lates (figure 3c,e), demonstrating that parasite evolution
exerts temporally shifting selection on the host population
over very short timescales.
(b) Host sex and parasite within-host growth
After just one year of parasite evolution in the wild, parasite
within-host growth was 48% greater within asexually derived
host offspring (figure 4a: parasite year effect PMCMC ¼ 0.002;
electronic
supplementary
material,
table
S1).
Sexually
produced daughters were not intrinsically better than asexual
daughters at resisting the year one parasite within-host
growth (reproductive mode effect PMCMC ¼ 0.81; electronic
supplementary material, table S1). However, we found
some evidence that sexually produced daughters were
better at resisting within-host growth of the year two parasite
(which has an immediate coevolutionary history with the
maternal host generation): sexual genotypes had half the
mean spore burden of their asexual counterparts (the host
reproductive mode by parasite year interaction was marginally
significant PMCMC ¼ 0.07; electronic supplementary material,
table S1). Further analysis revealed there were no signifi-
cant genetic correlations for parasite within-host growth
comparing across parasite isolates and host reproductive
modes (figure 4b–e).
4. Discussion
Studies that directly test the effect of reproductive mode on
host resistance to parasitism by comparing the sexual and
asexual offspring of a single parent are very rare, and are
mainly limited to plant2parasite systems. A short-term benefit
of sex over asex was found in a grass system [21], which was
driven by variation in resistance to a virus [20]. Although a
similar study conducted with wild garlic found that sex was
not only disadvantageous compared with asex, but also that
common genotypes were favoured by selection [23]. Our
study used a facultative sexual animal host. The host popu-
lation we sampled contained a diversity of asexual clones
that varied significantly in their parasite resistance (figure 2).
We tested whether host sexual reproduction provided an
advantage over asexual reproduction for defence against a
highly virulent coevolving parasite. Because selection only
favours traits that provide an immediate fitness advantage,
the benefits of sex must be both large and occur rapidly for it
to be favoured overasex [3]. We found a rapid and considerable
advantage of sex over asex in terms of host offspring resistance
to sterilizing infection; this advantage emerged when host

 offspring were challenged with field-collected parasites that
had coevolved for just one year with the parental host
generation (figure 3).
A key advantage in our approach is that we could examine
the genetic correlations for infection traits between asexual
and sexually produced offspring, i.e. the correlations between
resistance in offspring generated by asexual and sexual
reproduction when challenged with contemporary or future
parasites. This allowed us to test three key hypotheses that
are fundamental to a benefit of sex: (i) a heritable component
to disease resistance, (ii) rapid parasite evolution, and (iii) tem-
porally shifting parasite-mediated selection on the host
population. Heritability of resistance is demonstrated by a sig-
nificant correlation between resistance in asexual and sexual
offspring challenged with year one parasites. Rapid parasite
evolution is demonstrated by an absence of a correlation
between the resistance of asexual genotypes exposed to year
one parasites and the same asexuals exposed to year two para-
sites. The absence of a correlation occurred, because there was a
dramatic change in the susceptibility rank order of asexual gen-
otypes when they were challenged with the different parasite
isolates collected only one year apart. This change in genotypic
rank order demonstrates that parasite-mediated selection
pressures changed between years, consistent with the Red
Queen theory.
Theories of sex hypothesize that parasite evolution rapidly
erodes the fitness of lineages that reproduce asexually [12].
Contrary to expectations, we did not find that asexuals exposed
to year two parasites suffered more infections than asexuals to
year one parasites. However, we did find support for this
hypothesis in a second infection metric: parasite burdens
within infected hosts. There was strong evidence for rapid para-
site adaptation to grow within asexually produced offspring
that were genetically identical to their mothers (figure 4).
These findings convincingly support previous studies that
have demonstrated evolution in the Pasteuria parasite [26,35].
Further analysis revealed there were no significant genetic cor-
relations for parasite within-host growth comparing across
parasite isolates and host reproductive modes (figure 4b–e).
This result was expected, as parasite within-host growth is
dependent on the precise combination of co-infecting parasite
genotypes and on the order in which these genotypes arrive
[36]. This stands in contrast to our findings concerning
infection risk, because infection risk depends chiefly on the
interactions between host and parasite genotype (i.e. genotypic
specificity [27,37]).

 The evolution of increased parasite growth on asexually
produced genotypes reflects rapid parasite adaptation over
the course of a single year. Nevertheless, this adaptation pro-
vides the parasite with no benefit for replication within the
genetically novel sexual genotypes that exist in the following
season (figure 3a). Because Daphnia undergo sexual reproduc-
tion before a peak in the epidemic [25] and sexual eggs hatch in
future years, sexually produced offspring ‘opt out’ of parasite-
mediated selection in the current year, i.e. they disperse
through time. Early season sex means hosts archive genetic
variation in resistance for the future in the same way that
plant populations often have a seed bank. Importantly, this
genetic archiving occurs before parasite-mediated selection
has the opportunity to strip genetic variation from the standing
host population (figures 3 and 4).
After undergoing sexual reproduction and releasing
diapausing (sexual) eggs, Daphnia mothers return to repro-
ducing asexually [25]. This return to asex after sexual
reproduction may increase the likelihood that some asexually
produced daughters successfully overwinter and survive into
the next season (provided that the winter is not unduly
harsh). However, overwintering asexuals would suffer greater
parasite burdens than their sexually derived counterparts and
are thus likely to be outcompeted. If obligately asexual geno-
types of D. magna emerged, they would be a prime target for
parasite adaptation and would therefore be rapidly purged
from the population (figure 4).
Our hosts and parasites were all isolated from a natural
population and the parasite evolution that selected for host
sex occurred under natural conditions. Our laboratory infection
experiments demonstrate the potential for rapidly evolving and
virulent parasitesto select for sex in thewild. Other studies have
shown parasite-mediated fitness differences between obligate
asexual and sexual lineages in the field [16–18]. Such studies
can capture host–parasite interactions in truly natural settings,
though this comes with the cost that one cannot exclude the
possibility that lineages differ for reasons other than reproduc-
tive mode. Our approach, which uses a facultative sexual host,
enables direct comparisons between individuals that differ only
in their reproductive mode. We must, however, acknowledge
that sexual and asexual progeny of Daphnia would not ordina-
rily compete in natural populations, because sexually and
asexually produced offspring are present in populations at
different times. Also, while Pasteuria infection prevalences in
our experiment are similar to those in the wild, the exposure
regime is artificial. Laboratory and field-based approaches are
bound by a trade-off between ecological realism and exper-
imental control; they, nevertheless, complement one another
and collectively demonstrate that parasites can provide the
strong selective force needed to maintain sexual reproduction.
In summary, our study demonstrates a benefit of host sex in
the face of a rapidly evolving parasite, which is realized within
a very short timescale. This is particularly important, because
the parasite is highly virulent [27], which means host resistance
is strongly associated with fitness. Our findings therefore sup-
port theory that genetic recombination enables unfit mothers to
give rise to fit offspring provided that the direction of selection
fluctuates rapidly, and are consistent with the Red Queen
hypothesis [12].
