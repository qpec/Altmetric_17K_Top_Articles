Metastasis is the primary cause for mortality in breast cancer. MicroRNAs, gene expression
master regulators, constitute an attractive candidate to control metastasis. Here we show
that breast cancer metastasis can be prevented by miR-96 or miR-182 treatment, and
decipher the mechanism of action. We found that miR-96/miR-182 downregulate Palladin
protein levels, thereby reducing breast cancer cell migration and invasion. A common
SNP, rs1071738, at the miR-96/miR-182-binding site within the Palladin 30-UTR abolishes
miRNA:mRNA binding, thus diminishing Palladin regulation by these miRNAs. Regulation
is successfully restored by applying complimentary miRNAs. A hydrogel-embedded,
gold-nanoparticle-based delivery vehicle provides efficient local, selective, and sustained
release of miR-96/miR-182, markedly suppressing metastasis in a breast cancer mouse
model. Combined delivery of the miRNAs with a chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, enables
significant primary tumour shrinkage and metastasis prevention. Our data corroborate
the role of miRNAs in metastasis, and suggest miR-96/miR-182 delivery as a potential
anti-metastatic drug.

etastases are the primary cause for mortality in breast
cancer, the most common cancer in women regardless
of ethnicity1. In fact, one in eight women are diagnosed
with and develop invasive/metastatic breast cancer2. Metastasis
is a multi-step process, comprised of a series of sequential steps,
starting
with
epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition,
local
migration and invasion of cancer cells from the primary
tumour to the surrounding host tissue, intravasation into
blood or lymphatic vessels, dissemination via the blood or
lymphatic stream, extravasation to distant organ, survival in
dormancy and finally proliferation and angiogenesis within the
organ3–5. Only a unique subpopulation of primary tumour cells
that acquire special traits (arising from specific gene expression)
that allow the cells to successfully complete all these steps
will survive and produce secondary metastases4,5. Hence, each
step in that process provides potential targets for metastasis
prevention. However, currently, breast cancer therapy lacks
effective anti-metastatic strategies6.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that
negatively regulate gene expression. and are highly associated
with tumorigenicity, invasion, and metastasis7. Precise sequence
complementation between the seed region, comprising bases 2-8
from the 50 end of the miRNA, and its binding-site within the
30 untranslated region (30-UTR) of the target mRNA is necessary
to
exert
the
downregulation
effect.
Recent
studies
show
that germline sequence variants, such as single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA-binding sites, can disrupt the
downregulation by miRNAs, with a profound effect on gene
expression levels and consequentially on the phenotype, including
increased risk for cancer8–10. In the current study, we aim to
determine the potential effect of SNPs within miRNA-binding
sites on metastatic breast cancer progression and their potential
use as suppression targets to prevent metastasis, representing an
urgent therapeutic need6 (see Fig. 1 for schematic study design).
Bioinformatics analysis identified a SNP, which potentially
influences breast cancer metastasis. This SNP, rs1071738, was
found to be located in a target site for miR-96 and miR-182 on
the 30-UTR of the PALLD gene, which encodes the Palladin
actin-associated
protein,
a
documented
player
in
breast
cancer motility11–13. In vitro experiments revealed a functional
downregulation of Palladin levels by miR-96 and miR-182, which
subsequently
reduces
migration
and
invasion
abilities
of
breast cancer cells. However, the miRNAs regulate Palladin in a
SNP-genotype dependent manner, that is, Palladin regulations is
disrupted by the SNP allele that abolish the binding of the
miRNA to its target mRNA. Applying complimentary engineered
miR-96 or miR-182 enables restoration of Palladin regulation. An
in vivo experiment showed that the use of nanoparticles
embedded in a hydrogel scaffold as a miRNA delivery vehicle
enables an efficient and specific delivery of miR-96/miR-182 to
breast tumours, which results in marked reduction of breast
cancer metastasis. Moreover, intercalation of a chemotherapy
drug, cisplatin, to the miR-conjugated nanoparticles further
improves the effect, leading to significant reduction in both
primary tumour growth and metastasis. Our study highlights the
therapeutic potential of miRNAs, and specifically miR-96 and
miR-182, and support the importance of Palladin regulation in
breast cancer metastasis.
Results
PALLD SNP as breast cancer metastasis functional variant. To
determine the potential effect of SNPs within miRNA-binding
sites on metastatic breast cancer progression, we initially
generated a cross section list of such potentially functional
variants. We utilized a stepwise omic-data integration approach.
In step I, we intersected a list of breast cancer genes (based on
PubMed, see Methods section) with two additional data sets:
TargetScan, a database of conserved miRNA target sites, and
dbSNP, a database of known SNPs (Fig. 2a, Supplementary
Dataset 1). In step II, we further restricted the list of genes to
genes that were classified by the Gene Ontology (GO) term
’cytoskeleton organization’ since one of the most critical steps in
tumour progression and metastasis is the acquisition of migration

Figure 1 | Schematic diagram of a stepwise omic-data integration which informs the in vivo therapeutic approach. Local miRNA delivery to the primary
tumour is used to prevent breast cancer metastasis. To examine the effect of genomic alterations on breast cancer, we performed a stepwise omic-data
integration to generate a narrow list of potentially functional variants for cancer metastasis, in which we intersect two datasets: TargetScan and dbSNP.
Using this approach, we identified 20 SNPs, which are located at miRNA-binding sites in regulatory 30-UTR regions of genes that are related to breast
cancer (in particular those involved in cytoskeleton organization) (a). Our in vitro studies reveal miR-96 and miR-182 as key regulators of breast cancer cell
motility via regulation of Palladin, which encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is required for organizing the actin cytoskeleton (b). Clinical data analysis
supports clinical relevance in a human breast cancer cohort (c). Our data corroborate the role of miRNAs in metastasis regulation, and demonstrate that
in vivo local delivery of miR-96 and miR-182 to the primary tumour can serve as a potential treatment to prevent breast cancer metastasis (d).

 and invasion capabilities3,5 by reassembly of actin-cytoskeletal
structures in the cell14. Using this approach, we identified
20 SNPs that are located in 30-UTR miRNA-binding sites of 19
breast cancer genes known to be involved in cytoskeleton
organization. Importantly, six of these genes (430%) were
previously identified as contributors to tumour metastasis
(Supplementary Table 1).
Of the potentially functional SNPs found in ’cytoskeleton
organization’ genes, we focused on the SNP with the highest
(443%) minor allele frequency and thus largest population effect:
the rs1071738 SNP in the PALLD gene (Supplementary Table 1).
We speculate that this type of functional variant is not
under strong negative selection as its effect is exerted after the
reproduction period.
The ancestral C allele of rs1071738 is the minor allele in dbSNP
and in European populations, whereas the alternate G allele is
much more common. However, allelic frequencies of the two
alleles vary greatly between diverse populations (20–90%).

 The PALLD gene encodes multiple isoforms of the Palladin
actin-associated protein, resulting from multiple start sites and
alternative splicing of the gene. Currently, the Universal Protein
Database
lists
nine
distinct
Palladin
isoforms15;
however,
differential expression of palladin isoforms is largely cell-type
specific. The three isoforms most commonly studied are:
isoform 4, with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa, highly
expressed in vertebrates, and the most ubiquitous isoform in both
embryonic and adult mouse tissues; isoform 3, 140 kDa, widely
expressed and particularly abundant in the brain and in
epithelial-derived cell lines; isoform 1, 200 kDa with limited
expression in heart, skeletal muscle, testis and bone16–18.
Palladin isoform 4, and to some extent also Palladin isoform 3,
were recently shown to be involved in the invasive behaviour of
metastatic cells, specifically breast cancer cells, by increasing
migration and invasive motility through several mechanisms
such
as
linking
extracellular
matrix
degradation
to
cell
cytoskeleton11
and
regulating
podosome
and
invadopodia
protrusions formation12,13. Moreover, recent studies suggest
that Palladin also plays a role in gene expression regulation.
Specifically, genes involved in biosynthesis and assembly of
collagen as well as organization of the extracellular matrix
(in cancer-associated fibroblasts)15, in addition to differentiation
marker genes (in smooth muscle cells)19. Therefore, Palladin
expression regulation might influence multiple cellular pathways
involved in cell motility.
miR-96/-182 regulate Palladin in a genotype-dependent manner.
The PALLD rs1071738 SNP is located within a predicted binding
site for miR-96 and miR-182. The ‘seed’ regions of miR-96 and
miR-182 are fully complimentary to the PALLD gene when the
ancestral C allele is present at their binding sites, and harbor one
mismatch when the alternate G allele is present (Fig. 2b). To
validate the regulation of Palladin expression by miR-96 and
miR-182, we initially performed a luciferase reporter assay.
Significant
direct
downregulation
of
Palladin
by
miR-96
(B30% reduction) and miR-182 (B70% reduction) was observed
in the presence of the complementary C allele in both HeLa and
HEK-293 T cell lines (Fig. 2c). However, in the presence of the
alternate
G
allele,
Palladin
regulation
by
miR-96/182
was
abolished. Next, we examined Palladin and miRNA expression
in vitro in two human breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7, a non-
invasive breast cancer cell line, and Hs578, a highly invasive breast
cancer cell line. Both cell lines are heterozygous for rs1071738
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Palladin mRNA expression was assayed by
RT-PCR analysis using one set of primers which amplify Palladin
isoforms 1, 3 and 4 (Supplementary Table 3). Palladin protein was
detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Palladin antibody,
which reacts with all three of the aforementioned isoforms
(see methods). Interestingly, these cell-lines showed opposite
expression profiles of Palladin and the miRNAs; in the invasive
cell-line, Hs578, the expression of Palladin was relatively high and
miR-96 and miR-182 low, and in the non-invasive MCF-7 cell-line,
the opposite trend was observed (Supplementary Fig. 2), further
supporting
that
downregulation
of
Palladin
expression
is
controlled by miR-96/182.
In accordance with our notion, Palladin expression levels were
suppressed by overexpression of miR-96 or miR-182 in Hs578 cells
(mRNA and protein in Fig. 2d,e, respectively), and increased
following miR-96/182 downregulation in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2f) (for
miRNA over/underexpression see Supplementary Fig. 3A and B).
To further examine the mechanism of this effect in vitro, we
utilized the highly aggressive mouse breast cancer cell line, 4T1,
which is homozygous for the ancestral C allele of rs1071738
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The binding-site of miR-96 and miR-182
at the region complementary to the ‘seed’ is identical and
evolutionarily conserved between the human and mouse Palladin
orthologs. The murine miR-96 sequence is completely identical to
the human ortholog, and the miR-182 sequence differs in two
nucleotides at the 3’ end of the miRNA. In agreement with the
human results, inducing stable expression of mouse miR-96 or
miR-182 (Supplementary Fig. 3C) reduced Palladin isoform 4
levels dramatically in 4T1 cells (Fig. 2g). Palladin isoform 3 was
undetectable in these cells. The prominent reduction in Palladin
isoform 4 levels following overexpression of miR-96 or miR-182
may be explained by stronger binding to the C alleles at the
binding site, and/or by stable expression of the miRNAs.
We hypothesized that the genotype-dependent deregulation
can be ‘repaired’ by applying a complimentary engineered
miRNA. Using the T47D human breast cancer cell line, which
is homozygous for the alternate G allele, we observed that
overexpression of WT miR-96 or miR-182 did not influence
Palladin isoform 4 levels, whereas overexpression of engineered
miR-96 or miR-182, in which the G nucleotide on the opposed
position of the SNP was replaced by a C nucleotide thereby
allowing full complementation with the binding site (Fig. 2h),
repaired binding and reduced Palladin isoform 4 levels (Fig. 2i).
Palladin isoform 3 levels show the same trend, however the
results did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to low
quantification accuracy considering the very low expression
levels of this isoform in T47D cells. These results clearly
demonstrate a functional regulatory effect for the rs1071738
SNP, in which the ancestral C allele permits miRNA:mRNA
binding and the alternate G allele disrupts binding.
Palladin downregulation by miR-96/-182 reduces cell motility.
Growing evidence highlights the role of Palladin in cell motility,
however, studies investigating the role miR-96 and miR-182 take
in regulating cancer cells migration and invasion processes
(as well as proliferation or cell death) are in dispute. While some
studies indicate an anti-invasion/migration or anti-proliferation
role for miR-96 and/or miR-182 (refs 20–24), other studies,
including
studies
addressing
breast
cancer,
support
the
opposite25–33. Therefore, the effect of miR-96 and miR-182 on
the invasive behaviour of the cells was determined.
Overexpression of miR-182 inhibits wound closure (by 53%
after 20 h, Fig. 3a), and overexpression of both miR-96 and
miR-182 inhibit invasion in transwell invasion assays (by 14%
and 25%, respectively, Fig. 3b) of Hs578 human invasive breast
cancer cells. Similarly, stable overexpression of both miR-96 and
miR-182 in mouse 4T1 invasive breast cancer cells inhibit
migration in transwell migration assays (by 59% and 19.5%,
respectively, Fig. 3c) as well as invasion in transwell invasion
assays (by 70% and 41%, respectively, Fig. 3d). In contrast,
downregulation of both miR-96 and miR-182 in MCF-7 human
non-invasive breast cancer cells enhanced wound closure (by 21%
and 34%, respectively, Fig. 3e) and in 4T1 cells enhanced
migration (by 40% and 30%, respectively, Fig. 3f) and invasion
(by 39% and 65%, respectively Fig. 3g). As expected, short hairpin
RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of Palladin in 4T1 cells
(Fig. 4a,b) significantly reduced migration and invasion abilities
(by 27% and 22%, respectively) (Fig. 4c,d). Importantly, Palladin
suppression specifically blocked the inhibiting effects of miR-96
and miR-182 overexpression on migration and invasion abilities
of 4T1 cells (Fig. 4c,d), thereby functionally linking the miRNAs
expression, Palladin expression, and cell motility (for miRNA
over/underexpression see Supplementary Fig. 3). Taken together,
these data strongly suggest an anti-migration and anti-invasion
role for miR-96 and miR-182 in breast cancer, mediated by
Palladin downregulation.

 miR-96/-182 do not affect breast cancer cell proliferation. We
evaluated the effect of miR-96 and miR-182 on proliferation rates
in 4T1, MCF-7, and Hs578 breast cancer cell lines. No effect on
proliferation rate was observed in 4T1 and Hs578 cell lines
following
overexpression
of
both
miRNAs
(Supplementary
Fig.
4A
and
C)
and
in
MCF-7
cells
following
miR-96
downregulation (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Downregulation of
miR-182 in MCF-7 cells resulted in a slightly accelerated
proliferation rate (B6%; Supplementary Fig. 4B).
In vivo data support miR-Palladin regulation and metastasis.
Thus far, we have demonstrated the downregulation effect of miR-
96/182 on Palladin expression in in vitro experiments. To inquire
whether this effect occurs similarly in vivo, we examined Palladin
and miR-96/182 relation in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) cohort34. In agreement with the
in vitro findings, we found that there is a negative correlation
between Palladin and miR-96 or miR-182 normalized expression
levels (r ¼ � 0.3 and r ¼ � 0.2, respectively; Supplementary Figs. 5
and 6). Unfortunately, we were not able to assess the effect of
Palladin on metastatic state since only a few (n ¼ 21) samples had
detectable distant organ metastasis (pathologic M1). Yet, we did
observe association with lymph node metastases when adjusting
for tumour size (pathologic T). Both pathologic N staging (N0–
N3), and the number of lymph nodes positive by hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) were significantly increased with Palladin expression
levels (Pr0.005, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 7).
Importantly, it should be noted that these associations cannot be
explained by miR-96 or miR-182 expression levels as no significant
association was obtained between these miRNAs and lymph node
metastases (PZ0.1, Supplementary Table 2). Of note, the TCGA
BRCA study was insufficiently powered to detect small allelic
effects due to its large diversity and small sample size. Genotypes
and
gene
expression
levels
were
available
for
only
460
homogeneous samples (Caucasians), as the study-sample is
comprised
predominantly
of

(68%),
with
16%
African-American, 6% Asian and 10% others (Supplementary
Fig. 6), resulting in less than 30% power to detect a standardized
effect-size of 0.1 (typical for SNPs) and rs1071738 allele frequency
(40%). Hence, further investigation in larger breast cancer and
metastatic breast cancer studies is needed to clarify the regulatory
effects of the triad rs1071738, miR-96/182, and Palladin in breast
cancer patients.

Figure 3 | miR-96 and miR-182 reduce migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Migration and invasion abilities were evaluated using wound
healing, transwell migration, and Matrigel invasion assays. Hs578 cells were transfected by hsa-miR-96, hsa-miR-182 or pcDNA3 control plasmid (Ctrl).
Wound healing assay results (a) showed migration inhibition by hsa-miR-182. Pictures were taken at the indicated time points after scratch. The graph to
the right represents the width of remaining open wound calculated in relation to time 0 (n ¼ 3). (b) Overexpression of hsa-miR-96 and hsa-miR-182
reduced invasion as was demonstrated by Matrigel invasion assay. Photos of representative fields are on the left. Results were calculated as invasion rate in
relation to control cells. Transwell migration assay (c) and Matrigel invasion assay (d) of 4T1 cells stably expressing mmu-miR-96 or mmu-miR-182 showed
decreased migration and invasion abilities compared with 4T1 cells stably expressing scrambled sequence as control (Ctrl). Photos of representative fields

 cancer metastasis in vivo, we examined the prevalence of
metastases in an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model derived
from 4T1 cells that were engineered to overexpress miR-96 or
miR-182 (see Supplementary Fig. 8A for experiment flow).
4T1 cells were selected because tumour growth and metastatic
spread of these cells in BALB/c mice closely mimic stage IV
human breast cancer. Real-time PCR analysis validated increased
miR-96 and miR-182 levels (Supplementary Fig. 8F) and
decreased Palladin levels (Supplementary Fig. 8G–H) in removed

miRNA. A profound decrease in the appearance of lung
metastatic nodules was found in tumours stably expressing
miR-96 or miR-182 compared with tumours stably expressing the
scrambled control (Supplementary Fig. 8I–L), with no effect on
primary tumour characteristics (Supplementary Fig. 8B–E).
miR-96 and miR-182 delivery suppress metastasis in vivo. After
demonstrating the functional role of miR-96 or miR-182 in
metastasis prevention, in a first step towards translation, we
sought to test the therapeutic anti-metastatic potential of Palladin
modulation by administrating miR-96 or miR-182 externally,
carried on a suitable vehicle. It is well documented that Palladin

 isoform 4 is abundantly expressed in all types of smooth muscle
cells (vascular and visceral)18,19,35, hence it is reasonable to
assume that a systemic approach targeting Palladin will have
disastrous side effects and local administration is needed. We
hypothesized that local and efficacious delivery of miRNA mimics
can be achieved by coating 4T1 breast tumours with an adhesive
hydrogel
scaffold/patch
(made
of
oxidized
dextran
and
PAMAM G5 dendrimer) embedded with nanoparticles carrying
the miRNAs of interest (Fig. 5a). The cationic surface of the
dendritic system provides a facile platform for the incorporation
of
miRNA
nanoparticles
forming
electrostatic
interactions
between the positively charged terminal amines from PAMAM
dendrimers and the negatively charged nanoparticles. We have
previously shown the enhancement of nanoparticles stability
in vivo when embedded in a hydrogel for sustained gene and drug
delivery applications36–39.
In addition, to test the efficacy of miRNA treatment for
metastasis prevention as an add-on to conventional chemother-
apy, we further leveraged the local miRNA delivery scaffold that
coats
the
primary
tumour
to
simultaneously
deliver
a
chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, and compared the outcome
following administration of nanoparticles with only miRNAs to
that of nanoparticles with both miRNA and cisplatin. Cisplatin is
an alkylating agent classified as an anti-neoplastic drug that has
been extensively used in treatment of advanced breast cancer,
especially in metastatic breast cancer and, more recently, in
triple-negative
breast
cancer40–43.
Moreover,
its
chemical
structure
enables
its
intercalation
to
the
miRNAs
thus
providing sustained rather than bolus release over time.
The nanoparticles used in this study consist of a E40 nm gold
core that was decorated with thiolated miRNAs and a targeting

50 end of the miRNA oligos) and the gold core, forming a
quasi-covalent
interaction.
Thiolated-PEG-COOH
enables
conjugation to the 4T1-targeting peptide (CREKA), which was
labelled
with
fluorescein
isothiocyanate
(FITC;

(Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala)
is
a

pentapeptide
that
specifically
‘homes’
to
fibrin-fibronectin complexes abundantly expressed in tumour
microenvironments and specifically binds to 4T1 breast cancer
cells44. We thus expected that, with local delivery, the peptide
would improve cellular uptake.
Implantable dendrimer-dextran hydrogels were doped with the
drug/miRNA-gold nanoparticles to afford local drug/miRNA
delivery to shrink the primary tumour and prevent metastasis.
Quantification (Supplementary Fig. 9) and characterization assays
(Fig. 5b,c, Supplementary Figs 10 and 11) were conducted for
the
functionalized
nanoparticles.
Absorption
band
of
the
resulting nanoparticles appeared between B530 to B550 nm
due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the nanoparticles
(Supplementary Fig. 11A). The spatial arrangement of nanopar-
ticle can be inferred by measuring the shift of a characteristic
SPR band dependent on size, shape, aggregation state, and
medium polarity (Supplementary Fig. 11B). The SPR of the
nanoparticles shown exhibited a red shift from 528 to 546 nm: a
5 nm shift for poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) binding, a 5 nm shift
for CREKA peptide binding and an 8 nm shift for miRNA
binding indicating successful binding of the several groups.
Dynamic
light
scattering
measurements
with
diameter
distribution histograms (Supplementary Fig. 11C) and Zeta
Potential (Supplementary Fig. 11D) of the resulting nanoparticles
also confirm the successful functionalization of PEG, peptide and
miRNA. The quantification of all biomolecules (that is, PEG,
peptide and miRNAs) functionalized on the surface of gold
nanoparticles can be found in Supplementary Fig. 12. With a
remarkable
loading
capacity
(miRNA:nanoparticle
ratio
around 250:1) these nanoparticles may represent an efficient
therapeutic route for miRNA delivery.
Confocal microscopy (Fig. 5d) and flow cytometry (Fig. 5e,f)
were used to evaluate the cellular uptake of cells incubated
with miRNA nanoparticles functionalized with the CREKA
peptide in comparison with a jumbled peptide, showing that
the nanoparticles carrying the targeting peptide CREKA have two
orders of magnitude higher cellular uptake than the ones carrying
a jumbled peptide.
To confirm that the miRNAs maintain their function when
conjugated to the gold nanoparticles, we evaluated 4T1 cell motility
by performing a wound healing assay following treatment with
the miRNAs carried by the nanoparticles in vitro (Fig. 5g). The
results show that cells treated with nanoparticles carrying a control
miRNA were able to close the wound almost completely within
24 h. Treatment with gold nanoparticles carrying the miR-96/-182
dramatically inhibits wound closure in 4T1 compared with
treatment with Control-miR nanoparticles. Cells treated with
nanoparticles carrying either miR-96 or miR-182 were not able to
close the wound completely. These findings indicate that the
delivery of either miR-96 or miR-182 abolishes the motility of
4T1 cells. We confirmed the enhancement of miR-96 and miR-182
expression level following treatment with the gold nanoparticles
carrying the miR-96/-182 or control miR using quantitative PCR
(Supplementary Fig. 13). As expected, the Palladin levels were
downregulated after treatment with nanoparticles-miR-96 or
nanoparticles-miR-182. These results demonstrate that utilizing
gold nanoparticles, enables delivery of functional miRNAs, leading
to decreased cell motility in vitro.
We next assessed the in vivo pharmacokinetic and therapeutic
profile of the miRNA-nanoparticles doped hydrogel scaffold in an
orthotopic metastatic breast cancer mouse model. Tumours in the
mammary fat pad were induced in BALB/c female mice
(BALB/cAnNCrl) by injection of 4T1 cells stably expressing
mCherry. Hydrogel scaffolds loaded with the miRNA-nanopar-
ticles were implanted adjacent to the tumour in the mammary
fat pad when tumours reached the desired volume (B100 mm3,
about 5 days after tumour induction). Seven days after hydrogel
implantation
the
primary
tumours
were
removed
and
the presence of metastases in the lungs was evaluated by
micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) for 14 additional days.
Then, mice were sacrificed and organs collected and screened for
the presence of macro-metastases.
Primary tumour progression was measured by mCherry
expression
(emission
at
620 nm)
while
each
miRNA-
nanoparticles release was tracked fluorescently via live imaging
system 7 days post-hydrogel implantation. Live imaging of mice
and ex vivo fluorescent images of breast tumours revealed that
FITC-labelled nanoparticles were able to accumulate similarly in
tumours from all treated groups (Fig. 6a,b). This confirms the
capacity of this platform to provide an efficient in vivo miRNA
mimic delivery. No signs of inflammation at the surgical site, nor
changes in body weight, were observed before or after breast
tumour induction or hydrogel implantation (Supplementary
Fig.
14), suggesting
that hydrogels
and nanoparticles
are
biocompatible with no associated toxicity or side effects.
The hydrogel scaffolds doped with nanoparticles carrying both
miRNAs and the chemotherapeutic drug (cisplatin), compared
with only miRNAs, showed lower mCherry expression in
tumours, as was demonstrated by live mouse imaging (Fig. 6a)
and ex vivo fluorescent images of breast tumours (Fig. 6b). This
implicates efficient inhibition of the primary tumour progression
due to the effect of cisplatin release. More than 50% tumour size
reduction was observed for cisplatin-containing nanoparticles
7 days after hydrogel disk implantation (Fig. 6c), with a two-fold
reduction in tumour weight (Supplementary Fig. 15).
To evaluate the expression of miR-96 and miR-182 and their
effect on Palladin expression, gene expression analysis of resected
tumours was conducted. Indeed, real-time PCR results showed a
approximately fourfold increase in both miR-96 and miR-182
following treatment with hydrogels embedded with targeted
nanoparticles carrying miR-96 or miR-182 with and without
cisplatin,
compared
with
the
control
miRNA
(Fig.
6d,e).
Interestingly, tumours showed inverse expression levels of
Palladin and the miRNAs: Palladin mRNA expression was high
only in groups treated with hydrogels embedded with targeted
nanoparticles
carrying
control
miRNA
and
exhibited
a
approximately
fivefold
decrease
following
treatment
with
miR-96 or miR-182, which was not weakened by the intercalation
of cisplatin to the miRNA-nanoparticles (Fig. 6f). Hence, Palladin
mRNA expression levels were suppressed by delivery of miR-96
or miR-182.
Extensive reduction of vascularization in the cisplatin treated
groups was evidenced by H&E staining of breast tumour sections,
when
compared
with
miRNA
delivery
only
(Fig.
6g).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis corroborated that the
expression of Palladin and Vinculin (which also possesses a
conserved binding site for miR-96 and miR-182 on its 30-UTR,
according
to
TargetScan)
was
extensively
reduced
with
overexpression of miR-96 or miR-182, validating the quantitative
PCR results (Fig. 6d-f). In fact, both Palladin and Vinculin are
cytoskeletal proteins associated with cell–cell and cell–matrix
junctions,
required
for
organizing
the
actin
cytoskeleton.
Therefore, as the overexpression of miR-96 and miR-182
downregulates Palladin levels, a reduction in migration and
invasion abilities occurs, as demonstrated by the in vitro assays
depicted in Figs 2–4. Further, IHC analysis of Ki-67, a cellular

 marker associated with cell proliferation, revealed that a decrease
in this protein is mainly observed in groups treated with cisplatin,
independent from the specific miRNA treatment (Fig. 6g). This
reveals that the treatment of the primary tumour with a
chemotherapeutic drug reduces cancer cell proliferation, with a
concomitant reduction in tumour size.
Knowing the potential invasive and metastatic profile of 4T1
cells, especially to lungs but also liver and brain45, we next
evaluated the effect of enhancing miR-96 and miR-182 expression
through local miRNA-mimic delivery on the establishment of
in vivo metastasis. Metastases formation was evaluated 13 days
post-tumour resection using micro-CT of the lungs (Fig. 7a).
The quantification of metastatic lung nodules in treated mice for
days 13, 20 and 27 after primary tumour induction (which
corresponds to 0, 7 and 14 days post tumour resection) revealed
that the number of nodules increased with time only for groups
treated with nanoparticles carrying the control miRNA, and more
pronounced in the groups with no drug delivery (Fig. 7b). Ex vivo
fluorescent images of lungs (Fig. 7c), liver (Fig. 7d) and brain
(Fig. 7e) depicting mCherry emission in treated mice, revealed the
presence of 4T1 cells (migrated from the mammary primary
tumour) mainly in groups treated with nanoparticles carrying the
control miRNA. H&E stains of the resected tumours revealed
the presence of macro-metastasis in lungs only for mice treated
with hydrogels embedded with targeted nanoparticles carrying
scrambled (Control) miRNAs (Fig. 7f). In fact, the mCherry
emission at 620 nm is higher in lungs, but also present in liver and
brain mainly for mice treated with hydrogels embedded with
targeted nanoparticles carrying scrambled (Control) miRNAs
(Fig. 7g). No metastases were detected in any other major organs
(Supplementary Fig. 16).
Interestingly, only groups treated with nanoparticles carrying
the control miRNA, with or without the drug delivery, displayed
enlarged (approximately fourfold) spleens (that is, splenomegaly;
Fig. 7h). Actually, the mammary tumour induced with 4T1 cells is
known for presenting splenomegaly46,47, which is associated with
a severe state of diseases, especially liver infections and some
cancer types. In our studies, we demonstrated that the 4T1
tumour
induces
a
leukemoid
reaction
with
splenomegaly
following orthotopic transplant into the mammary fat pads of
female BALB/c mice.
Discussion
In this study we initially identified a common functional variant,
rs1071738, at the miR-96 and miR-182 target site on the PALLD
30-UTR, that we thought may potentially influence breast cancer
metastasis. Subsequently, we showed for the first time that
Palladin expression is specifically regulated by miR-96 and
miR-182, and demonstrated that the PALLD SNP is indeed a
functional variant, in which the alternate allele abolishes
miRNA:mRNA binding leading to uncontrolled regulation of
Palladin expression. Importantly, we were able to restore this
abnormal regulation by the administration of engineered, fully

 complimentary, miRNAs. In vivo delivery of miR-96 or miR-182
carried on nanoparticles which are embedded in a hydrogel
scaffold patch and implanted adjacent to the tumour, allowed
local and sustained release of the miRNAs and efficiently blocked
breast cancer from spreading to lungs, liver and brain in an
orthotopic mouse model, with no systemic side effects. Moreover,
by intercalating cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug, within the miR-
conjugated nanoparticles, we were able to achieve a local and
specific delivery of the chemotherapy drug to the tumour, with a
sustained release over time (as opposed to the intravenous
standard of care). This delivery of the combined therapy
(cisplatin and each of the miRNAs) further improved preclinical
outcomes, leading to substantial reduction in both primary
tumour growth and metastasis, thereby plausibly introducing our
miRNA therapy as an add-on to conventional chemotherapy.
The

significant
inverse
relationship
between
Palladin and miR-96/182 expression, as well as the positive
relationship between Palladin expression and lymph node
metastases in invasive breast carcinoma cells of the TCGA study
samples, further support our in vitro and in vivo findings, and
highlight their relevancy. The TCGA BRCA study size was
insufficiently powered to detect small allelic effects (o30%
for rs1071738 minor allele frequency). Furthermore, genetic
association
in
tumours
pose
additional
challenges
and
confounding effects, such as copy number variation and within
and between heterogeneity. Hence, determining the effect of
rs1071738 SNP on miR-96/182 regulation of Palladin expression
and breast cancer metastasis, warrants investigation of large
primary and metastatic breast cancer cohorts, to promote the
development of a more effective, individualized, anti-metastatic
therapy.
The therapeutic anti-metastatic potential of Palladin modula-
tion by administrating miR-96 or miR-182 may extend to other
types of cancer47,48. In renal cell carcinoma, for example, elevated
Palladin levels in the stroma were correlated with poor clinical
outcome49. Another study15 showed that Palladin is highly
expressed in the stroma of multiple tumour types including lung,
stomach, colon and pancreas cancer. Additional studies have
indicated a role for Palladin in pancreatic cancer48,50; abnormal
and overexpression of Palladin was found in familial and sporadic
pancreatic cancer tissues, leading to actin-cytoskeletal changes
and increased invasive and migratory abilities50.
As master regulators of gene expression, each miRNA
potentially regulates multiple target genes. In many cellular
pathways, the effect of a single miRNA-mRNA interaction might
be minor. However, the combined effect of the miRNA on several
target genes which share the same biological pathway might be
significant
and
therefore
result
in
measurable
phenotypic
consequences28. Previous findings suggested several target genes
for miR-96 or miR-182, which influence cancer cell motility: miR-

 96 was reported to directly regulate KRAS20, Ezrin21, NUAK1
(ref. 22), RECK25,27, FOXO3a30, MTSS1 (ref. 31), ephrinA5
(ref. 29), Foxf2 (ref. 23) and FOXO1 (ref. 32); miR-182 was also
shown to target MTSS1 (refs 28,31), ephrinA5 (ref. 29), Foxf2
(ref. 23), FOXO3 (ref. 33) and FOXO1 (ref. 32) as well as MITF33,
PAI1, TIMP1 and RSU1 (ref. 28). Like Palladin, three of these
proteins (Ezrin, ephrinA5 and MTSS1) were also annotated by
Gene
Ontology as ‘actin
cytoskeleton
organization’ genes.
However, the effect of miR-96 and miR-182 on cell motility
and metastasis via regulating validated targets appears to differ
between cancer types and even between cancer cell lines. Our
current study delineates the network of genes regulated by
miR-96/182 in breast cancer by pinpointing Palladin as an
important target of miR-96 and miR-182, influencing cell motility
and metastasis in breast cancer cells.
Currently, screening programs are the standard of care
resulting in high incidence of invasive breast cancer diagnosis
at an early stage. Our proposed treatment could potentially be
administered to breast cancer patients shortly after malignant
disease is confirmed, before surgical intervention, and could assist
in reducing distal metastasis. In addition, the treatment can be
applied locally as a washout procedure following resection to
eliminate remaining malignant cells that may cause tumour
recurrence and metastasis.
Taken together, this study introduces the therapeutic potential
of miRNAs in breast cancer metastasis prevention. A smart
delivery vehicle was developed to enable efficient, local and
sustained release of miRNAs, as well as combined therapy of
miRNAs with a chemotherapy drug. This novel combined
therapy could further improve clinical outcome by significantly
reducing primary tumour mass, as well as reducing—or even
preventing—metastasis.
Methods
Bioinformatics. To identify potential functional variants for breast cancer
progression we utilized a stepwise omic-data integration approach. In step 1, we
searched PubMed with the term ‘breast cancer’ and gene name and gene symbol of
all HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)51 approved genes. Out of the
19,064 HGNC genes a total of 7,608 had at least one publication with ‘breast
cancer’ between years 2000 and 2013 (current year at the time). We considered
genes with Z4 publications (Q50 ¼ 4) as breast cancer genes (n ¼ 4,057). Setting
the cutoff to the median minimizes weak associations with breast cancer (false
positives), yet is sufficiently inclusive (4,057 of 19,064 HGNC genes, B20%).
In step 2, we restricted the breast cancer genes to genes with conserved miRNA
target sites in their 30-UTR based on TargetScan (11,161 genes with conserved
miRNA target in db)52, resulting in 2,602 genes, and in step 3, we restricted the
genes to those with a common (Z1%) SNP located in the miRNA target sites based
on the dbSNP138common database (12,896, 132 SNPs in db), resulting in a total of
190 genes and 212 variants. The R package ’RISmed’ was used to retrieve
information from PubMed53. The RefSeq, and dbSNP138common databases were
downloaded from the UCSC genome annotation database for the Feb. 2009
assembly of the human genome (hg19), and overlaps between genomic intervals
were calculated by the R package ‘GenomicFeatures’54. The final gene list was
annotated by Gene Ontology biological process classifications using the R packages
‘clusterProfiler’55. Variants from genes classified by the term ‘cytoskeleton
organization’ (n ¼ 19) were considered as potential functional variants for breast
cancer progression to metastasis.
Cell culture. HEK-293 T, HeLa, Hs578, MCF-7 and T47D cell lines were cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO) and 1% L-glutamine, 100 units
per ml penicillin, and 100 units ml � 1 streptomycin (Biological Industries, Kibbutz
Beit Haemek, Israel). The 4T1 cell line was cultured in RPMI (GIBCO)
supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 1% L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
100 units per ml penicillin, 100 units per ml streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES buffer
(Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) and 2.5 g l � 1 D-Glucose
(Sigma). Cells were incubated at 37 �C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Hs578, MCF-7
and T47D cell lines were received from Prof. Ilan Tsarfaty (Tel-Aviv University).
The 4T1 cell-line was received from Prof. Ronit Satchi-Fainaro (Tel-Aviv
University). HeLa and HEK-293 T cell-lines were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). STR profiling (DNA Diagnostics Centre, UK)
and mycoplasma testing (Biological Industries) were conducted for each cell
line before use.
Constructs. For luciferase reporter assays, fragments of the PALLD 30-UTR
spanning the miRNA-96/182 binding sites were amplified from human genomic
DNA and cloned downstream to the Renilla Luciferase Reporter of the
psiCHECK-2 plasmid (Promega) that contain a Firefly Luciferase Reporter (used as
control) under a different promoter. Three Luciferase constructs under regulation
of the PALLD 30-UTR were prepared (Fig. 2b): 30-UTR fragment possessing a
G allele in the rs1071738 PALLD SNP position; 30-UTR fragment possessing a
C allele in the rs1071738 PALLD SNP position; negative control 30-UTR in which
the miRNA-96/182-binding site was deleted by restriction enzymes.
For miRNA overexpression, Pre-miRNAs (hsa-miR-96, hsa-miR-182) were
cloned into the miRNA expression vector miRVec that was provided by
Prof. R. Agami56. Vectors expressing mutant hsa-miR-96/182 were generated by
mutating the miRVec plasmids expressing WT hsa-miR-96/182 using QuikChange
Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies).
For transient and stable overexpression of mouse miRNA-96/182, Pre-miRNAs
(mmu-miR-96/182) were amplified from DNA of 4T1 cells and cloned downstream
of the CMV promoter of the CD515B-1_pCDHCMV-MCS-EF1- Hygro Lentivirus
Expression Vector (Tarom).
Transfection. HeLa, HEK-293 T, MCF-7, Hs578, T47D and 4T1 cells were
transfected when cells were 50–75% confluent. RNA sequences or DNA plasmids
were transfected together with transfection reagent in Opti-MEM serum
(Biological Industries). HEK-293 T cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1
Transfection Reagent (Mirus) and all other cells were transfected with
Lipofectamin 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). For miRNA overexpression
studies, 0.5 mg of miRVec plasmid (for human cell lines) or CD515-B plasmid
(for murine 4T1 cell line) were transfected. For miRNA inhibition studies,
30 pmole antagomiRs (Ambion) or scrambled control RNA sequence were
transfected. GFP was transfected as a control and its detection was confirmed 24 h
following transfection. Cells were harvested for RNA extraction, protein extraction,
or lysate preparation 24–48 h following transfection.
Dual luciferase reporter assay. HEK-293 T or HeLa cells were seeded in 24 wells
plate. At B60% confluence, cells were co-transfected with the 5 ng psiCHECK-2
containing the desired 30-UTR and 485 ng miRVec containing the desired
pre-miRNA. Forty-eight hours following transfection, lysates were extracted and
Firefly and Renilla Luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System kit (Promega) and a Veritas microplate luminometer.
miRNA/mRNA expression levels determination. Total RNA from cell lines was
extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). RNA from primary
tumour samples was extracted from frozen tissues by homogenization by Tissue-
Lyser LT (Qiagen) in TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies). RNA quality was measured using NanoDrop
(Thermo Scientific). cDNA for miRNA and mRNA was synthesized from total
RNA. Reverse transcription reaction for mRNA was conducted with random
primer and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription
for specific miRNAs was performed with TaqMan miRNA Assays (Applied
Biosystems; ABI). Single miRNA/mRNA expression was tested similarly using
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (No AmpErase UNG; Applied Biosystems) or
SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), respectively, using
StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Specific primer pairs for
mRNA expression detection were ordered from Sigma (Supplementary Table 3).
Palladin mRNA quantification was performed by primers that amplify isoforms
1, 3 and 4 (Supplementary Table 3). Expression values were calculated based on the
comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method. miRNA levels were normalized to U6
snRNA and mRNA expression levels were normalized to human GAPDH or
mouse Actin.
Western blot analysis. Cells were homogenized with lysis buffer and debris was
removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the
Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Lysates were resolved by
SDS–PAGE through 4–12% gels (GeBaGel) and transferred by electroporation to
nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in TBST buffer
containing 5% milk, blotted with anti-Palladin (ProteinTech, cat# 10853-1-AP) or
anti-Actin (Millipore, clone C4, cat# MAB1501) primary antibodies for 18 h,
followed by secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. The anti-Palladin
antibody was generated against the C-terminal 385 amino acids of palladin,
recognizes most Palladin isoforms except isoform 6. Immunoreactive bands were
detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Scientific). Band
quantification was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health)
and protein levels were normalized to Actin levels.
Generation of miR-182/96 stably expressing cells. CD515B-1 Lentivectors
expressing mmu-miR-96, mmu-miR-182 or a scrambled sequence were prepared
as described. Packaging was done in HEK-293 T cells with pPACKH1 Lentiviral
vector packaging (SBI). Forty-eight hours following HEK-293 transfection, virions
containing supernatants were collected. 1 M Hepes (Biological industries) was

 added at a 1:20 ratio, supernatants were filtered, supplemented with 5 ml ml � 1
polybrene (Sigma) and stored at � 80 �C for further use. 4T1-mCherry cells at 50%
confluence were infected with the lentiviruses in a six-well plate. Selection was done
under the pressure of 200 mg ml � 1 Hygromycin (Megapharm).
Generation of palladin knock-down cells. Palladin knock-down was performed
using shRNA sequences (Dharmacon) based on the RNAi Consortium (TRC) by
the Broad institute. The target sequence on Palladin coding region was: 50-
GCTAACCTATGAGGAAAGAAT-30. Scrambled shRNA sequence was used as
control. The lentiviral vector pLKO.1 was used for shRNA expression. Packaging
was done in HEK-293 T cells with ViraPower Lentiviral packaging mix
(Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours following HEK-293 transfection, virions containing
supernatants were collected and stored at � 80 �C. Before use, supernatants were
filtered and supplemented with 5 ml ml � 1 polybrene (Sigma). 4T1 cells at 40%
confluence were infected with the lentiviruses in a six-well plate and selection was
done under the pressure of 2 mg/ml Puromycin (A.G. Scientific).
Wound healing assay. Hs578, MCF-7 or 4T1 (stably expressing mCherry) cells
were cultured in complete growth media until B90% confluence. Cells were
conditioned for 5–8 h in DMEM media (Hs578 and MCF-7) or RPMI media (4T1)
supplemented with 0.1% FBS, and then adherent cell monolayers were scratched
with a 10 ml pipette tip and cultured in complete medium. Cells were allowed to
close the wound for 20 h (Hs578), 24 h (4T1) and 36 h (MCF-7), and were observed
under phase-contrast microscopy. 4T1 cells were also observed under fluorescent
microscopy (using Nikon Eclipse Ti Epi-fluorescence microscope). The percentage
of wound closure was assessed in relation to time 0 by ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health).
Transwell migration and invasion assays. Migration and invasion abilities of
breast cancer cells were assessed based on the area covered with cells invading
through either transwell inserts (Costar) for migration assays or Matrigel-coated
invasion chambers (BD Biosciences), both possessing 8 mm pores. Forty-eight
hours following transfection, and 16 h following starvation in cell culture media
supplemented with only 0.1% FBS, Hs578 and 4T1 cells were trypsinized and
seeded at 0.5 � 105 and 1 � 105 cells per well, respectively, into Transwell chambers
(for migration or invasion assays). 4T1 cells stably expressing miRNAs were
conditioned overnight in their growth media, supplemented with only 0.1% FBS,
and then trypsinized and seeded at 1 � 105 cells per well into transwell chambers.
The lower chamber contained complete media as chemoattractant. Cells were
allowed to migrate/invade for 20–24 h, and then wells were fixed with cold
Methanol, washed with PBS and stained by Hemacolor for microscopy (Merck).
The non-migrating/invading cells on the upper surface of the insert were removed.
The cells that had migrated to the basal side of the membrane were visualized with
a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope at 200 � magnification. Pictures of 5–10 random
fields from three replicate wells were obtained and the percentage of coveredarea
was assessed using ImageJ software.
Cell proliferation assay. Proliferation rates for 4T1 and MCF-7 cells were
measured using the FITC BrdU Flow Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours following
transfection, cells were incubated with Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 30 min.
BrdU and DAPI expressions were detected by the Gallios FACS instrument and
determined by Flowing software 2. Proliferation rate for Hs578 cells was measured
48 h following transfection using ViaLight Plus Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity
assay (Lonza), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis of TCGA BRCA data. The RNA and miRNA-sequencing and
clinical data of BRCA study samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) Data portal (Level 3, open access)34, and available for 1,203 (mRNA) and
1,176 (miRNA) women, after excluding 12 males. Gene-level transcription
estimates in RSEM normalized count were retrieved, and utilized in the statistical
analyses. Correlations between normalized transcript counts were measured using
the Pearson’s method. We used ANOVA to test the association between Palladin
expression and lymph node metastasis while controlling for other staging factors.
The reduced model included Palladin expression versus only the pathologic T
(T1–4, ordinal), and the full model included pathologic T and pathologic N
(N0-3, ordinal), or the number of lymph nodes positive by H&E (discrete). We did
not include the pathologic M factor in the models as only 21 subjects had
detectable distant organ metastasis (M1), this exclusion resulted in the use of 999
M0 samples for this analysis. Standard residuals of the reduced model were
calculated to display the association results (Supplementary Fig. 7). All of the
statistical analyses and plots were performed using R programming language.
We gained access to the TCGA controlled data via ’The database of Genotypes
and Phenotypes’ (dbGaP) to retrieve rs1071738 genotypes (that is, germline).
Genotype calls were available for 1,015 subjects (1,011 with normal/tumour pair)
from the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (SNP_A-2089440) level
2 data. However, only 460 samples remained after excluding non-Caucasians
(B20%) and samples with missing mRNA and/or miRNA expression levels
(B200 subjects). We estimated the power of this sample size to be insufficient
(o30%) by using the QUANTO software package57 (frequency set as 40%,
and standardized effect-size as 0.1, typical for SNPs based on genome-wide
association studies).
Synthesis of miRNA-Gold nanoparticles. Bare AuNPs, with an average diameter
of E40nm (E7.15E þ 10 nanoparticles per ml) and an SPR peak at 530nm
(extinction coefficient 8.42E þ 09M � 1 cm� 1, MW 3.91E þ 08g mol � 1, surface
area 5.03 þ 03 nm2) were purchased from Cytodiagnostics. Functionalization of
PEGylated gold nanoparticles was carried out using commercial hetero-functional
PEG functionalized with a 30% saturated surface of a-Mercapto-o-carboxy PEG
solution (HS-C2H4-CONH-PEG-O-C3H6-COOH, MW. 3500Da, Sigma) as
described elsewhere58,59. The 30% of saturated PEG layer allows the incorporation of
additional thiolated components, such as the thiolated DNA-hairpin-Quasar 705 nm
and the tiolated-oligo-BHQ2 quencher. Briefly, 10nM of the bare-gold
nanoparticles were mixed with 0.006 mg ml� 1 of PEG solution in an
aqueous solution of SDS (0.028%). After this, the mixture was incubated for 16h at
room temperature. Excess PEG was removed by centrifugation (15,000 � r.p.m.,
30min, 4 �C).
The pentapeptide CREKA (Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala), with no modifications at
C- and N-terminals, was coupled to the PEG-AuNPs by a carbodiimide chemistry
assisted by N-hydroxisuccinimide (EDC/NHS coupling reaction) between the
carboxylated PEG terminal and the primary amine groups of the peptide. CREKA
is a tumour-homing pentapeptide that specifically homes to fibrin-fibronectin
complexes abundantly expressed in tumour microenvironments and specifically
binds to 4T1 breast cancer cells. Briefly, 10 nM of nanoparticles-PEG,
1.98 mg ml � 1 N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS, Sigma) and 500 mg ml � 1
EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, Sigma) were incubated in
10 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, Sigma) at pH 6.2 and allowed
to react for 30 min to activate the carboxylic groups. After this, activated
nanoparticles were washed once with 10 mM MES, pH 6.2 and used immediately.
CREKA peptide was added to the mixture at a final concentration of 3 mg ml � 1
and allowed to react for 16 h at 25 �C. After this period, the nanoparticles were
centrifuged at 20.000 � g for 30 min at 4 �C and washed three times with Mili-Q
water. The CREKA quantification was achieved using the Pierce BCA Protein
Assay kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufactures’ instructions. Briefly,
0.025 ml of each standard and unknown sample (the supernatants) was mixed with
0.2 ml of the BCA Working Reagent (50:1, BCA reagent A:BCA reagent B) to each
tube. The reaction mixture was incubated at 60 �C for 30 min. After this period the
tubes were cooled down to room temperature and the absorbance measured at
562 nm. The standard curve was used to determine the CREKA concentration of
each unknown sample (supernatant).
After the peptide conjugation, thiolated miRNAs (miR-96, miR-182 and a
scrambled miR from Dharmacon) were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 M DTT, extracted
three times with ethyl acetate, and further purified through a desalting Illustra
NAP-5 column Sephadex G-25 DNA grade (GE Healthcare) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The purified thiolated miRNAs were incubated at a
concentration of 10 mM, with an RNase-free solution of the peptide-PEG-AuNPs
(10 nM) containing 0.08% SDS. Subsequently, the salt concentration was increased
from 0.05 to 0.3 M NaCl with brief ultrasonication following each addition to
increase the coverage of oligonucleotides on the nanoparticle surface. After
functionalization during 16 h at 4 �C, the particles were purified by centrifugation
(20,000g, 20 min, 4 �C), and re-suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-water.
This procedure was repeated 3 times. The number of miRNA strands per
nanoparticle was quantified using a Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit, which is
one of the most sensitive detection dyes for the quantitation of RNA in solution,
with linear fluorescence detection in the range of 1–200 ng of RNA. The standard
curve was used to determine the miRNA concentration of each unknown sample
(supernatant). A table summarizing the quantification of all these biomolecules can
be found in Supplementary Fig. 12E.
In vitro miR-nanoparticles delivery. 4T1 cells stably expressing mCherry were
seeded at a density of 1 � 105 cells per well in 24-well plates and grown for 24h
before incubation of nanoparticles (5nM). On the day of incubation, the cells were
B50% confluent. For confocal microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% paraformalde-
hyde in PBS for 15 min at 37 �C and stained with DAPI to allow nuclear staining and
finally mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen). Images of cells were
taken with a Nikon A1R Ultra-Fast Spectral Scanning Confocal Microscope.
Development of orthotopic breast cancer mice model. Tumours in the
mammary fat pad were induced in BALB/c (AnNCrl, 6 weeks, Charles River)
female mice by injection of 1 � 106 4T1 cells stably expressing mCherry, suspended
in 50 ml of HBBS (Lonza) solution. For determination of tumour growth, individual
tumours were measured using caliper and tumour volume was calculated by:
tumour volume (mm3) ¼ width � (length2)/2. Treatments began when tumour
volume reached about 100 mm3. All experimental protocols were approved by the
MIT Animal Care and Use Committee and were in compliance with NIH
guidelines for animal use.

 Nanoparticles-hydrogel scaffold synthesis and implantation. Tagged hydrogel
scaffolds were developed by mixing equal parts of dendrimer amine of 12.5% solid
content (Dendritech Inc.) and dextran aldehyde 5% solid content (Sigma-Aldrich)
with 0.25% dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) to form 6 mm pre-cured disks. For doped
scaffolds, miRNA-nanoparticles (10 nM) and cisplatin (30 mM, Sigma-Aldrich)
were added to the dendrimer solution before hydrogel formation. All solutions
were filtered through a 0.22 mm filter before hydrogel formation for in vivo
implantation. Pre-cured disks of scaffold with nanoparticles were formed and
implanted subcutaneously on top of the fat mammary tumour in BALB/c mice.
Primary tumour growth and metastasis monitoring. Non-invasive longitudinal
monitoring of tumour progression was followed by scanning mice with the IVIS
Spectrum-bioluminescent and fluorescent imaging system (Xenogen XPM-2
Corporation) from mice bearing mammary tumours from 4T1 cells (n ¼ 5 animals
per treated group). Fifteen minutes before imaging, mice were intraperitoneally
injected with 150 ml of D-luciferin (30 mg ml � 1, Perkin Elmer) in DPBS (Lonza).
Whole-animal imaging was performed at the indicated time points. Assessment of
in vivo toxicity via mouse body weight evaluation was performed on all the animal
groups during 27 days after tumour induction and 20 days after hydrogel
implantation. Micro-CT images of the lungs were performed in an eXplore
CT120-whole mouse MicroCT (GE Healthcare) at days 13, 20 and 27 after tumour
induction. Histological sections of the tumours (n ¼ 5) were stained with
haematoxylin and eosin, and for IHC analysis the tumours (n ¼ 5) were stained
with anti-Ki67 antibody (Abcam ab15580, dilution 1:200), anti-Vinculin
(Sigma cat#v4139, dilution 1:50) or anti-Palladin (Proteintech, cat#10853-1-AP,
dilution 1:50) primary antibodies.
