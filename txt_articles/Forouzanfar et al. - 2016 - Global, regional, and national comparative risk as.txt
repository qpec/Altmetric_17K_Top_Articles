Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 
79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic 
risks or clusters of risks, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Risk Factors Collaborators*
Summary
Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of 
the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational 
assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. 
Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of 
Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in exposure by age group, 
sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks 
from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defi
 ned criteria for 
convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, 
cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to 
pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across 
risk factors—the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we 
estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable 
burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-
specifi
 c DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index (SDI). 
Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, 
childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, 
high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated 
in 2015 accounted for 57·8% (95% CI 56·6–58·8) of global deaths and 41·2% (39·8–42·8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten 
largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211·8 million [192·7 million 
to 231·1 million] global DALYs), smoking (148·6 million [134·2 million to 163·1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose 
(143·1 million [125·1 million to 163·5 million]), high BMI (120·1 million [83·8 million to 158·4 million]), childhood 
undernutrition (113·3 million [103·9 million to 123·4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103·1 million [90·8 million 
to 115·1 million]), high total cholesterol (88·7 million [74·6 million to 105·7 million]), household air pollution 
(85·6 million [66·7 million to 106·1 million]), alcohol use (85·0 million [77·2 million to 93·0 million]), and diets high 
in sodium (83·0 million [49·3 million to 127·5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for 
micronutrient defi
 ciencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; 
reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure 
contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational 
carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical 
activity, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high 
BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked 
among the leading fi
 ve risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex 
remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. 
Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, 
and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities 
for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, even as 
exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors 
to global burden.

Introduction
Analysis of the causes of poor health—specifi
 cally, the 
connections between risk factors and development of 
poor health—can provide insights into opportunities 
and priorities for prevention, research, policy, and 
development. One of the mainstays of modern epidem-
iology is quantifi
 cation of elevated risks for particular 
diseases or injuries from exposure to a given risk factor 
for groups of individuals. Quantifi
 cation of elevated risk 
for exposed groups of individuals from an array of risk-
outcome pairs is important to inform decision making on 
individual health; however, public policy debates require 
the comprehensive metric of population-level risk, which 
is a function of elevated risk in the exposed population 
and the fraction of the population exposed to a given risk. 
Eff
 orts to measure population risk have combined data for 
excess risk with the number of individuals exposed to 
provide comparative quantifi
 cation of diff
 erent health 
risks for populations that have been infl
 uential in 
establishment of policy priorities.1,2
The comparative risk assessment (CRA) approach 
developed for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors (GBD) Study3,4 provides an overarching 
conceptual framework for population risk assessment 
across risks and over time. The scale of the GBD Study 
required extensive work to develop exposure metrics, 
assess relationships, and compile health data from 
diff
 erent parts of the world with diff
 ering levels of metadata 
and uncertainty, and the unique contribution of this work 
has been broadly recognised.5–7 A robust debate on specifi
 c 
risks and results emerged after publication of the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2013 
(GBD 2013).8 Inclusion and exclusion of particular risks 
and outcomes;3,4,9 the optimum targets for indicators such 
as high systolic blood pressure,10,11 cholesterol,11,12 diets high 
in sodium,13 and air pollution;4,14 and the certainty of some 
dietary components of risk8,15 were challenged, in addition 
to some details of methods. Underlying many of these 
discussions were heterogeneities in the strength of causal 
evidence for diff
 erent risk-outcome pairs.8
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) CRA, in addition to 
updating data and methods, adds new transparency about 
the evidence supporting causal connections for each of the 
388 risk-outcome pairs included in the analysis, allows the 
quantifi
 cation and reporting of levels and trends in 
exposure, decomposes changes in attributable burden into 
population growth, ageing, risk exposure, and risk-deleted 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates, and examines 
how risks change with development. As with all iterations 
of the GBD Study, GBD 2015 results presented here 
supersede all previously published GBD CRA estimates.
Methods
Overview
The CRA conceptual framework was developed by 
Murray and Lopez,16 who established a causal web of 
hierarchically organised risks or causes that contribute to 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The most recent assessment of attributable deaths and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) at the global, regional, and 
national level was the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study 2013, which covered 79 risk factors or 
combinations of risks from 1990 to 2013 in 188 countries. 
Added value of this study
This study (the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2015) incorporates recently published studies, 
newly acquired data for exposure to relative risks, and new 
risk-outcome pairs meeting study inclusion criteria. To enhance 
transparency of the supporting evidence, we provided an 
assessment of the strength of evidence supporting causality for 
all 388 risk-outcome pairs. For the fi
 rst time, we separately 
assessed trends in risk exposure by computing a summary 
exposure value, which allows comparisons over time and across 
place for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risks. 
Quantifi
 cation of exposure trends allowed decomposition of 
trends in attributable DALYs into the portion contributed by 
changes in population growth, population structure, exposure, 
and risk-deleted DALY rates. We found that reductions in 
exposure have been key drivers of change for only a small set of 
environmental risks, including sanitation, household air 
pollution, and behavioural risks (eg, undernutrition and 
smoking). For many risks, trends in attributable DALYs have 
been driven by the interplay between population growth, 
ageing, and declines in risk-deleted DALY rates. For some 
risks, including body-mass index, fasting plasma glucose, 
occupational exposure to carcinogens, and drug use, exposure is 
increasing and driving up attributable burden. Although an 
average risk transition has occurred as countries move through 
the development continuum, many risks initially increase and 
then decline at the highest development levels. We document 
leading risks for each country and territory included in the study. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Risk assessments allow identifi
 cation of several groups of risk 
factors that deserve policy attention. Risks such as smoking, 
unsafe sanitation, and childhood undernutrition still cause 
many attributable DALYs, but recent trends show that exposure 
can be reduced. This assessment of risk also shows many large 
global risks for which changes in exposure are slow, such as 
high systolic blood pressure, ambient air pollution, diets high in 
sodium, high cholesterol, and alcohol intake, highlighting huge 
opportunities for intervention. Two large risks—high BMI and 
high fasting plasma glucose—have particularly large and 
concerning increases in exposure.

health outcomes (methods appendix p 161), which allows 
quantifi
 cation of risks or causes at any level in the 
framework. In GBD 2015, as in previous iterations of 
the GBD Study, we evaluated a set of behavioural, 
environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks, 
where risk-outcome pairs were included based on 
evidence rules (methods appendix p 161). These risks 
were organised into four hierarchical levels, described in 
table 1. To date, we have not quantifi
 ed the contribution 
of other classes of risk factors (methods appendix p 161); 
however, using an analysis of the relationship between 
risk exposures and development, measured with use of 
the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), we provide some 
insights into the potential magnitude of distal social, 
cultural, and economic factors.
Two types of risk assessments are possible within the 
CRA framework: attributable burden and avoidable 
burden. Attributable burden is the reduction in current 
disease burden that would have been possible if past 
population exposure had shifted to an alternative or 
counterfactual distribution of risk exposure. Avoidable 
burden is the potential reduction in future disease 
burden that could be achieved by changing the current 
distribution of exposure to a counterfactual distribution 
of exposure. Murray and Lopez16 identifi
 ed four types 
of counterfactual exposure distributions: theoretical, 
plausible, feasible, and cost-eff
 ective minimum risk. In 
GBD studies to date and in this study, we focus on 
attributable burden using the theoretical minimum risk 
level (TMREL), which is the level of risk exposure that 
minimises risk at the population level, or the level of risk 
that captures the maximum attributable burden.
Overall, this analysis follows the CRA methods used in 
GBD 2013.4 The methods described in this study provide 
a high-level overview of the analytical logic, with a focus 
on areas of notable change from the methods used in 
GBD 2013, with details provided in the methods 
appendix. This study complies with the Guidelines for 
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
statement (methods appendix pp 177–79).17
Geographic units of analysis and years for estimation
In the GBD framework, geographies have been arranged 
as a set of hierarchical categories: seven super-regions, 
21 regions nested within the seven super-regions, and 
195 countries and territories nested in the 21 regions. 
Additionally, GBD collaborator interest and availability of 
data resulted in an expansion of countries for which we 
disaggregate our estimates at the subnational level. At the 
fi
 rst level of subnational division, 256 geographic units 
are included in GBD 2015. For this study, we present 
results for the 195 national and territory-level geographies. 
We produced a complete set of age-specifi
 c, sex-specifi
 c, 
cause-specifi
 c, and location-specifi
 c estimates of risk 
factor exposure and attributable burden for 1990, 1995, 
2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 for included risk factors. 
Results presented in this study emphasise results for 
1990, 2005, and 2015; online data visualisations provide 
access to results for all GBD metrics from 1990 to 2015.
Attributable burden formula
Four key components are included in estimation of the 
burden attributable to a given risk factor: the metric of 
burden being assessed (number of deaths, years of life lost 
[YLLs], years lived with disability [YLDs], or DALYs [the sum 
of YLLs and YLDs]), the exposure levels for a risk factor, the 
relative risk of a given outcome due to exposure, and the 
counterfactual level of risk factor exposure. Estimates of 
attributable DALYs for a risk-outcome pair are equal to 
DALYs for the outcome multiplied by the population 
attributable fraction (PAF) for the risk-outcome pair for a 
given age, sex, location, and year. A similar logic applies for 
estimation of attributable deaths, YLLs, or YLDs. Risks are 
categorised on the basis of how exposure was measured: 
dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous. The PAF 
represents the proportion of risk that would be reduced in a 
given year if the exposure to a risk factor in the past were 
reduced to a counterfactual level of exposure (methods 
appendix p 27).
Causal evidence for risk-outcome pairs
In this study, as in GBD 2013, we have included risk-
outcome pairs that we have assessed as meeting the World 
Cancer Research Fund grades of convincing or probable 
evidence (methods appendix pp 12–13 contains defi
 nitions 
of these grades).9 Table 2 provides a summary of the 
evidence supporting a causal relationship between a risk 
and an outcome for each pair included in GBD 2015. For 
each risk-outcome pair, we used recent systematic reviews 
to identify independent prospective studies (randomised 
controlled trials, non-randomised interventions, and 
cohorts) that evaluated the putative relationship. For risk-
outcome pairs for which no recent systematic review was 
available, we either updated reviews developed for GBD 
2013 or did a new systematic search of literature (methods 
appendix pp 44–159). Table 2 summarises the evidence 
using 
multiple 
dimensions, 
which 
supports 
our 
assessment that each included risk-outcome pair meets 
the criteria of convincing or probable evidence (methods 
appendix [pp 12–13] contains a justifi
 cation of the criteria 
presented to support causality). In this summary of 
evidence, we have focused on randomised controlled trials 
and prospective observational studies, along with 
supporting evidence, like dose-response relationships and 
biologically plausible mechanisms. Other evidence 
supporting causal connections, such as case-control 
studies, are not summarised in table 2.

computational tools, and statistical analysis used in 
derivation of our estimates are provided in the methods

attributable to single or clusters of risk-outcome pairs are

summarised in the methods appendix (p 162). Table 1 
provides defi
 nitions of exposure for each risk factor, the 
TMREL used, and metrics of data availability. For each 
risk, we estimated eff
 ect size as a function of age and sex 
and exposure level, mean exposure, the distribution of 
exposure across individuals, and the TMREL. The 
approach taken is largely similar to GBD 2013 for 
each quantity for each risk. Some methodological 
improvements have been implemented and new data 
sources incorporated. The methods appendix (pp 44–159) 
provides details of each step by risk. Citation information 
for the data sources used for relative risks are provided in 
searchable form through a web tool. We estimate the 
joint eff
 ects of combinations of risk factors using the 
same methods as GBD 2013, namely using published 
studies to estimate the fraction of a risk that was mediated 
through the other risk (methods appendix pp 28–35). 
Relative risks by age and sex for each risk factor and 
outcome pair are provided in the methods appendix 
(pp 215–44).
All point estimates are reported with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs). UIs include uncertainty from each 
relevant component, consisting of exposure, relative 
risks, TMREL, and burden rates. Where percentage 
change is reported (with 95% UIs), we computed it on 
the basis of the point estimates being compared. In this 
study, we provide further methodological detail on new 
extensions to the CRA analysis.
Summary exposure value calculation
In previous GBD studies, we did not report comparable 
exposure metrics for the risk factors included because of 
the complexity of quantifi
 cation of polytomous and 
continuous risks.18 Because of substantial interest in the 
trends in exposure, we developed a summary measure of 
exposure for each risk. This measure, called the summary 
exposure value (SEV), is the relative risk-weighted 
prevalence of exposure. Formally, it is defi
 ned as:
where Pri is prevalence of category i exposure, RRi is 
relative risk of the category i, and RRmax is the maximum 
relative risk observed (between categories). This quantity 
is estimated for each age, sex, location, year, and outcome. 
For each risk factor, a single SEV is estimated by 
averaging of the outcome of specifi
 c SEV values for each 
age, sex, location, and year across outcomes. In the case 
of dichotomous exposure, SEV is equal to prevalence. 
For continuous risks:
where P(x) is the density of exposure at level x of 
exposure, RR(x) is relative risk of the level x, and RRmax is 
the highest relative risk that is supported by data and 
refl
 ects a level where more than 1% of the global 
population are exposed to that level or a higher risk.
SEV takes the value zero when no excess risk for a 
population exists and the value one when the population 
is at the highest level of risk; we report SEV on a scale 
from 0% to 100% to emphasise that it is risk-weighted 
prevalence. We computed as the level for exposure with 
the highest relative risk supported by cohort or trial data 
and for which at least 1% or more of the global 
population is exposed. For comparison purposes, we 
have also computed age-standardised SEVs for every 
risk factor from the most detailed level using the GBD 
population standard.
Decomposition of changes in deaths and DALYs into the 
contribution of population growth, ageing, risk 
exposure, and risk-deleted DALY rates
We did two related decomposition analyses of changes in 
DALYs from 1990 to 2015: decomposing changes in 
cause-specifi
 c DALYs due to changes in population 
growth, population age structure, exposure to all risks for 
a disease, and risk-deleted death and DALY rates; and 
decomposing changes in risk-attributable all-cause 
DALYs due to changes in population growth, population 
age structure, risk exposure to the single risk factor, and

If multiple reports existed from one study, we counted them as one study. We only assessed the dose-response relationship for continuous risks. To evaluate the magnitude of the eff
 ect size for continuous risks, 
we evaluated the RR comparing the 75th percentile with the 25th percentile of the exposure distribution at the global level. Additional information for this table is found in the methods appendix (pp 245–63). 
RCT=randomised controlled trial. RR=relative risk. *Prospective cohort studies or non-randomised interventions. †Whether or not any biological or mechanistic pathway exists that could potentially explain the 
relationship of the risk-outcome pair. ‡Whether or not the risk is associated with another outcome from the same category and whether or not any evidence exists that it can cause the current outcome through 
the same pathway.

risk-deleted DALY rates. Risk-deleted rates are the rates 
after removal of the eff
 ect of a risk factor or combination 
of risk factors; in other words, observed DALY rates 
multiplied by one minus the PAF for the risk or set of 
risks. Our decomposition analyses draw from methods 
developed by Das Gupta19 to provide a computationally 
tractable solution to estimate the contribution of multiple 
factors to an outcome (methods appendix pp 36–37). For 
some risks where the PAF is 100%, such as fasting 
plasma glucose and diabetes, the methods have had to be 
further adapted. We were not able to include three 
outcomes in this analysis: cervical cancer, sexually 
transmitted diseases, and HIV
/AIDS.
Risk transition with development
We examined how changes in risk exposure were related 
to changes along the development spectrum. Drawing 
from methods used to construct the Human Development 
Index,20 we constructed the SDI, a summary measure of 
overall development based on estimates of lag-dependent 
income per capita, average educational attainment over 
the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate. In the SDI, we 
weighted each component equally and rescaled them 
from zero (for the lowest value observed during 
1980–2015) to one (for the highest value observed) for 
income per capita and average years of schooling, and 
the reverse for the total fertility rate. We computed the 
fi
 nal SDI score as the geometric mean of each of the 
components. For each risk, we calculated the average 
relationship between risk exposure, as measured by SEV, 
and SDI across all geography years by age and sex using 
spline regression (methods appendix pp 38–39). We then 
used this relationship to characterise how exposures to 
risk vary on the basis of SDI alone.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The authors had full access to all the data in 
the study and had fi
 nal responsibility to submit for 
publication. 
Results
Global exposure to risks
The SEV is a single, interpretable measure, which 
captures risk-weighted exposure for a population, or risk-
weighted prevalence of an exposure. The scale for SEV 
spans 0% to 100%, such that an SEV of 0% refl
 ects no 
risk exposure in a population and 100% indicates that an 
entire population has maximum possible risk. A decline 
in SEV indicates reduced exposure to a given risk factor, 
whereas an increase in SEV indicates increased exposure. 
Table 3 provides age-standardised SEVs for 61 risks at the 
global level, by sex, for 1990, 2005, and 2015 (results 
appendix pp 3619–4070 contains results for every 
geography). From 1990 to 2015, SEVs decreased by more 
than 30% for four risks: unsafe sanitation (38·3% 
[95% UI 36·1–40·5]), childhood underweight (34·2% 
[30·9–37·9]), childhood stunting (33·4% [30·3–37·4]), 
and household air pollution (30·2% [26·9–33·2]). The 
global SEV for smoking also decreased by 2015, 
decreasing by 27·5% (23·2–30·9) for men and 28·7% 
(20·2–34·1) for women; notably, smoking exposure 
among men still far exceeded that for women in 2015. 
Signifi
 cant, although more moderate than for smoking 
reductions in global SEVs for both sexes occurred for 
second-hand smoke (12·2% [9·4–15·1]), unsafe water 
(9·4% [5·3–13·0]), and diet high in red meat (9·0% 
[7·6–10·3]) from 1990 to 2015. Risk exposure for high 
total cholesterol signifi
 cantly declined for both men and 
women during this time, although this decrease was 
smaller among men (3·2% [2·2–4·4]) than among 
women (5·6% [4·6–6·7]). For a subset of occupational 
risk factors, such as ergonomic factors and asthmagens, 
global SEVs were reduced from 1990 to 2015.
For a subset of risks, minimal changes in exposure 
occurred between 1990 and 2015. This fi
 nding was 
particularly evident among various dietary risks (eg, diet 
low in fruits) and behaviours related to nutrition 
(eg, non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding). 
Discordant trends emerged by sex for some risk factors, 
such as low physical activity, where global SEVs for men 
increased by 2·4% (95% UI 1·8–2·9), whereas the SEV for 
women declined by 1·5% (1·0–2·0). Global SEVs 
signifi
 cantly increased for 27 risk factors for both sexes 
combined from 1990 to 2015; signifi
 cant increases occurred 
for 24 risks for men alone and 23 risks for women alone. 
We recorded the most pronounced rises for various 
occupational exposures, such as diesel engine exhaust, 
silica, and benzene. Global SEVs for high body-mass index 
(BMI) increased by 38·7% (29·9–55·6) for men and 34·4% 
(27·7–45·7) for women. For both sexes, other risks with 
large increases included drug use (30·2% [23·3–39·1]), 
ambient ozone pollution (24·6% [15·0–31·9]), and high 
fasting plasma glucose (23·8% [22·4–25·4]).
Global attributable burden for all risk factors combined 
and their overlap
The proportion of deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs that 
could be jointly attributable to all risk factors combined 
diff
 ered by cause group and measure of health (table 4). 
Globally, 57·8% (95% UI 56·6–58·8) of deaths, 48·4% 
(47·4–49·3) of YLLs, 26·1% (25·0–27·1) of YLDs, and 
41·2% (39·8–42·8) of DALYs could be attributed to the 
risk factors currently assessed as part of GBD 2015. 
Across health outcomes, attributable DALYs were 
highest 
for 
non-communicable 
diseases 
(NCDs), 
although the percentage of attributable burden ranged 
from 20·9% (19·7–22·0) for YLDs to 64·8% (63·3–66·2) 
for deaths in 2015. Among NCD cause groups, 
attributable DALYs were as high as 85·3% (84·0–86·6) 
for cardiovascular and circulatory diseases compared 
with low attributable DALYs, even among leading 
causes of disease burden (ie, 16·0% [13·9–18·2] for

musculoskeletal disorders and 22·5% [20·1–25·4] for 
mental and substance use disorders). In 2015, 
approximately 40–60% of DALYs due to cancers, 
cirrhosis, and chronic respiratory diseases could be 
attributed to risk factors assessed in this study. Except 
for YLDs, less than 50% of disease burden for Group 1 
causes—communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutri-
tional diseases—could be attributed to analysed risk 
factors. Risk factors accounted for less than 20% of early 
death and disability from maternal disorders (eg, 10·2% 
[4·1–16·8] of DALYs).
Categories of risk factors—metabolic, environmental 
or occupational, and behavioural risks—often jointly 
contribute to disease burden. In 2015, 41·2% (95% UI 
39·8–42·8) of global DALYs could be attributed to 
analysed risk factors, whereas 58·8% (57·2–60·2) of 
global disease burden could not be explicitly attributed to 
specifi
 c risk factors. In terms of individual risk categories, 
behavioural risk factors accounted for 30·3% (28·6–32·0) 
of attributable DALYs in 2015, followed by metabolic 
(15·5% [14·7–16·3]) and environmental or occupational 
risk factors (13·0 [11·9–14·0]). Regionally, total risk-
attributable burden ranged from 59·0% (57·0–60·9) in 
southern sub-Saharan Africa to 33·5% (32·1–35·1) in 
north Africa and the Middle East; furthermore, ten 
regions had less than 40% of total DALYs attributable to 
risks being analysed (fi
 gure 1).
Levels and trends in the burden attributable to risk factors
Table 4 reports all-cause deaths and DALYs attributable to 
all risk factors from 2005 to 2015, including detail on 
attributable deaths and DALYs by risk-outcome pair 
(results appendix pp 3–2488 contains results for 
every geography). Globally, 32·2 million (95% UI 
31·5 million to 33·0 million) deaths were attributable to 
all risk factors in 2015, a 4·9% (3·2–6·7) increase since 
2005; however, age-standardised attributable deaths 
declined from 2005 to 2015 (a 17·9% decrease [16·6–19·2] 
to 497·5 deaths per 100 000 [485·2–510·0]). By contrast, 
total DALYs attributable to all risks decreased since 2005 
by 5·6% (3·8–7·5) to 1·0 billion DALYs (0·96–1·09 billion) 
in 2015 and age-standardised DALYs attributable to all 
risks decreased since 2005 by 20·9% (19·5–22·5) to 
14 412·9 DALYs per 100 000 (13 553·0–15 360·1) in 2015. 
Deaths and burden attributable to environmental and 
occupational risks signifi
 cantly fell across measures, 
with 
age-standardised 
deaths 
falling 
by 
22·5% 
(20·6–24·4) to 142·6 deaths per 100 000 (130·1–155·6) in 
2015 and age-standardised DALYs decreasing by 24·8% 
(22·1–27·1) to 4500 DALYs per 100 000 (4164·6–4853·9) 
in 2015.
Progress in environmental risks was mainly driven by 
sizeable reductions in mortality and disease burden 
attributable to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene, as 
well as to household air pollution. From 2005 to 2015, 
global deaths attributable to unsafe water and no 
handwashing with soap fell by more than 12%, whereas 
DALYs decreased by more than 20%. More rapid declines 
than in the above-mentioned risks in attributable deaths 
(27·5% [95% UI 22·3–32·7]) and burden (31·9% 
[25·7–37·4]) occurred for unsafe sanitation since 2005, to 
807 904·2 deaths (727 439·6–895 462·5) in 2015 and to 
46·3 million DALYs (41·1 million to 51·8 million) in 
2015. Reductions in attributable mortality and DALYs due 
to diarrhoeal diseases (associated with unsafe water, 
sanitation, and hygiene) were particularly prominent. 
Attributable deaths due to household air pollution 
decreased by 13·0% (9·3–17·0) to 2·9 million deaths 
(2·2 million to 3·6 million) in 2015 and disease burden 
decreased by 20·3% (16·6–24·5) to 85·6 million DALYs 
(66·7 million to 106·1 million) in 2015; large declines 
also occurred in age-standardised rates of attributable 
mortality and DALYs. Occupational risk factors generally 
accounted for a smaller proportion of global deaths and

disease burden than did environmental risk factors; 
nonetheless, attributable mortality and DALYS due to 
various occupational risk factors substantially increased 
from 2005 to 2015.
Behavioural risks can be grouped into four main 
categories: generally large reductions for risk-attributable 
mortality and disease burden for risk factors associated 
with child and maternal malnutrition, mixed results for 
risk factors pertaining to alcohol and drug use, rising 
attributable deaths and DALYs due to dietary risk factors, 
and considerably varied trends for other behavioural risks, 
which span from sexual abuse and intimate partner 
violence to low physical activity. Attributable deaths and 
disease burden due to metabolic risks have increased since 
2005, particularly for high fasting plasma glucose, for 
which all measures of attributable mortality and DALYs 
increased by more than 15% from 2005 to 2015. These 
increases in attributable burden from high fasting plasma 
glucose were led by increased deaths and DALYs from 
ischaemic heart disease, haemorrhagic stroke, chronic 
kidney disease, and diabetes. Attributable deaths and 
DALYs for high BMI also increased substantially, with 
645 244 (95% UI 457 647–862 412) more attributable deaths 
in 2015 than in 2005. Attributable mortality and DALYs due 
to low glomerular fi
 ltration rates also signifi
 cantly 
increased from 2005 to 2015, with these increases primarily 
associated with rises in attributable deaths and burden due 
to cardiovascular and circulatory diseases and chronic 
kidney disease.
Global risk patterns by sex
In 2015, the relative ranks and attributable burden due to 
Level 2 risk factors varied between men and women 
(fi
 gure 2). As the leading risk factor for both sexes, dietary 
risks accounted for 12·2% (95% UI 10·8–13·6) of total 
DALYs for men and 9·0% (7·8–10·3%) of total DALYs for 
women. These risks, which include diet high in sodium 
and diet low in fruit, contributed most to DALYs associated 
with three cause groups: cardiovascular and circulatory 
diseases, cancers, and diabetes and urogenital, blood, and 
endocrine diseases. In 2015, high systolic blood pressure 
also ranked among the leading risks for both sexes, 
contributing to 9·2% (8·3–10·2) of DALYs for men and 
7·8% (6·9–8·7) of DALYs for women. Air pollution was 
the fi
 fth-leading risk for both sexes, largely contributing 
to DALYs associated with cardiovascular and circulatory 
diseases, as well as lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal 
diseases, and other common infectious diseases. Child 
and maternal malnutrition, the leading global risk factor 
in 1990, was the second-leading risk for women and the 
sixth-leading risk for men in 2015.
Smoking was the second-leading risk factor for men 
in 2015, contributing to 9·6% (95% UI 8·5–10·7) of 
DALYs and a large proportion of male disease burden 
from cardiovascular and circulatory diseases, cancers, 
and chronic respiratory conditions. As the fi
 fth-leading 
risk for men, alcohol and drug use was associated with 
6·6% (6·1–7·1) of disease burden in 2015, primarily due 
to mental and substance use disorders, as well as 
cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases; the burden 
attributable to these risk factors was far less for women 
(2·0% [1·8–2·2]) than for men. In 2015, high fasting 
plasma glucose was associated with 6·0% (5·4–6·6) of 
DALYs for men and 5·6% (5·1–6·2) for women. For 
women, 3·8% (3·4–4·3) of burden was attributable to 
unsafe sex, largely from HIV/AIDS and cervical cancer, 
whereas for men, 2·8% (2·5–3·0) was attributable to 
unsafe sex.
Changes in leading risk factors in 1990, 2005, and 2015
Rising total attributable DALYs amid declines from 1990 
to 2015 for age-standardised DALY rates were evident for 
various metabolic and behavioural risks, emphasising

epidemiological factors on global risk profi
 les (fi
 gure 3). 
In 1990, childhood undernutrition, unsafe water, and 
high systolic blood pressure were the leading three risk 
factors for attributable DALYs. Of these risks, only high 
systolic blood pressure ranked among the leading three 
risks in 2015. Large reductions in both total attributable 
DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates from 1990 
resulted in childhood undernutrition being ranked as the 
fi
 fth-leading risk factor in 2015 and unsafe water being 
ranked as the 14th-leading risk factor.
Environmental risk factors, including household air 
pollution and unsafe sanitation, decreased in terms of 
total attributable DALYs, age-standardised DALY rates, 
and relative ranks from 1990 to 2015. Over the period 
1990–2005, attributable total DALYs for occupational risk 
factors, such as ergonomic factors, rose by more than 20% 
from 1990 to 2005, although age-standardised rates 
decreased by 9·5% (95% UI 7·3–11·7) over the same time 
period. Similar patterns occurred for most behavioural 
risk factors from 1990 to 2005, with signifi
 cant increases 
in total attributable DALYs occurring for many of these 
risks; at the same time, age-standardised DALY rates 
signifi
 cantly fell (eg, smoking, low physical activity, and 
most dietary risks, including diet high in sodium). Unsafe 
sex and drug use were exceptions, with each measure of 
attributable burden signifi
 cantly increasing since from 
1990 to 2005. For unsafe sex and drug use in particular, 
this rapid rise corresponded with the global HIV
/AIDS 
epidemic. For most risk factors, the time period of 2005–15 
resulted in an extension of earlier trends, with continued 
gains in reductions of attributable DALYs due to various 
environmental risk factors and more varied patterns 
for many metabolic and behavioural risks than for 
environmental risks. Yet, some important changes 
occurred between 2005 and 2015, including large 
reductions in attributable total DALYs (29·5% [26·8–32·0]) 
and age-standardised DALY rates (37·6% [35·2–39·8]) for 
unsafe sex and in attributable total DALYs (10·5% 
[2·8–17·8]) and age-standardised DALY rates (23·2% 
[16·8–29·1]) for intimate partner violence.
Contrasting global changes in risk exposure and 
attributable burden
A comparison of percentage change in risk exposure 
from 1990 to 2015 with the level of attributable DALYs in 
2015 helps to identify large risks for which a long-term 
increase in global exposure has occurred (fi
 gure 4). 
Although disease burden attributable to unsafe 
sanitation, household air pollution, stunting, and 
underweight caused more than 10 million DALYs

in 2015, exposure to these risks decreased for both sexes 
from 1990 to 2015 by more than 30%. Conversely, two 
risks caused more than 100 million DALYs and increased 
by more than 20%: high fasting plasma glucose and 
high BMI. Other risks with large increases in exposure 
but which caused less than 10 million DALYs include 
various occupational exposures, drug use, ambient 
ozone pollution, second-hand smoke, and diets low in

polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). For a large group 
of risks at the global scale, exposure increased or 
decreased by less than 10% from 1990 to 2015. These 
included many components of diet, high systolic blood 
pressure, ambient particulate matter pollution, and 
alcohol use.
Decomposition of changes in risk-attributable DALYs to 
population growth, ageing, risk exposure, and risk-
deleted DALY rates
Drivers of global changes in overall DALYs attributable to 
risk factors varied (fi
 gure 5). Across Level 3 risk factors, 
overall changes in all-cause attributable DALYs ranged 
from declines exceeding 50% for seven risk factors, 
including childhood undernutrition, suboptimal breast-
feeding, and unsafe sanitation, to increases near to or 
exceeding 100% (ie, high BMI, occupational carcinogens, 
and drug use). Of these 46 Level 3 risk factors, attributable 
all-cause DALYs decreased signifi
 cantly for ten from 1990 
to 2015, whereas 34 increased signifi
 cantly; two did not 
signifi
 cantly change. Population ageing led to increased 
attributable all-cause DALYs for most risk factors, with a 
relative contribution that spanned from lower than 10% 
(for household air pollution from solid fuels and 
occupational injuries) to greater than 60% (for occu-
pational carcinogens). Population ageing contributed to 
reductions in all-cause DALYs attributable to eight risk 
factors, namely environmental risks (eg, a 13·5% 
[95% UI 6·0–19·9] decrease for no handwashing with 
soap), those associated with nutritional defi
 ciencies (eg, a 
17·6% [12·6–24·0] decline for childhood undernutrition), 
and behavioural risks (eg, a 22·0% [10·9–31·4] decline 
for suboptimal breastfeeding). Changes in risk-deleted 
DALY rates since 1990 were primary drivers of reductions 
in all-cause, risk-attributable burden, with decreases in 
underlying DALY rates exceeding 50% for 13 risks by 
2015. By contrast, changes in risk exposure varied 
markedly, contributing to declines in all-cause DALYs for 
ten risks (eg, 30·0% [29·0–38·0] due to declines in risk 
exposure for household air pollution and 21·7% 
[17·5–30·4] due to declines in risk exposure for iron 
defi
 ciency); at the same time, change attributable to risk 
exposure increased for 16 risk factors to more than 25%, 
including high fasting blood glucose (25·1% [19·7–27·9]), 
ambient ozone pollution (37·5% [31·5–42·7]), occu-
pational carcinogens (40·1% [28·5–50·8]), occu 
pational 
injuries 
(41·1% 
[37·0–48·1]), 
high

Figure 3: Leading 30 Level 3 global risk factors for DALYs for both sexes combined, 1990, 2005, and 2015, with percentage change in number of DALYs, and all-age, and age-standardised rates
Risks are connected by lines between time periods. For the time period of 1990 to 2005 and for 2005 to 2015, three measures of change are shown: percent change in the number of DALYs, percent 
change in the all-age DALY rate, and percent change in the age-standardised DALY rate. Changes that are statistically signifi
 cant are shown in bold. DALYs=disability-adjusted life-years.

Decreases in underlying cause-specifi
 c DALY rates—
as opposed to other factors—were generally the main 
drivers of overarching reductions in cause-specifi
 c 
burden attributable to all risk factors (methods appendix 
pp 164–65). From 1990 to 2015, 36 causes decreased in 
terms of associated risk exposure, including a number 
of communicable causes, nutritional defi

exposure was the only factor that improved from 1990 to 
2015 for a subset of causes, with changes in population 
growth, ageing, and underlying cause-specifi

Figure 6 shows the evolution of SEV by region for the ten 
leading global risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs 
as SDI changes and also provides the expected SEV level 
on the basis of SDI alone. Two main trends emerged: 
increasing and then levelling of SEVs for most metabolic

Risks are reported in order of percentage change in the number of attributable DALYs from 1990 to 2015. We excluded DALYs attributable to unsafe sex because this 
risk factor is not estimated on the basis of exposure and relative risk. Changes due to population growth, population ageing, risk exposure, and the risk-deleted DALY 
rate are shown. DALYs=disability-adjusted life-years.

risks and those associated with childhood undernutrition 
as SDI approached mid-levels. For metabolic and dietary 
risks, above an SDI of approximately 0·8, expected levels 
of risk exposure either moderately dropped or remained 
fairly constant. An exception was alcohol use, for which 
SEVs increased with each increment of SDI. By contrast, 
SEVs for ambient particulate matter pollution did not 
substantially decline until above an SDI of 0·60, and the 
pace of SEV reductions for household air pollution 
accelerated above an SDI of about 0·40. These patterns 
refl
 ect the complex shifts in risk exposure that accompany 
changes in development, which are further emphasised 
by regional SEV trends by risk factor.
Two risk factors related to nutrition or diet—childhood 
wasting and diet high in sodium—refl
 ected the nuances 
of changing risk exposure and levels of development. 
Particularly among regions with an SDI below 0·8, SEVs 
for childhood wasting decreased over time and with 
increasing SDI; nonetheless, a subset of regions, including 
south Asia and western sub-Saharan Africa, had con-
sistently higher than expected SEVs for childhood wasting 
on the basis of SDI. For diet high in sodium, most regions 
saw minimal changes in exposure over time, even amid 
increases in SDI. In east Asia, SEVs for diet high in 
sodium were consistently above expected levels of 
exposure given SDI, whereas the opposite trend was 
found for Oceania and central Latin America. Across the 
development spectrum—including high-income Asia 
Pacifi
 c, southeast Asia, and eastern sub-Saharan Africa—
exposure for diet high in sodium was at least moderately 
higher than expected on the basis of the SDI for a given 
region. Heterogeneous risk patterns occurred for two 
leading environmental risks—household air pollution 
and ambient particulate matter pollution—particularly in 
terms of the relationship between SEVs and increasing 
SDI. For smoking and alcohol use, strikingly diff
 erent 
trends for SEV and SDI occurred. Although nearly every 
region recorded declines in SEVs for smoking, the rate at

which these reductions took place alongside changes in 
SDI varied.
Regional and national risk profi
 les
Leading risk factors for early death and disability, as 
measured by attributable DALYs, varied by region, level of 
SDI, and sex in 2015 (fi
 gure 7). In high-income North 
America and the UK, smoking was the leading risk for 
attributable DALYs among both men and women, but for 
most of western Europe, smoking was the leading risk 
factor only for men, whereas high systolic blood pressure 
was the leading risk factor for women. A similar pattern 
emerged in east and southeast Asia, with smoking ranked 
as the leading risk factors for men in China, Thailand, 
Vietnam, and the Philippines, whereas metabolic risk 
factors—namely high systolic blood pressure—was the 
leading risk factor for attributable DALYs for women in 
these countries. Childhood undernutrition ranked as the 
leading risk factor for early death and disability for both 
sexes throughout western and central sub-Saharan Africa, 
as well as in a few countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa 
(eg, Laos and Tajikistan).
In terms of the leading ten risk factors for both sexes, 
regional and country risk profi
 les showed both distinct 
patterns and heterogeneity. High systolic blood 
pressure was the leading risk for DALYs for 
13 high-income countries and territories in 2015, high 
fasting plasma glucose was the leading risk for three, 
and smoking was the leading risk for 21. For a subset of 
geographies, including the USA, Canada, Australia, 
and the UK, drug use was a major risk for early death 
and disability in 2015. In 2015, high systolic blood 
pressure, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose 
were the leading risk factors for almost all geographies 
in Latin America and the Caribbean; Haiti was the 
primary exception, with unsafe sex as its leading risk 
for attributable DALYs in 2015. Across southeast Asia, 
east Asia, and Oceania, high systolic blood pressure 
was the leading risk factor for disease burden in 
nine countries and territories, ranging from China to 
Vanuatu. High BMI was the leading risk for DALYs in 
nine geographies, and high fasting plasma glucose 
ranked as the leading risk factor for three geographies, 
including Taiwan.

High systolic blood pressure was among the leading 
two risk factors for all geographies in south Asia and, 
except for Pakistan and Bhutan, household air pollution 
remained among the leading four risk factors for 
attributable DALYs across geographies in this region. 
Ambient particulate matter pollution ranked as the third-
leading risk factor in India and Nepal, whereas smoking 
was the second-leading risk factor for attributable burden 
in Bangladesh. In central Europe, eastern Europe, and 
central Asia, 28 of 29 countries had high systolic blood 
pressure as their leading risk factor for attributable DALYs 
in 2015; Tajikistan, where childhood undernutrition was 
the leading risk factor, was the only exception. Across 
central Europe, smoking was the second-leading risk 
factor for early death and disability, whereas alcohol use 
was among the leading four risk factors for attributable 
DALYs in geographies including Belarus, Moldova, 
and Russia.
Throughout north Africa and the Middle East, except for 
Tunisia, high systolic blood pressure was among the three 
leading risk factors for disease burden in 2015, with nine 
geographies, including Egypt and Iran, recording this risk 
as the leading driver of early death and disability in that 
year. High BMI accounted for the highest attributable 
DALYs in eight countries, including Jordan and Saudi 
Arabia, and was also among the leading six risks for all 
countries in the region. For Afghanistan and Sudan, 
childhood undernutrition was the leading risk for DALYs 
in 2015, whereas it was the second-leading risk for DALYs 
in Yemen and the eighth-leading risk in Egypt. Unlike 
most of sub-Saharan Africa, several metabolic risks also 
emerged as leading drivers of attributable DALYs in 
southern sub-Saharan Africa by 2015; high BMI ranked as 
the second-leading risk factor in South Africa, and high 
systolic blood pressure was among the leading three risk 
factors for attributable DALYs in Botswana. In central 
sub-Saharan Africa, childhood undernutrition and unsafe 
sex were ranked fi
 rst and second for attributable disease 
burden in all geographies except for Gabon. High systolic 
blood pressure ranked among the leading risk factors for 
attributable DALYs in most geographies in the region 
(eg, second in Gabon and third in the Congo).

Discussion
Overview
Drawing from 25 500 data sources, we estimated exposure 
to 79 metabolic, environmental and occupational, and 
behavioural risk factors or clusters of risks from 1990 to 
2015 in 195 countries and territories and attributed deaths 
and overall disease burden to these risks. In 2015, all risks 
combined contributed to 57·8% (95% UI 56·6–58·8) of 
deaths and 41·2% (39·8–42·8) of DALYs worldwide. Since 
1990, global risk exposure for both sexes combined 
increased signifi
 cantly for 27 risks, did not signifi
 cantly 
change for seven risks, and declined signifi
 cantly for 
27 risks. At the same time, that risk exposure increased 
for various leading risks, particularly metabolic risk 
factors associated with NCDs, and age-standardised 
risk-attributable deaths and DALYs declined for most 
risks. Globally, pronounced reductions in risk-deleted or 
underlying cause-specifi
 c DALY rates off
 set minimal 
changes in, or increased, risk exposure. These gains in 
risk-deleted DALY rates might not be large enough in the 
future to compensate for rising levels of risk exposure, 
such as high BMI or high fasting plasma glucose.
Rethinking the risk transition
Societal processes of urbanisation, the so-called 
westernisation of diets and lifestyles, and changes in 
employment activities, have all been viewed as primary 
drivers of changes in human health.21–24 Such shifts have 
been thought to lead to deteriorating diets, rising obesity, 
decreased physical activity, and, ultimately, to worsening 
levels of metabolic risks, with associated higher rates of 
cardiovascular diseases and cancers.25,26 Results from the 
this study point to an ongoing risk transition, but with a 
trajectory complex and nuanced. The relationship 
between SEVs for most risks and SDI identifi
 ed that poor 
water, poor sanitation, household air pollution, and 
micronutrient defi
 ciencies and undernutrition decline 
steadily as countries develop. By contrast, some risks 
become worse as development proceeds, at least up to 
levels of SDI of about 0·8; these risks include low

physical activity, high BMI, high total cholesterol, low 
PUFAs, partial breastfeeding, alcohol use, diet high in 
red meat, smoking, and diet high in sugar-sweetened 
beverages. Some risks that appear to worsen through 
early phases of development improved at the highest 
levels of SDI, such as smoking. As improvements in SDI 
continue and behavioural risks grow in dominance, an 
understanding of how to change behaviours eff
 ectively at 
both the individual level and for populations becomes 
increasingly relevant. Many other components of diet, 
occupational exposures, and some environmental risks 
do not show a marked relationship with development.
The eff
 ects of the risk transition, at least globally, are 
often mitigated by trends in risk-deleted death or DALY 
rates. In this study, we identify likely candidates for 
specifi
 c drivers of improvements. Unmeasured risk 
factors could be driving these trends. Unlike cardio-
vascular diseases and some neoplasms, for other causes 
such as mental disorders or neurological disorders, the 
set of risks included in this study account for 
comparatively little of the observed burden; these causes 
make up an increasing share of the burden for 
geographies at high SDI. To date, we have not identifi
 ed 
risk factors that meet our criteria of convincing or 
probable evidence, suggesting that research into 
unquantifi
 ed risks is needed. In accompanying GBD 2015 
analyses,27–29 we documented widespread improvements 
in overall development as measured by SDI. Gains in 
SDI are likely to operate through many pathways, 
including improved access to health care, public health 
programmes, and social and welfare policy. Advances in 
treatment are well documented for various causes, 
including HIV
/AIDS,30–32 ischaemic heart disease,33–37 and 
various cancers,38–40 including breast,41–43 testicular,44 and 
Hodgkin’s,45 yet for other causes, such as oesophageal 
cancer and interpersonal violence, the policies, pro-
grammes, and interventions responsible for declining 
risk-deleted death and DALY rates are less clear than for 
the aforementioned causes. Improvement of under-
standing of the risk-deleted rates in cause-specifi
 c 
mortality and disease burden will strengthen the evi-
dence base for intervention eff
 ectiveness, the role of

medical care access in addressing disease burden, and 
the importance of other social and welfare policies.
A global risk typology
We used our decomposition of drivers of attributable 
burden to identify four distinct groups of risks at the 
global level. First, for ten risks, attributable burden is 
declining, as is the exposure to the risk factor. This set of 
risks is dominated by the environmental risks, which are 
particularly common at low levels of SDI, and consist of 
vitamin A defi
 ciency, undernutrition, zinc defi
 ciency, 
suboptimal breastfeeding, poor sanitation, no hand-
washing, poor water, second-hand smoke, household air 
pollution, and occupational asthmagens. For these risks 
as a group, not only has exposure been declining, but 
risk-deleted DALY rates also declined, such as for 
diarrhoeal diseases. Furthermore, global shifts in popu-
lation age structure contributed to decreases in both 
cause-specifi
 c and attributable burdens for risks that 
predominantly aff
 ect children. A second group of risks 
was characterised by declines in exposure exceeding 10% 
from 1990 to 2015, but increasing attributable burden, 
due in most cases to large increases driven by population 
growth and ageing. This group includes smoking, high 
systolic blood pressure, occupational ergonomic factors, 
childhood sexual abuse, and iron defi
 ciency; for iron 
defi
 ciency, the increase in attributable burden was quite 
small over the period 1990–2015. For a third group, 
attributable burden is increasing, and trends in exposure 
account for a less than 10% increase or decrease in 
attributable burden. This larger group of risks than the 
fi
 rst two groups includes all components of diet except 
for low PUFA intake and diet high in sugar-sweetened 
beverages, some occupational exposures, residential 
radon, low glomerular fi
 ltration rate, alcohol use, high 
total cholesterol, intimate partner violence, lead exposure, 
low bone mineral density, and low physical activity. For 
these risks, attributable burden is increasing because of 
population growth and ageing. The degree of increase is 
driven by the extent to which declines in risk-deleted 
DALY rates compensate for the increases due to 
population growth and ageing. The fi
 nal category is the

risks that are perhaps the most concerning: those with 
increasing attributable burden and exposure contributing 
to an increase of at least 10% since 1990. This list includes 
occupational injuries, ambient ozone pollution, occu-
pational carcinogens, diet low in PUFAs, diet high in 
sugar-sweetened beverages, drug use, high fasting 
plasma glucose, and high BMI. For these risks, declines 
in underlying rates were probably responsible for 
prevention of additional increases in attributable burden. 
Any risk for which attributable deaths and DALYs are 
increasing is a threat to both health systems and societies, 
but the risks that fall within the fourth group—risk 
factors with rising exposure and associated health loss—
require immediate attention from policy makers and 
other stakeholders.
Unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing
The conventional approach to assessment of the 
contribution of unsafe water to health is to assess access 
to improved water sources as defi
 ned in the Millennium 
Development Goals.46,47 WHO estimated that, in 2015, 
91% of populations living in low-income and middle-
income countries had access to improved water and 68% 
had access to improved sanitation since 1990.48,49 Implicit 
in the focus on improved is the idea that the most 
important reductions in diarrhoea come from movement 
from an unimproved to an improved source of water or 
sanitation. However, fi
 ndings from meta-analyses of 
intervention studies and retrospective cohorts show a 
wide variation of relative risks of diarrhoea within the 
category of improved water and improved sanitation. We 
found that the SEV for poor water was only 56·0% 
(95% UI 50·4–62·1) for men and 55·7% (50·2–61·8) for 
women in 2015, a small improvement of just 9·4% 
(5·3–13·0) since 1990. By contrast, for unsafe sanitation, 
the SEV decreased substantially, from 55·0% (53·8–56·5) 
in 1990 for men and 54·2% (52·8–55·7) for women to 
33·7% (32·2–35·1) for both men and women in 2015. 
Our assessment of SEV for water showed that a 
substantial agenda is still needed across the world to 
achieve the overall goal of safe water and sanitation. The 
sixth Sustainable Development Goal includes targets for

achievement of both universal and equitable access to 
safe drinking water and adequate and equitable sanitation 
for all by 2030.50,51 Given SEVs in many of these areas of 
the world, a large gap remains between current levels of 
safe water and sanitation and universal access. Moreover, 
our analyses show that progress in provision of safe 
water lags behind that of safe sanitation. This shift in 
focus to the lowest risk categories raises the bar 
considerably for what is needed for investment to reduce 
the risk of diarrhoea in all regions of the world.
Tobacco
The SEV for smoking has decreased in many countries 
as well as globally. Global tobacco-attributable deaths and 
DALYs, however, have continued to rise because of 
increases in population numbers and ageing, which 
overwhelm declines in both exposure and risk-deleted 
rates of related disease burden. Given a known highly 
eff
 ective set of intervention strategies to reduce tobacco 
consumption,52–58 the challenge for tobacco is one of 
political priority for tobacco control. Despite the 
important developments of the Framework Convention 
on Tobacco Control, in many countries, progress has 
been slow or consumption has even increased. Continued 
close monitoring of tobacco consumption and the deaths 
and DALYs attributable to tobacco remains an essential 
aid to promotion of policies to reduce tobacco 
consumption.
In GBD 2015, for long-term eff
 ects of smoking on lung 
cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we 
used the Peto-Lopez method,59 which estimates the 
lifetime cumulative eff
 ect of cigarette smoking using a 
transformation of the observed lung cancer death rate. 
Although this method provides robust estimates of the

burden of cancers related to tobacco, it is not fully 
consistent with the GBD approach of estimation of 
exposure independently of the outcomes aff
 ected by 
exposure. With a growing body of evidence for the 
association between smoking and other cancers and a 
good estimate of distribution of smoking, direct 
estimation of attributable burden is possible. Modelling 
of the direct relationship between smoking exposure in 
the past and present to cancers will also allow for 
exploration of counterfactual scenarios and other forms 
of CRA, such as estimation of avoidable burden. The set 
of outcomes that have been related to tobacco in pooled 
cohort studies60 includes many outcomes not quantifi
 ed 
in this study, such as road traffi
  c accidents, renal failure, 
and infectious diseases; careful assessment of which of 
these new outcomes meet the criteria of convincing or 
probable evidence is needed. Quantifi
 cation of the full 
eff
 ects of tobacco will also require inclusion in future 
GBD studies of smokeless tobacco consumption. 
Regardless of the estimation method used or the scope of 
outcomes evaluated, tobacco remains a major global risk 
factor, despite more than 50 years of antitobacco eff
 orts.
Dietary assessment
Many aspects of dietary assessment remain controversial. 
Evidence for the eff
 ect of diet on NCDs mostly comes 
from prospective cohort studies using food frequency 
questionnaires (FFQs) with 1 year recall to establish diet 
at baseline. Findings from 24 h recalls or multiple-day 
diary records show a poor correlation with annual 
FFQs.61,62 Proponents of FFQs argue that the rank order 
of levels of intake across individuals in the annual FFQ is 
robust.62 Some authors have argued that measurement 
error for each diet component in the statistical analysis of 
the cohort data will tend to bias the fi
 ndings towards the 
null and thus underestimate the eff
 ects of a diet 
component.63 However, the direction of bias in settings 
with measurement error in multiple independent 
variables is unknown in the presence of correlation 
between diff
 erent variables.64,65 At the population level, 
single 24 h recall has been used in many nutrition 
surveys. 24 h recall probably underestimates, as shown in 
doubly labelled water66 and urinary sodium studies.67
Correlation between diet components is a crucial 
aspect of diet. Intake of benefi
 cial dietary factors are 
generally, but not always, positively correlated with each 
other and inversely correlated with harmful dietary 
factors. This correlation could overestimate the relative 
risk of each dietary factor in cohorts as well as the total 
eff
 ect of dietary risks at the population level. Use of 
dietary pattern as the main exposure could potentially 
address this problem; however, several challenges exist 
in adoption of this approach for GBD. Concerns remain 
about the magnitude of the eff
 ect size of individual 
dietary risk factors on chronic diseases. Although many 
prospective cohorts have collected dietary data,68 
published meta-analyses for most diet-disease pairs have 
included reports from only a fraction of these cohorts, 
indicating the potential for publication bias. Furthermore, 
most cohorts assessing the eff
 ect of diet on disease 
endpoints have adjusted for total energy intake in their 
statistical models. This practice emerged to address 
measurement error in dietary assessment tools and 
remove the eff
 ect of energy as a potential confounder. 
The adjustment for total energy intake means that diet 
components are defi
 ned as risks in terms of the share of 
diet and not as absolute levels of exposure. Because diet 
shares are analysed, increases in any component imply 
reductions in some other component, leading to the 
notion of replacement. Diet components are often 
analysed as pairs in which one component replaces 
another, further complicating analysis of cohort data. 
Given that many cohorts do not include the same dietary 
components in their analyses, the relative risks of dietary 
factors across cohorts might not be strictly comparable. 
This issue has been one of the main reasons for 
inconsistent fi
 ndings in dietary meta-analyses.69,70 Future 
work to encourage more pooled analyses than at present 
of diet components for all the major cohorts would be 
benefi
 cial; release of more data than available from the 
present major cohorts would stimulate various alternative 
analyses of diet, which would help strengthen the 
evidence for diet and attributable burden.
Sodium intake
Age-standardised DALYs attributable to diets high in 
sodium and exposure (as measured by SEV) for diets 
high in sodium increased slightly at the global level 
(7·2% [95% UI 0·7–19·0] for men and 4·0% [–0·3 to 
12·1] for women) from 1990 to 2015. Reduction in sodium 
intake at the population level is one of WHO’s nine 
global targets for NCDs.71 Many countries (eg, the UK, 
Finland, Japan, and Brazil) have already implemented or 
are considering implementing (eg, the USA) policies to 
reduce sodium intake.71–75 Reports from countries with 
high levels of sodium intake (eg, Japan) that have 
successfully implemented sodium reduction policies 
have argued for the benefi
 cial eff
 ects of a lowering of 
sodium intake in these populations.76 Although multiple 
lines of epidemiological evidence support the harmful 
eff
 ects of very high levels of sodium intake, no scientifi
 c 
consensus has been reached on the optimal level of 
sodium intake. In GBD 2013, on the basis of fi
 ndings of 
the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) 
collaboration on sodium and cardiovascular mortality13,77 
and to incorporate the absence of scientifi
 c consensus on 
the optimal intake of sodium, we expanded the 
uncertainty for the TMREL for sodium to 1–5 g per 
day.78–80 PURE collaborators subsequently published a 
further analysis,13 which raised the possibility that, for 
those without hypertension, an inverse relationship 
might exist between sodium intake, all-cause mortality, 
and cardiovascular events. These fi
 ndings challenge 
longstanding beliefs in the public health community

with regard to the importance of modulation of sodium 
intake at the population level. Current policy is grounded 
in the evidence that links sodium intake and systolic 
blood pressure, which shows increases in systolic blood 
pressure with increases in sodium above 1 g per day.81,82 
However, we have identifi
 ed no prospective cohort 
studies that directly link sodium to disease endpoints 
that support reductions in the risk of outcomes at levels 
of intake below 3 g per day. Proponents of a low TMREL 
for sodium have argued that the cohort studies that 
generally show rising mortality at levels below 3–5 g per 
day might have the issue of reverse causation because ill 
individuals reduce sodium consumption.83,84 Given this 
continued debate, we chose not to change the uncertainty 
range of the TMREL from the current 1–5 g per day. If 
the fi
 ndings from PURE and the pooled analysis are 
correct, an increased risk might exist for individuals 
without hypertension who consume less than 5 g per day. 
We have not included this potential increased risk in our 
quantifi
 cation of uncertainty. Many studies have been 
completed or are underway examining the eff
 ects of 
sodium reduction in population groups or whole 
communities on systolic blood pressure, but none to date 
have been done that report the eff
 ects of sodium 
reduction on disease endpoints. Such studies, when and 
if they are done, could contribute to a resolution of 
outstanding questions about the TMREL for sodium. 
Regardless of the debate on the TMREL, we found that 
sodium accounted for at least 2·0% of global DALYs in 
2015. The risk profi
 le of increasing attributable numbers 
of DALYs, and no global progress in a reduction of 
exposure to diets high in sodium, places this risk among 
those of great concern for the management of health 
systems.
Diet and policies
Much of the diet policy debate has focused on the 
importance of reductions of sodium, sugar, and fat.85,86 
Our assessment of the burden from diseases attributable 
to 14 dietary factors showed that, at the global scale, six 
factors each accounted for more than 1% of global DALYs, 
in order of importance: diets high in sodium, low in 
vegetables, low in fruit, low in whole grains, low in nuts 
and seeds, and low in seafood omega-3. Our fi
 ndings 
suggest that, in addition to a policy focus on sodium, 
sugar, and fat, many other important components of diet 
should be minimised and promoted through education, 
subsidies, and other evidence-based programmes.87 
If our fi
 ndings are correct, a policy focus on the sugar 
and fat components of diets might have a comparatively 
smaller eff
 ect than that of promotion of increased uptake 
of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and 
seafood omega-3. The disconnect between the diet policy 
debate and the evidence of which diet factors are most 
important globally can also be seen for red meat, where 
the harm of increased diabetes and colorectal cancer is 
smaller than that for all of the other 13 diet components 
considered under the GBD framework. Consideration of 
diet policy is made more complicated when cost-
eff
 ectiveness, political feasibility, intensity of implemen-
tation, reactions of various stakeholders (eg, consumers 
and the food industry), and environmental eff
 ects, 
including climate change, are factored into national diet 
policy discussions. For example, promotion of some 
components of a healthy diet (eg, milk and dairy products) 
might have deleterious eff
 ects on environmental 
sustainability. These dimensions of diet policy should be 
added to the debates on how to transform national diets 
to be lower risk than at present.
Cholesterol
On the basis of fi
 ndings from studies12 that showed the 
benefi
 ts from the reduction of LDL and total cholesterol to 
very low values, for GBD 2015, we revised the TMREL for 
total cholesterol downwards from 3·80–4·00 mmol/L to 
2·78–3·38 mmol/L. This revision increased our estimate of 
the burden of total cholesterol for the year 2010 from 
2·7 million (95% UI 1·9 million to 3·8 million) deaths in 
GBD 2013 to 4·0 million (3·1 million to 5·1 million) deaths 
in GBD 2015 and shifted our placement of cholesterol 
among leading risks from tenth (GBD 2013 ranking for the 
year 2010) to fourth (GBD 2015 ranking for the year 2010). 
Eff
 ective intervention options to infl
 uence population total 
cholesterol are available, including eff
 orts to increase 
physical activity and diet and pharmacological interventions. 
Although consumption of dietary cholesterol is not linked 
to serum cholesterol,88 dietary interventions, such as 
increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fi
 bre, and 
increased physical activity can infl
 uence LDL and total 
cholesterol89 and should be encouraged.90,91 Statins are 
highly eff
 ective, with few side-eff
 ects, justifying their use in 
many individuals, either alone or in combination with 
other medicines. In general, given the existence of proven 
and eff
 ective intervention strategies, the increase in the 
importance of cholesterol highlights a major opportunity 
for intervention.
Systolic blood pressure
In this assessment, as in GBD 2013, we found that the 
most important Level 3 risk factor globally is elevated 
systolic blood pressure. The TMREL for this estimation, a 
systolic blood pressure of between 110 mm Hg and 
115 mm Hg, is based on evidence from the pooling of 
prospective cohort studies that showed that individuals 
with a baseline blood pressure at this level have the lowest 
risk of future cardiovascular death.92,93 In addition to this 
observational evidence, two randomised clinical trials of 
blood pressure lowering have added substantially to the 
evidence in this area. Findings from the SPRINT trial10 
showed that adults in the USA with elevated vascular risk 
and pre-existing hypertension (mean systolic blood 
pressure at baseline 139·7 mm Hg and on a mean of 
1·8 medications) benefi
 ted from antihypertensive therapy 
that targeted a systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg.

Findings from the HOPE-3 trial,77 a multinational study, 
showed that older adults (aged ≥55 years) with elevated 
vascular risk but without susbtantially elevated systolic 
blood pressure (mean systolic blood pressure at baseline 
138·2 mm Hg) did not have any benefi
 t when they 
received hydrochlorothiazide 12·5 mg plus candesartan 
16 mg daily. However, neither study directly addresses 
selection of the GBD TMREL of 110–115 mm Hg since 
observational studies necessarily refl
 ect the benefi
 ts 
accrued through maintenance of a healthy blood pressure 
throughout life rather than through use of blood pressure-
lowering medications. The GBD estimate necessarily 
represents the eff
 ect of primary prevention and lifestyle 
modifi
 cation, as well as the possibility of pharmacotherapy 
for achievement of the TMREL. The large potential gain 
in global health that we estimate if an optimal blood 
pressure was to be achieved suggests that further studies 
of blood pressure in people younger than 60 years of age 
remains an important area for investigation. A wide array 
of clinical and population strategies are available to 
reduce systolic blood pressure, including lowering 
population salt intake, increasing physical activity, 
reducing or slowing the rise of high BMI, and providing 
access to eff
 ective antihypertensives, which merit 
considerable attention in many countries.
Alcohol use
We report that the global SEV for alcohol decreased by 
1·1% (95% UI –6·0 to 2·3) for men and 13·1% (–16·1 to 
–10·7) for women. Of note, however, because of the 
geographical distributions of alcohol consumption and 
background disease rates, alcohol consumption con-
tributed to an increase in alcohol attributable DALYs over 
the same period. Assessment of the burden attributable 
to alcohol is complicated by potentially elevated risks in 
former drinkers compared with abstainers, potential 
protective eff
 ects of mild-to-moderate use of alcohol, and 
use of a TMREL of zero consumption for this study. 
Findings from meta-analyses have shown considerably 
elevated relative risks in former drinkers, equivalent to 
30 g of pure alcohol per day or more for some outcomes,94,95 
although this fi
 nding could occur as a result of 
confounding by misclassifi
 cation of former drinkers as 
lifetime abstainers.96–99 Future GBD studies should 
carefully re-evaluate whether or not the excess risk in 
former drinkers is overestimated. If the relative risks for 
former drinkers have been overestimated, this over-
estimation will also aff
 ect our assessment of the alcohol 
SEV and the global trend in the SEV. The protective eff
 ect 
of mild-to-moderate alcohol use reported for ischaemic 
heart disease, diabetes in women, and reduced all-cause 
mortality is controversial;100–105 some authors argue that 
this consistent fi
 nding is due to confounding.106,107 
However, investigators of studies108 of all-cause mortality 
with certain types of quality exclusions fi
 nd no overall 
mortality benefi
 t of mild-to-moderate use. Various 
mendelian randomisation studies have contradicted 
previously claimed benefi
 ts of moderate alcohol con-
sumption for several outcomes.109–111 Marked diff
 erences 
in male and female patterns of relative risk, such as for 
diabetes,104,105 raise many questions about the biological 
pathways through which these eff
 ects might act. Finally, 
our alcohol analysis uses a TMREL of zero consumption; 
use of a higher TMREL than zero for alcohol use would 
increase our estimate of the global burden attributed to 
alcohol. Given the large burden of alcohol and the 
availability of eff
 ective options to reduce consumption at 
the population level, such as increased alcohol taxes, 
controls on outlet location and density, establishment or 
maintenance of limits on days or hours of sale, and 
screening and advice from health-care givers,112–115 
narrowing of the uncertainty in the alcohol assessment 
is important.
High BMI and fasting plasma glucose
Among the top fi
 ve Level 3 risk factors, DALYs 
attributable to high BMI increased the most from 
1990 to 2015 while SEV also increased. High BMI is 
mediated through increases in systolic blood pressure, 
cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose (methods 
appendix pp 28–35). Our decomposition analysis 
suggests that the increase in risk-attributable burden 
due to high BMI is considerably smaller than it could 
have been if underlying rates, particularly for 
cardiovascular diseases, had not declined as much as 
they did over the past decade. The decline in the 
underlying rates is likely due to expanded access to 
preventive treatment and increased quality of care.116–120 
If obesity continues to increase in the future, the 
consequences for health trends might be greater if the 
trend in underlying rates attenuates than if it continues 
to decrease. Although closely linked, we also estimate 
that the rate of increase in high fasting plasma glucose is 
slightly higher than that for obesity. The combined eff
 ect 
of rising obesity and rising fasting plasma glucose has 
consequences for various health outcomes and health-
care delivery costs. For obesity, various policy options 
have been proposed,121–123 but few, if any, strategies have 
been proven to work at the population level. Analysis of 
obesity options needs to be closely linked to consideration 
of diet and physical activity. Although for most diet 
components we have reported on the eff
 ect of diet 
composition on health outcomes, a strong argument 
exists to explore the relationship of specifi
 c diet 
components with overall BMI.
Methods strengths and challenges: uncertainty in 
causality
To move the GBD and CRA fi
 elds forward, we have 
reported, for the fi
 rst time, details of the evidence that is 
available to support the causal relationship of each risk-
outcome pair. The strength of the evidence of causality 
varies widely across risk factors. For the risk-outcome 
pairs where evidence from randomised controlled trials 
 Articles
www.thelancet.com   Vol 388   October 8, 2016 
1711
or high-quality prospective observational studies was not 
available, we considered the possibility of using other 
types of evidence, including mendelian randomisation, 
to establish causality.124 Although we have not used this 
approach in GBD 2015, this body of evidence seems to 
provide useful information that deserves a more detailed 
evaluation in future iterations of GBD than in this study. 
Likewise, the appropriate use of case-control data to 
support causality needs to be more clearly defi
 ned than 
in this study.
Being explicit about the supporting evidence also 
shows that some risks have a similar body of evidence 
supporting them, even though, in some debates, the 
strength of evidence is thought to be very diff
 erent. For 
this study, we focused on evidence mainly from 
prospective studies of exposure and disease endpoints. 
In select cases, we had to use prospective studies of 
intermediate outcomes, including trials of the eff
 ect of 
sodium on systolic blood pressure, prospective cohort 
studies of the eff
 ect of lead on systolic blood pressure, 
and trials and cohort studies of sugar-sweetened 
beverages’ eff
 ect on BMI.125–128 We did not include the 
strength of evidence uncertainty in our estimation of 
attributable burden, which requires more consensus 
than we had available on how diff
 erent types of evidence 
can be combined to support a causal connection.
Integrated exposure response curve for particulates less 
than 2·5 μg
In this study, as for GBD 2013, we have estimated the 
relative risk of exposure to particulate matter with an 
aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2·5 μm (PM2·5) 
over a broad range of daily doses by integrating relative 
risks from diverse sources of PM2·5, consisting of 
ambient air pollution, household air pollution, second-
hand smoke, and tobacco smoking, using a single 
integrated exposure response (IER) curve.129,130 The 
premise behind this approach is that PM2·5 daily dose is 
a common indicator of risk from diverse sources of 
particulate pollution. Although assessments support an 
assumption of the equitoxicity of particulate matter mass 
from diff
 erent sources for the purposes of burden 
estimation,131,132 this issue remains an area of active 
research. We expect that the IER will continue to evolve 
in response to the latest evidence in the fi
 eld of air 
pollution dose response; in keeping with the iterative 
nature of the GBD estimates, inclusion of additional 
cohort studies at lower levels of exposure to PM2·5 than 
those previously identifi
 ed and included led to a revision 
of the TMREL distribution that is less than half of the 
level used in GBD 2013. Inclusion of new high-quality 
studies and the non-linear nature of the IER curve have 
increased our estimate of global burden. Methodological 
improvements to the curve-fi
 tting algorithm that better 
capture the heterogeneity of component studies than do 
those in GBD 2013 produce UIs that are considerably 
wider than are those estimated in GBD 2013.
Future directions for GBD CRA
To date, attributable burden has been the primary metric 
that was methodologically and computationally feasible 
for GBD risk assessments. As burden forecasts become 
routinely available, quantifi
 cation of avoidable burden 
within the GBD analytic framework will become more 
tractable than at present. Development of avoidable 
burden estimates will require resolution of various 
important issues, such as the degree of reversibility for 
some risks and the type of counterfactual distribution 
most relevant to avoidable burden calculation. Arguably, 
feasible or cost-eff
 ective counterfactual distributions of 
exposure might be more relevant than is minimum risk.
In the next iterations of the GBD CRA, we plan to 
incorporate new risks into two areas: distal socioeconomic 
factors, such as educational attainment, and the absence 
of eff
 ective health interventions, such as vaccination or 
seat belts. We will assess the evidence supporting new 
risk factors for inclusion and expand the scope of the 
analysis on the basis of both the evidence for causality 
and the availability of evidence for estimation of exposure 
levels. For behavioural, environmental and occupational, 
and metabolic risks, other candidate risks have been 
proposed for inclusion in GBD, including climate 
change, smokeless tobacco, added sugar, and access to 
health care. For existing risks, we will also carefully 
assess inclusion of new risk-outcome pairs. Continued 
close examination of evidence supporting causality 
might lead to modifi
 cations of the criteria for inclusion. 
For many distal factors, such as educational attainment, 
highly consistent evidence exists from prospective 
cohorts for all-cause mortality, but the relationships for 
cause-specifi
 c mortality might vary by context; for 
example, where access to treatment might modulate the 
eff
 ects of education on an outcome. For GBD 2015, we 
have made progress clarifying the evidence base for each 
risk-outcome pair. This type of in-depth examination 
will, we hope, lead to a simpler and more transparent 
approach than has been used before to defi
 ne which risk-
outcome pairs at any level of the causal web should be 
considered convincing or probable.
Limitations
Since estimation of the attributable burden of disease 
includes estimates of deaths, YLLs, YLDs, or DALYs, the 
limitations described elsewhere for those also apply to 
this analysis.133,134  
We have developed our modelling 
strategies to quantify uncertainty given the available data. 
New data—particularly from countries where we 
currently lack data—might reveal levels of exposure that 
are outside the UIs that we have estimated. We assume 
that the joint eff
 ect for risk factors where we do not 
correct for mediation can be estimated with the multi-
plicative risk model. Although plausible, this model 
might not accurately capture how all risks interact.135 
Analyses of the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey III cohort suggest submultiplicative

eff
 ects for some risks.136 A shift from a multiplicative 
model to a submultiplicative model has profound 
implications for all aspects of risk factor epidemiology, 
beginning at the estimation of relative risks and 
extending to use of relative risks as a generalisable 
construct.
As a consequence of the absence of suffi
  cient studies 
across all risk-outcome pairs, we did not systematically 
correct relative risks for publication bias. We did not 
correct relative risks for non-masking in studies; however, 
not all risks can be studied in a masked fashion (eg, 
tobacco smoking). Comparability would be compromised 
if we corrected some risks but not others. We generally 
assumed that relative risks were uniform across countries 
for a given age-sex group.137,138 Diff
 erences in relative risks 
with geography might exist, as has been found for the 
BMI relative risk curve and TMREL, but with the exception 
of breast cancer, we fi
 nd that insuffi
  cient evidence exists 
to date to identify statistically signifi
 cant diff
 erences.
Development of robust models to estimate variation in 
SD is more diffi
  cult than for estimations of the mean. 
Because measurement error is necessarily included in 
SD from studies, they are an overestimate of the true SD. 
We did not correct SD for measurement error, with the 
exception of correction of observed systolic blood 
pressure to usual blood pressure. Measurement error 
also aff
 ects estimation of relative risks through regression 
dilution bias—the attenuation of the association between 
the level of risk and the incidence of disease outcomes. 
Because of the absence of detailed data for key cohorts, 
we have not corrected cholesterol or fasting plasma 
glucose relative risks for regression dilution bias. Our 
approach of estimation of the maximum relative risk on 
the basis of the reported cohorts and trials might 
underestimate burden if risk continues to rise at the 
highest levels of exposure beyond those reported. 
Although a log-linear function for relative risks and levels 
of exposure is adequate for the observed range of 
exposure, available data on the most extreme values are 
few. Given that a very small fraction of the population in 
any country is in these extreme exposure levels, the 
potential bias in our estimates is minimal. Additionally, 
estimation of burden for risks divided into polytomous 
risks might underestimate their burden compared with 
estimation of burden with a continuous risk variable.
Although use of a log-normal distribution is the best 
of the parametric distributions that we have assessed for 
fasting plasma glucose, important deviations from the 
log-normal exist in survey data such as from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We 
have explored diff
 erent mixtures of distributions, 
including two log-normal or a normal and log-normal, 
some of which provided better overall fi
 t than the one 
that we used. However, we have so far not been able to 
solve the optimisation problem of estimation of two 
distributions given only a mean and SD reported from 
particular studies.
We did not use the relative risk and exposure PAF 
calculation for unsafe sex, HIV risk from injecting drug 
use, and occupational injuries; we used direct evidence 
of the attributable fraction. Comparability of the results 
derived from these direct or categorical approaches to the 
risks estimated with the relative risk and exposure model 
is not certain.
Too few studies exist to allow estimation of the 
contribution of household air pollution to ambient air 
pollution or vice versa.139 As a consequence, we might 
have underestimated the burden of household air 
pollution as a single risk factor; we might also have 
overestimated the burden of air pollution combined. 
Furthermore, our analysis of ambient air pollution has 
focused on PM2·5; other pollutants, including larger 
particulates than PM2·5 and nitrogen dioxide, might 
also be important to quantify. For cholesterol, we 
established our estimates of burden using total 
cholesterol; however, increasing evidence supporting the 
eff
 ects of LDL cholesterol—and improvements in data 
availability for serum LDL in diff
 erent populations—
suggest future estimations of risk from high cholesterol 
should use LDL cholesterol as the unit of estimation.
Proxies for exposure to some risk factors are coarse, 
which is particularly the case for zinc defi
 ciency, for which 
we estimated the balance between theoretical intake and 
physiological requirements from Food and Agriculture 
Organization food balance sheets for absorbable zinc. 
Although zinc defi
 ciency can be estimated from the 
proportion of people estimated to have inadequate zinc 
intake, individual-level measurement of exposure truly 
needed to estimate the number of people at risk is not 
available. In a similar fashion, we used the proportion of 
the population in coarse occupational categories as a proxy 
for exposure to specifi
 c carcinogens and used fuel type as 
a proxy for household air pollution. Our ability to capture 
geographical variation and uncertainty in conversion of 
household solid fuel use to PM2·5 exposure improved the 
validity of our fi
 ndings and UIs. Use of direct PM2·5 
exposure measurement in households would be preferable 
to calibrate the widely available data for fuel use; however, 
such data have rarely been collected. As with all previous 
studies, we assessed the burden attributable to the 
availability of water and sanitation infrastructure, not the 
use of the infrastructure. Exposure for these risks has 
been defi
 ned in terms of availability and not use because 
that is what household surveys have collected. Our 
estimates are not biased, however, by this limitation 
because we derived relative risks from similar exposure 
defi
 nitions. Finally, we have not estimated intimate 
partner violence for men because of a scarcity of evidence 
of the health eff
 ects among men.
Conclusion
Quantifi
 cation of the health eff
 ects of a diverse set of 
largely avoidable risks is an important input into any 
national or global strategy to improve population health

and make progress towards the Sustainable Development 
Goals. For the fi
 rst time, we have been able to separately 
assess and report trends in risk exposure and decompose 
trends in attributable burden into the contribution of 
demographic change, risk exposure, and risk-deleted 
rates. Reductions in some risks strongly associated with 
low levels of development, such as poor water, poor 
sanitation, household air pollution, and undernutrition, 
have been important contributors to global progress. 
Some crucial risks for NCDs, particularly obesity, high 
fasting plasma glucose, and alcohol, are increasing. 
Deleterious trends have had a smaller eff
 ect than 
expected because of favourable declines in risk-deleted 
DALY rates for many causes, a component of which 
might be due to access to eff
 ective health care. In an era 
of rapid transition in societies and levels of health, 
tracking of and response to key risks will require constant 
monitoring at the local level. As the set of risk factors 
expands to encompass access to specifi
 c health-care 
interventions in future iterations of GBD, the GBD CRA 
will provide an even more comprehensive understanding 
than in this study of the drivers of health improvement 
and how they relate to the operation and priorities of 
health systems.
