Purpose. Best practices and guidance are provided for improved elec-
tronic detection and alerting of inadvertent supratherapeutic cumulative 
doses of acetaminophen and other medications with narrow therapeutic 
ranges in inpatient settings. 
Summary. Despite the use of medication safety technologies, overdosage 
and associated sentinel events continue to be serious problems in many 
inpatient settings. The tools needed to monitor and employ dose alerts, 
accumulators, and warning systems are available to reduce inadvertent 
overdose. Required are staff training and the implementation of processes 
that provide guidance and documentation of the drug reconciliation proc-
ess from admittance to discharge for safe patient passage through the 
various transitions of care. Recommendations to achieve optimal patient 
safety outcomes include the adoption and integration of available tech-
nologies with full functionality configured to meet the institution’s policies 
and processes, initial training and retraining of all staff who use these sys-
tems, continuing education of the patient care staff on the dosing safety 
requirements, and assigning a prominent role to the clinical pharmacist in 
the entire drug-use and reconciliation process. 
Conclusion. The key factors contributing to inadvertent overdosage in 
inpatient settings include a lack of recognition of recommended maximum 
daily dosages; failure to optimally communicate medication information at 
transitions of care; failure to optimally implement medication safety tech-
nologies, particularly dose accumulator calculation features and associ-
ated alerts; and alert fatigue and override.

Introduction
Since publication of version 1.0 
of NCPDP Recommendations for Im-
proved Prescription Container Labels 
for Medicines Containing Acetamino-
phen in May 2011, collaborative efforts 
among all key stakeholders have result-
ed in significantly improved pharmacy 
container labeling of acetaminophen-
containing prescription medicines. 
Publication of version 1.1 provided ad-
ditional guidance to facilitate their ef-
forts for ensuring full implementation 
of the National Council for Prescrip-
tion Drug Programs (NCPDP) recom-
mendations in order to improve safe 
and appropriate use of acetaminophen 
by the public. Tremendous strides have 
been made in the adoption of these 
best practice recommendations.
With this white paper, focus is 
shifted to mitigating the risk of acet-
aminophen overdose in the inpa-
tient setting through use of available 
functionality inherent in hospital and 
nursing facility patient management 
and electronic medication systems. 
The principles described for mitigat-
ing the risk of inadvertent overdosage 
are expected to apply to other drugs 
with narrow therapeutic ranges in the 
inpatient setting.

istration, and recording in the medi-
cation administration record (MAR). 
Monitoring for therapeutic dupli-
cation in the patient’s medication 
regimen (e.g., simultaneous use of 
multiple acetaminophen-containing 
products) and for appropriateness 
of the dose are key elements in the 
medication-use system.
Drug database publishers and 
pharmacy system vendors state that 
currently available technology sup-
ports drug dose alerts and accumula-
tor calculation applications for drugs 
with narrow therapeutic margins, in-
cluding acetaminophen. Technology 
barriers that could prevent or restrict 
hospital implementation include sub-
optimal integration of hospital and 
pharmacy systems, lack of or inad-
equate CDS interfaces, insufficient 
data supporting the need for the tech-
nology and benefit for patient safety, 
and decision support alert fatigue that 
prompts override and a lost opportu-
nity to prevent medication errors.
Some of the technologic problems 
stem from regulatory mandates that 
impact budgetary decisions. Mean-
ingful use (using certified electronic 
health record [EHR] technology) and 
the Affordable Care Act (ACA) incen-
tivized the adoption of technology 
by providing both funding for EHR 
adoption and fiscal penalties for non-
compliance. The tendency was to 
budget to meet minimum compliance 
requirements and, once met, to con-
sider additional funding to implement 
optional functionality and upgrades 
as unnecessary, even though lack of 
this functionality might negatively af-
fect patient safety and outcomes.
Inpatient transitions of care in-
clude clinical handoffs between differ-
ent levels of care and settings within 
the hospital and also between the hos-
pital, LTC facility, rehabilitation facili-
ties, and discharge to ambulatory care. 
Medication reconciliation, the process 
overview of a patient’s medication or-
ders, can prevent medication errors 
by capturing duplications, omissions, 
and discontinuations and serve as the 
basis for an optimized treatment plan 
Based on the background and 
studies cited in this white paper, it is 
apparent that patient safety in the in-
patient setting associated with the ad-
ministration of acetaminophen carries 
many of the same risks as experiences 
observed with acetaminophen use in 
the outpatient setting. Importantly, 
lack of knowledge about maximum 
recommended daily dosages and fail-
ure to recognize duplicate therapy 
contribute to inadvertent acetamino-
phen overdosage in the inpatient set-
ting, just as they do in the outpatient 
setting. While the inpatient hospital 
setting is a much better controlled en-
vironment for patient treatment than 
the outpatient environment, inadver-
tent overdoses still occur.
Studies presented indicate evi-
dence of supratherapeutic dosing of 
acetaminophen among patients in 
hospitals and long-term care (LTC) 
facilities. This prompted a review of 
the inpatient medication-use process, 
clinical decision support (CDS) and 
information systems available, and 
technology capability for monitoring 
dosage accumulation in order to
• 
Further understand the risks associ-
ated with inpatient transitions of 
care
• 
Identify the hospital, skilled nursing, 
and other LTC facility discharge 
processes for education
• 
Develop guidance for prevention
and, in the end, identify recommen-
dations to reduce or eliminate aceta-
minophen supratherapeutic dosing in 
the inpatient setting.
The medication-use system is de-
fined as the provision of medication 
by the pharmacy to patient care units 
and ultimately administration to the 
patient. The process includes various 
activities, including key ones where 
best practices should be applied 
to minimize the risk of inadvertent 
acetaminophen overdosage. Those 
activities include product selection, 
appropriate prescribing and phar-
macist evaluation of the order, drug 
verification at dispensing and admin-
based on the current patient status. 
This patient safety function is best 
provided by the clinical pharmacy 
staff. Upon admission, medication 
reconciliation is used to clarify and 
verify the patient’s medication list 
from family or outpatient pharmacy 
database. During each transition 
of care, documented medication 
updates per patient status should 
be routine. The discharge process 
should include comparison of admis-
sion medications and changes during 
the admission and discharge orders. 
Medication reconciliation within the 
transition of care provides an up-
dated medication list to outpatient 
treatment providers, pharmacies, and 
caregivers and also provides an op-
portunity for safe use counseling.
As this white paper will elucidate, 
the key factors contributing to inad-
vertent acetaminophen overdosage in 
inpatient settings include
• 
Simultaneous use of multiple  
acetaminophen-containing products,
• 
Lack of recognition of recommend-
ed maximum daily dosages of  
acetaminophen,
• 
Lack of recognition that acetamino-
phen is the principal cause of acute 
liver failure in the United States,
• 
Failure to optimally communicate 
medication information at transi-
tions of care,
• 
Failure to optimally implement medi-
cation safety technologies, particu-
larly dose accumulator calculation 
features and associated alerts, and
• 
Alert fatigue and override.

2. Purpose and problem
The purpose of this white paper is 
to provide best practices and guidance 
for improved detection and alerting of 
cumulative daily doses of acetamin-
ophen and other medications with 
narrow therapeutic margins that ap-
proach or exceed recommended max-
imum levels in inpatient and skilled 
nursing and other LTC facility settings 
using electronic systems. In addition, 
this white paper provides best prac-
tices and guidance aimed at reducing 
the risk of inadvertent acetaminophen 
overdosage that could occur during 
clinical handoffs, such as between 
units or departments and care transi-
tions such as from the inpatient to 
ambulatory care setting, in particu-
lar, as a result of duplicate or additive 
acetaminophen-containing therapy 
(e.g., analgesic combinations). While 
the focus of this paper is prevention of 
acetaminophen overdose, the recom-
mendations are meant to be applied 
to any medication where strict moni-
toring of dosage limits is critical for 
the patient’s well-being.
2.1 Inpatient overdosage
Several recent studies have docu-
mented the problem of suprath-
erapeutic acetaminophen dosing in 
hospitalized patients, despite poli-
cies and procedures to monitor and 
control acetaminophen exposure, and 
the failure of existing systems, includ-
ing CPOE, to adequately prevent this 
problem.1-7 In fact, such overdosage 
can occur despite the presence of ro-
bust decision support alerts to detect 
inappropriately high ordered dosages 
and duplicate therapies.1,3,7 Regularly 
scheduled (standing-order rather than 
as-needed [prn]) administration, use of 
multiple 
acetaminophen-containing 
medication formulations, and use of 
multiple- or single-ingredient products 
with 500 mg or more of acetamino-
phen were associated with the high-
est risk of inadvertent overdosage.1,4 
Surgical units and intensive care units 
(ICUs) also were associated with in-
creased risk.1,4,8
The vast majority of inpatients do 
not appear to be at risk of acetamino-
phen overdosage despite such poten-
tial failures, at least in teaching hospi-
tals1,4,9; however, the consequences of 
hepatotoxicity associated with aceta-
minophen overdosage, should it occur, 
are serious and potentially life threat-
ening.10,11 Therefore, steps should be 
taken to minimize the risk of inadver-
tent overdosage in inpatient settings. 
In addition, despite apparent individ-
ual variations in maximum tolerated 
acetaminophen dosages and the in-
ability to establish a specific threshold 
dose for toxicity,10 the current standard 
recommended maximum dosage of 4 g 
daily should be applied for inpatients 
just as it is for ambulatory patients.9,11,12 
In some cases (e.g., the elderly, patients 
with chronic liver diseases), even lower 
maximum dosages (e.g., 3 g daily) may 
be warranted.1
2.2 Cumulative daily dose 
calculation
While robust algorithms for cal-
culating cumulative daily acetamin-
ophen doses from any product ex-
posure and subsequently triggering 
associated alerts have been suggested 
as important safeguards for prevent-
ing inadvertent overdosage in hospi-
talized patients,1,2,4 alert fatigue and 
override as well as unfamiliarity with 
maximum 
recommended 
dosages 
may be contributing factors to the fail-
ure of such safeguards.1,2 Healthcare 
providers often ignore alerts and deci-
sion support rules that are embedded 
in electronic systems.4 In addition, the 
American Society of Health-System 
Pharmacists (ASHP) 2013 national 
survey on informatics found that only 
about half of U.S. hospitals employing 
CDS-enabled CPOE systems actually 
calculate cumulative daily doses.13 Im-
portantly, about 90% of U.S. hospitals 
employed BCMA systems in 2014.14 
BCMA has been suggested as a more 
fail-safe intervention at preventing in-
advertent acetaminophen overdosage 
because it is less prone to override.3
Failure to appropriately customize 
and monitor computerized systems 
such as CPOE and CDS also contrib-
utes to nonachievement of desired 
safety benefits.4,7 The importance of 
such customization and monitoring 
for ensuring that safety outcomes 
are achieved is reinforced by recom-
mendations from the National Qual-
ity Forum (NQF) and meaningful-use 
requirements under the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act.4,7,15,16 
The Leapfrog CPOE evaluation tool 
has been recommended as an inde-
pendent, inexpensive, standardized 
tool for estimating the potential ben-
efit of a hospital’s CPOE system by 
testing how it performs in addressing 
a variety of dangerous medication-
ordering scenarios.7,17
In a recent application of the 
 
Leapfrog tool in hospitals, shortcom-
ings of CPOE systems principally 
resulted from failures related to ex-
cessive dosing, either by therapeutic 
duplication or by exceeding dosing 
limits, and acetaminophen alone and 
in combination with other drugs were 
by far the most commonly responsible 
products.7 Unfortunately, the focus 
of recent EHR certification criteria 
and associated financial incentives 
on drug–drug interaction and drug-
allergy alerts15,16 may have diverted at-
tention away from drug dosing alerts 
as an important safety performance 
measure in CDS.
2.3 Transitions of care
Effective transitions of care are im-
portant factors in reducing medica-
tion errors.18-23 Patients can experience 
medication errors any time they un-
dergo a transition in care. Transitions 
of care include changes in patient loca-
tion, provider, or both, such as13,18,19,22
• 
Between inpatient (e.g., hospital, 
LTC, rehabilitation) and ambulatory 
care locations,

• 
Between different levels of inpatient 
care and settings, and
• 
Between different care providers.
Complicating effective transitions of 
care is the trend of inpatient care in-
creasingly being provided by hospi-
talists rather than primary care pro-
viders.13,24,25 Approximately 50–70% 
of hospital-related medication errors 
and 20% of all adverse drug events 
(ADEs) are attributed to poor com-
munication at transitions and inter-
faces of care.13,24,26-28
 In addition, the 
Joint Commission has reported that 
22% of medication reconciliation 
failures occur during patient admis-
sion and 12% occur at the time of 
discharge.28 However, several studies 
have reported that medication dis-
crepancies occur more commonly 
during discharge, with error rates in 
these studies ranging from about 40% 
to 60% of discharged patients.23
The Joint Commission, Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 
and others have published recommen-
dations for optimizing medication rec-
onciliation and avoiding medication 
errors at transitions of care, including 
when a patient changes service, set-
ting, provider, or level of care within 
or outside an organization.13,22,24,26-30 
Medication reconciliation is an integral 
part of clinical information reconcilia-
tion and a key objective in CMS’s stage 
2 meaningful-use objectives and EHR 
incentive programs for eligible profes-
sionals, eligible hospitals, and critical 
access hospitals in 2015–2017, and was 
to continue with stage 3 meaningful 
use in 2018.22 Thus, medication recon-
ciliation applies across the continuum 
of care, including inpatient, ambu-
latory, emergency and urgent care, 
LTC, and homecare and focuses on 
assisting providers in their direct pa-
tient care and on improving the accu-
racy of information provided to others 
through health information exchange 
(HIE).22,23,28-30
Duplication of therapy, a common 
problem with inadvertent acetamin-
ophen overdose, and prescribing the 
right drug but at high dosage can re-
sult in medication-related problems 
at care transitions.18
 Opioid analge-
sics, which often contain acetamino-
phen, are among the most common 
classes of drugs requiring intervention 
at transitions of care to prevent medi-
cation errors.
2.4 Impact of i.v. 
acetaminophen therapy
The introduction of i.v. acetamin-
ophen into the inpatient setting has 
raised new concerns about poten-
tial inadvertent overdosage of the 
drug.12,31 Although i.v. acetaminophen 
at recommended dosage is considered 
reasonably safe, particularly under 
close safety monitoring in the hospital 
setting,9,12,31 its potential concomitant 
use with opioids to treat postopera-
tive pain could result in inadvertent 
overdosage if oral opioid combina-
tions containing acetaminophen were 
also used.12,31 Acetaminophen alone is 
not effective for treating severe post-
operative pain, making concomitant 
opioid therapy likely,12 and surgi-
cal units have been associated with 
an increased risk of acetaminophen 
overdosage.1 Therefore, the labeling 
for i.v. acetaminophen carries a warn-
ing about concomitant use with other 
acetaminophen-containing products 
to help reduce the risk of inadvertent 
overdosage.12,31 In determining accu-
mulated daily dose of acetaminophen, 
all routes of administration (i.v., oral, 
and rectal) must be included in the 
calculation.31
The fact that interoperable com-
munication between point-of-care 
activated devices (e.g., i.v. infusion 
pumps) and CPOE and EHR systems 
may not be optimal should be con-
sidered in developing procedures for 
ensuring global dosage calculation for 
all routes of acetaminophen admin-
istration. In 2014, about 90% of U.S. 
hospitals used point-of-care activated 
small-volume parenteral products.14 
In addition, procedures should be in 
place to ensure that i.v. acetaminophen 
is prescribed, prepared, and adminis-
tered properly; that i.v. infusion pumps 
are properly programmed; and that 
milligram and milliliter units are not 
inadvertently confused in calculating 
accumulated acetaminophen doses.
2.5 Education of healthcare 
professionals
Educating healthcare profession-
als about the risks of acetaminophen 
use, particularly those associated with 
exceeding maximum recommended 
daily doses, and changing hospital 
policies to reduce risk factors for ex-
cessive dosing are key elements in pre-
venting inadvertent overdosage.1,32 Be-
cause the goal of preventing excessive 
acetaminophen dosing should be as 
a “never event,” one method that has 
been recommended for prevention 
is to engineer a process and embed 
it into electronic systems (e.g., CDS, 
CPOE, EHR, medication administra-
tion technology) such that it creates 
hard stops that prevent ordering and 
administration of daily doses exceed-
ing 4 g32 or 75 mg/kg in patients weigh-
ing less than 50 kg.31,32 In doing so, the 
tendency of clinicians to ignore alerts 
and embedded decision support rules 
also should be addressed.7,32
3. Research
Acetaminophen is widely and ef-
fectively used in both prescription 
and over-the-counter (OTC) medica-
tions to relieve pain and reduce fever. 
It is one of the most commonly used 
medicines in the United States.33-39 It 
is found in more than 500 different 
prescription and OTC medicines.40 Al-
though acetaminophen and hydroco-
done combinations had been the most 
widely prescribed drug in the United 
States for many years,36,37 they recently 
fell to second place behind levothyrox-
ine,37 mainly because of the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) phased 
withdrawal of high-dose (greater than 
325 mg) acetaminophen-containing 
combinations.36
When used as directed, acetamin-
ophen has a well-established rec-
ord of safety and efficacy.38 Aceta-
minophen often is recommended 
for certain patient populations, since 
it is considered to be a “safer” al-

ternative as it lacks the adverse ef-
fects (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, 
 
opioid-induced respiratory depres-
sion, other bleeding) of other analgesic 
medications—namely the nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and opioid analgesics.1,38 Despite this, 
however, acetaminophen is the lead-
ing cause of acute liver failure.38,39,41-43 
Exceeding the maximum daily dose 
 
(4 g daily) can place a patient at risk 
for severe liver injury.38 Recent analy-
sis of the National Poison Data System 
of the American Association of Poison 
Control Centers suggests a dispropor-
tionate increase in acetaminophen-
associated hepatic injury with the 
misuse and abuse of opioid combi-
nation products, likely secondary to 
increased self-dosage for the opioid 
effect without regard to concomitant 
acetaminophen dosage.38,39
In a U.S.-based Internet survey, 
4.5% of acetaminophen users exceed-
ed 4 g daily for one or more days.44 
Patients who exceeded 4 g daily were 
characterized by chronic pain, poor 
physical status, and heavy use of med-
ical care.
3.1 Hospital studies and 
findings
Several studies found similar in-
stances of supratherapeutic acetamin-
ophen dosing in inpatient settings, de-
spite policies and procedures aimed at 
monitoring and controlling acetamin-
ophen exposure.1-6 Acetaminophen-
containing products are some of the 
most widely prescribed drugs in in-
patients, with more than 60% of adult 
patients receiving the analgesic in one 
study of two tertiary care hospitals.1
Risk factors associated with supra-
therapeutic acetaminophen dosing in 
hospital inpatients include1-6
• 
Orders for multiple acetaminophen-
containing products
• 
Acetaminophen products contain-
ing 500 mg or more
• 
Regularly scheduled rather than 
“prn” dosing
• 
Higher number of doses per day
• 
Higher dose per administration
• 
Older age
• 
Chronic liver disease
• 
Diagnosis of osteoarthritis
• 
Surgical or ICU care
• 
Gaps in optimal implementation of 
medication safety technologies
In a retrospective review, aceta-
minophen use was examined in hos-
pitalized patients in two academic 
tertiary care settings in an effort to 
identify factors that contributed to 
supra 
therapeutic acetaminophen dos-
es.1 In this study, 23,750 patients who 
were at least 12 years of age were evalu-
ated. Of these, 14,411 patients received 
acetaminophen and comprised the 
study population. Patient exposure to 
acetaminophen was obtained from the 
hospitals’ electronic MAR (eMAR) sys-
tem. Each record included medication 
name, strength, dose, route, admin-
istration time, instructions, admin-
istering hospital unit (e.g., ICU), and 
other information. Supratherapeutic 
acetaminophen dosing was defined as 
any cumulative administration of 4 g 
or more of the drug daily. Secondary 
analysis of patients who were 65 years 
of age or older and those with chronic 
liver disease was performed using a 
3-g daily threshold.
Of the 14,411 patients in this study, 
6.6% (955) exceeded the 4 g/day limit 
of acetaminophen therapy.1 In addi-
tion, 22.4% of patients 65 years of age 
or older and 17.6% of patients with 
chronic liver disease received dos-
ages exceeding 3 g/day. Overall, there 
was a 4% rate (955/23,750) of supra-
therapeutic dosing in all hospitalized 
patients. In addition, almost half of 
those receiving supratherapeutic dos-
ing actually received greater than 5 g 
of acetaminophen daily, 40% received 
supratherapeutic dosing for 3 days or 
longer, and 10% received suprathera-
peutic dosing for 10 days or longer. Av-
eraged over the entire hospital stays, 
supratherapeutic acetaminophen dos-
ing was associated with more adminis-
trations per day and a higher dose per 
administration.
Factors that placed patients at 
higher risk for exceeding the maxi-
mum recommended dose in this study 
included older age, chronic liver dis-
ease, white (Caucasian), a diagnosis 
of osteoarthritis, regularly scheduled 
rather than “prn” administration, use 
of multiple acetaminophen-containing 
product formulations, including formu-
lations with 500 mg or more of the drug, 
and administration in surgical units and 
ICUs.1 Medicine and other units were 
associated with a lower risk. Of patients 
who received three or more different 
acetaminophen-containing formula-
tions, about 21% received suprathera-
peutic doses.
The authors concluded that hospi-
tal policy and prescriber training are 
warranted to help clinicians identify 
acetaminophen-containing products 
and closely monitor acetaminophen 
cumulative daily doses.1 A decision 
support system implementing liver 
toxicity warnings displayed at or-
der entry and during administration 
was suggested to mitigate the risks 
of supratherapeutic acetaminophen 
dosing. However, more judicious dis-
play of alerts might be more effective 
because of the risk of alert fatigue. 
In addition, because the practice of 
regularly scheduled analgesic dosing 
(to avoid peaks and troughs of analge-
sia) is considered more effective than 
as-needed dosing for pain manage-
ment, long-standing acetaminophen 
dosing practices involving products 
containing 500 mg or more should be 
reassessed because of the low margin 
of error when regimens of 1 g every 6 
hours are employed. Fortunately, opi-
oid combinations containing more 
than 325 mg of acetaminophen per 
dose are no longer available in the 
United States,36 although single-
ingredient products are still available. 
Special attention also should be paid 
to osteoarthritis patients, particularly 
since acetaminophen is recommend-
ed as initial therapy for many forms of 
the disease and the increased risk of 
supratherapeutic dosing observed in 
this study.1

ministration in excess of 4 g daily on

at least one calendar day was deter-
mined in an academic tertiary care 
setting.4,8 During the study period, 
43,761 admissions were included in 
the analysis during which at least one 
dose of an acetaminophen-containing 
medication was dispensed. Of these 
admissions, 2.6% (1119) of patients 
received more than 4 g of acetamin-
ophen daily on at least one calendar 
day. Doses that patients actually re-
ceived were recorded via the eMAR 
system. The authors concluded that 
patients receiving a larger number 
of acetaminophen-containing medi-
cations were at greater risk of su-
pratherapeutic dosing and therefore 
questioned the use of acetaminophen-
containing combination products in 
inpatient settings. Because of the pre-
scriber control over medication orders 
in the inpatient setting, the benefit of 
ordering combination formulations of 
acetaminophen and opioids versus 
ordering the component medications 
separately is purely a matter of conve-
nience, but one that is associated with 
an increased risk of supratherapeutic 
dosing.8 Other risk factors included 
slightly older age, shorter lengths 
of stay, and admission to a surgi-
cal service (especially orthopedics).8 
The authors further concluded that 
patient safety could be improved by 
implementing additional safeguards 
to prevent excessive acetaminophen 
dosage.8 One such safeguard would be 
an automated computer-based pro-
gram that tabulates a patient’s cumu-
lative acetaminophen dose and fires 
an alert (e.g., as part of orders entered 
through a CPOE system) when the 
recommended maximum would be 
exceeded.4,8
These and other studies have dem-
onstrated that several risk factors can 
increase the likelihood of hospital-
ized patients being given suprathera-
peutic doses of acetaminophen.1-6,8 
These risk factors include (but are not 
limited to) being admitted to a surgi-
cal service, having a shorter length of 
hospital stay, being ordered multiple 
acetaminophen-containing products, 
advanced age (65 years and older), 
having chronic pain conditions (e.g., 
osteoarthritis), regularly scheduled 
administration versus a “prn” basis, 
and using formulations containing 
500 mg or more of acetaminophen 
versus 325 mg of the drug.
Because of the challenge of cli-
nicians keeping track of cumulative 
acetaminophen doses from multiple 
products over 24-hour periods, which 
is exacerbated by clinical patient 
handoffs, effective CDS is needed to 
mitigate the risk of overdosage.1,5,8,11 
Unfortunately, only about half of U.S. 
hospitals were using CDS-enabled 
CPOE that calculated total daily dos-
es of drugs in 2013, although almost 
70% of certain hospitals stratified by 
bedside calculated total daily dos-
es.13 Only about 30% of U.S. hospitals 
calculated cumulative lifetime doses 
in 2013.13
When evaluated using an inde-
pendent, standardized tool from the 
 
Leapfrog Group, CPOE systems from 
several small- to medium-sized com-
munity hospitals yielded evidence 
of the failure of these systems to ad-
equately reduce the rates of prevent-
able ADEs using a standardized per-
formance tool.7 Of these ADEs, most 
were related to excessive dosing, either 
by therapeutic duplication or exceed-
ing dosing limits, and the most fre-
quent offenders were acetaminophen, 
acetaminophen-containing multiple-
ingredient products, and opioids, ac-
counting for 30%, 24%, and 7.4% of all 
events, respectively.
3.2 LTC studies and findings
Approximately 25–50% of older 
adults residing in LTC facilities expe-
rience pain; however, fewer than half 
of LTC residents with pain receive 
routinely scheduled pain medication 
or special services for pain manage-
ment.45 Pain is a commonly under-
treated condition in older adults, 
particularly in residents with hospice 
and/or palliative care needs46; age ex-
ceeding 70 years is the greatest risk 
factor.47 Inadequate pain control can 
result in depression, anxiety, impaired 
ambulation, decreased socialization, 
sleep disturbances, and increased 
healthcare utilization.48
According to the 2009 American 
Geriatrics Society pain guidelines, 
acetaminophen is recommended as 
a first-line agent in the treatment of 
persistent pain in older adults.49 It is 
contraindicated for use in liver fail-
ure and has relative contraindications 
for use in patients with hepatic insuf-
ficiency and chronic alcohol abuse 
or dependency. The usual maximum 
recommended daily dosage is 4 g from 
all acetaminophen sources, including 
combination products.
Acetaminophen use in older adults 
generally is well tolerated and ef-
ficacious for musculoskeletal pain, 
including osteoarthritis and lower 
back pain.49 In comparison with other 
non-opioid pain medications, such as 
NSAIDs, acetaminophen is not associ-
ated with significant gastrointestinal, 
renal, or cardiovascular toxicities.
There are several important safety 
concerns when prescribing aceta-
minophen in an LTC setting. In older 
adults, decreased activity of phase I 
conjugation reactions in the liver has 
been associated with decreased acet-
aminophen clearance, especially in 
frail adults who are unable to care for 
themselves.50 This pharmacokinetic 
change could result in higher aceta-
minophen drug concentrations and 
increase the risk for adverse events 
with cumulative doses. Although the 
clinical effects of these age-related 
changes remain to be more fully eluci-
dated, caution should be taken when 
prescribing acetaminophen to frail 
LTC residents.
While pharmacists monitor medi-
cation use in an LTC setting, there is a 
concern when OTC acetaminophen-
containing 
products 
(e.g., 
com-
bination cold, pain/fever, allergy 
products) are used without a recom-
mendation from an LTC provider. 
Daily ingestion exceeding 4 g may 
result in an overdose and is a con-
cern in this setting. Patient education 
on acetaminophen sources, maxi-
mum daily dose limits, and signs and 
symptoms of hepatotoxicity are key

in preventing acetaminophen misuse 
and overdose.
Alcohol is commonly used in 
persons 65 years of age or older.51 In 
nursing homes, the rate of alcohol 
use varies from 8% to 46%.52 Regu-
lar alcohol use and/or abuse will 
increase the formation rate of ac-
etaminophen’s toxic metabolite, 
n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone, thus in-
creasing the risk for hepatotoxicity.53 In 
older adults with hepatic insufficiency 
or known regular alcohol use and/or 
abuse, an acetaminophen dose limit 
of 1–2 g daily is recommended.49
When considering other opioid 
and non-opioid medications, aceta-
minophen is usually the “best” choice 
as a first-line agent to treat mild per-
sistent pain; however, medications 
should ideally be used in combina-
tion with other non-pharmacologic 
interventions (e.g., physical therapy, 
meditation, biofeedback). Although 
acetaminophen is generally well tol-
erated by older adults, it is important 
to consider the potential safety risks 
of using this medication in an LTC 
setting. Patient education regarding 
potential harm is essential in pre-
venting acetaminophen misuse and 
abuse.
4. Background and current 
state
Publication of NCPDP Recom-
mendations for Improved Prescription 
Container Labels for Medicines Con-
taining Acetaminophen, version 1.0, 
in May 2011 elucidated the clinical 
findings regarding acetaminophen 
overdose and the need for complete-
ly spelling out acetaminophen and 
the presence of warning labels ad-
dressing liver damage and concomi-
tant use with other acetaminophen-
containing products on prescription 
container labels.38 These recommen-
dations aligned with FDA recommen-
dations for OTC products contain-
ing acetaminophen. The subsequent 
white paper, version 1.1, published in 
January 2015,38 provided a review of 
stakeholder response and made rec-
ommendations for further action.
4.1 Interventions and 
initiatives
NCPDP
, in its original white paper 
on improved acetaminophen pre-
scription container labels,38 as well as 
FDA and other stakeholders, has put 
in place or is currently exploring sev-
eral interventions to help lower the 
risk of acetaminophen suprathera-
peutic ingestion. These include
• 
Educational initiatives
• 
Teaching patients and consum-
ers about acetaminophen as an 
ingredient in many prescrip-
tion and OTC medications and 
the importance of not using 
more than one acetaminophen-
containing medication at any time
• 
Promoting the importance of 
reading and following the medi-
cation labels of acetaminophen-
containing products
• 
Raising awareness of the risks 
associated with acetaminophen 
overdose
• 
Instructing patients about their 
own role in medication safety, 
particularly the importance of 
maintaining updated medication  
information/lists, the need to 
share this information with 
primary caregivers, and the 
importance of always carrying 
it with them in the event of an 
emergency30
• 
Educating healthcare providers 
about the hepatotoxic risk of 
acetaminophen and the im-
portance of not exceeding the 
recommended daily doses of 
the drug. Importantly, they also 
should be educated about the 
need to consider the cumula-
tive doses that could result from 
simultaneous use of multiple 
acetaminophen-containing 
products, including the many 
formulations of analgesic, cold 
and cough, sleep aid, and other 
combinations that include 
acetaminophen
• 
Formulation changes limiting the 
amount of acetaminophen con-
tained in oral prescription combi-
nation pain relievers to 325 mg per 
dose
• 
Addressing health literacy issues on 
medicine labels containing acet-
aminophen in a patient-centered 
way
• 
Changes to pharmacy-generated 
prescription container labels and to 
outpatient e-prescribing and inpa-
tient CPOE systems to remove the 
abbreviation APAP and fully spell out 
acetaminophen
• 
Exploring the use of an acetamino-
phen label icon that can serve as a 
global indicator of the presence of 
acetaminophen in medications with 
the goal of improving awareness of 
acetaminophen as an active ingredi-
ent and to help prevent the use of 
multiple acetaminophen-containing 
products54,55

4.2 Healthcare environment 
In recent years, healthcare pro-
viders have been faced with many 
initiatives aimed at increasing pa-
tient engagement, increasing the use 
of technology—especially for elec-
tronic communication and records 
and for automation of functions—
improving patient outcomes, and 
controlling costs.7,13,14,22,56,57 In addi-
tion, there has been a steady move 
from sick care (hospital focus) to a 
greater focus on disease prevention 
and wellness programs.
Legislative and regulatory policies 
have placed increased emphasis on en-
hanced technology, particularly use of 
EHRs, and incentivized providers with 
pay-for-performance measures.13,22 As 
part of their medication-use process, 
hospitals typically employ various 
medication safety technologies, in-
cluding CPOE, CDS, and various types 
of medication administration (e.g., 
BCMA systems, eMAR systems).7,13,14,22 
CDS is employed to generate interrup-
tive alerts, notifications, and explicit 
care suggestions.22 Other technologies 
employed to optimize pharmacy prac-
tice models in hospitals include au-
tomated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) 
and robotic systems.13,14 Combined, 
these technologies are employed to 
optimize medication therapy man-
agement and safety and to improve 
patient outcomes.13,14,22
In 2013, more than 75% of U.S. 
hospitals reported having implement-
ed a CPOE system, and prescribers en-
tered at least 50% of orders into CPOE 
systems in 80% of hospitals.13 Of U.S. 
hospitals with CPOE systems, about 
60% reported concurrent implemen-
tation of CDS within their CPOE sys-
tem. In addition, about 70% of U.S. 
hospitals that provided care in ambu-
latory care settings used e-prescribing 
systems. BCMA systems to verify pa-
tient identity and electronically check 
doses administered by nurses were re-
ported in about 90% of U.S. hospitals 
in 2014,14 up from about 75% in 2013.13 
Almost 95% of U.S. hospitals used an 
eMAR system in 2014.14 In addition, 
combined use of eMAR, BCMA, and 
electronic 
nursing 
documentation 
was reported in almost two thirds of 
U.S. hospitals in 2013.13 Smart infusion 
pumps were used in about 80% of U.S. 
hospitals in 2014.14
In 2013, about one third of U.S. 
hospitals reported having a complete 
EHR (no paper records), and two 
thirds reported complete clinical doc-
umentation with an EHR (Table 1).13
Meaningful use in the United States 
was an ongoing effort to drive adoption 
and use of EHRs in a way that improves 
patient outcomes and HIE.7,13,15,22 No-
tably, meaningful use included core 
and menu measures for exchanging 
clinical information among providers, 
medication reconciliation and drug 
formulary checks, summary-of-care 
records for transitions of care, and elec-
tronic formulary query and transmis-
sion of discharge prescriptions.13,15,22,a 
In addition, HIE is an important infra-
structure component of current and 
future meaningful use that will allow 
providers and patients to share medi-
cal information.13,15,22
More granular analysis of medi-
cation safety technology use (EHRs, 
CPOE, BCMA, smart infusion pumps) 
reported in ASHP’s national hospital 
survey for 2009−2014 can be found in 
Appendix B, a data supplement to this 
white paper (available at www.ajhp.org).
Medication safety technologies 
offer some of the most important 
tools for decreasing medication er-
rors, preventing adverse drug effects, 
and improving drug use and patient 
outcomes, given the complexity of 
the drug-use process and number of 
potential failure points.
4.3 Hospital medication-use 
systems
The medication-use system is de-
fined as the provision of medication 
by the pharmacy to patient-care units 
and ultimately administration to the 
patient.13,14,56-60 The process includes 
activities associated with product selec-
tion, prescribing, transcribing, dispens-
ing, and administration such as drug 
choice, order entry and transmission, 
pharmacist evaluation of the order, 
drug verification at dispensing and 
administration, and recording in the 
MAR. The medication-use system 
also includes monitoring and patient 
education.56,58
Medication therapy monitoring 
includes assessment of the drug’s 
therapeutic and adverse effects and 
involves transition-of-care services, 
medication history and reconcilia-
tion, medication order review and 
entry, implementation of medication-
use system technology, and ambu-
latory care transitions.22,56 As part of 
 
medication-use monitoring, proactive 
patient assessment includes monitor-
ing for therapeutic duplication in the 
patient’s medication regimen (e.g., 
multiple simultaneous use of various 
acetaminophen-containing products) 
and for the appropriateness of the 
dose.58 In addition, an ongoing, system-
atic program for quality assessment and 
improvement in the medication-use 
system should be in place.

cation delivery from order entry to 
the pharmacy to clinical units until 
the medication is administered to the 
patient.13,14,56-60 Whether the distribu-
tion is from a centralized pharmacy 
department or decentralized phar-
macy satellites or automated dis-
pensing devices (e.g., decentralized 
medication ADCs), the key overarch-
ing medication-use system compo-
nents are the same:
• 
Prescribing
• 
Data to support clinical 
decisions for drug choice and 
regimens
• 
Medical record documentation 
by prescribers, pharmacists, 
nurses, and clinical staff or 
CPOE
• 
Ideally decision support 
functionality
• 
Transcribing
• 
Medication order received 
(verbal, written, or CPOE)
• 
Order evaluated (e.g., drug 
choice, dosage, adverse 
drug reactions, medication 
reconciliation, lab results) 
and verified by pharmacy and 
nursing staff
• 
Documentation in the MAR; 
includes procurement and 
storage
• 
Dispensing
• 
Data entry, screening and 
verification, and dispensing in 
the MAR
• 
Drug preparation (includes 
procurement and storage) by the 
pharmacy staff
• 
Dispense to patient care units 
or verify inventory levels in 
decentralized automated 
dispensing devices such as ADCs
• 
Administration, nursing staff
• 
Drug procurement and 
preparation (as needed)
• 
Medication verification, 
including dosage
• 
Administration to patient with 
documentation on the patient’s 
MAR; BCMA and eMARs provide 
an added level of safety
• 
Monitoring
• 
Therapeutic drug monitoring 
includes assessment of 
medication’s therapeutic effects 
(including identification of any 
potential duplication) and any 
adverse drug reactions (treat 
and report to medication safety 
officer as needed)
• 
Review of laboratory results as 
needed by pharmacy, medical, 
and nursing staff
In addition, the medication-use system 
supports outcome measurement doc-
umentation in compliance with the fa-
cility quality improvement standards.
Technologic solutions (e.g., CPOE, 
EHR/EMR, CDS, eMar, BCMA) are 
critical components in an ideal 
medication-use process.13,14,22,56,57,59,60

Such technologies should be designed 
to support clinicians and promote im-
proved patient care processes, com-
bining process, information systems, 
and supporting technologies that 
work together to allow desired im-
provements.59 As noted elsewhere in 
this white paper, current technologies 
support identification and alerting of 
cumulative acetaminophen dosage 
as part of the medication-use process 
and system.
4.4 Medication errors in the 
inpatient setting
Medication errors can occur at 
various steps in the medication-use 
process as depicted in Figure 1.
Analysis of the error distribu-
tion in the 1995 landmark study on 
medication errors showed that the 
highest rate of errors is in ordering 
and administering: ordering, 39%; 
transcribing, 12%; dispensing, 11%; 
and administering, 38%.61 In two 
follow-up studies, it was shown that 
a substantial reduction in medica-
tion errors could be achieved by im-
plementation of CPOE.62-65 Research 
indicates that implementation of 
CPOE systems in non-rural U.S. hos-
pitals could prevent 3 million ADEs 
annually.64
The landmark 2006 report “Pre-
venting Medication Errors” from the 
Institute of Medicine asserts that er-
rors injure 1.5 million Americans 
each year at a cost of $3.5 billion in 
lost productivity, wages, and addi-
tional medical expenses.66 It is esti-
mated that
• 
100,000 people die/year resulting 
from medication errors
• 
More than 400,000 drug-related in-
juries occur each year in the hospital 
setting 
• 
800,000 drug-related injuries occur 
in LTC
• 
51.5 million medication errors 
occur during the filling of 3 billion 
prescriptions each year
• 
530,000 medication errors occur 
among Medicare recipients in out-
patient clinics
Errors in the hospital medication-
use process
• 
Prescribing: 39%, wrong dose/drug/
route and allergies, interactions
• 
Transcribing: 12%, wrong dose/
route/patient/time/drug
• 
Dispensing: 11%, wrong dose/route/
patient/time, incorrect labeling/
drug identification, primary allergy 
and drug–drug interaction identified
• 
Administration: 38%, wrong patient/
dose/drug/route/time, and omis-
sions, including infusion pumps
Given the potential benefits for 
both patients and healthcare expen-
ditures, healthcare quality and patient 
care experts recommended that the 
Leapfrog Group select CPOE as one of 
its initial hospital safety standards.64
5. Technology 
Medication safety technologies 
such as EHRs, CPOE, CDS, eMAR, 
BCMA, ADCs, and smart infusion 
pumps have great potential in mitigat-
ing potential medication errors and 
associated adverse consequences, in-
cluding inadvertent supratherapeutic 
dosing of drugs like acetaminophen 
that have narrow therapeutic index-

es.13,,14,56,57,59,60 As described earlier in 
this white paper, gaps in optimal de-
ployment of such technologies can re-
duce their effectiveness in preventing 
adverse consequences of medication 
use in the inpatient environment.
5.1 Tools available to 
help the hospital clinician 
monitor the accumulation of 
acetaminophen
Data embedded for use within 
prescribing and dispensing systems/
applications are commercially avail-
able for clinicians in a variety of 
healthcare settings.13,14,22,56,57,59,60 Ad-
vanced dosing support systems employ-
ing rules-based processes provide 
accurate dosing recommendations, 
including adjustments, by utiliz-
ing patient attributes such as age, 
indication for use, renal function, 
comorbidities, and weight or body 
surface area (when applicable).59 In 
addition to dose screening, exist-
ing systems provide protocol data 
and standard order sets such as pre-
defined order sentence (also known 
as the Sig) pick lists. Dosing rules are 
written by clinical editorial staff to 
account for daily dose limits, maxi-
mum single doses, and cumulative 
lifetime limits based on clinical ref-
erences. Dosing clinical support 
systems support healthcare provid-
ers when dosing drugs with narrow 
therapeutic ranges or well-defined 
daily maximum doses. Application 
programming 
interface 
technol-
ogy allows for calculation of aceta-
minophen doses within and across 
prescribed drug products, allowing 
maximum daily dose screenings to 
be performed across products. This 
feature is in addition to the basic 
dose/duration/frequency screening.
Institutions utilizing flat file data 
in legacy systems have the potential 
to use ingredient record flags for prod-
ucts containing acetaminophen. This 
could be used when developing a dose 
accumulator to be displayed on the 
MAR for nursing to see at the time of 
administration. Proper implementa-
tion of the functionality of drug knowl-
edgebase tools is necessary to optimize 
such features for patient safety.
Referential products offer com-
prehensive drug information to help 
improve patient outcomes and to help 
treat and diagnose patients at the point 
of care. Content is available online and 
via smartphones and tablets as well as 
traditional print versions. Using Web 
links, online referential content can 
be integrated into electronic health 
information systems for minimal in-
terruption in workflow. Many of the 
well-respected referential offerings go 
beyond the dosing provided by manu-
facturer labeling to include off-label 
dosing from primary literature and 
special alerts (FDA, Institute for Safe 
Medication Practices, and manufactur-
ers) for neonates through geriatrics.
5.2 Drug database companies
The drug database companies 
provide robust drug data, patient 
education materials, auxiliary label 
text, and referential content for use 
within electronic prescribing, CPOE, 
pharmacy dispensing, and other ap-
plications. The drug database com-
panies (e.g., First Databank, Elsevier 
Gold Standard, Wolters Kluwer) have 
played a prominent role in assisting 
healthcare professionals by providing 
valuable acetaminophen recognition 
and labeling tools that have standard-
ized the prescription and OTC warn-
ing labels for medications containing 
acetaminophen. Additionally, they of-
fer data and software tools to support 
prescribing, dispensing, and adminis-
tration of acetaminophen by
• 
Providing age- and weight-based 
dosing alerts
• 
Calculating the 24-hour acetamino-
phen dose across all prescribed drug 
products
These medication safety tools are de-
signed to supplement the capabilities 
of the various EHR applications used 
in the inpatient setting. These tools 
are commercially available for inte-
gration into EHR systems companies 
from the drug database companies.
5.3 Characteristics of an ideal 
system
Today there are a number of 
EHR vendor applications compa-
nies in use in the U.S. hospital inpa-
tient marketplace, including Cerner, 
Epic, McKesson Pharmacy Systems, 
Allscripts, and MEDITECH. These 
EHR vendors provide clinical support 
systems that support dosing data alerts 
from drug database vendors such as 
First Databank, Wolters Kluwer, and 
Elsevier Gold Standard. Institutions 
should dialogue with their EHR ven-
dors to fully understand the drug ac-
cumulator possibilities within their 
systems. Inpatient systems must mix 
and match the available capabilities 
in a manner consistent with their 
medication 
management 
process 
flow. The key to successful utilization 
of these tools resides in the following 
factors:
• 
Education of hospital staff so they 
have thorough knowledge of systems 
and tools capabilities and operation
• 
Activation of acetaminophen dosing 
accumulators and alert functionality
• 
Evaluation of CPOE systems for their 
ability to reduce the rates of prevent-
able overdosage errors using system-
atic, standardized tools whenever 
possible
• 
Integration of dispensing robotics 
(e.g., Accudose, Omnicel, Pyxis) with 
alerts and accumulator tools
• 
Seamless data transfer during all 
transitions of care from admittance 
to discharge
• 
Use of BCMA systems since they are 
less prone to alert overrides
• 
Provision of functionality for docu-
mentation of necessary overrides
• 
Use of periodic vendor retraining 
for staff as system version updates 
become available
• 
Harmonization of systems operation 
with facility’s medication manage-
ment process for consistency
• 
Implementation of safeguards to ad-
dress alert fatigue
• 
Expanded clinical pharmacist role to 
include monitoring of liver function 
testing for patients on acetaminophen

During multiple interviews, users 
consistently attributed system fail-
ures to poor training and the lack of 
user knowledge of the capabilities and 
functionality of their total systems. 
Intimate involvement by clinical in-
formatics staff in the system selection 
and implementation is needed so 
they can educate bedside clinicians 
(prescribers, pharmacists, nurses) 
on tools available for their use. Many 
institutions have physician and/or 
pharmacy “champions” who dialogue 
with the informatics staff to ensure 
that clinician issues are being ad-
dressed. This is especially important 
when an institution goes “live” with a 
new EHR system and when upgrades 
are applied.
As a number of hospital pharmacy 
directors were interviewed about their 
department’s system capabilities re-
garding the safe handling and admin-
istration of acetaminophen, it became 
apparent that total systems integra-
tion was prerequisite for a successful 
implementation of the technology and 
systems tools necessary to achieve the 
safety and efficiency intended. The 
integration of automated dispensing 
systems with the pharmacy process-
ing system (e.g., Omnicell, Pyxis, Accu-
dose) into the medication-use process 
flow can enhance the administration 
safety for all medications, especially 
acetaminophen. Individually, each of 
these systems can potentially enhance 
safety, but if not properly integrated 
into the flow process, they can provide 
dangerous gaps in the monitoring of 
acetaminophen-containing medica-
tion and other medications that re-
quire precise dosing and monitoring.
6. Process
Multiple hospital pharmacy di-
rectors interviewed for this white 
paper cited the importance of de-
veloping a comprehensive and well-
documented process flow outlining 
the sequence of events associated 
with a patient in the inpatient setting 
from 
preadmittance, 
admittance, 
and all transitions of care through 
discharge.
6.1 Process flow
This process flow encompasses the 
activities from preadmission medica-
tion review through reviews at transi-
tion between units, medication or-
ders, dispensing, and administration 
to discharge medication review (Fig-
ure 2).13,14,56,57,59,60 Hospital medication 
distribution systems define the provi-
sion of medication order and delivery 
from the pharmacy to clinical units, 
administration, and discharge review 
and reconciliation.13,14,56-60 To support 
this flow, hospital systems need to 
provide support for
• 
Clinical decisions for drug selection 
and administration
• 
Medical record documentation of 
orders, reviews, verifications, and 
administration by clinical staff at the 
point of action
• 
Monitoring of patient response to 
treatment and laboratory results
• 
Outcome measurement documenta-
tion in compliance with the facility 
quality improvement standard
• 
Patient education
The process flow procedures must 
be integrated into the pharmacy pre-
scription processing system technol-
ogy with special emphasis on iden-
tifying points of process disruption 
that can compromise administration 
safety of acetaminophen and other 
targeted drugs. These points of dis-
ruption can also be transformed into 
points of healthcare intervention that 
can safeguard patient safety. Some 
points of disruption identified in 
process flow charts that can lead to 
potential acetaminophen overdose 
episodes include
• 
 “prn” dosing of acetaminophen
• 
Non-integrated automated dispens-
ing devices (e.g., ADCs)
• 
Absence of barcode technology (e.g., 
BCMA)
• 
Transitions of care gaps
• 
Undocumented alert overrides as-
sociated with hard stops
• 
Institution-specific acetaminophen 
accumulator dosing thresholds
• 
Continuous i.v. maintenance aceta-
minophen therapy
• 
Use of opioid and acetaminophen 
combination products
• 
Alert fatigue
According to an independent re-
port released by Avalere Health,67 
pharmacists and pharmacy techni-
cians can play an integral role in sup-
port of patient safety and improved 
outcomes throughout the continuum 
of care. The study cited five areas in 
which pharmacists could enhance co-
ordinated care:
• 
Medication management
• 
Medication reconciliation
• 
Preventive care services
• 
Education and behavior counseling
• 
Participation in collaborative care 
models
This enhanced role strengthens the 
continuum of care in the inpatient 
hospital’s operating procedures (Fig-
ures 3–5). These procedures should be 
centered in a totally integrated deci-
sion support system that utilizes all of 
the medication safety technology tools.
6.2 Medication reconciliation
Medication reconciliation is a key 
priority in safe medication use with-
in the United States.13,18,19,22,23,26,27,29,68
 
Critically important in optimizing safe 
medication use is reconciliation at 
transitions of care.13,18,19,22-27,29,68-70 Lack 
of communication at care transitions 
has clearly been shown to adversely 
affect patient care.23-25,70 As described 
in this white paper, the need for opti-
mal medication reconciliation during 
transitions of care is particularly im-
portant for drugs like acetaminophen 
that have a narrow therapeutic index 
and that inadvertently can be dupli-
cated in potentially toxic amounts be-
cause of their availability in numerous 
multiple-ingredient products.1-6
There is evidence that medication 
discrepancies can adversely affect 
patient outcomes, and an effective 
process for medication reconciliation 
can reduce medication errors and

support safe medication use by pa-
tients.23,27,29,68 Medication reconcilia-
tion is the process of identifying the 
most accurate list of all medications 
by comparing medications a patient 
is taking (and should be taking) with 
newly ordered medications in order 
to identify and resolve discrepancies 
or potential problems.22,23,26,27,29,68 The 
comparison addresses duplications, 
omissions, dosage changes, and inter-
actions as well as the need to continue 
current medications.29 Discrepancies 
include omissions, duplications, con-
traindications, unclear information, 
and changes. The purpose is to obtain 
and maintain accurate and complete 
medication information and to use it 
within and across the continuum of 
(e.g., from surgical to medical units, 
from intensive care to medical units) 
and outside (e.g., home, LTC facilities) 
the hospital, patient education on safe 
medication use, and communication 
with all providers. The importance of 
medication reconciliation also was af-
firmed by CMS as part of meaningful 
use stage 2 and EHR incentive pro-
grams for eligible professionals, eligi-
ble hospitals, and critical access hospi-
tals in 2015–2017 and was to continue 
with meaningful use stage 3 in 2018.22
Complicating optimal transitions 
of care is the lack of adequate com-
munication among various healthcare 
providers, including prescribers, phar-
macists, and nurses.24,25,69,70 For example, 
communication between hospitalists 
care to ensure safe and effective medi-
cation use.22,26,27,68 Reconciliation is 
considered complete when each med-
ication has been actively continued, 
discontinued, substituted (e.g., under 
formulary guidelines), held, or modi-
fied at each transition point.27,68
The importance of medication rec-
onciliation in the inpatient setting was 
affirmed when the Joint Commission 
introduced a National Patient Safety 
Goal (NPSG.03.06.01) aimed at main-
taining and communicating accurate 
patient medication information, with 
the goal of reducing negative patient 
outcomes associated with medication 
discrepancies.29 Included in this care 
process are coordination of informa-
tion during transitions of care within

and the patient’s primary care provid-
er occurs infrequently (3–20%).24,25,70
 
As a result, various professional soci-
eties (e.g., American College of Physi-
cians, Society of Hospital Medicine, 
American Geriatrics Society, Society 
of Academic Emergency Medicine, 
ASHP) have identified the need for 
adequate communication at transi-
tions of care as an important element 
in optimizing patient care, including 
medication use.24,25,69,70
 In particular, 
pharmacist collaboration should be 
encouraged, and systems and tech-
nologies that enable collaboration 
should be enhanced; medication rec-
onciliation across the continuum of 
care is an important element of such 
collaboration.23,69
As part of the ACA, the Department 
of Health and Human Services was 
charged with developing a National 
Quality Strategy (NQS).71-73 Priorities 
for the NQS were developed initially 
by a broad base of stakeholders con-
vened by the NQF and later turned 
over to the Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality to implement. One 
of the six priorities under the NQS 
initiative is the promotion of effec-
tive communication and coordination 
of care leading to better long-term 
health outcomes as demonstrated in 
part by fewer conflicting medications 
and better patient understanding of 
the purpose for each medication.73 
Similarly, CMS’s EHR incentive pro-
gram emphasizes advanced use of 
EHR technology to promote improved 
patient outcomes and HIE.22
The 
medication 
reconciliation 
process involves three steps27:
• 
Verification (collection of medica-
tion history),
• 
Clarification (ensuring that medica-
tions and their doses are appropri-
ate), and
• 
Reconciliation (documentation of 
changes in the orders).
Preventing ADEs is the impetus 
behind medication reconciliation.26,27 
Approximately 50–70% of medica-
tion errors occur during transitions 
of care.13,24,26,27 Substantial experience 
has shown that poor communication 
of medical information at care tran-
sition points is responsible for up to 
50% of all medication errors and up 
to 20% of ADEs within hospitals.13,24,27 
Likewise, two thirds of adverse events 
occurring within 3 weeks of discharge 
from the hospital to outpatient setting 
are drug related.24
Whenever a patient moves from 
one setting to another or from one 
care provider to another where medi-
cation orders change or must be re-
newed, clinicians should review all 
previous orders against new orders 
and care plans and should reconcile 
any differences.23,26,27 Failure to imple-
ment standard processes for ensur-
ing complete reconciliation will result 
in medication errors that can lead to 
ADEs and patient harm.26,27
The Institute for Healthcare Im-
provement  recommends the following 
methods for improvement in reconcil-
ing medications at points of transition26:
• 
Reconcile admission orders with 
home medication lists and advise the 
patient’s primary care provider of any 
changes.
• 
Reconcile medication orders when 
patients are transferred to other units, 
particularly if the patient is moving 
from one level of care to another. The 
patient’s provider should be advised 
of any pre-transfer medications that 
are not reordered or are deemed inap-
propriate, and any omission should 
be documented as deliberate.
• 
Reconcile discharge instructions and 
prescriptions with the MAR.
• 
Reconcile medications in the outpa-
tient setting.
The most effective methods for 
implementing effective medication 
reconciliation in the hospital setting 
are those that employ pharmacy staff 
and focus on patients at high risk for 
adverse events.23,74,75 Important ele-
ments in pharmacist-related interven-
tions included
•

cation history at admission,

sion and discharge,

• 
Patient counseling,
• 
Discharge communication with 
outpatient providers, and
• 
Post-discharge communication with 
the patient.23,75 
Obtaining an accurate preadmission 
medication history appears to be the 
most critical step in avoiding propa-
gation of potential harm throughout 
the care transitions of hospitalization 
and after discharge, and errors dur-
ing this step are the most common 
reasons for preventable ADEs second-
ary to medication discrepancies.75,76
 
However, it is difficult to distinguish 
the impact of an accurate medication 
history from the impact of successful 
medication reconciliation.75
Targeting interventions to a subset 
of patients at greatest risk of an ADE, 
such as geriatric patients, patients 
taking multiple medications, and/or 
patients with multiple comorbidities, 
may have the highest yield.75 In fact, a 
targeted approach by pharmacists has 
been recommended as an important 
means of preventing inadvertent acet-
aminophen overdosage in hospitalized 
patients.5,6 As part of this approach, 
interdisciplinary communication and 
education of prescribers and nurses 
by pharmacists (e.g., about maximum 
acetaminophen dosage and presence 
in multiple-ingredient formulations) 
should be emphasized.5,6,18
7. Conclusions
Despite the use of numerous 
medication safety technologies such 
as EHRs, CPOE, CDS, eMAR, BCMA, 
ADCs, and smart infusion pumps, the 
incidence of acetaminophen overdose 
and other associated sentinel events 
continues to be a serious problem in 
many hospitals and LTC treatment 
settings. Even though beneficial, the 
technologies implemented at the ter-
tiary care hospitals in two recent stud-
ies were not of themselves sufficient 
to prevent supratherapeutic dosing 
of acetaminophen. Without optimal 
deployment of such technologies and 
robust and well-developed processes 
that emphasize staff knowledge and 
responsibility and effective HIE, in-
cluding drug reconciliation at all tran-
sitions of care from admission through 
discharge, many situations are created 
that lead to gaps in care related to dose 
accumulation and monitoring in the 
safe use of acetaminophen in the in-
patient setting.
Along with recommendations on the 
adoption and integration of available 
technologies and use of documented 
processes, these recommendations 
emphasize continuing education of 
the patient care staff on the dosing

safety requirements for the admin-

larly the recommended maximum 
daily dose and the special care re-
quired when the drug is adminis-
tered to the elderly, patients with 
liver dysfunction, and patients be-
ing treated for specific disease states 
such as osteoarthritis.
Inpatient facilities (hospitals, skilled 
nursing, and others) do have available 
to them all of the technology tools 
needed to monitor and employ dose 
alerts, accumulators, and warning sys-
tems and to integrate such medication 
safety tool capabilities necessary to 
reduce inadvertent overdose episodes. 
For optimal patient safety outcomes, 
full functionality of these tools needs to 
be configured to meet the institution’s 
policies and processes and then imple-
mented and integrated with the other 
systems in use. Equally important is 
the training of the staff on the function-
ality, operation, and utilization of the 
technical capabilities of the inpatient 
system as well as recommended dos-
ages and sources of acetaminophen. 
Special emphasis must be placed on 
the initial training and re-training of 
all staff who use these systems. Addi-
tionally, the white paper describes the 
development and implementation of 
a process map that provides for guid-
ance and documentation of the drug 
reconciliation process from admit-
tance to discharge and specifically the 
special attention needed to success-
fully execute safe patient passages 
through the various transitions of care 
that patients routinely navigate in the 
inpatient setting.
Finally, the clinical pharmacist 
must play a prominent role in the en-
tire drug reconciliation process with 
particular emphasis on participating 
in the transitions of care as they relate 
to drug therapy.

Recommendation 6: Integration of health 
information technology (IT) solutions that 
minimize the risk of inadvertent overdosage 
for high-risk medications into all process 
flows and decision support.
Stakeholders: Directors of pharmacy, clinical infor-
maticists, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, chief 
information officers and IT staff, EHR vendors, medi-
cal staff via pharmacy and therapeutics committees, 
chief nursing officers, and nursing staff
• 
Customize and monitor CPOE and CDS systems to 
optimize rate reductions in medication errors and 
adverse drug events associated with inadvertent 
overdosage of high-risk medications
• 
Review policies for order entry that aim for increased 
safety (e.g., reviewing current medications before 
entering new orders)
• 
Update existing medication databases as necessary to 
prevent duplicate order errors
• 
Install and activate dose accumulator, alert, and 
monitoring tools
• 
Target all medications with a narrow therapeutic 
margin
• 
For acetaminophen, implement a “never event” 
strategy for daily dosages exceeding 4 g, including 
for any combination of i.v., oral, and rectal 
administration
• 
Customize alerts to target users in order to avoid “alert 
fatigue”
• 
Whenever possible, evaluate CPOE systems for their 
ability to reduce the rates of preventable overdosage 
errors using systematic, standardized tools
In addition to the recommendations for 
stakeholder action 
Recommendation to National Council for Prescrip-
tion Drug Programs:
Identify a “model hospital” that
• 
has adopted most of this white paper’s 
recommendations and
• 
is willing to participate in an acetaminophen safety 
study 
• 
Conduct a safety study
