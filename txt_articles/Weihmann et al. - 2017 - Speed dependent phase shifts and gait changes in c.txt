Speed dependent phase shifts and gait
changes in cockroaches running on
substrates of different slipperiness

Abstract
Background: Many legged animals change gaits when increasing speed. In insects, only one gait change has been
documented so far, from slow walking to fast running, which is characterised by an alternating tripod. Studies on
some fast-running insects suggested a further gait change at higher running speeds. Apart from speed, insect gaits
and leg co-ordination have been shown to be influenced by substrate properties, but the detailed effects of speed
and substrate on gait changes are still unclear. Here we investigate high-speed locomotion and gait changes of the
cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, on two substrates of different slipperiness.
Results: Analyses of leg co-ordination and body oscillations for straight and steady escape runs revealed that at
high speeds, blaberid cockroaches changed from an alternating tripod to a rather metachronal gait, which to our
knowledge, has not been described before for terrestrial arthropods. Despite low duty factors, this new gait is
characterised by low vertical amplitudes of the centre of mass (COM), low vertical accelerations and presumably
reduced total vertical peak forces. However, lateral amplitudes and accelerations were higher in the faster gait with
reduced leg synchronisation than in the tripod gait with distinct leg synchronisation.
Conclusions: Temporally distributed leg force application as resulting from metachronal leg coordination at high
running speeds may be particularly useful in animals with limited capabilities for elastic energy storage within the legs,
as energy efficiency can be increased without the need for elasticity in the legs. It may also facilitate locomotion on
slippery surfaces, which usually reduce leg force transmission to the ground. Moreover, increased temporal overlap of
the stance phases of the legs likely improves locomotion control, which might result in a higher dynamic stability.

Background
Alternating sets of synchronously active diagonally adja-
cent legs, i.e. tripods in insects and four-leg sets in spiders,
are largely regarded as the dominating coordination
pattern employed by fast running insects and arachnids
[1–3]. The sets either comprise the legs L1, R2, L3 (and
R4) or R1, L2, R3 (and L4) with L and R indicating the left
and right side legs, respectively, both counted fore to aft.
These sets are accounted as the physical basis for spring-
mass like dynamics as observed in the locomotion of some
species [4–6]. Strictly alternating sets of legs are charac-
terised by anti-cyclic activity of adjacent ipsilateral legs
and the contralateral legs of the pairs of legs, i.e. by phase
shifts of 0.5 [7–9]. Deviations from the alternating pattern
[10–14], however, have rarely been analysed in the context
of physical and biomechanical constraints and were
mostly attributed to anatomical differences or inherent
variability of poly-pedal locomotor systems. Nevertheless,
characteristic changes in the speed-dependent increase of
stride frequencies and oxygen consumption with simul-
taneously lacking aerial phases, as found in some studies
[2, 15–17], seem to indicate an additional gait transition
for high running speeds in insects and spiders.
In bouncing gaits such as running, trotting and multi-
legged equivalents, significant proportions of movement
energy can be elastically stored in the initial and recovered
in the final part of the stance phase with optimised leg
properties [18], which helps to economise locomotion.

 However, the stiffness of energy-storing elastic components
such as sclerites, apodemes or other skeletal structures
[19–21] must be matched to each other in all legs involved
to provide concerted loading and unloading rates. In cock-
roaches, hind legs are characterised by distal joints with
axes in parallel with the main ground force direction, which
facilitates passive elastic energy storage in the hip joint [20].
Bouncing gaits, like trot and, with some restrictions, also
gallop, are characterised by rhythmic upwards and down-
wards movements of the COM with in-phase oscillations
of kinetic and potential energy [22, 23]. In running and
trotting, the initial downwards movement is reversed by a
single impulse of one leg or a set of synchronously active
legs [4]. In gallop-like footfall patterns of vertebrates, such
concerted
stance
phases
decompose
in
consecutive
ground contacts of the single legs [23], which affects loco-
motion dynamics and energy efficiency.
The majority of insect species seem to have significantly
lower maximum running speeds than specialist runners,
which are in the focus of many existing studies [24–28]. One
of these specialists is the blattid cockroach Periplaneta
americana which is characterised by extraordinarily long legs
and a linear increase of the stride frequency over a wide
range of running speeds [29]. Non-specialist runners, such as
the blaberid cockroach species Blaberus discoidalis and
Nauphoeta cinerea seem to be limited in their maximum leg
cycle frequency but must still be able to attain high running
speeds since successful predator avoidance is also crucial in
these species. Just like in bipeds [30] and quadrupeds
[31–33], the dependencies of stride frequencies to
running speed are curvilinear in these blaberid cock-
roach species (cp. [2, 15]), which seems to indicate a
gait change also occurs for these insects. However, the
physical basis for the suspected gait transition has not yet
been revealed. In a recent study on arachnid locomotion
[34] we were able to show that fast moving mites employ
temporally distributed footfall patterns at maximum run-
ning speeds and that such patterns may increase locomo-
tion efficiency in arthropods. In nature, insects are
commonly faced with slippery or unsteady substrates. Such
surfaces do not provide secure footholds and can lead to
unpredictable perturbations [35–37]. To our knowledge, no
studies considering coordinative adaptations to slippery and
unsteady substrates exist for fast moving arthropods.
Accordingly, we examine here whether or not the saturat-
ing stride frequencies found in blaberid cockroaches are ac-
companied by changed footfall patterns and how they can
affect running efficiency and endurance at high speeds on
substrates with different grit sizes and slipperiness.
Methods
Animals
Thirteen adult male Nauphoeta cinerea (body length:
27 ± 1.3 mm, mean ± s.d.) were taken from a laboratory
colony. This species has been examined with regard to
their capabilities in substrate attachment and climbing in
a couple of previous studies (e.g. [38]) which makes them
a good model to examine the impact of substrate proper-
ties on locomotion. Moreover, N. cinerea is closely related
to Blaberus discoidalis, whose locomotion has been exten-
sively examined in the past (e.g. [20, 39–41]). Accordingly,
our results can be well compared to those of the anatom-
ically and behaviourally similar species.
The insects were kept in plastic containers at 25 °C
and were supplied with dog food and water ad libitum.
We used males only to prevent potential bias due to
gravid females. When selecting study animals, we ex-
cluded cockroaches that were unwilling to run. All wings
(representing about 2% of the body mass) were removed
and three hollow Styrofoam spheres (2.5 mm diameter),
coated in white paint were glued (using a mixture of par-
affin and pine resin) onto the pronotum, the second to
third thoracic tergum and close to the end of the abdo-
men, to provide markers for digitization (Fig. 1). The
animals were allowed to recover for at least one hour be-
fore the trials. The total mass of the three spheres and
the wax resin mixture amounted to 6.5 ± 1.2% of the
wingless animals’ body mass. With markers, the mass of
the animals was 450 ± 76 mg.
Running track
Cockroaches were tested in a running track of 50 cm length
and 3.5 cm width, with a floor covered with sandpaper of
30 μm particle size (Ultra Tec, Santa Ana, CA, USA). The
walls were 5 cm high and covered with slippery 1 μm par-
ticle size sandpaper to prevent the animals from escaping.
The central hardboard section (12 cm long) of the walkway
could be exchanged for another piece. The pieces were
either covered with non-slippery 30 μm particle size sand-
paper or semi-slippery 12 μm particle size sandpaper. Dif-
ferent asperity sizes can facilitate or interfere with the
abilities of claws or tarsal attachment pads to engage with a
substrate. Micro-rough substrates within a range from
some tenths to a few μm particle size impedes both, the
claws and the attachment pads, from achieving good
traction, which results in reduced friction and a reduced
ability to climb [42–44]. Whether or not a substrate was
slippery for N. cinerea cockroaches was tested on vertical
substrates of 0.1, 1, 3, 12 and 16 μm particle size. While the
specimens could not climb on 0.1 to 3 μm sandpaper and
had difficulty walking on 12 μm sandpaper, they coped with
16 μm sandpaper. In the central region, the walls of the
running track were made of Perspex allowing video record-
ing of the kinematics in the lateral view (see below). All ex-
amined runs were escape runs. The insects were spurred by
short puffs of air or by touching their feet or cerci with a
fine paint brush. Recordings of straight and continuous
runs were saved for further analysis.

 Recording and digitisation
The runs were recorded in top view with a Photron
FastCam SA2 (Photron Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, resolution
2048 × 2048 pixels) high-speed video camera which was
oriented perpendicularly to the walkway. In the central
region of the running track with the exchangeable sur-
face and the Perspex walls, a bracket with a 45° mirror
provided a side view of the running insects.
Recordings were made at 250 frames per second and
with a shutter time of 2 ms. The central region of the
track filled the camera’s field of view, resulting in a
spatial resolution of approximately 17 pixels per mm.
The track was illuminated with two white LED lights
(XS40, Spectrum Illumniation Inc., Montague MI, USA)
fitted with red filters to reduce their brightness in the
spectral range visible to the insects.
The videos were digitised in ProAnalyst Lite Edition
(Xcitex Inc., Massachusetts, USA). A 72 × 16 × 9.6 mm
Lego™ brick assembly was used for calibration. Top and
side views were calibrated separately taking into regard
slight aspect variations caused by the mirror. Coordinate
axes were adjusted such that the fore-aft axis was
aligned to the direction of the walkway. The three
marker points on the pronotum, thorax, and abdomen
were tracked automatically. Additionally, in the top view,
manual tracking was used to digitise the positions of the
foot tips (Fig. 2) during contact (cp. [16]). Only straight
runs with constant running speed and where animals
did not touch the walls were considered. Runs in which
the running speed varied by more than 10% were ex-
cluded from analyses.
Analyses
In order to assess the relative frequencies of the different
leg coordination schemes; initially all recorded se-
quences were roughly classified. To this end, it was
determined whether the ground contacts of front and
rear legs of one side were in phase; in this case they were
classified as alternating tripod gait (Fig. 3a). Traditionally
metachronal leg coordination, has been defined by refer-
ence to slow movement sequences or those with high
duty factors (e.g. [9, 45, 46]) at which the wave travels
down the entire grouping of appendages. Wave propaga-
tion appears somewhat less clear when duty factors
decrease and relative fluctuations in touch down and
take off increase. However, for bouncing gaits, such as
trotting and the multi-legged equivalents, synchronised
sets of legs, such as tripods, represent the functional unit
which becomes inoperative when the contact phases of
the single legs dissipate. As a direct consequence, such a
temporal dissipation results in a loss of the typical verti-
cal body oscillations (see Fig. 4). Accordingly, in order to
simplify the terminology of the new high speed gait and
because of the considerable similarity of the gait patterns
(Fig. 3b) all runs with low synchronicity between front
and rear legs of one side were classified as metachronal.
Ninety runs were recorded on the non-slippery and 81
runs on the slippery substrate. 11 runs were classified as
metachronal (12%) on the non-slippery substrate, and
eight on the slippery substrate (10%). Metachronal runs
seemed to occur predominantly at high running speeds.
In order to increase the sample size of metachronal runs
allowing statistical comparisons between the paradigms,

the mid-line (red line). The angle between thorax and abdomen was ∠TA. For clarity only the legs of one tripod (R1, L2, R3) are shown. Lower row: Top

 20 additional fast runs were recorded. Finally, 24 of the best
runs, spanning the full speed range of the examined runs,
were digitized and analysed for the non-slippery condition;
11 of them being alternating tripodal gaits and 13 meta-
chronal. On the slippery substrate 25 runs were analysed
with 12 being alternating and 13 metachronal. The ratios
between metachronal and tripodal runs implicitly indicate
that not all animals could be urged to run quickly. Eventu-
ally, the samples cover 6 to 8 individuals which contributed
one or two high quality runs. For each run a sequence of
3.6 ± 1 consecutive strides was digitised.
The phase shift between the touch-downs of the ipsilat-
eral front and rear leg was used to quantitatively distin-
guish alternating tripod gait from metachronal gait
patterns. Runs were classified as metachronal if the me-
dian phase values of a run differed by more than ±0.2
from synchrony (indicated by a phase value of 0 or 1) (cp.
[8]). Differences between phase relations were tested for
significance using the Kuiper two-sample test which is a
circular analogue of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [47].
Before analysis, a correction was applied to the side view
data to account for differences in the heights of the
markers (within and between specimens) due to variation
in the amount of wax used to apply each marker. The dor-
sal cuticle of N. cinerea narrows towards a visible lateral
edge (Fig. 1a). This anatomical structure was easily visible
in the lateral view and was taken to be the dorsal-ventral
centre line. The distances between the centres of the
markers and this midline were determined for each indi-
vidual. Then, the centre points of the markers were pro-
jected orthogonally onto the centre line. Since the COM
of the animals was on an anterior-posterior level with the
hind limb coxae, the thoracic marker was just in front and
very close to the COM of the cockroach body. Therefore
it was taken as its representative.
Once the position of the COM was obtained in the
side view further parameters could be extracted in a
right handed system of coordinates. Extracted parame-
ters included the height of the COM above the substrate,
distance covered per stride, pitch, yaw and the angle
between the thorax and abdomen. Fore-aft, lateral and
vertical velocities as well as accelerations of the body
were then calculated using the derivative of the COM
position data and by smoothing the primary data by fit-
ting gliding second-order polynomials to the time series,
including four adjacent points on both sides at each pos-
ition [48]. Pitch was calculated in the side view as the
angle between substrate and the connecting line between
the pronotum marker and the thorax marker. To calcu-
late yaw, the line connecting the pronotum marker and
the abdominal marker in the top view was used. The
connecting lines between pronotum and thorax marker
and between thorax and abdomen marker were used to
calculate the ventral angle between thorax and abdomen

 in side view. All body oscillations were referred to the
stride periods of the second legs; lateral data was inverted
for tripods consisting of L1, R2 and L3 such that all data
was normalised onto the reverse set of legs (R1, L2, R3).
Moreover, kinematic parameters of the legs such as stride
frequency (fT), duty factors (β), contact and swing rates (tC
−1
and tS
−1) and the positions of the legs in contact with the
ground (see [16]) were also examined. Touch-down and
take-off positions as well as the lateral distance of the feet to
the COM were extracted for all legs while the second legs
were used as proxy for the analyses of the distances travelled
by the COM during contact with the ground (sC) and during
a whole stride (sT). Fore-aft and lateral distances of the feet
with respect to the COM (Fig. 2) were measured along the
x- and y-axis of a body-fixed coordinate system in top view.
Data for corresponding left and right legs were merged.
The changes in contact duration (tC) and swing duration
(tS) with speed are highly non-linear (Additional file 1:
Figure S8). Both measures can be linearized by consider-
ing the reciprocal values (tC
−1 and tS
−1), i.e. contact and
swing rate. The dependencies on running speed were then
approximated by using linear least squares fits. The
contact rate increases linearly with running speed. On
the non-slippery substrate the swing rates have sloped
dependencies at lower speeds and adopt constant values
at high speeds. The point of intersection indicates a transi-
tional velocity (Fig. 5).
Stride frequencies and duty factors derive from these
durations and rates. Their velocity dependencies are non-
linear as well. Their approximate speed dependencies were
calculated by following Weihmann [16]. Thus, stride fre-
quencies (fT) were calculated as fT = tT
−1 = (tC + tS)−1. Their
slopes are linear and relatively steep at low speeds and
decrease in a non-linear manner at speeds above the tran-
sition point (Fig. 5). With tT being the stride duration, i.e.
the reciprocal of the stride frequency, duty factors were
calculated conventionally (β = tC/tT) for all pairs of legs.
Due to the specific characteristics of tC and tT, their
velocity dependencies displayed graphs consisting of two
adjacent hyperbola for each leg. The curvatures of the
graphs were higher at low running speeds and low above
the transition speed (Fig. 5).
On the slippery substrate, metachronal runs occurred at
much lower running speeds which resulted in a wide overlap
region (Additional file 1: Figure S6). Therefore, no saturation
of stride frequencies and swing rates could be observed.
All analyses were performed using MatLab scripts
(MATLAB 7.10.0; The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).
All values are provided either as mean ± s.d. or as
median and the 25% and 75% percentiles (Q25/Q75).
Accordingly for pairwise comparisons, t-tests or non-
parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test were
used. For multivariate analyses one way analyses of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests were
applied. If not specified otherwise, all statistical tests
refer to a 5% significance level.
Oscillations of the COM accelerations were analysed
in all three dimensions using Matlab’s Fast Fourier
Transformation (FFT) algorithm. Overall ground reac-
tion forces of the walking legs determine the accelera-
tions of the animal’s body. Therefore, body oscillations
provide insight into the application of leg forces over
time. The frequency spectrums of the acceleration
amplitudes were calculated for each running sequence
and frequency values were normalised due to division by
the individual stride frequency of each run (Fig. 4).
In order to assess the functional basis of the COM oscil-
lations, tripod synchrony factors (TSF) were determined
in accordance with the method proposed by Spagna et al.
[49], i.e. as a normalised fraction of contact phase overlap
between legs in the same set of legs (Fig. 6a). Conse-
quently, the synchrony factor adopts values between 0 and
1, at which 1 corresponds to perfect synchronicity. Add-
itionally, we determined the relative temporal overlap of
consecutive stance phases of the sets of legs. In contrast

 introduced by Ting et al. [2] we did not focus on those
phases with six legs on the ground but determined the
time span of a set’s ground contact from the first con-
tact of one of the legs till the last leg of the set has lost
ground contact. The fraction with at least one leg of
both sets in contact with the ground, was then related
to the overall time span of the ground contacts of the
two sets of legs (Fig. 6b).
By using the 3D fluctuations of the COM over the
strides of the second legs and the average mass, the
specimens’ fore-aft (Ekx), lateral (Eky) and vertical (Ekz)
kinetic energies as well as the potential energy (Ep) of
the COM were calculated. The kinetic energies were
calculated as the product 0.5·m·v2 with m being body
mass and v being fore-aft, lateral or vertical velocities re-
spectively. The gravitational potential energy was calcu-
lated as the product m·g·h where m is the body mass, g
represents acceleration due to gravity and h is the verti-
cal distance between COM and the substrate. According
to Full and Tu [25], the mass specific external mechan-
ical energy per unit distance (MCOM) was then calculated
by relating the sum of the changes in these COM
energies to the distance travelled during a stride, which

units of J·kg−1·m−1 [25, 31, 50].
MCOM ¼ ΔEkx þ ΔEky þ ΔEkz þ ΔEp
body mass∙stride length
In order to assess locomotion dynamics, recovery and
congruity for Ekx and Ep were calculated for the stride
periods of the second legs. Recovery provides information
about the percentage of exchange between kinetic and
potential energy and was calculated in accordance with
Ahn et al. [51]. Thus, high percentages would indicate out-
of-phase fluctuations of the two energy forms, i.e. COM dy-
namics similar to walking. Low percentages would indicate
in-phase fluctuations as similar to running [31]. Congruity,
in turn, compares the curve progression of kinetic and po-
tential energy. Values of 100% occur if both trajectories fol-
low the same trend throughout a whole gait cycle and
would indicate a running gait; opposed curve progressions
would result in low values, indicating walking gaits [51, 52].
Results
Running speed
Maximum running speed was reduced on the slippery
substrate. While values of up to 0.35 ms−1 were
observed on non-slippery the animals reached only
0.25
ms−1
on
the
slippery
substrate
(Table
1
in
Appendix). Maximal attainable stride frequencies of
about 15 s−1 did not differ between slippery and non-
slippery substrates (Fig. 5, Additional file 1: Figure S6).
The values are very similar to those observed in
Blaberus discoidalis (cp. Fig. 7 in [15]).
On coarse substrate, running speed was significantly
higher in metachronal runs (mean: 0.21 ms−1; Q25: 0.17 ms
−1/Q75: 0.24 ms−1), while alternating tripodal patterns were
used predominantly at lower running speeds (0.12 ms−1;
0.09/0.2 ms−1) (cp. Table 1 in Appendix). Running speeds
of metachronal runs on non-slippery substrate were also
significantly higher than those of the slippery conditions
while the other groups did not differ from each other.
Posture
In the working range of the fore legs, significant
shifts in anterior direction occurred during metachro-
nal coordination with respect to alternating tripodal
runs (Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Table S1). The working
ranges shifted for about 1.3 mm on slippery and 2.4 mm
on non-slippery substrate. Positional shifts in the second
and third legs were smaller and barely significant. Contact
lengths (sC) were significantly smaller in alternating tri-
podal runs on slippery substrate. In the other conditions
no differences could be observed.
The average height of the COM did not change signifi-
cantly with substrate properties or leg coordination; it
was always about 3.74 ± 0.48 mm (Table 1 in Appendix).
Temporal measures
On the non-slippery substrate, contact rates (tC
−1) in-
creased linearly with speed (Fig. 5); the slopes (145/140/
153) were similar for front, middle and rear legs and no
change could be observed between alternating and meta-
chronal leg coordination. Swing rates (tS
−1) also had similar
slopes (98/104/113) and y-intercepts (8.4/9/7.7) at lower
speeds, i.e. with alternating tripodal leg coordination. At
high running speeds and metachronal leg coordination,
swing rates were constant and very similar among the legs
(24 ± 3.5 s−1/ 24.3 ± 3.7 s−1/ 23.7 ± 3.4 s−1).
Phase relations of the legs
As expected, on non-slippery substrate, N. cinerea showed
ipsilateral phase shifts of about 0.5, i.e. alternating sets of
legs at lower and intermediate running speeds. The circular
mean of the phase lag of front leg touch-downs in the stride
period of middle legs (1L2 following the nomenclature of
Shultz 1987 [53]) was 0.49 with a confidence interval (CI)
between 0.47 and 0.51. The value for the middle legs with
regard to rear legs (2L3) was 0.45 (CI: 0.42/0.47) and the
contralateral phases of the rear legs were about 0.5 (0.48/
0.51) (Additional file 1: Figure S7, Additional files 2 and 3).
At high running speeds, however, ipsilateral phase shifts
between the front and middle legs were about (0.32; 0.29/
0.34) and deviated significantly (p < 0.001) from 0.5.
Accordingly, front and rear legs did not act synchronously
and the legs of each set made ground contact successively
rather than synchronously (Fig. 3b). Thus, coordination
patterns were metachronal rather than alternating at high
running speeds, though contralateral phases of the rear legs
were still about 0.5 (0.48/0.51). On slippery substrate phase
values for alternating (1L2: 0.48; 0.46/0.5, 2L3: 0.42; 0.41/
0.44) and metachronal (1L2: 0.33; 0.31/0.36, 2L3: 0.4; 0.38/
0.42) runs were similar to those on non-slippery sub-
strate (Additional file 1: Figure S7).
In accordance with the changed phase lag between
front and middle legs the tripodal synchrony factor
(TSF) also differed between alternating tripodal and
metachronal runs. While the TSF adopted values of
about 0.61 ± 0.15 (n = 161) in alternating runs, the
values decreased when the animals used metachronal leg
coordination (0.25 ± 0.13; n = 119; see Fig. 7), i.e. at
higher running speeds (p < 0.001).
Duty factors and temporal overlap of leg activity
The speed dependencies of the duty factors were similar
in all pairs of legs. Duty factors decreased from about
0.7 at low running speeds to values around and below
0.5 at maximum running speeds (Figs. 3 and 5).
Weihmann et al. Frontiers in Zoology  (2017) 14:54 
Page 7 of 15
 Although duty factors reached relatively low values at
high running speeds on non-slippery substrate and even
fell below the critical value of 0.5, the consecutive foot-
falls of the legs of a set and increased temporal overlap
of the consecutive sets of legs, prevented periods with-
out contact with the ground. For runs above 0.15 ms−1
running speed, the temporal overlap of the consecutive
sets of legs was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in runs
with metachronal leg coordination (0.31 ± 0.11; n = 106)
compared to alternating tripodal runs (0.23 ± 0.1;
n = 72). Below the transitional speed of 0.15 ms−1 meta-
chronal leg coordination was effectively lacking; in alter-
nating runs the temporal overlap adopted values of
0.29 ± 0.12 (n = 87) which did not differ from the values
for metachronal runs at higher running speeds.
Body oscillations
The FFT analyses of the COM accelerations revealed differ-
ences between alternating and metachronal runs in vertical
and lateral direction, while the frequency spectrum in fore-
aft direction differed only little (Fig. 4). On slippery and
non-slippery substrate, tripodal runs were characterised by
relatively high vertical and low horizontal amplitudes while
metachronal runs had lower vertical and higher lateral am-
plitudes. In tripodal and metachronal runs, the frequency-
maxima of the fore-aft and vertical oscillations corresponded
to two times the stride frequency while the maxima of the
lateral oscillations were equal to stride frequency.
In all examined sequences, recovery was low (0.09; 0.03/
0.16) and congruity was always quite high (0.7; 0.59/0.81).
Running speed and leg coordination did not have any impact.
On both substrates, the external MCOM was significantly
higher in tripodal than in metachronal runs (1.77 ± 0.78 J·
kg−1·m−1 vs. 1.47 ± 0.69 J· kg−1·m−1; Table 1 in Appendix).
The differences were about 20% on non-slippery and 10%
on slippery substrate. This coincides with differences in
the peak-to-peak amplitudes of the vertical oscillations,
which were also significantly decreased in metachronal
runs (0.51–0.63 mm) compared with tripodal runs (0.94–
1.02 mm) (Table 1 in Appendix). The lateral amplitudes
were not different on the 5% significance level. However,
on slippery substrate, with metachronal leg coordination,
lateral peak-to-peak amplitudes (1.42 mm) tended to be
smaller than for the other conditions (1.55–1.73 mm;
p = 0.0506; Table 1 in Appendix).
On average the COM changed its position relative to the
running direction once during a stride in metachronal and
tripodal runs (Additional file 1: Figures S1-S4). Though lat-
eral oscillation patterns were not particularly consistent,
during alternating runs, the position of the COM swayed
predominantly to the side of the body with the front and
rear legs on the ground while the COM swayed to that side
with the second leg in contact with the ground during
metachronal runs. Only in metachronal runs on slippery
substrate were we able to find distinct lateral oscillation
patterns. Concurrently, the average trajectory of the yaw
angle was markedly sine shaped here (cp. [54]) while it was
rather cosine shaped during alternating runs on non-
slippery substrate. Accordingly, at touch down, yaw angles
started with low values in metachronal runs on slippery
substrate while in alternating runs on non-slippery sub-
strate yaw angles were maximal when the legs touched the
ground. The trajectories of the yaw angle seemed generally
rather sine shaped on slippery and rather cosine shaped on
non-slippery substrate (Additional file 1: Figure S5).
The mean pitch and yaw angles (Fig. 1; Additional file 1:
Figure S5) were about zero in all running conditions.
However, the pitch amplitudes were significantly lower in
metachronal runs (about 4.5°) compared to alternating
tripodal runs (6° to 7.5°). This difference was higher on
non-slippery
substrate
(Table
1
in
Appendix).
The
amplitudes of yaw were not significantly different from
each other and ranged from 6.8° to 8.1° (Table 1 in
Appendix). The mean angles between thorax and abdo-
men were between 160° and 173° and significantly higher
in alternating tripodal runs than in metachronal runs
(Table 1 in Appendix). Accordingly, the flexion of the
cockroaches’ body was more pronounced in metachronal
runs and their position was relatively outstretched in tri-
podal runs. The amplitudes of this angle (4.1° - 4.7°) were
not different between the running conditions.
Discussion
In ambulatory locomotor systems, gaits and gait changes
have been widely examined in two- and four-legged ver-
tebrates. Arthropods, in turn, are still largely regarded as
being restricted to only two different gaits; namely a highly

 feedback-controlled slow walking gait with metachronal
leg coordination and the rather feedforward controlled
running gait which is characterised by alternating sets of
diagonally adjacent legs [10, 15, 39, 55]. Indeed, some spe-
cies such as wood ants or fruit flies seem to use only these
gaits [11, 52]. In these species the tripodal synchrony fac-
tors (TSF) are low at very low, increase at intermediate
and reach a plateau of high values at high running speeds.
However, our results clearly show that N. cinerea exhibits
two fast running gaits which supplement the typical slow
and mostly unsteady metachronal gait. Thus, in N. cinerea
the TSF values decrease again at running speeds higher
than 0.15 ms−1 (Fig. 7). Reduced synchronicity, in turn, is
caused by phase shifts between the ipsilateral legs that de-
viate significantly from 0.5. Since phase shifts are relatively
constant for each co-ordination pattern, gradually decreas-
ing TSF values are caused by speed-dependent decreasing
contact durations (Fig. 5). The slopes of tC
−1 against running
speed and those of the contact lengths (sC; Fig. 8) are simi-
lar in all walking legs. Therefore, the different lengths of
fore, middle and rear legs [41] apparently do not affect
stride length and are not the reason for changed phase
shifts at high running speeds.
Decreasing phase shifts and resulting consecutive ground
contacts of the legs of a tripodal set facilitate permanent
body support although swing durations increase relative to
single leg contact durations, which enables further increas-
ing stride lengths without the need for ballistic phases of
the COM (Fig. 8). This is reflected by a significantly higher
temporal overlap between consecutive sets of legs in meta-
chronal runs if compared with tripodal gait patterns.
Constant swing durations limit the contraction speeds
of the involved muscles and prevent excessive metabolic
costs which would occur when the legs would be swung
in decreasingly shorter intervals necessary for running
with uniform, short strides and therefore largely increased
stride numbers per distance covered [56]. Correspond-
ingly, high speed metachronal leg coordination can limit
the metabolic costs necessary for swinging the legs back
to touch-down position and reduces the number of strides
per distance travelled, which both contribute significantly
to total running costs [57–59]. A reduction in stride num-
bers may be particularly significant in small legged organ-
isms with their increased relative joint stiffnesses. When
body size and limb weight decrease, relative cross-section
areas of leg muscles and joint membranes increase. Ac-
cordingly, damping within these structures increases rela-
tive to inertial forces of the legs and several researchers
hypothesized that movements of small animals are domi-
nated by passive joint forces rather than inertia [60–62].
Even though, dissipation within the leg joints likely affects
leg swing and accompanied metabolic costs, for cock-
roaches, our results indicate that stance phases seem to be
governed by the inertia of the body which enables exploit-
ation of the advantages of synchronized sets of legs such
as high static stability and the employment of elastic en-
ergy storage at intermediate running speeds.
Since power is the product of force and contraction
speed, muscles generate their highest power output at
intermediate contraction speeds, which makes them par-
ticularly efficient in this range. Eccentric load, as typical
for anti-gravity muscles during stance, is limited and
quickly leads to overstrain [63, 64]. In spring-mass sys-
tems, vertical oscillation amplitudes and maximum verti-
cal ground reaction forces increase with speed [65–67].
Our results in N. cinerea do also show pronounced ver-
tical oscillations during alternating tripodal runs (Fig. 4,
Additional file 1: Figures S1-S4, Table 1 in Appendix).
Accordingly, at high running speed, the interplay of
concordant body pitch, high vertical amplitudes and ac-
companied low reversal points may lead to unfavourable
joint angles in the already bent fore and middle legs
[41]. Moreover, excessive vertical amplitudes are pre-
vented by the generally low position of the COM in
cockroaches.
High
amplitudes
and
ground
reaction
forces would also lead to high contraction speeds in con-
centrically acting and high stresses in eccentrically
loaded muscles. Therefore, further adherence to spring-
mass dynamics at very high running speeds would be
disadvantageous in particular as blaberid cockroaches
use fast sprints only occasionally (cp. [39]), and seem
rarely adapted to prolonged fast leg muscle activity.
Energy efficiency in bouncing gaits such as running, trot-
ting and the alternating tripodal gait of insects such as
cockroaches mostly relies on spring-mass dynamics. This
requires matched stiffnesses of the energy storing compo-
nents in all walking legs to enable concerted loading and
unloading rates [34], particularly in poly-pedal locomotor

 systems. In blaberid cockroaches hind leg stiffness is largely
determined by the passive mechanical properties of the legs
themselves [20, 68]. Except for the coxa, the axes of all in-
volved joints are almost in parallel with the ground force
vectors, which makes cockroach hind legs particularly suit-
able for elastic storage and recovery of movement energy
in vertical directions. As a result, the hip joint effectively
stores and recycles displacement energy over a wide range
of oscillation frequencies [20]. In the front and middle legs,
however, the joint axes are perpendicular to the main
ground force direction. Accordingly leg stiffness depends
strongly on the activity of leg muscles and their contraction
properties. Whether or not elastic mechanisms take effect
in these legs has not been examined yet. However, to en-
able efficient use of the hind leg spring, stride frequencies
and timing of the anterior legs have to be adjusted to that
of the former.
COM accelerations represent causative overall ground
forces. The FFT analysis of COM accelerations in N.
cinerea revealed peaks at two-times stride frequency for
vertical and fore-aft fluctuations and one-time stride fre-
quency for lateral oscillations, which is in agreement
with spring-mass running dynamics [16]. However, along
with the changes in inter-leg coordination as discussed
above the FFT analysis also revealed distinct spectral
changes. Thus, in alternating tripodal runs the vertical
amplitudes were significantly higher than in metachronal
runs while lateral amplitudes were higher in the latter
(Fig. 4). Accordingly, the major plane of COM oscilla-
tions changed from sagittal to horizontal.
Direct measurements also showed significantly higher
vertical peak-to-peak amplitudes of the COM in alter-
nating tripodal gaits (Table 1 in Appendix). Accordingly,
the mass specific external mechanical energy was also
significantly higher in alternating runs. However, boun-
cing gaits such as the alternating tripodal pattern of in-
sects enable efficient loading of elastic leg structures and
benefit from these structures’ elastic recoil. This internal
energy storage and transmission system is not externally
visible and increases the apparent energy fluctuations
and total energetic costs while effective metabolic costs
may be considerably lower [15, 40, 69].
In alternating runs the spectrum of lateral acceleration
amplitudes was blurred and did not show a clear max-
imum (Fig. 4a). However, such a clear maximum close
to one-time stride frequency is required by the model
proposed by Schmitt and Holmes [70] to enable dynamic
stability in the horizontal plane. Therefore, the dynamics
assumed for their lumped two-legged model do better
correspond to those observed for metachronal runs with
their pronounced lateral oscillations and a clear spectral
maximum. Since static stability is reduced with tempor-
ally distributed touch-downs within a set of legs, dynam-
ically stabilizing effects imposed by COM dynamics
similar to the lateral leg spring model [6] and distributed
mechanical feedback [3] may replace static stability as the
major stabilizing mechanism at high running speeds. This
change towards passive stabilization and feed forward con-
trol can also be related to the reduced ratio between contact
duration and the fastest possible reflex response [16, 71].
Thus, in the range of the transitional speed of about
0.15 ms−1 contact durations fall below 40 ms (Fig. 5)
whereas the shortest reflex responses in cockroaches are
about 20 ms [72]. Accordingly, half the stance duration has
passed and the legs’ ground forces have reached their max-
imum before a reflex response could at all affect leg activity.
The mean angles between thorax and abdomen were
slightly but significantly lower in metachronal runs
(Table 1 in Appendix); the total difference was about 5°.
Nevertheless, the positional change led to a smaller dis-
tance between the caudal abdomen tip and the substrate
surface, which might result in intermittent ground con-
tacts as found in wood ants [27] and may have a stabiliz-
ing effect for the vertical position of the COM. However,
the bent body posture could also simply be the result of
anatomical constraints in external leg muscles [73] that
emerge at high running speeds.
Comparative
Blaberus discoidalis is another blaberid cockroach species
extensively used for experimental examinations. This spe-
cies shows a similar saturation of the stride frequency with
increasing running speed as N. cinerea while aerial phases
are also lacking [2, 15]. In N. cinerea, stride frequency sat-
uration is primarily caused by swing phases with constant
and therefore relative to the contact phases increasing du-
rations. Without significant aerial phases, constant swing
phases, in turn, are indicative for changed leg coordin-
ation. Therefore, B. discoidalis seems to pass through the
same gait change as N. cinerea.
For Namibian tenebrionid desert beetles Bartholomew
et al. [17] reported constant oxygen consumption rates
at running speeds above about 0.13 ms−1, while this rate
increased linearly at running speeds below the transi-
tional speed. Moreover, at high running speeds the bee-
tles had very stable COM trajectories without visible
height fluctuations [17]. This corresponds well with the
reduced COM fluctuations found for N. cinerea when
running with metachronal leg coordination, in particular on
slippery substrate (see below). However, due to the flattened
shape of the beetles’ body, lift, which would reduce vertical
ground reaction forces, may also contribute to the constant
cost of transport at high running speeds [17], while drag
should play only a minor role at running speeds signifi-
cantly below 1 ms−1 and given Reynolds numbers [24].
Apart from insects, gait changes from alternating to
metachronal leg coordination also seem to occur in fast
running
arachnids.
Thus,

 increasing to constant swing rates and a concurrently re-
duced increase of stride frequencies were also found in
the vagrant spiders Ancylometes bogotensis and Cupien-
nius salei [16, 74]. Recent experiments in tiny mites with
body lengths of only about 1 mm also revealed coordina-
tive changes at their highest running speeds [34] which in-
dicate dynamical changes even in some of the smallest
terrestrial runners.
However, insects do not always change gaits when
attaining high running speeds. The blattid cockroach Peri-
planeta americana, for example, is specialized in ex-
tremely fast escape runs. This species increases its stride
frequency nearly linearly over a wide range of running
speeds [29]. At their highest speeds they even lift the
frontal legs off the ground and use only their hind legs for
propulsion [25]. Accordingly, they cannot adopt meta-
chronal leg coordination and seem to exploit other mech-
anisms to limit metabolic expenses. Interestingly, the mass
specific external mechanical energy found for running N.
cinerea (1.47 to 1.77 J·kg−1·m−1) is quite similar to values
of about 1.5 J·kg−1·m−1 as measured for P. americana [25].
Linearly increasing stride frequencies were also found in
wood ants and fruit flies [11, 52] while the fast running
North African dessert ant Cataglyphis fortis reduces the
increase of the stride frequency at very high running
speeds [26]. In C. fortis, however, the synchronisation of
the legs within a set is also maintained at high running
speeds, and stride frequencies increase slower at high run-
ning speeds due to the occurrence of aerial phases.
According to [75] the jumping bristletail Petrobius re-
acts upon disturbances by jumps or a peculiar high speed
jumping gait. Though no detailed data are available, this
jumping gait indeed might reproduce mammalian gallop
dynamics with three consecutively active symmetric pairs
of legs instead of four sequenced legs making up a set
which replaces itself after a ballistic phase and causes
redirection of the COM from downwards to upwards. Leg
coordination patterns similar to that of Petrobius were
described recently for the relatively slow locomotion of
some South African species of dung beetles [76]. The
COM dynamics of these beetles’ “gallop” gait, however,
rather seems to employ inverted-pendulum dynamics (e.g.
[50, 77]) allowing them to travel at relatively low meta-
bolic costs on deformable granular media [78].
Impact of slipperiness
On slippery substrate the onset of metachronal leg coordin-
ation occurs at significantly lower running speeds (Table 1
in Appendix) and maximum running speeds were generally
lower (Fig. 7) compared with non-slippery conditions. Ac-
cordingly, the slippery sand paper seems to prevent the
transmission of high horizontal forces as necessary to pro-
pel the animals at velocities above 0.25 ms−1.
In insects using the alternating tripodal gait, the front
and middle legs generate lateral ground reaction forces
and brace against each other [52, 79]. In N. cinerea,
desynchronization of the legs within the alternating sets as
found in metachronal runs arises primarily from changing
phase relations between these legs. Therefore, the early on-
set of metachronal coordination on slippery substrate may
indicate active avoidance of lateral bracing of front and
middle legs which might be of significant functional impact
on coarse substrates. In principle, due to lateral bracing,
elastic structures in the legs can be loaded that recoil in the
second half of the contact phases and might contribute to
energy recovery during a stride. Moreover, bracing can also
be a mechanism to control the lateral dynamics of the
COM and therefore dynamic stability (see [54]). However,
on slippery and granular substrates lateral forces are difficult
to transfer onto the ground which is also reflected by the
significantly shorter contact lengths (sC) found in alternating
runs on slippery substrate (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Along with a significant reduction of vertical COM ac-
celerations, metachronal coordination patterns imply
more evenly distributed ground forces, reduce required
force peaks and can increase energy efficiency if elastic
mechanisms are not applicable (cp. [23]). They also pre-
vent lateral bracing between front and middle legs and
the risk of outward slipping, which could cause severe
disturbance. Accordingly, such patterns seem to be par-
ticularly advantageous on slippery substrates.
Additionally, metachronal leg coordination increases
the temporal overlap of the consecutive sets of legs.
Therefore permanent ground contact of at least some
legs is permitted, although stride lengths increase and
duty factors decrease significantly (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). A
permanent connection between substrate and some
walking legs prevents interruption of proprioceptive in-
formation about the animal’s position with respect to the
ground and may increase controllability of basically
interference-prone locomotion (cp. [71]).
Conclusion
At high running speeds, when the vertical amplitudes of
the body and therefore the use of elasticity are limited,
cockroaches avoid the disadvantages of bouncing by tem-
poral dissociation of the alternating sets of legs which
might also cause reduced metabolic costs and increased
dynamic stability in the horizontal plane. In other words,
the change from the alternating tripodal to a metachronal
gait pattern at high running speeds can help arthropods to
avoid overstraining involved muscles and may facilitate
energy efficient high speed locomotion at the same time.
Since similar kinematic adaptations were found in a range
of unrelated species the high speed metachronal gait is
probably widely used by legged terrestrial arthropods and
may be a characteristic for fast escape manoeuvres.

−1 (see Fig. 4). (PDF 2640 kb)
Additional file 2: Typical running sequence with metachronal leg
coordination. The sequence is slowed down to 1/10 of the recording speed.
The mean running speed was 0.2 ms-1, the mean phase shift between the
ipsilateral legs was 0.77 and the mean duty factor was 0.42. (AVI 1512 kb)
Additional file 3: Typical running sequence with tripodal leg coordination
(1/10 recording speed). Beginning on frame 80 the animal increases its
mean speed within a fraction of a stride from about 0.1 ms-1 towards a
mean running speed of 0.16. Before the change the mean phase shift
between ipsilateral legs was 0.9 and the mean duty factor was 0.52. With
the higher running speed the mean phase shift between the ipsilateral legs
decreased to 0.82 and the mean duty factor to 0.45. (AVI 2343 kb)
