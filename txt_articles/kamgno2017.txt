BACKGROUND
Implementation of an ivermectin-based community treatment strategy for the 
elimination of onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis has been delayed in Central 
Africa because of the occurrence of serious adverse events, including death, in 
persons with high levels of circulating Loa loa microfilariae. The LoaScope, a field-
friendly diagnostic tool to quantify L. loa microfilariae in peripheral blood, enables 
rapid, point-of-care identification of persons at risk for serious adverse events.
METHODS
A test-and-not-treat strategy was used in the approach to ivermectin treatment in 
the Okola health district in Cameroon, where the distribution of ivermectin was 
halted in 1999 after the occurrence of fatal events related to L. loa infection. The 
LoaScope was used to identify persons with an L. loa microfilarial density greater 
than 20,000 microfilariae per milliliter of blood, who were considered to be at risk 
for serious adverse events, and exclude them from ivermectin distribution. Active 
surveillance for posttreatment adverse events was performed daily for 6 days.
RESULTS
From August through October 2015, a total of 16,259 of 22,842 persons 5 years of 
age or older (71.2% of the target population) were tested for L. loa microfilaremia. 
Among the participants who underwent testing, a total of 15,522 (95.5%) received 
ivermectin, 340 (2.1%) were excluded from ivermectin distribution because of an 
L. loa microfilarial density above the risk threshold, and 397 (2.4%) were excluded 
because of pregnancy or illness. No serious adverse events were observed. Nonse-
rious adverse events were recorded in 934 participants, most of whom (67.5%) had 
no detectable L. loa microfilariae.
CONCLUSIONS
The LoaScope-based test-and-not-treat strategy enabled the reimplementation of 
community-wide ivermectin distribution in a heretofore “off limits” health district 
in Cameroon and is a potentially practical approach to larger-scale ivermectin 
treatment for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis in areas where L. loa infection 
is endemic. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others.)

M
ass drug administration with 
regimens containing ivermectin is the 
main strategy for the elimination of 
lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. Although 
ivermectin is generally safe, the distribution of 
the drug has been associated with serious ad-
verse events in central African countries. Since 
1990, more than 500 cases of characteristic en-
cephalopathy after ivermectin treatment,1 includ-
ing approximately 60 fatal cases, have occurred 
during mass drug administration and have been 
reported to the Mectizan Donation Program. 
These neurologic serious adverse events have oc-
curred exclusively in persons with Loa loa micro-
filarial densities of greater than 30,000 micro-
filariae (mf) per milliliter of blood1,2 and are 
presumed to be related to eosinophil-mediated 
inflammation around dying microfilariae, micro-
embolization with subsequent loss of vascular 
integrity in the central nervous system, or both.
Current World Health Organization guide-
lines allow the implementation of ivermectin-
based mass drug administration in areas where 
onchocerciasis is mesoendemic or hyperendemic 
because the potential benefits of mass drug ad-
ministration are thought to outweigh the risk of 
serious adverse events associated with ivermectin, 
although the guidelines stipulate that enhanced 
surveillance for adverse events is required.3 How-
ever, areas in which loiasis is endemic and on-
chocerciasis is hypoendemic are spread through-
out Central Africa,4 and these parasitic diseases 
remain a serious problem. For these areas, a 
test-and-not-treat strategy has been proposed, in 
which persons with high L. loa microfilarial loads, 
who are at risk for serious adverse events, are 
excluded from ivermectin distribution and the 
remaining population (typically >95%) can be 
treated safely.
Successful implementation of the test-and-not-
treat strategy requires a rapid, point-of-contact, 
field-friendly, and highly accurate method to 
quantify L. loa microfilariae. To this end, the 
LoaScope, a mobile-telephone–based videomicro-
scope (previously known as the CellScope Loa), 
was developed.5 With the use of a smartphone 
coupled to a simple optical device, the LoaScope 
automatically counts L. loa microfilariae in periph-
eral blood collected in disposable rectangular 
capillary tubes without the need for sample 
processing (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org).5 To advance the elimination of Oncho-
cerca volvulus and L. loa in countries in Central 
Africa in which onchocerciasis and loiasis are 
coendemic, the feasibility of this test-and-not-
treat strategy was tested in the Okola health 
district in Cameroon, where the distribution of 
ivermectin was halted in 1999 after the occur-
rence of encephalopathy related to L. loa infection.
Methods
Study Site
The Okola health district (Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix) includes 11 administrative 
health areas where mass drug administration was 
halted in 1999 by the Ministry of Public Health 
after 23 cases of encephalopathy occurred dur-
ing the first treatment campaign. Mass drug 
administration resumed in 5 of the 11 areas in 
which onchocerciasis was deemed to be hyper-
endemic or mesoendemic (prevalence of oncho-
cercal nodules among men, >20%). In 2013, the 
results of nodule surveys performed in the 6 ex-
cluded health areas showed prevalences of 6 to 
40%, which is consistent with hypoendemic or 
mesoendemic onchocerciasis.6 L. loa infection 
is highly endemic in the entire Okola health 
district.7,8
Study Design
The test-and-not-treat strategy was implemented 
in 92 villages in the six health areas in which the 
population has been untreated since 1999. The 
location of the 92 villages and the timeline of 
the test-and-not-treat project are shown in Figures 
S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Staff 
were trained to use the LoaScope with the aid of 
a video (Video 1, available at NEJM.org; a high-
grade infection of 30,096 mf per milliliter of 
blood is shown in Video 2). All persons 5 years 
of age or older were invited to participate. The 
test-and-not-treat process consisted of the regis-
tration of persons 5 years of age or older who 
provided consent or assent (all participants pro-
vided written informed consent or assent [or 
parental consent in the case of minors] before 
blood sampling and again before treatment), 
quantification of L. loa microfilarial density with 
the LoaScope, provision of treatment with iver-
mectin (150 μg per kilogram of body weight) to 
eligible persons, and surveillance for adverse 
events (see the Supplementary Appendix). Non-
Videos showing

Test-and-Not-Treat Strategy for Onchocerciasis
pregnant participants who were excluded from 
ivermectin distribution because of high L. loa 
microfilariae counts were administered 400 mg 
of albendazole for intestinal deworming. Women 
who reported that they were pregnant did not 
receive treatment with ivermectin or albendazole 
but were offered iron and folic acid tablets. Iver-
mectin and albendazole were donated by Merck 
and GlaxoSmithKline, respectively, through the 
national program to eliminate onchocerciasis 
and lymphatic filariasis in Cameroon. KLA-Tencor 
provided in-kind donations related to the assem-
bly of the LoaScope devices. Each participant 
was given a card (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix) that listed their L. loa microfilariae 
count, treatment received, and a contact tele-
phone number for questions and for reporting of 
adverse events.
This study was authorized by the National 
Ethics Committee of Cameroon, and the proto-
col, available at NEJM.org, was approved by the 
Division of Operational Research at the Ministry 
of Health. All the authors vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the reported data and analy-
ses and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol.
Quantification of L. loa Microfilariae  
and Exposure to O. volvulus
The LoaScope and its performance have been 
described previously.5 A cutoff L. loa microfilarial 
density of 26,000 mf per milliliter of blood was 
selected initially as the threshold below which 
ivermectin was administered; this threshold was 
chosen to attain a false positive rate below 1 in 
1000 and a false negative rate below 1 in 10 mil-
lion for the clinical threshold of 30,000 mf per 
milliliter,5 below which no neurologic serious ad-
verse events were observed in previous studies.9-11 
Two weeks after initiation of the study, after 
7065 participants had been assessed, a case of 
conjunctival hemorrhage, as described previous-
ly,12 occurred in a participant who had an L. loa 
microfilarial density of 24,599 mf per milliliter, 
as assessed by LoaScope testing. For potential 
safety reasons, the risk threshold was decreased 
to 20,000 mf per milliliter for the remainder of 
the study.
Thick blood smears with a calibrated volume 
of 50 μl were obtained as a backup for the blood 
samples that could not be analyzed with a Loa-
Scope; the blood smears were used to identify 
and quantify Mansonella perstans microfilariae 
and to corroborate the accuracy of the LoaScope. 
The blood smears were examined by two micros-
copists who were unaware of the LoaScope re-
sults. Dried blood spots were collected on filter 
paper and archived at a storage temperature of 
−80°C. To assess exposure to O. volvulus, the SD 
Bioline Onchocerciasis IgG4 Rapid Test (Standard 
Diagnostics) was used to determine the presence 
of anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibodies in 10-μl eluates 
derived from each blood spot.13,14 The results 
were examined and recorded 24 hours after the 
eluates were dropped into the test sample well.
Monitoring of Posttreatment Adverse 
Reactions
Adverse events were monitored by two surveil-
lance teams, each of which included a physician 
and a driver, with the assistance of selected 
community members and local nurses. The sur-
veillance teams visited each village on days 1, 2, 3, 
and 6 after treatment, examined all participants 
who reported adverse events, and provided treat-
ment for symptoms when clinically indicated. In 
addition, the teams toured the entire community 
by car to identify additional participants with 
posttreatment symptoms. All participants with a 
potential posttreatment adverse event underwent 
systematic evaluation, which was performed with 
the use of a standardized form (Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A Karnofsky perfor-
mance status score was assigned to each patient 
at the time of examination (scores range from 
0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better 
functional status). A global adverse-event sever-
ity grade was assigned retrospectively to each 
person who presented with an adverse event; 
grade 1 indicated mild symptoms not requiring 
intervention; grade 2, moderate symptoms with 
local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
grade 3, severe symptoms limiting self-care ac-
tivities of daily living; grade 4, severe symptoms 
requiring hospitalization; and grade 5, death. 
Clinical management was based on reference 
guidelines.15
Statistical Analysis
Medians and interquartile ranges were used to 
indicate the central tendency and dispersion of 
the data. Multivariable logistic regression was 
used to examine associations between individual 
factors (sex, age, L. Loa microfilarial density [as 
assessed by LoaScope testing], presence of anti-

Ov16 IgG4 antibodies, and presence of M. perstans 
microfilariae [as assessed by thick blood smear 
microscopy]) and the occurrence of adverse 
events. The logistic-regression coefficients were 
used to calculate population-attributable frac-
tions.16 Thick blood smear microscopy was used 
as the reference standard in the assessment of 
the specificity and negative predictive value of 
LoaScope testing.
Results
Population Characteristics
A total of 16,259 participants were examined 
during the test-and-not-treat process (Fig. 1). 
The median age of the examined populations in 
the various health areas ranged from 17 to 26 
years. The sex distribution was relatively equal 
(48% male). The prevalence of onchocerciasis in 
the six health areas varied from 15.3 to 29.9%. 
The prevalence of L. loa microfilaremia varied 
from 15.3 to 22.8%, and the percentage of par-
ticipants with an L. loa microfilarial density 
greater than 20,000 mf per milliliter of blood, as 
assessed by LoaScope testing, ranged from 1.3% 
in the Ngoya health area to 2.4% in the Nlong 
and Ekekam III health areas (Table 1, and Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test-and-Not-Treat Process
The number of participants examined per village 
per day was typically between 50 and 100. The 
mean time from finger prick to the LoaScope 
result was 2 to 3 minutes. The LoaScope results 
were immediately available for 16,099 of 16,259 
participants (99.0%) and were delayed for 160 
participants (1.0%) because of technical problems 
that led to the use of thick blood smear micros-
copy to determine the microfilarial density. 
Ivermectin was administered in 15,522 partici-
pants (95.5%), all of whom had an L. loa micro-
filarial density below the risk threshold.
A total of 737 participants (4.5%) were ex-
cluded from ivermectin distribution: 340 (2.1%)

were excluded because the L. loa microfilarial 
density was above the risk threshold, 228 (1.4%) 
were excluded because of poor health (signs or 
symptoms consistent with a serious acute or 
chronic concomitant illness) or inebriation, and 
169 (1.0%) were excluded because they were preg-
nant or breast-feeding. The percentage of ex-
cluded participants per village varied from 0 to 
15.1% (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
All excluded participants (except pregnant women) 
received 400 mg of albendazole. The median 
treatment coverage in the six health areas was 
55% of the total population (interquartile range 
among villages, 42.9 to 64.1) and 64% of the 
target population.
The prevalence of onchocerciasis was 22.0% 
among the participants who received ivermectin, 
25.4% among the women who were excluded 
because of pregnancy or illness, and 33.5% 
among the participants with an L. loa microfilar-
ial density above the risk threshold. Thus, par-
ticipants potentially infected with O. volvulus who 
did not receive treatment with ivermectin be-
cause of L. loa microfilaremia represented 0.7% 
of the examined population.
Frequency and Types of Adverse Events
Among the 15,522 participants who received 
ivermectin, 934 (6.0%) presented for evaluation 
of posttreatment adverse events. The incidence 
of adverse events decreased slightly from 6.6% 
(464 of 7065 participants) to 5.6% (470 of 8457 
participants) (P<0.001) after the risk threshold 
was lowered from 26,000 to 20,000 mf per milli-
liter of blood. A total of 2818 adverse events 
were recorded; dermatologic manifestations were 
the most common adverse events, followed by 
systemic and rheumatologic manifestations (Ta-
ble 2). A total of 869 participants (93.0%) had a 
Karnofsky performance status score of 90, and 
65 (7.0%) had a score of 80. Among the partici-
pants who presented with posttreatment adverse 
events, a global adverse-event severity grade of 
1 was assigned to 88 (9.4%), a grade of 2 was 
assigned to 843 (90.3%), and a grade of 3 was 
assigned to 3 (0.3%). The 3 participants with 
grade 3 adverse events were female; were 6, 63, 
and 70 years old; and were bedridden during the 
first visit by the medical team owing to head-
ache, myalgias and arthralgias, and abdominal 
pain, respectively. Two participants had no labo-
ratory evidence of onchocerciasis or loiasis, and 
1 had a positive IgG4 test result for the Ov16 
antigen and had an L. loa microfilarial density of 
21,560 mf per milliliter. No hospitalizations 
(grade 4 adverse events) or deaths (grade 5 ad-
verse event) were reported. All adverse events 
resolved within 1 week after onset without fur-
ther treatment or with basic supportive therapy 
(antihistamines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs, or acetaminophen).

of anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibodies were assessed in 
888 of the 934 participants who reported an 
adverse event, among whom 384 (43.2%) had 
neither L. loa microfilaremia nor anti-Ov16 IgG4 
antibodies, 198 (22.3%) had only L. loa micro-
filaremia, 212 (23.9%) had only anti-Ov16 IgG4 
antibodies, and 94 (10.6%) had both L. loa micro-
filaremia and anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibodies. Multi-
variable regression analysis showed that adverse 
events occurred significantly more frequently 
among older participants, female participants, 
and participants with either L. loa microfilare-
mia or anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibodies (Fig. 2). The 
risk of adverse events associated with the pres-
ence of anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibodies was similar 
to the risk associated with an L. loa microfilarial 
density of 1 to 8000 mf per milliliter of blood 
(odds ratios of 1.61 and 1.71, respectively) and 
was approximately half the risk associated with 
an L. loa microfilarial density of 8001 to 20,000 
mf per milliliter (odds ratio of 3.00). The risk of 
adverse events associated with both L. loa micro-
filaremia and the presence of anti-Ov16 IgG4 
antibodies was similarly increased among par-
ticipants with an L. loa microfilarial density of 1 
to 8000 mf per milliliter (odds ratio of 2.47) and 
among participants with an L. loa microfilarial 
density of 8001 to 20,000 mf per milliliter (odds 
ratio of 2.57). Population-attributable fractions 
of adverse events were 8.0% for an L. loa micro-
filarial density of 1 to 8000 mf per milliliter, 
8.3% for an L. loa microfilarial density of 8001 
to 20,000 mf per milliliter, and 12.2% for the 
presence of anti-Ov16 IgG4 antibodies.

Test-and-Not-Treat Strategy for Onchocerciasis
microscopic examination of thick blood smears 
Fig. 3). The specificity of LoaScope testing to 
provide a measurement of an L. loa microfilarial 
density below 20,000 mf per milliliter of blood 
in a person for whom thick blood smear micros-
copy indicated an L. loa microfilarial density be-
low 20,000 mf per milliliter of blood was 99.7% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 99.6 to 99.8), and 
the negative predictive value was 99.7% (95% CI, 
99.6 to 99.7).
Discussion
The extension of ivermectin-based mass drug 
administration to areas in which onchocerciasis 
is hypoendemic and loiasis is coendemic re-
mains a large obstacle to the success of oncho-
cerciasis elimination programs in Africa. In the 
current study, a LoaScope-based test-and-not-
treat strategy was used to safely treat more than 
15,000 persons with ivermectin in such an area. 
Despite an initial reticence among the people in 
some villages to participate on account of the 
memory of serious adverse events (including 
deaths) that occurred in 1999, a total of 16,259 
of the 22,842 persons 5 years of age or older 
recorded during the initial census (71.2%) par-
ticipated in the test-and-not-treat campaign. 
This rate of participation suggests that test-and-
not-treat is an acceptable strategy even in popu-
lations with a history of ivermectin-related seri-
ous adverse events. We believe that fear of 
serious adverse events, although not formally 
assessed, was probably the main reason for non-
participation.
During the first mass drug administration 
campaign in the Okola health district in 1999, a 
total of 23 cases of neurologic serious adverse 
events, including 3 deaths, were recorded among 
the 6000 persons who received ivermectin before 
mass drug administration was stopped.17 The 
incidence of neurologic serious adverse events 
that occurred within 1 week after treatment with 
ivermectin was 38 per 10,000 persons, and the 
incidence of death resulting from adverse events 
that started within 1 week after treatment with 
ivermectin was 5 per 10,000 persons. Extrapola-
tion of these data to the population enrolled in 
the current study shows that approximately 62 
cases of neurologic serious adverse events and 
8 deaths would have been anticipated.
Although 6.0% of the participants reported 
ivermectin-associated adverse events during the 
test-and-not-treat campaign, the percentage was 
lower than that typically observed after ivermec-
tin-based mass drug administration for onchocer-
ciasis in areas in which loiasis is not endemic 
(13.1% among persons in southeast Nigeria18; 
12% and 20% in northern Cameroon in areas 
where onchocerciasis is mesoendemic and hy-
perendemic, respectively19; and 21.4% in eastern 
Sudan)20 and much lower than the 26.3% record-
ed in a neighboring area of central Cameroon 
where L. loa infection is endemic.2 The most 
likely explanation for this finding is that oncho-
cerciasis is hypoendemic to mesoendemic in 
Okola.
LoaScope operators underwent a 1-hour train-
ing session 2 weeks before the field operations. 
This training sufficed for the entire study, and 
the teams noted the ease of use and reliability of 
the device despite daily use and demanding field 
conditions. Because L. loa microfilariae show a

According to Individual Factors.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between 
individual factors and the occurrence of adverse events. The dotted line (odds 
ratio of 1) represents an absence of association. Constant (odds ratio of 0.017) 
represents the odds ratio of adverse events when all covariates are set to 
zero. L. loa microfilarial density was measured as the number of L. loa micro‑
filariae (mf) per milliliter of blood. Ov16 IgG4+ denotes a positive test result 
for IgG4 antibodies against the Ov16 antigen, and Ov16 IgG4− a negative 
test result for IgG4 antibodies against the Ov16 antigen. I bars indicate 
95% confidence intervals.

daytime periodicity,21 LoaScope examinations 
(and treatment) started at 10 a.m. and ended at 
4 p.m. Despite this limitation, up to 162 persons 
were examined per village per day.
Given the low percentage of persons (2.4%) in 
the total population who were excluded from 
ivermectin distribution and the proposed imple-
mentation of the test-and-not-treat strategy in 
areas where onchocerciasis is hypoendemic and 
mesoendemic, the persons who were excluded 
are unlikely to be an epidemiologically signifi-
cant reservoir of O. volvulus microfilariae at the 
community level. Nevertheless, some excluded 
persons are likely to be infected with O. volvulus 
and, for ethical reasons, should be treated with 
effective and safe drug regimens, particularly in 
the clinical setting of manifestations of oncho-
cerciasis. Although a 4-to-6-week course of 
doxycycline, a regimen known to have macro-
filaricidal activity against O. volvulus22 but not 
L. loa,23 is impractical at the community level, 
this regimen could be used in this context. The 
identification of persons who were excluded 
from ivermectin distribution in the current study 
and the provision of doxycycline treatment for 
those persons are ongoing.
In summary, this test-and-not-treat strategy 
based on a scalable point-of-contact tool that 
allows for the rapid identification (and exclusion 
from ivermectin-based treatment) of persons at 
risk for serious adverse events related to L. loa 
infection has enabled district-level community 
treatment of onchocerciasis. Although this test-
and-not-treat strategy was motivated by the need 
to tackle the problem of hypoendemic onchocer-
ciasis in Central Africa, it could also be consid-
ered for other areas in which onchocerciasis and 
loiasis are coendemic. Many, but not all, areas in 
which onchocerciasis is mesoendemic or hyper-
endemic are already covered by community- 
directed treatment with ivermectin; a test-and-
not-treat strategy would target persons who have 
not previously received ivermectin and persons 
who are routinely nonadherent to treatments.

Figure 3. Cumulative Frequency Distribution of L. loa Microfilarial Density 
in the Tested Population.
Cutoff 1 (8000 mf per milliliter of blood) was used for information relevant 
to an increased likelihood of adverse events provided to each participant; 
all persons with an L. loa microfilarial density between cutoff 1 and cutoff 
3 during the first 2 weeks of the study and at cutoff 2 after the first 2 weeks 
were told — before ivermectin treatment was proposed — that they might 
have a mild adverse event. For persons with an L. loa microfilarial density 
below cutoff 1, ivermectin treatment was just proposed, with no other spe‑
cific message. Cutoff 2 and cutoff 3 were the risk thresholds that were used 
to exclude persons from ivermectin distribution. Two weeks after initiation 
of the study, the initial risk threshold of 26,000 mf per milliliter (cutoff 3) 
was lowered to 20,000 mf per milliliter (cutoff 2) after a case of conjuncti‑
val hemorrhage occurred in a participant who had an L. loa microfilarial 
density of 24,599 mf per milliliter, as assessed by LoaScope testing. The 
right tails of the distribution of L. loa microfilarial density were censored 
for counts above 50,000 mf per milliliter.
