Intelligence is highly heritable1 and a major determinant of human health and well-being2. 
Recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified 24 genomic loci linked to variation in 
intelligence3–7, but much about its genetic underpinnings remains to be discovered. Here, we 
present the largest genetic association study of intelligence to date (N=269,867), identifying 
205 associated genomic loci (190 novel) and 1,016 genes (939 novel) via positional 
mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, chromatin interaction 
mapping, and gene-based association analysis. We find enrichment of genetic effects in 
conserved and coding regions and associations with 146 nonsynonymous exonic variants. 
Associated genes are strongly expressed in the brain, specifically in striatal medium spiny 
neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gene-set analyses implicate pathways related 
to nervous system development and synaptic structure. We confirm previous strong genetic 
correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results 
suggest protective effects of intelligence for Alzheimer’s disease and ADHD, and 
bidirectional causation with pleiotropic effects for schizophrenia. These results are a major 
step forward in understanding the neurobiology of cognitive function as well as genetically 
related neurological and psychiatric disorders.
We performed a genome-wide association (GWAS) meta-analysis of 14 independent 
epidemiological cohorts of European ancestry and 9,295,118 genetic variants passing quality

 control (Table 1; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1). A flowchart of the study 
methodology is presented in Supplementary Figure 2 and additional details of the methods 
and results are presented in the Supplementary Note.
Intelligence was assessed using various neurocognitive tests, primarily gauging fluid 
domains of cognitive functioning (Supplementary Information 1.1–1.2). Despite variation in 
form and content, cognitive test scores display a positive manifold of correlations, a robust 
empirical phenomenon that is observed in multiple populations8. Statistically, the variance 
common across cognitive tasks can be modeled as a latent factor denoted as g (the general 
factor of intelligence)9,10. In addition, twin- and family studies show strong genetic 
correlations across diverse cognitive domains11, suggesting pleiotropy, and across levels of 
ability11, substantiating the view of general intelligence as an aetiological continuum (with 
rare syndromic forms of severe intellectual disability being the exception12). Additionally, g-
factors extracted from different sets of cognitive tests correlate very strongly (>.9813,14), 
supporting the universality of g15,16. In meta-analyzing cognitive scores obtained using a 
variety of tests, we aim to boost the statistical power to detect genetic variants underlying g, 
which are likely to have pleiotropic effects across multiple domains of cognitive functioning.
Despite sample and methodological variations, genetic correlations (rg) between cohorts 
were considerable (mean=0.67), and there was no evidence of heterogeneity between 
cohorts in the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations (Supplementary Table 2; 
Supplementary Results 2.1). Age-stratified meta-analyses indicated high genetic correlations 
(rg>0.62), and comparable heritability across age, as captured by the SNPs included in the 
analysis (h2SNP=0.19–0.22) (Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Results 2.2). The full 
sample h2SNP was 0.19 (SE=0.01), in line with previous findings4,5, and an LD score 
intercept17 of 1.08 (SE=0.02) indicated that most of the inflation (λGC=1.92) could be 
explained by polygenic signal6 (Supplementary Table 4; Supplementary Figure 3).
In the meta-analysis, 12,110 variants indexed by 242 lead SNPs in approximate linkage 
equilibrium (r2<0.1) reached genome-wide significance (GWS; P<5×10−8) (Figure 1a; 
Supplementary Tables 5–7; Supplementary Figures 4–5). These were located in 205 distinct 
genomic loci (Supplementary Results 2.3.1). We tested for replication using the proxy 
phenotype of educational attainment, which is correlated phenotypically (r=~0.40)18 and 
genetically (r=~0.70)19 with intelligence. We confirmed this high genetic correlation 
(rg=0.73) and observed sign concordance with educational attainment for 93% of GWS 
SNPs (P<1×10−300), with replication for 48 loci (Supplementary Results 2.3.2; 
Supplementary Table 8). Using polygenic score prediction20,21, the current results explain 
up to 5.2% of the variance in intelligence in four independent samples (Supplementary Table 
9, Supplementary Results 2.3.3).
We observed enrichment for heritability of SNPs in conserved regions (P=2.01×10−12), 
coding regions (P=1.67×10−6), and H3K9ac histone regions/peaks (P<6.26×10−5), and 
among common (minor allele frequency > 0.3) variants (Figure 1b; Supplementary Results 
2.3.4; Supplementary Table 10; Supplementary Figures 6–7). Conserved and regulatory 
regions have previously been implicated in cognitive functioning22 but coding regions have 
not.

 Functional annotation of all candidate SNPs in the associated loci (SNPs with an r2≧0.6 with 
one of the independent significant SNPs, a suggestive P-value (P<1×10−5) and a 
MAF>0.0001; n=21,368) showed that these were mostly intronic/intergenic (Supplementary 
Table 6; Figure 1), yet 146 (81 GWS) SNPs were exonic non-synonymous (ExNS) 
(Supplementary Table 11, Supplementary Results 2.3.5). Convergent evidence of strong 
association (Z=9.49) and the highest observed probability of a deleterious protein effect 
(CADD23 score=34) was found for rs13107325. This missense mutation (MAF=0.065, 
P=2.23×10−21) in SLC39A8 was the lead SNP in locus 71 and the ancestral allele C was 
associated with higher scores on intelligence measures. The effect sizes for ExNS were 
individually small, with each effect allele accounting for a difference of 0.01 to 0.08 
standard deviations. Supplementary Tables 6 and 11 and Supplementary Results 2.3.5 
present a detailed catalog of variants in the associated genomic loci.
To link the associated variants to genes, we applied three gene-mapping strategies 
implemented in FUMA24. Positional gene-mapping aligned SNPs to 522 genes by genomic 
location, eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) gene-mapping matched cis-eQTL SNPs to 
684 genes whose expression levels they influence, and chromatin interaction mapping 
annotated SNPs to 227 genes based on three-dimensional DNA-DNA interactions (Figure 2; 
Supplementary Results 2.3.6; Supplementary Figures 8–9; Supplementary Tables 12–14). 
This resulted in 859 unique mapped genes, 435 of which were implicated by at least two 
mapping strategies and 139 by all three (Figure 3). Although not all of these genes are 
certain to have a role in intelligence, they point to potential functional links for the GWAS 
associated variants and give higher credibility to genes with convergent evidence of 
association from multiple sources. The FUMA-mapped genes were enriched for brain tissue 
expression and several regulatory biological gene-sets (Supplementary Results 2.3.6). 
Fifteen genes are particularly notable as they are implicated via chromatin interactions 
between two independent genomic risk loci (Figure 2; Supplementary Results 2.3.6). Cross-
locus interactions implicated ELAVL2, PTCH1, ATF4, FBXL17, and MAN2A1 in left 
ventricle of the heart tissue, SATB2 in liver tissue, and MEF2C in 5 tissues. Multiple 
interactions in multiple tissue types were seen for a cluster of 8 genes on chromosome 6 
encoding zinc finger proteins and histones.
We performed genome-wide gene-based association analysis (GWGAS) using MAGMA25 
to estimate aggregate associations based on all SNPs in a gene (whereas FUMA annotates 
individually significant SNPs to genes). GWGAS identified 507 associated genes (Figure 3a; 
Supplementary Results 2.4.1; Supplementary Table 15), of which 350 were also mapped by 
FUMA (Figure 3b). In total, 105 genes were implicated by all four strategies 
(Supplementary Table 16).
In gene-set analysis, six Gene Ontology26 gene-sets were significantly associated with 
intelligence: neurogenesis (P=4.78×10−7), neuron differentiation (P=4.82×10−6), central 
nervous system neuron differentiation (P=3.31×10−6), regulation of nervous system 
development (P=9.30×10−7), positive regulation of nervous system development 
(P=1.00×10−6), and regulation of synapse structure or activity (P=5.42×10−6) 
(Supplementary Results 2.4.2; Supplementary Tables 17–18). Conditional analysis indicated 
that there were three independent associations, regulation of nervous system development,

 central nervous system neuron differentiation, and regulation of synapse structure or activity, 
which together accounted for the associations of the other sets.
Linking gene-based P-values to tissue-specific gene-sets, we observed strong associations 
with gene expression across multiple brain areas (Figure 3c; Supplementary Results 2.4.2; 
Supplementary Table 19), particularly the frontal cortex (P=3.10×10−9). In brain single-cell 
expression gene-set analyses, we found significant associations of striatal medium spiny 
neurons (P=2.02×10−14) and pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampal (P=5.67×10−11) 
and cortical somatosensory regions (P=2.72×10−9) (Figure 3d; Supplementary Results 2.4.2; 
Supplementary Table 20). Conditional analysis showed that the independent association 
signal in brain cells was driven by medium spiny neurons, neuroblasts, and pyramidal CA1 
neurons.
Intelligence has been associated with a wide variety of human behaviors15 and brain 
anatomy27. Confirming previous reports5,6, we observed negative genetic correlations with 
ADHD (rg=−0.36, P=4.58×10−23), depressive symptoms (rg=−0.27, P=6.20×10−10), 
Alzheimer’s disease (rg=−0.27, P=2.03×10−5), and schizophrenia (rg=−0.21, P=3.82×10−17), 
and positive correlations with longevity (rg=0.43, P=7.96×10−8) and autism (rg=0.25, 
P=3.14×10−7), among others (Supplementary Table 21; Supplementary Figure 10). 
Comparison with previous GWAS28 supported these correlations, showing numerous shared 
genetic variants across phenotypes (Supplementary Results 2.5; Supplementary Tables 22–
23). Low enrichment (87 of 1,518 genes, P=0.05) was found for genes previously linked to 
intellectual disability or developmental delay, indicating largely distinct biological 
processes. However, our results extend previous genetic research on normal variation in 
general intelligence, as catalogued in Supplementary Tables 24–25.
We used Generalized Summary-statistic-based Mendelian Randomization29 to test for 
potential credible causal associations between intelligence and genetically correlated traits 
(Supplementary Results 2.5.3; Supplementary Figures 11–12; Supplementary Table 26). We 
observed a strong bidirectional effect of cognitive ability on educational attainment 
(bxy=0.549, P<1×10−320) and of educational attainment on intelligence (byx=0.480, 
P=6.85×10−82). Such findings are consistent with previous studies implicating bidirectional 
causal effects30,31. There was also a bidirectional association showing a strong protective 
effect of intelligence on schizophrenia (OR=0.50, bxy=−0.685, P=2.02×10−57) and a 
relatively smaller reverse effect (byx= −0.214, P=4.19×10−52), with additional evidence for 
pleiotropy (Supplementary Results 2.5.3). A number of previous reports support both a 
causal link and genetic overlap between these phenotypes32,33. Our results also suggested 
that higher intelligence had a protective effect on ADHD (OR=0.48, bxy=−0.734, 
P=2.57×10−46) and Alzheimer’s disease (OR=0.65, bxy=−0.435, P=3.59×10−14), but was 
associated with higher risk of autism (OR=1.38, bxy=0.321, P=1.12×10−3).
In the present study, we have affirmed and expanded existing knowledge of the genetics of 
general intelligence, identifying 190 novel loci and 939 novel associated genes and 
replicating previous associations with 15 loci and 77 genes. The combined strategies of 
functional annotation and gene-mapping using biological data resources provide extensive 
information on the likely consequences of relevant genetic variants and put forward a rich

 set of plausible gene targets and biological mechanisms for functional follow-up. Gene-set 
analyses contribute novel insight into underlying neurobiological pathways, confirming the 
importance of brain-expressed genes and neurodevelopmental processes in fluid domains of 
intelligence and pointing towards the involvement of specific cell types. Our results indicate 
overlap in the genetic processes involved in both cognitive functioning and neurological and 
psychiatric traits and provide suggestive evidence of causal associations that may drive these 
correlations. These results are important for understanding the biological underpinnings of 
cognitive functioning and contribute to our understanding of related neurological and 
psychiatric disorders.
Online Methods
Study Cohorts
The meta-analysis included new and previously reported GWAS summary statistics from 14 
cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB), Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT), Rotterdam 
Study (RS), Generation R Study (GENR), Swedish Twin Registry (STR), Spit for Science 
(S4S), High-IQ/Health and Retirement Study (HiQ/HRS), Twins Early Development Study 
(TEDS), Danish Twin Registry (DTR), IMAGEN, Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study 
(BLTS), Netherlands Study of Cognition, Environment and Genes (NESCOG), Genes for 
Good (GfG), and the Swedish Twin Studies of Aging (STSA). All samples were obtained 
from epidemiological cohorts ascertained for research on a variety of physical and 
psychological outcomes. Participants ranged from children to older adults, with older 
samples being screened for cognitive decline to exclude the possibility of dementia affecting 
performance on cognitive tests.
Different measures of intelligence were assessed in each cohort but were all operationalized 
to index a common latent g factor underlying multiple dimensions of cognitive functioning. 
With the exception of HiQ/HRS, all cohorts extracted a single sum score, mean score, or 
factor score from a multidimensional set of cognitive performance tests and used this 
normally-distributed score as the phenotype in a covariate-adjusted (e.g. age, sex, ancestry 
principal components) GWAS using linear regression methods. For HiQ/HRS, a logistic 
regression GWAS was run with “case” status reflecting whether participants were drawn 
from an extreme-sampled population of very high intelligence (i.e. at the upper ~0.03% of 
the tail of the normal distribution) versus an epidemiological sample of unselected 
population “controls”. Detailed descriptions of the samples, measures, genotyping, quality 
control, and analysis procedures for each cohort are provided in the Supplementary Note 
(Supplementary Information 1.1–1.2), Supplementary Table 1, and in the Life Sciences 
Reporting Summary.
Meta-analysis
Stringent quality control measures were applied to the summary statistics for each GWAS 
cohort before combining. All files were checked for data integrity and accuracy. SNPs were 
filtered from further analysis if they met any of the following criteria: imputation quality 
(INFO/R2) score < 0.6, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) P < 5×10−6, study-specific 
minor allele frequency (MAF) corresponding to a minor allele count (MAC) < 100, and

 mismatch of alleles or allele frequency difference greater than 20% from the Haplotype 
Reference Consortium (HRC) genome reference panel16. Some cohorts used more stringent 
criteria (see Supplementary Information 1.1). Indels and SNPs that were duplicated, multi-
allelic, monomorphic, or ambiguous (A/T or C/G with a MAF >0.4) were also excluded. 
Visual inspection of the distribution of the summary statistics was completed, and 
Manhattan plots and QQ plots were created for the cleaned summary statistics from each 
cohort (Supplementary Figure 1).
The SNP association P-values from the GWAS cohorts were meta-analyzed with METAL34 
(see URLs) in two phases. First, we meta-analyzed all cohorts with quantitative phenotypes 
(all except HiQ/HRS) using a sample-size weighted scheme. In the second phase, we added 
the HiQ/HRS study results to the first phase results, weighting each set of summary statistics 
by their respective non-centrality parameter (NCP). This method improves power when 
using an extreme case sampling design such as HiQ35 and provides a comparable metric 
with which to combine information from different analytic designs while accounting for 
their differences in power/effective sample size. NCPs were estimated using the Genetic 
Power Calculator36, as described by Coleman et al.37. After combining all data, meta-
analysis results were further filtered to exclude any variants with N < 50,000. We 
additionally included a random-effects meta-analysis for each phase, as implemented in 
METAL, to evaluate potential heterogeneity in the SNP association statistics between 
cohorts.
The X chromosome was treated separately in the meta-analysis because imputed genotypes 
were not available for the X chromosome in the largest cohort (UKB), and there was little 
overlap between the UKB called genotypes and imputed data from other cohorts (NSNPs < 
500). We therefore included only the called X chromosome variants in UKB for these 
analyses after performing X-specific quality control steps38.
We conducted a series of meta-analyses on subsets of the full sample using the same 
methods as above. Age group-specific meta-analyses were run in the cohorts of children 
(age < 17; GENR, TEDS, IMAGEN, BLTS; N=9,814), young adults (age ~17–18; S4S, 
STR; N=6,033), adults (age > 18, primarily middle-aged or older: UKB, RS, DTR, 
NESCOG, STSA; N=204,228), and older adults (mean age > 60, RS, DTR, STSA;

 N=8,323), excluding studies whose samples overlapped child/young adult and adult groups 
(COGENT, HiQ/HRS, GfG; N=49,792). To create independent discovery samples for use in 
polygenic score validation, we also conducted meta-analyses with a “leave-one-out” strategy 
in which summary statistics from four validation datasets were, respectively, excluded from 
the meta-analysis (see Polygenic Scoring, below).
Cohort Heritability and Genetic Correlation
LD score regression17 was used to estimate genomic inflation and heritability of the 
intelligence phenotypes in each of the 14 cohorts using their post-quality control summary 
statistics, and to estimate the cross-cohort genetic correlations39. Pre-calculated LD scores 
from the 1000 Genomes European reference population were obtained online (see URLs). 
Genetic correlations were calculated on HapMap3 SNPs only. LD score regression was also 
used on the age subgroup meta-analyses to estimate heritability and cross-age genetic 
correlations.
Genomic Risk Loci Definition
Independently associated loci from the meta-analysis were defined using FUMA24 (see 
URLs), an online platform for functional mapping of genetic variants. We first identified 
independent significant SNPs which had a Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significant 
two-tailed P-value (P<5×10−8) and represented signals that were independent from each 
other at r2<0.6. These SNPs were further represented by lead SNPs, which are a subset of 
the independent significant SNPs that are in approximate linkage equilibrium with each 
other at r2<0.1. We then defined associated genomic loci by merging any physically 
overlapping lead SNPs (linkage disequilibrium [LD] blocks <250kb apart). Borders of the 
associated genomic loci were defined by identifying all SNPs in LD (r2≧0.6) with one of the 
independent significant SNPs in the locus, and the region containing all of these candidate 
SNPs was considered to be a single independent genomic locus. All LD information was 
calculated from UK Biobank genotype data.
Proxy-replication with Educational Attainment
We conducted GWAS of educational attainment, an outcome with a high genetic correlation 
with intelligence5, in a non-overlapping European subset of the UKB sample (N=188,435) 
who did not complete the intelligence measure. Educational attainment was coded as 
maximum years of education completed, using the same methods as earlier analyses40 and 
GWAS was conducted using the same quality control and analytic procedures as described 
for the UKB intelligence phenotype (Supplementary Information 1.1.1). To test replication 
of the SNPs with this proxy phenotype, we performed a sign concordance test for all GWS 
SNPs from the meta-analysis using the two-tailed exact binomial test. For each independent 
genomic locus, we considered it to be evidence for replication if the lead SNP or another 
correlated SNP in the region was sign concordant with the corresponding SNP in the 
intelligence meta-analysis and had a two-tailed P-value of association with educational 
attainment smaller than 0.05/242 independent tests=0.0002.

 Polygenic Scoring
We calculated polygenic scores (PGS) based on the SNP effect sizes of the leave-one-out 
meta-analyses, from which four cohorts were (separately) excluded and reserved for score 
validation. These included a child (GENR), young adult (S4S), and adult sample (RS). We 
also included the UKB-wb sample to test for validation in a very large (N = 53,576) cohort 
with the greatest phenotypic similarity to the largest contributor to the meta-analysis 
statistics (UKB-ts), in order to maximize potential predictive power. PGS were calculated on 
the genotype data using LDpred21, a Bayesian PGS method that utilizes a prior on effect size 
distribution to remodel the SNP effect size and account for LD, and PRSice20, a PLINK41-
based program that automates optimization of the set of SNPs included in the PGS based on 
a high-resolution filtering of the GWAS P-value threshold. LDpred PGS were applied to the 
called, cleaned, genotyped variants in each of the validation cohorts with UK Biobank as the 
LD reference panel. PRSice PGS were calculated on hard-called imputed genotypes using P-
value thresholds from 0.0 to 0.5 in steps of 0.001. The explained variance (ΔR2) was derived 
from a linear model in which the GWAS intelligence phenotype was regressed on each PGS 
while controlling for the same covariates as in each cohort-specific GWAS, compared to a 
linear model with GWAS covariates only.
Stratified Heritability
We partitioned SNP heritability using stratified LD Score regression42 in three ways: 1) by 
functional annotation category, 2) by minor allele frequency (MAF) in six percentile bins, 
and 3) by chromosome. Annotations for 28 binary categories of putative functional genomic 
characteristics (e.g. coding or regulatory regions) were obtained from the LD score website 
(see URLs). With this method, enrichment/depletion of heritability in each category is 
calculated as the proportion of heritability attributable to SNPs in the specified category 
divided by the proportion of total SNPs annotated to that category. The Bonferroni-corrected 
significance threshold was .05/56 annotations=.0009.
Functional Annotation of SNPs
Functional annotation of SNPs implicated in the meta-analysis was performed using 
FUMA24 (see URLs). We selected all candidate SNPs in associated genomic loci having an 
r2≧0.6 with one of the independent significant SNPs (see above), a suggestive P-value 
(P<1e-5) and a MAF>0.0001 for annotations. Predicted functional consequences for these 
SNPs were obtained by matching SNPs’ chromosome, base-pair position, and reference and 
alternate alleles to databases containing known functional annotations, including 
ANNOVAR43 categories, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores23, 
RegulomeDB44 (RDB) scores, and chromatin states45,46. ANNOVAR categories identify the 
SNP’s genic position (e.g. intron, exon, intergenic) and associated function. CADD scores 
predict how deleterious the effect of a SNP is likely to be for a protein structure/function, 
with higher scores referring to higher deleteriousness. A CADD score above 12.37 is the 
threshold to be potentially pathogenic23. The RegulomeDB score is a categorical score based 
on information from expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and chromatin marks, ranging 
from 1a to 7 with lower scores indicating an increased likelihood of having a regulatory 
function. Scores are as follows: 1a=eQTL + Transcription Factor (TF) binding + matched TF

accessibility of genomic regions (every 200bp) with 15 categorical states predicted by a 
hidden Markov model based on 5 chromatin marks for 127 epigenomes in the Roadmap 
Epigenomics Project46. A lower state indicates higher accessibility, with states 1–7 referring 
to open chromatin states. We annotated the minimum chromatin state across tissues to SNPs. 
The 15-core chromatin states as suggested by Roadmap are as follows: 1=Active 
Transcription Start Site (TSS); 2=Flanking Active TSS; 3=Transcription at gene 5’ and 3’; 
4=Strong transcription; 5= Weak Transcription; 6=Genic enhancers; 7=Enhancers; 8=Zinc 
finger genes & repeats; 9=Heterochromatic; 10=Bivalent/Poised TSS; 11=Flanking Bivalent/
Poised TSS/Enhancer; 12=Bivalent Enhancer; 13=Repressed PolyComb; 14=Weak 
Repressed PolyComb; 15=Quiescent/Low. Standardized SNP effect sizes were calculated for 
the most impactful SNPs by transforming the sample size-weighted meta-analysis Z score, 
as described by Zhu et al.47.
Gene-mapping
Genome-wide significant loci obtained by the GWAS meta-analysis were mapped to genes 
in FUMA24 using three strategies:
1.
Positional mapping maps SNPs to genes based on physical distance (within a 
10kb window) from known protein coding genes in the human reference 
assembly (GRCh37/hg19).
2.
eQTL mapping maps SNPs to genes with which they show a significant eQTL 
association (i.e. allelic variation at the SNP is associated with the expression 
level of that gene). eQTL mapping uses information from 45 tissue types in 3 
data repositories (GTEx48, Blood eQTL browser49, BIOS QTL browser50), and 
is based on cis-eQTLs which can map SNPs to genes up to 1Mb apart. We used a 
false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 to define significant eQTL associations.
3.
Chromatin interaction mapping was performed to map SNPs to genes when there 
is a three-dimensional DNA-DNA interaction between the SNP region and a 
gene region. Chromatin interaction mapping can involve long-range interactions 
as it does not have a distance boundary. FUMA currently contains Hi-C data of 
14 tissue types from the study of Schmitt et al51. Since chromatin interactions are 
often defined in a certain resolution, such as 40kb, an interacting region can span 
multiple genes. If a SNPs is located in a region that interacts with a region 
containing multiple genes, it will be mapped to each of those genes. To further 
prioritize candidate genes, we selected only interaction-mapped genes in which 
one region involved in the interaction overlaps with a predicted enhancer region 
in any of the 111 tissue/cell types from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project46 and 
Savage et al.

 the other region is located in a gene promoter region (250bp up and 500bp 
downstream of the transcription start site and also predicted by Roadmap to be a 
promoter region). This reduces the number of genes mapped but increases the 
likelihood that those identified will have a plausible biological function. We used 
a FDR of 1×10−5 to define significant interactions, based on previous 
recommendations51 modified to account for the differences in cell lines used 
here.
Functional annotation of mapped genes
Genes implicated by mapping of significant GWAS SNPs were further investigated using the 
GENE2FUNC procedure in FUMA24, which provides hypergeometric tests of enrichment of 
the list of mapped genes in 53 GTEx48 tissue-specific gene expression sets, 7,246 MSigDB 
gene-sets52, and 2,195 GWAS catalog gene-sets28. The Bonferroni-corrected significance 
threshold was 0.05/9,494 gene-sets=5.27×10-6.
Gene-based analysis
SNP-based P-values from the meta-analysis were used as input for the gene-based genome-
wide association analysis (GWGAS). 18,128 protein-coding genes (each containing at least 
1 GWAS SNP) from the NCBI 37.3 gene definitions were used as basis for GWGAS in 
MAGMA25 (see URLs). The Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significance threshold 
was .05/18,128 genes=2.76×10-6.
Gene-set analysis
Results from the GWGAS analyses were used to test for association in three types of 
predefined gene-sets:
1.
7,246 curated gene-sets representing known biological and metabolic pathways 
were derived from 9 data resources, catalogued by and obtained from the 
MsigDB version 5.229 (see URLs)
2.
gene expression values from 53 tissues obtained from GTEx48, log2 transformed 
with pseudocount 1 after winsorization at 50 and averaged per tissue
3.
cell-type specific gene expression in 24 types of brain cells, which were 
calculated following the method described in Skene et al.53 and Coleman et al.37 
Briefly, brain cell-type expression data was drawn from single-cell RNA 
sequencing data from mouse brains. For each gene, the value for each cell-type 
was calculated by dividing the mean Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts 
for the given cell type by the summed mean UMI counts across all cell types. 
Single-cell gene-sets were derived by grouping genes into 40 equal bins by 
specificity of expression.
These gene-sets were tested for association with the GWGAS gene-based test statistics using 
MAGMA. We computed competitive P-values, which represent the test of association for a 
specific gene-set compared to other gene-sets. This method is more robust to Type I error 
than self-contained tests that only test for association of a gene-set against the null 
hypothesis of no association25. The Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold was 
Savage et al.

 0.05/7,323 gene-sets=6.83×10-6. Conditional analyses were performed as a follow-up using 
MAGMA to test whether each significant association observed was independent of all 
others. The association between each gene-set was tested conditional on the most strongly 
associated set, and then - if any substantial (p<.05/number of gene-sets) associations 
remained - by conditioning on the first and second most strongly associated set, and so on 
until no associations remained. Gene-sets that retained their association after correcting for 
other sets were considered to be independent signals. We note that this is not a test of 
association per se, but rather a strategy to identify, among gene-sets with known significant 
associations whose defining genes may overlap, which set(s) are responsible for driving the 
observed association.
Cross-Trait Genetic Correlation
Genetic correlations (rg) between intelligence and 38 phenotypes were computed using LD 
score regression39, as described above, based on GWAS summary statistics obtained from 
publicly available databases (see URLs; Supplementary Table 18). The Bonferroni-corrected 
significance threshold was 0.05/38 traits=1.32×10-3.
GWAS catalog lookup
We used FUMA to identify SNPs with previously reported (P < 5×10−5) phenotypic 
associations in published GWAS listed in the NHGRI-EBI catalog28 which overlapped with 
the genomic risk loci identified in the meta-analysis. As an additional relevant phenotype of 
interest, we examined whether the genes associated with intelligence in this study (by 
FUMA mapping or GWGAS) were overrepresented in a set of 1,518 genes linked to 
intellectual disability and/or developmental delay, as compiled by RegionAnnotater (see 
URLs). Many of these have been identified by non-GWAS sources and are not represented 
in the NHGRI catalog. We tested for enrichment using a hypergeometric test with a 
background set of 19,283 genomic protein-coding genes, as in FUMA. Manual lookups were 
also performed to identify overlapping loci/genes with known previous GWAS of 
intelligence.
Mendelian Randomization
To infer credible causal associations between intelligence and traits that are genetically 
correlated with intelligence, we performed Generalized Summary-data based Mendelian 
Randomization29 (GSMR; see URLs). This method utilizes summary-level data to test for 
causal associations between a putative risk factor (exposure) and an outcome by using 
independent genome-wide significant SNPs as instrumental variables. HEIDI-outlier 
detection was used to filter genetic instruments that show clear pleiotropic effects on both 
the exposure phenotype and the outcome phenotype. We used a threshold p-value of 0.01 for 
the outlier detection analysis in HEIDI which removes 1% of SNPs by chance if there is no 
pleiotropic effect. To test for a potential causal effect of intelligence on various outcomes, 
we selected traits in non-overlapping samples that showed significant genetic correlations 
(rg) with intelligence. We tested for bi-directional causation by repeating the analyses while 
switching the role of each correlated phenotype as an exposure and intelligence as the 
outcome. For each trait, we selected independent (r2=<0.1), GWS lead SNPs as instrumental 
variables in the analyses. For traits with less than 10 GWS lead SNPs (i.e. the minimum

 number of SNPs on which GSMR can perform a reliable analysis), the GWS threshold was 
lowered to 1×10−5, allowing a sufficient number of SNPs to conduct the reverse GSMR 
analysis for former smoker status, autism, and intracranial volume.
The method estimates a putative causal effect of the exposure on the outcome (bxy) as a 
function of the relationship between the SNPs’ effects on the exposure (bzx) and the SNPs’ 
effects on the outcome (bzy), given the assumption that the effect of non-pleiotropic SNPs on 
an exposure (x) should be related to their effect on the outcome (y) in an independent sample 
only via mediation through the phenotypic causal pathway (bxy). The estimated causal effect 
coefficients (bxy) are approximately equal to the natural log odds ratio (OR) for a case-
control trait29. An OR of 2 can be interpreted as a doubled risk compared to the population 
prevalence of a binary trait for every SD increase in the exposure trait. For quantitative traits 
the bxy can be interpreted as a one standard deviation increase explained in the outcome trait 
for every SD increase in the exposure trait. This method can help differentiate the likely 
causal direction of association between two traits but cannot make any statement about the 
intermediate mechanisms involved in any potential causal process.

 Figure 3. Implicated genes, pathways, and tissue- and cell- expression profiles for intelligence in 
269,867 independent individuals.
(a) Manhattan plot of the genome-wide gene-based association analysis (GWGAS). The y-
axis shows the −log10 transformed two-tailed P-value of each gene from a linear model, and 
the chromosomal position on the x-axis. The red dotted line indicates the Bonferroni-
corrected threshold for genome-wide significance of the gene-based test (P<2.76×10−6; 
0.05/18,128 genes), and the blue line indicates the suggestive threshold (P<2.76×10−5; 
0.5/18,128 genes) (b) Venn diagram showing overlap of genes implicated by positional 
mapping, eQTL mapping, chromatin interaction mapping, and GWGAS. (c) Gene 
expression profiles of associated genes in 53 tissue types. The y-axis shows the −log10 
transformed two-tailed P-value of association of GWGAS test statistics with tissue-specific 
gene expression levels in a linear model. Expression data were extracted from the Genotype-
Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. Expression values (RPKM) were log2 transformed with 
pseudocount 1 after winsorization at 50 and averaged per tissue. The dotted blue line 
indicates the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold (P=0.05/7,323 gene-
sets=6.83×10−6). (d) Single-cell gene-expression analysis of genes related to intelligence in 
24 cell-types. The x-axis shows the −log10 transformed two-tailed P-value of association of 
GWGAS test statistics with cell-specific gene expression levels in a linear model. The dotted 
blue line indicates the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold (P=0.05/7,323 gene-
sets=6.83×10−6).
