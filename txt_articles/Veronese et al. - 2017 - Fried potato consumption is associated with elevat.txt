ABSTRACT
Background: Few studies have assessed the association between
potato consumption and mortality.
Objective: We investigated whether potato consumption (including
fried and unfried potatoes) is associated with increased premature
mortality risk in a North American cohort.
Design: A longitudinal analysis included 4440 participants
aged 45–79 y at baseline with an 8-y follow-up from the Oste-
oarthritis Initiative cohort study. Potato consumption (includ-
ing fried and unfried potatoes) was analyzed by using a Block
Brief 2000 food-frequency questionnaire and categorized as
#1 time/mo, 2–3 times/mo, 1 time/wk, 2 times/wk, or $3 times/wk.
Mortality was ascertained through validated cases of death.
To investigate the association between potato consumption
and mortality, Cox regression models were constructed to
estimate HRs with 95% CIs, with adjustment for potential
confounders.
Results: Of the 4400 participants, 2551 (57.9%) were women
with a mean 6 SD age of 61.3 6 9.2 y. During the 8-y follow-
up, 236 participants died. After adjustment for 14 potential base-
line confounders, and taking those with the lowest consumption
of potatoes as the reference group, participants with the highest
consumption of potatoes did not show an increased risk of overall
mortality (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.91). However, subgroup
analyses indicated that participants who consumed fried potatoes
2–3 times/wk (HR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.41) and $3 times/wk
(HR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.15, 4.47) were at an increased risk of
mortality. The consumption of unfried potatoes was not associ-
ated with an increased mortality risk.
Conclusions: The frequent consumption of fried potatoes appears
to be associated with an increased mortality risk. Additional studies
in larger sample sizes should be performed to confirm if overall
potato consumption is associated with higher mortality risk. This
trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00080171.

INTRODUCTION
White potatoes have been a staple food in many traditional diets
of the Western world (1). In recent years, the overall consumption
of potatoes has declined in the United States, but processed potato
intake (e.g., French fries and chips) has dramatically increased (2).
Potatoes are rich in starch and have a high glycemic index, which
has been associated with an increased risk of developing obesity,
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (3). However, com-
pared with other common carbohydrate sources, potatoes have a
low energy density because of their high water content (4). In
addition, potatoes provide other important micronutrients, which
are all associated with a decreased risk of morbidity and mortality
(5). Therefore, potatoes represent a contradictory food because
they contain both macro- and micronutrients with possible ben-
eficial and harmful effects on health.
The literature on potato consumption and common medi-
cal conditions is equivocal. A study that included 3 North
American cohorts reported that greater consumption of potatoes

 (i.e., $7 servings/wk) was associated with a 33% higher risk of
diabetes, independently of several potential confounders (6). In
this study, even the intake of 3 servings/wk was associated with
an increased risk of diabetes of 4% for baked, boiled, or mashed
potatoes, and an increased risk of 19% for French fries (6). The
use of fried potatoes is probably associated with a higher risk of
diabetes and other comorbidities for several reasons, such as
cooking with trans fats (6). These findings were confirmed in the
Nurses’ Health Study (7). On the contrary, a study conducted in
Sweden in 69,313 men and women failed to find any significant
associations between higher potato consumption and the risk of
CVD morbidity and mortality during a 13-y follow-up (8). A
systematic review published in 2016, which included 5 obser-
vational studies in a total of 170,413 healthy subjects, did not
provide any conclusive evidence to suggest an association be-
tween potato intake and the risk of developing obesity, type 2
diabetes, and CVD (9). However, in the same review, the con-
sumption of French fries and fried potatoes was associated
with a slightly higher risk of obesity and diabetes (9). Despite
these previous studies, to the best of our knowledge no previous
study has investigated whether potato consumption is associated
with premature mortality.
Given that potatoes are widely consumed in North America
and Europe, and no data are available on the association with
mortality, the current study aimed to investigate whether a higher
consumption of potatoes is associated with an increased risk of
death in a longitudinal cohort study of men and women par-
ticipating in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). As a secondary
objective, we investigated whether a higher consumption of fried
and unfried potatoes is associated with a higher mortality risk.
METHODS
Data source and subjects
Data were obtained from the OAI database (10), which is
available for public access at http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/. The
specific data sets used were registered during the baseline and
screening evaluations (V00), and mortality data were available
until 96 mo from baseline (V10). The OAI includes patients at
high risk of knee osteoarthritis, who were recruited at 4 clinical
centers in the United States (Baltimore, Maryland; Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; and Columbus, Ohio)
between February 2004 and May 2006. Subjects were eligible if
they 1) had knee osteoarthritis and reported knee pain in a 30-d
period in the past 12 mo or 2) were at high risk of developing
knee osteoarthritis (e.g., overweight or obese, knee injury or
operation, parents or siblings with total knee replacement, fre-
quent knee-bending activities that increase risk, and hand or hip
osteoarthritis) (10).
All of the participants provided written informed consent. The
OAI study protocol was approved by the institutional review
board of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Coordinating Center, Uni-
versity of California at San Francisco. This trial was registered at
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00080171.
Potato consumption (exposure)
Participants’ dietary patterns were analyzed by using the
semiquantitative Block Brief 2000 food-frequency questionnaire
at baseline (11, 12). This validated tool, which contains a list of 70
food items, was designed to assess the individual’s food and bev-
erage consumption over the past year. The frequency of food con-
sumption of the included items was reported at 9 levels of intake
from “never” to “every day.” There were also 7 dietary behavior
questions on food preparation methods and fat intake, 1 question on
fiber intake, and 13 questions with regard to vitamins and minerals.
Potato consumption was assessed through 2 specific questions.
The first question considered the consumption of French fries,
fried potatoes, or hash browns. The second question considered
the consumption of white unfried potatoes, including boiled,
baked, and mashed potatoes and potato salad. Although data on
sweet potatoes were available, this information was not included
due to the different composition between sweet and white po-
tatoes. Potato consumption was categorized into 5 groups from
the 9 available categories because too few participants “never”
consumed potatoes or consumed potatoes “few times” or “.4
times/weekly” during the previous year. Therefore, the 5 cate-
gories were as follows: #1 time/mo, 2–3 times/mo, 1 time/wk,
2 times/wk, and $3 times/wk.
Outcome
The study’s outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. In
the OAI, mortality was confirmed and adjudicated by several
methods (autopsy report, coroner’s report, death certificate
medical records, National Death Index, obituary, or Social Se-
curity Death Index).
Covariates
We identified numerous potential confounders that may in-
fluence the relation between potato consumption and mortality,
including the following: BMI; weekly alcohol consumption, total
energy intake, and adherence to a Mediterranean diet (12, 13);
physical activity evaluated by using the Physical Activity Scale
for the Elderly (14); depressive symptoms evaluated through the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (15); eth-
nicity; smoking habits, educational level, and yearly income
(,$50,000, $$50,000, or missing data); and variables pertain-
ing to physical health status. Validated general health measures
of self-reported comorbidities were assessed by using the modi-
fied Charlson comorbidity score (16). The medical morbidities
that were assessed by using this score included diseases and
disorders common in North Americans such as fractures, heart
attack and failure, stroke, diabetes, and cancer (17).
Statistical analyses
Normal distributions of continuous variables were tested by
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data are shown as means 6
SDs for quantitative measures and as frequencies and percent-
ages for all discrete variables. P values for trends were calcu-
lated by using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for continuous
variables and the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for categori-
cal variables.
Incidence rates are reported as number of deaths per 1000
persons-years. The proportional hazards assumption was checked
by plotting the Schoenfeld residuals compared with time without
any violation and then Cox regression analyses were performed
(18). The basic model was adjusted for age and sex. In addition to

 age and sex, the fully adjusted model adjusted for ethnicity (white
compared with other), BMI (continuous), education (higher
degree compared with lower), smoking habits (current and
previous compared with never), yearly income (categorized as
$$50,000, ,$50,000, or missing data), Physical Activity Scale
for the Elderly (continuous), Charlson comorbidity index
(continuous), daily energy intake (continuous), and Center for
Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (continuous). These
covariates used for adjustment were factors significantly dif-
ferent across potato consumption categories (considering a
P value ,0.10) or significantly associated with death according
to univariate analysis (P , 0.05). We also conducted the same
analyses and investigated the association between the con-
sumption of fried and unfried potatoes and mortality separately.
In these analyses, we added the consumption of unfried potatoes
in the model when conducting the analyses for fried potatoes
and vice versa. In all of the analyses, Cox regression analysis
data are reported as HRs with 95% CIs.
To test the robustness of our analyses, sensitivity analyses were
conducted to evaluate the interaction between potato consump-
tion and selected factors [e.g., sex, race/ethnicity, education,
smoking habits, yearly income, presence or absence of diseases at
baseline, BMI (in kg/m2) $25 or ,25] in predicting mortality,
but no moderator emerged as significant. Multicollinearity
among covariates was assessed by using the variance inflation
factor, with a score of 2 leading to the exclusion of a variable,
but no variable was excluded for this reason.
All of the analyses were performed by using SPSS 17.0 for
Windows (SPSS, Inc.). All of the statistical tests were 2-tailed,
and significance was assumed for a P value ,0.05.
RESULTS
Sample selection
The OAI data set initially included a total of 4796 North
American participants. At baseline, 130 participants were ex-
cluded due to insufficient information on potato consumption and
another 266 had implausible calorie intakes (,800 and .4200 kcal
for men; ,500 and .3500 kcal for women). Thus, 4400 partic-
ipants were eligible for this study (Supplemental Figure 1).
Descriptive characteristics
Of the 4400 participants, there were 2551 women and 1849
men. The mean 6 SD age was 61.3 6 9.2 y (range: 45–79 y).
Most of the participants consumed potatoes (n = 1174; 26.7%)
2–3 times/mo.
Table 1 shows the participants’ characteristics by total potato intake.
Those who consumed potatoes $3 times/wk (reflecting the highest
consumption of potatoes) were older (P-trend , 0.0001), were more
likely to be male (P-trend , 0.0001) and white (P-trend , 0.0001),
and had a lower educational level (P-trend , 0.0001) with
respect to those in the other categories. They were also less
adherent to a Mediterranean diet (P-trend , 0.0001) and had
more comorbidities (P-trend = 0.003) than other participants,
in particular CVDs (Table 1).
Potato consumption and mortality
During the 8-y follow-up, 236 people (5.4% of the baseline
population) died, indicating a global mortality rate of 13 (95% CI:
11–17)/1000 person-years. Table 2 shows the association

 between overall potato consumption and mortality. The non-
adjusted incidence of mortality was 3 times higher in those
consuming the greatest amount of potatoes ($3 times/wk)
compared with those consuming potatoes ,1 time/mo. How-
ever, by using Cox regression analysis, adjusted for 14 potential
baseline confounders, and taking those with the lowest con-
sumption of potatoes as the reference, participants with the
highest consumption of potatoes did not have any increased risk
of mortality (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.91; P = 0.71; Table 2).
Table 3 shows Cox regression analyses for fried and unfried
potatoes with death as the outcome. After adjustment for all
baseline potential confounders, a higher consumption of unfried
potatoes was not associated with any increased risk of death
(HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.55; P = 0.67 for participants con-
suming unfried potatoes $3 times/wk compared with #1 time/mo).
On the contrary, the RR of mortality was more than doubled
among those who consumed fried potatoes .2 times/wk
(HR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.41; P = 0.02) or $3 times/wk
(HR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.15, 4.47; P = 0.02).
DISCUSSION
In this cohort study, we found that, overall, white potato
consumption was not associated with a higher risk of mortality
after adjustment for pertinent confounders. However, the con-
sumption of fried potatoes .2 times/wk was consistently as-
sociated with an increased mortality risk in this population
of older adults.
Overall, in this cohort, the consumption of potatoes was very
high. The great majority of the participants included in the OAI
consumed potatoes $2–3 times/mo, and a third of participants
consumed potatoes $3 times/wk. This intake is in line with the
data in a 2013 report of the USDA, which showed that, on average,
American citizens consumed 115.6 pounds of white potatoes/y,
of which approximately two-thirds are French fries, potato chips,
and other frozen or processed potato products (2). White potatoes
accounted for 30% of the 384.4 pounds/person of vegetable and
legume intakes (2). In our cohort, a higher intake of potatoes was
associated with several other potential mortality risk factors, such
as male sex (19), higher frequency of comorbidities, higher BMI
(20), and lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet score. How-
ever, to our knowledge, it has not been established whether fre-
quent potato consumption is associated with higher mortality risk,
independently of adiposity and other age-associated metabolic
conditions and diseases.
In our study, overall potato consumption was not associated
with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, which is in partial

 agreement with other published data (8). The only study that
addressed mortality was limited by the fact that only CVD
mortality was considered and did not find any association
between a higher consumption of potatoes and CVD-related
death risk (8). It is possible that the high content of fiber, vitamins,
and micronutrients in white potatoes could have counterbalanced
the detrimental effects of their high glycemic index (5). However,
given that this is an emerging field and that our data are pre-
liminary, larger prospective studies are required to further
investigate this relation.
Although overall potato consumption was not related to
mortality, interestingly, our data suggest that the consumption
of fried potatoes is associated with a significantly higher risk
of mortality. The consumption of fried potatoes .2 times/wk
was associated with a more than doubled risk of death in-
dependently of several other confounders. Many factors could
explain these findings. First, French fries and fried potatoes
typically contain high amounts of dietary fat (including trans
fat) and added salt, which may increase the risk of death,
particularly of CVD (21). Second, a higher consumption of
fried potatoes could increase the risk of other chronic diseases,
such as obesity (22, 23), hypertension (24), and diabetes (6),
which are also powerful risk factors for CVD. One epidemio-
logic study conducted in Sweden found no association between
fried potatoe intake and CVD mortality (8). Therefore, more
studies are warranted to understand whether a higher con-
sumption of fried potatoes is associated with higher CVD and
cancer mortality due to higher intakes of trans fatty acids,
oxidized lipids, acrolein, acrylamide, furan, and glycidamide
(25, 26). Third, people who consume fried potatoes more fre-
quently might have other unhealthy dietary habits, such as
increased consumption of processed red meat, salty foods, and
sugar-sweetened beverages, which may increase the risk of
death (27, 28). Finally, a lower socioeconomic status could
play a role in the association between a high consumption of
fried potatoes and mortality. However, in our study, this asso-
ciation was still significant even after we adjusted our analyses
for both educational and income levels, which suggests a
marginal role of socioeconomic status.
Although our data are relatively novel, some limitations should
be noted. The main limitation is that we were not able to assess
cause-specific mortality. Second, we were unable to assess the
influence of biohumoral markers (e.g., inflammation, insulin re-
sistance, oxidative stress) on the association between potato
consumption and mortality. Third, the medical conditions were
self-reported and could have introduced some level of bias. Fourth,
nutritional intake could have suffered from selective and poten-
tially inaccurate recall, and this may have influenced our results.
Finally, because we did not consider changes in dietary habits
between baseline and follow-up, this also could have introduced
bias.
In conclusion, our data suggest that overall potato consump-
tion was not associated with a higher risk of death in a cohort of
North American men and women. On the contrary, frequent
consumption of fried potatoes significantly increased overall
mortality risk. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the role
of potato consumption on cause-specific mortality.
