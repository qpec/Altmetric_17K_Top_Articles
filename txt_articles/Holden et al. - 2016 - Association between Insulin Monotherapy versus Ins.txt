Abstract
Aims
To determine if concomitant metformin reduced the risk of death, major adverse cardiac
events (MACE), and cancer in people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin.
Methods
For this retrospective cohort study, people with type 2 diabetes who progressed to insulin
with or without metformin from 2000 onwards were identified from the UK Clinical Practice
Research Datalink (�7% sample of the UK population). The risks of all-cause mortality,
MACE and incident cancer were evaluated using multivariable Cox models comparing insu-
lin monotherapy with insulin plus metformin. We accounted for insulin dose.
Results
12,020 subjects treated with insulin were identified, including 6,484 treated with monother-
apy. There were 1,486 deaths, 579 MACE (excluding those with a history of large vessel
disease), and 680 cancer events (excluding those in patients with a history of cancer). Cor-
responding event rates were 41.5 (95% CI 39.4–43.6) deaths, 20.8 (19.2–22.5) MACE, and
21.6 (20.0–23.3) cancer events per 1,000 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs)
for people prescribed insulin plus metformin versus insulin monotherapy were 0.60 (95% CI
0.52–0.68) for all-cause mortality, 0.75 (0.62–0.91) for MACE, and 0.96 (0.80–1.15) for can-
cer. For patients who were propensity-score matched, the corresponding aHRs for all-
cause mortality and cancer were 0.62 (0.52–0.75) and 0.99 (0.78–1.26), respectively. For
MACE, the aHR was 1.06 (0.75–1.49) prior to 1,275 days and 1.87 (1.22–2.86) after 1,275
days post-index.

 Conclusions
People with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin plus concomitant metformin had a reduced
risk of death and MACE compared with people treated with insulin monotherapy. There was
no statistically significant difference in the risk of cancer between people treated with insulin
as monotherapy or in combination with metformin.
Introduction
The rate of insulin use in type 2 diabetes increased more than six-fold in the UK between 1991
and 2010 [1]. In 1991, almost all patients using insulin for type 2 diabetes did so as monother-
apy [1]. By 2010, 42% of these patients were prescribed insulin in combination with metformin;
the percentage treated with insulin monotherapy decreased to 37% [1].
A position statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association
for the Study of Diabetes recommends that metformin therapy be continued when insulin is
initiated [2]. A Cochrane review reported that bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH)
insulin in combination with oral glucose-lowering therapies provided comparable glycaemic
control to insulin monotherapy but with generally lower doses of insulin [3]. In addition to its
potential for lowering concomitant insulin dose [3], metformin has been reported to have a
number of benefits that might attenuate risk, including cardiovascular benefits [4–6], cancer-
related benefits [7,8], and improved all-cause mortality [9]. In meta-analyses including obser-
vational studies, metformin has been shown to be associated with a decreased risk of cancer in
observational studies [10–13]. However, these findings were not replicated in meta-analyses of
RCT data [13,14].
We have previously reported a possible association between increasing insulin dose and
increased all-cause mortality in people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin monotherapy
[15]. Previous data have also demonstrated a direct association between insulin exposure and
mortality [16]. Roumie and colleagues have reported that the addition of insulin to existing
metformin treatment was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and all-
cause mortality versus the addition of sulfonylurea in people with type 2 diabetes [17]. We
recently reported that people with type 2 diabetes using insulin were at an increased risk of a
combined endpoint defined as first major adverse cardiac event, first cancer, or mortality, with
the risk being significantly higher for users of insulin monotherapy compared with users of
insulin plus concomitant metformin [18]. A common criticism of retrospective observational
studies is the risk of bias due to confounding by indication. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to account for insulin exposure and to match the cohorts by propensity score.
The aim of this study was to determine whether combining insulin with metformin reduced
the risk of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac event (MACE), or cancer compared with
insulin monotherapy, taking insulin dose into account.
Methods
Data source
The data source was the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) [19], a longitudinal data-
base collating pseudonymized data collected in a non-interventional way from 660 participat-
ing primary-care practices throughout the UK. CPRD is representative of the UK population
and contains 13 million patients, of which approximately five million are actively registered

 and can be followed prospectively. Data include demographics, medical history, investigations,
and prescriptions. For a proportion of patients registered with a participating English practice,
CPRD is linked to hospital data. Data were from January 2000 to January 2013. Patient consent
is not required for the inclusion of their records in CPRD. Patients do however have the right
to opt out if they do not want their records to be included in CPRD. Approval for this study
was granted by the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (reference number
11_017). The CPRD organization has obtained ethical approval from a National Research Eth-
ics Service Committee (NRES) for all purely observational research using anonymized CPRD
data; therefore, further ethical approval was not required.
Patients
Firstly, we selected patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were classified as having type 2 diabe-
tes if they met at least one of the following criteria:
1. More than one explicit diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
2. Prescriptions for at least two differing classes of glucose-lowering medication other than
insulin
3. At least one diagnosis of type 2 diabetes plus prescriptions for at least one glucose-lowering
medication excluding insulin.
From this cohort of patients, we then selected those people who had been prescribed insulin.
The study index date was defined as the date of first insulin prescription. It was required that
the patient’s first recorded exposure to insulin should be in the form of insulin monotherapy or
insulin in combination with metformin. For those patients prescribed insulin in combination
with metformin, insulin was either added to pre-existing metformin therapy or metformin and
insulin were started on the same date. Patients were required to have been registered at an up-
to-standard practice for at least 365 days before the index date.
Patients were excluded if they had any record for secondary diabetes, a yearly average insu-
lin dose greater than 4 units/kg/day, insulin prescribed on only one occasion, or no recorded
weight. Patients with a prior history of large vessel disease (defined as myocardial infarction
[MI], stroke, angina, or coronary revascularization) or cancer were excluded from analyses in
which MACE or cancer were the respective endpoints. Only patients with at least two prescrip-
tions for insulin were included because this was a requirement for the calculation of daily dose.
Patients could receive the second prescription for insulin between 1 and 179 days following
their first prescription for insulin (i.e. the index date) in order to be classed as still using insulin
therapy. Because of this selection criterion, patients had to survive until they received their sec-
ond prescription for insulin, but time to second prescription varied on a patient-by-patient
basis. Therefore, in order to standardize this, we excluded all patients who were censored or
had an event within 180 days of index (i.e. the maximum allowable time between insulin pre-
scriptions before we assumed that their insulin regimen had been discontinued and restarted).
Study endpoints
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, with secondary endpoints of incident MACE
(defined here as MI or stroke) and incident cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer).
Patients were followed from the index date plus 180 days to the earlier of the event (death,
MACE, or cancer) date or the censor date. The censor date for all analyses was defined as the
earliest of: the end of a patient’s recorded data, 90 days after their date of transfer to an alterna-
tive glucose-lowering regimen, or their last prescription for insulin. End of recorded data was

 defined as the earlier of the last data-collection date for the practice and the date a patient
transferred to a different GP practice. An intention-to-treat analysis was also carried out,
where patients were followed from the index date plus 180 days to the earlier of the event date
or the end of the patient’s recorded data.
Estimation of insulin dose
Weight-standardized daily insulin exposure (units/kg/day) was estimated from the volume of
insulin prescribed. The methods have been detailed previously [15]. Briefly, for each insulin
prescription, the quantity was converted to the number of international units prescribed and
divided by the nearest recorded weight measurement. Cumulative average insulin dose was cal-
culated on an annualized basis.
Statistical methods
Kaplan–Meier curves stratified by treatment arm were produced for each endpoint. Time to
each endpoint was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards modelling. Time zero for the Cox
model and the calculation of the crude event rates was taken as the first prescription for insulin
plus 180 days. People with events (cancer or MACE) prior to this date were excluded from the
relevant analysis. The following baseline characteristics were included in the Cox proportional
hazards model as continuous covariates: age, serum creatinine, body mass index (BMI), dura-
tion of diabetes, index year, Charlson comorbidity index [20], and the number of GP contacts
in the year prior to index date. In order to account for the rapidly increasing risk of experienc-
ing an adverse event as a person reaches old age, age was also added to the model as a quadratic
term (in addition to the linear term) where significant (p<0.05). Metformin exposure, haemo-
globin A1c (HbA1c), gender, insulin regimen, history of cancer or large vessel disease, smoking
status, and prior exposure to lipid-lowering, anti-platelet, and anti-hypertensive therapies were
included as categorical variables. For BMI, HbA1c, and serum creatinine, the baseline value
was defined as the nearest record to the index date provided it was no more than 365 days
before or 30 days after the index date. The search was conducted in the following order: −30,
+30 and −365 days. For the Charlson index, history of large vessel disease and cancer, and
prior exposure to-lipid-lowering, anti-platelet, and anti-hypertensive therapy, the patient’s
record was searched for any relevant diagnoses or prescriptions recorded prior to the index
date. Diabetes duration was calculated as the time between the diabetes presentation date
(defined as the earlier of the first recorded diabetes diagnosis and the first prescription for a
glucose-lowering therapy) and the index date. Smoking status at baseline was defined as the
nearest recorded status prior to the index date. Insulin regimen was defined as the regimen
(basal, basal–bolus, premix) prescribed to the patient during study follow-up. A fourth group,
called ‘other’, comprised those patients who could not be categorized as basal, basal–bolus, or
premix or who switched between regimen types. 15.7%, 12.3%, and 16.0% of patients had no
BMI, HbA1c, or serum creatinine measurement at baseline, respectively. Missing baseline val-
ues were imputed using multiple imputation for BMI, HbA1c, and serum creatinine.
In the primary analysis, cumulative weight-standardized insulin exposure was estimated for
each year following insulin initiation and analyzed as a time-dependent variable [16]. Other
measures of insulin exposure were evaluated in sensitivity analyses. For the intention-to-treat
analysis, mean insulin dose in year 1 was added to the Cox model.
Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. The propor-
tional hazards assumption was tested by examining the Pearson correlation between Schoen-
feld residuals and the rank of survival time for cases that had progressed to death and also
using Cox adjusted log–log curves. Where appropriate, interactions with time were used to

 assess the proportional hazards assumption. When the proportional hazards assumption was
violated, Heaviside functions or interactions with time were used. Crude event rates were com-
pared using tests of independence, where two-sided p-values were calculated using the mid-p
exact test. Baseline characteristics were compared using the chi-squared test for categorical var-
iables and t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, depending on their distri-
bution. Levene’s test was employed to test for homogeneity of variances. If the assumption
of equal variances was violated, a t test was conducted in which equal variances were not
assumed.
Patients prescribed insulin monotherapy were matched to patients prescribed insulin plus
metformin by propensity score, incorporating age, gender, year of index exposure, diabetes
duration, BMI, serum creatinine, GP contacts in the year prior to index date, HbA1c, Charlson
index, smoking status, history of prior cancer, history of prior large vessel disease, prior expo-
sure to anti-hypertensive, lipid-lowering, or anti-platelet therapy, and line of therapy. Only
patients with complete (i.e. non-imputed) data for the matching criteria were considered for
matching. Propensity-score matching was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 using the
SPSS R Essentials plug-in. Logistic regression was used to generate the propensity score. Near-
est neighbour 1:1 matching was implemented and the calliper was set at 0.1 of the standard
deviation of the logit of the propensity score. A series of checks was carried out to determine
whether the covariates had been adequately balanced as a result of the matching criteria.
These tests included an overall imbalance χ2 test developed by Hansen and Bowers, 2008; the
relative multivariate imbalance L1 test by Iacus, King, and Porro, 2010; and the standardized
mean difference for each covariate. Furthermore, diagnostic plots were examined to compare
the distribution of propensity scores and the standardized difference for all terms before and
after matching. The magnitude of the standardized differences for each covariate was also
examined.
Sensitivity analyses
In order to better identify the date of first diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and therefore the dura-
tion of diagnosed diabetes, sensitivity analyses were conducted. These analyses included only
those patients who were registered at an up-to-standard practice for a minimum of 365 days
prior to their diabetes presentation date. In a second sensitivity analysis, a subgroup analysis
was carried out using quartiles of the number of different glucose-lowering regimens pre-
scribed prior to the first prescription for insulin divided by the duration of diagnosed diabetes
in order to account for differences in prescribed glucose-lowering therapy prior to the initiation
of insulin. In all other respects, the specification of the Cox model remained as stated for the
main analyses.
A further sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to further investigate the risk of all-
cause mortality, MACE, and cancer across segmented portions of the follow-up period: 180–
545 days post-index, 546–910 days post-index, 911–1,275 days post-index, 1,276–1,640 days
post-index, and 1,641 days post index to end of follow-up. The Cox model was adjusted for the
same covariates as in the primary analysis.
Results
We identified 12,020 subjects with type 2 diabetes who progressed to insulin treatment, alone
or in combination with metformin. Of these, 5,536 were prescribed insulin plus metformin and
6,484 were prescribed insulin monotherapy. Subjects were followed up for an average of 3.5
(median 2.5) years; a total follow-up of 41,747 patient-years.

 Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics at index date by regimen are detailed in Table 1, classifying each regi-
men as lower or higher insulin dose with respect to the median (0.648 units/kg/day). Patients
treated with insulin plus metformin were younger than those treated with insulin monotherapy
(median 61.0 years vs 67.0 years, p<0.001). People in the insulin plus metformin group had
higher mean BMI (31.2kg/m2 vs 28.2kg/m2 for insulin plus metformin and insulin monother-
apy, respectively, p<0.001) and lower median serum creatinine levels (83.0 vs 95.0 μmol/l,
p<0.001). More patients receiving insulin monotherapy had a history of large vessel disease
(27% vs 14% for insulin monotherapy and insulin plus metformin, respectively, p<0.001) and
cancer (12% vs 8%, p<0.001). 2,757 patients prescribed insulin as monotherapy were matched
to 2,757 patients prescribed insulin plus metformin by propensity score. The baseline charac-
teristics for patients matched by propensity score are detailed in Table 2.
Crude event rates
Of those patients who survived until the end of follow-up, 36% of those prescribed insulin
monotherapy and 45% of those prescribed insulin in combination with metformin were cen-
sored at their GP practice’s last data-collection date; 4% and 3%, respectively, were censored
when they transferred out of practice. The percentage of patients censored by each of the crite-
ria outlined in the methods is detailed in Fig 1.
There were 1,486 deaths amongst patients using any insulin regimen, a rate of 41.5 (95% CI
39.4–43.6) deaths per 1,000 person-years. After excluding people with prior MACE, 579
patients experienced MACE, a rate of 20.8 (19.2–22.5) events per 1,000 person-years. After
excluding people with prior cancer, there were 680 cancer events, a crude event rate of 21.6
(20.0–23.3) cancer events per 1,000 person-years.
Crude rates of all-cause mortality, MACE, and cancer were highest in people treated with
insulin monotherapy: 61.3 versus 21.2 deaths per 1,000 person-years (p<0.001), 26.3 versus
15.9 MACE per 1,000 person-years (p<0.001), and 24.6 versus 18.7 cancer events per 1,000
person-years (p<0.001) for patients treated with insulin monotherapy versus insulin plus met-
formin, respectively (Table 3). Kaplan–Meier survival curves, stratified by treatment arm, are
illustrated in Fig 2.
Among the patients matched by propensity score, 534 out of 5,514 patients died, 235 out of
4,445 patients experienced an incident MACE, and 306 out of 4,909 patients experienced an
incident cancer event. Overall, the event rates were 44.4 (95% CI 39.8–49.4) and 23.1 (20.1–
26.4) deaths per 1,000 person-years; 22.2 (18.6–26.2) and 14.9 (12.3–18.0) MACE per 1,000
person-years; and 23.0 (19.5–26.9) and 19.9 (17.0–23.3) cancer events per 1,000 person-years
for insulin monotherapy and insulin plus metformin, respectively.
All-cause mortality
Across all insulin users, the aHR for all-cause mortality in relation to an increase in cumulative
average insulin dose of 1 unit/kg/day was 1.48 (95% CI 1.30–1.70). The aHR for patients pre-
scribed concomitant metformin—where patients with no exposure to metformin were used as
the reference group—was 0.60 (0.52–0.68) (Fig 3). The aHRs for all covariates added to the
Cox model are provided in Table 4. The point estimate for the aHR for patients prescribed con-
comitant metformin was lower than unity in all subgroups, but the confidence interval crossed
unity in three of the 25 subgroups (Fig 3). The aHR for users of metformin was lower in people
with an HbA1c >8.5% and �10.5% (0.48, 0.36–0.63), those aged �65 years (0.46, 0.36–0.59),
those having less comorbidity (Charlson index of �2, 0.53, 0.43–0.66) or no prior large vessel
disease (0.52, 0.45–0.62), and in those using basal–bolus or premix regimens (0.54, 0.46–0.65).

 A sensitivity analysis in which insulin exposure was estimated using a variety of methods prior
to inclusion into the Cox model gave consistent results (Table 5).
For patients matched by propensity score, the aHR for those prescribed concomitant metfor-
min in comparison with those prescribed insulin monotherapy was 0.62 (95% CI 0.52–0.75).
For the intention-to-treat analysis, the aHR for all-cause mortality for patients prescribed
insulin plus metformin when compared with insulin monotherapy was 0.70 (95% CI 0.64–
0.77). The use of metformin violated the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model.
However, examination of the log–log curves revealed that the curves for insulin monotherapy
and insulin plus metformin converged after 3,285 days but did not cross at any point.
MACE
There was no statistically significant association between annually updated, time-dependent
cumulative mean insulin dose and MACE (aHR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.96–1.51, Fig 4). Patients
treated with insulin plus concomitant metformin had a reduced risk of MACE (0.75, 0.62–
0.91) when compared with those treated with insulin monotherapy. The aHRs for all covariates
added to the Cox model are provided in Table 6. A sensitivity analysis in which insulin expo-
sure was estimated using a variety of methods prior to inclusion into the Cox model gave con-
sistent results (Table 5).
The point estimate for the aHR for those prescribed insulin plus metformin when compared
to those prescribed insulin as monotherapy was less than unity for many of the subgroups
with the exception of those treated with basal insulin (aHR 1.15, 95% CI 0.63–2.10) and those
with a BMI of �28kg/m2 (1.00, 0.75–1.34, Fig 4). Of the statistically significant results, the aHR
for patients treated with concomitant metformin was lowest for those patients with a BMI

b), MACE (c and d), and cancer (e and f). Blue = insulin monotherapy, green = insulin plus metformin. Time zero refers to index date plus 180 days.
For the adjusted survival curves, a non-time-dependent Cox model was used, where insulin dose was modelled as the mean value for the follow-up
period. The proportional hazards assumption was violated for history of cancer (all-cause mortality), history of receiving antihypertensive therapy (all-
cause mortality), and serum creatinine (cancer).

(0.57, 0.40–0.81).
For eligible propensity-score-matched patients, the use of metformin violated the propor-
tional hazards assumption of the Cox model, therefore it was added as Heaviside functions.
Fig 3. Adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality for insulin plus metformin compared with insulin monotherapy. Notes: Final model
specification: estimated cumulative insulin dose, therapy (±metformin), HbA1c, BMI, diabetes duration, index year, insulin regimen, smoking status,
serum creatinine, prior cancer, prior large vessel disease, prior lipid-lowering therapy, prior anti-hypertensive therapy, prior anti-platelet therapy, prior
GP contacts, Charlson comorbidity index, gender, and age at index. Insulin dose (units/kg/day) was added as a cumulative dose as an annually
updated, time-dependent covariate. Baseline values were used for the remaining covariates as defined in the Statistical Methods section. Prior anti-
hypertensive therapy and history of cancer violated the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model and so were added as Heaviside functions
(<1,095 and �1,095 days). The covariate used to categorize each subgroup was removed from the model for the respective analysis.

those patients with a follow-up of �365 days. Model specification: estimated insulin dose, therapy (±metformin), HbA1c, BMI, diabetes duration, index
year, insulin regimen, smoking status, serum creatinine, prior lipid-lowering therapy, prior anti-hypertensive therapy, prior anti-platelet therapy, prior GP
contacts, Charlson comorbidity index, gender, and age at index. Prior cancer was included in the Cox model for all-cause mortality and MACE endpoints.
Prior large vessel disease was included for all-cause mortality and cancer endpoints. Age squared was included in the Cox model where cancer was the
endpoint. Baseline values were used for all covariates other than insulin dose as defined in the Statistical Methods section. Prior anti-hypertensive therapy
and history of cancer violated the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model for all-cause mortality endpoint and so were added as Heaviside
functions (<1,095 and �1,095 days). Regimen violated the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model for the cancer endpoint and was therefore
added as Heaviside functions (<1,095 and �1,095 days). For the MACE endpoint, interactions with time demonstrated that the proportional hazards
assumptions was violated for insulin dose when it was added to the Cox proportional hazards model as an annually updated, time-dependent mean or
cumulative mean value.

using a variety of methods prior to inclusion into the Cox model are provided in Table 5.
For eligible propensity-score-matched patients, the aHR for those prescribed concomitant
metformin compared with insulin monotherapy was 0.99 (95% CI 0.78–1.26).
For the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no statistically significant association between
the use of metformin in combination with insulin and the cancer endpoint (aHR 0.977, 95% CI
0.84–1.13).
Comparison of lower-dose and higher-dose insulin
There was a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality for patients in the higher-dose
insulin plus metformin and lower- and higher-dose insulin monotherapy groups relative to
lower-dose insulin plus metformin (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04–1.57; 1.66, 1.38–1.99; 2.17, 1.81–

 with lower- and higher-dose insulin in combination with metformin (Fig 6b). Those prescribed
higher-dose insulin monotherapy had the highest risk of MACE (aHR 1.46, 95% CI 1.14–1.87,
versus lower-dose insulin in combination with metformin). For the cancer endpoint, higher-
dose insulin was associated with a higher risk of cancer; however, these results were not statisti-
cally significant (aHR 1.21, 95% CI 0.96–1.52, for those prescribed higher-dose insulin plus
metformin, and 1.20, 0.95–1.52, for those prescribed higher-dose insulin monotherapy versus
lower-dose insulin plus metformin, Fig 6c).

with a history of large vessel disease), 128 and 75 events were observed for people treated with
insulin monotherapy and insulin plus metformin, respectively. The crude event rates were 20.7
and 11.7 events per 1,000 person-years, respectively (p<0.001). For cancer (after excluding
people with a history of cancer), 158 and 121 events were observed for people treated with

The use of metformin in people prescribed insulin was associated with a reduced risk of all-
cause mortality (aHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52–0.80), and MACE (0.64, 0.45–0.91). However, there
was no significant difference in the risk of cancer when those prescribed insulin plus metfor-
min were compared with those prescribed insulin monotherapy (0.90, 0.67–1.19). The use of
metformin in combination with insulin was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortal-
ity for each quartile of the number of prior glucose-lowering regimens prescribed per year of
diagnosed diabetes, but the reduction was only statistically significant in quartiles 1 and 3

not significant in any quartile. However, for MACE, the aHR for the use of metformin was low-
est in those in the first quartile of the number of prior glucose-lowering regimens prescribed
per year and nearly achieved statistical significance (aHR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–1.03).

 Risk of all-cause mortality, MACE, and cancer for segmented periods of follow-up.
The
use of metformin in combination with insulin was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause
mortality in all periods of follow-up. These reductions were statistically significant in all fol-
low-up periods with the exception of 1,276–1,640 days post-index (Table 9). The use of
contacts, Charlson comorbidity index, gender, insulin regimen, and age at index. The combined insulin
exposure and therapy variable was added to the Cox model as an annually updated, time-dependent
covariate. Baseline values were used for the remaining covariates as defined in the Statistical Methods
section. Lower insulin dose was defined as �0.648 units/kg/day and higher dose was defined as >0.648
units/kg/day. For all-cause mortality, prior cancer and prior anti-hypertensives violated the proportional
hazards assumption of the Cox model and so were entered as Heaviside functions (�1,095 and >1,095
days). For cancer, insulin regimen type violated the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model and
so this was added as Heaviside functions (<1,095 and �1,095 days).

Table 8. Adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality, MACE, and cancer for patients with > = 365 days wash-in to diabetes presentation from the
later of registration date and practice up-to-standard date. For the overall model, there was evidence that the proportional hazards assumption was vio-
lated for insulin dose. Therefore, an interaction with time was incorporated into the Cox model. For all-cause mortality, Heaviside functions (<1,095 and > =
1,095 days) were used for history of cancer and antihypertensives. Where the analysis was split by quartile of the number of prior glucose-lowering regimens
per year, Heaviside functions were used for HbA1c (<730 and > = 730 days), history of cancer, and antiplatelet therapy (<365 and > = 365 days) for the
MACE endpoint. For the cancer endpoint, history of receiving prescriptions for lipid-lowering therapy, gender (<1,095 and > = 1,095 days), diabetes duration
(<1,460 and > = 1,460 days), and history of receiving antihypertensives (<365 and > = 365 days) were introduced into the model as Heaviside functions.

 metformin in combination with insulin reduced the risk of MACE in all follow-up periods
with the exception of 911–1,275 days post-index. However, these reductions were only statisti-
cally significant in the 180–545 days post-index (aHR, 0.65, 95% CI 0.45–0.93) and from 1,640
post-index to end of follow-up (0.65, 0.45–0.96). No statistically significant reduction in the
risk of cancer was observed in any of the segmented follow-up periods.
Discussion
The risk of all-cause mortality and MACE was reduced in insulin-treated people receiving con-
comitant metformin when compared to those prescribed insulin as monotherapy. For all-cause
mortality, this finding was stable across a range of diabetes-related phenotypic subgroups and
after propensity-score matching. However, no significant difference in the risk of cancer
between the two treatment groups was observed. Importantly, we accounted for insulin dose.
An association between the concomitant use of metformin and serious adverse events in
people prescribed insulin has been reported previously. The HOME (Hyperinsulinemia: the
Outcome of its Metabolic Effects) trial found that the addition of metformin to insulin therapy
reduced the risk of macrovascular disease (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.40–0.94) [6]. In a study
conducted using data from CPRD, insulin monotherapy was reported to be associated with a
significantly higher risk of MACE, cancer, or death when compared with insulin in combina-
tion with metformin (1.51, 1.28–1.78) [18]. However, this study did not account for insulin
dose. Evidence from the Danish National Patient Register found that the aHR for all-cause
mortality in comparison with sulfonylurea therapy was 0.96 (0.82–1.13) for insulin plus met-
formin and 1.14 (1.06–1.20) for insulin monotherapy [21]. Conversely, a more recent system-
atic review of RCTs conducted by Hemmingsen and colleagues reported that insulin plus
concomitant metformin was not associated with a reduced risk of all-cause or cardiovascular
mortality compared with insulin alone in people with type 2 diabetes [22]. This meta-analysis
was limited, however, by the small number of reported events of interest [22]. In the United
Kingdom Prospective Study, metformin treatment was associated with a 33% (95% CI 13–
47%) reduction in all-cause mortality when compared with conventional therapy (predomi-
nately diet alone) [23]. Clinical guidelines recommend that when insulin treatment is started it
is added to, rather than replaces, existing metformin therapy [2]. Among its purported benefits,
metformin may be cardioprotective, an effect that cannot be solely explained by its ability to
lower blood glucose [4,5]. Systematic reviews have reported that insulin plus metformin cause
improved glycaemic control, less weight gain, and reduced insulin requirements when com-
pared with insulin monotherapy [3,22]. The REACH (Reduction of Atherothrombosis for
Continued Health) study selected patients with atherothrombosis and showed that treatment
with metformin was associated with an aHR for mortality of 0.76 (95% CI 0.65–0.89) compared
with no metformin [24]. Metformin has been shown to attenuate the risk of all-cause mortality
and other serious events when added to insulin [25].
In vitro studies suggest that metformin may protect against cancer through the activation of
activated protein kinase (AMPK) [7]. However, we have not found a statistically significant dif-
ference in the risk of incident cancer between patients treated with insulin monotherapy or
insulin in combination with metformin. In a retrospective observational study using data from
the General Practice Research Database (GPRD, the predecessor of CPRD), van Staa and col-
leagues observed increased cancer risk for insulin versus metformin monotherapy in the first
six months after initiation (adjusted relative rate 1.79, 95% CI 1.53–2.10), but this decreased
with time from initiation, indicating protopathic bias [26]. Some meta-analyses of observa-
tional data have reported that metformin is associated with a decreased risk of cancer [10–13].
Conversely, Stevens and colleagues reported that, when data from RCTs were combined,

 metformin did not reduce the risk of cancer versus active comparators (0.98, 95% CI 0.77–
1.23) [14].
The ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention) trial [27] showed
that, when compared with standard care, low-dose insulin glargine was not associated with a
significant increase in the risk of cancer and cardiovascular outcomes. However, by the end of
the study, 47% of the patients allocated to the insulin glargine group were also receiving met-
formin therapy (compared with 60% in the standard-care group) and 47% of patients in the
standard-care group had received treatment with sulfonylureas and 11% insulin. Here we have
found that, after adjusting for cumulative insulin exposure, people prescribed metformin in
combination with insulin had a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in comparison with people
prescribed insulin monotherapy, but no reduced risk of cancer was found. Associations
between insulin dose and all-cause mortality have been reported previously [16,28]. Possible
explanations for this dose association have been discussed [15].
There are several potential limitations to consider, some of which have been discussed pre-
viously [15]. Retrospective observational studies can only demonstrate possible associations
with events; prospective randomized controlled trials are required to establish causality. Since
these data are from routine practice, some data were missing. However, the data quality in
CPRD is generally considered to be good [29], and only those patient records meeting CPRD’s
research quality criteria were included. Rules were applied to maintain consistency in the selec-
tion of patients with type 2 diabetes. However, misclassification of diabetes type was possible
and was more likely to affect patients prescribed insulin monotherapy. Duration of diagnosed
type 2 diabetes was used as a covariate in the Cox model. In order to calculate this parameter in
those patients who registered at the GP practice with pre-existing diabetes, we relied on the GP
recording the date of first diagnosis rather than the date that the current GP practice became
aware of the condition. As this may not be accurate in all cases, a sensitivity analysis was carried
out using only those patients with an adequate wash-in between registration with the GP prac-
tice and first prescription for a glucose-lowering therapy. The risk of adverse events obtained
from the sensitivity analyses was similar to those obtained from the main analyses.
There were potential limitations to the methods used to estimate insulin dose. Under- and
overestimations of prescribed quantities were possible due to inconsistencies between fields in
the prescriptions table or ambiguities in the quantities prescribed, but rules were devised to
maintain consistency [15]. The exclusion of people with no weight measurement may have led
to the elimination of sicker or very obese patients where weight measurement is more challeng-
ing. There is a theoretical time bias arising from the incorporation of the year 1 and the time-
dependent, annually updated mean and cumulative mean insulin dose into the Cox model.
However, similar aHRs for the use of metformin were obtained when insulin dose was intro-
duced into the Cox model as an annually updated mean value with a lag of one year.
Insulin exposure was calculated from the volume of insulin prescribed. We were unable to
determine from the data whether the patient collected or used all the insulin prescribed to
them. A larger proportion of patients in the higher-dose insulin groups switched between
basal–bolus, premix, or basal insulin regimens. At each switch, a certain amount of insulin is
likely to be wasted, leading to an overestimation of their insulin dose. These patients are also
likely to be the least well controlled.
One of the main criticisms of this type of observational study is the possibility of confound-
ing by indication. This has been minimized here by our selecting only those patients initiated
on insulin; however, differences in baseline characteristics did exist. For example, patients
receiving insulin in combination with metformin were in generally heavier than those receiving
insulin as monotherapy and less likely to have a history of large vessel disease. Due to the risk
of lactic acidosis, metformin should be used with caution in renal impairment [30]. At baseline,

 28% of patients in the insulin monotherapy group had a prior history of renal disease versus
18% in the insulin plus metformin group. In addition, 19% of patients in the insulin monother-
apy group had a creatinine level of >130μmol/l in comparison with 3% in the insulin plus met-
formin group; this did not impact our findings in sensitivity analysis. Metformin should also
be withdrawn in people at risk of tissue hypoxia or deterioration in renal function, such as
those with acute heart failure or recent myocardial infarction, whereas there are no such barri-
ers to receiving insulin as monotherapy. Therefore, the population of people receiving insulin
in combination with metformin may be healthier than the monotherapy group. Measures of
comorbidity were included in the Cox proportional hazards model and propensity-score
matching, including the Charlson index; BMI; prior large vessel disease; history of prescrip-
tions for anti-hypertensive, lipid-lowering and anti-platelet therapies; serum creatinine; and
the number of GP contacts in the year prior. However, residual confounding may still exist.
Censoring patients at time of regimen change may have also led to bias, where change in regi-
men could indicate poor glycaemic control. For people treated with insulin in combination
with metformin, metformin therapy may be withdrawn in people developing contraindications
to metformin therapy—for example, heart failure and renal impairment—leading to censor-
ship. However, in our intention-to-treat analysis, the use of metformin in people prescribed
insulin was still associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, and risk approached signifi-
cance for the MACE endpoint (p = 0.051). There is an argument that increasing insulin dose
could be a measure of diabetes deterioration. However, when, as a sensitivity analysis, insulin
dose was entered into the Cox model as dose in year 1, the aHRs were 1.40 (1.22–1.60) for all-
cause mortality and 1.22 (1.07–1.40) for the combined endpoint.
The number of events should be at least 10 times the predictor degrees of freedom in the
model [31]. Therefore, over-fitting of the model may have occurred for some of the subgroup
analyses.
People with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin plus concomitant metformin had a reduced
risk of death and MACE compared with people treated with insulin monotherapy. There was
no statistically significant difference in the risk of cancer between people treated with insulin as
monotherapy or in combination with metformin. Further studies are needed to determine the
risks and benefits of insulin in type 2 diabetes and the possible benefits associated with the
administration of concomitant metformin.
