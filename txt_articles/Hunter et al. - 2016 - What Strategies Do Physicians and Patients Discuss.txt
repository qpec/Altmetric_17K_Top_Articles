Abstract
Background—More than 1 in 4 Americans report difficulty paying medical bills. Cost-reducing 
strategies discussed during outpatient physician visits remain poorly characterized.
Objective—We sought to determine how often patients and physicians discuss healthcare costs 
during outpatient visits and what strategies, if any, they discussed to lower patient out-of-pocket 
costs.
Design—Retrospective analysis of dialogue from 1,755 outpatient visits in community-based 
practices nationwide from 2010–2014. The study population included 677 patients with breast 
cancer, 422 with depression, and 656 with rheumatoid arthritis visiting 56 oncologists, 36 
psychiatrists, and 26 rheumatologists, respectively.
Results—Thirty percent of visits contained cost conversations (95% confidence interval [CI], 28 
to 32). Forty-four percent of cost conversations involved discussion of cost-saving strategies (95% 
CI, 40 to 48; median duration, 68 seconds). We identified 4 strategies to lower costs without 
changing the care plan – in order of overall frequency, (1) Changing logistics of care; (2) 
Facilitating copay assistance; (3) Providing free samples; (4) Changing/adding insurance plans –

 and 4 strategies to reduce costs by changing the care plan – (1) Switching to lower-cost alternative 
therapy/diagnostic; (2) Switching from brand name to generic; (3) Changing dosage/frequency; (4) 
Stopping/withholding interventions. Strategies were relatively consistent across health conditions, 
except for switching to lower-cost alternative (more common in breast oncology), and providing 
free samples (more common in depression).
Limitation—Focus on three conditions with potentially high out-of-pocket costs.
Conclusions—Despite price opacity, physicians and patients discuss a variety of out-of-pocket 
cost reduction strategies during clinic visits. Almost half of cost discussions mention one or more 
cost-saving strategies, with more frequent mention of those not requiring care-plan changes.
INTRODUCTION
In 2012, more than 1 in 4 Americans reported difficulty paying medical bills.1,2 This is not 
an isolated problem of the uninsured; 70% of Americans with medical debt have health 
insurance.3 Key contributors to high out-of-pocket healthcare costs include increases in 
patient cost sharing, growth in high deductible healthcare plans, and increased use of 
expensive biologic or designer drugs.2,4–7 In addition to depleting financial savings and 
damaging credit, high out-of-pocket medical costs negatively impact quality of life, 
medication adherence, and a variety of health outcomes.3,6,8–12
Sometimes patients have a choice about how much to pay out-of-pocket for their healthcare 
services.13,14 They might be able to find financial assistance for the services in question, 
turn to less expensive alternatives, or forgo the services altogether.15,16 Most patients, 
however, are not fully informed about these alternatives and may desire assistance from 
clinicians in identifying cost-reducing options and weighing potential medical-financial 
trade-offs.2,8,17–19 Indeed, surveys show that 59–80% of patients wish to discuss out-of-
pocket costs during clinic visits and 91% of physicians believe that managing patient costs is 
important.20–23 Accordingly, physician experts and patient advocacy groups contend that 
out-of-pocket costs ought to be routinely discussed during clinic visits to mitigate or prevent 
avoidable financial distress.24–27
Despite increased attention on physician-patient cost communication in recent years, many 
aspects of this topic remain undetermined.28 The prevalence of such discussions is unknown, 
with wide variation in published estimates from as few as 14–15% of patients ever 
discussing their healthcare costs with physicians29,30 to as many as 44% of patients 
discussing their healthcare costs with physicians in a single year.21 Additionally, the 
duration of physician-patient cost discussions is unknown, given few studies of actual cost 
communication behavior.31,32 Lastly and perhaps most importantly, the types and 
frequencies of cost-reducing strategies discussed by physicians and patients remain unclear.
To shed light on these areas, we analyzed naturally occurring dialogue from 1,755 
community-based, outpatient clinic visits taking place between 2010–2014. We targeted 
three clinical settings – breast cancer, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis – since they are 
prevalent diseases, can be associated with high out-of-pocket costs, and represent the varied 
contexts of a life-threatening condition, a chronic debilitating condition, and a mental health

 condition, respectively.8,30,33–35 By exploring the frequency and duration of healthcare cost 
discussions in these diverse encounters, as well as the cost-reducing strategies addressed 
therein, we provide novel insights about the out-of-pocket cost management efforts 
discussed by physicians and patients in outpatient settings.
METHODS
Sample Description
Patient visits were sampled from the Verilogue Point-of-Practice™ database of audio-
recorded clinical encounters. Verilogue recruited physicians randomly from available lists of 
active, board certified physicians, and paid them to record patient visits for the purpose of 
marketing or health services research. Physicians and patients were unaware of the research 
questions for which their recorded visits would be used. Patients were approached and 
consented prior to initiation of the visit; approximately 80% of patients agreed to participate. 
All protected health information was removed during the transcription process. This study 
was approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board.
We obtained the most recent 1,000 encounters for management of breast cancer, depression, 
and rheumatoid arthritis. From this sample of 3,000 transcripts, we excluded visits that were 
conducted by primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, or nurses (N=800); occurred 
outside of the United States (N=350); involved patients less than 18 years of age (N=41); 
were primarily concerned with management of axial spondyloarthropathy, rather than 
rheumatoid arthritis (N=42); or contained only physician dictations (N=12). The final 
sample consisted of 1755 visits: 677 breast oncology encounters, 656 rheumatoid arthritis 
encounters, and 422 psychiatry encounters. These encounters occurred between May 2010 
and February 2014 in outpatient, private-practice offices across the United States. More 
specifically, visits occurred in 9 major US geographic regions (e.g. New England, Middle 
Atlantic, Mountain, Pacific), 34 states, and 113 zip codes (see Table 1, Table S1, and Table 
S2 for additional details). Visits were classified as taking place in urbanized areas, urban 
clusters, or rural areas by matching zip codes in our sample with population measures from 
the 2010 US Census, and applying definitions formalized in the Urban Area Criteria for the 
2010 Census.36
Analytic Approach
To mitigate individual coder biases and errors, encounters were analyzed independently by 
at least two team members. The following cost-related measures were evaluated: (1) 
Presence or absence of cost conversation; if a cost conversation was present, then (2) 
duration of the cost conversation; (3) to which intervention the cost conversation was 
related; (4) discussion of cost-saving strategies. A team member experienced in conversation 
analysis assessed coder agreement on each of the above measures. In cases of agreement, the 
corresponding decision was assigned as ‘final’. When discrepant, the final coding decision 
was decided by group consensus. Team members with clinical experience (PAU, WGH) 
supervised coder training and discrepancy resolution to ensure proper interpretation of 
clinical matters. All coding was applied using NVivo software (QSR International Pty Ltd. 
Version 10, 2014).

 Cost-Related Measurements
Visits were first reviewed to determine whether a cost conversation was present. Cost 
conversation was defined as any mention of the patient’s financial costs or insurance 
coverage related to a specific intervention. If a cost conversation was present, we determined 
the initiator, defined as the party making the first explicit statement related to the patient’s 
health care costs during the clinic visit. We also determined the duration of the cost 
conversation. Total visit duration was provided for each transcript, but no line-wise time 
stamps or other direct time indicators were available for this analysis. Accordingly, we 
calculated cost conversation duration in each clinic visit by multiplying the total number of 
cost-related words by the average rate of words spoken. This average rate was calculated by 
dividing total number of words spoken in clinic visits by duration of visit in a random 10% 
sample of encounters. Our estimate for average speech rate (words per minute, mean ± 
standard deviation = 164 ± 29) was consistent with average speech rates from prior linguistic 
analyses.37,38
Additionally, we determined whether each cost conversation contained discussion about 
cost-saving strategies. We further assessed cost-saving strategies to determine whether they 
included (1) strategies involving care-plan changes (e.g. replacing an intervention with a 
lower cost alternative or stopping, withholding, or reducing the amount of an intervention) 
and (2) strategies NOT involving care-plan changes (e.g. signing up for a copay assistance 
program, switching pharmacies to get a better price, or changing insurance plans to reduce 
costs).
Statistical Analysis
We calculated 95% confidence intervals for all proportions using Clopper and Pearson’s 
exact method.39 We used Pearson’s chi-square test to compare the frequencies of coding 
measures. Distributions of cost conversation durations were non-normal, so the non-
parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare cost discussion 
durations. Demographic characteristics were compared using Pearson’s Chi-Square test and 
ANOVA. Since each patient is recorded once, our unit of measurement is the encounter, 
which we grouped by disease state for ease of presentation. Statistical analyses were 
performed by W.G.H. and P.A.U using R software (R Core Team (2013), Version 3.0.1, 
http://www.R-project.org/). The authors had full access to the data and take responsibility 
for its integrity.

RESULTS
Study Population
A total of 1,755 outpatient appointments were analyzed in this study. The baseline 
characteristics of the patients and physicians are shown in Table 1. The age, gender, and

 insurance coverage distribution for patients are in alignment with national figures. The 
percentage of male physicians in each setting is higher than national averages at the time of 
sample collection: 89% male oncologists in our population versus 73% in the entire US, 
100% male psychiatrists compared with 65% nationally, and 81% male rheumatologist 
versus for 63% nationally.40 The median number of visits recorded by each physician was 
12 (interquartile range (IQR), 4 to 22).
Visits occurred throughout the United States in 9 geographic regions, 34 states, and 113 zip 
codes (Tables 1, S1, and S2). Visits were well distributed across the regions, with the highest 
percentage of visits occurring in the South Atlantic region (18% of the overall sample; 
comprised of Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, West 
Virginia, North and South Carolina), and the lowest percentage of visits occurring in New 
England (6% of overall sample; comprised of Connecticut and Massachusetts). New York, 
Georgia, Texas, and Ohio were the states having the greatest numbers of visits, constituting 
9%, 9%, 7%, and 6% of the overall sample, respectively. Greater than 90% of visits occurred 
in urbanized areas (population greater than 50,000) or urban clusters (population 2,500–
50,000), and less than 10% of visits occurred in rural areas (population less than 2,500), as 
defined by the United States Bureau of the Census.36
Frequency, Initiators, and Duration of Cost Conversations
Overall, 527 of 1755 clinic visits (30%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 28 to 32) contained 
conversations about the patient’s healthcare costs. Physicians initiated 58% of cost 
conversations (95% CI, 53 to 62), whereas patients and their caregivers initiated 40% (95% 
CI, 36 to 45) and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 3), respectively. Forty-four percent of these 527 cost 
conversations included discussion of cost-saving strategies (95% CI, 40 to 48), a figure that 
did not differ significantly across the three clinical settings: breast oncology, 38%; 
depression, 45%; rheumatoid arthritis, 47%; P=0.23 (Figure 1).
The median visit length in our study was 9 minutes and 56 seconds (interquartile range 
(IQR), 6 minutes and 1 second to 13 minutes and 31 seconds). In encounters where patients 
and physicians discussed cost-saving strategies, they spent a median of 68 seconds 
discussing healthcare costs (IQR, 34 to 117 seconds), a duration that did not differ across 
disease settings (P=0.63). Fifty-three percent of these cost conversations lasted longer than 1 
minute (Figure 2).
Out-of-Pocket Cost Saving Strategies
Patients and physicians discussed a wide range of strategies to lower out-of-pocket costs. 
(See Table 2 for example quotes.) These strategies can be divided into two broad categories 
– strategies that lower costs by changing the plan of care, (e.g. switching to lower-cost 
alternatives), versus strategies that lower costs without changing the plan of care (e.g. 
obtaining co-pay assistance for a previously prescribed drug). Below we provide more detail 
on each of these strategies.

 Strategies Involving Care-Plan Changes
1. Switching to a lower cost alternative therapy or diagnostic: In 22% of cost 
conversations, physicians and patients discussed reducing out-of-pocket costs by switching 
to lower-cost alternatives (see Table 3). This strategy was discussed significantly more often 
in breast oncology encounters than depression and rheumatoid arthritis (P=0.01). For 
example, when treating bone metastases in elderly women with breast cancer, some 
oncologists proposed reducing out-of-pocket costs by switching patients from oral therapies 
with high copays (e.g. Boniva, Fosamax) to intravenous infusion therapies (e.g. Zometa), 
which were described as having little or no copays. When treating rheumatoid arthritis, 
rheumatologists sometimes proposed reducing out-of-pocket costs by switching patients 
from in-office infusions (e.g. Remicade, Rituxan) or injections (e.g. Enbrel, Humira) to 
cheaper, oral, non-biologic agents (e.g. Plaquenil, Arava). In general, switching to a lower 
cost alternative almost exclusively applied to medications; however, there were a few 
instances in which physicians and patients discussed switching to lower cost alternatives for 
procedures. For example, in one encounter, a psychiatrist discussed the cost-savings 
associated with using electroconvulsive therapy for depression treatment instead of 
transcranial magnetic stimulation, since the latter would not be covered by Medicare.
2. Switching from a brand name drug to its generic formulation: In 7% of cost 
conversations, physicians and patients discussed switching to generics as a method of 
reducing the patient’s costs. Cost conversations involving this strategy were usually brief 
(median duration, 28 seconds, IQR 10 to 64 seconds).
3. Changing dosage or frequency of intervention: In 5% of cost conversations, physicians 
and patients discussed reducing out-of-pocket costs by changing the dosage or frequency of 
medications, office visits or diagnostic tests. For example, when patients complained about 
the costs of PET scans, some physicians responded by offering patients the option of 
undergoing PET scans less frequently. Similarly, when patients with depression brought up 
high copays for psychotherapy, psychiatrists suggested reducing the amount of therapy by 
moving from weekly therapy sessions to monthly or bimonthly sessions.
4. Stopping or withholding interventions: In 4% of cost conversations, patients and 
physicians discussed reducing out-of-pocket costs by stopping or withholding interventions. 
This strategy was least frequent in breast cancer encounters, with only one of 677 breast 
oncology encounters involving discussion of discontinuing a chemotherapeutic agent to 
reduce out-of-pocket costs (Table 3). In depression and rheumatology settings, this strategy 
was suggested as a sort of contingency plan, with the physician recommending that the 
patient forgo the medication in question if they found their copay to be too high when filling 
it at the pharmacy. In most of these cases, the physician admitted lack of knowledge with 
regards to the expected costs, and thus discussed this strategy as a means of protecting 
patients against potentially high out-of-pocket costs.
Strategies NOT Involving Care-Plan Changes
1. Changing Logistics of Care: In 23% of cost conversations, patients and physicians 
discussed reducing out-of-pocket costs by changing the timing, source, or location of the

 patient’s healthcare. When discussing medications, physicians often suggested that patients’ 
fill prescriptions at particular pharmacies to save money. In other cases, patients requested 
that physicians write their prescriptions in a manner that would result in the lowest possible 
copays. For instance, several patients requested 90-day supplies of their medications instead 
of 30-day supplies, since the former resulted in lower total copays over the course of the 
year. Purchasing medications from outside the United States was only discussed in one visit 
as a means to reduce out-of-pocket costs.
When discussing diagnostic tests, physicians and patients often mentioned the status of their 
deductible, and scheduled the tests in a way that would minimize out-of-pocket costs. For 
example, positron emission tomography and radionuclide angiography tests were noted to be 
expensive in the setting of breast cancer, and were often scheduled at the end of the calendar 
year to take advantage of the better coverage for patients who had already met their 
deductible. This scheduling of diagnostic tests to minimize out-of-pocket costs was carried 
out even if the timing was not in alignment with evidence-based surveillance guidelines. 
When discussing procedures, physicians sometimes suggested that the patient get as many 
pertinent procedures performed at the same time to save money; for instance, one physician 
encouraged his patient to undergo a breast reconstruction and reduction at the same time to 
minimize costs, effectively getting “two things done for the price of one.”
2. Facilitating Copay Assistance or Drug Coupons: In 21% of cost conversations, patients 
and physicians discussed reducing out-of-pocket costs through co-pay assistance or drug 
coupons. This strategy was most commonly brought up by physicians when starting patients 
on new brand-name medications. While copay assistance programs, drug coupons, and 
charity foundations were mentioned as helpful means of reducing the patients’ costs, very 
rarely did physicians and patients mention (a) how long patients would be eligible to benefit 
from these programs or (b) how much they would actually reduce out-of-pocket costs for 
potentially expensive medications such as biologic anti-rheumatic drugs or newer brand 
name chemotherapeutics for breast cancer.
3. Providing Free Samples to Reduce Patient Costs: In 13% of cost conversations, 
patients and physicians discussed reducing out-of-pocket costs through the use of free 
samples. This was the most frequently discussed strategy in the setting of depression (23% 
of cost-saving strategies in depression; Table 3). At times, patients and physicians discussed 
samples as a way to start or continue an otherwise cost-prohibitive medication (Table 1). 
Additionally, free samples were discussed as a way in which patients could try out new 
medications for several weeks to determine its short-term effectiveness without having to 
pay out-of-pocket. Samples were most frequently brand name drugs, and discussions of 
them rarely mentioned the out-of-pocket costs that the patient would face when actually 
filling the corresponding prescription.
4. Changing or Adding Insurance Plans: In 5% of cost conversations, patients and 
physicians discussed reducing out-of-pocket costs by changing or adding insurance plans. 
This strategy often came up in visits with elderly patients who had Medicare but did not 
have a supplemental insurance plan covering prescription drugs. When these patients 
complained about high costs related to their prescription medications, physicians queried

 about their insurance status and encouraged them to enroll in supplemental plans to help 
decrease their out-of-pocket expenses for medications. Additionally, we observed a number 
of circumstances in which physicians encouraged their patients to apply for disability as a 
means of reducing their out-of-pocket costs.
DISCUSSION
Despite receiving greater attention in recent years,24–27 physician-patient communication 
about out-of-pocket costs has remained poorly characterized.28 Published estimates of the 
prevalence of such discussions vary widely, with some surveys suggesting fewer than 1 in 6 
patients ever discuss healthcare costs with their physicians.20,41 In contrast, this analysis of 
actual clinical dialogue found that cost conversations occur more commonly - in 
approximately 1 in 5 breast cancer visits and 1 in 3 depression and rheumatoid arthritis 
visits. We also found that the majority of cost conversations were initiated by physicians. 
Importantly, nearly half of all cost conversations involved discussion of cost-saving 
strategies, which on average lasted about one minute. Our results demonstrate that despite 
price opacity and time-pressure in outpatient visits, physicians are willing and able to 
engage with their patients about cost-related issues and discuss a wide array of cost-saving 
strategies to lower out-of-pocket costs.42
Importantly, physicians and patients most frequently discussed cost-reducing strategies that 
did not involve care-plan changes. Specifically, copay assistance programs, drug coupons, 
and free samples accounted for over one-third of all strategies mentioned. Although these 
strategies often provide robust short-term cost-savings,43,44 their long-term effect on 
patients’ out-of-pocket costs is unclear.45–47 After the assistance expires or they no longer 
meet eligibility requirements, patients may find themselves facing the full copay for brand 
name drugs, which may be burdensome or even prohibitive (e.g. DR: Have you taken 
Provigil or Nuvigil before? PT: You got me a free sample online, and then my insurance 
wouldn’t cover it.)46,48 In contrast, strategies involving care-plan changes, such as switching 
to a lower cost alternative, using generics, and stopping or withholding interventions, are 
neither subject to expiration dates nor potential eligibility issues and may be more likely to 
result in long-term cost-savings.
While our study shows that cost conversations are more frequent than some prior surveys 
suggested,29,30,41 and that such conversations regularly lead to discussion of strategies to 
reduce patient out-of-pocket costs, it in no way establishes that such conversations are as 
productive as they could be. In some encounters, neither patients nor physicians could 
accurately determine the cost of specific interventions and struggled to figure out what could 
be done to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Frustration with the complexities of healthcare 
reimbursement was a recurring theme throughout these conversations. Greater price 
transparency and more comprehensible information on insurance coverage could alleviate 
some of these difficulties and facilitate identification of cost-saving options.19,42 Further 
development of pricing applications that provide real-time, individualized copay estimates 
may address these barriers.

 Our findings have important clinical and policy implications. Despite Medicaid expansion 
and closure of key coverage gaps, over a quarter of Americans still report financial burden 
due to their medical bills, either paying these bills late or not paying them at all.1–3 This is 
occurring in the context of widespread increases in patient cost-sharing and rapid growth in 
enrollment in high-deductible health plans.2,4–7 Consequently, Americans have more 
financial ‘skin in the game’ than ever before, and 59–80% of patients want to discuss 
healthcare costs with their physicians.20,49–51 With nearly half of cost discussions involving 
cost-reducing strategies, our findings suggest that patient-physician discussion about out-of-
pocket costs may be a helpful tool in addressing patients’ financial distress. However, since 
the majority of clinic visits did not contain cost discussions, our study may highlight a need 
for additional efforts in promoting physician-patient cost communication.20–27 Systematic 
screening for healthcare related financial distress on intake questionnaires and initial nursing 
evaluations could enhance physician and patient awareness of cost concerns, potentially 
prompting further discussion as is routinely done for physical or mental health complaints. 
While these interventions may increase prevalence of cost discussion, targeted educational 
initiatives may be needed to improve the quality of these discussions, as few physicians or 
nurses have received formalized training on effective cost communication.
Even if physicians and patients are cognizant of relevant cost concerns, they still must 
overcome additional barriers to discuss these costs during clinic visits. One often-cited 
barrier to cost communication is the perception of insufficient time to discuss costs in 
already rushed clinic visits.24,42 Interestingly, these perceptions do not seem to be based in 
any objective data; to our knowledge, this investigation features the first analysis of cost 
discussion duration to date. Herein, we observed that cost conversations involving discussion 
of cost-reducing strategies lasted approximately one minute, which often constituted 10% or 
more of the total visit time. Such a time commitment may still seem prohibitive to some 
clinicians; thus, further work will be required to characterize communication practices that 
not only improve the quality and patient-centeredness of cost discussions, but also their 
efficiency.
Our study has several limitations. First, the population in our study limits the 
generalizability of our findings. However, given the relatively large sample size (in 
comparison to other analyses of actual dialogue), geographic diversity, and variety in patient 
age and type of insurance coverage, our study has broader generalizability than populations 
studied to date. Second, we had access to one visit per patient, so we could not determine 
whether cost was discussed during visits prior to the ones we analyzed. It is possible that 
some of these patients discussed out-of-pocket costs on earlier visits, thereby reducing the 
necessity of discussing this topic during the recorded encounter. Third, our study focused on 
three health conditions, which we chose because they may expose patients to high out-of-
pocket costs and represent varied contexts of a life-threatening condition (breast cancer), a 
chronic debilitating condition (rheumatoid arthritis), and a mental health condition 
(depression).8,30,33–35 Other clinical conditions may have very different rates of cost 
discussion. Fourth, our study focused on identifying and characterizing the strategies 
patients and physicians discussed to lower out-of-pocket costs; it was not designed to 
identify available strategies that neither party discussed during the encounter.

 CONCLUSIONS
In this investigation of actual clinical dialogue from outpatient clinics, we observed 
physicians and patients discussing a wide variety of cost-reducing strategies to lower 
patients’ out-of-pocket costs. These strategies were mentioned in nearly half of all visits 
containing any discussion of the patient’s healthcare costs, with the majority mentioning 
strategies not requiring care-plan changes. In encounters where patients and physicians 
discuss strategies to lower out-of-pocket costs, such discussions lasted about one minute. 
Although brief in absolute terms, this often comprised more than 10% of the total encounter, 
which could present a barrier to more frequent cost communication. Overall, we found that 
almost one-third of visits included discussion of healthcare costs, which was higher than 
some prior surveys.20,30,41 The majority of these cost conversations were initiated by 
physicians. Further investigation is needed to determine effective and efficient cost 
communication strategies and assess the impact of such communication on subsequent 
financial distress, health outcomes, and overall patient satisfaction.

Prevalence of cost conversations with and without discussion of cost-saving strategies. All 
visits were between patients >18 years old and specialist physicians in community-based 
clinics across the United States.
*Cost conversation was defined as any mention of the financial costs or insurance coverage 
associated with the patient’s healthcare.
†Discussion of cost-saving strategy was defined as any mention of one or more methods to 
reduce the patient’s out-of-pocket costs. No evidence was required that the cost-saving 
strategy was used or pursued, only that it was discussed.

Table 2
Examples of Strategies to Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs*
Strategies INVOLVING Care-Plan Changes
Switch to Lower Cost 
Alternative Therapy or 
Diagnostic Plan
DR: Need anything else?
PT: The one I take for my ulcer…what do you call that?
DR: Omeprazole? Zantac? Nexium?
PT: Nexium.
DR: That’s expensive though.
PT: Ain’t no more expensive than the Micardis I have to pay for.
DR: How much is that?
PT: $150.
DR: Why don’t you ask the pharmacist which [peptic ulcer medication] is the least expensive and have him call 
me.
Switch to Generic Form 
of Same Medication
DR: I’m going to put you on the generic one, alendronate, which is a cheaper version, but with the same 
instructions.
Stop or Withhold 
Intervention
DR: Do you want the tramadol where you could take it as needed for pain?
PT: Um, I guess I could try it. I mean I don’t know.
DR: We could try 60 of them. It’s a generic, so hopefully the cost would not be bad…if it was bad, you could just 
say, no, I’ll skip it.
Changing Dose or 
Frequency of 
Intervention
PT: Last time I was here, we were going to go with 40 mg of Oxycontin…. We were going to do it three times a 
day, but that’s not going to work for me.
DR: What’s going to work for you?
PT: I have to spend $200 on pain medication, that’s how much those pills cost me…. So, I’d rather just go back 
to the 80s.
Strategies NOT INVOLVING Care-Plan Changes
Changing Logistics of 
Intervention
DR: For this medication, it’s cheaper to buy it directly from the company, rather than from the pharmacy. [The 
company] won’t mark it up. They sell it for, I think, $48 a month.
Facilitating Copay 
Assistance or Charity 
Care
DR: The copay you have with the Xgeva, there’s supposed to be copay assistance programs and all. Did you look 
into those?
Free Samples
DR: What are your thoughts? Do you feel it’s best to stay off the Abilify? We can get you samples of it…I don’t 
want cost to be the issue.
PT: Well, that’s the big issue, that’s why I’ve been off of it.
Change or Add 
Insurance Plans
DR: If you get a secondary coverage, they would pay [for your infusions]. Have you looked into getting a 
secondary?
CG: We’ve called everywhere…
PT: Because of my age.
DR: You’re too young?
CG: Yes. Does the Medicare part D pay for those [infusions]?
DR: They pay on the prescriptions…but that’s another good alternative, to get a part D plan.
DR: Right now, are you paying for your prescriptions?
CG: Yeah.
DR: But that’s something that I would definitely consider…is to get on a part D plan.
Fillers (e.g. “um”, “you know”) have been removed from dialogue for brevity and punctuation has been added to improve readability.
