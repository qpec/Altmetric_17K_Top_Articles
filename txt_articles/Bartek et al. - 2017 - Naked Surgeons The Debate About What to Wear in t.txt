Naked Surgeons? The Debate About What to Wear in the 
Operating Room

There has been recent controversy regarding recommendations and regulations concerning operating room attire. We performed 
a nonsystematic literature search regarding operating room attire and surgical site infection (SSI) risk. Much of the literature relies 
on air sampling and culture of operating room equipment but does not present evidence regarding effect on SSI risk. There is no 
evidence regarding SSI risk related to operating room attire except for sterile gowns and the use of gloves. Naked surgeons shed fewer 
bacteria into the operating room environment than ones wearing scrub suits.

It has always been difficult to balance the “evidence” part of 
“evidence-based medicine” and pragmatism. Sometimes the 
evidence is weak. Sometimes a strict adherence to the evidence 
would lead to implausible and unrealistic actions. Sometimes 
there are other factors to consider beyond focusing on mortality 
or adverse events. Therefore, it is reasonable, at times, to take 
a balanced and pragmatic approach when drafting prescriptive 
recommendations about how to care for patients. Does this 
framing not apply to operating room policies?
In 2014, the Association of Perioperative Nurses (AORN) issued 
new guidelines about, among other things, headwear in the operat-
ing room [1, 2]. They recommended that “a bouffant hat should be 
worn to cover all of the hair, scalp, and ears to minimize skin and 
hair shedding and protect surgical patients from bacteria.
” A vir-
tual debate ensued in what some have suggested was a figurative 
representation of the debates that happen daily in the operating 
room: doctors and nurses arguing in the name of what is best for 
the patient [3, 4]. The American College of Surgeons responded 
with a statement that included the notion that “the skullcap is 
symbolic of the surgical profession” and the medical blogosphere 
erupted, even spilling over into popular media outlets [5]. Of note, 
a similar response was seen in the United Kingdom following the 
introduction of a “bare below the elbows” policy about 10 years ago 
[6–9]. As 2 surgical trainees and a senior surgeon, we ask: Where 
does the truth lie? What truly is best for patients, patient safety, and 
hospital employees? If we dive into the supporting evidence, do we 
reach the same conclusions? Should we consider factors in addition 
to theoretical bacterial shedding to guide operating room protocol 
aimed at decreasing wound infections?
WE ARE NOT BEYOND SELF-DEPRECATION
Sometimes, practices that are shown to bring about improvement 
are not adopted in a timely manner. There is a tradition—par-
ticularly in surgery—of tolerating delays between the publica-
tion of convincing evidence for infection control methods and 
the introduction of those methods into practice. In the 1840s, 
Ignaz Semmelweiss and Oliver Wendell Holmes presented evi-
dence that handwashing could reduce infection, but it was not 
until Lister popularized the practice in the 1860s and 1870s that 
it caught on. It took nearly 30 years for handwashing to even 
be accepted as “good practice” [6]. In fact, the very adoption 
of “evidence-based medicine” followed a similar timeline: First 
described by Cochrane in the 1970s, it was not widely accepted 
and taught until the 1990s [10–12]. In another example, the use 
of surgical gloves, although shown to decrease infection by Dr 
William Halstead’s senior resident, Dr Bloodgood (the irony of 
his name does not escape us) in the 1890s, was not commonplace 
until the 1920s. Again, a lag of 30 years. However, the reasons 
cited for not wearing gloves early on tell a subtle but important 
story: The gloves, which were admittedly cumbersome and thick 
at the time, impaired surgeons’ “sense of touch” [13]. This strug-
gle between sacrifices in functionality and potential improve-
ments in infection control continues to the present debate.
In contrast, there are other practices that are adopted but 
not clearly shown to bring about improvement. Physicians—
and surgeons are no exception—have the habit of regimenting 
these practices based on dubious evidence. The use of masks,

impermeable surgical drapes, hospital-laundered surgical 
scrubs, and modern surgical gowns—all staples of infection 
control in the operating room—were not guided by clinical 
studies [14]. As with many practices in medicine, behaviors 
passed down from one generation to the next become common 
practice and are subsequently mandated by governing bodies 
[15, 16]. In fact, the argument for many of these practices is as 
much about protecting healthcare workers from their patients 
as it is protecting patients from healthcare workers’ germs.
WHERE DO GUIDELINES COME FROM—AND WHY 
FOLLOW THEM?
Many organizations deliver guidelines for conduct in the oper-
ating room, namely, the World Health Organization (WHO), 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and 
AORN. Of these, the AORN guidelines provide far greater detail 
about what we should and should not be wearing in the operat-
ing room, how to launder operating room garments, and how to 
wear them. The recent WHO guideline, using strict Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) evidence criteria, simply recommends a sterile 
gown that can be either disposable or reusable [17]. The CDC 
guidelines from 1999 discuss the literature and describe cur-
rent practices, admitting that there is little or no good evidence 
in this area except for use of gloves [18]. The British National 
Guidelines similarly recommend wearing a “sterile gown” and 
to “consider wearing 2 pairs of sterile gloves”—and that is the 
extent of their surgical attire mandates [19]. But guidelines 
are recommendations only; policies—national, state, or hos-
pital specific—are enforceable. The evolution of guidelines to 
become policies, at least in the United States, is as convoluted as 
evaluating the evidence itself. State departments of health and 
the Joint Commission, the 2 most important regulatory bodies, 
expect hospitals to have the processes in place to develop their 
own policies around operating room attire (Kathy Ostrowski, 
oral communication, March 2017). If those policies follow a 
national guideline, there are no further questions. However, 
when these are different from established guidelines—such as 
those from CDC or AORN—it raises eyebrows and leads to fur-
ther inquisition as to the rationale of those policies. No hospital 
administrator wants to raise the eyebrows of these regulatory 
bodies; the easier solution is to adopt established guidelines.
Hospital infection control committees are often composed of 
clinicians and administrators with many other demands. This, 
in turn, means that societies’ guidelines are used as proxies for 
“expert opinion” even by experts themselves, since researching 
and summarizing the current state of medical knowledge is 
resource and time-intensive. Even though policy is drafted by 
hospitals, the democratization of decision making down to the 
hospital level has the effect of making guidelines into decrees 
which can be refuted but only at a high cost.
CAN’T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG?
Despite the debates mentioned above, there are areas of agree-
ment. We all want what is best for patients while preserving a 
supportive working environment. All agree that it behooves the 
system to reduce the incidence of surgical infections. All agree 
that germs (namely, bacteria) cause infections. All agree that 
patient characteristics (diabetes, age, comorbidities) contribute 
to the risk of developing an infection. With that in mind, and 
to understand the debate itself, it is important to understand 
some of the history and context behind our efforts at infection 
control.
After Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch provided convincing 
evidence for the germ theory, the idea of reducing bacterial 
counts became a proxy for infection control [20]. This led to the 
focus on reduction of airborne bacteria, either by preventing 
the bacteria from becoming airborne (eg, a face mask) or by 
rapid removal of the bacteria after they have already become 
airborne (eg, positive pressure rooms). Moreover, early studies 
identified the “skin squame” as the vehicle by which infectious 
organisms can travel from person to person in the hospital and 
particularly in the operating room. The assumption, therefore, 
was that more shedding of skin squames translates to more bac-
teria in the operating room air and thus to a higher risk of sur-
gical infection. Therein lies the rub. (“Therein lies the rub” is 
actually a misquotation from Shakespeare’s Hamlet when the 
titular character says, “Ay, there’s the rub.” We decided to stick 
with the colloquial—though incorrect—form.)
In a review of the evidence linking infectious risk and staff
 
behavior, Birgand and colleagues concluded: “Published data 
about the impact of operating-room behaviors on the risk of 
infection are limited and heterogeneous. All studies exhibit 
major methodological flaws” [21]. With that as a backdrop, let’s 
discuss some specifics.
THE RIGHT 
TO BARE ARMS
On the topic of covering the arms, AORN recommends: “When 
in the restricted areas, all nonscrubbed personnel should 
completely cover their arms with a long-sleeved scrub top or 
jacket” [1]. Interestingly, AORN’s recommendations and the 
United Kingdom’s NICE’s requirements are contradictory: As 
above, AORN recommends wearing a “long-sleeved scrub top 
or jacket,” whereas NICE’s policy is “bare below the elbows” [1, 
22]. The fact that 2 large, guideline-producing bodies would 
recommend completely opposing practices under the rubric of 
evidence-based medicine is suspicious. Old studies looking at 
airborne bacteria show, among other things, that women wear-
ing stockings shed more bacteria than women with bare legs 
[23]. NICE took the stance that handwashing is what is key and 
clothing with sleeves does not affect bacterial colony counts, but 
that it could affect practitioners’ abilities to wash their hands. 
This conclusion too has been refuted [7].

 HEALTHCARE EPIDEMIOLOGY • CID 2017:65 (1 November) • 1591
Interestingly, the further we dive into the topic of skin 
squames, the muddier the water seems to get. For example, 
men shed twice as many bacteria as women, yet there has 
never been—nor would we advocate for—a restriction on men 
in the operating room [24]. The release of airborne bacteria 
from scrub suits and street clothes was studied and found to 
be nearly equal, yet, again, scrubs remain the standard [25]. 
In another study, which itself is cited in both the most recent 
WHO and CDC guidelines, subjects wearing “outdoor cloth-
ing” shed fewer bacteria than subjects wearing scrubs [26]. The 
authors concluded: “Leaving aside considerations of comfort 
and hygiene of the staff, it is concluded that outdoor clothing 
need not be removed before entering an operating theatre (or 
clear area) provided that a gown, mask, etc. are worn.” Another 
set of studies reached an even more drastic conclusion: Naked 
men shed approximately a third to a half as many bacteria as the 
same men wearing street clothes or scrub suits [27, 28]. Perhaps 
“scrubs” actually live up to their name: rather than “catching” 
squames, which the skin sheds perpetually, they may in fact 
be “scrubbing” these bacteria-laden squames from our skin. 
If we are to adhere to the strict prescription of evidence-based 
medicine, ought we to disrobe prior to entry into the operating 
room? We argue no, although for reasons that are outside of 
how it would affect bacterial counts in the operating room.
ENOUGH 
TO HANG OUR HATS ON?
On the topic of hats, AORN recommends that “a clean surgi-
cal head cover or hood that confines all hair and completely 
covers the ears, scalp skin, sideburns, and nape of the neck 
should be worn” and rated the evidence as “level 2: moderate” 
[1]. Interestingly, the only “evidence” that is cited by AORN for 
covering the ears and every last bit of hair is that they contain 
bacteria that might fall into the surgical wound. They agree that 
there is no evidence of any difference in surgical site infection 
(SSI) rates, but they refer to the risk of increasing the number 
of airborne bacteria. As far as we know, this has neither been 
established nor studied systematically for a very long time.
As argument for their recommendations, AORN cites a report 
from 1990 published in the New England Journal of Medicine 
that highlighted an outbreak of 20 postoperative wound infec-
tions caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) [29]. Extensive 
testing identified the source as “a technician who entered oper-
ating rooms before but not during operations” who had psoriatic 
lesions on his scalp. It seems that covering the ears and all hair 
would not have made a difference in this case. Moreover, the 
same study notes that in 8 of the 12 outbreaks of GAS between 
1965 and 1990, the carriers were identified to have the causative 
bacteria in their rectum or vagina. Another study investigat-
ing sternal wound infections cited by AORN concludes: “The 
patients’ sternal skin was the main source for wound contam-
ination with MRSE [methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epi-
dermidis]” [30]. Other case studies have identified sinusitis and 
onychomycosis in healthcare workers as likely contaminants in 
outbreaks [31, 32]. The logical connection to ears-and-hair-as-
culprit remains unclear.
In 1963, a study in 330 clean operations reported that all 
operating room air samples were positive for bacteria averaging 
187 colonies/square foot/hour. There were 22 SSIs (6.7%) and in 
only one did the SSI organism match bacteria from the air sam-
ple. Notably, that organism was also present in the patient’s nose 
[33]. The authors concluded that “atmospheric contamination 
was found to be an unimportant factor in the development of 
wound sepsis.” In fact, it is entirely possible that hats that cover 
the ears will rub off more skin squames and increase airborne 
bacteria, although even that may not affect SSI rates. Recently, 
a large retrospective review by Shallwani et al noted no statis-
tically significant change in the SSI rate from 13 months before 
to 13 months after the new AORN policies [34]. Given utter 
absence of evidence supporting this policy and newer evidence 
refuting it, there is little reason to support the AORN recom-
mendations regarding head covering.
GIVE HIM A MASK AND HE WILL 
TELL 
YOU 
THE TRUTH
On the topic of masks, AORN recommends that “surgical 
masks in combination with eye protection devices, such as gog-
gles, glasses with solid side shields, or chin-length face shields, 
must be worn whenever splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of 
blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials may 
be generated and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be rea-
sonably anticipated” [1]. Here, the debate is less vivacious, but it 
serves as an example of a habit that is not borne out in the evi-
dence. The AORN guidelines astutely recognize this and note 
that the surgical mask really serves 2 roles: supposedly protect-
ing the patient and assuredly protecting the providers [1]. We 
wear surgical masks in the operating room and have been doing 
so for nearly 100 years [13]. Perhaps this is simply because it’s 
the way “we’ve always done it” [35]. In 2002, a Cochrane review 
did not show a significant difference in postoperative surgical 
wound infection between masked and unmasked providers [16, 
36]. In fact, the nonsignificant difference favored not wearing 
a mask. Deep down, surgical masks protect the wearer, and 
perhaps for that reason, no one is rushing to remove them. 
However, masks have never been shown to be helpful in reduc-
ing SSIs [35, 37, 38].
In sum, the data are conflicting or at least suggest practices 
that may be of marginal benefit but fly in the face of societal 
norms (again, think of naked surgeons without face masks). 
Moreover, there are other considerations when mandating 
a policy in the hospital aside from direct effects on infection 
control: how patients perceive their caretakers, how caretakers 
interact with one another, and how efficiently patients move 
through the system [7, 39]. Male caretakers still wear ties, 
female practitioners wear jewelry, and both wear white coats,

although from a strict infection control standpoint, some have 
advocated that we should abolish these habits [6, 40, 41]. Yes, 
there are other factors at stake: Patients prefer their physicians 
to look the part!
From the standpoint of infection control, should we require 
surgical caps to cover the ears and all hair? It’s tough to say, but 
the data do not suggest so. Is it right to remain naked beneath 
surgical gowns? Not as far as employee satisfaction is concerned. 
We suggest a balanced approach to operating room attire poli-
cies that considers the data, the lack of data, and ancillary fac-
tors that affect the patient and provider experience.
