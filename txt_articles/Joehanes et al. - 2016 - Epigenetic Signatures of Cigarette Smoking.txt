Background—DNA methylation leaves a long-term signature of smoking exposure and is one potential mechanism by 
which tobacco exposure predisposes to adverse health outcomes, such as cancers, osteoporosis, lung, and cardiovascular 
disorders.
Methods and Results—To comprehensively determine the association between cigarette smoking and DNA methylation, 
we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation assessed using the Illumina BeadChip 450K array 
on 15 907 blood-derived DNA samples from participants in 16 cohorts (including 2433 current, 6518 former, and 6956 
never smokers). Comparing current versus never smokers, 2623 cytosine–phosphate–guanine sites (CpGs), annotated to 
1405 genes, were statistically significantly differentially methylated at Bonferroni threshold of P<1×10−7 (18 760 CpGs 
at false discovery rate <0.05). Genes annotated to these CpGs were enriched for associations with several smoking-
related traits in genome-wide studies including pulmonary function, cancers, inflammatory diseases, and heart disease. 
Comparing former versus never smokers, 185 of the CpGs that differed between current and never smokers were 
significant P<1×10−7 (2623 CpGs at false discovery rate <0.05), indicating a pattern of persistent altered methylation, 
with attenuation, after smoking cessation. Transcriptomic integration identified effects on gene expression at many 
differentially methylated CpGs.

 Joehanes et al  Epigenetic Signatures of Cigarette Smoking  437
Conclusions—Cigarette smoking has a broad impact on genome-wide methylation that, at many loci, persists many years 
after smoking cessation. Many of the differentially methylated genes were novel genes with respect to biological effects 
of smoking and might represent therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of tobacco-related diseases. Methylation at 
these sites could also serve as sensitive and stable biomarkers of lifetime exposure to tobacco smoke.  (Circ Cardiovasc 
Genet. 2016;9:436-447. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001506.)

C
igarette smoking is a major causal risk factor for vari-
ous diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,1 and osteoporosis.1 
Worldwide cessation campaigns and legislative actions have 
been accompanied by a reduction in the number of cigarette 
smokers and corresponding increases in the number of former 
smokers. In the United States, there are more former smokers 
than current smokers.1 Despite the decline in the prevalence of 
smoking in many countries, it remains the leading preventable 
cause of death in the world, accounting for ≈6 million deaths 
each year.2
Clinical Perspective on p 447
Even decades after cessation, cigarette smoking confers 
long-term risk of diseases including some cancers, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and stroke.1 The mechanisms 
for these long-term effects are not well understood. DNA 
methylation changes have been proposed as one possible 
explanation.
DNA methylation seems to reflect exposure to a variety 
of lifestyle factors,3 including cigarette smoking. Several 
studies have shown reproducible associations between 
tobacco smoking and altered DNA methylation at multiple 
cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites (CpGs).4–15 Some 
DNA methylation sites associated with tobacco smoking 
have also localized to genes related to coronary heart dis-
ease5 and pulmonary disease.16 Some studies have found 
differently associated CpGs in smokers versus nonsmok-
ers.8,11 Consortium-based meta-analyses have been extremely 
successful in identifying genetic variants associated with 
numerous phenotypes, but large-scale meta-analyses of 
genome-wide DNA methylation data have not yet been 
widely used. It is likely that additional novel loci differen-
tially methylated in response to cigarette smoking remain to 
be discovered by meta-analyzing data across larger sample 
sizes comprising multiple cohorts. Differentially methyl-
ated loci with respect to smoking may serve as biomarkers 
of lifetime smoking exposure. They may also shed light on 
the molecular mechanisms by which tobacco exposure pre-
disposes to multiple diseases.
A recent systematic review13 analyzed published find-
ings across 14 epigenome-wide association studies of smok-
ing exposure across various DNA methylation platforms of 
varying degrees of coverage and varying phenotypic defini-
tions. Among these were 12 studies (comprising 4750 sub-
jects) that used the more comprehensive Illumina Human 
Methylation BeadChip 450K array (Illumina 450K), which 
includes and greatly expands on the coverage of the earlier 
27K platform. The review compares only statistically sig-
nificant published results and is not a meta-analysis that can 
identify signals that do not reach statistical significance in 
individual studies.17
In the current study, we meta-analyzed association 
results between DNA methylation and cigarette smoking in 
15 907 individuals from 16 cohorts in the CHARGE con-
sortium (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic 
Epidemiology) using a harmonized analysis. Methylation 
was measured on DNA extracted from blood samples using 
the Illumina Human Methylation BeadChip 450K array. In 
separate analyses, we compared current smokers and past 
smokers with nonsmokers and characterized the persistence 
of smoking-related CpG methylation associations with the 
duration of smoking cessation among former smokers. We 
integrated information from genome-wide association stud-
ies (GWAS) and gene expression data to gain insight into 
potential functional relevance of our findings for human dis-
eases. Finally, we conducted analyses to identify pathways 
that may explain the molecular effects of cigarette exposure 
on tobacco-related diseases.
Materials and Methods
Study Participants
This study comprised a total of 15 907 participants from 16 co-
horts of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genetic 
Epidemiology Consortium (Table I in the Data Supplement). 
The 16 participating cohorts are ARIC, FHS Offspring, KORA 
F4, GOLDN, LBC 1921, LBC 1936, NAS, Rotterdam, Inchianti, 
GTP, CHS European Ancestry (EA), CHS African Ancestry (AA), 
GENOA, EPIC Norfolk, EPIC, and MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis). Of these, 12 161 are of EA and 3746 are of AA. 
The study was approved by institutional review committees for each 
cohort, and all participants provided written informed consent for 
genetic research.
DNA Methylation Sample and Measurement
For most studies, methylation was measured on DNA extracted from 
whole blood, but some studies used CD4+ T cells or monocytes (Table 
I in the Data Supplement). In all studies, DNA was bisulfite converted 
using the Zymo EZ DNA methylation kit and assayed for methyla-
tion using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip, which 
contains 485 512 CpG sites. Details of genomic DNA preparation, 
bisulfite conversion, and methylation assay for each cohort can be 
found in the Data Supplement.
Raw methylated and total probe intensities were extracted using 
the Illumina Genome Studio methylation module. Preprocessing 
of the methylated signal (M) and unmethylated signal (U) was 
conducted using various software tools, primarily DASEN of wa-
teRmelon18 and BMIQ,19 both of which are R packages. The meth-
ylation beta (β) values were defined as β=M/(M+U). Each cohort 
followed its own quality-control protocols, removing poor quality 
or outlier samples and excluding low-quality CpG sites (with detec-
tion P value >0.01). Each cohort evaluated batch effects and con-
trolled for them in the analysis. Details of these processes can be 
found in the Data Supplement.

Smoking Phenotype Definition
Self-reported cigarette-smoking status was divided into 3 categories. 
Current smokers were defined as those who have smoked at least 1 
cigarette a day within 12 months before the blood draw, former smok-
ers were defined as those who had ever smoked at least 1 cigarette a 
day but had stopped at least 12 months before the blood draw, and 
never smokers reported never having smoked. Pack years was calcu-
lated based on self-report as the average number of cigarettes smoked 
per day divided by 20 multiplied by the number of years of smok-
ing, with zero assigned to never smokers. A few cohorts recorded 
the number of years since each former smoker had stopped smoking.
Cohort-Specific Analyses and Meta-Analysis
Each cohort analyzed its data using at least 2 linear mixed-effect 
models. Each model was run separately for each CpG site. Model 1 
is as follows:
β =
+
+
+
+
smoking phenotype
sex
age
blood count
technical covariates
 
(1)
where blood count comprises the fractions of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ 
T cells, NK cells, monocyte, and eosinophils either measured or es-
timated using the Houseman et al method.20 The blood count adjust-
ment was performed only in cohorts with whole-blood and leukocyte 
samples. Familial relationship was also accounted for in the model 
when applicable (eg, for FHS, see Data Supplement for details). 
Acknowledging that each cohort may be influenced by a unique set of 
technical factors, we allow each cohort to choose its cohort-specific 
technical covariates. Model 2 added to model 1 body mass index be-
cause it is associated with methylation at some loci, making it a po-
tential confounder.21 Only 3 cohorts participated in model 2 analysis: 
FHS, KORA, and NAS. Model 3 substituted smoking phenotypes for 
pack years. Only 3 cohorts participated in model 3 analysis: FHS, 
Rotterdam, and Inchianti. The pack-year analysis was performed only 
on 2 subsets: current versus never smokers and former versus never 
smokers. Combining all 3 categories would require accurate records 
of time of quitting, which among the 3 cohorts was available for only 
FHS. To investigate cell type differences, we removed blood counts 
from model 1 and called it model 4. Only 3 cohorts participated in this 
analysis: FHS, KORA, and NAS. All models were run with the lme4 
package22 in R,23 except for FHS (see Data Supplement for details).
Meta-analysis was performed to combine the results from all co-
horts. Because of the variability of available CpG sites after qual-
ity-control steps, we excluded CpG sites that were available in <3 
cohorts. The remaining 485 381 CpG sites were then meta-analyzed 
with a random-effects model using the following formula:
E
s
e
i
i
i
=
+
+
µ
 
(2)
where Ei is the observed effect of study i, μ is the main smoking 
effect, si is the between-study error for study i, and ei is the within-
study error for study i, with both si and ei are assumed to be normally 
distributed. The model is fitted using the restricted maximum likeli-
hood criterion in R’s metafor24 package. Multiple-testing adjustment 
on the resulting P values was performed using the false discovery 
rate (FDR) method of Benjamini and Hochberg.25 In addition, we 
also report results using the Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 1×10−7 
(≈0.05/485 381).
The regression coefficient β (from meta-analysis) is interpretable 
as the difference in mean methylation between current and never 
smokers. We multiplied these by 100 to represent the percentage 
methylation difference where methylation ranges from 0% to 100%.
Literature Review to Identify Genes Previously 
Associated With Smoking and Methylation
We used the same literature search strategy published previously.26 
A broad query of NCBIs PubMed literature database using medical 
subject heading (MeSH) terms (“((((DNA Methylation[Mesh]) OR 
methylation)) AND ((Smoking[Mesh]) OR smoking))”) yielded 775 
results when initially performed on January 8, 2015, and 789 studies 
when repeated to update the results on March 1, 2015. Results were 
reviewed by abstract to determine whether studies met inclusion cri-
teria: (1) performed in healthy human populations, (2) agnostically 
examined >1000 CpG sites at a time, (3) only cigarette exposure was 
considered, and (4) with public reporting of P values and gene an-
notations. A total of 25 publications met inclusion criteria, listed in 
the fourth supplementary table of Joubert et al.26 CpG-level results 
(P values and gene annotations) for sites showing genome-wide sta-
tistically significant associations (FDR <0.05) were extracted and 
resulted in 1185 genes previously associated with adult or maternal 
smoking. All CpGs annotated to these 1185 genes were marked as 
previously found.
Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis
Gene-set enrichment analysis27 was performed in the website (http://
software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/annotate.jsp) on significant 
findings to determine putative functions of the CpG sites. We selected 
gene ontology biological process (C5-BP) and collected all categories 
with FDR <0.05 (≤100 categories).
Enrichment Analysis for Localization to Different 
Genomic Features
Enrichment analysis on genomic features were performed using the 
annotation file supplied by Illumina (version 1.2; downloaded from 
manufacturer’s website, http://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/
infinium_humanmethylation450_beadchip_kit/downloads.html), 
which contains information of CpG location relative to gene (ie, 
body, first exon, 3′ UTR, 5′ UTR, within 200 base pairs of transcrip-
tional start site [TSS200], and within 1500 base pairs of transcription-
al start site [TSS1500], the relation of CpG site to a CpG island (ie, 
island, northern shelf, northern shore, southern shelf, and southern 
shore), whether the CpG site is known to be in differentially methyl-
ated regions, and whether the CpG site is known to be an enhancer 
or a DNAse I hypersensitive site. Enrichment analysis was performed 
using 1-sided Fisher exact set for each feature, using R’s fisher.test.
GWAS Analysis
We intersected our results with single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) having GWAS P values ≤5×10−8 in the National Human 
Genome Research Institute GWAS catalog (accessed November 2, 
2015).28 The catalog contained 9777 SNPs annotated to 7075 genes 
associated with 865 phenotypes at P≤5×10−8. To determine the genes, 
we looked up each significant CpG on the annotation file supplied 
by Illumina. Enrichment analysis was performed on a per-gene basis 
using 1-sided Fisher exact test.
For bone mineral phenotype enrichment, we included all SNPs 
containing terms bone mineral density or osteoporosis. For cardio-
vascular disease, we included all SNPs containing terms cardiovascu-
lar disease, stroke, coronary disease, cardiomyopathy, or myocardial 
infarction. For cardiovascular disease risk factors, we included all 
SNPs containing terms blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, 
or hypertension. For overall cancer enrichment, we included all SNPs 
containing terms cancer, carcinoma, or lymphoma, while removing 
those pertaining to cancer treatment effects. For overall pulmonary 
phenotype enrichment, we included all SNPs containing terms pul-
monary disease, pulmonary function, emphysema, asthma, or airflow 
obstruction.
Analysis of Persistence of Methylation Signals 
With Time Since Quitting Smoking Among Former 
Smokers
We examined whether smoking methylation associations were at-
tenuated over time in the FHS cohort, which had ascertained lon-
gitudinal smoking status of >35 years. The analysis was performed 
on 7 dichotomous variables, indicating cessation of smoking for 5, 
10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years versus never smokers. For example, for 
5-year cessation variable, those who quit smoking before ≥5 years

 Joehanes et al  Epigenetic Signatures of Cigarette Smoking  439
are marked as ones, whereas never smokers are marked as zeroes, 
and current smokers are excluded. For this analysis, we used the pedi-
greemm package29 with the same set of covariates as in the primary 
analysis. Sites with P<0.002 across all 7 variables were deemed to be 
statistically significant compared with never-smoker levels.
Methylation by Expression Analysis
To determine transcriptomic association of each significant CpG site, 
we interrogated such CpG sites in the FHS gene-level methylation 
by expression database, at genome-wide FDR <0.05. The methyla-
tion by expression database was constructed from 2262 individuals 
from the FHS Offspring cohort attending examination cycle 8 (2005–
2008) with both whole-blood DNA methylation and transcriptomic 
data based on the Affymetrix Human Exon Array ST 1.0. Enrichment 
analysis was performed using a 1-sided Fisher exact test. We defined 
that the methylation CpG site and the corresponding transcript are as-
sociated in cis if the location of the CpG site is within 500 kilobases 
of the transcript’s start location.
Analysis of Ethnic Discrepancy Between AA and EA 
Cohorts
Meta-analysis of the current versus never smoker results of EA 
cohorts (FHS, KORA, GOLDN, LBC 1921, LBC 1936, NAS, 
Rotterdam, Inchianti, EPIC, EPIC Norfolk, MESA, and CHS-EA) 
was performed separately from those of AA cohorts (ARIC, GTP, 
GENOA, and CHS-AA).
Analysis of Sample Types for DNA Extraction
Meta-analysis was performed on the results from cohorts with whole 
blood/buffy coat samples (FHS, KORA, LBC 1921, LBC 1936, NAS, 
Rotterdam, Inchianti, GTP, CHS-EA, CHS-AA, ARIC, GENOA, 
EPIC, and EPIC Norfolk). CD4+ samples in GOLDN and CD14+ 
samples in MESA, because they comprise single cohorts, are not me-
ta-analyzed. Correlations of results across different cell types were 
performed on CpG sites with FDR <0.05 in at least one cell type.
Results
Table 1 displays the characteristics of participants in the meta-
analysis. The proportion of participants reporting current 
smoking ranged from 4% to 33% across the different study 
populations. The characteristics of the participants within 
each cohort are provided in Table I in the Data Supplement.
Current Versus Never Smokers
In the meta-analysis of current cigarette smokers (n=2433) 
versus never smokers (n=6956), 2623 CpGs annotated to 1405 
genes met Bonferroni significance after correction for 485 381 
tests (P<1×10−7). On the basis of genome-wide FDR< 0.05, 
18 760 CpGs annotated to 7201 genes were differentially 
methylated. There was a moderate inflation factor30 λ of 1.32 
(Figure I in the Data Supplement), which is consistent with a 
large number of sites being impacted by smoking. Our results 
lend support to many previously reported loci,7,8,11,13 including 
CpGs annotated to AHRR, RARA, F2RL3, and LRRN3 (Table 
II in the Data Supplement). Not surprisingly, cg05575921 
annotated to AHRR, the top CpG identified in most previous 
studies of smoking, was highly significant in our meta-analysis 
(P=4.6×10−26; ranked 36, Table II in the Data Supplement) and 
also had the largest effect size (−18% difference in methyla-
tion), which is comparable to effect sizes in previous studies.18 
Of the 18 760 significant CpGs at FDR <0.05, 16 673 (anno-
tated to 6720 genes) have not been previously reported to be 
associated with cigarette smoking—these include 1500 of the 
2623 CpGs that met Bonferroni significance. The 25 CpGs 
with lowest P values for both overall and novel findings are 
shown in Table 2. Table II in the Data Supplement provides 
the complete list of all CpGs that were significantly differen-
tially methylated (FDR <0.05) in analysis of current versus 
never smokers. Adding body mass index into the model did not 
appreciably alter the results (Figure II in the Data Supplement).
Methylation can be either reduced or increased at CpG 
sites in response to smoking. For the 53.2% of FDR-significant 
CpGs with increased methylation in response to current smok-
ing, the mean percentage difference in methylation between 
current and never smokers was 0.5% (SD=0.37%; range, 
0.06–7.3%). For 46.8% of CpGs with decreased methylation 
in response to current smoking, the mean percentage differ-
ence was 0.65% (SD=0.56; range, 0.04–18%) The volcano 
plot can be found in Figure III in the Data Supplement.
We did not observe correlation between the number of 
significant CpGs and either the size of the gene or the num-
ber of exons or the coverage of the methylation platform. We 
performed a formal enrichment test for each of the 7201 genes 
in regard to the length of the gene or number of exons and 
found only 3 for which associations were observed (AHRR, 
PRRT1, and TNF). However, given the robust findings for a 
specific CpG in AHRR in multiple studies in the literature4,7,9 
and our own, and its key role in the AHR pathway, which is 
crucial in response to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as are 
produced by smoking,31 it seems unlikely that the AHRR find-
ings are false positives. Likewise, there is strong support in the 
literature for PRRT132 and TNF.33 The enrichment results for 
methylation platform coverage also yielded the same 3 genes.
In a subset of 3 cohorts (1827 subjects), we investigated 
the association of the number of pack years smoked with the 
18 760 CpGs that were differentially methylated (FDR <0.05) 
between current versus never smokers. Significant dose 
responses were observed for 11 267 CpGs (60.1%) at FDR 
<0.05 (Table III in the Data Supplement).
To investigate the pathways implicated by these genes, we 
performed a gene-set enrichment analysis34 on the annotated 
genes. The results suggested that cigarette smoking is associated 
with potential changes in numerous vital molecular processes, 
such as signal transduction (FDR=2.8×10−79), protein meta-
bolic processes (FDR=1.2×10−43), and transcription pathways 
(FDR=8.4×10−31). The complete list of 99 enriched molecular 
processes can be found in Table IV in the Data Supplement.
Former Versus Never Smokers
Meta-analysis of former (n=6518) versus never smokers 
(n=6956) restricted to the 18 760 CpG sites that were dif-
ferentially methylated in current versus never smokers iden-
tified 2568 CpGs annotated to 1326 genes at FDR <0.05 
(Table V in the Data Supplement). There were 185 CpGs 
(annotated to 149 genes) that also met Bonferroni correction 
(P<0.05/18760≈2.67×10−6). There was no evidence of infla-
tion30 (λ=0.98) (Figure IV in the Data Supplement). We also 
confirmed previously reported findings for CpGs annotated to 
AHRR, RARA, and LRRN3.7,8,11,13 Effect sizes of these CpGs 
were all weaker than that in the analysis of current versus 
never smokers (61.2%±15.3% weaker) for the 2568 CpGs

 440  Circ Cardiovasc Genet  October 2016
that remained significantly differentially methylated in for-
mer versus never smokers compared with current versus never 
smokers. Results for the top 25 CpGs are displayed in Table 3. 
Adding body mass index to the model did not appreciably 
alter the results (Figure V in the Data Supplement). A volcano 
plot can be found in Figure VI in the Data Supplement. In a 
subset of 3 cohorts (3349 subjects), analyses using pack years 
confirmed a significant dose response for 1804 of the 2568 
CpGs (70%) annotated to 942 genes at FDR <0.05 (Table VI 
in the Data Supplement).
The gene-set enrichment analysis27 in the former versus 
never smoker analyses on all 1326 genes revealed enrich-
ment for genes associated with protein metabolic processes 
(FDR=1.1×10−23), RNA metabolic processes (FDR=1.4×10−17), 
and transcription pathways (FDR=3.9×10−18; Table VII in the 
Data Supplement). The gene-set enrichment analysis on the 
942 genes for which the 1804 CpGs exhibited dose responses 
with pack years also revealed similar pathways to those sum-
marized in Table VII in the Data Supplement, except with 
weaker enrichment FDR values.
In 2648 Framingham Heart Study participants with ≤30 
years of prospectively collected smoking data, we examined 
the 2568 CpGs that were differentially methylated in meta-
analysis of former versus never smokers and explored their 
associations with time since smoking cessation. Methylation 
levels of most CpGs returned toward that of never smokers 
within 5 years of smoking cessation. However, 36 CpGs anno-
tated to 19 genes, including TIAM2, PRRT1, AHRR, F2RL3, 
GNG12, LRRN3, APBA2, MACROD2, and PRSS23, did not 
return to never-smoker levels even after 30 years of smoking 
cessation (Figure; Table 4).
The EPIC studies included cancer cases plus noncancer 
controls analyzed together, adjusting for cancer status. The 
other studies were population-based samples not selected for 
disease status. To evaluate residual confounding by cancer sta-
tus after adjustment, we repeated the meta-analysis without 
the EPIC studies. The effect estimates were highly correlated: 
Pearson ρ=0.99 for current versus never smoking and 0.98 for 
former smoking versus never.
Enrichment Analysis for Genes Identified in GWAS 
of Smoking-Related Phenotypes
To identify potential relevance of the differentially methyl-
ated genes to smoking-related phenotypes, we determined 
whether these genes had been associated with smoking-
related phenotypes in the National Human Genome Research 
Institute-EBI GWAS Catalog28 (accessed November 2, 
2015). The catalog contained 9777 SNPs annotated to 7075 
genes associated with 865 phenotypes at P≤5×10−8. Of the 
7201 genes (mapped by 18 760 CpG sites) significantly dif-
ferentially methylated in current versus never smokers, we 
found overlap with 1791 genes (4187 CpGs are mapped to 
these) associated in GWAS with 700 phenotypes (enrichment 
P=2.4×10−52). We identified smoking-related traits using the 
2014 US Surgeon General’s report.1 Enrichment results for a 
selection of smoking-related phenotypes, including coronary 
heart disease and its risk factors, various cancers, inflamma-
tory diseases, osteoporosis, and pulmonary traits, are avail-
able in Table 5. We also performed the same enrichment 
analysis on the 2568 CpGs associated with former versus 
never-smoking status. We identified enrichment for coronary 
heart disease, pulmonary traits, and some cancers (Table 5). 
More detailed results are available in Tables VIII and IX in 
the Data Supplement. Differentially methylated genes in 
relation to smoking status that are associated in GWAS with 
coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease risk factors 
are available in Table X in the Data Supplement. We also 
performed enrichment analyses on phenotypes that have no 
clear relationships to smoking, such as male pattern baldness 
(P=0.0888), myopia (P=0.1070), thyroid cancer (P=0.2406), 
and testicular germ cell tumor (P=0.3602) and did not find 
significant enrichment.
Enrichment Analysis for Genomic Features
We examined the differentially methylated CpGs with respect 
to localization to different genomic regions including CpG 
islands, gene bodies, known differentially methylated regions, 
and sites identified as likely to be functionally important in the 
ENCODE project such as DNAse1 hypersensitivity sites and 
enhancers (refer to the Methods section for details). We per-
formed this analysis separately for the CpGs related to current 
smoking and past smoking (Table XI in the Data Supplement). 
Trends were similar for the 2 sets of CpGs, although the power 
to identify enrichment was much greater for the larger set of 
18 760 CpGs related to current smoking. There was no enrich-
ment for CpG islands. In contrast, significant enrichment was 
observed for island shores, gene bodies, DNAse1 hypersensi-
tivity sites, and enhancers.
Transcriptomic Integration
Of the 18 760 statistically significant CpG sites associated 
with current smoking in the meta-analysis, 1430 were signifi-
cantly associated in cis with the expression of 924 genes at 
FDR <0.05 (enrichment P=3.6×10−215; Table XII in the Data 
Supplement) using whole-blood samples from 2262 Fram-
ingham Heart Study participants. Of these, 424 CpGs associ-
ated with the expression of 285 genes were replicated at FDR 
<0.0001 in 1264 CD14+ samples from the MESA.35 These

genes are associated with pathways similar to those described 
earlier (Table XIII in the Data Supplement).
Comparison Between AA and EA
Meta-analysis of the current versus never smokers in 11 
cohorts with participants of EA (n=6750 subjects) yielded 
10 977 CpGs annotated to 4940 genes at FDR <0.05. Meta-
analysis of the results of the smaller data set of 4 cohorts with 
AA participants (n=2639) yielded 3945 CpGs annotated to 
2088 genes at FDR <0.05. The effect estimates of the CpGs 
significant in at least one ancestry (12 927 CpGs) were highly 
correlated in the combined group of individuals of either 
ancestry (Spearman ρ=0.89). The results by ancestry are 
shown in Table XIV in the Data Supplement.
We performed the same ancestry-stratified analysis on for-
mer versus never smokers (Table XV in the Data Supplement). 
Meta-analysis of the results of EA participants yielded 2045 
CpG sites annotated to 1081 genes at FDR <0.05. Meta-
analysis of the results of AA participants yielded 329 CpG 
sites annotated to 178 genes at FDR <0.05. The effect esti-
mates of the union of CpGs significant in at least one ances-
try (2234 CpGs) were correlated in the combined group of 
individuals of either ancestry (Spearman ρ=0.75). Of note, 
one of CpG sites showing differential methylation in ances-
try, cg00706683, mapped to gene ECEL1P2, did not return 
to never-smoker levels 30 years after smoking cessation 
(Table 4).
To more directly compare results by ethnicity, removing 
the effect of better statistical power in the larger EA sample 
size, we performed a meta-analysis on subset of EA cohorts: 
the Framingham Heart Study, Rotterdam Study, and KORA, 
such that the total number of smokers, the major determinant 
of power, would match that of AA cohorts. In this subset, sim-
ilar correlations of the effect estimates were observed as in the 
complete analyses, suggesting that the differences in number 
of statistically significant CpGs are indeed because of better 
power in the EA cohorts (Spearman ρ=0.87 and 0.79 for cur-
rent versus never smokers and former versus never smokers, 
respectively).
Cell Type Adjustment
We adjusted our main analyses for white blood cell fractions, 
in studies based on either whole blood or leukocytes from 
the buffy coat of whole blood, either measured or using a 
published method.20 Reassuringly, results before and after 
cell type adjustment were highly comparable. The correla-
tion of regression coefficients before and after adjustment 
is 0.85 for the current versus never-smoker analysis (Fig-
ure VII in the Data Supplement). Similarly for the analysis 
of former versus never smokers, the effect estimates were 
highly correlated before and after adjustment (ρ=0.93; Fig-
ure VIII in the Data Supplement). In addition, in 2 cohorts, 
we had results from specific cell fractions—CD4+ cells in 
GOLDN and CD14+ cells in MESA. The correlation of 
results between buffy coat and CD4+ or CD14+ for former 
versus never smokers are generally high (ρ>0.74; Table XVI 
in the Data Supplement).
Methylation Profile Across CpG Sites
We assessed methylation profile in FHS cohort as a represen-
tative cohort in the study. The profile of all 485 381 analyzed 
CpG sites can be found in Figure IX in the Data Supplement. 
The profile across 18 760 CpG sites significantly associated 
with current versus never smoking status can be found in Fig-
ure X in the Data Supplement. These plots indicate that most 
CpG sites with less dynamic range are largely not statistically 
significant in our results.
Discussion
We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of blood-derived 
DNA methylation in 15 907 individuals across 16 cohorts and 
identified broad epigenome-wide impact of cigarette smok-
ing, with 18 760 statistically significant CpGs (FDR <0.05) 
annotated to >7000 genes, or roughly one third of known 
human genes. These genes in turn affect multiple molecular 
mechanisms and are implicated in smoking-related pheno-
types and diseases. In addition to confirming previous findings 
from smaller studies, we detected >16 000 novel differentially 
methylated CpGs in response to cigarette smoking. Many of

these genes have not been previously implicated in the biolog-
ical effects of tobacco exposure. The large number of genes 
implicated in this well-powered meta-analysis might on first 
glance raise concerns about false positives. However, on fur-
ther consideration, given the widespread impact of smoking 
on disease outcomes across many organ systems and across 
the life span,1 the identification of a large number of genes at 
genome-wide significance is not surprising. In addition, our 
findings are robust and consistent across all 16 cohorts (Tables 
II and V in the Data Supplement) because we accounted for 
interstudy variability by using random-effect meta-analyses, 
which is conservative when heterogeneity is present.36 The 
implicated genes are mainly involved in molecular machin-
eries, such as transcription and translation. Furthermore, dif-
ferential methylation of a subset of CpGs persisted, often for 
decades, after smoking cessation.
We found that genes differentially methylated in relation 
to smoking are enriched for variants associated in GWAS with 
smoking-related diseases,1 including osteoporosis, colorectal 
cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary 
function, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. We 
find it noteworthy that there is enrichment of smoking-asso-
ciated CpGs for genes associated with rheumatoid arthritis 
because DNA methylation is one of the proposed molecular 
mechanisms underlying this disease.37 It is also interesting 
that the most significant association of smoking with methyla-
tion was for the gene HIVEP3 (a.k.a. Schnurri3), the mam-
malian homolog of the Drosophila zinc finger adapter protein 
Shn.38 This gene regulates bone formation, an important deter-
minant to osteoporosis, which was one of the enriched GWAS 
phenotypes.
When we examined time since smoking cessation, we 
found that the majority of the differentially methylated CpG 
sites observed in analysis of current versus never smokers 
returned to the level of never smokers within 5 years of smok-
ing cessation. This is consistent with the fact that risks of 
many smoking-related diseases revert to nonsmoking levels 
within this period of time. Our results also indicate that ciga-
rette smoking induces long-lasting alterations in DNA meth-
ylation at some CpGs. Although speculative, it is possible that

persistent methylation changes at some loci might contribute 
to risks of some conditions that remain elevated after smoking 
cessation.
In all but 2 of our 14 cohorts, DNA was extracted from 
the entire circulating leukocyte population. Thus, there is 
the possibility of confounding by the effects of smoking on 
differential cell counts. We attempted to adjust for cell type 
and found that results were generally little changed by the 
adjustment.
Our significant results are highly enriched for CpG sites 
associated with the expression of nearby genes (ie, in cis) even 
though a single measurement of gene expression in blood is 
probably subject to considerably more within-subject vari-
ability than DNA methylation,39 limiting our ability to find 
correlations. Differential DNA methylation at many of the 
CpGs we identified in relation to smoking status may have 
a functional impact on nearby gene expression. Our analysis 
of genomic regions further supports the potential functional 
impact of our findings on gene expression. We demonstrated 
enrichment for sites with greater functional impact, such as 
island shores, gene bodies, DNAse1 hypersensitivity sites, and 
enhancers, whereas we found no enrichment for CpG islands. 
These results reinforce previous findings showing that island 
shores, enhancers, and DNAse I hypersensitive sites are more 
dynamic (ie, susceptible to methylation changes) than CpG 
islands,40 which may be more resistant to abrupt changes in 
DNA methylation in response to environmental exposures.41 
Thus, our results suggest that many of the smoking-associated 
CpG sites may have regulatory effects.
Although identification of changes in methylation pat-
terns may suggest mechanisms by which exposure to 
tobacco smoke exerts its effects on several disease processes, 
DNA methylation profiles can also serve as biomarkers of 
exposure to tobacco smoke. Cotinine is a biomarker only of 
recent smoking; DNA methylation signals have the potential 
to serve as robust biomarkers of smoking history.9,42 Indeed, 
several studies have identified several of such markers.5,42,43

useful to develop even more robust biomarkers to objectively 
quantify long-term cigarette-smoking exposure for predic-
tion of risk for health outcomes in settings where smoking 
history is not available or is incomplete and to validate self-
reported never-smoker status. Furthermore, our analyses of 
both former and current smokers show dose-dependent effects 
at many CpGs (Tables III and VII in the Data Supplement). 
Methylation-based biomarkers could be informative for inves-
tigating dose–response relationships with disease end points. 
This is useful because smokers often under-report the amount 
of smoking, both current and historical.
It is possible that smoking-related conditions or cor-
related exposures may contribute to some of the methyla-
tion signatures identified. However, our studies are nearly 
all population-based studies composed of predominantly 
healthy individuals, not selected for smoking-related dis-
ease. Given the number, strength, and robustness to replica-
tion of findings for smoking across the literature and among 
our diverse cohorts from various countries, the likelihood 
that these are confounded by other exposures or conditions 
related to smoking is greatly reduced.
There are several potential limitations to our study. First, 
the cross-sectional design limits our ability to study the time 
course of smoking effects. In addition, we analyzed meth-
ylation in DNA samples from blood, which is readily acces-
sible. Although we demonstrated that blood-derived DNA 
reveals a strong and robust signature of cigarette-smoking 
exposure, studies in target tissues for smoking-related dis-
eases (eg, heart and lung) would be of additional interest. In 
addition, our analyses could not distinguish direct effects of 
smoking from indirect effects of smoking because of smok-
ing-induced changes in cell metabolism, organ function, 
inflammation, or injury that could in turn influence meth-
ylation. However, this is the largest examination to date of 
the effects of smoking on DNA methylation with 16 studies 
from different countries contributing.
In conclusion, we identify an order of magnitude more 
sites differentially methylated in relation to smoking across 
the genome than have been previously seen. Many of these 
signals persist long after smoking cessation, providing 
potential biomarkers of smoking history. These findings 
may provide new insights into molecular mechanisms 
underlying the protean effects of smoking on human health 
and disease.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
We combined data from 16 cohorts (15 907 individuals) examining genome-wide methylation, a type of epigenetic modifica-
tion, in blood DNA, in relation to smoking status. In this large-scale meta-analysis, thousands of DNA methylation cytosine-
p-guanine sites were associated with current versus never-smoking status. These methylation signals reside in genes that 
are associated with numerous diseases caused by cigarette smoking, such as cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers. 
Of the thousands of cytosine-p-guanine sites differentially methylated in current versus never smokers, >10% also were 
significantly associated with former versus never-smoking status. Although many of these former smoker methylation sig-
nals return to never-smoker levels with 5 years of quitting, a substantial proportion remain elevated even after 30 years of 
cessation. We also found widespread evidence that many differentially methylated sites also are related to gene expression, 
showing a functional impact on the genome. Furthermore, in our analyses, these cigarette-smoking DNA methylation signals 
affect genes important to fundamental molecular pathways, such as molecular signal transduction, protein metabolic pro-
cesses, and transcription. In conclusion, cigarette smoking has a widespread and long-lasting impact on DNA methylation. 
DNA methylation is one potential mechanism by which tobacco exposure predisposes to numerous adverse health outcomes.
