BACKGROUND
Reduced intake of n−3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) may be a con-
tributing factor to the increasing prevalence of wheezing disorders. We assessed the 
effect of supplementation with n−3 LCPUFAs in pregnant women on the risk of persis-
tent wheeze and asthma in their offspring.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 736 pregnant women at 24 weeks of gestation to receive 2.4 g of 
n−3 LCPUFA (fish oil) or placebo (olive oil) per day. Their children formed the Copenhagen 
Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 (COPSAC2010) cohort and were followed 
prospectively with extensive clinical phenotyping. Neither the investigators nor the par-
ticipants were aware of group assignments during follow-up for the first 3 years of the 
children’s lives, after which there was a 2-year follow-up period during which only the 
investigators were unaware of group assignments. The primary end point was persistent 
wheeze or asthma, and the secondary end points included lower respiratory tract infec-
tions, asthma exacerbations, eczema, and allergic sensitization.
RESULTS
A total of 695 children were included in the trial, and 95.5% completed the 3-year, 
double-blind follow-up period. The risk of persistent wheeze or asthma in the treatment 
group was 16.9%, versus 23.7% in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.035), corresponding to a relative reduction of 30.7%. 
Prespecified subgroup analyses suggested that the effect was strongest in the children 
of women whose blood levels of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were 
in the lowest third of the trial population at randomization: 17.5% versus 34.1% (hazard 
ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.83; P 
= 
0.011). Analyses of secondary end points showed 
that supplementation with n−3 LCPUFA was associated with a reduced risk of infections 
of the lower respiratory tract (31.7% vs. 39.1%; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.98; 
P 
= 
0.033), but there was no statistically significant association between supplementation 
and asthma exacerbations, eczema, or allergic sensitization.
CONCLUSIONS
Supplementation with n−3 LCPUFA in the third trimester of pregnancy reduced the ab-
solute risk of persistent wheeze or asthma and infections of the lower respiratory tract 
in offspring by approximately 7 percentage points, or one third. (Funded by the Lund-
beck Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00798226.)

LCPUFA in Pregnancy and Asthma in Offspring
T
he incidence of asthma and wheez-
ing disorders has more than doubled in 
westernized countries in recent decades.1 
These conditions often originate in early child-
hood2 and currently affect one in five young 
children.3 Concomitantly, the increased use of 
vegetable oils in cooking and of grain in the 
feeding of livestock has resulted in an increase 
in the intake of n−6 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
and a decrease in the intake of n−3 polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids, especially the long-chain poly-
unsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) — eicosapen-
taenoic acid (20:5n–3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic 
acid (22:6n–3, DHA) — found in cold-water fish.4 
Observational studies have suggested an associ-
ation between a diet that is deficient in n−3 
LCPUFA during pregnancy and an increased risk 
of asthma and wheezing disorders in offspring,5,6 
whereas randomized, controlled trials of n−3 
LCPUFA supplementation in pregnant women 
have generally been underpowered and have pro-
duced ambiguous results.7-10 Therefore, we con-
ducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled 
trial of n−3 LCPUFA supplementation during the 
third trimester of pregnancy to assess the effect 
on the risk of persistent wheeze and asthma in 
offspring. The children were followed prospec-
tively for the first 3 years of life with compre-
hensive clinical phenotyping,11 during which time 
both the investigators and the participants were 
unaware of group assignments. For an addi-
tional 2 years of follow-up, only the investigators 
were unaware of group assignments.
Methods
Study Design
In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, parallel-group trial, pregnant women 
between 22 and 26 weeks of gestation were re-
cruited into the Copenhagen Prospective Studies 
on Asthma in Childhood2010 (COPSAC2010) preg-
nancy cohort.11 Women taking more than 600 IU 
of vitamin D per day and women with any endo-
crine, heart, or kidney disorder were excluded. 
The trial was approved by the local ethics com-
mittee and the Danish Data Protection Agency. 
Both parents of each child provided oral and 
written informed consent before enrollment.
At week 24 of pregnancy, women were ran-
domly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2.4 g per 
day of n−3 LCPUFA (55% EPA and 37% DHA) in 
triacylglycerol form (Incromega TG33/22, Croda 
Health Care) or placebo (in the form of olive oil, 
containing 72% n–9 oleic acid and 12% n−6 
linoleic acid [Pharma-Tech A/S]). (For complete 
information on the components of Incromega 
TG33/22, see Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org. The trial protocol is also available 
at NEJM.org.) Both n−3 LCPUFA and placebo were 
administered in four identical 1-g capsules, with 
both investigators and participants unaware of 
group assignments. Neither the fish oil nor the 
placebo nor any medications, diagnostic equip-
ment, or other materials used in the trial were 
donated. Similarly, no funding agency played 
any role in the design or conduct of the trial, the 
collection, management, or interpretation of the 
data, the preparation, review, or approval of 
the manuscript for publication, or the decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication. In ad-
dition, no pharmaceutical company and no com-
pany that produces n−3 LCPUFA was involved in 
the trial. The intervention was funded solely by 
COPSAC.
Supplementation continued until 1 week after 
delivery, and both investigators and participants 
remained unaware of group assignments until 
the youngest child in the trial reached 3 years 
of age. The trial was continued for an additional 
2 years, during which the investigators determined 
whether children with persistent wheeze had 
asthma. Follow-up is still ongoing, with the in-
vestigators only (not the participants) remaining 
unaware of group assignments. A subgroup of 
623 women also participated in a trial with a 
nested, factorial design in which they took 2400 IU 
of vitamin D3 per day during the third trimester 
of pregnancy,12 a subgroup of 51 women partici-
pated in a trial in which they were vaccinated 
against influenza A during pregnancy,11,13 and a 
subgroup of 72 children with persistent wheeze 
participated in a trial in which they took azithro-
mycin or placebo during asthmatic episodes.14
The participating women completed a vali-
dated 360-item food frequency questionnaire so 
that their dietary intake in the 4 weeks before 
randomization could be assessed.15-17 Maternal 
whole-blood levels of EPA and DHA were assessed 
at the time of randomization and 1 week after 
birth.18,19 Samples of breast milk were obtained 
1 month after birth and were analyzed for EPA 
and DHA levels. Maternal variation in the genes 
encoding fatty acid desaturase (FADS) was tagged 
by genotyping the single-nucleotide polymor-

phism (SNP) rs1535 in mothers of European de-
scent (with genotyping performed by LGC Group). 
Adherence to the intervention was assessed by 
comparing the number of capsules returned 
with the number expected.
End Points
Pediatricians collected information during clini-
cal visits scheduled at 1 week after birth, at 1, 3, 
6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after birth, and 
yearly thereafter. Additional visits for acute care 
were arranged whenever a child had symptoms 
related to the lungs, an allergy, or the skin. 
Asthma, allergy, and eczema were diagnosed and 
treated by COPSAC pediatricians in accordance 
with predefined algorithms.11
Diary cards were completed daily by parents 
from the birth of their child for the purpose of 
monitoring troublesome lung-related symptoms, 
including cough, wheeze, and dyspnea that se-
verely affected the well-being of the child,11 skin-
related symptoms, and symptoms related to in-
fections of the lower respiratory tract. The diary 
cards were reviewed by COPSAC pediatricians, 
and the data were checked after being entered 
into the database.
Persistent wheeze or asthma (the primary end 
point) was diagnosed on the basis of a previously 
described quantitative diagnostic algorithm20,21 
that included diary recordings of five episodes of 
troublesome lung symptoms within the preced-
ing 6 months, each lasting for at least 3 consecu-
tive days; symptoms typical of asthma; the rescue 
use of inhaled beta2-agonist; and response to a 
3-month course of inhaled glucocorticoids fol-
lowed by relapse after the end of treatment.20 
Remission was defined as a period of 12 months 
without relapse. The diagnosis was termed “per-
sistent wheeze” until a child reached 3 years of 
age and was termed “asthma” thereafter.
Infection of the lower respiratory tract was 
defined as a diagnosis of pneumonia or bronchi-
olitis on the basis of symptoms and clinical pre-
sentation (i.e., without confirmation by means 
of pathogen identification or radiologic or labo-
ratory findings).22-24 Allergic sensitization was 
determined at 6 months and 18 months as a 
wheal larger than 2 mm in response to any skin-
prick test (ALK-Abelló) or a specific IgE level of 
0.35 kU per liter or higher against milk, egg, dog, 
or cat allergens (ImmunoCAP tests, Thermo 
Fisher Scientific).11 Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis 
was diagnosed longitudinally by COPSAC pedia-
tricians on the basis of systematic interviews and 
was defined as allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunc-
tivitis, or both. Lung function at 5 years of age 
was assessed by means of spirometry, specific 
airway resistance by means of whole-body plethys-
mography, and the lung-clearance index by means 
of multiple-breath washout.11 A diagnosis of ec-
zema was based on the criteria defined by 
Hanifin and Rajka.25-27
Statistical Analysis
Power calculations were based on the 695 new-
borns included in the trial. With an assumed 
hazard ratio of 0.5 for the treatment group and 
an expected frequency of persistent wheeze or 
asthma of 12% for the control group, the design 
had a power of 73% for the detection of a differ-
ence, with a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided 
test). The effect on the development of persistent 
wheeze or asthma and eczema was assessed by 
means of Kaplan–Meier curves and quantified by 
means of Cox proportional hazards regression 
(P values correspond to Wald tests). Post hoc 
analyses were performed with the use of Bayes-
ian statistical modeling to evaluate the impor-
tance of covariates and to quantify the degree of 
certainty for estimates of hazard ratios and risks, 
and multiple imputation was used to avoid issues 
related to missing data in these specific analy-
ses. Additional methodologic details are out-
lined in the Supplementary Appendix and in the 
COPSAC2010 design paper.11
Results
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 736 pregnant women were randomly 
assigned to receive the intervention or placebo 
between November 2008 and November 2010, 
and the final study included 695 children, includ-
ing five pairs of twins (Fig. S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The baseline characteristics of the 
pregnant women and their children showed that 
randomization was not biased; similarly, there 
were no significant differences in pregnancy 
end points, including the rate of preterm birth 
(P>0.1 for all comparisons) (Table S2 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Information on mater-
nal dietary intake before the intervention was 
available for 594 mothers (Table S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). The intake and blood 
levels of EPA and DHA were associated (r 
= 
0.32, 
P<0.001).

LCPUFA in Pregnancy and Asthma in Offspring
FADS Genotypes
The maternal FADS genotype (rs1535) was identi-
fied in 660 mothers. Post hoc analyses showed 
that the minor allele (G) was associated with 
lower levels of EPA and DHA before the interven-
tion and with higher levels of the upstream sub-
strates of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid 
before the intervention28 (Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Adherence
According to capsule count, 493 of 695 (70.9%) 
of the women had an intervention compliance of 
more than 80%, with no significant differences 
between the treatment and control groups. Sup-
plementation resulted in increased blood levels 
of EPA and DHA (mean [±SD] relative percent of 
fatty acids measured in blood) from 4.9±1.3% to 
6.1±2.0% as compared with a decrease from

4.9±1.2% to 3.7±1.1% in the control group (Fig. 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The between-
group difference in mean postintervention levels 
of EPA and DHA was 2.5 percentage points (95% 
CI, 2.2 to 2.7). Clinical follow-up for the initial 
3-year double-blind period was completed for 
664 children (95.5%), whereas clinical follow-up 
for the 5-year follow-up period was completed for 
647 children (93.1%). The average age of the chil-
dren for whom double-blind follow-up was com-
pleted was 4.0±0.6 years (Table 1, and Fig. S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix), and the average 
age of the children at the time of statistical 
analysis in March 2016 was 6.0±0.6 years.
Primary End Point
During the prespecified, double-blind follow-up 
period, which covered children from birth to be-
tween 3 and 5 years of age, 136 of 695 children 
(19.6%) received a diagnosis of persistent wheeze 
or asthma, and this condition was associated 
with reduced lung function by 5 years of age, 
with parental asthma, and with a genetic risk of 
asthma (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The risk of persistent wheeze or asthma 
was 16.9% in the treatment group and 23.7% in 
the control group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.035), with 
a relative reduction in risk of 30.7% (Table 1). 
The effect estimate and significance level re-
mained largely unchanged in adjusted analyses 
(i.e., with adjustment for twin status, sex, supple-
mentation with a high dose of vitamin D3, and 
EPA and DHA level before randomization) (Table 
S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The preventive effect of supplementation ap-
peared to be driven primarily by children of 
mothers who had low blood levels of EPA and 
DHA at randomization (the lowest third of the 
trial population), for whom the risk of persistent 
wheeze or asthma was 17.5% in the treatment 
group as compared with 34.1% in the control 
group (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.83; 
P 
= 
0.011), corresponding to a relative reduction 
of 54.1% (Table 1).
There was no statistically significant interac-
tion between supplementation with n−3 LCPUFA 
and high-dose vitamin D3 with regard to persis-
tent wheeze (P 
= 
0.065). However, exploratory 
analyses stratified according to randomization 
to receive high-dose vitamin D3 suggested that 
the strongest effect of n−3 LCPUFA supplemen-
tation occurred in children of mothers who did 
not receive high-dose vitamin D3 supplementa-
tion (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The number needed to treat to prevent a case 
of persistent wheeze or asthma was 14.6 among 
the entire cohort and 5.6 among women in the 
lowest third with regard to EPA and DHA levels 
before the intervention. The safety profiles for 
n−3 LCPUFA supplementation and olive oil ap-
peared to be similar (Table S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
During the continued follow-up period for 
children from birth to the age of 5 years, there 
was a reduced risk of persistent wheeze or asthma 
among the children in the treatment group as 
compared with the control group (Table 1 and 
Fig. 1 and 2). A similar difference in risk be-
tween groups was also found when statistical 
analyses were conducted in March 2016 that 
covered the period from birth to the ages of 5 to 
7 years (mean age, 6.0 years) (Table 1).
In a post hoc analysis, the effect of supple-
mentation seemed strongest in the children of 
mothers whose dietary intake of EPA and DHA 
was in the lowest third of that in the trial popu-
lation (<321 mg per day) before the intervention 
and in the children of mothers who carried the

FADS gene variant associated with low levels of 
EPA and DHA (the G allele at rs1535) (Table 1, 
and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
interaction between the intake of EPA and DHA 
and the FADS genotype on the effect of treatment 
is illustrated in Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
The yearly prevalence of persistent wheeze or 
asthma was lower among the children of moth-
ers who received supplementation, and this effect 
did not appear to change between the ages of 
2 and 5 years (Table 1 and Fig. 3). A threshold 
analysis suggested that supplementation was ef-
fective up to a preintervention blood level of EPA 
and DHA of approximately 5.0 to 5.5% of total 
blood fatty acids (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In the children of mothers in the con-
trol group, there was a significant association 
between low maternal blood levels of EPA and 
DHA and the risk of persistent wheeze or asth-
ma in their children (Table S8 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). There was no association between 
levels of EPA and DHA in breast milk collected 
when the child was 1 month old and later devel-
opment of persistent wheeze or asthma (Table S9 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Bayesian analy-
ses confirmed the effect of the intervention with 
similar estimates for hazard ratios and for abso-
lute and relative risks (see Supplementary Meth-
ods and Results and Tables S10 through 13 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary and Post Hoc End Points
Supplementation was associated with a reduced 
risk of lower respiratory tract infections in the 
first 3 years of life and up to 5 years of follow-up 
(Table 2, and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix) but not with other secondary end points, 
including the risk of asthma exacerbations, ecze-

The effect of n−3 LCPUFA supplementation in preg-
nancy is shown in children born to women who were  
in thelowest third of the study population regarding 
blood levels of EPA and DHA (Panel A, <4.30%), the 
middle third (Panel B, 4.30 to 5.33%), and the highest 
third (Panel C, >5.33%). Blood levels of EPA and DHA 
were measured in women on the day of randomization, 
at week 24 of pregnancy.

ma, and allergic sensitization at 6 months and 
18 months. There was also no statistically signifi-
cant association between supplementation and 
the post hoc end points of allergic rhinoconjunc-
tivitis and lung function at the age of 5 years.
Discussion
The risk of persistent wheeze or asthma was 
reduced by approximately 7 percentage points, 
or one third, in the first 5 years of life among 
children of women who received daily supplemen-
tation with n−3 LCPUFA during the third trimes-
ter of pregnancy. This effect was most prominent 
among children of women with low preinterven-
tion EPA and DHA blood levels. Supplementation 
was also associated with a reduced risk of infec-
tions of the lower respiratory tract but not with 
a reduced risk of eczema, allergic sensitization, 
or other secondary end points.
The trial results are strengthened by the use 
of centralized, longitudinal clinical follow-up, the 
daily recording of symptoms in a diary, and fre-
quent visits to our clinical research unit for regu-
lar and acute care. COPSAC served as the de facto 
primary health care center for the birth cohort, 
thereby ensuring the use of a standardized ap-
proach to diagnosis and treatment. This approach 
greatly improves the reliability of the diagnoses. 
The additional Bayesian analyses confirmed the 
results of the predefined analyses, thereby sup-
porting the robustness of the results.
We used a high dose of n−3 LCPUFA — corre-
sponding to an increase estimated to be 10 times 
the normal daily intake in Denmark29 and 20 times 
that in most other countries, including Canada 
and the United States.30,31 It is possible that a 
lower dose would have sufficed.
The FADS region harbors several genetic vari-
ants. The SNP rs1535 was chosen because this SNP 
and its proxies in close linkage disequilibrium 
have been associated with n−3 LCPUFA levels in a 
genomewide association study32 and with blood 
levels of EPA and DHA during pregnancy.28
Several secondary and subgroup analyses were 
performed. These analyses should be considered 
as exploratory; the results need to be confirmed 
in subsequent studies. Furthermore, it is a limita-
tion of our study that allergic rhinoconjunctivitis 
was not confirmed in tests of allergic sensitiza-
tion by the age of 5 years.
We observed that supplementation had a great-
er effect on the children of mothers with low 
blood levels and low intake of EPA and DHA and 
on the children of mothers with a FADS genotype 
associated with low EPA and DHA blood levels. 
This pattern is biologically plausible and sup-
ports the supposition that the intervention had a 
causal effect. Furthermore, this pattern indicates 
that there is the potential for so-called “precision 
prevention” by targeting pregnant women with 
the FADS genotype associated with low levels of 
EPA and DHA and those with a low dietary in-
take of these fatty acids (Fig. S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
The differences in the geographical and tem-
poral incidences of asthma and wheezing indi-
cate that lifestyle plays a major role, and our trial 
suggests that diets low in n−3 LCPUFA could 
contribute to these differences. The mechanisms 
may involve an imbalance between n−6 and n−3 
lipid mediators, which may promote a proinflam-
matory state.33,34
There was no statistically significant interac-
tion related to concurrent supplementation with 
vitamin D3 and n−3 LCPUFA, but there was a 
trend suggesting that n−3 LCPUFA supplementa-
tion was less effective in children receiving high-
dose vitamin D3. Such an interaction would indi-
cate that these supplements target the same

disease pathway, and this possibility should be 
addressed in future studies.
Analysis of the prevalence of current persistent 
wheeze or symptoms of asthma showed that the 
effect of the intervention was largely unchanged 
between the ages of 2 years and 5 years (Fig. 3). 
This finding suggests that the effect is not re-
stricted to a “transient wheezing” phenotype.
The maternal baseline intake of n−3 LCPUFA 
was high in this Danish population relative to 
that of the global population (Table S14 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). It has been estimated 
that 80% of the global population consumes less 
than 250 mg of EPA and DHA per day,35 — a 
level that is well below 321 mg per day, the level 
below which we observed the highest treatment 
effect in our trial. Our data therefore suggest 
that a sizeable effect may be expected from sup-
plementation in other populations worldwide; 
however, this suggestion is speculative, since 
other factors may be at play in such populations.
The implications of our findings on health 
and disease may be wide. The number needed

or asthma was 14.6 in the entire cohort and 5.6 
among women with the lowest blood levels of 
EPA and DHA before intervention.
In conclusion, these findings show that n−3 
LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy was 
associated with a significantly diminished bur-
den of wheezing and asthma in children in this 
Danish birth cohort. To address the question of 
whether similar effects could be seen in other 
populations, further studies are required.
