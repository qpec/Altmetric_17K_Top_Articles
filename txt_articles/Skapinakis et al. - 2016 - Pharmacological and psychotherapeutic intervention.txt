Summary
Background Several interventions are available for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults, but few 
studies have compared their relative effi
  cacy in a single analysis. We aimed to simultaneously compare all available 
treatments using both direct and indirect data.
Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched the two controlled trials registers 
maintained by the Cochrane Collaboration Common Mental Disorders group for trials published up to Feb 16, 2016. 
We selected randomised controlled trials in which an active psychotherapeutic or pharmacological intervention had 
been used in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder. We allowed all comorbidities except for schizophrenia or 
bipolar disorder. We excluded studies that focused exclusively on treatment-resistant patient populations defi
 ned 
within the same study. We extracted data from published reports. The primary outcome was symptom severity as 
measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. We report mean diff
 erences with 95% credible intervals 
compared with placebo. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002441.
Findings We identifi
 ed 1480 articles in our search and included 53 articles (54 trials; 6652 participants) in the network 
meta-analysis. Behavioural therapy (mean diff
 erence –14·48 [95% credible interval –18·61 to –10·23]; 11 trials and 
287 patients), cognitive therapy (–13·36 [–18·40 to –8·21]; six trials and 172 patients), behavioural therapy and 
clomipramine (–12·97 [–19·18 to –6·74]; one trial and 31 patients), cognitive behavioural therapy and fl
 uvoxamine 
(–7·50 [–13·89 to –1·17]; one trial and six patients), cognitive behavioural therapy (–5·37 [–9·10 to –1·63]; nine trials 
and 231 patients), clomipramine (–4·72 [–6·85 to –2·60]; 13 trials and 831 patients), and all SSRIs (class eff
 ect –3·49 
[95% credible interval –5·12 to –1·81]; 37 trials and 3158 patients) had greater eff
 ects than did drug placebo. 
Clomipramine was not better than were SSRIs (–1·23 [–3·41 to 0·94]). Psychotherapeutic interventions had a greater 
eff
 ect than did medications, but a serious limitation was that most psychotherapeutic trials included patients who 
were taking stable doses of antidepressants (12 [80%] of the 15 psychotherapy trials explicitly allowed antidepressants).
Interpretation A range of interventions is eff
 ective in the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but 
considerable uncertainty and limitations exist regarding their relative effi
  cacy. Taking all the evidence into account, 
the combination of psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions is likely to be more eff
 ective than are 
psychotherapeutic interventions alone, at least in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Introduction
Obsessive compulsive disorder is considered the fourth 
most common mental disorder in high-income countries 
and ranks as the tenth leading cause of disability 
worldwide.1,2 It is associated with increased mortality3 and 
can have a substantial impact on quality of life for both 
patients and family members or carers.2 Clomipramine 
and the SSRIs are currently recommended for pharma-
cological management of the disease.4 Psychotherapies 
and especially behavioural or cognitive behavioural inter-
ventions 
have 
been 
developed5,6 
and 
are 
also 
recommended.7
Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have 
generally compared the effi
  cacy of pharmacological 
interventions with placebo, not with each other.8–10 
Psychotherapeutic interventions have typically been 
compared with a waiting list or other inactive therapy.7,11 
Only a few studies have directly compared psycho-
therapeutic with pharmacological interventions or comb-
inations of them, and their results are inconclusive.7 In 
the absence of available head-to-head comparisons, 
indirect evidence can be used to enhance the existing 
evidence base. Indirect comparisons between diff
 erent 
medications have been done in the past, but statistical 
methods appropriate for such comparisons were poorly 
developed at that time.10 Network meta-analysis is a 
method of synthesising information from a network of 
trials addressing the same question, but involving

diff
 erent interventions. It aims to combine direct and 
indirect evidence into a single eff
 ect size and rank all 
available treatments in terms of effi
  cacy, providing 
estimates for interventions even if they have not 
been directly compared. This approach has been 
applied success 
fully to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, 
depression, and certain anxiety disorders (social phobia 
and generalised anxiety disorder), but not obsessive-
compulsive disorder. We therefore did a systematic review 
and network meta-analysis with the aim to simultaneously 
compare all available treatments using both direct and 
indirect data.12 A more detailed report than this one will 
be published, and data collected for children and 
adolescents will also be separately published.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we 
searched the two controlled trials registers maintained 
by the Cochrane Collaboration Common Mental 
Disorders group for trials published up to Feb 16, 2016, 
by experienced staff
  of the Cochrane Common Mental 
Disorders group using their standard methodology. 
Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group’s registers 
are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of 
MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO; quarterly searches 
of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; 
and review-specifi
 c searches of additional databases. 
We searched the registers using the generic term 
“condition = obsess* OR compulsi*”, with no language 
restrictions. We included studies in the review if they 
were randomised controlled trials of adult patients 
with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. We 
allowed all comorbidities except for schizophrenia or 
bipolar disorder. We excluded studies that focused 
exclusively on treatment-resistant patient populations 
defi
 ned within the same study.
Eligible experimental interventions were all anti-
depressants7 and psychotherapeutic interventions7 recom-
mended by current guidelines—ie, behavioural therapy, 
including exposure and response prevention but not 
explicit 
cognitive 
techniques 
(such 
as 
cognitive 
restructuring); cognitive therapy, including cognitive 
restructuring but not explicit behavioural techniques; and 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). In psycho 
therapy 
trials that used both an individual and group format, we 
extracted data only for groups with the individual format. 
Eligible control interventions were drug placebo, 
psychological placebo (any credible psychological inter-
vention that includes only non-specifi
 c components of 
therapy, such as general stress manage 
ment or relaxation), 
and any other non-specifi
 c psycho 
therapeutic relationship. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were independently 
assessed by two reviewers (HB and PSk) and validated by 
one reviewer (PSk). For studies that were excluded, we 
noted the main reason for exclusion. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
During the protocol stage of our project (May 1 to June 30, 2013), 
we did a scoping search of the literature. We used the two 
specialised registers of controlled trials maintained and 
administered by the Cochrane Collaboration Common Mental 
Disorders Group. We searched the registers using the generic 
term “condition = obsess* OR compulsi*”, with no language or 
date restrictions. We found that the latest comprehensive 
review had been published in 2006 and specifi
 c meta-analyses 
had been published in 2008. Since then, several new trials have 
been done. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
have generally focused on the comparison between 
antidepressant medications and placebo or psychotherapeutic 
interventions and a waiting list. Few studies have directly 
compared the relative effi
  cacy of serotonergic antidepressants 
versus each other, behavioural-type psychotherapies versus 
each other, or medications versus psychotherapies. Clinicians 
are often interested in pragmatic comparisons (Are all SSRIs 
equally eff
 ective? Is clomipramine more eff
 ective than are 
SSRIs? Is cognitive behavioural psychotherapy more eff
 ective 
than are medications?), but these questions have been 
examined in few studies in the past using statistical methods 
that have not always taken into account the complexity of such 
comparisons. We therefore did a network meta-analysis with 
the aim to simultaneously compare in a single analysis and 
rank in terms of effi
  cacy all available interventions for 
management of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults.
Added value of this study
We found small diff
 erences in effi
  cacy between medications, 
and the hypothesis of clomipramine being better than SSRIs 
was not confi
 rmed. Although certain psychotherapies were 
associated with larger eff
 ects than were medications, we 
underline an important limitation that, in most 
psychotherapeutic trials, patients who were taking stable 
doses of antidepressants were not excluded and therefore 
these therapies cannot be considered as pure monotherapies.
Implications of all the available evidence
Taking all evidence into account, the combination of 
psychotherapies with medications is possibly the most 
eff
 ective intervention and clinicians should consider this 
option more often than at present for patients with severe 
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychotherapy is eff
 ective in 
symptomatic patients taking antidepressant medications, and 
its eff
 ect as monotherapy is not known. Future research 
should try to diff
 erentiate more clearly the eff
 ect of 
medications versus psychotherapy and monotherapy versus 
combined therapy, avoiding the limitations that we have 
underlined in this study.

Data analysis
Data extraction was done independently by two reviewers 
(HB and PSk) and validated by one reviewer (PSk). 
We used standardised data extraction Word forms and 
structured Excel spreadsheets to extract data from 
published reports. In cases of duplicate data, we selected 
the manuscript with the largest sample. We also 
considered preliminary congress abstracts duplicate and 
did not select them if a full article had been published 
after the congress. We extracted data for inclusion 
and exclusion criteria (study design, experimental 
intervention, control intervention, age range, primary 
diagnosis, comorbid diagnoses, and use of diagnostic 
criteria), general details of the study (country, treatment 
setting, and length of follow-up), details of continuous 
outcome assessment (number of patients eligible for 
randomisation, randomised, dropped out, and remaining 
at the end of study, and baseline, end of treatment, and 
change from baseline Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive 
Scale [YBOCS] scores, with SDs), and details of the risk 
of bias assessment (intention-to-treat analysis, use of 
methods for handling missing data, and dropouts).
For the quantitative synthesis, the primary outcome 
measure was continuous and it was symptom severity as 
measured by YBOCS.13 Our preferred measure was 
mean change from baseline score. For studies in which 
this measure was not reported, we used mean YBOCS 
scores at the end of study after checking that YBOCS at 
baseline was balanced across groups. We report mean 
diff
 erences with 95% credible intervals compared with 
placebo. We assessed risk of bias using the criteria 
suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.14 
We included studies with a high risk of bias in the main 
analysis but did sensitivity analyses to examine the eff
 ect 
of excluding them.
We did pairwise and network meta-analyses for 
effi
  cacy. We excluded studies that did not use YBOCS. 
This post-hoc decision was made for two reasons: 
YBOCS is the only available clinician-rated scale that has 
been extensively validated in controlled trials worldwide13 
and use of a single scale allowed us to use the mean 
diff
 erence instead of the standardised mean diff
 erence, 
avoiding the metho 
dological and interpretational diffi
  -
culties associated with use of standardised mean 
diff
 erence.14 Where possible, we derived missing SDs 
from reported statistics following guidance in the 
Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.14 Where possible, we 
analysed the intention-to-treat population; otherwise, we 
used reported results for participants who completed 
the study. 
We did all analyses in a Bayesian framework using 
OpenBUGS version 3.2.3. We used the random-eff
 ect 
models described by Dias and colleagues,15 modifi
 ed to 
incorporate an additional class hierarchy,16 such that all 
SSRIs were assumed to be similar, with a common 
class mean eff
 ect and between-SSRI variability about 
this class mean. We used fl
 at priors for all parameters. 
We assessed heterogeneity by examining the posterior 
median of the between-study heterogeneity parameter 
from the random-eff
 ects model. To assess variability 
within studies, we used what was reported by trial 
authors. For continuous measures SDs were reported 
and for ratio measures typically SEs. However, where 
these statistics were not reported, we used methods 
recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration Hand-
book14 (eg, estimation of SEs from CIs). We measured 
goodness of fi
 t with the posterior mean of the residual 
deviance. To assess inconsistency between direct and 
indirect evidence, we compared the fi
 t of a model 
assuming consistency with that of one that relaxes this 
assumption (unrelated mean-eff
 ects model).17 We also 
compared the results of the pairwise meta-analysis with 
those of the network meta-analysis. All OpenBUGS 
code is available in the appendix.

overall attrition or evidence of diff
 erential attrition 
between groups. We present the results both before 
(ie, the full dataset) and after excluding waiting list 
controlled trials. These trials are non-masked and evidence 
exists that they lead to biased results in favour of the active 
psychotherapeutic interventions.18–20 We did separate 
meta-regressions assuming a common interaction term 
for the following study-level charac 
teristics: length of trial, 
publication date, industry sponsorship, and inclusion of 
patients with current comorbid depression. This study is 
registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002441.

Results
We identifi
 ed 1480 articles in our search and assessed 
158 (11%) full-text articles for eligibility (fi
 gure 1). 
We excluded 95 (60%) articles and included 64 trials 
reported in 63 (40%) articles21–83 in the qualitative 
review. A detailed list of the excluded studies is in the 
appendix. From the 63 articles eligible for inclusion in 
the network meta-analysis, we excluded ten (16%): 
nine (14%)22,32,35,36,54,62,73,77,80 did not use YBOCS and 
one (2%)47 was not connected to the network (details of 
these studies in appendix), leaving 54 trials reported in 
53 (34%) articles21,23–31,33,34,37–46,48–53,55–61,63–72,74–76,78,79,81–83 included 
in the network meta-analysis (quantitative review). 
7302 patients were randomly allocated in the qualitative 
review; however, 7014 (96%) were randomly allocated 
in the network meta-anlysis, with 288 (4%) excluded. 
Only 
6652 
(91%) 
contributed 
to 
the 
network 
meta-analysis since some trials did not report outcomes 
for all participants.
The 64 trials included in the qualitative review were 
published over a period of 33 years (1980–2012; table 1; 
detailed charac 
teristics in appendix). In most psycho-
therapeutic trials, patients were not excluded if they were 
taking a stable dose of antidepressants for at least 3 months 
before inclusion (13 [72%] of all 18 psychotherapeutic trials 
and 12 [80%] of the 15 psychotherapeutic trials included 
in the network meta-analysis explicitly allowed anti-
depressants). In these trials, the proportion of patients on 
antidepressant medication varied, ranging from 13% to 
100% and, in more than two-thirds of studies with the 
information available, was 45% or higher (detailed des-
cription in appendix). Patients were not allowed to make 
dose adjustments during trials, but no specifi
 c information 
was provided on how this criterion had been monitored by 
authors. Participants had long-standing and severe 
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Demographic and clinical 
characteristics of participants were similar across 
comparisons.
The 54 trials included in the network meta-analysis 
(quantitative review) involved 17 diff
 erent treatments 
grouped into 12 classes (all six SSRIs were grouped into 
the same class; fi
 gure 2). Overall, of the 136 unique 
pairwise comparisons that could be made between the 
17 treatment conditions, only 37 (27%) were studied head 
to head in the included studies. A detailed table of the data 
used in the analysis is in the appendix. Six (11%) trials used 
a waiting list control group: fi
 ve (9%) CBT studies23,31,40,50,71 
including 157 patients, 80 (51%) of whom had been 
randomly allocated to CBT, and one (2%) behavioural

therapy study56 including 40 patients, 20 (50%) of whom 
had been randomly allocated to behavioural therapy. The 
behavioural therapy trial that used the waiting list as a 
control group56 was clearly an outlier in terms of effi
  cacy 
(mean YBOCS diff
 erence from waiting list at the end of 
study –30·87). The network meta-analysis model gave an 
adequate fi
 t to the data and we identifi
 ed no evidence of 
inconsistency (posterior mean of the residual deviance was 
104·6 in the network meta-analysis assuming consistency 
and 105·8 assuming inconsistency compared with 107 data 
points). Further 
more, the deviance information criterion 
was similar for the models with (480·8) and without 
(479·1) the consistency assumption. The posterior median 
SD for the consistency model was 3·10 (95% credible 
interval 2·46–3·95), whereas for the inconsistency model, 
this value was reduced to 1·75 (1·18–2·53). 
Most active interventions showed a signifi
 cant reduct-
ion in mean YBOCS compared with drug placebo, 
regardless of inclusion or exclusion of trials using waiting 
list controls (table 2). Venlafaxine and psycho 
logical 
placebo both showed reductions in mean YBOCS, but 
they were not signifi
 cant. The waiting list was the only 
so-called intervention that was associated with an increase 
in mean YBOCS compared with drug placebo. The eff
 ects 
of individual SSRIs were similar in magnitude. 
Clomipramine had a larger eff
 ect compared with placebo 
than did SSRIs, but the diff
 erence was not signifi
 cant 
(table 3). All three psychotherapeutic interventions 
(behavioural therapy, cognitive therapy, and CBT) showed 
greater effi
  cacy than did drug placebo. However, in the 
full analysis, CBT was less effi
  cacious than were the other 
two and was not diff
 erent from psychological placebo 
(appendix). Exclusion of studies that had used waiting list 
control groups led to a larger eff
 ect for CBT, which was 
signifi
 cantly diff
 erent from psychological placebo and 
similar to the other two psychotherapies.
In the full network, both behavioural and cognitive 
therapy had a larger reduction in mean YBOCS than did 
SSRIs as a class (table 3). CBT also had a lower mean 
YBOCS than SSRIs as a class, but only after excluding 
waiting list controlled trials. We observed similar results 
when com 
paring diff
 erent types of psychotherapies with 
clomi 
pramine as the reference (detailed results for all 
possible comparisons are shown in the appendix). How-
ever, in psychotherapeutic trials, most patients were 
taking stable doses of antidepressant medications for the 
whole duration of the trial. The same applies to the 
comparison between combinations of medications and 
psychotherapy versus psychotherapy alone as patients in 
these network comparisons were not in strict monotherapy 
(table 2, table 3). In all of these comparisons, diff
 erences 
were small. Excluding waiting list controlled trials, the 
combination of behavioural therapy with clomipramine 
was associated with the largest eff
 ect, but this com 
bination 
has been used in only a single trial.38
For all 64 trials included in the qualitative review, 
results of the risk of bias assessment for trials with at 
least one drug arm (46 [72%] of 64) and those with 
psychotherapy arms only (18 [28%] of 64) are presented 
in the appendix. Sequence generation (13 [20%] of 64) 
and random allocation concealment (eight [13%] of 64) 
were specifi
 cally described (ie, low risk of bias) in few 
studies. In trials with psychotherapy arms, masking of 
participants or those delivering the intervention was not 
possible (seven [39%] of these 18 trials used outcome 
assessors who were masked to treatment allocation). In 
the drug only trials, specifi
 cation of the double-blind 
method (eg, identical capsules) was described in 15 (39%) 
of 38 trials. Handling of in 
complete outcome data with 
an acceptable method was reported in 28 (61%) of the 
46 trials with at least one drug arm and six (33%) of the 
18 trials with psychotherapy arms only. A high proportion 
of the trials with drug arms were sponsored by 
pharmaceutical companies (table 1).
For the sensitivity analyses, we used the full network 
(detailed results given in the appendix). In the fi
 rst 
analysis, we included the 33 (61%) trials with low overall 
(<25%) and diff
 erential (<15%) attrition. This analysis led 
to a larger eff
 ect for CBT than in the full analysis,which 
was then very similar to the other two psychotherapies. 
In the second analysis, we included 34 (63%) trials that 
met the criterion of low risk of bias in the domain of 
incomplete outcome assessment, and the main fi
 nding 
was that clomipramine had a smaller eff
 ect than in the 
full analysis that was not diff
 erent from that of SSRIs.

In this analysis, we excluded all cognitive therapy trials as 
they had reported completers analyses. In the third 
analysis, we included the 17 (31%) trials that used a 
masked outcome assessor. Overall, results were similar 
to those of the full analysis, but the power was 
compromised because of the small sample size. We 
carried out separate meta-regressions to test the eff
 ect of 
length of trial, publication date, industry sponsorship, 
and inclusion of patients with current comorbid 
depression. The eff
 ects of these variables were small, and 
none were signifi
 cant (appendix).
Discussion
In this network meta-analysis, we found that several 
pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions 
can be considered more effi
  cacious than is drug placebo. 
We found that SSRIs are generally equally effi
  cacious, 
with no evidence to suggest that one drug is better than 
the others are. Their eff
 ect compared with placebo is 
statistically signifi
 cant, but the estimated mean diff
 erence 
is generally moderate. In the full analysis, clomipramine 
showed a trend for a larger eff
 ect than with SSRIs that 
was not statistically signifi
 cant. This fi
 nding contrasts 
with previous direct analyses, which postulated that 
clomipramine might be more effi
  cacious than are 
SSRIs.10 This comparison was sensitive to studies with 
incomplete outcome assessment: some old clomipramine 
trials reported completers analyses only, and exclusion of 
these trials led to a lower eff
 ect for clomipramine than 
that of not excluding them, which was indistinguishable 
from that of SSRIs.
An unexpected fi
 nding was that in our main analysis, 
CBT had a smaller eff
 ect than that of behavioural or 
cognitive therapy. However, after exclusion of waiting 
list controlled trials, all diff
 erences between psycho-
therapies were not signifi
 cant. The waiting list was the 
only so-called intervention that led to an increase in 
mean YBOCS score compared with drug placebo, and 
psychological placebo was very similar to drug placebo 
after exclusion of waiting list controlled trials. Research 
has also shown that trials using control groups with no 
or minimal contact with therapists usually lead to grossly 
overestimated eff
 ect sizes for active psycho 
therapeutic 
interventions.18,84,85 We obtained similar fi
 ndings in the 
sensitivity analysis after exclusion of trials with high 
overall attrition to those from the main analysis after 
exclusion of waiting list controlled trials—ie, no 
diff
 erence between psychotherapies. The evidence for 
cognitive therapy mostly comes from trials that had 
compared it with behavioural therapy, with most of them 
not reporting intention-to-treat analyses, and these trials 
might have overestimated the eff
 ect of cognitive (and 
behavioural) therapy. The behavioural therapy trial that 
used the waiting list as a control group56 was clearly an 
outlier in terms of effi
  cacy, and excluding it from the 
analysis reduced the eff
 ects for both behavioural and 
cognitive therapy, but not signifi
 cantly. CBT has more 
links with other inter 
ventions and a more extensive 
network of trials than do cognitive and behavioural 
therapy and has been compared directly with several 
drugs in the same trial.26,71,74,75 Taking all of this evidence 
into account, our analysis does not support the view that 
the three types of psychotherapy have diff
 erent eff
 ects in 
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Our analysis shows that all psychotherapies, either in the 
full dataset (for behavioural and cognitive therapy) or after 
exclusion of the waiting list controlled trials (for CBT), were 
more likely to lead to a larger eff
 ect than were medications. 
Some previous meta-analyses have reported similar results 
in favour of psychotherapy. For example, Cuijpers and 
colleagues86 
examined 
the 
diff
 erential 
eff
 ect 
of 
pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in major depression, 
dysthymia, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and reported a positive 
eff
 ect for psychotherapy compared with medications only 
for 
obsessive-compulsive 
disorder. 
One 
important 
limitation exists that, to our knowledge, has not been 
recognised before: most patients included in trials that 
used exclusively psychotherapeutic inter 
ventions were 
allowed 
to 
continue 
taking 
their 
anti 
depressant 
medications. Combination trials that had both psycho-
therapeutic and drug arms, or arms with both 
psychotherapy and drugs, explicitly excluded patients on 
antidepressant medications by design (and half of these 
trials were of CBT and half were of behavioural therapy). 
Therefore, psychotherapy trials have essentially compared 
diff
 erent psycho 
thera 
peutic interventions in patients taking 
stable doses of anti 
depressant medications. Some evidence 
exists from other trials that focused exclusively on treat-
ment-refractory patients that addition of CBT for patients 
with SSRI-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder is 
more effi
  cacious than is either psychological placebo87 or 
risperidone.88 In our analysis, although patients were 
symptomatic at study recruitment, what the eff
 ect would be 
if patients had been tapered off
  their anti 
depressant 
medication before randomi 
sation is unknown because 
such studies have not been done. This issue has also been 
reported in meta-analyses of bipolar depression in which 
randomly allocated patients are allowed to continue using 
their mood stabilisers or anxiolytic medications.89 In any 
case, generalisation of these results for psychotherapeutic 
inter 
ventions 
in 
patients 
not 
taking 
concurrent 
anti 
depressant medications is diffi
  cult. There 
fore, the 
question of what is better as monotherapy in obsessive-
compulsive disorder—medications or psychotherapy—
cannot be answered given the current evidence.
Our analysis has several limitations. Most studies were 
of short-term duration. As most of the studies that tested 
the effi
  cacy of psychotherapeutic interventions included 
patients who were taking stable doses of antidepressant 
medications, generalisation of these results to patients 
not on medications is not possible. We were unable to 
test diff
 erent doses of the same drug to investigate 
potential dose-response associations.90 Because of the 
scarce data, we could not treat alternative dosing schemes 
in pharmacological trials as diff
 erent nodes in the 
network. Several old studies only reported completers 
analyses, including all cognitive therapy studies, limiting 
the usefulness of the sensitivity analysis in this domain. 
We did not consider the relative effi
  cacy of the various 
interventions in diff
 erent symptom dimensions of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and generalisation of the 
results in subgroups of patients with specifi
 c symptoms, 
such as hoarding, should be made with caution.
The results of our analysis generally support current 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guidelines.7 For pharmacological management, the 
recommendation to use SSRIs rather than clomipramine 
as the fi
 rst-line agents is supported by our fi
 ndings since 
SSRIs have better tolerability than does clomipramine 
and we identifi
 ed no convincing evidence for clomi-
pramine being more effi
  cacious than are SSRIs. For 
non-pharmacological management, all three types of 
psychotherapy are probably more effi
  cacious than is 
non-specifi
 c therapy, but evidence is limited to patients 
taking stable doses of antidepressant medication before 
initiating psychotherapy. The combined initiation of both 
medication and psychotherapy (either behavioural ther-
apy or CBT) seemed an effi
  cacious treatment. In our 
analysis excluding waiting list controlled trials, this 
combined treatment was best, but with considerable 
uncertainty. Given that most psychotherapeutic trials can 
also be considered variants of combination trials (since 
most patients were taking stable doses of antidepressant 
medications), the combination of SSRIs or clomipramine 
with psychotherapy is likely to off
 er more benefi
 t to 
patients with severe illness than is mono 
therapy, but 
more research is needed than at present to support this 
hypothesis, including cost-eff
 ectiveness analyses.
Further research should try to diff
 erentiate more clearly 
than at present the eff
 ect of medications versus psycho-
therapy and monotherapy versus combined therapy. Trials 
that investigate the eff
 ect of psychotherapy should monitor 
use of antidepressants in included patients or recruit 
patients who are willing to taper off
  their antidepressant 
medication before entering randomisation. As obsessive-
compulsive dis 
order is a very heterogeneous condition, 
more pragmatic trials of longer duration than have been 
done so far are needed to test the effi
  cacy of existing 
interventions in patients encountered in daily clinical 
practice (including those with other comorbid conditions) 
and the augmenting eff
 ect of medications in addition to 
psychotherapy or vice versa in patients with treatment-
refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.
