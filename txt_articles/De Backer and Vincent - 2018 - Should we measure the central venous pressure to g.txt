pressure to guide fluid management? Ten
answers to 10 questions

Abstract
The central venous pressure (CVP) is the most frequently
used variable to guide fluid resuscitation in critically ill
patients, although its use has been challenged. In this
viewpoint, we use a question and answer format to
highlight the potential advantages and limitations of
using CVP measurements to guide fluid resuscitation.
Keywords: Central venous pressure, Hemodynamics,
Fluid responsiveness, Cardiac output
The central venous pressure (CVP) remains the most
frequently used variable to guide fluid resuscitation in
critically ill patients [1]. Use of the CVP has been challenged
in many studies, which have reported that other indices are
better than the CVP for predicting the response to intraven-
ous fluids [2, 3]. However, we would argue that rather than
simply banning the use of CVP because its predictive value
may be less than desired in some situations, it is more
useful to clearly understand the potential advantages and
limitations of CVP measurements in order to improve its
use. Moreover, the value of CVP measurements for guiding
fluid resuscitation may go well beyond their simple use
as a predictor of fluid responsiveness. In this viewpoint,
we discuss the pros and cons of CVP for guiding fluid
resuscitation (Table 1).
Question 1: Are the factors that influence CVP too
numerous to make it meaningful?
We agree that the CVP is influenced by many factors,
but this is also true for other variables such as blood
pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output—does that mean
we should not measure them? No, rather we need to

understand which factors influence these measurements
and how, in order to use them optimally.
CVP is an indicator of right ventricular and, to a lesser
extent, left ventricular preload. CVP also reflects the
limit to venous return and informs about right ventricular
function. As such, CVP measurements may be helpful to
guide fluid management. However, CVP is also affected by
thoracic, pericardial, and abdominal pressures, which makes
its interpretation more complicated. Indeed, although the
CVP measured in these conditions overestimates the trans-
mural CVP and may thus fail to reflect the true loading
conditions of the right ventricle, it does represent the limit
to venous return and the back pressure of all extrathoracic
organs. In particular, the risk of peripheral edema, ascites,
renal, and liver impairment is related to the absolute CVP
value [4, 5].
Question 2: Can a given CVP value determine
whether a patient is fluid responsive?
According to the Frank-Starling relationship, stroke volume
increases with CVP until a plateau is reached (Fig. 1). It
may thus sound attractive to try to reach a CVP value that
is close to the plateau. Unfortunately, this approach has
limited value, because there is wide inter-patient variability
in the slopes. Accordingly, it is very difficult to predict the
response to fluids based on a single CVP value. In a trial
investigating 150 fluid challenges performed in 96 septic
patients being treated with mechanical ventilation, Osman
et al. observed that baseline CVP was similar in responders
and nonresponders so that the predictive value of CVP was
low [6].
The classical statistical approach to evaluating the pre-
dictive value of a test is often limited as it considers the risk
of error independent of the clinical situation. Nevertheless,
it is less risky to administer fluids in a nonresponsive
patient with a low CVP than one with a high CVP since
the risk of edema formation is obviously lower.

 The presence of an “extreme” CVP value may be more
helpful to guide fluid administration than intermediate
values. In a recent systematic review by Eskesen et al.,
including 1148 patients from 51 studies that evaluated
the response to a fluid bolus and reported CVP, the
overall predictive value of CVP was poor [7]. However,
approximatively two thirds of the patients with a CVP
less than 8 mmHg but only one third of patients with
CVP values greater than 12 mmHg responded to fluids.
In another study [8] that included 556 patients (460 of
whom were from eight studies published by the authors
of the review, and interestingly three of these studies
were not included in the other systematic review [7]),
the authors used the gray zone approach to determine
CVP values between which no decisions on fluid respon-
siveness could be taken. A positive response to fluids was
observed when CVP values were less than 6 mmHg but
was unlikely when values were greater than 15 mmHg [8].
These data suggest that extreme CVP values can help
to guide the response to fluids whereas intermediate
values cannot (Fig. 1). It may thus be wise to refrain
from administering fluids when the CVP is markedly
elevated.
Question 3: Can changes in CVP during fluid
administration be used as an indication of the
response to fluids?
Yes and no! The increase in CVP does not reflect
changes in cardiac output! According to Guyton, venous
return is inversely related to the difference between
mean systemic pressure (Pms) and CVP, suggesting that
the higher the CVP, the lower the cardiac output. The
role of the heart in this context is to try to keep CVP as
low as possible to maintain the gradient between Pms
and CVP. The goal of fluid resuscitation is to increase
the gradient between Pms and CVP by increasing Pms,
not by increasing CVP itself. Analyzing data published
by Cecconi et al. [9] who measured cardiac output, CVP,
and Pms during fluid challenge in postoperative patients,

The predictive value of extreme CVP values
(CVP < 6–8 mmHg and CVP > 12–15 mmHg)
is satisfactory [7, 8]
The predictive value for fluid responsiveness is lower with
CVP than with dynamic indices
CVP as a safety value
During a fluid challenge, a given CVP value can
be used as a safety value
This safety value should be individually determined as
there is no predefined safe upper level of CVP
CVP as a target value
In circulatory failure, this population-based approach
may be used to ensure that the majority of the patients
achieve a satisfactory hemodynamic goal
In circulatory failure, a significant number of patients may
be submitted to excessive fluid administration whereas
other patients may require additional fluid administration
In patients without indices of hypoperfusion, this approach
is not recommended as it could lead to unnecessary fluid
administration [19]
Influence of mechanical

The CVP represents the back pressure of all
extrathoracic organs
The CVP may fail to reflect intravascular pressure during
mechanical ventilation
CVP can be used to
evaluate the response to fluids
An increase in CVP indicates an increase in preload
The increase in CVP indicates the increase in preload but
does not indicate the response to fluids; in fluid
responders the increase in CVP should be minimal (with a
large increase in cardiac output) while in nonresponders
the increase in CVP is larger
An absence of change in CVP during fluid
administration indicates that insufficient fluids were
administered to manipulate preload
Fig. 1 Frank-Starling relationship in individual patients. At low
central venous pressure (CVP) values, most patients respond to
fluids. At high CVP values, most patients do not respond to fluids.
Between the two dotted lines, the response to fluids cannot be
predicted from the CVP

 it becomes clear that Pms increased similarly in fluid
responders and nonresponders. In contrast, CVP increased
minimally in responders so that the gradient for venous
return and hence cardiac output increased. In the nonre-
sponders, CVP increased markedly so that the gradient
for venous return and thus cardiac output remained
unchanged. Hence, cardiac tolerance to volume loading
is a greater determinant than changes in Pms for deter-
mining the response to fluid challenge.
Accordingly, changes in CVP during fluid challenge
should be analyzed together with changes in cardiac output;
a large increase in CVP with minimal change in cardiac
output indicates poor tolerance to fluids, whereas minimal
change in CVP together with an increase in cardiac output
indicates fluid responsiveness (Fig. 2).
Considering changes in CVP without taking into account
changes in cardiac output can be very misleading as one
may erroneously consider that the greater the change in
CVP the larger the increase in preload and thus potentially
the greater the effect of fluids. However, the opposite effect
may be true, i.e., cardiac tolerance may be poor and the
increase in cardiac output may have been minimal.
Without cardiac output measurements, the only conclusion
that can be drawn from the increase in CVP is that preload
effectively increased during fluid administration, but the
patient’s response to fluids is unknown.
Changes in CVP during a fluid bolus can be used to
predict the response to further fluid administration. In
80 surgical patients, Hahn et al. observed in nonresponders
that fluid response to a second fluid challenge was more
likely when changes in CVP during the first fluid adminis-
tration were minimal (the odds ratio for later becoming a
fluid responder was only 0.11 (95% confidence interval,
0.03–0.38) if CVP increased, compared to when CVP did
not increase) [10].
Hence, if anything, changes in CVP should be minimal,
but accompanied by an increase in cardiac output; other-
wise it implies that preload was not affected.
Question 4: Can CVP be used as a safety variable?
One way to look at changes in CVP during a fluid chal-
lenge is to consider CVP as a safety variable. After all,
the decision to administer fluids is based on a benefit/
risk analysis; the benefits are related to an increase in
cardiac output, and the risks to an increase in hydrostatic
pressure increasing edema formation. CVP is an excellent
variable to estimate the risk associated with extrathoracic
organ congestion. Limiting CVP in liver surgery is associ-
ated with less risk of bleeding and better perioperative
outcomes [11]. Similarly, the incidence of acute kidney
injury is increased in patients with sepsis or with congestive
heart failure who have elevated CVP values [4, 12]. In
patients with sepsis, the risk of developing acute kidney
injury increased with the mean CVP values over the
first 12 h after admission [4]. In patients with congestive
heart failure, those in the two upper quartiles of CVP had
more severe renal impairment compared to the other
quartiles, even though cardiac output was similar in the
four quartiles [12]. These data strongly demonstrate an
association between an elevated CVP and an increased
risk of developing acute kidney injury, but they do not
demonstrate a causal link.
Importantly, the CVP may fail to reflect the risk of
developing pulmonary edema, which depends on capillary
pressure and hence on left atrial pressure. In these condi-
tions, measurements of pulmonary artery occluded pressure
may be preferred as safety variables for the lungs, and/or
measurements of extravascular lung water to estimate the
severity of lung edema.
Question 5: Is there a safe CVP value?
This is a difficult question, as no clear cut-off value can
be identified. As mentioned earlier, an elevated CVP
may perhaps be more a marker of severity of cardiovascu-
lar and/or respiratory function than a factor contributing
to a poor outcome; thus, it would be illogical to prevent it
from reaching high values. In a study by Boyd et al. [13] in
patients with septic shock, a CVP less than 8 mmHg at
12 h was associated with improved survival, but it was no
longer associated with outcome at days 1–4. As different
Fig. 2 Relationship between preload, cardiac output, and central
venous pressure (CVP). Relationship between cardiac output and
preload (left panel) and between CVP and blood volume (right
panel) in a fluid responder (a) and a nonresponder (b). In the fluid
responder, the administration of fluids increases blood volume and
cardiac preload; the increase in preload is associated with a large
increase in cardiac output and a minimal increase in CVP. In the fluid
nonresponder, the same increase in blood volume and preload is
associated with no change in cardiac output and major changes in CVP.
Accordingly, an increase in CVP cannot be used to suggest a positive
response to fluids. Volume measurements better evaluate changes in
preload in preload-responsive patients while pressure measurements
better evaluate changes in preload in preload-nonresponsive patients

 cut-off values for CVP have been reported in different
studies, and as a given CVP value may or may not be asso-
ciated with a worse outcome, it seems logical to determine
the upper limit of CVP on an individual basis, weighing
the potential benefit/risk of further fluid administration
against the potential benefit/risk of alternative interven-
tions. This individually determined upper limit can be used
as a value at which further fluid administration should be
restricted. Nevertheless, one should try to keep CVP as low
as possible as long it remains associated with adequate
tissue perfusion.
Question 6: Should fluids be administered to
reach predefined CVP values?
This concept is the basis of some resuscitation algorithms
including that used by Rivers et al. [14] in their study on
early goal-directed therapy and the large subsequent trials
evaluating this strategy [14–17]. Of note, the same CVP
targets were used in the goal-directed and control arms so
that no conclusions can be made on the effectiveness of this
approach based on these trials. In the Protocolized Care for
Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial [15], CVP measurements
were not mandated in the usual care arm. No difference in
survival or organ dysfunction was reported between the
usual care arm and the two other arms, but it should be
noted that a central line was inserted in the majority of
patients in the usual care arm and we do not know whether
a CVP value was targeted in these patients.
Physiologically, it does not seem reasonable to target a
specific CVP value because the CVP value above which
a patient would not respond to fluids is highly variable.
As indicated earlier, each patient follows their own
Frank-Starling curve, and only extreme CVP values carry
some predictive value for fluid responsiveness. Hence,
targeting a specific CVP value is only valid at the popula-
tion level. Applying bootstrap analysis on data obtained
from 564 critically ill patients submitted to a fluid challenge,
Biais et al. [8] nicely demonstrated that the likelihood of
responding to fluid decreased progressively with increasing
CVP values and that almost no patient responded to fluids
when presenting CVP values greater than 20–22 mmHg.
Nevertheless, it would be dangerous to target such high
values of CVP as many patients would be exposed to the
detrimental effects of fluids while still being nonresponsive.
Target CVP values of 8–12 mmHg became almost “stand-
ard” after the study by Rivers et al., who determined them a
priori [14]. These values represent a reasonable target as
the majority of patients respond to fluids when CVP is less
than 8 mmHg and only a minority when it is greater than
12 mmHg [7, 8]. Nevertheless, using these values of CVP to
guide fluid administration is far from perfect and should
only be applied when more accurate predictors of fluid
responsiveness cannot be obtained.
In stabilized patients, it is clear that no attempt should
be made to increase CVP to specific target values. In
the FACT trial, patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) [18] were randomized after initial
resuscitation to liberal or conservative fluid therapy,
targeting higher or lower values of CVP (or pulmonary
artery occlusion pressure (PAOP)). There were no differ-
ences in survival between the groups, but patients in the
conservative strategy group were more rapidly weaned
from mechanical ventilation. In a recent exploratory
analysis of this trial, the risk of death was increased in the
liberal group compared to the conservative group when
basal CVP was between 0 and 10 mmHg but not at higher
values of CVP [19], suggesting a harmful effect of fluid
administration to target a given CVP value when this was
not needed.
Question 7: Are CVP measurements reliable
enough? Are there not too many technical
problems?
The reliability of CVP measurements has been questioned,
with errors related both to positioning of the zero level as
well as reading errors. Although these potential errors
should be acknowledged as a clear limitation, they are not
restricted to CVP measurements and, more importantly,
adequate training should limit the risk of such errors
occurring.
Question 8: Are measurements of end-diastolic
volumes not preferable (more physiologic) as
intraventricular volumes better reflect preload
than pressures?
Indeed, measurements of end-diastolic volume by transpul-
monary thermodilution or echocardiography reflect cardiac
preload better than do intravascular pressures, including
CVP. In healthy volunteers, changes in stroke volume
during fluid loading correlated better with changes in
cardiac volumes than with CVP [20]. Of note, volumes
better predict fluid responsiveness on the steep part of
the Starling relationship, whereas on the plateau pressures
indicate better that the patient has reached the limits of
filling (Fig. 3). In addition, measurements of intravascular
pressures are more physiologic in terms of the Starling
relationship of the vessels; indeed, edema formation
depends on intravascular pressures and not on volumes.
In fact, this question is actually a bit ‘passé’ as there is
no evidence that volumes are better than pressures for
fluid management in critically ill patients. The only excep-
tion is probably the abdominal compartmental syndrome,
in which CVP is markedly increased due to the increase in
intrathoracic pressure, while cardiac volumes are markedly
reduced.
De Backer and Vincent Critical Care  (2018) 22:43 
Page 4 of 6
 Question 9: Are dynamic indices of fluid
responsiveness better for guiding fluid
administration?
Dynamic indices of fluid responsiveness, such as pulse
pressure variation (PPV) or stroke volume variation
(SVV), or changes in cardiac output during a passive leg
raise, reflect that the heart is on the ascending part of
the Starling relationship. Given their excellent predictive
capacities for fluid responsiveness, these tests are now
included in recent guidelines [21, 22]. Unfortunately,
PPV or SVV can only be used reliably in a minority of
the patients, who are mechanically ventilated, sedated
and without arrhythmias. The passive leg raising test has
fewer limitations but is not as simple to perform as it
may seem at first glance and requires close monitoring
of stroke volume.
Although these tests may predict the increase in cardiac
output after fluid administration, they do not provide infor-
mation about the risks associated with fluid administration.
Indeed, a high CVP, whatever its cause, reflects a high risk
with fluid administration, with a high likelihood of further
increasing capillary leak and back pressure on extrathoracic
organs.
Question 10: Should we try to decrease CVP in
some conditions?
As elevated CVP levels may be associated with organ
dysfunction [4, 5], one should try to maintain CVP as
low as possible. This approach has been used in patients
with ARDS, leading to fewer days of mechanical ventilation
[18]. Importantly, this approach was applied only after
initial hemodynamic stabilization, after resolution of shock.
Accordingly, it may be reasonable to try to decrease CVP
in the stabilization and de-resuscitation phases [23] as long
as tissue perfusion is preserved.
Conclusions
CVP values provide important information about the
cardiocirculatory status of the patient and should not be
abandoned. Use of CVP to guide fluid resuscitation has
many limitations, but we believe it is wiser to under-
stand and take into account these limitations rather than
to discard CVP completely.
