BACKGROUND: Advancing structural and functional maturation of stem 
cell–derived cardiomyocytes remains a key challenge for applications in 
disease modeling, drug screening, and heart repair. Here, we sought to 
advance cardiomyocyte maturation in engineered human myocardium 
(EHM) toward an adult phenotype under defined conditions.
METHODS: We systematically investigated cell composition, matrix, and 
media conditions to generate EHM from embryonic and induced pluripotent 
stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts with organotypic 
functionality under serum-free conditions. We used morphological, 
functional, and transcriptome analyses to benchmark maturation of EHM.
RESULTS: EHM demonstrated important structural and functional 
properties of postnatal myocardium, including: (1) rod-shaped 
cardiomyocytes with M bands assembled as a functional syncytium; (2) 
systolic twitch forces at a similar level as observed in bona fide postnatal 
myocardium; (3) a positive force-frequency response; (4) inotropic 
responses to β-adrenergic stimulation mediated via canonical β1- and 
β2-adrenoceptor signaling pathways; and (5) evidence for advanced 
molecular maturation by transcriptome profiling. EHM responded to 
chronic catecholamine toxicity with contractile dysfunction, cardiomyocyte 
hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte death, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic 
peptide release; all are classical hallmarks of heart failure. In addition, 
we demonstrate the scalability of EHM according to anticipated clinical 
demands for cardiac repair.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide proof-of-concept for a universally applicable 
technology for the engineering of macroscale human myocardium for 
disease modeling and heart repair from embryonic and induced pluripotent 
stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes under defined, serum-free conditions.

T
he availability of human embryonic stem cells 
(ESCs)1 and human-induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs)2 and the scalability of their directed dif-
ferentiation into bona fide cardiomyocytes, as well,3–7 
have facilitated the rapid evolution of myocardial tissue 
engineering. Early tissue-engineering studies in chick 
embryo and rodent models have established electro-
mechanical stimulation as an important engineering 
paradigm,8–10 which has now been translated to human 
models.11–16 The accumulating evidence for advanced 
maturation in 3-dimensional versus monolayer cultures 
provides a solid rationale for applications in phenotyp-
ic screens11 and heart repair.17,18 As the use of myo-
cardial tissue engineering increases in academia and 
industry, it is essential to establish conditions readily 
adaptable to current good manufacturing practice. To 
achieve this goal, it is imperative to define the essen-
tial elements required for the structural and functional 
maturation of tissue-engineered myocardium under 
defined, serum-free conditions. Last, robust and re-
producible utility in ESC- and iPSC-based models is of 
pivotal importance.
In this study, we report a systematic approach for 
the design of engineered human myocardium (EHM) 
with structural and functional properties observed in 
the postnatal heart. Unbiased transcriptome profiling 
provided evidence for advanced maturation in EHM in 
comparison with parallel monolayer cultures. To dem-
onstrate the applicability of EHM for the modeling of 
“human heart failure in the dish,” we introduce a cat-
echolamine overstimulation protocol with outcomes 
similar to what is typically observed in clinical heart 
failure. Last, we provide proof-of-concept for the scal-
ability and in vivo applicability of defined EHM as an 
important step toward clinical translation of tissue-engi-
neered heart repair.
METHODS
Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Lines
We utilized: H9.219; HES3 (Embryonic Stem Cell International) 
including the transgenic derivative HES3-ENVY20; HES2 
(Embryonic Stem Cell International) including the trans-
genic derivative HES2-RFP21; H71 (WiCell); hiPS-G1 (gener-
ated in-house using Sendai Virus reprogramming, Cytotune 
Kit, Thermo Fisher); hiPS-BJ (Dr Toshiyuki Araki, New York), 
approved according to the German Stem Cell Act by the 
Robert-Koch-Institute to W.-H.Z.: permit #12; reference num-
ber: 1710-79-1-4-16.
Cardiomyocyte Differentiation and Purification
Differentiated embryoid bodies (H9.2, HES3, HES3-ENVY, 
HES2, hiPS-BJ) were shipped to Göttingen at room tempera-
ture and arrived within 72 to 96 hours. Cardiomyocytes from 
H7 (L. A. Couture, City of Hope) were shipped at –80°C. 
Frozen human cardiomyocytes were stored at –152°C. Most 
experiments were performed with HES2-RFP and hiPS-G1 
lines differentiated in monolayers according to Hudson et 
al22 with modifications. In brief, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) 
were plated at 5×104 to 1×105 cells/cm2 on 1:30 Matrigel in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)–coated plates and cultured 
in Knockout DMEM, 20% Knock-out Serum Replacement, 2 
mmol/L glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 U/mL 
penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (all Life Technologies) 
mixed 1:1 with irradiated human foreskin fibroblast (HFF)–
conditioned medium with 10 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor-2 
(FGF2) or TeSR-E8 (STEMCELL Technologies). After 1 day the 
cells were rinsed with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 
medium and then treated with RPMI, 2% B27, 200 µmol/L 
l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate 
(Sigma-Aldrich), 9 ng/mL Activin A (R&D Systems), 5 ng/mL 
BMP4 (R&D Systems), 1 µmol/L CHIR99021 (Stemgent), and 
5 ng/mL FGF-2 (Miltenyi Biotec) for 3 days. Following another 
wash with RPMI medium, cells were cultured from day 4 to 13 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Proof-of-concept for the engineering of scalable 
force-generating human myocardium from a variety 
of human pluripotent stem cells and biopsy-derived 
fibroblasts under defined, serum-free conditions.
• Evidence for morphological, molecular, and func-
tional maturation beyond the present state-of-the-
art is demonstrated (eg, positive force-frequency 
response, sarcomere assembly with robust M-band 
formation).
• Simulation of a human heart failure phenotype in the 
dish with (1) contractile dysfunction, (2) loss of a 
positive force-frequency response, (3) adrenergic 
signal desensitization, (4) cardiomyocyte hyper-
trophy, and (5) biomarker release (N-terminal pro 
B-type natriuretic peptide) by chronic catecholamine 
stimulation.
• Implantability of scalable engineered human myocar-
dium patches is demonstrated.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Robustness and readiness of defined, serum-free 
engineered human myocardium for applications in 
translational studies is demonstrated.
• Advanced morphological, molecular, and functional 
maturation, and organotypic responses to physi-
ological (positive force-frequency response) and 
pathological (norepinephrine-induced heart failure) 
stimuli, as well, are key for the utility of engineered 
human myocardium in heart failure modeling.
• Simulated heart failure in engineered human myo-
cardium may be exploited for the development of 
novel heart failure therapeutics.
• The reported defined, serum-free protocol will facili-
tate the engineering of human myocardium accord-
ing to current good manufacturing practice for 
applications in tissue-engineered heart repair.

RPMI without glucose and glutamine (Biological Industries), 
2.2 mmol/L sodium lactate (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 µmol/L

Supplement Table I for an overview of the different cardiac 
differentiation protocols3,17,19,22,24 used in this study.
EHM Generation 
An overview of the protocols to generate human EHM is dis-
played in Table. Details can be found in the online-only Data 
Supplement Material.
Analyses of Contractile Function
Contraction experiments were performed under isometric con-
ditions in organ baths at 37°C in gassed (5% CO2/95% O2) 
Tyrode solution (containing: 120 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.2 CaCl2, 
5.4 KCl, 22.6 NaHCO3, 4.2 NaH2PO4, 5.6 glucose, and 0.56 
ascorbate; all in mmol/L). Spontaneous beating frequency was 
determined at 2 mmol/L calcium after 10 minutes of equilibra-
tion of EHMs. EHMs were electrically stimulated at 1.5 to 2 Hz 
with 5 ms square pulses of 200 mA. EHMs were mechanically 
stretched at intervals of 125 µm until the maximum systolic 
force amplitude (force of contraction [FOC]) was observed 
according to the Frank-Starling law. Responses to increasing 
extracellular calcium (0.2–4 mmol/L), increasing stimulation 
frequencies (1, 2, 3 Hz), and adrenergic stimulation with iso-
prenaline (1 µmol/L) followed by functional antagonism by the 
muscarinergic agonist carbachol (10 µmol/L) at ≈EC50 calcium 
of individual EHMs were investigated. Where indicated, an 
isoprenaline concentration response curve was performed in 
the presence or absence of specific β1-adrenoceptor antago-
nist CGP-20712A (300 nmol/L, Sigma-Aldrich) or specific 
β2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551 (50 nmol/L, Sigma-
Aldrich). Postrest potentiation was assessed after 2 minutes of 
stimulation at 1.5 to 2 Hz and pauses of 10 s. The last stimu-
lated beat amplitude was compared with the first stimulated 
beat amplitude after the pause. Only EHMs without spontane-
ous contractions during the stimulation pause were included in 
the analysis.
EHM Heart Failure Model
l-Norepinephrine hydrochloride (NE) and endothelin-1 were 
prepared in distilled water containing 200 µmol/L l-ascorbic 
acid-2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate (all from 
Sigma-Aldrich). EHMs were treated with indicated concentra-
tions for 7 days. N-Terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide was 
measured by using the Elecsys kit (Roche Diagnostics).
EHM Dissociation
To isolate single cells, EHMs were incubated in collagenase 1 
solution (2 mg/mL in calcium-containing PBS in the presence 
of 20% fetal bovine serum) at 37°C for 60 to 90 minutes. 
EHM were washed with PBS (without calcium) and further 
incubated in Accutase (Millipore), 0.0125% Trypsin (Life 
Technologies), 20 µg/mL DNase (Calbiochem) for 30 minutes 
at room temperature. Cells were then mechanically separated 
and transferred into PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum for live 
cell flow cytometry. To preserve rod-shaped morphology of 
EHM-derived cardiomyocytes, 30 mmol/L 2,3-butanedione 
monoxime was added to the collagenase solution, and the 
final cell suspension was quickly transferred to 4% formalde-
hyde (Histofix, Roth). EHM-derived cells were spread out on 
glass slides (Superfrost plus, Menzel-Gläser) in distilled water 
and air dried.
Human Samples
Human fetal heart tissue (3 biopsies from a single donation) was 
obtained after elective abortion material (vacuum aspiration) 
without medical indication following informed consent. The col-
lection of fetal material was approved by the Ethical Committee 
of the Leiden University Medical Center (MEC-P08.087).

Human heart samples were collected from the left ventricles 
of nonfailing donor hearts (n=4 donor hearts) not suitable 
for transplantation as approved by the Ethical Committee of 
the University Medical Center Göttingen (31/9/00). Gingiva 
samples were obtained from otherwise healthy donors dur-
ing elective periodontal surgical treatment as approved by the 
Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Göttingen 
(16/6/09). Cardiac fibroblasts were purchased from Lonza. 
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki by the World Medical Association.
RNA Sequencing 
RNA was prepared using Trizol (Life Technologies) following 
the manufacturer’s instruction. RNA integrity was assessed 
with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Total RNA was subjected 
to library preparation (TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample 
Prep Kit from Illumina) and RNA-sequencing on an Illumina 
HighSeq-2000 platform (SR 50 bp; >25 Mio reads/sample). 
Sequence images were transformed with the Illumina software 
BaseCaller to bcl files, which were demultiplexed to fastq files 
with CASAVA (v1.8.2). Fastq files were mapped to GRCh38/
hg38 using STAR 2.4 or TopHat225 and reads per kilobase of 
transcript per million (RPKM) were calculated based on the 
Ensembl transcript length as extracted by biomaRt (v2.24). We 
only considered protein_coding transcripts for further analy-
sis. Gene ontology analysis was performed through DAVID.26 
To determine cardiomyocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes 
the following algorithm was applied: (1) counts (>10) of puri-
fied PSC-derived cardiomyocytes (HES2, iCELL, hiPS-G1; 
n=3 from each line) and fibroblasts from 3 different sources 
(heart, skin, gingiva; n=3 from each source) were pooled 
and the differentially expressed genes (P<0.05, corrected by 
Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple testing27) between car-
diomyocyte and fibroblast pools determined using edgeR28; (2) 
log2 changes of differentially expressed genes were calculated 
and genes omitted with a log2 difference lower than mean log2 
of all cardiomyocyte genes; (3) resulting cardiomyocyte- and 
fibroblast-enriched genes were screened for RPKM values in 
adult healthy heart and all genes with RPKM <1 in adult heart 
were omitted.
3D Printing of Flexible Holders for EHM Patches 
Flexible holders for the EHM patch construction were printed 
on a Connex350 (Stratasys) 3D printer using the biocompat-
ible MED610 polymer as stiff base and TangoBlack polymer 
for the flexible poles. Support material was sprayed off using 
a Balco Powerblast waterjet. Holders were incubated for 15 
minutes in isopropanol to dissolve traces of support mate-
rial, sprayed again, rinsed, and soaked in water for at least 5 
days to bleed out leftovers from the polymerization process. 
Holders were then sterilized by plasma cleaning for 30 s 
(Harrick Plasma).
Imaging of EHM Patch Function 
For each measurement, plates were recorded inside a 37°C cli-
mate chamber for at least 2 minutes at 50 frames per second 
resolution using a Basler acA2000 8 bit monochrome camera 
with a Kowa 35-mm lens from ≈45-cm distance. Back light was 
set to bleach background pixels and facilitate video analysis 
by a custom-made Matlab code. The region of interest was 
manually adjusted to patch size, nonbackground pixels were 
selected by an intensity cutoff, and the Matlab imdilate and 
imfill commands were used to close gaps and fill holes in the 
tissue leaving pixels belonging to patch and poles white (1) and 
everything else black (0). The number of white pixels repre-
sents the surface area sa at time t and was converted to frac-
tional area change (FAC) by division through the maximum sa 
of a contraction cycle. Contraction peaks, ie, the time points 
of maximal FAC, were identified automatically; FAC and beating 
frequency, determined from peak-to-peak intervals, were aver-
aged over 2 minutes.
Implantation of Human Patches
EHM patches were epicardially implanted into immunosup-
pressed athymic (nude) rats (Charles River) as described 
previously.17
Flow Cytometry and Immunofluorescence 
Staining
Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed after 
antibody labeling (online-only Data Supplement Table II) as 
described previously.29
Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as mean±standard error of the mean. 
Statistical differences between 2 groups were tested by 2-sided 
unpaired or paired Student t tests. In case of ≥3 groups, 1-way 
or 2-way unrepeated or repeated-measures ANOVA with appro-
priate post hoc testing was performed. The performed tests 
are specified in the respective figure legends. Statistical test-
ing was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.
Additional methods are described in the online-only Data 
Supplement Material.
RESULTS
Definition of Cell Composition in EHM
EHM formation comprises 2 macroscopically distin-
guishable phases (Figure 1A): (1) EHM consolidation in 
casting molds with an onset of spontaneous beating in 
variably sized areas within 24 hours, and (2) EHM matu-
ration with coordinated and rhythmic contractions of the 
whole tissue after 3 days and onward (online-only Data 
Supplement Movie I). In pilot experiments, we defined 
1.5×106 ESC (H9.2 and HES3)–derived cardiomyocytes 
suspended in 500-µL collagen type I/Matrigel hydrogels 
as the optimal condition for the construction of force-
generating EHM online-only Data Supplement Table I).
Using HES2 and hiPSC-BJ cardiac differentiation cul-
tures with different cardiomyocyte content, we found 
that EHM containing a cardiomyocyte:nonmyocyte 
composition of 1:1 at the time of force assessment 
developed maximal contractile forces (Figure 1B). This 
was in agreement with recent reports15 and our own 
experience in rodent models31 on the critical role of

nonmyocytes for the engineering of force-generating 
myocardium. We next formally tested the effect of the 
cardiomyocyte:nonmyocyte ratio by using metabolic se-
lection23 for cardiomyocyte purification (Figure 1C) and 
HFFs; EHM constructed directly from enriched cardio-
myocyte populations did not condense and contained 
mostly rounded cardiomyocytes (Figure 1D; online-only 
Data Supplement Movie II). The addition of HFFs at a 
70%/30% cardiomyocyte/fibroblast input ratio was opti-
mal for the construction of force-generating EHM loops 
with a cardiomyocyte:fibroblast output ratio of ≈1:1 (Fig-
ure 1E), confirming our initial findings (Figure 1B).
By defining the nonmyocyte input, we observed ad-
vanced cardiomyocyte maturation with reduced variabil-
ity in the functional maturation of EHM (online-only Data 
Supplement Figure IA) and a higher mean actinin fluo-
rescence intensity per cell, indicating higher sarcomeric 
protein content per individual cardiomyocyte (online-only 
Data Supplement Figure IB). Furthermore, the classical 
inotropic and lusitropic (relaxation) responses to isopren-
aline were enhanced in defined EHM (online-only Data 
Supplement Figure IC). The number of immature ven-
tricular cardiomyocytes (defined by simultaneous expres-
sion of MLC2A and MLC2V) was greatly reduced by EHM 
culture with more pronounced ventricular maturation in 
defined EHM (online-only Data Supplement Figure ID and 
IE). Defining the nonmyocyte population in EHM not only 
reduced intraline (online-only Data Supplement Figure IA), 
but also interline variability (online-only Data Supplement 
Figure IF). Moreover, expression of pluripotency-associ-
ated genes and cell cycle activity in cardiomyocytes and 
nonmyocytes were markedly reduced in defined EHM 
(online-only Data Supplement Figure II). Taken together, 
we conclude that defining the nonmyocyte cell fraction 
increases the robustness of the EHM protocol also with 
respect to its organotypic contractile function and ven-
tricular fate.
Development of a Defined, Serum-Free EHM 
Construction Protocol Toward Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice
The EHM Starting Protocol, which was devised from our 
original rodent tissue engineering protocol,29 included a 
variety of undefined matrix (Matrigel) and serum (horse 
serum, fetal calf serum, chick embryo extract) compo-
nents (Table). We first defined the matrix components 
and observed that EHM could be constructed from 
medical-grade bovine collagen without Matrigel (Matrix 
Protocol), without any reduction in functionality online-
only Data Supplement Figure IIIA and IIIB). The addition 
of laminin (5 µg/EHM) or fibronectin (5 µg/EHM) to the 
Matrix Protocol did not further improve EHM function (on-
line-only Data Supplement Figure IIIC). Factorial screens, 
including the assessment of the B27 supplement, were 
performed next with the aim to replace all animal culture 
medium components. To expedite the initial screens, we 
used simple HES2-cardiomyocyte aggregate cultures 
(online-only Data Supplement Figure IIID) and subsequent-
ly tested putative cardio-instructive factors in EHM. We 
first selected a particular B27 medium supplementation 
(4% with insulin) based on cell viability. We subsequently 
selected growth factors (FGF-2, insulin-like growth factor 
1 [IGF-1], transforming growth factor-β1 [TGF-β1], vas-
cular endothelial growth factor 165 [VEGF165]) for EHM 
testing according to the following criteria: (1) neutral or 
enhanced cell viability, and (2) enhanced cardiomyocyte 
actinin content or cardiomyocyte size. Last, we con-
firmed that the combination of FGF-2, IGF-1, TGF-β1, 
and VEGF165 was maximally effective in supporting the 
formation of force-generating EHMs (online-only Data 
Supplement Figure IIIE). In agreement with the impor-
tant role of extracellular matrix remodeling in early EHM 
cultures,29 we found that TGF-β1 treatment in the con-
solidation phase (day 0–3) was necessary for enhanced 
EHM function (online-only Data Supplement Figure IIIE). 
It is interesting to note that we observed that antioxi-
dants were not critical for EHM function and that omit-
ting insulin (B27 minus insulin) enhanced EHM function in 
comparison with insulin-containing B27 (online-only Data 
Supplement Figure IIIF). This led to the definition of a 
minimal Serum-free Protocol containing 4% B27 without 
insulin plus TGF-β1, IGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF165 (Table). Last, 
testing of the basal media identified calcium supplemen-
tation to physiological concentrations (1.2 mmol/L) as a 
critical parameter for optimal outcome (online-only Data 
Supplement Figure IIIG). Collectively, these experiments 
established a defined, Serum-free Protocol with mark-
edly enhanced contractile performance in comparison 
with the undefined Starting Protocol (Figure 1F; online-
only Data Supplement Movie III) and applicability to vari-
ous ESC- and iPSC-EHM models (online-only Data Supple-
ment Figure IV).
Evidence for Structural and Functional 
Maturation of EHMs
We next investigated whether the defined, Serum-free 
Protocol supports EHM maturation. Enzymatic dispersion 
of EHMs revealed cardiomyocytes with an elongated phe-
notype with sarcomeres in registry (Figure 2A, online-only 
Data Supplement Figure VA). In comparison with serum-
containing EHM cultures and in line with the functional 
outcome (Figure 1F), intact rod-shaped cardiomyocytes 
from EHMs constructed according to the Serum-free Pro-
tocol presented with a larger volume (12 
101±1240 ver-
sus 5649±1410 µm3), but similar aspect ratio (7.6±0.4 
versus 6.7±0.9; n=28/10). In comparison with 2D 
monolayer cardiomyocyte cultures and EHM construct-
ed according to the Starting Protocol, sarcomere size 
was larger in EHM constructed according to the defined, 
Serum-free Protocol (1.93±0.01 versus 1.81±0.01 ver-

sus 1.84±0.01 µm; >120 sarcomeres were analysed 
in 12/8/10 cardiomyocytes in the respective groups. 
The low cardiomyocyte volume (20 
000–35 
000 µm3 re-
ported in adult human cardiomyocytes32) was mainly at-
tributable to a smaller cell width in EHM (width: 13±0.5 
versus 20–35 µm; length: 92±4 versus 60–150 µm in 
adult human cardiomyocytes32,33). Note that cardiomyo-
cytes in EHM exhibited a similar width as observed in 
6-week-old infant heart (4–12 µm33). Ultrastructural analy-
ses revealed that cardiomyocytes in EHM displayed a re-
markable degree of sarcomere organization with clearly 
distinguishable Z, I, A, H, and M bands (Figure 2B, online-
only Data Supplement Figure IVB). Consistent with ear-
lier reports on largely absent M bands, even in extended 
stem cell–derived cardiomyocyte monolayer cultures34 
and tissue-engineered models,11–13,15 we found little orga-
nization of M bands in monolayer cardiomyocytes, but a 
high degree of organization in EHM-derived cardiomyo-
cytes (online-only Data Supplement Figure IVC). Also, en-
hanced MLC2V organization and presence of n-cadherin+ 
intercalated disk-like structures were observed in EHM 
cardiomyocytes (online-only Data Supplement Figure IVB 
and IVC).
Functional maturation was a continuous process with 
enhanced inotropic responses to calcium in older EHM 
(Figure 2C); this was despite similar cardiomyocyte con-
tent (online-only Data Supplement Figure VIA). Because 
EHM cross-sectional area decreased over time in culture 
(online-only Data Supplement Figure VIB), we opted to cor-
rect FOC by cross-sectional area to allow a direct com-
parison of the different models (HES and iPSC) and their 
developmental stages (Figure 2C); uncorrected FOC is 
displayed in online-only Data Supplement Figure VIC). The 
average maximal FOC developed by EHM after 8 weeks in 
culture (6.2±0.8 mN/mm2 at 1.5 Hz; n=8) exceeded the 
reported FOC (≈1 mN/mm2 at 1 Hz) in papillary muscle 
from human infants (3–14 months after birth)35 markedly, 
but remained lower than the FOC recorded in adult non-
failing myocardium (≈25 mN/mm2 at ≈1.5 Hz).36 It is in-
teresting to note that a positive force-frequency behavior 
(Bowditch phenomenon), which is absent in newborns and 
present in infants,35 was clearly developed in defined, se-
rum-free EHM (+19±5% at 2 Hz, +22±6% at 3 Hz versus 
1 Hz, studied at 4 weeks) in contrast to EHM constructed 
according to the undefined Starting Protocol (Figure 2D). 
In agreement with this finding, postrest potentiation 
(enhanced FOC by +9±1% [n=7] in the first electrically 
stimulated beat after a stimulation pause) was observed, 
providing evidence for intracellular calcium storage and 
release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Figure 2E).
Electrophysiological studies revealed that EHMs com-
prised mainly working myocardium-like cells without 
pronounced spontaneous phase 4 depolarization (Fig-
ure 2F). This suggests that the spontaneous contrac-
tions of EHM are under the control of a small portion 
of pacemaker cells in EHM (<10% of all cells analyzed).
Molecular Maturation of EHM
We next sought to use an unbiased approach to deter-
mine whether signs of molecular maturation could be 
identified inline with the observed structural and func-
tional maturation of EHM. Hence, we first determined the 
differential transcriptome in high purity (94±2% ACTN2+ 
by flow cytometry, n=9) PSC-derived cardiomyocytes 
(n=777 transcripts; HES2, hiPS-G1, hiPS-CDI; each 
n=3) and fibroblasts (n=200 transcripts; skin-, gingiva-, 
heart-derived fibroblasts; each n=3) by RNA sequencing 
(Figure 3A). As anticipated cardiomyocyte, the cardio-
myocyte (CM) transcriptome was highly enriched for 
sarcomeric transcripts, and the fibroblast transcriptome 
was enriched for transcripts encoding for extracellular 
matrix–associated proteins and proteins mediating cell-
cell or cell-matrix interactions (Figure 3B, refer to online-
only Data Supplement Tables III and IV for a full list of the 
identified CM and fibroblast transcriptomes including a 
comparison with fetal and adult heart expression levels).
We next used the CM transcriptome to establish a 
temporal gene expression profile from embryonic to 
adult heart, taking embryonic CMs (22-day-old mono-
layer HES2 CM, n=3), fetal heart (n=3), and adult heart 
(n=4) as reference time points. We classified 3 gene 
clusters: (1) genes with continuous increase (adult CM 
genes; n=218; Figure 3C, upper box), (2) genes with 
continuous decrease (embryonic CM genes; n=128; 
Figure 3C, lower box), and (3) genes without clear tra-
jectory (n=431) in expression (refer to online-only Data 
Supplement Table V for a full list of genes in each of the 
3 clusters). Transcriptional profiling revealed that tran-
scription of 174 and 110 of the adult CM genes was 
enhanced and transcription of 94 and 72 of the embry-
onic CM genes was reduced in parallel EHM (6 weeks) 
and 2D (60 days) cultures, respectively. Direct compari-
son of the CM maturation gene transcripts (embryonic 
plus adult CM genes; n=346) showed higher frequencies 
of fetal-adult gene expression levels in EHM, indicating 
enhanced molecular maturation in EHM versus 2D (Fig-
ure 3D). In comparison with 2D cultures, but also with 
undefined EHM cultures, a significant upregulation of 
pivotal CM genes involved in “ventricular cardiac muscle 
tissue morphogenesis” (gene ontology:0055010) fur-
ther confirmed the cardiotypic development and a high 
degree of maturation in EHM constructed according to 
the defined, Serum-free Protocol (Figure 3E, online-only 
Data Supplement Figure VII).

to simulate organotypic responses to catecholamine 
stimulation, including enhanced force development (in-
otropy), beating frequency (chronotropy), and relaxation 
(lusitropy); chronic application of norephinephrin (NE; α1-
, α2-, β1- > β2-adrenoceptor agonist) is classically used 
to induce pathological CM hypertrophy.
Although effects on chronotropy have been well es-
tablished in human PSC-derived CMs, so far, there is 
little evidence for regular inotropic responses,11,13,15 
suggesting functional immaturity of the β-adrenergic 
signaling cascade. Transcriptome analyses revealed 
lower transcript abundance for most adrenergic re-
ceptors, including, in particular, the β1(ADRB1)- and 
β2(ADRB2)-adrenoceptors, in EHM versus adult myo-
cardium (online-only Data Supplement Figure VIIIA). Irre-
spective of the transcript levels, we observed a robust 
inotropic response of EHM to isoprenaline, which was 
significantly enhanced in serum-free versus serum-
containing cultures (online-only Data Supplement Figure 
VIIIB and VIIIC). It is interesting to note that EHM dis-
played a similar sensitivity (EC50: 10±1 nmol/L; online-
only Data Supplement Figure VIIID) to isoprenaline as 
that reported for nonfailing myocardium.37 Classical 
pharmacological β1- and β2-adrenoceptor blocking ex-
periments with CGP-20712A and ICI-118551, respec-
tively, revealed that 32±6% of the acute inotropic ef-
fect in EHM were mediated via ADRB1 (online-only Data 
Supplement Figure VIIIE).
Chronic catecholamine overstimulation (serum levels 
in patients with heart failure: 1–10 nmol/L NE) contrib-
utes to heart failure development and progression.38 
In iPSC models, results have been variable with recent 
reports demonstrating the need for defined media to 
elicit CM hypertrophy.39 We asked whether EHMs would 
exhibit the clinically observed heart failure phenotype, 
including β-adrenergic desensitization, CM hypertrophy, 
and the release of biomarkers (such as brain natriuretic 
peptide40). To recapitulate sympathetic overstimulation, 
we exposed EHM to NE at clinically relevant concentra-
tions (0.001–1 µmol/L) for 7 days. We also included a 
group of EHMs exposed to endothelin-1 (0.01 µmol/L), 
a well-established inducer of CM hypertrophy via the 
alternative Gq-protein transduction pathway.41 Similarly 
as observed in patients, chronic NE stimulation induced 
contractile dysfunction in a concentration-dependent 
manner (Figure 4A) with desensitization to acute β-
adrenergic stimulation (Figure 4B), which, according to 
its underlying mechanism, only occurred under NE and 
not endothelin-1. To enable a cell type–specific analysis 
of cell size and cell composition, we developed a color-
coded EHM model comprising RFP+-CMs and GFP+-fibro-
blasts amenable to flow cytometry analyses (Figure 4C, 
online-only Data Supplement Movie IV). This allowed us 
to confirm enhanced CM hypertrophy (Figure 4D, online-
only Data Supplement Figure IX) and death (Figure 4E) 
in response to increasing NE concentrations. We also 
found the clinically relevant biomarker N-terminal pro 
B-type natriuretic peptide released in a concentration-
dependent manner (Figure 4F) and a blunted force-
frequency response in serum-free, but not serum-con-
taining EHM (online-only Data Supplement Figure XA). A 
consistent observation was that the pathological phe-
notype was, in general, more pronounced in serum-free 
EHM (summarized in online-only Data Supplement Figure 
XB) with a significantly reduced hypertrophic response 
in serum-containing EHM. This finding is consistent with 
earlier data on the hypertrophy-masking effects of se-
rum in human PSC-derived CMs.39 It is notable that the 
pathological phenotype could be partially or fully pre-
vented by β1-adrenoreceptor and α1-adrenoreceptor 
blockade with metoprolol and phenoxybenzamine, re-
spectively, demonstrating the applicability of EHM in the 
in vitro simulation of heart failure and its prevention by 
pharmacological means (Figure 4G).
Scaling of EHM for Heart Repair
Remuscularization of myocardial scar tissue in the fail-
ing heart will require sizable muscle surrogates. Accord-
ingly, we tested whether large EHM can be engineered 
under the defined, Serum-free EHM Protocol. We also 
reasoned that casting patches rather than loops would 
facilitate scaling toward clinical needs. Accordingly, we 
developed stamps with flexible tips by 3D printing for 
the penetration of EHM mixtures cast into a size-adapted 
mold (Figure 5A). This allowed us to scale EHM patches 
variably, reaching sizes for clinical translation (15×17 
mm and 35×34 mm containing 10×106 and 40×106 
CMs respectively; thickness: 0.5±0.1 mm, n=5; Fig-
ure 5B and 5C). Cells in EHM patches were homog-
enously distributed and structurally organized along 
traction force lines (Figure 5C). It is important to note 
that EHM patches and loops contracted similarly (online-
only Data Supplement Movie V). Because nondisruptive 
measurements will finally be essential to document EHM 
patch quality, we developed an optical force assessment 
strategy by correlating FOC recorded in individual EHM 
loops with FAC in EHM patches from the same produc-
tion runs. This analysis revealed a correlation of FOC and 
FAC recorded in EHM loops and patches, respectively 
(online-only Data Supplement Figure XI); further refine-
ment of this measure will be required to account for ho-
mogeneity, shape, and force distribution of the different 
culture formats.
In continuation of a recently completed experimental 
series for the assessment of feasibility and safety of 
EHM grafting,17 we now tested whether EHM patches 
would be retained after engraftment. In line with our re-
cent study with EHM loops, we could demonstrate that 
EHM patches formed sizable and structurally highly de-
veloped grafts in RNU rats (Figure 5D through 5F), which 
were progressively vascularized (Figure 5G).

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates that differentiated, force-gen-
erating human heart muscle can be generated in vitro 
under defined, serum-free conditions for applications in 
heart failure modeling and tissue-engineered heart repair. 
While the definition of cell composition and culture con-
ditions reduced variability and procedural complexity, it 
also supported CM structural and functional maturation 
beyond the current state-of-the-art. The reported proto-
col is adaptable to current good manufacturing practice 
and thus serves as the basis for highly standardized in 
vitro assay development and clinical translation of tissue-
engineered heart repair.
A number of factors have been previously identified to 
support maturation of human CMs in tissue-engineered 
heart muscle, such as mechanical stimulation13 and 
electric stimulation,12 and the coculture of CMs and fi-
broblasts, as well.15 In this study, we systematically 
screened culture conditions and identified the minimal 
requirements for EHM formations under highly defined 
conditions (Table: Serum-free Protocol). So far unrec-
ognized were the need for an adaptation of extracel-
lular calcium to physiological levels (1.2 mmol/L) and 
supplementation of TGFβ-1 during EHM consolidation. 
The requirement for calcium adaptations was identified 
serendipitously while testing different basal media with 
normal and reduced (RPMI 0.42 mmol/L) calcium. This 
observation is in agreement with the previously reported 
essential role of calcium for myofibrillogenesis in the 
mouse.43 The mode of action of TGFβ-1 during EHM con-
solidation appears to be enhanced fibroblast-mediated 
extracellular matrix remodeling, which was found ear-
lier to be crucial in rodent EHM models.29 Last, addition 
of IGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF165, and B27 without insulin were 
sufficient to replace all serum supplements. The use of 
clinical grade bovine collagen instead of the widely used 
Matrigel supplemented hydrogels44 further assisted in 
defining culture conditions.
Using our highly defined EHM protocol, we observed 
advanced structural, functional, and molecular matura-
tion of CMs. In fact, to our knowledge, the following mat-
uration characteristics have not been reported so far: (1) 
structural maturation with a rod-shaped CM morphology 
and sarcomers with distinguishable M bands; both pa-
rameters are rarely observed even in extended (1-year) 
monolayer cultures45; (2) dominant ventricular structural 
and functional maturation evidenced by abundant Myl2 
(MLC2V) positivity and characteristic action potential 
kinetics; and (3) functional maturation with contractile 
forces and physiological responses such as a positive 
force-frequency behavior observed only in postnatal 
myocardium.35,46 Although functional β1-adrenergic sig-
naling is minute in immature PSC-derived CMs,47 defined 
EHM displayed a robust β1-mediated inotropic response. 
The cardiotoxic effect of elevated norepinephrine levels 
further argues for relevant adrenergic signaling to model 
disease mechanisms of heart failure. Consistent with re-
cent work, the biomechanical stimulation of EHM may 
accelerate β-adrenergic maturation in comparison with 
monolayer CMs.47 Spontaneous contractions of EHM re-
quire specialized pacemaker cells. Random impalements 
with sharp electrodes for AP recordings did not identify 
bona fide pacemaker cells in defined, serum-free EHM. 
Optical imaging after loading with voltage-sensitive dyes 
or the use of genetically encoded voltage sensors48 may 
help to better localize regions with pacemaker activity 
and guide detailed electrophysiological studies to define 
the underlying mechanisms of EHM automaticity.
Transcriptional profiling in 6-week EHM was in agree-
ment with the structural and functional data, confirm-
ing an advanced degree of maturation in comparison 
with parallel monolayer cultures. However, reaching 
a fully adult phenotype remains a challenging task. In 
fact, unbiased global transcriptome profiling suggested 
that EHMs are, at large, similar to fetal human heart 
at 13 weeks of gestation, despite some morphological 
(M bands) and functional (Bowditch phenomenon) prop-
erties that develop postnatally. This suggests, on the 
one hand, that our defined, serum-free EHM protocol 
supports bona fide heart development in the dish to a 
notable extent, and, on the other hand, introduces an 
unbiased approach for the benchmarking of tissue-engi-
neered myocardium.
Taken together, we conclude that the serum-free EHM 
protocol can serve as the foundation for the definition of 
specific biological, pharmacological, or biophysical inter-
ventions controlling heart development. Whether in vitro 
interventions will finally enable the speeding up of heart 
development in a dish beyond the pace of natural car-
diomyogenesis remains to be elucidated. The principle 
propensity for advanced maturation was further support-
ed by long-term in vitro culture and in vivo implantation 
studies. We consider this an important prerequisite for 
applications of EHM in disease modeling, drug screens, 
and tissue-engineered heart repair.
