Abstract
 Background—Heart failure (HF) is associated with excess morbidity and mortality for which 
noncardiac causes are increasingly recognized. We previously described an increased risk of 
cancer among HF patients compared with community controls.
 Objectives—In the present study, we examined whether HF was associated with an increased 
risk of subsequent cancer among a homogenous population of first myocardial infarction (MI) 
survivors.
 Methods—A prospective cohort study was conducted among Olmsted County, Minnesota 
residents with incident MI from 2002 to 2010. Patients with prior cancer or HF diagnoses were 
excluded.
 Results—A total of 1,081 participants (mean age: 64 ± 15 years; 60% male) were followed for 
5,327 person-years (mean: 4.9 ± 3.0 years). A total of 228 patients developed HF and 98 patients 
developed cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). Incidence density rates for cancer 
diagnosis (per 1,000 person-years) were 33.7 for patients with HF and 15.6 for patients without 
HF (p = 0.002). The hazard ratio (HR) for cancer associated with HF was 2.16 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.39 to 3.35); adjusted for age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index; HR: 1.71 (95% 
CI: 1.07 to 2.73). The HRs for mortality associated with cancer were 4.90 (3.10 to 7.74) for HF-
free and 3.91 (1.88 to 8.12) for HF patients (p for interaction = 0.76).

  Conclusions—Patients who develop HF after MI have an increased risk of cancer. This 
finding extends our previous report of an elevated cancer risk after HF compared with controls, 
and calls for a better understanding of shared risk factors and underlying mechanisms.

 Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is associated with excess morbidity and mortality (1). The morbidity in 
HF patients can be attributed to: direct cardiac causes, such as HF symptoms, ischemia, and 
arrhythmias; related conditions, such as anemia, infections, and depression; and other 
noncardiac causes (2). These noncardiac causes of morbidity in HF patients are increasingly 
recognized as their association with HF is unraveled.
A specific case is made for malignancy. Although usually considered a separate cause of 
morbidity, it may be that an association exists between heart disease and an increased risk of 
cancer. Our group has indeed shown a 70% increased risk of cancer among HF patients in 
Olmsted County, Minnesota compared with community controls (3). In that study, controls 
were matched to HF patients by age and sex, and efforts were made to comprehensively 
adjust for other recognized factors. However, unrecognized characteristics and treatment 
may have differed between groups to influence the occurrence and/or detection of incident 
cancer.
Patients surviving a first myocardial infarction (MI) might later present with HF (4). The 
comparison of those with and without HF after MI has advantages because they share a 
common disease mechanism (atherosclerosis), risk factor profile, treatment modalities, and 
follow-up routines. Although certain characteristics and risk factors may differ between 
those who develop HF and those who do not, such as older age, obesity, smoking, diabetes, 
larger anterior infarcts (5), and delayed reperfusion (6), these are largely known and can be 
controlled for in the analysis. Therefore, comparing these 2 groups may provide more 
information on the impact of heart failure on the occurrence of subsequent cancer.
In this study, we evaluated the association between HF and subsequent cancer risk among 
first MI survivors.
 Methods
 Study Setting
This study was conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota under the auspices of the 
Rochester Epidemiology Project. Olmsted County is relatively isolated from other urban 
centers, and thus only a few providers deliver nearly all medical care to local residents (7). 
The medical records from these providers are indexed through the Rochester Epidemiology 
Project, resulting in the linkage of inpatient and outpatient medical records from all sources 
of care used by the population, thus providing a unique infrastructure to analyze disease 
determinants and outcomes (7).

  Study Design
A prospective cohort study was conducted among Olmsted County, Minnesota residents 
with incident MI from November 2002 through December 2010. Those with a diagnosis of 
HF or cancer prior to the MI diagnosis were excluded from the cohort. Patients who 
developed HF after the MI were identified and the incidence of cancer, excluding 
nonmelanoma skin cancer, was compared to those without HF. The study was approved by 
the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center Institutional Review Boards.
 MI Cohort
Only patients with a first MI were included in this cohort, as previously described in detail 
(8,9). The diagnosis of MI was verified on the basis of the presence of 2 of the following: 
typical chest pain; elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT); and electrocardiographic (ECG) 
changes. Cardiac troponin T was measured with a sandwich electrochemiluminescence 
immunoassay on the Elecsys 2010 (Roche Diagnostics Corp, Indianapolis, Indiana) in the 
laboratories of the Department of Medicine and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic.
 Follow-up
Participants were followed through their complete (inpatient and outpatient) medical records 
in the community, from the index MI date to death or the most recent clinical contact 
through March 2013.
 Heart Failure—Clinical diagnoses of HF were reviewed and validated according to the 
Framingham criteria. These criteria require the presence of at least 2 major criteria, or 1 
major criterion in addition to 2 minor criteria, to confirm HF (10). The type of HF was 
defined according to echocardiographically-measured ejection fraction (EF) as HF with 
reduced EF (EF <50%; HFrEF) or HF with preserved EF (EF ≥50%; HFpEF) (11). EF was 
measured as previously described (12). The EF measurement that was closest to the HF 
diagnosis (applying a predefined maximum period of 60 days) was recorded for each 
participant.
 Cancer—Cancer types were classified by anatomic and system primary involvement 
(13); nonmelanoma skin cancers were excluded from the study. The date of first cancer 
diagnosis was used as the diagnosis date.
 Death—Death was ascertained using multiple sources including autopsy reports, death 
certificates filed in Olmsted County, obituary notices, and electronic death certificates 
obtained from the Section of Vital Statistics, Minnesota Department of Health, as previously 
described (14).
 Clinical Characteristics
Nurse abstractors collected clinical data from the medical record using the MI date as the 
index. Smoking was categorized as never, past, or current (at time of evaluation or within the 
previous 6 months). Clinical definitions were used to identify diabetes, hypertension, and 
dyslipidemia. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated using the current weight and 
earliest adult height. Overall comorbidity burden was assessed by the Charlson comorbidity

 index (15). MI presentation according to ST-segment elevation and anterior location was 
determined, as well as Killip class. The latter was assessed within 24 h of the index MI and 
analyzed as a categorical variable (class >1 vs. class 1). Peak cTnT was defined as the 
highest cTnT measurement after MI. Data on medications prescribed at discharge were 
collected. Reperfusion therapy or revascularization included coronary artery bypass grafting, 
percutaneous coronary intervention, or thrombolysis performed during the index 
hospitalization.
 Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics, overall and by HF status during follow-up (regardless of the time of 
onset), are presented as mean and standard deviations for continuous variables, and as 
frequencies for categorical variables. Associations between baseline characteristics and 
development of HF were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models, using 
time from MI as the time scale. Cancer rates with person-time denominators were calculated 
for HF and HF-free categories and compared by Fisher exact test. Person-time at risk for the 
HF-free category was accumulated from the index MI until cancer, HF diagnosis, death, or 
end of follow-up, whichever came first. For the HF category, person-time at risk was 
accumulated from HF validation date until cancer, death, or end of follow-up, whichever 
came first. Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed to estimate the 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of cancer associated with 
HF. HF was modeled as a time-dependent variable, allowing subjects to transfer from one 
exposure group to another during follow-up. Initial adjustment was made for age, sex, and 
Charlson comorbidity index. To assess the robustness of the main analysis, additional 
adjustment was made for hypertension, smoking, BMI, anterior MI, peak cTnT, Killip class, 
reperfusion/revascularization, and treatment with aspirin at hospital discharge. Stratified 
analyses were performed by sex and age groups; exploratory analyses stratified the analyses 
according to HFrEF and HFpEF. Because age is a strong determinant of cancer risk, models 
were repeated using age as the time scale in the Cox model. Data on EF were missing in 
30% of the cases with HF. Multiple imputations were performed to account for missing EF 
values. Five datasets were created with missing values replaced by imputed values on the 
basis of a model that incorporated various demographic and clinical variables. The results of 
these datasets were then combined using Rubin’s rules (16).
The cumulative incidence of cancer after MI was estimated for up to 5 years and compared 
by HF status at 30 days following the index MI. In the customary Kaplan-Meier approach, 
patients who die are censored; however, this may overestimate the cumulative cancer 
incidence when the death rate is high. Therefore, death was treated as a competing event in 
this analysis (17). Finally, Cox models were constructed to assess the association between 
cancer and death, with cancer treated as a time-dependent variable. The proportional hazards 
assumption was tested and found to be valid. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical 
software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and WINPEPI, version 
11.23 (18).

  Results
Between 2002 and 2010, 1,616 patients were identified with incident MI. Of those, 535 
(33%) were excluded from the study because of a prior diagnosis of HF or cancer, resulting 
in a sample size of 1,081 (Figure 1). The mean age was 64 ± 15 years and 60% were men. 
ST-segment elevation MI occurred in 23% and anterior MI in 35% of the patients. 
Reperfusion or revascularization was performed in 61% of the patients during the index 
hospitalization. HF was diagnosed after MI in 228 patients (21%). Median time to HF 
diagnosis was 3 days (25th to 75th percentiles: 0 to 120 days). Patients with subsequent HF 
were, on average, 10 years older, more likely to be women, with adverse risk factors and 
larger infarctions. They also were less likely to receive reperfusion/revascularization. 
Treatment at discharge from MI with angiotensin blockade, beta-adrenergic blockade, and 
statins was similar between groups, whereas patients who developed HF were less often 
treated with aspirin (Table 1).
Patients were followed for a total of 5,327 person-years (mean ± SD, 4.9 ± 3.0 years). 
During follow-up, 228 patients developed HF and 98 patients developed cancer (70 
developed cancer with no HF diagnosed prior to the cancer [8.2% of patients without HF] 
and 28 developed cancer after HF diagnosis [12.3% of patients with HF]). Among patients 
who developed cancer, the median time from MI to cancer diagnosis was 2.8 years (25th to 
75th percentiles: 1.5 to 4.7 years). Incidence density rates for cancer diagnosis (per 1,000 
person-years) were 33.7 for patients with HF and 15.6 for patients without HF (p = 0.002) 
(Table 2).
Types of cancer were classified according to system involvement. Among patients with HF, 
the most common types of cancer were respiratory (n = 8; 29% of cancer diagnoses), 
digestive (n = 8; 29%), and hematologic (n = 4; 14%). The most common cancers among 
patients without HF were male reproductive (n = 15; 21%), respiratory (n =12; 17%), 
digestive (n = 10; 14%), and female breast (n = 8; 11%) (Table 3). The difference in cancer 
system involvement between groups was not statistically significant (Fisher exact test p = 
0.087).
The cumulative incidence of cancer among patients with and without HF 30 days after MI is 
shown in the Central Illustration. The incidence of cancer between groups was similar 
initially, but diverged after 1.5 years of follow-up, with higher rates of cancer among the HF 
patients. Including all HF diagnoses after MI, the unadjusted and adjusted associations 
between HF and cancer in the entire cohort, and by sex and age subgroups are shown in 
Table 2. Patients who developed HF had more than a 2-fold increased risk of cancer (HR: 
2.16; 95% CI: 1.39 to 3.35). After adjustment for age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index, 
the HR was 1.71 (95% CI: 1.07 to 2.73). With further adjustment for hypertension, smoking, 
BMI, anterior MI, peak cTnT, Killip class, reperfusion/revascularization, and treatment with 
aspirin at hospital discharge, the HR was 1.92 (95% CI: 1.11 to 3.11). Similar associations 
were observed among men, women, and patients older or younger than 75 years of age. 
Modeling age as the time scale in the Cox model produced similar associations.

 We conducted an exploratory analysis according to EF. Ejection fraction data were available 
for 160 (70%) HF patients. After multiple imputations for those missing EF data, of the 228 
patients with HF, 120 (53%) had HFrEF. Cancer was diagnosed in 16 (13%) patients with 
HFrEF and in 12 (11%) with HFpEF. Patients with HFrEF had an increased risk of cancer 
(unadjusted HR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.47 to 4.35). The association remained with adjustment for 
age and sex (HR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.31 to 3.95). In patients with HFpEF, a trend for increased 
risk of cancer was observed (unadjusted HR: 1.80; 95% CI: 0.97 to 3.51). Adjusting for age 
and sex weakened the association (HR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.88 to 3.10).
The age- and sex-adjusted HR (95% CI) for all-cause mortality associated with post-MI 
cancer (modeled as a time-dependent variable) was 4.83 (3.35 to 6.97). Stratified by HF 
status at 30 days post-MI, the HRs were 4.90 (3.10 to 7.74) for HF-free and 3.91 (1.88 to 
8.12) for HF patients (p for interaction = 0.76). In a complementary analysis, HF and cancer 
were both treated as time-dependent variables. Although both variables were strongly 
associated with mortality (age- and sex-adjusted HR: 4.49 [3.11 to 6.49] for cancer; 2.67 
[2.08 to 3.42] for HF), the interaction between the 2 terms was nonsignificant (p = 0.20).
 Discussion
The present study compared the incidence of cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) 
among survivors of a first MI with and without subsequent HF. Patients with HF were 71% 
more likely to have subsequent cancer, adjusted for age, sex, and the Charlson comorbidity 
index. This trend was seemingly more apparent among patients with reduced EF. Cancer 
involved multiple organ systems, without significant differences between the groups 
regarding system involvement. The increased incidence in cancer began approximately 1.5 
years after HF diagnosis. Both HF and cancer were independently associated with increased 
mortality after MI.
We previously reported an increased risk of cancer among HF patients as compared with 
community controls (3). In the present, study, the HF and non-HF patients shared many of 
the risk factors, diagnostic procedures, and medications because all patients were survivors 
of MI. Therefore, the present study supports the previous finding that HF is associated with 
an increased risk of cancer.
Increased physician encounters and diagnostic procedures that occur in patients with HF 
may enhance or facilitate cancer diagnosis (detection bias). Similar to the previous study, a 
lag time of 1.5 years was observed between the HF diagnosis (occurring in the majority of 
cases within days of the MI) and cancer diagnosis. Most of the increased health demands of 
HF patients occur early (during the first year of diagnosis) (19). Therefore, the timing of 
cancer diagnosis observed herein argues against detection bias as a major cause of cancer 
diagnosis in the HF group.
The association between HF and cancer raises concerns regarding the effects of specific 
cardiovascular medications, including angiotensin-receptor blockers, cardiac glycosides, 
diuretic agents, statins, and prasugrel. Data on a possible association have been inconclusive 
in most cases (20), and studies disputing the association with glycosides (21,22), and with 
Hasin et al.

 diuretics (23) were recently published. In the current study, patients who developed HF did 
not differ by statins or angiotensin antagonists prescribed at MI hospital discharge compared 
to patients who did not develop HF. Although data on prasugrel are lacking, patients with 
subsequent HF were less likely to undergo reperfusion/revascularization and less likely to be 
discharged on aspirin; therefore, it is unlikely that treatment with prasugrel was more 
frequent in this group. Although the study design limits a conclusive statement, there was no 
indication that treatment was associated with an increased risk of cancer.
In an exploratory analysis, we observed a seemingly more prominent risk of cancer in 
patients with reduced EF. This observation should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating, 
rather than hypothesis-testing. The pathways leading to altered healing and reduced EF after 
MI are complex, and HF after MI was reported to be associated with altered immunity, 
highlighting the role of the monocyte system (24). These or similar mechanisms for repair of 
damaged tissue might also be associated with an increased risk of cancer.
Cancer constitutes an enormous burden to society (25), and both cancer and HF are well-
known causes of increased mortality (26). Although these 2 chronic conditions were 
previously viewed as unlinked (with the occasional patient suffering HF as a consequence of 
cancer treatment), the data presented herein suggest there may be a connection between 
them. Although HF patients have an increased risk of mortality, cancer also increases that 
risk. By better understanding the mechanism involved, we can hope to decrease the risk of 
mortality. In the meantime, physicians taking care of HF patients should be aware of the 
increased risk of cancer and endorse the current guidelines for proper cancer surveillance for 
early detection.
 Strengths and Limitations
The observational nature of the analysis entails the obvious limitations. Data were not 
available for ongoing medical treatment and laboratory results. Echocardiographic data were 
available for only 70% of the HF patients, necessitating the use of multiple imputations. 
Although findings were statistically significant, the small sample size and number of events 
are a potential limitation, and confirmation with a larger cohort may be warranted. 
Conversely, the utilization of a well-defined contemporary cohort of first MI patients, the 
availability of baseline characteristics including discharge medications, the long-term 
follow-up with comprehensive validated data on HF, cancer, and mortality, and the 
utilization of advanced statistical methods are all important strengths of the present study.
 Conclusions
Patients who develop HF after MI have an increased risk of cancer. The risk is increased 
irrespective of age and sex, and confers an additional risk of death. The current findings 
extend our previous report of an elevated cancer risk after HF compared with controls, and 
calls for a better understanding of shared risk factors and underlying mechanisms.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
Patients developing HF after MI exhibit an increased risk of developing cancer, 
underscoring the importance of multimorbidity as a determinant of outcomes among 
patients with cardiovascular disease.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOKS
Future research is needed to explore the mechanisms linking cardiovascular disease and 
cancer, and to identify common risk factors
