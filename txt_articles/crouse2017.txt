Summary
Background Findings from published studies suggest that exposure to and interactions with green spaces are 
associated with improved psychological wellbeing and have cognitive, physiological, and social benefits, but few 
studies have examined their potential effect on the risk of mortality. We therefore undertook a national study in 
Canada to examine associations between urban greenness and cause-specific mortality.
Methods We used data from a large cohort study (the 2001 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort 
[2001 CanCHEC]), which consisted of approximately 1·3 million adult (aged ≥19 years), non-immigrant, urban 
Canadians in 30 cities who responded to the mandatory 2001 Statistics Canada long-form census. The cohort has 
been linked by Statistics Canada to the Canadian mortality database and to annual income tax filings through 2011. 
We measured greenness with images from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer from NASA’s Aqua 
satellite. We assigned estimates of exposure to greenness derived from remotely sensed Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index (NDVI) within both 250 m and 500 m of participants’ residences for each year during 11 years of 
follow-up (between 2001 and 2011). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between 
residential greenness (as a continuous variable) and mortality. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 
95% CIs per IQR (0·15) increase in NDVI adjusted for personal (eg, education and income) and contextual covariates, 
including exposures to fine particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. We also considered effect modification by 
selected personal covariates (age, sex, household income adequacy quintiles, highest level of education, and marital 
status).
Findings Our cohort consisted of approximately 1 265 000 individuals at baseline who  contributed 11 523 770 person-
years. We showed significant decreased risks of mortality in the range of 8–12% from all causes of death examined 
with increased greenness around participants’ residence. In the fully adjusted analyses, the risk was significantly 
decreased for all causes of death (non-accidental HR 0·915, 95% CI 0·905–0·924; cardiovascular plus diabetes 0·911, 
0·895–0·928; cardiovascular 0·911, 0·894–0·928; ischaemic heart disease 0·904, 0·882–0·927; cerebrovascular 0·942, 
0·902–0·983; and respiratory 0·899, 0·869–0·930). Greenness associations were more protective among men than 
women (HR 0·880, 95% CI 0·868–0·893 vs 0·955, 0·941–0·969), and among individuals with higher incomes 
(highest quintile 0·812, 0·791–0·834 vs lowest quintile 0·991, 0·972–1·011) and more education (degree or more 
0·816, 0·791–0·842 vs did not complete high school 0·964, 0·950–0·978).
Interpretation Increased amounts of residential greenness were associated with reduced risks of dying from several 
common causes of death among urban Canadians. We identified evidence of inequalities, both in terms of exposures 
to greenness and mortality risks, by personal socioeconomic status among individuals living in generally similar 
environments, and with reasonably similar access to health care and other social services. The findings support the 
development of policies related to creating greener and healthier cities.

Introduction
Globally, more than half of the world’s population lives in 
cities, and in developed countries, this figure exceeds 75%.1 
In Canada, two-thirds of the population currently live in 
census metropolitan areas (that have populations greater 
than 100 000 individuals).2 With more people moving to 
cities every year, there is interest in understanding how 
urban settings and aspects of the built-up environment 
affects health outcomes. Residents in large cities might 
be exposed regularly to environmental stresses, including 
traffic congestion, heat island effects, poor air quality, and 
noise pollution, which might have adverse effects on their 
health. Natural environments, including green spaces, 
are recognised as features of the built-up environment 
with potential to mitigate some of these adverse effects by 
acting as visual amenities or as places that offer 
opportunities for social or physical activities.3 Green 
spaces and indices describing the presence of green 
vegetation have been associated with reduced negative 
perception of noise,4 urban heat,5 concentrations of air

pollution,6 and psycho 
logical stress.7 Overall, findings 
from reviews3,8 have identified that interactions with 
natural spaces are associated with both physiological and 
psychological benefits to health.
Few studies, however, have examined the link between 
natural green spaces and mortality. Most of these have 
relied on cross-sectional or ecological study designs, and 
have produced inconsistent findings.9 Despite limitations 
and differences in design among the previous studies, 
findings from a systematic review concluded that there is 
moderate to strong evidence for an association between 
green spaces and both all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality.10 For example, James and colleagues11 reported 
lower mortality rates for non-accidental deaths among 
people living in areas with the highest quintile of green 
vegetation around their home compared with those in the 
lowest quintile, in a cohort of around 100 000 American 
women. A Canadian cohort study of approximately 
575 000 adults in urban Ontario also showed significant 
reductions in cause-specific mortality associated with 
increased greenness around participants’ residences.12 
However, no nationally representative cohort studies have 
been done in Canada or elsewhere examining the 
association between greenness and mortality. We 
therefore sought to examine the benefit of living in 
greener areas on the health of urban Canadians in a large, 
national cohort study (the 2001 Canadian Census Health 
and Environment Cohort [2001 CanCHEC]). We looked at 
whether residential greenness was associated with 
reduced risk of dying from cause-specific mortality 
among urban, non-immigrant adults, while controlling 
for a wide range of individual and contextual covariates, 
and exposures to ambient fine particulate matter 
(PM2·5), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Additionally, we 
investigated whether associations between greenness and 
risk of mortality varied by selected personal characteristics.
Methods
Study cohort
2001 CanCHEC has been described in detail previously.13 
Briefly, it is a nationally representative sample of 
approximately 1·3 million individuals in 30 cities. The 
cohort consists of respondents to the mandatory 2001 
Statistics Canada long-form census, and is linked by 
Statistics Canada to the Canadian mortality database and 
to annual income tax filings through 2011.13 Individuals 
were eligible for the cohort if they were aged at least 
19 years, were usual residents of Canada on the census 
day; were not long-term residents of an institution, and 
had filed a tax return during the follow-up period. The 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the PubMed database for epidemiological studies of 
associations between mortality and exposure to natural 
environments, defined as “nature”, “parks”, “greenness”, 
“Normalized Difference Vegetation Index”, “NDVI”, “green space”, 
“greenspace”, and “presence of green vegetation”. We included 
peer-reviewed studies published up to May 1, 2017, regardless of 
location of study or language of publication. We also perused the 
bibliographies of relevant articles and of published reviews. 
Although several published studies had examined associations 
between natural environments and other outcomes, we 
identified only 12 articles that looked at associations with 
mortality. Most of these studies were ecological or cross-sectional 
in design; about half were done in Europe and about half in 
North America. Only two studies were national in scope, one of 
which was cross-sectional, and one of which had a small sample 
size and only included women. Despite the shortage of evidence, 
findings generally suggested that living in areas with higher 
amounts of green spaces was associated with reduced mortality, 
with the strongest association for deaths from cardiovascular 
disease. Findings from a review concluded that cohort studies 
that accounted better for socioeconomic status, among other 
issues, were needed to provide stronger evidence on this topic.
Added value of this study
We showed significant protective effects for several common 
causes of mortality associated with living in greener areas of 
cities. We also showed increasingly protective effects associated 
with each increment of higher income and higher levels of 
education. The key strengths of our research compared with 
previous studies included the study design (a nationally 
representative prospective cohort study), the large sample size 
(nearly 1·3 million participants), and that we reported results 
for effect modification by several indicators of socioeconomic 
status. We also had the advantage of controlling our survival 
models for many personal and contextual covariates, including 
exposures to ambient fine particulate matter, ozone, 
and nitrogen dioxide.
Implications of all the available evidence
Within Canada and globally, more people are moving to cities 
and urban areas every year. There is great interest in 
understanding how urban settings and aspects of a built-up 
environment can change health outcomes. Residents in cities 
might be exposed regularly to environmental stresses such as 
traffic congestion, heat island effects, poor air quality, and noise 
pollution, with adverse results on their health; natural 
environments have been identified as having the potential to 
mitigate some of these adverse effects. Our findings suggest 
that increasing the amount of green vegetation in urban areas 
might have important benefits in reducing mortality. Given the 
potential benefits to health as reported here, findings from this 
study should be of interest to city planners, urban designers, 
landscape architects, and policy makers seeking evidence to 
support the development of policies related to creating greener 
and healthier cities.

long-form census included content related to education, 
income, and employment and family status, among 
many other topics. The linkage to the annual income tax 
files provided annual six-digit residential postal codes, 
which allowed us to include participants’ annual 
residential mobility. In urban areas, postal codes often 
correspond to one side of a city block or to a single 
apartment building.
We excluded immigrants because they, especially those 
who immigrated recently, tend to have better health 
status and health behaviours than do the Canadian-born 
population, patterns which can persist for up to 20 years 
after immigration.14 Immigrants might have had vastly 
different past environmental exposures than Canadian-
born subjects, and were less likely to have chronic health 
conditions or disability because of the screening process 
that disqualifies people with serious medical conditions.15 
For these reasons, associations between greenness and 
health among immigrants would have required separate 
analyses. We also restricted this study to individuals 
living in the 30 largest census metropolitan areas 
according to population data from 2006 (the mid-point of 
our follow-up period).16 Here we focused on urban 
environments to understand whether living in greener 
areas of cities moderated the effects of risks to health and 
wellbeing associated with urban living. We restricted our 
study to urban populations given that living in proximity 
to natural spaces in rural areas might not have the same 
relationship with health as it might in a city.
Assignment of exposures to greenness
We assigned estimates of exposure to greenness to the 
representative point of each participant’s residential 
postal code for every year between 2001 and 2011. Missing 
postal codes, which could indicate that an individual had 
left Canada, moved to an institution, or that they had not 
filed a tax return that year, were imputed using a method 
based on reported postal codes for the years before 
and after a missing record.17 This method led to the 
imputation of approximately 18% of all person-years 
nationally. Participants were coded as having missing 
exposure data for the years in which their postal code was 
located outside one of the 30 cities.
Our estimates of greenness were derived from the 
remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index (NDVI). The NDVI is the most widely used 
satellite-derived indicator of the quantity of green 
vegetation on the ground18 and has been used as a marker 
for exposure to greenness and green spaces in 
many previous epidemiological studies.11,12,19 Theoretically, 
NDVI values have a range of –1 to 1, with negative values 
representing water, values around zero representing bare 
soil, and higher positive values representing dense green 
vegetation. Here we restricted our data to values greater 
than 0 (ie, 0·01 to 1·00) to disentangle the effects of 
greenness from the potential effects of living near water.
We used images from the moderate-resolution 
imaging spectroradiomenter from NASA’s Aqua 
satellite, which are available across Canada at a spatial 
resolution of 250 m as 16-day averages, as far back 
as 2002. We calculated annual maximum greenness 
values averaged over the summer months for each year 
from 2002 to 2011 (and therefore excluded observations 
from winter months when much of the ground would 
be covered by snow, and which would have provided 
incomplete or inaccurate information about the 
presence of vegetation). In this way, our estimates of 
greenness described the levels of vegetation when 
plants are fully developed and in peak bloom, rather 
than the average level of vegetation throughout the 
year. Next, we calculated long-term mean values over 
this 10-year period. In the absence of comparable data 
for earlier periods, we assumed that the 10-year mean 
values represented the longer-term historical patterns 
of greenness and assigned exposure to those values to 
participants’ residential postal codes for each year of 
follow-up. Thus, variation in estimates of exposure for 
each participant in each year of follow-up was attributed 
solely to residential mobility patterns. We assigned to 
each participant the 10-year mean NDVI values within 
both 250 m and 500 m of their residence.
Statistical analysis
We rounded counts of individuals randomly to the 
nearest five for institutional confidentiality. We used Cox 
proportional hazards models to estimate associations 
between residential greenness (as a continuous variable) 
and mortality. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) stratified 
by sex, by 5-year age groups from age 25 to 89 years (due 
to potential inaccuracies in record-linkages among older 
individuals), and by census metropolitan area. We 
censored participants at date of death or if they were lost 
to follow-up because of the end of study period, or if they 
had moved away from one of the study cities.
We adjusted our models for the following individual-
level covariates at baseline: Aboriginal identity, visible 
minority status, marital status, highest level of education, 
employment status, and household income adequacy 
quintiles. Visible minorities were deemed as individuals 
(other than Aboriginal people) who were non-white in race 
or colour. Income adequacy quintiles were calculated from 
the ratio between the pre-tax income of economic families 
to the Statistics Canada low-income cutoff for family and 
community size, adjusted for regional economical 
differences. Area-based income adequacy ratios adjust for 
regional differences in family economic status, such as 
housing costs.13 We also calculated time-varying, contextual 
variables at the census division-level from the closest 
census year (ie, either 2001, 2006, or 2011) describing the 
proportion of unemployed adults aged at least 25 years, the 
proportion of adults aged at least 25 years who had not 
completed high school, and the proportion of individuals 
in low-income families (ie, below the Statistics Canada 
low-income cutoff). Canadian census divisions are roughly

the size of a large city or county. To capture living in a 
denser, urban core, as opposed to living in more suburban 
areas of a city, we calculated a time-varying log of 
population density (individuals per km²) at the scale of 
dissemination areas from the closest census year. 
Dissemination areas are typically equivalent in size to one 
or more adjacent city blocks and have populations of 
approximately 400–700 individuals.
Finally, we adjusted our models for exposures to ambient 
air pollution, which is a known negative stress upon health 
in urban areas.20 For this adjustment, we used estimates 
from existing models and observations of PM2·5, ozone, 
and nitrogen dioxide. Each of these datasets have been 
described previously (PM2·5;21 ozone;22 and nitrogen 
dioxide23), and used in previous epidemiological analyses.24 
Briefly, the PM2·5 data were satellite-derived annual 
estimates at a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km. For ozone 
calculations we used the 8-h average daily maximum 
concentrations obtained from model-observation data 
fusion at a resolution of approximately 21  km × 21 km in 
the warm seasons from 2002 to 2009. The nitrogen dioxide 
data were derived from a national 2006 land-use regression 
model developed from observations from fixed-site 
stations and incorporating satellite-derived nitrogen 
dioxide estimates and land-use predictors. Ozone and 
nitrogen dioxide estimates were year-adjusted using 
ground-based time-series measurements from 1981 
to 2012. Following a similar approach to what we have 
implemented elsewhere,24 we assigned these exposures as 
3-year moving windows of previous exposures, with a 
single-year lag, with the intention of describing past 
exposures to these pollutants.
We developed hazard models for six common causes 
of mortality including: all non-accidental causes 
(10th revision of the International Statistical Classification 
of Diseases and Related Health Problems [ICD-10] A to R); 
cardiovascular plus diabetes (ICD-10 I10 to I69, 
E10 to E14); cardiovascular diseases (ICD-10 I10 to I69); 
ischaemic heart disease (ICD-10 I20 to I25); cerebro-
vascular disease (ICD-10 I60 to I69); and non-malignant 
diseases of the respiratory system (ICD-10 J00-J99). We 
calculated HRs per increment of the IQR in exposure to 
greenness in 0·15 units.
We tested for effect modification by selected 
characteristics with non-accidental mortality. Specifically, 
we used Cochran’s Q statistic25 to test heterogeneity in 
HRs by age, sex, income, education, and marital status. 
We examined models in which we considered the mean 
amount of greenness within 500 m of each participant’s 
residence to examine whether this factor would 
strengthen or attenuate the associations.
Given that 2001 CanCHEC did not include information 
on smoking or other health behaviours, we developed 
models adjusted identically to our fully adjusted models 
with participants in the smaller Canadian Community 
Health Survey (CCHS) mortality cohort, which does 
contain such information.26 These models allowed us to 
observe the effect of adjusting additionally for smoking, 
body-mass index (BMI), and consumption of alcohol,

Data are descriptive statistics of participants at baseline and fully adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for risk factors included in the 
survival models for all non-accidental causes of death. HRs and 95% CIs for associations between green space and 
non-accidental mortality; HRs computed per IQR (0·15). All models were adjusted for visible minority status, Aboriginal 
identity, marital status, highest level of education, income quintile, and labour force status; models stratified by 5-year age 
groups, sex, and by census metropolitan area. Models were also adjusted for three variables calculated at the census 
division level with data from the most recent census year: (1) unemployed—the proportion of adults (aged ≥25 years) who 
were unemployed in the census division. This does not include individuals who were not in the labour force. 
(2) Education—the proportion of adults (aged ≥25 years) who had not graduated from high school or its equivalent. 
(3) Income—the proportion of individuals of any age in low-income families (using low-income cutoff definition). Models 
were also adjusted for population density, and exposures to ambient fine particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide.

fruits, and vegetables, all of which are associated with 
mortality and are available in the CCHS. The 
CCHS-mortality cohort includes respondents enrolled 
between 2000 and 2008 and followed up for mortality 
until the end of 2011. We excluded individuals aged less 
than 25 years and more than 90 years at baseline, and 
immigrants 
who 
immigrated 
during 
the 
previous 
20 
years.27 
We explored models only for non-accidental deaths 
because restricting this cohort to respondents in the 
30 cities reduced the sample size too greatly to consider 
other causes reliably.
Lastly, we examined the shape of the concentration-
response curve for greenness on non-accidental 
mortality. For this, we used a class of shape-constrained 
health-effect functions,28 which fitted several different 
shapes of association as variations on sigmoidal 
functions, the ensemble of which was created by a 
weighted average of all shapes considered with weights 
defined by the likelihood function values.

Results
Our cohort consisted of approximately 1 265 000 indi 
viduals 
at baseline who contributed a total of 11 523 770 person-
years (table 1). 106 180 individuals died during the 10·6 years 
of follow-up (table 2). Overall, mean exposure to greenness 
(ie, mean NDVI score within 250 m) was 0·58 (SD 0·11); 
exposures ranged from 0·13 to 0·96 (IQR 0·15). There 
were modest gradients of increasing exposures to 
greenness associated with increasing incomes and 
education levels: individuals in the lowest income quintile 
had a mean exposure of 0·55 compared with those in the 
highest who had a slightly higher average of 0·60. We also 
examined correlations between exposures assigned in each 
year and identified Pearson coefficients of more than 0·8 
between values in each case, which suggested that there 
was little spatial variation in greenness values among these 
locations over this 10-year period.
Estimates of residential greenness were r=–0·24 with 
nitrogen dioxide among participants in these 30 cities. 
We noted significant protective effects of greenness for 
each cause of death (table 2); controlling for personal 
characteristics attenuated the associations, but controlling 
for the contextual covariates had negligible effects. 
Adjustment for population density reduced HRs by 
approximately 4% in all cases. Among the three 
pollutants, controlling for ozone had no effect on HRs, 
PM2·5 reduced them slightly, and nitrogen dioxide 
reduced them by approximately 4–6% in all cases.
In our fully adjusted models we noted significant 
decreased risks of mortality with all causes of death 
examined. We found the most protective effects for 
deaths from respiratory diseases and the weakest effects

for deaths from cerebrovascular disease. We showed a 
decreased risk of dying of approximately 9–10% per IQR 
in exposure to greenness with all other causes of death 
examined in these models.
We noted stronger protective associations among 
men and among individuals aged 35–74 years 
compared with both younger and older individuals 
(table 3). We showed increasingly protective effects 
among individuals in each increasing income quintile 
(and no association among those in the lowest quintile, 
and in individuals according to each level of increased 
educational attainment. We also showed more 
protective effects among those who were married or in 
common-law relationships compared with individuals 
who were separated, widowed, or divorced. In models 
using the amount of greenness within 500 m as the 
exposure of interest, we showed slightly stronger, 
more protective associations with all six causes of 
death (appendix).
We showed weaker associations between greenness 
and mortality with the CCHS survey (table 4). However, 
we showed that additional adjustments for smoking, 
BMI, and consumption of alcohol, fruit, and vegetables 
improved model fit, but had no appreciable effect on the 
effect estimate. Lastly, the shape of the relationship 
between greenness and non-accidental death was slightly 
non-linear (figure).
Discussion
The findings from our study showed that living in urban 
areas characterised by increased amounts of greenness 
appears to reduce the risk of mortality from several 
common causes of death. This is the first study to 
examine the relationship between exposure to greenness 
and mortality across Canada. In this large, nationally 
representative cohort of urban Canadian non-immigrant 
adults we showed a significant decreased risk of dying 
from several causes of death associated with increased 
estimates of greenness within both 250 m and 500 m of 
participants’ residences. Controlling for exposures to 
ambient nitrogen dioxide strengthened the associations 
substantially. We showed significantly more protective 
effects among men and among participants with higher 
incomes and more education. Moreover, we showed no 
association among individuals in the lowest income 
quintile. The increased protective effects among 
individuals in categories of higher income and education 
were commensurate with increased estimates of 
exposure among individuals in these groups as well—ie, 
some more affluent populations have not only greater 
exposures to greenness, but also increased benefits to 
their health, compared with those in less-affluent groups. 
The finding of greater exposures to greenness among 
more affluent groups is consistent with those reported in 
an English population-based study,29 and those from an 
earlier Canadian study based on individuals in Ontario,12 
but few others have reported on differences in exposures 
to greenness by income or by socioeconomic status. The

finding of increased benefits to health among more 
affluent groups, however, is largely inconsistent with 
results from previous studies that have considered 
associations between greenness or greenspace and 
several health outcomes, including mortality.3,30 One 
hypothesis to explain the stronger effects elsewhere 
among more deprived populations is that such 
populations tend to have poorer health status and higher 
levels of stress, such that they stand to benefit more from 
a restorative environment. Here we propose that more 
affluent populations might have more true leisure time, 
and tend to spend more time outside and enjoying their 
property at weekends or during other time off from work 
compared with lower-income populations and those who 
are unemployed or unable to work.31 Furthermore, the 
quality of the greenspaces around the homes of more 
affluent populations might be different from those 
around people in more deprived populations, which is a 
factor that we were unable to assess or describe with our 
existing datasets.
Our finding of strongest protective associations among 
individuals aged 35–74 years suggests that among adults, 
middle age might be an aetiologically important window 
during which living close to greenness might yield the 
largest benefits to health. Results of effect modification 
by sex and age in the context of greenspace and health 
have been inconsistent in the scientific literature (with 
some studies showing stronger effects for women, others 
for men, and others no differences; the same is true for 
different age groups of adults).3,30 There have been several 
potential explanations for these differences by sex and 
age, including differing daily health behaviours and 
exposure patterns (which might be partly determined by 
employment status and child-rearing responsibilities), 
perceptions of nature, and the kinds of activities done 
while in natural environments.
Few other studies have examined the potential link 
between mortality and exposure to natural environments. 
A systematic review9 identified only 12 such studies, 
seven of which had ecological study designs. Despite the 
shortage of evidence, the investigators concluded that 
increased exposure to green space appears to be 
associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality. 
In our study, we showed associations that were more 
protective than those reported in the only previous 
Canadian study.12 For non-accidental mortality, those 
investigators reported HR 0·95 (95% CI 0·94–0·97) 
per IQR increase in NDVI within 500 m of participants’ 
residences. They also adjusted their models for estimates 
of ambient nitrogen dioxide, but, unlike our results, they 
showed that it had no effect on their risk estimates.
Our findings of associations with non-accidental 
mortality among women were more attenuated than 
those reported in a cohort study11 of American women 
that also examined associations between mortality and 
greenness measured within 250 m of participants’ 
homes. Those investigators reported HR 0·88 (95% CI 
0·82–0·94) per increment of 0·10 in exposure for 
non-accidental deaths, compared with HR 0·96 (95% CI 
0·94–0·97) from our most comparable model.
2001 CanCHEC is a very large, broadly representative 
national cohort. In addition to age and sex, we also 
stratified our survival models by census metropolitan area, 
which ensured that participants were compared only with 
others living in the same urban communities, and thus 
also in areas with similar climates, and with similar access 
to health care and other services. We were able to track 
participants’ residential mobility patterns with annual 
postal codes, which have high positional accuracy in urban 
areas, thus minimising exposure misclassification. A key 
strength of our study is that we were able to adjust our 
survival models additionally for potential exposures to 
ambient air pollution. Controlling for other environmental 
exposures, nitrogen dioxide in particular, improved our 
models and had substantial effects on our effect estimates. 
We know from earlier studies that estimates of intraurban 
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide are associated with 
mortality,32 and the estimates of nitrogen dioxide that we 
used were also associated with our estimates of residential 
greenness. It is therefore not unexpected that adjusting for 
this confounding variable strengthened the associations. 
We believe that nitrogen dioxide had a stronger effect on 
our results than did either PM2·5 or ozone because of the 
higher spatial resolution of that model compared with 
those for the other two pollutants.
Another strength of our study was that we were able to 
collect and assign exposures that were temporally 
consistent with our cohort follow-up period. A key 
limitation of the NDVI is that it describes only the 
presence and amount of vegetation, and not its quality or 
accessibility. That is, the index does not allow 
differentiation between a park, woodlot, or agricultural 
field, or identification of whether it represents private or

public space. Nonetheless, after adjusting for many 
individual-level and community-level covariates, NDVI 
has been shown12,19,33 to be associated with higher levels of 
physical activity, and with several health outcomes.
Although we were unable to adjust directly for smoking 
or other personal health behaviours in our main analysis, 
our results with the CCHS data suggest that although 
those variables are important predictors of mortality, they 
do not appear to affect the association between greenness 
and mortality. The small size of the CCHS cohort 
restricted our ability to detect significant associations 
between greenness and mortality in this sample. 
Residential self-selection is another issue that we could 
not consider—namely that some people, perhaps those 
who are more active or more educated (or generally 
healthier than others), might choose (and be able to 
afford) to live in greener neighbourhoods. It is important 
to consider the potential influence on our findings of the 
social gradient in health—ie, that individuals of higher 
socioeconomic position tend to have better health than 
those of lower socioeconomic position.34
The fact that we found stronger associations with 
greenness within 500 m of participants’ homes suggests 
that metric possibly better reflects subjects’ typical 
activity 
spaces 
where 
important 
exposures 
or 
interactions with natural environments might take 
place. Future studies could explore associations within 
different buffer sizes with the purpose of identifying 
relevant exposure areas for different health benefits, 
along with exploring different exposure time-windows 
and lag periods.
Our results broadly describe associations only with 
living in a greener area. Furthermore, we did not 
consider participants’ potential daily activities and 
exposures 
within 
and 
beyond 
their 
home 
neighbourhoods. Our results therefore did not allow us 
to identify whether the observed reductions in mortality 
were related to corresponding reductions in noise, heat, 
or air pollution associated with greener areas, or if 
exposure to greener, more natural environments 
produced an overall restorative, stress-reducing effect 
that ultimately contributed to improved cardiovascular 
health. Future research should seek to understand which 
kinds of natural environments contribute the greatest 
benefits to health, and should also consider issues 
related to access, sight lines, and time actually spent in 
these environments.
Living in urban areas characterised by increased 
amounts of greenness seems to reduce the risk of 
mortality from several common causes of death. We 
identified evidence of inequalities both in terms of 
exposures to greenness, and in terms of benefits to 
longevity, by personal socioeconomic status among 
subjects living in generally similar environments, and 
with reasonably similar access to health care and other 
social services. Given the potential benefits to health, 
findings from this study should be of interest to planners 
and policy makers seeking evidence to support the 
creation of greener and healthier cities.
