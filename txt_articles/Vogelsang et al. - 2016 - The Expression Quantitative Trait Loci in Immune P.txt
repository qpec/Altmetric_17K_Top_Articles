Abstract
Purpose: The identification of personalized germline markers
with biologic relevance for the prediction of cutaneous melanoma
prognosis is highly demanded but to date, it has been largely
unsuccessful. As melanoma progression is controlled by host
immunity, here we present a novel approach interrogating immu-
noregulatory pathways using the genome-wide maps of expres-
sion quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to reveal biologically relevant
germline variants modulating cutaneous melanoma outcomes.
Experimental Design: Using whole genome eQTL data from a
healthy population, we identified 385 variants significantly
impacting the expression of 268 immune-relevant genes. The
40 most significant eQTLs were tested in a prospective cohort of
1,221 patients with cutaneous melanoma for their association
with overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival using Cox regres-
sion models.
Results: We identified highly significant associations with
better melanoma OS for rs6673928, impacting IL19 expression
(HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41–0.77; P ¼ 0.0002) and rs6695772,
controlling the expression of BATF3 (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.19–
2.24; P ¼ 0.0019). Both associations map in the previously
suspected melanoma prognostic locus at 1q32. Furthermore, we
show that their combined effect on melanoma OS is substantially
enhanced reaching the level of clinical applicability (HR, 1.92;
95% CI, 1.43–2.60; P ¼ 2.38e-5).
Conclusions: Our unique approach of interrogating lym-
phocyte-specific eQTLs reveals novel and biologically relevant
immunomodulatory eQTL predictors of cutaneous melanoma
prognosis that are independent of current histopathologic
markers. The significantly enhanced combined effect of iden-
tified eQTLs suggests the personalized utilization of both SNPs
in a clinical setting, strongly indicating the promise of the
proposed design for the discovery of prognostic or risk germ-
line markers in other cancers. Clin Cancer Res; 22(13); 3268–80.

Introduction
While cutaneous melanoma represents only 4% of skin can-
cers, it accounts for about 80% of skin cancer–related deaths.
Melanoma incidence rates have been rising 1.4% on average each
year over the last 10 years, while mortality rates have remained
steadily high, in particular for advanced stages. In 2015, approx-
imately 73,870 new cases of melanoma of the skin and approx-
imately 9,940 melanoma-related deaths are estimated to occur in
the United States (1), reflecting traditionally poor disease out-
comes associated with more advanced stages; the 5-year mela-
noma survival rates for stages I–II, III, and IV are 98.3, 63.0 and
16.6%, respectively (2). The negative trends in melanoma mor-
tality are largely attributed to difficulties in clinical prognosti-
cation especially for more advanced stages, suggesting that in
addition to standard clinical predictors, there are other factors
affecting the unpredictability of melanoma outcomes. Melano-
ma is considered to be highly immunogenic with the ability to
induce an immune response that can suppress tumor growth, a
phenomenon which is believed to be governed by effector T cells.
Observed tumor immunogenicity modulates prognosis of cuta-
neous melanoma and varies greatly on the individual level (3, 4),
suggesting that different capacities of the immune system control
tumor growth (5, 6). The germline genetic factors emerge as
possible novel, personalized markers of cancer outcomes,
including melanoma (7–11), some exhibiting putative immu-
noregulatory capabilities with tumor impact and therefore repre-
senting plausible modulators of observed individual immune-
response heterogeneity (12). In general, the germline associa-
tions with clinical outcome of complex disease traits found in
small candidate studies are difficult to interpret and often need
validation in larger cohorts. In addition, despite substantial
efforts, evidence supporting the biologic relevance of associated
germline
variants
remains
elusive,

 exclusively in noncoding, often intergenic, regions. Findings
from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) estimate that
88% of disease/trait-associated germline variants are noncoding,
and 12% and 34% of them overlap with transcription factor–
binding regions and DNase I hypersensitive sites (i.e., markers of
DNA regulatory region), respectively, thus putatively impacting
gene expression in cis- or trans- configuration (13, 14). In efforts
to help interpret functional consequences of germline variation,
several recent studies have genome-wide mapped variants that
correlate with expression levels of nearby genes known as cis
expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) in several different
cell types (15–19). These large analyses generated comprehen-
sive maps of inherited genetic variation that regulate gene
expression (20, 21), thus representing plausible biologic candi-
dates for association with human traits, including common
diseases. While most eQTL studies were conducted on a relatively
small sample size, a recent study by Grundberg and colleagues
(2013) identified cis-eQTL SNPs in three selected tissues, includ-
ing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from a large pop-
ulation of 857 well-phenotyped healthy female twins of the
MuTHER (Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource) project.
Besides a large sample size which gives MuTHER resource
enough statistical power to detect genetic variants with mean-
ingful eQTL properties, the advantage of the MuTHER project's
twin design allows confirmation of identified eQTLs separately
in each twin set (18, 19).
Capitalizing on the MuTHER resources, the aim of this study
was to investigate whether biologically relevant germline poly-
morphisms that regulate expression levels of immune-relevant
genes in cells of the immune system, (e.g., LCLs) might serve as
prognostic markers of melanoma clinical outcomes. By interro-
gating 382 immunomodulatory genes against eQTL data from
MuTHER, we have evaluated 40 expression-regulating poly-
morphisms and their cumulative effects for association with
melanoma clinical outcomes in a large population sample of
1,221 patients with cutaneous melanoma.
Materials and Methods
Study population
This study comprises a total of 1,221 patients with cutaneous
melanoma (stage I to III) of self-reported European descent who
were treated at the New York University Langone Medical Center
(NYUMC). Blood samples, demographic, and clinical informa-
tion including age at diagnosis, gender, self-reported family
history of melanoma, primary tumor characteristics: anatomic
site, thickness, histologic type, 2009 AJCC stage at diagnosis,
ulceration status, as well as follow up information, were obtained
following criteria established by the Interdisciplinary Melanoma
Cooperative Group (IMCG; ref. 12, 22, 23). All patients gave
written informed consent at the time of enrollment and the study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the NYUMC.
Selection of candidate immune-relevant genes
Candidate immunomodulatory genes were selected from
exploring the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases using the following
search terms: somatic diversification of T-cell receptor genes, T-
cell receptor V(D)J recombination, cytotoxic T-cell differentiation,
T-helper cell differentiation, regulatory T-cell differentiation, T-
cell costimulation, T-cell receptor complex, T-cell receptor signal-
ing pathway, dendritic cell differentiation, cytokines-immune,
related to T-cell receptor, interleukin, cytokines-immuno, T-cell
cytokine production, negative regulation of regulatory T-cell
differentiation, regulation of T-cell cytokine production. A total
of 382 genes were selected (Supplementary Table S1).
Selection of SNPs based on MuTHER resources and genotyping
SNPs for genotyping were selected on the basis of information
from sequence-based gene expression variations in lymphoblas-
toid cell lines (LCL), obtained from the recently established
MuTHER project, which has been extensively described elsewhere
(18, 19, 24, 25). The MuTHER project generated genomic and
transcriptomic data from three disease-relevant tissues, including
LCLs (i.e., representing cells of the immune system), which were
derived from a cohort of 856 female Caucasian twins with
detailed phenotypic information from the UK Adult Twin registry
(18). For the purpose of this study, a publicly available list of top
cis-eQTLs per probe in LCLs was mined for all the probes repre-
senting our panel of 382 immunomodulatory genes (Supplemen-
tary Table S1). A total of 50 SNPs with most significant cis-eQTL
activity (ranking with P < 4.46 � 10�8) in cells of the immune
system were selected for genotyping (Supplementary Table S2).
To confirm genotype-expression associations for the selected 50
probe–SNP pairs, we obtained publicly available expression data
from the ArrayExpress (accession no. E-TABM-1140), while access
to the genotype dataset was obtained from the Department of
Twin Research (DTR), King's College London. Twins (339 twin-
pairs) from the same pair were separated into two twin sets and
independent eQTL analyses were performed for each twin set
using Spearman Rank Correlation as previously described (19).
Genotype–expression correlations were assessed in 777 partici-
pants (including 339 twin-pairs) under three genetic models of
inheritance [i.e., genotypic (three genotypes were coded 1,2,3),
dominant (genotypes were coded 1,2,2) and recessive (genotypes
were coded 1,1,2)] using Spearman rank correlation test.
For genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood
samples using a QiaAmp kit (Qiagen). All SNPs were genotyped
Translational Relevance
The discovery of personalized biomarkers of melanoma
outcomes is of imminent importance as melanoma mortality
for advanced disease is high. The germline genetic factors
emerge as promising candidates for this purpose. However,
their identification has proven difficult, mainly due to the lack
of comprehensive discovery strategies delineating their bio-
logic impact, and hence facilitating their clinical applicability.
Here we provide a novel approach for identification of bio-
logically and clinically impactful germline variants associated
with melanoma prognosis. As immunogenicity is an impor-
tant hallmark of melanoma progression, in our strategy, we
interrogated publically available resources to identify genetic
variants strongly associated with the expression of immune-
related genes and tested their effect on modulation of survival
in 1,221 patients with melanoma. We have identified novel
significant associations of gene expression correlated variants
with melanoma OS, and propose that their joint interaction
may provide a clinically relevant effect independent of the
current clinicopathologic markers.

 using MassARRAY System (Agena Bioscience Inc.) according to
the manufacturer's protocol, as described in detail elsewhere
(12, 23). Primer design was not successful for eight SNPs, due
to highly polymorphic regions around the SNPs of interest.
Expression of IL19 in CD4þ T cells from melanoma patients
Expression levels of IL19 in CD4þ T cells were assessed using
NanoString nCounter platform. CD4þ T cells were isolated from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a subset of 43 patients with
cutaneous melanoma as described previously (12), and RNA was
extracted from purified CD4þ cells using RNeasy RNA Isolation kit
(Qiagen). Probes were designed and synthesized by NanoString

for GUSB (NM_000181.1). NanoString
nCounter analysis was performed using an input of 200 ng of
total RNA from each sample and hybridization of RNA with
Nanostring probes was processed according to the manufacturer's
protocols (NanoString Technologies, Inc). The data were analyzed
using the nCounter digital analyzer software (Version 2.5.34).
Counts for target gene IL19 were subjected to a technical normal-
ization considering the counts obtained for positive control probe
sets, followed by a biologic normalization using the two house-
keeping genes (PGK1 and GUSB) included in the CodeSet.
Statistical analysis
Univariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess
associations between demographic and clinical characteristics
and overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Time for OS
and RFS was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to
the date of death (OS) and recurrence (RFS), or the date of last
follow up. In addition, for the patients with no recorded recur-
rence event, RFS was defined from date of diagnosis to the date of
death due to melanoma. The effects of individual SNPs on OS and
RFS were accessed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard
model adjusted for age at diagnosis (�60 years/>60 years), gender
(female/male), tumor stage (I/II/III), thickness (<1.0/1.0–2.0/
2.01–4.0/>4.0), ulceration (absent/present), and histologic sub-
type
(superficial-spreading/nodular/desmoplastic/acral-lentigi-
nous/lentigo-maligna/other), as described previously (12). For
each SNP, two genetic models (i.e., two genetic models that
showed
strongest
expression-genotype
correlations
in
the
MuTHER data) were applied in Cox analysis, separately. To assess
whether the observed associations are independent of clinical
variables, the SNPs surpassing the correction for multiple tests
were further analyzed using Cox models adjusted only for age and
gender. SNP–SNP interaction analysis was performed by counting
the number of putative unfavorable genotypes. To address the
issue of multiple comparisons for Cox proportional hazard mod-
els, we used Benjamini-Hochberg procedure while restricting the
false discovery rate to 0.05 (26) and assuming 80 hypotheses (40
SNPs tested under 2 genetic models of inheritance). All statistical
analysis of genotype data and survival were performed using the
"survival" package in R.
Results
Characteristics of study population
The study included 1,221 patients with stage I–III cutaneous
melanoma recruited by the IMCG at the NYUMC. All patients
were of self-reported European descent with median age of 58.1 �
16.5 years. The median time between diagnosis and follow-up
was of 52.7 months. The 5-year survival rate was 84.1% for OS and
78.6% for RFS. Demographics as well as tumor characteristics are
described in Table 1. Almost 85% of all primary diagnoses were of
stage I and II. The majority of tumors (75.4%) were less than 2.0
mm thick and 80.6% of all primary tumors were not ulcerated.
Superficial spreading melanoma was the most common histo-
logic subtype of melanoma (57.2%), followed by nodular mel-
anoma (25.6%). Using Cox regression analysis, primary tumor
stage, thickness, ulceration status, and histologic subtype were
found significantly associated with OS and RFS (all P < 2.2 �
10�16), respectively. Patients' age at diagnosis (P ¼ 5.0 � 10�8)
and family history of melanoma (P < 0.001) were significantly
associated with OS (Table 1).
Selection of immune-related gene expression quantitative trait
loci for survival analysis
Using MuTHER resources, a total of 398 probe–SNP pairs (i.e.,
eQTLs) corresponding to 268 unique immunomodulatory genes
and 385 unique SNPs were identified at the P < 0.05 significance
level (Supplementary Table S1). The top most significant 50
unique SNPs (ranking with P < 4.46 � 10�8) affected expression
levels of 54 unique expression probes, which represent 48 unique
immune-relevant genes (Supplementary Table S2). For these
eQTLs we further computed expression–genotype correlations
under three genetic models (genotypic, dominant, and recessive)
using Spearman correlation test to identify underlying mode of
inheritance of eQTL effect. Genotype–expression correlations
were strongest under genotypic and/or dominant genetic model
for most SNP (Table 2). To further confirm the genotype–expres-
sion associations for 50 eQTL SNPs, we separated twins into two
twin sets and performed separate eQTL analyses for SNP-probe
pairs of interest in each twin sets using Spearman Rank Correla-
tion as described previously (19). All examined probe-SNP pairs
were significant in both twin sets at a significance level of P < 0.05
and the direction of association with expression (i.e., negative vs.
positive) remained unchanged (Table 2). The two genetic models
that best correlated with expression were considered in down-
stream survival analysis for each eQTL.
Single-SNP analysis of the most significant 40 eQTLs in
immunomodulatory genes for their association with
melanoma outcomes
The most significant 50 eQTL SNPs were selected for genotyp-
ing in a population cohort of 1,221 patients with melanoma.
Only 40 SNPs were successfully genotyped and passed to asso-
ciation analyses; primer design was not successful for 8 SNPs
and 2 SNPs did not pass our genotyping quality control filters
(Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium P < 0.001). The associations
between each individual SNP and cutaneous melanoma clinical
outcomes of 1,221 patients with melanoma (OS and RFS) were
evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models as detailed in
Materials and Methods. The results of the single SNP analysis are
summarized in Table 3. In the RFS analysis, the most significant
association was observed for rs9921791, an eQTL controlling

 expression of MLST8 in LCLs (Fig. 1A) and ranking #16 among the
top 50 eQTLs in the study (Supplementary Table S2), where
carriers of at least one copy of minor T allele were associated
with better outcome under the dominant model (HR, 0.52; 95%
CI, 0.35–0.79; P ¼ 0.0009). While other variants show nominal
significance under different genetic models of analysis, including
rs6695772 (IL19, P ¼ 0.005), rs6695772 (BATF3, P ¼ 0.006),
rs841718 (STAT6, P ¼ 0.015), rs11539345 (CD40, P ¼ 0.016),
and rs2276645 (ZAP70, P ¼ 0.048), after adjusting for multiple
testing, none of the variants remained statistically significant in
RFS analyses.
For OS, six SNPs showed significant associations using multi-
variate analysis (Table 3). The most significant association with
OS was observed for rs6673928 [an eQTL impacting expression of
IL19 (Fig. 1B) and ranking #12 among the top 50 eQTLs in
the study (Supplementary Table S2)], under the dominant model,
in which the variant T allele was associated with improved OS
(HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41–0.77, P ¼ 0.0002). This association
remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. More-
over, comparably significant association between OS and
rs6673928 was also observed in an analysis adjusted by only
age and gender (see Materials and Methods), suggesting that
survival effect of rs6673928 is independent of other AJCC clinical
variables (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45–0.82; P ¼ 0.0008). Our second
most significant OS association, reaching the level of multiple
testing adjusted significance, was observed for rs6695772 (influ-
encing BATF3 expression levels, Fig. 1C). The carriers of the
rs6695772 minor C allele were associated with worse survival
under the dominant model (HR, 1.64; 95% CI; 1.19–2.24;
P ¼ 0.0019). Polymorphisms rs6673928 and rs6695772, both
exhibiting most significant association with OS, are located
approximately 6 Mb apart on chromosome 1q32, previously
suggested for association with melanoma outcome (12). Linkage
disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that the two SNPs are
independent (r2 ¼ 0.002; D0 ¼ 0.099), which we further con-
firmed by performing association between OS and rs6695772
using multivariate Cox regression analysis while also adjusting for
the rs6673928 variant and found no difference in effect size and
significance. Moreover, as per MuTHER data, there is no correla-
tion between rs6673928 (eQTL for IL19) and BATF3 expression
and similarly no association is observed between rs6695772
(eQTL for BATF3) and expression levels of IL19. This further
suggests that both loci represent two independent eQTL effects
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Other associations with OS, not reach-
ing the adjustments for multiple testing, were observed for
rs841718 (STAT6, Pdominant model ¼ 0.007), rs2701652 (IRAK3,
P ¼ 0.035), rs7720838 (PTGER4, Precessive model ¼ 0.037), and
rs11569345 (CD40, Pdominant model ¼ 0.040). Of note, SNPs
rs11569345 (CD40), rs6673928 (IL19), rs6695772 (BATF3), and
rs841718 (STAT6) exhibited association with both RFS and OS,
and the directionality of associations was comparable between
RFS and OS for all analyzed SNPs (Table 3).
Cumulative effect of associated eQTLs on melanoma survival
We further assessed the cumulative effect of two eQTL SNPs,
rs6673928 (IL19), and rs6695772 (BATF3) on OS, as these were

NOTE: r, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient measuring the strength of association between SNP genotypes and gene expression levels. SNP–gene expression
associations [correlation coefficient (r) and P values] were investigated among 777 healthy female twins (LCL-combined) using Spearman Rank Correlation test and
the two best fitting models of inheritance (i.e., genotypic, dominant, and recessive) were identified for each eQTL SNP (printed in bold). Genotypic effect was further
confirmed in LCL-twn1 and LCL-twn2 groups (339 twin-pairs were separated into two groups (twin set 1 and twin set 2) so that each group had one twin from each
twin pair, and independent eQTL analyses were performed for each twin set) using Spearman rank correlation test.
aGenotypic effect, genotypes were coded as 1, 2, 3.
bDominant effect, genotypes were coded as 1, 2, 2.
cRecessive effect, genotypes were coded as 1, 1, 2.
dSNPs that failed primer design.
eSNPs failed genotyping.

 the most significant associations in the single SNP analysis after
adjustment for multiple testing, and, interestingly, both variants,
albeit genetically independent (not in LD), map in the same
locus at 1q32. SNP–SNP interaction analysis was performed by
counting the number of putative, unfavorable genotypes (i.e.,
associated with worse outcome) of both SNPs and assessing their
association with OS (multivariate Cox model is presented in
Supplementary Table S3). The following genotypes were consid-
ered as unfavorable: rs6673928 (wild-type) and rs6695772 (het-
erozygotes and variant homozygotes). Comparing with the ref-
erence subjects carrying 0 or 1 unfavorable genotypes, this anal-
ysis shows that the subjects carrying 2 unfavorable genotypes
had significantly worse survival (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.43–2.60;
P ¼ 1.87 � 10�5). Five-year OS rate was 86.3% for reference
subjects, while 5-year survival rate decreased to 80.5% among
carriers of 2 unfavorable genotypes (Fig. 2).
Correlation of rs6673928 with IL19 expression CD4þ T cells
purified from melanoma patients
To further validate the genotype–expression correlation of
our most significant eQTL in melanoma survival analysis, we
tested the correlation of rs6679328 with IL19 expression in
CD4þ T cells purified from a subset of 43 patients with
melanoma from a population genotyped in this study. Follow-
ing isolation of CD4þ T cells the expression level of IL19 was
analyzed from total RNA. Expression levels of IL19 were com-
pared between GG and GT genotypes for rs667328 (no homo-
zygotes for minor T allele were observed among 43 patients).
Using Spearman correlation approach, we were able to observe
a positive association between T allele and expression level of
IL19 (Spearman coefficient r ¼ 0.32, P ¼ 0.0347; Fig. 3), further
confirming that the eQTL from UK twin studies has a true effect
on IL19 expression in an independent subset of patients with
melanoma tested in this study.
Discussion
The discovery of biologically impactful and personalized mel-
anoma prognostic markers complementing currently established,
yet clinically less specific, histopathologic indicators is one of the
key objectives of current melanoma research. Recent studies
suggest that germline genetic variants may modulate cutaneous
melanoma clinical endpoints, thereby representing potentially
personalized and easily accessible prognostic biomarkers (7–12).
However, while the majority of currently published studies on
germline associations with prognosis still require independent
validation in larger cohorts, the biologic and functional uncer-
tainty of most prognostic variants further limits their clinical
consideration. With the exception of few melanoma etiology
related SNPs [e.g., MC1R (9), vitamin D-binding protein (11)],
in general, almost exclusively, the genetic variants identified to
date for associations with melanoma risk (i.e., GWAS loci) or

 prognosis (reviewed in ref. 8), map to noncoding regions with
unknown biologic impact. In fact, from a broader point of view
the general lack of knowledge on functional consequences of
germline genetic variation associated with human diseases is
apparent and has been a major hurdle in translating these findings
into clinical practice. As such, novel strategies for the discovery of
biologically impactful germline genetic surrogates associated with
cancer risk (e.g., in GWAS data), prognosis, or therapy response
(27–29) are highly demanded not only in regard to more pre-
dictive strategies, but importantly for improved biologic under-
standing ultimately leading to more targeted treatments. Consid-
ering the fact that melanomas are highly immunogenic, the
genetic variants in immunomodulatory genes that are significant-
ly and reproducibly associated with gene expression in immune
cells as validated eQTLs may have a strong potential to serve as
clinically actionable prognostic markers.

significant for rs9921791 and rs6695772 variants, suggesting that the two SNPs are not independent from other clinical covariates. However for illustrative

 we have tested the hypothesis that the individual genetic variation
associated with the expression of immune-related genes plays a
role in modulating cutaneous melanoma outcomes, as immune
response appears to be one of the key mechanisms for controlling
melanoma progression. Our study provides a first in-depth anal-
ysis aimed at mapping the functionally important germline
variants in immunomodulatory networks as potential markers
of melanoma prognosis.
Using the unique approach of interrogating the MuTHER
eQTL data, we have identified 385 SNPs significantly associ-
ated with the expression of 268 immunoregulatory genes
(Supplementary Table S1). For the most significant 40 variants
(P < 4.46 � 10�8; Supplementary Table S2) with comparable
genotype–expression correlations in both matched healthy
female twin sets, we assessed genotype–expression correlations
under three genetic models (i.e., genotypic, dominant, or
recessive) using Spearman rank correlation test. The best two
modes of inheritance for each eQTL were examined for their
association with cutaneous melanoma clinical outcomes in
1,221 patients with melanoma. Our approach for the first time
identified several eQTL variants that were significantly associ-
ated with melanoma survival.
The most significant finding in our study is the association of
melanoma overall survival (OS) with eQTL variant rs6673928 at
1q32.1, impacting the expression of IL19 gene [linear regression
coefficient (b) ¼ 0.12, P ¼ 5.66 � 10�23]. We observed a strong
association of rs6673928 with better survival for the carriers of a
minor T allele (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41–0.77; P ¼ 0.0002), which
correlated with increased expression of IL19 in LCLs from
MuTHER dataset, and this correlation was also validated in
CD4þ T cells purified from a subset of patients with melanoma
from our study population (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this is the
first evidence suggesting that increased germline expression of
IL19 in cells of an individual's immune system associates with
better clinical outcome possibly via suppression of melanoma
progression (Fig. 1B). These findings are particularly interesting in
regards to sparse experimental data on IL19 function. While the
putative involvement of IL19 has been reported in a range of
diseases including cancer (30) or autoimmune disorders (31, 32),
in these and other studies, IL19 was shown to have both sup-
pressive and stimulatory capacities in immune regulation (33).
IL19 is a member of IL10 family of cytokines and notably, both
genes map within a relatively narrow region (�26 kb apart) at
1p.32 locus. Interestingly, eQTL data from MuTHER project show
that our most significant variant rs6673928 also associates
with expression of IL10, albeit with less significance (P < 2.5 �
10�6) compared to the effect on IL19 expression. This is interest-
ing, as we have recently identified strong association with cuta-
neous melanoma survival for a variant near IL10, rs3024493 (12).
In that recent report, we showed that the association with
improved OS is driven by rs3024493 heterozygotes, which secrete
medium levels of IL10, as compared with low-secreting minor
allele homozygotes conversely associated with worse outcome,
which is consistent with directionality of the effects for IL19 in the
current study. Other prior smaller scale studies also reported
associations at 1q32.1 with melanoma survival for a set of three
highly correlated polymorphisms in IL10 promoter: rs1800896,
rs1800871, and rs1800872 (34–37). Similarly to our observa-
tions, these studies reported that the IL10 high-level expression
genotypes are protective in cutaneous melanoma, while low-level
expression genotypes associate with poorer disease prognosis.
These consistent reports clearly suggest that the genetic variation
at 1q32 may result in specific gene-expression patterns regulating
several interleukin candidates in the locus with an impact on
melanoma clinical outcome, likely via modulation of melanoma
immune surveillance. Notably, all the variants associated with
cutaneous melanoma outcomes at 1q32.1 in the current and prior
reports are scattered in a relatively narrow region spanning �9.6
kbp, thus raising a possibility that the variants are in LD. Using the

 data from 1000 Genomes Pilot project, we found that rs1800896
(previous studies; ref. 35), rs3024493 [our recent study; ref. 12),
and rs6673928 (current study) show little to no correlation
(r2
rs1800896-rs3024493 ¼ 0.31, r2
rs1800896-rs6673928 ¼ 0.24, and
r2
rs6673928-rs3024493 ¼ 0.07), which was also confirmed in our
study population (data not shown). This indicates that the multi-
variant associations with cutaneous melanoma survival at 1q32.1
may be due to other mechanisms. As discussed in our recent report
(12), the region of 1q32.1 appears to be in an extensive tran-
scriptional "hot spot." The region of associated variants shows the
presence of several strong DNase I hypersensitive sites in T cells,
involving multiple transcription factors spread across a 30 kbp
region (Supplementary Fig. S2). It is therefore possible that
1q32.1 exerts a broader positional effect in the immune cells,
affecting the expression of several genes simultaneously in this
locus. Given the amount of published data showing significant
expression correlation of different interleukin gene targets at
1q32.1 in immune regulation (32, 38), it is likely that genes of
this locus share common gene expression–regulatory elements.
The genetic variants in these regulatory elements would then
produce specific expression signatures, impacting both physio-
logic immune response as well as disease outcome. This scenario
is supported by other intriguing findings generated in our study.
We found another variant on chromosome 1, rs6695772, which
was associated with OS. The carriers of at least one copy of the
minor C allele for rs6695772 had worse prognosis when com-
pared to wild-type GG homozygotes (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.19–
2.24; P ¼ 0.0019). The MuTHER eQTL data in LCLs associate
minor C allele of rs6695772 with decreased expression levels of
BATF3 gene (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like 3)
in a dose-dependent manner [linear regression coefficient (b) ¼
�0.16, P ¼ 6.93 � 10�10; Fig. 1C). BATF3 is a positive immune
regulator, primarily involved in stimulation of CD8aþ dendritic
cells (39). Our data appear to be consistent with these findings,
suggesting that the decreased expression of BATF3 in immune
cells predicts worse cutaneous melanoma outcome, likely due to
suppressed immune surveillance of tumor progression (Fig.
1C). Interestingly, rs6695772 maps �6 Mb downstream from
our most significantly associated variant, rs6673928, and
although not in LD (r2 ¼ 0.002), the comparably significant
association effects observed with melanoma survival and rel-
atively close proximity of both loci might suggest common
genetic or biologic underpinnings. Notably, overexpression of
BATF3 in T cells has also been shown to stimulate Th17 cell
differentiation. (40). Moreover, knocking down BATF3 in Th2
cells dramatically decreased expression of IL4 and IL10 cyto-
kines (41, 42). This is an intriguing biologic connection as both
the overexpression of IL10 and elevated levels of Th17 cells in
peripheral blood were correlated with improved cancer patient
survival in previous studies (43, 44). These findings therefore
align with our observations that minor T allele carriers of
germline eQTL rs6695772, associated with worse OS, express
low levels of BATF3, which may in turn downregulate IL4 and
IL10. In an attempt to support such a hypothesis, we analyzed
the correlation between BATF3 expression and expression
levels of IL4, IL10, IL17, and IL19, in the MuTHER data
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Although we did not note the corre-
lation of BATF3 expression with expression of IL10, nor have
we confirmed positive correlation of BATF3 with IL4, it is
possible that the expression correlation is T-helper subtype
specific. However, we noted a significant correlation between
expression of BATF3 and IL19, suggesting a possibility that
there is a novel, previously unexplored molecular interaction
of both proteins in immune surveillance of melanoma pro-
gression. Nevertheless, the biologic meaning and causality of
these associations need to be further investigated, likely using
in vivo models.
Because of functional commonalities and putative mutual
interaction between the two loci (rs6673928 and rs6695772)
most significantly associated with melanoma OS in our study,
we explored possible cumulative effects of these two variants.
We found that the joint effect of both variants on OS is substan-
tially stronger (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.43–2.60; P ¼ 1.87 � 10�5;
Fig. 2), when compared with single SNP analysis. Interestingly,
the analysis adjusted for only age and gender shows similarly
strong association effect (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.21–2.11; P ¼ 9.26 �
10�4) when compared with multivariate analysis adjusted for age,
gender, and other established clinical markers. This clearly sug-
gests that the observed joint effects are possibly independent from
histopathologic predictors. These observations for the first time
propose the germline genetic variants as independent prognostic
factors and, due to the strength of their joint interaction, the
clinically actionable personalized biomarkers of melanoma out-
comes. However, the final replication of these associations in
additional subsets of melanomas will be important to provide a
definitive verdict on their consideration for a clinically valid
prognostic test.
Significant association was also noted for rs9921791, located
nearby MLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8). The
carriers of minor T allele (associated with increased expression
of MLST8) recurred significantly later compared with patients
with CC genotypes (Fig. 1A). MLST8 is a regulator of mTOR
kinase activity (45, 46) and interestingly, mTOR signaling was
recently shown to promote T-cell development (47–49). This
suggests
that
upregulation
of
MLST8
expression
among
rs99212791-T allele carriers with cutaneous melanoma, may
stimulate immune tumoral response via mTOR pathway-medi-
ated T-cell activation, leading to suppression of cutaneous
melanoma recurrence. However, despite these encouraging
findings, exploring such hypothesis is premature pending the
association validation and more detailed investigation into the
underlying molecular role of MLST8 in melanoma clinical
outcomes.
It is important to mention that the genotype–expression
correlations tested in our study were based exclusively on the
data from female-only MuTHER cohort. Although all our
analyses were adjusted for gender, the gender-stratified tests
for our most significant associations revealed a gender-specific
effect for some variants, in particular rs6695772 (BATF3)
association with OS observed only in males. (Supplementary
Table S4). While this could likely be attributed to reduced
statistical power (the samples size in each separate gender-
stratified analysis was reduced approximately by half), it is also
possible that the gender-specific associations are due to yet-
unknown biologic underpinnings. As it is difficult to draw
reliable conclusions at this stage, to confirm their potential
biologic meaning, the gender-specific testing of rs6695772
(BATF3) in a larger melanoma population will be needed in
subsequent efforts.
As our current report is hypothesis driven and focuses on cis-
eQTL associations in relatively narrow selection of immune
genes due to their biologically plausible role in melanoma, we

 did not assess trans-acting genotype–expression correlations on
the genome-wide scale that may also be important. While this
may be a potential limitation in our design, the recent MuTHER
study on mapping trans-eQTLs has concluded that direct cis
effects on local genes are stronger than indirect trans effects
(21). Moreover, in that recent report, only a handful of trans
effects at a 5% false discovery rate have been identified on
genome-wide scale. This is likely attributed to the power
limitations of available eQTL resources, as the interrogation
of trans-acting genotype correlations involves much larger
number of tests resulting in more rigorous control for false
discovery rate. However, it is estimated that 65% of gene
expression heritability is trans-regulated and about 52% of
cis-eQTLs also have trans-acting effect (21), strongly suggesting
importance of inherited trans-eQTLs as potentially important
prognostic biomarkers. Therefore, with the expansion of eQTL
resources, as part of ongoing and future efforts, the compre-
hensive assessment of trans-eQTLs, using the similar approach
applied in our study, will become feasible for the identification
of novel clinically relevant outcome modulators of melanoma
and other cancers.
In conclusion, our unique approach of interrogating lym-
phocyte-specific eQTLs from healthy twins was notably pow-
erful in identifying several immunomodulatory eQTLs, and
indirectly, their gene targets, including IL19 and BATF3 at
1q32, as novel biologically relevant predictors of cutaneous
melanoma prognosis. In addition, the substantially enhanced
cumulative effect of these associations strongly encourages the
consideration of joint screening of these variants in a prognos-
tic clinically relevant test in the near future. Our study suggests
that the eQTL-based strategy proposed here will be highly
efficient in discovering novel molecular markers of outcome,
risk, or therapy response in other human cancers driven by
specific molecular pathways.
