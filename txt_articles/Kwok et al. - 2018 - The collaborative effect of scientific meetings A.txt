Abstract
Collaboration among scientists has a major influence on scientific progress. Such collabora-
tion often results from scientific meetings, where scientists gather to present and discuss
their research and to meet potential collaborators. However, most scientific meetings have
inherent biases, such as the availability of research funding or the selection bias of profes-
sional societies that make it difficult to study the effect of the meeting per se on scientific pro-
ductivity. To evaluate the effects of scientific meetings on collaboration and progress
independent of these biases, we conducted a study of the annual symposia held by the
International Milk Genomics Consortium (IMGC) over a 12-year period. In our study, we
conducted permutation testing to analyze the effectiveness of the IMGC in facilitating collab-
oration and productivity in a community of milk scientists who were meeting attendees rela-
tive to non-attendees. Using the number of co-authorships on published papers as a
measure of collaboration, our analysis revealed that scientists who attended the symposium
were associated with more collaboration than were scientists who did not attend. Further-
more, we evaluated the scientific progress of consortium attendees by analyzing publication
rate and article impact. We found that IMGC attendees, in addition to being more collabora-
tive, were also more productive and influential than were non-attendees who published in
the same field. The results of our study suggest that the annual symposium encouraged
interactions among disparate scientists and increased research productivity, exemplifying
the positive effect of scientific meetings on both collaboration and progress.
Introduction
The complexity of scientific problems, especially in the life sciences, often requires multidisci-
plinary expertise within structures based on teams of researchers. Besides access to expertise,

Interested researchers should contact the
 scientists also collaborate to improve access to funds and resources, to advance professionally,
to improve efficiency and make more rapid progress, to enhance their ability to tackle bigger
problems, and to boost productivity [1]. Evidence documents that research teams now pro-
duce more publications than solo authors and these team papers also have higher impact, sug-
gesting that the pattern of knowledge creation has fundamentally changed in the latter part of
the 20th century [2]. Furthermore, the emergence of such highly collaborative work has
prompted researchers to conduct studies on the mechanisms of scientific collaboration [3].
These studies, including those that analyze records from as far back as 1900 [4], reveal that
more collaboration often results in the publication of higher impact articles [5]. Such studies
could eventually help inform organizational decisions that could facilitate collaboration across
disciplines [6], institutions [7], or countries [8].
In certain research areas defined by modern enabling technologies, such as genome science
and genetics, the traditional size of groups typically required to produce a single research arti-
cle has evolved into much larger teams, or consortia. A simple search for the word “consor-
tium” in the PubMed database [9], which is a database of biomedical literature, reveals tens of
hits in the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of annual hits in the 1990s and early 2000s, and thou-
sands of hits beginning in 2008 with over 5000 hits in 2016. A review of the earliest hits of the
word “consortium” in the PubMed database suggests that consortia at that time were mainly
for the purposes of health education or delivery of health services. With the arrival of the Inter-
national Human Genome Sequencing Consortium [10], which produced the first human
genome, and the International HapMap Consortium [11], which published the major human
haplotypes, and newly assembled genetic tools, these health delivery-driven consortia were
naturally extended to include genetics studies. The sequencing and assembly of the first mam-
malian genomes required consortia because of the sheer workload. Similarly, the consortium-
style science for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is largely driven by the need to
include more study subjects for greater power to detect significant genetic variants. Indeed,
the need to include more and more study subjects is driving new models of collaboration, such
as the UK10K Project Consortium, in which the genetic code of 10,000 people with pre-exist-
ing phenotype information is being finely mapped and linked to disease risk [12].
In contrast, consortium science is less common among agricultural scientists, with the
exception of the genome projects of agriculturally important species. The word “consortium”
in the CAB abstracts database [13], which is a database of agricultural literature, has ten times
fewer hits in 2016 than the PubMed database of biomedical literature, even though some of
these hits are overlaps with those indexed in PubMed. Additionally, many of the non-overlap-
ping hits are for microbial consortia rather than consortia of scientists.
It was within this context of limited consortium science in agricultural spheres that the
International Milk Genomics Consortium (IMGC) was founded in 2004. The IMGC is spon-
sored by industry members and dairy organizations around the world, and their collective
funds are managed on behalf of the sponsors by the California Dairy Research Foundation.
However, there have been no funds within the consortium apart from those supporting the
symposia. The IMGC was founded to avoid the bias of research support in part because of the
potential influence of industrial funding on the scientific agenda. The stated mission of the
IMGC is “to provide a collaborative, interactive and pre-competitive platform for scientific
community and industry to accelerate the understanding of the biological processes underly-
ing mammalian milk genomics and facilitate the transition of that knowledge into usable com-
mercial benefits for industry.” In short, the IMGC was assembled to facilitate collaboration
among milk scientists. Besides providing a symposium for scientists working on bovine milk
genomics and genetics, the IMGC also intended to foster collaborations among scientists
working in different fields, and between academia and industry.

Funding: This study was funded in part by the
California Dairy Research Foundation and U.S.
Department of Agriculture project 2032-53000-
001-00-D. The United States Department of
Agriculture is an equal opportunity provider and
employer. The California Dairy Research
Foundation (CDRF) is a non-profit public research
management organization. CDRF provided partial
funding for the study and its Executive Director
(Gonca Pasin) participated in the drafting of the
manuscript to provide historical context for the
IMGC, which is managed by CDRF. No funding
organization played a role in the study design, data
analysis, or interpretation of the results.
Competing interests: DGL and JBG have received
travel expenses for attendance to the annual IMGC
meeting. Prior to her death, GP was the Executive
Director of the California Dairy Research
Foundation, a non-profit public research
management organization. This does not alter our
adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data
and materials. The authors have no other
competing interests.
 Evaluation of the relative success of cross-disciplinary collaborations among scientists is of
scholarly interest and yet it is virtually impossible to isolate collaboration from the evident bias
of funding due to the nature of societal organizations that explicitly fund research within their
members. Relatively few consortia exist that are independent of that bias. Consortia for the
sequencing and analysis of animal or plant genomes are explicitly funded for that scientific
project. For example, the International Lettuce Genomics Consortium is funded to sequence,
assemble, and annotate the reference genomes of two wild lettuce species. In contrast, the
IMGC has not funded scientific research. This makes the IMGC a unique case study to investi-
gate the advantages of scientific meetings independent of scientific funding.
Many factors have been studied to determine whether they influence scientific productivity.
These factors include demographics (age, gender, race), family-related factors (marital status,
children), human capital (PhD program, dissertation subfield), opportunity costs (teaching
and committee service), working environment, and professional variables (e.g. frequency of
conference presentation) (reviewed in Hesli and Lee [14], Table 1). Hesli and Lee evaluated the
effects of these variables on the number of published articles using a multivariate analysis of
results from survey respondents of the American Political Science Association in 2009 [14].
Frequency of conference attendance was a significant positive predictor of publication output,
but not as strong of a predictor as other factors such as gender, faculty rank, and PhD program.
Other studies point to an effect of conference attendance on publication output. In an analysis
of faculty publication patterns in ten different countries, membership in professional associa-
tions or attendance at their annual meetings was an important predictor of article productivity
in all ten academic systems [15]. In a study of approximately half of the population of young
scientists in Croatia, the most significant predictor of the total number of publications was
most strongly determined by one factor: attendance at international scientific conferences
abroad [16]. Barnes and Beaulieu [17] evaluated the effect of a National Science Foundation-
funded annual conference in political methodology for women on the productivity and found
that women who attended the conference had higher average journal article submissions per
year than women who did not. Kyvik and Larsen [18] studied the effect of conference atten-
dance on research performance of researchers from small countries: in all fields of learning,
they found that those who were invited to present a paper by conference organizers were the
most productive, followed by those who presented a paper without invitation followed by
those who attended without presenting.
In many studies of the effect of conferences on researcher productivity, there is a natural
selection bias in favor of high-producing researchers. Compared with other scientific meet-
ings, there are unusual characteristics of the annual IMGC symposium that make it a unique
case study to understand the impact of scientific meetings on the careers of individual scien-
tists. Unlike professional societies, there is no membership application for the IMGC that

 would exclude attendees who are not yet established in the field. There are no professional
requirements to attend the conference or to submit an abstract. The requirements for poster
presentation are minimal; they are reviewed for scientific quality, but rejection of poster
abstracts is extremely rare. There is no requirement that the attendees have any track record
at all in the field, nor that they even be scientists. Indeed, some attendees are dairy farmers or
non-publishing industry representatives. There are also no dues, which can be a financial
barrier. At the annual meeting, there is no requirement that the work to be presented has
been already been published, nor is there a requirement that it is not yet published. There is
no funding for any particular research project to be conducted by the IMGC. The annual
symposium is a small meeting (approx. 70–120 attendees) designed to increase networking
opportunities and to bring in new attendees (approx. 40 each year). It is also an international
conference with strong attendance from Europe, North America, and Australia/New Zea-
land, and alternating locations on a different continent each year. It is truly designed as a net-
working event, but without the gatekeeping of professional societies. Together, these
characteristics reduce the selection bias that would be true of scientific meetings that are part
of professional societies or funded projects, and it provides a unique case study to evaluate
the impact of meetings on both the group as a whole and on the careers of individual
scientists.
In the current study, we sought to evaluate whether the IMGC—a consortium not tied to
research funds or to a professional scientific society—was successful at facilitating collabora-
tion. To determine the progress of the IMGC towards scientific collaboration, we evaluated
collaboration metrics derived from publication records, such as the number of co-authorships
and the rate of publication, among attendees of the annual symposium. The uses of publication
records to study scientific productivity is well-established [19], as are the use of co-authorship
as a measure of scientific collaboration [20] and the use of publication rate as a quantification
of research progress [21]. Bibliometrics—statistical analyses of publication records—can be
potentially used to evaluate individual scientists [22], teams [23], or an entire field of study
[24]. It could be expected that any randomly selected group of scientists in the same field of
study have co-authored publications. Therefore, we evaluated the incremental impact of the
IMGC on the collaboration of its attendees by comparison with other same-size groups of sci-
entists in the same field. Specifically, we used scientific publication records to calculate impact
metrics among IMGC attendees compared with null distributions formed by randomly
selected same-size subsets of scientists in the same field who were not associated with the
IMGC. Finally, to determine the impact of the consortium on the careers of individual scien-
tists, we evaluated their publication histories before and after symposium attendance. In this
manuscript, we determine the impact of the IMGC at the levels of both the consortium and
the individual scientists.

Data sets
IMGC attendee data set. Lists of the full names of attendees at the annual IMGC sympo-
sium were obtained for each year from 2004 through 2015 from the consortium’s event man-
ager with the permission of California Dairy Research Foundation, which manages the IMGC.
The IMGC Attendee Data Set is available to other researchers through the IMGC Data Access
Committee (see Data Availability Statement).
Papers published by IMGC attendees.
To obtain the papers published by IMGC attend-
ees, the Web of Science Core Collection [25] was queried with the Topic field equal to “milk”
OR “lactation” and the Author field populated with the names of the IMGC attendees. In

 addition, the timespan was set to 2004–2015, and all citation indexes were checked except for
the Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities Citation Indexes. This query yielded a total of 7,322
results. An in-house Python script was used to generate text files containing the number of col-
laborations (defined as the number of times an IMGC attendee appeared on the same paper as
another IMGC attendee) and the total number of papers published in the years 2004–2015.
The papers included in these files were written by authors who had attended the IMGC sym-
posium in the year of publication or in one of the preceding years.
Papers published by all milk scientists.
To obtain the papers published by all milk scien-
tists, the same search was done in Web of Science [25], except that the author field was left
blank. This search generated all the papers on “milk” OR “lactation” published in the timespan
2004–2015. This query yielded 98,649 papers.
Data analysis
Metrics.
Using publication records, three metrics of interest were calculated: number of
papers published, number of collaborators, and article efficiency. The number of collaborators
was determined by co-authorships on publications; each co-author was considered to be a col-
laborator. The article efficiency is a normalized metric that takes into account the number of
citations an article had received as well as its duration in the literature. Given that a paper pub-
lished many years ago was more likely to be cited than a paper published recently, the normali-
zation is accomplished by dividing the number of citations an article received by the number
of years it was available in the literature [26]:
article efficiency ¼
number of citations
2016 � publication year
Evaluation of metrics.
Metrics were evaluated by permutation testing. A permutation test
is a statistical test in which the distribution of the test statistic (e.g. metric) under the null
hypothesis is obtained by calculating all possible values of the test statistic when the labels asso-
ciated with the observed data points are randomized. For both consortia level and individual
scientist analyses, p-values were calculated as follows:
p � value ¼ number of random samples with a larger metric value than the observed value
total number of random samples
Evaluation of metrics at consortium level.
To determine whether a metric, such as the
number of co-authorships, was higher for IMGC attendees than for non-IMGC attendees, the
metric was evaluated for both the IMGC attendee population (n = 606) and for random per-
mutations of scientists who had published studies on “milk” OR “lactation” in the timespan
2004–2015 but who had not attended the IMGC (n = 157,275). For each hypothesis, the null
distribution was determined, using in-house Python scripts, based on 20,000 random selec-
tions of 606 scientists from among non-IMGC scientists. Note that all IMGC attendees were
included in this analysis, even if they had never published a manuscript, whereas the pool of
controls (non-IMGC scientists) had published at least one manuscript, biasing the analysis in
favor of the null hypothesis.
Evaluation of metrics at scientist level.
To determine the effect that the IMGC sympo-
sium had on individual scientists, an analysis was conducted to compare the three metrics of
interest before and after the scientists’ first symposium attendance. For this analysis, the sym-
posium’s effect was quantified through differences in metrics, subtracting the value before first

 attendance from the value after first attendance:
Difference in Number of Publications
¼ Number of Publications After First Attendance� Number of Publications Before First Attendance
Difference in Number of Collaborators
¼ Number of Collaborators After First Attendance� Number of Collaborators Before First Attendance
Difference in Average Article Efficiency
¼ Average Article Efficiency After First Attendance� Average Article Efficiency Before First Attendance
Citations and collaborations increase with time. We therefore established timeframes for
each scientist to specify the number of years to take into account before and after first confer-
ence attendance. These timeframes were established so that the number of years before first
attendance equaled the number of years after first attendance, with a maximum timeframe of 5
years before and after (10 years in total). Where the timeframe could not be 5 years, the time-
frame was reduced to the maximum possible number of years. For example, the timeframe for
first year attendance of 2013 would be reduced to 2 years, since 2015 was the last year taken
into account for this analysis. Attendees who had published one or more papers (n = 311) at
any time during the years of study (2004–2015) were included in this analysis.
Experiments were repeated with a different set of controls, this time balanced for publica-
tion history. After calculating the three differences for the IMGC scientists, the same calcula-
tion was done for 20,000 random samples of non-IMGC scientists with similar publication
history. Each sample was the same size as the cohort of IMGC scientists. The samples of non-
IMGC scientists were created by looping through the IMGC scientists, and randomly selecting
a non-IMGC scientist who had the same number of publications as the IMGC scientist in the
year of first symposium attendance. Again, IMGC attendees who had not published a paper at
any time during the study period (2004–2015) were excluded from the analysis to ensure bal-
anced controls.
Software used. Permutation analyses and statistics were conducted using Python code.
Distributions of metrics were graphed using R [27], with vertical red lines drawn at the
observed value for the IMGC scientists. Networks were visualized and statistics (e.g. diameter)
computed using Cytoscape [28].
Results
Descriptive analyses
In a social network context, a “node-link” diagram is a type of visualization that captures peo-
ple as nodes and their relationships as links. A node is represented as a circle or square and the
links are represented as lines between the nodes. To determine how the social network of the
IMGC changed over the years, attendance records from the annual IMGC symposium were
combined with publication records from the Web of Science (see Materials and methods).
Each attendee became a node in the network; nodes were linked if two attendees had previ-
ously co-authored a publication in milk or lactation science. The networks for the first 12
years of the IMGC annual symposia show that the size of the social networks of IMGC attend-
ees dramatically increased since inception (Fig 1). Between 2005 and 2009, several separate
networks formed within the IMGC, largely by geographical distance with each network con-
sisting mainly of scientists from a single country (data not shown). By 2010, co-authorship fre-
quently crossed international boundaries as evidenced by the consortium’s social network

 turning into a single large network (Fig 1). Since 2010, the consortium’s large single network
continued to expand in size with increasing network diameter from 6 to 8. In summary, the
size of the IMGC’s social network clearly increased over time.
Another way to analyze the same data is to compute the change in co-publication rate
among IMGC attendees over time (Fig 2). In 2004, the average IMGC symposium attendee co-
published with 0.16 other attendees (Fig 2A). By 2012, the average IMGC symposium attendee
co-published with 4 other attendees (Fig 2A). To determine whether the average was being
driven by a few highly collaborative attendees, the number of attendees who had co-published
with other attendees was computed (Fig 2B). In 2004, only 4 attendees had co-published with
other attendees. By 2015, nearly 300 attendees had co-published with other attendees (Fig 2B).
This suggests that the IMGC’s social network increased via the collective collaboration of
many attendees rather than being driven by very few highly productive people.
Impact of the IMGC at the consortium level
To evaluate the impact of the IMGC at the consortium level, analyses were conducted to deter-
mine whether or not the IMGC had a significant effect on the amount of collaboration among
milk scientists, the productivity of those scientists, and the impact of their papers. The amount
of collaboration was measured as a count of co-authorship occurrences in a group of scientists.
Scientific productivity was measured as the number of papers published by a group of scien-
tists. The impact of those papers was measured using “article efficiency,” which is a function of
both the number of citations the paper has received and how long ago it was published (see
Materials and methods). Counts of co-authorships, number of papers published, and article
efficiency were each evaluated for the IMGC attendees and random permutations of non-
IMGC attendees (see Materials and methods). IMGC attendees had a higher number of co-
authorships than expected by chance (p = 0) with 3,266 co-authorships compared with a
median of just 45 co-authorships among the same number of randomly sampled non-IMGC
attendees (Fig 3). In terms of the total count of published papers, IMGC attendees also pub-
lished more papers than expected by chance (p = 0); IMGC attendees published 5,523 papers,
compared with an average of 2,770 papers published by the same number of randomly sam-
pled non-IMGC attendees (Fig 4). IMGC attendees had an article efficiency of 2.50, which is
higher than the average of 2.26 expected by chance (p = 0.0285, Fig 5). By the measures of the
number of published papers, the occurrence of co-authorships on papers, and the impact of
those papers, the consortium of IMGC attendees far exceeded what would be expected of a
similar number of milk scientists who were not members of the consortium. Thus, the IMGC
symposium was associated with increased collaboration, publication output, and article
impact.
Impact of the IMGC at the scientist level
Having found that the IMGC had a positive effect at the level of the consortium, we next inves-
tigated whether or not the IMGC symposium has helped its attendees meet new collaborators,
increase their productivity in publishing articles (measured by rate of publication), and
increase their articles’ impact (measured by article efficiency). In-house Python scripts were
written to determine the number of IMGC collaborators each author had before and after
their first attendance, the authors’ rates of publication (number of publications per year)
before and after their first attendance, and the authors’ article efficiencies before and after their
first attendance.
A total of 606 people attended the IMGC symposium in the timespan 2004–2015. Of those
people, 311 published at least one paper on milk or lactation at some point during the study

 period of 2004–2015 and were included in scientist-level analyses. For the 311 attendees who
published papers on milk or lactation, we evaluated whether or not they had increased their
number of collaborators, their rates of publication, and their article efficiencies after attending
the conference. The mean, median, and standard deviation of the three measures are shown in
Table 1. After attending their first IMGC symposium, 200 of the 311 authors (64.3%) had
more collaborators, as measured by co-authorships. Higher publication rates were achieved by
276 of the 311 authors (88.7%) after their first IMGC conference. Of the 311 authors, 231
(74.3%) had higher article efficiencies after attending their first IMGC symposium. On aver-
age, these attendees increased their number of collaborators, their rates of publication, and
their article efficiencies after attending their first IMGC symposium. Figs 6A, 7A and 8A,
respectively, include violin plots that depict the distributions of the number of collaborators,
the distributions of the rates of publication, and the distributions of the article efficiencies,
respectively. All three plots show that each measure increased on average after the scientists
attended their first IMGC symposium.
It is possible that increases in collaborators, productivity, and article impact are merely due
to maturity of the scientist that would naturally increase with the passage of time. We therefore

 compared the observed values of metrics calculated for IMGC attendees with distributions
derived from permutation analyses of metrics calculated for non-IMGC scientists with similar
publication histories who were in the same field of study. Comparison of the IMGC members
with their matched controls suggests that conference attendance did significantly increase col-
laboration, productivity and article impact (p = 0.045, p = 0, and p = 0, respectively; Figs 6B, 7B
and 8B, respectively.). Therefore, we can infer that the IMGC has helped its attendees meet
new collaborators, increase their productivity in publishing articles, and increase their articles’
impact.
Discussion
Since inception, the social network of the IMGC has clearly expanded with smaller groups
merging to form larger groups. Milojević [29] posited that the evolution of the sizes of scien-
tific teams happens in two stages. In the first stage, small core teams are formed, likely repre-
senting the number of scientists needed to produce a research article. In the second stage,
teams expand in size, presumably to conduct research that requires expertise or resources out-
side of the reach of the core team. Our data supports Milojević’s observations in that the

 consortium’s social network was initially comprised of small single groups that eventually
merged to form a single very large network.
When IMGC symposia attendees were compared with randomly selected scientists in the
same field, the impact of the symposia at both the level of the consortium and at the level of the
individual scientist was statistically significant for all measures. This suggests that the IMGC
has been a successful consortium, despite having a loosely stated mission that is neither
directly funded nor mandated in the form of specific publication goals. The mere act of attend-
ing an annual scientific meeting in which ongoing research is explained to scientists in other
disciplines and to industry is impactful on its own.
The results also suggest that the symposia are beneficial to both the consortium as a whole
and to individual attendees. The consortium-level metrics yielded higher co-authorships,
higher publication rates, and higher article impact for attendees compared with non-attendees.
These metrics—co-authorships, publication rates, and article impact—improved for individual
scientists after attendance at their first symposium as well. This observation suggests that the
consortium is not merely collecting productive people, but that symposium attendance may
also help attendees be more productive.

 There are several limitations to the study. First, co-authorship is an imperfect measure of col-
laboration because some forms of collaboration will not generate co-authored articles [30]
whereas there are other collaborations in which very peripheral or indirect forms of interaction
between scientists yield co-authored publications [31]. Second, article efficiency may not be the
most accurate way of representing article impact. In the economics field, at least half of the cita-
tions are received within 5 years of the publication date [32]. If this fact holds true for the field of
milk science, then the article efficiency measure would be too low for very old articles. We
attempted to ameliorate this problem in the analyses of individual scientists by limiting the time-
frame of publications to 5 years before and after the first year of consortium meeting attendance.
Third, one must consider that it possible in this type of study that there are unknown confound-
ers and heterogeneity of which we are unaware and therefore not controlled. Using a multivari-
ate analysis of results from survey respondents of the American Political Science Association in
2009, Hesli and Lee [14] identified other factors, such as gender, faculty rank, and PhD program
that impacted productivity among political science faculty. Such metadata are not available as
part of this data set so the effect of these covariates remains unknown. Fourth, it is impossible to
know whether there is truly an effect of the meeting or whether the highly productive scientists
are attracted to the meeting. However, this selection bias is somewhat mitigated by matching
controls by publication history. Finally, collaboration networks are known to be highly clustered,
such that two scientists are much more likely to have collaborated if they have a third common
collaborator than are two scientists chosen randomly from the community [33]. Therefore, it is
possible that symposia attendees are more likely to co-attend due to pre-existing collaboration
than are randomly chosen scientists from the same field. On the other hand, the analyses were
biased against the IMGC in that the random selection of individuals only included subjects who
have published, whereas the attendee list for the consortium-wide analyses included new scien-
tists and industry members who had never published a paper in the field of study.
Another possible explanation for the relative success of symposia attendees is that they
somehow have more research opportunities than other milk scientists due to the nature of
their subfield in genetics and/or genomics. To explore the possibility that genome-related
research in milk science might have had more research opportunities, we inspected the distri-
bution of milk-related papers published in the “genetics and/or genomics” area vs. other
papers among both IMGC attendees and non-attendees (S1 and S2 Files). Surprisingly, there
are far more non-genetics/non-genomics papers published by IMGC attendees than in the
genetics/genomics area (Figures A and B in S1 File). This same difference between non-genet-
ics/non-genomics papers and genetics/genomics papers is true of non-IMGC attendees (Fig-
ures C and D in S1 File). Per scientist, the difference in publication rates between attendees
and other milk scientists appear to be similar whether the papers are genetics/genomics (Fig-
ures A and C in S2 File) or other papers (Figures B and D in S2 File). In fact, over the time
period of study, the difference between the two groups of scientists is more pronounced
among non-genetics/non-genomics papers. Therefore, the higher publication rates of the sym-
posia attendees are unlikely to be due to increased research opportunities in their subfield.
An alternate explanation for the relative success of the symposia attendees is that they may
be more likely, than other scientists, to have an ongoing research project that produces papers
in future years. Many scientific conferences do require that the project being presented has not
yet been published and therefore selection of conference attendees from such conferences
would introduce a bias. However, the attendees at the IMGC meetings are not required to
present pre-publication research. Additionally, attendees are not required to present any proj-
ect and many do not. For consortium-level analyses, the observed metrics are based on all
attendees, regardless of whether or not they are publishing scientists (e.g. some attendees are
farmers or non-scientists industry members) whereas the null distribution is based only on

 publishing scientists, biasing the analysis in favor of the null hypothesis that the meeting has
no effect. Despite the fact that the consortium-level analysis includes non-scientist attendees of
the IMGC meeting, the meeting still appears to have an effect on scientific productivity.
One aspect of healthy team building is the ability to include both newcomers and incum-
bents [34]. Each year, as many as 40–50% of the IMGC attendees are newcomers to the sympo-
sium. Although we do not know the optimal newcomer rate, it could be surmised, based on
the network analysis and publication statistics, that this surprisingly high newcomer ratio is
both sustainable and beneficial.
Individuals cannot effectively conduct modern science alone. Scientific meetings enable the
sharing of ideas across domains, solving old problems and inspiring creativity. The annual
IMGC symposium clearly improved connectivity among scientists in the field, as evidenced by
publication records. Previous models of the self-assembly of creative teams have shown that
the emergence of such a large connected community marks a phase transition [34]. The IMGC
achieved this phase transition within five years of inception and maintained it to the present
day, apparently benefiting both the consortium sponsors as a whole as well as attendees.
Our method of utilizing publication records for conducting network analyses could be gen-
eralized to study the collaborative effects of other scientific organizations. In particular, publi-
cation records can be used to quantify collaboration and productivity among scientists,
regardless of the field of study. By harnessing data generated from publication records, demon-
strated that the symposia helped bring together milk scientists internationally to form a collab-
orative scientific community. A barrier to studying scientific consortia more generally has
been access to data sets because scientific meeting rosters are not public. In making the IMGC
Attendee Data Set available to other researchers, it should be possible in the future to extend
the results of our study to determine whether the experiences of this consortium are more gen-
erally applicable to other scientific meetings.
