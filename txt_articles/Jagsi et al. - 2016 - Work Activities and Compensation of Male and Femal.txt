Abstract
 BACKGROUND—Much remains unknown about experiences, including working activities 
and pay, of women in cardiology, which is a predominantly male specialty.
 OBJECTIVES—The goal of this study was to describe the working activities and pay of 
female cardiologists compared with their male colleagues and to determine whether sex 
differences in compensation exist after accounting for differences in work activities and other 
characteristics.
 METHODS—The personal, job, and practice characteristics of a national sample of practicing 
cardiologists were described according to sex. We applied the Peters-Belson technique and 
multivariate regression analysis to evaluate whether gender differences in compensation existed 
after accounting for differences in other measured characteristics. The study used 2013 data 
reported by practice administrators to MedAxiom, a subscription-based service provider to 
cardiology practices. Data regarding cardiologists from 161 U.S. practices were included, and the 
study sample included 2,679 subjects (229 women and 2,450 men).
 RESULTS—Women were more likely to be specialized in general/noninvasive cardiology 
(53.1% vs. 28.2%), and a lower proportion (11.4% vs. 39.3%) reported an interventional 
subspecialty compared with men. Job characteristics that differed according to sex included the 
proportion working full-time (79.9% vs. 90.9%; p < 0.001), the mean number of half-days worked 
(387 vs. 406 days; p = 0.001), and mean work relative value units generated (7,404 vs. 9,497; p 
<0.001) for women and men, respectively. Peters-Belson analysis revealed that based on measured

 job and productivity characteristics, the women in this sample would have been expected to have a 
mean salary that was $31,749 (95% confidence interval: $16,303 to $48,028) higher than that 
actually observed. Multivariate analysis confirmed the direction and magnitude of the independent 
association between sex and salary.
 CONCLUSIONS—Men and women practicing cardiology in this national sample had different 
job activities and salaries. Substantial sex-based salary differences existed even after adjusting for 
measures of personal, job, and practice characteristics.

Women have constituted nearly one-half of the medical student body in the United States for 
more than a decade. Nevertheless, women continue to be dramatically underrepresented in 
the specialty of cardiology, accounting for only 21% of first-year cardiology fellows training 
in 2012 to 2013 (1). This situation has fostered concerns in the United States (2) and abroad 
(3–6) that cardiology may no longer be accessing the full pool of talent in the educational 
pipeline, potentially jeopardizing the ability of the field to continue generating the highest 
quality clinical care, teaching, and research.
The lack of sex diversity in the cardiology workforce is striking, with recent workforce 
estimates suggesting that women constitute only approximately 12% of general cardiologists 
and even smaller proportions of specialties, such as interventional cardiology and clinical 
cardiac electrophysiology (7). Both the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the 
British Cardiac Society have convened working groups charged with addressing women’s 
persistent underrepresentation in the field of cardiology (4,8). These groups have identified 
several consistent concerns, including the challenges of work–life balance in a field in which 
on-call duties can be frequent and demanding, and occupational radiation exposure, sex bias, 
and overt discrimination exist. They have called for increased mentorship and exposure to 
female role models, along with efforts to address the “image issues for the prior traditionally 
male domain of cardiology” (2).
Despite these and other laudable efforts to increase the representation of women in the 
specialty, much remains unknown about the experiences of those women who have slowly 
begun to join this previously male-dominated specialty. Professional life surveys conducted 
in 1996 and 2006 by the ACC have suggested that women in cardiology are less likely to be 
married or have children than their male colleagues (9,10), less likely to practice 
interventional cardiology, less likely to perceive career advancement and/or salaries to be 
higher than their peers, and less satisfied with their level of financial compensation. 
Although illuminating, these surveys collected little information about the detailed work 
activities or actual pay of practicing cardiologists.
Thus, little is currently known about the distribution of working activities or pay of either 
male or female practicing cardiologists. To provide this information, we used a large 
national dataset to evaluate job descriptions and to compare compensation in men and 
women after controlling for differences in work activities.

  METHODS
 SAMPLE
An original dataset was obtained from MedAxiom, a membership network and service 
provider for cardiology practices, hospitals, and academic centers. This dataset, which 
represented the entire calendar year of 2013, contained data voluntarily reported by member 
executives regarding the personal, job, and practice characteristics of 3,187 cardiologists 
from 161 practices. Subjects were excluded if they were missing values for either sex (n = 
37) or salary (n = 287) because those were the 2 primary variables of interest in this analysis. 
In addition, subjects were excluded if they worked <40 half-days (n = 12), reported <500 
work relative value units (wRVUs), or had >25,000 wRVUs (n = 172). In the United States, 
wRVUs are allocated based on billing claims codes submitted for reimbursement and are 
therefore a productivity measure linked to clinical reimbursement. The final analytic sample 
included data for 2,679 cardiologists. A diagram depicting these exclusions can be found in 
Figure 1.
 MEASURES
Key measures included personal, job, and practice characteristics reported in the surveys. 
Specifically, age was categorized into 5 groups (24 to 38, 39 to 48, 49 to 58, 59 to 68, and 
≥69 years). Race/ethnicity was grouped into 8 categories as listed in Table 1. Subspecialty 
was grouped as electrophysiology, general/noninvasive, interventional, invasive, or other.
Job characteristics included whether the subject was working full-time. Two definitions of 
full-time work were included: “self-reported,” which corresponded to the designation 
reported by the administrator completing the survey, and “investigator-defined,” which 
corresponded to a response of working >400 half-days in the last year. We also considered 
the number of half-days worked and whether the respondent participated in on-call duties 
(full call, partial call, or no call). The number of wRVUs and new patient office visits were 
also measured. In addition, we evaluated whether the respondent’s job included certain 
activities: office consultations, return office visits, hospital consultations, initial hospital 
care, hospital observation cases, hospital visits, outpatient pacemaker checks, permanent 
pacemaker implantations, catheterizations, angioplasty, echocardiograms, 
electrocardiograms, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, single-photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT) scans, stress echocardiograms, and treadmill tests. For these 
items, we first evaluated whether the subject performed any, 1 to 4, or ≥5 procedures in each 
category in the last year and then, among those performing ≥5 procedures, the absolute 
number of such procedures.
Information was collected on practice characteristics, including geographic region (grouped 
as Midwest, Northeast, South, and West), practice composition (cardiology only, cardiology 
and cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology and multiple surgeries, or cardiology and vascular 
surgery), whether the practice had a female administrative director, practice size, the practice 
compensation model (blended, equal share, productivity, or salary plus bonus), whether the 
practice owned imaging facilities (none, SPECT only, or SPECT and PET), provider-based 
billing details (diagnostic only, diagnostic plus evaluation and management services,

 evaluation and management only, or no provider-based billing), and whether the practice 
owned various clinical laboratories (catheterization, computed tomography [CT] scans, 
magnetic resonance, or sleep laboratories).
Finally, information was collected on salary for each physician in the practice, as reported to 
Med-Axiom by the financial executives at each practice. MedAxiom asked the practice to 
report the total W2 compensation for each physician, and it further clarified the request by 
specifying that the practice not include pension or benefits.
 ANALYSIS
The personal, job, and practice characteristics of the analytic sample were first described 
according to sex. The procedure volumes were then compared after restricting the sample to 
those who performed each procedure at least 5 times in the previous year. Continuous 
variables were compared by using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test; categorical variables were 
compared by using a Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact test. Salary according to sex was 
then described and regression models developed to evaluate the association between sex and 
salary, independent of the other measured characteristics. We first evaluated the unadjusted 
difference in compensation according to sex, the association between compensation and 
wRVUs within each sex separately, and the difference in compensation according to sex 
after adjustment for wRVUs alone. To adjust for additional potential confounders and 
mediators of the sex–salary relationship, a full model was then constructed that included the 
following independent variables: age, sex, subspecialty, full-time status (both as reported in 
surveys and as defined by the investigators), half-days worked, days off, new patient office 
visits, wRVUs, office consultations, return office visits, hospital consultations, initial 
hospital care, hospital observation care, hospital visits, outpatient pacemaker checks, 
permanent pacemaker implantations, catheterizations, echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, 
PET scans, SPECT scans, stress echocardiograms, treadmill tests, practice geographical 
area, practice compensation model, and practice ownership model. For the continuous 
variables representing procedure volumes, the continuous variable was included as well as 
indicator variables capturing any use of procedure and separately at least 5 reported 
procedures. The adjusted association between sex and salary from this full model was 
reported, and a sensitivity analysis was then conducted in the subset of cases for whom call 
schedule was known; the goal was to evaluate the impact of including this variable in 
addition to all others in the full model on the magnitude of any association between salary 
and sex. In addition, a best regression model for salary was developed that was fit via 
stepwise selection, minimizing the Schwarz-derived Bayesian information criterion to 
describe a parsimonious multivariable model of all characteristics associated with 
compensation (procedure volume variables were used exclusively rather than indicator 
variables).
For further evaluation of salary differences according to sex, the Peters-Belson technique 
was also applied. This approach is the preferred statistical method to evaluate compensation 
and has been described in detail elsewhere (11,12). In brief, it involves the development of a 
linear regression model of salary in the subgroup of male subjects alone, followed by the 
application of that model to predict expected salaries in the female subjects (given their

 specific personal, job, and practice characteristics). This approach allows for an evaluation 
of salary observed versus expected, had the women in the sample been men with all other 
measured characteristics held constant. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference in 
predicted versus observed were obtained by using the percentile method of nonparametric 
bootstrap with 1,000 bootstrap replications.
Statistical analyses were conducted by using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
North Carolina). Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant in all analyses.
 RESULTS
Overall, 229 subjects in the analytic sample were female, and the remaining 2,450 were 
male. Table 1 describes the personal, job, and practice characteristics of the analytic sample 
grouped according to sex. The majority of the sample was white, and nearly one-half 
practiced in the South.
Comparison of personal characteristics according to sex reveal that in this sample, the 
distributions of age, race, and subspecialty differed among women and men (p < 0.001, p = 
0.02, and p < 0.001, respectively). Women tended to be younger, with 56% of women being 
<49 years of age compared with 38.8% of men, and less likely to be white (67.3% vs. 
73.2%). Women were also far more likely to have specialized in general/noninvasive 
cardiology (53.1% vs. 28.2%), whereas a lower proportion (11.4% vs. 39.3%) reported an 
interventional subspecialty compared with men.
 COMPARISON OF JOB AND PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS ACCORDING TO SEX
Numerous job characteristics also differed according to sex, including the proportion of 
subjects who were working full-time (79.9% of women vs. 90.9% of men based on survey 
report, and 62.4% vs. 72.7% based on the investigator definition of at least 400 half-days 
worked; both p < 0.001). Women worked a mean of 387 half-days and men a mean of 406 
half-days (p = 0.001). Call responsibilities also varied significantly according to sex (p < 
0.001); although most subjects had full on-call responsibilities (82.5% overall), higher 
proportions of women compared with men took no call (17.5% vs. 7.2%) or partial call 
(15.0% vs. 8.9%) rather than full call (67.5% vs. 83.9%; p < 0.001). Women saw fewer new 
patient office visits (mean 167 vs. 180; p = 0.04) and generated fewer wRVUs (mean 7,404 
vs. 9,497; p < 0.001).
Women were less likely to perform many of the activities we evaluated and were particularly 
less likely to perform procedures such as pacemaker implantations (12.7% vs. 22.9% 
performing ≥5 procedures; p < 0.001) and catheterizations (34.5% vs. 60.1% performing ≥5 
procedures; p < 0.001). Women were more likely to perform SPECT scans (66.8% vs. 
59.3% performing ≥5 procedures; p = 0.04) and stress echocardiograms (71.2% vs. 61.2% 
performing ≥5 procedures; p = 0.01), and no less likely to perform echocardiograms 
generally (90.4% vs. 87.4% performing ≥5 procedures; p = 0.26) or treadmill testing (88.2% 
vs. 87.3% performing ≥5 procedures; p = 0.78).

 Most practice characteristics did not differ significantly according to sex. However, practice 
composition was significantly different (p = 0.01), with women slightly less likely to be part 
of groups that included cardiology only (70.0% vs. 74.8%).
Table 2 displays the mean values of services and demonstrates that, for most of the services 
evaluated, procedure volumes were similar for men and women who had performed at least 
5 of those services in the preceding year. However, per-physician annual volumes differed 
for certain activities, including most dramatically the number of hospital visits (mean 566 
for women performing ≥5 procedures vs. 676 for men; p < 0.001), outpatient pacemaker 
checks (mean 274 among women performing ≥5 procedures vs. 403 for men; p < 0.001), 
and catheterizations (mean 133 performed by women who performed ≥5 procedures vs. 217 
by men; p < 0.001).
 COMPARISON OF COMPENSATION ACCORDING TO SEX
Men generally had higher salaries than women. Mean salary was $400,162 ± $192,124 
(median $394,586; interquartile range $256,064 to $518,277) among the women and 
$510,996 ± $216,337 (median $502,251; interquartile range $381,417 to $621,306) among 
the men. Figure 2 provides waterfall plots of unadjusted compensation according to sex in 
this sample. Table 3 presents compensation according to sex in several meaningful 
subgroups.
Figure 3 displays the plots of compensation versus wRVUs for men and for women. The 
slope of the association between compensation and wRVUs among women was $34.36 per 
wRVU (95% CI: 28.64 to 40.08); the slope among men was $32.47 per wRVU (95% CI: 
30.88 to 34.06). There was no significant difference between slopes (p = 0.53), suggesting 
that the relationship between wRVUs and salary was similar for both sexes. However, a 
significant difference in the intercepts (p = 0.03) suggests a difference in compensation by 
sex that was not fully explained by wRVUs. The fit with a wRVU-only model was modest: 
R2 were 0.39 for men and 0.45 for women.
The Central Illustration depicts the difference according to sex in compensation before any 
adjustment, after adjustment for clinical productivity (as measured solely by wRVUs), and 
after adjustment for multiple measured characteristics in the dataset. As shown, although 
adjustment for >40 personal, job, practice, and productivity characteristics as described in 
the Methods substantially improved the model fit (R2 rose to 0.59), sex remained 
independently associated with salary in this sample (p = 0.001), with an effect size of 
$37,717 (95% CI: 15,056 to 60,378) for male versus female physicians in the fully 
controlled model (R2 = 0.59); the full model is presented in Online Table 1. In a sensitivity 
analysis of the subset of 1,301 respondents whose call schedule was known in addition to the 
other characteristics included in the full model, sex was again found to be independently 
associated with salary (p = 0.006), with a similar effect size ($43,217 higher predicted pay 
for a man vs. a woman with all other characteristics held constant).
The best parsimonious model of salary in this sample (R2 = 0.55) revealed associations 
between salary and sex along with 6 job characteristics (subspecialty, full-time status, 
wRVUs, hospital observation care, hospital initial care, and stress echocardiograms) and 2

 practice characteristics (geographical area and ownership model) (Table 4). The sex 
difference observed in the parsimonious model was again similarly sized to that observed in 
the full model ($38,485) and significant (p < 0.001).
Peters-Belson analysis revealed that, on the basis of productivity and other characteristics, 
the women in this sample would be expected to have a mean salary of $432,631 if they had 
been male (model R2 = 0.56). The actual observed mean salary among women was 
$400,882. Thus, there was a $31,749 difference in salary (95% CI: 16,303 to 48,028) 
according to sex that was not explained by the detailed measures of personal, job, and 
practice characteristics evaluated in this study.
 DISCUSSION
This analysis of practicing cardiologists’ job activities and compensation provides novel 
information about the ways cardiologists in general, and men and women in particular, 
allocate their professional effort. Our observation of a significant sex difference in 
compensation, even after adjusting for differences in multiple measures of productivity and 
job activity in this sample of practicing cardiologists, is also—to our knowledge—unique. 
The present study suggests that although some of the overall variation in salary between 
male and female cardiologists can be explained by differences in work performed, a 
substantial difference remains even after detailed measurement of procedural volumes, on-
call coverage, and other work activities. Furthermore, the magnitude of this difference is 
remarkably constant when analyzed in various ways.
Although sex differences in physician pay have been documented in numerous previous 
studies (13–20), questions have remained about the extent to which they relate to differences 
in specialty, productivity, and other job characteristics, especially for physicians practicing 
outside of academic medical centers (21,22). Moreover, there continues to be hope that 
differences documented in older studies might have dissipated over time. To our knowledge, 
the only data regarding salaries in the field of cardiology have been limited by lack of 
adjustment for meaningful differences in productivity and other job characteristics (23).
The present study’s findings regarding salary are interesting when considered in the context 
of the 2006 ACC survey (10). In that survey, a bigger difference in dissatisfaction with 
financial compensation was observed between men and women in academic positions, with 
29% of women working in such settings expressing moderate or severe dissatisfaction, 
compared with 18% of men. By contrast, similar proportions of cardiologists of either sex 
(17% of women and 18% of men) working in other settings, presumably largely in 
community practice, expressed dissatisfaction with financial compensation. Previous studies 
have clearly established sex differences in salary within homogeneous groups of academic 
physicians, even after accounting for numerous measures of academic and clinical 
productivity and other characteristics (21,22). The present study suggests that these 
unexplained differences are not restricted to academic settings but also exist in the 
compensation of a single specialty of physicians practicing in the community.

 Our findings regarding working patterns also offer an interesting complement to the data 
previously reported in the ACC surveys (10). The ACC surveys documented a decrease over 
time in the proportion of both men and women who described themselves as working full-
time, from 86% and 95% of women and men, respectively, in 1996, to 80% and 82% in 
2006. In the present sample, men were more likely to report working full-time than women 
(91% vs. 80%), although both men and women were likely to overestimate working full-
time when this was recalculated as at least 400 half-day sessions per year. Such differences 
may relate to differences in the sampling frame of the 2 studies, and further research is 
necessary to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the ways in which cardiologists 
may deviate from full-time practice, which cardiologists do so, and how satisfied they may 
be.
Other findings of this study, such as women’s lower likelihood of taking full call, are 
consistent with previous studies. Numerous studies have documented our society’s 
recalcitrance toward changing the traditional norms of a gendered division of labor in which 
women continue to be more likely to shoulder the greater burden of domestic 
responsibilities, as well as its impact on women’s experiences in the medical profession (24–
28). Even among highly career-oriented young physicians, studies have reported large 
differences in the hours per week devoted to parenting and domestic activities by women 
versus men (29). In that context, it is hardly surprising that women are less likely to 
participate in full call. An important contribution of this study, however, is to document that 
such arrangements do exist in a number of cardiology practices, indicating that young 
women should not be unduly pessimistic about the possibility of combining a career in 
cardiology with other desired personal roles. Others have previously noted the importance of 
disseminating this information to medical students and internal medicine residents (8).
It is important to note that sex differences in participation in traditional full-time, full-call 
roles may magnify the possible impact of sex differences in negotiation behaviors on 
compensation. Contracts for nontraditional positions, including part-time jobs or ones that 
involve lesser participation in on-call duties, are likely to be less standardized than contracts 
for more traditional positions. The small percentage of compensation models (approximately 
25%) that are solely and strictly based on productivity or on an equal share among all 
physicians in a practice would be unlikely to reveal differences in sex; however, the majority 
include other components and may be more likely to result in some nonobjective variability 
in pay. This may amplify documented differences in negotiation behaviors between men and 
women (30–32) in ways that could explain some of the differences observed in the present 
study. Although we did control the models for full-time status and performed a sensitivity 
analysis that included on-call duties, if women in non–full-time and/or non–full-call 
positions required nonstandard contracts and also negotiated less aggressively than men 
pursuing similar positions, that could explain some of the residual salary difference 
observed. Unfortunately, women’s failure to negotiate as aggressively as men is, to some 
extent, related to observations that women who behave in ways discordant to sex stereotypes 
may be perceived differently and experience other adverse consequences.
Women’s lesser likelihood of specializing in interventional cardiology is a well-documented 
phenomenon (7,10). To the extent that women are discouraged from pursuing interventional 
Jagsi et al.

 careers due to sex bias, discrimination, or unfounded concerns about occupational radiation 
exposure, this topic merits ongoing attention. To the extent that work-force projections 
forecast a shortage of general cardiologists, and thought leaders seek to encourage trainees 
to pursue that path (33), the greater tendency for women to pursue careers in general or 
noninvasive cardiology suggests that efforts to recruit women to cardiology training are even 
more important.
The observation that women generated fewer wRVUs in this study must be taken in the 
context of the observations regarding differences in specialization and not simply a 
difference in productivity. The tendency of the current U.S. system of clinical 
reimbursement to reward intervention over cognitive activity can magnify sex inequity in a 
society in which young men are socialized to exhibit “agentic” behaviors and young women 
are expected to demonstrate “communal” behaviors. This tendency may in turn lead to some 
of the differences in specialization and reward observed. It is particularly striking that sex 
differences in pay exist even after accounting for differences in specialization and wRVU 
assessment.
 STUDY LIMITATIONS
This study has numerous strengths, including access to data on detailed work activities, 
productivity metrics, and pay of practicing cardiologists, that have not been available 
through other sources. Nevertheless, it also has limitations. First, data in this study were 
reported by practice administrators; although these individuals are likely to have accurate 
information about productivity and pay metrics, the potential for misreporting exists. 
However, we believe that systematic misreporting according to sex is unlikely, minimizing 
the impact of this factor on the main study findings. Second, this sample was limited to 
MedAxiom member organizations that responded to the 2014 annual survey, which covers 
all data from calendar year 2013; the generalizability of these findings to practices dissimilar 
to those who reported data (particularly academic or smaller practices that may not utilize its 
services) may be limited. Most of the sample came from the Midwest and South, which 
could also affect the generalizability of the findings across the United States, although 
controlling for practice location did not eliminate the sex difference observed. We had access 
to a large number of productivity metrics, but there may be relevant unmeasured factors that 
could have explained and possibly justified the sex differences in pay observed. In particular, 
information on call responsibilities was not available for many individuals, although we 
observed no modifying effect of including that variable within the subset of respondents for 
whom these data were available. Other potential sources of compensation such as medical 
directorships, which may vary meaningfully according to sex, were not captured and could 
account for some of the unexplained differences in overall compensation observed. 
However, if the process of determining medical directorship or other leadership positions 
itself reflects sex-biased processes of evaluation, this would not necessarily be a justifiable 
source of differences in pay. Similarly, information regarding differences in access to 
support (such as mid-level providers) was not available to us, but if not uniform may affect 
both productivity measures and income. To protect the anonymity of providers and 
individuals, we did not have practice identifiers that would allow us to control for correlation 
of individuals from the same practice. If certain practices that provided the highest levels of

 physician compensation were predominantly male (and the ability to provide this 
compensation was not itself due to productivity measures already controlled for in the 
analysis), this could account for some of the differences observed, rather than 
inconsistencies in remuneration by sex within a given practice. Finally, we did not have 
information on other aspects of compensation such as retirement contributions, insurance, or 
practice equity from partnership status that may differ by sex, nor did we have access to 
information on differences in patient insurance mix.
 CONCLUSIONS
This study provides valuable information about the diverse jobs held by men and women 
practicing cardiology in the United States today. In a landmark working group report, 
Warnes et al. (8) state, “It is imperative that female medical students and internal medicine 
residents become better informed about the broad spectrum of career opportunities in 
cardiology, several of which are compatible with a desire to achieve better work-life 
balance.” The findings of the present study suggest that there is indeed a broad range of 
working patterns and job characteristics available to men and women practicing cardiology 
in the community. These findings may therefore be particularly useful to cite when seeking 
to recruit promising young men and women to the discipline. The findings should also 
motivate efforts to ensure equity in pay, including the promotion of greater transparency and 
consistency in salary structures at the practice level. One of the first steps in creating 
meaningful change is to recognize that sex equity is not solely a “women’s issue” but rather 
an issue that affects the entire profession. Professional societies and cardiovascular practices 
must carefully examine their cultures as well as objective practices, with special attention to 
the insights provided in the growing literature on how best to mitigate barriers to the careers 
of women physicians.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PROFESSIONALISM
Men and women practicing cardiology in the United States have diverse job activities. A 
broad spectrum of career opportunities within the specialty may be attractive to young 
men and women alike.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK
Future research should focus on the developing interventions that foster greater equality 
in compensation for both male and female cardiologists.

 FIGURE 3. 
Unadjusted Compensation by Work RVU Productivity According to Sex
These scatterplots demonstrate that although women and men have similar increases in 
compensation per work relative value unit (RVU), with similar slopes for the association (p 
= 0.53 for difference), there are significant differences in compensation by sex (differences 
in the intercept, p = 0.03 for the difference) that are unexplained by work RVU productivity. 
Model R2 values were modest at 0.39 for male subjects and 0.45 for female subjects. CV = 
cardiovascular; MD = medical doctor.

 CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION. 
Male and Female Cardiologists: Sex Differences in Work Activities and Compensation
The differences in compensation for men and women before any adjustment, after 
adjustment for work relative value units (RVUs) alone (R2 = 0.41), and after adjustment for 
a number of other measured personal, job, and practice characteristics (point estimates with 
95% confidence intervals; R2 = 0.59). It also depicts the difference between salary observed 
among women in this sample, compared with that expected, based on a Peters-Belson model 
predicting compensation based on the data from their male colleagues, if they retained their 
same personal, job, and practice characteristics but had been male (R2 = 0.55).
