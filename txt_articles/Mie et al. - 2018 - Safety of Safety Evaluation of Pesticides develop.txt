Safety of Safety Evaluation of Pesticides:
developmental neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos
and chlorpyrifos-methyl

Abstract
Authorization of pesticides for market release requires toxicity testing on animals, typically performed by test
laboratories on contract with the pesticide producer. The latter provides the results and summary to the regulatory
authorities. For the commonly used pesticide chlorpyrifos, an industry-funded toxicity study concludes that no
selective effects on neurodevelopment occur even at high exposures. In contrast, the evidence from independent
studies points to adverse effects of current exposures on cognitive development in children. We reviewed
the industry-funded developmental neurotoxicity test data on chlorpyrifos and the related substance chlorpyrifos-
methyl. We noted treatment-related changes in a brain dimension measure for chlorpyrifos at all dose levels tested,
although not been reported in the original test summary. We further found issues which inappropriately decrease
the ability of the studies to reveal true effects, including a dosage regimen that resulted in too low exposure of the
nursing pups for chlorpyrifos and possibly for chlorpyrifos-methyl, and a failure to detect any neurobehavioral
effects of lead nitrate used as positive control in the chlorpyrifos study. Our observations thus suggest that
conclusions in test reports submitted by the producer may be misleading. This discrepancy affects the ability of
regulatory authorities to perform a valid and safe evaluation of these pesticides. The difference between raw data
and conclusions in the test reports indicates a potential existence of bias that would require regulatory attention
and possible resolution.

Background
Pesticide producers are responsible for the safety of their
products. Due to their inherent toxic properties, market
release and subsequent reauthorizations require a com-
prehensive and highly regulated risk assessment, although
specific rules differ between countries. The toxicity testing
is provided by the producer and is reviewed by regulatory
authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA); the latter relies on a detailed evaluation carried
out by a Rapporteur Member State (RMS). Differences in
conclusions on pesticide safety occur, as has recently
become apparent for chlorpyrifos, a widely used organo-
phosphate insecticide.
At the core of the toxicological risk assessment are ani-
mal tests, performed with the aim of identifying and char-
acterizing any adverse effects, in a design in accordance
with established test guidelines and under Good Laboratory
Practice (GLP) requirements. Typically, a pesticide produ-
cer commissions the animal studies from external commer-
cial laboratories, which perform the tests and generate
reports under the auspices of the producer. Unfortunately,
the study reports are usually not released to the public.
Independent academic studies and industry-sponsored
toxicity studies may lead to fundamentally different con-
clusions [1], as is the case for chlorpyrifos. Thus, based on
independent epidemiological, in vivo and in vitro studies,
the evidence points to adverse health effects of chlorpyri-
fos exposure on the developing nervous system, associated
with lowered IQ at school age, at current levels of

 exposure [2]. These outcomes have been observed at ex-
posure levels far below those recognized to cause effects
on brain development in an industry-funded developmen-
tal neurotoxicity (DNT) study commissioned for regula-
tory purposes [3, 4].
Such a discrepancy in the evidence can result in widely
differing conclusions by regulatory agencies. In the U.S., a
state-of-the-art EPA risk assessment recently recommended
a steady-state population-adjusted dose (ssPAD) between
0.0012 and 0.002 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day, depending
on age, as based on DNT observed in epidemiological stud-
ies and supported by other independent scientific evidence
[5]. The most highly exposed subpopulation was children
between 1 and 2 years of age, who had steady-state
(21-day) dietary exposures of 0.027 (subpopulation median)
and 0.242 μg/kg bw/day (99.9th percentile), thereby greatly
exceeding their ssPAD of 0.0017 μg/kg bw/day [5, 6]. In the
EU, the corresponding Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is
currently set at 1 μg/kg bw/day, as based on erythrocyte
acetylcholinesterase inhibition in rats observed in an
industry-sponsored toxicity study. The epidemiological evi-
dence and other independent studies indicating DNT at
lower doses were assigned little weight in the EU assess-
ment. The most highly exposed subpopulation identified in
the EU is 2-to-4-year old German children, who had a
chronic (long-term) dietary exposure of 0.126 μg/kg bw/
day (subpopulation mean) [7], again exceeding the ssPAD.
Considering EPA’s and EFSA’s differing conclusions,
we first examined published summary data [4] from the
industry-funded chlorpyrifos DNT study [3]. These sum-
mary data suggest a possible effect of chlorpyrifos on the
height of the cerebellum, one of nine evaluated regional
brain dimensions, in exposed nursing rat pups, observed
at all dosage levels for female juvenile pups. Such an ef-
fect may indicate damage to the architecture of the de-
veloping
brain.
Due
to
the
intricate
development
schedule of the brain, such damage may have life-long
consequences [2]. To understand these findings, we re-
lied on freedom of information legislation to obtain ac-
cess to the reports of the DNT studies of chlorpyrifos
performed in 1997–1998 [3] and the structurally closely
related compound, chlorpyrifos-methyl, from 2015 [8].
Two different test laboratories performed these guideline
DNT studies, both sponsored by the same pesticide produ-
cer. In both studies, pregnant rats were exposed to different
levels of the insecticide from day 6 of gestation until post-
natal day (PND) 11 (chlorpyrifos) or 21 (chlorpyrifos--
methyl), in accordance with test guidelines and GLP. Brain
morphometrics were evaluated upon termination of dosing
and in adult offspring. The pups’ neurobehavioral functions
(motor activity, learning and memory, auditory startle re-
sponse) were evaluated at two or four time points. Develop-
mental landmarks as well as general toxicity in the dams
and pups were also evaluated in the DNT studies.
Brain morphological differences in the chlorpyrifos-
exposed pups
The overall conclusion from the contract laboratory
in the chlorpyrifos DNT study was that no effects on
brain morphology and behavior were observed at dose
levels 0.3 and 1 mg/kg bw/day (low and medium
dose), while at 5 mg/kg bw/day (high dose), multiple
effects were identified, although in the presence of mater-
nal toxicity [3]. This conclusion was relayed by the spon-
sor in subsequent applications for authorization, most
recently in 2015.
For high-dose pups, the test laboratory reported a sig-
nificant reduction of total brain weight and the dimen-
sions of several brain regions on PND 11 but not on PND
65 (see also Additional file 1). The test lab argued that
these observed effects do not indicate DNT. Effects are in-
stead interpreted as consequences of undernutrition sec-
ondary to maternal toxicity, which would be thought to
affect all brain regions.
To support this interpretation, the test laboratory calcu-
lated that the average effect on all brain regions is similar to
the effect on brain weight [3]. However, the use of averages
could potentially mask effects on a specific brain region.
Accordingly, the EPA has identified this analytical approach
as an “inappropriate and inconclusive manipulation of the
data” [9], but a correction was apparently not requested
from the pesticide producer submitting the report.
The proper way to demonstrate the absence of a sensi-
tive target region is to express each brain regional measure
relative to brain weight, which the study report also does
for a limited number of cases, but not systematically [3].
Our re-analysis of the raw data shows that when
expressed relative to brain weight, cerebellum height in
PND 11 pups is decreased by 8–11% in low and mid-dose
groups in both sexes, as compared to controls (Fig. 1). In
the high dose group, absolute cerebellum height is de-
creased by 9–14%; however, this reduction coincides
with a similarly decreased brain weight. Thus, Fig. 1a
suggests a monotonic dose response relationship be-
tween dose and cerebellum height. The U-shaped
dose-response relationship in Fig. 1b is consistent with
an effect of chlorpyrifos on the cerebellum height at
low, mid and high dose, and on overall brain weight at
high dose only; the high-dose-only effect on brain
weight is recognized in the study report [3]. Low- and
mid-dose effects are statistically highly significant, con-
sistent in both sexes, and observed in the absence of
general maternal toxicity, hence indicating the presence
of DNT at all dose levels tested. However, this analysis
was not included in the DNT study report.
Shortcomings in test design
The brain growth spurt occurs mainly postnatally in rats
but prenatally in humans. Accordingly, a dosing scheme

 maintaining an exposure of neonatal pups equivalent to
continuous in utero exposure in humans would be most
relevant for addressing effects during this vulnerable de-
velopmental stage. A parallel study sponsored by the
same company shows that the chlorpyrifos concentra-
tion in the blood from nursing pups decreased substan-
tially, compared to fetal blood levels, because only a
small fraction of the continued maternal exposure is
transferred via milk [10]. Accordingly, the DNT study
design does not appropriately model human exposure to
chlorpyrifos during the full prenatal time window in
humans.
We also note post-hoc changes to the statistical proto-
col as well as an unusually low cut-off for statistical sig-
nificance (α = 0.02) in most of the study report, although
a justification was not provided.
Test facilities are required to include positive control
studies in DNT study reports, demonstrating their profi-
ciency to correctly identify effects of known develop-
mental neurotoxicants. However, in the present case, the
test facility was unable to detect neurobehavioral effects
of elevated developmental exposure to lead nitrate [3],
although lead is a confirmed developmental neurotoxi-
cant at very low doses [2].
The above issues limit the ability of the DNT study to
detect true effects, although this was not pointed out by
the test laboratory or the pesticide producer in the study
report or in the submission to regulatory authorities.
Chlorpyrifos-methyl
In the chlorpyrifos-methyl DNT study [8], brain morph-
ology was evaluated in ten pups per sex in the control
and high dose pups at PND 21 and 72. However, for
cerebellum height, 40 out of 80 data points are missing
in the report, with an explanation provided only for 40%
of the missing data (females on PND 72, unspecified
“technical error at trimming”). The test facility reported
that with no other effects on the brain identified, “the
absence of these few data points affecting cerebellum of
females at PND 72 does not affect the interpretation of
the study”.
Again, for this substance, the exposure of nursing pups
may not have adequately modelled human exposure
within the complete time window of prenatal vulnerabil-
ity. Specifically, the study report indicates that pups were
exposed via the milk while nursing [8]. However, no data
on the actual exposure of nursing pups are provided.
Implications
For the ongoing re-evaluation of chlorpyrifos in the
EU, 100 unpublished industry-owned toxicology and
metabolism studies have been submitted by the pesti-
cide producer, likely totaling tens of thousands of
pages. Dossiers are then examined and reviewed by
authorities. Given the comprehensiveness of the sub-
mitted documentation, this procedure relies on com-
panies submitting complete and correct information,
while authorities may not have sufficient resources for
an all-encompassing review.
Our review of the chlorpyrifos DNT study report iden-
tified important omissions and divergences from the
guidelines and appropriate practices. For example, the
raw data show an unreported deviation from the normal
architecture of the developing brain at low doses; this in-
dication of DNT would likely have spurred a request for
further investigation already in 1999. The reliability of

 data on neurobehavioral outcomes is questioned by the
failure of positive control experiments to produce posi-
tive results. Further, the study design is inappropriate for
modelling human exposure during the full period of pre-
natal brain development in humans. A failure of both
U.S. and EU authorities to act on departures from safe
procedures could potentially have occurred from incom-
plete review of the wealth of data, perhaps coupled with
exaggerated trust in the reporting from an experienced
commercial laboratory. It is noteworthy that the U.S.
EPA did identify several shortcomings in the chlorpyrifos
DNT study, but apparently pursued only some [9, 11].
As the purpose of regulatory risk assessment of pesti-
cides (and other industrial chemicals) is to identify and
control risks to human health, the regulatory system
must rely on test facilities designing and conducting the
tests properly and analyzing and reporting all observed
changes within test parameters.
However, in the present case, the two DNT studies
seem to violate this rationale and thereby in a wider
sense call into question the reliability of test results sub-
mitted, and thus also the prudence of regulatory systems
relying on such tests. While conducted under the aus-
pices of companies with a financial interest in obtaining
null findings, the public health impact of not identifying
existing risks may be substantial. Thus, a recent study
calculated the annual costs to EU populations at €146
($171) billion from IQ losses due to chlorpyrifos and
other
organophosphate
exposures
during
pregnancy
[12]. A similar calculation from the U.S. suggested an-
nual costs of $45 billion [13].
Given the accumulating experience, several recom-
mendations deserve renewed attention. One possibility
previously considered [14, 15] is to require that future
industry-funded toxicity studies be commissioned via
regulatory authorities in order to avoid any perceived or
real conflict of interest at the test laboratory. This solu-
tion would address concerns that industry-funded stud-
ies
may
downplay
the
risks
associated
with
their
products (e.g. [16, 17]). In addition, the test lab should
be chosen by authorities based on demonstrated profi-
ciency in addressing the required endpoints and success-
fully performing the tests required. Further, independent
scientists should be allowed full access to all documenta-
tion from these toxicity studies, which should no longer
be considered confidential business information. Finally,
specifically in the present case, care must be taken not
to substitute chlorpyrifos by less diligently studied or-
ganophosphate insecticides, such as chlorpyrifos-methyl,
thereby potentially leading to what is known as regret-
table substitution.
Low-dose effects of chlorpyrifos on the developing
brain are evident both in the aggregated independent
science and in the company-sponsored DNT study, but
only the former have reported such conclusions. A newly
proposed EPA rule [18] aims at obtaining the “best avail-
able science” and requires full public availability of all re-
search data. A likely consequence of the proposed rule is
the
exclusion of important academic
science from
decision-making, e.g. due to ethical difficulties of pub-
licly disclosing data from epidemiological studies [19].
However, our analysis indicates that “best available sci-
ence” should require elimination of funding bias and
additional reliance on all valid and relevant scientific evi-
dence, as guided by strengths and limitations of different
types of studies [20]. A narrow focus on raw data avail-
ability might augment biases of decision-making in favor
of industry-sponsored studies.
Independent science and regulatory safety evaluations
have different purposes and speak, to some extent, differ-
ent languages. Approaches suggested e.g. by the Science
in Risk Assessment and Policy (SciRAP) initiative may aid
researchers in reporting and authorities in evaluating in-
dependent scientific studies for regulatory purposes [21].
Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) standards
aim at further increasing data availability in academic sci-
ence while balancing other legitimate interests such as
privacy in human subjects research [19].
Conclusions
In our review of raw data on a prominent pesticide, chlor-
pyrifos, and a related compound, discrepancies were dis-
covered
between
the
actual
observations
and
the
conclusions drawn by the test laboratory in the report sub-
mitted for authorization of the pesticide. These observa-
tions are highly relevant in view of the present legal
challenges to continued chlorpyrifos use in the USA and
the ongoing re-evaluation of the current approval in the
EU. Although our findings may not be generalized, they
suggest
the
existence
of
bias
in
the
reporting
of
industry-sponsored toxicity studies. The prevalence of such
(funding) bias deserves further examination. Current evalu-
ation procedures for pesticides may need to be modified to
ensure that the public is not exposed to substances that
may harm human health, e.g., by commissioning required
toxicity studies via regulatory authorities.
