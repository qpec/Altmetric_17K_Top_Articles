Context: Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur with metformin treatment, but few studies have as-
sessed risk with long-term use.
Objective: To assess the risk of B12 deficiency with metformin use in the Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP)/DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS).
Design: Secondary analysis from the DPP/DPPOS. Participants were assigned to the placebo group
(PLA) (n � 1082) or the metformin group (MET) (n � 1073) for 3.2 years; subjects in the metformin
group received open-label metformin for an additional 9 years.
Setting: Twenty-seven study centers in the United States.
Patients: DPP eligibility criteria were: elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and over-
weight/obesity. The analytic population comprised participants with available stored samples. B12 levels
were assessed at 5 years (n � 857, n � 858) and 13 years (n � 756, n � 764) in PLA and MET, respectively.
Interventions: Metformin 850 mg twice daily vs placebo (DPP), and open-label metformin in the
metformin group (DPPOS).
Main Outcome Measures: B12 deficiency, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy.
Results: Low B12 (� 203 pg/mL) occurred more often in MET than PLA at 5 years (4.3 vs 2.3%; P � .02)
butnotat13years(7.4vs5.4%;P�.12).Combinedlowandborderline-lowB12(�298pg/mL)wasmore
common in MET at 5 years (19.1 vs 9.5%; P � .01) and 13 years (20.3 vs 15.6%; P � .02). Years of
metformin use were associated with increased risk of B12 deficiency (odds ratio, B12 deficiency/year
metformin use, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.20). Anemia prevalence was higher in MET, but
did not differ by B12 status. Neuropathy prevalence was higher in MET with low B12 levels.
Conclusions:Long-termuseofmetformininDPPOSwasassociatedwithbiochemicalB12deficiency
and anemia. Routine testing of vitamin B12 levels in metformin-treated patients should be
considered. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 1754–1761, 2016)

n 1969, Berchtold et al (1) reported evidence of vitamin
B12 malabsorption in patients who had been treated
with metformin for as little as 3 months. As early as 1971,
Tomkin et al (2) recommended that all patients on long-
term metformin therapy have annual serum B12 testing,
based on a cross-sectional evaluation.
Since then, cross-sectional, retrospective, and longi-
tudinal observational studies (3–14), as well as case re-
ports (15, 16), have suggested a clinical association be-
tween long-term metformin use and vitamin B12
deficiency (17, 18).
However, few prospective placebo-controlled studies
have been conducted to define the risk of vitamin B12
deficiency in metformin-treated individuals, and none
thus far specifically in prediabetic individuals. Most ran-
domized trials addressing this issue have been small or of
short duration (�6 months) and have primarily been in
patients with type 2 diabetes (19–21), with a few short-
term studies specifically done in gestational diabetes or
polycystic ovary syndrome (22–25). The largest prospec-
tive placebo-controlled randomized trial to date evaluat-
ing vitamin B12 levels with metformin in type 2 diabetes
showed that over 4.3 years, metformin reduced vitamin
B12 concentration by 19%, increased homocysteine con-
centration by 5%, and was associated with an 11-fold
increased risk in low vitamin B12 levels compared to pla-
cebo (19).
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)/DPP Out-
comes Study (DPPOS) represents one of the largest and
longest studies of metformin treatment. In the DPP/
DPPOS, persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes have been
continued on randomized metformin treatment for over
10 years. Assessment of vitamin B12 status in the popu-
lation represented in the DPP/DPPOS has not previously
been reported. In addition, the DPP/DPPOS recorded rel-
evantexposurehistoryfromparticipantswhowerestarted
on nonstudy metformin therapy due to the subsequent
development of diabetes during the study and has assessed
potential complications of B12 deficiency.
In this analysis from the DPP/DPPOS, vitamin B12 and
homocysteine levels were assessed in metformin and pla-
cebo-assigned participants at a mean 5 years and 13 years
of follow-up. We report here the risk of vitamin B12 de-
ficiency, as well as associated complications (anemia, neu-
ropathy) with metformin use in the DPP/DPPOS.
Subjects and Methods
Study design
The DPP and DPPOS design, eligibility, and baseline charac-
teristics have been reported elsewhere (26, 27). The DPP enrolled
3234 participants with impaired glucose tolerance and fasting
blood glucose of 95 to 125 mg/dL (�125 mg/dL in American
Indians) who were at least 25 years of age and had body mass
index (BMI) of 24 kg/m2 or higher (�22 kg/m2 in Asian Amer-
icans). Enrollment began in July 1996 and ended in May 1999.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments:
placebo, an intensive lifestyle program, or metformin 850 mg
twice daily. All of the 27 DPP clinical study centers as well as the
DPP Coordinating Center had institutional review board ap-
proval. All participants gave written informed consent.
Mean follow-up at the end of the DPP was 3.2 years. At the
end of the DPP, all participants were offered a group-imple-
mented lifestyle intervention and invited to enroll in the fol-
low-up study, DPPOS. During the DPPOS, those originally as-
signed to metformin received open-label metformin at the same
prior dose of 850 mg twice daily, which was continued until such
time as diabetes developed and HbA1c value reached � 7%. At
this point, study metformin was discontinued, and the partici-
pant referred to his or her own physician for treatment of dia-
betes, which may have included metformin. Samples used for
measurement of vitamin B12 and homocysteine, as a corrobo-
rating indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency, were collected an
average of 5 years (DPPOS year 1) and 13 years (DPPOS year 9)
after initial randomization and analyzed in 2011 (Supplemental
Data). Stored serum samples from other time points, including
the DPP baseline, were not available. DPPOS year 9 was chosen
to coincide with planned neuropathy outcome measures.
Vitamin B12 levels were measured using Tosoh reagent on a
Tosoh 1800 analyzer (TOSOH Bioscience, Inc). The assay sen-
sitivity is 50 pg/mL, and the results are traceable to the World
Health Organization IS 03/178 reference material. The interas-
say coefficients of variation obtained on quality control samples
with high-, medium- and low levels ranged from 7.2% to 8.8%.
Homocysteine levels were measured by a homogeneous enzy-
matic assay on a Roche Modular P analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,
Inc., Indianapolis, IN). The assay sensitivity is 1 �mol/L and the
results are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology reference preparation homocysteine. The interassay
coefficients of variation obtained on quality control samples
with high-, medium-, and low levels ranged from 3.9 to 8.9%.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit were obtained as a safety mea-
sure to detect B12 deficiency anemia in placebo and metformin-
assigned participants annually in DPP and in DPPOS year 1, but
only in participants actively taking study-provided metformin
thereafter. Participants identified with anemia were referred to
their own physicians for evaluation and treatment.
Low vitamin B12 was defined as � 203 pg/mL, and border-
line-low levels were defined as between 204 and 298 pg/mL,
inclusive (28, 29). Anemia was defined as hemoglobin � 12 g/dL
or hematocrit � 36% (females) and hemoglobin � 13 g/dL or
hematocrit � 40% (males). Elevated homocysteine was defined
as � 13.7 �mol/L (13). Metformin exposure, documented by
counting returned tablets at each study visit, was assessed semi-
annually. Study-provided metformin usage was calculated, as
well as total metformin years of exposure, which includes both
protocol-based and nonprotocol metformin use (ie, prescribed
outside of the study for diabetes treatment). Clinical neuropathy
was defined as a reduction or absence of light touch sensation to
monofilament (Semmes-Weinstein, 10 g) in either foot (� eight
of 10 applications detected). The Michigan Neuropathy Screen-
ing Instrument (MNSI) was conducted annually and was ana-
lyzed for DPPOS years 1 and 9, concurrent with B12 measure-
ments (30).

 Statistical analysis
The study population for this analysis comprised participants
randomized to placebo (n � 902) or metformin (n � 898) during
DPP who had available serum stored from either DPPOS years 1
or 9 measured for vitamin B12 levels. Participants who had un-
dergone bariatric surgery before collection of serum samples
(n�4atDPPOSyear1,andn�49atyear9)wereexcludedfrom
this analysis. Comparisons of vitamin B12 levels and vitamin
B12 deficiency by treatment group were made at each time point
using t tests and �2 tests. Total metformin-years were computed
by adding years of taking any study-provided metformin as well
as self-reported use of any metformin prescribed outside of the
study. Separate treatment-specific and combined logistic regres-
sionmodelswereusedtoassessvitaminB12deficiencyatDPPOS
year 9 by years of total metformin use after adjustment for age,
sex, BMI, use of prescription proton pump inhibitors or pre-
scription H2 blockers, diabetes status, weight change during
DPP/DPPOS, and treatment arm for the combined sample.
Results
Study population
As described previously (26), the original DPP cohort
comprised of two-thirds women and 45% ethnic minor-
ities, with an average age of 51 years at baseline. Charac-
teristics of the participants included in this analysis at DPP
baseline and DPPOS years 1 and 9 are shown in Table 1.
Vitamin B12, homocysteine levels, and vitamin B12
deficiency
Levels of vitamin B12 and homocysteine and met-
formin exposure at a mean 5 years (DPPOS year 1) and 13
years (DPPOS year 9) of follow-up are shown in Table 1.
Comparing the metformin to placebo groups at DPPOS
year 1, mean B12 levels were 10% lower, and the preva-
lence of B12 deficiency (4.3 vs 2.4%; P � .02) and bor-
derline-low vitamin B12 levels (19.1 vs 9.5%; P � .01)
were significantly higher. A similar, but nonsignificant
pattern was seen for mean vitamin B12 levels and preva-
lence of deficiency in DPPOS year 9. Somewhat paradox-
ically, in both treatment groups, mean vitamin B12 levels
were greater in DPPOS year 9 compared with year 1, yet
the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was also greater
in year 9 compared with year 1 in each treatment group.
The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was greatest
among participants actively taking study-provided met-
formin and increased over time (5.2 vs. 9.2% after 5 and
13 years, respectively). Among participants with vitamin
B12 deficiency in DPPOS year 1, 38 and 45% remained
deficient at DPPOS year 9 in the metformin and placebo
groups, respectively. Vitamin B12 levels at DPPOS year 1
were correlated with DPPOS year 9 measurements (Spear-
man correlation coefficient, 0.54). At DPPOS year 1, use

 of prescription (injectable) B12 was reported by two par-
ticipantsinthemetformingroupandoneparticipantinthe
placebo group, and in year 9 by seven participants in the
metformin group and three participants in the placebo
group.
Vitamin B12 deficiency and borderline-low vitamin
B12 were associated with higher circulating homocysteine
levels in the metformin and placebo groups, although
mean homocysteine was not significantly different be-
tween the two treatment groups (Table 2). In the met-
formin group, among those with low or borderline
vitamin B12 levels, 49 and 20%, respectively, had con-
currently elevated homocysteine levels in DPPOS year 1
and 55 and 36%, respectively, in year 9 (Table 2). A sim-
ilar pattern was seen in the placebo group.
Age was not related to vitamin B12 deficiency or vita-
min B12 levels. In the metformin group, vitamin B12 de-
ficiency increased over time in all age categories, although
the combined prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency and
borderline-low vitamin B12 levels remained stable (Sup-
plemental Data). In the placebo group, vitamin B12 defi-
ciency also increased over time in all age categories, as did
the combined prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency and
borderline-low vitamin B12 levels. Median vitamin B12
levels remained stable over time. In each age category
(�60, 60–69, and 70 years or older), median vitamin B12
levels were consistently lower in the metformin group
compared to placebo, and the prevalence of vitamin B12
deficiency or combined borderline-low/vitamin B12 defi-
ciency was consistently higher in the metformin group
compared to placebo (Supplemental Data).
Risk of vitamin B12 deficiency based on total
metformin exposure
In both metformin and placebo treatment arms, total
metformin-years of exposure was the only significant pre-
dictor of vitamin B12 deficiency in a multivariate logistic
model including age, sex, baseline BMI, diabetes status,
weight change, and prescription acid suppression use. The
odds ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with vi-
tamin B12 deficiency per year of total metformin use was
1.11 (1.03–1.20) in year 9 in metformin participants and
1.19 (1.07–1.32) in placebo participants (Table 3). In the
metformin and placebo participants combined, the odds
ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with vitamin
B12 deficiency per year of metformin use was 1.13 (1.06–
1.20) after adjustment for the confounders listed above as
well as treatment assignment.
Associated risks of vitamin B12 deficiency: anemia
and neuropathy
As shown in Figure 1, the presence of anemia was not
different across vitamin B12 categories at DPPOS year 1.
There were nonsignificant increases in anemia in each of
the vitamin B12 level groups at DPPOS year 9 (P � .25) in
the metformin group, perhaps related to the longer expo-
suretometformin.NotethatinDPPOSyear9,anemiawas
assessed only in participants actively taking study-pro-
vided metformin.
Long-term follow-up (DPPOS year 9) showed statisti-
cally significantly higher prevalence of neuropathy (ab-
normal monofilament examination) among metformin
group participants with low vitamin B12 levels compared
to those with normal or borderline vitamin B12 levels (P �
.03). This finding, however, was based on a very small
number of cases of neuropathy (n � 13 of the 56 met-
formin participants with low vitamin B12 at DPPOS year
9). Review of MNSI questionnaire and examination data
showed no difference in neuropathy symptoms or total
MNSI score by B12 levels in the metformin or placebo
groups at either time point (data not shown).

 Discussion
In this analysis of vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels in
the DPP/DPPOS cohort, we report an increased risk of low
vitamin B12 levels with long-term treatment with met-
formin. At 13 years since randomization, and controlling
for age, sex, baseline BMI, prescription acid suppression
therapy, diabetes status, and weight change, there was a
13% increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency per year of
total metformin use. Homocysteine levels were likewise
increased in the groups with low or borderline-low vita-
min B12 levels, supporting the presence of vitamin B12
deficiency at the tissue level.
Furthermore, in those treated with metformin com-
pared to placebo, there was a greater prevalence of anemia
at a mean 5 years after randomization. Interestingly, vi-
tamin B12 deficiency was seen even in the absence of ane-
mia. Peripheral neuropathy, a significant clinical conse-
quence of B12 deficiency, was higher among metformin
group participants with low B12, although the number of
cases was small.
Although this report represents a post hoc analysis, the
potential for development of B12 deficiency was recog-
nized in the design of the study, and hematological pa-
rametersweremonitoredforthisreason.Furthermore,the
population studied and duration of exposure to met-
formin offer distinct strengths to the analysis. This is the
largest cohort to date in which B12 levels and metformin
exposure have been reported. Furthermore, with a mean
follow-up of 13 years at the time of sample collection, the
DPP/DPPOS represents the longest duration of random-
ized metformin exposure and vitamin B12 assessments in
any population. Most other studies evaluating metformin
and vitamin B12 deficiency have been conducted in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes (19–21), with smaller studies
evaluating vitamin B12 levels in patients with gestational
diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome (22–25). Of note,
the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in the placebo
group at 5 years of follow-up (2.4%) is comparable to the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) report of the prevalence of biochemical vita-
min B12 deficiency in individuals with type 2 diabetes not
using metformin (2.4%), and the prevalence of vitamin
B12deficiencyinourmetformingroup(4.3%)wassimilar
to that seen in the NHANES cross-sectional evaluation of
individuals with type 2 diabetes using metformin (5.8%)
(9). Furthermore, cross-sectional studies report a wide
range of prevalence of biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency
with metformin exposure, ranging from 5.8% to as high
as 30% (2, 7–9, 31, 32). Detailed prospective character-
ization of metformin exposure, with adjustment for var-
ious contributors to vitamin B12 deficiency such as we
were able to do in this analysis, may allow a more accurate
risk assessment.
Therearesomelimitationsworthnoting.AlthoughB12
status was assessed indirectly via annual hemoglobin and
hematocrit testing, vitamin B12 levels were measured post
hocfromsamplesobtainedinDPPOSyears1and9.Stored
serum samples from other time points, including DPP
baseline, were not available, and potentially informative
red blood cell indices that could demonstrate the macro-
cytosis typical of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia were not
routinely obtained. In addition, after DPPOS year 1, ane-
mia was assessed only in metformin group participants
actively taking the study drug, which may limit our ability

 to accurately define the relationship between vitamin B12
status and anemia. Furthermore, anemia detected on an-
nual screening may have resulted in evaluation and treat-
ment of B12 deficiency outside of the study, thus reducing
the apparent frequency of metformin-associated B12 de-
ficiency. This seems to have been an infrequent occur-
rence,however,giventhatsofewparticipantsreportedthe
use of prescription (injectable) B12, which is standard
therapy for B12 deficiency. Finally, information about the
use of over-the-counter vitamin supplements was not col-
lected during the study.
There is significant debate about the clinical signifi-
cance of biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency vs true tissue
deficiency. In our cohort, approximately 50% of partici-
pants with low vitamin B12 levels had concurrently ele-
vated homocysteine levels, suggesting true tissue defi-
ciency. However, measurement of additional markers,
such as holotranscobalamin, methylmalonic acid, red
blood cell-B12, and plasma concentrations of methylation
indices, for example, would provide a more comprehen-
sive assessment of true deficiency; they are beyond the
scope of our study, and appropriate samples for perform-
ing these assays are not available (33). Others have sug-
gested that metformin treatment actually improves intra-
cellular metabolism of vitamin B12, despite low serum
levels. In a rodent model, metformin treatment resulted in
increased liver accumulation of vitamin B12, thereby de-
creasing circulating vitamin B12 levels, suggesting that
metformin alters tissue distribution and metabolism of
vitamin B12, rather than causing true deficiency (24, 34).
Vitamin B12 deficiency associated with metformin use
is thought to occur due to vitamin B12 malabsorption.
Initialtheoriesincludedalterationofbileacidmetabolism,
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or effects on in-
trinsic factor secretion, but a more currently accepted
explanation is the interference by metformin on calcium-
dependent membrane action responsible for vitamin B12-
intrinsic factor absorption in the terminal ileum (1, 35–
38). The use of proton pump inhibitors is also thought to
contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency (39), although this
does not appear to be a factor in our analysis (Table 1).
Our finding of a higher prevalence of monofilament-
defined neuropathy in metformin-treated participants
with low vitamin B12 levels should be viewed with cau-
tion, given the small number of neuropathy cases among
those with low vitamin B12 levels (n � 13), which was also
not confirmed by the MNSI. There have been case reports
of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency presenting
as peripheral neuropathy, with evidence suggesting that
prolongedexposure(12–15years)mayberequiredforthis
to occur (38). In a prospective case control study of dia-
betic patients referred for treatment of symptomatic pe-
ripheral neuropathy, metformin-treated patients had
lower vitamin B12 levels and elevated methylmalonic acid
and homocysteine levels, along with clinical and electro-
physiological evidence of more severe peripheral neurop-
athy (13). Furthermore, cumulative metformin dose cor-
related strongly with the differences seen. In contrast, in a
retrospective review, metformin use did not predict the
risk of anemia or neuropathy, despite finding that met-
formin use was associated with biochemical vitamin B12
deficiency (4).
Despite the accumulating evidence associating met-
formin exposure to low vitamin B12 levels, as well as po-
tential clinical sequelae, assessment of B12 levels in indi-
viduals treated with metformin has not been incorporated
into clinical practice guidelines. Evidence suggests that
such monitoring is rarely performed (40).
Given that metformin is widely recommended as a first-
line agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the growing
populationofindividualswhoreceivemetforminforother
indications (including high risk of diabetes, gestational
diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome), and the chronic na-
ture of treatment of these conditions, understanding the
potential adverse consequences of metformin treatment is
essential. Long-term follow-up data from DPP/DPPOS
support the evidence that metformin is associated with
vitamin B12 deficiency, and routine measurement of vi-
tamin B12 for metformin-treated individuals should be
considered.
