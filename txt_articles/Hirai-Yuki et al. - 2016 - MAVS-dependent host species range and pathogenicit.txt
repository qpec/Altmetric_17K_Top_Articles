Abstract
Although hepatotropic viruses are important causes of human disease, the intrahepatic immune 
response to hepatitis viruses is poorly understood due to a lack of tractable small animal models. 
Here we describe a murine model of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection that recapitulates critical 
features of type A hepatitis in humans. We demonstrate that the capacity of HAV to evade MAVS-
mediated type I interferon responses defines its host species range. HAV-induced liver injury was 
associated with interferon-independent intrinsic hepatocellular apoptosis and hepatic inflammation 
that unexpectedly results from MAVS and IRF3/7 signaling. This murine model thus reveals a 
previously undefined link between innate immune responses to virus infection and acute liver 
injury, providing a new paradigm for viral pathogenesis in the liver.
Although viral hepatitis is an important cause of human morbidity worldwide, there are no 
small animal models that accurately recapitulate liver disease caused by any of the five

 responsible viruses (1, 2). Previous studies have relied heavily on nonhuman primates, 
especially chimpanzees (3, 4), to investigate pathogenesis and immune responses to hepatitis 
viruses. This has handicapped efforts to understand host responses within the unique 
immunologic environment of the liver (5, 6). Recent NIH policies effectively eliminate the 
use of chimpanzees in such studies (7), intensifying the need for alternative models. Here, 
we report a murine model that recapitulates many features of human infection with hepatitis 
A virus (HAV), an hepatotropic picornavirus (genus Hepatovirus) that circulates in blood as 
quasi-enveloped, membrane-cloaked virions and is shed in feces as naked, nonenveloped 
particles (8).
Like hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses, the host range of HAV is considered 
restricted to humans and nonhuman primates (2, 9). However, successful adaptation to 
growth in murine and guinea pig cells suggests a broader host range (10, 11). Closely related 
viruses have also been discovered recently in bats, rodents, shrews and hedgehogs, with 
phylogenetic evidence suggesting past shifts among host species (12). HAV replication is 
strongly suppressed by type I interferon (IFN) (13), but HAV, like HCV, blunts interferon 
responses in human cells by expressing proteinases that degrade MAVS and TRIF, adaptor 
molecules involved in induction of IFN (13, 14). As a result, infected chimpanzees 
demonstrate limited type I IFN responses (4). Since the sequences targeted in human MAVS 
and TRIF are not conserved in small mammals (fig. S1A), the inability of HAV to infect 
these species could stem from a failure to disrupt IFN responses.
To test this hypothesis, we intravenously inoculated Ifnar1−/−Ifngr1−/− (DKO) mice that lack 
receptors for both type I and type II IFN with wild-type human HAV (15). These mice 
proved highly permissive for infection, developing multiple features of acute hepatitis A in 
humans (4, 16): fecal HAV shedding, low-grade viremia, and elevated serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) activity (Fig. 1A). Multifocal inflammatory cell infiltrates, often 
surrounding necrotic or apoptotic hepatocytes, were present in liver 37–41 days post-
inoculation (d.p.i) and associated with HAV RNA (Fig. 1B, fig. S2A). Fecal shedding of 
infectious virus was confirmed by 3 subsequent passages in DKO mice, each leading to 
intrahepatic HAV RNA, fecal virus shedding, and elevated ALT (Fig. 1C, fig. S2B). Anti-
HAV antibodies were detectable 28 d.p.i. (fig. S3A). A fifth serial passage used 4th passage 
liver extract as inoculum. Unlike non-enveloped virions present in feces (density ~1.23 
gm/cm3) (8), ~65% of liver-derived virus was membrane-associated (~1.11 gm/cm3) (fig. 
S4). This inoculum rapidly induced ALT elevation with impressive fecal shedding and 
intrahepatic HAV RNA abundance (Fig. 1C,D).
Like DKO mice, Ifnar1−/− animals shed virus and developed ALT elevation when challenged 
with liver-derived virus, whereas type II IFN receptor Ifngr1−/− knockouts and wild-type 
(WT) mice showed no evidence of infection (Fig. 1D,E). The rapid induction of disease in 
this experiment, compared with slower onset in early DKO passages (Fig. 1A), resulted from 
a higher inoculum titer rather than viral adaptation to mice. Only a single nonsynonymous 
nucleotide substitution occurred in the viral sequence over 4 mouse passages (table S1). 
Infection persisted in Ifnar1−/− and DKO mice for over 3 months (Fig. 1D). Declining serum 
ALT and fecal virus shedding over this period of time suggested slow immune control in 
both types of mice, but histopathologic lesions persisted throughout (fig. S2C). As in

 chimpanzees (4), HAV RNA copy numbers remained high in liver after fecal virus shedding 
had terminated (Fig. 1E,F).
These data suggest that the capacity of HAV to evade type I IFN responses defines its host 
range. However, DKO mice were resistant to challenge with either fecal or liver-derived 
virus administered by oral gavage, possibly reflecting a greater role for type III IFN in the 
gut (17, 18), or absence of an essential receptor. Rag1−/− and NSG mice lacking adaptive 
immunity were resistant to intravenous virus challenge (Fig. 2A and fig. S5A), further 
highlighting the importance of innate immunity in control of HAV. Since HAV-encoded 
proteinases disrupt IFN responses by degrading human MAVS and TRIF (13, 14), we 
challenged Mavs−/− and Trif−/− mice to ascertain whether signaling through these adaptor 
molecules restricts replication. Mavs−/− mice were highly permissive for HAV, shedding 10-
fold more virus than DKO or Ifnar1−/− mice (Fig. 2A), whereas Trif−/− mice were 
nonpermissive (Fig. 2A and fig. S5B,C). Thus, MAVS-mediated type I IFN responses block 
HAV replication in WT mice. Consistent with this, HAV 3ABC, a proteinase that degrades 
MAVS in human cells (13), does not cleave murine MAVS (fig. S1B).
Intrahepatic HAV RNA copy numbers were 10-fold higher in Mavs−/− mice than Ifnar1−/− 
mice (Fig. 2B), with the majority of Mavs−/− hepatocytes containing HAV RNA (fig. S5D–
E, table S2). Nonetheless, Mavs−/− mice developed neither ALT elevation (Fig. 2C) nor 
hepatic inflammation (Fig. 2D). Immunohistochemical staining for activated caspase 3 (Fig. 
2D) and TUNEL assays (fig. S6A) revealed numerous apoptotic hepatocytes in infected 
Ifnar1−/− liver, but none in Mavs−/− tissue. Apoptotic cells in Ifnar1−/− and DKO mice were 
surrounded by inflammatory infiltrates in proximity to cells containing HAV RNA (Fig. 2D, 
fig. S6B). Both caspase 8 and 9 (and caspase 3) activities were slightly increased in infected 
DKO and Ifnar1−/− liver (fig. S6C), but cleaved caspase was not detected in immunoblots as 
only ~1% of hepatocytes were apoptotic (fig. S6D). These data show that apoptosis and 
inflammation results from a MAVS-dependent but IFN-independent mechanism. MAVS-
mediated apoptosis has been recognized previously, but its role in vivo is uncertain (19, 20).
Virus was largely restricted to the liver in Mavs−/− mice: HAV genomes were 400-fold less 
abundant in spleen and 1000-fold less in lung (Fig. 2E). Viral RNA was more abundant in 
spleens of Ifnar1−/− mice, possibly reflecting sequestration of virus released from damaged 
hepatocytes. Little virus was present in ileum or colon of either knockout, indicating that 
fecal shedding originates in the liver, as in primates (21, 22). Thus, HAV is highly 
hepatotropic in mice. Viral shedding persisted unabated for 56 days in Mavs−/− mice with 
only minimal ALT increases (Fig. 2F, fig. S6E). Rare, isolated apoptotic hepatocytes were 
observed in only 2 of 5 mice 63 d.p.i. The appearance of anti-HAV antibody was delayed in 
Mavs−/− mice (fig. S3B), but virus neutralizing activities were comparable to Ifnar1−/− mice 
63 d.p.i..
Irf3−/− and Irf7−/− mice lack transcription factors downstream of MAVS that drive type I IFN 
expression (23). These mice supported only limited HAV replication, whereas Irf3−/−Irf7−/− 
double knockouts shed virus and accumulated intrahepatic HAV RNA levels equivalent to 
Mavs−/− or Ifnar1−/− mice (Fig. 2A, fig. S5A, and table S2). This is consistent with 
redundant roles for IRF3 and IRF7 in control of flaviviruses (24, 25). Serum ALT elevations

 were minimal in infected Irf3−/−, Irf7−/−, and Irf3−/−Irf7−/− mice (Fig. 2C and fig. S7A). 
Irf7−/− and Irf3−/−Irf7−/− livers contained rare apoptotic hepatocytes (fig. S7B), possibly 
reflecting activation of IRF5 (25). However, a general lack of pathology in infected 
Irf3−/−Irf7−/− animals mirrored the absence of disease in Mavs−/− mice.
Hepatocyte apoptosis is known to drive inflammation within the liver (26). The livers of 7 
d.p.i Ifnar1−/− mice showed 55- and 13-fold increases in F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages and 
NK1.1+ NK cells, whereas CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased only 3- to 5-fold (Fig. 
3A). Increases in CD3+CD4−CD8− and γ/δ T cells did not achieve statistical significance. 
Immunohistochemistry confirmed a mixed cellular infiltrate (Fig. 3B). Luminex assays 
showed increased hepatic CCL3 (MIP-α), CCL5 (RANTES), and CXCL10 (IP-10) protein, 
but not IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2 or IL-6 (Fig. 3C). Similarly, serum IFN-β was markedly 
elevated (>10 ng/ml) in infected DKO and Ifnar1−/− mice (Fig. 3D), but ELISA assays for 
IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL6 were negative. Nonetheless, RT-PCR demonstrated HAV-
induced intrahepatic transcripts for multiple cytokines and chemokines in DKO and 
Ifnar1−/−, but not Mavs−/− mice (Fig. 3E, fig. S8A). CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL5 mRNA 
responses were maximal 7 d.p.i, whereas CCL3, IFN-γ, and TNF-α mRNAs peaked 15 
d.p.i. (Fig. 3E) despite the absence of detectable protein in serum or liver. Diminishing 
chemokine and cytokine responses at 28 d.p.i. (Fig. 3E) correlated temporally with a 100-
fold decline in fecal virus shedding. NLRP3 inflammasome-related transcripts were not 
increased (fig. S8B).
IFN-β transcription is coordinately regulated by IRF3/7 and NF-κB (27). Phospho-IRF3 
confirmed IRF3 activation in infected Ifnar1−/− mice (Fig. 3F), and interferon-stimulated 
genes (ISGs) such as ISG15, IFIT1, and CXCL10 that are directly regulated by IRF3 (28) 
were induced (Figs. 3C,G,H). IRF3 similarly regulates CCL5 transcription (29), explaining 
prominent and early CCL5 expression by HAV-infected hepatocytes in Ifnar1−/− but not 
Mavs−/− mice (Fig. 3C,E, fig. S8C). The phospho-p65 component of NF-κB was not 
measurably increased (fig. S8D).
Several possible mechanisms could account for apoptosis induced through a MAVS-IRF3/7 
pathway (fig. S8E). First, CCL5 expression could recruit cytotoxic lymphocytes to the liver, 
resulting in death receptor-mediated apoptosis (30, 31). However, depletion of CD4+ or 
CD8+ T cells had no impact on acute (7 d.p.i) disease in Ifnar1−/− mice (fig. S9). Moreover, 
virus-specific T cell responses were minimal in Ifnar1−/− and Mavs−/− mice (fig. S10). 
Depletion of NK1.1+ NK cells similarly failed to reduce liver injury (fig. S11). This argues 
against primary death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Clodronate depletion of macrophages 
prior to infection also had no effect on viral replication or inflammation (fig. S12).
Alternatively, apoptosis could be induced by ISGs that are directly regulated by IRF3 (28). 
The functions of these proteins are only partly understood, but IFIT2, an ISG that is 
transcriptionally regulated by IRF3, is known to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis in human 
cells (28, 32). IRF3 similarly regulates PMAIP1, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein (33). 
Importantly, both Ifit2 and Pmaip1 transcripts were induced early and to a greater extent in 
Ifnar1−/− than Mavs−/− mice (fig. S13). IRF3 can also induce apoptosis through a 
transcription-independent mechanism involving a direct interaction with mitochondrial Bax

 (34). However, this would not explain the rare apoptotic hepatocytes observed in Irf3-
deficient mice (fig. S7B).
Although many details remain to be resolved, our data show that Ifnar1−/− mice provide a 
useful model that recapitulates many aspects of type A hepatitis in humans. Despite heroic 
efforts, such a model has proved elusive for HBV or HCV infection (2). Our results suggest 
that HAV host species range is dictated largely by its capacity to evade MAVS-mediated 
type I IFN responses, and reveal an unexpected role for MAVS signaling in virus-mediated 
liver injury. Such signaling leads to IRF3/7-dependent, but IFNα/β- and IFNγ-independent 
hepatocellular apoptosis with a secondary inflammatory response (fig. S8E). This may 
explain why HAV and HCV have evolved independently to target MAVS for degradation. 
Disrupting innate immune signaling upstream of IRF3/7 not only limits IFN-mediated 
antiviral responses, but also restricts inflammation within the liver, delays anti-viral antibody 
responses, and slows viral clearance (Figs. 2D,E fig. S3B, S6E). IRF3, activated through 
STING as a result of endoplasmic reticulum stress, has been implicated recently in acute 
ethanol-induced hepatitis (35), suggesting a common final pathway for toxin- and virus-
induced liver injury. Altogether, our findings establish the critical importance of innate 
immune responses in control of viral infection in the liver, and provide a paradigm for HAV 
pathogenesis that is likely relevant to other hepatotropic human viruses.
