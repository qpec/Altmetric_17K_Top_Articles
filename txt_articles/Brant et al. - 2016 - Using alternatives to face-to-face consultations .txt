 INTRODUCTION
The need to address the issue of increasing 
demands on primary care, and to serve 
populations in remote areas, has prompted 
the consideration of alternative methods 
to provide consultations, such as email 
or internet video (for example, Skype™) in 
Europe, the US, and Australia.1–4 General 
practice in the UK is under increasing 
pressure to improve access to patients 
to address the rise of patient demand 
within a limited capacity. Several initiatives 
utilising information and communications 
technologies have been introduced with a 
view to reducing GP workload; for example, 
telephone triage.5 A recent document 
outlining government proposals6 suggested 
that the introduction of alternative methods 
to provide consultations, such as email or 
internet video (for example, Skype™), could 
improve the current provision of primary care 
in the UK. The Prime Minister’s Challenge 
Fund (PMCF) has provided financial 
incentives to implement such technologies in 
England.7 The underlying assumptions that 
drive this rhetoric relate to convenience and 
accessibility for patients, and an efficient use 
of practitioners’ time.8,9
Despite this rhetoric about how such an 
approach may improve access and efficiency 
there is little evidence to support the claims. 
Evidence to date has assessed the potential 
impact of some alternatives on clinical 
outcomes.10,11 Although trial evidence is poor, 
observational data has pointed towards some 
clinical benefit, such as improved outcomes 
for those with diabetes and hypertension,12 
and better monitoring of health concerns,13 
at least in market driven health systems. 
Studies have sought opinions from patients 
and healthcare professionals on whether and 
how they would use these alternatives14,15 but 
these data have been based on hypothetical 
opinions rather than experience. Although 
professional bodies are making tentative 
steps towards embracing some of the newer 
technologies16–18 practitioners are generally 
more sceptical,19–22 reflecting uncertainty 
arising from a lack of evidence in the general 
practice setting and wider concerns about 
general practice workload.
The aim of this survey was to identify 
the frequency and range of ways in which 
general practice teams in five areas of the UK 
were providing alternatives to face-to-face 
consultations, or had plans to do so in the 
future. This information was used to identify 
potential practices for a focused ethnographic 
study which is currently underway.
METHOD
A postal survey was sent to all practice 
managers, GP partners, and salaried GPs 
(n = 2719) at all the practices in and around 
Bristol, Oxford, Lothian, and the Highlands 
and Islands of Scotland (n = 421). These 
Abstract
Background
The ubiquitous use of communication 
technologies has led to an expectation that a 
similar approach should extend to health care. 
Despite considerable rhetoric about the need for 
general practices to offer alternatives to face-
to-face consultations, such as telephone, email, 
and internet video consultations, the extent to 
which such technologies are actually used at 
present is unclear
.
Aim
The aim of the survey was to identify the 
frequency and range of ways in which general 
practices are providing (or planning) alternatives 
to face-to-face consultations.
Design and setting
A postal survey of practices around Bristol, 
Oxford, Lothian, the Highlands, and the Western 
Isles of Scotland. 
Method
A postal questionnaire survey was sent to 
each of the GPs and practice managers of 421 
practices between January and May 2015.
Results
A response was received from 319/421 practices 
(76%). Although the majority of the practices 
reported that they were conducting telephone 
consultations frequently (n = 211/318, 66%), 
fewer were implementing email consultations 
(n = 18/318, 6%), and most (n = 169/318, 
53%) had no plans to introduce this. None 
were currently using internet video, and 86% 
(n = 273/318) had no plans to introduce internet 
video consultations. These findings were 
repeated in the reported use of alternatives 
to face-to-face consultations at an individual 
GP level. Optional free text responses were 
completed by 28% of responders, and offered an 
explanation for the (often perceived) barriers and 
incentives for implementation.
Conclusion
Despite policy pressure to introduce 
consultations by email and internet video, 
there is a general reluctance among GPs 
to implement alternatives to face-to-face 
consultations. This identifies a substantial gap 
between rhetoric and reality in terms of the 
likelihood of certain alternatives (email, video) 
changing practice in the near future.

Using alternatives to face-to-face consultations:
a survey of prevalence and attitudes in general practice 
Research
e460  British Journal of General Practice, July 2016 
 areas were selected to represent diversity 
in terms of practice demographics: from 
urban to rural, inner city to remote, and 
from affluent to deprived locations, including 
practices in England that benefited from the 
PMCF funding. Replies within 3 weeks of 
receipt were entered into a draw to win an 
iPad Air®.
The single page survey opened with 
questions about the age and sex of the 
responder, followed by two groups of 
questions. In one group, participants were 
asked whether their practice currently 
provided, or planned to provide, consultations 
with patients via email or electronic 
messaging, internet video, or telephone. 
The survey asked participants about the use 
of bookable telephone consultations (not 
including triage calls or brief messages) so 
as to focus on the use of the telephone to 
replace face-to-face consultations, not as 
an initial assessment of urgency. Telephone 
triage is being assessed in more detail in 
another concurrent research project.23 In 
the other group of questions, participants 
were asked how often they personally 
conducted consultations using each of these 
approaches. Each question in both groups 
was scored on a 5-point Likert scale. The 
questionnaire closed with the opportunity 
for responders to add information ‘about any 
interesting or unusual ways in which you use 
these different approaches’ in a free text box 
(Appendix 1). 
Practices within the English study sites 
were identified through the relevant clinical 
commissioning groups’ websites. For the 
practices in Scotland, details were retrieved 
from the Information Services Division: 
ISD Scotland website. Information about 
the practice managers, GP partners, and 
salaried GPs were accessed via the practice 
website if one existed. For those practices 
without a website (53/421, 13%), the 
information was gained through a telephone 
call to the practice. 
The questionnaires were posted to each 
of the practice managers, GP partners, and 
salaried GPs, with the aim of receiving at 
least one response from each practice. If no 
response had been received after a period of 
2 weeks, a postal reminder was sent to all 
the GPs and the practice manager within the 
practice, and 2 weeks after this a telephone 
reminder was made, if appropriate, to the 
practice manager
. 
The primary analysis was at a practice 
level, with analysis of GPs’ personal use 
of alternative forms of consultation at 
an individual level. Numerical data were 
analysed using simple statistical methods 
supported by Excel 2013 and Stata 
(version 13.1).  When different responses 
were given by responders within the same 
practice the authors used the mean result 
at practice level, rounding to the nearest 
whole number
. The authors explored the 
extent of variation in response by different 
individuals within the same practice using 
the within-practice standard deviation (SD) 
and the intraclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC). Responses regarding GPs’ own use 
of alternatives to face-to-face consultation 
were analysed at individual responder level, 
and responses from practice managers 
were excluded from these analyses. 
The results from the free text box were 
analysed thematically using QSR NVivo 
(version 10) and a visual mind-mapping 
approach to examining groupings and 
patterns in the data.24

How this fits in
Introducing alternatives to face-to-face 
consultations in primary care has been 
proposed as a solution to the increased 
demands faced in general practice. 
Politicians, and patients when asked, 
tend to be keen, but professional bodies 
and practitioners are sceptical. This study 
highlights that although the majority of 
practices offer telephone consultations on 
a frequent basis, most use email for direct 
patient care very infrequently, and very few 
use internet video for consultations with 
patients. In addition, the majority do not 
plan to implement these methods in the 
future. Despite strongly expressed views 
about the pros and cons of alternative 
forms of consultation, these are largely 
speculative.

 of practices in England and 156/235 (66%) 
of practices in Scotland responded, giving 
an overall practice response rate of 76% 
(n = 319/421). In addition, 40% of English and 
25% of Scottish surveys were returned, with 
an overall individual response rate of 33% 
(n = 889/2719). The number of responses per 
practice ranged from 1–11.
Profile of responders
Participating practices were larger (in 
terms of numbers of registered patients 
and doctors per practice) than those 
who did not participate. There were no 
significant differences between practices 
in their deprivation score (Table 1). Of the 
696 responders who reported their sex, 
59% (413/696) were female. Responders 
categorised their ages as: 25–34 years 
(n = 90/889, 10%); 35–44 years (n = 239/889, 
27%); 45–54 years (n = 362/889, 41%); 
and ≥55 years (n = 189/889, 21%). Of 
all responses, 12% (105/889) came from 
practice managers, and 88% (784/889) from 
doctors. 
The current and planned use of 
alternatives to face-to-face consultations 
at practice level
Although the majority of practices reported 
routinely offering telephone consultations, 
few 
(6%) 
currently 
provided 
email 
consultations (Table 2). More than half of 
practices had no plans to introduce email 
consultations in future, although 20% 
stated that they intended to do so. None of 
the responder practices reported offering 
internet video consultations and very few 
reported any plans to do so in future. There 
was also evidence that 21% of practices 
had previously offered email, and that 10% 
had previously offered internet video, but 
that they had subsequently withdrawn these 
services.
There was some disagreement between 
responders within the same practice about 
their practices’ use of telephone (within-
practice SD 0.91; ICC 0.53) or email 
consultations (SD 1.1; ICC 0.39). There was 
less variation between responders about 
their practices’ use of video consultation 
(SD 0.52; ICC 0.20), related to the very limited 
use of these consultations in general.
The current provision of alternatives to 
face-to-face consultations at an individual 
GP level
The majority of GPs reported personally 
providing telephone consultations most or 
every working day (79%). Only 8% reported 
providing email consultations most or every 
working day, 45% did so rarely or sometimes, 
and just under half (47%) never provide email 
consultations. Furthermore, 99% stated that 
they never conduct consultations via internet 
video (Table 3).

Thematic analysis of free-text
All responders were invited to complete a 
free text box to ‘Highlight any interesting 
or unusual ways in which you use these 
different approaches as an alternative to 
face-to-face consulting,’ and 249/889 (28%) 
of the responses included some form of 
free text. 
Rather than answering the question posed, 
the majority of the responders described 
their views (usually resistance) on the idea 
of introducing email or video consultations. 
Only a few opinions were related to actual 
experience, although this did not prevent 
objections from being strongly expressed, 
for example:
‘Only politicians and the naive would think 
this a good idea.’
Concerns expressed included the view 
that adopting email or video consultation 
would be inefficient for the practice, would 
increase demand, would be a challenge 
in terms of privacy and confidentiality, and 
would increase clinical risk, with medicolegal 
consequences. A few GPs had experience 
of some vulnerable and older people who 
preferred alternative consultation methods, 
while others thought that these same groups 
would be disadvantaged. Practical issues, 
such as the reliance on appropriate internet 
provision and broadband reliability, the 
financial outlay, and local concerns about 
information governance, were mentioned as 
further barriers to implementation (Box 1). 
A few responders mentioned experience 
of benefits, such as patients being able to 
send pictures of a transient rash or an audio 
file of a child’s cough, or those who preferred 
to use email because of communication 
difficulties or disabilities that made it difficult 
to get to the surgery. Some also mentioned 
using email with particular ‘selected’ 
patients, and being in email contact with 
their own GPs (Box 2). 
DISCUSSION
Summary
The findings from this survey suggest that, 
although most practices offer telephone 
consultations on a frequent basis, email is 
used infrequently and very few have ever used 
internet video for consultations with patients. 
In addition, 10% of the responders said that 
their practice had tried video consultations 
but had now stopped. Furthermore, 
few practices plan to implement these 
consultation methods in the future. This 
same picture is replicated in the individual 
responses. Moreover, these findings remain 
constant regardless of responders’ age, sex, 
or region (data not shown). 
Despite the policy pressure to introduce 
consultations by email and internet video, 
there is little actual use of these, and a 
general reluctance among GPs to implement 
alternatives to face-to-face consultations. 
The survey and free text responses underline 
that both the reluctance and enthusiasm for 
these alternatives are mainly speculative and 
reflect the fears of the profession around their 
burgeoning workload. The limited responses 
Box 1. Free-text quotes that are illustrative of the concerns 
identified relating to the introduction of alternatives to face-to-face 
consultations
Concerns for GPs
• Increased access:
 ‘Increasing access options increases GP stress :(‘ 
 ‘Email is a nightmare — access all the time, and hundreds of emails.’
• Increase clinical risk:
  
‘It’s a personal preference, but I find the increased access too intrusive and increases risk of information 
getting lost/filed with other documents.’
  
‘We have discussed use of email communication but find there is a risk of emails not being acted upon 
when certain GPs are on leave, leading to unnecessary risk and delay.’
  
‘I feel the level of risk with these are higher than a face-to-face or phone.’
Concerns for practices
• Increased workload:
  
‘If we take on email consultations, we will have possibly hundreds of emails. Who will deal with them? …
medicolegal consequences of delay. We have no capacity. This will possibly increase workload.’
  
‘We already get more than 100 emails EACH daily. This would open the floodgates and we would drown. It 
is unmanageable.’
• Privacy and confidentiality:
  
‘Issue with confidentiality using email.’
  
‘Query issues with medicolegal problems and confidentiality.’
• Challenge of technology:
  
‘Internet connection currently barely up to current software requirements for e-referrals etc. Don’t have 
software and hardware capacity for more modern techniques.’
Concerns around patients
• Disadvantage certain groups, such as the older people:
  
‘Concern that most vulnerable (deaf/blind/elderly/demented/mentally ill) least able to access, and so 
unintentionally disadvantaged.’
  
‘Very elderly population — technology difficult.’
Box 2. Free-text quotes that are illustrative of the benefits 
identified relating to the introduction of alternatives to face-to-face 
consultations
Benefits for GPs
• Used to support the face-to-face consultation:
  
‘I think patients using media  — for example, bringing in photos of their transient rashes, or recordings of 
their babies cough — are great.’
  
‘In combination with phone consult (and with consent), I have got patients to text me photos of problem — for 
example, rash, eye inflammation — to help confirm diagnosis or whether need to be seen etc.’
  
‘Would be good to do one way doc–patient communications instead of letters.’
Benefits for practices
• Workload management:
  
‘We encourage patients to use email to send info to us (stops clogging up the phone lines).’
Benefits for patients
• Advantage for those with physical or communication difficulties:
  
‘I use email for one patient who has MND [motor neurone disease] and so cannot speak on phone.’
  
‘Email really helpful for deaf patients (who sometimes send me an email before attending a consultation to 
save time), and for tracheostomy patients.’

 to the free-text element of the survey are 
indicative of wider concerns. They match 
what is reported in the existing literature and 
are being explored in depth in a forthcoming 
focused ethnography.
 
Strengths and limitations
This appears to be the first survey designed 
to assess the use, and planned use, of 
alternatives to face-to-face consultation 
in primary care. In this postal survey of 
general practice in five areas of England 
and Scotland the authors obtained at least 
one response from a high proportion of 
practices (76%). These practices appeared to 
be representative of all practices approached 
in terms of size, region, and deprivation. The 
large number of practices represented in 
this survey is a strength of this study. The use 
of free text comments, as well as the closed 
questions of the survey, has added to the 
understanding of GPs’ concerns, but such 
data are limited in comparison with other 
qualitative methods.
Areas were chosen for this survey 
to include practices with a range of 
characteristics: from urban to rural, inner 
city to remote, and from affluent to deprived 
locations. Such practices may have differing 
incentives to implement alternatives to 
face-to-face consultations, and there will 
always be local policy differences to take into 
consideration too. The authors acknowledge 
that practices in other areas of the UK may 
be using these and other alternatives to face-
to-face consultations.
Offering consultations using an alternative 
medium is controversial. Therefore it is 
possible that some responders would be 
reluctant to admit to using email or internet 
video. Furthermore, there is a risk of a 
response bias, particularly with the free text 
responses. Those who respond may have 
a particular standpoint on the subject of 
enquiry.25 As such, the authors acknowledge 
that the findings from this survey may not 
necessarily be generalisable, although 
they offer an insight into the current use of 
alternatives to face-to-face consultations. 
Comparison with existing literature
Although the use of alternatives to face-
to-face consultations had been recognised 
previously,26 the level of such activity 
reported in this study is less than previous 
estimates reported from surveys conducted 
in Europe.27,28 Furthermore, in contrast to 
popular belief, fewer practices offer email 
or internet video consultations than often 
envisaged.29 
In 2012, the policy of the UK Department 
of Health was for patients to be able to 
communicate electronically with their health 
and care team by 2015.30 This target has not 
been achieved, but several pilots have been 
funded by the PMCF7 which examines the 
use of email and other electronic means 
of consultation with patients. However, as 
recommended in the recent report by the 
Primary Care Workforce Commission, more 
evidence is required before email or internet 
video consultations can be recommended as 
a routine part of primary care.31
This research identified that some 
responders felt the need to resist a perceived 
pressure to adopt alternative approaches 
to consultations that have been claimed to 
have a potentially transformative impact on 
general practice.5 This is despite proposed 
advantages in terms of access and resource 
use,29 particularly as the use of the web, 
telephone, or text would be a natural 
development based on their use in other 
spheres of life.32 The free-text responses 
revealed concerns about the perceived risks 
to patients, the organisation, and practice 
staff. This finding echoes the concerns voiced 
in recent surveys of GPs’ attitudes towards 
the use of alternatives to face-to-face 
consultations.16,19,22 Similarly, the concern 
found in the literature about how  and when to 
use alternatives to face-to-face consultations 
was upheld.20,21 However, 21% of practices 
reported having tried using email, and 10% 
using internet video, despite a general 
antipathy towards their introduction, and had 
since reduced such use. This may provide 
support for these concerns. There were also 
a few positive accounts of experiences and 
an acknowledgement of when, how, and for 
whom these alternatives may be beneficial, 
reflecting previously reported findings.11,20,33
Implications for research and practice
Due to the limited use of email or internet 
video within the responder group, in keeping 
with previous literature, the concerns listed 
are based primarily on perception and 
anecdote.21 This general reluctance to adopt 
alternatives to face-to-face consultations 
is therefore unlikely to change without a 
change in policy. As recommended in the 
recent report by the Primary Care Workforce 
Commission, more evidence is required 
before email or internet video consultations 
can be recommended as a routine part of 
primary care.31 
This survey is the precursor to a focused 
ethnographic study of practices who either 
currently offer, are about to introduce, or 
have ceased to offer, an alternative method of 
consultation. This will focus on experiences 
and opinions when use is realised and not 
hypothesised.
