Summary
Postoperative pulmonary complications are common after cardiothoracic surgery and are associated with adverse
outcomes. The ability to detect postoperative pulmonary complications using chest X-rays is limited, and this
technique requires radiation exposure. Little is known about the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound for the detec-
tion of postoperative pulmonary complications after cardiothoracic surgery, and we therefore aimed to compare lung
ultrasound with chest X-ray to detect postoperative pulmonary complications in this group of patients. We performed
this prospective, observational, single-centre study in a tertiary intensive care unit treating adult patients who had
undergone cardiothoracic surgery. We recorded chest X-ray findings upon admission and on postoperative days 2 and
3, as well as rates of postoperative pulmonary complications and clinically-relevant postoperative pulmonary compli-
cations that required therapy according to the treating physician as part of their standard clinical practice. Lung ultra-
sound was performed by an independent researcher at the time of chest X-ray. We compared lung ultrasound with
chest X-ray for the detection of postoperative pulmonary complications and clinically-relevant postoperative
pulmonary complications. We also assessed inter-observer agreement for lung ultrasound, and the time to perform
both imaging techniques. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the time to detection of clinically-relevant
postoperative pulmonary complications by both modalities. We recruited a total of 177 patients in whom both lung
ultrasound and chest X-ray imaging were performed. Lung ultrasound identified 159 (90%) postoperative pulmonary
complications on the day of admission compared with 107 (61%) identified with chest X-ray (p < 0.001). Lung
ultrasound identified 11 out of 17 patients (65%) and chest X-ray 7 out of 17 patients (41%) with clinically-relevant
postoperative pulmonary complications (p < 0.001). The clinically-relevant postoperative pulmonary complications
were detected earlier using lung ultrasound compared with chest X-ray (p = 0.024). Overall inter-observer agreement
for lung ultrasound was excellent (j = 0.907, p < 0.001). Following cardiothoracic surgery, lung ultrasound detected
more postoperative pulmonary complications and clinically-relevant postoperative pulmonary complications than
chest X-ray, and at an earlier time-point. Our results suggest lung ultrasound may be used as the primary imaging
technique to search for postoperative pulmonary complications after cardiothoracic surgery, and will enhance bedside
decision making.

Introduction
Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), inclu-
ding atelectasis, pneumonia and pulmonary oedema, are
common after cardiothoracic surgery, and are associated
with adverse outcomes [1–3]. Early recognition of PPCs
might be important for intervention and/or monitoring,
as these patients often have compromised physiological
reserves. The time from surgery until PPC detection is
approximately three days using the most commonly
used diagnostics such as chest auscultation, chest X-ray
(CXR), arterial oxygen tension, PaO₂/FIO₂ (P/F) ratio,
leucocyte count and temperature [4]. Chest X-ray
remains the current standard diagnostic imaging tech-
nique to detect PPCs in the intensive care unit (ICU)
setting [5, 6]. However, the diagnostic accuracy of CXR
is limited, and CXR requires radiation exposure and
considerable costs [6].
Bedside lung ultrasound, an alternative imaging
modality
with
high
sensitivity
and
specificity,
is
increasingly used for the diagnosis of pulmonary
pathology in the ICU. Lung ultrasound is without the
downside of radiation exposure, and creates distinctive
artefacts through the interplay between fluid, air and
pleurae [7]. Combinations of these artefacts can help
differentiate between various pathological processes,
and are combined and deciphered in the bedside lung
ultrasound in emergency (BLUE) protocol. In the
BLUE protocol, profiles have been designed for the
main pulmonary complications (pneumonia; conges-
tive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease
(COPD);
asthma;
pulmonary
embolism;
and
pneumothorax) have been validated with an accuracy
> 90%, and are therefore extensively used in daily crit-
ical care [8]. For example, the lung sliding artefact,
which is a ‘twinkling’ visible at the pleural line during
inspiration, excludes a pneumothorax and is part of
the definition of a normal lung surface (see also Sup-
porting Information, Video S1). A-lines are the main
horizon artefact and represent a reverberation of the
pleural line, indicating air at the pleural line. B-lines
are the result of many to-and-fro movements of ultra-
sound beams between air and fluid, generating this
long, vertical hyperechoic artefact (see also Supporting
Information, Fig. S1). More than two anterior B-lines
are pathological; this is the definition of a B-profile in
the BLUE protocol, indicating interstitial syndrome or
pulmonary oedema. Furthermore, detection of pleural
effusions and consolidation are part of the postero-
lateral alveolar and/or pleural syndrome (PLAPS) (see
also Supporting Information, Fig. S2). At the PLAPS-
point, a disorder can be described when an anechoic
pleural effusion is visible or a disorder within the lung
tissue is seen; for example, a shredded deep border
immediately indicates lung consolidation [8].
Cardiac ultrasound has been shown to be valuable
in
the
peri-operative
assessment
and
therapeutic
management of patients undergoing surgery [9]. In
non-cardiothoracic surgery patients, lung ultrasound
performed better than CXR in diagnosing pneumonia,
pulmonary oedema, pneumothorax and pleural effu-
sion [10–13]. Until now, however, there have been
limited data available for the diagnostic value of lung
ultrasound in cardiothoracic surgical patients. In addi-
tion, it has to date been unknown whether repeated
lung ultrasound is able to detect PPCs at an earlier
stage compared with routine CXR. The primary out-
come measure of this study was to compare the per-
formance of lung ultrasound with CXR in detecting
PPCs and clinically-relevant PPCs, defined as PPCs
that required treatment, after cardiothoracic surgery.
We hypothesised that lung ultrasound would detect
more PPCs and clinically-relevant PPCs than CXR. Sec-
ondary outcome measures were to evaluate the time to
detection of clinically-relevant PPCs by lung ultrasound
and CXR, and to assess the relationship between lung
ultrasound findings and outcome measures.

 Methods
We conducted this prospective, observational cohort
study at the VU University Medical Center Amster-
dam, a tertiary referral hospital. The local Human Sub-
jects Committee of the VUmc approved the study and
waived the requirement for informed consent. We
included consecutive adult patients (≥ 18 years old)
who had undergone cardiothoracic surgery between
April 2015 and January 2016 upon their admission to
the ICU. Patients were not included if there was no
investigator
available
to
perform
lung
ultrasound
examination upon ICU admission. Cardiothoracic pro-
cedures included coronary artery bypass grafting and/
or valve surgery, Bentall procedures or pulmonary
endarterectomy. All patients admitted to the ICU had
their tracheas intubated and were sedated following sur-
gery. Their tracheas were extubated according to local
protocol, followed by the administration of supplemen-
tal oxygen via nasal cannulae. Monitoring, including
pulse oximetry, heart rate, electrocardiographic, invasive
blood pressure and CXR, was performed according to
standard clinical practice.
Anteroposterior bedside CXRs were obtained using
a DRX-Revolution mobile X-ray unit (Carestream
Health, Inc. © Toronto, ON, Canada) upon admission
to the ICU, and at postoperative days two and three,
according to local protocol. We retrieved CXR find-
ings, assessed by a radiologist blinded to the lung
ultrasound findings, from the electronic patient data
management system. The Nomenclature Committee of
the Fleischner Society recommended terminology was
used to describe pathological entities according to the
diagnostic criteria for bedside CXR [14, 15].
A trained member of the research team (n = 5),
which consisted of two investigators, one ICU physi-
cian and two intensivists, performed lung ultrasound
upon admission to the ICU on day 0, and at postoper-
ative days two and three. All ultrasonographers were
trained according to the Netherlands Society of Inten-
sive Care Programme for Intensive Care Ultrasound
(NVIC ICARUS) training course (www.nvic.nl). The
level of experience of lung ultrasound varied from
three months to over five years. The ultrasonographer
was blinded to clinical details and CXR findings, and
did not contribute to the diagnostic and treatment
strategy of the patient. Lung ultrasound was performed
immediately before or after CXR. We used a CX50
ultrasound machine (Koninklijke Philips NV�, Eind-
hoven, the Netherlands) with both the cardiac phased
array
(1–5 MHz)
and
the
linear
vascular
probe
(> 10 MHz). The ultrasonographer could choose a
particular probe for a particular view in a particular
patient, according to individual preference. Lung slid-
ing was determined using the vascular probe. Lung
ultrasound views were obtained according to the BLUE
protocol [16–18].
In short, we determined the BLUE profile for each
BLUE point and BLUE profile per hemithorax (BLUE 1
and 2) as follows: A; B; A’; B’ or C-profile. A-profile
means predominantly A-lines (see also Supporting
Information, Fig. S1 and Video S1). B-profile means
predominantly multiple (> 2) anterior diffuse B-lines.
A’ or B’ means the corresponding BLUE profile with
absence of, or abolished lung sliding. C-profile means
anterior alveolar consolidation. Furthermore, we deter-
mined the postero-lateral alveolar and/or pleural syn-
drome (PLAPS) on each side at the lateral subposterior
ultrasound examination and scored this as positive or
negative (see also Supporting Information, Fig. S2).
When positive, consolidation and/or pleural effusion
were scored separately and the diagnosis of atelectasis
was added to the flowchart. The final conclusion was
made according to the flowchart of the modified BLUE
protocol after cardiothoracic surgery (see also Support-
ing Information, Fig. S3). For differentiation between
pneumonia and atelectasis, the ultrasonographer was
allowed to look for fever and C-reactive protein (CRP)
in the medical chart of the patient.
We retrieved patient characteristics from the elec-
tronic patient data management system. These included:
sex; age; body mass index (BMI); surgery type; and rele-
vant cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Peri-operative data
consisted of extracorporeal circulation and aortic clamp
time, total peri-operative blood loss and blood product
transfusions. Respiratory data at time of lung ultrasound
included: arterial oxygen saturation; mode of ventila-
tion; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); O2 sup-
plementation; P/F- ratio; and hours of mechanical
ventilation during ICU stay. Parameters retrieved from
the documentation by the treating ICU physician
included: chest auscultation findings; conclusions/diag-
noses concerning pulmonary status; and treatments.

Touw et al. | Comparison between lung ultrasound and chest X-ray
 Routine data collection during ICU and medium care
stay included: temperature; fluid balance; drains; drain
production; haemoglobin levels; white blood cell count;
lactate; CRP levels; and ICU/medium care stay in hours,
corrected for prolonged stay due to delayed transfer to
the ward due to capacity problems.
Postoperative
pulmonary
complications
were
defined as previously described by Canet et al.: respira-
tory infection; respiratory failure; pleural effusion;
atelectasis; pneumothorax; and
bronchospasm,
and
scored accordingly [1]. A distinction was made bet-
ween PPCs and clinically-relevant PPCs, defined as a
PPC that required treatment, as judged by the treating
physician. We considered the following to be clini-
cally-relevant treatments for PPCs: high flow oxygen
therapy; a higher PEEP level or recruitment manoeu-
vres; continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP);
re-intubation; bronchoscopy; extra bronchodilator ther-
apy; thoracic drain placement; and the use of diuretics
and/or antibiotics, in addition to local antibiotic proto-
cols for cardiothoracic surgery. Scoring of clinically-
relevant PPCs was based on the documentation by the
treating ICU physician. The physician who diagnosed
clinically-relevant PPCs was taking into account physi-
cal examination, conventional monitoring, laboratory
results and CXR. This reflected daily clinical practice.
The treating ICU physician was blinded to lung ultra-
sound findings. Clinically-relevant PPCs were consi-
dered the composite reference standard. The diagnostic
accuracy of CXR alone is debated and is therefore an
imperfect reference standard for lung ultrasound. The
diagnostic accuracy of the reference standard was
improved by using a composite reference standard,
including multiple tests, one of which was CXR.
To assess the relationship between lung ultrasound
findings and patient outcome parameters, we com-
pared the number of B-lines, depth (cm) of pleural
effusion and total atelectasis (cm2) between patients
with clinically-relevant PPCs and patients without clin-
ically-relevant PPCs. Furthermore, we compared P/F
ratio and length of ICU stay between both groups.
We performed a predefined subgroup analysis of
patients in whom all lung ultrasound and CXR exami-
nations were successfully completed on both the day of
surgery and admission to ICU (day 0), and days two
and three. This allowed for comparison of the time to
detection of PPC and clinically-relevant PPC using
both techniques. Not all patients could be included in
this subgroup, as sometimes no researcher was available
to perform lung ultrasound, mostly at weekends. In
addition, CXRs were not always performed for logisti-
cal reasons or at the discretion of the treating physi-
cian, bypassing the departmental protocol.
We assessed the inter-observer agreement in a ran-
dom subset of the study population. We calculated
that a sample size of 70 measurements would be
required, according to a difference in overall agree-
ment and change probability of 0.6, and an accepted
relative error of 20%. Seventy lung ultrasound points
(BLUE points and PLAPS) were assessed to determine
inter-observer agreement. Lung ultrasound was per-
formed by two research team members (HT and KP).
Both investigators were blinded to mutual lung ultra-
sound findings. Agreement between the findings was
assessed at 10 different points per patient, per hemi-
thorax (BLUE profile per BLUE point), PLAPS (posi-
tive or negative), atelectasis (positive or negative) and
pleural effusion (positive or negative).
The time to perform CXR and lung ultrasound,
after CXR was ordered, was compared. We hypothesised
that lung ultrasound would detect an incidence of PPCs
of 80% and that CXR would detect an incidence of 60%
(our primary endpoint). We calculated that a sample
size of 162 subjects would be required with an alpha of
0.05 and a power of 80%. With an anticipated 10% loss
to follow-up, we set our sample size at 180 patients [1].
We carried out analyses using SPSS statistical software
package version 19.0 (IBM, New York, NY, USA). We
used the Chi-square test to compare unpaired categori-
cal data, and the McNemar test for paired data. The
accuracy of lung ultrasound and CXR for the detection
of clinically-relevant PPCs was expressed as sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values and
diagnostic accuracy.
We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired
ordinal data (repeated measures) in order to analyse ear-
lier detection of clinically-relevant PPCs with lung ultra-
sound vs. CXR. Detection of day 0 PPCs was ranked as
1, detection of day 2 PPCs as 2, detection of day 3 PPCs
as 3 and undetected PPCs were ranked as 4. To assess
the
inter-observer
agreement
for
lung
ultrasound,
Cohen’s kappa (j) statistics were used with j < 0.40

 indicating low agreement, 0.40 to 0.75 low-to-good
agreement, and > 0.75 good-to-perfect agreement.
Results
During the study period, 360 patients underwent car-
diothoracic surgery, and we recruited 177 of these
patients to the study. The other patients were not
included because no member of the research team was
available to perform lung ultrasound on admission.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics and clinical
characteristics of the included patients.
Lung ultrasound identified more patients with a
PPC compared with CXR (p < 0.001) upon ICU
admission.
The
PPCs
identified
were
pulmonary
oedema, consolidation, pneumothorax, atelectasis and
pleural effusion. The incidences of PPCs on day 0, day
2 and day 3, as detected by CXR and lung ultrasound,
are shown in Table 2. The prevalence of pleural effu-
sion increased during the postoperative course for both
groups, but there was a higher prevalence detected
using lung ultrasound compared with CXR, with rates
of 44% and 71% on day 2 (p ≤ 0.001) and 71% and
90% on day 3 (p = 0.013) for CXR and lung ultra-
sound, respectively. Lung ultrasound on admission
mainly detected more cases of atelectasis (87% vs.
41%, p < 0.001) and pulmonary oedema (20% vs.
15%, p = 0.143) when compared with CXR.
The incidence of clinically-relevant PPCs on day 0,
2 and 3 are shown in Table 3. Seventeen patients out
of 177 patients (10%) developed a clinically-relevant
PPC at day 0. The incidence of clinically-relevant
PPCs increased over the days; 15 patients out of 99
patients (15%) on day 2 and 13 patients out of 58
patients (22%) on day 3.
Table 4 shows the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and
NPV, and diagnostic accuracy for lung ultrasound and
CXR in detecting clinically-relevant PPCs. Pulmonary
oedema and atelectasis were the two clinically-relevant
PPCs that occurred sufficiently commonly to allow us to
calculate the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis by

Touw et al. | Comparison between lung ultrasound and chest X-ray
 lung ultrasound and CXR. The sensitivity was higher
and specificity was lower for lung ultrasound for detect-
ing clinically-relevant atelectasis compared with CXR.
The diagnostic accuracy for detecting pulmonary oed-
ema was comparable during the study period.
In total, lung ultrasound identified 26 (58%) clini-
cally-relevant PPCs and CXR identified 17 (38%) clini-
cally-relevant PPCs out of a total of 45 clinically-
relevant PPCs on day 0, 2 and 3 (p = 0.021). On day
0, lung ultrasound identified 11 out of 17 (65%)
patients with a clinically-relevant PPC, whereas CXR
detected 7 out of 17 (41%) patients (p = 0.125). On
day 2, lung ultrasound identified 8 out of 15 (53%)
patients with a clinically-relevant PPC and CXR identi-
fied 5 out of 15 (33%) patients (p = 0.250). On day 3,
lung ultrasound identified seven (54%) patients and
CXR identified five (39%) patients out of 13 patients
with clinically-relevant PPCs (p = 0.625).
In a subgroup of 42 patients, clinically-relevant
PPCs were detected earlier with lung ultrasound than
with CXR (p = 0.024) (Fig. 1). Overall inter-observer
agreement for lung ultrasound showed excellent agree-
ment (j = 0.907, p < 0.001). Lung ultrasound was
performed within a mean (SD) of 15 (5) min com-
pared with 42 (16) min for CXR (p < 0.001).
Patients with a clinically-relevant PPC had a lower
mean (SD) P/F ratio compared with patients without
clinically-relevant PPCs on day 1 (188 (58) vs. 250
(72) mmHg, p = 0.001) and on day 2 (190 (84) vs. 273
(71) mmHg, p = 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, ICU
stay
differed
significantly
between
both
groups
(p = 0.083) (see also Supporting Information, Table S1).
The total number of B-lines and pleural effusion
(in cm) did not differ between patients with and without
clinically-relevant
PPCs.
The
degree
of
atelectasis
(in cm2) was smaller only on day 2 in patients with
clinically-relevant PPCs compared with the group that
were not clinically-relevant (12.8 (6.4) cm2 vs. 7.7
(7.1) cm2, p = 0.045) (see also Supporting Information,
Table S1).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that lung ultrasound detected
more PPCs and clinically-relevant PPCs, and at an ear-
lier time-point, when compared with CXR, in patients
following cardiothoracic surgery. In addition, time to per-
form lung ultrasound was significantly shorter than for
CXR, and lung ultrasound had excellent inter-observer
agreement. Lung ultrasound outperformed CXR in diag-
nosing clinically-relevant PPCs following cardiothoracic

 surgery and may potentially replace CXR as the primary
imaging technique in these patients.
The PPC rate in our study is in line with previous
research, which showed that 54–73% of patients had
atelectasis, pleural effusion or both after cardiothoracic
surgery when detected by CXR [2, 15, 19]. Of interest,
we found a higher incidence of atelectasis and pleural
effusions detected by lung ultrasound in these patients.
This finding could be explained by the higher sensitivity
and specificity of lung ultrasound in detecting pleural
effusion and atelectasis compared with CXR, when com-
pared with the gold standard for thoracic imaging,
computed tomography (CT) scans [5, 7, 13, 18]. Fur-
thermore, our results are comparable with the reported
incidence of atelectasis of 90% found with thoracic CT
scan in anaesthetised patients [20]. The incidence of
clinically-relevant PPCs in our study was comparable
with rates described before, making our results genera-
lisable to the postoperative population [2, 4, 21]. Of
note, more clinically-relevant PPCs were detected by
lung ultrasound, although this clinically-relevant com-
posite reference standard was based on CXR findings,
among others. This suggests that lung ultrasound would
have performed even better when used as the primary
imaging technique to screen for clinically-relevant PPCs.
Previous research comparing CXR with lung ultrasound
in patients after cardiothoracic surgery found that lung
ultrasound identified most of the PPCs detected by
CXR. Unfortunately, they reported the diagnostic value
of lung ultrasound compared with CXR as the reference
standard [22]. The use of a reference standard with
potentially worse accuracy (CXR) than the index test
(lung ultrasound) in the study, makes it difficult to
interpret their results.
Early detection of PPCs may lead to improved out-
comes. Previous research has shown that although PPC
rates did not differ among hospitals, mortality rates did
due to ‘failure to rescue’, a term coined by Silber et al.
[23, 24]. In a predefined subgroup analysis, we found
that lung ultrasound identified clinically-relevant PPCs
at an earlier timepoint than CXR. In addition, lung
ultrasound had superior sensitivity and almost compa-
rable
specificity
in
detecting
PPCs,
and
thereby
improved detection of PPCs. However, in the BLUE
protocol we used, the extent of the complication was
not determined, but only assessed as dichotomous;
either a complication was present or not [17]. An
approach in which the extent of the PPC is quantified
might be preferable. For assessing pleural effusions, con-
siderable work has been done to quantify the volume of
effusion according to lung ultrasound imaging, but not
to determine the clinical significance [25]. Our study
found only that atelectasis in cm2 differed significantly
on day 2 for patients with clinically-relevant PPCs com-
pared with patients without clinically-relevant PPCs. Of
note, quantification of PPCs detected by lung ultra-
sound should be evaluated in future studies, because our
study was underpowered to detect such a difference.
Considering the great variability in imaging strate-
gies after cardiothoracic surgery in current practice, an
optimal imaging strategy is still warranted [26]. Daily
routine CXR performance has been largely abandoned
in ICU patients whose lungs are ventilated, and has
been replaced by an ‘on demand’ strategy [27]. This
has led to a significant decrease in the number of
CXRs without any increase in adverse events [6, 26].
Studies comparing a daily routine with an ‘on demand
strategy’ using primarily CXR or lung ultrasound as
the imaging technique are lacking in the cardiothoracic
population.

 Our data suggest that lung ultrasound might be a
key modality to optimise the postoperative imaging
strategy in these patients. Lung ultrasound potentially
facilitates prompt diagnosis of PPCs, thereby enabling
treatment to start early. In addition, lung ultrasound
can be used to evaluate the efficacy of therapies initiated
for PPCs, since lung ultrasound offers an accurate, non-
invasive, easily reproducible bedside evaluation. Alsad-
dique et al. found that repeated imaging with lung
ultrasound
after
cardiothoracic
surgery
frequently
altered diagnosis and management of PPCs [28]. Con-
sidering the aforementioned, we suggest using lung ultra-
sound as an extension of the physical examination in
patients after cardiothoracic surgery. The use of stetho-
scopes and CXRs for the detection of PPCs, with their
debatable accuracy and downsides such as radiation
exposure,
may
be
superseded
[5],
although
CXR
remains the standard for confirmation of the position of
central venous catheters, as well as tracheal tube place-
ment.
Our study has some important limitations. Firstly,
we could not report sensitivity and specificity of lung
ultrasound and CXR compared with the gold standard
for lung imaging, the thoracic CT scan, since this was
not performed in our study. Therefore, we used clini-
cally-relevant PPCs as a composite reference standard,
to minimise imperfect reference standard bias. However,
a disadvantage is the introduction of the subjectivity of
the treating physician [29]. Secondly, lung ultrasound
was not studied as the primary imaging technique fol-
lowing cardiothoracic surgery and compared with CXR
in a blinded, randomised controlled trial. Possible varia-
tions in therapy initiated, and the incidence rate of
detection of clinically-relevant PPCs for lung ultrasound
compared with CXR could not be studied. Theoretically,
should therapy have been initiated according to more
sensitive lung ultrasound findings, it could introduce an
element of over-treatment of clinically-irrelevant PPCs.
However, the positive effects of early treatment and
potentially faster recovery were not studied either.
Thirdly, the BLUE protocol was validated for patients in
respiratory distress presenting to the emergency depart-
ment [17]. Strengths of the current study are the large
sample size compared with previous studies in non-
cardiothoracic surgery, and the fact that this was the first
study to show that lung ultrasound can detect PPCs at
an earlier stage than CXR. Furthermore, lung ultrasound
was performed by multiple investigators, with different
levels of experience, thus mirroring daily clinical prac-
tice. In addition, lung ultrasound demonstrated high
inter-observer agreement, in concordance with previ-
ously reported findings, and was performed faster than
CXR [22]. Lastly, we have shown that lung ultrasound is
feasible in patients after cardiothoracic surgery, who are
considered less accessible to lung ultrasound, for exam-
ple due to wound dressings and thoracic drain tubes,
again in accordance with previous studies [22, 28].
There is a need for larger (multicenter) trials investigat-
ing the cost effectiveness, the ease of implementation
and the effect on patient outcomes and interventions
performed when lung ultrasound is used a primary
imaging technique, compared with CXR. Since different
lung ultrasound protocols were used in previous studies,
it would be of interest to determine if lung ultrasound
protocols are comparable, or if one protocol is superior
to another. In addition, we suggest quantification of lung
ultrasound findings.
In conclusion, lung ultrasound detected more clin-
ically-relevant PPCs and at an earlier timepoint than
CXR following cardiothoracic surgery. Our results sug-
gest lung ultrasound can be used as the primary imag-
ing technique to detect PPCs after cardiothoracic
surgery, and will enhance bedside decision making.
The next step is to test lung ultrasound as the primary
imaging technique in these patients, and further quan-
tify the extent of PPCs.
