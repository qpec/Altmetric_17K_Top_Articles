ABSTRACT
Host stem/progenitor cells can be mobilized and recruited to a target location using biomaterials,
and these cells may be used for in situ tissue regeneration. The objective of this study was to inves-
tigate whether host biologic resources could be used to regenerate renal tissue in situ. Collagen
hydrogel was injected into the kidneys of normal mice, and rat kidneys that had sustained ische-
mia/reperfusion injury. After injection, the kidneys of both animal models were examined up to 4
weeks for host tissue response. The infiltrating host cells present within the injection regions
expressed renal stem/progenitor cell markers, PAX-2, CD24, and CD133, as well as mesenchymal
stem cell marker, CD44. The regenerated renal structures were identified by immunohistochemis-
try for renal cell specific markers, including synaptopodin and CD31 for glomeruli and cytokeratin
and neprilysin for tubules. Quantitatively, the number of glomeruli found in the injected regions
was significantly higher when compared to normal regions of renal cortex. This phenomenon
occurred in normal and ischemic injured kidneys. Furthermore, the renal function after ischemia/
reperfusion injury was recovered after collagen hydrogel injection. These results demonstrate that
introduction of biomaterials into the kidney is able to facilitate the regeneration of glomerular and
tubular structures in normal and injured kidneys. Such an approach has the potential to become a
simple and effective treatment for patients with renal failure. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Current treatment options for acute/chronic renal failures are limited to dialysis or renal trans-
plantation. Dialysis can extend the survival for many patients, and renal transplantation can
only restore the normal renal function. However, renal transplantation is severely limited by a
donor supply and association with immunosuppressive complications and graft failure. The strat-
egy of in situ renal regeneration is to utilize the host renal progenitor cells or adjacent stem
cells to target the renal injury sites by biomaterials. The presence of an underlying regenerative
mechanism in the form of tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells can suggest that there may be a
potential therapeutic opportunity to bias the host response toward repair of renal injury.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic renal disease is a common condition that
elevates the risk of renal failure, cardiovascular
disease, and other complications [1]. The preva-
lence of chronic renal failure has continuously
increased in the U.S. in the last decade [2]. The
current standard treatment options for renal fail-
ure are dialysis and organ transplantation, both of
which are associated with limitations. Dialysis,
usually performed three times per week, impairs
the patient’s quality of life and does not replace
renal functions such as synthesis of erythropoietin
and calcitriol [3]. Transplantation, on the other
hand, can replace all renal functions, but the rising
occurrence of end-stage renal disease in the U.S.
continues to outpace the rate of organ donation,
as reflected by the fact that the waiting list contin-
ues to grow by 3,000–4,000 people per year [4].
Additionally, long-term outcomes of kidney trans-
plantation remain unsatisfactory, mainly because
of chronic immune rejection and complications
associated with immunosuppressive medications
[5, 6]. As a result, development of alternate thera-
pies for renal failure is critically needed.
Cell-based approaches using tissue engineer-
ing and regenerative medicine techniques have
offered new therapeutic opportunities for treating
various pathologic conditions [7, 8]. During the
past decade, a number of cell-based approaches
using renal cells and/or biomaterials has been
attempted to replace or restore renal functions
[9–20]. These approaches usually require the
selection of an appropriate cell source that can be

 isolated and expanded in large quantities in vitro, while maintain-
ing cellular phenotypic and functional characteristics. However,
the kidney is an extremely complex organ, which consists of at
least 26 terminally differentiated cell types, including tubular epi-
thelial cells, interstitial cells, glomerular cells, vascular cells, and so
on [21]. To overcome these limitations, we have previously dem-
onstrated that host cells expressing various stem cell markers
could be mobilized into an implanted biomaterial, and these cells
were able to differentiate into multiple cell lineages if appropriate
culture conditions are provided [22–24]. This suggests that it may
be possible to control tissue morphogenesis in vivo by providing
the appropriate cues to infiltrating multipotent stem cells or
tissue-specific progenitor cells. This novel strategy could lead to
the production of functional tissues in situ, which is in contrast to
conventional cell-based strategies that focus on in vitro manipula-
tion of cells [25].
Several researchers have reported the existence of renal
stem/progenitor cells, which can contribute to regeneration and
repair in the kidney [26–37]. Several genes expressed during
embryonic development are downregulated in mature kidney tis-
sue, but are expressed again during recovery after renal injury.
One such factor is paired box gene 2 (PAX-2) [36], which belongs
to a family of transcription factors, and is required for develop-
ment and proliferation of renal tubules [32]. Renal progenitor cells
expressing CD24, CD133, and PAX-2 have been identified at the
tubular and glomerular levels and can regenerate tubular cells in
an animal model of acute renal failure [26, 31, 35, 37]. In addition,
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a
potential source of cells that can regenerate renal tubules [27,
34].The presence of an underlying regenerative mechanism in the
form of tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells suggests that
there might be a potential opportunity to bias the host response
toward repair of renal injury. We hypothesized that these host
stem cells or progenitors could be mobilized and recruited into
target locations using an injectable or implantable biomaterial sys-
tem. In the present study, we explored this hypothesis by intro-
ducing a biomaterial (collagen hydrogel) into normal kidneys and
kidneys damaged by ischemia/reperfusion. We evaluated histolog-
ical and functional changes after introduction of the biomaterial
in order to determine whether renal tissue could be regenerated
in situ.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Hydrogel Preparation
Rat tail type I collagen solution was obtained from BD Biosciences
(San Jose, CA). Collagen hydrogels were prepared on ice prior to
injection. Briefly, collagen solution (0.2% wt/vol) was neutralized
by adding 1N NaOH solution to give a final pH of 7.4. In this study,
neutralized collagen hydrogel as an injectable biomaterial was
selected by testing with various hydrogel biomaterials (Supporting
Information Fig. S1). Upon injection into the kidney, the collagen
hydrogels thermo-gelled as they reached 378C. All chemicals were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St Louis, MO) and used as
received unless stated otherwise.
Normal Mouse Model
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with a pro-
tocol approved by Wake Forest University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. CD1 mice (age, 6–8 weeks) were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories Inc. (Wilmington, MA).
Under anesthesia using isoflurane, the kidneys were accessed
through a dorsal incision and then collagen hydrogels were
injected into kidneys. Mice were divided into three experimental
groups (n 5 20 animals per group). The following treatments were
administered via three injections into both kidneys using a 22-
gauge needle: (a) collagen hydrogel (0.2% wt/vol, 50 ml/kidney),
(b) saline (0.9% NaCl, 50 ml/kidney, Hospira, Inc, Lake Forest, IL),
and (c) needle stick only. The injections with 3 mm depth and 308
angle were in the upper and lower poles of the kidney as well as
the central region of the kidney. Sham operation served as a con-
trol (n 5 3). The kidneys were harvested at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks
after injection for analyses.
GFP Bone Marrow Chimeric Mouse Model
In order to identify the migration of bone marrow cells to the kid-
neys, donor bone marrow cells from transgenic C57Bl/6 GFP mice
(C57Bl/6-Tg[UBC-GFP]30Scha/J, The Jackson Lab., Bar Harbor, ME)
were isolated from femurs by flushing the marrow using a 1 ml
syringe fitted with a 22-gauge needle. Repeated gently aspirations
with the syringe was performed to prepare a single cell suspen-
sion of marrow cells. C57Bl/6 recipient mice were irradiated with
950 cGy using a Co60 irradiator 18–24 hours prior to bone marrow
transplantation. Irradiated recipient C57Bl/6 mice were injected
with 1 3 107 C57Bl/6 GFP bone marrow cells in a volume of
0.2 ml via the lateral tail vein. At 2 weeks post-transplantation,
engraftment of the GFP bone marrow stem cells was monitored
by obtaining a peripheral blood sample and determining the per-
cent of circulating GFP positive nucleated cells using flow cytome-
try. Recipient mice expressing greater that 50% GFP positive
circulating cells were designated as chimeric GFP mice and were
then selected to be included in the experimental groups (n 5 5).
The injections of collagen hydrogel were performed as described
above.
Renal Ischemia/Reperfusion Rat Model
Sixty Lewis rats (6–8 weeks, weight approximately 200 g, Charles
River Laboratories Inc.) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal
injection of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal, Ovation Pharma-
ceuticals, Inc., Deerfield, IL) at an initial dose of 50 mg/kg. If neces-
sary, anesthesia was maintained using a second 25 mg/kg dose.
The kidneys were exposed through a 3 cm midline abdominal inci-
sion. The bilateral renal pedicles were isolated. Each renal artery
and vein were occluded with non-traumatic clamps (Micro-serre-
fine curved 6 mm, Fine Science Tools Inc. Foster, CA) for 60
minutes. At the end of this time period, the clamps were released
to allow renal reperfusion. The abdominal wall was closed in two
layers. The post-surgical pain was managed with buprenorphine
(0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals,
Richmond, VA). At 2 weeks after ischemia/reperfusion surgery,
three injections of the neutralized collagen hydrogel were applied
to the kidneys using a 20-gauge needle (n 5 10 animals per time
point). Three injections (5 mm depth and 308 angle) of the colla-
gen hydrogel (0.2% wt/vol, 400 ml/kidney) were in the upper and
lower poles of the kidney as well as the central region of the kid-
ney using 20-gauge needle. Sham operation (n 5 10 animals per
time point) and saline injection (400 ml/kidney, n 5 10 animals per
time point) groups served as controls as described above. After
collagen injection, the kidneys were harvested at 2 and 4 weeks
for analyses.

 Histology and Immunohistochemistry
The retrieved kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded kidneys were cut into
5-mm sections. The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated
in a routine manner. Some sections were deparaffinized and
stained with standard H&E for morphological evaluation.
For immunohistochemistry, the sections were immersed in 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 minutes at room tempera-
ture to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Target retrieval
solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) was used to expose antigens in
the samples. All slides were blocked in 10% serum (from the spe-
cies in which the appropriate second antibody was raised) for 40
minutes. Sections were incubated with the primary antibodies for
60 minutes at room temperature. The sections were analyzed
using the following antibodies for renal stem/progenitor cell-
specific antigens: polyclonal rabbit anti-PAX-2 (5 mg/ml, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), polyclonal rabbit anti-CD24 (1:50, Santa Cruz Bio-
technology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), rat anti-mouse CD44 (1:20, BD
Biosciences), and polyclonal rabbit anti-CD133 (1:200, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA). Next, the sections washed and incubated with
the biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlin-
game, CA) for 30 minutes. The sections were then incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 30 minutes at room tem-
perature. Detection of peroxidase was performed using either
3,30-diaminobenzidine or Nova-RED (Vector Laboratories). Finally,
the sections were counterstained with haematoxylin for 1 minute.
Negative controls were incubated with 3% serum without primary
antibody.
The infiltrating host cells into the injection region were exam-
ined by immunohistochemical staining for bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU, Sigma-Aldrich) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA,
Dako). For BrdU labeling, BrdU (100 mg/kg) was injected intraperi-
toneally into normal CD1 mice daily for 2 weeks. Quantitative
analysis of PCNA-positive cells was performed by counting the
positive nuclei in injured and normal regions from five randomly
selected fields under a light microscope at magnification 3200.
For the GFP bone marrow chimeric mouse model, GFP1/PAX-
21 cells, GFP1/CD441 cells, or PAX-21/CD441 cells were deter-
mined by double-immunofluorescence. Alexa Fluor 488 (1:300,
goat anti-mouse IgG, Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor 594
(1:300, goat anti-rabbit IgG, Life Technology) were used to visual-
ize the double-stained cells in the injection region. Quantitative
analysis of the numbers of GFP1/PAX-21 cells, GFP1/CD441
cells, and PAX-21/CD441 cells were counted, respectively. The
percentage of expressed cells was calculated by dividing the total
number of the antibody-stained cells by the total number of DAPI-
stained cells.
The regenerated renal structures were identified by immuno-
histochemistry with cell specific markers: mouse anti-human
CD31 (Dako), mouse anti-rat synaptopodin (Fitzgerald industries
International, Concord, MA), cytokeratin (Dako), and polyclonal
rabbit anti-neprilysin (1:100, Millipore, Billerica, MA). To quantify
the effects of the injection of collagen gel, we counted and quanti-
fied the number of glomeruli (per mm2) in the entire kidney in the
injected and normal animals, respectively, by the 20 serial sections
of the entire kidney (per animal, n 5 6).
Functional Testing
Blood samples for creatinine determination were collected.
Briefly, blood samples were collected from rat tail artery at weekly
intervals from 1 week before ischemia/reperfusion injury until 2
weeks after surgery for all the animals. Serum creatinine was
measured using an automatic modular analyzer (Synchron CX5
delta, Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA).
Statistical Analysis
Data from the number of PCNA-positive cells and glomeruli and
from the blood serum testing were analyzed by single-factor anal-
ysis of variance. A p < .05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Characterization of Infiltrating Host Cells and Renal
Tissue Regeneration in Normal Mouse Kidney
To assess the levels of host cellular infiltration and determine
whether these cells could contribute to renal tissue regeneration,
neutralized collagen hydrogels (0.2% wt/vol) were injected into
the kidneys of normal CD1 mice. Saline injection and needle stick
without injection of collagen hydrogel were also performed as
controls (Supporting Information Fig. S2). At 2 weeks after injec-
tion, each kidney contained inflammatory and fibroblastic cells in
the injected regions (Fig. 1A). However, a higher number of regen-
erated glomerular-like structures was seen in the collagen injected
group as compared to the other groups. To detect host cells that
had infiltrated into the injection region of the kidney, we exam-
ined the localization of cells positive for PCNA, which is expressed
particularly in the early G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, and is a
marker for proliferating cells. Kidneys injected with collagen con-
tained a large PCNA-positive cell population and showed progres-
sive renal tissue formation in the injected regions over time (Fig.
1B).The number of PCNA-positive cells in the injected regions was
significantly higher than in normal regions (p < .01, Fig. 1C). This
indicates that host cells are able to migrate from other areas into
the injected regions. Interestingly, it seems that these host cells
(PCNA-positive) contribute to the formation of renal structures, as
evidenced by the high number of glomeruli that were observed in
the injected regions in the collagen hydrogel treated animals.
H&E stained image showed the injected and normal region
(Fig. 2A), and the regenerated renal structures in the injected
region were identified by immunohistochemistry with renal cell
specific markers (Fig. 2B–2H). The glomerular-like structures
expressed synaptopodin (Fig. 2B) and CD31 (Fig. 2C). In addition,
the regenerated glomerular-like structure in the injected regions
were confirmed by detecting PCNA expression (Fig. 2D). In fact,
the number of glomeruli found in the collagen hydrogel injected
regions was significantly higher as compared to native kidney tis-
sue regions and the other groups (p < .05, Fig. 2F). Also, the
tubular-like structure expressed cytokeratin (Fig. 2G) in the injec-
tion region. To localize and follow the cells that infiltrated into the
collagen biomaterial in normal mouse kidneys, thymidine analog
BrdU was injected intraperitoneally daily for 2 weeks, and then
the kidneys were removed and stained with an anti-BrdU anti-
body. BrdU-positive cells were localized in both the glomeruli (Fig.
2E) and tubules (Fig. 2H).
To determine if the cells that infiltrated into the collagen bio-
material contain host renal stem/progenitor cells, immunohisto-
chemistry for PAX-2, CD24, and CD44 was performed. The
infiltrating host cells present within the injected regions of these
kidneys expressed both renal stem/progenitor cell markers, PAX-2
and CD24, as well as the MSC marker, CD44. We observed the

 presence of CD44-positive cells (Fig. 2I–2K) and CD133-positive
cells (Fig. 2L–2N) in the injured regions after collagen hydrogel
injection. These cells were localized within the tubular area and at
the glomerular level within the parietal layer of Bowman’s cap-
sule. However, we did not observe cells expressing CD44 or
CD133 in the normal regions (uninjured) of the same kidney.
GFP Bone Marrow Chimeric Mouse Model
To determine the origin of the infiltrating cells in the kidney tissue,
GFP-expressing bone marrow chimeric mouse model was created.
Injection of collagen hydrogel into the kidney induced the migra-
tion of bone marrow cells to the kidney as evidenced by the pres-
ence of GFP positive cells in the injection region. After 2 weeks of
collagen hydrogel injection, PAX-2 positive cells were significantly
increased at the site of collagen injection when compared to the
normal region (Fig. 3A).The PAX-2 positive cells appear to be asso-
ciated with the collecting ducts within the kidney. PAX-2 is
expressed during embryological development. The presence of
PAX-2 positive cells suggests that early progenitor cells may have
been activated by the injected collagen hydrogels. At least 10% of
the PAX-2 positive cells were also GFP positive suggesting that
these cells originated from the bone marrow (Fig. 3B). CD44 posi-
tive cells are also present at the injection region (Fig. 3C). CD44 is
a receptor for hyaluronic acid and is expressed on some stem cell
populations including bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and
bone marrow-derived MSCs [30]. There is a small population of
GFP and CD44 positive cells suggesting that this population of
cells originated from the bone marrow (Fig. 3D).Very few of these
cells expressed both CD44 and PAX-2, indicating that these
markers identify two distinct cell populations within the kidney
(Fig. 3E, 3F).
Renal Ischemia/Reperfusion Rat Model
To determine whether infiltrated cells form renal structures in
injured kidney, the rat model of renal ischemia and reperfusion
was created and observed for least 2 weeks after injury.The ische-
mia/reperfusion-injured kidneys showed tubular dilation and
brush border loss (Fig. 4B) as well as intratubular cast formation

 and degeneration of tubular architecture. Some tubular structures
became edematous and necrotic. The number of glomeruli
decreased in the injured kidneys, and some swelled and devel-
oped sclerosis. After ischemia/reperfusion injury was confirmed,
the collagen hydrogels were injected directly into the injured kid-
neys.The injected regions were readily identified, as most showed
the presence of increased interstitial leukocytes and other infiltrat-
ing cells (Fig. 4C).
Regenerated glomerular-like (Fig. 4D) and tubular-like (Fig.
4H) structures were observed at 2 weeks after the collagen hydro-
gel injection. To characterize the phenotype of the regenerated
structures, we examined the expression of the renal cell markers,
synaptopodin (Fig. 4E) and CD31 (Fig. 4F). In addition, the tubular
structure stained positive for neprilysin (Fig. 4I). After ischemic
injury, the number of glomeruli in the native tissue was signifi-
cantly
decreased
(7.9 6 0.35/mm2,
4.02 6 0.18/mm2,
and
3.29 6 0.186/mm2; normal kidney, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after
surgery, respectively; p < .0001). However, in the collagen hydro-
gel injection group, the number of glomeruli was significantly
increased in the injected regions compared to native regions with
ischemic
injury
(11.44 6 0.72/mm2
vs.
4.02 6 0.18/mm2;
12.08 6 1.2/mm2 vs. 3.29 6 0.186/mm2; 2 weeks and 4 weeks;
p < .01). Interestingly, the density of the glomeruli was higher
within the collagen biomaterial than in normal kidney (Fig. 4G).
To identify the host cells present in the injected regions,
immunohistochemistry for specific renal stem/progenitor cell
markers was performed (Fig. 5). PCNA-positive cells in the injected
regions were increased (Fig. 5A). Immunohistochemistry of the
collagen injection regions from ischemic kidneys revealed that
CD24, a marker of the renal embryonic progenitor cells, was
expressed. In the injection regions, we observed the presence of
CD24-positive cells of the interstitial and tubular structures (Fig.
5B). The CD44-positive (Fig. 5C) and PAX-2-positive (Fig. 5D) cells
were identified not only in the interstitial and tubular structure,
but also at the glomerular level within the parietal layer of Bow-
man’s capsule in the injection area (Fig. 5E). These cells were
rarely found in the native kidney tissue outside the injection
regions.
To determine whether the regenerated glomeruli and tubules
could contribute to functional recovery of the kidney, blood sam-
ples were analyzed for creatinine levels. At 2 weeks after renal
ischemia and reperfusion, the blood serum creatinine level was
maximized. One week after the collagen injection, the renal func-
tion improved in all experimental groups (blood serum creatinine
level; 1.26 6 0.29 mg/dl in the saline group and 0.76 6 0.1 mg/dl
in the collagen group). Although there was no significant differ-
ence in the study groups (p value 5 .8), there was a trend indicat-
ing that collagen injection led to the improvement in renal
function when compared with the sham group (Fig. 5F).
DISCUSSION
Previous studies demonstrate that host cell infiltrates into a
biomaterial implant are not entirely comprised of inflammatory
and fibroblast-like cells, and that the normal inflammatory
process can be altered by incorporating agents that influence

 microenvironmental cues [22]. We showed that infiltrating cells
are capable of differentiating into multiple cell lineages if appro-
priate conditions are provided. These results suggest that it is pos-
sible to recruit a predominance of cells with multi-lineage
potential into a specific biomaterial system. Therefore, it may be
feasible to enrich the infiltrate with such cell types and control
their fate, provided proper substrate-mediated signaling can be
imparted into the biomaterial [23, 24].
Various types of host cells can be utilized for in situ renal tis-
sue regeneration. Some research groups have recently reported
the existence of renal stem/progenitor cells in the kidney. Busso-
lati et al. demonstrated the presence of a resident population of
stem cells expressing CD133 and PAX-2 markers in adult normal
human kidney and suggested that these cells were capable of
expansion and, potentially, self-renewal [26]. Sagrinati et al. iso-
lated
and
characterized
multipotent
progenitor
cells
that
expressed CD24 and CD133 from the Bowman’s capsule of adult
human kidneys [35]. These cells could be induced to generate
mature, functional, tubular cells with phenotypic features of proxi-
mal and/or distal tubules. Furthermore, Herrera et al. demon-
strated that the mechanisms underlying the migration and
homing of CD44 expressing MSCs to injured renal tissue [29, 30].
It would seem that these cells are the key to the underlying regen-
erative machinery [38–40].
In the present study, we investigated the possibility of using
the body’s biologic and environmental resources in situ for renal
tissue regeneration. As an initial step, we examined whether
injectable biomaterials could facilitate recruitment of host renal
stem/progenitor cells that could participate in the renal regenera-
tive process. We used a simple approach to address this concept
by using collagen hydrogel as an injectable biomaterial. Collagen
is known as one of the most abundant extracellular matrix (ECM)
in the body [41]. Collagen plays a major role in the formation of
tissues and organs, and is involved in various functional properties
of cells. Moreover, collagen hydrogel is flowable, suggesting the
possibility of an easily injectable, biocompatible material [42–44].
After collagen hydrogel injection, we found that a population
of host cells expressing PAX-2, CD24, CD133, and CD44 was able
to infiltrate the injection regions of both normal mice and rats
with renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover, it seems that
these cells contribute to the regeneration of renal tissue struc-
tures. The CD44-positive cells were localized within the tubular

 area and at the glomerular level within the parietal layer of Bow-
man’s capsule in the injection regions. These cells proliferate and
eventually re-differentiate into typical renal cells during the regen-
erative process. Many researchers have reported that the renal
stem cells may activate in the entire injured region of the kidney.
Interestingly, in our present study, the renal stem/progenitor cells
were localized to the injured regions.
In the ischemic injured kidney of rat, we found PAX-21,
CD241, and CD1331 cells as well as CD441 cells.These cells prolif-
erated, differentiated, and formed renal structures, including
those with glomerular-like and tubular-like morphologies. How-
ever, a small population of these cells was also observed in adja-
cent normal regions. During the recovery after renal ischemia,
these cells might activate in larger regions [30, 45, 46].
The present study shows that recruitment of host renal stem/
progenitor cells within the injured kidney facilitated the structural
and functional recovery. Although the mechanism of this phenom-
enon is unclear, it may be due to the host response to the injury
as well as biological microenvironment (flexible space) and
mechanical stimulus (pressure) created by the administration of
collagen hydrogel (Supporting Information Fig. S3). Additionally,
collagen hydrogel, being the major ECM in the kidney, may have
promoted repair, reduce cell death locally and diminishes post-
injury glomeruli loss. The host cells may respond to local environ-
mental stimulation with differentiation into glomerular and tubu-
lar cells in situ. Furthermore, it is now known that there are
somatic stem cells that mobilize to remote damaged tissue sites,
where they differentiate into required lineages and participate in
tissue/organ repair and regeneration [47–49]. However, the mech-
anisms of stem cell migration to injured tissue and cell
differentiation into glomerular and tubular cells are still unclear. In
order to determine whether the bone marrow cells could contrib-
ute to renal regeneration, bone marrow reconstitution using chi-
meric GFP-expressing cells was performed after whole-body
irradiation. Of interest, it has been found that the GFP-expressing
cells were localized in only the injection region, suggesting that
BM-derived cells also in the regenerative process. Further evi-
dence of the renal regeneration by the collagen injection was also
observed from the presence of GFP1/PAX-21 and GFP1/CD441
cells in the injection region.
We have shown the influence of renal tissue regeneration due
to host response activated by the collagen injection. This can also
include inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes, macrophages
(dendritic cells), and neutrophils [50]. Cytokines such as IL-6 and
IL-22 may be involved in this response induced tissue regeneration
by activation of local stem cell/progenitor cells [51]. It may be pos-
sible that after hydrogel injection, a proliferative response involv-
ing immune cells and migrations of host cells into the injected
region to contribute to the regenerative process. More detailed
mechanistic studies including the role of inflammation are
planned for the future experiments. Obviously, understanding the
activation, recruitment, and differentiation of the renal stem/pro-
genitor cells that accelerate in situ tissue regeneration will assist
the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of renal
failure.
CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates that the introduction of injectable colla-
gen hydrogel into kidneys is able to facilitate recruitment of host

 renal stem cells or progenitors that contribute to the in situ regen-
eration of renal glomerular and tubular structures. These results
suggest that it is possible to recruit a predominance of cells with
renal regenerative potential into a scaffolding system. This simple
approach may become a preferred treatment for patients with
renal failure.
