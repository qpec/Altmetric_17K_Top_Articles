 Highly potent and broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) have been used to prevent 
and treat lentivirus infections in humanized mice, macaques and humans1–12. To determine 
whether the administration of combination bNAbs during the acute SHIV infection of rhesus 
macaques might lead to long-term control of virus replication, animals challenged with 
SHIVAD8-EO by mucosal or intravenous routes received a single 2-week course of 2 potent 
passively transferred bNAbs (3BNC117 and 10-107413,14). Viremia remained undetectable for 56–
177 days, depending on bNAb half-life in vivo. Moreover, in the 13 treated monkeys, plasma virus 
loads subsequently declined to undetectable levels in 6 controller macaques. 4 additional animals 
maintained their CD4+ T cell counts and very low levels of viremia persisted for over 2 years. The 
frequency of cells carrying replication-competent virus was less than 1 per 106 circulating CD4+ T 
cells in the 6 controller macaques. Infusion of a T cell depleting anti-CD8β mAb to the controller 
animals led to a specific decline in levels of CD8+ T cells and rapid reappearance of plasma 
viremia. In contrast, macaques treated for 15 weeks with combination anti-retroviral therapy 
(cART), beginning on day 3 after infection, experienced sustained rebound plasma viremia when 
treatment was interrupted. We conclude that passive immunotherapy during the acute SHIV 
infection differs from cART in that it facilitates the emergence of potent CD8+ T cell immunity 
able to durably suppress virus replication.
Following an initial and massive burst of HIV replication15, viremia is incompletely 
controlled by the emergence of a virus-specific CD8+ T cell response, leading to a chronic 
phase during which the infection is never cleared16,17. Virions that integrate their DNA into 
the host cell genome become a source of virus production, which persists despite anti-
retroviral treatment over extended periods of time and gives rise to a recrudescent 
progressive infection when treatment is stopped18. This virus reservoir persists for the 
lifetime of the infected individual19.
Nonetheless, initiation of cART within 6 months of HIV-1 infection may limit damage to the 
immune system as well as the size of the reservoir, as measured by preservation of anti-virus 
T cell responses and lower levels of cell-associated viral DNA20. In a rare subpopulation of 
HIV-1 infected persons, cART initiated during the early phases of infection resulted in 
sustained control of viremia to very low levels, following treatment interruption21. Durable 
control of plasma viremia has also been reported in some SIVsmE660 infected rhesus 
macaques after anti-retroviral treatment, started 24 or 72h post IV inoculation, was 
discontinued22.
Because bNAbs suppress viremia3,23, accelerate the clearance of cell-free HIV-1 virions24, 
enhance clearance of infected cells6,25,26, and boost host humoral immunity23 in humans, 
they have the potential to mitigate deleterious events occurring during the acute infection 
and possibly alter the long-term clinical course. Consistent with this hypothesis, experiments 
in humanized mice indicate that early intervention with bNAbs may be more effective in 
preventing establishment of the reservoir than does cART5. However, humanized mice do 
not have intact immune systems, and fail to sustain infection beyond 3–4 months.
We previously reported that initiation of bNAb monotherapy, 12 weeks after SHIVAD8-EO 
inoculation, controls plasma viremia in macaques for 1 or 2 weeks, after which resistant 
viral variants emerge12. Thus, it is problematic whether even early combination bNAb

 immunotherapy might durably control viremia. To address this question, combination 
10-107413 and 3BNC11714 immunotherapy, which targets non-overlapping epitopes on the 
envelope spike, was administered to rhesus monkeys at the earliest possible time (viz. 3 days 
post infection [PI]) when we were certain that a SHIVAD8-EO infection had been established.
SHIVAD8-EO infection resembles HIV-1 infection in a number of important ways. It is R5 
tropic, generates sustained levels of plasma viremia in inoculated macaques, exhibits a Tier 
2 neutralization sensitivity phenotype, produces neutralization resistant variants in bNAb 
and ART treated animals, and causes irreversible depletions of CD4+ T cells in infected 
monkeys12,27–29 (and unpublished). Infection leads to symptomatic immunodeficiency 
associated with opportunistic infections and a fatal clinical outcome in untreated monkeys.
In the initial experiment to assess the potency of combination bNAbs during acute infection, 
6 macaques were inoculated intrarectally with 1000 TCID50 of SHIVAD8-EO, which is 
sufficient to infect all animals challenged by this route11. Beginning on day 3 after 
inoculation, each monkey received a single course of 3 weekly intravenous (IV) bNAb 
infusions (on days 3, 10, and 17 PI) of 10-107413 plus 3BNC11714. Compared to untreated 
animals, extremely low levels of plasma viremia could be detected in 2 of the 6 bNAb 
recipients during the first 30 days of infection (Fig. 1a). Plasma viremia in the other 4 
macaques was not measurable (<100 SHIV RNA copies/ml) using standard RT-PCR assays.
All 6 monkeys infused with the bNAbs experienced sustained periods of virus suppression 
lasting 56 to 177, days at which point rebound viremia occurred in 5 of the 6 treated 
macaques (Extended Data Fig. 1). Plasma viremia remained below levels of detection in the 
sixth macaque (DFIK) during the first 150 days of infection/treatment (Extended Data Fig. 
1f). As expected, the time to virus rebound was directly related to the concentration of bNAb 
in the plasma. For example, the SHIVAD8-EO rebound in macaque MVJ occurred on day 56 
when the level of 3BNC117 decayed below 1 μg/ml in plasma, whereas monkeys DEPH and 
DEWP experienced prolonged suppression of viremia before rebound was observed 
(Extended Data Fig. 1a, d, and e). We conclude that a single 2 week course of combination 
antibody therapy with 3BNC117 and 10-1074, administered early after an IR infection, can 
control SHIVAD8-EO viremia for up to 177 days.
To determine whether low-level viral replication prior to virus rebound persisted despite 
apparent control of viremia, we performed ultrasensitive nested RT PCR (qRT-PCR) on 
plasma samples from animals with viral loads below levels of detection by standard methods 
(Extended Data Table 1). For example, in macaque DEPH, which did not generate a 
detectable virus rebound until day 177 (Extended Data Fig. 2d), the ultrasensitive assay 
measured less than 2 viral RNA copies/ml in plasma, between days 34 and 106 PI, and 10 
RNA copies/ml on day 141 PI, a month prior to rebound. We conclude that low levels of 
virus are continuously being produced systemically and released into the circulation in the 
infected and bNAb treated macaques, even when plasma viremia is not detected by standard 
assays.
Two patterns of “post-rebound” plasma viremia were observed in the 6 bNAb treated 
monkeys. In the first, (DFIK, MVJ, and DEWP; Controller [Fig 2a–c]), the rebound

 SHIVAD8-EO RNA loads in plasma returned to undetectable levels after a maximum of 20 
weeks and remained so for an additional 20 to 30 weeks of observation. The second pattern 
occurred in monkeys DEPH, DFKX and DFFX (Fig. 2d–f; Non-Controller). These three 
macaques never fully controlled their viremia after rebound and displayed viral loads of 1 × 
102–103 RNA copies/ml between 110 and 130 weeks after virus inoculation.
Sustained control of plasma viremia by early bNAb therapy following a mucosal 
SHIVAD8-EO challenge in 3 of 6 monkeys suggested that the same intervention might also be 
effective against challenge by the IV route, for which a smaller virus inoculum is typically 
required to establish an infection. Macaques were therefore inoculated with either 100 or 
1000 TCID50 of SHIVAD8-EO IV and then administered 3 weekly bNAb infusions starting 
on day 3 after infection. As shown in Fig. 1b, the 4 recipients of 1000 TCID50 of virus 
showed peak plasma virus loads ranging from 4.2 × 103 to 1.1 × 104 RNA copies/ml during 
the first 2 weeks of bNAb administration. Two of the 3 recipients (DEMR and DEHW) 
inoculated with 100 TCID50 of virus IV had lower levels of plasma viremia during the early 
treatment period, and in the third animal (DEBA), viral loads remained below the level of 
detection throughout this time (Fig. 1c). Viremia declined to undetectable levels by 30 days 
following bNAb administration and remained suppressed for 48 to 110 days PI in all 7 
combination bNAb treated monkeys inoculated by the IV route (Extended Data, Fig. 2). As 
previously observed in the IR challenged animals, virus rebound in the IV inoculated 
monkeys was directly associated with the decline of circulating bNAb levels.
To determine whether virus rebound was due to declining levels of bNAbs in the plasma or 
to the emergence of mutation(s) conferring resistance, we sequenced plasma viral RNA from 
the four monkeys (DELV, DF06, DEWL, and MAF), generating detectable viremia at a time 
when the 3BNC117 mAb was not detectable, but 10-1074 mAb concentrations remained 
above threshold levels (see Extended Data Fig 2). When samples collected at the peak of 
virus rebound from these 4 animals were analyzed, no changes were observed in amplicons 
from macaques DELV and DEWL, but 9 of 18 amplified sequences from macaque DF06 
carried the N332S change and 12 of 24 amplicons from monkey MAF had the S334N 
substitution, both of which eliminated the glycan at position 332 of gp120 (Extended Data 
Fig. 3), the epitope targeted by the 10-1074 mAb. This result indicated that resistance to the 
10-1074 mAb likely occurred in these 2 animals during.
Similar to the macaques challenged by the IR route, passive immunotherapy after IV 
infection also led to sustained virus control following the resolution of rebound viremia in 
some of the challenged monkeys. In 3 macaques (DEWL, MAF, and DEMR; Controllers), 
rebound viremia remained detectable for 42 to 90 weeks, and was then followed by long 
periods (25 to 56 additional weeks) during which virus replication was stably suppressed 
below the limits of detection (Fig. 3a–c). CD4+ T cell counts were maintained at a level of 
800 cells/μl or higher in these 3 controller animals. In the second group of IV challenged 
animals (monkeys DF06, DELV, DEHW, and DEBA; Non-Controllers), virus replication 
was never completely suppressed following rebound (Fig. 3d–g). Failure to control viremia 
was associated with CD4+ T cell loss and progression to AIDS in 1 (macaque DF06) of 
these 4 monkeys.

 Humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed before and after SHIVAD8-EO 
rebound to determine whether anti-viral immunity was associated with controller status. No 
measurable correlation was observed between virus control and antibody levels. The 
controllers generated very low levels of anti-gp120 binding antibodies that were barely 
detectable by ELISA. Anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses were measured at 4 different times 
during the bNAb treatment, virus rebound, and post-rebound phases of their infections in 
both controllers and non-controllers. Although anti-SIVmac239 Gag CD8+ T cell responses 
were higher in animals challenged by the IV route, no major differences were observed 
between controllers and non-controllers (Extended Data, Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the 
polyfunctionality of the CD8+ T cell responses and distribution of CD8+ T cell memory 
subsets in IV inoculated controllers and non-controllers at different times following 
infection, treatment, and rebound were comparable (Extended Data Fig. 4b, c).
To determine whether CD8+ T cells might, in fact, be mediating the sustained suppression of 
virus replication, we initially administered the CD8 T cell depleting mAb MT807R1, which 
is specific for the CD8α chain, to all 6 controller macaques (MVJ [at day 434 PI], DEWP [at 
day 434 PI], DFIK [at day 336 PI], DEMR [at day 609 PI], MAF [at day 917 PI], and 
DEWL [at day 917 PI]) (Fig. 4a–f). All animals responded with a burst of plasma viremia, 
reaching levels between 105 and 107 viral RNA copies/ml, and which subsequently declined 
to baseline in all of the monkeys, except for DFIK.
Prior to the administration of the anti-CD8α mAb, quantitative virus outgrowth assays were 
performed on samples collected from the 6 controllers to measure the frequency of 
circulating CD4+ T cells releasing replication-competent virions. As shown in Extended 
Data Table 2, less than 1 in 106 CD4+ T cells carrying infectious virus was detected in all of 
the controller monkeys immediately before infusion of the depleting anti-CD8α mAb. 
Interestingly, in 5 of the 6 anti-CD8α mAb recipients in which plasma viremia had returned 
to baseline levels following mAb infusion, the frequency of cells carrying replication-
competent virus, determined by virus outgrowth assays, was also less than 1 in 106 CD4+ T 
cells (Extended data Table 2).
A major deficiency of using the anti-CD8α mAb to deplete CD8+ T cells is that NK, NKT 
and γδ T cells are also targeted for depletion, as documented by FACS analyses for 
monkeys MVJ, DEWL, and DEMR (Extended Data Fig 5a,b). We therefore administered 
the CD8b255R1 anti-CD8β mAb, which specifically targets macaque CD8+ T cells, to 
deplete CD8+ T cells in these same 3 controller monkeys. As shown in Fig. 4a–c (red 
arrows), infusion of the anti-CD8β mAb caused an immediate increase in plasma virus 
loads, a decline in levels of CD3+ CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5c), and no changes in 
circulating CD3–CD8+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d). We conclude that CD8+ T cells are 
responsible for control of virus replication in controller macaques and depletion of this 
subset leads to recrudescence of viremia.
Although the non-controller monkeys failed to suppress plasma viremia to undetectable 
levels, 4 (DFKX, DFFX, DEHW, and DEBA) of 7 of these macaques have maintained low 
virus loads (105 to 385 RNA copies/ml) and did not experience significant changes in levels 
of circulating CD4+ T cell for 2 to 3 years after SHIVAD8-EO infection (Figs. 2 and 3). Taken

 together, this indicates that 10 (6 controllers and 4 non-controllers) of the 13 bNAb treated 
monkeys benefited from early immunotherapy.
As a control for bNAb immunotherapy during the acute SHIVAD8-EO infection, 3 macaques 
were inoculated by the IR route and treated daily with cART for 15 weeks, starting on day 3 
after infection. This course of cART corresponded to the mean time period during which 2 
weeks of bNAb therapy suppressed virus replication prior to rebound. cART therapy 
controlled and maintained undetectable levels of viremia for the entire 15 week treatment 
period (Extended Data Fig. 6). However, all 3 animals developed high sustained levels of 
plasma viremia following cessation of cART and none became controllers.
We speculate that the continuous production of low levels of progeny virions, as measured 
by ultrasensitive RT PCR (Extended Table 1) during the 50–140 day period before virus 
rebound in the antibody treated macaques, could drive the formation of immune complexes. 
Antigen-presenting dendritic cells expressing activating Fc receptors can bind to these 
immune complexes, leading to their activation and efficient antigen processing for 
presentation and cross-presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells30. In contrast, the near 
complete inhibition of virus replication by the cART regimen employed may limit the 
amount of viral antigen available to induce immunity.
As proof of concept, our results demonstrate that a SHIV infection, established during the 
acute phase, can, in fact, be controlled. They also suggest that a delicate balance may exist 
between: 1) preservation of helper CD4+ T cells; 2) the size and stability of the virus 
reservoir; and 3) the continuous production of sufficient quantities of antigen to generate a 
potent and sustained CD8+ T cell response. Although rhesus macaque infections with SHIV 
differs from HIV-1 infections in a number of important ways, immunotherapy should be 
explored as a way to control systemic dissemination of virus, contain damage to the CD4+ T 
cell lineage, and mobilize a robust immune response that may be capable of controlling the 
infection in humans.
METHODS
Animal experiments
Eighteen 2 to 4 year old male and female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Indian 
genetic origin were housed and cared for in accordance with Guide for Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals Report number NIH 82-53 (Department of Health and Human Services, 
Bethesda, Maryland, 1985) in a biosafety level 2 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAID) facility. All animal procedures and experiments were performed 
according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of 
NIAID, NIH. Animals were not randomized and the data collected were not blinded. 
Phlebotomies, euthanasia, and sample collection were performed as previously described31. 
All of the macaques used in this study were negative for the major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) class I Mamu-A*01, Mamu-B*08, and Mamu-B*17 alleles. No animals 
were excluded from the analysis.

 Antibodies
The 3BNC117 and 10-1074 anti-HIV-1 monoclonal NAbs were isolated and produced as 
described elsewhere13,14. MAb 10-1074 was produced by transient transfection of IgH and 
IgL expression plasmids into the human embryonic kidney cells whereas 3BNC117 were 
produced from Chinese hamster ovary cells. All of the MAbs were IgG1. All of the 
monoclonal antibodies were purified by chromatography and sterile filtration and were 
endotoxin free. A combination of single dose (10 mg kg−1) of each MAb was administered 
intravenously to individual animals.
ART regimen
Three animals were treated with a three-drug ART regimen comprising two nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (tenofovir [PMPA] and emtricitabine [FTC]) and one 
integrase inhibitor (raltegravir [RAL]). PMPA and FTC were administered intramuscularly 
once a day at dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, respectively. RAL was administered orally 
(mixed with food) at a dosage of 200 mg twice a day. The macaques received the ART 
regimen for 15 weeks, starting on the day 3-post virus challenge.
Virus challenge
The origin and preparation of the tissue-culture-derived SHIVAD8-EO stock have been 
previously described29. Animals were challenged with SHIVAD8-EO intravenously (100 or 
1000 TCID50) or intrarectally (1000 TCID50). For intrarectal inoculation, a paediatric nasal 
speculum was used to gently open the rectum and a 1 ml suspension of virus was slowly 
infused into rectal cavity using a plastic tuberculin syringe as previously described5. 1000 
TCID50 of SHIVAD8-EO administered intrarectally has resulted in the establishment of 
infections in 30 of 30 rhesus monkeys11,29 and unpublished data).
Quantification of plasma viral RNA
Viral RNA levels in plasma were determined by qRT–PCR (ABI Prism 7900HT sequence 
detection system; Applied Biosystems) as previously described1. Ultrasensitive 
measurement of plasma SIV gag RNA was performed as described previously32.
Lymphocyte immunophenotyping and intracellular-cytokine assays
EDTA-treated blood samples were stained for flow cytometric analysis for lymphocyte 
immunophenotyping as previously described28.
Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS)
Cryopreserved macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were thawed and 
rested overnight in a 37C/5% CO2 incubator. The next morning, cells were stimulated with 
HIV Clade B envelope and SIVMac239 gag peptide pools (final concentration of 2 μg/ml) in 
the presence of Brefeldin A, monensin, and CD107a-Cy5 PE (clone H4A3, BD Biosciences, 
San Jose, California) for 6 h. Negative controls received an equal concentration of DMSO 
instead of peptides. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed as described33 except the 
following monoclonal antibodies were used: CD4-Cy5.5 PE (clone S3.5; Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA), CD8-BV570 (clone RPA-T8; BioLegend), CD45RA-Cy5 PE (clone 5H9,

 BD Biosciences), PD-1-BV785 (clone EH12.2H7, BioLegend), CCR7-BV650 (clone 
G043H7, BioLegend), CD39-PerCpeF710 (clone eBioA1, e Bioscience), MIP-1B-PE (clone 
D21-1351, BD Biosciences), Granzyme B-APC (clone GB12, Invitrogen), CD69-ECD 
(clone TP1.55.3; Beckman Coulter), CD3-Cy7APC (clone SP34.2; BD Biosciences), IFNγ-
Alexa700 (clone B27; BioLegend), IL-2-BV605 (clone MQ1-17H12; BD Biosciences), 
IL-10-BV421 (clone JES3-9D7, BD Biosciences), and TNF-FITC (clone Mab11; BD 
Biosciences). Aqua LIVE/DEAD kit (Invitrogen) was used to exclude dead cells. All 
antibodies were previously titrated to determine the optimal concentration. Samples were 
acquired on an LSR II flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo version 9.6.3 (Treestar, 
Inc., Ashland, OR).
Measurement of anti-gp120 antibodies
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies generated against the 
HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein was performed as previously described27.
MAb concentrations in plasma
Plasma concentrations of 10-1074 and 3BNC117 NAbs were separately determined against 
HIV-1 virus strains that are sensitive to one but not the other monoclonal antibody as 
previously described12.
Quantitative virus outgrowth assay
Macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque 
density gradient centrifugation. CD4+ T cells were isolated from the PBMCs using a cell 
enrichment cocktail (Stemcell Technologies) and enumerated using an automatic cell 
counter (Muse Cell Analyzer, EMD Millipore). The frequency of circulating CD4+ T cells 
carrying replication-competent virus was determined using quantitative co-culture assays as 
previously described34. Briefly, serially diluted CD4+ T cells (five-fold dilutions from 1x106 
to 320 cells per well in duplicate) as well as replicates of 1×106 cells were stimulated with 
irradiated PBMCs from healthy HIV-negative donors in the presence of 1μg/ml of anti-CD3 
antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 24 hours. In order to further propagate the virus produced by 
the SHIV-infected CD4+ T cells, anti-CD3-stimulated, CD8-depleted PBMCs from healthy 
HIV-negative donors were added to the culture on days 1 and 7 followed by periodic 
removal of cell suspensions and replenishment of culture medium. Following up to 21 days 
of incubation periods, wells positive for SHIV-AD8 were identified by SIV p27 Antigen 
Capture Assay (Advanced Bioscience Laboratories) and infectious units per million cells 
were determined by a maximum likelihood method35.
CD8+ T lymphocyte depletion in vivo
Six controller animals were injected subcutaneously with anti-CD8 mAbα M-T807R1 
(National Institutes of Health Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource Program) (10 mg kg−1) 
on day 0, and intravenously (5 mg kg−1) on days 3, 7, and 1036. Three of the six controller 
animals were also injected intravenously with anti-CD8β mAb CD8b255R1 (National 
Institutes of Health Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource Program) (50 mg kg−1).

 Figure 1. Control of SHIVAD8-EO replication by a 2-week course of combination bNAb therapy
a, Six macaques were inoculated intrarectally with 1000 TCID50 of SHIVAD8-EO and were 
treated with 10-1074 plus 3BNC117 (10mg/kg of each) mAbs on days 3, 10, and 17 PI. 
Gray curves denote replication profiles of 6 similarly inoculated but untreated animals. 
Macaques inoculated intravenously with 1000 TCID50 (b) or 100 TCID50 (c) of 
SHIVAD8-EO were treated with 10-1074 plus 3BNC117 mAbs as in panel a. Gray curves in 
panel b indicate the replication kinetics of four untreated monkeys inoculated intravenously 
with 5000 or 500 TCID50 of SHIVAD8-EO. Plasma viral loads were measured by the 
standard RT-PCR assay (limit of detection 100 SHIV RNA copies/ml) at the indicated times.
