EXTENDED REPORT
Dietary intake of fibre and risk of knee osteoarthritis 
in two US prospective cohorts
Zhaoli Dai,1 Jingbo Niu,1 Yuqing Zhang,1 Paul Jacques,2 David T Felson1,3
ABSTRACT
Objectives Dietary fibre reduces body weight and 
inflammation both of which are linked with knee 
osteoarthritis (OA). We examined the association 
between fibre intake and risk of knee OA.
Methods We used data from the Osteoarthritis 
Initiative (OAI) of 4796 participants and Framingham 
Offspring Osteoarthritis Study (Framingham) of 1268 
persons. Dietary intake of fibre was estimated at 
baseline, and incident radiographic OA (ROA) and 
symptomatic OA (SxOA) were followed annually 
until 48 months in OAI and assessed 9 years later in 
Framingham. Knee pain worsening was also examined in 
OAI. Generalised estimating equations were applied in 
multivariable regression models.
Results In OAI, we identified 861 knees with 
SxOA, 152 knees with ROA and 1964 knees with 
pain worsening among 4051 subjects with valid 
dietary intake (baseline mean age: 61.2 years; mean 
body mass index (BMI): 28.6). In Framingham, 143 
knees with SxOA and 175 knees with ROA among 
971 such subjects (baseline mean age: 53.9 years; 
mean BMI: 27.0) were identified. In both cohorts, 
dietary total fibre was inversely associated with risk 
of SxOA (p trend <0.03) with significantly lower risk 
at the highest versus lowest quartile (OR (95% CI): 
0.70 (0.52, 0.94) for OAI and 0.39 (0.17, 0.88) for 
Framingham). Furthermore, dietary total and cereal 
fibre were significantly inversely associated with knee 
pain worsening in OAI (p trend <0.02). No apparent 
association was found with ROA.
Conclusions Findings from two longitudinal studies 
consistently showed that higher total fibre intake was 
related to a lower risk of SxOA, while the relation to ROA 
was unclear.
Dietary fibres are carbohydrates, primarily from 
plant-based foods such as cereal grains, fruits and 
vegetables, and nuts and legumes. Fibre is not 
digestible or absorbable in the small intestine but 
is partially or fully fermented in the colon.1 Epide-
miological studies suggest that fibre is associated 
with lower risks of cardiovascular diseases,2 type 
2 diabetes3 4 and mortality.5 Furthermore, clinical 
trials have shown the beneficial effect of dietary 
fibre in reducing body weight,6–8 blood pressure9 
and circulating C reactive protein (CRP),10 and in 
improving glycaemic control.11 12 Such protective 
effects of dietary fibre are likely attributed to its 
intrinsic property of entrapping sugars and fats to 
promote satiety and reduce calorie intake,13 reduce 
serum cholesterol2 and improve glycaemic control12 
as well as to its prebiotic function through fermen-
tation in the gut to stimulate desirable microbiome 
to lower infection and inflammation.14
As the most common joint disorder, osteoar-
thritis (OA) is highly prevalent among adults aged 
≥60 years.15 16 Largely due to pain and limited 
physical function, OA is a leading cause of disability 
and impairment of quality of life;17 however, no 
effective structure-modifying treatment is available 
to date. Like metabolic diseases, there is a strong 
link between obesity, inflammation and knee OA, 
where obesity both increases loading in weight-
bearing joints18–21 and proinflammatory cytokines 
and adipokines;22 and increased inflammation and 
synovitis23 24 have been shown to be associated with 
joint pain.
In light of the relation of dietary fibre to body 
weight and inflammation, we initially examined 
the association between fibre intake and knee OA 
in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and, as shown 
below, found a protective association of fibre intake 
with symptomatic OA (SxOA) and knee pain wors-
ening. We sought confirmation using a second 
cohort in hope of replicating these results and 
better addressing dietary confounders in the Fram-
ingham Offspring Study, which was designed to 
more comprehensively assess diet. The objective of 
this study was to examine the association between 
dietary fibre and knee OA phenotypes including 
symptomatic knee OA (SxOA), radiographic knee 
OA (ROA) and knee pain worsening in two US 
cohorts.
METHODS
Study population
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)
OAI is a multi-centre, longitudinal prospective 
cohort of 4796 US men (41.5%) and women aged 
45–79 years with or at risk of knee OA recruited 
from 2004 to 2006 to investigate OA risk factors. 
Details of the study protocol can be found else-
where.25 
After 
enrolment, 
participants 
were 
followed for OA assessment annually until 48 
months.
Framingham Offspring cohort (Framingham)
Participants from the Framingham Offspring 
cohort, which was assembled in 1971 consisting of 
adult children of the Original Framingham Study 
and spouses of the offspring participants.26 The 
goal of the Offspring OA study was to investigate 
inheritance of OA among study participants who 
represent a community-based population unse-
lected for OA or knee pain.27 During a callback 
visit after the Offspring exam 5 (1993–1994), 1268

Clinical and epidemiological research
eligible subjects (men: 43.9%, mean age 53.2 years) as baseline 
of the OA study, weight-bearing radiographs of both knees and 
surveys about knee pain were obtained. The same assessments 
were performed among the same subjects after an average of 9.5 
years at exam 7 (2002–2005).28
In both studies, we excluded those who had rheumatoid 
arthritis or other forms of inflammatory arthritis. Institutional 
Review Board approval was obtained from all OAI study sites 
in OAI and from Boston University for the Framingham Study.
Baseline assessment
In both studies, information was collected including demo-
graphics, history of knee injury and surgery (including total knee 
replacement), medication use, tobacco and alcohol use, physical 
activity assessed by the Physical Activity in the Elderly Scale (PASE) 
and habitual diet recorded using the validated food frequency 
questionnaires (FFQs). Based on the major food sources of fibre, 
total dietary fibre was derived as sum of fibre from cereal grain, 
fruits and vegetables, and nuts and legumes. We only included 
participants with valid fibre (no missing values for total dietary 
fibre) and calorie intake (≥500 
kcal and <4200 
kcal for men and 
<4000 
kcal for women). Anthropometric parameters including 
body weight, height and abdominal (OAI)/waist (Framingham) 
circumference were measured.25 26 Knee symptom assessment 
using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoar-
thritis Index (WOMAC) was available at all exams in OAI but 
was only assessed in exam 7 in Framingham.
Baseline dietary fibre estimation
Osteoarthritis Initiative
Dietary fibre intake was estimated using the Block Brief 2000 
FFQ of 60 food items.29 30 For each food item, frequency 
consumption was surveyed according to nine predetermined 
categories ranging from never to everyday with illustrations of 
standard portion sizes. Estimation of nutrient intake was calcu-
lated based on the nutrient composition values developed in the 
Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.29
Framingham Study
Habitual dietary intake was recorded at baseline (exam 5) and 
4 years later at exam 6 (1998–2001) via the Harvard validated 
semi-quantitative FFQ.31 The FFQ listed 126 items of foods in 
standard serving sizes and nine frequency categories ranging 
from ‘never or less than once per month’ to ‘6+ per day.’ 
Participants were allowed to add up to three additional foods, 
types of breakfast cereal and cooking oil that are not listed in 
the FFQ. Nutrient values were estimated and primarily relied 
on the US Department of Agriculture food composition data-
base and supplemented by other published data.31 Additionally, 
glycaemic load for each food was calculated to estimate glucose 
effect. The Dietary Guidelines Adherence Index (DGAI-2010) 
score was applied to the baseline FFQ to determine diet quality 
according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010.32 
Detail of the DGAI-2010 has been described33 and scores range 
from 0 (lowest adherence) to 100 (highest adherence). Because 
dietary fibre is one of the 24 components in the DGAI-2010, the 
modified DGAI-2010 used in this study excluded fibre.
Assessment of knee OA outcomes
Osteoarthritis Initiative
At each exam, subjects were asked about knee pain using the 
following question: ‘During the past 30 days, have you had 
pain, aching, or stiffness in your right/left knee on most days?’ 
and a positive response was used to define a painful knee. Knee 
pain was also assessed using the WOMAC pain subscale ranging 
from 0 (no pain) to 20 (most pain) points. All subjects obtained 
a fixed flexion posterior–anterior radiograph, which was read 
centrally for Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade. OA outcomes 
of interest included incident (1) ROA if a knee developed a 
KL grade ≥2 at follow-up, (2) SxOA, new onset of a combina-
tion of a painful knee and ROA and (3) knee pain worsening, 
if WOMAC pain score difference of a knee between baseline 
and each annual exam ≥14% of the base score defined in the 
published estimates for the minimal clinical important difference 
in WOMAC.34 Additional detail for knee pain worsening can be 
found in online supplementary file text 1. For incident SxOA 
or ROA, we excluded those with prevalence at baseline for the 
corresponding outcome.
Framingham Study
After subjects had completed the baseline and follow-up exams, 
radiographs at both exams were read independently by two 
study readers among a sample of 1268 eligible subjects.28 The 
same definitions as OAI were applied to Framingham to define 
incident ROA and SxOA after excluding prevalent knees with 
these conditions.
Statistical analysis
For both studies, we calculated the residual of dietary fibre by 
regressing fibre intake on total calories within each cohort.35 
Quartile cut-offs for dietary fibre were created based on the 
calculated residuals35 within men and women separately to 
account for sex differences in dietary intake. The rationale to 
use the residual method is described in online supplementary 
file text 2. Dietary intake was estimated by a semi-quantitative 
FFQ, which is suitable to rank individuals with regard to their 
intake.36 We examined the relation of dietary fibre to the risk of 
knee OA by comparing a higher quartile (Q2, Q3 and Q4) to the 
lowest quartile (Q1: reference category), using generalised esti-
mating equations to account for correlation between two knees 
for each participant37 in both studies and for the analysis of pain 
worsening to account for repeated WOMAC pain measures 
annually in OAI.
In the base model (model 1), we adjusted for age (years), sex 
(men vs women), race (white vs non-white in OAI) and total 
energy intake (kcal); model 2 was further adjusted for educa-
tion attainment (below vs college or above), annual household 
income (<US$50 000 vs ≥US$50 000), smoking status (never, 
former and current smokers), physical activity (PASE, contin-
uous) and other dietary factors including dietary vitamin C (mg/
day), K (µg/day), polyunsaturated fat (g/day), saturated fats, 
which have been shown to relate to OA in previous studies.38–42 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use (yes vs no) was 
further adjusted for pain worsening in OAI. In Framingham, 
we also controlled for glycaemic load, which has been found 
to be inversely related to the Mediterranean diet in model 
2.43 44 In a separate model (model 3), we adjusted for the same 
covariates in model 2 except replacing the dietary variables with 
DGAI-2010 to account for diet quality. In addition, we further 
adjusted for baseline body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) in addi-
tion to the full model in both studies. Linear trends were tested 
using the median value of each quartile of dietary fibre as a 
continuous variable in the model. Because there was no signif-
icant difference between genders in the fibre–OA associations, 
we combined men and women for the descriptive characteristics 
and regression analysis.

Clinical and epidemiological research
Consistency of our results was tested by stratifying socioeco-
nomic status and replacing BMI with abdominal/waist circum-
ference (cm) as a covariate in the full model. All statistical anal-
ysis was conducted using SAS V
.9.3. A p value <0.05 (two sided) 
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
At the end of the study course, 540 (11%) among 4796 partic-
ipants in OAI and 131 persons (11.9%) among 1268 persons 
in Framingham were lost to follow-up. Figure 1 describes the 
eligible participants and knees included in the final analyses.
We summarised baseline characteristics across quartiles of 
total fibre intake by each cohort study (table 1). In both studies, 
those who consumed more fibre were older, had lower BMI and 
were more educated. They were less likely to have knee pain 
symptoms and consumed higher amount of vitamins C and K 
and less dietary saturated fats.
The associations between dietary fibre and phenotypes of 
knee OA in OAI are presented in table 2. For total dietary fibre, 
compared with the lowest quartile (Q1), there was a significant 
dose-dependent inverse relationship for the risks of SxOA and 
knee worsening (p trend ≤0.005): at the highest quartile (Q4), 
risks of SxOA and knee pain worsening were lowered signifi-
cantly by 30% (OR (95% CI): 0.70 (0.52 to 0.94)) and 19% 
(OR (95% CI): 0.81 (0.71 to 0.94)), respectively. Although 
non-statistically significant, similar results for fibre from cereal 
grains and from fruits and vegetables were observed. Signifi-
cant inverse relationship was also found between cereal fibre 
and pain worsening (p trend <0.02) with a 14% lower risk 
in those at Q4 relative to Q1. No association was found for

incident ROA or between fibre from nuts and legumes and 
knee OA.
The association of dietary fibre with knee OA in Framingham 
is presented in table 3. There was a significant dose-dependent 
inverse relationship between dietary total fibre and risk of SxOA 
in all models (p trend <0.03). Participants who consumed the 
highest quartile (Q4) of total fibre compared with the lowest 
quartile (Q1) had significantly lower risk by 61% [OR (95% 
CI): 
0.39 (0.17 to 0.88)] in the full model adjusted for diet quality 
(DQAI-2010). Similarly inverse trends for fibre from other 
sub-categories were noted although these were not statis-
tical significant. The associations with incident ROA were not 
apparent.
In the full model with further adjustment for BMI, we found 
an attenuated but significant inverse relation of dietary total fibre 
to risk of SxOA (p trend=0.03 in both studies) and to knee pain 
worsening (p trend=0.03 in OAI). Results for the association 
between dietary fibre and incident SxOA or knee pain worsening 
did not differ by stratum of obesity (BMI <30 
vs BMI ≥30) as 
evidenced by a p value for interaction greater than 0.05 between 
obesity status and quartile dietary total fibre. Secondary analysis 
showed that dietary fibre was inversely associated with risk of 
SxOA or knee pain worsening independent of waist circumfer-
ence in both studies (see online supplementary file tables 1-2) 
and regardless of socioeconomic status (see online supplemen-
tary file tables 3-4).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this was the first study in the literature inves-
tigating the association between dietary fibre and OA outcomes. 
Our results consistently showed that in two prospective US 
cohorts with different study designs and study populations, those 
who consumed higher fibre intake were less likely to develop 
SxOA or to experience worsening knee pain during the study 
course regardless of socioeconomic or obesity status. These data 
demonstrate a consistent protective association between total 
fibre intake and symptom-related knee OA in two study popula-
tions with careful adjustment for potential confounders.
There is increasing evidence suggesting that OA shares similar 
metabolic characteristics including obesity, dyslipidaemia and 
inflammation with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.45 Our 
findings are consistent with those showing that higher dietary 
total fibre intake reduced risks of cardiovascular diseases46 
and reduced fasting glucose in type 2 diabetes.12 The results of 
non-statistical associations for fibre from other diet sources with 
OA are similar with findings in cardiovascular diseases2 47 and 
mortality5 after controlling for various risk factors and covari-
ates. Furthermore, these results are consistent with our report on 
high fibre intake with lower risks of moderate and severe knee 
pain trajectories over 8 years in OAI.48 In OAI and Framingham, 
an inverse relationship was found between dietary fibre and 
BMI and between BMI and incident SxOA (p<0.01). Additional 
adjustment for baseline BMI attenuated the results compared 
with those without such adjustment. We have not tested for 
whether fibre’s association with OA is mediated by BMI which 
could, in part, explain the dilution of the risk estimates after 
controlling for BMI.
The study design and participants’ characteristics are different 
between the cohorts. Additionally, there were strengths and 
weaknesses in the assessment of exposure (fibre intake) and OA 
outcomes of interest between the studies (see online supple-
mentary file text 3). The inverse association between total fibre 
intake and knee pain worsening further confirmed the results 
of SxOA. Using data from two cohorts to assess the relation of 
detary fibre to OA reduced biases due to potential confounding 
and misclassification of exposures and outcomes.
The estimation for total fibre intake on average is 18.8 (SD 
7.8 g/day) in Framingham and is 15.0 (7.3) in OAI. Such esti-
mated values for daily fibre intake are comparable with the 
average intake (15 g/day) among Americans.13 Furthermore, 
because those who consume more fibre tend to better adhere 
to the dietary guidelines (table 1), we adjusted for diet quality 
(DGAI-2010) and found a similar significant inverse associa-
tion in Framingham. Additionally, a statistically significant 
inverse relationship was found between the average intake of 
dietary fibre from baseline to 4 years later and incident SxOA 
(p trend=0.047) in Framingham. The similar effect estimates 
in all models further suggest that the association of dietary 
total fibre and risk of symptom related knee OA may not be 
affected by the risk factors, lifestyle and dietary confounders 
we accounted for.
In this study, although we did not find a statistically signifi-
cant association between dietary fibre and radiographic OA, we 
cannot rule out the possibility that fibre may reduce the risk of 
ROA by lowering BMI20 which may not be detectable because of 
a bias due to depletion of susceptibility to knee ROA49 (see online 
supplementary file text 4). Also, serum CRP level, a marker of 
systemic inflammation, has been shown to play a greater role 
in symptoms than radiographic changes in OA.24 Additionally, 
synovitis has been related to knee pain in persons with ROA.50 
If one of the biological mechanisms for dietary fibre and knee 
OA is to lower inflammation, its effect on SxOA may be more

Clinical and epidemiological research
apparent compared with structural deterioration presented by 
ROA.
Strengths of this study included using data from two prospec-
tive cohorts where one is a multicentre and multiethnic cohort 
targeting to older Americans at risk or with OA and the other 
is a community-based population study. Therefore, using two 
different studies to assess fibre intake and OA outcomes in 
studying the association between dietary fibre and risk of knee 
OA improves internal validity. However, as a limitation, partic-
ipants in OAI had higher BMI, and those in Framingham were 
selected regardless of their risk for OA. Such selection criteria 
in OAI might introduce collider bias by conditioning on BMI, 
where an unknown confounder (say, a genetic factor for obesity) 
affects BMI and knee OA and may negatively relate to dietary 
fibre. Our reported risk estimates for the association between 
fibre intake and knee OA could be diluted towards the null due 
to such collider bias. However, this would not have been true for 
analyses of Framingham data. Another limitation is that self-re-
ported dietary data are prone to biases and potentially results 
in non-differential misclassification of fibre consumption, even 
though this is likely to lead to an underestimate of the observed 
associations. Inevitably, results from observational studies do 
not prove causality and may still raise concerns about residual 
confounding. Ultimately randomised trials are needed to prove 
causation, but observational and other studies are needed first to 
provide empirical evidence. As for dietary fibre, evidence from 
randomised clinical trials have demonstrated its effects on body 
weight,6–8 blood pressure,9 CRP10 and glycaemia control.11 12 
Many of these are of relevance to OA. This suggests that the asso-
ciation of fibre with OA uncovered in our data may be genuine 
and unlikely due to the threats to internal validity.51 Nonethe-
less, findings in these two studies need further corroboration.
In conclusion, data from two US prospective cohorts demon-
strated that higher dietary total fibre intake was associated with 
lower risks of SxOA and pain worsening of the knee, while the 
association with radiographic OA was not apparent. Such results 
support the current recommended daily fibre for older Ameri-
cans.52
