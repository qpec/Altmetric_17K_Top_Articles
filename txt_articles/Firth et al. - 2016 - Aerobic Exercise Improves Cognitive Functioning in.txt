Cognitive deficits are pervasive among people with schizo-
phrenia and treatment options are limited. There has been 
an increased interest in the neurocognitive benefits of exer-
cise, but a comprehensive evaluation of studies to date is 
lacking. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of all con-
trolled trials investigating the cognitive outcomes of exer-
cise interventions in schizophrenia. Studies were identified 
from a systematic search across major electronic databases 
from inception to April 2016. Meta-analyses were used to 
calculate pooled effect sizes (Hedges g) and 95% CIs. We 
identified 10 eligible trials with cognitive outcome data 
for 385 patients with schizophrenia. Exercise significantly 
improved global cognition (g = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.13–0.53, 
P = .001) with no statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). The 
effect size in the 7 studies which were randomized con-
trolled trials was g = 0.43 (P < .001). Meta-regression 
analyses indicated that greater amounts of exercise are 
associated with larger improvements in global cognition 
(β = .005, P = .065). Interventions which were supervised 
by physical activity professionals were also more effective 
(g = 0.47, P < .001). Exercise significantly improved the 
cognitive domains of working memory (g = 0.39, P = .024, 
N = 7, n = 282), social cognition (g = 0.71, P = .002, 
N = 3, n = 81), and attention/vigilance (g = 0.66, P = .005, 
N = 3, n = 104). Effects on processing speed, verbal mem-
ory, visual memory and reasoning and problem solving were 
not significant. This meta-analysis provides evidence that 
exercise can improve cognitive functioning among people 
with schizophrenia, particularly from interventions using 
higher dosages of exercise. Given the challenges in improv-
ing cognition, and the wider health benefits of exercise, a 
greater focus on providing supervised exercise to people 
with schizophrenia is needed.

Introduction
Schizophrenia is associated with impairments in cogni-
tive functioning.1 Deficits of 1–2 SDs below the general 
population are evident in various domains of cognition 
from the onset of illness and persist over time.2 These 
cognitive impairments contribute significantly to the 
poor functional outcomes and long-term disability often 
observed among patients.1 Antipsychotic medications 
have little impact on improving cognition,3 and other 
pharmacological approaches towards treating cognitive 
deficits have demonstrated limited efficacy thus far.4
Nonpharmacological interventions have been devel-
oped to specifically target cognitive symptoms, includ-
ing cognitive remediation therapy (CRT). CRT involves 
completing tasks designed to train various cognitive 
functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solv-
ing skills. A meta-analysis of 40 studies with 2104 par-
ticipants found that CRT improves cognitive functioning

Exercise Improves Cognition in Schizophrenia
significantly more than control conditions, with effect 
sizes within the moderate range.5 However, CRT has only 
a small effect on psychiatric symptoms, and improve-
ments are lost over time.5
Novel nonpharmacological strategies that can improve 
cognition, symptoms, and socio-occupational function-
ing would provide valuable adjunctive treatments for 
schizophrenia. A number of recent meta-analyses have 
shown that physical activity, and particularly structured 
exercise, can significantly improve positive symptoms, 
negative symptoms, and social functioning in this popu-
lation.6–8 Furthermore, by increasing cardiorespiratory 
fitness and metabolic health, exercise may also reduce the 
physical health problems associated with schizophrenia, 
such as obesity and diabetes, which contribute towards 
reduced life expectancy.9
In the general population, exercise has been shown to 
have modest effects on attention, processing speed, mem-
ory, and executive functioning,10 perhaps through stimu-
lating neuroplasticity.11 Exercise has also been found to 
increase hippocampal volume and white matter integrity 
in healthy older adults12,13 and those with schizophre-
nia.14,15 Additionally, cross-sectional research in people 
with schizophrenia has demonstrated that physical activ-
ity and fitness are associated with better cognitive per-
formance,16 greater grey and white matter volumes,17 
and higher levels of neurotrophic factors which promote 
brain plasticity.18 A number of narrative reviews have 
also discussed the potential benefits of exercise on brain 
health and cognition.19–21 However, earlier meta-analyses 
of exercise in schizophrenia have not been able to deter-
mine the effects on cognition due to insufficient data 
(including only 2–4 aerobic exercise trials for each cog-
nitive domain),8 although many additional studies have 
since been published.
The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect 
of exercise on global cognition in people with schizophre-
nia, along with examining which domains of cognitive 
functioning are most sensitive to exercise interventions. 
We also sought to explore the impact of various patient 
and intervention characteristics which affect the out-
comes of exercise interventions, using meta-regression 
analyses.
Methods
This meta-analysis followed the PRISMA statement22 
to ensure comprehensive and transparent reporting of 
methods and results.
Search Strategy
Two independent authors (J.F. and B.S.) conducted an 
electronic database search of Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment 
Database, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), 
HMIC Health Management Information Consortium, 
Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase from inception 
to April 2016. The search terms used were: “schizo*” or 
“psychosis” or “psychotic” and “exercise” or “physical 
activity” or “fitness” or “aerobic” or “resistance training” 
and “neuro*” or “cogniti*”. A search of Google Scholar 
was conducted using the same key words to identify any 
additional relevant articles. The reference lists of retrieved 
articles were also searched. Only English-language 
research articles were included in the review.
Eligibility Criteria
We aimed to include all published studies examining 
the neurocognitive outcomes of exercise interventions 
for people with schizophrenia, in comparison to a con-
trol condition. Eligible populations included any sample 
in which the majority of patients were being treated for 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Specifically, 
studies which included a broad spectrum of psychiatric 
disorders were only included if >80% of the sample had 
a clinically diagnosed nonaffective psychotic disorder. 
Data from studies in which <80% of the sample had a 
nonaffective psychotic disorder were only eligible if the 
outcome data specifically for the schizophrenia/nonaffec-
tive psychosis subgroup could be accurately determined.
For the purpose of this review, exercise was defined 
as structured and repetitive physical activity that has an 
objective of improving or maintaining physical fitness.23 
Interventions using only yoga or tai-chi were excluded 
from the analyses, as these theoretically confer benefits 
for cognition which are distinct from the physical activ-
ity itself.24 Studies which implemented physical activity 
as an active-control condition for cognitive training inter-
ventions were not used in the analyses (unless a passive 
control arm was also available for comparisons with exer-
cise). Interventions which combined exercise with other 
psychosocial or pharmacological treatments were only 
included if the nonexercise aspects of the intervention 
were controlled for in the comparison conditions.
Data Extraction
Articles were independently screened by 2 reviewers 
(J.F. and B.S.) to assess eligibility. Disagreements were 
resolved through discussion until consensus was reached. 
A systematic tool was used to extract all of the following 
data from each study:
1. Primary outcome—global cognition: This was defined 
as average change in all clinically validated measures 
of cognitive functioning following an exercise interven-
tion (or control condition). Where changes in multiple 
cognitive tasks/domains were reported, a composite 
change score was calculated from the average change 
in each individual task/cognitive domain. This method 
has been applied in previous meta-analyses examining

the effects of cognitive training interventions in schizo-
phrenia.5,25 All neurocognitive tasks used to calculate 
these composite scores are shown in supplementary 
material 1.
2. Secondary outcomes—individual cognitive domains: 
Effects of exercise in individual cognitive domains 
were examined with respect to the categories estab-
lished by the NIMH-MATRICS Neurocognition 
Committee, based on factor analytic studies of the 
structure of cognition in schizophrenia,26 and subse-
quently used to guide the structure of the MATRICS 
Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB).27 This specifies 
7 individual domains of cognition which are: speed of 
processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, ver-
bal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, 
reasoning and problem solving, and social cogni-
tion. Where studies had not used the gold-standard 
MCCB itself, the tasks used were categorized into their 
respective domains,26 as in previous meta-analyses.5,25  
supplementary material 1 displays the categorization 
of all cognitive tasks used in meta-analyses.
3. Potential moderators: Data on factors which may influ-
ence the effect size of exercise interventions were also 
extracted from each study, including sample character-
istics (age, gender distribution, years of illness dura-
tion), exercise intervention characteristics (minutes 
of exercise per week, length of intervention in weeks, 
improvements in fitness/maximal oxygen uptake, pro-
fessional background of instructor), and study design 
(control condition used and trial quality).
Where unreported study data were required to deter-
mine eligibility or for meta-analyses, the corresponding 
authors of respective studies were contacted up to 2 times 
to request the variables of interest.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were performed in Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis 2.0,28 with a random-effects model applied 
throughout to account for the expected heterogeneity 
between studies.29 Pooled effect sizes for exercise on both 
global cognition and each individual cognitive domain 
were calculated as Hedges’ g using the mean change scores 
(and SDs) in exercise and control conditions. Where raw 
means were not reported, the effect size was computed 
from F-statistics or t values. The heterogeneity between 
studies was quantified using Cochran’s Q and I2 values, 
which estimate the amount of heterogeneity resulting 
from between-study variance, rather than by chance. 
The risk of bias for each study was examined using 
the Cochrane’s Collaboration risk of bias tool30 which 
assesses 6 aspects of trial methodology (sequence genera-
tion, allocation sequence concealment, blinding of par-
ticipants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, 
incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome report-
ing) that could potentially introduce different sources of 
bias. To account for publication bias, the Eggers’ test was 
applied and the Fail-Safe Number31 was calculated to 
determine the number of unpublished null studies which 
would be required to invalidate our findings (P > .05). 
We also performed sensitivity analyses to assess if com-
parable effects were still observed following the removal 
of low-quality or nonrandomized controlled trials.
The relationship between continuous moderators and 
effect size estimates were explored with meta-regression 
analyses. These were performed for putative patient and 
treatment characteristics which may impact upon the 
cognitive outcomes of exercise in schizophrenia. Patient 
moderators included age, gender, and duration of illness. 
Treatment moderators were intervention length, weekly 
amounts of exercise, and improvements in cardiorespira-
tory fitness. The impact of categorical moderators of exer-
cise supervision and intervention content were assessed 
using subgroup analyses.
Results
Search Results
The initial database search was performed on April 9, 
2016. The search returned 2115 results reduced to 1668 
after duplicates were removed. A further 1625 articles 
were excluded after reviewing the titles and abstracts for 
eligibility. Full text versions were retrieved for 43 articles, 
of which 7 were eligible for inclusion. Reasons for exclu-
sion and full details of the search results are summa-
rized in figure 1. A further 2 articles were identified from 
a similar search of Google Scholar, and one “in-press” 
publication was retrieved from its corresponding author. 
A total of 10 articles, each with unique samples, were 
eligible for inclusion. Additional data for 3 studies was 
obtained from the corresponding authors.32–34
Included Studies and Participant Details
Study characteristics and intervention details are dis-
played in table 1. Two studies were conducted in the 
United States, 2 in Germany, 2 in China, and 1 each in 
Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, and India. There was a 
total of 592 psychiatric patients across the studies: 221 
were assigned to exercise, 234 to control conditions, 
and 137 to ineligible study arms including tai-chi35 and 
yoga.36,37 In the eligible samples, 92.1% had schizophre-
nia/schizoaffective disorder and 7.9% had other nonaf-
fective psychotic disorders. The mean age was 37.3 years 
(range = 22.7–55 y), mean duration of illness was 
13.4 years (9.2 mo to 30.7 y) and 56% were male.
Intervention details are shown in table 1. Exercise pro-
grams were, on average, 12.2 weeks long (range = 4–24 wk) 
with 2.9 sessions per week (range = 2–4 sessions) of 
20–60 minutes in duration. All primarily focused on 
aerobic exercise, although 3 also incorporated resistance-
based (muscle strengthening) training.15,35,38 The common

modalities were aerobic machines such as cycle ergom-
eters/treadmills (N = 5), bodyweight exercises (N = 3), 
interactive video games (N = 2), and free-weights (N = 2). 
Three interventions combined exercise with cognitive 
remediation (CR) but were still included in the analy-
ses, since their comparison conditions controlled for this 
using CR alone,33 CR with table football,34 or CR with 
relaxation training.38 Other control conditions were table 
football alone (N = 1), occupational therapy (N = 1), 
and treatment-as-usual (N = 5). Risk of bias assessments 
identified 3 nonrandomized studies with high risk of bias 
influencing results.33,34,39 The 7 studies which were ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) rated “low risk of bias” 
for most items, although 1 had used nonblinded outcome 
assessments and 2 were at risk of bias from incomplete 
outcome data with no intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. 
Bias assessment results for individual studies are dis-
played in supplementary material 2.
Meta-Analysis of the Neurocognitive Outcomes of 
Exercise
Outcome data were available for 186 participants in the 
exercise group and 199 in control groups. The effect 
of exercise on global cognition is displayed in figure 2 
(N = 10, n = 383). This shows exercise interventions 
significantly improved overall cognitive performance 
(g = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.13–0.53, P = .001). There was 
no evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled 
effect size (Q = 7.0, P = .64, I2 = 0%). Egger’s regression 
test showed no evidence of publication bias (t = 0.786, 
P = .454). The fail-safe N was 20, indicating that 20 addi-
tional “null” studies would be needed for the observed P 
value to exceed .05.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the RCTs only 
while also excluding studies with high risk of bias (see 
table 2). Among the RCTs (N = 7, n = 297), the effect size 
was g = 0.41 (95% CI = 0.19–0.64, P < .001) with low het-
erogeneity between studies (Q = 2.32, P = .88, I2 = 0%).
Factors Associated With Intervention Effectiveness
All exercise interventions were delivered in a supervised 
setting. Therefore, subgroup analyses were performed to 
examine interventions that were supervised by a physi-
cal activity professional versus those which were not 
(table 2). Exercise interventions supervised by physical 
activity professionals (including physical trainers and 
yoga teachers) significantly improved global cognition 
(N = 6, n = 197, g = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.19–0.75, P < .001, 
Q = 2.44, I2 = 0%) whereas those supervised by other 
professionals (ie, mental health support and research 
staff) did not (N = 4, n = 186, g = 0.2, 95% CI = −0.09 
to 0.48, P = .5, Q = 1.81, I2 = 0%), although the differ-
ence between subgroups was not significant (P = .19). 
Exercise as a stand-alone intervention was compared to 
treatment as usual or time- and attention-matched con-
trol conditions in 7 trials and was found to significantly 
improve global cognition (N = 7, n = 307, g = 0.38, 95% 
CI = 0.15–0.60, P < .001, Q = 3.56, I2 = 0%). Three trials 
(total n = 76) examined the additional benefits of exercise 
as an add-on to CRT, in comparison to CRT as a control

condition. Random-effects meta-analysis found no sig-
nificant differences between exercise plus CRT vs CRT 
control conditions (g = 0.21, 95% CI = −0.33 to 0.75, 
P = .45, Q = 2.73, I2 = 26.8).
Meta-regression analyses suggested that a greater 
amount of exercise (in minutes per week) was associ-
ated with a larger improvement in global cognition 
 
(supplementary material 3), which closely approached 
statistical significance (N = 9, n = 344, B = 0.0054, 
SE = 0.0029, Z = 1.85, P = .065). “Improvements in fit-
ness” had a nonsignificant tendency to correlate with inter-
vention effect size (N = 7, n = 222, B = 0.61, SE = 0.352, 
Z = 1.74, P = .082). None of the other intervention fac-
tors (length in weeks, sessions per week) or sample charac-
teristics (age, duration of illness, % male) were associated 
with effects on cognitive performance (all P ≥ .1).
Effects of Exercise on Individual Cognitive Domains
We also examined the effects of exercise in the 7 indi-
vidual cognitive domains established by the MATRICS 
Neurocognition 
Committee26,27 
(supplementary 
material 
1). 
 
Effects across all domains are displayed in table 2. The 
most widely assessed was “working memory” (N = 7, 
n = 282), within which exercise resulted in significant 
improvements vs control conditions (g = 0.39, 95% 
CI = 0.05–0.73, P = .024) with medium heterogeneity 
(Q = 10.92, P = .091, I2 = 45.1%). “Processing speed” and 
“verbal learning and memory” were each assessed by 6 
studies (n = 195, n = 166) but showed no significant differ-
ence from control conditions (processing speed: g = 0.13, 
95% CI = −0.15 to 0.40, P = .38, I2 = 0%; verbal learning: 
g = 0.28, 95% CI = −0.09 to 0.64, P = .14, I2 = 35.6%). 
“Reasoning and problem solving,” assessed in 4 studies 
also showed no benefits from exercise (g = −0.10, 95% 
CI = −0.42 to 0.22, P = .53, n = 146, I2 = 0%). The remain-
ing 3 domains were assessed by 3 studies each. Significant 
effects of exercise were observed in tasks of “social 
cognition” (g = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.27–1.15, P = .002, 
n = 81, I2 = 0%) and “attention/vigilance” (g = 0.66, 95% 
CI = 0.20–1.12, P = .005, n = 104, I2 = 20.3%), although 
there were no significant differences from control condi-
tions for “visual learning and memory” (g = 0.004, 95% 
CI = −0.45 to 0.52, P = .889, n = 61, I2 = 0%).
Discussion
This meta-analysis set out to examine the effects of exer-
cise on cognitive functioning in people with schizophre-
nia. Ten studies with 385 participants were eligible; most 
of which used aerobic exercise interventions. Pooled 
effect sizes across all cognitive outcomes showed that 
exercise improves global cognition significantly more 
than control conditions (figure 2). This was a robust 
finding, with little statistical heterogeneity between stud-
ies and an effect size of g = 0.33 across all studies (95%

CI = 0.13–0.53, P = .001). Subgroup analyses suggest 
that supervision from physical activity instructors results 
in better cognitive outcomes. Meta-regression analyses 
indicate that higher weekly duration of exercise tends 
to be associated with greater improvement in cognition 
(P = .065). Domain-specific analyses found that exercise 
is particularly beneficial for social cognition (g = 0.71), 
working memory (g = 0.39), and attention (g = 0.66). 
This also suggests aerobic exercise may be more effective 
for cognition in schizophrenia than yoga, which previous 
meta-analyses have found to only be effective for long-
term memory (with a smaller effect size of g = 0.32).8
In this meta-analysis, the effect size in RCTs was 0.43 
(95% CI = 0.21–0.66), indicating that exercise has similar 
effects on cognition in schizophrenia to CRT, which has 
an average effect size of g = 0.45 (95% CI = 0.31–0.59) in 
randomized trials.5 Studies in healthy populations have 
shown that interventions which combine aerobic exer-
cise with cognitively demanding tasks confer maximal 
benefits for cognition.40 Animal research suggests this is 
due to aerobic exercise and learning tasks having inde-
pendent but complementary effects on neurogenesis; with 
the combination of these 2 activities leading to 30% more 
new neurons than either alone.41 Specifically, this may 
be attributed to exercise stimulating cell proliferation, 
and learning tasks supporting the survival of new cells.42 
Three studies identified in this review assessed the effects 
of exercise plus CRT in comparison to CRT alone.33,34,38

Exercise Improves Cognition in Schizophrenia
However, there was substantial heterogeneity between 
the exercise training programs used, and pooled effect 
size found no significant benefits of “CRT plus exercise” 
compared to CRT control conditions (g = 0.21, P = .45) 
for global cognitive performance. Nonetheless, individual 
studies have shown significantly greater improvements 
from combining CRT with aerobic exercise for various 
cognitive subdomains (including social cognition, work-
ing memory), along with significantly greater reductions 
in negative symptoms of schizophrenia.33,34
The cellular processes through which exercise increases 
neurogenesis and cognitive performance is not fully 
understood, although evidence from human and ani-
mal studies indicates that it is related to an increase in 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).43 BDNF is 
the most abundant growth factor in the human brain and 
is upregulated in response to aerobic exercise.44,45 There 
is also some preliminary evidence supporting the role of 
BDNF as a mediating factor for cognitive improvements 
from exercise in schizophrenia.32,33 However, the ben-
efits of exercise in schizophrenia cannot be attributed to 
BDNF alone, given the lack of available data examining 
other potential mechanisms.
For instance, it is possible that positive effects on 
cognition occur indirectly, since exercise has previously 
been shown to improve psychiatric symptoms, quality 
of life, and social functioning in people with schizophre-
nia6–8—all of which are associated with neurocogni-
tion.46 Physiological changes that occur in response to 
exercise, such as weight-loss and improved cardiorespi-
ratory fitness, are also linked with increased cognitive 
performance.47,48 Indeed, our meta-regression analyses 
revealed a nonsignificant tendency for an association 
between improvements in cognition and cardiorespira-
tory fitness, although this was underpowered to detect a 
significant effect (P = .08). Nonetheless, 3 of the studies 
included in this review did report significant correlations 
within their respective samples between increased fitness 
and improvements in brain structure and function.14,15,32 
Further exploration of the potential mechanisms through 
which exercise can improve cognition in schizophrenia is 
an important step for understanding these effects, and for 
informing the design and delivery of future interventions.
Only the interventions which were supervised by 
physical activity professionals significantly improved 
global cognition (g = 0.47, P < .001). This may be due 
to increased exercise engagement among participants or 
better program delivery resulting in more favorable out-
comes. Exercise dosage appears to be an important factor 
for achieving cognitive enhancement, as previous studies 
have shown that the amount or dose of exercise achieved by 
participants during an intervention is a significant predic-
tor of cognitive improvements.49,50 In our meta-regression 
analyses, minutes per week of exercise closely approached 
significance as a moderator variable (P = .065). Although 
other dose-related variables (ie, duration [wk] of the 
exercise intervention and number of sessions per week) 
did not have any relationship with intervention effective-
ness, this may be due to the lack of variation across the 
included studies preventing our meta-regression analyses 
from detecting a relationship, as most interventions were 
between 8 and 12 weeks long, with 2 or 3 sessions per 
week (table 1). Furthermore, we were unable to analyze 
how exercise intensity may influence outcomes due to 
how this variable was reported across trials. Kimhy et al50 
previously examined the relative influence of exercise 
duration, frequency, and intensity on cognitive improve-
ments following a 12-week exercise program in schizo-
phrenia and found that intensity was the best predictor 
variable. Thus, along with determining required doses in 
“minutes per week,” future research should also aim to 
establish the length, frequency, and intensity of exercise 
training required to improve cognition.
Among the different domains assessed (table 2), social 
cognition showed the greatest improvements in response 
to exercise (g = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.27–1.15, P = .002). Social 
cognitive impairments persevere from the onset of illness 
across the course of schizophrenia.51 They are negatively 
associated with employment and independent living,52,53 
and social cognition is more strongly predictive of real-
world functioning than neurocognitive performance.54 
Thus, the large effects in this domain are encouraging, 
suggesting that the cognitive benefits of exercise may gen-
eralize to improve psychosocial and occupational out-
comes for people with schizophrenia.
The 2 other domains which showed significant changes 
in response to exercise were attention (g = 0.66) and work-
ing memory (g = 0.39). Since these factors are strong 
predictors of functional recovery after a first episode of 
schizophrenia,55 implementing exercise interventions from 
the early stages of illness may facilitate functional recov-
ery. Indeed, exercise may confer even greater benefits in the 
early psychosis, as cognitive enhancement interventions are 
more effective at this time than later in illness.56 Consistent 
with this, 3 recent studies in young patients with first-epi-
sode psychosis (aged 23–26) have observed large cognitive 
improvements from moderate/vigorous exercise after just 
10–12 weeks.33,36,46 With the currently limited evidence, it is 
unclear whether this high level of responsiveness to exer-
cise among first-episode patients is due to their younger age 
or their earlier stage of illness. It is also possible that exer-
cise interventions could be particularly beneficial for older 
patients with schizophrenia, whom typically have greater 
health-related comorbidities (such as hypertension, obesity, 
and diabetes)—since these conditions adversely affect cog-
nitive functioning,57,58 and yet improve in response to exer-
cise training. Additionally, future studies should examine 
how the effects of exercise are influenced by other biological 
variables, such age, body mass index, and genetic variation 
in BDNF secretion (ie, BDNF val66met polymorphism), 
as these have previously been shown to modulate effects of 
exercise on neurocognition.58–60

One limitation of this meta-analysis is that several of 
the included studies did not use ITT analyses and failed 
to report outcome data for 15.8% and 10.7% of partici-
pants enrolled in the exercise and control conditions, 
respectively. In CRT studies, while earlier meta-analyses 
of smaller trials found moderate effects on cognitive 
functioning, 2 recent multisite RCTs with ITT analyses 
have found no benefits of CRT beyond control condi-
tions.61,62 Therefore, large-scale RCTs of exercise with 
complete outcome data (or ITT analyses) should now be 
conducted to establish the efficacy for improving cogni-
tion in schizophrenia. If proven effective, exercise could 
present a widely beneficial and cost-effective intervention 
for policy makers to consider for dissemination, since it 
has also been found to improve cardiovascular health and 
symptoms in schizophrenia.6,63
Some cognitive subdomains were only measured in a 
small number of studies (N = 3), which limits the strength 
of findings for these domains. It should also be noted that 
the differences in the effects of exercise across specific cog-
nitive domains could be attributable to discrepancies in 
cognitive measures used. This is because cognitive tasks 
vary in their sensitivity to detect improvement, depend-
ing on various psychometric properties such as task dif-
ficulty, reliability, and standard variance in performance.
A further consideration is that all interventions pri-
marily used aerobic exercise. Single-arm studies (ineli-
gible for this meta-analysis) using resistance training 
methods in people with early psychosis46 and long-term 
schizophrenia64 have demonstrated significant benefits for 
verbal memory and processing speed—domains which 
did not show improvement from aerobic exercise in this 
meta-analysis. Furthermore, a recent RCT of 20-week 
resistance training for schizophrenia found significant 
increases in BDNF.65 Despite the positive effects of resis-
tance training for cognition observed in other popula-
tions,66,67 no RCTs have measured this in schizophrenia 
to date.
In conclusion, the available evidence indicates that 
exercise improves cognitive functioning in people with 
schizophrenia, particularly within domains of social 
cognition, working memory, and attention, all of which 
are predictive of socio-occupational outcomes. Our data 
suggest that supervision from physical activity profes-
sionals and higher levels of weekly exercise are impor-
tant for promoting the cognitive benefits of exercise. 
Future research should aim to explore the mechanisms 
of exercise-induced cognitive improvements, determine 
if this is related to increased cardiorespiratory fitness, 
establish required dosages of exercise, and investigate 
the effectiveness of resistance training. Furthering cur-
rent understanding in these areas will help to develop 
optimal programs, which may involve combining exercise 
training with CRT. Given the known benefits of exer-
cise for psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and 
physical health,6–8 feasible and accessible methods for 
delivering exercise in clinical practice should be explored 
and implemented.21
