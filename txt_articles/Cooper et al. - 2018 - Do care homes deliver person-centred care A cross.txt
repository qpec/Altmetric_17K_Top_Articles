Abstract
Background
There are widespread concerns about abuse of care home residents. We report, in the larg-
est care home survey, prevalence of staff anonymously-reported, perpetrated/witnessed
abusive behaviours towards care home residents over 3 months. We also report positive
care behaviours.
Methods
1544 staff in 92 English care home units completed the revised Modified Conflict Tactics
Scale and Maslach Burnout Inventory.
Outcomes
Most staff reported positive care behaviours, but specific person-centred activities were
sometimes infrequent. Many care home staff were never or almost never aware of a resident
being taken out of the home for their enjoyment (34%, n = 520); or an activity planned
around a resident’s interests (15%, n = 234). 763 (51%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 47%
to 54%) of care home staff reported carrying out or observing potentially abusive or neglect-
ful behaviours at least sometimes in the preceding 3 months; some abuse was reported as
happening “at least sometimes” in 91/92 care homes. Neglect was most frequently reported:
making a resident wait for care (n = 399, 26%), avoiding a resident with challenging behav-
iour (n = 391, 25%), giving residents insufficient time for food (n = 297, 19%), and taking
insufficient care when moving residents (n = 169, 11%). 1.1% of staff reported physical and

staff burnout-depersonalisation scores (adjusted odds ratio 1.191, CI 1.052–1.349).
Interpretation
Staff anonymous reports of abusive behaviour and neglect could be used to monitor care
quality, as cases currently reported are probably tip of the iceberg, and be an outcome in
intervention studies.
Introduction
By 2021, an estimated million United Kingdom (UK) people will have dementia, despite a
recent fall in incidence [1]. One third of UK people with dementia live in care homes and at
least two thirds of care home residents have dementia [2]. A number of inquiries regarding
abuse and neglect of residents have influenced public perceptions of care homes [3]. The UK
Department of Health defines abuse as “a violation of an individual’s human and civil rights
by another person(s)" (2). Abuse is defined by the impact, rather than intention of actions or
inactions on an individual. A carer may unintentionally be neglectful if they are unaware of a
care recipient’s needs.
Conceptual models developed to try to explain elder abuse consider victim vulnerability,
abuser stress, psychopathology or impairment, intra-individual dynamics and societal atti-
tudes [4]. Most care home residents have dementia, rely on others for personal care and many
exhibit challenging behaviours, factors associated with higher risk of abuse [5, 6]. Carer stress
is associated with: low job satisfaction, long hours, low pay, physical demands, staff shortages
and minimal education and training [4, 7] and lower empathy which may be linked to lower
care quality [8]. In family carers, experiencing violence and aggression from people with
dementia was a significant predictor of acting abusively, possibly because staff react defensively
or find managing aggression stressful. This may also be true for paid carers and could explain
why people with dementia who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms are at increased risk of
abuse [9].
In previous surveys, a quarter of relatives of care home residents reported incident(s) of
physical abuse [10]; 16% of 114 long term care staff reported committing significant psycho-
logical abuse [11]; and over 80% of 577 nursing home staff observed abuse although far fewer
admitted to acting abusively [12]. As care workers reporting abuse face potential adverse legal,
employment and social consequences, recent surveys have elicited care worker experiences
anonymously. In an Israeli study of 510 care staff completing an anonymous questionnaire,
just over half admitted abuse and 70% had witnessed maltreatment in the past year; more
abuse was reported by staff who experienced more burnout and worked in larger facilities
with higher staff turnover [13]. In a small UK survey in 5 nursing homes, most respondents
(n = 138, 88.5%) reported witnessing or suspecting abuse in homes where they had previously
worked [14]. In both these surveys, staff were asked to identify incidence of “abuse” or “mal-
treatment”, so behaviours not identified correctly as abusive were undetected. There have been
no previous anonymous surveys of elder abuse to elicit behaviours such as ignoring residents’
needs or making them wait for care, without requiring staff to identify behaviours as abusive.
As many professionals do not correctly identify abusive behaviours, this is an important omis-
sion [15].

Funding: The MARQUE study is funded by
Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) as
part of a joint funding call connected with the 2012
UK government’s challenge on dementia (ES/

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
 The MARQUE (Managing Agitation and Raising Quality of Life) cohort study, primarily
devised to consider the relationship between agitation, carer coping and quality of life, enabled
us to examine care home abuse on a large scale. We included our recently developed measure
for anonymous reporting of abuse and neglect in care homes in baseline data collection and
used this to describe the prevalence of abuse and its relationship with care home and staff char-
acteristics. We based our hypothesis on the conceptual model of abuse outlined above, and in
particular the likelihood that abuse and neglect occurred most often where there was greater
resident vulnerability, abuser stress strained intra-individual dynamics. We hypothesised that
staff were more likely to report abusive behaviour in care homes:
1. where staff were more stressed, as indicated by higher mean staff burnout depersonalisation
scores;
2. with more residents and
3. fewer permanent staff, because staff-resident dynamics were more challenged;
4. where residents with dementia were potentially more at risk of abuse because they had
higher mean neuropsychiatric inventory scores; and
5. in care homes with lower environment quality scores.
Materials and methods
Setting and sampling
Harrow Research Ethics Committee (14/LO/0034) gave permission for the study. We recruited
care homes from across England, from July 2014 to October 2015, of each provider type (vol-
untary, state and private), care provision (nursing, residential) and urban/suburban and rural
locations. Sample size was determined by the MARQUE cohort study primary objective which
was to examine the longitudinal relationship between carer coping and patient quality of life
and its dependence on severity of agitation. The study aimed to recruit 2537 residents from 72
care home units (35 residents per care home) [16].
Procedures
We recruited care homes through third sector partners, NHS (National Health Service) trusts,
Department of Health publicity and the NIHR (National Institute for Health Research) Clini-
cal Research Network. We sought care home managers’ agreement for their care home’s inclu-
sion. In included homes, all consenting regular care team members (whether permanent or
regular bank staff), who provided hands-on care were asked to complete measures. We
excluded agency staff as we sought to recruit care workers who regularly worked in the homes.
We identified residents with a dementia diagnosis and for others completed the Noticeable
Problems Checklist [17] with staff to detect residents with undiagnosed probable dementia.
We asked the paid carer working most closely with each resident with dementia to complete
proxy measures (measures completed by the staff member reporting their understanding of
the wellbeing and illness experienced by the resident). All participants gave informed, written
consent before taking part.
Measures
Trained research assistants conducted assessments at the care homes. Data was collected in the
baseline MARQUE study interview [16].

 Care home measures.
We recorded characteristics of the included care homes (see
Table 1 for details recorded); where care homes comprised units each staffed by discrete staff-
ing groups, we recorded these as separate care home units. The physical environment of care
homes was assessed by the TESS (Therapeutic Environment Screening Survey for Nursing
Homes and Residential Care), an instrument with good inter-rater reliability and concurrent
validity [18]. The TESS score is the sum of 15 items, each scored 0–2 (facility maintenance,
cleanliness, handrails, call buttons, light intensity, light glare, light evenness, hallway length
(shorter is better), homelikeness, room autonomy, the presence of telephones, tactile stimula-
tion, visual stimulation, privacy, and outdoor areas). Higher scores indicate better environ-
mental quality [19].
Carer measures.
Staff completing measures for the MARQUE baseline survey were also
asked to complete the revised Modified Conflict Tactics Scale for professional carers (primary
outcome), a measure of helpful and potentially abusive behaviour perpetrated or witnessed by
staff which we have developed and piloted with care home staff and found to be acceptable and

 have content validity [20]. It is based on a previous measure used extensively among people
with dementia and family carers [6, 21, 22]. It comprises 10 potentially abusive items and six
positive care items (Tables 2 and 3. Care staff were asked whether each item had, in the last
three months happened “never”, “almost never”, “sometimes” “most of the time” or “all of the
time”. The carers self-completed this questionnaire anonymously, in private and sealed it in a
blank envelope. We recorded which care home the person worked in. We could not identify
individual participants, but notified the care home manager where staff reported that residents
had been hit or shaken. If residents or staff told us or we witnessed potentially abusive behav-
iour this was handled according to our protocol in line with UK safeguarding procedures.
The following measures were completed as part of the MARQUE baseline assessment; since
they could not be directly linked to anonymous abuse reports, they were analysed as mean val-
ues at the care home unit level:
The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI): a commonly used measure of burnout in care home
staff, with adequate psychometric properties [23]. Burnout describes physical, mental and
emotional exhaustion that may be accompanied by a change in attitude, from positive and car-
ing to negative and unconcerned. The MBI comprises three subscales—asking how often cer-
tain feelings or behaviours associated with emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and
personal accomplishment are currently happening, on a 7 item scale, from never to every day.
It does not specify a time period, as burnout is conceptualised as an enduring state [24]. We
hypothesised prior to analysis that the depersonalisation (unfeeling and impersonal response
towards care recipients) subscale would be associated with abusive behaviour.
The paid carer working most closely with each resident with dementia completed the fol-
lowing measures:

 • The Dementia Quality of Life (DEMQOL) proxy, a responsive, valid and reliable measure of
quality of life in people with dementia in the last week. It is a 31-item interviewer-adminis-
tered questionnaire [25].
• Staff gave information so the researcher could rate dementia severity using the Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR), a reliable and valid instrument for rating performance in Memory,
Orientation, Judgment and Problem solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and
Personal Care. This information was used to classify residents’ dementia severity into: very
mild, mild, moderate or severe [26].
• The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), a validated instrument was used to evaluate neuro-
psychiatric symptoms in the past 4 weeks. 12 domains, each rating a discrete symptom are
scored between 0 and 12 (calculated as the product of symptom’s frequency (0–4) and sever-
ity (0–3)) with higher scores meaning increasing severity. A summed scored can be calcu-
lated for total neuropsychiatric symptoms [27].

 behaviour was happening “never” or “almost never”. We reported these as prevalence amongst
care homes and carers. The overall prevalence of any abusive behaviour reported at least some-
times was also calculated with a 95% confidence interval. When estimating prevalence by carer
we used a sandwich estimate of the standard error to account for clustering [28].
Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to examine our hypotheses that staff in
care home units with (a) more residents (b) lower staff: resident ratios (c) higher mean MBI
depersonalisation subscale scores (d) lower TESS scores; and (e) higher mean NPI scores for
residents; were more likely to report that any abusive behaviour was happening at least some-
times. These factors were all included as fixed effects in the models while clustering by care
home unit was accounted for as a random effect. We fitted unadjusted models and models
adjusted for the number of staff working in care home units (a fixed effect), because in home
units with more staff, the likelihood of witnessing a staff member acting abusively would be
logically greater.
Results
Description of survey
Of the 97 care home units participating in the MARQUE study baseline interview, 92 partici-
pated in this survey. Five care homes were not invited to participate as we had not yet gained
ethical approval for this study component when they took part in MARQUE; one of these
homes provided nursing care, the others nursing and personal care; all were dementia-regis-
tered, one was a dementia-specialist home. The five excluded homes had more permanent staff
(median (Interquartile Range, IQR) 68 (49,80) versus 30 (20, 49)), and more residents (53 (51,
85) versus 34 (24,50)) than those that participated.
Of the 2120 care home staff approached, 1702 (80.3%) took part in the MARQUE study. Of
the 1702 care home staff participating in MARQUE 1544 (91%) took part in the abuse study.
Of the 158 participating in MARQUE but not the abuse study, 138 worked in the five homes
not invited to take part and 20 declined participation.
Table 1 describes characteristics of the included care homes. In these care homes, 1341
(86%) of MARQUE study respondents were female, 1080 (30%) spoke English as a second lan-
guage; 83 (5.4%) had no qualifications; 539 (35%) were educated to GCSE (General Certificate
of Secondary Education)/NVQ (National Vocational Qualification) Level 2; 500 (32%) to
A-Level/NVQ Level 3–5; 318 (21%) to degree or post-degree level. Among those participating,
193 (12%) had a nursing qualification. As only 20 staff MARQUE participants declined to par-
ticipate in this study, these characteristics approximate those of the anonymous participants in
this study.
Potentially abusive behaviours
Carrying out or observing one or more potentially abusive or neglectful behaviour at least
sometimes in the preceding 3 months was reported by 763 (51%; 95% Confidence Interval
(CI) 47% to 54%) of care home staff. Some abuse was reported as happening “at least some-
times” in 91/92 care homes. The proportion of staff reporting abuse was similar across care
home types (Table 2). Only 14 (1.1%) of care home staff reported that residents had been hit or
shaken, and 56 (4%) were aware of threats of physical violence to residents (Table 3). Staff
being verbally abusive to residents (shouting at, insulting or speaking harshly to them) at least
some of the time was reported by 74 (5%) of respondents. The most frequently reported behav-
iours were neglectful: making a resident wait for care (n = 399, 26%), avoiding a resident with
challenging behaviour (n = 391, 25%), not giving enough time for food (n = 297, 19%), and
not taking enough care when moving a resident (n = 169, 11%).

 Positive behaviours
The majority of care staff reported that most of the time staff spoke nicely to residents during
personal care (98%, n = 1490), enjoyed spending time keeping them company (57%, n = 886)
and spent time to get to know them (63%, n = 966). By contrast, 520 (34%) of care home staff
were never or almost never aware of resident being taken out of the home for their enjoyment;
196 (13%) had never or almost never experienced relatives being involved in care planning,
and 234 (15%) had never or almost never been aware of an activity planned around a resident’s
interests (Table 4).
Associations with potentially abusive behaviour
A greater odds of staff reporting that any potentially abusive behaviour happened at least
sometimes was associated with working in a home with higher staff burnout depersonalisation
scores (1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.35). Contrary to our hypothesis, numbers or ratios of staff to resi-
dents, environmental quality and neuropsychiatric symptom severity in residents with demen-
tia were not associated with abuse. There was a small association with staff reporting higher
resident quality of life (1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.06) (Table 5).
Discussion
This is the first large survey of abuse and neglect in English care homes, and the largest survey
to date of abuse and neglect in care homes in any country. Just over half of respondents
reported that potentially abusive or neglectful behaviour towards residents occurred at least
sometimes. Some abuse or neglect was reported in all but one of the 92 care home units.
Neglectful behaviours were most common, and very few care home workers reported actual or
threatened physical abuse. While only 5% of carers interviewed reported verbal abuse, at least
one carer endorsed this item in over half of the homes. As there may be under-reporting, due
to fear of reprisal or lack of awareness of abuse or neglect occurring, these are likely minimum
estimates of the prevalence of abuse and neglect. Our worrying findings accord with previous
studies [13]. Under section 42 of the Care Act (2014), safeguarding adults is a statutory duty
in England. In 2015–16, 39,485 cases of vulnerable adult care home residents (of all ages)
experiencing, or being at risk of abuse and neglect were investigated and concluded. Most

 reported cases related to neglect (34%), with physical abuse next most common (27%) [29]. As
nearly 15,000 care homes in England are registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC)
[30], our findings suggest that the neglect investigations currently initiated in care homes may
be the tip of the iceberg [31]. Physical abuse was rarely reported in our survey, but constitutes
a significant proportion of reported concerns, suggesting cases are more likely to be reported
to statutory services.
While the concept of person-centred care [32] is widely accepted by researchers and care
home managers, there appears to be a gap in its implementation in care homes. Staff are often
caring for residents who resist care, or are verbally or physically aggressive, with little training
or support. Where emotional distancing and objectifying behaviours are used as ways to cope
with this, there is clear dissonance with the concepts of person-centred care. Attributing
aggression to dementia rather than the person may, for example, help staff to be less distressed
by it, but perhaps normal inter-personal interactions become more difficult in circumstances
where some behaviours are viewed at two different levels; those of the person and those of the
dementia [33].
We explored putative associates of abusive behaviour at the care home level, based on our
selected conceptual model of abuse occurrence as related to staff stress and distress, resident
vulnerability and intra-individual dynamics [4]. Abuse or neglect, as hypothesised, was
reported more in homes where staff experienced more burnout and depersonalisation feelings
towards residents, mirroring findings with dementia family carers [34]. More abuse was
reported in units where staff rated the quality of life of residents with dementia higher. This
might be a chance association, or perhaps indicative that staff experiencing more burnout
were more likely to act abusively or neglectfully and empathise or notice less when residents
were distressed. Staff may conflate life quality of residents with care quality. Perhaps those
experiencing more burnout worked to a less person-centred, more task focussed model, rating
residents’ quality of life more highly when care tasks were completed to schedule.
Our hypotheses that abuse happened more in care home units where residents with demen-
tia had more neuropsychiatric symptoms that increased their vulnerability, or with fewer per-
manent staff per resident and more residents because staff had less time to deliver person-
centred care, were unsupported. Perhaps this was because most homes operated at minimum

 legal staffing levels, with additional staff employed only when highly agitated residents
required 1:1 care. Staff numbers tend to be higher in care homes where more residents have
clinically significant agitation [16]. Having more staff per resident in a unit probably indicates
that residents need more care, not that staff work under less pressure, with more time to pro-
vide person-centred care. Our hypothesis that environmental quality was associated with less
abuse was also unsupported. While important for many residents and for staff, a more pleasant
environment was insufficient to reduce likelihood of abuse.
Positive care behaviours greatly outnumbered abusive or neglectful behaviours. Carers
reported that most of the time, staff spoke nicely to residents, and spent quality time, trying to
know them better. However, activities that took more planning and time—involving families
in care planning, and planning activities around a resident’s interests—were less frequent. A
third of care workers reported that residents were rarely taken out of the home for their enjoy-
ment. Perhaps staff lacked the time to plan activities, or this was not perceived as within their
role or power. Taking residents out may have been avoided due to the possibility of falling, or
precluded by staffing levels at minimum levels. Absence of pleasant events and activities may
in itself be neglect—albeit unintentional neglect. Reducing abuse and neglect in care homes,
requires, in our view, a systemic approach, where they are not perceived as the commission or
omission of a direct carer, but as occurring in a system. In its widest view, this involves a soci-
ety that has delegated care of the most vulnerable to carers undertaking challenging, stressful
work for low pay with minimum training and support.
Our study demonstrates that anonymous reporting of abuse by care home workers is
acceptable and feasible, and it could be a new, useful indicator of care quality for home manag-
ers, regulatory bodies and researchers. The only existing evidence-based interventions to
reduce elder abuse target use of physical restraint, and were developed in countries where
restraint is acceptable in some circumstances [35]. There are no interventions known to effec-
tively reduce less tangible abusive behaviours, partially due to difficulties measuring outcomes
that paid carers are unwilling and residents with dementia unable or unwilling to report.
Our study suggests that that future abuse interventions should focus on reducing staff burn-
out and depersonalisation; introducing true person-centred care by encouraging staff to
explore residents’ personal histories, current and past interests and build pleasant interactions
into care, reducing objectification of residents would from our findings, be rational strategies.
We are currently evaluating such an approach. We found no association between care home
size, staffing numbers and abuse likelihood, perhaps because the care homes included were
similarly staffed, or because level of staff training and support, which we did not measure, mat-
ters, rather than numbers of staff alone.
Our measure of abuse and neglect was developed with care home workers; it is valid, and
the use of anonymous reporting reduced potential for desirability bias. We did not require
staff to identify behaviours as maltreatment, so we could capture potentially abusive behaviour
that observers or perpetrators may not have identified as abusive. We cannot estimate the pro-
portion of staff acting abusively from our findings, because we did not ask staff to differentiate
witnessed from committed abuse [36]. Our work with care staff developing the measure sug-
gested this would have reduced its acceptability. The measure is intended as an indicator of
abuse prevalence within a home rather than a way of directly identifying abusing staff. Previ-
ous surveys that have distinguished between observed and perpetrated abuse found that
observed abuse was reported far more frequently, either because staff were unwilling to admit
acting abusively or because abuse was perpetrated by few but seen by many [37]. In a more
recent study, many staff were willing to report perpetrating abuse, so we will consider intro-
ducing this distinction in future studies [13].

 Our questionnaire did not capture behaviour intent or context. We did not recruit a ran-
dom probability sample of care homes, and those homes participating may have been more
highly functioning, with more open cultures and proactive managers and thus with lower
abuse rates than those declining participation. This may have biased our findings and poten-
tially underestimated overall levels of abuse. We included regular bank workers but excluded
agency staff who did work in the homes on a regular basis. We told staff that we would advise
care home managers if concerning abuse were reported, although individual reporters were
anonymous. This may have deterred some reporting due to fear of investigations, dismissal or
blame. While abuse is always of concern, we told the home when reported abuse crossed a ‘red
line’. We informed managers there was “concerning abuse” if any physical abuse was reported
at all, or if any of the abusive items were reported as happening “most” or “all of the time”. Our
results indicate that the proportion of carers reporting this level of abuse was low. We analysed
associations between mean scores and abusive behaviour reports at care home unit level, as
abuse was reported anonymously; power for these analyses was therefore limited by the care
home unit sample size.
Conclusions
Clinicians treating care home residents should be aware that neglect is common in care homes
and that person-centred activities such as trips out or activities tailored to residents’ interests
are often happening very infrequently; as these are possible targets for psychological interven-
tions to improve wellbeing. Measuring harm to vulnerable people anonymously brings ethical
dilemmas, as abuse detected cannot be directly addressed. Not measuring it, so it remains
invisible, is a greater harm.
