abstract
OBJECTIVE: Despite increases in education and awareness, many athletes continue to play with 
signs and symptoms of a sport-related concussion (SRC). The impact that continuing to play 
has on recovery is unknown. This study compared recovery time and related outcomes 
between athletes who were immediately removed from play and athletes who continued to 
play with an SRC.
METHODS: A prospective, repeated measures design was used to compare neurocognitive 
performance, symptoms, and recovery time between 35 athletes (mean ± SD age, 15.61 
± 1.65 years) immediately removed after an SRC (REMOVED group) compared with 34 
athletes (mean ± SD age, 15.35 ± 1.73 years) who continued to play (PLAYED group) with 
SRC. Neurocognitive and symptom data were obtained at baseline and at 1 to 7 days and 8 
to 30 days after an SRC.
RESULTS: The PLAYED group took longer to recover than the REMOVED group (44.4 ± 36.0 
vs 22.0 ± 18.7 days; P = .003) and were 8.80 times more likely to demonstrate protracted 
recovery (≥21 days) (P < .001). Removal from play status was associated with the greatest 
risk of protracted recovery (adjusted odds ratio, 14.27; P = .001) compared with other 
predictors (eg, sex). The PLAYED group exhibited significantly worse neurocognitive and 
greater symptoms than the REMOVED group.
CONCLUSIONS: SRC recovery time may be reduced if athletes are removed from participation. 
Immediate removal from play is the first step in mitigating prolonged SRC recovery, and 
these data support current consensus statements and management guidelines.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Immediate 
removal from play is recommended for athletes 
with suspected concussion. The majority of 
concussions go unreported, and the catastrophic 
consequences of continuing to play with concussion 
are documented. The impact of removal from play on 
recovery outcomes is unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Athletes who were not 
removed from play took longer to recover and 
demonstrated worse neurocognitive and symptom 
outcomes after a sport-related concussion. Removal 
from play status is a new predictor for protracted 
recovery and supports consensus guidelines.

Approximately 1.6 to 3.8 million 
sport/recreation-related concussions 
(SRCs) occur annually in the United 
States. 
1 In 2007, there were 250 000 
emergency departments visits for 
SRC, more than double the rate 
in 1997. 
2 Concussions result in 
symptoms (eg, headache, dizziness, 
nausea), impairment (eg, cognitive, 
vestibular, visual), academic and/or 
psychosocial problems, and recovery 
times ranging from days to months. 
3 
Adolescents are at greatest risk for 
SRC and experience longer recovery 
than adult athletes due to maturation 
or other unknown etiology. 
4 Clinical 
guidelines recommend immediate 
removal from play if an athlete 
has a suspected SRC.3, 
 
5, 
 
6 These 
guidelines are based on delayed 
onset of symptoms, 
 
7, 
 
8 neurocognitive 
impairment, 
9 and research indicating 
compromised neurometabolic 
function during the first 10 days’ 
postinjury that increases the risk 
of a subsequent SRC. 
10 
 
 
–14 These 
guidelines are also intended to 
reduce the risk of second impact 
syndrome, a rare but catastrophic 
condition that involves the loss of 
cerebrovascular autoregulation 
and brain herniation, and is often 
fatal among adolescent athletes 
who sustain brain injuries in short 
succession. 
15, 
 
16
The Centers for Disease Control’s 
Heads Up concussion education 
program states, “It is better to miss 
one game than the whole season.” 
17 
However, due to many factors, 
including the culture of sports (ie, play 
through injury), 
 
18, 
 
19 poor awareness 
of SRC signs/symptoms, 
 
20, 
21 
and limited access to medical 
professionals, an estimated 50% to 
70% of concussions go unreported/
undetected. 
20, 
 
22, 
 
23 In fact, in 2013, 
the Institute of Medicine and 
National Research Council stated 
that the culture of sports negatively 
influences SRC reporting and that 
athletes, coaches, and parents do not 
fully acknowledge the risks of playing 
while injured. 
21
Researchers suggest that exposure 
to physical activity immediately after 
concussion decreases neuroplasticity 
and cognitive performance and 
increases neuroinflammation. 
24, 
 
25 
The physical exertion required for 
an athlete to remain in play after SRC 
may increase energy demand at a 
time when the brain is metabolically 
compromised 
10, 
 
26 and lead to similar 
outcomes reported in animal models. 
Axonal injury, astrocytic reactivity, 
and memory impairment are also 
exacerbated following a second 
injury 24 hours after an initial 
injury.10, 
 
27 The potential effects of 
continuing to play with an SRC have 
yet to be examined in adolescent 
and young adult athletes at risk for 
these adverse outcomes. The present 
study compared recovery time and 
related outcomes between athletes 
with an SRC who were immediately 
removed from play and athletes who 
continued to play with an SRC.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
A prospective, repeated measures 
design was used for this study. 
Ninety-five athletes (aged 12–19 
years) seeking care for an SRC at a 
concussion specialty clinic between 
September 1, 2014, and December 
1, 2014, were recruited for the 
study. Inclusion criteria included: 
(1) enrollment in a patient research 
registry; (2) SRC diagnosis within 7 
days of first clinical visit; (3) ability 
to recall the moment during a game 
or practice that they sustained a 
head impact resulting in on-field 
SRC symptoms (eg, dizziness) and/
or changes in mental status (eg, 
posttraumatic amnesia); (4) no 
record of brain injury within the 
previous 3 months; (5) no diagnosed 
learning disability or hyperactivity 
disorder; (6) completion of a second 
clinical visit 8 to 30 days’ postinjury; 
and (7) a retrievable, valid preinjury 
(ie, baseline) assessment of 
neurocognitive performance and 
symptoms from the referring medical 
professional in the clinic’s health care 
network.
Outcome Measures
Defi
 nition of Sport-related Concussion
Concussions were diagnosed at 
the time of injury by a certified 
athletic trainer or sports medicine 
team physician on the basis of 
the following criteria: (1) clear 
mechanism of injury; and (2) the 
presence of ≥1 on-field sign of 
concussion (eg, loss of consciousness, 
amnesia, disorientation/confusion, 
balance difficulties), and/or ≥1 
symptom (eg, headache, dizziness, 
nausea) after injury and any 
impairment according to sideline 
assessments (eg, Sport Concussion 
Assessment Tool).
Determination of Removal From Play 
Group Status
Demographic characteristics, 
medical history, and injury-related 
information were obtained via 
clinical interview from athletes, 
parents, and/or informants (eg, 
referring medical professional). 
A clinical intake form was used 
to determine study eligibility and 
assignment to removal from play 
groups ( 
Table 1).
Neurocognitive and Symptom 
Impairment
The Immediate Post-Concussion 
Assessment and Cognitive Testing 
(ImPACT) was used to measure 
neurocognitive impairment. ImPACT 
is a computer-based neurocognitive 
battery that yields composite scores 
for verbal and visual memory, 
processing speed, and reaction 
time. ImPACT also includes the 
Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, 
which is a self-reported symptom 
inventory including 22 items that 
yields a total symptom severity score. 
Psychometric data on ImPACT and 
the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale 
have been published previously.

Recovery From SRC
Recovery time was defined as 
the total number of days from 
the date of injury to the date of 
receiving medical clearance from 
the clinician for full return to sports 
participation. Per international 
consensus, 
 
3 athletes were required 
to be symptom-free at rest and after 
physical exertion before receiving 
medical clearance. Athletes were 
also required to demonstrate 
neurocognitive performance within 
normal limits (ie, 80% confidence 
intervals using reliable change 
indices) of their own baseline scores 
after exertion. When symptom-free at 
rest, athletes were asked to schedule 
a clearance appointment, which 
included neurocognitive testing 
and a standardized exertion test. 
Certified athletic trainers or physical 
therapists at the clinic administered 
exertion tests. Clinic policy allows for 
all athletes seeking clearance to be 
seen within 72 hours of appointment 
request, assuring that lack of 
appointment availability does not 
limit opportunity for return-to-play 
evaluation.
Procedure
All athletes were enrolled in a 
university institutional review 
board–approved concussion 
research registry. During each of 2 
consecutive clinical visits, athletes 
completed ImPACT and the Post-
Concussion Symptom Scale, followed 
by an in-person clinical interview 
conducted by a neuropsychologist 
trained in concussion. Neurocognitive 
and symptom data were gathered 
from athletes at 1 to 7 days and 8 
to 30 days after injury. Follow-up 
visits are scheduled every 7 to 
10 days, and clinic closures (eg, 
weekends and holidays) and patient 
availability can alter this schedule. To 
accommodate these factors, patients 
who completed visits within 2 to 
3 weeks were enrolled. Baseline 
neurocognitive and symptom data 
from the referring institution were 
retrieved from medical records for 
each patient when available. All 
clinicians providing clinical care were 
blinded to patient group. On-field 
signs and symptoms of SRC were 
taken retrospectively via the clinical 
interview during the first clinical 
visit. Parents accompanied athletes 
to the clinic for all clinical visits 
and corroborated information in 
the event that the athlete could not 
recall his or her on-field signs and/or 
symptoms.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics (means, 
SDs, and frequencies) were used 
to describe the total sample and 
compare the REMOVED and PLAYED 
groups in terms of demographic 
characteristics and injury-related 
factors ( 
Table 1). To ensure group 
equivalence for the elapsed time 
between the 2 postinjury clinical 
visits, a difference score was 
calculated between the second and 
first visits. A subsequent independent 
sample t test was conducted on 
the difference score to ensure 
group equivalence, and statistical 
significance was set at P ≤ .05.
A series of 2 (group: REMOVED, 
PLAYED) × 3 (time: baseline, 1–7, 
8–30 days), mixed-factorial analyses 
of variance were conducted to 
examine neurocognitive (verbal 
memory, visual memory, processing 
speed, and reaction time) and 
symptom (total symptom score) 
scores. After Bonferroni correction 
for these 5 analyses, statistical 
significance was set at P ≤ .01.
An independent sample t test was 
used to compare recovery time 
(number of days) between the 
REMOVED and PLAYED groups. 
To examine protracted recovery, 
the number of days to recovery 
was dichotomously categorized as 
protracted (≥21 days) or normal 
(<21 days). 
35 The χ2 analyses with 
odds ratios (ORs) were performed 
to compare the risk of protracted 
recovery for the REMOVED and 
PLAYED groups. A logistic regression 
was conducted to identify the relative 
contribution of removal from play 
status among SRC modifying factors 
outlined in the literature (including 
age, 
36 sex, 
37 and posttraumatic 
migraine 
35) that predict protracted 
recovery. Effect sizes for interval/
ratio data were denoted by Cohen’s 
d and Cramer’s V for nominal data. 
These analyses were conducted by 
using SPSS version 21.0 (IBM SPSS 
Statistics, IBM Corporation, Armonk, 
NY), 
38 and statistical significance was 
set at P ≤ .05.

have retrievable neurocognitive 
baseline and symptom data and 
were excluded. Three athletes with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder and 1 athlete with learning 
disability were excluded. Two 
athletes had a clinical visit interval 
time that was an outlier (>2.5 SD) 
and were excluded (eg, clinical visit 
1 occurred at 6 days and the second 
clinical visit occurred at 8 days). The 
final sample consisted of 69 athletes, 
comprising 35 in the REMOVED 
group and 34 in the PLAYED group. 
One athlete in the REMOVED group 
had 4 previous concussions, and 2 
athletes in the PLAYED group had 
1 previous concussion. Due to the 
low reported number of concussions 
in this sample, concussion history 
was not entered into the logistic 
regression analysis.
There were no differences between 
the REMOVED and PLAYED groups 
on concussion history (P = .65). 
There were no differences between 
the PLAYED (10.1 ± 3.2 days) and 
REMOVED (8.9 ± 3.1 days) groups on 
the time elapsed from first clinical 
visit to the second clinical visit 
(t[67] = 1.50; P = .14), and the mean 
number of days between the first 
and second clinical visit was 9.5 ± 
3.2 days (range, 4–16 days). Athletes 
participated in a variety of sports, 
including football (39% [27 of 69]), 
soccer (23% [16 of 69]), ice hockey 
(18% [13 of 69]), volleyball (7% [5 
of 69]), field hockey (4% [3 of 69]), 
rugby (3% [2 of 69]), basketball (3% 
[2 of 69]), and wrestling (1% [1 of 
69]). The representation of collision 
sports (eg, football, ice hockey, 
soccer, wrestling, rugby) did not 
differ between the REMOVED (45% 
[31 of 69]) and PLAYED (41% [28 of 
69]) groups (P = .46). Athletes in the 
REMOVED group did not participate 
in any practice and/or game from the 
time of injury to their first clinical 
evaluation and enrollment in the 
study; athletes in the PLAYED group 
continued to play in competition or 
practice after injury for an average 
of 19.2 ± 13.0 minutes. There were 
no significant differences between 
the REMOVED and PLAYED groups 
in terms of demographic or current 
injury-related variables ( 
Table 2).
Comparison of Neurocognitive 
Performance and Concussion 
Symptoms Between the REMOVED 
and PLAYED Groups
A series of 2 (group) × 3 (time), 
mixed-factorial analyses of variance 
revealed significant group × time 
interactions for verbal (η2 = 0.18; P = 
.002) and visual (η2 = 0.23; P ≤ .001) 
memory, processing speed (η2 = 0.23; 
P ≤ .001), reaction time (η2 = 0.20; 
P = .001), and total symptom score 
(η2 = 0.17; P = .002) that were all 
significant. Baseline verbal (P = .43) 
and visual (P = .31) memory, reaction 
time (P = .85), and total symptoms 
(P = .65) were similar between 
groups. The REMOVED group had 
significantly higher processing 
speed at baseline compared with 
the PLAYED group (P = .05). As a 
result, baseline processing speed 
was used as a covariate for a series of 
post hoc between-group analyses of 
covariance. The post hoc analyses of 
covariance revealed that the PLAYED 
group demonstrated significantly 
worse verbal (P = .001) and visual 
(P = .001) memory, processing speed 
(P ≤ .001), and reaction time (P = .001) 
and higher symptoms (P = .001) 
than the REMOVED group at 1 to 7 
days. At 8 to 30 days’ postinjury, the 
PLAYED group demonstrated worse 
verbal (P = .009) and visual (P ≤ 
.001) memory and processing speed 
(P = .001), and greater symptoms (P = 
.001), compared with the REMOVED 
group. Reaction time did not differ 
between groups at 8 to 30 days’ 
postinjury (P = .09).
Significant within-subject effects 
for time were also revealed for 
verbal (η2 = 0.16; P = .003) and 
visual (η2 = 0.24; P ≤ .001) memory, 
processing speed (η2 = 0.34; P ≤ 
.001), reaction time (η2 = 0.24; P ≤ 
.001), and total symptoms (η2 = 0.57;

P = .001). Verbal memory (P = .006), 
visual memory (P ≤ .001), reaction 
time (P = .001), and total symptom 
scores (P ≤ .001) were worse at 1 
to 7 days’ postinjury compared with 
baseline; at 8 to 30 days’ postinjury, 
visual memory (P = .005) and total 
symptoms (P ≤ .001) remained 
significantly lower than baseline, 
whereas verbal memory (P = .99) and 
reaction time impairments resolved 
(P = .63). Processing speed was not 
lower than baseline at 1 to 7 days 
(P = .98) but higher than baseline at 
8 to 30 days’ postinjury (P = .001).
Between-subject group effects for 
verbal memory (η2 = 0.16; P = .001), 
visual memory (η2 = 0.19; P ≤ .001), 
processing speed (η2 = 0.24; P ≤ 
.001), reaction time (η2 = 0.12; P = 
.003), and total symptom score (η2 = 
0.20; P ≤ .001) were all significant. 
The REMOVED group exhibited 
significantly higher verbal (P = .001) 
and visual (P ≤ .001) memory, and 
faster processing speed (P ≤ .001) 
and reaction time (P = .003), than 
the PLAYED group. The REMOVED 
group reported significantly fewer 
symptoms than the PLAYED group 
(P ≤ .001) ( 
Table 3).
Comparing Recovery Time Between 
PLAYED and REMOVED Groups
We were able to determine recovery 
time data for 62 (90%) of 69 athletes 
(30 in the PLAYED group and 32 in 
the REMOVED group). Seven (10%) 
of 69 athletes were lost to follow-up 
(ie, did not return to the clinic for 
a clearance visit during the study 
period). Independent sample t tests 
revealed that athletes in the PLAYED 
group experienced a significantly 
longer recovery time than those in 
the REMOVED group (d = 0.80; P = 
.003). The mean number of days from 
date of injury to medical clearance 
was 44.4 ± 36.0 days (range, 
10–164 days) for the PLAYED group 
compared with 22.0 ± 18.7 days 
(range, 8–88 days) for the REMOVED 
group.
Twenty-four (80%) of 30 athletes 
in the PLAYED group and 10 (31%) 
of 32 athletes in the REMOVED 
group demonstrated a protracted 
recovery (≥21 days). Athletes in the 
PLAYED group were 8.80 times more 
likely to experience a protracted 
recovery compared with athletes in 
the REMOVED group (V = 0.49; P < 
.001). The logistic regression was 
significant (χ2 [5, 60] = 27.07; P < 
.001) ( 
Table 4). Removal from play 
status showed the greatest likelihood 
of protracted recovery (adjusted 
OR, 14.27; P = .001) followed by sex 
(adjusted OR, 9.12; P = .01).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge this 
study is the first to compare recovery 
outcomes of athletes with an SRC 
who were immediately removed 
versus athletes who continued to play 
with an SRC. Athletes who continued 
to play with an SRC required nearly 
twice as long to recover than those 
who were immediately removed from 
play (44 vs 22 days). These athletes 
demonstrated worse postinjury 
neurocognitive and symptom 
presentation at 1 to 7 days and at 8 
to 30 days than athletes immediately 
removed from play. Removal from 
play status was also associated with 
a greater risk of protracted SRC 
recovery than other empirically 
supported factors. These results 
underscore the risks associated with 
continuing to play with an SRC, and 
they emphasize to athletes, parents, 
coaches, and on-field clinicians the

importance of timely recognition 
and/or identification of the signs and 
symptoms of SRCs and immediate 
removal from play.
Prolonged recovery outcomes 
exhibited by athletes who continued 
to play with an SRC may be a 
consequence of continued physical 
exertion that exacerbates the 
pathophysiologic and metabolic 
events that underlie concussive 
brain injury. 
10, 
 
27 Findings of the 
present study support experimental 
brain injury studies using animal 
models showing the deleterious 
effects (eg, decreased plasticity, 
increased neuroinflammation, worse 
cognitive performance) of continued 
exposure to physical activity after 
concussion. 
24, 
 
25 The present study 
extends these findings to human 
subjects.
Although the majority of SRCs 
resolve within 3 weeks, ∼20% of 
athletes with an SRC will experience 
a protracted recovery longer than 
this time frame. 
39, 
 
40 In an effort to 
identify these athletes and provide 
acute management and treatment 
interventions, several factors that 
predict protracted recovery have 
been identified in the literature, 
including age, 
 
4, 
 
36 concussion history, 
8 
sex, 
37 and posttraumatic migraine. 
35 
The present study supports 
removal from play status as a new 
injury-related modifying factor for 
predicting protracted recovery.
There are limitations to our study. 
The sample was small and included a 
large number of male football players 
and female soccer players ranging in 
age from 12 to 19 years. As such, the 
results may not be generalizable to 
other groups of athletes. It is unclear 
what happened (eg, additional hits, 
noncontact running only) to athletes 
who continued to play. Accordingly, it 
is uncertain if the detrimental effects 
of continuing to play are related 
to additional impacts or continued 
physical exertion. Athletes were 
recruited from a specialty clinic, 
which limits the generalizability 
to concussed athletes who do not 
receive specialty referral and may 
represent a sample bias given the 
high incidence of personal and family 
history of migraine. On-field signs 
and symptoms were retrospectively 
obtained via patient and parent 
recall, which may be influenced by 
recall bias. Future studies should 
quantify additional head impacts 
and physical exertion in athletes 
who continue to play with an 
SRC to examine a dose–response 
relationship and include a larger, 
diverse sport sample. Future studies 
should examine predictors (eg, 
concussion history, sex, sport type) 
of voluntary removal from play 
behaviors after SRC.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite increases in awareness, 
athletes continue to play with SRCs 
41 
with fear of being removed from 
participation. 
20 This study is the first 
to show that athletes who continue to 
play with an SRC experience a longer 
recovery and more time away from 
the sport. If athletes with a suspected 
SRC remove themselves or are 
removed by a medical professional, 
recovery time may be reduced. 
These data support the mantra of 
the Centers of Disease Control: "It's 
better to miss one game than the 
whole season." 
17 These findings 
should be incorporated into SRC 
education and awareness programs 
for athletes, coaches, parents, and 
medical professionals.
