In Brief
In Pabst et al., the authors describe a
mechanism through which
septohippocampal projections modulate
the activity of hippocampal neurons.
Using a combination of optogenetics,
in vivo and in vitro patch-clamp and
single-unit recordings, and multiphoton
imaging, the authors show that
acetylcholine release from cholinergic
septohippocampal projections causes a
long-lasting GABAergic inhibition of
hippocampal dentate granule cells. This
inhibition is caused by cholinergic
activation of hilar astrocytes, which
provide glutamatergic excitation of hilar
inhibitory interneurons. This constitutes a
novel mechanism: acetylcholine release
can cause slow inhibition of principal
neuronal activity via astrocyte
intermediaries.

SUMMARY
The neurotransmitter acetylcholine, derived from
the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca com-
plex, has been accorded an important role in hippo-
campal learning and memory processes. However,
the
precise
mechanisms
whereby
acetylcholine
released from septohippocampal cholinergic neu-
rons acts to modulate hippocampal microcircuits
remain unknown. Here, we show that acetylcholine
release from cholinergic septohippocampal pro-
jections causes a long-lasting GABAergic inhibition
of hippocampal dentate granule cells in vivo and
in vitro. This inhibition is caused by cholinergic acti-
vation of hilar astrocytes, which provide glutamater-
gic excitation of hilar inhibitory interneurons. These
results demonstrate that acetylcholine release can
cause slow inhibition of principal neuronal activity
via astrocyte intermediaries.
INTRODUCTION
The hippocampus is a critical structure for encoding of novel
experiences. A particularly compelling puzzle is how the hippo-
campus encodes new information in the presence of interfer-
ence from past memories. An influential hypothesis posits that
acetylcholine (ACh), which is released in the hippocampus
during novel experiences and learning, has an important role in
mediating the interplay between encoding and retrieval (Has-
selmo et al., 1996). Increased levels of ACh in the hippocampus
are known to be associated with successful encoding, and
disruption of the cholinergic system leads to impaired memory
formation. Both computational and experimental studies provide
support for a model in which high ACh levels during encoding
increase the magnitude of direct afferent cortical inputs, while
suppressing recurrent hippocampal excitatory circuits. Accord-
ingly, ACh released during encoding is thought to suppress
information transfer within the canonical trisynaptic intrahippo-
campal circuit, thus impeding the propagation of retrieved infor-
mation to CA1 following recurrent collateral-mediated pattern
completion in CA3 (McNaughton and Morris, 1987; Treves and
Rolls, 1992; Villarreal et al., 2007). At the same time, ACh spares
entorhinal inputs to CA3 and CA1, which mediates feedforward
sensory information (Villarreal et al., 2007). During retrieval pro-
cesses, the activity of the ACh system is thought to be low, shift-
ing the balance of CA1 inputs toward the canonical CA3 inputs.
How this might be achieved at the cellular and network level by
synaptically released ACh is a topic of intense interest (Lea
˜ o
et al., 2012) as ACh exerts complex effects on specific types of
neurons, and even on astrocytes (Araque et al., 2002). Using a
combination of optogenetic techniques, in vivo and in vitro elec-
trophysiology and multiphoton imaging, we show that synaptic
release of ACh causes inhibition of the canonical hippocampal
circuit via astroglial intermediaries.
RESULTS
Septohippocampal Cholinergic Projections Inhibit
Granule Cells In Vivo and In Vitro
To selectively examine the effects of the septal cholinergic
projection, we expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (hChR2(H134R))
only in septal cholinergic neurons using recombinant adeno-as-
sociated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene transfer (see Experimental
Procedures; Figures S1A–S1C). Blue light stimulation (473 nm) of
individual ChR2-eYFP+ medial septal cholinergic neurons during
patch-clamp recording caused large inward currents (Figures
S1D and S1E), and precise and reliable firing up to frequencies
of 20 Hz (Figures S1F–S1H; average action potential latency after
onset of light stimulus 9.96 ± 1.30 ms, n = 9 neurons; Figures S1G
and S1H; firing probability in Figures S1I–S1L). In the hippocam-
pus, a dense axonal plexus of ChR2-eYFP+ axons could be iden-
tified (Figure S2).
To examine how synaptic ACh release from septohippocam-
pal axons affects hippocampal neurons, we obtained in vivo
patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal dentate granule cells
in anesthetized mice (Figure 1A). Brief train (10 3 10 ms stimuli at
10 Hz) stimulation of cholinergic medial septum/diagonal band of
Broca (MSDB) neurons with blue light (473 nm) via an optical

 fiber inserted stereotactically above the MSDB resulted in clear
hyperpolarizing responses in all granule neurons recorded (n =
5, 4.33 ± 0.68 mV; Figure 1B). The light-evoked hyperpolarization
was slow, with a delayed onset (158 ± 35 ms, n = 5) and outlasted
the end of the stimulation train by >1 s. This light-evoked hyper-
polarization of dentate granule cells potently inhibited tonic
action potential firing induced by injection of a small depolarizing
current to achieve action potential firing at a frequency of �3 Hz
(Figures 1C and 1D; n = 3, p < 0.001, paired t test).
To further examine the network basis and pharmacology of
the inhibitory response in dentate granule cells, we performed
in vitro slice experiments. Even though stimulation of septal
cholinergic neurons was reliable (Figure S1), direct light-based
stimulation of cholinergic axons in hippocampal slices (20 ms,
473 nm) caused hyperpolarizations of granule cells, but this
occurred in only approximately half of the stimulations (56.3%).
Indeed, direct stimulation of axons expressing ChR2, including
cholinergic axons, has been surprisingly inefficient in triggering
action potentials (Grubb and Burrone, 2010; Nagode et al.,
2011). Using the ChR2 variant ChETA (Gunaydin et al., 2010),
which generates faster kinetics and larger photocurrents, also
resulted in pronounced hyperpolarizations in granule cells (suc-
cess rate 38.7% of light stimulation; Figure S3). Repetitive
stimulation as under in vivo conditions resulted in prolonged
hyperpolarizations (Figure S3). To enhance the reliability of the
responses, we added low concentrations of the K+ channel
blocker 4-AP (40 mM) to the perfusate. Addition of K+ channel
blockers has been shown to result in reliable axonal stimulation
(Grubb and Burrone, 2010). Indeed, this resulted in reliable
generation of large granule cell hyperpolarizations or outward
current (success rate 100%; Figures 1E and 1F) and was used
for subsequent pharmacological experiments. The outward
currents were blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist
gabazine (10 mM, block by 90.9% ± 5.0%, p = 0.0324, n = 5,
paired one-tailed t test; Figure 1G). Next, we confirmed that
light-evoked responses rely on ACh release. Light-evoked re-
sponses in dentate granule cells were not significantly affected
by atropine only (5 mM) but were blocked by additional appli-
cation of the nicotinic antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA,
50 nM, n = 9, one-way ANOVA, p = 0.0265, F(2,20) = 4.375,
Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, *p < 0.05; Figure 1I). In addi-
tion, application of MLA alone at lower concentrations (20 nM),
that are selective for a7-containing over a3 or a4-containing
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs, Drasdo et al., 1992;
Macallan et al., 1988; Sharples and Wonnacott, 2001; Whiteaker
et al., 1998), also significantly reduced light-evoked responses in
granule cells (n = 7, reduction by 76.7% ± 16.4%, p = 0.0095,
paired t test).
Responses were observed in virtually all dentate granule
cells measured (70 of 71 neurons, average magnitude 7.05 ±
0.42 mV). A hyperpolarization was always the dominant compo-
nent of the response (quantification in Figure 1H). In 36 granule
cells, an initial small depolarization preceded the hyperpolar-
ization (example shown in Figure 1H, upper panel). However,
these initial depolarizations were small, and never of sufficient
magnitude to evoke action potentials. Responses were never
observed in animals lacking ChR2 expression in the hippocam-
pus (n = 6, 0.25 ± 0.09 mV; Figure 1H, lower panel). One notable
feature of the light-evoked voltage responses was their time
course. The onset of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) was delayed
(average time of onset of the hyperpolarization 236.4 ± 41.1 ms,
ChR2 without perfusion of 4-AP 206.7 ± 31.7 ms, ChETA without
perfusion of 4-AP 292.5 ± 58.2 ms), and long lasting (>2 s; see
Figure 1J, false color image voltage over time for all dentate
granule cells; Figures S3A and S3B). As in in vivo recordings, ac-
tion potential firing was strongly inhibited by cholinergic inhibi-
tory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). A single light stimulation
caused a prolonged inhibition of granule cell firing evoked
by prolonged current injections (Figures 1K–1M; p = 0.0067,
n = 6, paired t test). In the presence of gabazine (10 mM), no
effects of optogenetic stimulation were observed (Figure 1M;
n = 3, p = 0.4778, paired t test, significant difference to control
recordings p = 0.0071, unpaired t test, as indicated by x).
Septohippocampal Cholinergic Projections Activate
Hilar Inhibitory and Excitatory Interneurons
These data are consistent with the idea that ACh release from
septohippocampal axons may excite hilar interneurons, causing
GABAergic inhibition in granule cells. In vivo patch-clamp re-
cordings from hilar interneurons are not feasible, due to the
low density of these neurons. We therefore performed in vivo sil-
icon probe recordings, enabling us to detect single unit activity
within the dentate hilus (Figures 2A–2C; see Experimental Proce-
dures). The hilus contains a mixed population of interneurons, as
well as glutamatergic mossy cells. Inhibitory neuron unit activity
was discriminated according to the spike autocorrelogram and
spike shape (Figures 2A and 2B). Based on previous publications
(i.e., Jung and McNaughton, 1993), this allowed us to identify a
population of putative fast-spiking interneurons with narrow
spikes and a characteristic autocorrelogram (Figure 2C, blue cir-
cles; representative example in Figure 2A shown as filled circle).
Putative fast-spiking interneurons showed clear light-evoked in-
creases in activity (example unit recording in Figures 2D and 2E;
time course of average spiking rate in Figure 2F). Significant
increases in spiking rates were observed during episodes of
blue light stimulation (10 s of stimulation at either 12 or 20 Hz;
Figures 2G–2I; n = 18 mice, n = 29 units, ***p < 0.001 in Figure 2G;
Wilcoxon signed-rank test). With shorter stimulations (ten stimuli
at 12 Hz), similar to those used for in vivo patch-clamp record-
ings from dentate granule neurons (see Figure 1), we also
found a significant increase in firing rate (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Most of the 29 putative fast-spiking interneu-
rons showed light-evoked increases in firing rate, with 26/29 in-
terneurons showing positive Z scores indicative of increases in
(K–M) Light-evoked inhibition of repetitive firing in granule cells evoked by prolonged current injections (example in K). Raster plot for all measured cells is shown.
The quantification of the normalized number of action potentials without and with light-induced inhibition with and without the GABAA receptor antagonist
gabazine (10 mM) is shown (M).
Asterisks indicate significant effects of light stimulation of firing frequency, p = 0.0067, paired t test, n = 6). x indicates significant difference in the presence of
gabazine compared to control recordings, p = 0.0071, unpaired t test). Data are represented as mean ± SEM.

 firing rate (Figure 2I). The identity of the neurons not classified as
fast-spiking interneurons (Figures 2B and 2C, green circles;
representative example in Figure 2B shown as filled circle) could
not be unequivocally determined and likely represents a mixed
population of neurons that may include mossy cells, other
types of hilar interneurons, and occasionally granule cells (Jung
and McNaughton, 1993). These neurons showed no significant
average changes infiring rate (Figures S4B–S4D, green symbols).
To obtain a more precise idea of how different types of dentate
interneurons are affected by synaptic ACh release, we turned to
in vitro patch-clamp experiments in hippocampal slices. We first
recorded from hilar inhibitory interneurons with a soma and
most dendrites within the hilar region (n = 30; example in Fig-
ure 3A, left panel). The axonal distribution of these cells was
heterogeneous. However, regardless of their morphology, inter-
neurons displayed a stereotypical response following ChR2 stim-
ulation of cholinergic afferents. All interneurons showed robust
depolarizations followed in many cases by small hyperpolariza-
tions (depolarization: 14.1 ± 1.4 mV, 30 of 30 interneurons, hyper-
polarization: 2.4 ± 0.6 mV, 17 of 30 interneurons; Figure 3A). 18 of
30 neurons fired ACh-induced action potentials (Figures 3A and
3F; mean latency 213.7 ± 36.1 ms, n = 18). The depolarizations

Figure 3. Cholinergic Septohippocampal Fibers Activate Hilar Inhibitory Interneurons and Mossy Cells
(A and C–E) Effects of light-based stimulation of cholinergic fibers on different types of dentate interneurons assessed using patch-clamp recordings in hip-
pocampal slices. Leftmost panels always show morphological reconstructions of representative recorded neurons (A, hilar inhibitory interneuron; C, hilar mossy
cell; D, dentate molecular layer interneuron; E, semilunar granule cell). Note that only a short portion of the axon of the semilunar granule cell was recovered. Gray
areas correspond to dentate granule cell layer. Middle panels show the corresponding discharge behavior elicited by current injections; insets in (C) and (E) show
higher magnification of distinctive action potential firing. Rightmost panels display the effects of optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic axons (stimulation time
point shown in blue, insets in A and C show the excitatory responses to optogenetic stimulation at higher magnification).
(B) Effects of 20 nM MLA on light-evoked responses in hilar interneurons. Left panel, representative example; right panel, quantification of light-evoked EPSP
magnitude.
(F) Magnitude of the light-induced PSPs in the different cell types. Note that action potentials were only generated by light stimulation in a subset of hilar in-
terneurons and mossy cells, never in other types of neurons.

 in hilar interneurons in vitro preceded the granule cell hyperpolar-
izations, as expected if hilar interneurons give rise to GABAergic
inhibition of granule cells (onset of excitatory postsynaptic poten-
tials (EPSPs) in hilar interneurons 129.7 ± 16.1 ms, n = 30; average
onset of IPSPs in granule cells in vitro 236.4 ± 47.5 ms, n = 70).
Because optogenetic responses in granule cells were blocked
by nicotinic, but not muscarinic antagonists, we assessed the ef-
fects of the nicotinic blocker MLA (20 nM). Interneuron responses
were strongly reduced by blocking nicotinic AChRs (Figure 3B;
reduction by 63.4% ± 18.3%, p = 0.03637, paired t test, n = 6).
We also recorded from glutamatergic hilar mossy cells, which
displayed the classical thorny excrescences typical of these
neurons, as well as burst-like firing (representative example in
Figure 3C, left panels, see inset for larger magnification of thorny
excrescences, n = 13). Seven of 13 mossy cells were strongly de-
polarized by synaptic ACh release (Figure 3C; average depolar-
ization: 19.3 ± 1.8 mV, n = 7), while the remaining mossy cells did
not show detectable responses (average over all 13 mossy cells
10.4 ± 2.9 mV; Figure 3F). In the seven activated mossy cells,
ACh released from septohippocampal fibers was occasionally
sufficient to elicit action potential firing (mean latency 209.4 ±
38.5 ms, n = 7; see example in Figure 3C, enlarged in inset).
When pooling hilar interneurons and mossy cells (43 neurons),
25 neurons of both types fired action potentials (58%). This is in a
similar range as the overall response rate of hilar neurons in vivo
measured in single-unit recordings (56 of 80 neurons, 70%).
In contrast to hilar neurons, inhibitory and excitatory interneu-
rons located in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were
much less affected. GABAergic interneurons within the molecu-
lar layer showed only small responses to synaptic ACh release
(average EPSP size: 3.4 ± 2.3 mV, average IPSP size 0.1 ± 0.6,
n = 9; Figures 3D and 3F; n-numbers in brackets in Figure 3F).
Likewise, semilunar granule cells, which are located at the apical
border of the granule cell layer and can provide local excitation to
hilar neurons upon perforant path stimulation (Larimer and
Strowbridge, 2010), were largely unaffected by light stimulation
(depolarization: 1.0 ± 0.3 mV, hyperpolarization: 0.4 ± 0.4 mV,
n = 3; Figures 3E and 3F), indicating that they do not contribute
to hilar activation by ACh. These data show that, within the
dentate gyrus, cholinergic excitation is most marked in cells
with dendrites within the hilar region. Interneurons within the
molecular layer, as well as the granule cells themselves, in
contrast, show small responses that never reach the threshold
for action potential generation.
Activation of Hilar Interneurons Is Mediated via a
Glutamatergic Relay
We next asked whether hilar interneurons and mossy cells are
directly activated by septohippocampal cholinergic inputs. We
attempted to isolate cholinergic EPSPs by blocking glutamater-
gic excitatory neurotransmission. However, combined applica-
tion of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitro-
quinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 mM) and the NMDA-receptor
antagonist
D-(2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric
acid
(D-AP5,
50 mM) completely blocked light-evoked action potentials (Fig-
ure 4A, left panel) and strongly reduced EPSPs in hilar interneu-
rons (n = 11, p = 0.0005, paired t test; Figure 4A, right panel;
reduction of EPSP magnitude by 97.5% ± 1.65%). Likewise,
we applied CNQX and D-AP5 to a subset of mossy cells that
showed robust light-evoked responses. This caused a very
strong, consistent reduction of light evoked EPSPs in mossy
cells (n = 4, p = 0.0022, paired t test; Figure 4B; reduction of
EPSP magnitude by 88.4% ± 2.2%). Accordingly, light-evoked
IPSPs in granule neurons were also potently reduced by
CNQX/D-AP5 (Figure 4C; n = 13, p = 0.0002, paired t test, reduc-
tion of IPSP magnitude by 68.4% ± 10.0%).
Thus, the microcircuit leading to activation of hilar inter-
neurons/mossy cells, and ultimately to inhibition of dentate
granule neurons contains a glutamatergic relay. Recent evi-
dence suggests that cholinergic stimulation can cause delayed
neuronal excitation through glial glutamate release (Araque
et al., 2002; Navarrete et al., 2012). Therefore, we investigated
whether the cholinergic excitation of hilar GABAergic interneu-
rons might be mediated via astrocyte intermediaries.
Astrocytes Are Intermediaries of Septal Cholinergic
Modulation of Hippocampal Neurons
We first asked whether ACh causes Ca2+ elevations in astrocytes
using multiphoton Ca2+ imaging. After bulk loading with OGB-1,
astrocytes were identified by costaining with sulforhodamine
(SR101; see Experimental Procedures; Figure 5A). ACh release
evoked by optogenetic stimulation caused early Ca2+ increases

 in 52.6% ± 12.6% of hilar astrocytes (88 astrocytes from eight
slices; Figure 5A), similar in time course to rapid astrocytic
transients described previously (Winship et al., 2007). To more
precisely resolve the time course of Ca2+ increases in astro-
cytes, we performed fast line scans (371 Hz). From these data,
we determined the kinetics of the astrocytic Ca2+ signal
(onset 187.7 ± 14.8 ms after onset of light stimulation, range
115–244 ms, 20%–80% rise time 37.8 ± 7.0 ms, decay time con-
stant 1,088 ± 109 ms, n = 7 line scans in four slices, examples in
Figure S5B). In addition, a smaller subset of astrocytes showed
slower Ca2+ elevations with a more delayed onset (Figure 5B,
gray and black arrows indicate slow and fast transients,
respectively). The slow Ca2+ responses—although much more
infrequent than the fast responses—were also significantly
augmented compared to spontaneously occurring Ca2+ tran-
sients (5-s pre-stimulus period compared to 5-s poststimulus
period, 0.22% ± 0.22% versus 5.36% ± 2.49% of astrocytes,
p = 0.008, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 7). The fast astrocytic
Ca2+ transients were unaffected by blocking glutamate recep-

tors (10 mM CNQX), and by additional
application of atropine (50 mM). However,
they were significantly reduced by addi-
tional application of the nicotinic ACh
blockers MLA or mecamylamine (20 nM
or 20 mM respectively, n = 52 astrocytes
in four slices; Figure 5A, right panel for
example; Figure 5C; p = 0.005 repea-
ted-measures ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, con-
trol versus nACh blockers p < 0.05). Control experiments without
virus injection or without light stimulation did not reveal appre-
ciable Ca2+ transients (Figure 5D; n = 3 slices for each condition).
Because our results demonstrate that light-evoked excitatory
responses are robust in hilar neurons, but much less so in molec-
ular layer interneurons, granule cells, or semilunar granule cells,
we wondered whether astrocytic activation within the dentate
molecular layer might be less robust. We therefore also assessed
astrocytic Ca2+ transients in the dentate molecular layer in
slices bulk-loaded with Oregon green 488 BAPTA-1 (OGB-1).
When applying the same quantitative criteria that were used
for hilar astrocytes, the fraction of molecular layer astrocytes
that showed Ca2+ elevations was relatively low (molecular layer:
28.2% ± 14.4%, 36 astrocytes from six slices, hilus: 52.6% ±
12.6%, 88 astrocytes from eight slices, not significant; Fig-
ure S5C, right panel). The peak magnitude of Ca2+ transients
proved to be significantly smaller in molecular layer compared
to hilar astrocytes (Figure S5C; two-tailed t test, p < 0.00005).
Neuron 90, 853–865, May 18, 2016

 To additionally confirm the presence of Ca2+ transients in as-
trocytes evoked by synaptic ACh release, we used AAVs of the
2/5 serotype and the minimal astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D pro-
moter to express the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f
in hilar astrocytes, as previously described for the CA1 region
(Srinivasan et al., 2015). This revealed clear SR101-labeled as-
trocytes that express GCaMP6f (Figure 5E). Optogenetic stimu-
lation resulted in clear Ca2+ transients in GCaMP6f-expressing
astrocytes (n = 9 astrocytes from five slices; see Figure 5F for
representative single sweeps from the astrocyte in Figure 5E,
average transient depicted as black line).
To causally investigate the involvement of astrocyte activation
in mediating cholinergic dentate inhibition, we first preincubated
slices with an unspecific inhibitor of glial metabolism, fluoroace-
tate (FAc, 5mM). FAc is known to inhibit glioneuronal transmis-
sion (Henneberger et al., 2010). Preincubation with FAc caused
a strong reduction of dentate inhibition compared to alternating
control experiments without FAc preincubation (n = 11 and 3,
respectively, p = 0.0005, unpaired t test; Figure 6A) or to non-in-
terleaved controls (n = 71, p < 0.0001, unpaired t test, data not
shown). Since FAc may exert a number of unspecific effects on
the network, we sought to manipulate astroglial activation
more selectively. We obtained patch-clamp recordings from
individual astrocytes with an intracellular solution containing
40 mM of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)etha-
ne-N,N,N0,N0-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). Diffusion of BAPTA via
the patch pipette into the astrocytic syncytium should selectively
block glial Ca2 signaling (Araque et al., 1998). Astrocyte record-
ings were carried out in the hilus or at the CA3-hilar border.
Simultaneously, we recorded from dentate granule cells (Fig-
ures 6B and 6C). Granule cell recordings obtained before
intracellular dialysis of astrocytes with BAPTA invariably dis-
played light-evoked IPSPs, whereas granule cells recorded
after >30 min of astrocytic whole-cell recordings showed a
reduced IPSP (n = 10, 68.5% ± 14.8% reduction after 30 min
compared to initial IPSP size; Figures 6D and 6E, empty circles;
repeated-measures ANOVA, p < 0.0001, F(3,24) = 8.480, Dun-
nett’s multiple comparison test p < 0.01 for time points 30 and
40 min, indicated with **). The IPSPs observed after BAPTA dial-
ysis were significantly reduced in comparison to prolonged con-
trol dual recordings in which no astrocytic recording was carried
out (n = 9 control recordings, filled circles), or in which BAPTA
was omitted from the astrocytic recording pipette (n = 4 paired
recordings, empty squares). ANOVA revealed significant group
differences at the 40-min time point (F(2,19) = 9.28, p = 0.002, Bon-
ferroni post hoc test p = 0.005 for control versus astrocytic
BAPTA, p = 0.009 for control astrocytic recording versus astro-
cytic BAPTA, indicated by x; Figure 6E). The duration of the
light-induced inhibition of dentate granule cells was not signifi-
cantly changed either in prolonged control recordings, or in
dual recordings without BAPTA in the astrocytic patch pipette
(one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test, F(3, 31) = 2.003, p =
0.134 and repeated-measures ANOVA with Dunnett’s post
test, F(3, 9) = 5.192, p = 0.4956, respectively, Figure S6). These re-
sults predict that dialysis of the astrocytic syncytium with BAPTA
would also reduce activation of hilar inhibitory interneurons.

 Indeed, prolonged (>40 min) astrocytic recordings with 40 mM
BAPTA resulted in significantly smaller EPSPs in hilar interneu-
rons compared to control recordings without astrocytic dialysis
(4.9 ± 3.8 mV versus 13.7 ± 1.4 mV, p < 0.05, unpaired t test,
n = 5 and 31, respectively).
DISCUSSION
These results demonstrate that ACh release causes a slow
inhibition of principal neuronal activity via astrocyte interme-
diaries. Consistent with our data, astrocytes are known to ex-
press cholinergic receptors, among them functional a7 nicotinic
and muscarinic receptors (Guizzetti et al., 2008; Hernandez
et al., 2014; Shen and Yakel, 2012). Further, ACh release can
activate astrocytes (Navarrete et al., 2012; Takata et al.,
2011), which, in turn, can release transmitters including gluta-
mate (Bezzi et al., 2004; Volterra and Meldolesi, 2005). Notably,
we find that the excitatory action of astrocytic activation is
mainly observed in neurons located within the dentate hilus.
Excitation of cells with dendrites within the molecular layer,
such as semilunar granule cells, molecular layer interneurons,
or granule cells was more rarely observed. This is consistent
with earlier work describing that astrocytes in the molecular
layer do not directly depolarize granule cells, but rather modu-
late presynaptic glutamate release onto granule cell dendrites
via presynaptic NR2B NMDA receptors (Jourdain et al., 2007).
Moreover, selective signaling of astrocytes to specific types
of interneurons has been observed in visual cortex (Perea
et al., 2014). Taken together, this is consistent with the view
that glutamate released from astrocytes can have specific
actions on some, but not other neuronal elements within the
same region (Jourdain et al., 2007).
Our experiments that selectively interfere with astrocytic func-
tion show that astrocytic intermediaries play an important role in
mediating cholinergic slow inhibition of granule cells. However,
we note that there were residual effects of optogenetic stimula-
tion, suggesting that other, non-astrocytic pathways may exist.
Indeed, nicotinic ACh receptors directly excite hilar interneurons
as well as mossy cells (Frazier et al., 2003), providing an addi-
tional pathway that may contribute to inhibition of granule
cells. It is intriguing that direct nicotinic excitation of interneurons
may be more relevant in specific interneuron subtypes of other
hippocampal subregions. In the CA1 region, for instance, oriens
lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells are powerfully and directly
excited by ACh release via nicotinic receptors (Lea
˜ o et al.,
2012). This argues for region-specific differences in cholinergic
control of interneurons.
The slow GABAergic inhibition of granule cells via cholinergic
excitation of astrocytic intermediaries has implications for the
actions of ACh in the intact brain. In vivo, ACh is released in
particular during encoding of novel experiences. In the hippo-
campus, an influential model has posited that high ACh
levels selectively suppress activity in the recurrently connected
CA3 neuron network, which conveys retrieved information to
CA1 following recurrent collateral-mediated pattern completion
in CA3 (Douchamps et al., 2013; McNaughton and Morris,
1987; Rogers and Kesner, 2004; Villarreal et al., 2007). At the
same time, direct entorhinal inputs to CA3 and CA1 conveying
sensory information are left untouched (Villarreal et al., 2007).
Indeed, synaptic ACh release was recently shown to inhibit
sharp wave ripples generated by the auto-associative CA3
network (Vandecasteele et al., 2014), as well as CA3 principal
cell firing rates (Dannenberg et al., 2015). Taken together with
the present results, this suggests that ACh release inhibits
both the recurrent CA3 network, but also the inputs to this
recurrent network from dentate gyrus, suggesting cholinergic
inhibition of the canonical hippocampal circuit at two sequential
stations.
It should be noted that an increase in activity of cholinergic
medial septal neurons also has indirect effects on hippo-
campal ensembles. Recent evidence shows that optogeneti-
cally stimulating cholinergic MSDB neurons causes increased
hippocampal theta synchronization (Dannenberg et al., 2015;
Vandecasteele et al., 2014). This theta synchronization requires
an intraseptal cholinergic relay, presumably via muscarinic acti-
vation of GABAergic septal neurons (Dannenberg et al., 2015).
The combination of increased theta rhythmogenesis and inhibi-
tion of principal neurons has been demonstrated to enhance
theta spike-phase coupling, which may potentially be important
for spike synchrony between subregions during encoding of new
memories.
Consistent with a relevant role of astrocytically mediated ACh
effect in behavior, disrupting gliotransmitter release from astro-
cytes selectively impairs novel object recognition memory, but
not other types of memory (Lee et al., 2014). Likewise, genetic
deletion of a7 nicotinic receptors causes mild but significant
deficits in spatial learning (see Levin, 2012 for review).
Interestingly, alternate pathways can lead to sustained den-
tate hilar activation, for instance, via recruitment of semilunar
granule cells by perforant path inputs (Larimer and Strowbridge,
2010). This mechanism has also been suggested to be related to
encoding of novel stimuli (Larimer and Strowbridge, 2010).
Indeed, persistent firing in hilar neurons has been demonstrated
during working memory tasks in vivo (Colombo and Gross,
1994). This suggests that multiple novelty-related pathways
converge on modulation of dentate inhibition.
It may be important to address the integrity of this pathway in
disease conditions. In temporal lobe epilepsy and following
traumatic brain injury, hilar neurons are lost (Lowenstein et al.,
1992), and the extent of hilar neuron loss correlates with memory
impairment (Lukoyanov et al., 2004; Sass et al., 1992; Smith
et al., 1994). In Alzheimer’s disease, a pronounced loss of
MSDB cholinergic neurons occurs at early stages. In this disor-
der, amyloid b is capable of itself inducing astrocytic glutamate
release via ACh receptors. Moreover, reactive astrocytes in
Alzheimer’s disease models release GABA (Jo et al., 2014).
This suggests that a regulated cholinergic control of dentate
excitability may be replaced with nonspecific mechanisms
releasing GABA and glutamate (Pirttimaki et al., 2013; Talantova
et al., 2013).
In summary, our data establish a previously unappreciated
cholinergic circuit motif that regulates the excitability of hippo-
campal dentate granule cells via astrocytic excitation of hilar in-
terneurons. This is pertinent for the function of the dentate gyrus
as a key relay governing information transfer from the entorhinal
cortex into the hippocampal canonical circuit.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of
the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Bonn.
Animals and Viral Gene Transfer
Cell-specific expression of hChR2(H134R)-eYFP in cholinergic neurons was
achieved using transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control
of
the
ChAT
promoter
(B6;129S6-Chattm1(cre)Lowl/J,
RRID:
IMSR_JAX:
006410; Rossi et al., 2011). Heterozygous mice were used for all experiments.
A rAAV harboring a ChR2-eYFP fusion gene with an inverted open reading
frame, flanked by two incompatible loxP sites, and driven by the ubiquitous
promoter elongation factor-1a (EF1a) was injected into the medial septum
(Cardin et al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009). Recombination in Cre-recombinase ex-
pressing neurons led to robust expression of ChR2-eYFP. Virus preparation
was carried out as previously described (van Loo et al., 2012; see Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). Briefly, after deep anesthesia ChAT-cre
mice (>4 weeks old) were fixed in a stereotactic frame (Model 901, David
Kopf Instruments), and a small incision was made to localize bregma. Coordi-
nates for the craniotomy to target the MSDB were (from bregma): 1.0 mm ante-
rior, 0.7 mm lateral, and 4.8 and 4.4 mm ventral, 10� angle. Two dorso-ventral
injection sites (1 ml viral particle suspension per injection site) were used to
target a larger volume of the MSDB and to increase the number of ChR2-eYFP
expressing cholinergic axons projecting to the hippocampus (injection speed:
200 nl/min). The incision was sutured and mice were allowed to wake up.
Post-surgery treatment with buprenorphin (0.05 mg/kg body weight intraperi-
toneally [i.p.] at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hr after surgery). For details on virus injec-
tion, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
In Vitro Electrophysiology
Brains were removed and transferred into cold sucrose-containing carbo-
gen-saturated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) NaCl,
60; sucrose, 100; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 5;
glucose, 20). Horizontal slices of the MSDB or the hippocampus (300 mm)
were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT 1200 S), incubated for 30 min at 37�C,
and transferred into ASCF containing (in mM) NaCl, 125; KCl, 3; NaH2PO4,
1.25; NaHCO3, 26; CaCl2, 2.6; MgCl2, 1.3; glucose, 15).
For electrophysiology, slices were transferred into a submerged chamber
and superfused with carbogen-saturated ACSF (3 ml/min, 35�C). Intracellular
solution for whole-cell current clamp recordings contained (in mM) K-gluco-
nate, 140; 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES-acid),
5; EGTA, 0.16; MgCl2, 0.5; sodium phosphocreatine, 5; and 0.3% biocytin.
For whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we used a solution containing (in
mM) Cesium methanesulfonate, 120; QX-314Cl, 5; HEPES-acid, 5; EGTA,
0.16; MgCl2, 0.5; sodium phosphocreatine, 5; and 0.3% biocytin. See Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures for a more detailed description on neuron
identification for electrophysiological experiments and post hoc discrimination
by immunohistochemistry and functional properties.
In the majority of in vitro slice experiments, 40 mM of the K+-channel antag-
onist 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, Tocris Bioscience) was added to the ACSF for
more reliable light-based stimulation of the cholinergic ChR2+ axons (see
also Nagode et al., 2011). In some experiments, slices were pre-incubated
in ACSF containing the glia-specific toxin FAc (5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) for
15 min prior to electrophysiology. The osmolarity was readjusted to 307
mOsm by reducing the concentration of glucose to 10 mM. Voltage- and cur-
rent-clamp experiments were carried out with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier
(Molecular Devices). Data were sampled at 50 or 100 kHz with a Digidata
1322A interface (Molecular Devices) controlled by pClamp Software (Molecu-
lar Devices), low-pass filtered at 10 kHz, and stored on a hard disk for offline
analysis.
Dual Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recordings
For identification of astrocytes, slices were transferred after dissection into
carbogen-saturated ACSF containing (in mM) NaCl, 60; sucrose, 100; KCl,
2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 5; glucose, 20 with addi-
tionally 0.5 mM sulforhodamine 101 (SR101, Sigma-Aldrich) to label astrocytes
(Kafitz et al., 2008; Nimmerjahn et al., 2004; Schnell et al., 2012). Neuronal
whole-cell recordings were achieved as described above, and the ability to
elicit reproducible light-based cholinergic responses was verified. Subse-
quently, a second recording pipette with higher pipette resistance (5–7 MU)
was used to obtain recordings from SR101 positive astrocytes located in
the polymorphic layer. These pipettes were filled with intracellular solution
appropriate for astrocytic recordings (in mM) MgCl2, 1; NaCl, 8; adenosine
triphosphate disodium salt (ATP-Na2), 2; guanosine-50-triphosphate (GTP),
0.4; HEPES-acid, 10; 40 mM BAPTA (Sigma-Aldrich; Navarrete et al., 2012).
Control recordings were done under identical conditions but without BAPTA
in the recording solution (in mM) as follows: KMeSO4, 100; KCl, 50; HEPES,
10; ATP-Na2, 4 (pH 7.3). Other control recordings included prolonged record-
ings from dentate granule cells under identical conditions, but without astro-
cytic whole-cell recordings. All chemicals for physiological experiments
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
In Vivo Single-Unit Recordings
After deep anesthesia the animal’s head was fixed in a stereotactic frame
(Model 901, David Kopf Instruments). One end of an optical fiber (0.22 numer-
ical aperture [NA], 550-mm core, BFL22-550, Thorlabs) was implanted just
above the MSDB, such that the tip was advanced 4 mm of radial distance
from the cortical surface, with a 10� polar and �90� azimuth angle starting
from the atlas coordinates 1 mm anterior to bregma and 0.7 mm lateral-right
to the midline. A 1.2-mm major diameter screw (00-96x1/16 mouse screw,
PlasticsOne) was implanted above the cerebellum as reference electrode. A
cranial window was drilled 1.7 mm posterior to bregma and 1.0–2.2 mm later-
al-right to the midline above the dorsal hippocampus. The dura mater was
removed to implant a silicon probe aiming to a depth of 2.2 mm from the
cortical surface. The heart rate was monitored and recorded via a steel needle
in the skin of the fore or hind paw (referenced to the ground). For details on
in vivo optical stimulation and determination of electrode position, see Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
After surgery, mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine
(100 mg/kg body weight/20 mg/kg body weight i.p., respectively), and after
heart perfusion the brain was removed and stored for 4 days at 4�C in a fixation
solution containing 4% methanol-stabilized formalin (F1635, Sigma-Aldrich),
solved in PBS. For details on further tissue processing, see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Silicon probes were from NeuroNexus (Greatbatch) (A4x8-5mm-100-
400-413-A32). This probe style has 32 electrodes with an area of 413 mm2,
distributed on four 15-mm-thick shanks with each shank having eight elec-
trodes vertically distributed with 100-mm spacing. The distance between
shanks was 400 mm. Intrahippocampal local field potential (LFP) signals
were amplified (1003) and acquired continuously at 48 kHz on a 32-channel
recording system with 16-bit resolution (dacqUSB, Axona).
Single-Unit Analysis
For offline spike sorting of unit activity, the wideband signal was digitally
high-pass filtered (0.3–3 kHz, second-order elliptic filter with 0.1 dB of ripple
in the passband, and a stopband 40 dB down from the peak value in the pass-
band). Details on automatic spike detection, sorting, and classification of cell
types can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
For the quantification of the optogenetic stimulation effect on each unit’s
spiking rate, spiking rate was measured over the 10-s stimulation time periods
(30–40 s or 70–80 s of the recording time for 12- or 20-Hz stimulation, respec-
tively) and compared to a 10-s time segment (15–25 s of the recording time)
during the baseline period.
In Vivo Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recordings
In vivo patch recordings were performed on adult mice (7–10 weeks old). The
animals were initially anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg
body weight and 10 mg/kg body weight i.p., respectively). Tracheal intubation
was made and the animals were artificially respirated with isofluorane
(0.5%–1%) mixed with carbogen (mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon
dioxide) throughout the experiments. Body temperature was kept at 36.5�C
using a heating pad and rectal thermometer.
A small craniotomy was made above the dentate gyrus (centered 2.0 mm pos-
terior and 1.4 mm lateral to bregma). A portion of the dura mater was carefully
862
Neuron 90, 853–865, May 18, 2016
 removed to allow a clean penetration of the glass pipette. We performed
whole-cell current-clamp recordings from dentate granule cells with a patch
pipette (resistance �7 MU). The intracellular solution contained (in mM) K-gluco-
nate, 135; KCl, 4; MgATP, 4; Na2phosphocreatine, 10; Na3GTP, 0.3; HEPES, 10
(pH 7.3), Osm 289. With this intracellular solution, a liquid junction potential of
�15 mV was estimated and corrected. For post-recording cell identification,
we added 4% biocytin to the intracellular solution. Coordinates for dentate
granule cell recordings were (from bregma): 2.0 mm posterior, 1.4 mm lateral,
and 1.5–2.2 mm ventral until a neuron attached the tip of the recording pipette.
Stimulation of ChR2+ cholinergic neurons in the MSDB was carried out using
a laser (473 nm), which was coupled to a custom-made light fiber. The light
fiber was placed in the MSDB (coordinates from bregma: 1.0 mm anterior,
0.7 mm lateral, and 4.4 mm ventral with a 10� angle).
After the experiments, the mice were heart perfused with 4% paraformalde-
hyde (PFA), the brain was removed and was post-fixed with 4% PFA at 4�C
overnight. Slices of 100 mm were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT 1000 S)
for immunohistochemistry. Slices were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature
with streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, S11223, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Research Resource Identifier [RRID]: AB_2336881) and analyzed on a
confocal microscope.
In Vitro Optogenetic Stimulation
A detailed description on the in vitro optogenetic stimulation can be found
in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Briefly, light stimulation
(2–20 ms) of individual neurons in the medial septum was carried out via the
microscope objective (Nikon NIR Apo 60) using a galvanometer based scan-
ning system (UGA-40, DL-473, Rapp Optoelectronics) coupled to a 473-nm
diode-pumped solid state laser (DL-473, Rapp Optoelectronics). Stimulation
frequencies ranged from 5 to 30 Hz (five pulses). For light-based stimulation
of the ChR2+ cholinergic septohippocampal axons, we used an identical laser
(473 nm) coupled into a customized multimode light fiber (BF-L22, Thorlabs,
core diameter 550 mm, NA 0.22). The end of the optical fiber was immediately
above the brain slice surface to illuminate the dentate gyrus.
Ca2+ Imaging Experiments
For Ca2+-imaging experiments, 300-mm slices were obtained as described
above. To identify astrocytes, slices were incubated with 0.5 mM SR101 in su-
crose-containing ACSF as described for the dual recording experiments. Sli-
ces were then superfused in a submerged chamber with carbogen-saturated
ACSF as used for patch-clamp in vitro recordings (3 ml/min, 32�C). To load
cells with the Ca2+ indicator Oregon green 488 BAPTA-1, AM (OGB-1-AM,
Life Technologies), we adapted a protocol described previously for acute brain
slices (Garaschuk et al., 2006; Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Imaging was commenced at least 30 min after the dye loading procedure.
To monitor astrocyte activation following optogenetic stimulation, time series
were acquired using two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy using an
ultrafast Ti:Sa laser (810 nm, Chameleon Ultra, Coherent) coupled to a micro-
scope (BX-51, Olympus) equipped with a galvanometer-based scanning sys-
tem (Ultima, Prairie Technologies) and a 203 objective (XLUMPlanFl, NA 0.95,
Olympus). Fluorescence emission was filtered using a 520/20 nm band-pass
filter. Videos were acquired with an average frame rate of �3.32 ± 0.12 Hz
and an average duration of 22.35 ± 0.83 s at 15-min intervals. A reference
image of SR101 fluorescence was taken for each experiment in order to iden-
tify astrocytes.
In some experiments, fast line scans were performed in addition to full-frame
imaging. Line scans across at least one SR101+ astrocyte were placed into the
bulk loaded region and imaged at 371 Hz in the presence of 10 mM CNQX. Data
were smoothed with a boxcar filter of 5. The latency to the transient was
measured as the time from the beginning of the light artifact until the DF/F ex-
ceeded 4*SD of the baseline. The decay was fitted with a monoexponential
curve.
For GCaMP6f imaging in astrocytes, we used AAVs of the 2/5 serotype and
the minimal astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter to express the genetically
encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f in hilar astrocytes, as previously described for
the CA1 region (Srinivasan et al., 2015). Details on virus injection leading to as-
trocytic expression of GCaMP6f can be found in the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures. Imaging experiments were performed in the presence of
40 mM 4-AP and 10 mM CNQX. Regions of interest containing at least one
SR101+, GCamP6f+ astrocyte were placed on in the hilus or adjacent CA3.
Time series were recorded in triplicates at a frame rate of approximately
9 Hz (4–30 Hz) and averaged. To correct for bleaching, an exponential was
fit to individual traces and used as baseline for DF/F calculation. The stimulus
artifact was removed, and data were smoothed with a boxcar of 3.
Imaging data were preprocessed in ImageJ and analyzed using Igor (Wave-
metrics). Videos were registered and translated to the reference image in order
to remove movement artifacts and drift. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manu-
ally placed on SR101 and OGB-1 double-positive somata. Only cells visible
over the course of the entire experiment were included. Raw fluorescence
intensity traces over time of individual cells were extracted and further pro-
cessed using Igor.
To analyze early optogenetically induced transients, traces of individual cells
were normalized to baseline and averaged within conditions. The fraction of re-
sponders was calculated as the fraction of astrocytes showing DF/F increases
greater than the quadruple SD following the stimulus within one frame. Late or
spontaneous astrocyte responses were defined as astrocyte calcium eleva-
tions with slow onset, duration >3 s and magnitude >8% in accordance with
previous descriptions (Araque et al., 2002; Di Castro et al., 2011).
Immunohistochemistry and Neuronal Reconstructions
Animals were anesthetized 4 weeks post virus injection and heart perfused
with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were dissected and
transferred into 4% PFA for fixation overnight at 4�C. 50 mm slices were
made on a vibratome (Leica) and washed with PBS (0.1 M) before they were
incubated with the primary antibodies goat anti-GFP (1:1000, AB5449, Abcam,
RRID: AB_304896) and rabbit anti-ChAT (1:100, AB143, Millipore, RRID:
AB_2079760) overnight at room temperature. Subsequently, they were washed
with PBS and incubated for 2 hr with the secondary antibodies donkey
anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, 705-545-147, Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, RRID: AB_2336933) and donkey anti-rabbit CY3 (1:500,
711-165-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, RRID: AB_2307443).
Stained slices were scanned using inverted confocal microscopes (FluoView
FV1000 Confocal Microscope, Olympus, and Eclipse Ti, Nikon, respectively)
with 10-fold magnification objectives (UPlanSApo, NA 0.4, and CFI Plan Apo
Lambda, NA 0.45, Nikon, respectively). Images were quantified manually using
ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012; RRID:SCR_003070).
For reconstruction of neuron morphology, brain slices were incubated
overnight in 4% PFA after electrophysiological recordings. Fixed brain slices
were washed three times in PBS (0.1 M) and incubated with goat anti-GFP
(1:1000, AB5449, Abcam, RRID: AB_304896) overnight at 4�C. Subsequently,
they were incubated with donkey anti-goat FITC (1:500, 705-095-147, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, RRID: AB_2340401) and streptavidin Alexa
Fluor 555 (1:500, S32355, Thermo Fisher Scientific, RRID: AB_2571525) for
1–2 hr at room temperature. Imaging was carried out using a confocal micro-
scope (Olympus, Fluoview 1000 Dualscan) and z stacks were analyzed using
ImageJ software.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical significance levels were set at p < 0.05. All results are expressed as
SEM if not otherwise stated. Statistical analysis of electrophysiological data
was performed using unpaired and paired t tests.
In some cases, data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
multiple comparison or Bonferroni post hoc test or repeated-measures
ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison as indicated in the text. In vivo
single-unit recordings were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as indicated in the text. Imaging data were analyzed
using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, repeated-measures ANOVA with Dunnett’s
multiple comparison, and paired t test as indicated in the text.
