IMPORTANCE Mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach is more effective than
colonoscopy outreach for increasing 1-time colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, but long-term
effectiveness may need repeat testing and timely follow-up for abnormal results.
OBJECTIVE Compare the effectiveness of FIT outreach and colonoscopy outreach to increase
completion of the CRC screening process (screening initiation and follow-up) within 3 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Pragmatic randomized clinical trial from March 2013 to
July 2016 among 5999 participants aged 50 to 64 years who were receiving primary care in
Parkland Health and Hospital System and were not up to date with CRC screenings.
INTERVENTIONS Random assignment to mailed FIT outreach (n = 2400), mailed colonoscopy
outreach (n = 2400), or usual care with clinic-based screening (n = 1199). Outreach included
processes to promote repeat annual testing for individuals in the FIT outreach group with
normal results and completion of diagnostic and screening colonoscopy for those with an
abnormal FIT result or assigned to colonoscopy outreach.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was screening process completion,
defined as adherence to colonoscopy completion, annual testing for a normal FIT result,
diagnostic colonoscopy for an abnormal FIT result, or treatment evaluation if CRC was
detected. Secondary outcomes included detection of any adenoma or advanced neoplasia
(including CRC) and screening-related harms (including bleeding or perforation).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among persons aged 50 to 64 years receiving primary care at
a safety-net institution, mailed outreach invitations offering FIT or colonoscopy compared
with usual care increased the proportion completing CRC screening process within 3 years.
The rate of screening process completion was higher with colonoscopy than FIT outreach.

olorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
of cancer-related death in the United States. Screen-
ing can reduce CRC incidence and mortality. The US
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gives CRC screening
a grade A recommendation (defined as a recommended ser-
vice because there is high certainty that the net benefit is
substantial) for individuals aged 50 to 75 years.1 However,
effectiveness is limited by underuse and suboptimal adher-
ence to guideline-recommended follow-up, including repeat
testing for normal test results and diagnostic follow-up of
abnormal test results. Studies have demonstrated failures at
each step in the screening process, which are associated with
increased CRC mortality: 30% to 50% of patients do not initi-
ate screening,2,3 40% to 60% of patients with normal results
do not undergo repeat screening,4,5 and more than 50% of
patients with abnormal results do not complete a follow-up
evaluation.6,7
The best strategies to increase screening process comple-
tion are uncertain. Colonoscopy may be accepted by individu-
als seeking tests with high sensitivity and low frequency but
not by those averse to invasive testing requiring bowel prepa-
ration, sedation, and transportation.8 Fecal immunochemi-
cal test (FIT) acceptance may be highest among individuals
seeking at-home testing but lower among those averse to ob-
taining stool samples or performing annual testing.9 In the
United States, most screening is visit-based and dependent on
primary care encounters. Complementing visit-based screen-
ing with mailed outreach invitations increases 1-time screen-
ing among racially diverse and socioeconomically disadvan-
taged populations2; however, most studies of screening
strategies have focused on single steps in the screening pro-
cess, with few comparing their effect on completion of the en-
tire process over time.10-12
One-year results of a pragmatic, randomized comparative
effectiveness trial of FIT outreach, colonoscopy outreach,
and usual care for increasing CRC-screening initiation in a
large safety-net health system were previously reported.13
This study reports a primary outcome comparing FIT out-
reach, colonoscopy outreach, and usual care for increasing
CRC screening process completion (screening initiation and
follow-up) within a 3-year period.
Methods
Study Population
Parkland Health and Hospital System, a publicly funded inte-
grated safety-net health system, includes a 900-bed hospital
and 12 community-based primary care clinics, specialty clin-
ics, and colonoscopy suites. Parkland offers a sliding fee scale
program—Parkland Financial Assistance—providing access to
primary and subspecialty medical care (including CRC screen-
ing, follow-up diagnostic testing, and treatment evaluation)
for uninsured Dallas County residents in Texas.
The study was approved by University of Texas South-
western’
s institutional review board (Supplement 1). For this
pragmatic trial, the University of Texas Southwestern institu-
tional review board deemed a waiver of consent to be ethical
and appropriate because (1) the study was minimal risk be-
cause CRC screening is the standard of care and available to
all persons through usual care, (2) a waiver of consent would
not adversely affect the rights and welfare of participants, (3)
the large-scale trial would not be feasible if informed consent
were required, and (4) conducting a cancer screening trial in
only those consenting to participate would have a large vol-
unteer bias threatening its generalizability and validity as a
population health strategy. Although prior studies demon-
strate the benefits of screening outreach interventions, CRC
screeningformostpersonsintheUnitedStates(includingthose
at Parkland Health and Hospital System) is delivered through
visit-based screening as recommended by clinicians. Partici-
pants in the usual care group would not have had outreach
withheld if Parkland decided to implement an outreach pro-
gram as part of usual care during the study period.
As described previously,13 the population included indi-
viduals aged 50 to 64 years with Parkland Financial Assis-
tance coverage at randomization and a primary care visit
during the year prior to randomization (the trial protocol and
statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1).
Parkland Financial Assistance provides access to CRC
screening with co-payments on a sliding scale basis ranging
from $0 to $50 depending on level of income. Participants
were excluded if they were up to date with screening,
including colonoscopy within 10 years, sigmoidoscopy
within 5 years, or FIT testing within 1 year as ascertained
from Parkland’
s comprehensive electronic health records
(EHRs) that include all test and procedure results done any-
where in the health system. Exclusion criteria included
(1) no contact information; (2) language other than English or
Spanish; (3) history of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease,
polyps, or colectomy; and (4) incarceration.
Random Assignment
Eligible persons were randomly assigned to either the usual
care, FIT outreach, or colonoscopy outreach groups in a
1:2:2 ratio using a computer-generated, simple randomiza-
tion sequence. Participants were blinded to presence of
alternate interventions.
Key Points
Question Which screening strategy is most effective in promoting
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening process completion among
individuals who are not up to date with CRC screening?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 5999
patients who were followed up for 3 years, screening process
completion occurred in 28.0% in the mailed fecal
immunochemical test (FIT) outreach group, 38.4% in the mailed
colonoscopy outreach group, and 10.7% in the usual care group;
the result for each intervention was significantly greater than for
usual care.
Meaning Outreach interventions offering FIT or colonoscopy may
be more effective than usual care in increasing the proportion of
persons who complete the CRC screening process.

 CRC Screening Interventions
Usual care group participants were eligible to receive what-
evervisit-basedscreeningwasrecommendedandordereddur-
ing any in-person outpatient visit. CRC screening test recom-
mendations were at the discretion of clinicians (typically
home-based 3-sample FIT [Hemoccult ICT, Beckman Coulter]
or colonoscopy) (Supplement 2). Parkland clinics had a visit-
based CRC screening EHR reminder that flagged individuals
who were not up to date with screening and had primary care
clinician–level audit and feedback for CRC-screening perfor-
mance. The study protocol did not include additional clini-
cian education, patient education, or decision aids for per-
sons in the usual care group.
Participants in the FIT outreach group received an invita-
tion letter in both English and Spanish with information re-
garding CRC risk, a 1-sample home FIT test kit (OC-Auto
FIT CHEK; Polymedco) with instructions, and a return enve-
lope with prepaid postage every 12 months during the study
period. Using standardized scripts, bilingual research staff
telephoned persons who did not return the FIT kit within 2
weeks. Up to 2 attempts to reach each participant by tele-
phone were made by trying home or cell phone numbers re-
corded in the EHR at different times of the day. Those with ab-
normalFITresults(cutoff,100ng/mL)wereinformedofresults
by research staff within 1 week and referred for colonoscopy.
Participants in the colonoscopy outreach group received
an invitation letter in both English and Spanish with informa-
tionregardingCRCriskandaphonenumbertoscheduleacolo-
noscopy. Using standardized scripts, bilingual research staff
telephoned persons who did not call within 2 weeks. Up to 2
attempts to reach each participant by telephone were made by
trying home or cell phone numbers recorded in the EHR at dif-
ferent times of the day. Participants who called were triaged
to open-access colonoscopy slots or preprocedure clinical re-
view by research staff based on a structured history form. They
were informed colonoscopy may require a co-payment rang-
ing from $0 to $50 depending on income level. If interested,
the procedure was scheduled, and research staff mailed a free
bowel prep kit (Gatorade [PepsiCo] and polyethylene glycol
3350)andpreprocedureinstructions.Researchstaffcalledpar-
ticipants10daysand2dayspriortocolonoscopytoreviewprep
instructions and address preprocedural questions. Partici-
pants who did not complete colonoscopy on the basis of EHR
data (eTable in Supplement 2) in the Parkland health system
received repeat invitation letters each year.
Participants in the outreach groups were eligible for visit-
based screening through usual care. Although clinicians may
have been aware of the pragmatic trial, they had no knowl-
edge of group assignment unless the participant shared the let-
ter with his or her clinician.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome—screening process completion within
3years—wasdefinedas(1)colonoscopycompletedwithnocan-
cer detected; (2) cancer detected by colonoscopy and treat-
mentevaluationcompletedwithin2orfewermonths;(3)anor-
malFITresultrepeatedannuallyfor3years(ie,every12months
anchored on randomization date); (4) an abnormal FIT result
with colonoscopy completed within 6 or fewer months with
no cancer detected; or (5) an abnormal FIT result with cancer
detected by colonoscopy and treatment evaluation com-
pleted within 2 or fewer months.12 All participants were ran-
domized in year 1 (March 2013-January 2014) and followed up
throughJuly2016forscreeningreceipt.Theoriginalstudyout-
come was screening process completion within 40 months.
However,theinstitutionalreviewboardprotocolwasamended
in June 2016 to terminate follow-up in July 2016 because
Parkland Hospital and its central laboratory were scheduled
to close down and move into a new facility. This change would
have prevented protocol-specified timely processing and re-
porting of mailed FIT kits. To maintain the fidelity of the in-
tervention and subsequent comparisons of comparative ef-
fectiveness, follow-up time was reduced for outcome
ascertainment (Supplement 2). After the modification, the pri-
marystudyoutcometimeframewasmodifiedtowithin3years,
and actual follow-up time for participants ranged from 30 to
40 months depending on the initial screening invite wave.
Colonoscopies with poor prep or without cecal intuba-
tion are insufficient and thus were not considered toward
screening process completion, nor were FITs that could not be
processed (eg, too old or an inadequate specimen). Tests com-
pleted as a result of outreach as well as those completed
through usual care for any indication were included. Sociode-
mographics, clinical characteristics, and study outcomes were
ascertained from Parkland’
s EHRs, as was screening partici-
pation (ie, both test orders and results). Race/ethnicity in the
EHR was based on self-report at the time of initial patient reg-
istration and categorized as non-Hispanic white, black, His-
panic white, Asian, or other. This data was included to help de-
scribe the study population. Race/ethnicity was included
because of the higher CRC incidence and lower screening rates
in racial/ethnic minorities.
Secondary outcomes, defined a priori, included (1) pro-
portionsofparticipantswithanyadenomasandadvancedneo-
plasia and (2) screening harms, including perforation or post-
colonoscopy bleeding. Polyp histology was determined from
pathology records, with interpretations performed by gastro-
intestinal-trained pathologists through routine care. Ad-
vanced neoplasia was defined as adenomas larger than 1 cm,
sessile serrated adenomas, adenomas containing high-grade
dysplasia or villous histology, or invasive CRC. Presence of ad-
enomas and advanced neoplasia were determined using EHR
data; CRC cases were confirmed to not be missed by EHR data
bycheckingstateregistrydata.Cost-effectivenessofeachstrat-

Three post hoc secondary analyses were performed using
more-liberaldefinitionsofscreeningprocesscompletion.First,
an analysis was performed comparing screening process
completion among participants screened through outreach ef-
forts. Second, screening completion was defined using bien-
nial FIT in years 1 and 3 or years 1 and 2, as recommended in
Europe,14 for those with negative results. Participants with ab-
normal FIT results were still required to undergo colonos-
copy within 6 months. Third, comparison of receipt of any
screening (≥1 FIT or colonoscopy) over the 3-year period was

 performed. A post hoc descriptive analysis of process failures
was performed at each step in the screening process.
Statistical Analysis
The Pearson χ2 test was used to compare screening process
completion, screening process failures, and screening out-
comes (eg, number of adenomas) between groups. Sample
size calculations were determined a priori to compare
screening process completion across groups. As described in
Supplement 2, assumptions for proportions completing each
step of the screening process were based on available medi-
cal literature (eReferences 1-12 in Supplement 2). Under
these assumptions, the predicted screening process comple-
tion rates were 16.6% and 13.5% for the outreach groups,
yielding a difference of 3.1%. Although no prior studies com-
pared FIT and colonoscopy outreach with the outcome of
screening process completion, prior studies of successful
CRC screening interventions report differences in screening
rates exceeding 3.1%.15 With 2400 persons assigned to the
FIT outreach group and 2400 to the colonoscopy outreach
group, an estimated 80% power was needed to detect
between-group differences of at least 3.1% in screening pro-
cess completion, assuming screening process completions of
13.5% for colonoscopy outreach and 16.6% for FIT outreach
and a prespecified 2-sided α of .05. After Bonferroni cor-
rection to adjust for comparisons between the 3 groups,
an estimated 67% power was needed to detect a difference
in screening process completion proportions between the
2 intervention groups and more than 95% power to detect
differences between both intervention groups and the usual
care group at a 2-sided significance level of .017 (Supple-
ment 2). Participants without any subsequent visits at
Parkland Health and Hospital System were labeled as lost to
follow-up but retained in all analyses, consistent with the
plan for an intention-to-screen analysis. Missing data were
rare and reported as unknown. An intention-to-screen prin-
ciple guided analyses, which were conducted with SAS
(SAS Institute), version 9.4.
Results
Study Population
Of 5999 individuals eligible for inclusion (median age, 56
years; women, 62%), 2400 were assigned to the FIT out-
reach group, 2400 to the colonoscopy outreach group, and
1199 to the usual care group (Figure 1 and Table 1). Partici-
pants were Hispanic (49%), black (24%), white (22%), and
had unknown race/ethnicity (0.6%). Of the randomized par-
ticipants, 39% preferred the Spanish language, 7.0% had a
Charlson comorbidity score higher than 2, and all had 1 or
more primary care visit the year prior to randomization
(nearly one-third had >3 visits). Less than 2% received gas-
trointestinal subspecialty care the year before or after ran-
dom assignment.
Primary Outcome
Screening process completion was achieved in 38.4% (95%
CI, 36.5% to 40.4%) of participants in the colonoscopy out-
reach group, 28.0% (95% CI, 26.2% to 29.8%) in the FIT
outreach group, and 10.7% (95% CI, 9.1% to 12.6%) in the
usual care group (Table 2). Compared with the usual care

Secondary Outcomes
Adenoma and advanced neoplasia detection rates differed by
study group (Table 3). Adenomas were detected in 344 par-
ticipants(14.3%)inthecolonoscopyoutreachgroup,128(5.3%)
in the FIT outreach group, and 48 (4.0%) in the usual care
group. Advanced neoplasia was detected in 105 participants
(4.4%) in the colonoscopy outreach group, 49 (2.0%) in the FIT
outreach group, and 16 (1.3%) in the usual care group. Com-
pared with the usual care group, detection rates were 10.3%
(95% CI, 9.5% to 12.1%) higher for adenoma and 3.1% (95% CI,
2.0% to 4.1%) higher for advanced neoplasia in the colonos-
copyoutreachgroup(P < .001forboth)and1.3%(95%CI,−0.1%
to 2.8%) higher for adenoma and 0.7% (95% CI, −0.2% to 1.6%)
higher for advanced neoplasia in the FIT outreach group
(P = .08andP = .13,respectively).Thedifferencesbetweenout-

and 2.4% (95% CI, 1.3% to 3.3%) for advanced neoplasia
(P < .001forboth).Amongparticipantswithanyscreening,the

were not any screening-related harms in any group.
In a post hoc analysis only including participants
screened through outreach efforts, screening process
completion was 15.4% (95% CI, 12.8% to 18.0%) higher for
the colonoscopy outreach group than the FIT outreach
group (33.7% for the colonoscopy outreach group vs 18.3%
for the FIT outreach group, P < .001). Of those who com-
pleted the screening process, only 1.0% (n = 9) in the colo-
noscopy outreach group completed an annual usual care
FIT, whereas 33.1% (n = 222) in the FIT outreach group
instead completed colonoscopy via usual care.
In post hoc analyses with less-stringent definitions for
screening process completion, the colonoscopy outreach
group had 0.5% (95% CI, −2.2% to 3.4%) lower screening
process completion than the FIT outreach group if requiring
biennial FIT (41.0% for the colonoscopy outreach group vs
41.5% the FIT outreach group, P = .68). Any screening
receipt over the study period was intermediate (51.7% [95%
CI, 49.7% to 53.7%]) in the colonoscopy outreach group;
highest (65.0% [95% CI, 63.0% to 66.8%]) in the FIT out-
reach group and lowest (39.0% [95% CI, 36.2% to 41.7%]) in
the usual care group.
Screening Process Failures
There were screening process failures at multiple steps in
the screening process in each group (Figure 2). In the colo-
noscopy outreach group, nearly half of the participants
(n = 1056; 44.0%) did not initiate screening, 27 (1.1%) had
incomplete colonoscopy without cecal intubation, 23 (1.0%)
had inadequate prep quality, and 18 (0.8%) had both incom-
plete colonoscopy and inadequate prep quality. Among par-
ticipants in the colonoscopy outreach group who opted for
FIT via usual care, 319 only underwent intermittent FIT
(with 250 undergoing 1 FIT and 69 undergoing FIT in only 2
of 3 years). Among 54 participants with an abnormal FIT
result, 35 (64.8%) did not have a timely follow-up colonos-
copy (22 underwent colonoscopy after 6 months, 12 did not
undergo colonoscopy, and 1 had an inadequate colonoscopy
due to a lack of cecal intubation). All participants in the colo-
noscopy outreach group who were found to have CRC
(n = 10) had a timely treatment evaluation.
Among participants assigned to the FIT outreach group,
724 (30.2%) did not initiate screening. More than one-third
(n = 888; 37.0%) of participants only underwent intermittent
FIT (522 had 1 FIT and 366 had FIT in only 2 of 3 years).
Among 162 participants with an abnormal FIT result, 108
(66.7%) did not have a timely follow-up colonoscopy (17
underwent colonoscopy after 6 months, 83 did not undergo
colonoscopy, and 8 had inadequate colonoscopies due to a
lack of cecal intubation or inadequate prep quality). Of par-
ticipants in the FIT outreach group who opted for colonos-
copy via usual care, 2 were incomplete without cecal intuba-
tion and 7 had inadequate prep quality. All participants in
the FIT outreach group who were found to have CRC (n = 7)
had a timely treatment evaluation.
Among participants in the usual care group, 697 (58.1%)
did not initiate screening, 4 (0.3%) underwent colonoscopy
without cecal intubation, and 7 (0.6%) had inadequate prep
quality. There were 339 (28.3%) participants who only
underwent intermittent FIT screening, and among the 30
participants with an abnormal FIT result, 24 (80%) did not
have a timely follow-up colonoscopy (10 underwent colo-
noscopy after 6 months and 14 did not undergo colonos-
copy). All 3 usual care participants (0.3%) with CRC had a
timely treatment evaluation.
Discussion
In this pragmatic randomized clinical trial among adults aged
50 to 64 years who were receiving primary care in an urban
safety-net health system, both mailed outreach interven-
tions encouraging FIT and encouraging colonoscopy in-
creased the proportion of individuals who completed the CRC
screening process within 3 years compared with usual care.
Colonoscopy outreach was more effective than FIT outreach
for screening process completion, from screening initiation to
repeat screening and diagnostic evaluation. However, screen-
ing process completion for both outreach groups remained be-
low 40%, highlighting the potential for further improve-
ment.Higherscreeningprocesscompletionamongparticipants
in the colonoscopy outreach group translated to higher ad-
enoma and advanced neoplasia detection, although there was
no difference in cancer detection.
Although the primary outcome of screening process
completion is a more rigorous and clinically important out-
come than 1-time screening, it remains an imperfect surro-
gate for reduced mortality—the ultimate goal of cancer
screening. There was a higher proportion of adenomas and
advanced neoplasia in the colonoscopy outreach group;
however, the trial was not powered to evaluate differences

 in early CRC detection. The CONFIRM16 and COLONPREV17
trials are ongoing multicenter studies comparing colonos-
copy and FIT for early CRC detection and mortality, but they
are years away from reporting. In the absence of data on
long-term outcomes for FIT-based vs colonoscopy-based
screening strategies, these results suggest colonoscopy out-
reach may be particularly effective for promoting screening
process completion in health systems with sufficient endo-
scopic capacity.
Although studies suggest FIT invitations are more effec-
tive than colonoscopy outreach for 1-time screening,3,18 par-
ticipants in this study who were offered colonoscopy out-
reach had higher screening process completion and adenoma
detection when followed for a longer duration. FIT has lower
barriers to 1-time participation19,20 but requires annual screen-
ing and diagnostic evaluation of abnormal results. In con-
trast, colonoscopy is both a screening and diagnostic test, so
a single examination can satisfy screening process comple-
tion for up to 10 years. Although colonoscopy outreach was the
most-effective outreach strategy, this may not be scalable to
larger at-risk populations within health systems due to finite
endoscopiccapacity,18,21greatercosts,andpotentialprocedure-
related complications.22,23 Although the study’
s follow-up pe-
riod was longer than most studies, it was not sufficient to de-
termine whether participants who had adenomas removed
underwent appropriate follow-up surveillance examina-
tions. Similarly, FIT outreach may not be scalable in all health
systems due to costs.
Although the outreach strategies increased screening
process completion compared with usual care, screening
completion remained below 40% in both outreach groups.
The types of screening process failures at each step differed
by test. Although nearly half of the participants in the colo-
noscopy outreach group did not initiate screening, there
were minimal downstream process failures among partici-
pants who did. Fewer participants undergoing colonoscopy
may complete the screening process when considering lon-
ger periods because 3-year and 5-year surveillance colonos-
copies would be required for those with higher-risk polyps.
Prior studies show underuse of surveillance colonoscopy in
up to 50% of eligible patients.24-26 In contrast, nearly 70% of
participants in the FIT outreach group initiated screening
but over one-third did not undergo repeat screening despite
free annual mailed kits. Two-thirds of participants in the FIT
outreach group also did not undergo diagnostic evaluation
after abnormal FIT results. These data are consistent with
prior studies demonstrating prevalent screening process fail-
ures, with 25% to 70% of patients who complete the initial
FIT not undergoing repeat testing and 20% to 50% of those
with an abnormal FIT result not receiving timely diagnostic
evaluation.4-6,27-29 However, follow-up of abnormal FITs in
this study was at the lower end of the spectrum, highlighting
the need to address these screening process failures to
improve FIT effectiveness.
These data can help clinicians weigh the pros and cons of
different CRC screening strategies in their patient population
and practice environment. It is important to consider
patients’barriers to screening initiation when recommending
colonoscopy and the need for annual screening or diagnostic
colonoscopy when recommending FIT. From the health
system perspective, data on screening process failures can
help identify intervention targets to improve screening
effectiveness. Initiating colonoscopy screening may be
improved by patient-level (transportation assistance) or
system-level (reducing co-payment costs) interventions.30-32
Studies have demonstrated patient-level (education) and
system-level (automated reminders) interventions can
improve repeat FIT completion.10,33 Moreover, these data can
inform simulation studies comparing colonoscopy and FIT as
system-level screening strategies. A decision analysis con-
ducted by the USPSTF concluded annual FIT provides similar
life-years gained as colonoscopy every 10 years, but this
assumed 100% adherence with screening and diagnostic
evaluation for strategies, so more-nuanced modeling studies
are needed.34
Although both outreach strategies significantly in-
creased screening completion compared with usual care,
screening process completion remained below 40% in both
groups.Thirty-threepercentofparticipantsassignedtotheFIT
outreach group who completed the screening process did so
via usual care colonoscopy, which suggests providing a choice
of screening modalities and shared decision making may be
an effective strategy.35-37 Inadomi and colleagues38 found that
providing patients a choice of screening modality increased
screening participation, although not statistically signifi-
cant, compared with only offering a fecal occult blood test.
However, participation in the study required consent, poten-
tially selecting for those interested in CRC screening and in-
troducing volunteer bias, so it is possible providing choice
would have greater effect in a pragmatic trial setting.
This study has several strengths including its large sample
size, racially and socioeconomically diverse patient popula-
tion, pragmatic study design avoiding volunteer bias, and in-
novation comparing colonoscopy vs FIT outreach to promote
screening process completion over several years.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, because this was a
pragmatic trial, mailed invitations were simple, 1-page let-
ters and not in-depth decision aids. Second, the trial
included reserved colonoscopy appointment slots, which
may not be feasible if scaled to larger at-risk populations.
However, the number of slots for colonoscopies were desig-
nated to mirror waiting times for usual care participants
(median time from order to colonoscopy appointment, 106
days for colonoscopy outreach patients vs 101 days for usual
care patients). Third, participants could have received
screening at outside institutions, although this is highly
unlikely because nearly all of the participants’insurance
arrangements only covered care within the safety-net
health system and these low-income individuals would be
very unlikely to pay out of pocket for cancer screening done
elsewhere. Fourth, the low absolute rates of screening may
be partly explained by participants’ beliefs about CRC
screening, moving, not following-up at Parkland, or having
contraindications to screening, which may be underrecog-

 nized given the pragmatic design of the trial. Fifth, differ-
ences in adenoma and advanced neoplasia detection were
partly driven by low proportions of diagnostic colonoscopy
after an abnormal FIT result but reflect challenges associ-
ated with screening with noninvasive tests such as FIT.
Sixth, colonoscopy indication could not be ascertained so
some colonoscopies in each group may have been diagnos-
tic. In addition, the study was not powered to detect differ-
ences in CRC detection or mortality.
Conclusions
Among persons aged 50 to 64 years receiving primary care at
a safety-net institution, mailed outreach invitations offering
FIT or colonoscopy compared with usual care increased the
proportion completing CRC screening process within 3 years.
