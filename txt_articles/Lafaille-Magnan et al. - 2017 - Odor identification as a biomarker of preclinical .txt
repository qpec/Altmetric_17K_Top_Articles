Odor identification as a biomarker
of preclinical AD in older adults
at risk
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess odor identification (OI) as an indicator of presymptomatic Alzheimer disease
(AD) pathogenesis in cognitively normal aging individuals at increased risk of AD dementia.
Methods: In 274 members of the PREVENT-AD cohort of healthy aging persons with a parental or
multiple-sibling history of AD dementia, we assessed the cross-sectional association of OI with
potential indicators of presymptomatic AD. Some 101 participants donated CSF, thus enabling
assessment of AD pathology with the biomarkers total tau (t-tau), phospho-tau (P181-tau), and
their ratios with b-amyloid (Ab1-42). Adjusted analyses considered age, cognition, APOE e4 sta-
tus, education, and sex as covariates. We measured OI using the University of Pennsylvania Smell
Identification Test and cognitive performance using the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of
Neuropsychological Status. Standard kits provided assays of the AD biomarkers. Analyses used
robust-fit linear regression models.
Results: Reduced OI was associated with lower cognitive score and older age, as well as increased
ratios of CSF t-tau and P181-tau to Ab1-42 (all p , 0.02). However, the observed associations of
OI with age and cognition were unapparent in adjusted models that restricted observations to
CSF donors and included AD biomarkers. OI showed little association with CSF Ab1-42 alone
except in APOE e4 carriers having lowest-quartile Ab1-42 levels.
Conclusions: These findings from healthy high-risk older individuals suggest that OI reflects
degree of preclinical AD pathology, while its relationships with age and cognition result from
the association of these latter variables with such pathology. Diminished OI may be a practical
and affordable biomarker of AD pathology. Neurology® 2017;89:327–335

Prevention of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia can be accomplished by retarding the progres-
sion of the disease in its presymptomatic stages, thus postponing the onset of clinical symptoms.
Hence, research on the identification and development of AD preventives can be aided by quan-
titative measures of disease progression before symptom onset.1 Such presymptomatic disease
progress may be revealed by subtle cognitive changes, various MRI or PET imaging techniques,
or AD biomarkers in the CSF. These measures are generally inconvenient, and more accessible
markers of preclinical AD pathology are needed.
Because rhinencephalic brain regions are especially vulnerable to AD pathology,2 a candidate
marker for this purpose may be odor identification (OI), i.e., the ability to identify and name
specific odorants.3–10 Like cognition, OI is known to be impaired in both aging11,12 and

In
longitudinal
studies,
reduced OI performance predicts faster cogni-
tive decline in elderly controls and persons
with mild cognitive impairment or AD
dementia.5,8–10,15–17
Finally,
an
important
study of cognitively healthy persons showed
that reduced OI ability predicted postmortem
AD pathology.5
We therefore sought to evaluate OI as
a measure of presymptomatic AD pathogene-
sis. In a study of aging asymptomatic individ-
uals at risk of AD dementia, we investigated
the association between OI and recognized
in vivo AD biomarkers such as CSF total tau
(t-tau) and phospho-tau (P181-tau) and their
ratio with Alzheimer b-amyloid (Ab1-42). We
hypothesized that degree of impairment in OI
would predict biomarker evidence of AD
neuropathology.
METHODS The PREVENT-AD cohort. We investigated
cross-sectional baseline measures from 274 participants in
a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals assembled for
Presymptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treat-
ments for Alzheimer’s Disease (PREVENT-AD).1 PREVENT-
AD enrollees had a parent or multiple siblings with a history of
AD-like dementia. They were $60 years of age, except that
individuals 55 to 59 years old were eligible if their current age
was within 15 years of dementia onset in their youngest-affected
relative. In general, persons with a first-degree family history
have an elevated risk of AD.18 We first screened their cognitive
state using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment19 and the
Clinical Dementia Rating scale.20 Individuals with questionable
cognitive difficulties underwent a formal neuropsychological
assessment. We analyzed data collected between September
2011 and August 2015 and archived in PREVENT-AD data
release 2.0.
Nested within PREVENT-AD was a randomized trial of
Impact of Naproxen Treatment on Presymptomatic Alzheimer’s
Disease (INTREPAD), a placebo-controlled, biomarker-end-
point prevention trial of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
naproxen in 184 participants. We obtained CSF data from a sub-
set of 101 volunteers from that trial.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Written informed consent was obtained at each
stage of the research from all participants and their collateral
partners. Protocols and French and English consent forms
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
McGill University Faculty of Medicine. INTREPAD is regis-
tered with clinicatrials.gov as NCT02702817. The research
was conducted in compliance with the ethics principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. For additional information, see www.
prevent-alzheimer.ca.
Methods of assessment. Review of health and neurocognitive
status. Participants were evaluated while accompanied by an
informant. Assessments included a health history and review
of systems, a standardized neurologic examination, and a cog-
nitive examination with version A of the Repeatable Battery
for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).21
The RBANS is available in both English and Canadian
French. It measures 5 domains of cognitive performance. Par-
ticipants also underwent phlebotomy for routine laboratory
tests and banking of plasma and a multimodal MRI/fMRI
scan session.
CSF collection. INTREPAD volunteers’ lumbar punctures
were performed in the morning after an overnight fast. CSF was
collected with the Sprotte 24-gauge atraumatic needle. The time
of collection was recorded. All procedures followed recom-
mendations of the BiomarkAPD project in the EU Joint Pro-
gramme in Neurodegeneration.22 Briefly, CSF was centrifuged at
3,000 RPM (2,000g) at room temperature to precipitate cells and
other insoluble material. Within 4 hours of collection, CSF
samples were frozen and stored in 0.4-mL aliquots at 2808C in
500 mL polypropylene cryotubes. The samples went through
only one freeze-thaw cycle. We assayed CSF t-tau, P181-tau, and
Ab1-42 levels using the Innotest/Fujirebio (previously In-
nogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) ELISA kit, again following Joint
Programme in Neurodegeneration–specified procedures. This
technology is based on specific fluorescent antibody labeling. We
used the biomarker ratios CSF t-tau/Ab1-42 and P181-tau/Ab1-42
to indicate disease state.
APOE genotyping. DNA was extracted automatically from
buffy coat samples with the QiaSymphony DNA mini kit
(Qiagen, Toronto, ON, Canada). APOE genotype was deter-
mined with the PyroMark Q96 pyrosequencer (Qiagen). The
DNA was amplified using reverse transcriptase–PCR, forward
primers 59-ACGGCTGTCCAAGGAGCTG-39 (rs429358)
and
59-CTCCGCGATGCCGATGAC-39
(rs7412),
and
reverse biotinylated primers 59-CACCTCGCCGCGGTACTG-39
(rs429358) and 59-CCCCGGCCTGGTACACTG-39 (rs7412).
The DNA was sequenced with these primers: 59-CGGA-
CATGGAGGACG-39 (rs429358) and 59-CGATGACCTGCA-
GAAG-39 (rs7412).
Odor identification. We assessed OI abilities using the
40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test
(UPSIT).23 This test includes a simple scratch-and-sniff booklet
along with multiple-choice response forms for OI. The UPSIT
has been validated in people 5 to 85 years of age and shows
a test-retest reliability of r 5 0.92 to 0.95.24,25 Its score is computed
as the sum of the correct responses of a maximum possible 40. Both
francophone and anglophone participants were presented with
odors from the US version of the UPSIT. The francophone test
used an in-house French translation. In a leave-one-out analysis, we
assessed the reliability of the UPSIT in the PREVENT-AD cohort
among an initial sample of 159 participants, obtaining a Cronbach
a of 0.821, which suggests high internal consistency.
Data analyses. To avoid left skewness and a leptokurtic distri-
bution, we transformed the raw OI scores to an UPSIT error
score of log10 (41 2 raw UPSIT score), as described by Moberg
et al.26 Higher transformed scores thus represented greater def-
icit in OI. We used a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare scores in
APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers. To assess the main effects on
OI of various indicators of interest, we first examined bivariate
relationships using simple linear regression. To examine the
effect of each predictor variable in full perspective, we then
constructed multivariable models, iteratively adding measures
individually or in combination. Both the bivariate and multi-
variable analyses used robust-fit linear regression with a tuning
constant of 1.205 to down-weight outliers. The latter general
linear model analyses considered, in various combinations, age,
sex, years of education, APOE e4 carrier status, RBANS total
score (global cognition), and the CSF t-tau/Ab1-42 ratio

 (sometimes substituted as specified below by other CSF in-
dicators of AD pathogenesis). Adjusting for age, sex, years of
education, and APOE e4 carrier status enabled us to compare
our work to other highly cited findings.5,6 We verified the
absence of collinearity in the multivariable models by investi-
gating the variance inflation factor and tolerance. To test our
primary hypothesis, we explored the relationships between OI
and CSF AD biomarkers, seeking identifiable subgroups and
examining interaction terms of interest.
Two sensitivity analyses assessed the effects of potential con-
founders on olfactory function. For both analyses, we grouped
available data on brain injury, TIA, and stroke into a binary cat-
egorical variable called brain health. A second binary variable
grouped nasal polyps, nasal surgeries, deviated septum, and his-
tory of a broken nose. A third such variable identified participants
with a history of asthma, and a fourth identified current smokers
of any substance. A final potential confounder characterized par-
ticipants with any of the foregoing conditions (past or present)
mentioned only at the time of olfactory testing. The first sensitiv-
ity analysis added all 5 of these potential confounders as covariates
in the analytic framework of model 7. The other was a version of
model 7 that excluded data from all participants with a positive
rating on any of the 5 potential confounding variables.
RESULTS Of the 274 PREVENT-AD participants
who met inclusion and exclusion criteria, 1 individual
who consented for a lumbar puncture did not consent
to the OI test. RBANS test results were lost for 4
participants. We excluded data from 8 participants
who had incomplete test scores or nasal congestion on
the day of testing. The analytic sample then com-
prised 265 PREVENT-AD participants, including
100 INTREPAD lumbar puncture volunteers who
had complete CSF biomarker and OI data. The
participant pool included predominantly franco-
phone and female individuals who were well edu-
cated. As expected, their proportion of APOE e4
carriers was higher than population norms (table 1).

 collected CSF were slightly younger than other IN-
TREPAD participants and had a higher proportion of
francophone individuals and slightly lower Montreal
Cognitive Assessment scores. The CSF donors ap-
peared
demographically
similar
to
the
entire
PREVENT-AD group of 274 PREVENT-AD en-
rollees (table 1 and table e-1 at Neurology.org).
In bivariate modeling, the UPSIT error score was
higher in older participants (n 5 265, b 5 0.0134,
p 5 2.24 31026; figure e-1) and in participants with
lower RBANS total score (n 5 261, b 5 20.00666,
p 5 1.28 31026; figure e-1). However, because we
were interested especially in the CSF AD biomarker
data, we also evaluated models restricted to the 100
participants who had both OI and CSF data. In the
reduced sample, the statistical association with older
age was seen only at a trend level (b 5 6.79 31023,
p 5 0.095; figure e-2), but the association of reduced
OI with decreased cognition remained robust (b 5
24.76 31023, p 5 0.011; figure e-2). Similar unad-
justed analyses showed strong association between
higher UPSIT error score and increased values of
CSF t-tau/Ab1-42 (b 5 0.286, p 5 4.94 31023),
P181-tau/Ab1-42 (b 5 1.77, p 5 0.0165), and CSF
t-tau levels (b 5 3.61 31024, p 5 0.0257; figure 1).
There was a weaker but still suggestive relationship
between increased UPSIT error score and elevated
CSF P181-tau (b 5 2.10 31023, p 5 0.0724) but
no relationship with Ab1-42 alone (b 5 27.01 3
1025, p 5 0.359).
We observed no group difference in OI between
APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers (n 5 262, p 5
0.271). A similar result was observed in the reduced
sample of 100 participants with CSF (p 5 0.7129).

 However, previously observed correlations between
UPSIT error score and several CSF markers of AD
pathology were now apparent only in e4 carriers. In
contrast to unstratified samples, the carriers showed
an association between higher UPSIT error scores and
reduced levels of Ab1-42 (n 5 33, b 5 23.76 31024,
p 5 0.00841). In keeping with previously noted find-
ings, UPSIT error score was associated in the e4 car-
riers with higher t-tau/Ab1-42 (b 5 0.352, p 5
0.0158) and P181-tau/Ab1-42 (b 5 2.416, p 5
0.0270), but a comparable association appeared only
at a trend level for t-tau (b 5 4.68 31024, p 5
0.0914) and not at all for P181-tau (b 5 2.76
31023, p 5 0.204; figure 2). In addition, we saw
that individuals with lowest CSF Ab1-42 levels ap-
peared to have a higher proportion of APOE e4 car-
riers (supplemental materials).
The multiple linear regression models assessed the
relationships between OI and age, cognition, and
CSF
biomarkers
added
sequentially
in
models
adjusted for sex, education, and APOE e4 carrier sta-
tus. Multivariable models from the full PREVENT-
AD dataset (without CSF variables) showed strong
associations of UPSIT error score with age and dimin-
ished cognition, either alone or in combination (table
e-2). Table 2 shows comparable analyses in the
reduced sample, now including CSF data. Models
1, 2, and 3 in table 2 (supplemental materials) indi-
cate no association of UPSIT error score with age,
a trend with cognitive score (p 5 0.06), but a strong
association with CSF t-tau/Ab1-42 (p 5 0.003).
Model 4 suggests that the trend association with cog-
nition was unapparent after adjustment for age (p 5
0.145). Model 5 confirms the absence (in adjusted
models) of any association between OI and age, and it
shows the absence of a material effect of age adjust-
ment on the association of OI with CSF t-tau/Ab1-42.
Model 6 indicates that any association of OI with
cognition became unapparent after the inclusion of
CSF t-tau/Ab1-42 (RBANS, p 5 0.151; CSF t-tau/
Ab1-42, p 5 0.004). Model 7, which includes all the
described variables, made these findings clearer by
suggesting that OI was predicted by its relationship
with CSF t-tau/Ab1-42 (p 5 0.005) regardless of age,
cognition, APOE e4 status, sex, or education (figure
e-3). This last model explained 19.7% of the variance
in OI score (F7,90 5 3.68, p , 0.00258). Both sen-
sitivity analysis variants of model 7 produced nearly
identical results (in the first analysis, F12,85 5 2.47, p
, 0.00993; in the second, F7,83 5 2.59, p ,
0.0236). The latter reduced model still explained
15.9% of the variance in OI score. Other similar
multiple linear regression analyses (not shown) essen-
tially reproduced the findings of model 7, substituting
t-tau or P181-tau alone or the ratio of P181-tau/Ab1-42
as independent CSF biomarker predictors.
DISCUSSION We investigated relationships of per-
formance in OI with global cognitive scores, estab-
lished AD risk factors, and several CSF biomarkers
known to predict subsequent dementia. Our main
finding was that a decrease in OI was associated with
increasing CSF biomarker evidence of AD pathology.
This association survived adjustment not only for sex,
educational attainment, APOE e4 carrier status, and
potential brain and olfactory health history confound-
ers but also for age or cognitive score. The relation-
ships of OI performance with age and cognitive
ability recapitulate earlier findings.11,12 In the present
sample, however, the relationship of OI with cogni-
tive performance appears to be spurious because it
represents the conjoint (confounded) relationship of
both variables with the CSF biomarkers. We suggest
that the relationship between OI and age (observed in

This table looks at combinations of age, RBANS, and CSF t-tau/Ab1-42 as predictors of odor identification. All models are adjusted for APOE e4 carrier
status, sex, and education. Because of different metrics used to measure the several variables, the various coefficients are not commensurable, but the
indicated p values show the importance of individual variables in the overall model.

 the full dataset) may similarly represent a confounded
association of these 2 measures with AD pathology
(hence with related impairment in OI). To the best of
our knowledge, there has been no previous direct
demonstration that the association of OI with cogni-
tion is driven by a confounded relationship of both
variables with AD pathology.
Overall, we observed no correlation of OI with
CSF Ab1-42 levels alone. Such a relationship was
observed, however, among individuals whose CSF
Ab1-42 levels were in the lowest quartile. This sub-
group had a greater proportion of APOE e4 carriers
(48%), which was close to the proportion typically
seen in patients with AD. Thus, impairment in OI
may in fact reflect cerebral accumulation of Ab in
these sicker participants, consistent with observations
with amyloid PET.6 This notion was reinforced in
our work by a statistically significant interaction
between APOE e4 carrier status and CSF Ab1-42 lev-
els as predictors of OI performance. The same was
not so for global cognition, suggesting that OI may be
an earlier indicator of accumulated pathology before
symptom onset. Related recent work in transgenic
mice expressing human APOE e4 vs e3 demon-
strated genotype-specific structural differences in
midlife. These modifications appear to precede later
functional differences and increasing structural abnor-
mality in brain regions related to olfaction.27
More generally, OI deficit is associated with pre-
symptomatic AD pathology.5 Reduced structural
integrity of brain regions that subserve olfaction ap-
pears especially vulnerable to such pathology. These
changes include reduced entorhinal cortical thickness
and hippocampus and amygdala volumes,6,16,28 as well
as fibrillar amyloid accumulation in the posterior cin-
gulate, temporoparietal, and lingual cortical regions.6,29
Data from 15O-H2O-PET experiments on olfactory-
evoked regional cerebral blood flow also demonstrate
that patients with AD have a pattern of functional
activation different from healthy controls. Specifically,
regional cerebral blood flow in the right frontotempo-
ral area shows a correlation with OI.30 CSF clearance is
reduced in AD, relating to increased amyloid accumu-
lation. Finally, dynamic monitoring of CSF has con-
firmed that the fluid reaches the nasal turbinates and
clears through the cribriform plate.31
We note that our findings appear to contradict
one recent report in which OI appeared not to be
related to brain accumulation of amyloid as revealed
by PET.32 As we did, the authors of that study at-
tempted to control for known detrimental olfactory
health issues. They chose to exclude participants with
such issues. In addition, the earlier research was char-
acterized by intervals ranging up to 5 years between
tests of OI and PET scans, whereas our work consis-
tently tested OI within 3 months of CSF collection. A
recent study demonstrated that OI deficits are more
readily detected in patients with acute brain trauma
when olfactory testing is performed within days of
injury.33 Recent PET studies of olfactory sensory neu-
rons in lesioned, aging, or AD-like animal models
further support this point.34
Limitations of this study include its high propor-
tion of women and participants’ level of educational
attainment, attributes that are common in aging vol-
unteer cohorts. Although we attempted to control for
these factors in multivariable models, participants who
volunteered for lumbar punctures may be an even
more select population, an important concern because
these 100 participants produced our most informative
findings. Because our results come from cross-sectional
observations only, it remains unknown whether altered
biomarker levels represent a process of ongoing change
and, if so, the rate at which such change is accumulat-
ing. Longitudinal studies for this purpose are now in
progress, as are studies assessing the physical accumu-
lation of amyloid and tau with specific PET tracers.
Lastly, we acknowledge that our failure to observe
a relationship between OI and age in the restricted
sample may result from the limited sample size of
the CSF donor participant pool. Generally, age is re-
ported to be the strongest known predictor of impaired
OI35,36 and the best known predictor of AD dementia.
However, at least some of this age-related loss in olfac-
tory function may relate to factors unrelated to AD
pathogenesis (e.g., deterioration of nasal epithelium
or calcification of the cribriform plate36).
While impaired OI may in fact help identify per-
sons who could for various reasons eventually have
cognitive impairment, we strongly urge that our
present cross-sectional results not be regarded as
rationale for clinical use of olfactory testing as an
AD diagnostic. We suggest, however, that OI may
serve for research purposes as a simple and inexpen-
sive indicator of evolving AD pathology. Indeed, we
are exploring its use as a biomarker in clinical trials
among asymptomatic persons at risk of later demen-
tia symptoms. In this and other ways, OI may add
valuably to the measures available for AD prevention
research.
