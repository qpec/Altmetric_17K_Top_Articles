Summary
The real-world effectiveness
of intensity modulated radi-
ation therapy in reducing
acute toxicity during anal
cancer treatment remains
unclear. In a large sample of
patients with anal cancer
collected from the Veterans
Affairs system, intensity
modulated radiation therapy
was associated with
increased rates of timely and
complete treatment delivery
and lower rates of ostomy
placement related to tumor
recurrence or progression.

Purpose: Compared with conventional radiation therapy, intensity modulated radia-
tion therapy (IMRT) may reduce acute toxicity from anal cancer treatment, potentially
leading to improved long-term outcomes. We analyze the effect of IMRT on short- and
long-term outcomes among a large sample of US veterans.
Methods and Materials: From a national Veterans Affairs database, we identified 779
patients (n Z 403 conventional radiation therapy, n Z 376 IMRT) with locally
advanced anal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 and treated
with concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Radiation treatment planning and dosimetric
constraints were not standardized across patients. We analyzed the effect of IMRT on
short-term outcomes (acute toxicity, treatment breaks, and incomplete chemotherapy)
and long-term outcomes (survival and ostomy placement) in multivariable logistic
regression, Fine-Gray, and frailty models, adjusting for potential confounders.
Results: IMRT was associated with decreased radiation treatment breaks �5 days (odds
ratio [OR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.91; P Z .02), increased rates of
receiving 2 cycles of mitomycin C chemotherapy (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.22-3.45; P Z
.007), increased rates of receiving 2 cycles of any chemotherapy (OR 3.45; 95% CI
1.82-6.25; P < .001), and decreased risk of ostomy related to tumor recurrence or pro-
gression (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.37-0.99; P Z .045). IMRT was not
associated with a decrease in grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity (P Z .79), hospitaliza-
tion for gastrointestinal toxicity (P Z .59), or cancer-specific survival (P Z 0.18).

Conclusions: Among a large sample of US veterans with anal cancer, IMRT was asso-
ciated with higher rates of receiving 2 chemotherapy cycles, decreased radiation treat-
ment breaks, and decreased rates of ostomy placement. IMRT appears to offer
substantial benefits over conventional radiation therapy for patients undergoing concur-
rent chemoradiation therapy for anal cancer. � 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Introduction
Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has gained
popularity among radiation oncologists as a technique for
delivering highly conformal radiation doses to treatment
volumes while decreasing the dose to normal tissue and
lessening the toxicities of radiation (1, 2). In anal cancer,
adoption of IMRT has been encouraged by the substantial
hematologic, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic toxicities
of
combined
chemotherapy
and
radiation
treatment.
Retrospective studies comparing IMRT and conventional
conformal radiation therapy (RT) have suggested decreased
hospitalization and toxicity benefits (1, 3-7). A phase 2 trial
(Radiation
Therapy
Oncology
Group
[RTOG]
0529)
comparing dose-painted IMRT with a historical conven-
tional radiation arm did not reach its primary endpoint of
lower combined gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity,
although the investigators did find improvements in grade
2þ hematologic toxicity and grade 3þ dermatologic or
gastrointestinal toxicity (2).
In RTOG 0529, 81% of IMRT plans had protocol vio-
lations on prospective review, suggesting that the real-
world toxicity benefits of IMRT may be tempered by errors
in the complex treatment planning and delivery process (2).
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the real-world
comparative effectiveness of IMRT and conventional RT
in anal cancer for a range of short- and long-term outcomes.
Methods and Materials
Data source
We identified patients with anal cancer from the Veterans
Affairs (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure
(VINCI). VINCI is a comprehensive informatics platform
that allows researchers access to patient-level electronic
health record information and administrative data for all
veterans within the VA health care system. VINCI in-
corporates tumor registry data uploaded from individual VA
sites; these data are gathered at individual VA medical
centers by trained registrars according to standard protocols
issued by the American College of Surgeons (8). Although
some VA sites have maintained tumor registry operations
since the 1990s, all VA sites began collecting registry data
after a VA-wide directive in 1999. These data include
veterans who are treated at non-VA facilities if they
received any care at a VA facility over the course of their
illness. This study was approved by the VA San Diego
Institutional Review Board.
Patient cohort and treatment variables
We included patients with nonmetastatic, American Joint
Committee on Cancer stage I to III (9) anal squamous cell
carcinoma who received diagnoses between 2000 and 2015
and were treated with chemoradiation. Patients were cate-
gorized as having received chemoradiation if chemotherapy
was initiated within 2 weeks of the radiation start date. We
obtained chemotherapy information via VA pharmacy re-
cords, bar code administration records, intravenous infusion
records, and clinical orders.
Radiation dose and fractionation were obtained via
manual review of tumor registry data and clinical notes.
Radiation treatment planning and dosimetric constraints
were not standardized across patients because of local
practice patterns; dosimetric data were not available for
review. The delivery of IMRT was identified with Com-
mon Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for either
IMRT planning or treatment delivery during the course of
radiation. Patients without IMRT were assumed to have
received 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional conformal RT
and were combined into the conventional RT study group.
Radiation modality for those with missing CPT codes
(15% of the study cohort) was determined with chart
review.
Covariates
Variables
obtained
through
VA
tumor
registry
data
included tumor stage, nodal stage, age at diagnosis, race,
year of diagnosis, history of malignancy, employment,
and body mass index (BMI). Pretreatment positron
emission
tomography
scan
was
determined
through
inpatient and outpatient CPT codes. Comorbidities were
ascertained through inpatient and outpatient International
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 diagnosis codes;
comorbidities were included in the calculation of the
Charlson Comorbidity Index if the diagnosis code was
associated with at least 1 inpatient admission or 2
outpatient visits within 1 year before the date of diagnosis
(10-12). For HIV status, patients were defined as HIV-
positive if they had an ICD-9/10 diagnosis code for
AIDS or HIV infection any time before the date of cancer
diagnosis plus 6 months, to include HIV workup started at
the time of cancer diagnosis. ICD-9 codes included

 042.X-044.X and V08.X; ICD-10 codes included B20.X-
B24.X and Z21.X (10, 13). ZIP codeelevel median in-
come and education were obtained through the American
Community Survey 5-year estimates.
Outcomes
Short-term outcomes included receipt of 2 cycles of
chemotherapy, radiation treatment breaks, grade 3 to 4
hematologic toxicity, and hospitalization for gastrointes-
tinal toxicity. The standard course of chemotherapy for
anal cancer includes 2 cycles of chemotherapy delivered
concurrently with radiation (14). Patients were defined as
having completed 2 chemotherapy cycles if they received
a second chemotherapy infusion within 3 to 6 weeks of
the first cycle. Missed radiation treatment days were
calculated by subtracting the number of radiation frac-
tions from the number of weekdays (minus federal holi-
days) throughout the radiation course. Acute hematologic
toxicities (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or
anemia within 90 days of treatment start) were assessed
through VA laboratory data using Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (v. 4.0) criteria. Hospitaliza-
tion within 90 days of treatment at VA and non-VA hos-
pitals was obtained through inpatient admission records.
Reason for admission was determined by manual review
of the admitting diagnosis or, if this was not available,
review of ICD-9/10 diagnosis codes associated with the
admission.
Long-term outcomes included survival and ostomy
placement.
Survival
outcomes
included
anal
cancerespecific mortality, noneanal cancer mortality, and
all-cause mortality. Cause of death was obtained through
the National Death Index (98% of death data), and missing
values were supplemented with tumor registry data (2%).
Ostomy placement (colostomy or ileostomy) and reason for
placement (related to treatment toxicity or tumor recur-
rence or progression [15]) were determined through manual
chart review. Patients with ostomies before treatment were
excluded from the ostomy analysis.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics of patient, tumor, and treatment
characteristics were stratified by whether patients received
IMRT or conventional radiation. Differences in patient
characteristics between the IMRT and conventional radia-
tion groups were determined with c2 tests for categorical
variables and Student t tests for continuous variables. We
used both unadjusted and multivariable adjusted analyses
when assessing the impact of IMRT on short- and long-term
outcomes. Logistic regression models were used to deter-
mine the impact of IMRT on short-term outcomes,
including treatment-related outcomes and acute toxicity.
The impact of IMRT on long-term ostomy placement was
assessed with Fine-Gray competing risk analyses to account
for the competing risk of mortality. Each analysis was
performed on the subset of patients for whom outcome data
were available, ranging from 82% to 100% of the overall
sample.
With the cause-specific survival analysis, we hypothe-
sized that selection bias resulting from unmeasured vari-
ables could influence the impact of IMRT on survival. To
address this issue, we used an individual frailty model to
help account for unmeasured covariates in our cause-
specific survival analysis (16). The individual frailty
model posits a patient-specific random effect (frailty) in
the Cox model that acts multiplicatively on the baseline
hazard. Frailty is related to the patient’s underlying pre-
dilection to experience the event, and accounting for this
underlying predilection has been proposed to help account
for the effects of unobserved covariates (16-18). We
assumed a log-normal distribution for the random frailty
variable (19). To test the robustness of our survival
analysis, we conducted a secondary instrumental variable
(IV) analysis (20, 21), which represents an additional
technique to address the issue of unmeasured covariates.
Methodological details and results of the IV analysis are
shown in the supplementary materials (available online at
www.redjournal.org).
All variables in the multivariable models were chosen a
priori and included radiation modality, pretreatment posi-
tron emission tomography scan, tumor stage, nodal stage,
Charlson Comorbidity Index (10, 11), age at diagnosis,
race, year of diagnosis, mitomycin C chemotherapy, history
of malignancy, ZIP code median income, ZIP code edu-
cation, BMI, sex, and employment status. Because of a low
number of events in the cause-specific ostomy regressions,
to prevent overfitting we included only radiation modality,
tumor stage, nodal stage, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and
BMI in the models. All P values were 2-sided. Statistical
analyses were performed with SAS (v. 9.4) (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
Results
Patient characteristics
The overall sample included 779 patients, including 403
treated with conventional RT and 376 treated with IMRT
(Table 1). IMRT patients tended to have higher stage dis-
ease at presentation (40% stage 3 vs 27% for conventional
RT, P < .001), with the largest differences in nodal stage
(28% N2 or N3 in IMRT vs 18% in conventional RT, P Z
.001). Both groups received similar cumulative radiation
doses, although the IMRT group was more likely to receive
a chemotherapy regimen that included mitomycin C
chemotherapy (88% vs 72%, P < .001). IMRT use
increased steadily over the study period, with no patients
receiving IMRT before 2004 and up to 89% receiving
IMRT in 2012 to 2015. Median follow-up for the sample
was 5.9 years.

 Short-term outcomes
Eight percent of patients in the IMRT group did not receive
a second cycle of any chemotherapy, compared with 21% in
the conventional RT group (Table 2). Among patients
receiving mitomycin C, 20% of IMRT patients did not
receive 2 cycles of mitomycin C chemotherapy versus 49%
of conventional RT patients. Overall, 19% of IMRT patients
and 43% of conventional RT patients did not complete 2
full cycles of chemotherapy. The association between
IMRT and receipt of 2 chemotherapy cycles persisted on
multivariable analysis (Table 2). We found that IMRT
patients had a decreased likelihood of requiring a radiation
treatment break of greater than 5 days (hazard ratio [HR]
0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.91; P Z .02) and
at trend level for breaks greater than 10 days (HR 0.56;
95% CI 0.32-1.00; P Z .05). IMRT was not associated with
acute grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity or hospitalization
for gastrointestinal toxicity. In further analyses, we did not
find an association between IMRT and acute grade 3 to 4
hematologic toxicity within 3 weeks of the first chemo-
therapy cycle (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.53-1.32; P Z .44) in the
subset of patients who received 2 cycles of mitomycin C
(HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.51-1.73; P Z .83) or after controlling

0.69-1.67; P Z .74).
Long-term outcomes
In the unadjusted analyses, IMRT was associated with
lower overall, anal cancer, and noneanal cancer mortality
(Table 3), although after adjustment in the frailty model, the
associations between IMRT and mortality were nonsignif-
icant (all P > 0.05). Similar results were found in the
instrumental variable analysis (Table E1; available online at
www.redjournal.org). The 5-year tumor-related ostomy rate
was 7.5% in the IMRT group and 11% in the conformal
radiation group. After adjustment, IMRT was associated
with
40%
reduced
hazard
of
tumor-related
ostomy
placement (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.37-0.99; P Z .045)
(Table 2; Fig. 1). We found no difference in treatment-
related ostomy placement between IMRT and conformal
radiation.
Discussion
In this study of 779 US veterans with anal cancer, we found
that IMRT was associated with fewer radiation treatment
breaks, increased rates of receiving 2 cycles of chemo-
therapy, and a lower risk of tumor-related ostomy place-
ment,
although
there
was
no
difference
in
acute
hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity or long-term
survival outcomes. These results suggest that, in a real-
world sample of patients with anal cancer, IMRT improves

IMRT for anal cancer among VA patients

 the ability of patients to receive timely and complete che-
moradiation therapy and may reduce the need for ostomy
placement.
RTOG 05292 was a single-arm phase 2 trial comparing
toxicity outcomes between dose-painted IMRT and a his-
torical comparator arm of conventional RT; this trial rep-
resents the most well-powered prospective data on IMRT in
anal cancer to date. In RTOG 0529, there was a trend to-
ward decreased radiation treatment breaks and a significant
difference in overall duration of treatment; similarly, we
found that IMRT patients had fewer �5-day treatment
breaks than patients receiving conventional RT (29% vs
41%). Reducing treatment breaks appears to be important
for improving local control (22, 23), although the long-term
results of RTOG 92-08 suggested a more ambiguous effect
on survival (24). Our finding is also consistent with a
number of primarily retrospective studies that showed a low
frequency of treatment breaks with IMRT (3-5) and with a
recent report suggesting a trend toward shorter and fewer
treatment breaks with IMRT (25). Compared with the
findings of RTOG 0529, we observed a slightly higher rate
of incomplete chemotherapy courses among IMRT patients
(19% in our study vs 16% in RTOG 0529), likely reflecting
differences in practice and patient characteristics between a
clinical trial setting and real-world practice. We found that
IMRT was associated with a higher proportion of patients
receiving 2 cycles of chemotherapy, a finding with impor-
tant prognostic implications, given the proven benefit of
concurrent chemotherapy (26, 27). We found a lower risk of
tumor-related ostomy placement among IMRT patients,
which might be attributable in part to higher chemotherapy
completion rates, given randomized data showing an
improvement in colostomy-free survival with concurrent
chemotherapy (27). Finally, we found no difference in
survival
outcomes
after
multivariable
adjustment,
consistent with prior data that have not demonstrated a
large survival improvement for IMRT (6, 7, 25).
We found no difference in hematologic or gastrointes-
tinal toxicity between IMRT and conventional RT groups.
This stands in contrast to the results from RTOG 0529,
which found lower grade 2þ hematologic and grade 3þ
gastrointestinal toxicity for IMRT, along with other retro-
spective studies that have shown similarly low rates of
acute toxicity with IMRT (1-7). There are multiple poten-
tial explanations for this discrepancy. Chemotherapy is a
primary contributor to treatment toxicity, so the increased
rate of receiving 2 chemotherapy cycles among IMRT pa-
tients may have obscured the effect of IMRT in our anal-
ysis. However, in sensitivity analyses, we did not find that
IMRT reduced toxicity immediately after the first chemo-
therapy cycle among the subset of patients who received 2
cycles and when controlling for receipt of 2 chemotherapy
cycles. Another potential explanation is that the toxicity
benefit of IMRT might be dependent on technically correct
planning and delivery, which could be questionable in a
real-world cohort, given the complexities of IMRT plan-
ning. As evidence of this complexity, 81% of submitted
IMRT plans needed revision in RTOG 0529. Unlike in
RTOG 0529, in this observational study, there was no
standardized set of dosimetric guidelines limiting dose to
the gastrointestinal tract or bone marrow, and dosimetric
data were not available for review. The resulting variability
in treatment planning may help explain the lack of observed
toxicity benefit with IMRT.
Our study is subject to several important limitations. As
a retrospective analysis, our conclusions are likely subject
to selection bias and confounding by indication; although
we attempted to address this limitation by including a wide
range of measured covariates and using analytic techniques,
such as the frailty model and instrumental variable analysis
to account for unmeasured covariates, the potential for re-
sidual confounding remains. We were unable to review
IMRT plans to assess quality, although our study included
more granular and extensive radiation data than other
comparable retrospective analyses (7). As IMRT use
increased over the study period, our analyses may be sub-
ject to confounding by changing practice patterns or stan-
dards of care over time, although we controlled for year of
diagnosis in the analysis. A subset of patients may have
been planned for only 1 cycle of 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin
C, and we were unable to account for these patients in our
analysis; similarly, we were unable to account for planned
versus unplanned radiation treatment breaks, and we could
not differentiate treatment noncompliance from treatment
breaks. Because of the VA setting, our study population was
92% male and thus may not generalize to the broader
population of patients of both sexes with anal cancer. The
VA also provides social and supportive benefits to veterans
that may be less readily available to patients outside the
VA;
our
results
regarding
treatment
adherence
and
completion must therefore be generalized with caution to
non-VA populations. Finally, we had no data on grade 1 to

 2 toxicities or dermatologic toxicity, which may differ be-
tween IMRT and conventional RT.
Conclusions
In summary, we show that, compared with conventional RT,
IMRT is associated with decreased radiation treatment
breaks, increased receipt of 2 chemotherapy cycles, and
decreased ostomies resulting from tumor recurrence or
progression, although its effect on acute toxicity and sur-
vival outcomes is unclear. These data support the short-
term and potentially long-term benefit of IMRT, although
additional data are needed regarding real-world quality
assurance of IMRT planning and delivery.
