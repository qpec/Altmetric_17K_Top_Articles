Aims
Whether prevalence and mortality of patients with heart failure with preserved or mid-range (40–49%) ejection frac-
tion (HFpEF and HFmREF) are similar to those of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), as reported in
some epidemiologic studies, remains highly controversial. We determined and compared characteristics and out-
comes for patients with HFpEF, HFmREF, and HFrEF in a prospective, international, multi-ethnic population.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Prospective multi-centre longitudinal study in New Zealand (NZ) and Singapore. Patients with HF were assessed at
baseline and followed over 2 years. The primary outcome was death from any cause. Secondary outcome was
death and HF hospitalization. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare outcomes for patients with
HFpEF, HFmrEF, and HFrEF. Of 2039 patients enrolled, 28% had HFpEF, 13% HFmrEF, and 59% HFrEF. Compared
with HFrEF, patients with HFpEF were older (62 vs. 72 years), more commonly female (17% vs. 48%), and more
likely to have a history of hypertension (61% vs. 78%) but less likely to have coronary artery disease (55% vs.
41%). During 2 years of follow-up, 343 (17%) patients died. Adjusting for age, sex, and clinical risk factors, patients
with HFpEF had a lower risk of death compared with those with HFrEF (hazard ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval
0.46–0.85). Plasma (NT-proBNP) was similarly related to mortality in both HFpEF, HFmrEF, and HFrEF independ-
ent of the co-variates listed and of ejection fraction. Results were similar for the composite endpoint of death or
HF and were consistent between Singapore and NZ.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
These prospective multinational data showed that the prevalence of HFpEF within the HF population was lower
than HFrEF. Death rate was comparable in HFpEF and HFmrEF and lower than in HFrEF. Plasma levels of NT-
proBNP were independently and similarly predictive of death in the three HF phenotypes.

Introduction
The concept that both prevalence and mortality in patients with
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are similar to
those for those with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
reflects epidemiological reports from Olmsted County, USA1 and
Ontario, Canada2 published a decade ago. More recent epidemio-
logic trends in incident HFpEF from Olmsted County reinforced the
perception of similar overall mortality (�20% and �53% at 1 and
5 years respectively) in both HFpEF and HFrEF, and indicated no
change in mortality over the last decade.3 However, an individual
patient-level meta-analysis of studies found 3-year mortality rates
were lower for those with HFpEF (25%) compared with those with
HFrEF (32%), hazard ratio (HR) 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI)
0.61–0.71].4 Of note, this meta-analysis did not include all studies of
outcome in patients with HF, and in particular it did not include the
epidemiologic studies from Olmsted1 and Ontario.2 There is continu-
ing controversy regarding the true relative prevalence and mortality
of HFpEF vs. HFrEF.
The higher mortality rates in retrospective epidemiologic studies
compared to prospective clinical trials5 have been attributed to selec-
tion bias in trials that excluded patients with common serious comor-
bidities (e.g. renal disease) which may significantly impact mortality.6
Conversely, missing data (especially for EF7) and incomplete follow-
up limited retrospective studies. Thus, there remains uncertainty
regarding the relative prevalence and mortality and its clinical predic-
tors in HFpEF vs. HFrEF. We sought to acquire prospective data with
the primary aim to compare survival of patients with HFpEF vs.
HFrEF in an international real world setting across diverse popula-
tions, using prospectively collected data with as little missingness and
loss to follow-up as possible. Such data are critical for understanding
the clinical course of, designing clinical trials for, and planning alloca-
tion of public health resources to, HFpEF around the globe.
Methods
Study methods have been reported in full,8 and are summarized here.
Study design and population
We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of adults with HF from
New Zealand (NZ, four centres) and Singapore (six centres). All centres
were university or public hospitals serving large proportions of the com-
munity. Patients were those over age 18years with a clinical diagnosis of
HF, according to the attending physician and verified by the site investiga-
tor according to 2012 European Society of Cardiology criteria.9
Recruitment occurred either where the patient was in hospital (NZ 70%;
Singapore 61%) for a primary diagnosis of HF (assessment was done fol-
lowing stabilization of the acute HF) or in the outpatient setting (NZ
30%; Singapore 39%) within 6 months of an episode of decompensated
HF (requiring hospitalization or treatment in an out-patient setting).
Exclusion criteria included severe valve disease, transient acute pulmo-
nary oedema in the context of primary acute coronary syndrome,
end-stage renal failure, specific HF subgroups (including constrictive peri-
carditis, congenital heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac
amyloid, and chemotherapy-associated cardiomyopathy), isolated right
HF, life-threatening co-morbidity with life expectancy <1 year and inabil-
ity to provide consent.
Procedures
Patients were assessed at recruitment (baseline visit), clinic visits at
6 weeks and 6 months, and phone calls at 1 and 2 years. Importantly, all
baseline measurements, including blood sampling, were performed when
patients were assessed as stable and compensated and considered fit for
discharge or ongoing outpatient management rather than in the acute
decompensated state.
Clinical data
Clinical assessment at the study visits included collection of patient
demographics, medical history, physical examination, and 12-lead
electrocardiography.
Echocardiography
Comprehensive echocardiography was undertaken at each centre at
baseline and 6 months, by experienced echocardiographers following a
standardized protocol (American Society of Echocardiography guide-
lines). The average of three measurements was used for each variable.
Left ventricular (LV) volumes were measured using the biplane method
of disks (apical 4/2-chamber views), and left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) was derived. Left ventricular ejection fraction categories were
determined based on quantitative LVEF (90.5% of patients), or, where
this was not available and in descending hierarchy: qualitative LVEF (7%),
M-mode (1.5%), and most recent prior echo (1%). Heart failure with pre-
served ejection fraction was defined as LVEF>
_ 50% or qualitatively ‘nor-
mal’ EF; HFmidrangeEF (HFmrEF) as LVEF 40–49%, and HFrEF as
LVEF < 40% according to 2016 ESC Guidelines.10 Left ventricular diastolic
parameters included mitral annulus tissue Doppler, trans-mitral to mitral
annular early diastolic velocity ratio (E/e0), and left atrial volume (LAvol;
biplane area-length method). Left ventricular and LA volumes were
indexed to body surface area calculated using the Du Bois formula.
Relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated as (2*PWT)/LVEDD
(PWT, posterior wall thickness and LVEDD, LV end-diastolic dimension).
Blood sampling
At baseline, 6 week and 6 month visits blood samples were drawn into
EDTA tubes, spun and stored at -80�C and later assayed for N-terminal
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Samples for routine clinical
laboratory tests (creatinine, electrolytes, blood count) were collected at
each visit for immediate analysis.
Outcomes
Patient follow-up was for 2 years for all-cause death and hospitalization
for HF. Clinical outcomes were ascertained through direct phone calls to
patients, access to local hospital, national hospital admission, and mortal-
ity databases.
Study size
The study was powered for the primary outcome comparison of death
from any cause between HFpEF and HFrEF. A meta-analysis of previous
studies comparing outcomes in HFpEF vs. HFrEF11 estimated an odds
ratio of 0.56 (95% CI 0.48–0.66) from prospective and 0.74 (95% CI
0.70–0.78) from retrospective studies over an average of 2 years. An
expected mortality rate of 35% at 2 years (observed in the control arms
of the meta-analysis) in those with HFrEF was contrasted with a mortality
rate of 27% at 2 years in those with HFpEF. The prevalence of HFpEF in
the target population was estimated to vary between 25% and 35%. We
assumed that only 25% of recruited patients will have HFpEF, this yielded
a total sample size of 2394 patients (which included an allowance of 15%
for loss to follow-up) of whom 598 would be expected to have HFpEF

and yield statistical significance for a HR of at least 0.73 [assuming 90%
power at the 5% significance level for a two sided log rank test with 65%
survival vs. 73% survival for HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively PASS 2002
(Hintz, J, 2006). PASS Kaysville, UT, USA].
The first patient was recruited in March 2010, and study recruitment
was stopped on 31 August 2014 when it was clear the mean follow-up of
more than 2.5 years would provide sufficient clinical events to ensure
adequate power for the major study endpoint with a sample of 2000
patients. The decision to stop recruitment was made blinded to the EF
classification.
Statistical methods
Data from all sites were collected in standardized fashion and entered
into a central electronic database maintained in Singapore. Data quality
checks and statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) in NZ and STATA in Singapore.
Additional data quality control and consistency checks were performed
on the final merged data set. Statistical tests are two-sided and a 5% signif-
icance level was maintained throughout the analyses. No adjustment for
multiple comparisons was made for analyses addressing the primary
objective. The baseline variables for the EF groups were compared using
analysis of variance for continuous variables and the v2 tests of propor-
tions for categorical variables using exact methods where possible.
Results were presented for the EF groups for the whole cohort and by
country. Multiple linear regression was used to determine independent
predictors of baseline NT-proBNP with log(NT-proBNP) as the depend-
ent variable and incorporating variables chosen on the basis of expert
clinical judgement: age, sex, history of hypertension and diabetes, aetiol-
ogy (ischaemic or non-ischaemic), body mass index (BMI), New York
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, atrial fibrillation (AF), systolic
blood pressure (BP), heart rate, log(creatinine), LVEDD/BSA, LAvol/BSA,
and RWT.
Hospital admission and discharge on the same calendar day were not
considered a hospital readmission. The rate of all-cause death at 2 years
follow-up is reported as proportion dead at 2 years and deaths per 1000-
patient years with 95% CI calculated using an exact MID-P method
(www.openepi.com). Time to death was summarized using the standard
Kaplan–Meier survival statistics for HFpEF, HFmrEF, and HFrEF in the
total cohort and stratified by country. Mutivariable Cox proportional haz-
ard models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard of HFpEF and
HFmrEF compared to HFrEF for time to death. Covariates were selected
a priori based on clinical relevance for this HF cohort, with checks for
degree of missing data for each variable and when combined with other
variables, and included: age, sex, history of hypertension, history of diabe-
tes, aetiology (ischaemic or non-ischaemic), New York Heart Association
functional class, AF, systolic BP, heart rate, left bundle branch block,
log(creatinine), and log (NT-proBNP), and stratified by country. The cor-
relation between scaled Schoenfeld residuals and length of follow-up
were checked to ensure that there was no violation of the proportional
hazards assumption for all analyses. Direct adjusted hazards functions
were plotted.
Role of the funding source
The funders had no role in the study design, the collection, analysis, and
interpretation of data, in the writing of the report or in the decision to
submit the paper for publication. The first and corresponding author had
full access to all data for this study and had final responsibility for the
publication.
Results
Screening and recruitment
A total of 2039 patients were recruited, 1098 (54%) from six centres
in Singapore and 941 from four centres in NZ. In NZ, 4789 patients
were potentially eligible for the study, 869 were unable to provide
informed consent, and a further 2979 met one or more of the study
exclusion criteria, leaving 941 patients included in the study; in
Singapore 4809 patients were potentially eligible for the study, 391
were unable to provide informed consent, and a further 3320 met
one or more of the study exclusion criteria and thus 1098 patients
were included in the study (Figure 1). In both countries, compared to
potentially eligible patients at screening, recruited patients were
younger [NZ: 69 standard deviation (SD 14) vs. 73 (SD 15) years;
Singapore: 62 (SD 12) vs. 69 (SD 13) years] and more predominantly
male (NZ: 70 vs. 56%; Singapore: 76 vs. 61%).
Definition of ejection fraction group
Echocardiographic data from the patients screened for the study
showed that 31% had HFpEF [NZ 33% (1599/4789) and Singapore
28% (1345/4809)], 55% had LVEF< 50% and 14% had no prior echo
data available. In those recruited, echocardiographic data was avail-
able for all patients at the baseline visit: 1845 (90.5%) had quantitative
LVEF data, 148 (7.3%) semi-qualitative LVEF, 17 (0.8%) LV mode and
for 29 (1.4%) a prior recent echo LVEF (Supplementary material
online, Figure S1). In the entire recruited cohort, 574 (28%) patients
had HFpEF [NZ 331 (35%); Singapore 243 (22%)], 256 (13%) had
HFmrEF and 1209 (59%) had HFrEF [NZ 476 (51%); Singapore 733
(67%)].
Baseline clinical characteristics
Overall, mean age was 65 (SD 13) years, and 551 (27%) were women
(Table 1). Compared to patients with HFrEF, those with HFpEF were
older (mean age 72 vs. 62years), more often female (48% vs. 17%),
more likely to have a history of hypertension (78% vs. 61%) and AF
(52% vs. 33%) and less often a history of coronary artery disease
(CAD) (41% vs. 55%). Heart failure medications were commonly
used at the time of the baseline assessment, with 1715 (84%) of the
whole group receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
(ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (78% in HFpEF, 86%
in HFrEF), 1729 (85%) receiving a beta-blocker (79% in HFpEF, 88%
in HFrEF), and 1849 (91%) a loop diuretic (86% in HFpEF, 93% in
HFrEF). Functional status (NYHA class) and quality of life (Minnesota
Living with Heart Failure score) were similar in HFpEF and HFrEF.
Patients with HFpEF had slower heart rate (71 vs. 76 b.p.m.) and
higher systolic BP (131vs.121mmHg) compared to those with
HFrEF.
The clinical characteristics of the patients with HFmrEF were simi-
lar to the HFpEF group, except for age (66 years), proportion of
women (30%) and history of coronary artery disease, which were
similar to HFrEF (Table 1). When compared with patients in the NZ
cohort, those in Singapore were younger, had a higher prevalence of
hypertension, diabetes, and ischaemic aetiology. However, similar
differences were seen in these characteristics between the EF
phenotypes within each country (Supplementary material online,
Table S1).

Echocardiographic characteristics
according to ejection fraction phenotype
Median (25th, 75th percentile) LVEF was 60% (56%, 64%) among
patients with HFpEF, 44% (42%, 46%) among those with HFmrEF
and 26% (20%, 32%) among those with HFrEF. Patients with
HFpEF had smaller indexed LV end-diastolic volume [median 48
(38, 63) mL/m2 vs. 93 (73, 114) mL/m2], and smaller LV end-
systolic volume [20 (14, 26) mL/m2 vs. 67 (52, 87) mL/m2], but
similar LA volume [44 (31, 59) mL/m2 vs. 46 (35, 60) mL/m2] com-
pared to those with HFrEF. Despite similar functional status,
median E/e0 was lower in HFpEF than HFrEF [13 (10, 16) vs. 16
(13, 21): Table 1].
The echocardiographic characteristics of the patients with
HFmrEF were intermediate between the HFpEF and HFrEF groups
for LV volumes, but the median E/e0 was similar to that of the HFpEF
patients (Table 1). There were no differences in LV size between
Singapore and NZ and consistent differences were seen between EF
phenotype within each country (Supplementary material online,
Table S1). However, patients in NZ had larger LA size compared with
those from Singapore.
Laboratory data
Creatinine, sodium, and haemoglobin were similar in the three EF
groups (Table 1). Median (25th, 75th percentile) NT-proBNP was
1184 (482, 2441) pg/mL in HFpEF, 1532 (627, 2784) pg/mL in
HFmrEF, and 2195 (1040, 4548) pg/mL in HFrEF (P < 0.001).
Differences in NT-proBNP between these EF groups were consis-
tent within Singapore and NZ (Supplementary material online,
Table S1). The predictors of baseline NT-proBNP for the EF groups
included age, AF, BMI, renal dysfunction, and LA size (Supplementary
material online, Table S2). The major differences were that ischaemic
aetiology, larger heart size, and higher HR were stronger predictors
of high NT-proBNP in HFrEF than HFpEF; whereas the presence of
higher SBP and RWT were more strongly associated with high
NT-proBNP in HFpEF than HFrEF.
All-cause mortality
Data on death status was available for all patients. During 2 years of
follow-up, 343 (17%) patients died from any cause [Singapore
161/1098 (15%); NZ 182/941 (19%)]. In the entire cohort, 80 (14%)
patients with HFpEF died, 30 (12%) patients with HFmrEF and

233 (19%) patients with HFrEF (P = 0.0013). There were 75 (95% CI
60–93) deaths/1000-patient years in those with HFpEF, 63 (95%
CI 43–88)/1000-patient years in those with HFmrEF and 109
(95% CI 96–124)/1000-patient years among those with HFrEF
(P < 0.0001).
In the Cox proportional hazards model, including age and sex,
patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF had lower mortality than those
with HFrEF [HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.38–0.65: P < 0.0001) for HFpEF and
0.50 [95% CI 0.34–0.73: P = 0.0004) for HFmrEF; Table 2, Model 1,
Figure 2A]. When age, sex, history of hypertension and diabetes,
ischaemic aetiology, NYHA class, AF, SBP, HR, LBBB, and log(creati-
nine) were included, patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF remained at
lower risk of death from any cause compared to those with HFrEF
[adjusted HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.46–0.85: 0.003) for HFpEF and adjusted
HR 0.55 (95% CI 0.36–0.84: P = 0.006) for HFmrEF; Table 2, Model
2]. However, the mortality difference between HFpEF, HFmrEF, and
HFrEF was attenuated when logNT-proBNP was added to this model
[HR 1.19 (95% CI 0.84–1.68: P = 0.33) for HFpEF and HR 0.77 (95%
CI 0.49–1.20: 0.24) for HFmrEF; Table 2, Model 3]. Independent pre-
dictors of all-cause death were age, ischaemic aetiology, higher
NYHA Class (III or IV), lower SBP, and higher NT-proBNP. When
HF medications (ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers) were included in this lat-
ter model, beta-blockers were independently related to lower risk of
death (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42–0.74; P < 0.0001). All results were con-
sistent for both countries (Supplementary material online, Table S3)
despite the differences in demographics and risk factors between
Singapore and NZ.
Adjusting for age and sex, logNT-proBNP was strongly associated
with all-cause mortality regardless of EF group (HR 1.85, 95% CI
1.65–2.07; P < 0.0001). Across NT-proBNP quartiles the risk of death
increased (Figure 3), and there was no evidence of an interaction in
survival between logNT-proBNP and EF subgroup (P = 0.69).
Combined all-cause death and heart
failure hospitalization
During 2 years of follow-up, 824 patients (40%) either died from any
cause or were hospitalized for HF; 199 (35%) patients with HFpEF,
103 (40%) patients with HFmrEF and 522 (43%) patients with HFrEF.
In the Cox proportional hazards model including age and sex,
patients with HFpEF had lower risk of death or HF readmission than
those with HFrEF or those with HFmrEF [HR for HFpEF 0.66 (95%
CI 0.55–0.79; P < 0.0001), Table 2 Model 1, Figure 2B]. When age, sex,
history of hypertension and diabetes, aetiology (ischaemic or non-
ischaemic), NYHA class, AF, SBP, HR, LBBB, and log(creatinine) were
included in the model, patients with HFpEF remained at lower risk of
death or HF readmission compared to HFrEF or HFmrEF [HR 0.77
(95% CI 0.63–0.94; P = 0.0095) Table 2, Model 2]. However, when
logNT-proBNP was added to the fully adjusted model there was no
difference in the risk of death or HF readmission between patients
with HFpEF, HFmrEF and HFrEF [adjusted HR for HFpEF 1.13 (95%
CI 0.90–1.40; P = 0.38) Table 2, Model 3]. Independent predictors of
death or HF readmission included diabetes, ischaemic aetiology,
higher NYHA Class (III or IV), lower SBP, higher creatinine, and
higher NT-proBNP. Adding medications (ACEI/ARB, beta-blocker)
and history of prior HF hospitalization to the final model, patients
with a prior history of HF hospitalization had a higher risk (HR 1.3,
95% CI 1.10–1.54, P = 0.0013), and those taking a beta-blocker at
baseline a lower risk (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54–0.78, P < 0.0001) of
death or HF readmission. Similar to the results for all-cause mortality,
these results for the combined endpoint of death or HF readmission
were consistent for both countires (Supplementary material online,
Table S2).
Discussion
Our current prospective international data with complete EF assess-
ment and follow-up, firmly establish that overall prevalence, mortal-
ity, and risk of HF readmission of HFpEF are lower than in HFrEF,
even after adjusting for age, sex, and clinical covariates. Importantly,
NT-proBNP is strongly and similarly related to survival in HF regard-
less of EF, and a given level of NT-proBNP portends the same risk of
death in HFpEF, HFmrEF, and HFrEF. The primary determinant of
cardiac synthesis and release of NT-proBNP is myocardial wall stress
which, in accord with the Law of LaPlace, is directly related to the
transmural pressure gradient and chamber diameter and inversely to
wall thickness. Therefore the ‘drivers’ of a given elevation in NT-
proBNP must differ in HFpEF vs. HFrEF. Accordingly, we find ischae-
mia and eccentric LV remodelling playing a stronger role in HFrEF,
and increased RWT and afterload playing a stronger role in HFpEF.
This implies that while clinicians may, in general, anticipate better out-
comes in their patients with HFpEF compared to those with HFrEF, a
high NT-proBNP level should alert them of high risk, and prompt a

search for correctable drivers of the high NT-proBNP level. These
findings are applicable in both Asian and Western settings. These
findings also carry implications for designing therapeutic trials in
HFpEF regionally and globally. Inclusion by natriuretic peptide levels
will influence the power of trials for outcome results.
Previous studies of outcome in patients
with heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction
For many years, there has been uncertainty and controversy sur-
rounding the clinical outcomes for patients with HFpEF compared
with HFrEF. Ten years ago, two epidemiological studies from
Olmsted1 and Ontario2 reported similar outcomes for patients with
these two HF phenotypes. As other studies had shown conflicting
results, a literature-based meta-analysis incorporating data from a
large number of studies without EF inclusion criteria demonstrated
that overall those patients with HFpEF had a lower risk of death than
patients with HFrEF.11 Literature-based meta-analyses are limited by
the requirement to aggregate overall study results and thus cannot
adjust for potential confounders. The subsequent MAGGIC meta-
analysis collated patient-level data from 31 studies, and reported that
patients with HFpEF had lower risk of death from any cause com-
pared with those with HFrEF independent of age, sex, and aetiology.
However, the individual studies in this meta-analysis had inherent lim-
itations including missing data (especially missing EF7), selection biases
(e.g. hospitalized cases only) and data for NT-proBNP were not avail-
able. Our current, prospective data from a cohort recruited without
EF entry criteria, with complete EF assessment, incorporating impor-
tant risk factors, comorbidities and NT-proBNP and complete

follow-up, firmly establish that prevalence and mortality are lower in
HFpEF than HFrEF. Our consistent results in two different countries
with different distributions of background risk factors (including for
example, diabetes) and ethnicity, 5000 miles apart, is especially
unique, and speaks to the robustness of our findings.
The cohort of patients in the current study is representative of
patients in the community with HF, as by design the patient baseline
assessment was undertaken following a period of stabilization for
patients hospitalized with HF or following an exacerbation of HF that
was managed without hospitalization. Consistent with this, clinical
outcomes of this cohort are intermediate between those of previous
clinical trials involving patients with HFpEF and studies involving
patients with acute decompensated HF. For example, the death rates
in the current study for patients with HFpEF were 75/1000-patient
years: compared with 53/1000-patient years and 54/1000-patient
years in CHARM-Preserved12 and I-PRESERVE,13 respectively, and
115/1000-patient years in patients with acute HF.14 Similarly, the NT-
proBNP levels at baseline in the current study were intermediate
between levels in acute HF and previous HFpEF trial cohorts
(CHARM-Preserved and I-PRESERVE). Thus, the results from the
current study are likely to be generalizable to patients with HF in the
real world setting.
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic pep-
tide and outcome in patients with heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction
Numerous studies have reported the prognostic importance of NT-
proBNP in patients with HFrEF, although fewer studies have
reported on the relationship of NT-proBNP to outcomes in patients
across the full range of LVEF in HF. The ICON study reported data
from a pooled analysis involving patients assessed acutely in hospital
for symptoms of breathlessness.15 Seven hundred and twenty of
these patients had acute HF, of whom 293 had HFpEF (LVEF > 45%)
and NT-proBNP was an independent predictor of death. The Korean
HF Registry involved 3200 patients hospitalized with HF, 528 of
whom had HFpEF (LVEF >
_ 50%), with 1-year follow-up.14 The risk of
death increased linearly with increasing levels of NT-proBNP, with
no interaction by EF group. Both the ICON Study15 and Korean
Heart Failure Registry14 involved patients in the acute phase of
decompensated HF, and the latter had limitations of missing data
(32% missing NT-proBNP and 24% missing outcome data). A retro-
spective subgroup analysis from the COACH study, involving more
stable outpatients with HF reported that at any given level of BNP
the risk of death was similar for patients with HFpEF and HFrEF.16
Data from clinical trials in patients with HFpEF (PEP-CHF17 and
I-PRESERVE18) have demonstrated that NT-proBNP is an independ-
ent prognostic marker in patients with HFpEF. N-terminal pro-B-
type natriuretic peptide was not available in the prior Olmsted,1
Ontario,2 or MAGGIC4 studies. The current study has now extended
these observations in this carefully characterized group of patients
with HF, representative of those in the community, and clearly dem-
onstrates that while the risk of death was lower for patients with

HFpEF, the risk of death for any HF phenotype is similar at a given
level of NT-proBNP.
The strong association between NT-proBNP and outcomes in HF
regardless of EF is clinically important. NT-proBNP reflects LV wall
stress, and is therefore expected to be lower in HFpEF than HFrEF
on the basis of LaPlace’s Law. Yet, for a given level of NT-proBNP,
prognosis for HFpEF was as poor as for HFrEF. NT-proBNP meas-
urements thus provide a critical tool for clinicians to risk stratify their
patients with HFpEF, whether in the stable situation,16 or the acute
decompensated state.19 Notably, although risk of death at any given
level of NT-proBNP was demonstrably the same for both HF pheno-
types, the defining differences in ventricular morphology and there-
fore determinants of wall stress (the key determinant of NT-proBNP
release20) in HFpEF vs. HFrEF necessarily mean the drivers of plasma
NT-proBNP cannot be the same. The current data support these
contentions, with the important findings that NT-proBNP related
more strongly to different factors in patients with HFpEF (systolic BP
and increased RWT) and HFrEF (ischaemic aetiology, LV size, and
heart rate). This implies that clinicians facing patients with HF and
high NT-proBNP should look at a wide range of indices according to
the EF phenotype, not just the cardiac haemodynamics. While yet to
be proven, addressing both haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic/
non-cardiac factors may be especially important in HFpEF for the
improvement of patient outcomes. Finally, these findings also carry
implications for designing clinical trials in HFpEF, where inclusion by
natriuretic peptide levels will clearly influence the power of the trial
for outcome results.21
Heart failure with mid-range ejection
fraction
The 2016 ESC HF guidelines10 drew renewed attention to the patients
with LVEF between 40 and 49%, a grey area between HFrEF and
HFpEF, so-called ‘HFmidrangeEF’ (HFmrEF). In this current study 13%
of the patients had HFmrEF, similar to prior reports from a large
MediCare population.22 Also similar to prior population-based reports
from Sweden,23 patients with HFmrEF had similar burden of coronary
artery disease as those with HFrEF but similar risk of all-cause death
compared with those with HFpEF, although the combined risk of death
or HF readmission for this group was similar to those with HFrEF.
Study limitations
There were lower proportions of patients with HFpEF than HFrEF in
both the screened and recruited populations in Singapore compared
with NZ in the current study. The patients in Singapore were
younger than those in NZ, HFpEF is well described to occur more
commonly among older patients, and it is likely that these differences
in age account for the inter-country differences in proportions of
patients with HFpEF and HFrEF in the current study. This is likely to
be generalizable to patients with HF in Asia in general not just
Singapore as contemporary data indicate patients with HF are
younger in most Asia cohorts that in those from European coun-
tries.24,25 Thus, overall it can be expected that HFpEF will be less
common in Asia than the West.
Potential for selection bias in recruited patients
Both the Olmsted1 and Ontario2 patient populations were older
than the current study, particularly for HFrEF (HFrEF mean age
72 years in Olmsted/Ontario vs. 63years in Singapore/NZ; HFpEF
mean age 74–75 years in Olmsted/Ontario vs. 72years in Singapore/
NZ). While prospective recruitment using standardized protocols
minimized missing data in our study, participation bias may have
resulted in the relatively younger patient population. However the
age differences in the screened vs. recruited patients in Singapore/
NZ were small, and inclusion criteria were broad by design. Of note,
despite younger age, the prevalence of comorbidities was either simi-
lar or higher (hypertension, diabetes) in our patients compared to
the Olmsted/Ontario populations. The older age of both HFpEF and
HFrEF groups, and restriction to acutely hospitalized HF, may explain
the similar mortality in HFpEF and HFrEF in the prior studies. The
MAGGIC meta-analysis showed that there was significant interaction
between age and EF group on outcomes, where the difference in risk
of death between HFpEF and HFrEF was smaller among older
patients compared to younger patients.4 Furthermore, the difference
in risk of death between HFpEF and HFrEF was smaller in hospitalized
than in ambulatory patients.4 The potent prognostic impact of prior
HF hospitalization in HFpEF26 may be relevant. We found a prior HF
hospitalization was associated with worse outcomes in our study and
was more frequent in HFrEF than HFpEF. While patients with ischae-
mic aetiology of heart failure were included we excluded patients
who presented with transient acute pulmonary oedema due to a pri-
mary acute myocardial infarction (MI). This was to reduce the influ-
ence of the acute interventional management for acute MI at the time
of the baseline assessment. These results cannot thus be generalized
to the 14% of acute heart failure patients with acute MI.27 Data for
HF devices (implantable cardiac defibrillator and/or cardiac resynch-
ronization therapy) were available at baseline but some patients with
HFrEF may have had devices implanted during follow-up after appro-
priate medical therapy.
We acknowledge that participation bias may have influenced our
results. However the broad inclusion criteria, consecutive screening
and nation-wide approach in both Singapore and NZ were efforts to
minimize bias. The prospective design, low rate of missing data, and
identical parallel protocols in NZ and Singapore including compre-
hensive echocardiography and measurement of circulating bio-
markers, and the use of nationwide mortality/hospital admission
registers for complete follow-up, are strengths of this study.
Conclusions
In conclusion, HFpEF and HFrEF represent important subgroups of
patients with HF in this multi-ethnic contemporary population of
patients with HF, with consistent characteristic phenotypes. Overall,
and within two cohorts from differing geographic and ethnic back-
grounds, the prevalence of HFpEF was lower than that of HFrEF. The
risk of death from any cause was comparable in HFpEF and HFmrEF
and lower than for HFrEF. The risk of death or HF hospitalization was
lower for HFpEF than HFrEF or HFmrEF. Traditional risk factors,
including age, aetiology, and clinical status, were associated with clini-
cal outcomes in each EF phenotype. Plasma NT-proBNP related inde-
pendently and similarly to risk of death in the three HF phenotypes,

findings will inform projections of health care needs in heart failure
and the design of therapeutic trials in HFpEF around the world.

Corrigendum to: Percutaneous short-term active mechanical support devices in cardiogenic shock: a systematic review and collaborative meta-
analysis of randomized trials [Eur Heart J (2017); doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehx363].
The authors of the above article wish to inform readers that the following correction has been made post-publication: in the conclusion, the follow-
ing sentence has been corrected to include the word ‘in’: ‘Results of this collaborative meta-analysis do not support the unselected use of active
MCS in patients with CS complicating AMI.’
