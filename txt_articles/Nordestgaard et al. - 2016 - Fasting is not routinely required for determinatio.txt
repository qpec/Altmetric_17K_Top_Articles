Aims
To critically evaluate the clinical implications of the use of non-fasting rather than fasting lipid profiles and to provide
guidance for the laboratory reporting of abnormal non-fasting or fasting lipid profiles.
Methods
and results
Extensive observational data, in which random non-fasting lipid profiles have been compared with those determined
under fasting conditions, indicate that the maximal mean changes at 1–6 h after habitual meals are not clinically signifi-
cant [+0.3 mmol/L (26 mg/dL) for triglycerides; 20.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for total cholesterol; 20.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL)

for LDL cholesterol; +0.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for calculated remnant cholesterol; 20.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for calcu-
lated non-HDL cholesterol]; concentrations of HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotei-
n(a) are not affected by fasting/non-fasting status. In addition, non-fasting and fasting concentrations vary similarly over
time and are comparable in the prediction of cardiovascular disease. To improve patient compliance with lipid testing,
we therefore recommend the routine use of non-fasting lipid profiles, while fasting sampling may be considered when
non-fasting triglycerides .5 mmol/L (440 mg/dL). For non-fasting samples, laboratory reports should flag abnormal
concentrations as triglycerides ≥2 mmol/L (175 mg/dL), total cholesterol ≥5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol
≥3 mmol/L (115 mg/dL), calculated remnant cholesterol ≥0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL), calculated non-HDL cholesterol
≥3.9 mmol/L (150 mg/dL), HDL cholesterol ≤1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL), apolipoprotein A1 ≤1.25 g/L (125 mg/dL), apo-
lipoprotein B ≥1.0 g/L (100 mg/dL), and lipoprotein(a) ≥50 mg/dL (80th percentile); for fasting samples, abnormal
concentrations correspond to triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL). Life-threatening concentrations require separ-
ate referral when triglycerides .10 mmol/L (880 mg/dL) for the risk of pancreatitis, LDL cholesterol .13 mmol/L
(500 mg/dL) for homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, LDL cholesterol .5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) for heterozy-
gous familial hypercholesterolaemia, and lipoprotein(a) .150 mg/dL (99th percentile) for very high cardiovascular risk.
Conclusion
We recommend that non-fasting blood samples be routinely used for the assessment of plasma lipid profiles. Labora-
tory reports should flag abnormal values on the basis of desirable concentration cut-points. Non-fasting and fasting
measurements should be complementary but not mutually exclusive.

Introduction
Most individuals consume several meals during the day and some
consume snacks between meals; the postprandial state therefore
predominates over a 24 h period. Nonetheless, in clinical practice,
the lipid profile is conventionally measured in blood plasma or ser-
um obtained after fasting for at least 8 h, and therefore may not re-
flect the daily average plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations
and associated risk of cardiovascular disease.1,2
Interestingly, evidence is lacking that fasting is superior to
non-fasting when evaluating the lipid profile for cardiovascular
risk assessment. However, there are advantages to using non-
fasting samples rather than fasting samples for measuring the lipid
profile.3 – 7 Since 2009, non-fasting lipid testing has become the
clinical standard in Denmark, based on recommendations from
the Danish Society for Clinical Biochemistry that all laboratories
in Denmark use random non-fasting lipid profiles as the standard,
while offering clinicians the option of re-measuring triglyceride
concentrations in the fasting state if non-fasting values are
.4 mmol/L (350 mg/dL).8,9 Furthermore, the UK NICE guidelines
have endorsed non-fasting lipid testing in the primary prevention
setting since 2014.10
The most obvious advantage of non-fasting rather than fasting li-
pid measurements is that it simplifies blood sampling for patients, la-
boratories, general practitioners, and hospital clinicians and is also
likely to improve patient compliance with lipid testing.3 –7 Indeed,
patients are often inconvenienced by having to return on a separate
visit for a fasting lipid profile and may default on essential testing.
Also, laboratories are burdened by a large volume of patients at-
tending for tests in the morning. Finally, clinicians are burdened by
having to review and make decisions on the findings in the lipid pro-
file at a later date. This situation may also require an additional
phone call, email, or even a follow-up clinic visit, placing extra work-
loads on busy clinical staff.
Perceived limitations to adopting non-fasting lipid measurements
include the following: (i) fasting before a lipid profile measurement is
believed to provide more standardized measurements; (ii) non-fasting
lipid profiles are perceived as providing less accurate measurements
andmaymakecalculationoflow-densitylipoprotein(LDL)cholesterol
via the Friedewald equation invalid; (iii) as fasting has been the clinical
standard, it is unclear what values should be flagged as abnormal
when using non-fasting rather than fasting plasma lipid profiles. These
perceived limitations will be addressed in this paper.
The aims of the present joint consensus statement are to critically
evaluate the use of non-fasting rather than fasting lipid profiles, and
the clinical implications of this question with a view to providing ap-
propriate guidance for laboratory and clinicians. Based on evidence
from large-scale population studies and registries and on consensus
of expert opinions, the European Atherosclerosis Society/European
Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (EAS/
EFLM) joint consensus statement proposes recommendations on
(i) situations when fasting is not required for a lipid profile and
(ii) how laboratory reports should flag abnormal lipid profiles to im-
prove compliance of patients and clinicians with concentration goals
used in guidelines and consensus statements on cardiovascular

 disease prevention.11–15 This joint consensus statement is aimed at
internists, general practitioners, paediatricians, cardiologists, endo-
crinologists, clinical biochemists, laboratory professionals, public
health practitioners, health service planners, other health profes-
sionals, healthcare providers, and patients worldwide. Key recom-
mendations are given in Table 1.
Constituents of the plasma lipid
profile
A standard lipid profile includes measurements of plasma or serum
concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (Figure 1).
Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides are mea-
sured directly, while LDL cholesterol can either be measured direct-
ly or calculated by the Friedewald equation if triglycerides are
,4.5 mmol/L (,400 mg/dL): total cholesterol minus HDL choles-
terol minus triglycerides/2.2 (all in mmol/L; or minus triglycerides/5
with values in mg/dL),16 with direct measurement of LDL choles-
terol at triglyceride concentrations ≥4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL).
Traditionally, the Friedewald equation has been applied to a fasting
lipid profile; however, calculated LDL cholesterol determined with
this equation at triglyceride concentrations ,4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/
dL) is similar to LDL cholesterol measured directly on both fasting
and non-fasting lipid profiles (Figure 2).17,18 These four measure-
ments can, without additional cost, be supplemented with remnant
cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol.
Remnant cholesterol (¼triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol) is
calculated as total cholesterol minus LDL cholesterol minus HDL
cholesterol, using non-fasting or fasting lipid profiles; if LDL choles-
terol is also calculated, then remnant cholesterol is equivalent to tri-
glycerides/2.2 in mmol/L and to triglycerides/5 in mg/dL. Calculated
remnant cholesterol is a strong causal risk factor for cardiovascular
disease.19–21 Non-HDL cholesterol is calculated as total cholesterol
minus HDL cholesterol and is equivalent to LDL cholesterol, remnant
cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) cholesterol combined (Figure 1). The
use of non-HDL cholesterol for cardiovascular disease risk prediction
has been emphasized in several guidelines and consensus papers.12–15
The most important additional measurement for inclusion for
cardiovascular disease risk prediction is lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)].
This genetic, causal cardiovascular risk factor11,22 should be mea-
sured at least once in all patients screened for cardiovascular
risk;11 it is noteworthy that Lp(a) concentrations vary little over
time (,10%) in any individual. The determination of Lp(a) should
not, however, be included in repeated lipid profile measurements
in the same patient, unless therapeutic intervention is aimed at redu-
cing Lp(a) concentrations or in selected circumstances. Importantly,
the cholesterol content of Lp(a), corresponding to 30% of Lp(a) to-
tal mass,23 is included in total, non-HDL, and LDL cholesterol values
and its apolipoprotein B content in the apolipoprotein B value.
Finally, measurements of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A1
can be used as alternatives to non-HDL and HDL cholesterol mea-
surements, respectively (Figure 1),13–15,24 but these determinations
come at extra cost.
Why has fasting been the standard?
Venipuncture is a universal practice involved in testing the lipid pro-
file with the purposes of predicting cardiovascular risk and/or mon-
itoring responses to lipid-lowering therapy. Some guidelines
continue to promulgate the conventional practice of measuring
the lipid profile in the fasting state,25 although other organizations
endorse non-fasting lipid profiles.8,10 The 2013 American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines
do not require fasting for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk
estimation; however, they do recommend a fasting lipid panel before
statin initiation to calculate LDL cholesterol and for individuals with
non-HDL cholesterol ≥5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) or triglycerides
≥5.7 mmol/L (500 mg/dL), as these may be clues to genetic and/
or secondary causes of hypertriglyceridaemia.25 One reason among
others for preferring fasting lipid profiles is the increase in triglycer-
ide concentration seen during a fat tolerance test;26,27 however, the
increase in plasma triglycerides observed after habitual food intake
in most individuals is much less than that observed during a fat tol-
erance test.3,4,9,28–31 As a fast-food meal consisting of e.g. a burger, a
shake, and fries might be considered a fat tolerance test, in areas
where fast-food consumption is especially high patients may be ad-
vised to avoid high-fat, fast-food meals on the day of lipid profile
testing. Also, as LDL cholesterol is often calculated by the Friede-
wald equation, which includes the triglyceride concentration,
Figure 1 Lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins as part of
standard and expanded lipid profiles. Standard lipid profiles consist
of triglycerides and total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol; however, a standard lipid profile could
also report calculated remnant cholesterol and calculated
non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as these come at no add-
itional cost. Calculated remnant cholesterol is non-fasting total
cholesterol minus low-density lipoprotein cholesterol minus high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol. Calculated non-high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol is total cholesterol minus high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol. Lipoprotein(a) should be measured at least
once in every individual screened for cardiovascular risk in order
to detect potentially high concentrations of this genetic risk factor.
Finally, apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A1 can be used as al-
ternatives to non-high-density lipoprotein and high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol, but these measurements come at an extra
cost. Figure designed by Prof. B.G. Nordestgaard.

 calculated LDL cholesterol has been thought to be affected substan-
tially by food intake; however, directly measured and calculated LDL
cholesterol values are similar using both fasting and non-fasting lipid
profiles (Figure 2).17,18 If this Friedewald equation is employed, there
may be some underestimation of LDL cholesterol when chylomi-
crons are present, which may even be circumvented if a modification
of this equation is used.32 Also, many randomized lipid-lowering
trials have used fasting lipid measurements and, in order to follow
evidence-based practice, fasting blood sampling has often been
the standard in everyday risk assessment. However, numerous
population-based studies and at least three major statin trials used
random, non-fasting blood sampling (Table 2), providing a robust
evidence base for a change in the conventional practice of using fast-
ing samples.
Influence of food intake on the
plasma lipid profile
Several large-scale, population-based studies and registries including
children, women, men, and patients with diabetes have now
established that plasma lipids and lipoproteins change only modestly
in response to habitual food intake (Figures 3 and 4, Table 3);3,4,9,29,30
this applies to the majority of individuals, but rarely some exhibit ex-
aggerated responses. These studies were the Women’s Health
Study from the USA, the Copenhagen General Population Study
from Denmark, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey from the USA (Figure 3), and the Calgary Laboratory Services
from Canada (Figure 4). Among all studies comparing non-fasting
with fasting lipid profiles, minor increases in plasma triglycerides
and minor decreases in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations
were observed, with no change in HDL cholesterol concentrations.
These minor and transient changes in lipid concentrations appear to
be clinically insignificant; however, Langsted et al. observed a transi-
ent drop in LDL cholesterol concentration of 0.6 mmol/L (23 mg/
dL) at 1–3 h after a meal in diabetic patients, which could be of clin-
ical significance,33 particularly if this is used as an argument to with-
hold statins in a given patient. Of note, the reduction in total and
LDL cholesterol at 1–3 h after the last meal observed in individuals
with and without diabetes became statistically insignificant after ad-
justing for plasma albumin concentration as a marker of fluid in-
take;3,9 therefore, such a drop in total and LDL cholesterol is

Clinical implications of non-fasting lipid profiles

 unrelated to food intake, noting that a similar drop may even be ob-
served in a fasting lipid profile, since water intake is allowed ad libi-
tum before a fasting blood test.2 Thus, the only way to prevent this
drop in LDL cholesterol concentrations using either fasting or non-
fasting lipid profiles is to forbid water intake before lipid profiles
testing, while so-called fasting sampling will not remove this phe-
nomenon. Importantly, in patients with diabetes, a fasting lipid pro-
file may further disguise postprandial triglyceride increases that may
be particularly important in the diabetic state.
For the purpose of the present joint consensus statement, we up-
dated the analyses of Langsted et al.3,34 (Figure 5), based on the Co-
penhagen General Population Study and including 92 285 men and
women from the Danish general population. As in previous reports
(Table 3),3,4,9,29,30,34 the maximal mean changes at 1–6 h after habit-
ual meals were considered clinically insignificant at +0.3 mmol/L
(26 mg/dL) for triglycerides, 20.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for total chol-
esterol, 20.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for LDL cholesterol, +0.2 mmol/L
(8 mg/dL) for calculated remnant cholesterol, and 20.2 mmol/L
(8 mg/dL) for calculated non-HDL cholesterol, while concentra-
tions for HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B,
and Lp(a) remained unchanged (Figure 5). Naturally, the corre-
sponding changes in concentrations in individual patients will differ
from the mean changes seen in Table 3 and in Figures 3–5, exactly as
concentrations will differ from one fasting measurement to another
in the same individual.
Influence of food intake on the
prediction of cardiovascular risk
We exist mostly in the non-fasting state, which therefore reflects
our habitual physiological status. However, blood samples typically
measured after an 8–12 h fast have been the standard for assessing
the plasma lipid profile.1,2 Postprandial effects do not appear to

 diminish, and may in fact enhance, the strength of the associations
between plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein concentra-
tions and risk of cardiovascular disease.
Since the 1970s, numerous reports from well-conducted, large,
representative, and mostly prospective studies with medium- to
long-term follow-up have consistently found that non-fasting lipids
suffice for screening of cardiovascular disease risk.3,4,31,35–39 These
studies have examined clinical outcomes ranging from incident car-
diovascular disease events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and
revascularization) to cardiovascular or all-cause mortality, with con-
sistent associations for non-fasting lipid profiles with cardiovascular
disease risk. Furthermore, studies that included fasting and/or
non-fasting individuals have found generally similar or sometimes su-
perior cardiovascular disease risk associations for non-fasting com-
pared with fasting lipid profiles, including for triglycerides;3,4,31,38,39
the challenge of taking small amounts of alcohol during non-fasting
hours of the day and its influence on lipid profile values has often not
been studied. Prospective studies that have assessed non-fasting
lipid profiles are shown in Table 2.
A meta-analysis from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration
that analysed the association of lipid profiles and risk of coronary
heart disease events from 68 prospective studies, and included
over 300 000 individuals, equally found no attenuation of the
strength of the association between plasma lipid and lipoprotein
concentrations and incident cardiovascular events in the 20 studies
that used non-fasting blood samples; indeed, non-fasting non-HDL
cholesterol and non-fasting calculated LDL cholesterol were super-
ior to fasting measurements for predicting cardiovascular risk (n ¼
103 354; number of events 3829).36 Furthermore, at least three
large clinical trials of statin therapy (Heart Protection Study,
Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial—Lipid Lowering
Arm, and the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions
in Cholesterol and Homocysteine) involving nearly 43 000 partici-
pants used non-fasting lipid profile measurements (Table 2).

 Finally, for the purpose of this joint consensus statement and
based on the Copenhagen General Population Study including
92 285 men and women from the Danish general population, we ex-
amined the risk of ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction
for the highest vs. lowest quintile of random non-fasting lipids, lipo-
proteins, and apolipoproteins as part of standard and expanded lipid
profiles (Figure 6); all lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were
associated strongly with the risk of both endpoints.
Hence, numerous prospective cohorts have found significant as-
sociations for non-fasting lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins
with cardiovascular disease risk, and several landmark clinical trials
of statin therapy have used non-fasting lipids for trial entry criteria
and for monitoring the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy. Collective-
ly, these observations suggest that non-fasting blood sampling is
highly effective, practical, and advantageous in assessing lipid-
mediated cardiovascular disease risk and treatment responses.
Recommendations on the use
of non-fasting lipid profiles
To improve patient compliance with lipid testing, we therefore
recommend that non-fasting lipid profiles be used in the majority
of patients (Table 4), while with non-fasting plasma triglyceride
.5 mmol/L (440 mg/dL), fasting sampling may be considered.
However, as lipid profile measurements often are taken repeatedly
in the same patient, a single, spurious, non-fasting very high triglycer-
ide concentration due to a very high fat intake preceding blood sam-
pling will be followed by other measurements with lower
concentrations.
Fasting can be a barrier to population screening, is unpopular with
children, is often unsuitable for patients with diabetes, and counters
the use of point-of-care testing, and fasting requirements can add to
the overall costs of lipid testing. Non-fasting tests are also used to
assess other metabolic disorders, such as haemoglobin A1c in dia-
betes. The collective sources of evidence reviewed above have
therefore led to the notion that fasting samples are not essential
for evaluation of cardiovascular risk.
Arguments against the use of non-fasting samples also merit con-
sideration. There is evidence that the non-fasting condition may
marginally lower plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations owing to
liberal intake of fluids (Table 3), and therefore lead to a potential
minor misclassification of cardiovascular risk, as well as to error in
initiating or altering lipid-lowering medication; although not all stud-
ies agree, this risk is small and may chiefly apply to diabetic sub-
jects.5,9,33 While a non-fasting sample is sufficient to diagnose an
isolated hypercholesterolaemia, such as familial hypercholesterol-
aemia, or elevated Lp(a), it can possibly confuse the distinction be-
tween familial hypercholesterolaemia and genetic forms of high
triglycerides. Since non-fasting may therefore impair the accuracy

aNo longer statistically significant after adjustment for reduction in plasma albumin concentrations; thus this drop in total and LDL cholesterol is due to fluid intake, not to food
intake. In other words, as water intake is allowed during the up to 8 h fasting before lipid profile testing,2 this reduction in total and LDL cholesterol will also occur for fasting lipid
profiles.
bLangsted et al. observed a drop in LDL cholesterol of 0.6 mmol/L (23 mg/dL) at 1–3 h after a meal in diabetics, which could be of clinical significance,33 particularly if this precluded
initiation of statin therapy. However, such an LDL reduction may also occur for fasting lipid profiles with water intake allowed,2 as the likely explanation for the LDL cholesterol
drop is fluid intake and ensuing haemodilution.

 in diagnosing some forms of hyperlipidaemia, we recommend that
laboratories should also offer measurement of fasting triglycerides
according to clinical context and indications, as in the case of very
high non-fasting triglyceride concentration. Plasma lipids can be
highly variable in children and a precise diagnosis of a lipid disorder
that requires drug therapy may necessitate at least a second sample
in the fasting state. From an evidence-based perspective, fasting and
non-fasting samples have never been tested head-to-head in a clin-
ical trial to assess how the corresponding lipid profiles alter clinical
management and the disposition of patients, and what the relative
cost-effectiveness of both approaches is. It is most unlikely that
such a study will ever be funded, however.
What pragmatic recommendations can be made? First, non-
fasting and fasting measurements of the lipid profile must be
viewed as complementary and not mutually exclusive (Table 4).
Common sense must prevail and a distinction made between their
use in screening, assessment, and diagnosis. Fasting is less critical
for first-stage screening, but may be more important when trying
to establish a phenotypic diagnosis of genetically determined dys-
lipidaemias. Further, one circumstance where fasting may be espe-
cially value is getting a baseline lipid determination for those about
to start medications that cause severe hypertriglyceridaemia in a
genetically predisposed individual. Noting that fasting triglycerides
are elevated can thus be useful before, e.g. steroid, oestrogen, or
retinoid acid therapy. Also, fasting lipids have been used to follow
the course of those recovering from hypertriglyceridaemic pan-
creatitis. Nevertheless, non-fasting blood samples can routinely
be used for assessment of plasma lipid profiles in most situations
(Table 4).

 Potential for risk misclassification
It is important to consider whether transferring from fasting to non-
fasting lipid profiles could lead to misclassification of cardiovascular
risk and error in initiating statin therapy. Importantly, since statin
treatment is decided on the basis of an individual’s global cardiovas-
cular risk, including the presence of cardiovascular disease, familial
hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes, and not just on plasma lipid va-
lues in both European and US guidelines,15,25 minor changes in the
lipid profile from fasting to non-fasting conditions (Figures 3–5,
Table 3) will affect only a few individuals regarding the decision to
start a statin or not. However, most guidelines use LDL cholesterol
to monitor pharmacological treatment and as goals for treatment. In
individuals with borderline LDL cholesterol, the lower LDL choles-
terol observed 1–6 h after a habitual meal, particularly in diabetic
patients (Table 3), needs to be considered when using non-fasting
lipid profiles to decide whether to commence a statin or titrate
its dose. Of note, since the observed reduction in LDL cholesterol
is due to liberal fluid intake and haemodilution rather than to food
consumption, a similar LDL reduction is likely to occur when using
fasting lipid profiles with no restrictions on water intake.2
Novel findings from experience
in Denmark
In 2009, the Danish Society for Clinical Biochemistry recom-
mended that all laboratories in Denmark use random non-fasting
lipid profile measurements rather than fasting profiles.8,9 It was be-
lieved that a single spurious, non-fasting very high triglyceride con-
centration due to high fat intake preceding blood sampling would
be followed by other measurements with lower concentrations.
However, it was also recommended that laboratories should offer
the option of re-measurement of triglyceride concentrations in the
fasting state, if non-fasting triglyceride values were at .4 mmol/L
(.350 mg/dL).
This change in blood sampling was easy to implement in Den-
mark: after adoption of the non-fasting strategy by major university
hospitals in Copenhagen and subsequent corresponding reports in
written and electronic media nationwide, patients and clinicians in
the entire country pushed for similar changes at their local clinical
biochemical laboratory. Only a few laboratories refused initially to
follow this new practice, but by 2015 practically all laboratories in
Denmark use non-fasting lipid profiles.

In most patients, including:

† In the elderly
† Patients on stable drug therapy
Fasting

† Non-fasting triglycerides .5 mmol/L (440 mg/dL)
† Known hypertriglyceridaemia followed in lipid clinic
† Recovering from hypertriglyceridaemic pancreatitis
† Starting medications that cause severe
hypertriglyceridaemia
† Additional laboratory tests are requested that
require fastingc or morning samples (e.g. fasting
glucosec, therapeutic drug monitoring)
aWill need repeated lipid profile testing later because acute coronary syndrome
lowers lipid concentrations.
bDiabetic hypertriglyceridaemia may be masked by fasting.
cIn many countries, fasting blood sampling is restricted to very few analytes besides
lipid profiles: one example is fasting glucose; however, in many countries, even
fasting glucose measurement is being replaced by measurement of haemoglobin
A1c without the need to fast.
Figure 7 Comparison of concentrations of plasma triglycerides
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measured in the non-
fasting and fasting states in the same patients. Diabetes was deter-
mined as a haemoglobin A1c .7.1% (of all 5538 patients with both
fasting and non-fasting triglyceride measurements, 371 did not
have a haemoglobin A1c measurement). Values are medians and
interquartile ranges; in strata of plasma triglycerides, the interquar-
tile ranges are larger for fasting than for non-fasting values, which is
explained by regression dilution bias as the groups were defined
initially based on the non-fasting measurements. Figure designed

 To illustrate the consequences of implementing this new blood
sampling policy and for the purpose of the present joint consensus
statement, we retrieved results for all triglyceride measurements at
Herlev Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital in the period
April 2011 through April 2015: of �60 000 triglyceride measure-
ments, only 10% were measured in the fasting state. Further, among
the 5538 patients with both a non-fasting and a fasting triglyceride
measurement, concentrations were very similar fasting and non-
fasting measures overall as well as when stratified by triglyceride
concentrations and the presence or absence of diabetes (Figure 7,
top). In groups stratified for triglyceride concentrations, the inter-
quartile ranges were wider for fasting than for non-fasting triglycer-
ides, which is explained by regression dilution bias as the initial
groups were made based on non-fasting concentrations and then
fasting concentrations were compared afterwards. Thus, if groups
were made initially based on fasting concentrations, then the confi-
dence intervals for non-fasting triglycerides were wider than for
fasting triglycerides (data not shown). In other words, the variation
in fasting and non-fasting triglyceride concentrations measured in
the same individuals at two different occasions is similar, as is also
clear for the value in all 5538 individuals combined (Figure 7, top).
Results were also similar for LDL cholesterol comparing non-fasting
and fasting values (Figure 7, bottom).
Recommendations on laboratory
reporting of abnormal non-fasting
and fasting lipid profiles
We recommend that laboratory reports should flag abnormal values
based on desirable concentration cut-points, defined by guidelines
and consensus statements,11–15 and for non-fasting samples, flag ab-
normal concentrations as triglycerides ≥2 mmol/L (175 mg/dL)40,41
(corrected for endogenous glycerol), total cholesterol ≥5 mmol/L
(190 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol ≥3 mmol/L (115 mg/dL), calculated
remnant cholesterol ≥0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL), calculated non-HDL
cholesterol ≥3.9 mmol/L (155 mg/dL), HDL cholesterol ≤1 mmol/L
(40 mg/dL) (sex-specific cut-points can be used for HDL cholesterol),
apolipoprotein A1 ≤1.25 g/L (125 mg/dL), apolipoprotein B ≥1.0 g/L
(100 mg/dL), and Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL (80th percentile) (Table 5); for
fasting samples, abnormal concentrations should be triglycerides
≥1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL), remnant cholesterol ≥0.8 mmol/L
(30 mg/dL), and non-HDL cholesterol ≥3.8 mmol/L (145 mg/dL)
while other measurements should use identical cut-points as for
non-fasting values.
The majority of these cut-points correspond to desirable concen-
trations from guidelines and consensus statements.11–15 However, a
desirable concentration cut-point for non-fasting triglycerides has

These values for flagging in laboratory reports are in some instances higher than corresponding to recommended desirable values in high and very high risk patients (Tables 6 and 7).
We recommend to use SI units (e.g. mmol/L for lipids and g/L for apolipoproteins); however, as these values are not used in all countries, we also provide cut-points for other
commonly used units.
LDL, low-density lipoprotein; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein; IDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein.
aValues in mmol/L were converted to mg/dL by multiplication with 38.6 for cholesterol and by 88 for triglycerides, followed by rounding to nearest 5 mg/dL; for total cholesterol,
we used 5 mmol/L and 190 mg/dL, as these are the two desirable concentration cut-point typically used in guidelines.
bTriglyceride cut-points based on assays with correction for endogenous glycerol. In most laboratories, however, triglycerides are measured without subtraction of the glycerol
blank; thus, triglycerides may wrongly be flagged as abnormal in rare individuals with very high plasma glycerol. That said, not accounting for the glycerol blank in outpatients rarely
affected the triglyceride concentration .0.1 mmol/L; in inpatients, the effect was rarely over 0.28 mmol/L.48 High endogenous glycerol is seen e.g. during intravenous lipid or
heparin infusion.
cCalculated as total cholesterol minus LDL cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol, that is, VLDL, IDL, and chylomicron remnants in the non-fasting state and VLDL and IDL in the
fasting state.
dCalculated as total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol.
eThere is no consensus on which cut-point value in mmol/L that should be used for lipoprotein(a).
fValue for lipoprotein(a) should represent ≥80th percentile of the specific lipoprotein(a) assay.
gSex-specific cut-points can be used for HDL cholesterol.

 been documented only recently;40,41 we therefore choose to recom-
mend flagging of abnormal concentrations of non-fasting triglycerides
as ≥2 mmol/L (175 mg/dL), according to the recent study from the
Women’s Health Study that found that this cut-point was optimal
for cardiovascular risk prediction. Interestingly, this is almost identical
to the cut-points previously suggested by the EAS and by the Athens
Expert Panel.12,24,42 A concentration cut-point for fasting triglycerides
at 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) was taken as 0.3 mmol/L lower than for
non-fasting triglycerides, corresponding to the mean maximal in-
crease of triglycerides following habitual food intake (Figure 5, Table 3).
Interestingly, this cut-point is identical to those proposed previously
for fasting triglycerides by the AHA14 and the EAS.12
Usually, in laboratory medicine, results of measured parameters
are considered to be abnormal if they exceed the age- and
sex-specific reference interval (¼2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). All re-
sults below or above these recommended cut-points are flagged
with a character to show at a glance that this value deserves atten-
tion. Also automatic validation and flagging are used in many labora-
tories. Depending on the laboratory, this labelling can vary.
Theoretically, the reference intervals should be established by
each laboratory, but in most cases they are taken over from the gen-
eral information provided by the manufacturer in the package insert.
Due to wide-spread unhealthy life style, in most populations the
upper reference cut-point (i.e. 97.5th percentiles) of total choles-
terol
(.7.8 mmol/L
in
Denmark)
and
LDL
cholesterol
(.5.5 mmol/L) as well as triglycerides (.4.4 mmol/L) are very
high and place individuals at considerably increased cardiovascular
risk. Therefore, flagging abnormal values based on desirable concen-
tration cut-points rather than reference intervals are recommended
to identify abnormal test results. Especially for LDL cholesterol, the
desirable values vary with the individual’s global risk between
,1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) (very high risk), ,2.5 mmol/L (100 mg/
dL) (high risk), and ,3.0 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) (moderate risk)15,25
(Tables 6 and 7). These different values are classified according to
the presence or absence of co-morbidities (atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease) and other risk fac-
tors (age, gender, hypertension, smoking). This personalized
reporting of desirable values is difficult to implement in laboratory
reports because usually the clinical conditions and risk factors of the
individual patient are not known to the laboratory professional. We
therefore propose a simplified system of flagging abnormal values
based on desirable concentration cut-points for moderate risk
only, which may be complemented by more detailed information
on risk stratified cut-offs in footnotes on the laboratory report or
by references to web-based information of the same laboratory.
Using such flagging emphasizes the importance of harmonization
and standardization in laboratory medicine, and the responsibility
of EAS and EFLM to communicate to laboratories when updates
of cut-points are necessary as guidelines for cardiovascular disease
prevention are revised.
According to the flagging of abnormal values based on desirable
concentration cut-points proposed in Table 5, the following percen-
tages of adults in the general population of a typical Western or
Northern European country will have flagged test results in non-
fasting lipid profiles: 27% will have triglycerides ≥2 mmol/L
(175 mg/dL), 72% total cholesterol ≥5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), 60%
LDL cholesterol ≥3 mmol/L (115 mg/dL), 27% calculated remnant
cholesterol ≥0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL), 50% calculated non-HDL
cholesterol ≥3.9 mmol/L (150 mg/dL), 20% Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL
(80th percentile), 59% apolipoprotein B ≥1.0 g/L (100 mg/dL),
10% HDL cholesterol ≤1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL), and 9% will have
apolipoprotein A1 ≤1.25 g/L (125 mg/dL) (Figure 8).
Life-threatening plasma lipid
concentrations—what to do?
Life-threatening or extremely abnormal test results deserve special
attention and reactions of the clinical biochemical laboratory. In this
regard, the following extreme hyperlipidaemias should be noted: tri-
glycerides .10 mmol/L (880 mg/dL) because of risk of acute pan-
creatitis,24 LDL cholesterol .5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) in adults or
.4 mmol/L (155 mg/dL) in children and particularly .13 mmol/L
(500 mg/dL) because of suspicious heterozygous and homozy-
gous familial hypercholesterolaemia,43 – 45 respectively, and Lp(a)
.150 mg/dL (99th percentile) for very high risk of myocardial in-
farction and aortic valve stenosis11,46,47 (Table 8). As such concen-
trations are always much above a common decision cut-point,

 they should be flagged with special symbols to quickly initiate further
diagnostic and possibly therapeutic actions, preferably with direct
referral to a lipid clinic or to a physician with special interest in lipids.
It is also important to refer patients with very low concentrations of
LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, HDL cholesterol, or apolipopro-
tein A1 to a specialist lipid clinic for further evaluation of a major
monogenic disorder of lipid metabolism (Table 8).
Implementation of
recommendations
Each country, state, and/or province in individual countries should
adopt strategies for implementing routine use of non-fasting rather
than fasting lipid profiles as well as flagging of abnormal values based
on desirable concentration cut-points rather than using traditional
reference intervals. Ideally, there should be one standard for report-
ing lipid profiles in each country as also accreditation bodies should
be aware of the present consensus statement. Figure 9 suggests im-
plementation strategies; however, the strategy might differ from
country to country based on existing local practice in relation to
use of non-fasting lipid profiles and flagging of abnormal values based
on desirable concentration cut-points used for assessing cardiovas-
cular risk, making diagnoses, and for initiating lipid-lowering drug
therapy. Finally, within countries with differing ethnic groups, the
policy on non-fasting might need to be further refined. Indeed, e.g.
individuals of South Asian or Latin American descent are more likely
to have severe triglyceride elevations when compared with indivi-
duals of non-Hispanic white and black descent. This could be
another reason to have a caveat about avoiding a high-fat, fast-food
meal on the day of lipid profile testing.
