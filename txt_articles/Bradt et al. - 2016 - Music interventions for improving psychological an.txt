Background
Having cancer may result in extensive emotional, physical and social suffering. Music interventions have been used to alleviate symptoms
and treatment side effects in cancer patients.
Objectives
To assess and compare the effects of music therapy and music medicine interventions for psychological and physical outcomes in people
with cancer.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL,
PsycINFO, LILACS, Science CitationIndex, CancerLit, CAIRSS,ProquestDigital Dissertations, ClinicalTrials.gov, CurrentControlled
Trials, the RILM Abstracts of Music Literature, http://www.wfmt.info/Musictherapyworld/ and the National Research Register. We
searched all databases, except for the last two, from their inception to January 2016; the other two are no longer functional, so we
searched them until their termination date. We handsearched music therapy journals, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts.
There was no language restriction.
Selection criteria
We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of music interventions for improving psychological and physical
outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with cancer. We excluded participants undergoing biopsy and aspiration for diagnostic purposes.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Where possible, we presented results in meta-analyses
using mean differences and standardized mean differences. We used post-test scores. In cases of significant baseline difference, we used
change scores.

 Main results
We identified 22 new trials for inclusion in this update. In total, the evidence of this review rests on 52 trials with a total of 3731
participants. We included music therapy interventions offered by trained music therapists, as well as music medicine interventions,
which are defined as listening to pre-recorded music, offered by medical staff. We categorized 23 trials as music therapy trials and 29
as music medicine trials.
The results suggest that music interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in people with cancer, with a reported average anxiety
reduction of 8.54 units (95% confidence interval (CI) −12.04 to −5.05, P < 0.0001) on the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory - State
Anxiety (STAI-S) scale (range 20 to 80) and −0.71 standardized units (13 studies, 1028 participants; 95% CI −0.98 to −0.43, P <
0.00001; low quality evidence) on other anxiety scales, a moderate to strong effect. Results also suggested a moderately strong, positive
impact on depression (7 studies, 723 participants; standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.40, 95% CI −0.74 to −0.06, P = 0.02;
very low quality evidence), but because of the very low quality of the evidence for this outcome, this result needs to be interpreted with
caution. We found no support for an effect of music interventions on mood or distress.
Music interventions may lead to small reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure but do not appear to impact oxygen
saturation level. We found a large pain-reducing effect (7 studies, 528 participants; SMD: −0.91, 95% CI −1.46 to −0.36, P = 0.001,
low quality evidence). In addition, music interventions had a small to moderate treatment effect on fatigue (6 studies, 253 participants;
SMD: −0.38, 95% CI −0.72 to −0.04, P = 0.03; low quality evidence), but we did not find strong evidence for improvement in
physical functioning.
The results suggest a large effect of music interventions on patients’ quality of life (QoL), but the results were highly inconsistent across
studies, and the pooled effect size for the music medicine and music therapy studies was accompanied by a large confidence interval
(SMD: 0.98, 95% CI −0.36 to 2.33, P = 0.15, low quality evidence). A comparison between music therapy and music medicine
interventions suggests a moderate effect of music therapy interventions for patients’ quality of life (QoL) (3 studies, 132 participants;
SMD: 0.42, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.78, P = 0.02; very low quality evidence), but we found no evidence of an effect for music medicine
interventions. A comparison between music therapy and music medicine studies was also possible for anxiety, depression and mood,
but we found no difference between the two types of interventions for these outcomes.
The results of single studies suggest that music listening may reduce the need for anesthetics and analgesics as well as decrease recovery
time and duration of hospitalization, but more research is needed for these outcomes.
We could not draw any conclusions regarding the effect of music interventions on immunologic functioning, coping, resilience or
communication outcomes because either we could not pool the results of the studies that included these outcomes or we could only
identify one trial. For spiritual well-being, we found no evidence of an effect in adolescents or young adults, and we could not draw
any conclusions in adults.
The majority of studies included in this review update presented a high risk of bias, and therefore the quality of evidence is low.
Authors’ conclusions
This systematic review indicates that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue and QoL in people with
cancer. Furthermore, music may have a small effect on heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure. Most trials were at high risk of
bias and, therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution.

Can music interventions benefit cancer patients?
The issue
Cancer may result in extensive emotional, physical and social suffering. Current cancer care increasingly incorporates psychosocial
interventions to improve quality of life. Music therapy and music medicine interventions have been used to alleviate symptoms and
treatment side effects and address psychosocial needs in people with cancer. In music medicine interventions, the patient simply listens
to pre-recorded music that is offered by a medical professional. Music therapy requires the implementation of a music intervention by
a trained music therapist, the presence of a therapeutic process and the use of personally tailored music experiences.

Music interventions for improving psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2011, which included 30 studies and found support for an effect of music
interventions on several psychological and physical outcomes. For this review update, we searched for additional trials studying the
effect of music interventions on psychological and physical outcomes in people with cancer. We searched for published and ongoing
studies up to January 2016. We considered all studies in which music therapy or music medicine was compared with standard treatment
alone or standard care combined with other treatments or placebo.
What are the main findings?
We identified 22 new studies, so the evidence in this review update now rests on 52 studies with 3731 participants. The findings suggest
that music therapy and music medicine interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety, pain, fatigue, heart rate, respiratory rate
and blood pressure in people with cancer. Because of the very low quality of the evidence for depression, it is unclear what impact music
interventions may have. Music therapy but not music medicine interventions may improve patients’ quality of life. We did not find
evidence that music interventions improve mood, distress or physical functioning, but only a few trials studied these outcomes. We could
not draw any conclusions about the effect of music interventions on immunologic functioning, coping, resilience or communication
outcomes because there were not enough trials looking at these aspects. Therefore, more research is needed.
No adverse effects of music interventions were reported.
Quality of the evidence
Most trials were at high risk of bias, so these results need to be interpreted with caution. We did not identify any conflicts of interests
in the included studies.
What are the conclusions?
We conclude that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in people with
cancer. Furthermore, music may have a small positive effect on heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure. Reduction of anxiety,
fatigue and pain are important outcomes for people with cancer, as they have an impact on health and overall QoL. Therefore, we
recommend considering the inclusion of music therapy and music medicine interventions in psychosocial cancer care.

Description of the condition
The lifetime risk of developing any type of cancer is 44% for
men and 38% for women (NCI 2010), and a diagnosis of cancer
may result in extensive emotional, physical and social suffering.
Many symptoms and treatment side effects have an impact on
cancer patients’ physical well-being and quality of life (QoL), in-
cluding appetite disturbance, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vom-
iting, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea or difficulty breathing, fa-
tigue, insomnia, muscle weakness and numbness (King 2003).
In addition, study findings clearly indicate that people with can-
cer experience elevated levels of psychological distress and depres-
sion in response to diagnosis and treatment (van’t Spijker 1997;
Massie 2004; Norton 2004; Parle 1996; Raison 2003; Sellick
1999). The actual experience of chemotherapy-induced side ef-
fects, such as nausea and vomiting, and their influence on psy-
chological well-being varies widely in patients receiving the same
cytotoxic agents. This suggests that non-pharmacological factors
possibly play an important role in how patients experience or inter-
pret physical symptoms during the treatment phase (Montgomery
2000; Thune-Boyle 2006). It is therefore important that cancer
care incorporates services that help meet patients’ psychological,
social and spiritual needs.
Description of the intervention
The use of music in cancer care can be situated along a continuum
of care, namely from music listening initiated by patients, to pre-
recordedmusicofferedbymedical personnel, tomusicpsychother-
apy interventions offered by a trained music therapist. Therefore,
when examining the efficacy of music interventions with cancer
patients, it is important to make a clear distinction between music
interventions administered by medical or healthcare professionals
(music medicine) and those implemented by trained music thera-
pists (music therapy). A substantive body of evidence suggests that
music therapy interventions provided by medical professionals are
significantly more effective than music medicine interventions for
a wide variety of outcomes (Dileo 2005). This difference might
be attributed to the fact that music therapists individualize their
interventions to meet patients’ specific needs, more actively engage
the patients in music making, and employ a systematic therapeu-
tic process including assessment, treatment and evaluation. Dileo
1999 categorizes interventions as music medicine when medical
personnel offer pre-recorded music for passive listening. For ex-
ample, they may offer people a CD for relaxation or distraction;
however, no systematic therapeutic process is present, nor is there a
systematic assessment of the elements and suitability of the music
stimulus. In contrast, music therapy requires the implementation
of a music intervention by a trained music therapist, the presence
of a therapeutic process and the use of personally tailored music
experiences.
These music experiences include:
• listening to live, improvised or pre-recorded music;
• performing music on an instrument;
• improvising music spontaneously using voice, instruments
or both;
• composing music;
• combining music with other therapeutic modalities (e.g.
movement, imagery, art) (Dileo 2007).
How the intervention might work
Music interventions have been used in different medical fields to
meet patients’ psychological, physical, social and spiritual needs.
Research on the effects of music and music therapy for medical pa-
tients has burgeoned over the past 20 years, examining a variety of
outcome measures in a wide range of specialty areas (Dileo 2005).
For both adult and pediatric cancer patients, music has been used
to decrease anxiety prior to or during surgical procedures (Burns
1999; Haun 2001; Pfaff 1989), to decrease stress during chemo-
therapy or radiation therapy (Clark 2006; Weber 1996), to lessen
treatmentside effects(Bozcuk 2006; Ezzone 1998; Frank 1985), to
improve mood (Bailey 1983 Barrera 2002; Burns 2001a; Cassileth
2003), to enhance pain management (Akombo 2006; Beck 1989),
to improve immune system functioning (Burns 2001a; Camprubi
1999), and to improve quality of life (QoL) (Burns 2001a; Hilliard
2003).
There are inherent elements of music-such as rhythm and tempo,
mode, pitch, timbre, melody and harmony-that are known to in-
fluence physiological and psycho-emotional responses in humans.
For example, music has been found to arouse memory and as-
sociation, stimulate imagery, evoke emotions, facilitate social in-
teraction, and promote relaxation and distraction (Dileo 2006).
In cancer settings, music therapists conduct ongoing assessments
and utilize various individualized interventions in people with
cancer and their families, including pertinent elements of music
within the context of therapeutic relationships, to address pre-
vailing biopsychosocial and spiritual issues, symptoms and needs
(Magill 2009; McClean 2012). The following music therapy in-
terventions are common: use of songs (singing, song writing, and
lyric analysis); music improvisation (instrumental and vocal), mu-
sic and imagery, music-based reminiscence and life review, chant-
ing and toning, music-based relaxation, and instrumental partic-
ipation (O’Callaghan 2015). Based on patient preferences and
assessment outcomes, music therapists adapt and modify music
interventions to address symptoms and areas of difficulty; they
utilize music and verbal strategies to provide opportunities for
expression and communication, reminiscence, the processing of
thoughts and emotions and improvement of symptom manage-
ment (Magill 2011). Therapist-supported music therapy environ-
ments often provide the space and time through which patients
6

 and families may experience social connection, improve self fulfil-
ment and acquire effective coping strategies (Magill 2015).
Why it is important to do this review
Several research studies on the use of music with cancer patients
have reported positive results (Beck 1989; Cassileth 2003; Harper
2001; Hilliard 2003; Robb 2008). The majority of these studies,
however, are compromised by small sample size and lack of sta-
tistical power. In addition, differences in factors such as methods
of interventions and type and intensity of treatment have led to
varying results. A systematic review is needed to more accurately
gauge the efficacy of music interventions in cancer patients as well
as to identify variables that may moderate its effects.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and studies with quasi-
randomized methods of treatment allocation (e.g. alternate allo-
cation of treatments) were eligible for inclusion.
Types of participants
This review included participants diagnosed with any type of can-
cer. There were no restrictions as to age, sex, ethnicity or type
of setting. We did exclude participants undergoing biopsy, bone
marrow biopsy and aspiration for diagnostic purposes. This review
did not include studies with cancer survivors.
Types of interventions
The review included all trials comparing standard treatment plus
music therapy or music medicine interventions with:
1. standard care alone;
2. standard care plus alternative intervention (e.g. music
therapy versus music medicine);
3. standard care plus placebo.
Placebo treatment can involve the use of headphones for the pa-
tient without provision of music stimuli or with another type of
auditory stimulus (e.g. audiobooks, white noise (hiss), pink noise
(sound of ocean waves) or nature sounds).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Psychological outcomes (e.g. depression, anxiety, anger,
hopelessness, helplessness)
2. Physical symptoms (e.g. fatigue, nausea, pain)
Secondary outcomes
1. Physiological outcomes (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate,
immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels)
2. Social and spiritual support (e.g. family support,
spirituality, social activity, isolation)
3. Communication (e.g. verbalization, facial affect, gestures)
4. Quality of life (QoL)
Search methods for identification of studies
There were no language restrictions for either searching or trial
inclusion.

In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and on-
going trials, we searched the bibliographies of relevant trials
and reviews, contacted experts in the field, and searched avail-
able proceedings of music therapy conferences. We consulted
music therapy association websites to help identify music ther-
apy practitioners and conference information (e.g. the Ameri-
can Music Therapy Association at www.musictherapy.org and the
British Association for Music Therapy at http://www.bamt.org).
We also handsearched the website of the Deutsches Zentrum
furMusiktherapieforschung(www.dzm-heidelberg.de/forschung/
publikationen/) and the research pages of the PhD programs that
are listed on the website of the European Music Therapy Confed-
eration (emtc-eu.com/music-therapy-research/).
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
We divided the responsibility of the searches, as outlined in the
search strategy, amongst JB, AT and research assistants. JB, AT
and research assistants scanned titles and abstracts of each record
retrieved from the search and deleted obviously irrelevant refer-
ences. When we could not reject a title or abstract with certainty,
we consulted the other review authors. We used an inclusion cri-
teria form to assess the trial’s eligibility for inclusion (Appendix
15). We kept a record of all excluded trials that initially appeared
eligible and the reason for exclusion.
Data extraction and management
JB and AT independently extracted data from the selected trials
using a standardized coding form. We discussed differences in data
extraction until reaching a consensus. We extracted the following

 Outcomes
We extracted pre-test means, post-test means, standard deviations
and sample sizes for the treatment group and the control group
for the following outcomes (if applicable). For some trials only
change scores, instead of post-test scores, were available.
1. Psychological outcomes (e.g. depression, anxiety, anger, hope-
lessness, helplessness)
2. Physical symptoms (e.g. fatigue, nausea, pain)
3. Physiological outcomes (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, im-
munoglobulin A (IgA) levels)
4. Social and spiritual support (e.g. family support, spirituality,
social activity, isolation)
5. Communication (e.g. verbalization, facial affect, gestures)
6. Quality of life
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (JB and CD) assessed all included trials for
risk of bias for the original review. CD and LM conducted the
’Risk of bias’ assessment for new studies included in this update.
All authors were blinded to each other’s assessments. We resolved
any disagreements by discussion. The authors used the following
criteria for quality assessment.
Random sequence generation
• Low risk
• Unclear risk
• High risk
We rated trials to be at low risk for random sequence generation
if every participant had an equal chance to be selected for either
condition and the investigator was unable to predict which treat-
ment the participant would be assigned to. Use of date of birth,
date of admission or alternation resulted in a a judgement of high
risk of bias.
Allocation concealment
• Low risk methods to conceal allocation include:
◦ central randomization;
◦ serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes;
◦ other descriptions with convincing concealment.
• Unclear risk - authors did not adequately report on method
of concealment
• High risk (e.g. trials used alternation methods)
Blinding of participants and personnel
• Low risk
• Unclear risk
• High risk
Since participants cannot be blinded in a music intervention trial,
we did not downgrade studies for not blinding the participants. As
for personnel, in music therapy studies music therapists cannot be
blinded because they are actively making music with the patients.
In contrast, in music medicine studies blinding of personnel is
possible by providing control group participants with headphones
but no music (e.g. blank CD). Therefore, downgrading for not
blinding personnel was only applied in studies that used listening
to pre-recorded music.
Blinding of outcome assessors
• Low risk
• Unclear risk
• High risk
When the study included no objective outcomes, we noted this in
the Characteristics of included studies table, and we rated the trial
as being at low risk of bias for outcome assessment of objective
outcomes. The majority of the studies used self report measures
for subjective outcomes. We rated these studies as being at high
risk of bias for subjective outcomes, unless study participants were
blinded to the study hypothesis (for comparative studies).
Incomplete outcome data
We recorded the proportion of participants whose outcomes were
analyzed. We coded loss to follow-up for each outcome as:
• low risk: if fewer than 20% of patients were lost to follow-
up and reasons for loss to follow-up were similar in both
treatment arms;
• unclear risk: if loss to follow-up was not reported;
• high risk: if more than 20% of patients were lost to follow-
up or reasons for loss to follow-up differed between treatment
arms.
Selective reporting
• Low risk: reports of the study were free from suggestions of
selective outcome reporting
• Unclear risk
• High risk: reports of the study suggest selective outcome
reporting
Other sources of bias
• Low risk
• Unclear risk
• High risk
We considered information on potential financial conflicts of in-
terest to be a possible source of additional bias.
The above criteria were used to give each article an overall quality
rating (based on section 8.7 of the Cochrane Handbook for System-
atic Reviews of Interventions; Higgins 2011).

 • Low risk of bias - all criteria met.
• Moderate risk of bias - one or more of the criteria only
partly met.
• High risk of bias - one or more criteria not met.
Studieswere notexcludedbasedonalowqualityscore. We planned
to use the overall quality assessment rating for sensitivity analysis.
However, since most trials were at high risk of bias, we could not
carry out this analysis.
Measures of treatment effect
We present all outcomes in this review as continuous variables.
We calculated standardized mean differences with 95% confidence
intervals (CI) for outcome measures using results from different
scales. When there were sufficient data available from various stud-
ies using the same measurement instrument, we computed a mean
difference (MD) with 95% CI.
Unit of analysis issues
In all studies included in this review, participants were individually
randomized to the intervention or the standard care control group.
Post-test values or change values on a single measurement for each
outcome from each participant were collected and analyzed.
Dealing with missing data
We did not impute missing outcome data. We analyzed data on
an endpoint basis, including only participants for whom final data
point measurement was available (available case analysis). We did
not assume that participants who dropped out after randomization
had a negative outcome.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We investigated heterogeneity using visual inspection of the forest
plots as well as the I2 statistic (Higgins 2002).
Assessment of reporting biases
We tested for publication bias visually in the form of funnel plots
(Higgins 2011).
Data synthesis
We present all outcomes in this review as continuous variables.
We calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) for outcome
measures using results from different scales. We used mean dif-
ferences (MD) for results using the same scales. We anticipated
that some individual trials would have used final scores and oth-
ers change scores and even analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in
their statistical analyses of the results. We combined these different
types of analyses as MDs. We determined not to pool the results
in case of significant clinical heterogeneity. We calculated pooled
estimates using the more conservative random-effects model. We
calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each effect size esti-
mate. We interpreted the magnitude of the SMDs using the inter-
pretation guidelines put forth by Cohen 1988). Cohen suggested
that an effect size of 0.2 be considered a small effect, an effect size
of 0.5 medium, and an effect size of 0.8 large.
We made the following treatment comparisons in meta-analyses.
1. Music interventions plus standard care versus standard care
alone.
2. Music therapy versus music medicine interventions (this
was only possible for anxiety).
3. Music interventions plus standard care versus standard care
plus alternative relaxation interventions
4. Music interventions plus standard care versus standard care
plus placebo (audiobook control).
Several studies compared music interventions with non-music re-
laxation interventions. However, there was an insufficient number
of trials to allow for a treatment comparison analysis. These studies
are therefore included in the narrative under the third comparison
(music intervention versus alternative intervention) but not in the
meta-analysis of this review.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We conducted the following subgroup analyses within the music
interventions plus standard care versus standard care alone com-
parison for outcomes with a sufficient number of available studies.
1. Music medicine versus music therapy.
2. Type of intervention (e.g. music listening alone versus
music-guided relaxation).
3. Music preference (patient-preferred music versus
researcher-selected music).
We planned the following subgroup analyses a priori, but we could
not carry these out because of insufficient numbers of trials per
outcome for age subgroup analysis and because no separate data
were available according to stage of illness.
1. Different age groups.
2. Stages of illness.
We conducted subgroup analyses as described by Deeks 2001 and
recommended in section 9.6 of Higgins 2011.
Sensitivity analysis
We examined the impact of sequence generation by comparing
the results of including and excluding trials that used inadequate
or unclear randomization methods.

 Results of the search
For the original review, the database searches and handsearching
of conference proceedings, journals and reference lists resulted in
773 unique citations. One review author (JB) and a research as-
sistant examined the titles and abstracts and identified 101 re-
ports as potentially relevant, which we retrieved for further as-
sessment. One review author (JB) and a research assistant then
independently screened them. We included 30 trials, reported
in 36 records, in the original review. Where necessary, we con-
tacted principal investigators to obtain additional details on tri-
als and data. We identified three ongoing trials (NCT02261558;
NCT02583126; NCT02583139). We moved two ongoing stud-
ies from the original review to the ’awaiting assessment’ classifi-
cation (NCT00086762; O’Brien 2010). Unfortunately, we could
not include them in this update as their results were not yet avail-
able for inclusion. We classified four additional studies as awaiting
assessment because their results were not yet published, and the
authors could not provide the results for inclusion in this review.
The 2016 update of the search resulted in 1187 unique citations.
Two review authors (JB and AT) and one research assistant exam-
ined the titles and abstracts, retrieving full-text articles where nec-
essary. This resulted in the addition of 25 references reporting on
22 trials (Figure 1) and three new ongoing trials (NCT02261558;
NCT02583126; NCT02583139).

 Included studies
We included 52 trials with a total of 3731 participants. Seventeen
trials included participants who underwent chemotherapy or radi-
ation therapy (Bradt 2015; Bulfone 2009; Burrai 2014; Cai 2001;
Chen 2013; Clark2006; Ferrer 2005; Gimeno 2008; Jin 2011; Lin
2011; Moradian 2015; O’Callaghan 2012; Romito 2013; Smith
2001; Straw 1991; Xie 2001; Zhao 2008), 20 trials examined the
effects of music during procedures or surgery (Binns-Turner 2008;
Bufalini 2009; Burns 2009; Cassileth 2003; Danhauer 2010;
Fredenburg 2014a; Fredenburg 2014b; Kwekkeboom 2003; Li
2004; Li 2012; Nguyen 2010; Palmer 2015; Pinto 2012; Ratcliff
2014; Robb 2014; Rosenow 2014; Vachiramon 2013; Wang 2015;
Yates 2015; Zhou 2015), and 14 trials included general cancer pa-
tients (Beck 1989; Burns 2001a; Burns 2008; Chen 2004; Cook
2013; Duocastella 1999; Hanser 2006; Harper 2001; Hilliard
2003; Huang 2006; Liao 2013; Robb 2008; Shaban 2006; Wan
2009). Five trials examined music interventions in pediatric pa-
tients (Bufalini 2009; Burns 2009; Duocastella 1999; Nguyen
2010; Robb 2014).
This review included 2090 females and 1171 males. Five tri-
als did not provide information on the distribution between
sexes (Danhauer 2010; Jin 2011; Robb 2008; Shaban 2006; Xie
2001). The average age of the participants was 54.67 years for
adult trials and 10.93 years for pediatric trials. Seventeen stud-
ies did not report on the ethnicity of the participants (Burns
2001a; Burns 2008; Burrai 2014; Cassileth 2003; Chen 2013;
Cook 2013; Duocastella 1999; Ferrer 2005; Lin 2011; Moradian
2015; O’Callaghan 2012; Robb 2008; Romito 2013; Straw 1991;
Vachiramon 2013; Wang 2015; Zhou 2015). For trials that did
provide information on ethnicity, the distribution was as follows:
50% white, 32% Asian, 7% black, 8% Latino, and 3% other.
The trials took place in nine different countries: the United States
(Bradt 2015; Beck 1989; Binns-Turner 2008; Burns 2001a; Burns
2008; Burns 2009; Cassileth 2003; Clark 2006; Cook 2013;

Robb 2014; Rosenow 2014; Smith 2001; Straw 1991; Vachiramon
2013; Yates 2015), China (Cai 2001; Chen 2004; Jin 2011; Li
2004; Li 2012; Liao 2013; Wan 2009; Xie 2001; Zhao 2008),
Italy (Bufalini 2009; Bulfone 2009), Iran (Moradian 2015; Shaban
2006), Spain (Duocastella 1999), Taiwan (Chen 2013; Huang
2006; Lin 2011; Wang 2015; Zhou 2015), Brazil (Pinto 2012),
Australia (O’Callaghan 2012) and Vietnam (Nguyen 2010). Trial
sample size ranged from 8 to 260 participants.
We classified 23 trials as music therapy studies (Bradt 2015;
Bufalini 2009; Burns 2001a; Burns 2008; Burns 2009; Cassileth
2003; Clark 2006; Cook 2013; Duocastella 1999; Ferrer 2005;
Fredenburg 2014a; Fredenburg 2014b; Hanser 2006; Hilliard
2003; Gimeno 2008; Palmer 2015; Ratcliff 2014; Robb 2008;
Robb 2014; Romito 2013; Rosenow 2014; Stordahl 2009; Yates
2015). Of these trials, nine used interactive music making with
the participants, four used music-guided imagery, two used music-
guided relaxation, six used live patient-selected music performed
by the music therapist and two used music video making. We clas-
sified 29 trials as music medicine studies, as defined by the authors
in the background section, and used listening to pre-recorded mu-
sic as the intervention.
Frequency and duration of treatment sessions greatly varied among
the trials. The total number of sessions ranged from 1 to 40
(e.g. multiple music listening sessions per day for length of hos-
pital stay). Most sessions lasted 30 to 45 minutes. We report de-
tails on frequency and duration of sessions for each trial in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
Forty-nine trials used parallel group designs, whereas three trials
used a cross-over design (Bradt 2015; Beck 1989; Gimeno 2008).
Not all trials measured all outcomes identified for this review.
We show details of the trials included in the review in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
Excluded studies
In the original review, 27 of the 101 reports that we retrieved for
further assessment turned out not to be outcome research studies.
We identified 38 experimental research studies that appeared eli-
gible for inclusion. However, we excluded these after closer exam-
ination or after receiving additional information from the prin-
cipal investigators. Reasons for exclusions were: not a random-
ized or quasi-randomized controlled trial (29 studies); insufficient
data reporting (2 studies); unacceptable methodological quality (3
studies); not a music intervention (1 study); not exclusively cancer
patients (1 study); and article could not be located (2 studies).
For the update, we retrieved 94 reports for further assessment. We
excluded 60 studies for the following reasons: not a randomized
or quasi-randomized controlled trial (36 studies), insufficient data
reporting (2 studies), not music intervention (12 studies), not
population of interest (8 studies), use of healthy controls (1 study),
and use of non-standardized measurement tools (1 study).
For studies with insufficient data reporting or those that could
not be located, we attempted to contact the authors on multiple
occasions.
Details about reasons for exclusion are provided in the
Characteristics of excluded studies table.
Risk of bias in included studies
We detail the risk of bias for each trial in the ’Risk of bias’ tables
included in the Characteristics of included studies table and the
’Risk of bias summary’ (Figure 2). In addition, readers can consult
an overall assessment of risk of bias in Figure 3.

Allocation
We included 37 trials that used appropriate methods of random-
ization (e.g. computer-generated table of random numbers, draw-
ing of lots, coin flip), 6 trials that used systematic methods of treat-
ment allocation (e.g. alternate group assignment, date of birth),
and 9 trials that reported using randomization but failed to state
the randomization method.
Twenty-two trials concealed allocation, whereas 12 trials did not.
For the remainder of the trials, authors did not mention allocation
concealment.
Blinding
Fifteen trials included objective outcomes, but only four of them
reported blinding of the outcome assessors. For six trials, the use
of blinding was unclear. The other trials did not use blinding.
The majority of the trials included subjective outcomes only. It is
important to point out that blinding of outcome assessors is not
possible in the case of self report measurement tools for subjective
outcomes (e.g. STAI; Spielberger 1983) unless the participants are
blinded to the intervention. Blinding of the participants is often
not feasible in music therapy and music medicine studies. This
may introduce possible bias.
Incomplete outcome data
The dropout rate was small for most trials, falling between 0%
and 17%. Ten trials reported dropout rates of more than 20%.
For 14 trials, it was unclear whether there were any partici-
pant withdrawals. Most trials reported reasons for dropout. De-
tailed information on dropout rate and reasons is included in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
Selective reporting
We did not find any evidence of selective reporting by the authors.
We examined publication bias visually in the form of funnel plots
for several of the included outcomes. Visual inspection suggested
thatthere wasnopublicationbiasforanxiety(Figure 4), depression
(Figure 5), pain (Figure 6), and heart rate (Figure 7). We did detect
a possible publication bias for fatigue (Figure 8), but this was based
on a small number of trials. For this outcome, it is possible that
studies that did not result in statistically significant findings may
not have been published.

Other potential sources of bias
We did not identify any other potential sources of bias in the
studies included in this review.
As a result, only one trial was at low risk of bias (Bradt 2015). Two
additional trials were at low risk of bias for objective outcomes,
as they satisfied all criteria used to assess risk of bias (Duocastella
1999; Nguyen 2010). Forty-six trials were at high risk of bias.
Three trials were at moderate risk of bias (Binns-Turner 2008;
Hilliard 2003; Palmer 2015). The main reason for receiving a high
risk of bias rating was the lack of blinding. As pointed out above,
blinding is often impossible in music therapy and music medicine
studies that use subjective outcomes, unless the studies compare
the music intervention with another active treatment interven-
tion (e.g. progressive muscle relaxation). This is especially true for
music therapy studies that use active music-making. Therefore, it
appears impossible for these types of studies to receive a low or
even moderate risk of bias even if they have adequately addressed
all other risk factors (e.g. randomization, allocation concealment,
etc.).
It is worth noting that the Chinese trials were particularly prob-
lematic in terms of providing sufficient information regarding risk
of bias. It is unclear, however, if this was due to incomplete trans-
lations or lack of detail in the original trial reports.

 State anxiety
Twenty-three trials examined the effects of music interventions
plus standard care compared to standard care alone for anxiety
in participants with cancer. Fifteen trials measured anxiety by
means of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Anx-
iety form (STAI-S) (Binns-Turner 2008; Bufalini 2009; Bulfone
2009; Chen 2013; Danhauer 2010; Harper 2001; Jin 2011;
Kwekkeboom 2003; Li 2012; Lin 2011; O’Callaghan 2012; Smith
2001; Vachiramon 2013; Wan 2009; Zhou 2015); one trial used
the STAI-short form (Nguyen 2010); and eight trials reported
mean anxiety measured by other scales, such as a numeric rating
scale or a visual analogue scale (Cai 2001; Cassileth 2003; Ferrer
2005; Hanser 2006; Li 2004; Palmer 2015; Yates 2015; Zhao
2008). We could not include the data from Burns 2008 because
it did not report post-test or follow-up scores. The author did
provide follow-up scores (4 weeks postintervention), but we could
not combine these with the post-test scores of the other trials.
Moreover, Burns 2008 reported a large moderating effect of pre-
intervention affect state scores on post-test scores and follow-up
scores. We also did not include the data from Kwekkeboom 2003
in the meta-analysis because this study was affected by a serious
flaw in the implementation of the intervention. Participants in
this trial listened to music while undergoing painful medical pro-
cedures. However, they reported that the use of headphones pre-
vented them from hearing the surgeon, increasing their anxiety.
Finally, we report the data from Hanser 2006 narratively but do
not include them in the meta-analysis because of the high attrition
rate (40%). In addition, the researchers experienced serious issues
with intervention implementation within the predetermined im-
plementation timeframe (three sessions were implemented over a
15-week period), and the authors concluded that the intervention
was significantly diluted because of this.
A meta-analysis of 13 trials that used the full STAI-S (score range:
20 to 80) to examine state anxiety in 1028 participants indicated
a significantly lower state of anxiety in participants who received
standard care combined with music interventions than those who
received standard care alone ( MD: −8.54, 95% CI −12.04 to
−5.05, P < 0.0001; Analysis 1.1). Statistical heterogeneity across
the trials (I2 = 93%) was due to some trials reporting much larger
beneficial effects of music interventions than others (Binns-Turner
2008; Harper 2001; Wan 2009). In Kwekkeboom 2003, partici-
pants in the music listening group reported higher levels of anxi-
ety at post-test (mean: 33.45, standard deviation (SD) 1.77) than
those in the standard care group (mean: 30.59, SD 1.93), but this
difference was not statistically significant. A sensitivity analysis ex-
cluding the trials that used inadequate methods of randomization
(Bulfone 2009; Chen 2013), or for which the method of random-
ization was unclear (Bufalini 2009), had minimal impact on the
pooled effect size (MD: −8.64, 95% CI −12.50 to −4.79, P <
0.0001, I2 = 94%; Analysis 1.1).
The standardized mean difference (SMD) of trials that reported
post-testanxietyscoresonmeasuresotherthanthe full-formSTAI-
S (N = 449) also suggested a moderate to large anxiety-reduc-
ing effect of music (SMD: −0.71, 95% CI −0.98 to −0.43, P
<.00001; Analysis 1.2; Cai 2001; Ferrer 2005; Li 2004; Nguyen
2010; Zhao 2008; Yates 2015). The results were consistent across
the trials (I2 = 41%). We did not include the data of two trials
in the meta-analysis because change scores and final scores should
not be combined for the computation of a SMD (Cassileth 2003;
Palmer 2015). However, the data by Cassileth 2003 were consis-
tent with the results of the meta-analysis, reporting a greater ef-
fect of music therapy on anxiety (mean change score: −2.6, SD
2.5) than standard care alone (mean change score: −0.9, SD 3.0)
on the POMS-anxiety subscale (score range: 0 to 36). Likewise,
the data from Palmer 2015 indicated a beneficial effect of mu-
sic therapy (mean change score: −30.9, SD 36.3) versus standard
care (mean change score: 0, SD 22.7) on the Global Anxiety-VAS
(score range: 0 to 100 mm). A sensitivity analysis to examine the
impact of randomization method, excluding the data of Cai 2001,
Ferrer 2005 and Li 2004, resulted in a larger SMD of −0.80 (95%
CI −1.44 to −0.16, P = 0.01; Analysis 1.2), but the results were
no longer consistent across studies (I2 = 66%).
Next, we conducted several a priori determined subgroup analyses
as outlined in the Methods.
First, we compared the treatment benefits of music therapy versus
music medicine studies for anxiety. We only included studies that
reported post-test scores in this analysis to allow for computation
of a standardized mean difference across studies. The pooled effect
of three music therapy studies (SMD: −0.62, 95% CI −1.01 to
−0.24, P=0.001,I2 =0%; Bufalini 2009; Ferrer2005; Yates2015)
was smaller than of the music medicine studies (SMD: −1.00,
95% CI −1.45 to −0.55, P < 0.0001, I2 = 93%; Binns-Turner
2008;Bulfone 2009; Cai 2001; Danhauer2010; Jin 2011; Li2004;
Li 2012; Lin 2011; Nguyen2010; O’Callaghan2012; Smith2001;
Vachiramon 2013; Wan 2009; Zhao 2008; Zhou 2015). However,
this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.21). It is worth
noting that the results of the music therapy studies were consistent
across studies, whereas the results of the music medicine studies
were highly heterogeneous (Analysis 1.3).
Second, we compared studies that used patient-preferred music
with studies that used researcher-selected music. For this compar-
ison, we only included studies that used listening to pre-recorded
music as the intervention. Music preference did not appear to im-
pactthe treatmentbenefitsforanxiety. The use of patient-preferred
music resulted in a SMD of −0.86 (95% CI −1.38 to −0.34, P =
0.001, I2 = 92%) whereas researcher-selected music resulted in a
SMD of −0.89 (95% CI −1.43 to −0.35, P = 0.001, I2 = 71%)
(Analysis 1.4).
Finally, we compared the music medicine studies by type of inter-
vention (e.g. music-guided relaxation, music listening alone, etc.).
We could not conduct this subgroup analysis for music therapy
studies because of an insufficient number of trials. The majority of
the music medicine studies used listening to pre-recorded music.
Four studies, however, embedded relaxation or imagery instruc-
20

 tions within the pre-recorded music (Jin 2011; Lin 2011; Wan
2009; Zhou 2015). The pooled effect of these four studies (SMD:
−1.61, 95% CI −2.56 to −0.65, P = 0.0009, I2 = 95%) was much
larger than that of music listening only studies (SMD: −0.71,
95% CI −1.16 to −0.26, P = 0.002, I2 = 89%) but because of the
large heterogeneity, this difference was not statistically significant
(P = 0.10) (Analysis 1.5).
Depression
Seven trials examined the effects of music plus standard care com-
pared to standard care alone on depression in 723 participants
(Cai 2001; Cassileth 2003; Clark 2006; Li 2012; Wan 2009; Yates
2015; Zhou 2015). Their pooled estimate indicated a moderate
treatment effect of music (SMD: −0.40, 95% CI −0.74 to −0.06,
P = 0.02; Analysis 1.6), but the results were inconsistent across
trials (I2 = 77%). A sensitivity analysis examining the impact of
randomization method did not have much impact on the pooled
effect size (SMD: −0.37, 95% CI −0.79 to 0.05, P = 0.08, I2 =
81%; Analysis 1.6).
A subgroup analysis revealed that there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference between music therapy and music medicine stud-
ies for the outcome of depression (P = 0.12) (Analysis 1.7). We
also examined the impact of music preference in studies that used
listening to pre-recorded music. Although the difference between
studies that used patient-preferred versus researcher-selected mu-
sic was not statistically significant (P = 0.25), allowing patients to
select music from a variety of styles offered by the researcher re-
sulted in a large effect size that was statistically significant (SMD:
−0.88, 95% CI −1.67 to −0.09, P = 0.003, I2 = 89%; Analysis
1.8). In contrast, the use of researcher-selected music resulted in a
small effect size that was not statistically significant (SMD: −0.32,
95% CI −0.84 to 0.19, P = 0.22, I2 = 61%).
Distress
Clark 2006 compared standard care plus music-guided relaxation
versus standard care alone and reported a reduction of −2.03 (SD
2.46) on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale in the music therapy
intervention group. Participants in the control group reported an
average reduction in distress of −2.44 (SD 2.55).
Mood
The pooled estimate of five trials (N = 236) resulted in a moderate
effect of music interventions for mood in participants with cancer
(SMD: 0.47, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.97, P = 0.06; Analysis 1.9;
Beck 1989; Burrai 2014; Cassileth 2003; Moradian 2015; Ratcliff
2014).The results were inconsistent across studies (I2 = 70%),
with Burrai 2014 reporting much larger treatment benefits than
the other studies. A sensitivity analysis based on randomization
method slightly increased the pooled effect (SMD: 0.57, 95% CI
−0.03 to 1.18, P = 0.06, I2 = 74%; Analysis 1.9). We could not
include the data from Burns 2001a in the meta-analysis because
the authors did not use a constant in the computation of their
scores, as recommended in the Profile of Mood States (POMS)
scoring guide (McNair 1971). The results of the meta-analysis
were robust to Burns 2001a, which reported a mean post-test score
of −48.25 (SD 32.96) for the music therapy group and a mean
post-test score of 20.75 (SD 30.87) for the control group.
A subgroup analysis comparing music therapy (SMD: 0.37, 95%
CI −0.13 to 0.87, P = 0.15) with music medicine (SMD: 0.55,
95% CI −0.37 to 1.47, P = 0.24) found no statistically significant
differences between the two types of studies (P = 0.73), but the
results of the music therapy studies were consistent across studies
(I2 = 37%), whereas the music medicine studies were inconsistent
across studies (I2 = 82%) (Analysis 1.10).
Resilience
One music therapy study in 80 adolescents and young adults un-
dergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) included re-
silience as an outcome and reported a small effect for the music
therapy intervention (SMD: 0.21), although this effect was not
statistically significant (P = 0.35) (Robb 2014). The authors re-
ported that the study was underpowered to detect medium and
small effect sizes.
Coping
Robb 2014 also examined the effect of music therapy on coping.
They reported a moderate effect size for courageous coping imme-
diately post-transplant. At the same time, they found no change in
the use of defensive coping strategies, suggesting that adolescents
and youth in the music therapy treatment arm increased their use
of positive coping strategies.
Physical symptoms
Pain
Eleven trials compared the effects of music versus standard care
on pain (Beck 1989; Binns-Turner 2008; Clark 2006; Danhauer
2010; Fredenburg 2014a; Huang 2006; Kwekkeboom 2003; Li
2012; Moradian 2015; Nguyen 2010; Wan 2009). We could
not include the data from Beck 1989, Clark 2006 or Moradian
2015 in the meta-analysis because of the use of change scores.
21
Music interventions for improving psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Kwekkeboom 2003 compared the effects of music listening, au-
diotape and standard care on procedural pain and anxiety, find-
ing that participants did not like wearing the headsets as it pre-
vented them from hearing the surgeon, causing greater anxiety.
The literature suggests that increased anxiety leads to increased
pain perception (McCracken 2009); therefore, we excluded these
data from the meta-analysis. The pooled effect of the remaining
seven studies with 528 participants resulted in a large effect for
music on pain perception (SMD: −0.91, 95%CI −1.46 to −0.36,
P = 0.001; Analysis 1.11; Cohen 1988). There was disagreement
between the trials on the size of the effect (I2 = 88%), but this was
due to Li 2012 reporting much larger treatment benefits than the
other trials.
Using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, Clark 2006 found that mu-
sic therapy resulted in greater pain reduction (mean change score:
−0.44, SD 2.55) than standard care (mean change score: 0.45,
SD 1.87). Likewise, Beck 1989 reported a greater pain reduc-
tion for the music listening group as measured by a 100mm VAS
(mean change score: −9.27, SD 18.86) than for the control group
(meanchange score: −5.69, SD17.9). Incontrast, Moradian 2015
reported similar improvements in pain for the treatment (mean
change score: −12.96, SD 24.16) and the control group (mean
change score: −13.58, SD 28.51).
For this outcome, we were able to examine the impact of music
preference on treatment effect (Analysis 1.12). Although the dif-
ference between the use of patient-preferred music and researcher-
selected music was not statistically significant (P = 0.42), the use
of patient-preferred music led to a much larger and statistically
significant pooled effect (SMD: −1.06, 95% CI −1.93 to −0.2, P
= 0.02, I2 = 91%) than the use of researcher-selectedmusic (SMD:
−0.59, 95% CI −1.34 to 0.15, P = 0.12, I2 = 75%). The large
heterogeneity was due to some studies reporting a much larger
beneficial effect than others.
Fatigue
Six trials examined the effects of music interventions on fatigue
in 253 participants (Cassileth 2003; Clark 2006; Ferrer 2005;
Fredenburg 2014b; Moradian 2015; Rosenow 2014). The pooled
estimate of their change scores indicated a small to moderate effect
for music interventions (SMD: −0.38, 95% CI −0.72 to −0.04,
P = 0.03; Analysis 1.13), with consistent results across studies (I
2 = 38%). Burns 2008 also collected data on fatigue; however,
investigators did not report postintervention data. Burns 2008 also
provided us with four-week postintervention follow-up scores, but
could not provide the immediate post-test scores. This prevented
us from pooling their data with data from the other three studies.
A sensitivity analysis based on randomization method suggested
that use of proper methods of randomization resulted in a smaller
pooled effect that was no longer statistically significant (SMD:
−0.20, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.08, P = 0.16, I2 = 0%).
Physical functioning
Five trials examined the effects of music on participants’ physical
functioning (Hanser 2006; Hilliard 2003; Liao 2013; Moradian
2015; Xie 2001). We could not include the results of Hanser 2006
in the pooled estimate because of the use of change scores and the
high attrition rate. The pooled estimate of the remaining studies
indicated no evidence for an effect of music on physical status in
493 participants with cancer (SMD: 0.78, 95% CI −0.74 to 2.31,
P = 0.31; Analysis 1.14). The results were highly inconsistent (I2
= 98%), with Xie 2001 reporting a much larger beneficial effect.
In Hanser 2006, music therapy led to a greater improvement in
physical well-being (FACT-G Physical Well-Being Subscale, score
range: 0 to 28)( mean change score: 2.0, SD 4.6) than standard
care (mean change score: −0.4, SD 3.7), but this difference was
not statistically significant.
Removing Xie 2001 because of improper randomization method
resulted in a small effect that was consistent across studies (SMD:
0.08, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.34, P = 0.54, I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.14)
Anesthetic and analgesic intake
Two studies included use of anesthesia and analgesics as an out-
come. Palmer 2015 examined the amount of propofol needed
to reach a sedation score of 70 on the Bispectral Index (BIS) in
women undergoing breast surgery. A BIS reading of 70 represents
moderate sedation. The average propofol needed in the live music
group (n = 67) was 67.2 mg (SD 53.7), 61.9 mg (SD 34.1) in
the recorded music group (n = 65), and 70.5 mg (SD 35.2) in the
usual care group (n = 62). However, the difference between the
groups was not statistically significant. Wang 2015 examined the
impact of music-guided relaxation compared to standard care on
postoperative consumption of the sufentanil, a narcotic medicine,
and use of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Partici-
pants in the music treatment arm consumed a significantly smaller
amount of sufentanil (52.68 µg, SD 7.07) than the standard care
treatment arm (82.65 µg, SD 6.19). PCA use was also significantly
lower in the music treatment arm (19.06, SD 3.49) than in the
control group (30.96, SD 4.0).
Length of hospital stay and recovery time
Palmer 2015 also examined the effect of music on recovery time
following breast surgery. Recovery time was defined as the interval
between surgery end time and the time when the patient had met
all discharge criteria determined by the recovery nurse. The results
indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in
recovery time between the two types of music interventions (live
music by a music therapist and listening to pre-recorded music)
and the usual care group, suggesting that the addition of music
intervention did not increase patient time commitment. A sta-
tistically significant difference was found between the live music
22

 group (52.4 minutes, SD 21.6) and the recorded music group
(64.8 minutes, SD 35.3), with the live music group getting dis-
charged approximately 12 minutes faster than the recorded music
group. However, the authors suggest a careful interpretation of
these results as other factors could have contributed to this differ-
ence.
Li 2012 tracked the length of women’s hospital stay after radical
mastectomy. Women in the music listening treatment arm stayed
an average of 13.62 days (SD 2.04), whereas women in the usual
care control arm stayed an average of 15.53 days (SD 2.75). This
difference between the treatment arms was statistically significant
(P < 0.001).
Secondary outcomes
Physiological outcomes
Heart rate
Eight trials examined the effects of music on heart rate in 589
participants (Binns-Turner 2008; Burrai 2014; Chen 2013; Ferrer
2005; Harper 2001; Jin 2011; Nguyen 2010; Zhao 2008). All
of the studies except for Ferrer 2005 were music medicine stud-
ies.Their pooled estimate showed a decrease in heart rate, favor-
ing music interventions over standard care (MD: −3.32, 95% CI
−6.21 to −0.44, P = 0.02; Analysis 1.15). However, the results
were inconsistent across studies (I2 = 73%). A sensitivity analysis
excluding Ferrer 2005 and Chen 2013 because of an unknown
randomization method and a lack of proper randomization, re-
spectively, resulted in a larger effect with less heterogeneity (MD:
−4.63, 95% CI −8.18 to −1.09, P = 0.01, I2 = 56%; Analysis
1.15).
A subgroup analysis for music preference indicated that researcher-
selected music led to greater reductions in heart rate (MD: −7.94,
95% CI −15.10 to −0.78, P = 0.03, I2 = 0%) than patient-
preferred music (MD: −3.13, 95% CI −6.54 to 0.27, P = 0.07,
I2 = 82%; Analysis 1.16), but this difference was not statistically
significant (P = 0.23).
One cross-over trial compared the effect of music and imagery
with imagery alone (Gimeno 2008). Both interventions resulted
in statistically significant decreases in heart rate from pre-test to
post-test: the music and imagery group’s mean heart rate dropped
from 89.58 beats per minute (bpm) (SD 17.32) at pre-test to
78.84 bpm (SD 13.46) at post-test; the imagery only group’s mean
heart rate dropped from 93.31 bpm (SD 15.76) to 81.05 bpm
(SD 13.96), but the difference between the two interventions was
not statistically significant.
Respiratory rate
The pooled estimate of four trials (N = 437) did not provide evi-
dence of an effectfor music interventions on respiratory rate (MD:
−1.24, 95% CI −2.54 to 0.06, P = 0.06; Analysis 1.17; Chen
2013; Jin 2011; Nguyen 2010; Zhao 2008), and the studies did
not agree on the size of effect (I2 = 80%). A sensitivity analysis
excluding Chen 2013 because of failure to use a proper method
of randomization resulted in a larger pooled effect that was sta-
tistically significant (MD: −1.83, 95% CI −3.36 to −0.30, P =
0.02, I2 = 52%; Analysis 1.17)
We could not conduct a subgroup analysis based on music pref-
erence for this outcome due to an insufficient number of trials
differentiating music type.
Systolic blood pressure
We found a pooled estimate of −5.40 mmHg (95% CI −8.32
to −2.49, P = 0.0003; N = 559; Analysis 1.18) for systolic blood
pressure (SBP), favoring music interventions (Burrai 2014; Chen
2013; Ferrer 2005; Harper 2001; Jin 2011; Nguyen 2010; Zhao
2008). The results were slightly inconsistent across studies (I2 =
54%). However, excluding Chen 2013 and Ferrer 2005 because
of lack of proper randomization resulted in a larger effect that was
consistent across studies (MD: −7.63 mmHg, 95% CI −10.75 to
−4.52, P < 0.00001, I2 = 11%; Analysis 1.18). All of the studies
except for Ferrer 2005 were music medicine studies.
We conducted a subgroup analysis based on music preference (
Analysis 1.19), and in contrast to the findings for heart rate, this
analysis suggested that patient-preferred music led to greater SBP
reduction (MD: −6.65, 95% CI −10.07 to −3.23, P = 0.0001,
I2 = 64%) than researcher-selected music (MD: −4.72, 95% CI
−10.80 to 1.37, P = 0.13, I2 = 0%). This difference was not
statistically significant (P = 0.59).
Diastolic blood pressure
We found a pooled estimate of −2.35 mmHg (95% CI −5.88
to 1.18; Analysis 1.20) for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in 559
participants (Burrai 2014; Chen 2013; Ferrer 2005; Harper 2001;
Jin 2011; Nguyen 2010; Zhao 2008).The results were inconsistent
across studies (I2 = 91%). Similar to the SBP analysis, excluding
Chen 2013 and Ferrer 2005 in a sensitivity analysis resulted in a
larger MD of −4.94 mmHg (95% CI −7.78 to −2.09) that was
statistically significant (P = 0.0007), and less heterogeneous (I2 =
60%; Analysis 1.20). All of the studies except for Ferrer 2005 were
music medicine studies.
Patient-preferred music resulted in somewhat greater reductions
in DBP (MD: −4.10, 95% CI −8.78 to 0.59, P = 0.09, I2 = 95%;
Analysis 1.21) than researcher-selected music (MD: −2.01, 95%
CI −6.26 to 2.25, P = 0.36, I2 = 0%), but this difference was not
statistically significant (P = 0.52).

 Mean arterial pressure
Binns-Turner 2008 reported on the effects of music on mean arte-
rial pressure (MAP) in 30 participants and found a large decrease
in MAP for the music group (mean change score: −15.1 mmHg,
SD 17.1, 95% CI −23.76 to −6.44). In contrast, participants in
the standard care group experienced an increase in MAP (mean
change score: 4.5 mmHg, SD 15.3, 95% CI −3.25 to 12.25).
Oxygen saturation level
Three trials with 292 participants reported no effects for music
listening on oxygen saturation levels (MD: 0.50%, 95% CI −0.18
to 1.18, P = 0.15, I2 = 78%; Analysis 1.22; Burrai 2014; Chen
2013; Nguyen 2010).
Immune system functioning
Two trials examined the effects of music on immune system func-
tioning. In one trial in 30 children, Duocastella 1999 found that
live music making with children led to a greater increase in Im-
munoglobin A (IgA) levels (mean change score: 7.07 mg/l, SD
34.52)thanengagingchildreninactivitiesthatdidnotinvolve mu-
sic (mean change score: 4.13 mg/l, SD 41.02), but this difference
was not statistically significant. Another trial compared music lis-
tening to standard care in 46 participants and found post-test dif-
ferences for the following indicators of immune system function-
ing: CD3 (music: mean 44, SD 12.62; control: mean 36.73, SD
11.01), CD4/CD8 (music: mean 1.67, SD 0.76; control: mean
1.32, SD 1.01), and natural killer (NK) cell activity (music: mean
25.23, SD 15.20; control: mean 21.36, SD 12.86), indicating a
positive effect of music listening on the immune system in women
with breast cancer (Chen 2004). CD3 and CD4/CD8 are proteins
that play a role in immune system functioning.
Social and spiritual support
Spiritual well-being
Two trials under this comparison assessed spiritual well-being (
Cook 2013; Hanser 2006). One trial compared music therapy
to usual care using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being subscale (FACIT-Sp, score range: 0
to 48) (Hanser 2006). Results indicated no statistically significant
difference between the two groups (music therapy mean change
score: 2.5, SD 8.56; control group mean change score: 0.7, SD
6.95). Cook 2013 compared music therapy with standard care and
reported a greater improvement in the music therapy treatment
arm ( mean change score: 4.4, SD 4.84) than the control arm
(mean change score: 2.0, SD 6.08) on the FACIT-Sp.
Social support
Robb 2014 examined the effect of music therapy on perceived so-
cial support in adolescents and young adults during stem cell trans-
plant. At 100 days post-transplant, participants in the music ther-
apy treatment arm reported significantly greater improvements in
perceived social support (SMD: 0.54, P = 0.028) and family en-
vironment (i.e. family cohesion, family adaptation, family com-
munication, and family strength) (SMD: 0.66, P = 0.008) than
participants in the control group. Qualitative analysis of the mu-
sic videos that accompanied the songs written by the participants
revealed that study participants were “identifying peers (i.e., so-
cial integration), family members (i.e., family environment), and
faith/spirituality (i.e., spiritual perspective) as important sources
of support” (p 916).
Quality of life
Seven trials compared the impact of music interventions to stan-
dard care on QoL (Burns 2001a; Hanser 2006; Hilliard 2003;
Liao 2013; Moradian 2015; Ratcliff 2014; Xie 2001). We did not
include Hanser 2006 in the meta-analysis for reasons discussed
above. Meta-analysis of the remaining six trials (N = 545) resulted
in a heterogeneous SMD of 0.98 (95% CI −0.36 to 2.33, P =
0.15, I2 = 98%; Analysis 1.23; Burns 2001a; Hilliard 2003; Liao
2013; Moradian 2015; Ratcliff 2014; Xie 2001), with Xie 2001
reporting a much larger beneficial effect than the other trials. Re-
moval of this outlier resulted in a small effect size that was homo-
geneous (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.53, P = 0.02, I2 = 0%).
We conducted a sensitivity analysis removing all studies that used
improper methods of randomization. This resulted in a moderate
effect size that was statistically significant (SMD: 0.52, 95% CI
0.01 to 1.02, P = 0.04, I2 = 66%; Analysis 1.23).
A subgroup analysis per intervention type resulted in a homoge-
neous, moderate effect of music therapy on QoL (SMD: 0.42 ,
95% CI 0.06 to 0.78, P = 0.02, I2 = 4%; Analysis 1.24) that was
statistically significant and consistent across studies (Cohen 1988).
In Hanser 2006, music therapy resulted in a greater improvement
in QoL (FACT-G, 0-108) (mean change score: 3.5, SD 13.75)
than standard care (mean change score: 0.9, SD 15.8), but this
difference was not statistically significant. The pooled effect of the
music medicine studies was large but very heterogeneous and not
statistically significant (SMD: 1.33, 95% CI −0.96 to 3.63, P =
0.26, I2 = 99%). The large heterogeneity was due to the outly-
ing values of Xie 2001; removing it from the analysis resulted in
a small effect for the music medicine studies that was consistent
across studies but not statistically significant (SMD: 0.20, 95% CI
−0.11 to 0.51, P = 0.21, I2 = 0%). The difference in treatment
effect between the music therapy studies and the music medicine
studies was statistically significant when we excluded Xie 2001
from the analysis (P = 0.01). With the Xie study included, the
difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.44).

Onlytwostudiesreportedonthe directcomparisonbetweenmusic
therapy and music medicine interventions.
Primary outcomes
Psychological outcomes
Anxiety
Two trials directly compared the effects of music therapy with
music medicine on cancer patients’ anxiety using a 100mm visual
analogue scale (Bradt 2015; Palmer 2015). Both interventions re-
sulted in reduction of anxiety. Whereas music therapy interven-
tions resulted in a greater average anxiety reduction than music
medicine intervention, this difference was not statistically signif-
icant (MD: −3.67, 95% CI −11.68 to 4.35, P = 0.37, I2 = 0%;
Analysis 2.1). However, 77.4% of the participants in the cross-
over trial by Bradt 2015 expressed a preference for receiving music
therapy sessions for the remainder of their cancer treatment or
future treatments. The main reasons cited by participants for this
preferences were that they felt cared for by the music therapist,
enjoyed the interactive and creative music making, and valued the
opportunity for emotional expression and processing.
Comparison 3: Music interventions plus standard care
versus standard care plus alternative relaxation
interventions
Several studies compared music interventions with other relax-
ation interventions such as progressive muscle relaxation, guided
imagery and relaxation, and verbal relaxation instructions. At this
time, only single studies were identified per outcome. This pre-
cluded meta-analysis is results.
Primary outcomes
Psychological outcomes
Anxiety
Straw 1991 compared music listening to guided imagery and re-
laxation training and found that both interventions significantly
reduced state anxiety as measured by the STAI-S (score range 20
to 80) (guided imagery post-test mean: 38.6, SD 10.01; music
listening post-test mean: 34.22, SD 10.12). An ANCOVA anal-
ysis with pre-test anxiety scores as a co-variate indicated that the
difference in effect of the two interventions on state anxiety was
not statistically significant.
Depression
Stordahl 2009 compared music-assisted relaxation with verbal re-
laxation instructions in 20 women with breast cancer and reported
a lower level of depression on the Center for Epidimiologic Dis-
eases - Depression Scale (CES-D, score range 0 to 60) following
treatment in the music-assisted relaxation treatment arm (n = 10;
post-test mean: 6.6, SD 5.02) than in the verbal relaxation treat-
ment arm (n = 10; post-test mean: 9.20, SD 10.96).
Mood
Stordahl 2009 also compared the impact of music-assisted relax-
ation with verbal relaxation instructions on mood in women with
breast cancer and found that music-assisted relaxation resulted in
lower scores (i.e. better mood) on the POMS-SF (score range 14 to
70 as reported in this thesis) (post-test mean: 6.5, SD 5.19) than
verbal relaxation instructions (post-test mean = 8.64, SD 6.42).
Physical symptoms
Pain
Shaban 2006 compared the effects of progressive muscle relaxation
(PMR) to music listening and found that PMR was more effective
in reducing pain (100mm VAS) (mean post-test score: 6.22, SD
2.45) than listening to pre-recorded music (mean post-test score:
4.96, SD 2.76) in 100 participants.
Secondary outcomes
Quality of life
Straw 1991 compared a guided imagery and relaxation interven-
tion to music listening and found that music listening led to a
greater increase in QoL (Functional Living Index, score range 22
to 154) (mean change score: 16.33, SD 20.73) than the guided
imagery and relaxation group (mean change score: 4.6, SD 20.49).

 Comparison 4: Music interventions plus standard care
versus standard care plus placebo control
Only a few trials compared music therapy or music medicine to
a placebo control, The trials examined a limited number of out-
comes, which we describe below.
Primary outcomes
Psychological symptoms
Distress
Two trials examined the effects of music therapy on reduction
of distress, comparing a music video intervention with an audio-
book control condition in adolescents and young adults during
stem cell transplantation (Burns 2009; Robb 2014). In the music
video, participants wrote songs and created accompanying music
videos in collaboration with a music therapist. The pooled effect
of the two trials did not provide support for an effect of music
therapy (SMD: −0.08, 95% CI −0.42 to 0.25, P = 0.62, I2 = 0%;
Analysis 3.1). In Burns 2009, both groups reported an increase
in distress post-intervention scores, which were used in the meta-
analysis. However, follow-up measures at 100 days after the stem-
cell transplantation indicated a lower mean distress score for the
music therapy group (mean: 1.67, SD 0.55) than the audiobook
group (mean: 2.00, SD 0.64).
Secondary outcomes
Social and spiritual support
Spiritual well-being
Burns 2009 and Robb 2014 also examined the effect of a music
videointerventionversusaudiobookcontrol condition on spiritual
well-being in adolescents and young adults. Their pooled estimate
did not find support for an effect of music therapy on spiritual
well-being (SMD: 0.31, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.73, P = 0.15, I2 =
0%; Analysis 3.2).
Communication
One trial in children with cancer compared the effects of one ses-
sion of active music making to music listening and audio story-
books on levels of active engagement and initiation in 55 children
(Robb 2008). Active music therapy sessions led to higher active
engagement (post-test mean: 26.03, SD 4.1) than music listening
(post-test mean: 15.65, SD 6.2, P < 0.0001) or audio storybooks
(post-test mean: 15.17, SD 4.9, P < 0.0001). These differences
were statistically significant. Active music making (post-test mean:
14.19, SD 8.3) and music listening (post-test mean: 15.89, SD
11.2) also increased the child’s initiation behaviour compared to
the audio storybooks (post-test mean: 7.43, SD 6.6). These dif-
ferences were also statistically significant (P = 0.04 and P = 0.002,
respectively).
Quality of life
Burns 2009 compared music therapy to an audiobook control,
finding a small increase in QoL in the music therapy group (Index
of Well-Being, score range 9 - 63) (mean change score: 0.31, SD
1.73, n = 7) and a small decrease in the control group (mean
change score: −0.22, SD 1.24, n = 3). However, the sample size
was too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.

Summary of main results
The results of 19 trials suggest that music therapy and music
medicine interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety
in people with cancer, with a reported anxiety reduction of 8.54
units, on average, on the STAI-S (score range: 20 to 80) scale and
−0.71 standardized units on other anxiety scales which is consid-
ered a moderate to large effect. Although the magnitude of the
effect differed across the studies, the trials agreed on the direction
of the point estimates. These anxiety-reducing results are consis-
tent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews
on the use of music with coronary heart disease patients (Bradt
2013a), with mechanically ventilated patients (Bradt 2014), and
for pre-operative anxiety (Bradt 2013b). A comparison of music
therapy with music medicine trials for anxiety reduction in people
with cancer suggest a moderate treatment effect for music therapy
studies (SMD: −0.62) that was consistent across studies. Music
medicine trials resulted in a larger effect (SMD: −1.0) but results
were highly inconsistent across studies. Cohen 1988 suggested that
an effect size of 0.20 be considered a small effect, an effect size of
0.50 medium, and an effect size of 0.80 large. A direct comparison
of music therapy with music medicine interventions for anxiety
reduction in two studies indicated greater anxiety reduction of
music therapy interventions. It is noteworthy that a large major-
ity of the patients in one of the comparative studies expressed a
preference for the music therapy intervention.
The results of seven studies suggest that music intervention may
reduce depression in people with cancer. The results of a single
study suggest that music therapy may help adolescents and young

 adults employ positive coping strategies during stem cell trans-
plant, a high risk and high intensity treatment. We found no evi-
dence of effect for distress or mood.
As for the effect of music on physical symptoms, the results of
seven trials suggest that music has a large pain-reducing effect of
−0.91 standardized units. The results of single studies suggest that
music listening may reduce the need for anesthetics and analgesics.
Music interventions also had a small to moderate effect on fatigue
(−0.38 standardized units). We found no evidence for an effect of
music on physical status. Reduction of anxiety, depression, fatigue
and pain are important outcomes for people with cancer, as they
have an impact on health and overall QoL.
It is important that careful consideration is given to the im-
plementation of music listening interventions. The results of
Kwekkeboom 2003 indicate that listening to music through head-
phones may be contraindicated during painful procedures because
it prevents the patient from hearing the surgeon’s instructions and
comments. This may greatly increase patients’ anxiety and, con-
sequently, their perceived pain. In this case, it is better to listen to
music without headphones.
Furthermore, results suggest that music interventions may have a
beneficial effect on several physiological responses in patients with
cancer. Listening to music may reduce heart rate by an average of
three to four beats per minute and respiratory rate by an average
of two breaths per minute. These results are consistent with the
findings of a Cochrane systematic review on the use of music with
coronary heart disease patients (Bradt 2013a), which reported a
heart rate reduction of 3.4 bpm and a respiratory rate reduction of
2.5 breaths per minute. Similar results were reported in a Cochrane
review on music interventions for mechanically ventilated patients
(Bradt 2014), namely a mean heart rate reduction of 3.95 bpm
and a mean respiratory rate reduction of 2.87 breaths per minute.
In the case of a resting heart rate within normal range, a reduction
of 4 bpm may not be clinically significant. However, it might
be in the case of a tachycardiac rate. In a study examining the
quantitative relationship between resting heart rate reduction and
clinical benefit, Cucherat 2007 found that each 10 bpm reduction
in heart rate is estimated to reduce the relative risk of cardiac death
by 30%. The results of this review also indicate that listening to
music may have a beneficial effect on SBP
, although we found no
evidence of an effect for DBP
. Trials on music listening with cardiac
patients and mechanically ventilated patients have also reported
reductions in systolic blood pressure (Bradt 2013a; Bradt 2014).
The reduction of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure
corresponds with the anxiety-reducing effects found by subjective
outcome measures in this review.
No evidence of support was found for an effect of music inter-
ventions on oxygen saturation level. Single trials included in this
review found support for a beneficial effect of music on mean ar-
terial pressure and immunologic function.
Music therapy interventions had a moderate effect of 0.42 stan-
dardized units on quality of life, whereas we found no support for
an effect for music medicine studies. Two studies that compared
music therapy with audiobook control in adolescents and young
adults did not find support for spiritual well-being. Two music
therapy studies with adults reported conflicting results for this
outcome. Finally, a single study with adolescents and young adults
during stem cell transplant reported beneficial effects of music
therapy on perceived social support and the family environment.
Subgroup analyses of treatment effects between music therapy and
music medicine studies was possible for four outcomes, namely
anxiety, depression, mood and quality of life. There was a differ-
ence for quality of life, with music therapy studies contributing to
a larger pooled treatment effect than music medicine studies; we
found no difference between music therapy and music medicine
studies for the other outcomes. However, it is worth noting that
for all outcomes, music therapy interventions resulted in consis-
tent findings across studies whereas the results of music medicine
studies were highly heterogeneous for these outcomes.
We could examine the impact of music preference for anxiety,
depression, pain, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Music preference did not impact the effect of music on anxiety. For
the other outcomes, even though there was no difference between
the use of patient-preferred versus researcher-selected music, the
results show some interesting trends. For pain, the use of patient-
preferred music had a much larger impact on pain reduction. In
contrast, no evidence of pain-reducing effect was found for re-
searcher-selected music. For heart rate, researcher-selected music
resulted in a larger and more consistent treatment effect than pa-
tient-preferred music. Interestingly, for blood pressure, patient-
preferred music resulted in a larger treatment effect, but the results
were highly inconsistent across studies. In contrast, researcher-se-
lected music resulted in smaller effect.
For all outcomes, the sensitivity analyses were robust to the original
conclusions.
The Summary of findings for the main comparison provides a
summary of the main results of this review with associated risks.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review included 52 randomized controlled trials and quasi-
randomized trials.
Seventeen trials used listening to pre-recorded music, and 13 trials
used music therapy interventions that actively engaged the patients
(Characteristics of included studies). We were able to compare the
treatment effects of music therapy studies with music medicine
studies for four outcomes. For the other outcomes this was not
possible due to insufficient number of music therapy and music
medicine studies per outcome.
This review included both music therapy and music medicine
studies, as defined in the Background. Music therapists who work
with cancer patients do not limit their interventions to offering
music listening for relaxation purposes. Music therapists are spe-
27

 cially trained clinically and academically to carefully select music
interventions to offer emotional and spiritual support, support
communication with loved ones, enhance a sense of control, and
improve physical well-being in patients with cancer. Comparative
analyses suggest that music therapy interventions are more effec-
tive than music medicine interventions in improving quality of
life. We found no differences between music therapy and music
medicine interventions for other outcomes, but it is worth noting
that the results of music therapy studies were much less heteroge-
neous than those of music medicine studies. This is likely due to
the fact that music therapists are trained to meet the individual
needs of patients through music interventions (e.g. meeting the
patient’s in-the-moment needs when offering live music) rather
than offering a limited selection of pre-recorded music, which may
not be suitable for all patients. Participants in a cross-over trial
who experienced both music therapy and music medicine inter-
ventions overwhelmingly preferred the music therapy sessions be-
cause of the personal attention and care, the creativity of the inter-
active music making, and the opportunity for emotional expres-
sion through singing and playing instruments.
In general, the trials that used listening to pre-recorded music
provided little information about the music selections used, except
for mentioning general music styles (e.g. new age, classical music,
easy listening, etc). Music within each of these styles can vary
widely, and more detailed information would help clinicians make
well-informed decisions regarding music selections.
The frequency and duration of the interventions varied widely
across the trials. Twelve trials offered a single music session. We
would like to suggest that offering multiple music listening ses-
sions allows for the patient to give feedback about the music, select
different music if needed, and become more skilled in using music
for relaxation purposes. In the case of music therapy interventions,
multiple sessions allow for the development of a therapeutic re-
lationship and deepening of the therapeutic process through the
music. This may lead to greater health benefits. At this time, how-
ever, the relationship between the frequency and duration of treat-
ment and treatment effect remains unclear. Further investigation
into the optimal frequency and duration of music interventions
for specific outcomes in people with cancer is needed.
Presently, we cannot provide data regarding cost or cost-effective-
ness of music therapy or music medicine applications in the care
of cancer patients, as the reviewed trials did not provide these data.
Quality of the evidence
Because of the large number of trials at high risk of bias, readers
should interpret the findings of this review with caution. Often
blinding of participants is not possible in music medicine or mu-
sic therapy studies unless a comparative design is used (e.g. Bradt
2015). Many of the trials in this review included subjective out-
comes, such as anxiety, pain, mood and quality of life. When par-
ticipants cannot be blinded to the intervention, there is definitely
an opportunity for bias when they are asked to report on these
subjective outcomes.
For many trials, the principal investigators needed to be contacted
to provide additional methodological and statistical information,
which improved the quality of evidence in the review.
For anxiety and pain, there were moderate to large effects across
studies. For anxiety, the trials did not agree on the size of effect,
with some reporting much larger beneficial effects than others,
resulting in a large confidence interval. In summary, the quality
of evidence was low for the outcomes (i.e. anxiety, mood, pain,
fatigue and quality of life) and very low for depression (Summary
of findings for the main comparison).
Potential biases in the review process
The strength of our review is that we searched all available
databases and a large number of music therapy journals (English,
German, and French language), checked reference lists of all rele-
vant trials, contacted relevant experts for identification of unpub-
lished trials, and included publications without restricting lan-
guage. We requested additional data where necessary for all trials
we considered for inclusion. This allowed us to get accurate infor-
mation on the trial quality and data for most trials and helped us
make well-informed trial selection decisions.
Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that we
missed some published and unpublished trials, we are confident
that our detailed search strategy combined with extensive hand-
searching identified all relevant trials. It is possible that we did
not identify some grey literature; however, it is doubtful that this
would have had a significant impact on our results. Grey literature
tends to include trials with relatively small numbers of participants
and inconclusive results (McAuley 2000).
One of the included trials (Bradt 2015) was conducted by the lead
author of this review. As for all new studies included in this update,
the risk of bias was assessed by CD and LM. Data extraction was
completed independently by AT.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The findings of this review are consistent with the results of a
review (32 RCTs and controlled clinical trials) assessing the ef-
fect of music interventions on psychological and physical out-
comes in cancer patients (Zhang 2012). Zhang and colleagues re-
portedameandifference of −12.3foranxiety(STAI-S, score range
20 to 80), −6.23 for depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale,
score range 20 to 80), −0.52 for pain (0 to 10 numeric rating
scale) and 13.32 for quality of life (Quality of Life - Cancer, score
range 0-100). The authors also reported that the effects of music
on vital signs, especially blood pressure, were small. In contrast,
Nightingale 2013 (a review of four RCT studies) evaluated the
28

 effects of music on anxiety in adult cancer patients, reporting no
evidence of an effect for music on anxiety. This was likely due to
the small number of studies included in this review. In addition,
reviewers included Kwekkeboom 2003 in the meta-analysis, which
was a quite problematic trial in terms of the implementation of the
music listening interventions, as discussed in the Results section
of our review. Study participants reported that the use of head-
phones while undergoing painful medical procedures was anxiety-
provoking because it prevented them from hearing the surgeon.
In addition, Nightingale 2013 included Hanser 2006 in the meta-
analysis, whereas we included this study in the narrative only. Our
decision was based on a very high attrition rate (40%) and the
inability to implement the music therapy intervention within the
a priori set timeframe, thereby highly diluting the intervention, as
reported by the authors.

Implications for practice
Thissystematicreviewindicatesthatmusicinterventionsmayhave
beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue and QoL in people with
cancer. Furthermore, the results suggest that music may reduce
heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure, though this reduc-
tion is rather small and therefore may not be clinically significant.
Results from single trials suggest that music listening in cancer
patients undergoing surgery may reduce anesthetic and analgesic
consumption and reduce the length of hospital stay, but more re-
search is needed before drawing solid conclusions. Results from a
single study furthermore suggest that post-surgery recovery time
may be shortened when a music therapist offers live, individu-
alized music before and during surgery. Overall, evidence of the
trials included in this review suggest that music interventions may
be offered as a complementary treatment to people with cancer.
No evidence of effect was found for distress, mood, physical func-
tioning, spiritual well-being or oxygen saturation. However, only
a small number of trials investigated the effects of music on these
outcomes. More research is needed. We cannot draw any conclu-
sions at this time regarding the effects of music interventions on
coping, resilience, mean arterial pressure, immunologic function-
ing or communication behaviours because the results of the stud-
ies that included these outcomes could not be pooled or because
we could only identify one trial.
Implications for research
This systematic review provides evidence that music interventions
may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue, QoL, heart
rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure in patients with cancer.
Comparative analyses between music therapy and music medicine
interventions indicate that music therapy is more effective in im-
proving QoL than music medicine interventions. At this time,
more RCTs are needed to determine the effectiveness of music
medicine versus music therapy for outcomes other than quality of
life. This can be achieved by including more music medicine as
well as music therapy RCTs in future reviews, when these become
available or, alternatively, future trials could directly compare the
effects of these two types of interventions. It is important to note
that Bradt 2015 undertook such a comparative study based on
the recommendation of the original systematic review, concluding
that both music therapy and music medicine interventions were
similarly effective for symptom management. However, the results
of their mixed methods research study clearly indicated that even
listening to pre-recorded music can evoke strong emotions and
existential issues in people with cancer and that the participants
in this study were grateful for the presence of a music therapist
to process these emotions and fears. Participants furthermore em-
phasized the importance of interactive music making, as it allowed
them to access their creativity; this is considered an important
resource for the facilitation of resilience in the face of life’s chal-
lenges.
Future research should explore patient characteristics as moder-
ators of treatment benefits of music therapy interventions versus
listening to pre-recorded music. For example, Bradt 2015 sug-
gested that listening to music may cause distress in patients who
have a negative outlook on life. It is possible that these patients
are at greater risk for music’s powerful capacity to access sad and
traumatic memories, and such patients may be better served by lis-
tening to music in the presence of a music therapist who can help
them process their emotions. On the other hand, Bradt and col-
leagues emphasize that some patients have a great need for stability
and emotional security during this challenging time in their life
and may therefore prefer the familiarity of their own music. Self
selected music presents predictable musical and emotional content
and may therefore provide a much needed holding environment
for the patient.
We recommend that future research efforts aim to enhance under-
standing of how each of music therapy and music medicine inter-
ventions can be optimized for symptom management, how music
interventions can best serve patients along the cancer treatment
trajectory, and what unique aspects of music therapy and music
medicine interventions contribute to the care of patients (Bradt
2015).
As stated in other reviews, it is important that investigators con-
sider qualitative and mixed methods research, as these enhance un-
derstanding of the qualitative aspects of a patient’s experience and
identify factors that may contribute to or limit the effectiveness
of music therapy or music medicine interventions (Bradt 2013a;
Bradt 2010; Bradt 2014).

 Future trials that use listening to pre-recorded music should report
more details related to the music selections made available to par-
ticipants and exercise greater care in selecting music that reflects
the patient’s true preference (rather than just giving the patient the
option to select from four or five general genres). In addition, re-
searchers need to carefully consider the potential negative impact
of the use of headphones during procedures because of hampered
communication between the patient and medical personnel.
More research is needed that examines the relationship between
frequency and duration of music interventions and treatment ef-
fects.
Many trials used small sample sizes and did not indicate the use
of power calculations. Future trials need to include power calcu-
lations in order to use adequate sample sizes.
More studies are needed on the use of music interventions in
pediatric patients with cancer. Of the 52 trials in this review, only
four studies focused on outcomes in children and adolescents.
Many studies examined the effects of music interventions on anx-
iety, but more studies are needed for all other outcomes included
in this review.
Formal cost-benefit evaluations of music medicine and music ther-
apy are needed.

Unclear risk
Personnel were blinded. Quote: “the iPOD was
placed in a carrying case which concealed the func-

We decided to assign ’unclear risk’ because it is un-
likely that the participants’ knowledge of group allo-
cation influenced their physiological responses (ob-
jective outcome measures). However, this knowl-
edge may have influenced their reporting on sub-
jective outcomes

Notes
The 3 music sessions were spread over 15 weeks. Music therapy treatment is usually
offered on a weekly or biweekly basis with this population. The author reported that it
was not feasible to have patients come to the clinic each week and that because of this
spread, the intervention was highly diluted. Therefore, the data of this study are not
included in the meta-analysis of this review

Country: Taiwan
Interventions
3 study groups:
1. Music group: the music intervention followed a 3-step guided imagery process
(GIM) (McKinney 2002): a preparation period (10 min), deep relaxation period (12
min) and music listening period (38 min) provided by a trained practitioner
2. Verbal relaxation group (not used in this review)
3. Control group: standard care
Music selections provided: during the preparation period, participants listened to Songs of
the Pacific (’Ambient Moods-Whale Song’) including the sound of sea waves, seabirds and
whales. During the deep relaxation period, a meditation-relaxation with taped recorded
verbal instructions guides the patient. In the deep relaxation period, light music,Forest
Piano with sounds of nature, such as wind, birds and piano were played. In the music
listening period, Violin Rain and Aroma Lavender were played.
Number of sessions: 1
Length of sessions: 60 min
Categorized as music medicine. Although the authors write that the intervention used
GIM, a music therapy intervention, the explanations provided indicate that participants
listened through a pre-recorded tape with verbal instructions rather than the intervention
being implemented by a trained music therapist

3 study groups:
1. Music therapy group: participants met with music therapist to select music from a
researcher-provided database and music therapist created 2 CDs. The first CD was
designed to transition the patient from an anxious/tense state to a relaxed state and the
second was designed to transition the patient from a sad/depressed state to an energized
state. Participants reviewed and edited CDs with the music therapist and in the final
session listened to 1 of the 2 CDs.
2. Unstructured music group: patients met with a mental health therapist and
created 2 CDs with music selected from 15 music tracks from the same database as the
MT group that made them feel relaxed. In session 2, patients selected music that made
them feel energized. The tracks were organized into two 30 min CDs (1 including
relaxing songs and the second including energising songs) based on personal preference
with little input from the therapist.
3. Control condition: standard care

Unacceptable methodological quality: there were important pain-related differences between the 2 groups at
pre-test. For example, there was unequal distribution of different procedures with the music group, which had
significantly more biopsy procedures than the control group. Because biopsy procedures are more painful than
other procedures included in the study, the author flagged this as a serious confounding variable. In addition,
the amount of time that the patient listened to music was not controlled. The author stated that some patients
only listened for 30 seconds prior to procedure

Description
29 April 2016
New search has been performed
In the previous version of this review, we searched the
databases until September 2010 (Bradt 2011). In this up-
dated version we reran the searches until January 2016. We
also extended our handsearching to include two additional
journals, namely Music Medicine and Approaches. In this up-
dated review we have revised the ’Risk of bias’ tables for all
studies according to the new Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool
29 April 2016
New citation required and conclusions have changed
This review is an update of the previous Cochrane review
that included 30 studies (Bradt 2011). This updated review
includes 22 new trials.
One of the previous authors, Dr Denise Grocke, decided
not to participate in the update of this review, and we added
a new co-author, Aaron Teague
Our conclusions about the impact of music interventions on
state anxiety in people with cancer remain similar to those in
Bradt 2011. Although the pooled effect of the studies that
used the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was
slightly lower than in the previous review, the addition of
trials examining this outcome resulted in a more precise es-
timate. The pooled effect of studies that used measurement
tools other than the STAI was higher than in the previous
review
The conclusions for the effect of music interventions on de-
pression changed. Whereas the previous review did not find
support for an effect, this review update found a moder-
ate effect for depression. We also found a similar effect size
(moderate) as the previous review for mood, but the pooled
effect was no longer statistically significant in this update
The conclusionsforthe effectof musicinterventionsonpain
changed. Whereas the previous review reported a moderate
effect, this review update found a large effect for pain
The conclusions for the effect of music interventions on
fatigue also changed. Whereas the previous review did not
find evidence of an effect, this review update found a small
to moderate effect for music interventions on fatigue. The
conclusions for physical functioning remained the same
The conclusionforthe effectof musicinterventionson qual-
ity of life remained similar, that is, there was a large pooled
effect size that was not statistically significant. However, a
subgroup analysis revealed that music therapy interventions
resulted in a moderate and statistically significant effect that
was consistent across trials, whereas music medicine studies
resulted in a large but heterogeneous effect size that was not
statistically significant

 (Continued)
The conclusions for the effects of music interventions on
vital signs remained similar to those of the previous review
This review update included additional outcomes such as
resilience, coping, and anesthetic and analgesic intake, but
no meta-analysis was possible because we only identified one
study per outcome
Because of the additionof manytrialsinthisupdate, we were
able to conduct a priori determined sub-analyses comparing
music therapy with music medicine studies and comparing
patient-preferred music with researcher-selected music for
several of the outcomes

Disease free survival was listed in the protocol as a secondary outcome but was excluded in the review as per recommendation of the
peer review.
We slightly altered the MEDLINE search strategy, removing the words ’compose’ and ’composing’ as text words because they resulted
in hundreds of irrelevant returns.
We added the RILM Abstracts of Music Literature database to the search strategy as per recommendation of the peer review.
