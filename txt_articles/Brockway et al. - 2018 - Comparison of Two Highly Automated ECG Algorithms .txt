 Comparison of Two Highly Automated ECG
Algorithms for Detection of Drug-Induced
Cardiac Ion Channel Block

US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigators recently demonstrated in a crossover study that early (J-Tpeakc) and
late (Tpeak–Tend) repolarization duration can differentiate selective potassium block with a high arrhythmia risk from
multichannel block with lower risk in subjects receiving dofetilide, verapamil, quinidine, or ranolazine. The purpose of this
study was to determine if the findings by the FDA using their published software algorithm could be corroborated using an
alternative software algorithm for the same metrics and to determine if methodological differences resulted in clinically
meaningful differences in interpretation. Exposure–response relationships computed with linear mixed effects models and
mean maximal effects on ECG intervals measured by the two algorithms were similar, corroborating the FDA findings, but
with some differences in the modeled slopes and magnitude of changes. The alternative software resulted in an average
25% reduction in the 95% confidence intervals of the mixed effects models with generally lower Akaike Information
Criterion values.
Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE
TOPIC?
� Evaluation of T-wave morphology measures (J-Tpeak and
Tpeak-Tend) are under regulatory consideration for ECG studies
and may impact cardiac safety assessment of future medications
beyond QTc interval.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
� To date, no data exist on the reproducibility of these meas-
urements using alternative software or methodology.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE
� This study corroborates findings reported by the FDA using
a fully-automated ECG analysis algorithm. It also highlights
potential differences in interpretation, while providing more
consistency in measuring drug effects with 25% reduction in
confidence intervals.
HOW THIS MIGHT CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMA-
COLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
� Changes in the technical approach used to measure repolari-
zation features have the potential to improve sensitivity of J-Tp
biomarker and reduce variability.
In 2005, the International Committee for Harmonization issued
the E14 guidance requiring a thorough QT/QTc interval evalua-
tion (TQT) for all drugs, with some exceptions, prior to regula-
tory approval (ICH E14).1 Over the last 12 years, this guidance
has prevented drugs that increase the risk of fatal arrhythmia,
torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia, from reaching the
marketplace. However, it is now recognized that potential
false-positive QTc findings associated with this regulatory end-
point may discourage development of other beneficial and safe
medications.2 Therefore, new endpoints are being examined for
regulatory consideration.
Recently the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Crit-
ical Path Initiative funded their own investigation of alternative
ECG biomarkers for detecting cardiac ion channel block using
drugs known to cause QT prolongation and associated with vary-
ing incidences of torsade risk.3 The four drugs prospectively
studied in a randomized, crossover design inhibit the human
ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel, IKr,
either alone or in combination with varying degrees of inhibi-
tion on the L-type calcium, and early and late sodium inward
currents. Dofetilide was chosen as a specific hERG blocker with
a high incidence of torsade.4,5 Quinidine was also chosen as a
strong hERG blocker at low concentrations but with calcium
and sodium current inhibition at higher plasma concentra-
tions.4 The last two drugs, ranolazine and verapamil, are associ-
ated with a low risk of torsade.6,7 Although both are potent
hERG blockers, ranolazine additionally inhibits the late sodium
current, while verapamil inhibits the L-type calcium current.4
Using only supine resting ECGs, it was shown that, unlike
QTc, early and late measures of repolarization (heart rate-
corrected global J-Tpeak (c) and global Tpeak–Tend, respectively)
could differentiate pure hERG block associated with a high

 incidence of torsade risk, from multichannel block of hERG
and either calcium or late sodium currents, which is associated
with lower risk.3
To further advance the initiative to find improved ECG bio-
markers, the 10-sec ECGs extracted prespecified timepoints and
the 24-h continuously collected digital ECG data from the FDA
study were archived at the University of Rochester Medical Cen-
ter Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse (THEW) and made
available for analyses by other investigators. Our objective was to
remeasure the FDA QTcF and T-wave morphology biomarker
findings (J-Tpeakc and Tpeak–Tend), recorded during supine rest at
multiple prespecified timepoints using an alternative automated
software (Rhythm Express, VivaQuant, St. Paul, MN), and to
examine differences in results between the FDA and the alterna-
tive software.
RESULTS
Baseline values
Baseline demographics and vital signs of the subjects of this study
were previously reported.3 The baseline ECG values determined
in this study by the FDA and alternative software algorithms
were, respectively: heart rate 56.0 6 6.7 vs. 56.0 6 6.6 bpm;
QTcF 395.6 6 17 vs. 394.1 6 16.4 ms; J-Tpeakc 224.1 6 19.8
vs. 227.6 6 21.2 ms; Tpeak–Tend 74.3 6 6.9 vs. 77.6 6 5.8 ms.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Figure 1 shows the results of pharmacokinetic analysis for each
drug: dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and verapamil. The pharma-
cokinetic characteristics were previously reported.3 Dofetilide and
quinidine had maximum concentrations occurring at 2.5 h and 2.0
h with mean half-lives of 7.2 6 1.1 (6SD) and 7.8 6 1.5 h,
respectively. Mean peak ranolazine concentrations occurred at 4.0
h with a half-life of 7.5 6 2.3 h and verapamil peak concentrations
occurred at 1.0 h with a mean half-life of 10.4 6 3.2 h.
QTcF, J-Tpeakc, and Tpeak–Tend interval analyses
The differences between mean maximum (695% confidence
interval (CI)) effects of each drug on J-Tpeakc were not statisti-
cally significant between the FDA and alternative software results
(Figure 2). However, differences between the mean maximum
(695% CI) effects of dofetilide and quinidine on QTcF and
Tpeak–Tend were statistically significant between the methods.
The differences can be explained by 1) different approaches to
detecting the peak of notched T-waves and 2) the influence of
U-waves on T offset (end of T-wave) detection. The FDA soft-
ware consistently used the first peak of the notched T-wave for
the Tpeak annotation,8 while the alternative software was
designed to use the last significant peak prior to downslope of the
T-wave. This resulted in shorter J-Tpeakc and longer Tpeak–Tend
durations (Figure 3a) for the FDA measurements.
When a U-wave was present, it appears that in some cases the
FDA software included at least a portion of the U-wave in the T-
offset, while the alternative software excluded the U-wave entirely
(Figure 3b). The influence of these methodological differences is
particularly evident in the case of dofetilide, for which the mean
maximal change in QTcF was measured shorter by 15 ms by
the alternative algorithm, mainly due to the shortening of the
Tpeak–Tend interval (DDTpeak–Tend 5 39.72 ms for FDA and

 20.33 ms for the alternative). The differences in software were
also present for quinidine (e.g., DDTpeak–Tend 5 50.27 ms for
the FDA measure vs. 26.12 ms for the alternative).
The consistency of measurements was evaluated per the
ASTM standard.17 The triplicate measurements during a time-
point were treated as repeated measurements over a short period
of time. The results are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
The average reduction in repeatability standard deviation between
the FDA and Rhythm Express (RE) measurements is 16%. The
highest improvement was achieved in measurements obtained on
dofetilide and quinidine treatment for all metrics, but especially
Tpeak–Tend. The alternative software was more consistent in
determining placebo-corrected changes from baseline, resulting in
an average reduction in the CI of 25% across all models.
Exposure–response analysis
The comparison of the FDA and the alternative measures in the
same exposure–response model for each drug is shown in Figure 4,
with statistics presented in Table 1. As noted above, QT intervals
tend to be shorter when measured by the alternative software,
resulting in exposure–response slopes that are slightly smaller. CIs
between the methods generally overlap. The differences between
the slopes were tested with a two-sample t-test and were found not
to be statistically significant, with the exception of QTcF for dofeti-
lide (FDA slope 5 28.64 vs. alternative slope 5 23.74, P 5 0.007),
and quinidine (FDA slope 5 42.36 vs. alternative slope 5 33.19,
P 5 0.01), and Tpeak–Tend for dofetilide (FDA slope 5 14.45 vs.
alternative slope 5 8.04, P 5 0.001), and quinidine (FDA slope 5
29.75 vs. alternative slope 5 14.74, P 5 0.005).
Since it appears that a few subjects with complex T-waves
(either notched T and/or the presence of U-waves) can create
differences in the results and potentially change the interpreta-
tion of the data, we further examined scatterplots of all points for
both the FDA and the alternative methods. Figures 5 and 6

 show exposure–response scatterplots for DDQTcF, J-Tpeakc, and
Tpeak–Tend values from both systems for dofetilide and quinidine
treatments. The alternative software was more consistent in
determining the fiducial endpoints, resulting in 11–30% smaller
CIs for these two drugs in all metrics and a 39% reduction in CIs
for QTcF for ranolazine. An overall 7% better goodness of fit
(smaller Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)) was observed for
the alternative software compared to the FDA algorithm for
quinidine, dofetilide, and ranolazine. The effect of verapamil was
insignificant, resulting in little difference in statistics of model fit
between the two algorithms.
DISCUSSION
In this study we retrospectively examined data from a random-
ized controlled clinical trial conducted by the FDA3 for potential
new biomarkers that can differentiate multichannel block and
improve assessment of arrhythmia risk compared to QTc alone.
Our study objectives were to determine if the use of an

 alternative software algorithm could corroborate the FDA analy-
sis and to examine the nature of differences in the results of the
two algorithms.
The main finding in this study was corroboration of the
FDA’s observations3 on the ability of ECG biomarkers to iden-
tify single and multichannel block by drugs. However, the two
methods did differ occasionally in how fiducial endpoints were
determined in individual cases and, in some cases, the group
means were affected modestly. This observation brings emphasis
to the need to carefully evaluate the influence of algorithm meth-
odological differences on results of ECG biomarkers. The alterna-
tive software algorithm consistently selected the last significant
peak of the T-wave prior to its downslope for the T-peak annota-
tion, while the FDA algorithm consistently selected the first
peak.8 This resulted in longer J-Tpeakc values assessed by the alter-
native algorithm (Table 1, Figure 2). Examination of the results
for J-Tpeakc across all drugs showed that there were no statistically
significant differences in mean maximal values or slope of the
exposure–response relationship. However, trends were apparent:
the alternative software produced a steeper slope for J-Tpeakc for
quinidine (11.57 (FDA) vs. 16.40 (alternative)) and ranolazine
(–0.66 (FDA) vs. 0.6 (alternative)).
In a subsequent study from the same group,9 J-Tpeakc was
shown to be a stronger predictor of risk than Tpeak–Tend. How-
ever, the consistency of J-Tpeakc measurement can be undermined
in the presence of notched T-wave. It is therefore beneficial to
measure J-Tpeakc in a manner that maximizes its sensitivity and
improves consistency. The comparison of exposure–response
analysis results demonstrated that selecting the last significant
peak of the T-wave prior to its downslope results in a higher con-
centration slope, which increased sensitivity. This effect is also
complemented with reduction of CI, which should theoretically
increase specificity of the biomarker. We hypothesize that using
the first peak to measure J-Tpeakc, as was done by the FDA algo-
rithm,8 has the potential to bias a drug toward being more safe
(false negative), given the hypothesis that a shorter J-Tpeakc inter-
val may offset the risk associated with QT prolongation.3 In the
absence of a gold standard, however, it is not possible to know
which result is more correct without long-term follow-up in a
large cohort of patients.

 Contrary to the J-Tpeakc results, the presence of outliers
among the FDA-measured Tpeak–Tend values resulted in a longer
average. Analysis of waveforms and annotations in outlier cases
(Figure 3) indicated that the FDA algorithm may estimate a
longer Tpeak–Tend for two reasons. First, selecting the first peak
on a notched T-wave as the T-peak results in longer Tpeak–Tend.
Second, T-offset detection by the FDA algorithm seemed to be
biased by the presence of U-waves, especially when the T-wave
was flat (Figure 3b). The same bias also resulted in longer QTcF
values. The alternative software consistently excluded the U-wave
from offset of the T-wave.
While this study corroborates the FDA methods and findings,
the observation of differences between the two methods is also
helpful. Although there is no gold standard by which the correct-
ness of findings by one or the other algorithm can be judged, the
consistency of the interval readings is important. Reductions in
variability can improve confidence in study interpretation,
increase specificity (i.e., reduce false positives), reduce the sample
study size required for endpoint determination, and potentially
reduce cost. While it is possible that the smaller variance in
intervals measured with the alternative technique might have
been due to measurement error, the analysis of the repeatability
standard deviation within the 5-min timepoints suggests that
improved consistency of measurements contributed to the reduc-
tion in CI. ECGs recorded in individual resting subjects during a
5-min interval would be expected to be nearly identical. Thus,
variation of those values is a more precise test of measurement
repeatability than the assessments done on the whole population
over all timepoints, because those assessments include intersubject
variability and drug- and circadian-related intertimepoint vari-
ability, in addition to measurement variability.
It is noteworthy that the alternative software provided fully
automated continuous beat-to-beat interval measurements for all
timepoints. No editing was performed on the results provided by
the alternative software. The analysis in this report was based on
10-sec ECG data extracted at prespecified timepoints from the
continuous data stream. Analysis of the continuous data would
allow for capture of varying autonomic states such as eating,
sleep, and ambulation. This capability could be used to investi-
gate the utility of temporally dynamic parameters such as QT

 beat-to-beat10 and ECG restitution11 and to compare them
against the FDA T-wave morphology parameters. This could
optimize the utility of potential biomarkers of arrhythmia risk.
In summary, we have corroborated the FDA’s discovery that
simple ECG biomarkers can be used to differentiate ion channel
block by a drug, even when multiple channels are blocked. In
addition, we have shown that technical differences in the mea-
surement methodologies can result in clinically meaningful differ-
ences in the results, both at the level of drug assessment and of
individual patient/subject assessment. Careful attention to the
influence of algorithm variations is warranted. Without a gold
standard for guidance, it would be reasonable to seek algorithms
that limit the presence of outliers and the resultant variability.
METHODS
All ECGs were obtained from the E-OTH-12-5232-020 (FDA-1) data-
base archived in the Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse at the Uni-
versity of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY. The downloaded
5,232 10-sec ECG segments were processed by Rhythm Express software
to generate the vector magnitude ECG of the vectorcardiogram12 and
automatically measure cardiac intervals. The intervals were averaged for
each 10-sec segment. J-Tpeak and QT were corrected for heart rate.3 The
FDA annotations for each 10-sec measurement were downloaded from
Physionet13 and were used to confirm the statistical models and compute
additional exposure–response parameters. Averaged interval results and
summary statistics were reviewed and select segments with outlier aver-
ages or large differences from the FDA results were reviewed for accuracy
without making any changes to the automated interval measurements.
Study design
The archived ECG data were from a randomized controlled five-way
single-dose crossover clinical trial in 22 healthy volunteers (11 females)
conducted at a phase I clinical research unit (Spaulding Clinical, West
Bend, WI). The study details and inclusion criteria were previously
reported3,8 and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
Research Involving Human Subjects Committee and the local Institu-
tional Review Board. All subjects gave written informed consent.
As per the previous description,3 in the morning of the treatment
period the subjects received one of four drugs or placebo under fasting
conditions. There was a 7-day washout period between each 24-h treat-
ment period, so subjects received treatments on days 1, 9, 17, 25, and 33.

 configuration was connected to each subject. The continuous ECG
recordings were made at 500 Hz and with an amplitude resolution of
2.5 lV. From the continuous recording, three replicate 10-sec ECGs
(pre -and postdose) were extracted at 16 predefined timepoints (predose
and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 24 h postdose), during
which the subjects were resting in a supine position for 10 min. After
each ECG extraction timepoint period, a blood sample was drawn for
pharmacokinetic analysis. Plasma drug concentration was determined
using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy
method by Frontage Laboratories (Exton, Philadelphia, PA).
ECG assessment
Rhythm Express software was used to perform automated measurement
of cardiac intervals. The software removes of up to 95% of noise, with-
out distorting ECG morphology, and performs arrhythmia screening
and beat-to-beat cardiac interval measurement using wavelet-based tech-
niques.15,16 Visualization tools facilitate review of the results with syn-
chronized display of ECGs, fiducial point markers, and interval trends,
along with automatically detected interval outliers and abnormal beats.
The wavelet-based emphasis signal and its derivative are used to identify
T-wave morphology and facilitate peak and offset search. In case of a
notched T-wave, T peak is detected as the last significant peak prior to
T-wave downslope. If multiple T-wave peaks are present, the temporal
relationship of peaks with amplitudes greater than three-quarters of the
maximum T-wave amplitude are evaluated in relationship to the peaks
of the emphasis signal to identify the last peak prior to T-wave down-
slope. In case of complex T-wave morphology, the search window for T
peak starts after the point of the maximum change, identified as the first
extremum (maximum or minimum) of the emphasis signal derivative.
Subsequent positive and negative peaks in the emphasis signals are com-
pared to identify T-wave morphology and find the last significant peak.
The wavelet-based emphasis signal enhances the significant peaks and
smoothes out noise-related jitter in ECG interval values. The T-offset
detection algorithm uses a combination of ECG, derivative, and empha-
sis signal threshold methods, depending on the identified T-wave mor-
phology characteristics and measured noise level.
Statistical analysis
The placebo-corrected change from baseline was computed using lme4 and
lsmeans packages in R 3.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria). The change from baseline for each ECG biomarker
(DQTcF, DTpeak–Tend and DJ-Tpeakc) by timepoint was the dependent vari-
able, for which baseline was defined as the average predose value. Period, time,
treatment, and an interaction between treatment and time were included as
fixed effects, and subject was included as a random effect. Exposure–response
analysis was performed with a linear mixed-effects model, fitted using lme4
and lsmeans, with the placebo-corrected change from baseline as dependent
variable and fixed effects on the intercept and corresponding time matched
concentration and a random intercept and slope per subject. The FDA anno-
tations were fitted in the same statistical models and the resulting values were
compared to partial published results to confirm the models.
Differences between mean maximum drug effects and slopes for each
method were compared using a two-sample t-test. P < 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
