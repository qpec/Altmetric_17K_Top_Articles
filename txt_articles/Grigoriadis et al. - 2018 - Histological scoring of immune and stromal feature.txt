Abstract
The prognostic importance of lymph node (LN) status and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), is well
established, particularly TILs in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). So far, few studies have interrogated
changes in involved and uninvolved LNs and evaluated if their morphological patterns add valuable informa-
tion for the prediction of disease progression in breast cancer. In a cohort of 309 patients enriched for
TNBCs (170/309), we histologically characterised immune and stromal features in primary tumours and
associated involved and uninvolved axillary LNs on routine haematoxylin and eosin stained sections. Of the
309 patients, 143 had LN-positive disease. Twenty-five histopathological features were assessed, including
the degree of TIL presence, quantitative and qualitative assessment of germinal centres (GCs) and sinus his-
tiocytosis. Multivariate and cross-validated proportional hazard regression analyses were used to identify
optimal covariate sets for prediction of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). The degree of intratumoural
and peritumoural immune infiltrate was associated with architectural changes in both uninvolved and
involved LNs. By including clinicopathological characteristics as well as tumour and LN histopathological
features in L2-regularised proportional hazard models, the prediction of 5-year DMFS was improved by
3–15% over the baseline in all cancers and in TNBCs. In LN-positive cancers, the combination of Salgado’s
classification, lymphocytic lobulitis, size and number of GCs in the uninvolved LNs and location of GCs in
the involved LNs carried significant prognostic information. From these features, a multivariate cross-
validation-stable risk signature was constructed, which identified low-risk groups within both LN-positive
breast cancers and the LN-positive TNBCs group with a 10-year DMFS probability of 78 and 87%, respec-
tively. This study illustrates that, by incorporating histopathological patterns of involved and uninvolved
LNs combined with primary tumour immune and stromal features, the prediction of developing distant
metastasis in LN-positive breast cancers can be estimated more accurately.

 Introduction
In invasive breast cancer, tumour size and the number
of involved lymph nodes (LNs) have an inverse linear
relationship with prognosis [1] and guide clinical deci-
sions. Historical 10-year survival after local therapy
alone (surgery and radiotherapy) in patients with node
negative disease is �85%, whilst for patients with
involved axillary LNs it is 40–50% [2]. Emerging data
have identified patients with a low risk for recurrence
amongst LN-positive breast cancers who may be
spared aggressive treatments. LNs are classified as
involved with metastasis by pathological examination
of conventional haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sec-
tions, depending on the number of tumour cells and
size of the largest malignant deposit [3]. However,
controversy regarding thresholds for these variables in
addition to results from recent clinical trials in which
occult metastasis were retrospectively evaluated [4],
illustrate the uncertainty around the prognostic LN
features for disease recurrence.
Accumulating evidence supports the prognostic
and predictive role of the host immune response in
early stage breast cancers, especially in oestrogen
receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-
negative, and HER2-negative (i.e. triple negative)
breast cancers (TNBCs) [5–7]. Recent studies have
shown that stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs), as opposed to intratumoural TILs, are poten-
tially useful biomarkers in predicting response to
therapy and overall outcome, when assessed via light
microscopy of H&E stained tissue [5,8,9]. Most stud-
ies to date have focused on the assessment of TILs
within the primary tumour whilst largely ignoring
peritumoural and nodal patterns of immune infil-
trates. Clinical relevance of cell type specific altera-
tion in LNs was provided by Kohrt et al, who
demonstrated that the number of CD4 T cells and
CD1a dendritic cells in axillary LNs allowed a more
significant stratification of disease-free survival for
77 breast cancer patients with small- and medium-
sized tumours than all other clinicopathological fea-
tures [10].
The aims of this study were (i) to comprehensively
catalogue the histopathological features of immune
cell and other mesenchymal stromal infiltrates within
tumour tissue, peritumoural tissue, and axillary nodal
tissue and (ii) to determine whether any of these fea-
tures are of prognostic value in breast cancer. Given
the large number of features evaluated in relation to
the small-sized patient cohorts, we implemented an
L2-regularised multivariate Cox proportional hazard
model
with
repeated
cross-validation
to
identify
robust and generalisable putative predictors of devel-
oping distant metastasis.
Materials and methods
Study design and patients
This is a retrospective study of patients with invasive
breast carcinoma treated between 1984 and 2002 at
Guy’s Hospital London, UK. Ethical clearance was
obtained from the local research ethics committee.
H&E
stained
sections
of
formalin-fixed
paraffin
embedded tissue from primary invasive breast carci-
nomas, along with their involved and uninvolved
LNs, were retrieved from the King’s Health Partner’s
Breast Cancer Tissue and Data Bank (London, UK)
from 309 patients. The cohort was enriched for
patients with TNBC (N 5 170, 142 of which were
described previously [11]), whilst 139 patients had
non-TNBC [hormone receptor-positive/HER2-nega-
tive (N 5 62), hormone receptor-negative/HER2-posi-
tive (N 5 59) and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-
positive (N 5 18)]. LN status was available for 276/
309 patients. One hundred and forty-three (52%)
patients were LN-positive whilst 133 (48%) had LN-
negative
disease.
Uninvolved
axillary
LNs
were
available for 134/143 patients with LN-positive dis-
ease. In the remaining nine LN-positive patients, all
harvested nodes were involved. Clinicopathological
data for each patient, including age at diagnosis,
baseline tumour characteristics such as invasive size,
histological grade, histological subtype, ER, PR, and
HER2 status, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for
cytokeratins (CK) 5 and 14 and epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) status, LN involvement, and
distant metastases were recorded (Table 1) and some
have previously been described [11].
Histopathological immune assessment
Classification of immune infiltrates
All routine H&E stained sections of primary breast
tumours and uninvolved and involved LNs were reas-
sessed histopathologically. A minimum of 6 sections
of the primary tumour and 1–12 (mean 5 6) LNs per
case were available for evaluation of immune and
stromal features. All sections were reviewed by a
specialist Consultant Breast Pathologist (SEP) and
Pathology Research Scientist (PG). Analyses of the
tumour microenvironment were performed using con-
ventional microscopy of H&E whole sections. The
NanoZoomer HT Digital Pathology Scanning System
(Hamamatsu, Japan), was used to scan H&E sections

 with a spatial resolution of 0.46 lm/pixel for the
measurement of LN germinal centres (GCs). Accord-
ing to recommendations by the International Tumour
Infiltrating Lymphocytes Working Group [12], mor-
phological features initially assessed as continuous
variables (e.g. stromal TILs) were discretised for sta-
tistical analysis. All features and their associated cat-
egories described below in detail are summarised in
supplementary material, Tables S1A and S1B.
Intratumoural site
Immune infiltrates were assessed semi-quantitatively
across the entire tumour section and then in different
tumour regions. As per Salgado’s criteria, TILs were
classified as ‘stromal TILs’ (Figure 1A–C) or ‘intra-
tumoural TILs’ (Figure 1D). Stromal TILs were fur-
ther
sub-classified
as
TILs
scattered
within
the
tumour stroma (Figure 1A); TILs around tumour cell
nests (Figure 1B) and TILs seen at the invasive mar-
gin (Figure 1C). The degree of TILs present was fur-
ther graded semi-quantitatively as: 0 5 absence of
lymphocytes, 1 5 minimal (1–10% of surface area in
a given location); 2 5 mild (10–20%); 3 5 moderate
(>20–50%); and 4 5 strong (�50%).
Peritumoural site (including premalignant and
non-tumorous components)
Immune infiltrates associated with in situ and normal
tissue adjacent to invasive tumours were assessed
when seen (i) next to DCIS (Figure 1E), (ii) in nor-
mal breast lobules (Figure 1F), and (iii) in perivascu-
lar areas (Figure 1G). Lymphocytic lobulitis [13]
(Figure 1H) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS)
were graded as present or absent (Figure 1I).
Stromal features
Assessment of stromal features in the invasive
tumours was based on their overall appearances and
recorded as oedematous/myxoid (Figure 1J), hyali-
nised (Figure 1K) and/or fibroblastic (Figure 1L);
when a mixed pattern was present, the predominant
feature was recorded. Smooth muscle actin and
alcian blue staining of selected cases supported the
H&E stromal classification (supplementary material,
Figure S1).

 Involved and uninvolved axillary LNs
Three main morphological immune features were
assessed in axillary involved LNs: (A) GC features,
(B) degree of sinus histiocytosis, and (C) pattern of
metastatic tumour involvement (supplementary mate-
rial, Table S1B). In uninvolved LN, only (A) and (B)
were assessed.
(i) The number of GCs was categorised as grade 0
(absent), 1 (few), 2 (moderate), or 3 (numerous, fre-
quently distributed throughout the LN) (Figure 2A).
(ii) The distribution of GCs was classified as pre-
dominantly peripheral (majority close to the capsule),
predominantly central (most GCs in the centre of the
LN) (Figure 2A) or mixed architecture (GCs were

 located across the whole LN). (iii) Average size of
GCs was classified as either small (<200 mm in
diameter), moderate (200–400 mm), large (>400 mm),
or mixed (if more than one size) (Figure 2B). In
those with mixed sizes of GCs, cases with a predomi-
nant pattern of large GCs were further classified as
‘GC hyperplasia’. Supplementary material, Figure S2
shows staining with CD20 (B cell marker) and
CD11c (dendritic cell marker) on selected cases,
which corroborated the classification of morphologi-
cal changes in the GCs of the LNs.
Sinus histiocytosis was assessed using a modifi-
cation of the method previously described by Culter
et al, [14]. The number of histiocytes across the
sinuses was classified as: grade 0 (absent), grade 1
(<2 cells), grade 2 (2–4 cells), grade 3 (>4 to <8
cells), or grade 4 (�8 cells across the sinus) (Figure
2C). The dilatation of sinuses by cells other than
histiocytes, for example, by metastatic tumour cells,
or other inflammatory cells or oedema fluid, was
ignored.
Metastatic tumour spread within the LN was classi-
fied into six patterns: (i) sub-capsular (within the
sinus immediately under the LN capsule) (Figure
2D), (ii) intra-sinusoidal [within sinuses in the body
of the LN (Figure 2E)], (iii) diffuse (Figure 2F), (iv)
Figure 2. Histomorphological features of uninvolved and involved LNs (H&E stain). In the uninvolved LNs: (A) numerous GCs (grade 3)
GC located throughout the LN (white arrows); (B) large GC (white arrow) with an adjacent small GC (black arrow); (C) sinus histiocy-
tosis grade 4 (inset showing a higher power view). In the involved LNs: (D) sub-capsular metastasis; (E) sinusoidal pattern (black
arrows); (F) diffuse pattern (black arrows); (G) nodular pattern with near total replacement of the nodal tissue with metastatic
deposits.

Data analysis and interpretation
The end point of the study was distant metastasis-
free survival (DMFS), which was calculated from
the date of diagnosis of the primary tumour to the
first
event
of
any
distant
metastases.
An
L2-
regularised multivariate proportional hazard model,
based on iterative determination of optimal covari-
ates
to
prevent
overfitting
via
repeated
cross-
validation,
was
applied
to
all
breast
cancers
(N 5 309), TNBC (N 5 170) patients, and their LN
status dichotomised subgroups [15–18]. Three sets
of covariates were used in the analytical models:
group A included eight clinicopathological features,
group
B
encompassed
histologically
assessed
immune and stromal features and group C was a
combination of A and B. Figure 3 provides a CON-
SORT diagram explaining cohorts used for statisti-
cal analyses. A detailed description of the statistical
analysis is provided in supplementary material, Sup-
plementary materials and methods and Figure S3. In
brief, each analysis was performed with 100 iterations
and their results were averaged. The fraction of cor-
rectly predicted patients was recorded after 1 year,
and every year up to 10 years of DMFS. At each time
point, an optimal set of covariates with the highest
prediction accuracy was determined by ranking the
covariates
according
to
their
relevance
in
the
cross-validated Cox regression analysis. Regression
parameters for each covariate were reported as hazard
ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) [19].
For LN-positive cohorts, an optimal covariate-set
to predict 5-year DMFS was established to construct
a single-patient immune and stromal histopathologi-
cal (ISH) risk score, by summing the standardised
covariates
weighted
by
their
coefficients.
LN-
positive patients were grouped into those with low
and upper quartile, and mean risk signature scores.
Kaplan-Meier estimators were used, and the log-
rank test was performed to test differences among
groups.
Results
Clinicopathological characteristics of the patients
The clinicopathological features of the 309 evaluated
patients are presented in Table 1. First analysis was
restricted to TNBC patients (N 5 170; 81 with LN-
negative and 64 with LN-positive disease and 25
patients within unknown LN status), followed by ran-
domly selected non-TNBC patients (N 5 139; 52 with
LN-negative, 79 LN-positive, and 8 with unknown
LN status). All patients were female with a median
age of 55 years (range 5 24–89) at diagnosis. Most
(N 5 183; 59%) patients had T2 tumour size and a
predominant number of cases (N 5 253; 82%) were
histologically grade 3, as might be expected in a
cohort enriched for TNBC and for LN positive cases.
Most cases were invasive breast carcinomas of no
special type (82%). Lymphovascular invasion (LVI)
was seen in 90 (29%) cases. Median follow-up was
7.9 years for the entire cohort (range 5 0.3–25). Dis-
tant metastasis was recorded in 129 (42%) patients,
of whom 70% developed distant metastasis within
the first 2.5 years after diagnosis (range of DMFS
0.3–18 years).
Lymphocytic infiltration at invasive and
peritumoural sites
Intratumoural sites
An absence of lymphocytic infiltration across the
entire tumour was noted in 6 (3.5%) TNBC patients
compared with 18 (12.9%) non-TNBC patients. The
majority of TNBC patients had a moderate (N 5 78,
45.9%) or strong (N 5 23, 13.5%) degree of lympho-
cytic infiltration across the entire tumour. In contrast,
a
majority
of
non-TNBC
patients
had
minimal
(N 5 45, 32.4%) or mild (N 5 36, 25.9%) degree of
infiltration. A strong degree of lymphocytic infiltra-
tion across the entire tumour was seen only in 5
(3.6%) non-TNBC patients. Intra-tumoral TILs were
present in more TNBC patients (N 5 51, 30%) com-
pared with non-TNBC patients (N 5 10, 7.2%). Like-
wise, a strong degree of TILs at the invasive margins
was noted in more TNBC (N 5 22, 12.9%) than non-
TNBC patients (N 5 2, 1.4%) (see Table 2A).
Peritumoural sites
In 130 of the total 309 cases, DCIS was seen in close
proximity to the invasive tumour. In 48/130 (36.9%)
cases, the DCIS was free of lymphoid infiltrate,
whilst the rest had varying degrees of immune infil-
trates. A strong lymphoid infiltrate was found sur-
rounding breast lobules in the TNBC group (N 5 40,
30.5%) compared with the non-TNBC group (N 5 20,
17.5%). Lymphocytic lobulitis and TLS in areas sur-
rounding the invasive tumours were seen more fre-
quently in TNBC cases (16 and 27.6%, respectively)
compared with non-TNBCs (9.6% and 17.3%, respec-
tively) (see Table 2A).

 Tumour stroma
Fibroblastic stroma was the most common intratu-
moural stromal change noted accounting for 87%
cases, followed by hyalinised stroma in 86% cases
and myxoid change was the least common noted in
23% cases. No differences were noted across tumour
subgroups (Table 2B).

 Correlation of histopathological features of
intratumoural, peritumoural, stromal, and nodal sites
We next investigated whether the degree and presence
of these histological features occurred independently.
Using a Pearson’s correlation, there was a concurrent
increase in the degree of lymphocytic infiltrate at the
invasive tumour, around tumour nests, at the periph-
eral tumour edge and within the stroma (supplemen-
tary material, Figure S4). We also noticed that, in all
breast cancers and particularly among TNBCs, the
number and size of the GCs in uninvolved and
involved LNs grew with increasing levels of immune
infiltrates
at
the
primary
tumour
site
(r:
0.46,
p <0.001; supplementary material, Figure S4).
Immune-associated characteristics improve
prognostic accuracy for DMFS
Next, we asked whether these novel histomorphologi-
cal features carry prognostic information for the
development of distant metastases. Given that several
of these immune and stromal cell patterns do not
occur independently (supplementary material, Figure
S4), we used a Bayesian multivariate survival analy-
sis algorithm optimised to undo the possible effects
of overfitting [18]. We analysed three groups of
covariates (A, B, C) first in all breast cancers and
then in the TNBC cohort only. We then evaluated
their performance in correctly predicting the fraction
of patients free of distant metastasis at 5 years after
diagnosis in comparison to the baseline performance
in which no covariates were used and in which the
risk of distant metastasis is derived solely from any
imbalance between cases and controls (Figure 4, ver-
tical grey lines). Covariate-group A included eight
clinicopathological features; ER, PR, and HER2 sta-
tus, histological grade, LN status, tumour size, age at
diagnosis, and the presence or absence of LVI. Group
B encompassed the 25 histologically assessed fea-
tures described above in detail (14 features are from
the
primary
tumour
site
and
11
features
were
obtained from involved and uninvolved LNs, supple-
mentary
material,
Table
S1).
In
group
C,
we
combined groups A and B. In all breast cancers,
covariate-group A correctly predicted 5-year DMFS in
68% of patients (green line, Figure 4A). This was a
modest improvement compared to 62% baseline per-
formance (dotted line, Figure 4A) and the covariate-
group
B
(red
line,
Figure
4A).
The
combined
covariate-group C performed best by correctly predict-
ing 5-year DMFS in 71% of patients (black line, Fig-
ure 4A). In TNBC, the differences in predictive
accuracy between groups A, B, and C were less pro-
nounced. Of note, within the TNBC cohort, covariate-
group B (red line, Figure 4B) was more accurate in
predicting 5-year DMFS (71%) than either group A
(67%, green line, Figure 4B) or the baseline perform-
ance (67%, dotted line, Figure 4B). The optimal cova-
riates among the covariate-group B were selected as
being risk-predictive at 5-year DMFS, namely TILs in
the primary tumour according to Salgado’s criteria
[12], the number and size of GCs in the uninvolved
LN, the location of GCs, and a diffuse metastatic pat-
tern in the involved LN, as well as the presence of
lymphocytic lobulitis in adjacent normal breast tissue
(Table 3). Supplementary material, Table S2A pro-
vides the full list of optimal covariates selected at 5-
year DMFS in both cohorts for each of the three
covariate-groups used in these analyses.
A risk score based on histomorphological features
identifies LN-positive breast cancers patients with
low risk for distant metastasis
As morphological patterns in involved and unin-
volved LNs carried prognostic value, we asked if
these features were predictive for developing distant
metastasis in both LN-positive and LN-negative dis-
ease. All breast cancers and TNBCs group were fur-
ther divided into patients with LN-positive (143 all
cancers and 64 TNBC), and LN-negative disease
(133 all cancers and 81 TNBC). These four sub-
cohorts were then analysed independently with L2-
regularised
proportional
hazards
models
using
covariate-group B. In the LN-positive cohorts, covari-
ates were selected via cross-validation for predicting
Figure 4. Optimised proportional hazards models to identify covariates for the prediction of developing distant metastasis in all inva-
sive breast cancers and TNBC cohorts. Three different initial sets of covariates were used for the prediction analysis, namely 8 stand-
ard features (group A); 25 immune and stroma features (group B); and all available features in (group C). The dotted line in all
graphs indicates the baseline performance without any covariates (i.e. based solely on any imbalance between cases and controls).
The green, red, and black lines show the performance on the validation set including either groups A, B, and C, respectively. LN-
positive patients of all breast cancers (C) and TNBC (D) were analysed with group B covariates. The LN-positive cohorts were further
dichotomised based on the ISH-risk score. Kaplan-Meier curves for all breast cancers (E) and TNBC (F) illustrating the duration of
DMFS according to lower quartile (green line), mean (blue line), and upper quartile (red line) of ISH-risk score grouping. HR and CI
are listed below the graph. The black dotted lines display the survival curves for LN-negative patients of all breast cancers (n 5 133)
and TNBC (n 5 81).

 a 5-year DMFS, including Salgado’s classification,
the presence of lymphocytic lobulitis, the size, and
number of GCs in the uninvolved LN and location of
GCs in the involved LN (Table 3, supplementary
material, Tables S2B and S2C). Incorporating these
five features improved the 5-year DMFS predictive
accuracy from 50% baseline performance (dotted
line, Figure 4C) to 64% in all breast cancers (red
line, Figure 4C) and from 58% baseline performance
(dotted line, Figure 4D) to 74% in TNBC (red line,
Figure 4D). Amongst the two LN-negative cohorts,
covariate-group B failed to improve 5-year DMFS
predictive accuracy (supplementary material, Figure
S5). Due to the smaller datasets in these sub-cohorts,
residual overfitting cannot be excluded.
Lastly, we built an ‘immune-stroma-histological
(ISH)-risk score’ with these five histomorphological
features (see supplementary material, Supplementary
materials and methods), and grouped patients accord-
ing to their ISH-risk score levels. Patients with the
lowest quartile ISH scores had a 10-year DMFS of
78% (all breast cancer cohort) and 87% (TNBC
cohort) compared with 17% (all breast cancer cohort)
and 18% (TNBC cohort) for patients with an upper
quartile ISH score (Kaplan-Meier survival estimates;
log-rank test of difference in survival, p < 0.001,
HR 5 5.15, 95% CI 5 3.8–6.97; p < 0.001, HR 5 14.26,
95% CI 5 7.48–27.19) (Figure 4E and 4F). More-
over, LN-positive breast cancer patients with low
ISH score had even less risk of developing distant
metastases than LN-negative breast cancer patients
(Figure 4E,F, black dotted line). This suggests that
histomorphological changes within uninvolved and
involved LN carry significant prognostic information
for the risk of distant metastasis amongst LN-
positive patients, even among TNBCs.
Discussion
It is well known that routinely assessable clinicopatho-
logical characteristics such as LN status or the presence
of TILs predict the risk of recurrence, distant metastases
and overall outcome in breast cancer patients. In this
study, we have utilised an optimised multivariate pro-
portional hazard model for analysing ‘time-to-event’
data which was based on extensive H&E histopathologi-
cal data to determine whether these features are of prog-
nostic value in breast cancer. Reassuringly, well-
established prognostic markers were shown to be associ-
ated with outcome, including the presence of LN metas-
tases whilst we also confirm the value of the Salgado
classification [12]. We report, for the first time, that the
number and architecture of GCs in involved and unin-
volved LNs, as well as the presence of lymphocytic
lobulitis, provide important information for outcome
prediction. Selected through L2-regularized and cross-
validated proportional hazards models, we have devel-
oped a novel risk score, identifying patients with low
risk for developing metastases even amongst patients
with LN-positive breast cancers.
There is now increasing interest in the role of the
tumour micro-environment in cancer prognosis and, in
particular, the role of lymphocytic infiltrates and stro-
mal reactions. TIL composition within the primary
invasive tumour has proven to be superior to the clas-
sical tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging in
predicting outcome in some series [12]. TIL composi-
tion has also been shown to be predictive of response
to chemotherapeutic agents [8,20–22]. Much of this,
however, relies on complex multi-parametric surface
phenotyping of TILs from fresh frozen or freshly dis-
sociated tissues. Unsurprisingly, given the technical
challenges, financial constraints, and operator depend-
ence, these immune scoring systems have not been
widely adopted in routine clinical practice despite their
potential benefits. Our work provides a novel scoring
system that can accurately predict DMFS, particularly
in LN-positive and TNBCs, based on routine H&E
histopathological examination. Hence, unlike complex
multi-parametric assays, our method could be easily
integrated into standard clinical practice.
To our knowledge, we are the first to include the
histological features of uninvolved LNs into a predic-
tive model of DMFS for breast cancer patients.
Although draining LNs are the first site of metastasis
for many cancers, the histological progression from an
uninvolved to an involved LN remains poorly docu-
mented. A recent study in murine models found that
the stromal compartments in uninvolved LNs undergo
structural reorganisation due to the proliferation and
transcriptional changes of fibroblastic reticular cells,
potentially providing a pro-tumour environment [22].
While we cannot attribute changes to specific cell
types within the uninvolved LNs, we observed in this
study that patients with shorter time to any distant
metastasis had fewer and larger GCs, which were pre-
dominantly located in the centre of the node. GCs are
dynamic structures where B cells expressing high-
affinity, potentially tumour-reactive antibodies mature
into antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B
cells. Further studies are clearly warranted to elucidate
molecular signals in uninvolved LNs that may predict
development of nodal metastases.
The presence of lymphocytic lobulitis adjacent to
the primary tumour was another feature associated
with a reduced risk of recurrence in all breast cancers

 and TNBCs, including LN-positive cohorts. Lympho-
cytic lobulitis is characterised by perilobular and peri-
vascular aggregates of B and T lymphocytes with
increased expression of MHC class II antigens by the
lobular and ductal epithelium and has been described
in
prophylactic
mastectomies
from
women
with
BRCA1/2 mutations [23]. In normal breast tissue,
immune cells are predominantly localised to lobules.
In lymphocytic lobulitis, disproportionately higher
numbers of T cells (CD4 and CD8) and B cells (CD20)
are seen when compared with dendritic cells or mono-
cytes/macrophages. The role of these cells in the breast
is not entirely clear, although a role in tissue immune
surveillance has been proposed [24].
Through incorporating the variability of immune and
stromal composition at the primary tumour bed, along
with architectural changes in uninvolved and involved
LNs, we were able to develop an ISH risk score to iden-
tify low-risk patients among LN-positive breast cancers.
Effective biomarkers to guide clinical management are
of particular importance in high-risk patients such as
those with TNBC and LN-positive disease. These
patients are often referred for adjuvant chemotherapy
but only a proportion benefit from increased overall sur-
vival. Currently, there is a lack of validated biomarkers
to identify patients for whom less aggressive interven-
tion might be appropriate. Our ISH risk score was
derived through an unbiased approach, in which we
aimed to: (1) quantify the outcome prediction perform-
ance of regression results; (2) avoid overfitting via mon-
itoring of outcome prediction on unseen data; and (3)
construct a multivariate risk signature based on the opti-
mised covariate set. Thus, we propose that our ISH risk
score might be used for effective patient stratification,
although clearly this requires further evaluation.
This study has several limitations. Firstly, the
breast cancer cohort used was enriched for TNBCs
(170/309) which frequently have increased immune
infiltrates compared with other subtypes of breast
cancer. Thus, future studies in cohorts with higher
proportions of ER-positive or HER2-positive breast
cancers are warranted to corroborate the applicability
of these histomorphological features. Secondly, as a
high proportion of tumours, particularly TNBCs,
were of histological grade 3, this pathological charac-
teristic was non-discriminatory for risk prediction in
this cohort. In cohorts with more typical distribution
of histological grade of consecutive series of invasive
breast cancers, the inclusion of histological grade in
the multivariate model will need to be evaluated.
Finally, we have not as yet sub-categorised immune
and stromal cells in uninvolved LNs, particularly in
the GCs, with orthogonal experiments such as IHC
or immunofluorescence techniques. Although this
would shed further light on the pro-tumour evolving
micro-environment in these lymphoid organs, they
are beyond the scope of this manuscript.
In conclusion, our study highlights the added value
of comprehensive histopathological examination of
tumoural, peritumoural, and nodal features for the
prediction of distant metastases. By suppressing over-
fitting via repeated cross-validation and constructing
reproducible multivariate risk signatures, our mathe-
matical
approach
provides
a
robust
method
for
survival analysis beyond the commonly used Kaplan-
Meier
analyses.
Furthermore,
these
results
point
towards a novel histopathological prognostic tool that
improves 5-year DMFS prediction accuracy in high-
risk breast cancers and if validated, could be imple-
mented in standard histological practice.

Figure S1. Smooth muscle actin (SMA) and alcian blue staining of selected primary tumours with differing stromal features
Figure S2. Germinal centres of the LNs stained with CD20 (B cell marker) and CD11c (dendritic cell marker)
Figure S3. Identification of overfitting point in the Bayesian batch Cox analysis. Graphs illustrating the fraction of correctly predicted disease
outcome for patients (i.e. those who had an event prior the cut-off time) (prediction time point) over those patients who had either never distant
metastasis or developed metastasis after this time point. The top and bottom lines represent the validation and test sets, respectively. The num-
ber of covariates used for the prediction is shown on the x-axis (nr of covs). Iteratively, covariates are removed from the analysis
Figure S4. Correlations analysis of covariates. Plot showing all pairwise Pearson’s correlations for standard clinical features and all novel mor-
phological assessed features across 309 breast carcinomas in (A) and for all histopathological characteristics across TNBC (B). The list of
covariates is provided at the bottom, whereby immune-associated features are indicated in blue, features assessed in the uninvolved lymph
node in purple, in the involved lymph node in green, and standard clinicopathological features in black. We also included the relevant outcome
variable (TTE, time to event)
Figure S5. Optimised proportional hazards models to identify covariates for the prediction of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in all
breast cancers LN-negative and TNBC LN-negative cohorts
