Abstract
Knowledge on the genetic epidemiology of disorders in the dog population has implications
for both veterinary medicine and sustainable breeding. Limited data on frequencies of
genetic disease variants across breeds exists, and the disease heritage of mixed breed
dogs remains poorly explored to date. Advances in genetic screening technologies now
enable comprehensive investigations of the canine disease heritage, and generate health-
related big data that can be turned into action. We pursued population screening of genetic
variants implicated in Mendelian disorders in the largest canine study sample examined to
date by examining over 83,000 mixed breed and 18,000 purebred dogs representing 330
breeds for 152 known variants using a custom-designed beadchip microarray. We further
announce the creation of MyBreedData (www.mybreeddata.com), an online updated inher-
ited disorder prevalence resource with its foundation in the generated data. We identified
the most prevalent, and rare, disease susceptibility variants across the general dog popula-
tion while providing the first extensive snapshot of the mixed breed disease heritage.
Approximately two in five dogs carried at least one copy of a tested disease variant. Most
disease variants are shared by both mixed breeds and purebreds, while breed- or line-speci-
ficity of others is strongly suggested. Mixed breed dogs were more likely to carry a common
recessive disease, whereas purebreds were more likely to be genetically affected with one,
providing DNA-based evidence for hybrid vigor. We discovered genetic presence of 22 dis-
ease variants in at least one additional breed in which they were previously undescribed.
Some mutations likely manifest similarly independently of breed background; however, we
emphasize the need for follow up investigations in each case and provide a suggested vali-
dation protocol for broader consideration. In conclusion, our study provides unique insight
into genetic epidemiology of canine disease risk variants, and their relevance for veterinary
medicine, breeding programs and animal welfare.

 Author summary
Like any human, dogs may suffer from or pass on a variety of inherited disorders. Knowl-
edge of how likely a typical dog is to carry an inherited disorder in its genome, and which
disorders are the most common and relevant ones across dog breeds, is valuable for both
veterinary care and breeding of healthy dogs. We have explored the largest global dog
study sample collected to date, consisting of more than 100,000 mixed breed and purebred
dogs, to advance research on this subject. We found that mixed breed dogs and purebred
dogs potentially suffer from many of the same inherited disorders, and that around two in
five dogs carried at least one of the conditions that we screened for. A dog carrying an
inherited disorder is not a “bad dog”–but we humans responsible for breeding selections
do need to make sustainable decisions avoiding inbreeding, i.e. mating of dogs that are
close relatives. The disease prevalence information we generated during this study is made
available online (www.mybreeddata.com), as a free tool for breed and kennel clubs, breed-
ers, as well as the veterinary and scientific community.
Introduction
Nearly 700 inherited disorders and traits have been described in the domestic dog [1], one of
the most genetically well-studied species after humans. Consequently, the wide variety of mod-
ern dog breeds represent an excellent biomedical animal model population for identifying dis-
ease-related genes that commonly bear relevance for human health as well [2–4]. Knowledge
on the underpinnings and genetic epidemiology of canine disorders is also of great importance
for veterinary care, and for organizations such as kennel clubs, breed clubs, and dog registries
that establish guidelines for sustainable breeding practices. Although the primary focus of cur-
rent dog registries is on purebred dogs, understanding the genetic epidemiology of inherited
disorders in mixed breed dogs is equally relevant. Mixed breed dogs represent a substantial
part of the canine population in several countries such as in the United States (US) where 47%
of households surveyed in 2014 reported having a mixed breed dog [5].
To date, canine epidemiological studies have largely assessed the prevalence of disorders
perceived to be complex in their underpinnings, using endpoint diagnoses based on medical-
or insurance records as study phenotypes [6,7]. Such approaches are particularly appropriate
for complex disorders, for which no predictive direct genetic testing is typically available. In
the present study, we sought to fill a major information gap within canine genetic epidemiol-
ogy by pursuing comprehensive population screening of genetic variants implicated in Mende-
lian disorders. In canines, Mendelian disorders are of particular population level relevance due
to breed carrier frequencies that can be strikingly high (e.g., ~10–30% [8–10]). We have
recently shown in a proof-of-concept study that large-scale DNA screening of disease-impli-
cated variants across purebred dogs is technologically feasible, and represents an efficient diag-
nostic and research discovery tool for veterinary care, disease research, and breeding [11].
Here we harness that approach to conduct the largest DNA based exploration of the canine
disease heritage to date by screening 83,220 mixed breed dogs and 18,102 purebred dogs of
varying breed and geographical backgrounds for 152 known Mendelian disease variants, cov-
ering the majority of the current 212 canine entries in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Animals (OMIA) [1] database.
We present descriptive statistics on the proportion of dogs in the general population carry-
ing an inherited Mendelian disorder in their genome, and broadly characterize the relative

 prevalence of canine Mendelian disease variants in mixed breed dogs and in a representative
sample of purebreds. In an effort to make the generated, and future, big data easily available to
the canine health research community, we create a public canine inherited disorder prevalence
database, MyBreedData (www.mybreeddata.com). In conjunction with the conducted popula-
tion screening we discovered presence of several disease variants in additional breeds in which
they were previously undescribed, providing novel insight into the biological mechanisms
underlying disease predisposition for breed health research and management. Taken together,
our study provides unique insights into the genetic epidemiology of disease risk variants in
both mixed breed and purebred dogs, and their relevance for veterinary care, breeding pro-
grams, and animal welfare.
Results
High overall prevalence of genetic disease variants in both mixed breed and
purebred dogs
A total of 101,427 animals were included in the present study (83,220 mixed breed dogs;
18,102 purebred dogs representing 330 different breeds; and 105 wild canids; S1 Table). The
vast majority of all dogs (N = 96,514) were genotyped for a full set of 152 genetic variants
underlying canine inherited disorders (S2 Table). Of the 152 screened disease variants, 127
(83.6%) were observed in at least one dog in the study population. The majority of the disease
alleles (62.5%; N = 95) were encountered between 1–100 times (Fig 1A). Notably, a subset con-
sisting of the thirty most frequently observed disease alleles accounted for 96.1% of all disease
variants observed in the study sample.
We initially focused on a descriptive quantification of canine genetic disease allele presence
in the subset of dogs (N = 96,514; 83,220 mixed breed dogs and 13,294 purebred dogs from
303 breeds) that had been genotyped for a full set of 152 known disease variants. We found
that 40.5% of all dogs carried at least one of the tested disease variants in their genome in either
hetero- or homozygous state (Table 1). The maximum number of genetic disease variants
observed in any individual dog was 5.
Mixed breed and purebred dogs share the same common inherited disease
variants
Most tested disease variants were encountered in both mixed breed and purebred dogs
(N = 80) while others were exclusively observed in one of the groups (Fig 1B; S3 Table). Com-
parison of the two study populations most importantly confirms some disease variants as vir-
tually completely breed specific (e.g., Lagotto Romagnolo [N = 824] juvenile epilepsy [breed
carrier frequency 28.3%; absent in other dogs], Coton de Tulear [N = 253] canine multifocal
retinopathy 2 [breed carrier frequency 15.8%; absent in other dogs], Standard Poodle
[N = 184] neonatal encephalopathy with seizures [breed carrier frequency 16.8%; only
observed in one mixed breed dog], cystinuria type I-A of Newfoundlands [N = 67; breed car-
rier frequency 14.9%; only observed in one mixed breed dog], glycogen storage disease type
IIIa of Curly Coated Retrievers [N = 156; breed carrier frequency 8.3%; only observed in one
mixed breed dog], mucopolysaccharidosis type VII of Brazilian Terriers [N = 87; breed carrier
frequency 25.3%; absent in other dogs], and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase deficiency 1
of Clumber and Sussex Spaniels [N = 69; breed carrier frequency 30.4%; absent in other
dogs]). Conversely, other disease variants such as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 5 of Border
Collies and pyruvate kinase deficiency of Beagles are still segregating in mixed breed dogs but
potentially eradicated from their original discovery pure breeds (carrier frequencies in mixed

 breed dogs 0.12% and 0.01%, respectively, but not observed in 125 Border Collies or in 119
Beagles). While most canine Mendelian disorders are recessive, the dataset included genotypes
for nine variants characterized as following an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (S2
Table). The three dominant disease variants repeatedly observed in both mixed breed dogs
and in the combined purebred sample have been associated with primary hereditary cataract
[12], craniomandibular osteopathy [13], and cystinuria type II-A [14].
We subsequently identified the most common individual canine inherited disease variants
present in the study sample (N = 101,322 dogs after excluding wild canids). The twelve most
frequent disease variants in mixed breed dogs and in the combined population of purebred
dogs were essentially the same (Table 2), with the list consisting of likely ancient variants
known to be present in multiple breed groups. These variants predispose to disorders such as
degenerative myelopathy (DM; [15]), progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd-PRA; [16]),
hyperuricosuria (HUU; [17]), collie eye anomaly (CEA; [18]), exercise-induced collapse (EIC;
[19]) and von Willebrand’s disease type 1 (vWD 1; [20]). A complete prevalence-based ranking
list of all examined 152 disease variants with full allele and genotype counts is provided as S4

studied. For details on specific disorders and their allele counts, please refer to S3 and S4 Tables.

 A novel canine disease variant prevalence database—MyBreedData
This study generated an extensive dataset on the prevalence of known breed-relevant disorders
across a wide variety of purebreds. The full genotype raw data for all animals is available from
the Dryad Digital Repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dd91b). However, to make this
breed-specific genotype frequency data publicly available and easily accessible for breed health
research purposes, we have let it serve as a foundation for a newly created online resource
called the MyBreedData Canine Inherited Disorder Prevalence Database, accessible at http://
www.mybreeddata.com. The database features the possibility to search for disease variant
genotype frequencies by breed or disorder, and is amenable to regular updates to keep the
information current.
Genotyping-based evidence for hybrid vigor in mixed breed dogs
Actual genotype data based on molecular measurements across multiple disorders allows
direct analyses exploring the notion of whether mixed breed dogs shows signs of hybrid vigor
for recessive disorders. Conversely, one can search for signs of whether the general purebred
population shows an increased likelihood for inheriting two copies of the same recessive dis-
ease variant, as statistically expected in closed breeding populations. We restricted the analysis
to nine well known disease variants widespread across both the mixed and purebred popula-
tions that in clinical practice most closely follow an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance,
and are associated with phenotype effects that have late onset or remain largely undiagnosed
without detailed clinical examinations of the dog: DM, prcd-PRA, HUU, CEA, vWD 1, EIC,
multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1; [24]), primary lens luxation (PLL; [25]), and factor VII (FVII)
deficiency [26]. Characteristics of co-dominant inheritance are acknowledged for MDR1, but
the heterozygous state is typically not associated with a life-threatening deficiency. Genotypes
from 96,673 dogs (83,220 mixed breed and 13,453 purebred dogs) were available for the analy-
sis. We first examined whether mixed breed and purebred dogs differed in the number of dis-
ease variants carried in the heterozygous state, and observed that mixed breed dogs were 1.6
times more likely than purebreds (30.3% vs. 18.4% of dogs, respectively) to be carriers of at
least one of the nine recessive disease variants included in the analysis. The distribution of the

 number of disease variants carried in the heterozygous state differed significantly between
mixed breed dogs and the combined purebred sample, with a higher ratio of mixed breed dogs
being carriers of the common analyzed disease risk alleles (Fig 2A; χ2 (df = 3) = 842.78,
P < 10−4). However, when we compared the groups for the number of common recessive dis-
ease variants carried in the homozygous state, an opposite pattern emerged (Fig 2B). Purebred
dogs were 2.7 times more likely than mixed breed dogs to be genetically affected for at least
one of the common recessive disorders (3.9% vs. 1.4% of dogs, respectively); χ2 (df = 2) =
488.48, P < 10−4).
Clinical signs of canine inherited disorders are also observed in mixed
breed dogs
It is important to understand how the identified genetic risk variants will clinically manifest in
dogs of mixed breed ancestry in order to provide proper counseling to clinicians and dog own-
ers. We therefore pursued clinical validation of disease variants not previously described in
dogs of mixed breed ancestry by interviewing owners. These interviews sought to determine if
a dog genetically at risk of developing a disorder exhibited clinical manifestations similar to
those expected for the condition in the affected purebred population. We are continuously col-
lecting this type of information and, within the scope of this study, recount the following case
studies as examples.
A first clinical confirmation involved a 1.5-year old female spayed mixed breed dog of Lab-
rador Retriever/Rat Terrier/Siberian Husky/Golden Retriever/Australian Shepherd/mix ances-
try that was determined to be genetically at risk for exercise-induced collapse (EIC; [19]) as
described in several retriever and sporting breeds. On interview, the owner reported the dog
having experienced collapsing episodes during exercise/play on two separate occasions that
had prompted them to visit an emergency clinic where a medical cause was not identified. The
Fig 2. Patterns of common recessive disease variant presence in 96,673 dogs. (A) Comparison of 83,220 mixed breed dogs and 13,453 purebred dogs
revealed that mixed breed dogs were significantly more likely to carry one or several of nine examined common largely recessive disease variants in the
heterozygous state. (B) Conversely, dogs of the combined purebred sample were more likely to be genetically affected for one of the examined disorders, i.e.
carry at least one recessive disease variant in the homozygous state.

 owner was relieved to receive a genetic explanation enabling informed management of the
condition.
A second clinical confirmation involved an approximately 4-year-old male neutered Minia-
ture Poodle/Yorkshire Terrier/mix dog that also had some distant matches to the Parson Rus-
sell Terrier (greater than three generations ago). This dog carried two copies of the recessive
spinocerebellar ataxia (CAPN1 gene) mutation originally identified in Parson Russell and Jack
Russell Terriers [27]. The dog’s owner provided video evidence and confirmed that this dog
displayed the clinical signs associated with spinocerebellar ataxia including an abnormal hind
limb gait, uncoordinated movements, and impaired balance resulting in frequent falls; a fea-
ture the owner had always attributed to the dog “just being clumsy.” The dog was not reported
to have the more severe clinical manifestations of the disease including seizures, exercise intol-
erance or behavioral changes.
A third mixed breed dog evaluated was an 11-year-old male neutered Chow Chow/Chinese
Shar Pei/Collie/Miniature Poodle/mix dog that carried two copies of the skeletal dysplasia 2
(SD2; COL11A2 gene) mutation originally identified in Labrador Retrievers [28]. While this
dog did not show evidence of a recent Labrador Retriever ancestor, the client was not surprised
to learn of the mutation finding given they anticipated seeing a typical chondrodysplastic
breed, such as the Dachshund or Basset Hound, in his ancestral makeup given his appearance.
Images received from the owner confirmed that he did exhibit disproportionate dwarfism
resembling the more typical breed-defining chondrodysplasia variant in the FGF4 gene [29],
despite testing negative for this mutation.
Notably, of the aforementioned dogs, the CAPN1 and COL11A2 affecteds had higher than
expected homozygosity levels for mixed breed dogs indicating that they may have been the
result of matings between close relatives, which could explain the presence of two copies of a
rarer mutation on a mixed breed background.
Finally, numerous accounts of mixed breed dogs with one copy of the multidrug sensitivity
(MDR1) mutation [24] were also collected. One such account related to a mixed breed dog
(62.5% Beagle / 25% Australian Shepherd / 12.5% mix) whose owner was a veterinary clinician
and reported the dog exhibiting clinically noticeable mental alterations for several days post-
anesthesia before making a full recovery. More broadly, the collected accounts related to
MDR1 describe an appreciably delayed recovery from anesthetic procedures that include the
use of acepromazine and butorphanol as part of the anesthetic protocol. Processing and elimi-
nation of both medications are known to be affected by the MDR1 mutation. Owners and cli-
nicians reported that these dogs require up to four days to return to normal levels of activity
and mental acuity compared to dogs without the MDR1 mutation who receive the same anes-
thetic protocol and typically return to normal activities by the following day.
Disease variants discovered in additional purebreds
In addition to breeds in which particular disease mutations are known to exist, we identified
mutations present in other purebred populations in which they had not been previously
reported in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Following the routine operating procedure
adopted by our organization (Fig 3), we have pursued genetic and clinical validation of several
discoveries. We validated the genetic presence of 22 variants in a total of 81 breeds (Table 3).
Notably, several additional breeds genetically carry published risk variants for CEA, EIC, FVII
deficiency, HUU, prcd-PRA, and vWD 1. The spectrum of discoveries made includes both log-
ical findings in light of breed history (e.g., hereditary footpad hyperkeratosis (HFH) of Krom-
fohrla
¨nders and Irish Terriers [30] now discovered in Bedlington-, Welsh-, and German
Hunting Terriers), as well some more surprising ones. For an example, we unexpectedly

 discovered Australian Shepherd-type primary hereditary cataract [12] carried by American
(but no European) Miniature Pinschers, and the P2RY12 defect-related bleeding disorder vari-
ant originally characterized in Greater Swiss Mountain Dog [31] in Bichon Frise. Notably, we
also observed 1 out of 13 tested dingos carrying degenerative myelopathy, while none of the
other tested canine disease variants were found in gray wolves, coyotes or dingos.
Through case studies, we further aimed to establish clinical relevance for as many of the
genetic discoveries made through panel screening in additional breeds as possible. We have
previously reported on the genetic discovery of vWD type 1 in the Kromfohrla
¨nder breed [11],
and within the context of this study pursued further validation of the breed discovery. A blood
plasma sample from a female Kromfohrla
¨nder genetically affected for vWD type I was submit-
ted for vWF associated antigen (vWF:Ag) testing, with the results indicating decreased vWF
levels of 22% compared to the reference range indicated by the laboratory service provider
(55–150%), and a control sample from a genetically “clear” dog of the same breed submitted
simultaneously for testing (96%). Given the large number of additional breeds (Table 3 and
[11]) discovered to tentatively carry vWD type 2, we also submitted samples from dogs homo-
zygous for the originally published putative variant (VWF c.4937A>G; [32]) for vWF:Ag test-
ing (Table 4). The results of all tested dogs were either borderline or within the reference range
specified by the clinical testing laboratory, lending further support to the notion [23] that the
originally published variant is in fact not the causal variant in the gene.
The widespread progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd-PRA) mutation is generally
thought to have a highly penetrant effect, making genetic testing relevant across breeds [16].
Within the scope of this study, we were able to identify three Miniature Portuguese Podengos
and two Bolognese dogs with both an ophtalmological examination result indicating PRA
(Finnish Kennel Club Registry Database [33]), and DNA sample availability at the Canine
DNA Bank of the University of Helsinki/Folkha
¨lsan Research Center, Finland. All three
Podengos, and one of two Bologneses were confirmed by genetic testing to be homozygous for
the prcd-PRA mutation, further supporing the penetrance of the variant across breeds. Nota-
bly, the Podengos had been diagnosed with PRA at 6–9 years of age, suggesting late disease
onset in the breed.
Breed clubs representing Bedlington-, Welsh-, and German Hunting Terriers were con-
tacted regarding the hereditary footpad hyperkeratosis (HFH) risk variant discovery made in
the breeds. Breeders of Bedlington Terriers indicated that the phenotype is well known to exist
in the breed, albeit with a limited number of cases reported since the year 2000. Anecdotal evi-
dence provided by breeders suggested some individuals having privately pursued genetic

test result in dogs manifesting the phenotype. To the best of our knowledge, such observations
have not been published and although we are unable to directly confirm this we find it plausi-
ble that the same risk variant for HFH is shared and relevant across multiple terrier breeds.
Increased risk for urate urolithiasis conveyed by a well known hyperuricosuria (HUU) asso-
ciated variant in the SLC2A9 gene was reported in several breeds lacking recent common
ancestry [9]. Therefore, awareness and genetic testing for the variant is likely to be relevant in
additional discovered breeds (Table 3) where the mutation frequency is reasonably high (e.g.,

 Greater Swiss Mountain Dog). Outside of our primary study population, we further report the
discovery of a high carrier frequency of 31%, and genetically affected frequency of 8.5%, in the
Schapendoes breed. Through owner-submitted medical records, we confirm at least one Scha-
pendoes case showing urine sediment containing urate crystals, further highlighting the diag-
nostic value of genetic testing for the SLC2A9 variant across breeds.
Discussion
Purebred canines offer a model population in which, among other well-documented benefits
for genetic studies, the carrier frequencies of several Mendelian disorders are high [2,3]. Con-
sequently, comprehensive DNA screening for Mendelian disorders can have immediate practi-
cal relevance for breeding selections and veterinary care. Simultaneously, panel screening of
mutations provides an efficient platform for the initial discovery of disease variants in addi-
tional breeds—discoveries that are typically best explained by breed history in combination
with breeding practice as shown by our previous evaluation of 93 disease-associated variants
in approximately 7000 purebred dogs representing 230 breeds [11]. In the present study, we
further extended our work to cover 152 disease-implicated genetic variants in over 18,000
purebred dogs from 330 breeds. Concurrently, we provide the first ever snapshot of the disease
heritage of mixed breed dogs by examination of the same risk variants in over 80,000 mixed
breed dogs. To our knowledge, the examined population represents by far the largest canine
sample genotyped in a single study to date.
Like every human being, every dog is likely to carry a number of deleterious mutations in
its genome. The patterns of predicted deleterious genetic variation shaping the dog genome
have been explored in the past [34]. For the first time, our study covering a wide variety of
breed backgrounds provides a direct genetic screening-based quantitative estimate of the ratio
of dogs in the general canine population carrying a risk variant for Mendelian disorders:
around two in five dogs (40.5%). We note as a general limitation that any estimate of this type
is restricted to consideration of the population of hitherto identified disease variants included
in the screening. Notably, although the majority of the tested variants were observed at least
once in the study sample, around thirty common disorders account for the overwhelming
majority of the disease alleles observed. Such information could potentially be used to guide
veterinary education and pet care, and training in genetic counseling. At the other end of the
spectrum, we note that several disease variants described in the literature are likely extremely
rare in, or have been eradicated from, the general dog population (S3 Table, S4 Table). Careful
validation of all individual disorder assays with known genotype control samples or synthetic
oligonucleotide controls was performed, reducing the likelihood that a disorder would have
been undetected due to technical issues.
Our data further reveals that the most common genetic disease variants are essentially the
same in both the mixed and purebred populations. The finding is logical in light of all of the
most prevalent disease variants having been previously described in multiple different pure
breeds (Table 2). Such widespread disease variants are likely to be ancient in origin, predating
or having occurred early during the formation of modern dog breeds. Notably, with the excep-
tion of one dingo carrying the most widespread variant of them all–degenerative myelopathy
(DM)–the tested mutations were absent from the modern wild canids screened. The preva-
lence of many disorders in mixed breed dogs may be explained by the popularity of the breed
the disease mutation was originally discovered in (e.g., Labrador Retriever [American Kennel
Club [35] popularity ranking 1st]; Golden Retriever [3rd]; Beagle [5th], Australian Shepherd
[16th], Miniature Schnauzer [17th], or Shih Tzu [20th]) and the tendency of a breed to be
observed in the background of the studied US mixed breed dogs (e.g., American Staffordshire

 Terrier, Australian Cattle Dog, Beagle, and Golden Retriever; as indicated in the Materials and
methods section). Disease alleles are likely to abide in the mixed breed population due to ran-
dom mating and reduced selective pressure, as increased heterozygosity reduces the likelihood
of recessive disease allele homozygous dogs at risk of showing signs of a rare condition, and
many common conditions additionally have late onset, a minor effect on reproductive fitness,
or a minor clinical phenotype. As expected, dominant disease alleles encountered in our data-
set were described as exhibiting incomplete penetrance, adult age of onset, or clinical signs
that may not be evidently associated with a specific genetic cause, facilitating their segregation
in the population. In purebreds, disease allele presence may be influenced to a higher extent by
increased awareness of breed-relevant health issues combined with active negative selection
and restrictions imposed by breed organizations, such as mandatory DNA testing for breeding
dogs.
Statistical comparisons between the mixed breed and purebred populations are inherently
sensitive to challenges in defining “ideal” breed contributions for a representative global pure-
bred sample, as well as the availability of samples from individual breeds where bias may be
introduced by attitude differences between breed clubs regarding participation in DNA testing
activities. Nevertheless, comparison between the mixed breed sample and our purebred sam-
ple–a unique collection of dogs from a wide variety of more than 300 breed backgrounds
(median contribution of any individual breed to the combined purebred sample was only
0.19%)–provides important value in confirming complete, or virtually complete, breed-speci-
ficity for several disease variants. Such breed-specific mutations are likely to have arisen fairly
recently, subsequent to breed formation.
In an attempt to perform a fair comparison between mixed breed and purebred dogs, we
focused on nine largely recessive disease variants previously reported to exist in at least ten dif-
ferent pure breeds, and which were confirmed as common in both the mixed breed and pure-
bred populations also in the present study. A prevailing view is that purebred dogs are more
likely to be affected by inherited disorders (i.e., inherit a copy of the same recessive disease
mutation from each parent) than mixed breed dogs as a consequence of the limited breed gene
pool caused by genetic founder effects, intense selection, repeated inbreeding, and overuse of
popular sires [32]. Conversely, random mating and outcrossing in mixed breed dogs may
result in the health-increasing effects of hybrid vigor or heterosis through a reduced likelihood
of both parents of a dog being carriers of the same recessive disorder. We found that mixed
breed dogs were more likely to carry at least one of the evaluated disorders, but typically in a
harmless heterozygous state, presumably due to the reduced likelihood of two carriers of the
same condition having offspring. In contrast, purebreds were more likely to be genetically
affected for one of the disorders included in the investigation. We thus provide the first com-
prehensive direct genotyping-based evidence suggesting that enrichment of recessive disease
alleles in purebred dogs manifests as an overall higher proportion of the population being
“genetically affected” due to homozygosity for a disease variant. Our findings supplement pre-
vious observations of breed dogs carrying significantly more predicted deleterious amino acid
changing genotypes in the homozygous state relative to wolves [34].
Discovery of a disease-implicated variant on another genetic background does not equal
confirmation that presence of the variant leads to disease onset. During recent years concerns
have been raised by breeders, breed organizations and other community stakeholders regard-
ing the use and marketing of DNA tests for breeds in which the finding has not been appropri-
ately validated. Striving for increased harmonization within this field of DNA testing activities,
we provide a suggested best practice protocol (Fig 3) for broader consideration by relevant
stakeholders. In essence, detailed clinicopathological follow up studies are needed to ultimately
confirm whether a variant is of relevance across breeds, and should be considered in veterinary

 care and breeding. We are currently pursuing a number of such separate investigations aiming
to clinically validate the reported genetic findings (Table 3). Within the scope of this study, we
provide case studies exemplifying how at least a number of disease variants are likely to lead to
a similar disease phenotype on a mixed breed background. Awareness of inherited health risks
also in mixed breed dogs is therefore warranted. For instance, providing dog owners and veter-
inarians with knowledge of a mixed breed dog’s MDR1 genotype status prior to anesthetic pro-
cedures ensures that appropriate medication protocols or adjusted medication doses can be
used, thereby having a notable improvement in the dog’s clinical recovery and return to nor-
mal activities.
The wide variety of intriguing disease variant discoveries made in additional purebreds (in
which the variant was not known to exist according to current literature) further confirms the
utility of comprehensive panel screening as a research discovery, diagnostic, and breeding tool
(Table 3). In particular, we significantly expand the number of breeds potentially affected by
vWD type 1, prcd-PRA, factor VII deficiency, and HUU. We also provide a plausible genetic
explanation for hereditary footpad hyperkeratosis (HFH) in additional terrier breeds; a poten-
tial cause of PRA in the Brussels Griffon (Griffon Bruxellois); and hypotheses to explore
regarding cataract development in the Miniature Pinscher and potential bleeding propensity
in the Bichon Frise. Intriguingly, we found a genetic variant previously described to cause a
mild disproportionate dwarfism (skeletal dysplasia 2; SD2) in Labrador Retrievers [28] to be
the predominant allele in Sussex Spaniels (14/17 analyzed individuals homozygous, and 2/17
heterozygous). The SD2 variant, and the mild phenotype associated with it (short legs with
normal body length and width), represents a compelling putative explanation for short-legged-
ness in the Sussex Spaniel–a breed not reported to carry the common breed-defining chondro-
dysplasia variant in the FGF4 gene [29]. Of final particular note, during preparation of this
manuscript novel information emerged suggesting that the originally implicated risk variant
for vWD type 2 [32] may in fact not be causal, and that another variant in the VWF gene may
be the actual culprit [23]. This notion is supported by our findings of the originally published
“risk variant” in more than 10 additional breeds, and by our clinical VWF measurements in
dogs of several breeds at putative risk.
Modern genetic technologies now provide the means of generating “big data” to guide
canine DNA testing priorities, breeding selections, breed health research, veterinary education
and pet care. Turning big data into action is a challenge, which when hurdled is likely to have
important implications for animal welfare. As one supportive tool for aiding this development,
we announce the launch of the MyBreedData Canine Inherited Disorder Prevalence Database
(http://www.mybreeddata.com). The aim of the database is to make breed-specific disease var-
iant prevalence data publicly and easily accessible and amenable to regular updates. Such infor-
mation advances breed health research, supports organizations establishing breeding
guidelines (e.g., in determining whether a specific DNA test is relevant to the population in
question and should be mandatory/optional for the breed), as well as advocates for openness
on the part of DNA testing laboratories offering testing services to the breeder community
regarding the true population relevance of a marketed test.
In conclusion, we report that risk variants for genetic disorders are prevalent in the general
dog population, and confirm that mixed breed dogs may suffer from many of the same medical
conditions as purebreds. Mixed breed dogs were more likely to carry a common recessive
Mendelian disorder, while purebred dogs were more likely to be genetically at risk of one.
Some disease variants still segregating in mixed breeds may have been eradicated or reduced
in frequency through selective breeding in purebreds, while others are enriched in subsets of
breeds or are breed-specific. We further expand knowledge on the distribution of known dis-
ease variants across purebreds through a number of genetic discoveries, paving the way for

 further clinical follow up investigations. Taken together, our findings emphasize the need for
genetic testing as a tool to improve diagnostics, veterinary care, and ultimately the welfare of
all dogs through informed breeding decisions. Going beyond disorders that can currently be
tested for, all dogs—purebreds and mixed breed dogs alike—are likely to carry a number of
unknown deleterious mutations. A holistic approach and destigmatization of healthy dogs car-
rying inherited disorders, combined with sustainable breeding practices maintaining popula-
tion genetic diversity, is needed in the management of known disease mutations while
avoiding the enrichment of novel unknown ones.

two breeds (e.g., “designer” dogs) by the breed testing platform were excluded in order to
focus on truly mixed genetic backgrounds in the present study. The vast majority (92.6%) of
the mixed breed study sample consisted of dogs from the United States (US), with the United
Kingdom (UK; 3.3%) and Australia (2.3%) forming other notable subgroups (>1% of the sam-
ple). Noteworthy (>2% of estimated great-grandparents) representations of breed back-
grounds in the mixed breed dogs were from American Staffordshire Terrier (10.0%), Labrador
Retriever (7.0%), German Shepherd Dog (5.8%), Chow Chow (5.6%), Boxer (4.2%), Chihua-
hua (3.7%), Rottweiler (2.9%), Siberian Husky (2.8%), Australian Cattle Dog (2.6%), Golden
Retriever (2.5%), Miniature Poodle (2.2%), and Beagle (2.1%). The breed composition of addi-
tional mixed breed dogs studied for clinical validation of signs of inherited disease was
obtained using the commercially available Wisdom Panel breed ancestry test platform (Wis-
dom Health).
The purebred comparison sample (N = 18,102; S1 Table) consisted of dogs sampled at Wis-
dom Health (formerly Mars Veterinary) and Genoscoper Laboratories (Helsinki, Finland)
between January, 2005 and October, 2016. Part of the sample (N = 6788) overlapped with dogs
examined in our previous study [11]. The majority of tested dogs were from the US (44.1%),
Finland (28.3%) and UK (11.4%), with other major subgroups formed by dogs from Germany
(3.0%), the Netherlands (2.8%), Russia (2.2%), Australia (1.5%), and France (1.4%). For the
purposes of this study, dogs were defined as “purebred” if registered according to established
Fe
´de
´ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI), American Kennel Club (AKC), United Kennel
Club (UKC), or the Kennel Club (UK) standards, with limited exceptions made for some true-
breeding entities recognized by national registries. The purebred status of US dogs was addi-
tionally assessed using the Wisdom Panel platform (Wisdom Health). A total of 330 different
breeds were included in the purebred study sample, with 224 breeds represented by � 20 indi-
viduals. Breed inclusion in the study was independent of the number of disease variants
known to exist in the breed a priori. The median contribution of an individual breed to the
combined purebred study sample was 0.19% (min 0.006%; max 4.56%). In addition, archived
samples from wild canids were genotyped (Gray Wolves, N = 65; Coyotes, N = 27; Dingos,
N = 13).
Genetic analyses were carried out on DNA extracted from owner-collected, non-invasive
cheek swab samples, or from blood/cheek swab samples collected at certified veterinary clinics
in accordance with international standards for animal care and research. All dog owners pro-
vided consent for the use of their dog’s DNA sample for research purposes. Where applicable,
drawing of blood samples was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the State

Genotyping
Genotyping of 152 disease variants (S2 Table) was carried out according to manufacturer-rec-
ommended standard protocols on a custom-designed Illumina Infinium HD genotyping bead
chip targeting known point mutations, insertions, and deletions underlying canine inherited
disorders ([11]; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Marker selection was based on a review of
known canine disease-implicated variants [1]. Measures taken to ensure high quality genotyp-
ing data included: 1) validation of individual disease assays with known control samples; 2)
validation with synthetic oligonucleotides where no controls samples where available; 3) tech-
nical replicates of each disease assay; 4) manual review of genotype calls; and 5) a sample inclu-
sion criteria requiring genotype calls for �98% of the analyzed markers. Genotypes from
markers subject to patent- or license restrictions were stored only for research purposes, and
not reported to dog owners.
Disease allele findings in additional purebreds were confirmed by standard capillary
sequencing on an ABI3730xl DNA Analyzer platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) at the Sequencing Unit of the Finnish Institute of Molecular Medicine (FIMM).
Preparation and purification of PCR-products for sequencing was carried out as previously
described in detail [11] using ~20 ng of genomic template DNA and an Amplitaq Gold Master
Mix-based protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Wal-
tham, MA, USA).
Statistical analyses
The statistical significance of differences between mixed breed dogs and the combined pure-
bred study sample in the distribution of disease variants carried was evaluated with Pearson’s
chi-square contingency table (2x2 and 2x3) tests evaluating observed vs. expected cell counts.
For the analysis focusing on common recessive disorders carried in the heterozygous state,
dogs carrying four disease variants were combined with dogs carrying three disease variants
into a category of “�3 variants carried” due to the limited number of individuals in the afore-
mentioned category (N = 10). Similarly, in evaluation of common recessive disorders carried
in the homozygous state, dogs carrying three disease variants (N = 1) were combined with
dogs carrying two disease variants forming a category of “�2 variants carried”.
Clinical validation data
Medical background information and records on genetically affected dogs were collected
through interviews with dog owners, veterinary clinicians, and breed club representatives.
Public ophthalmological records were additionally accessed through the Finnish Kennel Club
Registry Database [33]. Blood plasma samples were routinely collected at certified veterinary
clinics, and submitted for vWF associated antigen (vWF:Ag) testing through either IDEXX
Laboratories (IDEXX Europe B.V., Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) or the Veterinary Diagnos-
tics Laboratory at the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands.
