Abstract
Objective: To explore associations between dietary quality and access to different
types of food outlets around both home and school in primary school-aged
children.
Design: Cross-sectional observational study.
Setting: Hampshire, UK.
Subjects: Children (n 1173) in the Southampton Women’s Survey underwent
dietary assessment at age 6 years by FFQ and a standardised diet quality score was
calculated. An activity space around each child’s home and school was created
using ArcGIS. Cross-sectional observational food outlet data were overlaid to
derive four food environment measures: counts of supermarkets, healthy specialty
stores (e.g. greengrocers), fast-food outlets and total number of outlets, and a
relative measure representing healthy outlets (supermarkets and specialty stores)
as a proportion of total retail and fast-food outlets.
Results: In univariate multilevel linear regression analyses, better diet score was
associated with exposure to greater number of healthy specialty stores (β = 0·025
SD/store: 95 % CI 0·007, 0·044) and greater exposure to healthy outlets relative to
all outlets in children’s activity spaces (β = 0·068 SD/10 % increase in healthy outlets
as a proportion of total outlets, 95 % CI 0·018, 0·117). After adjustment for mothers’
educational qualification and level of home neighbourhood deprivation, the
relationship between diet and healthy specialty stores remained robust (P = 0·002)
while the relationship with the relative measure weakened (P = 0·095). Greater
exposure to supermarkets and fast-food outlets was associated with better diet
only in the adjusted models (P = 0·017 and P = 0·014, respectively).
Conclusions: The results strengthen the argument for local authorities to increase
the number of healthy food outlets to which young children are exposed.

Primary school-aged children
Many high-income countries are facing an epidemic of
overweight and obesity(1) that starts in childhood(2,3). The
National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) shows
that over a fifth of children aged 4–5 years in the UK are
overweight or obese, increasing to over a third of children
aged 10–11 years(4). Poor diet is a core factor affecting
childhood obesity(5).
Globally, there is increasing evidence that the local food
environment is a determinant of both diet and weight
status(6–8). Among adults and children, greater access to
unhealthy food outlets is associated with higher levels of
overweight and obesity and poorer dietary behaviours(7,9,10).
However, despite a surge in studies assessing relationships
between food outlet access and health outcomes in recent
years, several gaps and methodological limitations exist.
A recent review concluded that measuring the food envir-
onment is complicated and there is an ongoing need for
further research using more robust measures(11).

 There is continued interest in understanding how the
food
environment
impacts
health-related
outcomes,
especially the risk of obesity and its contributing health
behaviours(12). Current evidence indicates that the asso-
ciation between local food environment exposures and
childhood dietary quality is stronger in the USA, with
trends less evident in other developed countries(6,7). There
are significant differences between the USA and the UK in
neighbourhood design(13,14) that may lead to differences in
how the food environment affects the health of commu-
nities. In addition, studies among children are less abun-
dant than those among adults despite recognition that
these two populations relate differently to their food
environments(15). Therefore, to inform public health policy
and intervention design, more UK studies among children
are needed(16).
In children, the majority of studies have assessed rela-
tionships between access to food outlets and BMI(9,10,17) as
opposed to diet. In addition, studies have focused on
access to one type of food outlet (usually fast-food outlets)
rather than examining a range of ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’
outlets. Reviews have recommended that future studies
include exposure to a range of outlets(13,18) and there is
increasing acknowledgment of the need to use relative
exposure measures(19) (which consider an outlet type
relative to all outlets in the area) in addition to absolute
count measures. In 2015, a systematic review concluded
that indices including multiple food outlets were most
consistently associated with obesity in adults(20). The
evidence relating to children remains limited.
The childhood food environment literature shows that
residential neighbourhood food environments are more
strongly associated with weight and dietary outcomes than
school neighbourhood food environments(17,21). How-
ever, to provide a more nuanced representation of chil-
dren’s daily food outlet exposure, activity space measures
including both home and school are needed. Activity
space can be defined as the subset of locations that an
individual comes into contact with as a result of his/her
daily mobility(22). For young children, home and school
represent two sites in which children typically spend the
vast majority of their time(23). Activity space measures
may also improve the specificity between exposure and
health behaviour or health outcome(22). Studies in adults
that account for exposures from multiple locations,
including both residential and non-residential settings,
are more strongly associated with health outcomes than
estimates based on exposures in one setting only(20,24).
To date, few published studies have used an activity
space approach to assess this relationship in young
children(21,25,26).
The majority of food environment studies have applied
proxy dietary measures, measuring only one aspect of
diet, rather than assessing overall diet quality(6,27,28).
Measuring dietary quality provides a more comprehensive
understanding of overall patterns of dietary behaviour and
is preferable to single nutrient or food measures when
quantifying non-communicable disease risk(29,30).
The present study aimed to address the limitations of
the current evidence. Its aims were to: (i) examine the
relationship between counts of supermarkets, healthy
specialty stores (greengrocers, health food stores, farm
shops and butchers), fast-food outlets (chains and take-
away outlets) and total number of retail and fast-food
outlets in children’s combined residential and school
neighbourhood with their dietary quality at 6 years; and
(ii) explore the relationship between a relative measure of
healthy outlets, as a proportion of total outlets, in chil-
dren’s combined residential and school neighbourhood
with their dietary quality at 6 years.
Materials and methods
Participants
Participants were children of women participating in the
Southampton Women’s Survey (SWS). The SWS is a pro-
spective cohort of 12 583 non-pregnant women recruited
between 1998 and 2002 when aged 20–34 years. Assess-
ments of smoking status and highest educational qualifi-
cation were made at study entry for all participants. Each
woman’s height and weight were measured by trained
research nurses and used to derive BMI. Those who
subsequently became pregnant were followed up; the
growth and development of the SWS children were
assessed periodically during infancy and childhood, and
the children continue to be followed-up. The study was
conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving
participants were approved by the Southampton and
South West Hampshire Local Research Ethics Committee.
Written informed consent was obtained from all parents of
participants. A full description of the SWS is published
elsewhere(31).
The present study used data from the 6-year follow-up
assessment for children conducted between 2007 and
2014, and mother’s SWS study entry assessment data. At
the 6-year follow-up, height (in centimetres) was mea-
sured using a portable stadiometer (Leicester Height
Measure; Seca). Child’s diet over the previous three
months was assessed using an interviewer-administered
eighty-item FFQ completed by each child’s parent or
guardian. Average frequency of consumption (ten options
from never, to number of times per day) of all listed foods
was recorded. Daily volumes, types and amounts of milks
were recorded as well as any sugar added to food.
A prudent diet score (dietary quality score) was calculated
for each child. The FFQ items were categorised into fifty-
one groups based on similarity of type of food or nutrient
composition. The reported standardised frequency of each
group was then multiplied by corresponding coefficients
identified from a principal components analysis and the
Food environment and diet quality in children
3317
 results summed. The dietary quality scores were standar-
dised to have a mean of 0 and SD of 1. Higher scores
represented better dietary quality and a dietary pattern
consistent
with
the
dietary
recommendations,
char-
acterised by frequent consumption of fruit, vegetables and
fish. A full description of FFQ delivery and analysis, as well
as creation of the dietary quality score, has been published
elsewhere(32). School and home postcodes were also
collected at the 6-year assessment. Home postcode was
used to determine the level of neighbourhood deprivation
for each child using quintiles of the 2010 English Index of
Multiple Deprivation.
Exposure area: activity space (home and school)
The exposure area applied was an activity space around
home and school. This method involves drawing bound-
aries around a number of individualised points to create
activity spaces(33). An activity space for each child was
created using geocoded home and school postcode cen-
troids as midpoints buffered by an 800 m radius. If these
home and school boundaries overlapped, the overlapping
area was merged to ensure that food outlets in these areas
were not duplicated. The 800 m buffer has been frequently
applied in the literature(34) and corresponds approxi-
mately to a 10 min walk for children(17,35). Euclidean dis-
tance (straight line) was used to buffer locations instead of
road network distance because the two measures are
highly correlated at 800 m in urban settings(34). The deci-
sion not to measure exposure in home and school envir-
onments separately was taken due to the urban setting and
the fact that fewer than 100 children had activity spaces
within which their home and school address did not
overlap.
Exposure variable: food stores
Food environment data were collected as part of the
process evaluation of the Southampton Initiative for
Health (SIH)(36). A list of 1682 food retail stores and fast-
food outlets and their postcodes in six council boundaries
(Southampton,
Eastleigh,
Fareham,
Gosport,
Havant,
Portsmouth) within Hampshire, UK, was compiled in July
and August 2010 using information from each Council’s
Food Safety Register. We used the directories Yellow
Pages and yell.com to supplement the local authority
registers in an effort to obtain a complete picture of food
outlet locations across the study area. Between July 2010
and June 2011, trained fieldworkers ‘ground-truthed’ the
study area and confirmed the existence and type of all
food retail stores and takeaway outlets; 245 were no
longer present and 350 additional outlets were identified,
making a total of 1787 outlets in the study area at the time
of data collection. A great proportion of the study area was
assessed; however, not all streets within the study area
were checked for food outlets. It is therefore possible that
some food outlets were missed. The food outlets were
geocoded using ArcGIS version 10.1 (2012; ESRI, Red-
lands, CA, USA) and data about the location of food outlets
were overlaid on to each child’s home and school
activity space.
Exposure variables included the count of three cate-
gories of outlets: (i) supermarkets, including high-range,
large, discount and small supermarkets; (ii) fast-food out-
lets, including fast-food chains and takeaway outlets; and
(iii) healthy specialty stores, including greengrocers,
health food stores, farm shops and butchers. These cate-
gories are similar to those used in previous research(37,38)
and the healthy specialty category included outlets aligned
with previous work(39). In addition to the total counts, a
relative measure was created, representing the number of
healthy food outlets as a proportion of all food retail stores
and fast-food outlets with each child’s activity space which
included convenience stores, newsagents, bakers, con-
fectioners and ‘world’ food stores as well as supermarkets,
healthy specialty stores and fast-food outlets.
Statistical analysis
Participants’ characteristics were summarised using means
and
SD for normally distributed continuous variables,
medians and interquartile range for non-normally dis-
tributed continuous variables, and numbers and percen-
tages for categorical variables.
All analyses investigating the research questions were
cross-sectional. Diet scores were standardised; thus the
units of the outcome measure are SD. Multilevel linear
regression models were used to assess the relationship
between the outcome measure, namely diet score, and
five predictor variables: (i) count of supermarkets; (ii)
count of healthy specialty stores; (iii) count of fast-food
and takeaway outlets; (iv) total number of outlets; and (v)
relative measure of healthy outlets as a proportion of total
food outlets. These multilevel models accounted for clus-
tering within schools (ρ = 0·05–0·06). The count models
were not mutually adjusted due to the high correlation
between fast-food outlets and healthy specialty stores
(r = 0·8).
We used the directed acyclic graph approach(40) to
select suitable confounders for linear regression models.
Potential confounding variables considered for the direc-
ted acyclic graph comprised age the child was last breast-
fed, maternal BMI, child’s height, child’s sex, maternal
educational attainment and home neighbourhood depri-
vation. Ethnicity was not considered to be a confounder
because of little variability: 96 % of the women participants
who had a live singleton birth were white and 94 % of their
children were also white. A directed acyclic graph identi-
fies that a variable is a confounder when it is causally
associated with at least two variables already included in
the model. The directed acyclic graph for the present
study identified two confounding variables that should be
included in our analyses: mother’s educational attainment
3318

 and level of neighbourhood deprivation (see online sup-
plementary material, Supplemental Fig. 1). Results are
presented for the adjusted and unadjusted models.
All statistical analyses were conducted using the statis-
tical software package Stata version 14.1. Geoconvert™
software was used to geocode home, school and food
outlet addresses, and ArcGIS version 10.3.1 was used to
create the activity spaces and food outlet exposure
variables.
Results
Characteristics of participants and food
environment exposures
The study included 1173 children (590 boys and 583 girls)
from the SWS 6-year assessment whose home and school
were both located in the food environment exposure area.
Table 1 presents the characteristics of the children and
their mothers. Girls were slightly shorter than boys and
had better mean diet scores. Mothers had a median pre-
pregnancy BMI of 24·3 (interquartile range 21·9–27·5) kg/m2,
which is at the higher end of the healthy weight range.
Approximately 14% of mothers smoked during pregnancy,
and 60% had qualifications higher than GSCE or equivalent
(at 16 years of age). Most children lived in neighbourhoods
of medium-level deprivation (70%), with 17% in the least
deprived quintile and 13% in the most deprived quintile.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of supermarkets, healthy
specialty stores and fast-food outlets in children’s activity
spaces. Nine per cent of children had no supermarket in
their activity space and 27 % had no healthy specialty
store. More than half (52 %) of the children were exposed
to ≥10 fast-food and takeaway outlets in the area sur-
rounding their home and school. Three children in the
study had ≥ 50 fast-food and takeaway outlets in their
activity spaces.
Relationship between food environment and
dietary quality
Table 2 shows that increasing counts of healthy specialty
stores in children’s activity spaces were associated with
better diet scores. A greater number of healthy specialty
stores was associated with higher diet score in both the
univariate multilevel linear regression model (β = 0·025 SD/
store, 95 % CI 0·007, 0·044; P = 0·008) and in the model
adjusted for educational attainment and level of neigh-
bourhood deprivation (β = 0·024/store, 95 % CI 0·009, 0·040;
P = 0·002; Fig. 2). Children with an additional two healthy
specialty stores around home and school had dietary
quality scores 0·04 SD greater than other children. This dif-
ference could for example be achieved by eating approxi-
mately one extra serving of green vegetables each week.
Increasing counts of supermarkets, fast-food outlets and
total number of retail and fast-food outlets were also
positively associated with better diet scores, but only in the
adjusted multilevel models (β = 0·044/store, 95 % CI 0·008,
0·079, P = 0·017; β = 0·009/outlet, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·016,
P = 0·014; β = 0·005/outlet, 95 % CI 0·001, 0·007, P = 0·005,

Discussion
Summary of findings
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine
how both absolute and relative exposure measures of
different types of food outlets in activity spaces relate
to overall dietary quality among primary school-aged
children. We found that children were exposed to
more unhealthy than healthy outlets in their home and
school environments. Greater access to healthy specialty
stores including greengrocers and health food stores
was consistently associated with better dietary quality.
Greater access to supermarkets and fast-food outlets
was also associated with better diet after adjustment
for
socio-economic
demographics,
suggesting
that
exposure to more food outlets per se was better for
diet. However, consideration of healthy outlets as a
proportion of total outlets showed a tendency for greater
exposure to more healthy food outlets and better dietary
quality.
Comparison with previous research
Previous research examining the relationship between the
local food environment and children’s health outcomes
has largely focused on weight and body composition,
rather than diet. This may be because large data sets such
as the UK’s NCMP provide data on BMI for very large
numbers of children at two time points (age 4–5 and 10–11
years) during primary school. The challenges of dietary
assessment, as opposed to measuring weight or BMI, may
indicate why diet has been considered less frequently than
body composition in the childhood food environment lit-
erature(7,27). Yet diet is a key determinant of weight status
and
empirical
evidence
exploring
the
relationship
between diet and spatial access to different food outlet
types is paramount to understanding the complexity of
how the food environment influences obesity in children.
Our findings provide empirical evidence for a relation-
ship between greater access to healthy outlets such as
greengrocers, which sell predominantly healthy minimally
processed food products, and better dietary quality among
younger primary school-aged children. This finding is
consistent with previous research from the UK which has
shown a range of health outcomes to be associated with
increased local access to healthier food outlets among
younger children. One study found that children with one
or more greengrocers or supermarkets around their home
had lower fizzy drink intake and percentage body fat than
children with no access to these outlets(41). Another study
showed that having greater access to healthy specialty
stores in the home neighbourhood was associated with
better bone health in children aged 4 years(42). Further-
more, a large national study observed that higher counts of
healthy specialty stores, supermarkets and cafés in the
home neighbourhood related to a lower prevalence
of overweight and obesity among young children (aged
4–5 years) but not older children (aged 10–11 years)(9).
Research from Australia involving 5–6- and 10–12-year-
olds identified no association between fruit and vegetable
intake and access to greengrocers around the home
but did observe that lower fruit intake related to greater
access to fast-food outlets and convenience stores(43).
These Australian findings differ from the UK evidence,
but it may be that the larger numbers of children aged
10–12 years involved in the Australian study were driving
the overall results and that differential age effects may
have been observed had those analyses included younger
children.
Collectively, the results of the studies described above
indicate that food retailing influences the dietary patterns
of children differently depending on their age. Older
children are likely to have greater independent purchasing
opportunities than younger children whose diets are more
likely to be under greater influence of parental food
decisions(44). Parents may be more inclined to shop at
conveniently located greengrocers or farm shops as part of
household grocery shopping habits, while older children
may have pocket money and greater independence
than younger children, enabling them to purchase less
healthy food items from convenience stores or fast-food
outlets for immediate consumption. Current strategies
to improve the food retail landscape are focused pre-
dominantly on reducing access to fast-food and takeaway
outlets(45). However, it may be pertinent to also explore
opportunities to increase access to healthy specialty stores,
which have diminished in number in recent years(46), in
order to improve the diets and weight status of younger
children.
The results of the current study showed that, like heal-
thy specialty stores, higher numbers of supermarkets and
fast-food outlets in home and school neighbourhoods
were associated with better dietary patterns. These find-
ings could indicate that increased access to food outlets
per se may improve diet. However, they could also be
indicative of collinearity of different types of food outlets,
which often are co-located in retail precincts. Empirical
evidence from the USA showed that because fast-food
outlets and banks are often co-located in areas of high
Food environment and diet quality in children
3321
 commercial density, both access to fast-food outlets and
access to banks were independently positively associated
with obesity prevalence(47). Having greater access to areas
of high commercial density may enhance behavioural and
health
outcomes
through
mechanisms
of
increased
employment and increased concentration of community
services and resources(48). The use of relative measures of
food outlet exposure is a methodological strategy that
endeavours to somewhat account for outlet co-location
and overcome issues of multicollinearity occurring during
statistical analyses(19). Our results for the relative measure
showed that more healthy outlets relative to the propor-
tion of total outlets in home and school environment was
associated with better dietary quality, although the rela-
tionship weakened after adjustment for socio-economic
variables. These results are similar to a Canadian study
which found that an increased ratio of ‘unhealthful’ to
‘healthful’ outlets in the school neighbourhood only was
weakly associated with higher intake of sugar-sweetened
beverages and lower daily fruit and vegetable intake(21).
The results of the relative measure and the larger effect
sizes for associations between diet and exposure to
supermarkets and healthy specialty stores than fast-food
outlets identified in the current study suggest that more
can be done to improve the balance of healthy and
unhealthy food outlets in retail precincts.
Supermarkets sell a large variety of both healthy and
unhealthy products ranging from fresh fruit and vegetables
to ultra-processed foods that are high in saturated fat,
sugar and salt, making it difficult to classify supermarkets
as healthy or unhealthy(7). Our findings are consistent with
findings from a previous UK study among children aged
9–10 years which found that greater density of super-
markets was associated with an increased intake of both
healthy and unhealthy foods(49). More recent UK research
has also shown that the volume of unhealthy food product
sales from a supermarket within the home neighbourhood
was associated with prevalence of overweight and obesity
among children aged 4–5 and 10–11 years(50). Future
research considering both the density of different types of
food outlets and the marketing activities within super-
markets is necessary to better understand the multiple
environmental determinants of children’s diet and weight
status(7).
Strengths and limitations
Two main strengths of the present study are the ‘activity
space’ approach covering both home and school envir-
onments, and the use of absolute (count) measures as well
as a relative measure of access to a range of food outlets.
Relative measures are more comprehensive, but absolute
measures help policy makers and practitioners interpret
results(19). A further strength of the study was the use of an
FFQ administered by trained research nurses that enabled
calculation of an overall measure of children’s dietary
quality rather than the proxy dietary measures seen in
much of the literature. The focus on younger children in
the UK is a further strength because food environment
research
has
focused
predominantly
on
adults
and
adolescents and has mainly come from the USA.
The study also has some limitations, many of which
are common to research assessing food outlet access.
Measuring
dietary
quality
accurately
is
challenging
and
response
bias
in
FFQ
is
possible.
However,
interviewer-administered questionnaires have generally
shown greater accuracy than self-administered ques-
tionnaires(51). FFQ capture data from a higher proportion
of the population than other dietary measures, thus
increasing the likelihood of a more representative sample.
The
study
was
observational
and
cross-sectional
in
design and results therefore could be due to residual
confounding. However, a directed acyclic graph approach
was used to identify appropriate confounding variables
and adjustments made accordingly (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Dietary data were collected at a different time from the
food outlet data and it is therefore possible that the
number and location of food outlets may not be an
accurate representation for some children. However, this
is a recognised limitation of much food environment
research(18). The sample comes from a pre-conception
cohort study where attrition over time means the sample
may not be entirely representative of children aged 6 years
in the UK.
Geographical analysis using GIS (geographic informa-
tion system) software has recognised limitations, including
assumptions made about food choices being primarily
determined by people’s proximity to food outlets. In
addition, it does not account for factors such as taste
preferences, social norms or affordability(11). While the
geocoding of addresses can also introduce bias, very few
locations were not matched in the present study (<3 %)
and this small number is most likely due to the overlap
between the study period and the Geoconvert data (both
2011). The use of GPS (Global Positioning System) tech-
nology might have allowed for a more accurate measure
of food environment exposure, but the use of such
measures is still in its infancy and poses a number of
difficulties, not least technical challenges including signal
loss, delay in acquiring satellite signal, precision of the
device, battery power, or participants forgetting to switch
the device on(16,52). These are perhaps reasons why very
few food environment studies to date have used GPS
technology, especially in young children.
Public health implications
The present study contributes to the empirical evidence
supporting government action to improve the nutritional
quality of food outlets that children have access to in
their home and school environments in order to improve
their diets and health. In the UK, the National Planning
3322
M Barrett et al.
 Policy Framework includes the requirement for planning
departments to promote healthy communities, taking
into account and supporting local Joint Health and
Wellbeing
Strategies(53).
Outcomes
identified
in
the
Public Health Outcomes Framework include a specific
indicator about excess weight in 4–5- and 10–11-year-
olds(54), giving local public health teams the opportunity to
work strategically with planning and environment collea-
gues in local authorities to meet these joint objectives.
Prompted by the guidance in 2014 from Public Health
England
and
the
Local
Government
Association,
an
increasing number of local authorities are responding by
introducing planning laws to ban outlets selling hot take-
away foods within 400 m of schools as well as placing
general restrictions on the clustering of takeaway outlets(55).
This recommendation has not been implemented in the
study area. The findings of our study support action to
increase access to healthy food outlets, especially healthy
specialty stores such as greengrocers, in both home and
school environments. Financial constraints on local autho-
rities may prevent the introduction of such policies or
laws. However, robust evaluation of these policies, to
demonstrate health and/or financial benefits from making
changes, or support from central government grants could
provide further impetus for councillors to take action.
A common-sense approach, implemented over a period of
time, could allow for increased access to stores selling
predominantly healthy foods.
Recent reviews indicate that more longitudinal evidence
is needed and that more attention needs be given to the
reliability and validity of food environment exposure
measurement tools(11,56). In addition, qualitative research
and community-based methods with children and families
would enhance our understanding of how children inter-
act with their local food outlets and could help them to
advocate for changes to their local food environment(57).
Building knowledge of the different accessibility issues for
younger and older primary school-aged children as well as
adolescents could offer additional support for action by
local authorities to improve the imbalance in the current
retail food environment.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the food environment around
home and school to which young children are exposed is
associated with their diet quality, with access to greater
numbers of all food outlets being associated with better
diet quality. However, the effect size for healthy outlets is
greater than for other outlet types, suggesting there is an
opportunity for local authorities to use their powers to
increase the numbers of healthy stores that families with
young children have access to. Further evidence from
intervention, longitudinal and qualitative research is nee-
ded to support the case for action.
