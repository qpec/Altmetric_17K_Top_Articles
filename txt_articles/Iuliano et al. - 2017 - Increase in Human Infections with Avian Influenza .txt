On March 3, 2017, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
During March 2013–February 24, 2017, annual epidemics 
of avian influenza A(H7N9) in China resulted in 1,258 avian 
influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in humans being reported 
to the World Health Organization (WHO) by the National 
Health and Family Planning Commission of China and other 
regional sources (1). During the first four epidemics, 88% 
of patients developed pneumonia, 68% were admitted to 
an intensive care unit, and 41% died (2). Candidate vaccine 
viruses (CVVs) were developed, and vaccine was manufactured 
based on representative viruses detected after the emergence 
of A(H7N9) virus in humans in 2013. During the ongoing 
fifth epidemic (beginning October 1, 2016),* 460 human 
infections with A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including 
453 in mainland China, six associated with travel to mainland 
China from Hong Kong (four cases), Macao (one) and Taiwan 
(one), and one in an asymptomatic poultry worker in Macao 
(1). Although the clinical characteristics and risk factors for 
human infections do not appear to have changed (2,3), the 
reported human infections during the fifth epidemic represent 
a significant increase compared with the first four epidemics, 
which resulted in 135 (first epidemic), 320 (second), 226 
(third), and 119 (fourth epidemic) human infections (2). 
Most human infections continue to result in severe respiratory 
illness and have been associated with poultry exposure. 
Although some limited human-to-human spread continues 
to be identified, no sustained human-to-human A(H7N9) 
transmission has been observed (2,3).
CDC analysis of 74 hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences 
from A(H7N9) virus samples collected from infected persons 
or live bird market environments during the fifth epidemic, 
which are available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All 
Influenza Data (GISAID) database (4,5), indicates that 
A(H7N9) viruses have diverged into two distinct genetic 
lineages. Available fifth epidemic viruses belong to two 
distinct lineages, the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta 
lineage, and ongoing analyses have found that 69 (93%) of 
the 74 HA gene sequences to date have been Yangtze River 
Delta lineage viruses. Preliminary antigenic analysis of recent 
* Epidemics refer to the seasonal increases in human infections; the fifth epidemic 
began on October 1, 2016.
Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses isolated from infections 
detected in Hong Kong indicate reduced cross-reactivity with 
existing CVVs, whereas viruses belonging to the Pearl River 
Delta lineage are still well inhibited by ferret antisera raised 
to CVVs. These preliminary data suggest that viruses from 
the Yangtze River Delta lineage are antigenically distinct from 
earlier A(H7N9) viruses and from existing CVVs. In addition, 
ongoing genetic analysis of neuraminidase genes from fifth 
epidemic viruses indicate that approximately 7%–9% of the 
viruses analyzed to date have known or suspected markers for 
reduced susceptibility to one or more neuraminidase inhibitor 
antiviral medications. The neuraminidase inhibitor class of 
antiviral drugs is currently recommended for the treatment of 
human infection with A(H7N9) virus. Antiviral resistance can 
arise spontaneously or emerge during the course of treatment. 
Many of the A(H7N9) virus samples collected from human 
infections in China might have been collected after antiviral 
treatment had begun.
Although all A(H7N9) viruses characterized from the 
previous four epidemics have been low pathogenic avian 
influenza viruses, analysis of human (three) and environmental 
(seven) samples from the fifth epidemic demonstrate that these 
viruses contain a four–amino acid insertion in a host protease 
cleavage site in the HA protein that is characteristic of highly 
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Chinese authorities 
are investigating and monitoring closely for outbreaks of HPAI 
A(H7N9) among poultry.
Since April 2013, the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool has 
been used by CDC to assess the risk posed by certain novel 
influenza A viruses. Although the current risk to the public’s 
health from A(H7N9) viruses is low, among the 12 novel influ-
enza A viruses evaluated with this tool, A(H7N9) viruses have 
the highest risk score and are characterized as posing moder-
ate–high potential pandemic risk (6). Experts from the World 
Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance 
and Response System (GISRS) met in Geneva, Switzerland, 
February 27–March 1, 2017, to review available epidemiologic 
and virologic data related to influenza A(H7N9) viruses to 
evaluate the need to produce additional CVVs to maximize 
influenza pandemic preparedness. Two additional H7N9 CVVs 
were recommended for development: a new CVV derived from 
an A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016-like virus (HPAI), which is a

highly pathogenic virus from the Yangtze River Delta lineage; 
and a new CVV derived from A/Hunan/2650/2016-like virus, 
which is a low pathogenic virus also from the Yangtze River 
Delta lineage (1). At this time, CDC is preparing a CVV derived 
from an A/Hunan/2650/2016-like virus using reverse genetics. 
Further preparedness measures will be informed by ongoing 
analysis of genetic, antigenic, and epidemiologic data and how 
these data impact the risk assessment. CDC will continue to 
work closely with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention to support the response to this epidemic. Guidance 
for U.S. clinicians who might be evaluating patients with possible 
H7N9 virus infection and travelers to China is available online 
(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h7n9-virus.htm).
