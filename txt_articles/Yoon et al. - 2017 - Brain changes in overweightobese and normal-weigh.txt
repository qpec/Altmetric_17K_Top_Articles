Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Overweight and obesity may significantly
worsen glycaemic and metabolic control in type 2 diabetes.
However, little is known about the effects of overweight and
obesity on the brains of people with type 2 diabetes. Here, we
investigate whether the presence of overweight or obesity in-
fluences the brain and cognitive functions during early stage
type 2 diabetes.
Methods This study attempted to uncouple the effects of
overweight/obesity from those of type 2 diabetes on brain
structures and cognition. Overweight/obese participants with
type 2 diabetes had more severe and progressive abnormalities
in their brain structures and cognition during early stage type 2
diabetes compared with participants with normal weight.
Relationships between each of these measures and disease
duration were also examined.
Results Global mean cortical thickness was lower in the
overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group than in the
normal-weight type 2 diabetes group (z = −2.96, p for
group effect = 0.003). A negative correlation was ob-
served between disease duration and global mean white
matter integrity (z = 2.42, p for interaction = 0.02) in the
overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group, but not in the
normal-weight type 2 diabetes group. Overweight/obese indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes showed a decrease in psychomotor
speed performance related to disease duration (z = −2.12, p for
interaction = 0.03), while normal-weight participants did not.
Conclusions/interpretation The current study attempted to
uncouple the effects of overweight/obesity from those of type
2 diabetes on brain structures and cognition. Overweight/
obese participants with type 2 diabetes had more severe and
progressive abnormalities in brain structures and cognition
during early stage type 2 diabetes compared with normal-
weight participants.

 Introduction
Chronic type 2 diabetes increases the risk of various compli-
cations in multiple organs, including the brain [1].
Complications in the brain due to type 2 diabetes may accel-
erate cognitive dysfunction and may even increase the risk of
dementia [2–5]. Type 2 diabetes-related cerebral atrophy and
white matter lesions have been considered brain correlates
linking type 2 diabetes and cognitive dysfunction [6].
Although the exact mechanism underlying type 2 diabetes-
related brain alterations is not fully understood, several meta-
bolic dysfunctions including insulin resistance, poor
glycaemic control and inflammation have been suggested to
be involved [5, 6].
In general, obesity may precede the onset of type 2 diabetes
and is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2
diabetes [7, 8]. Furthermore, obesity has been linked to met-
abolic dysfunction and may further exacerbate type 2
diabetes-related metabolic abnormalities [9, 10]. Obesity-
related metabolic dysfunction is also independently associated
with brain alterations [11–13] and may impair cognitive func-
tion, which further increases the risk of dementia [14].
However, little is known about how the concurrent presence
of overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes may affect the
brain. As the type 2 diabetes phenotype was recently sug-
gested to differ between normal-weight and obese people
[15, 16], it is important to study type 2 diabetic individuals
according to their weight status.
As the increasing prevalence of overweight/obesity may
contribute to the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes [17], it
is important to understand the potential combined effects of
overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes on brain structure and
cognitive function.
The primary aim of this study was to examine whether
the presence of overweight/obesity may influence type 2
diabetes-related brain structural changes and cognitive dys-
function. Since brain structural changes may begin a long
time before the clinical manifestation of cognitive impair-
ment [18, 19], our study participants consisted of partici-
pants who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within
the past 5 years and had no chronic diabetic complica-
tions. Thus, they were considered to be in the early stages
of type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Participants
Participants included 50 overweight/obese individuals with
physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes and aged between 30
and 60 years (disease duration <5 years). Standard BMI cut-
offs were used to define overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2) and
obesity (≥30 kg/m2) [20, 21]. Fifty normal-weight (BMI
<25 kg/m2) individuals with type 2 diabetes matched for
age, sex and disease duration and 50 normal-weight control
individuals (without type 2 diabetes) matched for age and sex
were also included in the study. The latter were defined as
having a fasting plasma glucose level of <5.55 mmol/l and a
2 h postprandial plasma glucose level of <7.77 mmol/l [22].
HbA1c levels of all normal-weight control individuals were
<5.7% (39 mmol/mol) [23].
Individuals with type 2 diabetes who had chronic dia-
betic complications including clinical diabetic nephropathy,
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, painful or symptomatic
diabetic neuropathy, or major cerebrovascular or cardiovas-
cular events were excluded. Individuals with major medi-
cal, neurological or psychiatric disorders and those with
contraindications to MRI were also excluded from the
study.
All type 2 diabetic patients were undergoing lifestyle
modification therapy and/or taking oral glucose-lowering
agents to achieve adequate glycaemic control. None had
received stable insulin therapy or experienced prior
hypoglycaemic episodes requiring medical assistance
[24].
Fifty overweight/obese type 2 diabetic participants
(BMI range, 25.2–34.1 kg/m2; hereafter referred to as
the overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group), 50
normal-weight type 2 diabetic participants (BMI range,
17.9–24.9 kg/m2; hereafter referred to as the normal-
weight type 2 diabetes group) and 50 normal-weight
control participants (BMI range, 19.0–24.9 kg/m2; here-
after referred to as the normal-weight control group)
completed assessments that included metabolic, brain
and cognitive measures. Of these 150 individuals, 23
in the overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group, 28 in
the normal-weight type 2 diabetes group and 39 in the
normal-weight control group underwent another assess-
ment 1 year after the initial visit (Table 1). A total of
240 sets of brain images and cognitive performance data
were included in the final analyses. Electronic supplementary
material (ESM) Fig. 1 shows BMI changes in the overweight/
obese and normal-weight type 2 diabetes groups plotted
against disease duration.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board of the College of Medicine, Catholic
University of Korea. All individuals provided written
informed consent prior to participation.
Clinical and metabolic assessments
The characteristics, medical history and medication sta-
tus of all participants were assessed at the initial visit
and 1 year follow-up. BP, glycaemic control, renal func-
tion and lipid profiles were also evaluated. HbA1c,

 HOMA-IR and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-
CRP) were evaluated as metabolic markers for
glycaemic control, insulin resistance and subclinical sys-
temic inflammation, respectively.

 Brain imaging
Brain MRI data were acquired using a 1.5 Tesla whole-body
imaging system (Signa HDx, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI,
USA) at the initial visit and 1 year follow-up.
Mean thickness across the entire cortex (global mean
thickness) was the primary outcome measure of type 2
diabetes-related grey matter alterations. In addition,
vertex-wise analyses were performed to examine group
differences in global mean thickness between the total
type 2 diabetes group (comprising the overweight/obese
and normal-weight type 2 diabetes groups) and the
normal-weight control group.
The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value across the
whole brain white matter skeleton (global mean FA) was the
primary outcome measure for type 2 diabetes-related white
matter alterations. In addition, voxel-wise analyses were per-
formed to examine differences in FA values between the total
type 2 diabetes group and the normal-weight control group.
Detailed information on acquisition variables and imaging
preprocessing is presented in the following ESM Methods
sections: MRI acquisition and preprocessing, Cortical thick-
ness measurement and FA measurement.
Cognitive assessments
Memory, psychomotor speed and executive function were
assessed using a series of neuropsychological tests because
these cognitive functions are known to be affected in people
with type 2 diabetes [6, 25, 26].
The Rey–Osterrieth complex figure test and California
Verbal Learning Test were used to assess memory function.
Psychomotor speed was measured using the digit symbol sub-
stitution test, the Stroop test – C form and the grooved
pegboard test. Executive function was examined using trail
making test B, the Stroop test – interference and the
Wisconsin card sorting test.
Composite scores in the memory, psychomotor speed and
executive function tests were chosen as the outcome measures
to examine between-group differences in cognitive changes
during early stage type 2 diabetes. Neuropsychological tests
are described in ESM Table 1.
Statistical analysis Group differences in brain and cognitive
measures between the total type 2 diabetes group and the
normal-weight control group were examined using a linear
mixed-effects model with group (type 2 diabetes vs control
group) as a fixed-effect term and within-individual depen-
dence as a random-effect term. Age and sex were included
as covariates. Intracranial volume (ICV) and educational level
were included as additional covariates for estimating group
differences in global mean thickness and cognitive measures,
respectively.
A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate whether
disease duration has different effects on metabolic, brain and
cognitive measures between the two subgroups of type 2 dia-
betic participants. This model included weight status (over-
weight/obese vs normal-weight) as a linear term for disease
duration (time since diagnosis of type 2 diabetes) and their
interactions as fixed effects and as within-individual random
effects. Models including disease duration and interaction as
additional higher-order terms were also tested and then a like-
lihood ratio test was performed to compare models for
selecting the best-fitting model. Age and sex were included
in the models as covariates. ICV and education level were
included as additional covariates for estimating global mean
thickness and cognitive measures, respectively. Terms includ-
ed in each final best-fitting model are shown in ESM Table 2.
We also investigated region-specific interaction effects be-
tween disease duration and weight status on brain measures
using a linear mixed-effects model. Mean cortical thickness
and FAvalues for regions of interest (ROIs; defined as significant
grey and white matter clusters for the total type 2 diabetes group
effects; Tables 2 and 3, ESM Table 3), were also estimated.
Raw values for global mean thickness, global mean FA
values and composite scores for cognitive functions were
standardised into z scores using the means and SDs for the
normal-weight control group.
The sample size of 50 control and 100 type 2 diabetic
participants was large enough to detect an effect size of 0.6
for differences in each measurement (SD = 15%) between
groups, with a power of 0.90 and an α level of 0.05.
An α level of 0.05 in two-tailed tests was considered as
statistically significant. Data were analysed using Stata ver-
sion 11 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Study participants Baseline demographic and clinical char-
acteristics of study participants are presented in Table 1. At the
initial assessment, the overweight/obese and normal-weight
type 2 diabetes groups had similar demographic characteris-
tics, metabolic data and medication use, except for fasting C-
peptide levels (t = −2.07, p = 0.04).
Disease duration-related alterations in metabolic measures
in the overweight/obese and normal-weight type 2 diabetes
groups Metabolic measures including HbA1c, HOMA-IR and
hs-CRP for the two type 2 diabetes subgroups are presented in
Fig. 1.
A U-shaped relationship was observed between disease dura-
tion and HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetic individuals. HbA1c levels
were lower in the first 2 years after type 2 diabetes diagnosis.
After the 2 year mark since diagnosis, HbA1c levels were elevated
in both the overweight/obese and normal-weight type 2 diabetes
1210

 groups, although they were higher in the former. However, there
was no interaction effect of disease duration and weight status on
HbA1c levels (z = 0.65, p for interaction = 0.51; Fig. 1b).
HOMA-IR, which reflects insulin resistance, correlated
negatively with disease duration in both type 2 diabetes
groups, and there was no between-group difference in the
relationship between HOMA-IR and disease duration
(z = −0.61, p for interaction = 0.54; Fig. 1d).
A positive relationship between hs-CRP level and disease
duration was observed in the overweight/obese type 2 diabetes
group, while a negative relationship was observed in the
normal-weight type 2 diabetes group (z = 2.57, p for interac-
tion = 0.01; Fig. 1f).
Differences in brain measures between the type 2 diabetes
and control groups There were differences in the global
mean thickness (z = −2.72, p for group effect = 0.006) and
the global mean FA (z = −3.73, p for group effect <0.001)
between the total type 2 diabetes group and the normal-
weight control group. Vertex-wise cortical thickness analysis
showed that grey matter was significantly thinner in clusters
in the temporal, prefrontoparietal, motor and occipital cortices
in the total type 2 diabetes group than in the normal-weight
control group (at a corrected p value of <0.05; Table 2 and
ESM Fig. 2a). Voxel-wise FA analysis showed that FA values
were significantly lower in clusters in the temporal,
prefrontoparietal, motor and occipital regions in the total type
2 diabetes group than in the normal-weight control group (at a
corrected p value of <0.05; Table 3, ESM Fig. 2b). In addition,
tract-specific alterations were examined using the Johns
Hopkins University diffusion tensor imaging-based white mat-
ter atlas [27]. FA values from the major fibre tracts were ex-
tracted and compared between groups (ESM Fig. 3).
Disease duration-related alterations in brain measures in
the overweight/obese and normal-weight type 2 diabetes
groups Brain measures including global mean thickness and
global mean FA of the two type 2 diabetes subgroups are
presented in Fig. 2. Global mean thickness was significantly
lower in the overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group than in
the normal-weight type 2 diabetes group (z = −2.96, p for
group effect = 0.003; Fig. 2a), and there was no between-
group difference in the relationship between disease duration
and global mean thickness (z = 0.65, p for interaction = 0.52;
Fig. 2b). There was a significant interaction between disease
duration and weight status on global mean FA (z = 2.42, p for

 interaction = 0.02), where a gradual decrease in global mean
FA was found in the overweight/obese but not in the normal-
weight type 2 diabetes groups (Fig. 2d).
To ensure that the results were robust, repeated analyses were
performed using baseline data while excluding 1 year follow-up
data. The general linear model was applied to estimate the inter-
action effects between disease duration and weight status on
brain measures. The same covariates as those used in the original
linear mixed-effects model, except for within-individual random
effects, were included in the model. Similar results were obtain-
ed for these repeated analyses (ESM Results).
Brain region-specific interaction between disease duration
and weight status The overweight/obese type 2 diabetes
group had a thinner cortex in the temporal and motor ROIs
compared with the normal-weight type 2 diabetes group
(z = −4.36, p for group effect <0.001 and z = −2.91, p for
group effect = 0.004, respectively; Fig. 3a, c). Mean FAvalues
in the prefrontoparietal ROI were lower in the overweight/
obese type 2 diabetes group than in the normal-weight type
2 diabetes group (z = −2.06, p for group effect = 0.04;
Fig. 3b). The relationships between disease duration and
mean FA for the temporal and occipital ROIs in the
overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group differed from
those in the normal-weight type 2 diabetes group
(z = 2.22, p for interaction effect = 0.03 and z = −2.07,
p for interaction effect = 0.04, respectively; Fig. 3a, d).

 and psychomotor speed between the total type 2 diabetes
group and the normal-weight control group (z = −3.11, p for
group effect = 0.002 and z = −5.58, p for group effect <0.001,
respectively). Differences in executive function between the
total type 2 diabetes group and the normal-weight control
group were not statistically significant (z = −1.78, p for group
effect = 0.08).
Disease duration-related alterations in cognitive measures
in the overweight/obese and normal-weight type 2 diabetes
groups Cognitive measures, including memory, psychomotor
speed and executive function, for the two type 2 diabetes
subgroups are presented in Fig. 4. There was a significant
interaction effect of disease duration and weight status on
psychomotor speed performance (z = −2.12, p for interaction
= 0.03; Fig. 4d). A progressive decline in psychomotor speed
performance was found in the overweight/obese type 2 diabe-
tes group. There was no significant interaction effect on mem-
ory (z = −1.53, p for interaction = 0.13; Fig. 4b) or executive
function (z = −0.25, p for interaction = 0.80; Fig. 4f).
Relationships between insulin resistance and brain mea-
sures As HbA1c levels fluctuated in a U-shaped pattern, first
decreasing in the first 2 years after diagnosis and then gradu-
ally increasing, HOMA-IR may be a more accurate marker
than HbA1c levels for estimating brain and cognitive alter-
ations that occur in early stages of the disease. Therefore,
partial correlation analysis adjusting for age and sex was per-
formed for insulin resistance and brain measures in type 2
diabetic patients whose disease duration was <2 years (90 data
points). During the first 2 years after diagnosis, insulin resis-
tance (as measured by HOMA-IR) was negatively associated
with global mean thickness (rp = −0.24, p = 0.02) but not with
global mean FA (rp = 0.06, p = 0.58).
Discussion
In the current study, we report for the first time that cortical
thinning and disrupted white matter integrity are more pro-
nounced in early stage type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we found
that disease duration-related alterations in cortical thickness
and white matter integrity were more prominent in

 overweight/obese type 2 diabetic individuals than in those
with normal weight. A similar trend was also found in psy-
chomotor speed performance. These findings suggest that
weight status may play additive roles in type 2 diabetes-
related brain and cognitive alterations.
We selected grey and white matter ROIs in the tem-
poral, prefrontoparietal, motor and occipital regions that
showed type 2 diabetes-related alterations in cortical
thickness or white matter integrity. We explored whether
the concomitant presence of overweight or obesity in-
fluences grey and white matter of the brain in a region-
specific manner. Interestingly, region-specific interaction
effects were primarily observed in the temporal region,
indicating that the temporal lobe is vulnerable to the
combined effects of overweight/obesity and type 2 dia-
betes. An exploratory analysis also suggested that the
reduction in FA values in white matter tracts including
the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-
occipital fasciculus and cingulum, which are mainly lo-
cated in or pass through the temporal regions, were
more pronounced in overweight/obese compared with
normal-weight type 2 diabetic individuals.
Overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes independently in-
crease the risk of dementia [2, 28–30], and previous studies
have shown that temporal lobe atrophy is one of the earliest
neuroanatomical changes in Alzheimer’s dementia [18, 31].
Therefore, the temporal deficits specifically observed in the
overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group may represent

 neuroanatomical substrates underlying the links among over-
weight/obesity, type 2 diabetes and the risk of dementia.
As pronounced deficits in the brain and in cognitive func-
tions of people with type 2 diabetes may be potentiated by
obesity, these patients can be divided into distinct prognostic
subtypes according to their weight status [15, 16]. Our find-
ings also highlight the need for early intervention aimed to
reduce risk factors for overweight or obesity in type 2 diabetic
individuals to preserve their brain structure and cognitive
function. Furthermore, the contributory factors are unknown,
our findings suggest that insulin resistance without obesity has
distinct effects on the brain compared with conventional type
2 diabetes.
However, it is noteworthy that the current study did not
recruit overweight/obese individuals without type 2 diabetes.
Therefore, we could not determine the potential effects of
overweight/obesity that are completely independent of type
2 diabetes on metabolic, brain and cognitive measures.
Further studies using a more elaborate framework are recom-
mended to better describe the independent and combined
(additive, synergistic or interactive) effects of type 2 diabetes
and obesity/overweight on the brain. To achieve this, we sug-
gest using a balanced cohort comprising the following groups:
normal-weight control individuals, obese individuals without
type 2 diabetes, normal-weight type 2 diabetic patients and
obese type 2 diabetic patients.
Interestingly, HbA1c levels (reflecting symptom severity)
seem to decrease shortly after the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
Furthermore, preliminary correlation analyses revealed that in-
sulin resistance may be a significant determinant of cortical
atrophy in early stage type 2 diabetes. Although the underlying
mechanisms have not yet been clearly identified, impaired in-
sulin signalling and consequent effects on synaptic plasticity
may link insulin resistance and cortical atrophy [32]. Insulin
receptors are widely distributed in the brain and are highly
abundant in the hippocampus and specific cortical areas [33,
34]. Given that the current consensus recommendation for
treating type 2 diabetes aims to maintain near-normal blood
glucose and HbA1c levels, these findings suggest that it may
be more important to manage insulin resistance (the underlying
cause of the disease) during early stage type 2 diabetes than
previously thought.
Although the final model included 1 year follow-up data,
the current results may represent a cross-sectional estimation
of trajectories in relation to the disease duration, rather than
individual longitudinal changes. We used a linear mixed-
effect model that accounted for within-individual random ef-
fects by assuming that changes occurring during the disease
course are comparable among individuals [19]. This estima-
tion was corroborated by a repeated analysis including only
baseline data, which produced similar findings. Future longi-
tudinal studies are necessary to estimate the longitudinal tra-
jectory of brain measures in early stage type 2 diabetes.
The actual onset of type 2 diabetes often begins several years
before its clinical diagnosis [35]. Thus, longitudinal follow-up
of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance may be neces-
sary to confirm the effects of overweight/obesity on the brain in
individuals with type 2 diabetes. In this study, type 2 diabetic
participants had not experienced previous hypoglycaemic epi-
sodes, so the potential effects of hypoglycaemia could not be
determined [36].
Given that a series of studies suggest that glucose-lowering
medications may have effects on the brain [37], the current
findings should be interpreted with caution regarding the use
of glucose-lowering medications. Specifically, glucagon-like
peptide-1 receptor agonist, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors,
metformin and thiazolidinedione are known to have favourable
effects on the brain [37]. Further longitudinal studies using
larger cohorts are needed to discriminate and trace the potential
interaction between glucose-lowering medication use and
weight status on the brain in type 2 diabetic patients.
Our results suggest that a relationship exists between dis-
ease duration and metabolic measures in each diabetic group

 (classified according to BMI). However, as there was no in-
formation on fasting insulin and C-peptide levels in the
normal-weight control group, differences in metabolic mea-
sures between the type 2 diabetic and control groups could not
be determined in the present study.
The current WHO BMI cut-offs between overweight and
obesity do not differ according to ethnic origin [17]. In
Koreans, the overall risk of death was reported to be lowest
for individuals with a BMI of 23.0–24.9 kg/m2 [38]. However,
it is noteworthy that people of Asian ethnicity tend to be more
vulnerable to slight increases in BMI even within the over-
weight range and are at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes than
those of other ethnicities [39, 40]. Pre-existing functional def-
icits in beta cells, along with a tendency toward insulin resis-
tance even in lean individuals, may contribute to the specific
vulnerability of Asian people [17, 41]. Potential ethnic differ-
ences in brain vulnerability to type 2 diabetes and/or over-
weight/obesity may therefore need to be considered when
interpreting the results of these studies.
This study showed that the concurrent presence of
overweight/obesity was associated with cortical atrophy,
disrupted white matter integrity and cognitive dysfunction in
early stage type 2 diabetes. An increased awareness of
overweight/obesity-related risk is necessary to prevent and
manage type 2 diabetes-related brain atrophy and cognitive
dysfunction from early stage type 2 diabetes onward.
