 Measurements and Main Results—Patients assigned to video (n = 74) and direct (n = 76) 
laryngoscopy were similar at baseline. Despite better glottic visualization with video 
laryngoscopy, there was no difference in the primary outcome of intubation on the first 
laryngoscopy attempt (video 68.9% versus direct 65.8%, p = 0.68) in unadjusted analyses or after 
adjustment for the operator’s previous experience with the assigned device (odds ratio for video 
laryngoscopy on intubation on first attempt 2.02, 95% CI 0.82 – 5.02, p = 0.12). Secondary 
outcomes of time to intubation, lowest arterial oxygen saturation, complications, and in-hospital 
mortality were not different between video and direct laryngoscopy.
Conclusions—In critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation, video laryngoscopy 
improves glottic visualization but does not appear to increase procedural success or decrease 
complications.

Introduction
As many as one third of critically ill patients undergoing endotracheal intubation experience 
a life-threatening complication (1-4). Patient illness and instability, limited preparation time, 
operator inexperience, and equipment limitations all contribute to procedure-related 
complications (2-4). Few of these factors are modifiable; hence, efforts to improve the safety 
of endotracheal intubation have focused on modifiable factors such as medications (5-8), 
preparation (1), positioning (9-11), preoxygenation (12-14), and equipment to improve 
glottic visualization (15-19).
Video laryngoscopes use a camera on the distal end of the blade oriented toward the glottis 
to improve visualization. While it is logical that a better glottic view might translate into 
easier or more rapid endotracheal intubation, data are conflicting as to whether video 
laryngoscopy results in increased intubations on the first attempt, decreased complications, 
or improved clinical outcomes (16, 18, 20-22). Along with the need to train operators on 
multiple devices, these conflicting results have limited the use of video laryngoscopy for the 
intubation of critically ill patients (23).
To address this uncertainty, we conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing the 
effect of video versus direct laryngoscopy on the rate of intubation on first attempt among 
critically ill adults. We hypothesized that video laryngoscopy would increase the rate of 
intubation on first attempt, adjusting for the operator's previous experience with the 
intubating device at the time of intubation.
Methods
The FELLOW (Facilitating EndotracheaL intubation by Laryngoscopy technique and apneic 
Oxygenation Within the intensive care unit) Study was a prospective, randomized trial of 
video laryngoscopy (VL) compared with direct laryngoscopy (DL) during endotracheal

 intubation of critically ill adults by Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) fellows. 
The study was combined in a factorial design with a comparison of apneic oxygenation 
versus usual care, the results of which are reported separately (24). The protocol was 
approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board with a waiver of informed consent, 
the trial was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02051816), and the analysis plan was 
published online (https://starbrite.vanderbilt.edu/rocket/page/FELLOW) prior to completion 
of enrollment.
Study Patients
Between February 13, 2014 and February 11, 2015, all patients (≥ 18 years old) undergoing 
endotracheal intubation in the Vanderbilt University Medical Intensive Care Unit by a 
PCCM fellow were enrolled unless awake intubation was planned, intubation was required 
so emergently that a randomization envelope could not be obtained, or the treating clinicians 
felt a specific approach to intra-procedural oxygenation or a specific laryngoscopy device 
was mandated for the safe performance of the procedure (Figure 1).
Randomization and Blinding
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use of video or direct laryngoscopy on the 
first laryngoscopy attempt via random permuted blocks of 4, 8, and 12. Study assignment 
was concealed until after the decision had been made to intubate and the patient was 
enrolled in the trial. Because of the nature of the intervention, patients, clinicians, and study 
staff were aware of study group assignment after enrollment.
Study Interventions
Within the assigned laryngoscopy group, operators were free to select their preferred video 
laryngoscope (McGrath® Video Laryngoscope, GlideScope® Video Laryngoscope, or 
Olympus® Video Bronchoscope) or direct laryngoscope (curved MacIntosh or straight 
Miller blades). All other aspects of the procedure were at the discretion of the clinical team. 
All intubations were supervised by either a PCCM or Anesthesia attending physician who 
could offer feedback and guidance at any time during the procedure.
Data Collection
Study endpoints were collected by independent observers (ICU nurses or physicians trained 
in the definitions of each outcome) who were present in the patient’s room but not 
associated with the performance of the procedure. To confirm the accuracy of the data 
collected by the independent observers, the primary investigators concurrently assessed the 
same endpoints for a convenience sample of 10% of study intubations.
Measurement of Outcomes
The primary outcome was the rate of intubation on first attempt, adjusted for the operator’s 
previous experience with the intubating device at the time of the procedure. “Intubation on 
first attempt” was defined as successful placement of an endotracheal tube (Covidien™ 
Mallinckrodt™ Hi-Lo Oral/Nasal Tracheal Tube Cuffed) in the trachea during the first 
insertion of a laryngoscope into the oral cavity without removing the device from the mouth

 or using additional airway adjuncts. Adjustment for the operator’s previous device 
experience was performed by collecting the number of times the operator had previously 
used a video or direct laryngoscope at the time of each intubation event during the trial, such 
that the adjustment for prior experience with a specific device was updated constantly as the 
trial progressed. Suction devices and endotracheal tube stylets (Mallinckrodt™ Satin-Slip 14 
french intubating stylet) were used routinely and not considered airway adjuncts. Secondary 
outcomes included time from induction to intubation, lowest arterial oxygen saturation 
(SpO2) measured between medication administration and 2 minutes after endotracheal tube 
placement, intubation on first attempt adjusted for patient age, severity of illness, body mass 
index, and operator device experience, the need for additional devices or operators, 
Cormack-Lehane grading of the glottic view (25), procedure-related complications, and in-
hospital mortality.
Statistical Analysis
A prior study of endotracheal intubation by PCCM fellows in a similar population reported a 
rate of intubation on first attempt of 68% with DL and an improvement of 23% with use of 
VL (26). To have 90% statistical power to detect a difference in rate of intubation on the first 
attempt of 23% between VL and DL with a type I error rate of 0.05, we calculated a sample 
size of 142 patients. We planned to enroll a total of 150 patients to anticipating a small 
number of cases in which the primary endpoint would be unavailable.
Data are expressed as median and interquartile range for continuous variables and 
frequencies for categorical variables. Between-group comparisons were conducted using the 
Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical 
variables. Logistic regression models were created to analyze the effect of VL on intubation 
on first laryngosocpy attempt while adjusting for (1) previous experience with the device at 
the time of the procedure and (2) previous experience with the device plus pre-specified 
baseline confounders. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22.0, Chicago, IL) was used for 
statistical analyses; a two-sided significance level of 0.05 was used for statistical inference.
Results
Of 196 critically ill adults intubated by PCCM fellows during the study period, 150 were 
enrolled and randomized to video or direct laryngoscopy (Figure 1). There was no crossover 
between study arms.
Baseline and Procedural Characteristics
Patients randomized to VL (n = 74) and DL (n = 76) were similar at baseline (Table 1). 
Sixteen PCCM fellows each performed a mean of 9.4 (SD ± 6.4) intubations as a part of the 
trial. Fellows’ prior total intubating experience and duration of training was similar between 
the VL and DL groups (Table 1). As anticipated, fellows had fewer prior intubations with 
VL (median 10, IQR 5 – 22) compared with DL (47, IQR 35 – 58) at the time of each 
procedure.
Post-randomization procedural characteristics including pre-oxygenation strategy, sedative 
medications, and laryngoscope blade size used were similar between groups (eTable 1).

 Only 2 patients in the VL arm and 3 patients in the DL arm were intubated without 
neuromuscular blockade. In the VL group, operators chose the McGrath® MAC (98.6%) and 
GlideScope® (1.4%) video laryngoscopes for the first intubation attempt. In the DL group, 
97.4% of first intubation attempts were performed with a curved blade.
Primary Outcome
There was no difference in the rate of intubation on first attempt between video (68.9%) and 
direct (65.8%) laryngoscopy (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of intubation on first attempt with 
VL 1.15, 95% CI 0.58 – 2.28, p = 0.68). Results were similar in analyses adjusting for 
operator experience with the assigned device at the time of intubation (adjusted OR 2.02, 
95% CI 0.82 – 5.02, p = 0.12) and operator experience with the assigned device, APACHE II 
score, and BMI (OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.81 – 5.02, p = 0.12).
When intubation on the first attempt did not occur (23 of 74 patients in the VL group and 26 
of 76 patients in the DL group), addition of only an endotracheal tube introducer (SunMed 
Introducer Adult Bougie with Coude tip, 15 french x 70 cm) allowed intubation for 7 (30%) 
of the failed VL patients compared with 4 (15%, p = 0.3) of the failed DL patients (eFigure 
1). Of the 22 DL patients who required a second laryngoscopy attempt, half were intubated 
with VL and half with DL as opposed to the 16 VL patients requiring a second attempt, 14 
of whom were intubated with VL and only 2 with DL.
Secondary Outcomes
Despite significantly improving the Cormack-Lehane grade of glottic view (Figure 2), VL 
did not decrease time to intubation (126 seconds, IQR 89 – 197) compared with DL (153 
seconds, IQR 93 – 253, p = 0.13) overall or in patients requiring only one attempt (105 
seconds, IQR 75 – 150 versus 112 seconds, IQR 86 – 156, p = 0.45) (Table 2). There was no 
difference between VL and DL in lowest arterial oxygen saturation (91%, IQR 82 – 98% 
versus 90%, IQR 82 – 97%, p = 0.75) or decrease in SpO2 from baseline (4%, IQR 14 - 1% 
versus 4%, IQR 11 - 0%, p = 0.39). In-hospital mortality (VL 41.9% versus DL 42.1%, p = 
1) and procedure-related complications (aspiration, esophageal intubation, new hypoxia, 
new hypotension, cardiac arrest, airway trauma) were similar between groups (Table 2). 
There were no differences in duration of mechanical ventilation (VL 3 days, IQR 1 - 11 
versus DL 3 days, IQR 1 -8, p = 0.69) or intensive care unit length of stay (VL 6 days, IQR 2 
- 11 versus DL 4 days, IQR 3 – 9, p = 0.41). In a 10% convenience sample, intubation on 
first attempt recorded concurrently by the independent observer and the primary 
investigators showed perfect interrater agreement (κ = 1.0, p = 0.001).
Subgroup Analyses
There was no significant increase in the odds of intubation on first attempt with VL in any of 
the pre-specified subgroups (Figure 3). The presence or absence of apneic oxygenation (24) 
did not modify the effect of video laryngoscopy on intubation on first attempt (p-value for 
interaction = 0.77). An additional post hoc subgroup analysis suggested that operators’ total 
prior intubating experience might modify the effect of VL on intubation on first attempt 
(eFigure2). Operators with less than 50 total prior intubations had higher odds of intubation 
on first attempt with VL compared with more experienced operators (≥ 50 total prior

 intubations) who had no increased odds of intubation on first attempt with VL (p-value for 
interaction = 0.031). Given potential confounding between total intubating experience and 
experience with a given laryngoscopy device, we fit a multivariable logistic regression 
model adjusting for prior experience with the assigned device and found there was no longer 
a statistically significant interaction between previous total intubation experience and VL for 
the outcome of intubation on first attempt (p-value for interaction = 0.17) (eFigure 2).
Discussion
This randomized trial comparing video and direct laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation 
of critically ill adults by PCCM fellows did not demonstrate an increase in intubation on first 
attempt with video laryngoscopy. The lack of effect persisted after adjustment for the 
operator’s previous experience with the intubating device and across all pre-specified 
subgroups.
The results of the current trial are in contrast with results of prior studies demonstrating 
improved procedural success with VL (15, 18, 26). There are several potential explanations 
for this difference. Prior studies limited to non-critically ill populations (17) may not apply 
to the patient, operator, and procedural conditions surrounding intubation in the ICU. Un-
blinded observational study designs (3, 18, 27, 28), non-random patient assignments (15), 
and “before-after” quality improvement studies (26) may suffer from confounding by 
selection bias, changes in practice over time, and the observer bias associated with self-
reported data. Observer bias is of particular concern in studies reporting unexpectedly high 
rates of intubation failures with direct laryngoscopy compared with video laryngoscopy (15, 
18, 21, 26). A lack of accounting of the experience of the operator at the time of the 
procedure (15, 16, 18, 26, 28) may also confound the results of prior work. Neuromuscular 
blockade, which is associated with improved glottic view and reduced intubation attempts 
with DL (8, 29, 30), was used in 96% of intubations in the current trial but less frequently 
(18, 26, 28) or not at all (15) in past studies.
More specific to the patient population of interest, the findings in the current trial are also in 
conflict with those of the only prior controlled trial of VL versus DL in the ICU (15); 
however both results may be true. Operator view is improved when neuromuscular blockade 
is used for intubation (8, 29) and use of neuromuscular blockade in 96% of patients in the 
current trial compared with 0% in the prior trial may explain the higher rate of success with 
DL in the current trial (66% versus 40%, respectively). Alternatively, the near-exclusive use 
of the McGrath® MAC video laryngoscope in the current trial compared to the GlideScope® 
video laryngoscope used in the prior trial might contribute to the difference in findings; 
however, these two video laryngoscopes performed similarly in both trials regarding rates of 
grade I or II glottic view (greater than 90%) and intubation on first attempt (around 70%) in 
the VL arm of each trial.
Because uncertainty regarding the role of routine VL use in ICU intubations persisted 
despite previous studies, we incorporated three design features into our trial to more 
definitively test this key question. Study group assignments were concealed until after 
enrollment and randomization had occurred. Randomization using variable-sized permuted

 blocks prevented operator or study personnel from knowing which device would be assigned 
next. Observer bias was minimized by employing trained, independent data collectors 
uninvolved in the procedure, and validating the quality of their data collection by concurrent 
collection of the same data by study personnel. We also deliberately used a relatively 
homogenous operator population (PCCM fellows) but nonetheless anticipated that operator 
experience would not remain balanced over the course of the study and adjusted for 
continuously updated imbalances in operator device experience at the time when the 
procedure was performed.
There are a number of possible reasons why improving glottic view with VL does not 
translate into procedural success. Our study suggests that despite obtaining a better view of 
the glottis, there may be more difficulty inserting an endotracheal tube with VL as evidenced 
by the higher use of endotracheal tube introducers in the VL group. Additionally, as a result 
of accounting for the operator’s previous experience, our data contain the intriguing 
suggestion that improving glottic view with VL may only matter to less experienced 
operators (Figure 3, eFigure 2). However, this was a post hoc analysis which was not 
significant after rigorously accounting for experience with each device and should only be 
considered hypothesis-generating. Finally, the effect of video laryngoscopy on intubation on 
first attempt was not modified by the apneic oxygenation half of the factorial design as the 
p-value for interaction was 0.77 and apneic oxygenation did not increase the lowest arterial 
oxygen saturation compared to usual care (24).
The current trial has some limitations. First, exclusions of intubations where the operator 
believed the patient needed a specific laryngoscopy device for the safe performance of the 
procedure was necessary for safety reasons but may limit the extrapolation of these results to 
all critically ill patients and data were not collected as to how operators came to this 
decision. The rate of intubation on first attempt with VL and DL in these excluded patients 
was not collected. Although the proportion of eligible patients excluded by physician 
preference criteria (9%) was similar to prior interventional critical care trials (31-33), it 
means our study findings apply only to the 90% of ICU intubations for which there is not an 
a priori indication for use of a specific laryngoscopy device. Specifically, our results cannot 
inform how VL and DL would compare among patients anticipated to have difficult upper 
airway anatomy or other potential indications for VL. Second, although a clear definition of 
the primary outcome and trained, independent observers collecting the data mitigates 
observer bias, intubation on first attempt is not directly linked to patient-centered clinical 
outcomes. However, patient-centered clinical outcomes were collected and we found no 
difference between study groups. Third, although operators were allowed to choose the 
specific VL and DL devices, this was largely a trial of the McGrath® MAC video 
laryngoscope and curved intubating blades. Therefore, these data may not be generalizable 
to operators using video laryngoscopes other than the McGrath® MAC and direct 
laryngoscopes with straight blades. Additionally, once patients were randomized to VL or 
DL, patients in the VL group were more likely to receive rocuronium rather than 
succinylcholine for neuromuscular blockade (eTable 1), which may influence measures of 
procedural success. However, in a subgroup analysis (Figure 3) there was no significant 
effect modification of the paralytic medication chosen on intubation on first attempt. Finally,

 although designed with 90% statistical power to detect a difference between arms of 23% 
based on a past study of PCCM fellows performing endotracheal intubation (26), our trial 
was not powered to detect small differences between arms.
Where do these results leave the question of routine VL use for trainees performing 
endotracheal intubation outside of the operating room? Despite a wealth of observational 
data promoting VL for the intubation of critically ill adults (16-18, 26, 28), the two largest 
randomized trials including 623 critically ill adults with trauma (20) and the current trial of 
150 critically ill adults in the MICU have not shown benefit. Considering the results of large 
randomized trials and importance of exposure to various techniques during training (23), 
exclusive use of VL in out-of-OR airway management appears premature. Future studies 
should employ rigorous trial designs with true randomization, objectively collected data, and 
careful accounting of patient, operator, and device characteristics to definitively determine 
the circumstances under which VL should be the first line for airway management in the 
critically ill patient.
Conclusions
Among critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation by PCCM fellows, video 
laryngoscopy does not improve the rate of intubation on first attempt. These results do not 
support the routine use of video laryngoscopy for all ICU intubations. Future study should 
focus on whether video laryngoscopy improves the rate of intubation on first attempt in 
operators with limited intubating experience.

 Figure 3. Subgroup Analyses and Evaluation for Effect Modification
Subgroup analyses were conducted by patient, procedure, and operator-specific variables. 
Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the outcome of intubation on first attempt 
using video laryngoscopy are displayed for the overall study at the top of the figure followed 
by all subgroups. * Adjusted Device Experience represents the primary outcome for 
reference. The right justified columns are P-values for interaction terms entered into the 
logistic regression model to test for effect modification of any of the subgroup variables. 
There were no patient- or procedure-specific subgroups that benefitted from intubation with 
video laryngoscopy nor were there any statistically significant interactions detected. 
Regarding the operator specific variables of previous experience with the assigned intubating 
device, previous total intubating experience, and previous fellowship training experience, 
operators less experienced with the assigned device (< 30 previous uses of the device, 
median) and the intubation procedure (< 50 total intubations, lowest quartile of experience) 
had a higher odds of intubation on first attempt with video laryngoscopy. However, only 
previous total intubating experience (< 50 total intubations) modified the effect of video 
laryngoscopy on intubation on first attempt (p = 0.031).
