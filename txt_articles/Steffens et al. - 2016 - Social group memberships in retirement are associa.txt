ABSTRACT
Objectives: Retirement constitutes a major life
transition that poses significant challenges to health,
with many retirees experiencing a precipitous decline
in health status following retirement. We examine the
extent to which membership in social groups
following retirement determines quality of life and
mortality.
Design: The longitudinal impact of the number of
social group memberships before and after the
transition to retirement was assessed on retirees’
quality of life and risk of death 6 years later.
Setting: Nationally representative cohort study of
older adults living in England.
Participants: Adults who underwent the transition to
retirement (N=424). A matched control group
(N=424) of participants who had comparable
demographic and health characteristics at baseline
but did not undergo the transition to retirement were
also examined.
Outcome measures: Analyses examined
participants’ quality of life and mortality during a
period of 6 years.
Results: Retirees who had two group memberships
prior to retirement had a 2% risk of death in the first
6 years of retirement if they maintained membership in
two groups, a 5% risk if they lost one group and a
12% risk if they lost both groups. Furthermore, for
every group membership that participants lost in the
year following retirement, their experienced quality of
life 6 years later was approximately 10% lower. These
relationships are robust when controlling for key
sociodemographic variables (age, gender, relationship
status and socioeconomic status prior to retirement).
A comparison with a matched control group confirmed
that these effects were specific to those undergoing the
transition to retirement. The effect of social group
memberships on mortality was comparable to that of
physical exercise.
Conclusions: Theoretical implications for our
understanding of the determinants of retiree quality of
life and health, and practical implications for the
support of people transitioning from a life of work to
retirement are discussed.
INTRODUCTION
Retiring from work constitutes a major life
transition that most people experience at
some point in the course of their life, posing
significant challenges to health and well-
being.
Indeed,
large-scale
longitudinal
studies indicate that around 25% of retirees
in the USA1 and around 10% of retirees in
Germany2 experience a significant drop in
health and well-being in the retirement tran-
sition. These figures point to the fact that
retirement has significant costs for indivi-
duals and for society at large.
At the same time, however, such studies
reveal significant variation in retirees’ experi-
ences and health decline is not universal.
Some
retirees

improved health. This suggests that, beyond
leaving one’s job, there are a range of factors
that determine whether retirees adjust well
or poorly to this transition. In this regard, a
growing literature points to the fact that
social factors have a profound impact on
people’s health. For instance, meta-analytic
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first study to examine the protective
benefits of social group memberships for quality
of life and health in retirement.
▪ Use of data from a nationally representative
sample and longitudinal analysis to follow parti-
cipants over the transition to retirement.
▪ Use of reliable measures of (subjective) quality
of life and (objective) mortality.
▪ Comparison of social group memberships rela-
tive to physical exercise in terms of their protect-
ive benefit for health.
▪ The main limitation was that the measure of
social group memberships was not exhaustive.

 evidence3 shows that people’s social relationships with
others is a significant predictor of their longevity and in
fact a stronger predictor than other health behaviours
such as physical exercise, smoking or alcohol consump-
tion. Similarly, longitudinal evidence indicates that social
engagement (or the lack of social isolation) is predictive
of several key aspects of health,4–7 being associated with
reduced depression8 and enhanced cognitive health.9
Clearly, social connectedness has significant implications
for health. So, how and why might social connectedness
be relevant for retirees?
In the present paper we argue that part of the vari-
ance in health and quality of life of retirees can be
explained by the implications that retirement has for
people’s social group memberships—and their social
identities or the sense of self that is derived from mem-
bership in one or more social groups.10–12 In more
formal terms, we define a social group as a group of
any form that a person is a member of and that he or
she sees as an important part of their identity. For
example, these groups can be leisure groups (eg, a
book club), family, friendship or community groups
(eg, a church group), sporting groups (eg, a tennis
club), work groups (eg, a sales team), professional
groups (eg, a trade union) or any other groups that a
person sees as an important part of who they are.
More specifically, we argue that retirement has an
important bearing on health and quality of life because
it typically involves relinquishing social group member-
ships (eg, as a member of a particular professional
group, a particular organisation, a particular work-
team) that have been a key focus for people’s self-
definition for years or decades. At the same time too,
it can also provide opportunities to develop new group
memberships,
and
hence
for
particular
forms
of
socially engaged life. In line with previous work that
has pointed to important links between group member-
ship and health,13–15 our general argument is that the
consequences of retirement for health and quality of
life will depend in part on its implications for the con-
stellation of group memberships that define an indivi-
dual’s sense of self.
The process of adjusting to retirement
Retirement is conceptualised as a developmental process
requiring adjustment that spans not only the transition
from employment to retirement but also longer-term
development post-retirement.16 Moreover, one’s health
and quality of life following the transition to retirement
prove to be important indicators of successful retire-
ment.17 However, there is significant variability in retir-
ees’ health and quality of life, in part because the
process of adjustment is shaped by an array of factors
including the extent to which an individual participates
in (1) financial planning and decision-making in the
lead-up to leaving work,18–20 (2) bridge or volunteer
work,21
22 (3) leisure activities23
24 and (4) physical
activity.25 26
Moreover, and speaking to the aims of the present
research, post-retirement adjustment is also dependent
on a person’s (5) ongoing social relationships that
include family structures and wider social contacts.27 28
Such findings are also consistent with the literature
showing that social factors have a significant influence
on both psychological and general health.3–7 29–31
The role of social group memberships in adjustment to
retirement
Speaking to the importance of living a socially fulfilled
life, an emerging body of research demonstrates the key
role that social group memberships play in protecting
health and well-being. People derive a sense of who they
are from social groups (ie, their social identity), provid-
ing them with a sense of purpose, meaning, agency and
belonging. Given their centrality to a person’s sense of
self, it is not surprising that when they are compromised
this constitutes a major threat to psychological and
social functioning.13 14 32 In line with this point, there is
evidence that the number of groups that a person is a
member of is a unique predictor of self-esteem,33 resili-
ence34 and mental health.35–37
A growing body of research also supports claims that
group-based interactions have a distinctive role to play in
health and well-being over and above social interaction
and social contact per se.15 38 39 Indeed, belonging to a
greater number of social groups has been shown to be
particularly protective of health when people undergo
stressful life transitions such as becoming a university
student,40 recovering from a stroke41 or coming to terms
with a brain injury.42
Building on this body of research, we hypothesise that
social group memberships will have an important role to
play in adjustment to retirement. This is because transi-
tioning to retirement is characterised by social losses
associated with giving up work-related group member-
ships and associated identities.43 Speaking to this possi-
bility, the present research is the first to examine the
contribution that social group memberships—both old
and new—make to post-retirement adjustment. In line
with previous research, our core prediction is that once
people have stopped work and are in the process of
adapting to their new life circumstances, access to more
group memberships will be a significant and unique pre-
dictor of successful adjustment. In this regard, the Social
Identity Model of Identity Change (SIMIC)44 suggests
that group memberships can offer protection against
the stress-producing health consequences of life change.
Moreover, it asserts that they do this in two ways;
through (1) a continuity pathway involving the mainten-
ance of old group memberships following the change
and (2) a gain pathway involving the acquisition of new
group memberships following the change.
While continuity of group memberships following
retirement and gaining new group memberships follow-
ing retirement might be equally effective in protecting
retirees’ health and quality of life, the maintenance

 pathway is likely to be less common among retirees.
Whereas some may experience continuity of work-
related identities through gradual transition to retire-
ment, voluntary work or other means, this is not the
case for everyone. Accordingly, for those who fully retire,
the gain pathway of joining new groups following the
transition might be particularly important because it can
counter the experience of loss where work-related iden-
tities had been valued.
Overview of present research
In the present research, we examine the relationship
between the number of social group memberships and
adjustment to retirement through analysis of data from
the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). This
allows us to test the contribution that social group mem-
berships make to retirement adjustment as indexed by
(subjective) quality of life and (objective) mortality in a
large longitudinal sample. Based on the above reasoning,
we expect that continuity of pre-retirement social group
memberships will be less important than gain of new
group memberships in protecting the quality of life and
health of people who are transitioning to retirement. We
test this prediction through comparison with a compar-
ably matched control group (who are either still working
or have already transitioned to retirement) for whom
continuity would be likely to be achieved and important
for quality of life and health. Moreover, we also compare
the strength of the effect of social group memberships
on health to that of physical exercise. Stated more for-
mally, we propose the following hypotheses:
H1. The number of social groups that retirees report
being members of following retirement will predict their
(a) quality of life, and (b) mortality. Social group mem-
berships will predict health even after controlling for key
sociodemographic variables (age, gender, relationship
status and socioeconomic status).
H2a. Among retirees, the number of social groups post-
retirement (at time 2; after the transition) will be more
important in predicting quality of life and mortality than
the number of social groups pre-retirement (at time 1).
H2b. Among a matched control group, who have not
undergone an identity transition between Time 1 and
Time 2 (because they are still working or have retired
prior to the time period of the study), the initial
number of groups (at Time 1 rather than at Time 2) will
be a predictor of quality of life and mortality.
METHOD
Participants and design
Retiree sample
Participants were 424 respondents of the ELSA who
retired between wave 1 (W1) and wave 2 (W2) and had
sufficient data available on the variables of interest. The
ELSA sample was drawn from households previously
responding to the Health Survey for England, with all
respondents born before March 1952. The English
Longitudinal Study of Ageing started in 2002–2003, con-
stituting W1, with respondents invited to participate
every 2 years. The most recent release of mortality data
is wave 5 (W5), collected in 2010–2011. While wave 6
(W6) was available at the time of the present analysis,
mortality data for W6 was not available and so W5 was
the most complete wave available for our purposes. All
participants were aged 50 years or more and were resid-
ing in England when surveyed.
Matched control group
To provide evidence that findings uniquely relate to the
transition to retirement (rather than being a more
general phenomenon unrelated to this transition) we
identified a matched control group of 424 respondents
who were highly similar to retirees on demographic vari-
ables, but who were not currently transitioning to retire-
ment. Therefore, in the matched control group any
change in group membership between waves 1 and 2
did not relate to transition to retirement. Using the
‘fuzzy’ SPSS extension, for each participant in the
retiree sample we identified a matched control from the
ELSA data set. Specifically, to account for sample vari-
ation while ensuring that this procedure generated a
comparable sample (of identical size), we specified that
cases in the matched control group were allowed to vary
on the following continuous variables: age by no more
than 2 years, and subjective physical health, number of
groups and quality of life by no more than one point on
the scale, while matching cases as far as possible on the
categorical variables gender, ethnicity, relationship status
and socioeconomic status. Subjective physical health,
number of groups and quality of life (all at W1) were
also matched, while allowing scores to differ by 1 on
these
variables.
The
demographics
of
retirees
and
matched controls are presented in table 1 and these
indicate that the two groups did not differ statistically at
W1 on any variables other than work status. The avail-
able sample size for mortality is larger than that for
quality of life because for some participants who did not
take part in a follow-up wave, the ELSA draws on other
sources to gather mortality data. We refrained from
using survey weights to deal with attrition. It is note-
worthy that attrition was comparable in the target and
matched control group.
Measures
Social group memberships
Following the logic of previous research,36 38 respon-
dents’ number of group memberships was determined
from their response to the question: “Are you a member
of any of the following organizations, clubs or societies?”
Respondents could tick any or all of eight response
options (eg, ‘social clubs’; ‘church or other religious
groups’). Respondents could also tick a final box: “No I
am not a member of any organizations, clubs or soci-
eties.” Responses were summed to create a continuous
scale ranging from 0 to 8.

 Dependent variables
Two reliable measures were used: quality of life (subject-
ive) and mortality (objective). In both cases, we were
interested in predicting long-term adjustment outcomes
and so examined respondents’ life quality and mortality
in the most recent wave of available data (W5). For each
analysis, we aimed to predict retirees’ quality of life and
mortality 6 years post-retirement from their group mem-
berships in the wave following their retirement (W2)
while controlling for both indices immediately prior to
retirement (W1).
Quality of life
Participants responded to the 5-item Satisfaction With
Life Scale assessing quality of life (eg, “In most ways, my
life is more or less ideal”).45–48 At W1, only the single
item assessing quality of life was available in the data set
(“I feel satisfied with the way my life has turned out”)
and we controlled for this W1 measure in the quality of
life analyses. Items were scored on a 7-point scale that
was recoded as a summary score from 1 ‘strongly dis-
agree’ to 7 ‘strongly agree’.
Mortality
For those participants who could not be contacted to
complete the survey at W3, W4 or W5, ELSA draws on
mortality records from the Office of National Statistics to
determine whether participants were deceased. For the
purposes of our analysis, this variable was coded as 0
‘not deceased’ or 1 ‘deceased’.
Covariates
Five covariates were included in the analyses. These were
age (top-coded at 90 years), gender, relationship status
(married, de-facto or neither), and socioeconomic status
(based on decile of annual reported income). In add-
ition,
we
controlled
for
dependent
variables
pre-
retirement (W1). For the analysis of quality of life, W1
data for this variable was included as a covariate. For the
analysis
of
mortality,
W1
subjective
physical
health
(“How often does your health stop you from doing what
you want to do?” rated on a 5-point scale ranging from
‘never’ to ‘often’) was included as a covariate given that
it is (obviously) not possible to control for prior levels of
mortality. By controlling for initial quality of life and
health, we reduced the likelihood that the results could
be accounted for by pre-existing differences in outcome
variables between those with many group memberships
and those without.
Procedure and statistical analysis
ELSA data collection consists of two separate modules:
an
interview,
conducted
in-person
using
computer-
assisted interviewing and a questionnaire which partici-
pants complete independently. The more sensitive and/
or
subjective
questions,
including
those
measuring
group memberships and quality of life, were part of the
self-completed questionnaire.
To analyse the results, we used hierarchical regression
in which control variables were entered in step 1, while
W1 group memberships were added in step 2, and W2
group memberships in step 3. We used linear regression
to assess the continuous variable quality of life and
binary logistic regression to assess the categorical vari-
able mortality.
RESULTS
Main analyses
Quality of life
Hierarchical regression was used to model quality of life
at W5, with results presented in table 2. Initial quality of
life prior to retirement was the only significant covariate,
such that respondents who experienced high quality of
life at W1 were also more likely to have higher quality
of life 8 years later. Consistent with H1a, the number of
groups
that
respondents
reported
being
members
of following retirement (at W2) was also a significant
predictor. Supporting H2a, group memberships only had

predictive
power
when
this
was
a
post-transition measure (at W2 but not at W1; ie, for tran-
sitioning retirees only). Indeed, for every group member-
ship that participants lost following retirement, their
quality of life 6 years later was approximately 10% lower.
In
contrast,
among
the
matched
control
group,
change in group memberships in this period did not sig-
nificantly affect quality of life. Instead, H2b was con-
firmed for quality of life, as among respondents who did
not undergo the transition to retirement only the
number of their initial group memberships (ie, at W1
but not at W2) had additional predictive power. For
every group membership a participant had at W1, their
quality of life was approximately 9% higher 8 years later.
Mortality
Twenty-eight (6.6%) of the retiree sample died in the
first 6 years of their retirement. We used stepwise binary
logistic regression to model the likelihood of death
based on our demographic, health and social variables
of interest. As can be seen in table 3, the strongest pre-
dictor of death was age, such that someone aged 55 at
retirement had a 1% chance of dying in the following
6 years, while someone aged 65 at retirement had an 8%
chance of dying in the following 6 years. It is noteworthy
too, that while subjective physical health was a significant
predictor of mortality on its own (when one does not
control for any other variable), χ2(1)=4.74, p=0.030, Exp
(b)=0.779, as presented in table 3, it was not a significant
predictor when the variables of the present analyses are
also included as predictors.
However, consistent with H1b, the only other significant
predictor of death in the model was number of group
memberships
following
retirement.
Supporting
H2a,
group memberships only had additional predictive power
when this was a post-transition measure (at W2; ie, for
transitioning retirees only). For purposes of illustration, if
participants had two group memberships prior to retire-
ment, their risk of death over the first 6 years of retire-
ment was 2% if they maintained membership in two
groups, but was 5% if they lost one group, and 12% if they
lost both groups. These results are presented in figure 1.
In contrast, among the matched control group who
did not retire between W1 and W2, change in group
memberships in this period was not a significant pre-
dictor of risk of death. Instead, supporting H2b, their

 number of initial group memberships (W1) was the only
predictor. A respondent with no groups at W1 had
approximately 10% chance of dying over the following
8 years, while for a respondent with two groups at W1
the risk was only 2%.
Additional analyses
Socioeconomic status can also be assessed by variables
other than income. To examine whether other indica-
tors of socioeconomic status affected the present rela-
tionships, we ran additional sensitivity analyses in which
we controlled for wealth and education. Results of a
regression analysis predicting quality of life indicated
that retirees’ wealth decile (b=−0.058, p=0.033) and edu-
cation level (b=−0.057, p=0.085) contributed to the pre-
diction of quality of life at W5. To further explore this,
we ran analyses including wealth decile and education as
additional covariates in our original model of retiree
quality of life. When these two variables were added as
additional covariates, neither emerged as a significant
predictor of quality of life over and above the other cov-
ariates (education level was marginally significant; b=
−0.057, p=0.079) and the results were substantively
identical.
Similarly, results of a logistic regression predicting
retirees’ mortality confirmed that W1 wealth decile
(b=0.12, p=0.088, Wald’s F=2.92) and W1 education level
(b=0.22, p=0.025, Wald’s F=5.03) contributed to the pre-
diction of mortality. When added as additional predic-
tors, neither was a significant predictor of mortality over
and above other covariates (education level was margin-
ally significant; b=0.19, p=0.066), and the results were
substantively identical.
Another variable that is often seen to be critical for
retirees’ objective health is physical activity.49–53 For
comparison purposes, we ran a regression that assessed
whether change in physical activity across the same time
period (controlling for initial physical activity) affected
mortality and compared the magnitude of this effect to
the effect of group membership change. Change in phys-
ical activity significantly predicted risk of mortality for
retirees (Nagelkereke R2 change=0.032, p=0.029; OR
1.62) and marginally predicted mortality for matched
controls (Nagelkereke R2 change=0.025, p=0.066; OR
1.54). In physical health terms, if a person exercised vig-
orously once per week before retiring and maintained
this frequency post-retirement, they had a 3% chance of
dying in the next 6 years, a 6% chance if they decreased
this frequency to less than weekly and an 11% chance if
they stopped exercising vigorously altogether. Among
matched controls across the same time period, a person
who maintained weekly vigorous exercise had a 3%
chance of dying in the next 6 years, a 5% chance if they
reduced this frequency to less than weekly and an 8%
chance if they stopped exercising vigorously altogether.
Accordingly, we can see that the effects of physical activ-
ity on health were comparable to those associated with
maintaining old group memberships and developing
new ones.
DISCUSSION
The present research aimed to examine the extent to
which social group memberships contribute to retire-
ment adjustment. Supporting H1, findings indicated
that retirees who had more social group memberships
following their transition to retirement had better (1)
quality of life and (2) objective health (in terms of
reduced likelihood of dying). Supporting H2a, results
showed that greater quality of life and reduced mortality
were predicted, in particular, by group memberships
post-retirement
(and not pre-retirement). Consistent
with H2b, the opposite was the case for a matched non-
retirement sample in which initial group memberships
had particular predictive power. This pattern suggests
that group memberships have a distinct role to play in
the process of adapting to new circumstances following
retirement; effects that are comparable in size to those
of physical activity.
These findings have a number of important implica-
tions for retirement research and practice. Adjustment
to retirement has been conceptualised as a developmen-
tal process,17 leading to calls for longitudinal studies
that track people’s transition to retirement as well as
their longer term development. Indeed, gaining a better
understanding of the ways in which this transition
unfolds is important given that people differ markedly
from each other in their experience of adjustment fol-
lowing retirement.1 2 In this regard, the novel insight
provided by the present research is that the number of
group memberships post-retirement is an important
source
of
variation
in
retirees’
life
trajectories.

 protective effects of social group memberships,35 42 the
present research suggests that retirement can also be
usefully
conceptualised
as
an
identity
change
process13 40 54 and that the loss of a workplace group
membership associated with retirement is less likely to
compromise health and quality of life to the extent that
retirees are able to maintain other group memberships
and join new groups once retired.
Two further features of our findings are noteworthy.
First, even though subjective and objective indicators of
health and well-being can differ at times (and some
behaviours may impact only one or the other),55 social
group memberships appear to have a generalised rela-
tionship to experienced life quality and health as evi-
denced by the fact that they contribute to two quite
distinct indicators: quality of life56–58 and mortality.
Second, it is apparent that the number of social group
memberships predicted subsequent quality of life and
health in retirees even after controlling for initial quality
of life and health as well as sociodemographic covariates
known to be potential reliable predictors: age, gender,
relationship status and socioeconomic status.59
Speaking further to the importance of social group
memberships as a predictor of both quality of life and
mortality, it is notable that the present effects were com-
parable in size to those associated with physical activity
—a behaviour widely recognised as enhancing objective
health in retirees and older adults more generally.49
Interesting too is the fact that these findings are consist-
ent with the growing body of work demonstrating the
need for interventions that seek to promote people’s
adjustment to life transitions by focusing on the manage-
ment of their group memberships.25 60 61 The particular
contribution of the present paper in this regard is to
further enhance theory in showing that the group mem-
bership gain pathway to health and quality of life may be
more important than the group membership mainten-
ance pathway particularly where there are challenges to
group membership continuity—as there are in the tran-
sition to retirement.
These findings also have unique practical implications
for retirement planning. First, they suggest that as much
as practitioners may help retirees adjust by providing
support with financial planning, they may also help by
providing social planning. In this regard, practical inter-
ventions should focus on helping retirees to maintain
their sense of purpose and belonging by assisting them
to connect to groups and communities that are mean-
ingful to who they are. More specifically, interventions
that focus on facilitating the development of new group
memberships
post-retirement
may
be
particularly
important in sustaining retirees’ long-term adjustment.
Limitations and future research
Although our results provide support for the hypothe-
sised
relationships tested,
we
need
to
recognise
a
number of limitations. First, our analysis relied on the
best indicator of the number of group memberships
available in the ELSA data set. This required people to
indicate their group memberships from a large, but pre-
selected list of groups. Clearly it would have been more
desirable to have an index of the number of social
group memberships that allowed people to self-generate
the groups they belonged to in addition to an indicator
of the importance of each group for their sense of self
(eg, as in a self-generated group listing task).41 Had it
been possible to include such a measure—and for our
analysis as a whole to thus be more nuanced—we think
it is highly likely that our analysis would have been able
to capture additional variance. Similarly, the available
data did not include a reliable measure of group mem-
bership continuity, which meant that we had to rely on
groups reported at W1 as a proxy for groups gained, lost
and
maintained
at
W2
(following
retirement).
To
advance our understanding of issues of group member-
ship continuity in identity transitions, future research
should include specific objective measures of identity
continuity as well as subjective measures tapping into
people’s experiences of such continuity.
Second, while our results provide clear support for the
hypothesised association between our variables, they do
not provide evidence that maintaining and developing
group memberships has a causal impact on life quality
and mortality (eg, due to additional variables that we
did not account for). Beyond this, while group member-
ships may have a causal impact on quality of life and
health, these relationships are also likely to be bidirec-
tional such that health may also affect people’s ability to
engage with their group memberships. Nevertheless,
controlling for initial levels of the independent and
dependent variables allowed us to isolate the impact of a
change in the predictor
(group memberships) on
change in the dependent variables quality of life and
mortality (in the case of the latter we controlled for sub-
jective physical health). Certainly, not least on the basis
of a wealth of other evidence,14 15 33 34 40 41 we believe
that the potential causal impact of social group member-
ships on quality of life and health is an important issue
that has significant practical implications. It remains,
however, that in the case of retirement, this causal rela-
tionship can only be conclusively demonstrated in future
work using experimental or intervention methods—in
particular, by examining the extent to which an interven-
tion that facilitates retirees’ membership in social groups
can be beneficial for subsequent adjustment and health.
Research of this form is currently underway, to address
precisely this issue.
Furthermore, there was some attrition in our sample.
It is worth noting that an analysis of attrition in the
ELSA62 indicates that there are few individual-level
characteristics that predict subsequent attrition and that
attrition is not due to prior disease prevalence, provid-
ing some assurance that the present relationships relat-
ing to quality of life and health are not due to biased
attrition. We would also like to note that we specified
characteristics of the matched control group to ensure

 that this group was of identical size and had character-
istics that were as similar as possible to those of the
retiree group. The fact that the rate of attrition was com-
parable between these groups (we retained N=296 retir-
ees and N=302 matched controls for the analysis of
quality of life, and N=410 retirees and N=424 matched
controls for the analysis of mortality) while the focal
relationships differ in these groups provides some add-
itional assurance that attrition is unlikely to account for
the present relationship.
Finally, even though the present sample allowed us to
track a very large number of retirees, in future research
it would clearly be valuable to examine the hypothesised
relationships
in
other
contexts
and
samples.
For
instance, there would be value in examining the extent
to which the relationship between group memberships
and quality of life and health holds in semiretired indivi-
duals (including those who engage in bridge or volun-
teer work).63 Relatedly, it is conceivable that group
memberships also have a bearing on retirement plan-
ning and the general decision-making processes that
retirees engage in such that those with a greater number
of
non-work
related
group
memberships
may,
for
instance, be less willing to prolong their working life.
Moreover, it is also possible that the perceived compati-
bility between different social group memberships has
an additional role to play in affecting adjustment (such
that the health-fostering impact of group memberships
is more pronounced to the extent that memberships are
compatible with each other). Such possibilities raise
important questions and avenues for future research.
CONCLUSION
The present research sought to extend previous research
through a longitudinal examination of the extent to
which the health and quality of life of newly-retired indi-
viduals
is
impacted
by
social
group
memberships.
Findings provide consistent support for hypothesised
relationships in showing that, even after controlling for
sociodemographic variables, the number of groups that
retirees are members of is a predictor of both their sub-
sequent quality of life and their likelihood of dying;
being as good a predictor as physical activity. In showing
that it is group memberships following (rather than
prior to) retirement that determine long-term life and
health quality, findings also indicate that group member-
ships play a unique role in the transition to retirement
by affecting people’s health and quality of life once they
cease formal employment. Importantly, these findings
not only identify a new locus for retirement research but
also suggest a new avenue for practical intervention.
