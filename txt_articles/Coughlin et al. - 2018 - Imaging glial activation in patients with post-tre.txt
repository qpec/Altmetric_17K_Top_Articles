Abstract
The pathophysiology of post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) may be linked to overactive immunity
including aberrant activity of the brain’s resident immune cells, microglia. Here we used [11C]DPA-713 and
positron emission tomography to quantify the 18 kDa translocator protein, a marker of activated microglia or
reactive astrocytes, in the brains of patients with post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms of any duration compared to
healthy controls. Genotyping for the TSPO rs6971 polymorphism was completed, and individuals with the rare, low affinity
binding genotype were excluded. Data from eight brain regions demonstrated higher [11C]DPA-713 binding in 12
patients relative to 19 controls. [11C]DPA-713 PET is a promising tool to study cerebral glial activation in PTLDS and its link
to cognitive symptoms.

Background
Lyme disease, a vector-borne infectious disease caused
by Borrelia burgdorferi, is endemic across large regions
of the Northern Hemisphere [1]. If untreated, the bac-
teria can disseminate from the site of transmission (tick
bite) to other organs. Prompt treatment with appropriate
antibiotic therapy often leads to successful resolution of
disease while lag to treatment portends worse outcome
[2], including the potential for neurologic complications.
Even with timely diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic
treatment, 10–20% of individuals develop a constellation
of symptoms that may include fatigue, pain, sleep dis-
ruption, and cognitive difficulties [3]. In contrast to
“chronic Lyme disease” that is less precisely defined [4],
post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is a
condition characterized by symptoms that manifest
within 6 months of treatment and persist 6 months or
longer [3], which can be very debilitating [5].
The etiology of PTLDS remains unclear and may occur
through chronic, peripheral inflammatory response with
signaling factors that can diffuse across the blood-brain
barrier, or through more direct central nervous system
(CNS) immunity [6, 7]. Recent evidence supports persist-
ence of non-viable spirochetes or their remnants in
human joint synovial tissue after antibiotic treatment [8,
9], and rare spirochetes have been found in the CNS of
antibiotic-treated monkeys [9]. In vitro models have
shown that debris from treated spirochetes may elicit
chronic secretion of inflammatory signaling molecules (cy-
tokines, chemokines) by microglia, the resident immune
cells in the brain, or other cell types such as oligodendro-
cytes or infiltrating lymphocytes [10–12]. In a recent study
of primary human microglia treated with antibiotic-killed
or sonicated spirochetes, the response of increased expres-
sion of inflammatory proteins was more robust than after
treatment with live spirochetes [12]. Together, these data
suggest that if spirochete antigens remain in the CNS after
antibiotic treatment, they may facilitate a persistent neu-
roimmune response linked to neuropsychiatric symptoms

 of PTLDS. Validating this proposed pathophysiology in
vivo may inform immune-modulating therapeutic strat-
egies to improve outcomes.
The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a mito-
chondrial protein that is greatly increased in its
expression by activated microglia and reactive astro-
cytes [13]. Since cerebral TSPO can be measured
using radiotracers such as [11C]DPA-713 with positron
emission
tomography
(PET),
imaging
TSPO
has
proven a useful method to test for hypothesized im-
mune activation in vivo in relevant neurological condi-
tions such as human immunodeficiency virus-related
neurodegeneration, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
traumatic brain injury [14–16]. [11C]DPA-713 is a
second-generation radiotracer for imaging TSPO that
has superior binding specificity compared to the
first-generation radiotracer, [11C]-(R)-PK11195 [17].
Here, we used [11C]DPA-713 PET in a pilot population
of well-characterized patients with persistent symp-
toms following treatment for Lyme disease to test for
high availability of cerebral TSPO relative to healthy
controls. Since Lyme disease is likely to drive a sys-
temic immune response, we posited further that the
relatively high TSPO distribution in brains of these
patients would be diffusely spread across brain regions
rather than focal in pattern.
Methods
Participants
This study was conducted under a protocol approved by
a Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board and under
an FDA Investigational New Drug application. All par-
ticipants provided written, informed consent. Adult
(age ≥ 18 years) patients were recruited from the Johns
Hopkins
Lyme
Disease
Research
Center
and
were
eligible if they had (1) a prior, medically documented
case of probable or confirmed Lyme disease by CDC cri-
teria [18], (2) history of appropriate treatment, and (3)
post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms of any duration.
Historical [11C]DPA-713 PET data from all healthy indi-
viduals 18–65 years old were pooled from two prior
studies [15, 16].
Exclusion criteria for all participants included unstable
health or recent infection other than Lyme disease, his-
tory of neurological condition not attributable to Lyme
disease, clinical abnormality on screening assessment
(blood, urine, electrocardiogram), benzodiazepine or
anti-inflammatory medication use (including NSAIDs) in
the past 2 weeks, substance abuse (confirmed by screen-
ing toxicology), or contraindication to imaging [mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) or PET]. Antibiotic
treatment in the 2 weeks prior to imaging was allowed,
with the exception of minocycline, which may affect the
imaging results [19].
Clinical and neuropsychological assessment
Among patients, the Lyme disease history was confirmed
and characterized through review of medical records
and a clinical interview. Every patient also completed a
standardized assessment of symptoms [5] and battery of
neuropsychological tests [20].
Structural imaging
Each participant underwent a T1-weighted MRI on
either a 1.5-Tesla Signa Advantage system (GE Medical
Systems, Waukesha, WI, USA) or a Phillips Achieva 3
Tesla scanner (Andover, MA), to obtain a 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8
mm3 three-dimensional Magnetization-Prepared Rapid
Gradient-Echo sequence. MRI data were used to screen
for structural abnormality and to delineate anatomical
regions of interest (ROIs) after PET-MRI coregistration.
PET acquisition
The synthesis of [11C]DPA-713 was conducted as previ-
ously described [21], and the product met all U.S.
Pharmacopeia Convention Chapter <<823> acceptance
testing criteria. Each participant was fitted with a
thermoplastic
face
mask
for
head
positioning
and
immobilization during the emission scan. After a 6-min
transmission scan that was acquired prior to the emis-
sion scan, [11C]DPA-713 was delivered with high specific
radioactivity (Table 1) via intravenous bolus injection at
the beginning of a 90-min dynamic list mode PET acqui-
sition. The average injected dose was 691.9 ± 18.3 MBq.
The arterial plasma input function was acquired from 25
to 35 blood samples collected over the duration of the
scan, with additional blood sample collection at eight
time points for measurement of metabolites as in our
prior work [22]. PET data were acquired on a High
Resolution Research Tomograph (Siemens Healthcare,
Knoxville, TN, USA), and the 90-min listmode data were
binned into 30 frames and reconstructed using the itera-
tive ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm,
with correction for radioactive decay, dead time, attenu-
ation, scatter and random coincidences in an identical
fashion to our previous work [15, 16]. Attenuation maps
were generated from the transmission data. Recon-
structed images consisted of cubic voxels, each 1.22
mm3, with dimensions of 31 cm × 31 cm (transaxially)
and 25 cm (axially).
Use of TSPO-targeting second-generation radiotracers,
including [11C]DPA-713, must account for the effect of a
single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6971) within TSPO
on radiotracer binding affinity [16]. This genotyping was
completed
for
each
participant,
with
inclusion
of
imaging data from individuals with high or mixed affin-
ity binding phenotypes (C/C or C/T genotype) and
exclusion of those with the low affinity phenotype (T/T
genotype) [16].

 Image analysis
The software package PMOD (v3.7, PMOD Technologies
Ltd., Zurich, Switzerland) was used for PET image pro-
cessing and kinetic analysis. Inter-frame motion correction
was performed by rigidly realigning each of the 30 frames
to the 0–30-min mean PET image, the latter obtained by
averaging frames 1 through 18. The 0–30-min PET mean
image and then each of the 30 motion-corrected PET
frames were co-registered to the subject’s T1-weighted
MRI using rigid transformations. Time-activity curves
were generated from PET data in each region of interest
(ROI) that were segmented from the T1-weighted MRI of
each participant using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).
Eight
ROIs
were
selected a priori (Additional file 1: Figure S1) and included
cortical (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, cingulate)
and subcortical (hippocampus, thalamus) regions. The
volume of each ROI normalized to total intracranial
volume (regional volume ratio) was also calculated and
used to test for regional atrophy in the patients compared
to controls since this measure accounts for individual vari-
ability in head size [23].
Using the time-activity curve data, the kinetics of
[11C]DPA-713 were modeled using Logan graphical
analysis (t* = 30 min) with metabolite-corrected arterial
input function from 90-min dynamic data. The model
produced an estimate of total distribution volume, VT,
for each region as previously validated for [11C]DPA-713
PET [14, 22]. VT represents the ratio of radioligand
concentration in brain tissue to that in plasma at equi-
librium and is proportional to the receptor density in
the ROI [24].
Statistical analysis
Regional VT values were first examined visually. Pooling
data from all ROIs, regression analysis was performed
on the person-region level to estimate the difference in
VT between groups, adjusting for confounding factors.
Specifically, we fit a linear mixed effects regression
model with VT as the dependent variable, and group as
the independent variable of interest, adjusting for TSPO
genotype, ROI, and factors with found effects on VT
[age, body mass index (BMI)]. Person was included as a
random intercept to account for the within-subject
correlation of VT across regions. The threshold for sig-
nificance was set to P < 0.05 unless otherwise noted.
Statistical analyses were performed in R 3.4.3.
Results
The 12 patients and 19 historical controls did not sig-
nificantly differ in age, gender, and BMI (Table 1), al-
though all the patients were white and the controls
varied in race. There were no differences in the injection
parameters between groups. Comparison of regional vol-
ume ratios revealed no regional atrophy in patients com-
pared to controls (Table 1).
Half of the patients had a prior confirmed case of
Lyme disease, and the others had prior probable Lyme
disease by CDC criteria (Table 2). Each patient reported
the presence of fatigue and at least one cognitive symp-
tom (difficulty finding words, difficulty concentrating, or
memory change). The 12 patients had 17.6 ± 3.2 years of

logical performance (T-scores) and reported symptoms
are presented in Table 2.
VT values across the eight ROIs were highly corre-
lated among the study population (correlation coeffi-
cients ρ ≥ 0.97), indicating low inter-region variability
within individual subjects (Additional file 2: Figure
S2). Patients had higher VT compared to controls
across all ROIs (Fig. 1a). Pooling data from all ROIs,
the linear mixed effects regression model adjusting for
TSPO genotype, brain region, age, and BMI estimated
a mean difference [95% confidence interval] of 0.58
[0.12, 1.03] between the groups (P = 0.015). The find-
ing of higher VT in the patient group relative to
controls was unchanged after restricting to white par-
ticipants. Additionally, we found no significant differ-
ences in VT values when comparing CDC confirmed with
probable patients, and when comparing patients with per-
sistent symptoms lasting < 6 months after antibiotic treat-
ment and those with PTLDS (≥ 6 months of symptoms
after antibiotic treatment). Controlling for age, BMI, and
genotype, individual linear regression models fit for indi-
vidual ROIs showed significant differences in the cerebel-
lum, frontal cortex, parietal cortex, thalamus, temporal
cortex, and cingulate cortex. Mean parametric images of
[11C]DPA-713 VT support higher binding in patients rela-
tive to controls in other regions beyond those selected a
priori (Fig. 1b).
Exploratory analyses found no relationships between
[11C]DPA-713 VT and performance on any cognitive test
or standardized symptom score within patients after
controlling for genotype, age, and BMI.
Discussion
Our [11C]DPA-713 PET data are consistent with higher
levels of TSPO within eight brain regions among pa-
tients with persistent symptoms following treated Lyme
disease compared to healthy controls and suggest the
same pattern in other regions. These findings are in

 keeping with previously demonstrated evidence of circu-
lating (serum) inflammatory markers in those with
PTLDS or Lyme encephalopathy [6, 25] and uniquely
support immune activation in the CNS in symptomatic
patients with Lyme disease post-antibiotic treatment.
Our design was rigorous in the characterization of the
patient group. We included only patients with a history
of CDC-confirmed or probable physician-documented
Lyme disease in their medical record, appropriate anti-
biotic treatment, and post-treatment symptoms. Each
patient in this study reported fatigue and at least one
cognitive symptom. Notably, the patient sample was
highly symptomatic on standardized questionnaires, and
reported health-related quality of life (SF-36 scores)
approximately 1.5 SD below the population mean. Fu-
ture studies designed to test the relationships between
[11C]DPA-713 binding and neuropsychological deficits
or symptoms in larger, clinical samples are needed.
Our
study
has
limitations.
First,
while TSPO
is
increased in expression by activated microglia and react-
ive astrocytes, the imaging signal from TSPO cannot
distinguish among the diverse functional phenotypes of
activated microglial cells that may contribute to detri-
mental or reparative effect on surrounding brain tissue
[26]. Second, the observers were not blinded, which could
potentially introduce subconscious bias in assessment of
outcomes. Third, although our study demonstrated that
patients with persistent symptoms following treatment for

 Lyme disease had higher levels of TSPO compared to con-
trols, the historical control group lacked data from stan-
dardized symptom or neurocognitive assessment. Future
studies, including comparative study with other control
groups (such as non-infected individuals who share symp-
toms with the patient group) or longitudinal study of indi-
viduals who return to health after Lyme disease, will
delineate further whether higher levels of TSPO are asso-
ciated with persistent symptoms after treated Borrelia
burgdorferi infection. Finally, multiple comparisons cor-
rection was not performed given the small sample size,
multiple confounders, and highly correlated outcomes
(correlation coefficients ρ ≥0.97).
As we demonstrate the promise of [11C]DPA-713 PET
to study the neuroimmune response in PTLDS, we note
that this imaging provides indirect measurement of
TSPO. Complementary, direct study of markers of acti-
vated glia with functional phenotyping of these cells in
human postmortem brain tissue or in relevant animal
models will inform further these findings. Additionally,
parallel assays of peripheral immune markers and longi-
tudinal assessments of cerebral [11C]DPA-713 binding
over the course of pre- and post-treatment Lyme disease
will temporally characterize better the immune response,
and comparison to data from non-infected controls with
overlapping symptoms will be crucial to elucidate the
links between Lyme infection, aberrant immunity, and
PTLDS. These complementary data may inform whether
immunotherapeutic approaches like those used in other
central nervous system conditions [27] may benefit those
with PTLDS. Within our growing, well-characterized
clinical population, the effect of risk factors for PTLDS
such as delayed time to appropriate antibiotic treatment
or duration of untreated illness on [11C]DPA-713 bind-
ing may be probed in future work.
Conclusions
In summary, our results support the hypothesized role
of CNS immune activation in patients with PTLDS.
Further study of the relationship between higher glial
activation in the CNS, systemic inflammatory signaling,
and cognitive performance in PTLDS is needed.
