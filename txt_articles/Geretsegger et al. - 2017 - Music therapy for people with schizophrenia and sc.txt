Background
Music therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses musical interaction as a means of communication and expression. Within the area
of serious mental disorders, the aim of the therapy is to help people improve their emotional and relational competencies, and address
issues they may not be able to using words alone.
Objectives
To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, compared with placebo therapy, standard care or no
treatment for people with serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia.
Search methods
We searchedthe Cochrane SchizophreniaGroup’sTrialsStudy-BasedRegister(December2010and 15 January, 2015)andsupplemented
this by contacting relevant study authors, handsearching of music therapy journals and manual searches of reference lists.
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared music therapy with standard care, placebo therapy, or no treatment.
Data collection and analysis
Review authors independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. We excluded data where more than 30% of
participants in any group were lost to follow-up. We synthesised non-skewed continuous endpoint data from valid scales using a
standardised mean difference (SMD). We employed a fixed-effect model for all analyses. If statistical heterogeneity was found, we
examined treatment dosage (i.e. number of therapy sessions) and treatment approach as possible sources of heterogeneity.
Main results
Ten new studies have been added to this update; 18 studies with a total 1215 participants are now included. These examined effects
of music therapy over the short, medium, and long-term, with treatment dosage varying from seven to 240 sessions. Overall, most
information is from studies at low or unclear risk of bias

Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 A positive effect on global state was found for music therapy compared to standard care (medium term, 2 RCTs, n = 133, RR 0.38
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.59, low-quality evidence, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome NNTB
2, 95% CI 2 to 4). No binary data were available for other outcomes. Medium-term continuous data identified good effects for music
therapy on negative symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (3 RCTs, n = 177, SMD - 0.55 95% CI -
0.87 to -0.24, low-quality evidence). General mental state endpoint scores on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale were better
for music therapy (2 RCTs, n = 159, SMD -0.97 95% CI -1.31 to -0.63, low-quality evidence), as were average endpoint scores on the
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (1 RCT, n = 70, SMD -1.25 95% CI -1.77 to -0.73, moderate-quality evidence). Medium-term average
endpoint scores using the Global Assessment of Functioning showed no effect for music therapy on general functioning (2 RCTs, n =
118, SMD -0.19 CI -0.56 to 0.18, moderate-quality evidence). However, positive effects for music therapy were found for both social
functioning (Social Disability Screening Schedule scores; 2 RCTs, n = 160, SMD -0.72 95% CI -1.04 to -0.40), and quality of life
(General Well-Being Schedule scores: 1 RCT, n = 72, SMD 1.82 95% CI 1.27 to 2.38, moderate-quality evidence). There were no data
available for adverse effects, service use, engagement with services, or cost.
Authors’ conclusions
Moderate- to low-quality evidence suggests that music therapy as an addition to standard care improves the global state, mental state
(including negative and general symptoms), social functioning, and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like
disorders. However, effects were inconsistent across studies and depended on the number of music therapy sessions as well as the
quality of the music therapy provided. Further research should especially address the long-term effects of music therapy, dose-response
relationships, as well as the relevance of outcome measures in relation to music therapy.

Music therapy for schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders
Review Question
What are the effects of providing music therapy or adding music therapy to treatment for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-
like disorders?
Background
Characteristics of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders are disordered thoughts, feelings, beliefs and perceptions. People with
schizophrenia often have two main types of symptoms: the acute symptoms of hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations) and
strange beliefs (delusions), and chronic symptoms such as low mood/depression, social withdrawal, and memory problems. Music
therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses music experiences to help people with serious mental disorders improve their emotional and
relational competencies and addresses issues that they may not be able to using words alone.
Searching for evidence
We ran electronic searches up to January 2015 for trials randomising people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders to
receive music therapy or standard care. We found and checked 176 potential studies.
Evidence found
Eighteen trials with a total of 1215 participants met the review requirements and provided useful data.
The evidence currently available is of low to moderate quality. The results of these studies suggest that music therapy improves global
state and may also improve mental state, functioning, and quality of life if a sufficient number of music therapy sessions are provided.
Conclusions
Music therapy seems to help people with schizophrenia but further research is needed to confirm the positive effects found in this
review. This research should especially address the long-term effects of music therapy, the quality of music therapy provided and measure
outcomes relevant to music therapy.

Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)

Description of the condition
Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder with considerable im-
pact on individuals and their families. It may take a life-long
course, although full recovery is also observed in a proportion of
cases. Symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified as ’posi-
tive’ (where something is added, such as hallucinations or para-
noid ideation) and ’negative’ (where something is missing, such
as the ability to express oneself emotionally or to form satisfying
relationships with others). The aspects of schizophrenia that are
linked to losing and regaining creativity, emotional expressiveness,
social relationships, and motivation may be particularly important
in relation to music therapy (Gold 2009).
Description of the intervention
Music therapy is generally defined as “a systematic process of inter-
vention wherein the therapist helps the client to promote health,
usingmusicexperiencesandthe relationshipsthatdevelopthrough
them as dynamic forces of change (Bruscia 1998).” It often ad-
dresses intra- and interpsychic, as well as social processes by using
musical interaction as a means of communication, expression, and
transformation. Within the area of serious mental disorders, the
aim of the therapy is to help people improve their emotional and
relational competencies, and to address issues they may not be able
to using words alone.
Music therapy as a profession (with its own academic and clinical
training courses) was first introduced in North and South America
in the 1940s. The first European country (Austria) followed in
1959, and soon after that many other countries followed (Maranto
1993). It is now a state-registered profession in some countries
(Austria, Latvia, UK). A survey based in Germany showed that
music therapy was used in 37% of all psychiatric and psychoso-
matic clinics (Andritzky 1996).
Music therapy models practised today are most commonly based
on psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive behavioural or devel-
opmental theory (Gold 2009; Wigram 2002). Traditionally, be-
havioural models have been more prevalent in the USA, whereas
psychodynamic and humanistic models have dominated in Eu-
rope; in other parts of the world there may be mixed influences.
However, the various theoretical models in music therapy and their
applications do not necessarily form distinct categories, but rather
prototypical positions in a varied but coherent field.
Other than by their theoretical orientation, approaches in music
therapy may also be described by their modality (’active’ versus
’receptive’), their level of structure, and the focus on the music
itself versus on verbal processing of the music experiences. The
active modality includes all activities where clients are invited to
play or sing. This includes a variety of activities ranging from free
improvisation to reproducing songs. Receptive techniques, on the
other hand, refer to clients listening to music; this may be played
by the therapist for the client, or recorded music may be selected by
either therapist or client. Although some models of music therapy
rely exclusively on one mode of musical interaction, most models
use a mixture of both.
Secondly, the level of predefined structuring may vary. Some ther-
apists may impose a greater degree of structure than others, either
by using more structured forms of music-making or by selecting
activities before the sessions, as opposed to developing these in di-
alogue with the client. The level of structuring may depend on the
client’s needs, but may also vary between music therapy models.
For example, it has been observed that there are considerable dif-
ferences between American and European approaches in the level
of structuring (Wigram 2002). A recent review concluded that ex-
treme positions were rarely observed and most studies used some
structure as well as some flexibility (Gold 2009). A third relevant
distinction concerns the focus of attention. Some music therapists
and music therapy models may focus more on the processes oc-
curring within the music itself, whereas others have a greater focus
on the verbal reflection of the client’s issues brought forth by these
musical processes (Gold 2009).
In summary, music therapy for people with serious mental disor-
ders often relies on a mixture of active and receptive techniques,
even though musical improvisation and verbalisation of the musi-
cal interaction are often central. Music therapists working in clin-
ical practice with this population usually have extensive training.
Music therapy with patients in mental health care is usually pro-
vided either in an individual or a small group setting and is often
continued over an extended period of time (Wigram 1999). Active
participation is crucial for the success of music therapy. Partici-
pants do not need musical skills, but a motivation to work actively
within a music therapy process is important.
How the intervention might work
Music therapy is often justified by a proposed need for a medium
for communication and expression other than verbal language.
Some people with serious mental disorders may be too disturbed
to use verbal language alone efficiently as a therapeutic medium.
Research on parent-infant communication is often cited as a ratio-
nale for using music therapy; this body of research has shown that
the earliest communication that humans develop has many ’musi-
cal’ qualities (Ansdell 2010a; Stern 2010; Trevarthen 2000). More
pragmatically, clinical reports have suggested that music therapy
can have unique motivating, relationship-building, and emotion-
ally expressive qualities that may help even those who do not ben-
efit from verbal therapy (Rolvsjord 2001; Solli 2008). The musi-
cal interaction in music therapy might also support a re-establish-
ment of musical resources and competencies affecting the patient’s
everyday life. This has been described from a patient perspective

 as an important factor in music therapy increasing quality of life
(Ansdell 2010b).
Why it is important to do this review
In its early years, music therapy was established in selected hos-
pitals, by enthusiastic individuals (Mössler 2011a), on the basis
of successful case histories. The degree to which music therapy is
available still varies greatly across and even within countries. As
music therapy is becoming more established as a profession and as
a service in mental health care, the need for documented evidence
of its effects increases.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). If a trial was
described in a way that implied that the study was randomised,
we included such trials in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no
substantive difference within primary outcomes (see Types of
outcome measures) when these ’implied randomisation’ studies
were added, then we included them in the final analysis. If there
was a substantive difference, we only used randomised trials and
we described the results of the sensitivity analysis in the text. We
excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by
using alternate days of the week.
Types of participants
People with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders, diag-
nosed by any criteria, irrespective of gender, age or nationality.
Types of interventions
1. Music therapy or music therapy added to standard care
Music therapy is defined as “a systematic process of intervention
wherein the therapist helps the client to promote health, using
musicexperiencesandthe relationshipsthatdevelopthrough them
as dynamic forces of change” (Bruscia 1998). This definition of
music therapy is rather broad and inclusive of different models,
but distinguishes clearly from music listening alone: for it to be
music therapy, there has to be a therapist, and the client-therapist
relationship as well as the music experience are relevant factors.
2. Placebo
Defined as an alternative therapy designed to control for effects of
the therapist’s attention.
3. Standard care or no treatment
Types of outcome measures
Where possible, we reported outcomes for the short term (up to
12 weeks), medium term (13 to 26 weeks), and long term (more
than 26 weeks).
Primary outcomes
There is currently no consensus as to what should be the primary
outcomes of music therapy for people with schizophrenia. Goals
described by music therapists tend to describe ’soft’ outcomes such
as well-being, self-esteem, the ability to express oneself and to re-
late to others, or a sense of identity; outcomes such as overall symp-
tom reduction or improved general functioning seem to be only
indirectly related to those goals. However, symptom-related out-
comes are most commonly measured in research studies. Notably,
measures of negative symptoms include impairments in the ability
to express oneself and to relate to others, but also include other
domains. Because of the importance to people with schizophrenia
we regard the following as primary outcomes.
1. Global state
1.1 Clinically important change in global state - as defined by
individual studies
2. Mental state
2.1 Clinically important change in general mental state - as defined
by individual studies
2.2 Clinically important change in specific symptoms: negative
symptoms - as defined by individual studies
3. Functioning
3.1 Clinically important change in general functioning - as defined
by individual studies
3.2 Clincially important change in social functioning - as defined
by individual studies

’Summary of findings’ table
We usedthe GRADEapproach tointerpretfindings(Schünemann
2011). A ’Summary of findings’ table was created using the
GRADE profiler into which data were imported from RevMan.
This table provides outcome-specific information concerning the
overall quality of evidence from each included study and the mag-
nitude of effect of the interventions examined. Available data on
those outcomes that we rated as most important regarding patient-
care and decision making are presented in this table. We selected
the following main outcomes for inclusion in the Summary of
findings for the main comparison.
1. Global state: no clinically important overall improvement
2. Mental state: specific - negative symptoms
3. Mental state: general mental state
4. General functioning
5. Social functioning
6. Quality of Life
Search methods for identification of studies
1. Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register
On January 15, 2015, the Information Specialist searched the
Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study-Based Register of Trials
using the following search strategy:
(*music*) in Intervention Field of STUDY.
The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Registry of Trials is com-
piled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED,
BIOSIS, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed,
and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, hand-
searches, grey literature, and conference proceedings (see Group
Module). There is no language, date, document type, or publica-
tion status limitations for inclusion of records into the register.
For previous searches, please see Appendix 1.
2. Handsearching
We searched the three American music therapy journals (Journal
of Music Therapy, Music Therapy and Music Therapy Perspectives)
as reissued on CD-ROM by the American Music Therapy Associ-
ation using the search term random* and then manually browsing
through the results. The search covered the Journal of Music Ther-
apy (1964-1998), Music Therapy (1981-1996) and Music Therapy
Perspectives (1982-1984, 1986-1998).
3. Reference searching
We also inspected the references of all identified studies, included
or excluded, for more studies.
4. Personal contact
We contacted corresponding authors of relevant reviews or studies
to enquire about other sources of relevant information.
5. Review articles
We inspected existing review articles pertinent to the topic of this
review (Oerter 2001; Silverman 2003b) for references to any ad-
ditional studies.
6. Cited reference search (forward search)
We searched ISI Web of Science for articles citing any of the in-
cluded studies, in order to identify any more recent studies that
might have been missed.
Data collection and analysis
We have updated our methods in line with current Cochrane pol-
icy. For previous data collection and analysis methods please see
Appendix 2. We have now for the most part adhered to the cur-
rent template as provided by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group
(CSG). Substantial deviations from the template, in line with our
protocol and previous review versions, are:
1. definite exclusion of therapist-rated scales, rather than
vague statement about possible exclusion (Data extraction and
management);
2. exclusion of skewed data that cannot be transformed, rather
than presenting skewed data from studies of less than 200
participants in additional tables (Data extraction and
management);
3. use of standardised mean differences (SMDs) rather than
mean differences (MDs) (Measures of treatment effect);
4. subgroups to be analysed (Subgroup analysis and
investigation of heterogeneity).
Selection of studies
Review authors XJC, TOH, and KM independently inspected
citations from the searches and identified relevant abstracts. Re-
view author XJC first inspected study reports written in Chinese
and then translated relevant sections. Those translated sections
were then re-inspected by CG, TOH and KM to ensure reliability.
Where disputes arose, we acquired the full report for more detailed
scrutiny. If citations met the inclusion criteria, we obtained full
reports of the papers for more detailed inspection. Where it was
not possible to resolve disagreement by discussion, we attempted
to contact authors of the study for clarification.

 Data extraction and management
1. Extraction
Review authors XJC, KM, and MG extracted data from all in-
cluded studies. Any disagreement was discussed and review author
CG helped to clarify any ongoing problems. We extracted data
presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible, but we
only included the data if two review authors independently had
the same result. We reported all decisions and, if necessary, we
contacted the authors of studies through an open-ended request in
order to obtain missing information or for clarification. If multi-
centre studies had been included, we would have extracted data
relevant to each component centre separately where possible.
2. Management
We extracted data onto standard, simple forms. The emergence
of studies with mixed samples (including eligible and non-eligible
participants) in the present update necessitated an additional deci-
sion rule. We decided to include such studies only if (i.) individual
patient data or group data for the eligible subsample were available
to us; (ii.) the number of eligible participants was at least as high
as the sample of the smallest study with a non-mixed sample; and
(iii.) outcomes were relevant to schizophrenia (as judged by their
use also in at least one non-mixed sample).
2.1 Scale-derived data
We included continuous data from rating scales only if:
a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have
been described in a peer-reviewed journal (Marshall 2000); and
b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by
one of the trialists for that particular trial.
To be considered in this review, the measuring instrument should
either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or
relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported
clearly. Therefore, detailed information on this was provided in
the Characteristics of included studies section.
2.2 Endpoint versus change data
There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change
data can remove a component of between-person variability from
the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two
assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult to
measure in unstable conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided
primarily to use endpoint data, and would have used change data
if the former had not been available.
2.3 Skewed data
Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not
normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric
tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following
standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations (SDs)
and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from
the authors; b) when a scale starts from a finite number (such as
zero), the SD, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as
otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of
the centre of the distribution, (Altman 1996); c) if a scale started
from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Symptoms
Scale (PANSS, Kay 1986) which can have values from 30 to 210),
the calculation described above was modified to take the scale
starting point into account. In these cases skewness was present
if 2 SD > (S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the
minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start
and endpoint and these rules can be applied. When continuous
data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative
values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data
are skewed or not. When individual patient data were available,
we attempted to remove skewness through log-transformation.
Where this was not possible, we did not consider skewed data in
this review.
2.4 Common measure
To facilitate comparison between trials, we would have converted
variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in
hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common
metric (e.g. mean days per month).
2.5 Conversion of continuous to binary
Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures
to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off
points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into
’clinically improved’ or ’not clinically improved’. It is generally
assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score
such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, Overall 1962)
or the PANSS (Kay 1986), this could be considered as a clinically
significant response (Leucht 2005; Leucht 2005a). If data based
on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-
off presented by the original authors.
2.6 Direction of graphs
We entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the
line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for music therapy
when the outcome was negative (where ’high’ means ’poor’), and
reversed for positive outcomes (where ’high’ means ’good’).

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Review authors XJC and KM independently assessed the risk of
bias for evaluating trial quality by using criteria described in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011). This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations be-
tween overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such
as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incom-
plete outcome data, and selective reporting. If the raters disagreed,
we made the final rating by consensus with the involvement of
CG. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other char-
acteristics of trials were provided, we contacted the authors of the
studies in order to obtain further information. We reported non-
concurrence in quality assessment, but if disputes arose as to which
category a trial was to be allocated, again, we resolved this by dis-
cussion. We noted the level of risk of bias in both the text of the
review and in the Summary of findings for the main comparison.
Measures of treatment effect
1. Binary data
For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the
fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It
has been shown that RR is more intuitive (Boissel 1999) than odds
ratiosandthatoddsratiostendtobe interpretedasRRbyclinicians
(Deeks 2000). For statistically significant results, we calculated
the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome
(NNTB)andthe numberneededtotreatforan additional harmful
outcome (NNTH), and its 95% CI taking account of the event
rate in the control group.
2. Continuous data
For continuous outcomes, we estimated standardised mean differ-
ences (SMD) between groups. As standardised measures of effect
size, these are often more readily interpretable than mean differ-
ences (MDs) on the original scale, particularly when the scale is
not universally well-known (Cohen 1988; Gold 2004). However,
we also transformed the effect size back to the units of one or
more of the specific instruments to further aid interpretation and
to ensure comparability across schizophrenia reviews.
Unit of analysis issues
1. Cluster trials
Studies may employ ’cluster randomisation’ (such as randomisa-
tion by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered
data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class
correlation in clustered studies, leading to a ’unit of analysis’ error
(Divine 1992) where P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly nar-
row and statistical significance overestimated causing type I errors
(Bland 1997; Gulliford 1999).
Although no cluster trials were identified for this review, the
planned procedure for analysis would have been as follows. Where
clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would
have presented the data in a table, with an (*) symbol to indicate
the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. We would have
attempted to contact the first authors of studies to seek intra-class
correlation coefficients (ICCs) of their clustered data and to adjust
for this using accepted methods (Gulliford 1999). If the intra-class
correlation was not available, we would have used an external esti-
mate from similar studies (Higgins 2008). If clustering had been
incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have
presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study,
but adjusted for the clustering effect.
We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the
binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a ’design
effect’. This would have been calculated using the mean number of
participants per cluster (m) and the (ICC) [Design effect=1+(m-
1)*ICC] (Donner 2002). If the ICC was not reported it would
have been assumed to be 0.1 (Ukoumunne 1999).
If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into ac-
count ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthe-
sis with other studies would have been possible using the generic
inverse variance technique.
2. Cross-over trials
A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It oc-
curs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psycho-
logical) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the
second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase
the participants can differ systematically from their initial state
despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are
not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (Elbourne
2002). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, had
we included such trials, we would only have used data from the
first phase of cross-over studies.
3. Studies with multiple treatment groups
Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant,
we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data
were binary, we simply added and combined the data within the
two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we combined data fol-

Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Where
the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not re-
produce these data.

 Dealing with missing data
1. Overall loss of credibility
At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility
(Xia 2009). We excluded data from studies where more than 30%
of participants in any group were lost to follow-up (this did not
include the outcome of ’leaving the study early’). If, however, more
than 30% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total
loss was less than 30%, we marked such data with (*) to indicate
that such a result may well be prone to bias.
2. Binary
In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0%
and 30% and where these data were not clearly described, we
presented data on a ’once-randomised-always-analyse’ basis (an
intention-to-treat analysis). In studies with less than 30% dropout
rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative
outcome for dichotomous outcomes, except for the event of death
and adverse effects. For these outcomes, the rate of those who
stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - would
have been used for those who did not. We analysed the impact
of including studies with high attrition rates (20% to 30%) in
a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group
did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, we did
not add these data to trials with less attrition but presented them
separately.
3. Continuous
3.1 Attrition
In the case where attrition for a continuous outcome was between
0% and 30% and completer-only data were reported, we repro-
duced these.
3.2 Standard deviations
If SDs were not reported in the original studies, we tried to obtain
the missing values from the authors. In cases where measures of
variance for continuous data were missing, but an exact standard
error (SE) and CIs were available for group means and either P or t
values were available for differences in mean, we would have made
calculationsaccordingtothe rulesdescribedinthe CochraneHand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011): When
only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD =
SE * square root (n).Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011)
present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or
F values, CIs, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not
apply, we calculated or estimated the SDs according to a validated
imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other in-
cluded studies (Furukawa 2006). Although some of these impu-
tation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to
exclude a given study’s outcome and thus to lose information. We
nevertheless would have examined the validity of the imputations
in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.
3.3 Last observation carried forward
We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation
carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study
report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing
data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the
results (Leucht 2007). Therefore, where LOCF data had been used
in the trial, if less than 30% of the data had been assumed, we
would have reproduced these data and indicated that they were
the product of LOCF assumptions.
Assessment of heterogeneity
1. Clinical heterogeneity
We considered all included studies initially, without seeing com-
parison data, to judge clinical heterogeneity. We simply inspected
all studies for outlying people or situations which we had not pre-
dicted would arise. When such situations or participant groups
arose, we discussed them fully.
2. Methodological heterogeneity
We considered all included studies initially, without seeing com-
parison data, to judge methodological heterogeneity. We simply
inspected all studies for clearly outlying methods which we had not
predicted would arise. When such methodological outliers arose,
we discussed them fully.
3. Statistical heterogeneity
3.1. Visual inspection
We visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of sta-
tistical heterogeneity.
3.2 Employing the I2 statistic
We supplemented the visual inspection primarily by employing
the I2 statistic alongside the Chi2 P value. This provides an es-
timate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to
chance (Higgins 2003). The importance of the observed value of I2
depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of
evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. a P value from Chi2 test, or a CI for
I2). We interpreted an I2 estimate greater than or equal to around
12
Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi2 statistic as evi-
dence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Higgins 2011). When
substantial levels of heterogeneity were found in the primary out-
come, we explored reasons for heterogeneity (Subgroup analysis
and investigation of heterogeneity).
Assessment of reporting biases
We entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial
effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood
of overt publication bias (Davey Smith 1997). Reporting biases
arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced
by the nature and direction of results (Egger 1997). These are
described in Section 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We are aware that funnel
plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of
limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel
plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where
all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots
were possible, we would have sought statistical advice in their
interpretation.
Data synthesis
We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for
use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects
method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are
estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often
seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into
account differences between studies, even if there is no statistically
significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the
random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies
which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction
of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.
We chose fixed-effect model for all analyses.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
1. Subgroups
We anticipated no subgroup analyses.
2. Investigation of heterogeneity
If we found heterogeneity (see under Assessmentof heterogeneity),
we examined the following possible sources of heterogeneity:
1. treatment dosage (20 sessions or more versus less than 20
sessions); and
2. treatment approach (quality of music therapy method and
training).
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to investigate the effect of including studies with high
attrition rates on the primary outcomes, but no such studies were
identified in this review. We did however compare the results when
we included our assumptions regarding those lost to follow-up (see
Dealing with missing data) with ’completer only’ analyses.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The search for the first published version identified 34 potentially
relevant studies (Gold 2005a). Updated searches for the version
published in 2011 yielded 115 additional records (from 99 studies)
for a total of 149 records (Mössler 2011b). The search for the
current update yielded 31 new records for a total of 176 records.
After excluding duplicates and clearly irrelevant references, a total
of 115 studies (31 new for the current update) were inspected
closely for possible inclusion. Of these, we included a total of
18 studies (Characteristics of included studies) and excluded 97
studies (Characteristics of excluded studies); no ongoing studies
were identified (Figure 1).

 Included studies
We included 18 studies (1215 participants) that compared music
therapy added to standard care with standard care alone (Ceccato
2009; Cha 2012; Chang 2013; Fu 2013; Gold 2013; He 2005; Li
2007a; Liu 2013; Lu 2013; Mao 2013; Mohammadi 2012; Qu
2012; Talwar 2006; Tang 1994; Ulrich 2007; Wang 2013; Wen
2005; Yang 1998). The characteristicsof these studiesare described
below (see also Additional tables ’Music therapeutic approach’ and
Characteristics of included studies).
1. Length of trials
The duration of studies varied from one to six months. Ten studies
examined the short-term effects of music therapy over about one
to one-and-a-half months (Cha 2012; Chang 2013; Fu 2013; He
2005; Li 2007a; Lu 2013; Mohammadi 2012; Tang 1994; Ulrich
2007; Wen 2005). Seven trials investigated medium-term effects
over three to four months (Ceccato 2009; Gold 2013; Liu 2013;
Qu 2012; Talwar 2006; Wang 2013; Yang 1998). Two studies
(Gold 2013; Mao 2013) examined the long-term effects of music
therapy over six to nine months.
2. Participants
All studies included adults with schizophrenia or related psychoses.
The included studies differed somewhat with respect to diagnos-
tic heterogeneity. Three studies included people with schizophre-
nia as well as people with related psychoses (Gold 2013; Talwar
2006; Ulrich 2007). The other 15 trials were more restrictive,
allowing only people with schizophrenia (Ceccato 2009; Cha
2012; Chang 2013; Fu 2013; Li 2007a; Lu 2013; Mao 2013;
Mohammadi 2012; Qu 2012; Wen 2005), or only a certain sub-
type of schizophrenia (chronic: Liu 2013; Tang 1994; Wang 2013;
Yang 1998; type II: He 2005). People with acute positive symp-
toms were also excluded by Ulrich 2007. Diagnosis was based on
three different psychiatric classification systems primarily used in
the Western world (International Classification of Diseases (ICD),
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM))
andChina(Chinese Classificationof Mental Disorders(CCMD)).
The CCMD is similar in categorisation and structure to the ICD
and DSM in terms of most diagnostic items, though acknowl-
edging cultural-related differences (Lee 2001). ICD-10 was used
in Ceccato 2009, Fu 2013, Gold 2013, Talwar 2006, and Ulrich
2007; Tang 1994 referred to the DSM-III-R; Cha 2012, Lu 2013,
and Mohammadi 2012 referred to the DSM-IV. The CCMD-
2 was used in Yang 1998, and the current third version of the
CCMD was used as classification system in Chang 2013, He 2005,
Li 2007a, Liu 2013, Mao 2013, Qu 2012, Wang 2013, and Wen
2005.
History of the disorder was reported in nine of the studies (Chang
2013: mean 6.6 years; Fu 2013: mean 3.6 years; He 2005: around
nine years; Liu 2013: mean 9.7 years; Lu 2013: mean 25.0 years;
Mao 2013: mean 1.8 years; Qu 2012: range 2.2 to 5 years; Wang
2013: mean 13.6 years; Yang 1998: range two to 26 years).
One study targeted a broader population of mental healthcare
clients (Gold 2013); low motivation was the main inclusion crite-
rion. Although we did include the study in the review, we exam-
ined its results separately from the other studies that were specifi-
cally targeted at schizophrenia or related psychoses.
3. Setting
Sixteen studies concerned inpatients. Ceccato 2009 and Gold
2013, however, included both in- and outpatients.
4. Study size
Sample sizes (of participants meeting inclusion criteria for this
review) ranged from 30 to 96.
5. Interventions
5.1 Setting
All studies compared music therapy added to standard care with
standard care alone. The setting of music therapy was group ther-
apy in most of the studies; two studies (Gold 2013; Talwar 2006)
used an individual setting, while two others (Wang 2013; Yang
1998) used a combination of group and individual settings.
Music therapy varied according to the use of active and receptive
methods, level of structure, focus of discussions and verbal reflec-
tion. In five studies, the content of music therapy included recep-
tive working modalities (listening to music) (Ceccato 2009; Cha
2012; He 2005; Li 2007a; Wen 2005). Four trials included exclu-
sively active music making (improvisation, singing) (Fu 2013; Qu
2012; Talwar 2006; Ulrich 2007), and the remaining nine made
use of both active and receptive ingredients (Chang 2013; Gold
2013; Liu 2013; Lu 2013; Mao 2013; Mohammadi 2012; Tang
1994; Wang 2013; Yang 1998). For all trials, except for Ceccato
2009 and Mohammadi 2012, the musical experiences were de-
scribed as being accompanied by a discussion or verbal reflection
of therapy contents. The focus of discussions and level of structure
varied between patients, depending on their ability level (explicitly
mentioned in Ulrich 2007). There was variation in music therapy
methods including process-oriented approaches and more fixed-
session structures, but overall, all were within the accepted range.
There was more worrisome variation in music therapy training
(Table 1; see also below: Other potential sources of bias).
15
Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The number of sessions per week varied greatly from one (Talwar
2006) to six (Yang 1998). Where not explicitly stated, we calcu-
lated the maximum possible number of sessions received by pa-
tients from session frequency and treatment duration. The overall
number of sessions offered was below 20 in seven studies which
according to the a priori criteria for this review can be classified
as low dosage of music therapy; in 10 studies, 20 or more studies
were offered, corresponding to a high dosage; for three of these,
numbers of sessions offered were much higher than in other studies
(a total of 78 in Yang 1998, up to 160 in Qu 2012, and up to 240
in Mao 2013). The actual number of sessions received, however,
could have been less: Talwar 2006 reported that only 58% of all
participants received more than eight sessions. In one study (Cha
2012), the number of sessions offered was not reported.
There was also considerable variation in the total duration of ther-
apy (from one to six months). Ten of the studies can be classified
as short-term music therapy (up to 12 weeks) (Cha 2012; Chang
2013; Fu 2013; He 2005; Li 2007a; Lu 2013; Mohammadi 2012;
Tang 1994; Ulrich 2007; Wen 2005), seven studies as medium-
term music therapy (13 to 26 weeks) (Ceccato 2009; Gold 2013;
Liu 2013; Qu 2012; Talwar 2006; Wang 2013; Yang 1998), and
one (Mao 2013) as long-term music therapy (six months).
6. Outcomes
This section describes the outcomes used in the included stud-
ies, categorised according to the list of relevant outcomes in the
Methods section.
6.1 Global state
Global overall improvement, as judged by independent assessors,
was rated as clinically important improvement versus no such im-
provement (Gold 2013; Yang 1998).
6.2 Mental state
6.2.1 General mental state
a. Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale - PANSS (Kay 1987)
The PANSS scale was designed to address the severity of psy-
chopathology in patients with psychotic disorders. It consists of
30 items which belong to three subscales: positive symptoms, neg-
ative symptoms, and general psychopathology. Ratings are based
on a clinical interview and additional information from caregivers
or family members and clinical material. Each item is scored on a
seven-point Likert scale.
b. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (Overall 1988)
The BPRS scale isaclinician-ratedtool designedto addressseverity
of psychopathology in patients with psychotic disorders as well as
those with severe mood disorders. The 18 items of the scale include
common psychotic symptoms as well as mood disturbances. The
scale is administered by an experienced clinician based on a clinical
interview and observation of the patient. The items are scored on
a seven-point Likert scale.
6.2.2 Negative symptoms
Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (
Andreasen 1982)
The SANS is a clinician-rated instrument used to rate the presence
and severity of negative symptoms, including affective flattening
and blunting, alogia, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-associality, and
attentional impairment. It consists of 20 items which are rated by
trained raters using a clinical interview and additional collateral
information from clinical material and family or caregivers. The
items are scored using a six-point Likert scale.
6.2.3 Positive symptoms
a. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms - SAPS (
Andreasen 1984)
The SAPS is a scale used to rate the presence and severity of positive
symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior,
and positive formal thought disorder. It consists of 30 items, which
like in the SANS are rated by trained raters using a six-point Likert
scale.
6.2.4 Other specific aspects of mental state - Depression
a. Self-Rating Depression Scale - SDS (Zhang 2003)
The SDS scale is a self-report instrument designed to measure
levels of depression. It consists of 20 items each of which is scored
on a four-point Likert scale.
b. Hamilton Depression Scale - Ham-D (Hamilton 1960;
Hamilton 2000)
The Ham-D scale is a questionnaire for clinicians designed to
assess the severity of a patient’s major depression.
c. Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia - CDSS (Addington
1992).
The CDSS is a scale to assess the severity of depression separate
from positive, negative and extrapyramidal symptoms in people
with schizophrenia. It is a semi-structured interview consisting of
nine items; ratingsof the itemsare definedaccordingtooperational
criteria from zero to three.
6.2.5 Other specific aspects of mental state - Anxiety
Self-Rating Anxiety Scale - SAS (Zhang 2003)
The SAS scale is a self-report instrument designed to measure
anxiety-associated symptoms. It consists of 20 items each of which
is scored on a four-point Likert scale.
6.3 Leaving the study early
16
Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 This outcome was available in all studies, but events occurred only
in three studies (Gold 2013; Talwar 2006; Yang 1998).
6.4 Functioning
6.4.1 General functioning
a. Global Assessment of Functioning - GAF (Spitzer 2000)
The GAF scale is a clinician-rated scale to rate global functioning
on a continuum of mental health to mental disorder. It consists
of a single item ranging from one to 100 with anchor points. It is
usually rated on the basis of a clinical interview.
b. Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale - IADL
(Lawton 1969)
The IADL is an instrument to assess independent living skills. It
measures how a person is functioning at the present time in eight
domains of function. In Mao 2013, a modified scoring procedure
with four levels (one = independent to four = unable) was used
where lower scores indicate better ability (personal communica-
tion, 25 July 2016).
6.4.2 Social functioning
Social Disability Screening Schedule - SDSS (Wu 1998)
The SDSS (in Yang 1998 referred to as Social Disability Schedule
for Inpatients - SDSI) is a psychiatrist-rated scale used to rate
levels of social functioning on the basis of a semi-structured clinical
interview. As only scores of subscales were reported in Fu 2013,
we added up these subscale scores to a sum score, and imputed
standard deviation (SDs) from subscale SDs.
6.4.3 Cognitive functioning
a. Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task - PASAT (Gronwall 1977;
Tombaugh 2006)
The PASAT scale is a computerised serial-addition task used to
assess rate of information, processing, sustained attention, and
working memory. Responses are recorded by a blinded assessor.
b. Conners Continuous Performance Task - CCPT (Rosvold
1956)
The CCPT is a computerised neurophysiological test assessing
attention disorders and neurological functioning. Response pat-
terns indicate, for example, inattentiveness or impulsivity, activa-
tion and arousal problems, or difficulties in maintaining vigilance.
c. Wechsler Memory Scale - WMS (Saggino 1983)
The WMS is a neurophysiological test assessing various mem-
ory functions including five index scores: auditory memory, vi-
sual memory, visual working memory, immediate memory, and
delayed memory.
d. Clinical Memory Test - CMT (Xu 1986)
The CMT is a test developed for the assessment of memory. It
consists of five subtests including directed memory, paired-associ-
ation learning, free recall of pictures, recognition of meaningless
figures, and recall of connection between portraits and their char-
acteristics.
e. Berg’s Card Sorting Test - BCST (Berg 1948; Nelson 1976)
The BCST is a neurophysiological test assessing executive func-
tions of the brain responsible for, among others, planning, cogni-
tive flexibility, abstract thinking, or initiating appropriate actions
and inhibiting inappropriate actions.
f. Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - WCST (Heaton 1993)
The WCST is a standard test measuring executive function. The
domain “correctly completed categories” (WCST-Cc) is a score
that reflects an individual’s overall level of executive functioning
andthe abilitytoutilise newinformationandpreviousexperiences.
6.5 Behaviour
Nurses’ Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation - NOSIE (
Honigfeld 1965)
The NOSIE scale is an assessment instrument for nurses designed
to assess behaviour of patients on an inpatient unit. It consists of
30 items measuring various aspects of positive behaviour (social
competence, personal neatness) and negative behaviour (e.g. ir-
ritability, manifest psychosis, depression, retardation). Items are
scored on a five-point Likert scale. Scoring was reversed in one
study (Li 2007a).
6.6 Patient satisfaction
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire - CSQ (Atkinson 1994)
The CSQ is a self-report instrument designed to measure patients’
satisfaction with care. It consists of eight items which are scored
on a four-point Likert scale.
6.7 Quality of life
6.7.1 General quality of life
a. General Well-Being Schedule - GWB (Fazio 1977)
The GWB is a self-administered questionnaire focusing on an in-
dividual’s subjective feelings of well-being and distress. The scale
covers the dimensions of anxiety, depression, general health, pos-
itive well-being, self-control and vitality.
6.7.2 Specific aspects of quality of life
b. Skalen zur psychischen Gesundheit - SPG (Tönnies 1996)
17
Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The SPG scale is a self-report instrument designed to address men-
tal health-related quality of life. It consists of 76 items each of
which is scored on a four-point Likert scale.
c. Social Support Questionnaire - SSQ (Sarason 1983)
The SSQ is a 27-item questionnaire designed to measure percep-
tions of social support and satisfaction with that social support.
Each item is a question that solicits a two-part answer: Part 1 asks
participants to list all the people that fit the description of the
question, and Part 2 asks participants to indicate how satisfied they
are, in general, with these people, on a six-point Likert scale.
6.8 Missing outcomes
In addition to symptom and functioning scales, mainly repre-
sented here, it will be important to include more “positive” out-
comes such as further quality of life measures, outcomes related
with engagement with services as well as music-related outcomes
in future studies. Such outcomes might play an important role
from a client perspective. Furthermore, studies focusing on cost-
effectiveness will be a next step when investigating music therapy.
Excluded studies
A total of 97 studies were excluded for the following reasons:
We excluded 38 studies because they were not randomised (14
CCTs, 20 case series, four single-case studies).
We excluded a further 43 studies because the intervention was not
music therapy. Twenty-one of these investigated another type of
therapy, e.g.arttherapy, movementtherapy, psychotherapy, atreat-
ment package, or medication. Twenty-two studies investigated the
effects of music interventions that did not meet the definition of
music therapy (e.g. music listening alone or Karaoke singing).
The remaining 16 studies were excluded for various reasons: We
excluded one study because information needed could not be re-
trieved from the authors. Three studies compared music therapy
with another type of therapy and we therefore excluded them.
Four studies were excluded because only some of the participants
were diagnosed with schizophrenia or related psychoses. Finally,
no adequate outcome data were reported for eight studies (see
Characteristics of excluded studies).
Awaiting assessment
There are no studies awaiting assessment.
Ongoing
We did not identify any ongoing studies.
Risk of bias in included studies
Overall, most information is from studies at low or unclear risk of
bias. A summary of the risk of bias across domains, as described
below, and for each included study is provided in Figure 2 and
Figure 3.

 Allocation
While all studies stated that participants were randomly assigned,
only 2 of them described concealment procedures. Talwar 2006
described that randomisation was concealed through a remote ran-
domisation using a central telephone. Similarly, Gold 2013 con-
ducted remote randomisation. An independent person who had
no contact with the involved clinicians and participants provided
individual allocations by e-mail or text message. In the other stud-
ies it was unclear whether randomisation was really concealed.
Blinding
Five studies were explicitly single-blind, using blinded assessment
(Ceccato 2009; Gold 2013; Talwar 2006; Tang 1994; Ulrich
2007). For the other 13 studies it was unclear whether the persons
conducting the assessments were blinded to treatment provision
(Cha 2012; Chang 2013; Fu 2013; He 2005; Li 2007a; Liu
2013; Lu 2013; Mao 2013; Mohammadi 2012; Qu 2012; Wang
2013; Wen 2005; Yang 1998). Three studies tested the success of
blinding. Gold 2013 verifiedthe successof blindingandfoundthat
only in 8% of all cases assessors became aware of the participant’s
correct allocation. Ulrich 2007 tested whether assessors were aware
of the study aim and found that they were not aware that the aim
of the study had to do with music therapy. Talwar 2006 asked
assessors to guess which group the participants were assigned to
and identified that they guessed correctly in more than 50% of
the cases. However, as this would always be the case when an
experimental treatment is effective, this cannot be taken as an
indication of unsuccessful blinding (Higgins 2008).
No study had a double-blind design as the nature of the inter-
vention does not allow to blind those who received music therapy
or those who delivered it. However, in Ulrich 2007, participants
were blinded to the fact that the study aim was the investigation
of music therapy.
Incomplete outcome data
The majority of studies had low or zero attrition rates (Analysis
1.10). All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.
Gold 2013, Lu 2013, and Ulrich 2007 reported rates of missing
data, i.e. participants who were followed up but where outcome
data were incomplete. In Gold 2013, rates of missing data at the
various outcome time points varied from 13% to 31%. Only 9%
of the participants were lost for all time points of outcome assess-
ment. The potential impact of missing data was assessed in two
sensitivity analysis. For unobserved outcomes, either no change
from the last observed value or no change from the baseline value
was assumed. No changes in the effect were found. In Lu 2013,
6% of the participants were lost for all time points of outcome
assessment. Also in this study a last observation carried forward
(LOCF) procedure was applied for 3% of the missing cases. In
Ulrich 2007, rates of missing data varied from 8% to 19% for the
different outcome variables. All other studies had complete data
for all cases that were followed up. For He 2005, the attrition rate
was not reported. According to the setting (only inpatients) and
apparent reporting standards in the Chinese trials (people leaving
early were usually reported if there were any), we assumed that all
participants had completed the trial.
Selective reporting
A published study protocol was only available for Gold 2013. In all
the other studies, all outcomes that were described in the method
section were also used for analyses. All studies reported means and
SDs of both groups before and after treatment. We performed log
transformation to remove skewness when this was present (as was
the case with one outcome - negative symptoms - in Ulrich 2007).
We considered all outcomes for all studies in the analyses.
Other potential sources of bias
1. Co-intervention (treatment contamination)
For all studies, medication was reported as standard care. Tang
1994 reported a higher drop of medication level in the music ther-
apy group than in the control group, but no significant difference
at follow-up. The other studies reported no significant differences
in medication level. Standard care available to all participants in-
cluded other therapies and activities (e.g. supportive counselling,
occupational therapy, social activities).
2. Adequate music therapy method and training
Results may be biased if the quality of music therapy (method or
training level) does not match that required in clinical practice.
The quality of the music therapy methods applied was rated as
satisfactory in most studies, although it was unclear in three (Table
1). The level of music therapy training was more uneven’ adequate
training level was ascertained only in seven of the 18 studies (Table
1).
According to the given definition of music therapy, both musical
experiences and relationships developing through them could be
identified as working mechanisms within these studies, although
the level of intensity of the client-therapist relationship might
have varied between them. For example, Ceccato 2009 used a
highly structured approach but therapists were nevertheless also
instructed to “pay attention to relational atmosphere”. The most

 prevalent modalities used were listening to music (15 studies),
playing or singing pre-composed music (13 studies), and improvi-
sation (seven studies), along with verbal discussion of the processes
(16 studies; Table 1), reflecting typical clinical practice.
Whether music therapists were adequately trained was not always
clear. Some studies(e.g. Ceccato 2009, Talwar 2006, Ulrich2007),
stated that music therapy was conducted by “qualified music thera-
pists”. Some referred to quality standards in music therapy (Ulrich
2007), or approved training courses (Talwar 2006). In other stud-
ies, the level of training was clarified through personal communi-
cation (Ceccato 2009; Yang 1998). In other studies, the level of
training was limited or unclear. For example, music therapy was
conducted by nurses and psychiatrists who had attended a mini-
mal music therapy training course (Tang 1994); “musicians who
were employed full-time as music therapists” (He 2005); or nurses
and psychiatrists whose level of training was unclear (Li 2007a;
Wen 2005).
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison
All 18 included studies are included in meta-analysis. Outcomes
are presented in the order specified in the Methods section and
according to their prespecified time frame (short, medium, or long
term). All comparisons concerned music therapy in addition to
standard care versus standard care alone. When heterogeneity was
present, we attempted to explain this via the dosage (less than 20
versus 20 or more sessions) or the adequacy of the music therapy
(well-defined versus less well-defined music therapy; see Table 1).
COMPARISON 1: MUSIC THERAPY plus standard
care versus STANDARD CARE alone
1.1 Global state
1.1.1 No clinically important overall improvement (as rated
by individual trials)
Global state (no clinically important overall improvement) was ad-
dressed as a dichotomous outcome in two randomised controlled
trials (RCTs) (Gold 2013; Yang 1998). There was no significant
short-term effect (1 RCT, n = 61, risk ratio (RR) 0.82 95% con-
fidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.24, Analysis 1.1). There was a sig-
nificant medium-term effect favouring music therapy, suggesting
that clinically important overall improvement was more likely to
occur than with standard care alone (2 RCTs, n = 133, RR 0.38
95% CI 0.24 to 0.59, NNTB 2 95% CI 2 to 4). Heterogeneity
was high (P = 0.0003, I² = 90%) and might be explained by high
attrition in Gold 2013 (10/30 > 30% in the control group; 13/61
> 20% overall), although alternative explanations might be differ-
ences in populations (the study with the smaller effect consisted
of ’low-motivation’, or treatment-refractory, patients) or dose of
therapy (the study with the smaller effect had a much smaller dose
of music therapy). Excluding the study with high attrition resulted
in stronger effects in favour of music therapy and no heterogene-
ity. In a sensitivity analysis where only complete data were used,
the effects were unchanged. In the long term, no usable data were
available (Gold 2013 had 24/61 > 30% attrition overall).
1.2 Mental state
Mental state was measured using eight continuous scales. These in-
cluded endpoint scores of general mental state (PANSS and BRPS)
as well as specific endpoint scores for negative (SANS) and posi-
tive (SAPS) symptoms of schizophrenia, depression (SDS, Ham-
D, CDSS), and anxiety (SAS).
1.2.1 General
Average endpoint general mental state scores using PANSS (high
score = poor) were used in three studies (Lu 2013; Mao 2013;
Talwar 2006). These showed significant effects in the short,
medium, and long term (short term: 1 RCT, n=75, standardised
mean difference (SMD) -0.69 95% CI -1.16 to -0.23; medium
term: 2 RCTs, n = 159, SMD -0.97 95% CI -1.31 to -0.63;
long term: 1 RCT, n = 90, SMD -3.41 95% CI -4.07 to -2.76,
Analysis 1.2). High heterogeneity at medium term might be ex-
plained by dosage (the study with the smaller effect had a much
smaller dose of music therapy; Table 1). BPRS scores (high score
= poor) were used in two studies (Wen 2005; Yang 1998). On this
scale, the overall effects were significant in favour of music therapy
at medium term (1 RCT, n = 70, SMD -1.25 95% CI -1.77 to
-0.73), but not at short term (1 RCT, n = 30, SMD 0.27 95%
CI -0.45 to 0.99) (Analysis 1.3). Across both scales and all time
points, it was notable that effects increased over time.
1.2.2 Specific - Negative symptoms
Average endpoint scores of negative symptoms (SANS, high score
= poor) were available from seven studies (Gold 2013; He 2005;
Mohammadi 2012; Qu 2012; Tang 1994; Ulrich 2007; Yang
1998). As described above, the data from Ulrich 2007 were log-
transformed to remove skew, and missing SDs for Qu 2012 were
estimated from those of the other studies using this outcome.
The overall short- and medium-term effects were significant in
favour of music therapy (short term: 5 RCTs, n = 319, SMD -
0.50 95% CI -0.73 to -0.27; medium term: 3 RCTs, n = 177,
SMD -0.55 95% CI -0.87 to -0.24). Substantial heterogeneity
between studies (short term: P=0.02, I² = 67%; medium term: P
= 0.0002, I² = 89%) was removed when excluding the study on
treatment-refractory patients (Gold 2013), and the effects at both
time points remained significant. In the long term, no usable data
were available (Gold 2013 had 22/61 > 30% attrition overall).
The effect was similar at short and medium term (Analysis 1.4).

 1.2.3 Specific - Positive symptoms
Average endpoint scores of positive symptoms (SAPS, high score =
poor) were available from one study (Mohammadi 2012). Effects
at short term were not significant (1 RCT, n = 96, SMD -0.18
95% CI -0.60 to 0.24, Analysis 1.5 ).
1.2.4 Specific - Depression, anxiety
Depression and anxiety were assessed in several studies using a va-
riety of scales. Average endpoint scores of depression (SDS, high
score = poor) were measured in two studies (Li 2007a; Wen 2005)
and showed a significant short-term effect in favour of music ther-
apy (2 RCTs, n = 90, SMD -0.63 95% CI -1.06 to -0.21, Analysis
1.6). There was no heterogeneity between the studies (P = 0.73,
I² = 0%). One of the same studies (Wen 2005), also used aver-
age endpoint depression scores using another scale (Ham-D, high
score = poor). The short-term effect from this scale was of com-
parable size but did not become statistically significant from this
small study alone (1 RCT, n = 30, SMD -0.52 95% CI -1.25 to
0.21, Analysis 1.7). Average endpoint depression scores on a third
scale (CDSS, high score = poor) in a study of well-defined music
therapy (Lu 2013) were analysed but excluded from interpretation
due to likely skewness (1 RCT, n = 75, Analysis 1.8).
Average endpoint scores of anxiety (SAS, high score = poor) were
available from one study (Li 2007a), yielding a significant short-
term effect in favour of music therapy (1 RCT, n = 60, SMD -
0.61 95% CI -1.13 to -0.09, Analysis 1.9).
1.3. Leaving the study early
Data on leaving the study early were available for all 18 stud-
ies, but events occurred only in three (Gold 2013; Talwar 2006;
Yang 1998). There were no significant differences on this out-
come (short term: 11 RCTs, n = 692, RR 0.14 95% CI 0.02 to
1.06; medium term: 8 RCTs, n = 531, RR 0.62 95% CI 0.30 to
1.30; long term: 2 RCTs, n = 151, RR 0.97 95% CI 0.50 to 1.89,
Analysis 1.10).
1.4. Functioning
1.4.1 General functioning
General functioning was measured in two studies of low-dose mu-
sic therapy (Gold 2013; Talwar 2006) using GAF scores (high
score = good). No significant effects were found for the short term
or medium term (short term: 1 RCT, n = 53, SMD 0.08 95% CI
-0.47 to 0.62; medium term: 2 RCTs, n = 118, SMD -0.19 95%
CI -0.56 to 0.18, Analysis 1.11 ). In the long term, no usable data
were available (Gold 2013 had 22/61 > 30% attrition overall).
One study of ’high-dose’ music therapy (Mao 2013) used IADL
scores (high score = poor), with results showing significant effects
favouring music therapy both in the medium term (1 RCT, n =
90, SMD -1.20 95% CI -1.65 to -0.75) and in the long term (1
RCT, n = 90, SMD -1.80 95% CI -2.29 to -1.30, Analysis 1.12).
1.4.2 Social functioning
Average endpoint scores of social functioning (SDSS, high score =
poor) was used in three studies (Fu 2013; Mao 2013; Yang 1998).
Significant effects favouring music therapy were found in the short
term (1 RCT, n = 40, SMD -1.25 95% CI -1.94 to -0.57), medium
term (2 RCTs, n = 160, SMD -0.72 95% CI -1.04 to -0.40), and
long term (1 RCT, n = 90, SMD -0.56 95% CI -0.98 to -0.14,
Analysis 1.13).
No usable data were available for social functioning scores using
IPROS. As this scale was only used in Qu 2012 and only scores of
subscales were reported therein, we were not able to impute SDs
for a total score from other studies and hence were not able to
include this outcome measure in the analysis.
1.4.3 Cognitive functioning
Various aspects of cognitive functioning (attention/vigilance,
memory, and abstract thinking) were addressed in three studies
(Ceccato 2009; Cha 2012; Liu 2013).
Average endpoint scores of attention (PASAT, high score = good)
showed a significant medium-term effect favouring music therapy
(1 RCT, n = 67, SMD 0.72 95% CI 0.22 to 1.21, P = 0.005,
Analysis 1.14). However, CCPT scores measuring vigilance and
attention (high score = good) in the same study, also at medium
term, did not show a significant effect (1 RCT, n = 67, SMD 0.25
95% CI -0.23 to 0.74, Analysis 1.15).
At medium term, average endpoint scores of memory (WMS, high
score = good) were not significant (1 RCT, n = 67, SMD 0.43
95% CI -0.06 to 0.92, Analysis 1.16 ). Average endpoint scores
of memory (CMT, high score = good) showed significant short-
term effects favouring music therapy (1 RCT, n = 60, SMD 0.58
95% CI 0.06 to 1.09, Analysis 1.17).
Average endpoint scores of abstract thinking (BCST, high score =
good) were not significant at medium term (1 RCT, n = 67, SMD
0.09 95% CI -0.39 to 0.58, Analysis 1.18). Average endpoint
scores of abstract thinking (WCST-Cc, high score = good) showed
no effects at short term (2 RCTs, n = 90, SMD -0.02 95% CI -
0.07 to 0.03), but significant effects favouring music therapy at
medium term (1 RCT, n = 30, SMD 1.18 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03,
Analysis 1.19).
1.5 Behaviour
Average endpoint scores of behaviour (NOSIE total score, high
score = good; individual study data were reversed where necessary)
were used in two studies, however data from both studies were not
interpretable due to likely skewness (2 RCTs, n = 100, Analysis
1.20). Average change scores of behaviour of the same outcome
22
Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)

 (NOSIE total score, high score = good) were used in one ’high-
dose’ study (Wang 2013), showing a significant medium-term ef-
fect favouring music therapy (1 RCT, n = 62, SMD 0.69 95% CI
0.18 to 1.20, Analysis 1.21).
1.6 Recipient of care satisfaction
Satisfaction with care was assessed using CSQ scores (high score
= good) in one low-dose study (12 sessions, Talwar 2006) of well-
defined music therapy. No significant effect was found (1 RCT, n
= 69, SMD 0.32 95% CI -0.16 to 0.80, Analysis 1.22).
1.7 Quality of life
1.7.1 General
In a ’high-dose’ study (Chang 2013), GWB scores (high score =
good) showed a significant effect (1 RCT, n = 72, SMD 1.82 95%
CI 1.27 to 2.38, Analysis 1.23).
1.7.2 Specific
Average endpoint scores of mental health-related quality of life
were available from two short-term studies. In one low-dose study
(Ulrich 2007), SPG scores (high score = good) did not show a
significant effect (1 RCT, n = 31, SMD 0.05 95% CI -0.66 to
0.75, Analysis 1.24). Specific aspects of quality of life (social sup-
port; SSQ, high score = good) were assessed in a ’high-dose’ study
(Chang 2013) and showed a significant effect favouring music
therapy (1 RCT, n = 72, SMD 0.73 95% CI 0.26 to 1.21, Analysis
1.25).

Summary of main results
COMPARISON 1: MUSIC THERAPY plus standard
care versus STANDARD CARE alone
1. Global state
Although there are data from only two studies, these results suggest
thatmusictherapyhasastrongeffectonglobal state in the medium
term (three to six months). The number needed to treat for an
additional beneficial outcome is small (total n = 133, NNTB 2
95% CI 2 to 4). These results seem to be mediated by the number
of sessions. This is an important result that should be replicated.
2. Mental state
Mental state was measured considering symptom scores of general
mental state (PANSS, BPRS), negative symptoms (SANS), pos-
itive symptoms (SAPS), depression (SDS, Ham-D) and anxiety
(SAS). Significant results were found on five of the seven scales.
Effects tended to increase over time and were clearly seen in the
medium term (three to six months). According to Cohen’s guide-
lines (Cohen 1988), music therapy showed large effects (stan-
dardised mean difference (SMD) > 0.80) on general mental state
(PANSS: total n = 159, SMD -0.97 95% confidence interval (CI)
-1.31 to -0.63; BPRS: total n = 70, SMD -1.25 95% CI -1.77 to
-0.73) and medium-sized effects (SMD 0.50) on negative symp-
toms (SANS: total n = 177, SMD -0.55 95% CI -0.87 to -0.24).
Short-termeffectsof mediumsize were seenfornegative symptoms
(total n = 319, SMD -0.50 95% CI -0.73 to -0.27). For other
aspects of mental state (general mental state, positive symptoms,
depression, and anxiety), interpretation was complicated by the
use of different scales. Some scales were used only in a single small
study. Differences between the results may also reflect differences
in the number of sessions or differences in the quality of the music
therapy applied (music therapy method and training).
Data on long-term effects were available from one study and were
strongly in favour of music therapy (total n = 90, SMD -3.41 95%
CI -4.07 to -2.76). This is a very large effect size using general
guidelines for the interpretation of intervention effects in the social
sciences (Cohen 1988).
It clearly takes time for the effects of music therapy to unfold. This
can be seen not only from the tendency of effects to increase over
time, but also from examining the numbers of sessions provided
in each of the studies. The strongest effects were found in studies
that provided long-term, high-frequency music therapy (Table
1). This is in line with another review that specifically focused
on the dose-effect relation in music therapy (Gold 2009). Music
as a medium of therapy addresses issues related to emotion and
social interaction and is described as motivating. Therefore, it
has been speculated earlier (e.g. Mössler 2011b) that it may be
particularly well-suited to the treatment of negative symptoms,
which are related to problems in that area (affective flattening and
bluntness, poor social interaction and a general lack of interest).
However, the present review update suggests that effects on general
mental state are at least as strong as those on negative symptoms.
In summary, large effects of music therapy were found for general
symptoms and negative symptoms. The effect sizes for general
symptoms in the medium and long term, corresponding to a 9- to
12-point difference on the PANSS scale, were large by common
standards (Cohen 1988). They were also much larger than those
found in a recent systematic review of cognitive behaviour therapy
(Jauhar 2015).
3. Leaving the study early
23
Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)

 There were no differences concerning the outcome of leaving the
study early. Both treatment conditions seemed to be well-tolerated
- few people left either group.
4. Functioning
Functioning was measured in terms of three different aspects: gen-
eral, social and cognitive functioning.
Effects on general functioning were significant and large for ’high-
dose’ music therapy, both in the medium term (SMD -1.20 95%
CI -1.65 to -0.75) and in the long term (SMD -1.80 95% CI -
2.29 to -1.30). In contrast, low-dose music therapy (less than 20
sessions) did not affect general functioning (short term: SMD 0.08
95% CI -0.47 to 0.62; medium term: SMD -0.19 95% CI -0.56
to 0.18).
Effects on social functioning were in favour of music therapy in
the short, medium, and long term, with effect sizes ranging from
medium to large. Results for cognitive functioning were mixed,
with some scales suggesting benefit and others suggesting no effect.
Overall, it seems that music therapy can affect social functioning
more quickly than general functioning. This appears plausible,
given the focus of especially active music therapy on social inter-
action. General functioning may be harder to change. Effects of
music therapy on general functioning require more sessions and
more time, but can then be large (SMD > 0.80) using Cohen’s
guidelines (Cohen 1988). This is again in line with a previous sys-
tematic review that found increasing effects on functioning with
dose of music therapy (Gold 2009).
5. Behaviour
Usable data on behaviour were limited, but suggested large effects
of high-dose music therapy in the medium term, similar to mental
state and functioning.
6. Satisfaction with care
No effects on patient satisfaction with care could be identified.
Data were to sparse to make any conclusions.
7. Quality of life
Quality of life (short to medium term) showed a similar pattern
as other outcomes above, with high-dose music therapy showing
beneficial effects with large effect sizes, but low-dose music therapy
showing no such effects.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
1. Music therapy techniques
All studies used a combination of typical music therapeutic tech-
niques: active music-making (often improvisation, but also songs)
and music listening. Verbal discussion and reflection emerging
from, and connected to, the musical processes was described for all
studies. The techniques of clinical music therapy were, therefore,
relatively well represented.
2. Setting
In comparison to previous versions of this review, the time span
of music therapy has expanded and now covers not only short-
term, but also medium-term music therapy (from one up to six
months). However, the majority of studies investigated music ther-
apy in hospital settings, including primarily inpatients (in both
acute and longer-term wards) and some outpatients (in two stud-
ies). Therefore, direct applicability of the evidence is restricted to
hospital settings. Clinical music therapy is commonly provided in
such settings, but longer-term individual and group music therapy
with outpatients, also outside hospital settings, is also common.
In terms of numbers of sessions, studies covered a broad range
(from less than 10 to more than 200), which reflects the variety
of clinical settings well. Interesting variations were found in the
frequency of sessions: one to two sessions per week were common
in Europe and Western Asia, whereas twice-weekly to daily or even
twice-daily sessions were provided in East Asia. All studies were
conducted in Europe, Asia or Australia.
3. Outcomes
The outcomes of included studies mainly reflect symptom and
functioning scales assessing the patient’s deficits. Recently, “posi-
tive” outcomes (such as quality of life, but also for example, music-
related outcomes) have been considered as well. However, there
is not yet an agreement as to which outcome measures are to be
preferred for those domains. This meant that we had to exclude
some outcomes and even whole studies that may have been in-
teresting (Gold 2013; Grocke 2014; Silverman 2009; Silverman
2014a; Silverman 2016). Agreement on outcomes that link more
closely to processes and mechanisms of music therapy has not been
reached. However, this appears to be a widespread and persistent
problem in schizophrenia trials more generally (Miyar 2012).
Quality of the evidence
The included trials were of moderate quality, so at moderate risk
of bias. All studies stated explicitly that randomisation was used,
but concealment of allocation was unclear in most studies. There
was no indication of unintended co-intervention. In some studies
(e.g. Talwar 2006), however, it was reported that some participants
received less sessions than planned, which may have lowered the
observed effects. Attrition rates were relatively low. All analyses
were intention-to-treat. Blinding of assessment was reported in
24
Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 only a minority of studies. The adequacy of the music therapeutic
approach is reflected satisfactorily by the applied music therapeutic
techniques for most studies. However, the training level of music
therapists was unclear in about half of the included studies. The
clinical heterogeneity in music therapy may indicate the use of
sensitivity analyses using random-effects models; while this was
not included in the protocol for the present version of this review,
it will be considered in future updates.
Potential biases in the review process
The extensive search strategy that was undertaken for this review
might make it seem likely that all relevant studies were identified.
Norestrictionsconcerningnationalityorlanguage have beenmade
within the search process. Non-English articles were included in
the review and relevant articles were translated into English. Fur-
thermore, dealing with data was done thoroughly and we con-
tacted authors of relevant studies when data were insufficient.
There is, however, the possibility that our interest in this area (see
Declarations of interest) or past knowledge of the literature (Gold
2005a) could have resulted in a biased view of the data. We think
it would be hard to avoid some degree of similar risks of bias in
the reviewing process.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The findings of this review are in agreement with a review of ran-
domised and observational studies on music therapy for serious
mental disorders (Gold 2009). That review confirmed and quan-
tified the relationship between the number of sessions and the size
of the effect of music therapy. Using meta-regression, the review
found that a large proportion of the variance in effects (73% to
78%) was explained by the number of sessions or its square root.
A clear dose-effect relationship strengthens the knowledge about
the effects of music therapy (Higgins 2011), and might contribute
to a better use of mental health resources. In contrast to that other
review which drew on a broader basis and larger number of studies,
meta-regression was not considered appropriate for the present re-
view due to the small number of studies included (Higgins 2011).

Implications for practice
1. For people with schizophrenia
There is evidence that music therapy, as an addition to standard
care, can help people with schizophrenia improve their global state,
mental state (general negative, depressive and anxiety symptoms),
functioning (general and social), and quality of life over the short
to medium term. Music therapy seems to address especially moti-
vational, emotional and relational aspects, and helps patients im-
prove regarding their social activities and roles. However, the ef-
fects of music therapy seem to depend on the number of music
therapy sessions. To benefit from music therapy, it is important
to participate in regular sessions over some time. The minimum
number of sessions is difficult to determine and will probably vary
from patient to patient.
2. For clinicians
Music therapy, as an addition to standard care, does seem to help
across a wide range of measures - at least over the short to medium
term. Those positive effects might help support the motivation
as well as emotional and relational competencies of people with
schizophrenia. However, these effects seem to depend on the num-
ber of music therapy sessions provided, as well as on the quality
of the therapy. The results of this review suggest that at least 20
sessions may be needed to reach clinically significant effects. This
is consistent with the significant dose-effect relationships found
in Gold 2009. That review demonstrated that medium effects of
music therapy on general and negative symptoms as well as func-
tioning occur between 16 and 24 sessions. The specific techniques
of music therapy, including among others adaptation of musical
material to clients’ needs, musical improvisation, and the discus-
sion of personal topics emerging through the musical processes,
require specialised music therapy training. Both training courses
and qualified music therapists are available in many countries, but
in some countries there may be a need to develop better quality
training. Music therapy may be especially important for improv-
ing negative symptoms such as affective flattening and blunting,
poor social relationships, and a general loss of interest and motiva-
tion. These domains may be specifically related to music therapy’s
strengths, but do not typically respond well to other treatment.
3. For managers/policy makers
There is a considerable amount of evidence to support music ther-
apy for people with schizophrenia. We think that music therapy
should be more widely available and that there is an evidence-base
to underpin this.
Implications for research
1. General
Generally, there is room for improvement concerning the qual-
ity of reporting of trials in this area, and future research reports
should make use of guidelines such as the CONSORT statement
(Boutron 2008; Moher 2010). Replication studies are especially
25

 neededforoutcomeswhere onlyone ortworandomisedcontrolled
trials (RCTs) were available (e.g. global state).
2. Specific
2.1 Additional reviews
Out of necessity the search strategy for this review was broad. It
revealed other music-based interventions such as music listening
that could be relevant to review. This type of music-based in-
tervention does not qualify as music therapy, but might play an
important role in particular settings or cultures. Further reviews
might also address music therapy compared with other psychoso-
cial interventions (see Table 2).
2.2 Trials
Specific areas where research is particularly needed are long-term
effects,dose-effectrelationship, andmusictherapyoutside hospital
settings. Furthermore, pragmatic trials assessing music therapy in
routine use,withinachangingcontextof mental health care, would
be valuable. A suggestion for such a trial is shown in Table 3.
2.2.1 Dosage
Even though significant dose-response relationships could be
demonstrated in another review (Gold 2009), studies randomis-
ing high versus low dosage of music therapy (i.e. high versus low
numbers of therapy sessions) would be required to quantify and
confirm the knowledge that has been gained so far. Such studies
would require considerably larger sample sizes than those repre-
sented in this study because the expected effect sizes between two
active treatments will be smaller than between music therapy as
an add-on treatment and standard care alone.
2.2.2 Duration
Long-term effects extending over more than six months have re-
ceived limited attention in previous trials, and research on long-
term effects are especially necessary as schizophrenia is often a
chronic condition. This may include trials of long-term music
therapy as well as long-term follow-up assessments of short- or
medium-term music therapy.
2.2.3 Core outcomes
There are currently no agreed core outcome sets for schizophrenia
interventions in general (www.comet-initiative.org) or for music
therapy specifically. More co-ordinated research is needed to iden-
tify what outcomes matter most to patients and other stakehold-
ers. In this review, most outcomes were based on scales (such as
BRPS, PANSS, SANS), which were developed primarily for re-
search rather than clinical purposes. Although some scales (e.g.
GAF) are also commonly used in clinical practice, it may be ar-
gued that the most important real-world outcomes (such as being
able to work, living independently, not being readmitted to hos-
pital, maintaining positive relationships with significant others)
are not based on scales. It may also be argued - and, as we under-
stand, has been the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s view for a
long time - that the most meaningful outcomes are binary rather
than continuous. In contrast to this view, recent understanding
of schizophrenia as a spectrum disorder (APA 2013) also lends
support to a notion where the condition as well as its outcomes
can be described as continuous. There are also statistical consider-
ations linked to choosing continuous versus binary data; analysing
means, as we did for most outcomes, retains a maximum of infor-
mation and therefore maximum power, but depends on a number
of assumptions (as described in Methods, 2.1 Scale-derived data).
Conversely, analysing binary cut-off values is more robust, but has
less power, and necessitates a choice of cut-off. Studies often vary
in their definition of a clinically meaningful cut-off. In conclusion,
instead of further diversification of outcome measures, scales, and
cut-offs used in studies, efforts should be directed at identifying a
small set of meaningful and important core outcomes, ideally in
a broad consensus involving researchers, patients and other stake-
holders.

The authors would like to acknowledge the help of the following
people in the development of this review: Kris Bentley helped
as co-author of the original protocol (Gold 2003); Trond Dahle
as co-author of the first full review (Gold 2005a); Tony Wigram
(deceased) helped with both versions (Gold 2003; Gold 2005a).
The editorial team of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group helped
atall stages, butespeciallyindevelopingthe protocol andretrieving
study reports. Jun Xia helped with translating study reports for
the present update from Chinese. Claire Ghetti provided valuable
comments on an earlier draft of this review. We would also like to
thank Daniel Cardoso and Genevieve Gariepy for peer reviewing
this version of the review.
The Cochrane Schizophrenia group now provide a template for
the methods section and other parts of the protocol. We have used
this template and adapted it accordingly.

Adequate music therapeutic method: A “yes” indicates that the method applied considered both musical experiences and relational
aspects as dynamic forces of change in music therapy. A “no” indicates that relational aspects are missing.
Adequate music therapy training: A “yes” indicates that the persons conducting the music therapy have attended an appropriate music
therapy training. A “no” indicates that the person conducting the music therapy had limited or even no music therapy training.

 Table 3. Suggestions for design of future studies
Methods
Allocation: randomised (could be cluster-randomised), with sequence generation and concealment of allocation
clearly described.
Blindness: assessor-blinded, success of blinding tested.
Duration: at least 12 months from randomisation.
Participants
People with schizophrenia.*
Age: any.
Sex: both.
History: any.
N = 300 (more if cluster-randomised).**
Interventions
1. Music therapy delivered by qualified music therapist. N = 150.
2. Standard care (stratified by medication status). N = 150.
Outcomes
General state: relapse.
Service outcomes: length of hospitalisation, number of hospital admissions.
Time in work/vocational activity.
General functioning (e.g. using GAF).
Mental state (e.g. using PANSS).
Well-being.
Quality of life (e.g. using EuroQol EQ-5D).
Adverse events: any.
Compliance with/use of services offered.
Economic evaluations: cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit.
Qualitative data: interviews with service users about their experience with the treatment package
Notes
* This could be diagnosed by clinical decision. If funds were permitting all participants could be screened using
operational criteria, otherwise a random sample should suffice.** Size of study with sufficient power to highlight
about a 10% difference between groups for primary outcome (depending on baseline risk)..
*** Primary outcome. The same applies to the measure of primary outcome as for diagnosis. Not everyone may need
to have operational criteria applied if clinical impression is proved to be accurate

Appendix 1. Previous searches
1. 2010 search
1. Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2010)
We searched the register using the phrase:
[(*musi* or *improvis* in title, abstract, index terms of REFERENCE)] or [(music* in interventions of STUDY)]
This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings (see Group Module).
The previous version of the review (Gold 2005a) used a slightly different search strategy:
{[* musi* or musi* or * sound* or sound* or * acou* or acou* or gim in title, abstract, index terms of REFERENCE] or [music* in
interventions of STUDY]}
However, the search terms sound* and acou* were dropped in this 2011 update as they only appeared to increase the number of false
positives and did not help to identify any music therapy trials.
2. Handsearching
We searched the three American music therapy journals (Journal of Music Therapy, Music Therapy and Music Therapy Perspectives) as
reissued on CD Rom by the American Music Therapy Association using the search term random* and then manually browsing through
the results. The search covered the Journal of Music Therapy (1964-1998), Music Therapy (1981-1996) and Music Therapy Perspectives
(1982-1984, 1986-1998).
3. Reference searching
We also inspected the references of all identified studies, included or excluded, for more studies.
4. Personal contact
We contacted the contact authors of relevant reviews or studies to enquire about other sources of relevant information.
5. Review articles
We inspected existing review articles pertinent to the topic of this review (Oerter2001; Silverman 2003b) for references to any additional
studies.
6. Cited reference search (forward search)
We searched ISI Web of Science for articles citing any of the included studies, in order to identify any more recent studies that might
have been missed.

 Appendix 2. Previous data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Three review authors independently inspected the citations identified from the search. Potentially relevant abstracts were identified and
full papers ordered and reassessed for inclusion and methodological quality. Any disagreement was discussed and reported.
Data extraction and management
Two revew authors independently extracted data and, where further clarification was needed, contacted the authors of trials to provide
missing information.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors, again working independently allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2008). When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated resolution was
attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary, data were not entered into the analyses
and the study was allocated to the list of those awaiting assessment. Only trials in Category A (adequate) or B (unclear) were included
in the review.
Measures of treatment effect
1. Binary data
For binary outcomes, a standard estimation of the fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The
number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated. If heterogeneity was found (see under Assessment of heterogeneity), the
following possible sources of heterogeneity were examined: i. treatment dosage (20 sessions or more versus less than 20 sessions); and
ii. treatment approach (quality of music therapy method and training).
2. Continuous data
2.1 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying
parametric tests to non-parametric data the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: ( a) standard deviations (
SDs) and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; ( b) when a scale started from a finite number ( such
as zero), the SD, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean ( as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure
of the centre of the distribution ( Altman 1996)). Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and endpoint and this rule can be
applied to them.
2.2 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes a SMD between groups was estimated using a fixed-effect model. Again, if heterogeneity
was found (see under Assessment of heterogeneity) possible sources of heterogeneity were examined.
2.3 Valid scales: continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed
journal and the instrument was either a self-report or completed by an independent rater or relative ( not the therapist). Unpublished
instruments are more likely to report statistically significant findings than those that have been peer reviewed and published ( Marshall
2000).
2.4 Endpoint versus change data: where possible endpoint data were presented and if both endpoint and change data were available
for the same outcomes then only the former were reported in this review.

Studies may employ ’cluster randomisation’ ( such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data
poses problems: Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a ’unit of analysis’ error ( Divine
1992) where P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals ( CI) unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated causing
type I errors ( Bland 1997; Gulliford 1999). Although no cluster trials were identified for this review, the planned procedure for analysis
would have been as follows. Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented the data in a table,

 with an ( *) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. We would have attempted to contact first authors of
studies to seek intra-class correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using the ’design effect’ ( Gulliford 1999;
Higgins 2008). If the intra-class correlation was not available, we would have used an external estimate from similar studies ( Higgins
2008).
Dealing with missing data
We excluded data from studies where more than 30% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up (this did not include the
outcome of ’leaving the study early’). In studies with less than 30% dropout rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the
negative outcome for dichotomous outcomes, except for the event of death. We analysed the impact of including studies with high
attrition rates (20% to 30%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group did result in a substantive change in the
estimate of effect, these data were not added to trials with less attrition but presented separately.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. Then we visually inspected graphs
to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented, primarily, by employing the I2 statistic. This provides
an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance. Where the I2 estimate was greater than or equal to 75%,
this was interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity ( Higgins 2003). If it was not possible to explain this heterogeneity by i.
number of sessions (20 sessions or more versus less than 20 sessions) or ii. treatment approach (quality of music therapy method and
training), a random-effects model was used to describe and account for this unexplained heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
We entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph ( trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood
of overt publication bias ( Davey 1997).
Data synthesis
Authors entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for music therapy
when the outcome was negative (where “high” means “poor”), and reversed for positive outcomes (where “high” means “good”).
Sensitivity analysis
We would have analysed the effect of including studies with high attrition rates in a sensitivity analysis, but no such studies were
identified in this review.

No differences between the protocol and the 2005 publication.
In the 2011 update (2010 search), clarifications have been added concerning the definition of the intervention and methods of analysis.
In the 2015 version, the layout and numbering of outcomes has been changed for consistency across sections of the review, now a
MECIR standard for Cochrane reviews, the type of outcomes remains the same.
