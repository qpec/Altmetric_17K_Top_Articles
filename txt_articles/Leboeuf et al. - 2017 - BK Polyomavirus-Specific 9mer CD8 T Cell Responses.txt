BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) causes premature kidney
transplant (KT) failure in 1–15% of patients. Because
antivirals are lacking, most programs screen for
BKPyV-viremia and, if positive, reduce immunosup-
pression. To evaluate the relationship of viremia and
BKPyV-specific
immunity,
we
examined
prospec-
tively cryopreserved plasma and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells at the time of transplantation (T0)
and at 6 mo (T6) and 12 mo (T12) after transplant
from 28 viremic KT patients and 68 nonviremic con-
trols matched for the transplantation period. BKPyV
IgG seroprevalence was comparable between cases
(89.3%) and controls (91.2%; p = 0.8635), but cases
had lower antibody levels (p = 0.022) at T0. Antibody
levels increased at T6 and T12 but were not corre-
lated with viremia clearance. BKPyV-specific T cell
responses to pools of overlapping 15mers (15mer
peptide
pool
[15mP])
or
immunodominant
CD8
9mers (9mer peptide pool [9mP]) from the early viral
gene region were not different between cases and
controls at T0; however, clearance of viremia was
associated
with
stronger
9mP
responses
at
T6
(p = 0.042)
and
T12
(p = 0.048),
whereas
15mP
responses were not informative (T6 p = 0.359; T12
p = 0.856). BKPyV-specific T cells could be expanded
in vitro from all patients after transplant, permitting
identification of 78 immunodominant 9mer epitopes
including 50 new ones across different HLA class I.
Thus, 9mP-responses may be a novel marker of
reconstituting CD8 T cell function that warrants fur-
ther study as a complement of plasma BKPyV loads
for guiding immunosuppression reduction.

 Introduction
In the past decade, BK polyomavirus (BKPyV)–associated
nephropathy has emerged as a significant complication in
kidney transplant (KT), causing premature graft failure in
1–15% of patients (1,2). Notably, BKPyV seems rather
benign in immunocompetent people, infecting >90% of
the general population during early childhood without ill
effects and persisting asymptomatically thereafter in the
renourinary tract with low-level urinary shedding (3,4).
Following KT, however, 20–40% of patients develop
high-level viruria, and 10–20% progress to BKPyV vire-
mia, which closely mirrors the onset and resolution of
histologically proven nephropathy (5–9). Several risk fac-
tors for BKPyV replication have been reported in KT
patients including older age and male gender of recipi-
ents, high donor and low recipient antibody levels, higher
number of HLA mismatches, higher corticosteroid expo-
sure, and acute rejection episodes, as well as tacrolimus-
based immunosuppressive regimens (2,10–13). However,
their relative importance for BKPyV replication is still diffi-
cult to predict in the individual constellation of recipient
immunity, donor graft properties, and immunosuppres-
sion (14). In clinical practice, BKPyV viremia is regarded
as a net result of the extremely rapid viral replication
(15)
and functional BKPyV-specific immune responses
(16–18). In the absence of antiviral drugs, most transplant
programs screen KT patients for BKPyV viremia and, if
positive,
preemptively
reduce
immunosuppression.
Although interventional clinical trials are lacking, this
approach is widely recommended (14,19,20) based on vir-
emia clearance rates of 80–100% in dedicated prospec-
tive
cohort
studies
(8,17,21,22);
however,
allograft
rejection is seen in 0–14% of patients (8,17,20,22,23).
Consequently,
improved
strategies
and
markers
are
warranted that complement viremia dynamics for better
guidance of immunosuppression reduction.
Cellular immunity has been suggested to be crucial for
the control of BKPyV replication and has been explored in
KT
patients
using
overlapping
15mer
peptide
pools
(15mPs) for stimulating interferon c (IFN-c) release assays
(16–18). BKPyV-specific T cell responses in blood, how-
ever, are generally much lower than, for instance, cyto-
megalovirus-specific
T
cells
(24,25)
but
significantly
increase
in
KT
patients
clearing
BKPyV
viremia
(16,17,26,27). Although BKPyV-specific CD8 T cells are
thought to be central to cytotoxic control of virus-infected
host cells (28–30), previous studies focused on overlap-
ping 15mer pools, which elicit functional responses in
CD4 and to a lesser extent in CD8 T cells (16,17,28). In
fact, BKPyV-specific CD8 T cells and their epitopes are lit-
tle studied and, if so, are typically restricted to HLA-
A*0201 (31–33). We focused on immunodominant 9mer
epitopes encoded in the BKPyV early viral gene region
(EVGR) encoding the viral small T antigen (sTag) and large
T antigen (LTag) (34,35) that are able to elicit defined CD8
T cell responses across a wide range of different HLA
types in healthy individuals and pediatric KT patients (36).
The 9mer-specific CD8 T cells had been further character-
ized using HLA multimers, carboxyfluorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester proliferation, CD107a degranulation,
and chromium 51–release killing assays (36). We exam-
ined BKPyV-specific antibody as well as cellular immune
responses using overlapping 15mer and immunodomi-
nant 9mer pools in a case-control study of 96 KT patients
consisting of 28 viremic cases and 68 nonviremic controls
participating in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS).
Patients and Methods
Study design
This study has been conducted within the framework of the multicenter
STCS (project number FUP056), supported by the Swiss National Science
Foundation, the Swiss University Hospitals (G15), and Swiss transplant
centers (Basel, Bern, St. Gallen, Lausanne, Geneva, and Zurich). Signed
written informed consent and sample collection forms were obtained
from all patients included, as approved by the local institutional review
board and the STCS committee. Prospective biobanking of participating
patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma was
conducted at the time of transplantation (T0) as well as 6 mo (T6) and 12
mo (T12) after transplantation by the participating study centers. Antibody
and T cell responses were determined at all three time points in all
BKPyV-viremic KT patients and compared with two nonviremic control
patients using a case-control cohort approach.
Patient identification and study population
Adult KT patients (aged ≥18 years) were identified in the STCS database
as of July 1, 2014, if they had received a first kidney transplant at the
University Hospital of Basel between May 1, 2008, and December 31,
2013, to permit follow-up of at least 18 mo. All patients gave informed
consent to participate in the STCS and had PBMCs and plasma samples
cryopreserved at the time of transplantation (T0). Patients were excluded
if they underwent retransplantation or additional nonkidney solid organ
transplantation or had primary nonfunction of the renal allograft. Screen-
ing for BK virus replication was done according to a standard protocol
described previously (8), consisting of urine cytology for decoy cells every
2 weeks until month 3 and then at 6 and 12 mo and yearly thereafter. KT
patients with positive decoy cells were tested for plasma BKPyV loads by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction at the next visit, as
described (8). KT patients were allocated to cases if at least one plasma
BKPyV load ≥500 copies/mL was detected within the first 12 mo after
transplant. Of a total of 217 KT patients in the database, 33 were identi-
fied as BKPyV viremic. Controls were defined as nonviremic if plasma
BKPyV load was undetectable within the first 18 mo after transplant. Per
one viremic patient, two nonviremic patients transplanted within the
same time period (2008–2009, 2010–2011, 2012) were randomly identi-
fied as controls (n = 66) using frequency matching. Patient chart and lab-
oratory review resulted in exclusion of five cases because of a missing
sample (n = 1) and incorrect data (n = 4), two of which had to be reclas-
sified as controls. Thus, the final study group consisted of 96 KT patients,
28 as BKPyV viremic cases and 68 as nonviremic controls. The patient
characteristics regarding age, gender, donor and recipient HLA, immuno-
suppressive regimen, and some viremia history were obtained from the
STCS database (Table 1). Additional information such as immunosuppres-
sion dosing, trough levels, and serum creatinine concentration were
obtained from the local patient flowchart.

 Virus serology and DNA load
The BKPyV loads were determined as described previously (5), with the
modifications outlined (37). BKPyV and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) IgG anti-
body levels were determined in plasma samples obtained at T0, T6, and
T12 by a normalized ELISA using viral capsid protein 1 (Vp1) virus-like par-
ticles, as described (38).
Direct ex vivo T cell responses to BKPyV
BKPyV-specific T cell responses against the EVGR epitopes were mea-
sured using viable cells per well obtained after thawing prospectively cry-
opreserved PBMCs by IFN-c enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay
(16,36). Briefly, 288 PBMC samples were thawed, and viable cells (mean
viability at 6 h was 87% � 19%) were counted and seeded, as described
below (36). Peptide pools of 180 15mers overlapping by 11 amino acids
spanning the entire BKPyV EVGR (15mP) (16) or of 97 predicted immun-
odominant 9mers (9mer peptide pool [9mP]) at 1 lg/ mL (Eurogentec,
Belgium) (36) or medium only for a negative control were used to assess
he IFN-c production in duplicates of 250 000 PBMCs per microtiter well.
Phytohemagglutinin-L
(2 mg/
mL;
Hoffmann-La
Roche
Ltd.,
Basel,
Switzerland) was used as the positive control on 50 000 cells per well,
yielding between 300 and 500 spot forming units (SFUs) per well, to
avoid spot saturation per well. All tests were performed in duplicates
SFUs were enumerated by an ImmunoSpot analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH,
Bonn, Germany) and averaged. Spot counts of the negative control were
multiplied by two to define the cutoff, and ELISpot results above the cut-
off were considered positive and expressed per million PBMCs to display
specific responses.
In vitro expansion of virus-specific T cells
Virus-specific T cells were expanded by seeding 3 million viable PBMCs
into 1.5 mL medium in 24-well plates pulsed with BKPyV EVGR 15mP
(200 ng/ mL). Cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 in RPMI supple-
mented with 5% human serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 14 days. At day 7, half of
the medium was replaced and cultures were restimulated with the
15mP. Recombinant IL-2 (20 U/mL; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and IL-7
(5 ng/ mL; PeproTech) was provided at days 3 and 10. At day 14 after
expansion, the cells were washed, and an IFN-c ELISpot was performed
using 15mP and 9mP, as described. If sufficient cells were available, cells
were available, restimulation was performed with 9mer-subpools sub-
pools for 9mer epitope response mapping by cross-identification in
checkerboards, whereby each of the 97 9mers were present in two dif-
ferent unique subpools, as described in detail by Cioni et al in fig-
ure 3B (36).
Statistical analysis
The chi-square test was used for categorical variables, and the Kruskall–
Wallis, Wilcoxon, and Mann–Whitney U tests and analysis of variance
were used for multiple comparisons, as indicated. Two-sided p-values of
<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
In total, 96 adult KT patients were identified who partici-
pated in the STCS and were transplanted in Basel before
December 31, 2013, permitting follow-up of at least
18 mo. The study encompassed 28 viremic cases and
68 nonviremic control patients matched for the same
transplant period (Table 1). Approximately half of the
patients had received living donor grafts, and 12%
were ABO-incompatible. Three or more HLA mismatches
were present in 75% of the transplants. Basiliximab was
administered for induction, but approximately one-fifth
of the patients required depleting antibodies such as
anti–thymocyte globulin or rituximab. All patients received
maintenance
immunosuppression
with
tacrolimus–
mycophenolate
combinations.
Although
controls
were
matched solely for the time of transplantation, there were
no significant differences between viremic cases and non-
viremic controls
for any of the
baseline parameters
(Table 1). Notably, BKPyV viremia onset and duration
among cases varied during the first year after transplanta-
tion such that different groups could be distinguished rela-
tive
to
the
time
points
of
plasma
and
PBMC
cryopreservation at T6 and T12 (Figure 1).
BKPyV-specific IgG was determined at T0 using a nor-
malized ELISA, as detailed recently (38). The seropreva-
lence of cases and controls was 89.3% and 91.2%,
respectively,
and
was
not
significantly
different
(p = 0.8635). BKPyV IgG levels at T0, however, were
lower in patients who later developed viremia compared
with the non-viremic patients (p = 0.0220) (Figure 2A).
JCPyV seroprevalence was not significantly different
between
cases
and
controls
(89.3%
vs.
89.7%;
p = 0.9411), and no significant difference in JCPyV IgG
levels could be observed (Figure 2B).
The lower BKPyV antibody levels among cases at T0
were not caused by inability to mount stronger IgG
responses, since significant increases could be observed

BKPyV 9mer T Cells in Viremia Clearance
 at T6 and T12 after transplant despite maintenance
immuosuppression (p < 0.0001) (Figure 2C), as reported
previously (27,39). By comparison, the average BKPyV
IgG levels did not change in nonviremic KT patients from
T0 to T6 and T12 (p = 0.7884) (Figure 2C). Thus, BKPyV-
specific antibodies indicated not only past exposure to
BKPyV but also significant recent exposure after trans-
plant, as seen in BKPyV viremic patients.
To investigate the role of antibodies and clearance of
BKPyV viremia, we compared BKPyV IgG levels in cases
having cleared viremia with those having ongoing viremia
at T6 (n = 11 in group 1 vs. patients with ongoing viremia
groups 2 and 3, n = 11; see Figure 1), and at T12 (groups
1, 2, and 4 vs. groups 3 and 5; see Figure 1). However,
no
significant
differences
in
antibody
levels
were
detected (Figure 2C), indicating that antibody expansion
was not significantly associated with viremia clearance.
To
investigate
the
BKPyV-specific
cellular
immunity,
cryopreserved PBMCs from all patients were tested by
IFN-c ELISpot assay after stimulation with standard over-
lapping 15mPs covering the entire BKPyV LTag (16) or
with a 9mP containing 97 immunodominant 9mer EVGR
peptides (36). Because comparative data on 15mer- ver-
sus 9mer-stimulated IFN-c ELISpot assay are not avail-
able, we noted that the overall responses to 9mP were
of equal magnitude to 15mP responses, indicating that
the shorter length and lower complexity of the 9mP did
not result in a principally reduced response (data not
shown).
At T0, no significant differences in between KT patients
becoming viremic and their matched nonviremic controls
could be detected by either 15mP or 9mP stimulation
(p = 0.1496 and p = 0.5703, respectively). In viremic
patients,
however,
a
significant
expansion
of
9mP
responses was observed at T6 and T12 (p = 0.0005) (Fig-
ure 3A blue dots, left panel), which was not observed
in the 15mP responses (p = 0.2760) (Figure 3A blue
dots, left panel). In nonviremic KT patients, no significant
changes in 15mP or 9mP T cell responses were seen
(p = 0.4992 and p = 0.906, respectively) (Figure 3A yel-
low dots, right panel). The data indicated that 9mP
responses showed significant expansion dynamics in
viremic patients that were not detectable in nonviremic
controls. In contrast, 15mP responses did not reveal sim-
ilar timing or magnitude.
To investigate the role of T cell responses as indicators
of clearance of BKPyV viremia, we compared 9mP and
15mP responses in cases having cleared viremia with
those having ongoing viremia. At T6, 9mP responses
were
significantly
higher
in
patients
having
cleared
viremia (group 1) compared with patients with ongoing
viremia (groups 2 and 3) (Figure 3B), whereas the corre-
sponding 15mP responses showed no significant differ-
ences. At T12, patients having cleared viremia (groups 1,
2, and 4), had significantly higher 9mP responses than
patients with ongoing viremia (groups 3 and 5) (Fig-
ure 3C). In contrast, no significant difference was seen
in 15mP responses between patients having cleared vire-
mia and those with ongoing viremia.
Although the small sample size precluded more exten-
sive analyses, a receiver operating characteristic curve
analysis of 9mP responses predicting clearance of vire-
mia yielded an area under the curve of 0.712 (p = 0.013),
whereas 15mP responses were not significant at 0.606
(p = 0.214) (Figure S1).
Because low or missing ELISpot responses could be due
to immunosuppressive drugs or complete lack of BKPyV-
specific T cells (24), we investigated the in vitro expan-
sion of PBMCs following 15mP stimulation and testing
for 15mP and 9mP IFN-c ELISpots, as described previ-
ously (16). With few exceptions, a substantial increase in
respective IFN-c responses was seen in both viremic and
nonviremic patients at almost all time points (p < 0.0001)
(Figure 4A). The results indicated that BKPyV-specific
CD8 T cells were present in most patients at the respec-
tive time points and suggested that in vivo expansion
could be readily expected in patients if immunosuppres-
sion was relaxed.
To investigate the specificity of the expanded 9mP
responses,
the
97
immunodominant
9mers
were
assessed in a checkerboard analysis. Sufficient cell num-
bers were available for a complete checkerboard of 147
(51%) of the 288 time points (T0, T6, and T12) of the 96
KT patients (62 from the 28 viremic KT patients and 85
from 66 nonviremic controls), yielding 136 (92.5%) posi-
tive
9mer
responses.

 carried the HLA class I type predicted to present the cor-
responding 9mer, but a few 9mers were not confirmed
(Figure 4B). Schematic alignment of the EVGR open
reading frame encoding the LTag and the common
domain of the sTag (Figure 4C) revealed that most 9mer
responses were located in clusters, as expected from
the prediction for immunodominant responses (36). Inter-
estingly, several 9mers not eliciting responses were also
located in clusters residing in parts of the p53-binding
domains of the LTag (Figure 4C).
Discussion
The persisting challenge of BKPyV in KT patients is cur-
rently addressed by regular posttransplant screening for
BKPyV viremia and preemptive reduction of immunosup-
pression (14,19,20). Despite preferential manifestation
during the first year after transplant, actual onset and
duration of BKPyV viremia is highly variable in individual
patients (5) (Figure 1). To better understand the virus–
immune dynamics in KT patients, we conducted a case-
control study of 96 adult KT patients participating in the
STCS,
from whom
prospectively collected data and
biobanking at T0, T6, and T12 were available (40). Our
results demonstrate, for the first time, that a pool of
immunodominant 9mers from the BKPyV EVGR elicits
IFN-c ELISpot responses in adult KT patients and pro-
vides
functional
information
that
differs
from
15mP
responses in both dynamics and magnitude. Indeed, the
9mP responses showed significant increases in BKPyV
viremic patients at T6 and T12 that were not seen in
nonviremic control patients. Importantly, higher 9mP
CD8 T cell responses were associated with clearance of
viremia at both T6 and T12.
We also investigated BKPyV-specific antibody responses
and found significant increases at T6 and T12 in viremic
cases that were not observed in nonviremic controls;
however, unlike the 9mP CD8 T cell responses, the
BKPyV-specific antibody levels were not correlated with
clearance of viremia. These observations suggest that
BKPyV-specific antibodies are mainly a marker of past
and recent viral exposure, as has been reported in great
detail previously (27,39,41). This interpretation is also
supported in a prospective study of pediatric KT patients,
demonstrating that increasing BKPyV antibody levels
occurred early in patients with rising viremia before
immunosuppression was reduced and prior to mounting
of significant T cell immune responses (17). The notion
that T cell effector functions are key to the control of
BKPyV replication has been reviewed recently (28) and is
well illustrated by cases with recurrence of initially
cleared BKPyV viremia in which the reconstituted IFN-c
BKPyV-specific T cell responses disappeared despite per-
sistently increased high antibody levels (see also Figure 1
in Comoli et al [41]). Given the conserved nature of the
LTag between BKPyV and JCPyV, it is important to note
that the JCPyV IgG levels were not different between
patients groups at T0, suggesting that cross-reacting
JCPyV-specific T cell immunity (16,36) was not a major
confounder in our study.
Recently, Schmidt et al (42) observed that higher BKPyV
IgG levels were associated with stronger BKPyV-specific
CD4 T cell activity in 15 postviremic adult KT patients
compared with 24 nonviremic adult KT patients, using
overlapping 15mPs covering the LTag and the Vp1 epi-
topes. Our present study of 96 KT patients focused on
overlapping 15mers covering EVGR-encoded LTag and
sTag epitopes, thereby deliberately avoiding the promi-
nent CD4 T cell responses to the Vp1 capsid epitopes.
Indeed, in a study of 42 adult KT patients tested before
and after clearing BKPyV viremia, Binggeli et al (16)
demonstrated that Vp1-specific IFN-c responses were
significantly stronger than the LTag-induced responses
and contained a larger proportion of CD4 T cells, whereas
the opposite was seen for LTag-specific responses having
a higher CD8 T cell proportion (16). This observation was
independently confirmed in pediatric and adult KT patients
(17,18). Recently, CD8 T cell responses to LTag or Vp1
have received more attention in exploratory concept stud-
ies (32,33), but translation and clinical utility still need to
be addressed. The difference between 9mer and 15mer
responses in KT patients also need further study, but con-
ceptually and shown by using MHC class I streptamers
(36), 9mers are presented in an MHC class I context and
recognized by CD8 T cells. Instead, 15mers bind to MHC
class II–detecting CD4 T cells and, to a lesser extent, to
MHC class I–stimulating CD8 T cells (16,17). Another
potential factor is the change in 9mer responses over
time and relative to viremia; these changes need further
study to clarify the expansion and contraction dynamics
of CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood of KT patients.
We also showed that T cell responses to BKPyV EVGR
9mP and 15mP are expandable in vitro in most viremic
and nonviremic patients at the different time points, even
though not detectable by direct testing in some instances.
The expanded T cells may be important for the develop-
ment of novel strategies aiming to boost BKPyV-specific T
cell responses in KT patients and suggest the possibility
of exploring autologous adoptive T cell therapy with
respect to both CD4 and CD8 T cell effectors. However,
the “net state of immunosuppression” will remain a
major obstacle even after adoptive T cell transfer, due to
the need for a window period of reduced immunosup-
pression with its inherent risks.
To characterize the specificity of the expanded T cells, we
tested the 97 individual 9mers of the 9mP in a checker-
board analysis. Complete results were obtained in 136 of
147 expansions (92.5%) with sufficient cell numbers after
2 weeks to identify 78 individual 9mers, including 50 novel
ones. With few exceptions, the responses were found in
patients having the HLA type predicted to present these

Leboeuf et al
 immunodominant BKPyV 9mers. Interestingly, 17 of the
predicted 9mers had not been identified repeatedly, even
though the HLA types are not particularly rare in our popu-
lation. However, several of the nonresponding peptides
clustered in domains of the p53-binding region of the
BKPyV LTag. This observation is intriguing and suggests
the testable hypothesis that certain epitopes predicted to
be immunodominant may be underrecognized because of
tolerizing clonal deletion resulting from high similarity/
identity with the hosts’ self antigens. Conversely, this
may also help to identify 9mer epitopes that are associ-
ated with better viremia clearance.
Even though this study is one the largest of KT patients
combining BKPyV loads and specific humoral and cellular
immunity in a proper case-control design of prospectively
collected cohort information and specimens (40), the
availability of 3 time points (T0, T6, and T12) must be
acknowledged as a limitation for fine mapping. Moreover,
some patients seemed to have delayed viremia clearance,
suggesting that other, as yet undefined factors play a
role. We conclude, however, that the data are encourag-
ing and warrant follow-up with fine mapping of the type
and role of antibody and T cell responses at critical time
points of reduced immunosuppression and may permit a
randomized controlled interventional trial for ultimate clini-
cal evidence. Such a trial should address the testable
hypothesis that a strong 9mer response in a patient clear-
ing or having cleared viremia does not need further reduc-
tion in immunosuppression. Another important question
would be whether or not immunosuppression could be
safely reincreased in such patients. Although the present
ELISpot format is convenient for the clinical situation,
more sophisticated assays would be needed to research
details on the role of characterizing T cell cytokine pro-
files, polyfunctionality, and activation/differentiation mark-
ers (28). Regardless, our results on immunodominant
9mP responses raise significant interest in CD8 T cell
dynamics and complement other recent studies limited to
HLA-A0201 restricted responses (32,33).
In conclusion, we provide evidence that 9mP responses
may be a novel dynamic marker of reconstituting CD8 T
cell function across a range of common HLA types that
is directly testable in peripheral blood and thus warrants
further studies exploring whether 9mP responses permit
complementation of plasma BKPyV load results in guid-
ing immunosuppression reduction.
