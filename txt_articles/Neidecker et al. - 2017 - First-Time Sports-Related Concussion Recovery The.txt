Background: Concussion is one of the most common injuries in athletes. Current
concussion consensus statements propose that female sex may be a modifying
factor in concussion management and recovery.
Objective: To determine whether female athletes in middle school and high school
with a first-time, sports-related concussion remained symptomatic longer than their
male counterparts.
Methods: A retrospective medical record analysis was performed among athletes
who sustained a concussion between 2011 and 2013. Inclusion criteria consisted of
age between 11 and 18 years and diagnosis of first-time concussion sustained while
playing organized sports. Using the documented notes in the medical record, length
of time that each athlete was symptomatic from his or her concussion was calculated.
Results: A total of 110 male and 102 female athletes (N=212) met the eligibility cri-
teria for the study. A significant difference was found in the median number of days
female athletes remained symptomatic (28 days) when compared with male athletes
(11 days) (P<.001). No statistically significant difference was found in symptom
duration between age groups. When matched for sex, no statistically significant dif-
ferences were found in symptom duration between the type of sports played.
Conclusion: Female athletes aged 11 to 18 years with first-time, sports-related con-
cussions remained symptomatic for a longer period when compared with male ath-
letes of similar age, regardless of sport played. The mechanism behind this
difference needs to be further elucidated.

oncussions represent almost 9% of all injuries in high school athletics.1,2 Since
2001, emergency department visits for sports-related concussions among chil-
dren and adolescents increased by 60%, possibly reflecting the increased
number of participants, increased incidences of sports-related concussions, or increased
concussion awareness.1
Certain studies propose that female athletes are at greater risk for concussion than their
male counterparts.1,3-6 Newer published consensus statements suggest that female sex
may be a modifying factor in concussion recovery.5,6 Most early studies state that the
majority (80%-90%) of concussions resolve in a 7- to 10-day period.5,7-10 Nonetheless,
the majority of these initial studies involved male collegiate or professional athletes.

 Concussion in Sport held in Zurich in November 2012
“accepted that sex may be a risk factor for injury and/
or influence injury severity” but did not list female sex
as a possible modifier in the management of concus-
sions because there was no “unanimous agreement that
the current published research evidence is conclusive.”5
The most recent consensus statement on concussion
issued
by
the
5th
International
Conference
on
Concussion in Sport in October 2016 went on to state
that “there is some evidence that the teenage years, par-
ticularly the high-school years, might be the most vul-
nerable time period to have persistent symptoms—
with greater risk for girls than boys.”6 They reported
“that a sizeable minority of youth, high school and col-
legiate athletes take much longer than 10 days to clinic-
ally recover and return to sport.”6
The purpose of the current study was to determine
whether a sex difference exists in the resolution of
symptoms
in
first-time
sports-related
concussion
among middle school and high school athletes.
Methods
Design
We conducted a retrospective medical record analysis of
athletes who sustained a concussion between 2011 and
2013 and were seen at a single sports medicine practice
in southern New Jersey. Athletes were seen by 1 of 3
primary care physicians (including J.M.N. and D.B.G.)
with a Certificate of Added Qualifications in sports
medicine. This study was deemed exempt by the
Cooper University Hospital Institutional Review Board.
Criteria
Inclusion criteria consisted of middle school and high
school athletes who sustained a first-time concussion
while playing organized sports. Athletes who sustained
a concomitant injury with concussion (eg, nasal frac-
ture, intracranial bleed) were excluded from the study.
Athletes who sustained a concussion outside of orga-
nized sports (eg, gym class, backyard play, motor
vehicle accident) were excluded from the study.
Athletes lost to follow-up or with incomplete forms
were also excluded.
Collected Data
The intake forms for all 3 physicians were identical with
regard to initial evaluation of athletes presenting with
concussion. The following data were recorded: demo-
graphic information (age, sex, and sport); presence of
loss of consciousness and retrograde or anterograde
amnesia as assessed during the initial office visit;
medical history of migraines/frequent headaches, learning
disability, visual problems, or mental illness; and
postinjury total ImPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion
Assessment and Cognitive Testing; ImPACT Applications,
Inc) symptom score using the 7-point Likert symptom
scale (Figure 1). Each of the 22 items is rated on a scale
of 0 (not present) to 6 (severe). The length of time that
each athlete was symptomatic was calculated using the
documented medical record information from follow-up
office visits. The criterion for resolution of symptoms
was documentation that the athlete returned to baseline
symptoms (before concussion). Owing to an inconsist-
ency of baseline ImPACT symptom scores, baseline
levels were determined through patient self-reporting.
Data Analysis
All statistical tests were performed using SPSS (IBM).
Independent t tests were used to compare the mean age
between the sexes, and the Mann Whitney U test was
used to compare the ranks of asymptomatic days and
ImPACT score. Medians were evaluated rather than
means for asymptomatic days and ImPACT score
because the data were not normally distributed and
assessing the means would skew the results. χ2 tests
were used to compare the type of sport, presence of
amnesia, and loss of consciousness between the sexes.
P values <.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Of 549 medical records reviewed, 212 athletes (110
male and 102 female) met the inclusion criteria.

 History of previous concussion and concussion sus-
tained outside of organized sports were the most
common reasons for exclusion from the study.
Comparisons by sex are reported in Table 1. Within
the sex groups, no significant difference was found in
mean age (male, 14.8 years, vs female, 14.5 years;
P=.3). No statistically significant difference was found
in the presence of retrograde amnesia between the
sexes. However, a statistically significant difference
was found between sexes regarding associated loss of
consciousness and anterograde amnesia. Male athletes
had a higher incidence of both loss of consciousness
and anterograde amnesia compared with female
athletes. No statistically significant difference was
found in history of learning disability or visual pro-
blems between male and female athletes before injury.
Female athletes had a significantly greater incidence of
preinjury history of migraines/frequent headaches com-
pared with male athletes (13.8% vs 3.6%, respectively;
P=.005). No significant difference was found in prein-
jury history of mental illness between male and female
athletes (0.9% vs 4.6%, respectively; P=.08). Initial
median postinjury ImPACT symptom scores were
similar between male and female athletes (14 vs 17,
respectively; P=.589). This similar initial median
symptom score suggests that there was no difference in
initial concussion severity between the sexes.

 A significant difference was found between males
and females in duration of symptoms (median, 11 days
vs 28 days, respectively; P<.001). Our data revealed
that 82 of 110 male athletes (75%) experienced recov-
ery of concussion symptoms by 3 weeks compared
with 43 of 102 female athletes (42%) (Figure 2).
When comparing middle school and high school ath-
letes, no statistically significant differences were found
in length of reported symptoms between age groups
(Table 2). When matched for sex, no statistically signifi-
cant differences were found between sports played and
athletes’ resolution of concussion symptoms (Figure 3).
Discussion
Multiple review articles involving sports-related con-
cussion call for more research regarding sex and its
role in the recovery from concussion.4,5,11-13 The
current study seems to be the first to suggest a statistic-
ally significant difference in length of recovery between
male and female athletes in middle school and high
school with first-time, sports-related concussions.
A preponderance of current literature states that 80%
to 90% of sports-related concussion symptoms resolve
in 7 to 10 days.5-10 However, many of these studies
involved male collegiate or professional football
players. A 2014 study looking at patients with an
average age of 14.3 years showed concussion symp-
toms to last a median of 13 days.14 However, this
study did not evaluate data by sex, and its sample was
57.4% male. Kadyan et al15 found no differences
between sexes in duration or frequency of symptoms;

 patients with traumatic brain injury in an acute rehabili-
tation setting with a mean age of 35 years, whereas the
present study involved patients aged 11 to 18 years. In a
retrospective medical record review, Cantu et al16 found
no differences in recovery from concussion between
sexes. The average age of the participants in that study
was approximately 19 years. The current study’s find-
ings that male and female athletes reported symptoms
for a median of 11 and 28 days, respectively, are in
agreement with the most recent consensus statement
from the 5th International Conference on Concussion
in Sport: “[T]he large majority of injured athletes
recover, from a clinical perspective, within the first
month of injury.”6
In another retrospective medical record review,
Kostyun and Hafeez17 showed that adolescent female
athletes had a longer recovery course than adolescent
male athletes (75.6 [73.0] and 49.7 [62.0] days, respect-
ively [P=.002]) and required more interventions after
concussion. The only major difference between their
study and the current study was that we focused on first-
time concussion, whereas Kostyun and Hafeez17
included athletes with a history of multiple concus-
sions. Also, we looked at medians instead of means

 because of the skewing effect of outliers. These differ-
ences could explain the longer recovery reported in
their sample compared with ours.
To our knowledge, no definitive research has pro-
vided an explanation for sex differences in concussion
recovery. We think that these differences are complex
and
multifactorial,
including
biomechanical
and
biological
differences
between
the
sexes.11,18-20
Biomechanically, females may be at higher risk for
concussions because their necks are smaller and do not
absorb shock as well as the necks of males. One study
of collegiate soccer players found that females had 26%
less total mass in their head and neck, and displayed
significantly greater head-neck segment peak angular
acceleration and displacement.18 Biologically, it has
also been suggested that females have a greater basal
rate of glucose metabolism.19 Broshek et al20 suggested
that as a result of increased demands for glucose after a
concussion, female athletes might exhibit prolonged
impairments compared with male athletes because
females have a greater basal rate of glucose metabolism.
The prevalence of other medical conditions, such as
migraines and mood disorders, in men and women
may also potentially explain differences in concussion
recovery.21-23 Migraine is more than twice as common
in females than in males, and females experience more
frequent, longer-lasting, and more painful attacks.21 In
addition, history of migraine has been associated with
prolonged
concussion
recovery.6,22
Our
research
showed a statistically significant difference in preinjury
history of migraine/frequent headaches in females com-
pared with males. However, we found no statistically
significant difference between females with a history
vs those without a history of migraines/frequent head-
aches in median time being symptomatic after concus-
sion (26 days vs 28 days, respectively; P=.806). The
lack of a significant difference may have been because
physicians adjust their management of concussion
based on an athlete’s medical history.
After puberty, females experience major depression
at roughly twice the rate of males.23 The lifetime preva-
lence of generalized anxiety disorder is also higher in
females than in males (6.6% vs 3.6%, respectively),24
and females may have greater anxiety sensitivity than
males.25 A recent consensus statement6 indicates that
such psychological factors may increase concussion
symptom recovery and contribute to risk of persistent
symptoms of concussion.
Mental stress could certainly play a role in concussion
recovery, and adolescent girls may have higher levels of
stress than boys.28,29 The effects of stress include head-
ache, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, difficulty sleep-
ing, and difficulty concentrating. These effects are also
concussion symptoms and thus could potentially
account for a longer recovery in females with concussion.
Children, adolescents, and young adults with a
history of headache disorder or mental health problems
seem to be at greater risk of having concussion symp-
toms for more than 1 month.6 We theorize that it is a
possibility that some first-time concussions in adoles-
cent athletes with persistent symptoms are due to pre-
existing
medical
conditions
or
psychosocial
complications, regardless of sex. In other words, it is
possible that the concussion has resolved and the “per-
sistent concussion symptoms” could possibly be better
attributed to another medical condition or psychosocial
dysfunction. The most recent consensus statement6 on
concussion in sport goes on to state that, “‘Persistent
symptoms’ does not reflect a single pathophysiological
entity, but describes a constellation of non-specific
posttraumatic symptoms that may be linked to coexist-
ing and/or confounding factors, which do not necessar-
ily reflect ongoing physiological injury to the brain.”
Considering medical history is often dependent on the
patient self-reporting, it is certainly possible that the
current study contained an incomplete dataset with
respect to preinjury diagnoses. Psychosocial problems
can also be ambiguous and difficult for physicians to
assess if not conveyed by patients.
When matched for sex, the current study found no
statistically significant difference in length of recovery
when comparing sports. The incidence was highest in
football players for males and soccer players for
females, consistent with preexisting data.1,2

 Little concussion research has been performed in
children younger than 13 years.6 We found no signifi-
cant difference in length of recovery between middle
school athletes (aged 11-13 years) and high school ath-
letes (aged 14-18 years). Interestingly, although not
statistically significant, we found the middle school ath-
letes recovered more quickly than the high school ath-
letes. Lee et al30 found no statistically significant
difference in symptom presence after a sports-related
concussion when comparing 92 high school athletes
with 92 collegiate athletes matched for sex and
number of previous concussions. Conversely, a study
by Zuckerman et al31 showed that adolescents aged 13
to 16 years took longer to return to their neurocognitive
and symptom baselines than adults aged 18 to 22
years.31 The findings of Cantu et al16 suggest that parti-
cipants aged 18 years or older are more likely to report
symptoms that last longer than 90 days than participants
younger than 18 years.16 The most recent consensus
statement recognizes that pediatric populations in
general take more time to recover from a concussion
than adults, and they recommend that the diagnosis of
“concussion with persistent symptoms” not be used in
children until symptoms have been present for longer
than 4 weeks.6 Further research needs to be done when
it comes to concussion recovery and age, considering
the present conflicting data and lack of data on persons
younger than 13 years.
Limitations
This study took place at a southern New Jersey sports
medicine practice with expertise in sports-related con-
cussion. This type of specialization possibly encourages
referral of more difficult concussion cases, biasing the
data to longer periods of being symptomatic. However,
because of the New Jersey state law passed in 2011,
this selection bias is partially mitigated. According to
this law, “A student-athlete who is removed from com-
petition or practice shall not participate in further sports
activity until he/she is evaluated by a physician or other
licensed health care provider trained in the evaluation
and management of concussions.”32 The New Jersey
law further clarifies that only a physician (osteopathic
or allopathic) may clear an individual with a concussion,
including one who recovers quickly, to return to play.32
Because of the nature of a retrospective medical record
review, the timeline for scheduling initial postinjury
concussion evaluations could not be standardized, nor
could follow-up appointments. The appointment sched-
uling variable was not constant and may have altered the
true length of recovery.
Another limitation of this study lies within the diag-
nosis of concussion. That physicians must rely on
patients to self-report their symptoms adds a subjective
nature to the condition. This subjectivity can interfere
with the monitoring and assessment of a patient’s con-
cussion, thereby altering the dataset. This limitation is
a concern with most concussion research.
Future concussion research will be helpful in providing
health care professionals more knowledge regarding the
role of sex and recovery. Prospective studies that allow
for more uniformity in follow-up could be helpful.
Future research and development on concussion bio-
markers and advanced imaging could also help
provide more objectivity in true length of concussion
recovery.
Conclusion
Current research states that the majority of adolescents
with concussions recover within 4 weeks.6 The findings
of the current study suggest that with first-time sports-
related concussions in middle school and high school
athletes, female athletes remain symptomatic longer
when compared with male athletes, regardless of the
sport played. The reason for this sex difference is
complex and probably multifactorial in nature.
