ore than 400 000 out-of-hospital car-
diac arrests occur annually in North 
America.1,2 Despite considerable effort 
to improve resuscitation care, survival to hospital 
discharge in most communities remains below 
10%.2 Rapid defibrillation and high-quality 
cardio 
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are essen-
tial for survival, with an absolute decrease in sur-
vival of 7% to 10% for each 1-minute delay to 
defibrillation.3–5 
Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in 
the number of people living in high-rise buildings 
(e.g., a 13% relative increase in Toronto from 
2006 to 20116,7). As more high-rise buildings are 
constructed in urban centres across Canada, the 
number of 911 calls for emergency medical ser-
vices in high-rise buildings will also continue to 
increase. Furthermore, over 40% of homeowners 
over the age of 65 years reside in high-rise build-
ings.8 These older residents have higher risks for a 
number of serious medical conditions, including 
cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrests that occur in high-
rise buildings pose unique challenges for 911- 
initiated first responders. Building access issues, 
elevator delays and extended distance from the 
location of the responding vehicle on scene to the 
patient can all contribute to longer times to patient 
contact and, ultimately, longer times to initiation 
of resuscitation. Previous research has shown that 
longer 911 response times result in decreased 
patient survival after cardiac arrest,9,10 but 
response times are traditionally measured from 
the time a call is received by the 911 dispatch 
centre to when the response vehicle arrives on 
scene. This meas 
ure fails to take into account the 
time required for 911-initiated first responders to

Background: The increasing number of 
people living in high-rise buildings presents 
unique challenges to care and may cause 
delays for 911-initiated first responders 
(including paramedics and fire department 
personnel) responding to calls for out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest. We examined the 
relation between floor of patient contact 
and survival after cardiac arrest in residential 
buildings. 
Methods: We conducted a retrospective 
observational study using data from the 
Toronto Regional RescuNet Epistry database 
for the period January 2007 to December 
2012. We included all adult patients (≥ 18 yr) 
with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of no 
ob 
vious cause who were treated in private 
residences. We excluded cardiac arrests wit-
nessed by 911-initiated first responders and 
those with an obvious cause. We used multi-
variable logistic regression to determine the 
effect on survival of the floor of patient con-
tact, with adjustment for standard Utstein 
variables.
Results: During the study period, 7842 cases of 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest met the inclusion 
criteria, of which 5998 (76.5%) occurred below 
the third floor and 1844 (23.5%) occurred on 
the third floor or higher. Survival was greater 
on the lower floors (4.2% v. 2.6%, p = 0.002). 
Lower adjusted survival to hospital discharge 
was independently associated with higher 
floor of patient contact, older age, male sex 
and longer 911 response time. In an analysis by 
floor, survival was 0.9% above floor 16 (i.e., 
below the 1% threshold for futility), and there 
were no survivors above the 25th floor.
Interpretation: In high-rise buildings, the sur-
vival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
was lower for patients residing on higher 
floors. Interventions aimed at shortening 
response times to treatment of cardiac arrest in 
high-rise buildings may increase survival.

make patient contact once they arrive on scene. 
This interval can contribute substantial delays to 
patient treatment, in some cases more than 4 min-
utes, and can account for up to 28% of the total 
time from the 911 call to arrival of the first 
responders at the patient’s side.11–14
There is a lack of literature describing the 
delay to patient contact during out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrests in high-rise buildings, where time-
sensitive, life-saving interventions matter most. 
Furthermore, the effect on survival of vertical 
delay to patient contact is unknown. As the num-
ber of high-rise buildings continues to increase 
and as population density rises in major urban 
centres, is important to determine the effect of 
delays to patient care in high-rise buildings on 
survival after cardiac arrest and to examine 
potential barriers to patient care in this setting. 
The primary objective of this study was to 
compare the rate of survival to hospital discharge 
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at different 
vertical heights in residential buildings, specific-
ally higher floors (≥ 3 floors) relative to lower 
floors (< 3 floors), with adjustment for standard 
Utstein variables.15
The secondary objectives were to determine 
the delay to patient contact by 911-initiated first 
responders for cardiac arrests occurring on 
higher floors and to examine the use of auto-
mated external defibrillators by bystanders in 
private residences. 
Methods
Design and setting
For this retrospective, observational study, we used 
data from the Toronto Regional RescuNet Epistry 
database, which is based upon data definitions set 
out by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium 
Epistry — Cardiac Arrest16 and the Strategies for 
Post Arrest Resuscitation Care Network17 data-
bases. Briefly, the Toronto Regional RescuNet Epi-
stry database is a prospective, population-based 
registry of consecutive out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrests attended by 911-initiated first responders in 
urban and rural regions of southern Ontario, which 
together have a population of more than 6.6 million 
residents. Data are collected from a network of 
7 land-based emergency medical services agencies, 
local fire departments, the provincial air ambulance 
service and 44 participating destination hospitals. 
Trained data guardians enter epidemiologic data 
from standardized prehospital call reports and in-
hospital records into secured databases. The 
research ethics board at the lead institution (St. 
Michael’s Hospital, Toronto) has provided ethics 
approval for all retrospective studies related to the 
Toronto Regional RescuNet Epistry database. 
Study population
We included all consecutively treated adults 
(≥ 18 yr) with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of no 
obvious cause (such as drug overdose, drowning 
or trauma) and therefore presumed to be of car-
diac origin that occurred between Jan. 1, 2007, 
and Dec. 31, 2012, within the City of Toronto and 
the Regional Municipality of Peel. These regions 
were selected because of their high population 
density (> 1000/km2).6,18 We excluded cardiac 
arrests witnessed by 911-initiated first responders, 
those of a traumatic nature or with another 
ob 
vious cause, and those that occurred in a health 
care setting or public location. We obtained loca-
tion classifications from prehospital ambulance 
call reports. Private locations were defined as 
apartments, condominiums, houses or town-
houses. All other locations were considered pub-
lic. Locations classified as “other” on the ambu-
lance call report were considered unknown and 
were excluded from the analysis. The third floor 
was selected as the cutoff for vertical height, 
as this data point is currently captured on 
government-approved ambulance call reports. In 
this study, 911-initiated first responders consisted 
of both paramedics and fire department personnel, 
and 911 response time was measured from the 
time a call was received by the 911 dispatcher until 
arrival on scene of a response vehicle (either 
ambulance or fire department vehicle).
Statistical analysis
We calculated baseline descriptive statistics for 
all variables of interest. Continuous variables 
were summarized as median and interquartile 
range or mean and standard deviation, as appro-
priate, and categorical variables were expressed 
as counts and percentages. We conducted bivari-
able analyses to determine differences for each 
variable of interest in terms of floor of patient 
contact, as well as differences between survivors 
and nonsurvivors. We used the t test or Wil-
coxon rank-sum test, as appropriate, for continu-
ous variables, and the χ2 test for categorical vari-
ables. We calculated the difference in survival 
by floor of contact using a χ2 test. We performed 
a subgroup analysis based on whether the car-
diac arrest occurred in an apartment or in a 
house or townhouse. We also performed an 
analy 
sis by floor of the pick-up address (rather 
than categorized as below versus at or above the 
third floor). For all analyses, a p value less than 
0.05 was considered statistically significant. We 
used multivariable logistic regression to deter-
mine independent associations between the verti-
cal height of patient contact (< floor 3 v. 
≥ floor 3) and survival to hospital discharge, 
with adjustment for standard Utstein variables

(age, sex, private or public location, shockable or 
nonshockable initial rhythm, 911 response time, 
witness status and bystander CPR).15 We also 
conducted a post hoc analysis to examine the 
effect of vertical height on the outcome of return 
of spontaneous circulation. The results of the 
multivariable logistic regression models are 
reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses 
were conducted with R software, version 3.0.2 
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Results
A total of 12 960 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests 
were treated by 911-initiated first responders dur-
ing the study period, of which 8216 occurred in 
private residences and were included in the study. 
Of these, 5998 (73.0%) occurred below the third 
floor, 1844 (22.4%) occurred at or above the third 
floor, and 374 (4.6%) were excluded because the 
floor number was missing (Figure 1). Overall, 
there was a 20% relative increase in the annual 
rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in private 
residences across the study period.  
Significant differences in event characteristics 
were noted between cardiac arrests that occurred 
on higher floors and those that occurred on lower 
floors (Table 1). In general, cardiac arrests that 
occurred on the third floor or above were less 
likely to involve a male patient and were less 
often witnessed by bystanders, and an initial 
shockable rhythm was less often present. There 
was also a longer delay from the time of arrival 
of 911-initiated first responders on scene to 
patient contact on the higher floors (4.9 ± 
2.6 min v. 3.0 ± 2.0 min; p = 0.01).

CMAJ, April 5, 2016, 188(6) 
Overall, 3.8% (300/7842) of the patients sur-
vived to hospital discharge. A total of 252 
(4.2%) of the 5998 patients with cardiac arrest 
below the third floor survived, compared with 48 
(2.6%) of the 1844 patients on the third floor or 
above (p = 0.002). In the subgroup analysis 
based on building type, there were 2363 patients 
living in apartment buildings and 5479 living in 
houses or townhouses. Of the apartment dwell-
ers, 35 (5.2%) of 667 whose cardiac arrest 
occurred below the third floor and 46 (2.7%) of 
1696 with cardiac arrest on the third floor or 
higher survived (p = 0.004). Among those dwell-
ing in houses or townhouses, 217 (4.1%) of 5331 
whose cardiac arrest occurred below the third 
floor and 2 (1.4%) of 148 with cardiac arrest on 
the third floor or higher survived (p = 0.1). 
The unadjusted analysis showed that, com-
pared with nonsurvivors, those who survived to 
hospital discharge were on average younger, 
their cardiac arrest had more often been wit-
nessed by bystanders, the rate of bystander CPR 
was higher, and they were more likely to present 
in an initial shockable rhythm. Survivors also 
had shorter 911 response times to arrival on 
scene and shorter times from arrival on scene to 
patient contact (Table 2). 
The multivariable regression analysis, with 
adjustment for the effects of Utstein variables, 
showed that cardiac arrest on higher floors 
(≥ floor 3) was independently associated with 
lower survival to hospital discharge (OR 0.70, 
95% CI 0.50–0.99). Older age (OR 0.96, 95% CI 
0.95–0.97), male sex (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–
0.95) and longer 911 response times (OR 0.86, 
95% CI 0.79–0.92) were also associated with 
lower rates of survival. Patients presenting with 
an initial shockable rhythm (OR 10.68, 95% CI 
7.98–14.29) and bystander witness of the cardiac 
arrest (OR 2.93, 95% CI 2.16–3.98) were associ-
ated with higher rates of survival to discharge, 
whereas performance of CPR by a bystander was 
not associated with survival (OR 1.07, 95% CI 
0.83–1.39) (Table 2).
In the analysis by individual floor of the pick-
up address, the spread of data was from floor 1 
to floor 48 (median 2). The survival rate above 
floor 16 was 0.9% (2/216), and there were no 
survivors above floor 25 (0/30). The adjusted 
analysis showed a statistically significant 
decrease in survival to hospital discharge for 
each floor of patient contact (OR 0.95, 95% CI 
0.91–0.99). 
A total of 2216 (28.3%) of the 7842 patients 
experienced return of spontaneous circulation; 
478 (25.9%) of 1844 at or above the third floor 
and 1738 (29.0%) of 5998 below the third 
floor. After adjustment for Utstein variables, 
the floor of patient contact (≥ floor 3 v. 
< floor 3) was not associated with return of 
spontaneous circulation (OR 0.90, 95% CI 
0.79–1.02) (Table 3). The results for data ana-
lyzed by every 5 floors and every 10 floors, 
with inclusion of the time to patient contact by 
911-initiated first responders, are shown in 
Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi: 
10.1503/cmaj.150544/-/DC1).
The use of automated external defibrillators 
was very low, regardless of the floor of patient 
contact. A defibrillator was applied by bystand-
ers in 19 (0.3%) of the cardiac arrests occurring 
on lower floors and 7 (0.4%) of those occurring 
on the third floor or above (p = 0.7). 
Interpretation
In this study, survival to hospital discharge after 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in private resi-
dences was better when the patient was located 
on a lower floor. Survival was negligible (0.9%) 
for those living on floor 16 or above, and there 
were no survivors above floor 25.
Our results are consistent with previous litera-
ture showing that 911 response time, measured 
from the time of the 911 call to arrival of the 
response vehicle on scene, is a significant predic-
tor of patient survival after out-of-hospital car-
diac arrest.9,10,19 However, those studies did not 
account for the time required for 911-initiated 
first responders to reach the patient’s side 
and initiate care. Few previous studies have 
attempted to measure this extended inter-
val.11,13,14,20 Campbell and colleagues11 showed 
that prehospital response time was significantly 
longer when the time from arrival of 911- 
initiated first responders on scene to patient con-
tact was included. Morrison and colleagues14 
observed a response delay of 1.5 minutes for all 
911 emergency medical calls that occurred at or 
above the third floor in high-rise buildings in 
Toronto. Previous cardiac arrest research has 
found similar delays to patient care after arrival 
of 911-initiated first responders on scene. Camp-
bell and colleagues20 found an average delay to 
defibrillation of 3.6 minutes from arrival of 
911-initiated first responders on scene. However, 
they did not report on patient outcomes in rela-
tion to this delay. Our determination of the nega-
tive effect of a delay in reaching higher floors on 
patient outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest is novel and important.
Longer time from the arrival of 911-initiated 
first responders on scene to patient contact is one 
potential explanation for lower survival on the 
higher floors. This delay to patient contact could 
explain the smaller proportion of patients with

an initial shockable rhythm found on the higher 
floors. After a patient collapses in cardiac arrest, 
deterioration from a shockable to a nonshockable 
rhythm occurs rapidly,21 and the presence of an 
initial shockable rhythm is one of the most 
important determinants of survival.22 With a rap-
idly deteriorating heart rhythm, and in the 
absence of defibrillation, cardiac arrests occur-
ring on higher floors had a lower probability of 
survival because of the delay to patient contact 
by 911-initiated first responders. Another pos-
sible explanation for lower survival on higher 
floors is the potential for extended extrication 
times from the patient’s residence. Lateef and 
colleagues13 showed that higher vertical heights 
were associated with extended delays in extrica-
tion time. Once a decision has been made to 
transport a patient who is in refractory cardiac 
arrest, there are prolonged periods during the 
extrication to the ambulance and en route to the 
hospital when the quality of CPR is sub-
optimal.23 As the patient is carried down stairs or 
is transported in an elevator, there is a shift in 
focus from providing continuous, high-quality 
CPR to removing the patient from the scene and 
getting him or her to the hospital quickly and 
safely. These disruptions in care could have a 
detrimental effect on patient outcome.
Although we observed a significant decrease 
in survival after cardiac arrest on higher floors, 
the same relation did not hold for the outcome of 
return of spontaneous circulation. The lack of an

association between vertical height and return of 
spontaneous circulation suggests that the mech-
anism for decreased survival is not failure of 
Advanced Cardiac Life Support treatment, but 
rather the damage related to prolonged response 
times to higher floors, even when circulation is 
ultimately restored.
Researchers investigating out-of-hospital car-
diac arrests typically adjust for 911 response inter-
vals from the time of emergency activation to 
arrival on scene, but they do not routinely account 
for the interval from arrival on scene to patient 
contact. Since the latter interval can lead to con-
siderable delays in the initiation of patient care, it 
is important that future research include adjust-
ments for this factor. As more high-rise buildings 
are built, in response to the demand for affordable 
condominiums and rental properties, the negative 
impact on community survival may increase. The 
911 response time, from emergency activation to 
arrival of first responders on scene, will remain 
relatively constant, so long as traffic patterns do 
not change; however, the time from arrival on 
scene to initial patient contact may increase as 
more of the population comes to live at or above 
the third floor. Thus, 911 response time may 
diminish in importance as a determin 
ant of sur-
vival, whereas the time to patient contact may 
become more important in predicting who lives 
and who dies after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
Identification and correction of barriers to 
911-initiated first responders may help to improve 
the time to patient contact. One potential barrier is 
elevator access. Fire departments have a universal 
elevator access key, which gives firefighters sole 
access to elevators without public interference. In 
contrast, only rarely in prehospital care systems 
do paramedics have access to a universal elevator 
key. Availability of a universal key seems like a 
simple intervention, but it has remained unad-
dressed for decades. Perhaps quantifying the 
extent to which this barrier prolongs the interval 
to patient contact and affects outcomes will per-
suade municipal administrators to address this 
barrier to care. Conveying emergency alerts to 
building staff (e.g., security personnel) before the 
arrival of 911-initiated first responders may also 
reduce delays. Including local building staff in the 
emergency response process could minimize 
unnecessary delays in gaining access to the build-
ing and ensure that elevators are waiting on the 
ground floor at the arrival times of both fire 
department personnel and paramedics. Finally, 
optimization of placement of automated external 
defibrillators to maximize their availability for 
bystander use may improve outcomes after car-
diac arrest in high-rise buildings. The rate of 
bystander use of automated external defibrillators 
was very low in this study. Because the presence 
of a shockable rhythm deteriorates over time, pro-
viding bystanders in high-rise buildings with easy 
access to automated external defibrillators may 
increase the use of these devices. Improving the 
accessibility of de 
fibrillators could be accom-
plished by placing the devices on specific floors, 
in building lobbies or inside elevators, so that they 
can be easily delivered to the floor of the cardiac 
arrest, saving precious minutes and ensuring rapid 
defibrillation.
Limitations
Given the nature of retrospective observational 
studies, we could not determine a causal relation 
between survival and vertical height. The emer-
gency medical services in this study were 
involved in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consor-
tium network and as such were well established, 
with rigorous quality assurance and feedback 
mechanisms in place. Therefore, the results of this 
study may not be generalizable to other emer-
gency medical services that lack similar oversight 
and monitoring of resuscitation performance. 
Because of limited information available from 
paramedic documentation, the third floor was 
used as the cutoff for examining the relation 
between vertical height and survival, but this may 
not represent the optimal cut-point for analysis. 
Very few cardiac arrests occurred on higher 
floors, and there were no survivors above floor 25. 
This skewing of the data may have biased our 
analysis using floor of contact as a continuous 
variable. Finally, patient outcome data were miss-
ing for about 5% of the cases, although this is well 
within acceptable standards.
Conclusion
With continuing construction of high-rise build-
ings, it is important to understand the potential 
effect of vertical height on patient outcomes after 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In our study, car-
diac arrests that occurred on higher floors were 
associated with lower survival, and there were 
no survivors above floor 25. These results may 
have been due to longer intervals from arrival of 
911-initiated first responders to patient contact 
and lower rates of an initial shockable rhythm 
for patients on the higher floors. Interventions 
aimed at improving access to patients in high-
rise buildings may increase rates of survival.
