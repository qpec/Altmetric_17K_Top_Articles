BACKGROUND: Out-of-pocket expenditures are thought to be an important barrier to the receipt of cancer preventive services, espe-
cially for those of a lower socioeconomic status (SES). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated out-of-pocket expenditures for rec-
ommended services, including mammography and colonoscopy. The objective of this study was to determine changes in the uptake
of mammography and colonoscopy among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries before and after ACA implementation. METHODS:
Using Medicare claims data, this study identified women who were 70 years old or older and had not undergone mammography in
the previous 2 years and men and women who were 70 years old or older, were at increased risk for colorectal cancer, and had not
undergone colonoscopy in the past 5 years. The receipt of procedures in the 2-year period before the ACA’s implementation (2009-
2010) and after its implementation (2011 to September 2012) was also identified. Multivariate generalized estimating equation models
were used to determine the independent association and county-level quartile of median income and education with the receipt of
testing. RESULTS: For mammography, a lower SES quartile was associated with less uptake, but the post-ACA disparities were
smaller than those in the pre-ACA period. In addition, mammography rates increased from the pre-ACA period to the post-ACA peri-
od in all SES quartiles. For colonoscopy, in both the pre- and post-ACA periods, there was an association between uptake and educa-
tional level and, to some extent, income. However, there were no appreciable changes in colonoscopy and SES after implementation
of the ACA. CONCLUSIONS: The removal of out-of-pocket expenditures may overcome a barrier to the receipt of recommended
preventive services, but for colonoscopy, other procedural factors may remain as deterrents. Cancer 2017;123:1585-9. V

INTRODUCTION
The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law in 2010 and whose phased-in implementation began in 2011,
provided expanded health care insurance coverage to previously uninsured or underinsured individuals. Although the ma-
jor objectives of the ACA were to be achieved through Medicaid expansion, insurance mandates, and the elimination of
exclusions for preexisting conditions, another goal was to eliminate out-of-pocket expenditures for preventive services that
were approved by the US Preventive Services Task Force, including screening mammography and colonoscopy. The re-
duction of financial barriers to the receipt of cancer screening is thought to be an important step in eliminating known so-
cioeconomic disparities in the incidence of cancer and the stage of cancer at presentation.1
Although it is assumed that the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses will reduce disparities, there is little empirical
evidence to support this contention. Previous studies have reported inconsistent findings with respect to changes in screen-
ing after the passage of the ACA,2-7 and few have compared changes across socioeconomic strata. Therefore, we examined
the uptake of mammography and colonoscopy according to the county-level socioeconomic status (SES) among fee-for-
service Medicare beneficiaries in the 2-year period before the ACA (2009-2010) and in the 2 years after implementation
of the ACA (2011-2012).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The design of the study has been previously reported.8 In brief, we used a 5% random sample of fee-for-service Medicare
beneficiaries who were 70 years old or older and were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. Files included the

 2009-2012 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, out-
patient and carrier or physician claim files, and Medicare
Beneficiary Summary files, which contain enrollment
data. On the basis of their most recent screening proce-
dure date, we identified women who had not undergone
mammography in the last 24-month period and men and
women who were at increased risk for colorectal cancer
(previous polyp diagnosis or polypectomy, inflammatory
bowel disease, or family history of colon cancer) and had
not undergone colonoscopy in the past 5 years. Using pre-
viously developed algorithms, the analysis was limited to
procedures that were performed for preventive indications
rather than diagnostic indications.9,10 We excluded bene-
ficiaries who were enrolled in Medicare because of end-
stage renal disease or disability or because of a diagnosis of
cancer or carcinoma in situ during the previous 5-year pe-
riod. Because of the need to have a 5-year look-back peri-
od, we excluded beneficiaries aged 65 to 69 years, and
eligible patients entered the sample at the age of 70 years.
Because Medicare files do not contain beneficiary-
level SES, using the 2010 US Census data, we included the
county-level median household income and proportion of
high school graduates among adults aged 25 years or older
as a proxy. These measures were stratified by quartile.
Other measures included the following: demographic
characteristics (age, race, and sex for colonoscopy),
geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West),
comorbidity score,11 receipt of Medicare wellness visits or
welcome-to-Medicare visits, presence of additional breast
cancer risk factors (including benign breast neoplasms, ab-
normal findings on radiological and other breast exami-
nations, complications due to breast prostheses, Cowden
syndrome, personal history of chest irradiation, and family
history of breast or ovarian cancer [for mammography]),
and county density of primary care providers and county
density of gastroenterologists (for colonoscopy) as measured
by the 2010 American Medical Association Masterfile.
Because individual patients were eligible for screen-
ing in more than 1 year, patient-level generalized estimat-
ing equation logistic regression was used to account for
within-patient correlation. Multivariate generalized esti-
mating equation models were used to determine the inde-
pendent association of quartiles of SES measures with the
receipt of testing, and we calculated the odds ratio for the
receipt of procedures within each SES quartile. Analyses
were performed for the 2-year period before ACA
implementation (2009-2010) and the 2-year period after
implementation (2011 to September 2012). The models
included an indicator variable for the time period as well
as interactions between the period and the income and ed-
ucation quartiles. The resulting models allowed the effects
of education and income quartiles to vary between the 2
periods and allowed us to test whether relations between
screening and these factors changed from the pre-ACA
period to the post-ACA period. The study was approved
by the University Hospital Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
The sample included 862,267 women for the mammog-
raphy analysis. In the mammography sample, the mean
age was 79.7 6 6.9 years, 86.5% were white, and 8.2%
were African American. More than 16% had evidence of
increased breast cancer risk, and 57.2% had undergone 1
or more mammograms within the previous 5 years. The
estimated odds ratios for the effects of the income and
education quartiles for the pre- and post-ACA periods are
shown (Tables 1 and 2). Although for both time periods
there appeared to be an association between a lower SES
quartile and less receipt of mammography (Table 1), after
implementation of the ACA, the odds ratios differed

 significantly between the 2 time periods, and the post-
ACA disparities were smaller than those of the pre-ACA
period. For example, in comparison with the highest
quartile, the odds ratio for the lowest quartile increased
from 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.88) be-
fore the ACA to 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.95) after the ACA
for income and from 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75-0.77) to 0.86
(95% CI, 0.85-0.87) for education (P < .0001 for a com-
parison of the time periods). In addition, significant inter-
action with the time period was found for the effects of
income and education. We then compared screening rates
in the post-ACA period with rates before the ACA within
each category of income and education quartile (Table 2).
These data indicate that mammography rates increased
from the pre-ACA period to the post-ACA period in all
categories.
The sample included 326,503 men and women for
the colonoscopy analysis. In the colonoscopy sample, the
mean age was 77.1 6 6.1 years, 59% were female, 89.9%
were white, and 6.3% were African American. There was
evidence of the receipt of colonoscopy in the past 5 years
for 68%. The estimated odds ratios for the effects of in-
come and education quartiles for the pre- and post-ACA
periods are shown (Tables 3 and 4). In both the pre- and
post-ACA periods, there was an association of the educa-
tional level and, to some extent, income with the receipt
of colonoscopy (Table 3). However, in contrast to mam-
mography, there were no appreciable changes after im-
plementation of the ACA. For example, in comparison
with the highest quartile, the odds ratio for the lowest
quartile was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.97) before the ACA
and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90-0.95) after the ACA for income
and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.99) before the ACA and 1.00
(95% CI, 0.97-1.03) after the ACA for education
(P 5 .40 for a comparison of the time periods for income
and P 5 .07 for education). The interaction tests indicate
that the effects of income, education, and quartile did
not differ significantly between the 2 time periods, and
this is consistent with the results of the more specific
tests. In addition, odds ratios comparing colonoscopy
rates before and after the ACA indicated a slight decrease
in uptake (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
It has been well documented that members of lower socio-
economic groups are less likely to receive cancer preven-
tive services. For example, data from the 2013 National
Health Interview Survey indicate differences in colorectal
endoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, mammography,
Papanicolaou testing, and prostate-specific antigen testing
according to the level of education and the presence of
health insurance.12 Thus, the elimination or reduction of
out-of-pocket expenditures should ideally reduce these
disparities. Using a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries, we
found that after implementation of the ACA, not only
was there an increase in mammography uptake, but the
gap in the receipt of mammography between the lowest
and highest SES strata narrowed. In contrast, overall

 colonoscopy uptake did not differ substantively across
strata and was stagnant with no change in any observed
disparities after implementation of the ACA.
Although screening mammography and colonosco-
py were covered benefits under Medicare before imple-
mentation of the ACA, beneficiaries were responsible for
paying 20% coinsurance for mammography and 25% co-
insurance for colonoscopy. For diagnostic mammography
or colonoscopy, including colonoscopy with preventive
indications resulting in biopsy or polypectomy, beneficia-
ries were also responsible for the annual deductible. After
implementation of the ACA, both coinsurance and
deductibles were waived for screening examinations, but
for diagnostic indications, beneficiaries were still responsi-
ble for coinsurance.
Previous studies have used changes in reimburse-
ment policy to examine the impact of decreased out-of-
pocket expenditures on procedure uptake. In 1991, when
screening mammography was first reimbursed under
Medicare, rates of mammography remained similar to
those of the previous year, although they were consistently
lower for women who lacked supplemental insurance.13
In 1998, Medicare coverage changed from biennial mam-
mography to annual mammography, and this policy
change was associated with a decrease in advanced-stage
cancers among women enrolled in fee-for-service plans
rather than managed-care plans.14 However, out-of-
pocket expenditures continued to be a barrier to the re-
ceipt of mammography, as demonstrated in a study of
Medicare managed-care enrollees.15 Overall colonoscopy
use increased after coverage of screening colonoscopy for
high-risk individuals,10 and it increased further after uni-
versal coverage in July 2001.16,17 In patients younger than
65 years, state mandates for insurance coverage for screen-
ing colonoscopy have been associated with higher screen-
ing rates.18 However, none of the aforementioned studies
examined the impact of these changes on known socioeco-
nomic disparities in screening.
More recently, studies have examined changes in
screening procedures in health plans4,5,7 and Medicare
beneficiaries3,6 after implementation of the ACA and
have found either no substantive change in screening or
increases only in a subgroup of patients. Although most
studies did not stratify their findings by SES, one study of
a high-deductible health plan found that colorectal
screening rates increased after the ACA, but the change
was limited to higher income individuals.7 The current
findings contrast with those of 2 cross-sectional studies.
Fedewa et al2 used National Health Interview Survey data
and found an increase in colon cancer screening from
2008 to 2013 among Medicare beneficiaries and individ-
uals with lower income and educational attainment and
no overall change in mammography uptake. Hamman
and Kapinos6 used Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System data and found an increase in colorectal screening
in men but not women after the ACA, with the largest
increase in socioeconomically disadvantaged men. How-
ever, our methodology differed in that the same popula-
tion was examined before and after the ACA, and thus it
accounted for pre-ACA screening behavior. In addition,
our study included a colonoscopy population with addi-
tional risk factors, so these individuals may exhibit differ-
ent behavior than an average-risk population.
We acknowledge several limitations of the data.
First, the administrative data lack clinical detail, including
the ability to differentiate between screening and diagnos-
tic indications, although we used previously developed
algorithms to select screening procedures. The study also
did not examine beneficiaries who were enrolled in Medi-
care advantage plans but focused on the impact of reform
changes among fee-for-service enrollees. The analysis was
also limited to an older patient population that was pre-
dominantly Caucasian, and thus the impact of reform leg-
islation in other populations, including younger, privately
insured, or predominantly minority individuals, could
not be measured. Although routine screening colonoscopy
is not universally recommended past the age of 75 years,
for patients at increased cancer risk, such as those in this
study, there is no upper age limit. Another limitation is
the lack of data on supplemental or Medigap insurance
because individuals with such insurance would not be sub-
ject to out-of-pocket expenses for diagnostic procedures.
However, the presence of Medigap insurance would have
the greatest effect in the pre-ACA period, when out-of-
pocket expenses were greater. The current legislation also
does not waive copayments for colonoscopy with biopsy

 or polypectomy for Medicare beneficiaries, even if the
procedure indication is preventive, and it is unknown if
this loophole has served as a deterrent to colonoscopy up-
take. Finally, because patient-level SES data were not
available in the claims data, we used small area measures;
this is an approach commonly used in studies of Medicare
data. However, we acknowledge that within a given re-
gion, there is some degree of heterogeneity in SES.
Although we were unable to measure a direct cause
and effect relation, we found that after implementation of
the ACA, there was reduction in socioeconomic dispar-
ities for screening mammography but not colonoscopy.
The findings support the removal of out-of-pocket expen-
ditures as a barrier to the receipt of recommended preven-
tive services but emphasize that for colonoscopy, other
factors such as a fear of sedation, perceived discomfort,
and a need for bowel preparation should be considered.
We suggest that future studies examine the ACA’s impact
in other populations, including newly insured individuals.
