Burnout and Scope of Practice in New Family Physicians
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Family physicians report some of the highest levels of burnout, but 
no published work has considered whether burnout is correlated with the broad 
scope of care that family physicians may provide. We examined the associations 
between family physician scope of practice and self-reported burnout.
METHODS Secondary analysis of the 2016 National Family Medicine Graduate 
Survey respondents who provided outpatient continuity care (N 
= 
1,617). We 
used bivariate analyses and logistic regression to compare self-report of burnout 
and measures of scope of practice including: inpatient medicine, obstetrics, pedi-
atric ambulatory care, number of procedures and/or clinical content areas, and 
providing care outside the principal practice site.
RESULTS Forty-two percent of respondents reported feeling burned out from 
their work once a week or more. In bivariate analysis, elements of scope of prac-
tice associated with higher burnout rates included providing more procedures/
clinical content areas (mean procedures/clinical areas: 7.49 vs 7.02; P 
= 
.02) and 
working in more settings than the principal practice site (1+ additional set-
tings: 57.6% vs 48.4%: P 
= 
.001); specifically in the hospital (31.4% vs 24.2%; 
P 
= 
.002) and patient homes (3.3% vs 1.5%; P 
= 
.02). In adjusted analysis, 
practice characteristics significantly associated with lower odds of burnout were 
practicing inpatient medicine (OR 
= 
0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; P 
= 
.0017) and 
obstetrics (OR 
= 
0.64; 95% CI, 0.47-0.88; P 
= 
.0058).
CONCLUSIONS Early career family physicians who provide a broader scope of 
practice, specifically, inpatient medicine, obstetrics, or home visits, reported sig-
nificantly lower rates of burnout. Our findings suggest that comprehensiveness is 
associated with less burnout, which is critical in the context of improving access 
to good quality, affordable care while maintaining physician wellness.

INTRODUCTION
T
he first national study of physicians and professional burnout took 
place in 2011
1; the rate of burnout among physicians has been on 
the rise since.2 The professional, psychological, and patient-care 
aspects of physician burnout have been well documented.3–17 National 
efforts to identify and prevent physician burnout are underway,18 and 
numerous recent studies examining the individual, structural, and organi-
zational contributions to burnout have generated potential strategies to 
address the problem.19–24
Among physicians, family physicians report some of the highest levels 
of burnout.2 As a specialty, family medicine is not limited by patient sex, 
physiology, age, or site where care is delivered. Despite broad training, 
recent research has described the declining scope of practice of family 
physicians.25–29 This decline is occurring in spite of trainees’ intention to 
have a broader scope than what most practicing family physicians actu-
ally provide.30 Benefits of family physicians practicing broadly, evident at 
the health care system level,31 include reducing overall costs and odds of 
hospitalization.32 On an individual level, however, practicing broadly may 
be a challenge because of constraints imposed by employers, insurers, 
and market forces or because of impact on lifestyle.25,26,28,33–35 Despite the

potential negative impact of a broad scope of practice 
on lifestyle, no studies to date have considered the role 
of scope of practice on physician burnout. Populations 
are healthier in systems that emphasize primary care,31 
and comprehensive family medicine is associated with 
lower costs32 which both make a case for family physi-
cians to provide a broad scope of practice to contrib-
ute to the Triple Aim.36 If broad scope was also shown 
to be associated with lower physician burnout, then 
it would meet the additional focus on wellness that is 
central to the new Quadruple Aim.17 Our objective was 
to examine the associations between family physician 
scope of practice and self-reported burnout.
METHODS
We used data from the first cohort of the National 
Family Medicine Graduate Survey. The survey was 
administered in 2016 by the American Board of Fam-
ily Medicine (ABFM) to all diplomates who graduated 
from residency in 2013. It was a collaborative effort 
between the ABFM and the Association of Family 
Medicine Residency Directors to help residencies 
meet accreditation requirements and provide national 
comparisons.37 The survey included items relevant to 
residency education including preparation for practice, 
scope of practice, practice organization, satisfaction, 
and burnout.38 Additional personal demographics were 
obtained from ABFM administrative databases.
Our main outcome was self-reported burnout. We 
used a validated single item to measure the emotional 
exhaustion domain of burnout that correlates highly 
to this subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory.39 
We chose to focus on this domain of the Maslach 
Burnout Inventory as it is what people commonly 
recognize as feeling burned out. Consistent with past 
work we characterized respondents as burned out if 
they reported that they feel burned out from work 
once a week or more often.2,15
Measures of scope of practice were derived from 
single survey items that included inpatient medicine and 
obstetrics practices. To capture the breadth of practice 
we constructed 2 variables from multiple survey items. 
First, we summed the number of family physicians 
working in 8 clinical practice areas and performing 17 
common procedures (Table 1). Second, to capture phy-
sicians providing care in multiple settings beyond their 
principal practice site, we summed the number of prac-
tice settings (9 types) in which respondents routinely 
saw patients (Table 2). To account for total work effort, 
we used self-reported number of patient encounters 
per day and whether they took after-hours call or saw 
patients on weekends and/or evenings. We had data on 
self-reported total hours worked per week but given 
high collinearity with patient encounters, we excluded 
hours from the analysis.
We limited our sample to physicians who provided 
outpatient continuity care because we were interested 
in associations between scope of practice and burnout. 
Therefore, we excluded respondents with practices that 
were already limited by setting or specialization such 
as those who solely practice urgent care, sports medi-
cine, or emergency medicine and those who became 
hospitalists. We first characterized our sample using 
descriptive statistics. Then we compared bivariate 
associations between those who reported burnout and 
those who did not. To determine associations between 
burnout and scope of practice, we constructed logistic 
regression models that controlled for personal and 
practice demographics. Due to high collinearity of

additional practice sites and number of procedures 
with the inpatient and obstetrics variables, we removed

ses were completed in SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). 
This study was approved by the American Academy of 
Family Physicians Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
Demographics
The 2016 National Family Medicine Graduate Sur-
vey had 2,069 respondents (67% response rate). The 
final sample for this study included 1,617 (78%) of the 
respondents who indicated that they provided direct 
patient care and practiced outpatient continuity of 
care, representing 52.4% of all physicians surveyed.
Respondents had a mean age of 35.9 years 
(SD = 4.4), and a majority were female (58.6%), had a 
doctor of medicine (MD) degree (84.7%), and gradu-
ated from a US medical school (66.8%) (Table 2). 
Overall, 41.9% of our sample reported feeling burned 
out from their work at least once a week.
Burnout Related to Demographics  
and Work Effort
In bivariate analysis, those who were burned out were 
less likely to be males (37.2% burned out vs 44.4% 
not burned out; P = .004) and international medical 
graduates (29.8% burned out vs 35.5% not burned out; 
P = .016) (Table 3). These associations held true in the 
multivariable logistic regression as well; in the adjusted 
models, females had 32% greater odds of burnout than 
males (OR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07-1.62; P = .009) and US 
medical graduates had 37% greater odds of burnout 
than international medical graduates (OR = 1.37; 95% 
CI, 1.08-1.75; P = .0099) (Table 4).
There were no differences in burnout associated 
with the number of patient encounters per day (20.2 vs 
20.3), taking after-hours call (74.2% for both groups), 
or seeing patients after hours on weekends or evenings 
(53.5% vs 51.3%) (Table3).
Burnout Related to Scope of Practice
In bivariate analysis, practicing in at least 1 setting 
beyond the principal practice site was negatively 
associated with burnout (no additional settings: 51.6% 
burned out vs 42.3% not burned out; 1 or more 
additional settings: 48.4% burned out vs 57.6% not 
burned out; P = .001) (Table 3). In independent analy-
ses for each additional setting, practicing in a hos-
pital and making house calls were both significantly 
associated with lower burnout. Practicing inpatient 
medicine, obstetrics, and more than the mean number 
of procedures/clinical areas were also significantly 
associated with lower burnout. Caring for pediatric 
patients in the outpatient setting was not correlated 
with burnout.
In logistic regression models controlling for all 
characteristics, we found significant independent 
associations with reduced burnout among those 
practicing obstetrics (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47-
0.88; P = .0058) and practicing inpatient medicine 
(OR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; P = .0017). No inde-
pendent association with practicing pediatric ambu-
latory care was observed (Table 4). The number of 
procedures/clinical areas practiced and additional 
practice settings were not analyzed in the regression 
model because they were found to be co-linear with 
the variables for practicing inpatient medicine and 
obstetrics.

DISCUSSION
Data from the first year (2016) of the National Family 
Medicine Graduate Survey suggest that for early career 
family physicians, having a broader scope of practice 
is associated with a lower risk of burnout. Those who 
practiced in more locations and performed a greater 
variety of procedures/clinical areas were significantly 
less likely to report feeling burned out once a week or 
more. The strongest associations were for practicing 
obstetrics and inpatient medicine, both areas with a 
decline in practice among family physicians in recent 
years.25,28,29 Those practicing obstetrics had 36% lower 
odds of reporting feeling burned out and those practic-
ing inpatient medicine had 30% lower odds of report-
ing feeling burned out than their peers who were not 
practicing in these areas.
This study advances the literature on scope of 
practice by showing additional benefits to providing 
a broader scope of care—of major importance in a 
specialty where burnout rates are among the highest of 
all physicians.2 Previous research has shown the impor-
tance of comprehensive care to the Triple Aim (the 
goal of having improved population health and patient 
care with lower costs36) by demonstrating that compre-
hensiveness can reduce costs to 
the system.32 Our study takes the 
notion of the benefits of compre-
hensiveness one step further by 
showing an impact on the Qua-
druple Aim, the model in which 
physician wellness is as important 
as access, quality, and cost to fix-
ing the health care system.17
We have seen that graduat-
ing residents intend to provide a 
broader scope of care than that 
typically provided by practic-
ing family physicians,30 though 
causes of the narrowing scope 
of care are not clear and may be 
due to individual factors (such 
as training and preference), or 
market and system factors, or a 
combination of both.25–27,33 We 
also know that physician burnout 
is very costly for a health care 
system.15,40,41 If new family physi-
cians and the systems hiring them 
see that there are many benefits 
to providing comprehensive, 
broad spectrum care even in a 
time of increasing health system 
integration,42 self- and system-
imposed limitations of practice 
might change to encourage fam-
ily physicians to see patients in 
the hospital and to deliver babies.
Our study is subject to several 
limitations. As with all cross-
sectional studies, these findings 
cannot demonstrate causality. We 
do not know whether a broad 
scope of practice is protective 
against developing burnout, if 
resilient personalities tend to 
choose a broader scope of prac-

tice, or if those who are burned out already limited 
their scope of care. The data are self-reported, and 
thus may be subject to social desirability or recall 
bias. The sample represents early career family physi-
cians certified by the ABFM; those certified only by 
the American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians 
are not included, which limits the generalizability of 
our findings. This concern is attenuated, however, 
because almost 65% of osteopathic family physi-
cians in residency are either in dually accredited or in 
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education 
(ACGME) accredited programs43 and in this cohort 
of residents, 94.8% became ABFM diplomates and 
were offered the graduate survey. Though the rates of 
burnout seen in this study corresponded to what has 
been published elsewhere for younger physicians,44 the 
diversity in age was minimal enough that age had no 
impact on burnout in our study, despite much research 
that has shown age/career stage to play a significant 
role in burnout.4,44,45
Future research is needed to compare how burnout 
may impact scope of practice for those who are in 
practice for longer periods of time and for those who 
make major changes to their practice patterns. If cau-
sality between scope of practice and physician wellness 
is confirmed, this would allow for new policy levers 
and incentives for systems and physicians to improve 
not only health care but also their own health. The 
associations with sex and medical school type, while 
outside the focus of this research question, also war-
rant further investigation.
With increasing evidence of the negative effects of 
physician burnout, health systems are focusing on phy-
sician wellness in the context of the Quadruple Aim. 
Our finding that early career family physicians who 
provide broader care—including inpatient medicine, 
obstetrics, and home visits—have lower rates of burn-
out suggests an association between comprehensive-
ness and wellness. Promoting a broad scope of practice 
in primary care, and family medicine in particular, may 
advance efforts to achieve the Quadruple Aim.
