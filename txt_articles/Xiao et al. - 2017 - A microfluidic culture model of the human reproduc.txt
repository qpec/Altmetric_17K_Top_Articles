The endocrine system dynamically controls tissue differentiation and homeostasis, but has
not been studied using dynamic tissue culture paradigms. Here we show that a microfluidic
system supports murine ovarian follicles to produce the human 28-day menstrual cycle
hormone profile, which controls human female reproductive tract and peripheral tissue
dynamics in single, dual and multiple unit microfluidic platforms (Solo-MFP, Duet-MFP and
Quintet-MPF, respectively). These systems simulate the in vivo female reproductive tract
and the endocrine loops between organ modules for the ovary, fallopian tube, uterus,
cervix and liver, with a sustained circulating flow between all tissues. The reproductive
tract tissues and peripheral organs integrated into a microfluidic platform, termed EVATAR,
represents a powerful new in vitro tool that allows organ–organ integration of hormonal
signalling as a phenocopy of menstrual cycle and pregnancy-like endocrine loops and has
great potential to be used in drug discovery and toxicology studies.

 T
he female reproductive tract is required for the production
of ova, secretion of sex hormones and the maintenance
of pregnancy throughout the gestation of healthy offspring.
Entry and advancement through puberty, normal menstrual
cycles with a potential intervening pregnancy, and endocrine
support of peripheral tissues, such as the bone, brain and heart,
are all essential roles that the reproductive tract tissues and their
hormones play. The main organs of the female reproductive tract
are the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and cervix. Each organ
has major responsibilities that are either autonomous (for
example, maturation of oocytes and gestation of the fetus) or
interdependent such as providing hormonal support for the tracts
through which gametes (eggs and sperm) travel and a location for
the developing embryo to implant. Moreover, each organ is
composed of cells from multiple lineages (for example, myome-
trium and endometrium in the uterus) that provide local function
and feedback control. Because of the intimate relationship
between the cells of each organ and between organs, toxicology
studies in the female reproductive tract have been difficult to
design.
Methods used to grow mammalian cells outside the body
have not fundamentally changed in the last 50 years. Preclinical
studies
often
begin
with
individual
cells,
separated
from
cellular and physical contacts that are important for biological
function1.
These
dispersed
cells
must
be
propagated
through weekly reduction divisions and maintained on flat
plastic; however, these cells are missing the cell physicochemical
microenvironment,
three-dimensional
(3D)
tissue-specific
architecture,
and
blood
flow
perfusion
found
in
natural
tissues. Furthermore, typical media composition is based on
basal nutrients, bovine serum and a few specialized factors that
are placed in a static setting with random mixing. As a
consequence, cell–cell and tissue-level cytokine and endocrine
signals are not integrated into signalling pathways. In parallel
with
these
developments,
the
pharmaceutical
industry
is
challenged by the fact that fewer drugs are emerging to address
many unmet needs, including cardiovascular disease, cancer,
immune diseases, and new contraceptives2–4. Despite large
investments in research funding, only B8% of drugs for which
Investigational New Drug applications have been filed will be
approved by the FDA5. Innovative methods to culture cells
in vitro to test new compounds are therefore necessary to
reinvigorate the drug pipeline.
Recently, organ-on-a-chip and human-on-a-chip microfluidic
technologies have garnered significant interest and offer promis-
ing approaches to test the efficacy and toxicity of new drugs
in
vitro16–18.
Microfluidics
represents
an
engineered
manipulation
of fluid flow
in a set of micrometre-sized
channels and provides precise control of microlitre volume of
fluids. In the current study, Solo-MFP and Duet-MFP systems
based on pneumatic actuation technology and a Quintet-MFP
system based on embedded electromagnetic actuation technology
were designed for single and multiple tissue cultures, respectively.
Mouse ovarian tissue was cultured in the Solo-MFP and Duet-
MFP systems for 28 days, which resulted in follicle production
of 28-day menstrual cycle hormone profiles. To test the ovarian
hormone control of downstream human female reproductive
tract
and
peripheral
tissues,
the
ovary,
fallopian
tube,
uterus, cervix and liver were cultured in the Quintet-MFP
system. This integrated microfluidic platform enables dynamic
and
precisely
controlled
interaction
between
organs
and is operational over the course of month-long experiments.
This represents a next step in fundamental and applied
toxicology as well as therapeutic discovery and deployment to
address a wide range of biological problems and fill the drug
pipeline.
Results
Microfluidic technology enabled dynamic tissue integration.
The first step of our work was to develop platforms that could
sustain tissue-level function for the length of the human menstrual
cycle (that is, 28 days). The Solo-MFP and Duet-MFP systems are
based on pneumatic actuation technology, by which the individual
systems are supplied with positive and negative air pressures via a
system dock that is connected to a five-channel pressure controller
manifold (Fig. 1a,b, refer to Supplementary Table 1 for nomen-
clature). The pressure of individual channels is switched between a
vacuum or pressure source using an electromagnetic three-way
valve controlled via a personalized pump programme created in
LabVIEW using a computer interface. The Solo-MFP and Duet-
MFP systems use a universal pneumatic plate that distributes
positive and negative air pressures to specific valve or pump
membranes clamped between the pneumatic and fluidic plates.
Sequential application of pressure and vacuum to valve and pump
membranes creates a peristalsis-like stroke that enables fluid to
move through individual microfluidic paths within or between
modules. Four valves arranged in North, South, East and West
positions that are oriented about a central pump chamber create a
four-port pump structure, enabling multiple bi-directional flows in
each fluidic circuit. The fluidic plates are specifically designed for
either the Solo-MFP or Duet-MFP module configuration. Solo-
MFP systems consist of four replicates of a fluidic circuit with two
connected modules: a coupled donor/acceptor module and a
module for tissues (Fig. 1a). Duet-MFP systems consist of a single
set of four modules: a donor module, two modules for tissues, and
a separate acceptor module (Fig. 1b). Pneumatic actuation
manipulates the membranes, generating pressure-driven flow in
the fluidic paths, in order to transport fresh media from the donor
to tissues, remove older media and secreted factors to the acceptor,
or (in the case of Duet-MFP systems) move fluid from the
upstream tissue to the downstream tissue to enable in vitro com-
munication between cultured tissues.
To integrate five tissues in a single system, a more practical and
scalable approach was used for microfluidic control of tissue
interaction (Fig. 1c). This was accomplished by embedding
electromagnetically actuated micropumps within the platform,
termed the Quintet-MFP, obviating the need to supply the platform
with independent air lines for each pneumatic actuator (Fig. 1d).
This design approach allowed each of the 60 actuators of the
Quintet-MFP to be individually controlled, thus enabling precise
flow control over a wide dynamic range. Modules included flow
ports to permit recirculation within each module, ensuring that the
system was well mixed and enabling homogenous exposure of
cultured tissues to factors within the media. In addition to
recirculation within individual modules, the fluidic path design
allowed for whole-system recirculation (Fig. 1c). The combination
of whole-system and intermodule recirculation enabled a well-
mixed system within and across all modules of the Quintet-MFP.
Each fluidic path between modules was controlled by two sets of
pump actuators. This redundancy acted as a fail-safe in the event of
actuator failure. A total of twelve modules, including one donor,
one acceptor, five tissue-specific modules, and five blank modules
(for increased tissue capacity in future work) were developed for
the Quintet-MFP (Fig. 1c). As with the Solo-MFP and Duet-MFP
systems, the modules were secured on a fluidic plate that contained
the microfluidic flow channels. The fluidic plate was placed atop
the actuator plate that contained the electromagnetic actuators, and
the two plates were separated by a Viton membrane. A fan-cooled
heat sink was also added to the system to remove excess heat from
the actuator plate. The actuator plate was connected to a computer
and controller box via two ribbon cables. This controller box acted
as the intermediate between the Quintet- MFP system and the PC
running the custom LabVIEW pump programme.

 For all Solo-MFP and Duet-MFP experiments, the empirically
derived nominal through-system flow rate was set to 40 ml h � 1 to
create physiologic concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone
as determined by mathematical modelling of system pharmaco-
kinetics. The average through-system flow rates across 28 days is
shown for each system in Fig. 2a,b. For Quintet-MFP experi-
ments, the empirically derived through-system flow rate was set
to 100 ml h � 1 to create a physiologic profile of oestradiol and
progesterone
as
well
as
to
minimize
the
concentration
lag between sequential modules (Supplementary Figs 1–3). The
average through-system flow rates across 28 days for the Quintet-
MFP are shown in Fig. 2c. The through-system flow rates for all
three systems were found to consistently pump within close range
of the target values for the entirety of 28-day experiments, and in
the case of the Quintet-MFP, for periods of more than 100 days.
In addition, the stroke volumes (that is, the fluid volume
displaced in a single pump stroke) were found to exhibit little
variation across all pump pathways during a month-long pump
cycle (Fig. 2d).
The status of actuator function was periodically evaluated
in situ by monitoring the voltage pulse using an oscilloscope
(Fig. 2e). The actuation time is defined as the amount of time

 than the upper limit indicated that the actuation distance may
be too long for reliable actuation. In situ actuator monitoring
together with daily flow measurements enabled consistent
pumping over month-long studies. The timelines for these
studies,
including
microfluidic
platform
setup
and
tissue
preparation and culture, are shown in Fig. 2g.
Microfluidic culture supported follicle development. In vitro
follicle growth is a well-established model to study ovarian
function19–21. To test whether the microfluidic system supports
follicle growth, we initially performed experiments in Solo-MFP
systems using primary mouse follicles (Fig. 3a). Mouse gonadal
tissue from 12-day-old CD-1 mice was used throughout these
studies because healthy ovaries are never removed from women,
except under extraordinary circumstances such as in the case of a
sterilizing
cancer
diagnosis22.
As
has
been
demonstrated
previously,
murine
and
human
primary
follicles
behave
similarly in static culture21. For our microfluidic cultures,
follicle-stimulating
hormone
(FSH)
was
provided
at
a
concentration of 10 mIU ml � 1 through the first 14 days (day
� 14 to day 0) to mimic follicular phase gonadotropin levels
(Fig. 2g). To phenocopy the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, we
created an algorithm called ‘surge-purge’ that generated peak
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on day 0 (Fig. 2g).
Hormones were then brought to baseline for the remaining days
of culture (day 1 to day 14; Fig. 2g). All data are presented with
the hCG surge as day 0 to permit comparison of follicular and
luteal phase patterns to phases of the human menstrual cycle
(Fig. 2g). Follicle architecture and the spatial relationship of germ
cells and their supporting somatic cells were maintained in the
Solo-MFP.
Moreover,
follicle
growth
was
supported
from
primary/early secondary stage to antral stage (Fig. 3a). After
hCG stimulation, follicles released metaphase II (MII) oocytes
with
barrel-shaped
bipolar
spindles
and
tightly
aligned
chromosomes, which was termed MFP ovulation (Fig. 3a).
Once MFP ovulation occurred, the granulosa cells differentiated
into luteal cells as indicated by the granulosa cell hypertrophy and
the significantly reduced number of cell nuclei in a defined area
(Fig. 3b, Po0.05 analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s
range test). These results demonstrate that the microfluidic
environment of the Solo-MFP was capable of supporting
individual ovarian follicle growth, maturation, MFP ovulation,
and granulosa cell luteinization.
Twenty-eight-day hormone production in the Solo-MFP. Fol-
licle hormone secretion was next examined within microfluidic
culture. Following the establishment of microfluidic support and
development of ovarian follicles, follicular hormone secretion was
investigated. During the follicular phase, 17b-oestradiol (E2)
production gradually increased and peaked on day 0 when folli-
cles reached maturation (Fig. 3c). During the luteal phase, the
progesterone (P4) concentrations were markedly increased and
peaked two days after hCG treatment (Fig. 3c, Po0.05 ANOVA
with Tukey’s range test). Compared to steroid hormones secreted
in
static
culture,
follicles
exposed
to
dynamic
flow
had
significantly higher E2 and P4 production (pg per follicle per day;
Fig. 3e,f, Po0.05 ANOVA with Tukey’s range test). Next, we
examined two peptide hormones, inhibin A and inhibin B, that
are known to be secreted in the follicular phase to assess non-
steroidal patterns of follicular function. Inhibin A, is a member of
the TGFb superfamily exhibited a secretion pattern similar to that
of E2, peaking when follicles reached maturation and subse-
quently decreasing, remaining low during the luteal phase
(Fig. 3d). The secretion of inhibin B gradually increased until day
� 2 of the follicular phase, then decreased and remained low in
the later stage of the luteal phase (Fig. 3d). Taken together,
these patterns of inhibin A and inhibin B, as well as E2 and
P4, are consistent with healthy ovarian follicle performance23–25.
These human-like patterns were entirely controlled by exogenous
FSH and LH. These data show what has long been suspected;
that pituitary hormones set the tempo of each reproductive cycle,
both in vivo and now in microfluidics.
Ovarian explant cultures in the Solo-MFP and Duet-MFP.
Based on the success of follicle cultures in the Solo-MFP, we
then
used
our
microfluidic
systems
to
culture
ovarian
explants. Ovaries were collected from 12-day-old CD-1 mice;
these tissues included follicles from all classes (primordial, pri-
mary, and secondary). Ovaries were quartered and two pieces
were placed in a single cell culture insert and cultured in either
the Solo-MFP or Duet-MFP for 28 days. The treatment strategies
for the pituitary hormones, FSH and hCG, were the same as those
used in the follicle microfluidic cultures (Fig. 4a,b). Both the Solo-
MFP
and
Duet-MFP
supported
follicle
growth
from
primary/early secondary to multilayer and antral stages within
the ovarian explants (Fig. 4c). After hCG stimulation, mature
follicles
displayed
cumulus-oocyte
complex
expansion
and
released MII oocytes. Additionally, granulosa cells differentiated
into luteal cells (Fig. 4c). Both steroid (E2 and P4) and
peptide (inhibin A and B) hormones exhibited secretion patterns
similar to those seen in the microfluidic follicle cultures
(Fig. 4d–g), suggesting that ovarian tissue is a sufficient proxy for
individual follicles in our systems, and that the Solo-MFP and
Duet-MFP support each of the follicular endpoints described
above.
Integration
of
human
tissues
into
the
Quintet-MFP.
To generate a hormonally coupled ex vivo female reproductive
tract, we cultured murine ovary human fallopian tube, endome-
trium, ectocervix, and liver tissues for 28 days in the Quintet-
MFP; this combination of tissues within the system was subse-
quently termed EVATAR. This system maintained the consistent
pituitary hormone circulation and recapitulated the pituitary
hormone control of relevant tissue function, effectively mimick-
ing a 28-day human menstrual cycle (Fig. 5a). E2 and P4 peaked
in the follicular and luteal phases, respectively (Fig. 5b). However,
the absolute concentrations for both steroid and peptide hor-
mones were significantly decreased compared to hormone con-
centrations in both the Solo-MFP and Duet-MFP (60-fold
decreased for E2, 10-fold decrease for P4, 20-fold decrease for
inhibin A, and 60-fold decrease for inhibin B, Po0.05 ANOVA
with Tukey’s range test; Fig. 5b,c). Since all materials used were
the same between microfluidic platforms, and no hormone
binding to the materials
was observed (Fig. 5d), these data
suggest that the integration of multiple tissues altered the
upstream ovarian hormone expression patterns and/or that
downstream reproductive tissues consumed ovarian hormone
secretions.
Microfluidic culture of human fallopian explants. A static
co-culture system of murine follicles and human fallopian tissue
has previously been established in our laboratory26. Our work
confirmed that the cultured human fallopian tube epithelium,
including ciliated and secretory cells, could be regulated by
exogenous steroid hormones secreted by co-cultured ovarian
tissues. Specifically, cilia length, cilia-beating status, and oviduct-
specific glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1) secretion provided hallmarks of
the functional changes in the human fallopian epithelium during
the menstrual cycle27–30. In the current study, fallopian explants
were incorporated into the Quintet-MFP to facilitate a more

 Microfluidic culture of human endometrium. Human uterine
endometrial tissue explants do not survive in culture long term.
We developed a 3D culture system consisting of endometrial cells
grown in decellularized uterine scaffolds, which were then placed
in static and microfluidic cultures (Fig. 5f). Stromal and epithelial
cells within the recellularized scaffolds were delineated by
immunohistochemical staining of vimentin and cytokeratin,
respectively (Fig. 5f). The stromal cells stained positively
for Ki67, and expressed estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone
receptors (PR) at the end of the 28-day culture, indicative of

Microfluidic culture of human ectocervix explants. To model
hormone response in human ectocervix tissue in vitro, 3mm biopsy
punches of human ectocervix explants were cultured without hor-
mones for 2–5 days before integration into the Quintet-MFP. Tissue
was harvested at regular intervals throughout the entire 28-day
cycle for histological analysis. The cultured ectocervix maintained
its stratified squamous epithelial tissue architecture with pro-
liferative potential as assessed by histology and Ki67 immunor-
eactivity, respectively (Fig. 6a). At the end of the follicular phase,
when E2 concentrations peaked, the ectocervix explants promi-
nently expressed PR in both the epithelium and stroma, while this
receptor was undetectable at the end of the hormone cycle (day 14),
when E2 concentrations decreased (Fig. 6a). These findings suggest
that ectocervix tissue responded to E2 secreted from the upstream
ovarian tissue in this microfluidic culture system.
Microfluidic culture of human liver microtissues. Human
liver microtissues were also included in the Quintet-MFP to
explore non-reproductive tissue stability within our microfluidic
culture system and because this organ will be an important
tool in future metabolic studies. Over 28 days of microfluidic
culture,
liver
microtissues
retained
their
structure,
as
measured by the tight cellular contacts and nuclear staining
before and after hCG stimulation (Fig. 6b). In addition, albumin
secretion was stable throughout the 28-day culture period
(Fig. 6c).
Cytokine expression in microfluidic culture. A variety of other
factors are made at constitutive levels by reproductive tract tissues
that are not hormonally controlled. We examined two such
cytokines, interleukin 8 (IL8) and vascular endothelial growth
factor A (VEGF-A) in the Quintet-MFP. IL8 and VEGF-A peaked
in the follicular phase and remained relatively constant through
the end of the luteal phase (Fig. 6d), suggesting that the integrated
system supports both reproductive and non-reproductive secre-
tions throughout extended culture.

 in our microfluidic systems, we asked whether we could prolong
luteal phase function using the physiological cues associated with
pregnancy in an attempt to prolong luteal phase function. Briefly,
once ovulation occurs, the mature egg is released into the fallo-
pian tube where, if sperm are available, it will be fertilized before
moving
into
the
uterus
for
implantation.
The
fertilized
embryo and newly developing placenta produce and secrete hCG
and prolactin at high levels, which rescues the corpus luteum
(CL) to support an ongoing pregnancy31. We mimicked this
‘pregnancy’-like state and maintained the CL for the full
14 days of the luteal phase following MFP ovulation in the
Quintet-MFP
(Fig.
6e).
Moreover,
the
‘pregnant’
luteal
tissue produced significantly higher levels of P4 compared to
the ‘non-pregnant’ system (Fig. 6f, Po0.05 ANOVA with
Tukey’s range test). This experiment demonstrates the power
of the integrated EVATAR in the Quintet-MPF to elucidate
fundamental mechanisms of reproductive function, opening the
door to new approaches to drug discovery and toxicological
studies.
Discussion
During each ovarian cycle, follicles produce steroid and peptide
hormones to regulate downstream tissue functions, such as
endometrial growth and menstruation32. However, there are few
in vivo and in vitro models available to recapitulate a complete
28-day
human
menstrual
cycle.
By
using
our
previously
established
in
vitro
culture
methods
in
our
microfluidic
systems, ovarian tissues model in vivo human 28-day follicular
and luteal phase hormone synthesis23,33,34, and provide female
steroid and peptide hormones for downstream human fallopian,
endometrium, ectocervix, and liver tissues. Compared to static
follicle culture, the introduction of dynamic media flow promotes
ovarian steroid hormone production by follicles. Ovarian tissue
culture was then tested in both the Solo-MFP and Duet-MFP, and
our results demonstrate that these systems supported follicle
maturation and differentiation, and had ovarian hormone
secretion profiles similar to those seen with isolated follicle
culture methods. By altering culture conditions to include
sustained hCG, ovarian tissues formed CLs and maintained
high P4 production during the luteal phase, as seen during
pregnancy.
In our previous study, it was difficult to sustain cilia beating
beyond 7 days in static culture26; however, in the presence of
dynamic
flow
in
the
Quintet-MFP,
ciliary
beating
could
be maintained for up to 21 days. Cilia growth and OVGP1
expression were induced by E2 and suppressed by P4, which was
consistent with our previous findings in the follicle and fallopian
co-culture system26. IL8 and VEGF-A have been reported to
benefit CL function by maintaining high P4 production35,36. Our
study showed that both IL8 and VEGF-A peaked around the later
stage of the follicular phase and plateaued through the majority of
the luteal phase, which may give rise to the different progesterone
secretion patterns seen in the Solo/Duet-MFP and Quintet-MFP
systems.
Our engineered endometrial scaffolds co-cultured with other
female reproductive tissues survived 28 days in the Quintet-MFP,
suggesting this system is capable of sustaining the recellularized
scaffolds for extended culture in the presence of ovarian
hormones, E2 and P4. The presence of ER and PR also suggests
that the cells in the recellularized scaffold were hormone-
responsive. In addition to endometrial cells, to date, there are
limited in vitro systems that include other cell types, such as
leukocytes and natural killer cells, which play active roles in the
remodelling of the endometrium as well as influencing implanta-
tion
and
menstruation
in
vivo37–39.
Our
decellularized
endometrial scaffold provides a native tissue-like environment
and structure for cells to interact. in future years, circulating cells
like leukocytes could be envisaged to move between wells with the
aid of fluid flow.
After 28 days of culture in the Quintet-MFP, we verified that
the ectocervix explants maintained fully differentiated squamous
architecture characteristic of native ectocervix. As shown by
Ki67 expression throughout the culture, the basal and parabasal
layers of cells maintained proliferative potential in both the
follicular and luteal phases. Moreover, PR expression was
increased in response to the elevated E2 from upstream ovarian
tissue culture.
Liver metabolism is an important component when consider-
ing pharmacological and toxicological testing. We demonstrate
that liver microtissues survived the length of a 28-day female
hormone cycle in the Quintet-MFP and maintained steady
production of human albumin, which binds steroid hormones
produced during microfluidic cultures. However, further studies
are needed to investigate the xenobiotic metabolism of liver
microtissues and whether the metabolic activity could be affected
by sex hormones.
There are limited ways to effectively study whole tissues
and tissue–tissue interactions. The female reproductive organs
are especially dynamic, as they respond to fluctuating hormonal
concentrations driven by the pituitary gland and ovary in
preparation for ovulation, fertilization, embryo implantation,
and placentation. Our work provides evidence that tissues of the
female reproductive tract, as well as peripheral organs can be
integrated into a microphysiologic, dynamic, and microfluidic
culture system termed EVATAR. This powerful tool allows
organ–organ integration of hormonal signals in a manner that
phenocopies the human menstrual cycle and pregnancy. The
Solo-MFP,
Duet-MFP
and
Quintet-MFP
were
invented
to investigate both single-tissue
response and multi-tissue
interactions in a manner that maintains the 3D architecture of
each tissue. These systems produce highly controllable, stable
flow patterns for around 100 days Because of the reconfigurable
nature inherent in the design of these systems, the Solo-MFP,
Duet-MFP
and,
Quintet-MFP
can
be
used
to
investigate
numerous combinations of tissue–tissue interactions beyond
the female reproductive tract, opening up a brand new method
for in vitro tissue culture that is expected to improve the pace
and quality of across the spectrum of biological and pharmaco-
logical research.
Methods
Animals and human reproductive tissues. Ovaries and primary/early
secondary follicles were harvested from 12-day-old CD-1 female mice. All
mice were housed in polypropylene cages and provided food and water ad libitum.
Animals were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle (7:00 AM to 7:00 PM) at 23±1 �C
with 30–50% relative humidity. Animals were fed Teklad Global irradiated 2,919 or
2,916 chow (Teklad Global), which does not contain soybean or alfalfa meal to
minimize the exposure to phytoestrogens. All methods used in this study were
approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and correspond to the National Institutes of Health guidelines
and public law. Human fallopian tube, uterine endometrium and ectocervical
tissues were obtained from women undergoing routine salpingectomies and
hysterectomies at Northwestern University Prentice Women’s Hospital
(Chicago, IL, USA). All experiments, procedures and methods were carried
out in accordance with the IRB-approved guidelines and regulations. All female
patients signed the informed consent form and were aware that their reproductive
tissues would be used in research.
Pharmacokinetic modelling of microfluidic platforms. A seven-compartment
model was simulated to estimate the kinetics of distribution of oestradiol and
other relevant factors. This model was used to set flow rates and volumes of
modules within the system to create physiologic oestradiol concentrations
and system response times of less than 1 day. The equations are shown

Microfluidic culture setting up and procedures. Prior to insertion of micro-
tissues into microfluidic culture systems, all systems were sterilized using a Sterrad
systems (Advanced Sterilization Products). Microfluidic platforms were assembled
with appropriate modules under sterile conditions. Media was sampled from the
sampling module on a daily basis and the through-system flow rate was determined
based on the media volume collected. Samples were immediately stored at
� 20 �C for later analysis. In the case of the Quintet-MFP, the actuation time of
each actuator was periodically measured using an oscilloscope. For actuation times
outside the range of 250–625 ms, the fluid path was diverted to alternate pump
pathways in order to maintain desired flow rates.
Ovary tissue collection and culture. Mouse ovaries and primary/early secondary
follicles (100–120 mm) were isolated from 45 12-day-old CD-1 female mice.
Animals were randomly used for all experiments. Only follicles that were
morphologically intact were selected for encapsulation and culture. Follicles were
placed in maintenance media containing 50% minimal essential medium
(aMEM Glutamax, Sigma-Aldrich) and 50% Nutrient Mixture (F-12 with
Glutamax, Sigma-Aldrich) with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technology) for
2 h before alginate encapsulation. Ten follicles were encapsulated by placing
follicles in the centre of a 5 ml 0.5% alginate (NovaMatrix) drop on a polypropylene
mesh and the alginate drops were immersed in the solution of 50 mM CaCl2 and
140 mM NaCl for 2 min to allow for crosslinking before transferring to the growth
media40. Ovaries were cut into four even pieces within the dissection medium for
ovarian explant microfluidic culture. Two quarters of ovarian pieces placed
on a 0.4 mm cell culture insert (EMD Millipore Co), or four alginate beads, were
seeded in each microfluidic culture module containing 700 ml growth media
(detailed below).
In order to recapitulate human 28-day menstrual cycle hormone control,
ovary and follicles were cultured over the course of 28 days, with the inclusion of
both follicular phase and luteal phase hormones. During the follicular phase
(day � 14 to day 0), ovarian explant/encapsulated follicles were cultured at
37 �C in 5% CO2 for 14 days with growth media containing 10 mIU ml � 1
recombinant FSH (from A. F. Parlow, National Hormone and Peptide Program,
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases). Growth media
consists of 50% aMEM Glutamax and 50% F-12 Glutamax supplemented with
3 mg ml � 1 BSA (MP Biomedicals), 0.5 mg ml � 1 bovine fetuin (Sigma-Aldrich),
5 mg ml � 1 insulin, 5 mg ml � 1 transferrin and 5 mg ml � 1 selenium (Sigma-Aldrich).
On day 0, cultured ovary/follicles were stimulated with maturation media for 16 h
at 37 �C in 5% CO2 in air (50% aMEM and 50% F-12 with 10% FBS, 1.5 IU ml � 1
hCG (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng ml � 1 epidermal growth factor (BD Biosciences)
and 10 mIU ml � 1 FSH). Some oocytes were collected for inspection to determine
the oocyte maturation. Oocytes were considered to progress to MII stage if
a polar body was present after in vitro maturation with hCG. During luteal phase
(day 0 to day 14), ovaries/follicles were cultured in growth media without FSH.
Media was collected every 24 h from the acceptor module of microfluidic platform,
and the flow rate and ovarian hormone production were monitored. Static cultures
were performed in parallel under the same conditions for each culture with
replacement of 50% of media volume with fresh media every 48 h, and the ovarian
explant/encapsulated follicles were randomly distributed to microfluidic and static
cultures for hormone production comparison.
Preparation of tissues for microfluidic culture. The dissection media, growth
media and maturation media used for ovarian tissue culture were used to maintain,
isolate and culture human reproductive tissues and liver tissues. Tissues were
washed twice with warm PBS containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin twice, and
then transferred into warm dissection medium. All human reproductive tissues
were received and processed within 24 h of surgery. The human fallopian tube
tissue was cut open, and the inner layer was mechanically dissected using forceps.
This layer, primarily consisting of epithelium and underlying stroma, was cut into
2 � 2 mm pieces, placed on the 0.4 mm cell culture insert (EMD Millipore Co)
and transferred to the growth media for culture. To obtain decellularized uterine
endometrium scaffolds, patient-derived tissue was treated with a combination of
sodium deoxycholate and Triton X-100, followed by nuclear digestion and
extensive rinsing in growth media. The decellularized endometrium scaffolds were
stored in PBS containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 4 �C. Received human
endometrial tissue was digested with collagenase, and the resulting stromal and
epithelial cells were cultured on two-dimensional (2D) plates without passaging for
7days. A thick suspension of endometrial cells was seeded on top of decellularized
endometrial scaffolds within the cell culture insert, and the recellularization was
allowed to occur over 8 weeks in growth media before being integrated with other
tissues. Received human ectocervix tissues were trimmed of excess stroma until
pieces were B1 mm thick. Three-millimetre biopsy punches of ectocervix pieces
were transferred to the cell culture insert for culture. The ectocervix tissues were
cultured without hormones for 2–5 days before co-cultured with other tissues.
3D InSight Human Liver Microtissues (InSphero AG) were generated from
primary human hepatocytes (1,000 hepatocytes per microtissue) and liver
non-parenchymal cells, including Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells and
hepatic stellate cells, were assembled to retain close cellular contacts and maintain
liver-specific function that most closely resembles in vivo tissue41. The liver
microtissues were encapsulated in 1% alginate hydrogels or loaded onto 3D-printed
gelatin scaffolds with 10 microtissues per alginate bead or scaffold. The gelatin
scaffolds were printed on glass slides as seven-layer thick, 15 � 15 mm squares,
with 60� advancing angles between each layer, which created a 450–500 mm pore
size. Four alginate beads or scaffolds with liver microtissues were placed on one cell
culture insert.
To recapitulate pregnant-like hormone conditions in Quintet-MFP, ovarian
tissues were continuously cultured with maturation media with an addition of
25 ng ml � 1 prolactin (Sigma-Aldrich) during the luteal phase (day 0 to day 14).
Histology. Follicles and liver microtissues cultured in vitro were fixed for 4 h at
4 �C in 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Ovary, fallopian tube, endometrium and
ectocervix were fixed in 10% formalin overnight. Tissues were dehydrated in
ascending concentrations of ethanol (50–100%) before being embedded in paraffin
using an automated tissue processor (Leica). Serial 5 mm sections were cut for
haematoxylin and eosin, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
staining.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. For oocyte spindle
morphology and chromosome alignment analysis, gametes obtained following
oocyte maturation were fixed in 3.8% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton
X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 �C. Oocytes were washed three times in
blocking solution with PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin and
0.01% Tween-20, incubated overnight in a 1:50 dilution of mouse anti-a-tubulin
(Cell Signaling Technology) in blocking solution. Then, oocytes were washed
three times with blocking solution, mounted using Vectashield containing
DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and analysed using an EVOS FL AUTO microscope
(Life Technology) in a blinded manner. For sectioned tissues, antigen retrieval was
performed using sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) in a pressure cooker for 35 min.
Slides were cooled down for another 25 min before blocking. Sections were blocked
with 10% goat serum for 1 h, before being incubated with primary antibodies.
The endometrium was incubated in antibodies against Ki67 (1:100, Abcam),
vimentin (1:400, Abcam), cytokeratin (1:200, Abcam), ER (1:75, Abcam) or
PR (1:100, Dako), and the ectocervix was incubated with antibodies against
PR (1:50, Cell Signaling) or ki67 (1:50, Abcam) overnight at 4 �C. After washing
in PBS, sections were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies
(1:500; Invitrogen) for 1 h, and visualized and imaged using Nikon E600
fluorescent microscope.
Immunoblot analysis. Cultured human fallopian tissue was homogenized in
ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol,
1% NP-40, 2 mM EDTA) with proteinase inhibitor. Equal amounts of protein
measured by the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) were loaded into
precast NuPAGE 4–12% gradient Bis-Tris. Gel electrophoresis was performed and

 proteins were dry-transferred using an iBlot system (Invitrogen) to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Life Technologies). The blots were probed with a polyclonal
anti-OVGP1 (1:1,000) antibody (LsBio) overnight at 4 �C, followed by anti-rabbit
secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; Zymed).
Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence primer (GE HealthCare
Life Sciences) and exposed using a FluorChem HD machine (Alpha Innotech).
The same blot was stripped with buffer (Thermo Scientific) and re-probed with
a monoclonal anti-a-tubulin antibody (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich), followed by an
anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
Monitoring of fallopian epithelial cilia beating. The fallopian tissues cultured
in the Quintet-MFP were removed in order to monitor cilia beating after 14 and
21 days of microfluidic culture. Movies of cilia beating were acquired using an
Andor Spinning Disk Confocal (Nikon) with 10 ms exposure time and 10 ms
readout time. Each movie was taken in 50 individual frames. The wide field
images of the fallopian tissue were acquired using an Andor Spinning Disk
Confocal with a � 100 oil objective lens.
Immunoassays. E2 and P4 were measured using commercial ELISA kits
(E2: ALPCO; P4: IBL), and researchers were blinded to the animal group allocation
when they performed ELISA to detect hormone production between microfluidic
and static cultures. The assay validation protocol included spiking blank
media with various concentrations of steroid (E2 or P4 reference preparations;
Sigma-Aldrich) across the assay range to determine recovery and parallelism
to the assay kit standard curve. Each assay included a blank media standard curve,
which was used to calculate results. The limit of quantitation (functional sensi-
tivity) was defined as the lowest concentration for which accuracy is within 20%
of expected values and the intra-assay coefficient of variation (%CV) is less than
20%, and was determined by serial dilutions of a defined sample pool. For E2,
intra-assay and inter-assay %CVs were 6.3% and 8.1%, respectively; functional
sensitivity was 10 pg ml � 1. For P4, intra-assay and inter-assay %CVs were 4.4%
and 7.8%, respectively; functional sensitivity was 0.15 ng ml � 1. Ovarian hormones
(inhibin A and inhibin B) were measured using ELISA kits provided by Ansh
Labs (Webster). Intra-assay, inter-assay CVs and functional sensitivity for inhibin
A were 5.1%, 7.3% and 12 pg ml � 1, respectively; 4.5%, 6.1% and 14 pg ml � 1,
respectively, for inhibin B; and 5.6%, 6.9% and 0.08 ng ml � 1, respectively, for
activin A; 6.9%, 8.1% and 0.34 ng ml � 1, respectively, for AMH. IL8, VEGF
(R&D Systems) and Albumin (Abcam) were measured using ELISAs. Albumin
concentrations were normalized with the respect to the initial hepatocyte cell
number and time. Intra-assay and inter-assay CVs and functional sensitivity for
IL8 were 3.0%, 6.2% and 31.2 pg ml � 1, respectively; 3.1%, 5.2% and 7.8 pg ml � 1,
respectively, for VEGF; 4.8%, 7.3% and 0.4 mg ml � 1, respectively,for albumin.
FSH and hCG were measured on the Siemens Immulite 2,000 automated
chemiluminescent immunoassay analyser. Intra-assay and inter-assay CVs and
functional sensitivity was 3.2%, 4.9% and 0.1 mIU ml � 1, respectively, for FSH;
3.1%, 4.4% and 0.5 ng ml � 1, respectively, for prolactin; 3.3%, 6.6% and
1.0 mIU ml � 1, respectively, for hCG; and 2.7%, 5.2% and 2.0 nmol l � 1,
respectively, for SHBG.
Dynamic E2 levels in the microfluidic system. To test whether the tissue secreted
hormones bound to the microfluidic materials, growth media with 15,000 pg ml � 1
E2 was added to the donor modules in Quintet-MFP, and media was collected from
both donor and acceptor modules every 1–8 h. E2 concentrations were measured as
described above.
Statistical analyses. Hormone and protein secretion were analysed from three to
five independent static cultures, Solo-MFP, Duet-MFP and Quintet-MFP micro-
fluidic cultures. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey
range test for significant difference. Categorical data were analysed by the w2-test;
if significance was observed between groups, then we applied the Fisher’s exact test.
The significance level was set at Po0.05.
