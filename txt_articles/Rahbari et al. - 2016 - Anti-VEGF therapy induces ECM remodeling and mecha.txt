 The survival benefit of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients is limited to a few months because of acquired resistance. We 
show that anti-VEGF therapy induced remodeling of the extracellular matrix with subsequent 
alteration of the physical properties of colorectal liver metastases. Preoperative treatment with 
bevacizumab in patients with colorectal liver metastases increased hyaluronic acid (HA) 
deposition within the tumors. Moreover, in two syngeneic mouse models of CRC metastasis in the 
liver, we show that anti-VEGF therapy markedly increased the expression of HA and sulfated 
glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs), without significantly changing collagen deposition. The density of 
these matrix components correlated with increased tumor stiffness after anti-VEGF therapy. 
Treatment-induced tumor hypoxia appeared to be the driving force for the remodeling of the 
extracellular matrix. In preclinical models, we show that enzymatic depletion of HA partially 
rescued the compromised perfusion in liver mCRCs after anti-VEGF therapy and prolonged 
survival in combination with anti-VEGF therapy and chemotherapy. These findings suggest that 
extracellular matrix components such as HA could be a potential therapeutic target for reducing 
physical barriers to systemic treatments in patients with mCRC who receive anti-VEGF therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Systemic chemotherapy is the main treatment option for patients with inoperable metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC). The effectiveness of chemotherapy depends on the delivery of 
the drugs into the tumor, which in turn is dependent on tumor blood perfusion (1–4). There 
is increasing evidence that the solid stress generated by proliferating cells in a growing 
tumor mass can cause compression of blood vessels and reduced perfusion (5). Components 
of the extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in the solid stress–induced blood 
vessel collapse because they transmit the mechanical stress created by proliferating cells 
within the confined space of a tumor (6). Targeting the ECM components has therefore been 
suggested as a strategy to improve perfusion, drug delivery, and, ultimately, outcomes in 
patients with solid malignancies (3, 7).
The anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab in combination 
with chemotherapy is the current standard of care for mCRC, based on an overall survival 
improvement (8). This survival benefit, however, is modest, and the disease ultimately 
progresses (9). The underlying mechanisms of acquired resistance to antiangiogenic therapy 
remain unclear (7). In part, this is a result of the limited understanding of the effects of anti-
VEGF therapy on the microenvironment of metastatic lesions. Recent preclinical studies 
have shown that antiangiogenic therapy increases collagen expression in primary tumors, as 
a consequence of increasing hypoxia (10, 11). The effect of antiangiogenic therapy on the 
expression of noncollagenous matrix components such as hyaluronic acid [also known as 
hyaluronan (HA)] or sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) in metastatic lesions is not well 
studied. As an abundant and highly hydrated matrix molecule with negatively charged chains 
that resist compression, HA has gathered increasing attention as a biologically relevant and 
potentially targetable cause of vessel compression and poor drug delivery in desmoplastic 
tumors (12–15). Recently, liver metastases from pancreatic cancer have been reported to be 
desmoplastic with high concentrations of HA and collagen that correlated with patients’ 
survival (16). Here, we investigated the effects of antiangiogenic therapy on the composition

 of the ECM, both collagenous and noncollagenous, and blood perfusion as mechanisms of 
acquired resistance to antiangiogenic therapy in liver mCRC.
RESULTS
Bevacizumab increases HA expression in human CRC liver metastases
Given the lack of data on expression of HA in human liver mCRC, we first performed 
immunohistochemical analyses of surgical specimens from mCRC patients who underwent 
metastasectomy. We found higher expression of HA in the metastases compared to that of 
the uninvolved liver parenchyma, where HA expression was restricted to the periportal fields 
(fig. S1). Next, we examined the impact of preoperative treatment on HA deposition in 49 
liver metastases resected from 43 patients (table S1). Although there was no difference in 
HA between patients with and without preoperative chemotherapy, we found significantly 
increased HA expression in liver mCRC tissues from patients treated with preoperative 
bevacizumab and chemotherapy (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1, A and B). To further confirm this 
potential effect of bevacizumab, we analyzed serial samples from patients who underwent 
multiple liver resections for CRC liver metastases and carried out intraindividual 
comparisons of HA expression. These analyses confirmed the significant increase in HA 
expression after preoperative treatment including bevacizumab (P = 0.024, paired t test), 
with relatively low intensity of staining in samples from the same patients who were 
resected at different time points without previous exposure to anti-VEGF therapy (Fig. 1, C 
and D).
Anti-VEGF therapy alters mechanical properties of murine CRC liver metastasis
Next, to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of increased HA expression after 
VEGF-targeted therapy, we used two syngeneic mouse models of liver mCRC (SL4 and 
CT26) (17, 18). The effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy was different in these models. 
Whereas treatment with B20.4-1.1 [a VEGF-blocking antibody abbreviated as B20 from 
here onward (19)] significantly prolonged survival of mice bearing liver metastatic SL4 
tumors (median survival, 14.25 versus 10.4 days; P < 0.001, log-rank test), the survival 
advantage in the CT26 model did not reach statistical significance (median survival, 13.5 
versus 12 days; P = 0.072, log-rank test) (Fig. 2A). The macroscopic appearance of the 
metastatic lesions in the anti-VEGF treatment groups was different from that seen in the 
control groups and was characterized by a stiff texture, suggesting changes in the amount 
and/or composition of the ECM. We also found that the DNA content, normalized to wet 
weight, was significantly lower in SL4 (P = 0.011) and CT26 (P = 0.023) liver mCRCs of 
mice treated with B20, suggesting a shift in the cell-to-matrix ratio (fig. S2, A and B). To 
quantify the changes in the mechanical properties of liver mCRCs after anti-VEGF therapy, 
we performed stiffness measurements using unconfined compression tests of metastases 
harvested from animals treated with B20. These experiments confirmed a dose-dependent 
increase in tumor stiffness in SL4 (P = 0.002) and CT26 (P < 0.0001) liver mCRC models 
(Fig. 2B). In addition, a recently developed method tomeasure growth-induced solid stress 
(6) revealed significantly higher solid stress in anti-VEGF–treated mCRCs. The normalized 
mean tumor opening—a measure of solid stress—increased from 0.690 to 1.506 for SL4 
tumors (P = 0.018) and from 1.830 to 5.884 for CT26 tumors (P = 0.019) (Fig. 2C). Anti-

 VEGF therapy caused >80% reduction in tumor perfusion (Fig. 2D). Together, these data 
indicate that anti-VEGF therapy (at 5 mg/kg) alters the mechanical properties of liver 
metastases by inducing tumor desmoplasia.
HA and sGAG in colorectal liver metastases increase after anti-VEGF treatment
To evaluate the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on the ECM, we first measured the relative 
abundance of the major ECM components. In line with the clinical findings of increased HA 
expression in human liver mCRCs after bevacizumab treatment, we found a threefold 
increase of HA in SL4 (0.503 ± 0.035 versus 1.766 ± 0.233 μg HA/mg tissue; P < 0.0001) 
and CT26 (0.055 ± 0.0108 versus 0.143 ± 0.014 μg HA/mg tissue; P < 0.0001) liver mCRCs 
in mice (Fig. 3A). In addition, the expression of CD44, the HA receptor, was increased in 
metastatic lesions of SL4 (P = 0.008) and CT26 (P = 0.005) tumors after anti-VEGF therapy 
(fig. S3, A and B). Moreover, we found a twofold increase in sGAG expression after anti-
VEGF therapy in both mouse models (SL4: 0.231 ± 0.022 versus 0.43 ± 0.044 μg sGAG/mg 
tissue; P = 0.0005; CT26: 0.149 ± 0.021 versus 0.277 ± 0.028 μg sGAG/mg tissue; P = 
0.001) (Fig. 3B). The increased expression of sGAG was then confirmed in liver mCRCs in 
patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab (fig. S4). 
The increase in collagen deposition was less pronounced and reached statistical significance 
only in the SL4 model (P = 0.01) (Fig. 3C), a finding consistent with the data from patients 
with liver mCRCs after preoperative chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab (20). To 
rule out the possibility that the changes in the ECM are off-target effects related to anti-
VEGF therapy, we treated non–tumor-bearing mice with B20 for 3 weeks. Histological 
analysis did not reveal obvious parenchymal changes in the liver (fig. S5A). Moreover, 
biochemical analysis of the liver tissue did not show major differences between the groups 
with respect to HA and sGAG abundance (fig. S5, B and C). We then sought to correlate the 
stiffness of the liver mCRCs with the presence of specific ECM components. We found a 
strong correlation between stiffness and tumor concentration of HA (SL4: r = 0.72; P < 
0.0001; CT26: r = 0.554; P < 0.0001) or sGAG (SL4: r = 0. 665; P < 0.0001; CT26: r = 
0.524; P = 0.0002) but no association with collagen content (Fig. 3D).
Inflammatory cell depletion does not alter HA production after anti-VEGF therapy
Immune cells, specifically CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) 
populations such as Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes (IMs), play a role in liver fibrosis, 
tumor progression, and resistance to antiangiogenic therapy, including primary liver tumors 
(11, 21–24). To evaluate the potential role of these cell populations in ECM deposition after 
anti-VEGF therapy, we performed flow cytometry analysis of tumor tissues from mice 
treated with B20 or IgG. The results demonstrate a significant influx of Ly6Chi IMs as well 
as metastasis-associated neutrophils (MANs) in SL4 liver mCRCs, at 3 days (Ly6Chi IMs: P 
= 0.016; MANs: P = 0.024, Student’s t test) and 6 days (Ly6Chi IM: P = 0.0001; MAN: P = 
0.005, Student’s t test) after initiation of anti-VEGF therapy (Fig. 4, A and B). These results 
were confirmed in the CT26 liver mCRCs (fig. S6). Flow cytometric analysis of the spleen 
tissue—a “reservoir” for tumor-associated monocytes and neutrophils (25, 26)—and 
peripheral blood cells showed that increased counts of these cells in metastases and in 
peripheral blood associated with lower counts in the spleen. These data suggested a release 
of these cell populations from the spleen into the circulation and the mCRC tissues (Fig. 4, 
Rahbari et al.

 B and C). There were no significant differences in the cell numbers in the bone marrow at 3 
days (Ly6Chi IM: P = 0.85; MAN: P = 0.81, Student’s t test) and 6 days (Ly6Chi IM: P = 
0.68; MAN: P = 0.22) after initiation of anti-VEGF therapy (fig. S7).
To further evaluate the biological relevance of these immune cell populations in liver mCRC 
response to anti-VEGF therapy, we selectively depleted these cells by using a genetically 
engineered mouse model (Ccr2−/− mice) for depletion of Ly6Chi IM and a monoclonal 
antibody against Ly6G for depletion of MANs. Liver metastases from Ccr2−/− mice had an 
83% reduction in Ly6Chi IM compared to WT mice receiving VEGF-targeted therapy (P = 
0.009, Student’s t test), whereas combined treatment with B20 and the anti-Ly6G antibody 
reduced MAN by 85% compared to B20 alone (P = 0.002, Student’s t test). Furthermore, 
depletion of one MDSC population did not result in compensatory recruitment of the other 
cell type (Fig. 4D). Biochemical analysis of liver mCRCs collected from these mice showed 
persistent enrichment of HA in mice treated with B20 despite depletion of Ly6Chi IMs 
(0.731 ± 0.132 versus 1.941 ± 0.347 μg HA/mg tissue; P = 0.004, Student’s t test) or MANs 
(0.592 ± 0.099 versus 2.445 ± 0.432 μg HA/mg tissue; P = 0.002, Student’s t test) (Fig. 4E). 
Similarly, depletion of Ly6Chi IMs (0.192 ± 0.022 versus 0.384 ± 0.042 μg sGAG/mg tissue; 
P = 0.001, Student’s t test) or MANs (0.176 ± 0.018 versus 0.393 ± 0.049 μg sGAG/mg 
tissue; P = 0.002, Student’s t test) did not abrogate the increased deposition of sGAG after 
anti-VEGF therapy (Fig. 4F). We did observe a decrease in collagen in Ccr2−/− mice (Fig. 
4G), a finding consistent with the role of Ly6Chi IMs in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis 
(24). Collectively, our results show that the accumulation of HA or sGAG in liver mCRCs 
after anti-VEGF therapy is independent of the increased tumor infiltration by MDSC 
populations.
Angiotensin II receptor 1 deletion does not affect HA expression in mCRC after anti-VEGF 
therapy
The angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling pathway is a relevant mediator of ECM 
deposition through transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) activation and a potential target 
to decrease tumor desmoplasia (27, 28). Thus, we next investigated the role of AT1 in tumor 
stiffness and increased deposition of noncollagenous matrix after anti-VEGF therapy of liver 
mCRCs. To this end, we generated SL4 liver metastases in angiotensin II type 1a receptor 
knockout (Agtr1a−/−) mice, measured tumor stiffness, and analyzed the ECM composition 
after treatment with B20 or IgG. We found a significant increase in tumor stiffness after anti-
VEGF therapy in liver mCRCs in Agtr1a−/− mice (1.11 ± 0.23 versus 5.93 ± 0.93 kPa; P = 
0.0002, Student’s t test) (fig. S8A). Similarly, we observed a significant increase in HA 
(0.49 ± 0.036 versus 2.14 ± 0.57 μg HA/mg tissue; P = 0.008, Student’s t test) and sGAG 
(0.23 ± 0.018 versus 0.402 ± 0.044 μg sGAG/mg tissue; P = 0.005, Student’s t test) (fig. S8, 
B and C) and no significant change in collagen expression (fig. S8D). In line with these data, 
the concentration of TGF-β was either decreased (in SL4 tumors, P = 0.028, Student’s t test) 
or not changed (in CT26 tumors, P = 0.15, Student’s t test) after anti-VEGF therapy (fig. S9, 
A and B). Collectively, these data indicate that the abnormal deposition of HA and GAGs 
after anti-VEGF therapy in liver mCRCs is independent of the AT1 pathway.

 Hypoxia drives HA expression in colorectal liver metastases after anti-VEGF therapy
Previous studies have shown that increased collagen deposition after anti-VEGF therapy is 
related to tumor hypoxia (10, 11). To explore the mechanisms by which HA accumulates in 
liver mCRCs after anti-VEGF therapy and to understand the temporal relationship between 
the treatment-induced increase in hypoxia and the abnormal ECM deposition, we performed 
time course experiments. These studies revealed a significant decrease of microvessel 
density after 3 days of anti-VEGF therapy (SL4: 66% reduction; P < 0.0001; CT26: 83% 
reduction; P = 0.01, Student’s t test; n = 4 to 6 per group). This effect persisted after 6 days 
in both mCRC models (SL4: 77% reduction; P = 0.0001; CT26: 93% reduction; P < 0.0001, 
Student’s t test; n = 4 to 6 per group) (Fig. 5, A and B, and fig. S10A) and was accompanied 
by an increased hypoxic area fraction in both models (Fig. 5, C and D, and fig. S10B). We 
then measured the ECM components and found only modest changes after 3 days of therapy 
in both models. However, analyses of samples obtained 6 days after initiation of B20 therapy 
showed a marked increase of HA deposition (SL4: 0.537 ± 0.088 versus 1.04 ± 0.143 μg 
HA/mg tissue; P = 0.009; CT26: 0.025 ± 0.01 versus 0.102 ± 0.021 μg HA/mg tissue; P = 
0.006, Student’s t test; n = 6 to 8 per group) and sGAG (SL4: 0.283 ± 0.031 versus 0.597 
± 0.108 μg sGAG/mg tissue; P = 0.014; CT26: 0.197 ± 0.029 versus 0.402 ± 0.054 μg 
sGAG/mg tissue; P = 0.008, Student’s t test; n = 5 to 8 per group) in liver mCRCs (Fig. 5E). 
To further investigate the link between hypoxia and HA synthesis, we then performed a 
detailed image analysis of the localization of HA expression. HA expression was 
significantly colocalized in hypoxic regions (81.54 ± 9.23% versus 18.46 ± 9.232%; P = 
0.0003, Student’s t test; n = 8 per group) (Fig. 5F), indicating that hypoxia is associated with 
HA up-regulation after anti-VEGF therapy.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary source of matrix synthesis in the liver (29). 
However, the impact of anti-VEGF therapy on HSC activation in liver mCRCs remains 
unclear. Also, the role of hypoxia in HA synthesis by HSCs is unknown. We found an 
increased amount of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)+/collagen-I+–activated, matrix-
producing HSCs in SL4 liver mCRCs after treatment with B20 (P = 0.043, Student’s t test) 
(Fig. 5G). To confirm that hypoxia mediates HA synthesis in HSC, we carried out in vitro 
studies using human HSCs cultured in normoxic versus hypoxic conditions for 48 hours. 
Hypoxia caused a 4.5-fold increase in HA expression in human HSCs (P = 0.003, Student’s t 
test) (Fig. 5H). Collectively, these results indicate that increased hypoxia is the likely driving 
stimulus for HA production by activated HSCs after anti-VEGF therapy. On the basis of the 
spatiotemporal analyses, hypoxia induced by anti-VEGF therapy appears to be the initiating 
event in this context. Then, resultant aggravation of desmoplasia compromises tumor 
perfusion further and induces a vicious cycle of hypoxia, desmoplasia, and 
immunosuppression.
Targeting HA increases perfusion and improves efficacy of chemotherapy in liver 
metastases after anti-VEGF therapy
Enzymatic targeting of HA improves vascular function and perfusion in pancreatic cancer 
(12). To investigate whether depletion of HA can prevent the changes induced by anti-VEGF 
therapy, we treated mice with B20 with or without intravenous administration of a 
polyethylene glycol conjugated (PEGylated) hyaluronidase (PEG-HAse). Treatment with

 PEG-HAse in combination with B20 resulted in a 74% reduction of HA in SL4 liver mCRCs 
compared to B20 alone (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with previous 
observations in preclinical tumor models (30). To investigate the effects of HA depletion on 
blood perfusion of liver mCRCs after anti-VEGF therapy, we measured tissue distribution of 
Hoechst 33342 dye as a blood perfusion marker (31). Combined treatment of B20 with 
PEG-HAse significantly increased tumor perfusion compared to B20 monotherapy (perfused 
area fraction, 0.211 ± 0.044 versus 0.436 ± 0.0915; P = 0.036) (Fig. 6B). Because anti-
VEGF therapy is commonly administered together with systemic chemotherapy in mCRC 
patients (32), and given the effects of HA depletion on perfusion of liver mCRCs treated 
with anti-VEGF therapy in mice, we next examined the effect of adding chemotherapy to 
anti-VEGF therapy and PEG-HAse. As expected, PEG-HAse treatment significantly 
lowered HA concentrations in SL4 liver mCRCs (P = 0.001, Student’s t test) (fig. S11). 
Furthermore, combination of PEG-HAse with B20 and chemotherapy significantly 
prolonged survival compared to B20 and chemotherapy only (median survival, 19.06 versus 
17.13 days; P = 0.008, log-rank test) (Fig. 6C). Thus, enzymatic targeting of HA could 
potentiate the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy with chemotherapy in liver mCRC.
DISCUSSION
We report a mechanism of acquired resistance to anti-VEGF therapy in liver mCRC. As 
shown in patient samples and orthotopic mouse models of liver mCRC, anti-VEGF therapy 
results in abnormal deposition of ECM components and, in particular, HA and sGAG. Our 
data suggest that increased HA expression after anti-VEGF therapy is a consequence of 
treatment-induced hypoxia and increases solid stress in liver mCRCs. Finally, we show that 
depleting HA can result in improved tumor perfusion and treatment efficacy in mouse 
models of liver mCRC.
Several mechanisms of resistance to antiangiogenic therapy have been proposed thus far (9, 
33). In particular, treatment-induced hypoxia and acidosis have multiple adverse effects on 
tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment that fuel progression and mediate treatment 
resistance (7). Besides induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal program that favors an 
invasive and metastatic tumor cell phenotype (34), hypoxia is thought to select for tumor 
cells with cancer stem cell properties that might further mediate resistance to cytotoxics, as 
well as favoring an immunosuppressive microenvironment by reducing the activity of 
cytotoxic T cells and antigen-presenting cells and by skewing the polarization of tumor-
associated macrophages toward the protumorigenic and immunosuppressive M2 phenotype 
(35–39). Increased fibrosis is another effect of hypoxia on the microenvironment of tissues 
and is dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (40). In line with these data, we also found 
an increased recruitment of immunosuppressive MDSCs after anti-VEGF therapy (41, 42). 
Although the increased infiltration of MDSCs and HA production are both driven by 
hypoxia in liver mCRC, these mechanisms appear to be independent.
We have previously demonstrated that desmoplasia affects tumor perfusion and effectiveness 
of chemotherapy by impairing vascular function (6, 27). We have also shown that ECM, 
specifically HA, in primary tumors contributes to growth-induced solid stress, and thus, 
reducing solid stress may reduce compression of tumor vessels (5, 6). Our recent studies

 showed that HA impairs vascular function and drug delivery into the tumor in animal models 
of pancreatic and prostate cancers (12, 15, 43, 44). Here, we show that increased HA 
deposition in liver metastatic lesions is an important mechanism of acquired resistance to 
systemic treatment in this setting.
Because of the uniformly elevated interstitial fluid pressure, diffusion represents the primary 
mechanism of transport within tumors, which in turn depends on the size, charge, and 
configuration of the substance being transported. In addition, the physicochemical properties 
of the ECM—a complex network built up by collagenous and noncollagenous components
—are critical determinants of interstitial transport (45, 46). Apart from their role in creation 
of intratumor solid stress, HA and sGAGs, with their negative charge and high hydration, 
function as interstitial barriers to the delivery of cancer therapeutics by forming aggregates 
and increasing viscoelasticity of the interstitial matrix (2, 47–49).
Moreover, HA and sGAG affect various intracellular signaling pathways that can promote 
tumor cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness as well as angiogenesis and stromal cell 
recruitment (50–53). In a recent study, Ropponen et al. reported the expression of HA in the 
CRC stroma as well as in the cytoplasm and/or pericellular region of cancer cells, which 
carried a poor prognosis (54). These authors confirmed these findings in other cancer types 
(55–58). There are several mechanisms of how HA can directly affect tumor cell viability 
and/or phenotype that ultimately promote disease progression and resistance to therapy. 
Interaction of HA with its specific cell surface receptors CD44 and RHAMM (receptor for 
HA-mediated motility) mediates evasion of apoptosis, particularly in anchorage-independent 
conditions (59–61), which might be explained by activation of several signaling cascades 
such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 
pathways (62, 63). In addition, HA promotes a migratory and invasive tumor phenotype, in 
part, through the production and cell surface presentation of matrix metalloproteinases and 
cytoskeletal rearrangement (64–66). These effects may collectively explain the more 
aggressive phenotype associated with increased HA in our preclinical and clinical studies of 
liver mCRC (54–56, 67–69).
Our study has several limitations. Depletion of HA in addition to chemotherapy and anti-
VEGF therapy modestly prolonged survival. Although this confirmed this study’s 
hypothesis, the results of this animal experiment should be validated in a controlled clinical 
trial designed to evaluate whether HA depletion can translate into a survival benefit in liver 
mCRC patients when using clinically relevant doses from phase 1b trials (70). On the basis 
of recent reports, HA depletion appeared more effective in patients with tumors with high 
baseline amounts of HA (70). We found a substantial variability in the increase in HA 
expression in human liver mCRC samples after anti-VEGF therapy. Although our study 
serves as a proof of principle that preventing anti-VEGF treatment–induced HA deposition 
could improve the efficacy of systemic therapy, the importance of this mechanism versus 
other mechanisms of acquired resistance remains to be determined in patients. It also 
remains to be seen whether alternative targets within the ECM can further improve the 
effects of systemic therapy in these patients. For example, direct targeting of HSCs (or 
metastasis-associated fibroblasts), the main source of ECM components within liver 
mCRCs, may offer a therapeutic strategy. Treatment with vitamin D receptor ligands might

 be another strategy to reduce or prevent the activation of HSCs (71, 72). Finally, as shown in 
Fig. 2B, the increase in stiffness and hence mechanical forces could be abrogated by using a 
lower dose of anti-VEGF antibody. This lower “vascular normalizing” dose may actually 
increase oxygenation, as demonstrated in preclinical models of breast cancer (7, 31).
In conclusion, our results show that anti-VEGF therapy at the dose used here and in the 
clinic up-regulates the expression of HA in liver mCRC both in mouse models and in patient 
samples. This may be a mechanism of acquired resistance in this setting because depletion 
of HA improved perfusion of liver mCRC in mice and their response to systemic 
chemotherapy. Thus, targeting the noncollagenous ECM is a potential strategy to enhance 
the efficacy of systemic treatments for mCRC patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the remodeling of the ECM and its 
clinical relevance in colorectal liver metastases after a VEGF-targeted therapy. The sample 
sizes of the experiments were selected on the basis of previous experience. Data collection 
was stopped at a priori defined time points. Animal experiments were performed in a 
confirmatory fashion with an a priori hypothesis without repetition. In vitro experiments 
were carried out in triplicate. Experiments were carried out in an unblinded fashion except 
for analyses of immunohistochemistry images.
Patient samples
Patient samples were obtained from the Heidelberg University Hospital. Surgical specimens 
of patients who underwent liver resection for colorectal liver metastases without 
preoperative chemotherapy, after preoperative chemotherapy without bevacizumab, or after 
preoperative chemotherapy with bevacizumab were analyzed. Analysis of human samples 
was in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. Collection of patient samples for scientific 
purposes was approved by the local ethics committee (323/2004), and written informed 
consent was obtained.
Cell and animal models
The SL4 mouse CRC cells were a gift from T. Irimura (17). The mouse CRC cell line CT26 
was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (catalog #CRL-2638). HSCs 
were purchased from ScienCell (catalog #5300). To model liver metastasis, the spleen was 
split into two sectors, and 1 × 105 cells were injected into the distal caudal sector, which was 
then resected. The other hemispleen remained in place. Tumor burden was assessed by 
measuring blood concentration of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) from Gluc-transduced tumors 
(73, 74) or using a high-frequency ultrasound imaging system (VisualSonics). Mice were 
randomly assigned to the treatment groups, and treatments were initiated after the 
development of macroscopic liver metastases (~8 to 12 days after injection). See the 
Supplementary Materials and Methods for more details.

 Treatments
The anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody B20.4-1.1 (Genentech) was administered by 
intraperitoneal injection twice a week at 5 or 1 mg/kg. For neutrophil depletion, an anti-
Ly6G antibody (clone RB6-8C5) was administered intraperitoneally every 2 days at a dose 
of 5 mg/kg. PEG-HAse (see the Supplementary Materials and Methods) was administered 
intravenously twice a week or 24 hours before administration of chemotherapy at a dose of 
4.5 mg/kg (43). 5-FU chemotherapy was administered intravenously twice a week at a dose 
of 50 mg/kg.
Histochemistry
Frozen blocks were cut at a thickness of 20 μm for immunofluorescence staining for α-
SMA, collagen-I, HA, and hypoxia. Whole-tumor mosaic images were obtained from each 
sample with an Olympus (FV1000) confocal laser-scanning microscope. Paraffin blocks 
were cut at a thickness of 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, CD34, CD44, and 
HA. For hypoxia staining, pimonidazole hydrochloride (60 mg/kg) (Hypoxyprobe) was 
injected intraperitoneally 60 min before tissue collection. For perfusion measurement, 
Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) was administered by portal infusion 5 min before tumor tissue 
collection (31). Image analyses were carried out in an automated fashion using a custom 
algorithm in MATLAB (MathWorks). See the Supplementary Materials and Methods for 
more details.
Cytometry
Tissue samples from tumors, spleen, and bone marrow were digested and filtered through 
70- and 40-μm cell strainers. Single cells were stained with CD45, CD11b, Ly6G, and Ly6C 
and analyzed using an LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). See the Supplementary 
Materials and Methods for more details.
Biochemical assays
sGAG content in finely dispersed tissues was determined by the Di-methylmethylene Blue 
Assay (DMMB) (75). Total collagen content was determined by measuring hydroxyproline 
content of the hydrolysate samples (76). Mouse HA and TGF-β1 were quantified using 
ELISA kits (R&D Systems). See the Supplementary Materials and Methods for more 
details.
Physical parameters
The stiffness (Young’s modulus) of tumors was determined by unconfined compression tests 
(77). Solid stress was determined using a recently proposed method (6). In line with this 
method, the normalized tumor opening was used as a readout for growth-induced stress. See 
the Supplementary Materials and Methods for more details.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SEM and compared using Student’s t test, one-way ANOVA, 
or two-way ANOVA when appropriate. Survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves and 
compared using the log-rank test. All tests were two-sided. Statistical analyses were carried
