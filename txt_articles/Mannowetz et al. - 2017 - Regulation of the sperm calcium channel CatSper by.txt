The calcium channel of sperm (CatSper) is essential for sperm
hyperactivated motility and fertility. The steroid hormone pro-
gesterone activates CatSper of human sperm via binding to the
serine hydrolase ABHD2. However, steroid specificity of ABHD2
has not been evaluated. Here, we explored whether steroid
hormones to which human spermatozoa are exposed in the male
and female genital tract influence CatSper activation via modula-
tion of ABHD2. The results show that testosterone, estrogen, and
hydrocortisone did not alter basal CatSper currents, whereas the
neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate exerted similar effects as pro-
gesterone, likely binding to the same site. However, physiological
concentrations of testosterone and hydrocortisone inhibited CatSper
activation by progesterone. Additionally, testosterone antago-
nized the effect of pregnenolone sulfate. We have also explored
whether steroid-like molecules, such as the plant triterpenoids
pristimerin and lupeol, affect sperm fertility. Interestingly, both
compounds competed with progesterone and pregnenolone sul-
fate and significantly reduced CatSper activation by either steroid.
Furthermore, pristimerin and lupeol considerably diminished hyper-
activation of capacitated spermatozoa. These results indicate that
(i) pregnenolone sulfate together with progesterone are the main
steroids that activate CatSper and (ii) pristimerin and lupeol can act
as contraceptive compounds by averting sperm hyperactivation,
thus preventing fertilization.

S
teroid hormones control fundamental organism functions
such as development, metabolism, inflammation, ion ho-
meostasis, and reproduction. According to the conventional
model, steroid hormones signal through a corresponding geno-
mic receptor, which upon binding to a steroid hormone initiates
the translocation of the hormone–receptor complex to the nu-
cleus. There it acts as a transcription factor by altering gene
expression, and such a process can take hours (1). However,
there is another, much faster pathway that is initiated by steroid
hormone binding to its membrane receptor on the extracellular
side of the cell. The latter signaling involves second messengers
and signal-transduction cascades, which often result in the acti-
vation of ion channels (1). The female hormone progesterone
(P4) activates the principal calcium channel of sperm (CatSper)
(2–5) and blocks the potassium channel KSper (6) via these
nongenomic pathways (7). The modulation of ion channel
functions by steroid hormones has been reported in the heart (8,
9), neurons (10–12), smooth muscle (13), and pancreatic beta
cells (14). In marine invertebrates, the sulfated steroid choles-
tane acts as a chemoattractant for sea squirt sperm, which also
happens via the nongenomic pathway (15). The latter represents
an unconventional chemoattractant for ascidian sperm, as such
factors are usually proteins or peptides and not steroids. In hu-
mans, pregnenolone sulfate (PregS), a sulfated steroid hormone
similar in structure to P4, is a nongenomic activator of the
transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 3
(TRPM3) channel in pancreatic beta cells (14). However, the
precise mechanism of this activation is unknown. Here, we
report that PregS also activates the sperm calcium channel
CatSper in a manner similar to P4 and explore the possibility of
PregS binding to the same sperm receptor as progesterone.
As spermatozoa travel through the male and female repro-
ductive tract, they are exposed to a variety of steroid hormones,
such as testosterone and estrogen. The rising levels of hydro-
cortisone (HC) in the body as a result of stress can impact fer-
tility (16) by interfering with spermatogenesis and/or sperm
functions. Therefore, we have also explored what influence tes-
tosterone, estrogen, and HC have on CatSper activation. The
structural precursor of all steroid hormones in animals is the
triterpenoid lanosterol, which is formed upon cyclization of
the linear triterpene squalene. Structurally related plant tri-
terpenoids have been shown to exhibit antifertility properties in
mice and rats. The most extensively studied plant triterpenoid is
lupeol, which is found in mangoes, grapes, and olives. It has been
shown to possess antifertility properties when orally adminis-
tered to rats, resulting in a significantly reduced number of
motile sperm (17), although the underlying mechanisms are not
understood. A plausible explanation is that lupeol blocks CatSper,
which is indispensable for sperm motility (4). Another plant tri-
terpenoid, pristimerin, which is found in Tripterygium wilfordii (also
known as “Thunder God Vine”) and Celastrus regelii, acts as a
monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor. It inhibits the hydro-
lysis of 2-arachidonoylglyceol (2-AG) to arachidonic acid (AA) and
glycerol (18). In sperm, 2-AG acts as an endogenous CatSper in-
hibitor, and 2-AG degradation is mediated by the α/β hydrolase
domain-containing protein 2 (ABHD2) in a P4-dependent man-
ner (7). Because it is likely that pristimerin, lupeol, as well as
Significance
The calcium channel of sperm—CatSper—is vital for male fer-
tility. CatSper is activated by the hormone progesterone,
but its pharmacological profile is not well studied. By exploring
steroid selectivity of CatSper activation, we found one addi-
tional agonist—pregnenolone sulfate—and the two plant-derived
inhibitors pristimerin and lupeol. By averting sperm hyper-
activation, both inhibitors can prevent fertilization, thus acting
as contraceptive agents. Additionally, by exploring CatSper reg-
ulation by endogenous steroids, we explain why CatSper is silent
within the male reproductive tract and is only activated in close
proximity to the egg. Interestingly, both testosterone and hy-
drocortisone antagonize the action of progesterone at physio-
logical concentrations, which may explain why elevated levels of
these steroids in the female organism affect fertility.

 endogenous steroids can interfere with ABHD2 activity based on
their structure similarities, we have explored the ability of these
triterpenoids and steroids to prevent CatSper activation and
fertilization.
Results
Testosterone, 17 beta-Estradiol, HC, and PregS Exert Distinct Effects
on CatSper. Progesterone (P4) and its closest analog 17-OH-P4
have been shown to trigger calcium influx into the sperm fla-
gellum (19) via activation of the sperm-specific calcium channel
CatSper (3, 5). However, CatSper specificity toward other ste-
roid hormones has not been evaluated. To reveal CatSper reg-
ulation by endogenous steroids and steroid-like molecules, we
have analyzed inward monovalent currents through CatSper
(ICatSper) of human sperm. Cells were first stimulated with either
1 μM testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), HC, or PregS alone.
Subsequently, each preexposed cell was stimulated with 1 μM
P4 in combination with the corresponding steroid (testosterone,
E2, or HC). Testosterone, E2, or HC did not alter basal CatSper
activity, whereas P4, as expected, caused a sevenfold potentiation
of inward CatSper currents (Fig. 1 A–D and Table S1). However,
coadministration of testosterone and P4 to spermatozoa, which
were preexposed to testosterone, completely prevented ICatSper
potentiation by P4 (Fig. 1 A and B and Table S1). E2 and HC
partially reduced CatSper activation by P4 to 3.6- and 4.1-fold,
when applied simultaneously with P4 (Fig. 1 C and D and Table
S1). To explore the efficiency of P4 inhibition by either testos-
terone, E2, or HC, we have determined the IC50 values for each
of them by measuring CatSper activation by 1 μM of P4 in the
presence of various concentrations of the corresponding steroid.
Human spermatozoa were first preexposed to corresponding
concentrations of either testosterone, E2, or HC. Subsequently,
cells were exposed to both the individual steroid concentration
from the first stimulus plus 1 μM P4. The respective IC50 values
were 429 ± 73 nM (testosterone; Fig. 1 F and I and Table S1),
833 ± 280 nM (E2; Fig. 1 G and I and Table S1), and 153 ± 90 nM

 (HC; Fig. 1 H and I and Table S1). These data indicate that
exposure to physiological concentrations of either testosterone
or hydrocortisone prevents CatSper activation by P4, and
therefore, human spermatozoa must be free from testosterone or
hydrocortisone influence to achieve full CatSper activation. Es-
trogen, however, requires much higher concentrations, which
are outside of the physiological range, to antagonize CatSper
activation (Fig. 1I).
In contrast to the aforementioned steroids, PregS alone stim-
ulated inward currents fourfold, which resembled ICatSper prop-
erties (Fig. 1E and Table S1). To test whether PregS-elicited
currents were identical to ICatSper, we conducted the following
experiments.
PregS Activates CatSper Channel Through a Molecular Mechanism,
Which Is Similar to the P4-Mediated CatSper Activation. To evalu-
ate whether PregS activated CatSper, we inhibited PregS-elicited
currents with 1 μM NNC 55–0396, a known CatSper inhibitor (3)
(Fig. 2 A and B and Table S2). Indeed, 1 μM NNC 55–0396 re-
duced PregS-elicited currents below basal levels indicating that
PregS is another steroid capable of activating CatSper. The po-
tentiation of ICatSper by PregS was dose-dependent, with an EC50
of 15.2 ± 5.0 nM (Fig. 2 C and D, black line and Table S2), which
is close to the EC50 obtained with P4 [7.7 ± 1.8 nM (3)]. The
serum concentration of PregS in adults reaches levels of 130 nM
(women) and 140 nM (men) (14). It is also abundant in testes,
in which the total PregS concentrations can reach 2.8 μmol/kg
(3.8 μM), whereas it drops to 0.76 μmol/kg (190 nM) in the ep-
ididymis (14). Such high PregS concentrations may result in
premature CatSper activation, while spermatozoa are still in the
male reproductive tract, which would be detrimental for sperm
fertility. Because testosterone is also abundant in the male re-
productive tract, we have explored whether it can block CatSper
activation by PregS. Human sperm cells were first preincubated
with 1 μM testosterone alone followed by 1 μM testosterone plus
various concentrations of PregS (Fig. S1). Under such condi-
tions, the EC50 of PregS increased 10-fold and reached 176.0 ±
71.0 nM, indicating that testosterone indeed interferes with
PregS activation of CatSper (Fig. 2D, red line and Table S2). In
human sperm, P4 activates CatSper indirectly via binding to and
then activating its membrane receptor ABHD2 (7). ABHD2 acts
as a serine hydrolase, thus depleting the endogenous CatSper
inhibitor 2-AG from the plasma membrane. Removal of 2-AG
subsequently leads to the opening of CatSper. To determine
whether the potentiation of ICatSper by PregS was ABHD2-
mediated, we inactivated ABHD2 by exposing human sperma-
tozoa to 2 μM methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphate (MAFP), a
serine hydrolase inhibitor (Fig. 2 E and F and Table S2). As
expected, MAFP exposure ablated CatSper activation by PregS,
whereas basal ICatSper was not affected. Taken together, these
results suggest that in addition to P4, ABHD2 can also be acti-
vated
by
PregS.
Because
both
P4
and
PregS
influence
ABHD2 activity, we tested whether these compounds compete
for the binding site. To do so, human sperm cells were stimulated
with saturated concentrations of PregS (Fig. 3A, blue trace)
followed by costimulation with a combination of saturated con-
centrations of P4 and PregS (Fig. 3 A and C, red trace and Table
S3). The experiments were repeated in the reverse order (Fig. 3
B and C and Table S3). The increase of CatSper currents by
PregS was not further potentiated upon addition of P4. The same
result was obtained when sperm cells were first stimulated with
P4 and then with a combination of P4 and PregS. These experi-
ments suggest that P4 and PregS likely compete for the same
ABHD2 binding site and that CatSper activation by PregS follows
the same mechanism as CatSper activation by P4.

PHYSIOLOGY
 The Two Plant Triterpenoids Pristimerin and Lupeol Significantly
Reduce the Activation of CatSper by Either P4 or PregS. 2-AG hy-
drolysis by monoacyl lipases, such as ABHD2, is required for
CatSper activation. The plant triterpenoid pristimerin was reported
to inhibit the activity of the ABHD-related enzyme mono-
acylglycerol lipase (MAGL) (18). If pristimerin can also inhibit
ABHD2, then sperm exposure to this compound should prevent
CatSper activation by P4 or PregS. To test this hypothesis, human
spermatozoa were stimulated with pristimerin, followed by expo-
sure to either a mixture of pristimerin and P4 or to a mixture of
pristimerin and PregS. The mere presence of pristimerin did not
affect basal ICatSper (Fig. 4A, Fig. S2 A–D, and Table S4), which
indicates that pristimerin did not target the channel directly.
However, coapplication of pristimerin with P4 or PregS signifi-
cantly reduced CatSper activation. Compared with stimulation with
P4 or PregS alone, ICatSper stimulation was reduced by 63% (pris-
timerin and P4) and by 48% (pristimerin and PregS; Fig. 4A, Fig.
S2 A–D, and Table S4). To determine the IC50 value of pristi-
merin’s inhibitory effect on CatSper activation by P4, human sperm
cells were first preexposed to various concentrations of pristimerin.
Then, cells were exposed to the respective pristimerin concentra-
tion of the first stimulus plus 1 μM P4. The IC50 of pristimerin in
the presence of 1 μM P4 was 116 ± 77 nM (Fig. 4B and Table S4).
Another pharmacologically active plant triterpenoid, which
affects sperm functions when orally administered to rats, is lupeol
(17). Comparable to pristimerin, lupeol alone did not affect basal
ICatSper (Fig. 5A, Fig. S2 E and F, and Table S5). However, ad-
ministration of lupeol with P4 or PregS led to an even stronger
inhibition of ICatSper than pristimerin. Compared with CatSper
stimulation elicited by P4 or PregS alone, CatSper currents were
reduced by 71% and 68% in combination with P4 or PregS, re-
spectively (Fig. 5A). The IC50 value of lupeol to inhibit CatSper
activation by 1 μM P4 was 109 ± 56 nM (Fig. 5C and Table S5).
Pristimerin and Lupeol Decrease Sperm Hyperactivation in the
Presence of P4. Hyperactivated sperm motility is characterized
by a highly asymmetrical bending of the sperm tail due to a
CatSper-mediated rise in flagellar calcium concentration (20).
Curvilinear velocity (VCL) is the average velocity of the sperm
head through the sperm trajectory, which increases during ca-
pacitation. A CatSper-mediated calcium rise promotes hyper-
activation and makes the sperm trajectory less linear, which results
in an increase of VCL. Capacitation increases CatSper activity,
which results in a higher percentage of sperm with hyperactivated
motility. Thus, capacitated spermatozoa tend to have higher
VCL values than noncapacitated spermatozoa (Fig. S3A and
Table S6). Because both P4 and PregS activate CatSper, whereas
pristimerin and lupeol inhibit it, we explored whether VCL val-
ues of human sperm were affected in the presence of steroid
hormones or plant triterpenoids. As expected, neither of the
compounds changed VCL values of noncapacitated sperm cells
(Fig. S3, Bottom panels and Table S6). In capacitated sperma-
tozoa, P4 stimulation increased VCL by 12%, comparable to
numbers reported earlier (7, 21), but VCL values remained un-
changed in the presence of PregS, pristimerin, or lupeol alone
(Fig. S3A, Top and Inset and Table S6). When spermatozoa were
stimulated with P4 + pristimerin or P4 + lupeol, VCL values
were reduced by 39% and 48%, respectively, in comparison with
VCL values obtained in the presence of P4, and the reduced
VCL values were comparable to those of noncapacitated cells
(Fig. S3B and Table S6). Stimulating capacitated sperm with
PregS in combination with pristimerin or lupeol decreased VCL
by 18% and 9%, respectively, compared with sperm, which were
treated with PregS alone (Fig. S3C, Top and Table S6). VCL
values of noncapacitated sperm remained unchanged under such
conditions (Fig. S3C, Bottom and Table S6). To explore whether
pristimerin and lupeol also affect basal sperm motility, we
assessed the effect of these compounds on motility of capacitated
and noncapacitated sperm cells. The number of both capacitated
and noncapacitated motile spermatozoa remained unchanged
when stimulated with either compounds (Fig. S4A and Table S7).
However, when P4 was coapplied with pristimerin or lupeol, the
percentage of motile capacitated sperm decreased by 19%, whereas
the values of noncapacitated cells did not change (Fig. S4B and
Table S7). Costimulation with PregS and pristimerin or lupeol,
however, did not result in a significant reduction of motile
capacitated or noncapacitated sperm (Fig. S4C and Table S7).
These results demonstrate that both pristimerin and lupeol have
the capacity to significantly reduce sperm hyperactivation by
blocking the P4-mediated activation of CatSper but also have a
minor effect on basal sperm motility of capacitated cells.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that testosterone, estrogen, and hy-
drocortisone alone did not activate CatSper but that they reduce
or prevent CatSper activation by progesterone (P4). In the case
of testosterone and hydrocortisone, the effects were the stron-
gest with a significant inhibition of P4-mediated CatSper stim-
ulation under physiological concentrations of either steroid. One
possibility for this effect could be that testosterone binds with a

 much higher affinity to ABHD2 than P4, thereby preventing
CatSper activation. The blood serum concentration of P4 in men
is about 2 nM (22), whereas the minimum concentration needed
for CatSper activation is 10 pM, with an EC50 of 7.7 nM (3).
Testosterone blocked CatSper activation even in the presence of
1 μM P4 with an IC50 of 429 nM, which is within the physiological
range, as testosterone concentrations reach 2 μM in the blood
plasma of men (23). CatSper can also be activated by PregS,
which can reach high concentrations in male reproductive tissues.
However, testosterone also inhibits CatSper response to PregS by
shifting its EC50 10-fold to 172 nM. Therefore, even if sperm are
exposed to elevated concentrations of PregS, high concentrations
of testosterone in the male genital tract prevent premature
CatSper activation by P4, or even PregS. It is therefore possible
that testosterone acts as an anticapacitation factor by preventing
CatSper activation until it is removed in the female reproductive
tract, presumably by chelation with albumin.
Resting serum E2 levels in women are about 110 pM, which
peak at ovulation to concentrations of around 403 pM (24).
Therefore, sperm encounter an E2-enriched milieu in the uterus
and the fallopian tube. Our results show that E2 did not alter
resting CatSper currents but that it also did not allow full
channel activation by P4. We assume that elevated levels of
E2 during ovulation render CatSper in its closed state to prevent
premature calcium influx and thus sperm activation. However,
the significantly weaker IC50 for E2 of 833 nM indicates that
E2 acts as a much less potent P4 antagonist. Right after ovula-
tion, E2 levels decrease, whereas P4 concentrations surge to
∼7 nM (24) in the blood. Because cumulus cells surrounding the
oocyte also secrete P4 (25-28), sperm travel through a P4 gra-
dient with maximal concentrations in close proximity to the egg.
It is therefore possible that P4 outcompetes E2, leading to
CatSper activation, as P4 is the natural E2 antagonist (29).
Various conditions, such as stress and elevated levels of glu-
cocorticoids, particularly hydrocortisone, are known to impair
male fertility (16) by either inhibiting spermatogenesis (30) or
reducing sperm counts and sperm motility (31). Stress and ele-
vated hydrocortisone levels can also affect female fertility. One
study shows that in women who underwent in vitro fertiliza-
tion, baseline urine cortisol levels increased from ∼230 nM to
∼500 nM (32). According to our results, hydrocortisone blocked
CatSper activation by P4 with an IC50 of 153 nM. It is therefore
possible that elevated levels of stress hormones in the female
genital tract impair not only early stages but also late stages of
sperm acquisition of their fertilizing potential, thus significantly
contributing to infertility.
Another interesting candidate among the hormones tested in
this study was the sulfated neurosteroid PregS, as it stimulates
CatSper currents via the P4-related pathway. Although signifi-
cant, the response to PregS was not as pronounced as the re-
sponse to P4 and the EC50 of PregS was twofold higher than the
EC50 of P4 [15 nM vs. 7 nM (3)]. Nevertheless, we show that
PregS acted via an ABHD2 mechanism to activate CatSper—the
same mechanism of channel activation as demonstrated for P4
(7). These findings identify PregS as the third steroid hormone to
exert nongenomic actions on CatSper apart from P4 and its close
analog 17-OH-P4 (3, 5, 33) and demonstrate the importance of
sulfated steroids to regulate physiological processes in human
sperm. Even though the concentrations of PregS in human testes
are higher than those of pregnenolone (51 μg/100 g tissue) (34),
it is unclear whether elevated concentrations of PregS exist within
the entire testis or only in specific domains. Because testosterone
inhibits the response to PregS with an IC50 of 172 nM, it will
prevent CatSper activation by PregS even if sperm cells are ex-
posed to high PregS concentrations. Interestingly, the plasma
concentration of PregS in women is about 14 nM (35). This
concentration matches the EC50 we determined for PregS to
activate CatSper. It is therefore possible that once testosterone is
removed from sperm cells within the female genital tract, both P4
and PregS can bind to ABHD2, resulting in CatSper activation.
These two compounds indeed compete for the ABHD2 binding
site(s), but further studies are needed to reveal whether PregS
and P4 act synergistically or independently to activate CatSper.
Our earlier findings identified the acylglycerol lipase ABHD2
as the P4 binding partner (7). Therefore, we tested whether the
monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor pristimerin, a plant triterpe-
noid (18), can inhibit both the P4- and the PregS-mediated ac-
tivation of CatSper of human sperm. Although basal CatSper
currents were not affected, both P4 and PregS-mediated CatSper
potentiation was significantly reduced. Lupeol, another plant
triterpenoid, had similar effects on ICatSper as pristimerin. It is
possible that both triterpenoids occupy the steroid binding site of
ABHD2, thus preventing CatSper activation by P4 via a com-
petitive antagonist-type mechanism. Both compounds were also
able to inhibit sperm hyperactivation and slightly reduced basal
motility of capacitated sperm cells, as evident from computer-
assisted sperm analyses (CASAs). Interestingly, pristimerin and
lupeol had no effect on sperm motility of noncapacitated cells,
which indicates their low toxicity effect toward spermatozoa.
These results correlate with our electrophysiological data, which
showed a significant reduction of ICatSper with pristimerin + P4
and lupeol + P4, respectively. Because CatSper is indispensable
for hyperactivated sperm motility (36–40), it is evident that the
reduction of sperm hyperactivation by both triterpenoids may
significantly impair sperm ability to fertilize an egg.
CASA experiments also revealed that although P4 increased
hyperactivated motility, PregS failed to do so. This could be due
to the fact that PregS is a charged molecule, which cannot
pass the plasma membrane (41). It is therefore possible that the
nonpolar P4 can activate additional intracellular pathways, con-
tributing to a more pronounced activation of CatSper. Indeed, for
full sperm hyperactivation in vitro, two events must be met at the
same time: (i) CatSper must be relieved from inhibition by 2-AG,
and (ii) the sperm plasma membrane needs to be depolarized.
Because CatSper is a voltage-dependent channel, it requires at least
+30 mV for half-activation (3). The latter can be achieved via the
P4-mediated inhibition of the potassium channel KSper (6), which
creates membrane depolarization required for full CatSper activa-
tion. If P4 inhibits KSper from the intracellular side, which PregS
fails to do, as it cannot cross plasma membrane, then P4 is able to
cause a more pronounced hyperactivation.
In conclusion, our findings show that apart from P4, PregS is
another steroid hormone that can activate CatSper via ABHD2
in human spermatozoa, whereas testosterone, E2, and HC may
bind to ABHD2 competitively to modulate the response to P4
and PregS. In addition, we describe two plant triterpenoids that

 can serve as promising candidates for contraception, as they reduce
the number of hyperactive spermatozoa, thus preventing sperm
from reaching and fertilizing an egg.
Materials and Methods
Reagents. Progesterone and pristimerin were purchased from Calbiochem
(EMD Millipore). MAFP was from Cayman Chemical Company, and NNC 55–
0396 was from Tocris. All other compounds were from Sigma Aldrich. Tes-
tosterone was purchased in accordance with the controlled substance pro-
tocol (CS084484), as a collaborative effort with Yuriy Kirichok (University of
California, San Francisco).
Donors and Purification of Human Ejaculated Spermatozoa. The participation of
four healthy human sperm donor volunteers was approved by the Committee
on Human Research at the University of California, Berkeley (protocol number
2013–06-5395). All donors provided informed consent. Freshly ejaculated se-
men samples were obtained by masturbation. Sperm were purified with the
swim-up technique (3) using artificial human tubal fluid solution (HTF), con-
taining (in mM) 21 Hepes, 21 lactic acid, 98 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 3 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 0.3
KH2PO4, 0.3 sodium pyruvate, and 0.2 MgSO4, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH).
Electrophysiology. All recordings were performed as described in ref. 3.
Briefly, gigaohm seals between patch pipette and spermatozoa were
formed at the cytoplasmic droplet in high saline (HS) solution containing (in
mM) 135 NaCl, 20 Hepes, 10 lactic acid, 5 KCl, 5 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4,
1 sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH), and ∼320 mOsm/L. Tran-
sition into whole-cell mode was achieved by applying suction and short
voltage pulses. For CatSper recordings, the divalent-free bath solution con-
tained (in mM) 140 Cs-methanesulfonate, 40 Hepes, 1 EDTA, pH 7.4 (ad-
justed with CsOH), and ∼325 mOsm/L. Pipettes (10–15 MΩ) were filled with
130 mM Cs-methanesulfonate, 70 mM Hepes, 3 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA,
0.5 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.4 (adjusted with CsOH), and ∼335 mOsm/L. Access
resistance was 42–60 MΩ. Cells were stimulated every 5 s, and data were
sampled at 2–5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. All experiments were performed at
room temperature and currents elicited by a voltage ramp from –80 mV to
80 mV with a holding potential of 0 mV. Data were analyzed with Clampfit
9.2 and OriginPro 9.0. To build dose–response curves, data were fitted with
the Hill-based equation: y = Imin + (Imax – Imin)/(1 + (x/IC50)k), where Imax is close
to 100% activation, Imin is close to inactivation, and k is the Hill slope factor.
CASA. Purified human spermatozoa were capacitated for 3.5 h at 37 °C and 5%
CO2 in capacitation media (HS supplemented with 15 mM NaHCO3 and 5%
BSA) as reported in ref. 7. Aliquots of the cell suspension were preincubated
for 15 min with 3 μM pristimerin or 3 μM lupeol before exposure to steroids
(3 μM progesterone or 3 μM PregS). Sperm motility was analyzed at 37 °C with
an HTM-IVOS sperm analysis system (version 12.3, Hamilton Thorne Biosci-
ences). We pipetted 10 μL of sperm suspension into a two-chamber slide
(Leja), and sperm movement of a minimum of 300 cells was recorded. Pa-
rameters measured were the four motility classes (A–D), average path velocity
(VAP, μm/s), straight line velocity (VSL, μm/s), and VCL (μm/s). Measurements
on a given day were performed in duplicates and defined as one experiment.
Data Analysis. Statistical data were calculated as the mean ± SEM, and n
indicates number of individual cells analyzed unless stated otherwise. Sta-
tistical significance (unpaired t test) is indicated by *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005,
***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.
