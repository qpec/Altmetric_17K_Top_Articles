Abstract
Colonoscopy remains the gold standard in colon cancer prevention. An adequate prep is pivotal in allowing the
colonoscopist to detect pre-cancerous lesions. Unfortunately, patients oftentimes are not adequately prepared,
ultimately limiting the exam. In addition, the prep can be cumbersome and interfere with daily activities deterring
many patients from undergoing colorectal cancer screening with colonoscopy altogether. HyGIeaCare® Prep offers
a novel alternative to oral purgative laxatives traditionally prescribed prior to colonoscopy, which allows for adequate
visualization of the colon and may ultimately lower barriers to entry for colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening
in patients who may otherwise opt not to pursue colonoscopy.

Background
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that colorectal
cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the
third most common cancer in both men and women [1]. Colonoscopy
remains the mainstay in colon cancer prevention with both diagnostic
and therapeutic capability as it allows for direct visualization and
removal of pre-cancerous polyps. Patients who undergo colonoscopy
with a suboptimal prep are at higher risk for missed lesions with
possible malignant potential. These missed lesions are thought to
account for nearly 80% of interval cancers [2]. An estimated 20-25% of
patients who present for colonoscopy are found to have an inadequate
colon cleansing at the time of exam despite taking the oral preparation
[3]. Consequences of an ineffective bowel preparation include lower
adenoma detection rates [4], longer procedural times [5], lower cecal
intubation rates [6], increased electrocautery risk, and shorter intervals
between examinations [4,6,7].
The most recent literature supports the use of several different bowel
preparations - with a split dose formulation now recommended as the
standard of care, unless the preparation is done on the same day of
colonoscopy. The inconvenience involved in the standard split dose
preparation for colonoscopy causes disruption in daily routine and
work commitments, which may ultimately lead to the patient opting
out of their colonoscopy. In addition, while oral purgative bowel preps
are generally considered safe and well-tolerated, patients and providers
should be cognizant of potential associated risks. Complications
include hypovolemia, nausea, vomiting and electrolyte disturbances
(e.g. 
hypokalemia, 
hyponatremia, 
hypomagnesemia 
and
hypermagnesemia) [8].
HyGIeaCare Prep
HyGIeaCare Prep is an emerging technology used to purge the
colon by water infusion prior to colonoscopy or where medically
indicated. With HyGIeaCare prep, patients are placed on a clear liquid
diet the day before and the day of their colonoscopy. They are
encouraged to hydrate well and to take a gentle laxative at noon and in
the evening the day before their procedure. If the patient has a history
of chronic constipation, they may be encouraged to take an additional
gentle laxative the morning of their HyGIeaCare Prep and
colonoscopy.
HyGIeaCare Prep provides an FDA cleared colon irrigation system
to replace the traditional oral prep (Figure 1). It is intended for use
when medically indicated, such as before radiological or endoscopic
examination. The HyGIeaCare Prep is private, low-pressure, warm
water, odorless, well tolerated and effective.

 The HyGIeaCare System is manually disinfected by flushing the
entire system with a chlorine disinfectant solution before and after
each patient. The system includes disposable tubing and a sterile,
disposable rectal nozzle intended for single use only.
Figure 2:
Figure 2: HyGIeaCare procedure.
The HyGIeaCare® procedure is performed by a practitioner
specifically trained on the safe use of the system. The patient is seated
on the disinfected basin (① in Figure 2) and a sterile, disposable
nozzle (② in Figure 2) is introduced into his/her rectum. A gentle
stream of warm water then flows into the bowel, loosening stool,
allowing the patient to comfortably and discreetly evacuate his/her
colon. Water continues to flow and gently cleans the colon (③ in
Figure 2) until the practitioner instructs the patient on completion of
the procedure, which routinely takes less than an hour.
Safety features of the HyGIeaCare® system
The HyGIeaCare System encompasses the following safety features:
Gently arched rectal nozzle, with a diameter of less than 1 cm
Water flows through a sediment and UV filter
Water flows gently, driven only by gravity
Temperature of the water is steadily maintained
Water automatically stops flowing into the patient if temperature of
the water exceeds the safe range of 99°-103°F (37°-39°C).
HyGIeaCare Centers are strategically located in close proximity to
busy gastroenterology practices. Once the physician's order for a
HyGIeaCare Prep is provided, the scheduler provides the patient with
an information brochure and coordinates a time for treatment with the
HyGIeaCare Center. The prep takes an average of 40 minutes; the
expected time a patient will spend in the HyGIeaCare Center is 1 hour
and 15 minutes. The patient is seated on a sanitized basin. A sterile,
disposable nozzle is introduced approximately 1 inch into the rectum.
A gentle stream of warm water will flow into the bowel, loosening
stool, allowing the patient to comfortably and discreetly evacuate their
colon. Water will continue to flow gently until the water is clear. The
certified technician will assist with noting the excrement progression-
formed stool to clear water.
The timing of the HyGIeaCare Prep is coordinated with the timing
of the scheduled colonoscopy to ensure the patient will arrive at the
colonoscopy center within the appropriate window. Optimally, the
HyGIeaCare Prep will be completed within 2 hours of the planned
colonoscopy start time. The HyGIeaCare Center is staffed with a nurse
manager and certified technicians to guide the patient through the
process. A medical director oversees each HyGIeaCare Center. 
The use of HyGIeaCare® Prep is increasing rapidly since inception
(Austin TX-Sept 2015; Norfolk VA-Feb 2016; Dallas TX-April 2016;
Phoenix AZ-May 2016) with approximately 2,000 patients having
undergone HyGIeaCare Prep prior to their colonoscopy to date.
HyGIeaCare Preparation Results
The preps of the first 791 consecutive patients (referred to the
HyGIeaCare Center in Austin, TX, by the group of physicians from
Austin Gastroenterology, Austin, TX) were scored by 26 different
colonoscopists characterizing each prep as adequate (defined as
visualization of the colonic mucosa to exclude polyps >6 mm3) vs.
inadequate. Of the 791 preparations, 766 (97%) were recorded as
adequate and 25 (3%) were recorded as inadequate.
The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) is a reliable and
validated measure of bowel preparation, often used for colonoscopy-
oriented research [9]. It relies on the summation of three individual
colonic segment scores (ascending, transverse, descending) to indicate
the degree of bowel visualization, with a score of >2 defined as an
adequate preparation [9].
Total BBPS scores have been associated with clinical outcomes such
as polyp detection rates, recommendations for repeat procedures, and
colonoscope insertion and withdrawal times (Figure 3) [10].
A subset of 739 patients who underwent HyGIeaCare preparation
prior to colonoscopy was graded using the BBPS. The median colon
cleanliness was rated as a 9 with an average of 7.96; 94% scored
adequate (>6 as demonstrated in Table 1).

Patient satisfaction and validation of the hygieacare value
proposition
In order to assess the perceived value of the HyGIeaCare Prep and
the patient’s satisfaction with the process, a survey was conducted
where each patient treated at the center was given a feedback form to
provide information on their individual experience. A total of 859
patients (60%) completed the questionnaire. 95% of these patients
stated that they preferred use of HyGIeaCare prep over the standard
oral prep and would be willing to pay for the HyGIeaCare prep rather
than perform the standard oral prep (patient’s paid for their
HyGIeaCare prep out of pocket, but in many cases this amount was
charged to their Health Savings Account) owing largely in part to
simplicity, comfort, and convenience.
HyGIeaCare safety
To date, there have been no serious adverse events in patients
referred by their gastroenterologist who underwent HyGIeaCare Prep
in the U.S.
All known adverse events have been classified as minor according to
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4),
the most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, generalized
weakness, and rectal abrasions [11]. It should be noted, however, that
in the study by Professor Michel Delvaux at the University Hospital in
Strasburg, France, patients who underwent the standard oral prep
experienced more nausea (statistically significant) compared to
HyGIeaCare Prep, whereas rectal abrasions unique to the HyGIeaCare
Prep arm of the study were clinically insignificant. No changes in
electrolytes were noted [12].
Over-distention of the colon occurring with colonoscopy has the
potential for perforation, with reported rates ranging from 0.05% to
0.3% in large studies [13-15]. The right colon is more susceptible to
barotrauma-induced perforation due to compliance, i.e. as the
intraluminal pressure increases so does the diameter of the right colon
at a higher rate compared to the left colon. Human cadaveric studies
evaluating the safety of sustained intraluminal pressures found that the
upper limit of safety was approximately 80 mmHg (equivalent to 1.55
psi) [16]. Given that a large volume of water was being infused per
rectum, the hydrostatic pressure effect with HyGIeaCare prep has been
investigated. Recognizably, this system is an open system whereby the
water and stool effluent return is via the rectum without resistance.
Calculated pressures of water infused during the HyGIeaCare Prep
found that pressures do not exceed 1.20 psi. No colon barotrauma type
changes have been noted in any of the 2,000 patients who have
undergone HyGIeaCare prep to date.
Conclusion
HyGIeaCare Prep represents a paradigm shift from the standard per
oral purgative laxatives traditionally prescribed prior to colonoscopy.
This innovative approach provides a safe and highly effective
preparation, a requisite for performance for high quality colonoscopy
and detection of colonic lesions. Patient satisfaction is universally high
with 95% of patients willing to pay for a HyGIeaCare prep in the
future, 
despite 
the 
additional 
charge. 
Integration 
into 
a
gastroenterology practice is fluid with scheduling of the colonoscopy
coordinated with the time of the HyGIeaCare Prep, so as to allow
prompt and timely arrival of all patients to the colonoscopy suite.
By providing options to what otherwise might be barriers
specifically related to the intolerance or refusal to take oral purgatives,
HyGIeaCare Prep offers a new exciting advance in colonoscopy
preparation. It is expected that the use of the HyGIeaCare Prep will
clearly lower these barriers to entry for colonoscopy for colorectal
cancer screening.
Since commencing operations in 2015, 4 HyGIeaCare Centers have
been established in the U.S. (Austin, TX; Norfolk, VA; Dallas, TX;
Gilbert, AZ). Additional information can be found on the company
