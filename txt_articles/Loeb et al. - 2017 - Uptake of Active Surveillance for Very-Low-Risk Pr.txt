IMPORTANCE Active surveillance is an important option to reduce prostate cancer
overtreatment, but it remains underutilized in many countries. Models from the United States
show that greater use of active surveillance is important for prostate cancer screening to be
cost-effective.
OBJECTIVES To perform an up-to-date, nationwide, population-based study on use of active
surveillance for localized prostate cancer in Sweden.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study in the National Prostate Cancer
Register (NPCR) of Sweden from 2009 through 2014. The NPCR has data on 98% of prostate
cancers diagnosed in Sweden and has comprehensive linkages to other nationwide
databases. Overall, 32 518 men with a median age of 67 years were diagnosed with
favorable-risk prostate cancer, including 4693, 15 403, and 17 115 men with very-low-risk
(subset of the low-risk group) (clinical stage, T1c; Gleason score, �6; prostate-specific antigen
[PSA], <10 ng/mL; PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/cm3; and <8-mm total cancer length in �4
positive biopsy cores), low-risk (including all men in the very-low-risk group) (T1-T2; Gleason
score, �6; and PSA, <10 ng/mL), and intermediate-risk disease (T1-T2 with Gleason score,
7 and/or PSA, 10-20 ng/mL).
EXPOSURES Diagnosis with favorable-risk prostate cancer.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Utilization of active surveillance.
RESULTS The use of active surveillance increased in men of all ages from 57% (380 of 665)
to 91% (939 of 1027) for very-low-risk prostate cancer and from 40% (1159 of 2895) to 74%
(1951 of 2644) for low-risk prostate cancer, with the strongest increase occurring from 2011
onward. Among men aged 50 to 59 years, 88% (211 of 240) with very-low-risk and 68%
(351 of 518) with low-risk disease chose active surveillance in 2014. Use of active surveillance
for intermediate-risk disease remained lower, 19% (561 of 3030) in 2014.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Active surveillance has become the dominant management
for low-risk prostate cancer among men in Sweden, with the highest rates yet reported and
almost complete uptake for very-low-risk cancer. These data should serve as a benchmark to
compare the use of active surveillance for favorable-risk disease around the world.

 L
ow-risk prostate cancer has a prolonged natural history
and can be safely managed with active surveillance and
selective, deferred use of curative treatment. Despite
this, recent US studies have reported that most low-risk pros-
tate cancer is managed with immediate curative treatment,1
often reducing quality of life. Moreover, a recent modeling
study showed that prostate cancer screening is generally not
cost-effective based on current US treatment patterns but
would be cost-effective if low-risk prostate cancer were man-
aged conservatively.2 Although Sweden does not have a na-
tionalscreeningprogram,morethan50%ofSwedishmenaged
55 to 69 years have been exposed to prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) screening.3,4
Our group previously reported increasing use of active sur-
veillance in Sweden through 2011.5 The goal of the present
study is to perform an updated analysis of nationwide use of
active surveillance using comprehensive, population-based
Swedish data through 2014.
Methods
The National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) includes 98%
of all prostate cancer cases in Sweden.6,7 Designated staff at
each health care unit extract data on cancer features and treat-
ment from the medical records to an online registration in
NPCR and have distinguished “watchful waiting” from “ac-
tive surveillance” since 2007. In addition, the Longitudinal In-
tegrationDatabaseforHealthInsuranceandLaborMarketStud-
ies provided socioeconomic data, and the Patient Register
provided information on comorbidities.7
The Umeå University Research Ethics Board approved the
study, waiving patient written informed consent.
Descriptive statistics and the Mann-Kendall test for trend
based on the Kendall rank correlation were used to examine
active surveillance utilization from 2009 through 2014 by age
and clinical risk category, classified as very-low-risk (clinical
stage,T1c;Gleasonscore,≤6;PSA,<10ng/mL;PSAdensity<0.15
ng/mL/cm3; and <8-mm total cancer length in ≤4 positive bi-
opsy cores8), low-risk (T1-T2; Gleason score, ≤6; and PSA, <10
ng/mL), and intermediate-risk disease (T1-T2 with Gleason
score, 7 and/or PSA, 10-20 ng/mL). Subset analysis was per-
formed for intermediate-risk cancer with Gleason, 6 and PSA,
10-20 ng/mL, and Gleason, 7 (3 + 4) and PSA less than 10ng/
mL,andusingalternateriskclassifications(CAPRAscores[Can-
ceroftheProstateRiskAssessment],Epsteincriteria,andPRIAS
criteria [Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Sur-
veillance]). Multivariable logistic regression was performed
within clinical risk categories to determine predictors of ac-
tive surveillance, including variables not used in the risk cat-
egorization. All P values were 2 sided and P < .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
Between 2009 and 2014, 32 518 men, median age of 67
years, were diagnosed with favorable-risk prostate cancer
(Table). Use of active surveillance and watchful waiting
increased from 64% to 93% for very-low-risk disease, 50% to
79% for low-risk disease, and decreased from 26% to 25% for
intermediate-risk cancer from 2009 to 2014. Use of active
surveillance increased from 57% to 91% for very-low-risk
cancer and from 40% to 74% for low-risk cancer (P < .001 for
all comparisons), whereas use of watchful waiting decreased
over time (Figure). The greatest increase in active surveil-
lance for very-low-risk and low-risk cancer occurred after
2011. Classifying men using CAPRA scores, we found that
active surveillance increased from 17% to 62% in men with
CAPRA 0, 50% to 85% in CAPRA 1, 33% to 55% in CAPRA 2,
and 22% to 29% in CAPRA 3. In men with CAPRA scores
higher than 3, use of active surveillance was relatively stable
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Active surveillance increased over time in all age groups
(<60, 60-69, and ≥70 years) (Figure). In men with very-low-
risk cancer, active surveillance increased from 44% to 88% in
those aged 50 to 59, from 64% to 95% in those aged 60 to 69
years, and from 53% to 84% in those aged 70 years or older. In
men with low-risk disease, active surveillance also in-
creased, from 30% to 68% among those aged 50 to 59 years,
from 43% to 79% in those aged 60 to 69 years, and from 44%
to 67% in those aged 70 years or older. Even among men
younger than 50 years, active surveillance increased, to 89%
and 43% among men with very-low-risk and low-risk disease
by 2014. Using the Epstein and PRIAS criteria for active sur-
veillance yielded almost identical results, 93% and 90%, re-
spectively,comparedwith91%bytheNPCRvery-low-riskdefi-
nition (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Active surveillance use among men in the intermediate-
risk category remained low during the entire study period.
However,useofactivesurveillanceincreasedfrom31%in2009
to 53% in 2014 in the intermediate-risk subset with Gleason,
6 and PSA, 10 to 20 ng/mL. Use of active surveillance re-
mained low in those with Gleason, 7 (3 + 4) and PSA, less than
10 ng/mL (17% in 2014) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Within each clinical risk category, later year of diagnosis,
diagnosis at a university hospital, older age, and status of not
currently married were associated with the use of active sur-
veillance, while comorbidity and educational level were not
associated.
Key Points
Question What is the uptake of active surveillance for
favorable-risk prostate cancer in a population-based setting?
Findings Using nationwide data from Sweden, this study found a
significant increase in the use of active surveillance over time. By
2014, 91%, 74%, and 19% of patients with very-low-risk, low-risk,
and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, respectively, were managed
with active surveillance.
Meaning Active surveillance has become the dominant
management strategy for low-risk prostate cancer among men in
Sweden, with the highest rates yet reported and almost complete
uptake for very-low-risk cancer.

 Discussion
This population-based study shows the highest uptake of ac-
tive surveillance ever reported: by 2014, 91% of Swedish men
diagnosed with very-low-risk prostate cancer and 74% with
low-risk disease initiated active surveillance. This use of ac-
tive surveillance is substantially higher than that reported in
theUnitedStates.1,9,10Potentialfacilitatingfactorsfortherapid
uptake of active surveillance in Sweden include 2007 na-
tional guidelines recommending active surveillance for men
with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy of 10 to 20
years. In 2014, the 20-year upper limit for life expectancy was
abandoned, and active surveillance was recommended for all
men with very-low-risk prostate cancer. Importantly, NPCR
providesreal-timefeedbacktounitsontheiradherencetothese
national guidelines and also in annual reports publicly avail-
able online.11,12 The creation in 2010 of 6 regional cancer net-
works,supportingcancerservicesfromprimarytotertiarycare,
likely also increased adherence to the guidelines. The Swed-
ish health care system is dominated by equal-access, tax-
funded care without financial incentives for clinicians to rec-
ommend curative treatment. Furthermore, there may also be
cultural differences in attitudes toward conservative manage-
ment between Sweden and other countries such as the United
States with lower use of these strategies. However, use of con-
servative management in the United States also rapidly in-
creased from 2010 through 2013, suggesting more wide-
spread acceptance worldwide.
A limitation of our study is that the interpretation of the
definition of active surveillance among some clinicians be-
came less stringent for men 70 years or older, indicated by the
fact that more than twice as many men younger than 70 years
on active surveillance underwent a repeat biopsy compared
with men 70 years or older (eTable in the Supplement).
Another limitation is that our study does not include fol-
low-up data on active surveillance outcomes. However, the ob-
jective was to study initial treatment selection by contempo-
rary cases, and our group previously demonstrated that the
majority of Swedish men on active surveillance had not con-
verted to curative treatment at 5 years.13
A strength of our study is that, unlike data from US regis-
tries that do not differentiate active surveillance from
watchful waiting or low-risk from very-low-risk prostate
cancer,1,9 the Swedish NPCR provides population-based data
on all of these features, and in addition, provides informa-
tion on potential confounders including socioeconomic sta-
tus and comorbidity from other nationwide databases. To
our knowledge, there are no other reports from Europe on
nationwide active surveillance use except our group’
s earlier
Swedish data.5
Conclusions
In summary, active surveillance can preserve the benefits of
screening while minimizing harm caused by overtreatment of
indolent cancer.2 The Göteborg randomized prostate cancer

Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer—
An Evolving International Standard of Care
Matthew R. Cooperberg, MD, MPH
In2016,activesurveillancehasfinallybecomestandardofcare
for low-risk prostate cancer in the United States. Recent ar-
ticles from prospective, community-based registries have
shown uptake of active surveillance skyrocketing to 40% to
50% for low-risk disease in
the current decade, up from
rates that historically rarely
exceeded 10%.1,2 A growing body of evidence indicates that
active surveillance can preserve quality of life without pos-
ing substantial short- to intermediate-term oncologic risk.
Based on this evidence, a recent guideline endorsed by the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) now clearly
states that surveillance is not merely an option for men with
low-risk disease but rather is the preferred alternative for any
clinically localized, Gleason 3 + 3 cancer.3
