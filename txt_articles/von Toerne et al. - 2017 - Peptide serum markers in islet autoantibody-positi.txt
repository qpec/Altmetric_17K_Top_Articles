Abstract
Aims/hypothesis We sought to identify minimal sets of serum
peptide signatures as markers for islet autoimmunity and pre-
dictors of progression rates to clinical type 1 diabetes in a
case–control study.
Methods A double cross-validation approach was applied
to first prioritise peptides from a shotgun proteomic ap-
proach in 45 islet autoantibody-positive and -negative chil-
dren from the BABYDIAB/BABYDIET birth cohorts.
Targeted proteomics for 82 discriminating peptides were
then applied to samples from another 140 children from
these cohorts.
Results A total of 41 peptides (26 proteins) enriched for the
functional category lipid metabolism were significantly differ-
ent between islet autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-
negative children. Two peptides (from apolipoprotein M and
apolipoprotein C-IV) were sufficient to discriminate
autoantibody-positive from autoantibody-negative children.
Hepatocyte growth factor activator, complement factor
H, ceruloplasmin and age predicted progression time to
type 1 diabetes with a significant improvement compared
with age alone.
Conclusion/interpretation Distinct peptide signatures indicate
islet autoimmunity prior to the clinical manifestation of type 1
diabetes and enable refined staging of the presymptomatic
disease period.

Introduction
The development of type 1 diabetes includes an asymptomatic
period of autoimmunity identified by the presence of islet
autoantibodies, with subsequent progression to dysglycaemia
and clinical diabetes [1]. While the development of islet auto-
antibodies is most prominent around 1–2 years of age [2–4],
the incidence of clinical diabetes appears to be relatively con-
stant in multiple islet autoantibody-positive children and ado-
lescents [5]. Biomarkers and genetics that are associated with
islet autoimmunity are of interest for elucidating pathogenesis,
and biomarkers that predict the rate of progression [6–10] may
improve staging the presymptomatic disease period of type 1
diabetes.
Proteomics has been used to identify biomarkers in diverse
diseases such as cardiovascular diseases [11], prostrate and
other cancers [12, 13], Parkinson’s disease [14] and metabolic
disorders [11, 15]. In type 1 diabetes, previous proteomic bio-
marker screening studies have compared patients with type 1
diabetes to autoantibody-negative control participants [16–18]
and identified protein signatures correlated with clinical dis-
ease. A recent longitudinal study in Finland compared islet
autoantibody-positive children with autoantibody-negative
children, and identified a protein signature that distinguished
between healthy children and those with autoimmunity [19].
Here, we applied proteomics to our cohorts of children
followed from birth to islet autoimmunity and clinical diabetes
in order to search for signatures associated with islet autoim-
munity, and which could help predict the progression rate to
clinical diabetes in multiple autoantibody-positive children.
Methods
This study was performed using sera from children participat-
ing in either the BABYDIAB [20] or BABYDIET [21] stud-
ies. These birth cohort studies enrolled children with a family
history of type 1 diabetes and are prospectively monitoring the
natural history of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes.
Together, they have enrolled 2441 children [20, 21]. By
November 2014, 124 children had developed multiple islet
autoantibodies and 82 of these children had progressed to
clinical type 1 diabetes [22].
Islet autoantibodies were measured using radiobinding as-
says as previously described [8, 20]. The antibody assays were
evaluated in the Diabetes Autoantibody Standardization
Program (Laboratory 121) [23–25]. Diabetes was diagnosed
according to the ADA Expert Committee criteria [26]. Both
studies were approved by the ethics committee of Bavaria,
Germany (Bayerische Landesärztekammer No. 95357 and
Ludwig-Maximilians University No. 329/00, respectively),
and adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Sample selection and study design The analysis was per-
formed in two phases: a peptide-selection phase in which
shotgun proteomics was performed to identify peptides of
potential interest, which were then measured by targeted pro-
teomics in a second application phase (Fig. 1 and electronic
supplementary material [ESM] Fig.1). For the selection phase,
we applied shotgun proteomics to samples from children who
developed islet autoantibodies and progressed to clinical diabetes
within 3.5 years (‘rapid’ progression: 15 children; median
follow-up from seroconversion 1.9 years, interquartile range
[IQR] 1.0–2.9 years, range 0.5–3.3 years) or ≥9.5 years (‘slow’
progression: 15 children; median follow-up from seroconversion
14.5 years, IQR 12.9–15.5 years, range 9.5–17.4 years), and
from 15 children who remained islet autoantibody-negative (me-
dian follow-up from birth 15.9 years, IQR 14.2–17.4 years, range
5.9–21.7 years) matched for sex and age (Fig. 1). Two sample
times were separately analysed. Specifically, one sample from
each child was obtained shortly after seroconversion to the first
islet autoantibody (median 0.8 years, IQR 0.3–1.4 years; sample
set 1) or at the corresponding age in islet autoantibody-negative
children, while the other sample was obtained at a later time
(median 1.2 years after the first sample, IQR 0.8–2.9 years; sam-
ple set 2). Four children were excluded from sample set 2 in
the selection phase because they had already progressed to
overt diabetes by the time the second sample had been
collected after seroconversion.
For the application phase, we randomly selected 70 of
the remaining children who developed islet autoantibodies
(median age 3.2 years, median follow-up time 12.8 years,
IQR 9.6–16.6 years) and 70 sex- and age-matched islet
autoantibody-negative children (median age 3.1 years,
median follow-up time 10.8 years, IQR 7.2–14.4 years)
(Fig. 1).
We performed targeted proteomics on the peptides that
discriminated between groups in the selection phase (see
detailed description below). Samples from the 70 islet
autoantibody-positive children were obtained shortly after
288
Diabetologia (2017) 60:287–295
 seroconversion (median 1.0 years, IQR 0.5–1.3 years;
Fig. 1) and 60 children were multiple islet autoantibody-
positive at the time of proteomics measurement.
Sample preparation for MS Plasma samples were depleted
from highly abundant proteins and proteolysed with trypsin as
previously described [27]. All samples were randomly distrib-
uted into one of three batches for processing, and the experi-
menters were blinded to the sample-group allocation during
the experiment. For quality control of depletion, digestion and
MS measurements, each sample was spiked with ribulose-1,5-
bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Sigma Aldrich,
Taufkirchen, Germany) at a final amount of 50 fmol in each
10 μl serum sample. After digestion, samples were stored at
−80°C until further use.
Non-targeted liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-
MS/MS) and label-free quantification LC-MS/MS analyses
were performed as previously described [28] on an LTQ-
Orbitrap XL instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich,
Germany) operated with an RSLC system (Ultimate 3000,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RAW files (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) were analysed using the Progenesis LC-MS soft-
ware (version 4.0; Nonlinear Dynamics, Waters, Eschborn,
Germany), as previously described [27, 29].
Targeted LC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring
(SRM) Skyline software (MacCoss Lab Software, Seattle,
WA, USA) was used to create the SRM assays [30]. We de-
veloped and optimised an SRM assay if at least one peptide
per protein satisfied the quality criteria defined using the
AuDIT algorithm [31] for reproducible and reliable SRM
measurement. Isotope-labelled, synthetic peptides (heavy
peptides; PEPotec; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ulm,
Germany) were used as internal controls for correct signal
integration and relative quantification. The heavy peptide
mix was added to the digested sample before the MS
measurement.
SRM-MS analyses were performed on a Tempo Nano
MDLC system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, OH, USA)
coupled online to a triple quadrupole QTrap4000 (AB SCIEX,
Framingham, MA, USA) MS equipped with a nanospray ion
source [27]. During the MS measurements, the preselected
proteotypic peptides were fragmented and the areas under the
chromatographic curves of the resulting transitions formed
the basis of the SRM quantifications.
Processing of SRM data SRM data were processed using the
Skyline software as previously described [15]. Briefly, after
manual quality control, heavy to light peptide ratios were
calculated on fragment levels, log2 transformed and
corrected for batch effects by linear regression, followed
by averaging fragment values to peptides. The peptide
values were normalised against control protein peptides
and are referred to as adjusted intensities. Peptides with
unreliable signals (>20% of measurements below the limits
of quantification per peptide) were removed, resulting in
robust SRM assays for 82 peptides covering 50 proteins
(ESM Table 1).

 rank-sum test), we assessed group differences in both sample
sets (one collected shortly after seroconversion and one col-
lected at a later time point) between: (1) islet autoantibody-
positive vs autoantibody-negative children; (2) autoantibody-
negative children vs slow progressors; (3) autoantibody-
negative children vs rapid progressors; and (4) slow vs rapid
progressors. Multiple hypothesis testing was corrected for by
controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05.
A double cross-validation (dCV) approach was then used
to identify multivariable predictive protein and peptide signa-
tures for the same eight comparisons (two sample sets and
four group comparisons each). This approach selected a min-
imal combination of peptides that provided high discrimina-
tive accuracy, and estimated an unbiased, non-over-fitted
AUC [32]. A detailed explanation of the approach and the
parameter settings used in our study can be found in the
ESM Method.
Peptides occurring with at least 75% selection frequency in
at least one of the eight comparisons were compiled into a
candidate ‘selection’ list. To maximise our coverage, this list
was extended by 14 peptides that were reported in a recent
proteomics study [17].
Statistical analysis in the application phase In the applica-
tion phase, we tested for differences in peptide levels between
islet autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative chil-
dren using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. To model the time from
seroconversion to type 1 diabetes, we fitted univariate Cox
regression models within the islet autoantibody-positive sam-
ples. Multiple hypothesis testing was corrected for by control-
ling the FDR at 0.05. Highly correlated peptides were identi-
fied using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
We again applied the dCV algorithm to find multivariable
peptide signatures discriminating between islet autoantibody-
positive and autoantibody-negative samples. A modified ver-
sion of this algorithm that used Cox models instead of classi-
fication models was then applied to identify a predictive sig-
nature of progression time within the autoantibody-positive
children. For the dCV analyses in the application phase, we
also included age as an explanatory variable. Details on the
dCV approach in the application phase can be found in the
ESM Method.
Peptides with a selection frequency of at least 50% were
used to fit a final Cox model, yielding progression time risk
scores for each autoantibody-positive individual in the appli-
cation set. These scores were divided into low-, medium- and
high-risk tertiles. Differences in the survival curves between
the tertiles were assessed using logrank tests. In order to in-
vestigate the improvement in discrimination conferred by the
selected peptides in addition to age, a Cox model containing
only age was compared with the combined model by
ANOVA. In addition, the discrimination performance over
time of the combined model and of age alone was evaluated
using the survival AUC measure [33]. As an overall measure
of discrimination, an integrated AUC was calculated.
All analyses were performed using R version 3.2.0 (www.
r-project.org).
Enrichment analysis GeneRanker software (Genomatix soft-
ware suite V3.5; Genomatix, Munich, Germany) was used to
evaluate protein enrichment. Gene symbols for the respective
proteins were used as identifiers. Gene ontology enrichment
was calculated by comparing all significantly different
proteins identified in the application phase as discriminating
between islet autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative
children against all proteins identified in plasma in the discov-
ery phase. Redundancies in enriched terms for biological pro-
cesses were curated manually.
Results
Shotgun proteomics identified tryptic peptides, which dis-
criminated between autoantibody statuses and progres-
sion rates Shotgun proteomics of serum samples from the
selection group resulted in the quantification of 2021 tryptic
peptides (covering 204 proteins) in the first sample set and
2996 tryptic peptides (243 proteins) in the second sample
set. A total of 215 peptides (covering 106 proteins) were se-
lected by the dCV approach for discrimination in at least one
between-group comparison (islet autoantibody-positive vs
autoantibody-negative; slow vs rapid; autoantibody-negative
vs slow; and autoantibody-negative vs rapid). Of these, 169
peptides overlapped between the first and second sample sets
and were evaluated for SRM development.
Robust SRM assays were developed for 82 peptides (cov-
ering 50 proteins; ESM Table 1). These included 14 peptides
that were added from a previous study [17] but were not se-
lected as significant in the selection phase of this study (ESM
Table 1).
Application phase: targeted proteomic analyses for dis-
criminating between islet autoantibody-positive and
autoantibody-negative children In univariate analysis, the
abundance of 26 proteins (represented by 41 peptides) differed
significantly between autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-
negative children (Table 1; ESM Fig. 2). Eight of those proteins
(represented by 14 peptides) overlapped with findings from pre-
vious studies [16–19] (Table 1). This included four of the 14
peptides that were tested in our study because they had been
identified in a previous study [17] (Table 1). Pearson’s correlation
test revealed several correlated peptides. As expected, the highest
correlations were observed for peptides belonging to the same
protein, indicating a high reliability of SRM measurements
(ESM Fig. 3). Peptides representing proteins belonging to the
same protein family, such as apolipoproteins (APOs), also
290

 showed highly correlated abundance patterns (ESM Fig. 3).
Gene ontology enrichment analysis recovered a significant accu-
mulation of differentially abundant proteins in terms associated
with lipid metabolic processes and homeostasis, indicative of
changes in lipid metabolism (ESM Table 2).
The multivariable dCV method selected two peptides,
SLTSCLDSK from APOM and ELLETVVNR from
APOC4, to discriminate between islet autoantibody-positive
and autoantibody-negative children (Fig. 2, Table 2) and
yielded an unbiased median AUC of 0.77 (IQR 0.75–0.78).
Using the logistic regression coefficients (Table 2) as weights,
we calculated a combined risk score to discriminate between
islet autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative chil-
dren based solely on these two peptides (Fig. 2). The AUC
of 0.83 for this combined model was significantly higher than
that for APOM alone (AUC 0.75) and for APOC4 alone
(AUC 0.74) at p=2.5×10−5.
Targeted proteomics to predict disease progression There
were no significant univariate associations of individual pep-
tides with progression time.
When we applied the survival dCV approach, we found
that three peptides (representing hepatocyte growth factor
activator [HGFAC], complement factor [CF]H and cerulo-
plasmin [CP]) and age at measurement were predictive
covariates for progression time (Fig. 3a–c, Table 2). The
median survival AUC was 0.72 (IQR 0.69–0.75). In order
to investigate the improvement in discrimination conferred
by the three peptides in addition to age, we compared the
AUC of the combined model with that of age alone (ESM
Fig. 4). The combined model displayed a significant im-
provement in discrimination (p = 0.001), mainly due to an
improvement after 4 years of follow-up. Importantly, the
abundance levels of most peptides, including the three pep-
tides predictive for progression time, were not correlated
with age (ESM Fig. 5). Only the levels of both peptides
representing carnosine dipeptidase 1 significantly in-
creased with age (ESM Fig. 5) but these peptides were
not, however, selected by the dCV for either progression
rates or autoimmunity status.
Using these peptides and age, we calculated risk
scores by including the weights from Table 2 in a multi-
variable Cox model, and separated the children into
tertiles of high, medium and low risk (Fig. 3d; ESM
Table 3). Children in the low-risk group progressed to
type 1 diabetes with a probability of <10% within 5 years
after seroconversion (95% CI 2.2%, 29%). The corre-
sponding rate in the high risk group was 78% (95% CI
60%, 92%) (Fig. 3d). As expected, children in the high-
risk group were younger; however, they did not differ
from the other risk groups in islet autoantibody status
or HLA genotype (ESM Table 3).

 Discussion
Using a proteomics strategy, we determined the protein
expression profiles of 185 children from the BABYDIAB/
BABYDIET birth cohorts with high genetic risk for type 1
diabetes. We found that 26 proteins, represented by 41 pep-
tides, could discriminate between islet autoantibody-
positive and autoantibody-negative children. The 26 pro-
teins were enriched for pathways involved in lipid-
associated metabolic processes and homeostasis, suggest-
ing that changes in lipid metabolism occur early in the
autoimmunity process. We also identified a proteomic sig-
nature that, together with age, was able to discriminate fast
and slow progression to clinical diabetes in islet autoantibody-
positive children.
Previous studies have used LC-MS/MS-based proteomics
approaches and applied extensive prefractionation techniques
on pooled samples [17, 18], followed by applying selected
candidate proteins using ELISA [18], LC-SRM-MS [18] or
other methods [19]. We designed our study in two phases,
capitalising on the high analytical depth of a shotgun
proteomics approach for selecting interesting peptides followed
by an application using sensitive targeted proteomics specifi-
cally developed for the subset of potentially relevant peptides.
The technical advantages of the targeted proteomics approach
include high accuracy and robustness of quantifications, and
that all peptides are consistently measured across all LC-MS
runs, thus avoiding the occurrence of missing values.
Consistent with previous studies in children with overt type
1 diabetes, we found lower levels of APOA4 [19], APOC4
[19], CF3 [17, 18], CF4 [17–19], clusterin [16, 17], kininogen
[17] and transthyretin [17] in children with islet autoanti-
bodies. We also found lower levels of CF9 in autoantibody-
positive children, while others [19] have reported slightly in-
creased levels. The peptide of APOM that was selected for
discrimination in the risk score has not been identified in previous
studies. In addition, we identified changes in the levels of 18
proteins (represented by 27 peptides) that have not been
previously described.
In order to prioritise the peptide signatures, we used the
dCV method for feature selection. This method aims to derive
a minimal, predictive combination of peptides, and to estimate

 the predictive power within a dataset in an unbiased fashion,
without substantial overfitting effects [32]. Two peptides, one
from APOM and one from APOC4, were deemed to be suffi-
cient for between-group discrimination with a median AUC of
0.83. Both peptides were also among the top hits for discrim-
ination in the univariate analysis. APOM levels were higher
and APOC4 levels lower in the children with islet autoanti-
bodies in our study. APOM is a member of the lipocalin
protein family involved in lipid transport [34]. Polymorphisms in
the promoter region of APOM that increase promoter activity
have also been reported to increase susceptibility to the develop-
ment of type 1 diabetes in two different cohorts [35]. Because the
APOM gene is regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α
(HNF1A), APOM is also considered to be a marker of
HNF1A-dependent MODY
. However, APOM levels have been
found to be significantly lower in individuals with MODY than
in those with type 1 diabetes [36].
APOC4, the other major marker for discriminating be-
tween islet autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative
children in this study, is also a member of the APO family. The
lower levels of APOC4 in autoantibody-positive children con-
firm previous findings reported in the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes
Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) study [19], in which
APOC4 levels were decreased even before seroconversion in
children who eventually progressed to type 1 diabetes. Lower
APOA1 levels have been reported to be associated with viral
infections [37], and Moulder et al have suggested an associa-
tion between viral infections and the development of type 1
diabetes [19]. So far, to the best of our knowledge, APOC4
has not been described to play a role in the immune response.
However, recent studies have discussed APOs such as APOM
[38] in the context of autoimmunity [38–40], and future stud-
ies might unravel as-yet unidentified roles for APOC4.
The combined discriminative power of the candidate pro-
teins APOM and APOC4 (median AUC 0.83) is comparable
with the results reported for APOC4 and afamin (AUC 0.85)
in the DIPP study [19].
Another aim was to explore whether proteomic signatures
could predict the progression time to type 1 diabetes in chil-
dren with islet autoantibodies. We identified a set of three

 peptides representing three proteins, CFH, HGFAC and CP, in
addition to age, as predictive covariates for progression time
with a median survival AUC of 0.72. Predictions including
these peptides were slightly but significantly superior to those
using age alone. Higher levels of CFH and HGFAC and lower
levels of CP in combination with young age were associated
with faster progression in later follow-up. CFH, HGFAC and
CP have previously been discussed in relation to insulin resis-
tance [41], type 1 diabetes [17] and type 2 diabetes [42, 43],
respectively.
The strengths and novelties of our study included the
multivariate statistical approach for extracting relevant peptide
signatures, minimising false-positive associations; the
exclusive investigation of samples from patients close
to seroconversion without overt diabetes, thus reducing
the confounding effect of hyperglycaemia on proteomic
signatures; and the large cohort of children with islet
autoimmunity. A limitation of our study is that we did not
validate our signature of progression rate in a separate cohort.
Other limitations include the lack of repeated longitudinal
measurements and the relatively small contribution of
the peptide signature to the progression risk score, as
compared with age alone.
In conclusion, we found that serum proteomics signatures
of islet autoantibody-positive children close to the date of
seroconversion were dominated by proteins involved in lipid
metabolism. Some of these protein markers have been
previously identified in studies of patients with overt diabetes,
and the changes in their levels close to the onset of autoimmunity
suggest they are early markers. In addition, the peptide signatures
significantly improved the categorisation of islet autoantibody-
positive children into high- or low-risk groups for rapid progres-
sion to type 1 diabetes over age alone.
