IMPORTANCE Growing consensus suggests that frailty-associated risks should inform shared
surgical decision making. However, it is not clear how best to screen for frailty in preoperative
surgical populations.
OBJECTIVE To develop and validate the Risk Analysis Index (RAI), a 14-item instrument used
to measure surgical frailty. It can be calculated prospectively (RAI-C), using a clinical
questionnaire, or retrospectively (RAI-A), using variables from the surgical quality
improvement databases (Veterans Affairs or American College of Surgeons National Surgical
Quality Improvement Projects).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-site, prospective cohort from July 2011 to
September 2015 at the Veterans Affairs Nebraska–Western Iowa Heath Care System, a Level
1b Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The study included all patients presenting to the medical
center for elective surgery.
EXPOSURES We assessed the RAI-C for all patients scheduled for surgery, linking these scores
to administrative and quality improvement data to calculate the RAI-A and the modified
Frailty Index.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Receiver operator characteristics and C statistics for each
measure predicting postoperative mortality and morbidity.
RESULTS Of the participants, the mean (SD) age was 60.7 (13.9) years and 249 participants
(3.6%) were women. We assessed the RAI-C 10 698 times, from which we linked 6856
unique patients to mortality data. The C statistic predicting 180-day mortality for the RAI-C
was 0.772. Of these 6856 unique patients, we linked 2785 to local Veterans Affairs Surgeons
National Surgical Quality Improvement Projects data and calculated the C statistic for both
the RAI-A (0.823) and RAI-C (0.824), along with the correlation between the 2 scores
(r = 0.478; P < .001). Of these 2785 patients, there were sufficient data to calculate the
modified Frailty Index for 1021, in which the C statistics were 0.865 (RAI-A), 0.797 (RAI-C),
and 0.811 (modified Frailty Index). The correlation between the RAI-A and RAI-C was 0.547,
and the correlations of the modified Frailty Index to the RAI-A and RAI-C were 0.301 and
0.269, respectively (all P < .001). A cutoff of RAI-C of at least 21 classified 18.3% patients as
“frail”with a sensitivity of 0.50 and specificity of 0.82, whereas the RAI-A was less sensitive
(0.25) and more specific (0.97), classifying only 3.7% as “frail.”
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The RAI-C and RAI-A represent effective tools for measuring
frailty in surgical populations with predictive ability on par with other frailty tools. Moderate
correlation between the measures suggests convergent validity. The RAI-C offers the
advantage of prospective, preoperative assessment that is proved feasible for large-scale
screening in clinical practice. However, further efforts should be directed at determining the
optimal components of preoperative frailty assessment.

F
railty is a geriatric concept identifying those patients (re-
gardless of age) at increased risk of dying in 6 months to
5 years owing to a decline in physiologic reserve.1-6 This
declineinphysiologicreservehasimportantimplicationsforthe
surgical patient because a diagnosis of frailty is associated with
markedly increased risks for postoperative mortality and mor-
bidity. For example, when compared with robust patients, frail
surgical patients are less likely to be discharged to home,7 more
likelytobereadmittedwithin30days,8,9andhavesubstantially
increasedratesofperioperativemortalityandcomplications.9-13
Given these data, growing consensus suggests that frailty-
associatedrisksshouldinformshareddecisionmakingandlead
to discussions clarifying realistic goals of care.
Despite the clear clinical significance of frailty in surgical
populations,thereisnoconsensusonhowbesttodefineormea-

Methods
Development of the Mortality Risk Index–Revised
TheRAI-CandRAI-AarebothadaptationsoftheMinimumData
Set (MDS) Mortality Risk Index–Revised (MMRI-R).16,17 From
a set of 50 frailty-related variables included in the MDS, the
developers of the MMRI-R used stepwise logistic regression to
selectthe12variablesthatmostconsistentlypredicted6-month
mortality. They then developed a 15-item survey to measure
these variables (4 items to assess activities of daily living and
1 item for each of the other 11 variables from the MDS). The sur-
vey relies exclusively on the report of the patient (or surro-
gate) and can be easily administered by nursing personnel. It
requires neither functional assessment of patient perfor-
mancenormedicalrecordreview,butwheneachitemisscored
with weights derived from the validated model, it reliably pre-
dicts 6-month mortality at the time of admission to a nursing
home (C statistic = 0.76).17
Development and Implementation of the RAI-C
As part of a quality improvement initiative at the Veterans Af-
fairs Nebraska–Western Iowa Heath Care System, we adapted
the MMRI-R for use in surgical populations. We eliminated the
single survey item assessing current or recent dehydration be-
cause we thought that this question would be difficult to as-
sess and interpret in the preoperative population. We also
modified the item probing admission to a nursing home in the
past 3 months to capture anyone living in a setting other than
independent living. We thought this would more expansively
capture the range of nonindependent living situations preva-
lent among surgical populations that might indicate frailty-
associated risk. The RAI-C questionnaire includes 14 ques-
tions assessing 11 variables and 2 statistical interactions with
scores ranging from 0 to 81 (eFigure in the Supplement). The
survey is administered by clinical staff based on patient his-
tory and report and scored using parameters developed for the
MMRI in an MDS sample of nursing home residents.
Pilot testing demonstrated the feasibility of this abbrevi-
ated survey. Because most of the questions were already
part of standard nursing interviews, it took clinical staff less
than 2 minutes to complete and was easily incorporated into
the standard intake procedures at surgical clinics. Based on
these findings, on July 1, 2011, we began measuring the
RAI-C for every patient presenting to outpatient surgery clin-
ics at the Veterans Affairs Nebraska–Western Iowa Health
Care System, requiring the score as a precondition for sched-
uling any elective surgery.
Key Points
Question Can frailty be measured rapidly, accurately, and reliably
enough to inform surgical decision making?
Findings In this cohort study, the novel Risk Analysis Index (RAI)
measures frailty prospectively (RAI-C) using a questionnaire or
retrospectively (RAI-A) using variables from Veterans Affairs or
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
Improvement Projects. The RAI-C proved feasible for systemwide
screening with good predictive power and subsample
demonstrated similar predictive power between the RAI-C, RAI-A,
and modified Frailty Index.
Meaning The RAI may measure frailty with predictive ability on
par with other frailty tools.

Responses to each item of the RAI-C were recorded
along with patient identifiers. As described elsewhere,
patients with an RAI-C score of at least 21 were subjected to
administrative review aimed at improving perioperative
decision making and outcomes.18 In some cases, this admin-
istrative review led to repeated calculation of the RAI-C,
often informed by more detailed medical histories. As such,
the database includes sequential measurements of the RAI-C
on some patients, but for the purposes of this analysis, we
used the single RAI-C measurement for each patient that
was closest to and antecedent from the date of surgery.
Development and Calculation of the RAI-A
In addition to measuring the RAI-C prospectively, we sought
to develop a version of the RAI that could be calculated from
variables captured by the VASQIP/ACS-NSQIP. We therefore
scrutinized the list of VASQIP variables to identify those that
best approximated the 11 variables assessed by the questions
in the RAI-C. When definitional clarity was required, we re-
ferred back to the definitions of the MDS variables from which
the RAI-C and MMRI-R were derived. See the eAppendix in the
Supplement for a complete rationale for variable selection. We
then developed a scoring convention to calculate the RAI-A
score from the identified VASQIP variables (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Data Linkage and Analysis
To construct our database for analysis, we began with the
database recording all responses to the RAI-C survey, check-
ing each item for out-of-range values and missing data, cor-
recting errors when possible by reference to the electronic
medical record. We then used each patient’
s last name and a
portion of his or her social security number to link the RAI-C
score to vital status and date of death from the vital statistics
file. We then used the patient identifiers and the date of the
proposed surgery (recorded on the RAI-C survey) to search
the electronic medical record and link records to a specific
surgery, recording the surgery’
s unique identifier to permit
later linkage to VASQIP data. If no surgery was identified for
the specific patient and date, we searched the patient’
s elec-
tronic medical record for any surgery performed within 90
days after the date of RAI-C evaluation, linking the patient’
s
record to the first surgery (if any) identified in this time
frame. The Nebraska–Western Iowa Veterans Affairs Medical
Center institutional review board determined these proce-
dures to be “operations activities not constituting research”
according to Veterans Affairs Handbook 1058.05, and thus,
per VHA Policy, the information presented in this article
does not require informed consent or institutional review
board approval.
The primary outcome was survival, calculated from the
date of surgery to the date of death for those who died and to
the last recorded death date (July 24, 2015) for those who sur-
vived, excluding all surgeries performed after this date. Di-
chotomous variables for 30-day, 180-day, and 365-day mor-
tality were calculated, excluding those whose follow-up from
date of surgery to July 24, 2015, was less than the specified 30
days, 180 days or 365 days.
We then used each surgery’
s unique identifier to link rec-
ords to local VASQIP data. Not all surgeries were included in
VASQIP, but for those that were, we calculated the RAI-A as de-
scribed in previous paragraphs and the modified Frailty In-
dex (mFI) as described by Adams et al,10 Karam et al,19 Tsiouris
et al,20 and Velanovich et al.21 We also calculated 2 dichoto-
mous composite variables for postoperative complications, in-
dicating the occurrence of (1) any VASQIP-measured compli-
cation except urinary tract and superficial wound infections
and (2) Clavien-Dindo level IV complications, defined as any
VASQIP variable for septic shock, postoperative dialysis, pul-
monary embolus, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pro-
longed ventilation, reintubation, coma, stroke, or return to the
operating room.
Statistical analyses began with summary descriptions of
the cohort, including rates of mortality and morbidity. We then
estimated receiver operating characteristics with nonpara-
metric 95% confidence intervals, C statistics, sensitivity, and
specificity. We also plotted Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by
frailty scores. Correlation between frailty measures was esti-
mated with nonparametric methods (Spearman ρ). All analy-
ses were made using SPSS, version 23 (IBM Corp).

Results
From July 2011 to September 2015, we assessed the RAI-C
10 698 times in 6856 unique patients with known length of
postoperative survival (Figure 1). Of these, 6803, 6419, and
5959 patients were followed up for 30 days, 180 days, and 365
days, respectively. A subsample of 2785 patients were further
linked to VASQIP data, from which we calculated the RAI-A.
Of these, only 1021 had VASQIP data sufficient to calculate mFI
because several mFI variables were phased into VASQIP dur-
ing our sampling frame.
Thedemographiccharacteristicsofeachsampleweresimi-
lar with regard to age, sex, race/ethnicity, American Society of
Anesthesiologists classification, and RAI-C score (eTable 2 in
the Supplement). Administrative RAI scores were somewhat
lower than RAI-C scores, and this likely reflects the stringent
rulesforabstractingtheVASQIPvariablesfromwhichtheRAI-A
is calculated. This sensitivity is apparent when comparing the
individualcomponentsoftheRAIscore.Forexample,theRAI-C
questionnaire elucidated a history of heart failure from 3%
(n = 90 of 2785) to 4% (n = 274 of 6856) of patients, but only
0.1% (n = 3 of 2785) to 0.2% (n = 2 of 1021) of patients had
VASQIP variables indicating a history of congestive heart fail-
ure. Similar discrepancies in sensitivity were evident for short-
ness of breath and cancer (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Ratesofmortalityandpostoperativecomplicationsincreased
with frailty (Table 1). For example, 180-day mortality rates for
RAI-CandRAI-Ascoresof15orlesswere0.9%and0.8%,respec-
tively,butincreasedto17.3%and10.0%,respectively,forscores
of at least 36. For each strata of frailty, mortality increased dra-
maticallywithlengtheningtimehorizons.Forexample,the4.9%
30-daymortalityassociatedwithRAI-Cscoresofatleast36grew
to a staggering 26.8% at 1 year. However, most of even the frail-
estpatients(60%-70%)experiencedlong-termsurvivalthatsta-
bilized 2 to 3 years after the operation (Figure 2).
Complication rates at 30 days were higher than the rates
of mortality, ranging from 4.6% to 25% for any complication
other than urinary tract or superficial wound infections and
2.5% to 15% for life-threatening Clavien-Dindo level IV com-
plications (Table 1). Similar patterns of outcomes were ob-
served for the mFI.
TheCstatisticsoftheRAI-C,RAI-A,andmFIwerefairlycon-
sistentacrossthe3cohortsforbothmortalityandcomplications
as presented in Table 2. Depending on the cohort or time hori-
zon, the RAI-C predicted mortality with C statistics between
0.704 and 0.824. The RAI-A and mFI were similar, with some-
whathigherCstatisticsrangingfrom0.739to0.979.Ingeneral,
sensitivity and specificity of predicting 180-day mortality were
maximized at the lower end of the range of frailty scores where

cific (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

Tables 1 and 2 report only those cases linked to a specific
date of surgery. To explore the possibility that the excluded
cases biased results, we analyzed data from all 9778 patients
with known vital status (Figure 1). For cases without a spe-
cific date of surgery, we calculated the length of survival from
the date of RAI-C assessment. Mortality rates and C statistics
for this larger sample (eTable 4 in the Supplement) were simi-
lar to those reported in Tables 1 and 2, suggesting that our in-
abilitytolinkpatientsdidnotbiasourfindingsamongthe6856

and the RAI-C (Spearman ρ = .269; P <.001) and RAI-A
(Spearman ρ = .269; P <.001) were weaker. The Venn diagram
in Figure 3 further illustrates these correlations demonstrating
the partial overlap between the different frailty measures.
Discussion
In this study, we developed and validated 2 new frailty indi-
ces for use in surgical populations, finding that the RAI-C and
RAI-A predict postoperative mortality and morbidity with as
good or better predictive ability than other existing measures
of frailty. For example, the C statistics for the RAI-C and RAI-A
predicting 180-day mortality were 0.797 and 0.865, respec-
tively,whichisamoderateimprovementovertheMMRI-Rfrom
which they are derived (C = 0.760) and similar to the mFI
(C = 0.811). Although our methods do not permit direct com-
parison, these data demonstrate similar predictive ability to
frailty measures based on physiological performance such as
the Hopkins Frail Scale11 and the Timed Up-and-Go.22

all performance of the 2 tools was similar, the RAI-A generates

tion of cut points for a variety of applications.
The RAI-A and mFI are somewhat more specific than the
RAI-C. This is likely owing to the different methods of assess-
ing frailty-associated risk. The RAI-C relies on the clinical judg-
mentofthepersonneladministeringthequestionnaire.Forthis
study, clinicians were instructed to use their best judgment in
scoring the RAI-C, and as such, it is likely that the presence of
specific risk factors was interpreted more liberally than the
stringent coding rules required by VASQIP for the variables on
which the RAI-A and mFI are based. However, these methods
are well-suited to the purposes of the 2 instruments. To the
extent that the RAI-C is intended for screening, its sensitivity
is an advantage, and to the extent that the RAI-A is used to test
associations between frailty and surgical outcomes, its speci-
ficity may provide benefit.

As with any imperfect test, the cut point to rule frailty in
or out involves a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.
The advantage of a granular scale, such as the RAI, is that cut-
offs could be chosen based on the health care setting, level of
precision required, and planned interventions for frail pa-
tients. For example, an RAI-C value of 11 is 72% sensitive and
73% specific (eTable 3 in the Supplement), but because 29%
of the population would rule in for frailty at this cut point, it
is insufficiently specific for use in busy surgical clinics. Cut
points between 16 and 21 may strike a more pragmatic bal-
ance,identifying18%to21%ofthepopulationasfrailwith52%
to 61% sensitivity and 80% to 83% specificity. Cutoffs such as
these could rapidly identify most potentially frail patients in
the first stage of a 2-stage screening paradigm. If greater speci-
ficity is required, the second stage could confirm suspected
frailty using 1 or more of the functional measures of frailty that
are too labor intensive for screening all patients in predomi-
nantly robust populations.
The correlation between RAI-A and RAI-C suggests mod-
erateconvergentvalidity.CorrelationswiththemFIareweaker
and may illustrate the enduring lack of consensus regarding
the definition of frailty.14 However, the weak correlation is in
line with other research that demonstrates only limited over-
lap between different frailty measures,24 suggesting that the
overarching syndrome of frailty is larger than any single
measurecaptures.25Assuch,wesuggestthatfrailtyisbestmea-
sured with multiple modalities. Screening can be accom-
plished efficiently with the RAI-C, selecting a cutoff with the
desired sensitivity and specificity; those identified as poten-
tially frail can then complete a battery of more time-
intensivetestssimilartotheworkbyRobinsonetal7,15thatcap-
ture multiple domains including functional performance and
serological biomarkers.
Although most frail patients live at least 2 to 3 years after
their surgery, the risk of mortality increases dramatically with
increasing frailty. Because the RAI-C can be calculated in ad-
vance of surgery, and because these data provide estimates of
the mortality risk, it is now possible to provide risk estimates
to patients based solely on their frailty. Whereas the ACS and
VA NSQIP risk calculators focus on the immediate periopera-
tive period of 30 days, the RAI-C extends risk estimates out to
6 months and 12 months. As such, the RAI-C may help place
traditional 30-day risk estimates into the context of the over-
arching trajectory of the patient’
s life, thus informing the de-
cision-making process shared by patients and surgeons.
Limitations
Our findings are limited in several ways. First, our data are lim-
ited to a single VA medical center and may not generalize to
the broader VA or US populations. Second, we were not able
to find mortality or surgical data on some of the patients as-
sessed with the RAI-C, and as such, these missing data may
represent a source of bias. Third, mortality and morbidity may
not be the outcomes of greatest importance for frail patients.
Future work should assess the association of frailty with pa-
tient-centered outcomes such as independent living, dis-
charge to home, or patient centeredness of care.
Conclusions
The RAI-C and RAI-A represent effective tools for measuring
frailty in surgical populations, with predictive abilities on
par with other published measures of frailty. The RAI-C
offers the additional advantage of assessing frailty-
associated risk preoperatively and prospectively, thus pre-
senting an opportunity for feasible, large-scale screening of
surgical populations in clinical practice. Its 6- to 12-month
time horizon may also help place traditional 30-day risk esti-
mates into the wider context of patients’lives. However, fur-
ther efforts are needed to determine the optimal compo-
nents of preoperative frailty assessment, and future work
could more definitively validate the RAI-C and RAI-A in non-
veteran, community populations and by comparing their
performance with some of the functional measures of frailty.
