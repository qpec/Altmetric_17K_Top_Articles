abstract
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between use of β-2-
adrenergic receptor (B2AR) agonist drugs during pregnancy and risk for autism spectrum 
disorders (ASD).
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted by using Denmark’s health and population 
registers. Among children born between 1997 and 2006, 5200 cases with ASD admission 
diagnoses and 52 000 controls without ASD were identified and individually matched on 
month and year of birth. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds 
ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) for any B2AR agonist exposure during pregnancy, 
preconception, and by trimester.
RESULTS: In total, 3.7% of cases and 2.9% of controls were exposed to B2ARs during 
pregnancy. Use of B2ARs during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of ASD, even 
after adjustment for maternal asthma and other covariates (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1–1.5). The 
elevated risk was observed with use of B2AR during preconception (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0–
1.6), first trimester (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1–1.5), second trimester (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1–1.7), 
and the third trimester (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1–1.7). There was some evidence that longer 
B2AR within-pregnancy use was associated with the increased risk.
CONCLUSIONS: B2AR agonist exposure during pregnancy may be associated with an increased 
risk for ASD. If the effect is real, any intervention must be balanced against benefits of 
indicated medication use by pregnant women.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Certain 
medications such as β-2 adrenergic receptor 
agonist drugs are known to cross the placenta and 
may affect developing neurons in the fetus. Only 1 
epidemiologic study thus far has investigated this 
association.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: β-2 adrenergic receptor 
agonist drug exposure during pregnancy may 
be associated with an increased risk for autism 
spectrum disorders. Results from this study add to 
the limited knowledge on prenatal pharmacological 
exposures as potential autism spectrum disorders 
risk factors.

Prenatal pharmacologic exposures 
have been implicated as potential risk 
factors for autism spectrum disorders 
(ASD).1–3 In particular, concerns 
have been expressed that exposure 
to terbutaline, a β-2 adrenergic 
receptor (B2AR) agonist drug, used 
as indicated as an antiasthmatic4 
and used off-label later in pregnancy 
as a tocolytic agent,5 may increase 
the risk for neurodevelopmental 
disorders in offspring.6–8 The 
prevalence of B2AR agonist drug 
exposure during pregnancy range 
from 1.0% to 7.5% in Denmark and 
throughout Europe.9–11 A study of in 
utero B2AR agonist drug exposure 
in a small series of dizygotic twin 
pairs suggested an increased risk 
associated with ASD.12 A case-control 
study of 291 cases and 284 controls 
found that exposure for more than 
2 days during the third trimester 
was associated with increased risk 
for ASD, although estimates were 
imprecise (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 
6.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.1–34.3).13
It is unclear if the apparent effects 
are due to confounding by indication: 
whether it is the pharmacologic 
exposure or the indicating condition 
that increases risk to ASD. Long-
acting B2AR agonist drugs such as 
salmeterol and formoterol are used 
to reduce asthma exacerbations 
and provide asthma control in 
adults.14 Croen et al observed that 
maternal diagnosis of asthma or 
allergies during the second trimester 
was associated with risk of ASD.15 
However, Lyall et al reported no 
association of maternal asthma with 
child ASD.16
There is some mechanistic evidence 
to support the role of B2AR in 
development of ASD. β-2 adrenergic 
receptors within the catecholamine 
system are involved in normal 
nervous system development 
and the function of both neural 
and nonneural tissues in adults.17 
The most common approach to 
treatment of asthma in Denmark is 
inhalation of B2AR agonist drugs18 
and placental transfer of B2AR 
agonists has been demonstrated 
in vitro19 and indicated in vivo 
even at inhaled concentrations.20 
B2AR agonist drugs used during 
pregnancy can affect the fetal brain 
by crossing the placenta, resulting in 
the disruption of either replication 
or differentiation of the developing 
neurons.21 The mechanisms within 
the mature β-2-adrenergic receptors 
protect against overstimulation; 
however, fetal receptors do not have 
the ability to regulate any imbalance 
and may in fact become sensitized.22 
Early research has shown that 
B2AR agonist drugs administered 
to pregnant rats during gestation 
alters neural cell replication and 
differentiation, synaptogenesis, 
and expression of synaptic proteins 
involved in neurotransmission.23–25 
Although animal studies support 
the biological plausibility of adverse 
effects associated with prenatal 
B2AR agonists drug exposure, the 
findings are not trimester specific 
and suggest that there may be 
multiple critical periods throughout 
early development.22,25,26 However, 
because uncontrolled asthma has 
been associated with poor birth 
outcomes, pregnant women are 
generally recommended to continue 
asthma medication.27,28 Given the 
biological plausibility and limited 
knowledge regarding risks of 
prenatal pharmacologic exposures, 
we conducted a population-based 
case-control study to estimate the 
associations of maternal exposure 
to B2AR agonist drugs used during 
preconception and pregnancy with 
the risk of delivering a child who goes 
on to develop ASD.
METHODS
The Institutional Review Board of 
Drexel University and the Danish 
Data Protection Agency (Record No. 
2010-41-4861) approved this study.
Participants
All children (n = 749 755) born 
in Denmark between January 1, 
1997, and December 31, 2006, 
were identified through the Civil 
Registration System.29 Children 
were excluded if they could not be 
linked to their biological mother 
(n = 1139), if the biological mother 
did not live in Denmark a year before 
delivery (n = 10 806), or if the child 
was of gestational age <23 weeks or 
>43 weeks (n = 1774). Therefore, 
the study population (n = 628 408) 
was then drawn from all biological 
singletons; for women with multiple 
births, 1 child was randomly selected 
for inclusion in the study.
Cases were identified from the 
National Hospital Register and 
the Danish Psychiatric Central 
Register that includes information 
on all inpatient and outpatient 
care from psychiatric hospitals 
and psychiatric wards in general 
hospitals in Denmark.30 The quality 
of the diagnosis of childhood autism 
in the Denmark registers was 
evaluated through medical records 
review: register-based diagnosis of 
childhood autism was confirmed 
94% of the time with an additional 
3% falling within ASD.31 However, 
there is also a possibility for 
unregistered cases of ASD. Subjects’ 
records from January 1, 1999, to 
March 31, 2011, were searched 
for International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision, codes 
(ICD-10) of F840, F841, F845, and 
F848/F849 (childhood autism, 
atypical autism, Asperger syndrome, 
and pervasive developmental 
disorder-unspecified, respectively). 
Subjects were considered a case if 
any of these codes were present.
Controls were defined as individuals 
without ASD admission diagnoses. 
Ten controls per case were 
individually matched on month 
and year of birth, assuring the 
same follow-up period for cases 
and controls, and thus the same 
opportunity to be diagnosed.

Exposure
Pharmacologic exposure 
information was drawn from the 
Drug Prescription Register, which 
records all dispensed prescribed 
medication from any pharmacy, 
except hospital dispensaries in 
Denmark. Therefore, we were unable 
to capture B2AR agonist use as a 
tocolytic in the third trimester. The 
drug codes included in the exposure 
definition are R03AC02, R03AC03, 
R03AC04, R03AC05, R03AC12, 
R03AC13, R03CC02, R03CC03, and 
R03CC12. We extracted information 
regarding personal identification 
number, dispense date, drug code 
(the World Health Organization 
Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical 
classification system), name of drug, 
number of packaged dispensed, and 
the number of defined daily dosage 
per package.32 The exposure windows 
were defined as preconception (90 
days before the estimated CD), first 
trimester (within 90 days after the 
estimated CD), second trimester 
(within 90–180 days after estimated 
CD), and third trimester (180 days 
after the estimated CD to delivery 
date). A child was considered exposed 
if the dispense date fell within the 
specified exposure period or the days 
supplied overlapped any portion 
of the exposure period or interest. 
Children born to women who did not 
fill a prescription for B2AR agonist 
drugs for the entire period from 90 
days before estimated CD through 
the date of delivery were considered 
unexposed. To calculate duration 
of use, the number of defined daily 
dosages in each dispensed package 
for the period falling within a given 
exposure window, based on dispensed 
date, were summed. Duration was 
dichotomized into 2 categories 
representing use for more or less than 
half a trimester (1–45 days and ≥45 
days) in each exposure window.
Covariates
Covariates were derived from 
available health registers and the 
social registers of Statistics Denmark. 
They included parental age, 
psychiatric history, mother’s number 
of live births, child’s gestational age, 
birth weight, obstetric complications, 
and family socioeconomic status 
(a combination of parental income 
and the highest level of education 
attained). Gestational age was given 
in days from self-reported last 
menstrual period and corrected using 
an ultrasound if the last menstrual 
period was uncertain. The variable 
for psychiatric history included 
schizophrenia-like psychosis (ICD, 
Eighth Revision [ICD-8]: 295, 297, 
298.39, 301.83; ICD-10: F20–F25, 
F28–F29), affective disorder (ICD-8: 
296, 298.09, 298.19, 300.4; ICD-
10: F30–F39), substance abuse 
(ICD-8: 303, 304; ICD-10: F10–
F19.9 excluding F1×0.0) and any 
other psychiatric disorders. These 
covariates were chosen a priori based 
on literature suggesting their role as 
risk factors for ASD.33–40 Inpatient 
and outpatient maternal asthma 
was identified using ICD-8 codes 
(493.00 [Asthma bronchiale], 493.01 
[Status asthmaticus], 493.02 [Asthma 
bronchila cum rhinitide allergica], 
493.08 [Asthma aliud definitum], 
and 493.09 [Asthma]) and ICD-10 
codes (J45 [Asthma], J45.0 [Asthma 
bronchilae allergicum], J45.1 [Asthma 
bronchiale non allergicum], J45.8 
[Mixed asthma], J45.9 [Asthma 
without specification], J46 [Status 
asthmaticus], and J46.9 [Status 
asthmaticus]) present in the register 
at any time before the delivery of the 
child.
Analytic Method
Conditional logistic regression 
analysis estimated associations 
of maternal B2AR agonist drug 
exposure variables with the 
children’s ASD diagnoses. Because 
none of the covariates resulted in 
a ≥10% change in unadjusted log 
ORs when added individually, both 
parental age and gender of the 
child were forced in all adjusted 
models as covariates. Parental age 
and gender have been associated 
with ASD in other studies and 
provided a reasonable alternative to 
the unadjusted model. To address 
confounding by indication, we 
included maternal asthma as a 
covariate and additionally restricted 
sample to mothers with a history of 
asthma.
We performed a sensitivity analysis 
to explore the potential impact of 
underreporting of B2AR use and 
maternal asthma in the register.41 
Following previous analyses,41,42 we 
reestimated effect estimates under 
plausible sensitivity and specificity 
for both B2AR use and maternal 
asthma diagnosis. Specifically, 
for B2AR use we simulated B2AR 
use at 4%, a rate observed in 
other Nordic countries.43 Because 
we hypothesized that possible 
misclassification was nondifferential 
by outcome, we assumed equal 
exposure measurement sensitivity 
and specificity among cases and 
controls at 0.73 and 1.0, respectively. 
We simulated an increase in asthma 
prevalence from the observed 
prevalence of 1.3% to a prevalence 
of 2%, the prevalence estimate 
suggested by a previous study9 
of hospital data from the County 
of North Jutland in Denmark, also 
assuming that misclassification 
was nondifferential with respect to 
outcome. Specificity was assumed to 
be 1.0, and sensitivity was set to 0.66 
to reflect the level of underreporting 
needed consistent with the assumed 
true asthma prevalence of 2%.
RESULTS
Children with ASD (n = 5200) were 
more likely than controls (n = 
52 000) to be male, have a higher 
parental age, and have a mother with 
an asthma diagnosis before the birth 
of the child (Table 1). The frequency 
of B2AR agonist drug exposure in 
the pregnancy period was 3.7% 
(190) for cases and 2.9% (1489) in 
3

GIDAYA et al 
controls. In addition, there were 83 
cases (1.6%) and 673 controls (1.3%) 
with mothers who had a diagnosis for 
asthma during the pregnancy period.
We found an increased risk with 
exposure to B2AR agonist drugs 
during pregnancy (OR 1.3; 95% 
CI: 1.1–1.5), after controlling for 
child birth year and month, gender 
of the child, and parental age 
(Table 2). Trimester-specific effect 
estimates were similar to each 
other. While attempting to account 
for confounding by indication, 
adjustment for maternal asthma 
did not substantively change effect 
estimates, as seen by comparing 
models 1 and 2 in Tables 2, 3, and 
4. Analyses restricting to only 863 
mothers who had a diagnosis of 
asthma (Table 4) suggested an 
increased risk on average, although 
the 95% CI around the odds ratio 
included the null (1.3; 95% CI: 
0.8–2.1). Sensitivity analyses 
suggested that misclassification of 
B2AR exposure and asthma diagnosis 
did not greatly influence B2AR 
effect estimates, for example, upon 
simulating an increase in maternal 
asthma prevalence from the observed 
1.3% to the posited 2%, the B2AR 
effect estimate became 1.2 (95% CI: 
1.1–1.5; see Supplemental Appendix).
The duration of use was similar 
between cases and controls within 
each period (Table 1). In conditional 
logistic regression results (Table 3), 
the point estimates for the longer 
duration exposure category (>45 
days) tended to be larger than that 
for the shorter duration exposure 
category (1–45 days) during the 
preconception and first and second 
trimesters periods. However, the 
confidence limits for longer duration 
exposure effects overlapped 
substantively with those for shorter 
duration exposure.
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that exposure 
to B2AR agonist during the prenatal 
period was associated with increase 
in risk for ASD compared with 
those who were unexposed. These 
findings are consistent with other 
epidemiologic evidence regarding 
in utero exposure to B2AR agonist 
drugs and risk for ASD.12,13 Our 
analyses using sample restriction 
and adjustment for maternal asthma 
suggest that maternal B2AR agonist 
drug use, independent of indication, 
was associated with increased risk 
of ASD. Findings here also did not 
offer strong evidence for a particular 
exposure vulnerability window. 
Similar elevated risk was observed 
across the first, second, and third

trimester, and all effect estimates had 
overlapping confidence intervals.
As with a previous study,13 we 
observed elevated risk associated 
with the preconception as well 
as with prenatal exposure. The 
reasons, outside of chance, for a 
preconception association could 
include the following: misattribution 
of early prenatal exposure to the 
preconception window, existence 
of some mechanism such as cellular 
reprogramming6 for persistence 
of effect into the prenatal period 
(outside of bioaccumulation because 
B2AR agonist drugs have half-life of 
<7 hours44), or imperfect confounder 
control. In addition, epidemiologic 
studies thus far that have looked 
at duration of B2AR use report the 
highest risk with prolonged use (>2 
days),13 which is also consistent with 
our findings, although our definition 
of duration differed from that used 
previously.
There was a possibility for exposure 
and indication misclassification, 
although our sensitivity analysis 
did not suggest this substantively 
influenced in the B2AR effect 
estimates. Analyses also assumed 
that the mothers used all prescribed 
medication, but we have no 
information of when the prescribed 
medication was taken. Therefore, 
it is possible that portions of 
prescriptions during the study 
period were unused (leading to us 
overestimate of exposure) or that 
mothers used B2AR agonist drugs 
5
prescribed before the preconception 
period or during a previous 
trimester (leading to underestimate 
of exposure). Overestimation of 
the exposure could lead to an 
underestimate of effect estimate; 
however, we would expect this to be 
consistent throughout each exposure 
window. The impact of exposure 
misclassification is not possible to 
predict a priori in this setting.
Our exposure data were restricted 
to only outpatient prescriptions. 
Therefore, we did not have 
information on in-hospital use of 
B2AR agonist drugs, which limits 
our ability to study maternal B2AR 
agonist drugs used as a tocolytic 
because inpatient prescription 
is most common. Although most 
prescriptions for B2AR agonist 
drugs including those used for 
asthma indications are obtained in 
an outpatient setting, these drugs 
are also prescribed as a tocolytic 
for in-hospital use. B2AR agonist 
drug exposure due to tocolytic 
use would most likely occur in 
the third trimester. Therefore, if 
a B2AR agonist like terbutaline is 
administered as a tocolytic and 
this does, as previously reported,13 
increase ASD risk, our estimates 
of third trimester associations 
may in fact underestimate the 
true association. Our findings on 
outpatient exposure in the third 
trimester were consistent with those

inpatient and outpatient exposure 
and also observed a third trimester 
association.13
As with most observational 
epidemiology, unmeasured 
confounding is a potential limitation. 
We were able to adjust for numerous 
covariates that were available in 
the Danish register. However, 
potential confounders not 
represented in the register include 
in-home environmental exposures 
and pollutants, which may be 
associated with ASD45 but are 
unlikely to be strongly associated 
with medication use.
Although our results add to the 
limited knowledge on prenatal 
pharmacological exposures as potential 
ASD risk factors and suggest further 
consideration of other exposures and 
vulnerabilities that share mechanistic 
similarities with B2AR agonists, one 
must be cautious when considering 
the public health implications of our 
current work. Under the assumptions 
that the association we observed is 
causal and precisely calculated, we 
estimate that <1% of ASD cases in 
the population can be attributed to 
prenatal B2AR agonists drug exposure 
(the population attributable fraction46 
for any B2AR agonists exposure 
estimated based on an OR of 1.3 
and the 2.9% observed exposure 
prevalence). Given this, with respect to 
individual decisions regarding B2AR 
agonist drug use during pregnancy, 
because uncontrolled asthma in 
pregnancy has been associated with 
poor birth outcomes,28,47 any potential 
modestly increased ASD risk needs 
to be carefully balanced against the 
established benefits of indicated 
medication use.
