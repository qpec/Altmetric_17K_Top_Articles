Abstract
Purpose of the Study: Until recently, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adults were excluded from full partici-
pation in civil marriage. The purpose of this study is to examine how legal marriage and relationship status are associated 
with health-promoting and at-risk factors, health, and quality of life of LGBT adults aged 50 and older.
Design and Methods: We utilized weighted survey data from Aging with Pride: National Health, Aging, and Sexuality/
Gender Study (NHAS) participants who resided in states with legalized same-sex marriage in 2014 (N = 1,821). Multinomial 
logistic regression was conducted to examine differences by relationship status (legally married, unmarried partnered, sin-
gle) in economic and social resources; LGBT contextual and identity factors; health; and quality of life.
Results: We found 24% were legally married, and 26% unmarried partnered; one-half were single. Those legally married 
reported better quality of life and more economic and social resources than unmarried partnered; physical health indicators 
were similar between legally married and unmarried partnered. Those single reported poorer health and fewer resources 
than legally married and unmarried partnered. Among women, being legally married was associated with more LGBT 
microaggressions.
Implications: LGBT older adults, and practitioners serving them, should become educated about how legal same-sex mar-
riage interfaces with the context of LGBT older adults’ lives, and policies and protections related to age and sexual and 
gender identity. Longitudinal research is needed to understand factors contributing to decisions to marry, including short- 
and long-term economic, social, and health outcomes associated with legal marriage among LGBT older adults.

The U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges, June 
2015, ruled same-sex couples have the constitutional right 
to marry, marking one of the most profound changes to 
social policy in recent history. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgender (LGBT) older adults have experienced a long 
history of struggle for civil rights, including legal mar-
riage, sparked by the Stonewall riots in 1969. Ensuing 
decades were marked by contentious state-level rulings 
both for and against the right to same-sex marriage 
(Freedom to Marry, 2016) including, in 1996, the passage 
of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined 
marriage in federal law as the union between one man 
and one woman, allowing states to not recognize same-
sex marriages performed in other states and excluding 
same-sex couples from receiving federal marriage benefits 
(Congress.gov, 1996).

 In the court of public opinion, however, acceptance of 
LGBT people and same-sex marriage increased more rap-
idly (McCarthy, 2015). More than 30 years after the first 
same-sex couples set legal proceedings for marriage in 
motion, in 2004 Goodridge v. Department of Public Health 
in Massachusetts led to the first legal state-sanctioned 
same-sex marriage in the United States; by this time nearly 
three quarters of states had enacted bans on same-sex mar-
riage. However, in 2013, the Supreme Court reversed por-
tions of DOMA, extending federal recognition to those in 
legal state-sanctioned same-sex marriages. By the time the 
Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that states could no longer 
ban same-sex marriage, 75% of the states (36) sanctioned 
same-sex marriage. Many have characterized this rapid 
shift in attitudes and support of same-sex marriage as one 
of the most dramatic in history.
The benefits associated with marriage are reflected in 
decades of research documenting that married individuals 
in the general population report more economic resources 
(Brown, Bulanda, & Lee, 2012; Lin & Brown, 2012), better 
overall health (Fuller, 2010; Lee & Payne, 2010; Manzoli, 
Villari, Pirone, & Boccia, 2007; Pienta, Hayward, & 
 
Jenkins, 2000), higher quality of life (QOL), including 
happiness (Lee & Bulanda, 2005; Wienke & Hill, 2008) 
and longer life (Lee & Payne, 2010) as well as more social 
and community resources (Brown et al., 2012) compared 
to those who are cohabiting, dating, or single. Although 
marriage is associated with better security of resources and 
health among older adults in general, there is a dearth of 
knowledge about how marriage may influence the lives, 
health, and well-being of LGBT older adults. Relationship 
status and related factors are likely influenced by legal, cul-
tural, and political contexts, especially historical marginali-
zation, previous social exclusion from civil marriage, and 
recent changes in social policies.
Because most same-sex couples have not had the option 
of civil marriage until recently, their reasons for becoming 
married or remaining unmarried may vary greatly and dif-
fer from heterosexual couples in the general population. 
Like the general population, LGBT adults benefit from 
being partnered. Among sexual minority older adults, being 
partnered or married was found to be protective for physi-
cal and mental health (Williams & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 
2014) and associated with lower levels of stigma and lone-
liness (Kim & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2016). Also, as in the 
general population, limited evidence suggests that being 
married is associated with benefits beyond merely being 
partnered. Among lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults, for 
example, same-sex marriages have been associated with 
benefits, including higher levels of happiness and lower lev-
els of psychological distress, compared to those who are 
dating or single, even prior to the federal legalization of 
civil marriage (Riggle, Rostosky, & Horne, 2010; Wienke & 
Hill, 2008). Partnered gay adult men have reported fewer 
depressive symptoms than those not partnered, and hav-
ing a same-sex legal spouse was more protective than being 
domestic partners (Wight, LeBlanc, de Vries, & Detels, 
2012).
The goals of this study are to understand who, among 
older same-sex couples, opts to legally marry and who does 
not; what is the association of relationship status (legally 
married, unmarried partnered, single) with socioeconomic 
and social resources, LGBT contextual and identity factors, 
health, and QOL among LGBT older adults; and whether 
there are similarities and differences between women and 
men in factors associated with relationship status. This 
research has important implications for practitioners, poli-
cymakers, and communities to better understand the rela-
tive benefits and constraints associated with legal marriage 
in later life in this population.
Conceptual Framework
Both health-promoting and at-risk factors explored 
along with relationship status in this study are derived 
from the Health Equity Promotion Model (HEPM; 
Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2014), which highlights poten-
tial mechanisms associated with health and QOL of LGBT 
populations. The HEPM posits that intersections between 
social positions (e.g., sexual identity, sex, and race/ethnic-
ity), and individual- and structural-level contexts shape 
access to health-promoting and at-risk factors (e.g., socio-
economic, LGBT contextual and identity factors, and social 
resources and risks), which in turn contribute to overall 
physical and mental health across the lifespan. The HEPM 
also incorporates the life course and considers the timing 
of individuals’ lives: Today’s LGBT older adults have faced 
enormous stigma and did not have access to civil mar-
riage earlier in life, experiences that are bound to inform 
their perceptions and decisions later in life, including those 
related to marriage.
The study employs gendered and life-course lenses in 
order to explore the differences that exist within groups 
of LGBT older adults according to diversity in experiences 
and social contexts (Calasanti & Slevin, 2001; Dannefer & 
Settersten, 2010). A gendered lens of aging examines power 
relations and inequalities shaped and reinforced by social 
processes and structures that influence how people act 
and perceive themselves as men and women (Calasanti & 
 
Slevin, 2001). A life-course lens posits that the dynamic 
process of aging is influenced by cumulative life experi-
ences within structural and cultural contexts (Dannefer & 
Settersten, 2010). Life-course analyses, embedded within 
an equity perspective, consider the consequences of earlier 
life transitions, such as the timing of marriage, on later-life 
trajectories of adult development (Elder, 1994; Fredriksen-
Goldsen & Muraco, 2010). Although marriage rates in the 
United States are decreasing (Schoen, 2016) and the average 
age at marriage for heterosexuals is increasing (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2013), current cohorts of LGBT older adults were 
unable to civilly marry a same-sex partner until just over 
a decade ago and not until 2013 and 2014 in most states,

 even if they have been in a long-term relationship. Thus, 
in some respects, LGBT older adults are “off time” in that 
they may not experience the transition to marriage until 
mid or late life (Elder, 1994), which may have subsequent 
effects on the aging process.
Social Positions
Relationship status and its correlates may be influenced 
by an individual’s other social positions, such as gender, 
sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. From studies 
of the general population, we know the health benefits of 
marriage are larger for African Americans and Latinos than 
for Whites (Pienta et al., 2000). Also, single older women 
outnumber single men and experience the poorest overall 
health (Liu & Umberson, 2008) and highest rates of dis-
ability (Lin & Brown, 2012) and depression (McDonough, 
Walters, & Strohschein, 2003). A community-based study 
found that LGBT older adults living with a partner or 
spouse were more likely to be younger, female, and of 
higher socioeconomic status (Williams & Fredriksen-
Goldsen, 2014).
Socioeconomic Resources
Economic resources shape health-promoting and at-risk 
factors and may influence and be influenced by relationship 
status. Compared to those who are married, unmarried 
Baby Boomers in the general population have lower edu-
cational attainment and household income (Lin & Brown, 
2012). Additionally, single older adults with limited eco-
nomic resources are less likely to become partnered in later 
life (Brown et al., 2012). Moreover, there are gender dif-
ferences in economic resources by relationship status. In 
the general population, single older women are more likely 
to experience lower socioeconomic resources than married 
women and married or single men (Lin & Brown, 2012). 
Female same-sex couples are more likely to live in poverty 
than heterosexual couples and male same-sex couples (U.S. 
Census Bureau, 2014).
LGBT Contextual and Identity Factors
The HEPM takes into account life events related to sexual 
or gender identity. For example, a common life event of 
LGBT individuals is identity disclosure (or coming out), 
which is not a single event, but rather a continuous pro-
cess of identity management. Furthermore, experiences of 
LGBT microaggressions are also common, that is, biases 
encountered in everyday life. Being married may voluntar-
ily and involuntarily indicate one’s sexual or gender identity 
to others, likely resulting in less control over one’s degree 
of outness and visibility as a LGBT person. Marriage may 
thus lead to greater risk of being a target of LGBT bias.
Social Resources and Risks
Relationship status may interact with social network struc-
ture and support because having a partner can bolster 
social and family network size, and create opportunities 
for contact, socialization, and assistance. Married adults in 
the general population have larger social networks com-
pared to single and cohabitating individuals (Brown et al., 
2012). Social resources may also be gendered, such that les-
bians’ close networks of support include partners, children, 
friends, and ex-partners as a buffer from both sexism and 
heterosexism, and as a result of women’s socialization “to 
be better at and care more about relationships” (Weinstock, 
2004); gay men may also maintain close relationships with 
ex-partners, though to a lesser extent than lesbians (Nardi, 
1999). In gay and lesbian couples, those with longer rela-
tionships have larger social networks, including more 
same-sex couples (Fokkema & Kuyper, 2009). LGBT older 
adults living alone, on the other hand, report lower levels of 
social support and greater loneliness compared to those liv-
ing with a spouse or partner (Kim & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 
2016).
It is important to recognize that the progression in mar-
riage policy needs to be considered in research of same-sex 
couples; the legalization of civil marriage among same-sex 
couples was not a single event, but rather an incremental 
process that needs to be studied as such. Many states legal-
ized same-sex marriage prior to the Supreme Court’s ruling 
in 2015, and in fact, federal-level policy change occurred 
only after the majority of states had changed state-level 
policies, which has been defined as the critical moment in 
which the U.S. Supreme Court was willing to recognize fed-
eral marriage for same-sex couples. Thus, in this article, we 
assess LGBT older adults’ relationship status in 32 states 
(plus the District of Columbia) that allowed same-sex civil 
marriage with access to federal benefits as of November 1, 
2014, to analyze outcomes that may be related to the incre-
mental nature of change in same-sex marriage policies as 
well as to assess the eventual impact of national same-sex 
marriage recognition at differing time points. We examine 
the demographic characteristics of LGBT adults aged 50 
and older who are married, unmarried partnered, and sin-
gle, and analyze how health-promoting and at-risk factors 
and outcomes are associated with relationship status by 
gender. We hypothesize that married participants will have 
greater socioeconomic and social resources, fewer LGBT 
contextual and identity risks, and better health and QOL 
compared to those unmarried partnered, and that those 
single will have the fewest resources and face the greatest 
risks. Furthermore, we expect women and men, as they dif-
fer in their social positions, to show different patterns in 
relationship status, resources, and risks, and the correlates 
independently contributing to relationship status.
Design and Methods
We conducted cross-sectional analysis using 2014 data from 
Aging with Pride: National Health, Aging, and Sexuality/
Gender Study (NHAS), a national longitudinal study regard-
ing health and well-being among adults aged 50 and older 
who self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender,

 or engaged in a sexual or romantic relationship with some-
one of the same sex or gender. Participants completed a 
paper or online survey and were compensated $20 for their 
time. For this analysis, we used a subsample of partici-
pants (N = 1,821) living in the 32 states, plus the District of 
Columbia, with legal same-sex marriage and access to fed-
eral benefits by November 1, 2014 (the date of survey dis-
tribution) and who met the following criteria: (a) identified 
as gay, lesbian, or bisexual; (b) identified their sex as male or 
female; and (c) if partnered, were in a same-sex couple.
Measures
Relationship status: “What is your current relationship 
status?”, with responses: partnered, married, or single. If 
partnered or married, they were asked, “What is the cur-
rent legal status of your relationship?” with answer options 
married, legally recognized; married, not legally recognized; 
partnered, legally recognized (such as domestic partnership 
or civil union); and partnered, not legally recognized. Based 
on this information, relationship status was categorized 
as single, legally married, or partnered unmarried (includ-
ing those in marriages not legally recognized and those in 
legally recognized non-marriage partnerships).
Demographic characteristics included age in years, gen-
der (women or men), sexual identity (gay/lesbian or bisex-
ual), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White or other race/
ethnicity), and length of relationship in years for those who 
were in a same-sex couple.
Socioeconomic resources included level of educa-
tion (high school graduate or less = 0; more than high 
school = 1); household income (less than 200% of fed-
eral poverty level [FPL] = 0; at or greater than 200% 
of FPL = 1); total value of household assets (less than 
$10,000 = 0; $10,000 or greater = 1); home ownership 
(not a homeowner = 0; homeowner = 1); possession of 
private health insurance (no insurance or public insur-
ance only = 0; private insurance = 1); employment status 
(unemployed = 0; employed = 1); and retirement status (not 
retired = 0; retired = 1).
LGBT contextual and identity factors were assessed with 
two indicators. Outness (one’s level of visibility as an LGBT 
person) was assessed with a single item “Please indicate 
your level of visibility with respect to being LGBT,” which 
was rated on a scale of 1 (never told anyone about your 
sexual orientation or gender identity) to 10 (told everyone 
you know about your sexual orientation or gender identity). 
Guided by previous literature (Sue et al., 2007; Woodford, 
Chonody, Kulick, Brennan, & Renn, 2015), LGBT micro-
aggressions (subtle comments or actions directed toward 
LGBT individuals which are intentionally or unintentionally 
offensive) was assessed with eight items (α = .85), for exam-
ple, “People use derogatory terms to refer to LGBT indi-
viduals in your presence” (never = 0, almost every day = 5).
Social resources and risks included having children (no 
living children = 0, at least one living child = 1); living 
arrangement (live alone = 0, live with at least one other = 1); 
availability of social support assessed by the abbreviated 
four-item scale (Gjesfjeld, Greeno, & Kim, 2008) of MOS-
Social Support Scale (Sherbourne & Stewart, 1991; e.g., 
“Someone to help with daily chores if you were sick”; 
never = 0, very often = 4; α = .88).
Physical health included self-rated general health 
(poor = 1, excellent = 5) and the presence or absence of dis-
ability (e.g., limited activities or need for special equipment 
due to health problems; absent = 0, present = 1).
QOL was assessed using the World Health Organization 
Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), a 26-item ques-
tionnaire that provides four subscales: physical QOL (e.g., 
“Do you have enough energy for everyday life?”; α = .87); 
psychological QOL (e.g., “How much do you enjoy life?”; 
α = .85); social QOL (e.g., “How satisfied are you with 
your personal relationships?”; α = .78); and environmen-
tal QOL (e.g., “How satisfied are you with the conditions 
of the place where you live?”; α = .84; Bonomi, Patrick, 
Bushnell, & Martin, 2000). Each item was rated on a 
5-point Likert scale with a summary score ranging from 0 
to 100 computed for each subscale using the recommended 
formula (World Health Organization, 2004).
Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (Version 
14.1). In order to reduce sampling bias and increase the 
generalizability of the findings, we applied survey weights 
to statistical analyses. Survey weights were computed utiliz-
ing three external probability samples’ data as benchmarks 
following two-step postsurvey adjustment, as has been 
applied to other types of non-probability samples (Lee, 
2006; Lee & Valliant, 2009). In the first step, the Aging 
with Pride: NHAS sample was combined with the National 
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) sample ascertaining sexual 
orientation by sexual identity, and we computed the prob-
ability of being selected from the NHIS versus the Aging 
with Pride: NHAS sample by using a logistic regression 
model with age, sex, sexual orientation, Hispanic ethnicity, 
race, education, region, and home ownership as covariates. 
In the second step, we further calibrated the weights for 
those in same-sex partnerships, another indicator of sexual 
orientation. The population totals by age, race/ethnicity, 
gender, education, marital status, and region were esti-
mated from the NHIS, the American Community Survey 
(ACS), and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). See 
Fredriksen-Goldsen and Kim (2017) for detailed informa-
tion regarding the postsurvey adjustment procedures.
To examine the demographic profiles of each relation-
ship status, estimated means and proportions for variables 
of interest were computed and compared. Next, to exam-
ine whether the associations between relationship status 
and individual and structural factors remained consistent 
after controlling for demographic characteristics, we con-
ducted a series of multinomial logistic regression analyses

 predicting relationship status (reference category = sin-
gle), controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and sexual identity. 
These analyses were separated by gender to examine pat-
terns between women and men.
Results
Demographic characteristics by relationship status are 
displayed in Table 1. Weighted proportions indicate that 
23.91% of the sample was legally married, 26.29% unmar-
ried partnered, and 49.80% single. A significantly higher 
proportion of men than women were single. Married and 
unmarried partnered participants were, on average, sig-
nificantly younger than those who were single, and more 
likely to identify as gay or lesbian rather than bisexual. 
 
Those married were more likely to identify their race/eth-
nicity as non-Hispanic White than unmarried partnered 
or single. The average duration of married participants’ 
relationships was significantly longer (on average, about 
23 years) than those unmarried (about 16 years).
As shown in Table 2, weighted proportions by relation-
ship status and gender reveal that among women, 30% 
were legally married, 29% unmarried partnered, and 
41% single. Among men, 19% were legally married, 25% 
unmarried partnered, and 56% single. Legally married and 
unmarried partnered women were, on average, younger 
than single women; there were no significant age differ-
ences by relationship status for men. Legally married men 
and women were more likely to identify their race/ethnic-
ity as non-Hispanic White and to have longer partnership

 durations than unmarried partnered. They also evidenced 
the most socioeconomic resources across a variety of indi-
cators, especially among legally married men, with advan-
tages compared with both unmarried partnered and single 
men in education, income, assets, home ownership, health 
insurance, and employment status. Legally married women 
had those same advantages compared with single women 
and showed greater economic resources compared to 
unmarried partnered women in income, home ownership, 
and health insurance.
Legally married women and men were more out com-
pared with unmarried partnered and single men and women. 
However, legally married women experienced more LGBT 
microaggressions compared with single women; among 
men, there were no differences in microaggressions. Legally 
married men and women generally showed the high-
est levels of social resources. Among women, those who 
were legally married were more likely to have children and 
higher levels of social support compared with both unmar-
ried partnered and single women; legally married women 
compared to single women were more likely to live with 
others and less likely to have ever experienced the death 
of a partner. Among men, the likelihood of having children 
did not differ by relationship status; men who were legally 
married were more likely to live with others and less likely 
to have ever experienced the death of a partner or spouse 
compared with both unmarried partnered and single men. 
Both legally married and unmarried partnered men had 
higher levels of social support compared with single men, 
but they did not differ from each other in social support. 
Unmarried partnered men were the most likely to be receiv-
ing informal care.
Health and QOL did not differ greatly between those 
legally married and unmarried partnered, but was lowest 
for those single. Among women, those who were legally 
married and unmarried partnered had better general 
health, lower rates of disability, and better QOL across all 
domains compared with those who were single; married 
women only had greater social QOL than those unmar-
ried partnered. Legally married men also fared better than 
single men on all indicators of health and QOL; married 
men showed advantages over unmarried partnered men 
in general health and physical and environmental QOL. 
Unmarried partnered men showed similar health but bet-
ter psychological, social, and environmental QOL than 
single men.
Results of the multinomial logistic regressions predict-
ing participants’ relative risk of being married or unmarried 
partnered, controlling for demographic characteristics (age, 
sexual identity, and race/ethnicity), are shown in Table 3. 
The reference category for these models is single; thus, 
estimates indicate the likelihood of being legally married 
or unmarried partnered relative to being single. Relative 
risk ratios smaller than one indicate greater likelihood of 
being single and ratios larger than one indicate greater like-
lihood of being married or unmarried partnered. In order 
to examine differences between legally married and unmar-
ried partnered, we also assessed differences with legally 
married as reference category. Differences by relationship 
status remained similar after adjusting for demographic 
characteristics, with a few notable exceptions:
After adjusting for demographic characteristics, legally 
married men and women showed advantages over single 
men and women across nearly all indicators of economic, 
health, and social resources, with the exception that legally 
married women report more LGBT microaggressions. 
Legally married women, compared with unmarried part-
nered women, showed greater household income, home 
ownership, and private health insurance, showed greater 
outness, were more likely to have children, had more social 
support, and had higher social and environmental QOL. 
Legally married men, compared with unmarried partnered 
men, showed greater household assets and home owner-
ship, greater outness, were more likely to live with others, 
and had higher physical and environmental QOL.
Gender Differences Within Relationship Status 
(Adjusted for Demographic Characteristics)
After adjusting for demographic characteristics, we com-
pared women to men of the same relationship status. 
Among legally married LGBT older adults, women were 
significantly more likely than men to be homeowners 
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.16, p = .03), to have pri-
vate health insurance (AOR = 2.91, p = .03), and to have 
children (AOR = 3.32, p = .001). Married women also had 
significantly higher levels of social support than married 
men (B = 0.30, p = .007). Among unmarried partnered 
LGBT older adults, the only significant gender difference 
was in education; unmarried partnered women were more 
likely than unmarried partnered men to have more than a 
high school education (AOR = 2.92, p = .04). Among single 
LGBT older adults, women were more likely than men to 
have household assets of $10,000 or more (AOR = 1.89, 
p = .02). Single women fared worse than single men on 
indicators of physical health including general health 
(B = −0.29, p = .02), disability (AOR = 1.96, p = .003), and 
lower physical QOL (B = −4.78, p = .04). Single women 
were more out than single men (B = 0.71, p = .01), but 
experienced fewer LGBT microaggressions (B = −0.21, 
p = .03). Finally, single women were more likely than single 
men to have children (AOR = 2.46, p < .001), and less likely 
to have ever experienced the death of a partner or spouse 
(AOR = 0.33, p < .001).
Discussion
LGBT people have maintained committed relationships 
throughout history, yet civil marriage for same-sex couples 
has only recently (2015) been legalized in the United States. 
The present study provides the broadest view to date of 
how the availability of legal marriage in the United States

 is associated with health and well-being among LGBT 
older adults, with important implications for the poten-
tial effects of national same-sex marriage legalization. This 
study reveals substantial differences in LGBT older adults’ 
resources and risks by relationship status. Across a wide 
range of socioeconomic, social, and health resources, those 
who were legally married were consistently advantaged 
relative to those who were unmarried partnered—suggest-
ing that legal marriage is likely beneficial and also that legal 
marriage is being accessed more heavily by advantaged 
individuals. In the process of identifying the positive aspects 
of legal same-sex marriage, from an equity perspective, it 
is also critical to recognize that single LGBT older adults 
are the most disadvantaged group, with perhaps fewer 
resources available to reach their full health potential.
Although same-sex marriage has been hailed as one of 
the most significant changes in recent social policy, only 
about half of LGBT older adults in same-sex relationships 
opted to legally marry, accounting for only one quarter of 
the LGBT older adults in this study. The reasons for mar-
rying, or not marrying, are complex and may reflect many 
different considerations and circumstances of individual 
couples. Many of these LGBT adults came of age when 
same-sex behavior was criminalized and pathologized, and 
some may be fearful to legally marry as it requires creat-
ing a public record of a same-sex relationship. Others may 
feel ambivalent about marriage because it has been defined 
by some as a heteronormative institution (Egan & Sherrill, 
2005) from which LGBT people were historically excluded. 
Prior to federal recognition of marriage, some same-sex 
couples created, by legal necessity, documents to ensure 
health-related decision making, estate planning, and finan-
cial asset management, so some may feel that further legal 
protections bestowed by marriage are not essential (Porche 
& Purvin, 2008). However, federal protections such as 
Social Security spousal and bereavement benefits, spousal 
impoverishment protections, and spousal veterans’ benefits 
can only be attained through civil marriage. Furthermore, 
federal protections that may be of even more immediate 
benefit to single and less advantaged LGBT adults, such 
as antidiscrimination laws in employment, housing, and 
public accommodations, are still lacking. Policymakers and 
practitioners cannot assume that same-sex marriage will 
appeal to all LGBT older adults or that they will benefit 
from the legal provisions tied to marriage. It is also impor-
tant that policymakers and practitioners understand the 
economic value and consequences of marriage and how it 
may affect financial security before and after retirement.
Across multiple domains, we observed substantial 
advantages among LGBT older adults who were legally 
married. Compared with those who were partnered but 
remained unmarried, legally married LGBT older adults 
showed greater socioeconomic resources, were more out 
about their sexual and gender identities, had greater social 
resources, and enjoyed greater social and environmental 
QOL. Those who chose to marry were most likely well 
resourced before marriage since the average length of rela-
tionship was 23 years.
Although LGBT older adults who opted to legally 
marry were consistently advantaged in socioeconomic and 
social resources, it was notable that they did not show bet-
ter health or physical and psychological QOL compared 
to those unmarried partnered. Prior studies in the general 
population of heterosexual couples show married couples 
fare better in health than those living together but unmar-
ried (Fuller, 2010); however, given the historical context 
of marriage for same-sex couples, the association between 
legal marriage and health may not be as strong. Instead, 
unmarried LGBT couples may draw some of the benefits of 
married couples, because being unmarried has historically 
been a result of exclusion from civil marriage rather than 
lack of commitment, stability, or support in their relation-
ships. This may explain some of the similarities between 
married and partnered unmarried individuals on several 
health and QOL indicators.
Single LGBT older adults were disadvantaged, com-
pared to those who were legally married and unmarried 
partnered, across socioeconomic, social resources, as well 
as all health indicators and QOL, which is consistent with 
previous findings (Wight, Leblanc, & Lee Badgett, 2013; 
Williams & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2014). Single adults are 
at greater risk of social isolation as they age, given their 
enhanced vulnerability with fewer economic resources and 
social connections and less access to support, as observed 
in the general population (Coyle & Dugan, 2012). Health 
care and social service practitioners may benefit from train-
ings that incorporate the historical context of LGBT older 
adults’ lives, illustrating possible sources of, and solutions 
to, social isolation such as creating opportunities for social 
engagement and relationship building that are welcoming 
to individuals of any relationship status.
In our study, single people were also more likely to 
be racial and ethnic minorities, echoing previous studies 
of LGBT older adults (Williams & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 
2014). Racial/ethnic minority men in particular were less 
likely to be married, suggesting that they may lack family 
and community support for formalizing their relationships. 
Living in an environment where immediate support is avail-
able is protective for health of older adults in the general 
population (Ha, Kahng, & Choi, 2015) and among LGBT 
older adults (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, Shiu, Goldsen, & 
Emlet, 2015). Furthermore, evidence of mutual causality 
has emerged in longitudinal studies of the general older 
adult population, suggesting that social resources positively 
influence health and, reciprocally, individuals with better 
health have more opportunities to form social connections 
(Garbarski, 2010). Single older adults may not have access 
to either of these beneficial pathways to health. This gap 
and inequities by relationship status may become even 
greater in LGBT communities now that marriage for same-
sex couples can provide access to more benefits. It is critical 
that we undertake efforts to identify at-risk single LGBT

 older adults in order to provide assistance and resources for 
health and well-being.
Our study found several notable gender-specific pat-
terns of characteristics associated with relationship status. 
Consistent with previous findings of sexual and gender 
minority older adults (Fredriksen-Goldsen, Kim, Barkan, 
Muraco, & Hoy-Ellis, 2013; Wallace, Cochran, Durazo, & 
 
Ford, 2011; Williams & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2014), 
although inconsistent with the experience of heterosexual 
older adults, sexual minority older women are more likely 
to be married or partnered than men. In addition, these 
married women are particularly robust when considering 
socioeconomic resources. This may, in part, be because they 
realized early in life that they needed to provide their own 
financial support without reliance on others (Fredriksen-
Goldsen, 2016). Another possibility is that, consistent 
with prior findings, women in our study have larger, more 
diverse, and closer relationship ties (Antonucci, Akiyama, & 
 
Lansford, 1998), a finding that is consistent with sociali-
zation patterns of women to be relationship oriented 
(Weinstock, 2004). Interestingly, however, we found that 
although married women have many advantages, they 
experienced more microaggressions compared to those sin-
gle, yet this was not the case among men. The level of social 
resources is particularly high among married women, who 
may be more likely to be exposed to diverse people with 
differing views on same-sex relationships (Erosheva, Kim, 
Emlet, & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2016). Such visibility as 
a socially connected individual in a married couple may 
put women at risk of encountering bias. However, despite 
higher levels of social resources, single women, in particu-
lar, were at greater risk, compared to single men, across 
multiple indicators of health, including poor general health, 
disability, and physical QOL. Some degree of single wom-
en’s health differences in this sample may be understood 
through a gendered life-course lens: In later life, single 
women may feel that they lack a clear social role at a point 
in their adult trajectories when they expected to be cou-
pled, especially given women’s gender socialization toward 
being relationship oriented (Weinstock, 2004). Thus, single 
women may have lower social status vis-à-vis those who 
are married or coupled (Ron, 2009), which may affect their 
health outcomes.
Sexual minority older men, on the other hand, showed 
substantial limits in some types of social resources. The 
social vulnerability of sexual minority older men is a criti-
cal concern; in California, for example, among adults aged 
50–70, half of gay and bisexual men live alone compared 
to only 13% of heterosexual men, 20% of heterosexual 
women, and 28% of lesbians and bisexual women (Wallace 
et al., 2011). The single men in our study were significantly 
more likely to have experienced the death of a partner than 
married and unmarried partnered men and single women, 
perhaps due to the profound impact of the HIV/AIDS pan-
demic in the 1980s and 1990s. Interestingly, there were no 
observed differences between unmarried partnered men 
and single men in regards to general health, disability, or 
physical QOL, which may indicate that only the healthiest 
men are marrying or that unmarried male partnerships do 
not afford the same health benefits as female partnerships 
and marital relationships, perhaps complicated due to HIV.
Interestingly, gender-related same-sex marriage trends 
are also occurring on an international level. Before the 21st 
century, no countries permitted same-sex marriage; in 2000, 
the Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-
sex marriage and at least 22 other countries have followed 
suit including the most recent addition of Colombia in 
2016 (Pew Research Center, 2015). Some researchers have 
also observed international trends in the gender of same-
sex couples choosing to marry, depending on the social 
policies by country. In countries where marriage has a low 
value and is less tied to other social rights (e.g., legal deci-
sion making, adoption, parenting, etc.), same-sex marriage 
initially tends to be male dominated. However, in many 
European countries, for example, as policies have over 
time incentivized same-sex marriage (e.g., provided access 
to benefits), it has become increasingly female-dominated 
or gender equal. These findings suggest that as countries’ 
policies and incentives around same-sex marriage change, 
the trends in marriage will likely change as well (Bernstein, 
Naples, & Harvey, 2015).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical 
study to explore the characteristics of LGBT older adults 
who are becoming legally married in later life. This study 
takes an important step toward a better understanding of 
how relationship status relates to the health and QOL of 
LGBT older adults. However, there are several limitations 
to consider. First, we used cross-sectional data, which limits 
our ability to draw conclusions about causal associations. 
Additionally, although we used survey weights to reduce 
the influence of sampling bias, findings cannot be inter-
preted as estimates of population prevalence. Relatedly, 
because this study was conducted prior to national legal-
ization of same-sex marriage, our findings may be influ-
enced by some of the demographic and political differences 
between states that did and did not independently legalize 
same-sex marriage. Future research will likely benefit from 
examining time point, as well as geographic, differences in 
factors associated with relationship status and legal mar-
riage. Future research is also needed regarding the intersec-
tion of same-sex marriage and gender identity; transgender 
individuals in same-sex relationships and those who are 
single may have different associations between relationship 
status and economic and social resources, health, and QOL 
compared to lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals who are 
not transgender.
An equity perspective incorporating a life-course lens 
raises important new questions about the associations 
between relationship status; legal marriage; and aging, 
health, and well-being in these communities. Of particular 
relevance for LGBT older adults is the fact that they can 
now legally marry, but much later in the life course than

 most couples. Marriage, although it provides some ben-
efits, can also result in the loss of some monetary benefits 
especially for older adults; for example, those receiving 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, and hous-
ing and other subsidies may lose benefits through marriage 
if it results in an increase in joint household income. In the 
general population, perhaps as a result, there has been a 
dramatic increase in the number of older adults who choose 
to cohabit rather than remarry (Brown et al., 2012), while 
cohabitation versus legal marriage is a relatively new choice 
for LGBT individuals. Education is needed in these com-
munities, and for practitioners who serve them, in order to 
weigh costs and benefits of marriage as they apply to the cir-
cumstances of each individual couple. It will also be impor-
tant to examine how relationship status, and who chooses 
to marry, change over time in order to understand the long-
term implications of the policy change. Currently same-sex 
marriage is being accessed by economically resourced LGBT 
older adults; practitioners should be aware of this inequity 
and policymakers should address this through future policy 
development and political advocacy. This study was con-
ducted at a time when the majority of states allowed mar-
riage of same-sex couples and federal benefits were available 
in those states, however, it was not yet federally recognized. 
Thus, in future research, it will be informative to examine 
how rates and correlates of legal marriage have changed fol-
lowing the federal right to same-sex marriage.
Legal marriage also has important ramifications on the 
dissolution of these relationships. Ending a legal marriage 
requires a legal dissolution, which may have a significant 
impact on social relationships and the structure of social 
networks in these communities. Ex-partners have played a 
central role in the lives of LGBT older adults, often occu-
pying caregiving roles when needed. Because legal dissolu-
tion of marriage can be adversarial in nature, there is a risk 
that this will disrupt the continuity of relationships over 
time for LGBT older adults, and the roles that ex-partners 
occupy in later life. This will be a critical topic for future 
research.
Longitudinal data are needed to examine how the rela-
tionship statuses of LGBT older adults change across the 
life span, and how they are influenced by other interper-
sonal relationships as well as the broader sociocultural 
context of social policy regarding marriage. This will also 
allow for investigation of how socioeconomic and social 
resources and risks interact with relationship status and 
aging, health, and well-being over time. Specifically, due to 
the age of the older adults in this study, longitudinal data 
are needed to assess how relationship status and health 
interact over time as some health issues may predate the 
most recent relationship status; the influence of relation-
ship duration must also be considered.
As rates of marriage continue to decline in the general 
population (Schoen, 2016), yet increase among LGBT older 
adults, future research is needed to provide a more nuanced 
understanding of the short- and long-term implications of 
those in committed relationships, both married or unmar-
ried, and those who are single. Only through careful 
attention to the range of relationship statuses and their 
implications will we be prepared to address the aging needs 
of our increasingly diverse older adult population.
