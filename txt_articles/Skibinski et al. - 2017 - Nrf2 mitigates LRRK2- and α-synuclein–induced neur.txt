Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and α-synuclein
lead to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Disruption of protein homeostasis
is an emerging theme in PD pathogenesis, making mechanisms to
reduce the accumulation of misfolded proteins an attractive thera-
peutic strategy. We determined if activating nuclear factor erythroid
2-related factor (Nrf2), a potential therapeutic target for neurode-
generation, could reduce PD-associated neuron toxicity by modulat-
ing the protein homeostasis network. Using a longitudinal imaging
platform, we visualized the metabolism and location of mutant
LRRK2 and α-synuclein in living neurons at the single-cell level.
Nrf2 reduced PD-associated protein toxicity by a cell-autonomous
mechanism that was time-dependent. Furthermore, Nrf2 activated
distinct mechanisms to handle different misfolded proteins. Nrf2
decreased steady-state levels of α-synuclein in part by increasing
α-synuclein degradation. In contrast, Nrf2 sequestered misfolded
diffuse LRRK2 into more insoluble and homogeneous inclusion bod-
ies. By identifying the stress response strategies activated by Nrf2,
we also highlight endogenous coping responses that might be ther-
apeutically bolstered to treat PD.
Nrf2 | Parkinson’s disease | LRRK2 | α-synuclein | proteostasis
P
arkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressively debilitating neurode-
generative condition that leads to motor and cognitive dysfunc-
tion. There are no disease-modifying therapies for this disease.
Mutations in the genes encoding α-synuclein (1) and leucine-rich
repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause PD (2). Mutations in LRRK2 are the
most common genetic cause of PD (3), and although mutations in
α-synuclein are rare, abnormal α-synuclein accumulation and pa-
thology characterize most PD cases (4). Furthermore, there is evi-
dence of an epistatic relationship between LRRK2 and α-synuclein
(5–7), suggesting that understanding how to block their ability to
cause neurodegeneration might be beneficial across a wide swath of
PD patients.
Mutations in both proteins have been implicated in protein
misfolding and protein dyshomeostasis within the cell (8).
Mechanisms to handle misfolded proteins more effectively
within the cell include modulating endogenous cellular stress
response pathways that up-regulate the protein degradation
machinery or sequester the misfolded proteins into inclusion
bodies (IBs) (9, 10). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
(Nrf2) coordinates a whole program of gene expression that
counters stress at multiple levels (11). Nrf2 was initially shown
to bind to the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) and reg-
ulate the expression of detoxification genes (e.g., GST) (12) and
oxidative stress-inducible enzymes (e.g., heme oxygenase-1)
(13), in response to electrophilic and reactive oxygen species-
producing agents. However, growing evidence indicates that
Nrf2 regulates a much broader gene expression response, in-
cluding genes involved in protein homeostasis, such as chaper-
ones and proteasome subunits (14–16), and thus, it is a potential
target to deal with damaged proteins. It remains unknown if
Nrf2 mediates a protective effect on different misfolded pro-
teins by activating similar or divergent pathways.
Nrf2 mitigates neurodegeneration in genetic and toxin mo-
dels of PD (17), and loss of Nrf2 exacerbates degeneration
(12), implicating it as a potential therapeutic target of PD (18).
Interestingly, the protective effect of Nrf2 is often mediated by
expression of Nrf2 in astrocytes (19, 20), which supports a
predominantly non–cell-autonomous mechanism of neuronal
protection. Whether this protective effect by Nrf2 can be me-
diated directly in neurons has yet to be determined. Using a
single-cell longitudinal imaging platform, we demonstrate that
Nrf2 expression in neurons directly mitigates toxicity induced
by α-synuclein and mutations in LRRK2 and that this effect is
time-dependent. We visualized the metabolism and localiza-
tion of α-synuclein and mutant LRRK2 at the level of a single
cell. Nrf2 expression reduced α-synuclein levels by increasing
the degradation of α-synuclein. In contrast, the reduction of
mutant LRRK2 toxicity by Nrf2 was associated with an in-
creased risk of IB formation and more insoluble and homo-
geneous IBs. The sequestering of LRRK2 into more compact
IBs led to a drop in diffuse LRRK2 levels elsewhere in the cell.
By shedding light on how Nrf2 mediates its protective effect
on PD-associated protein toxicity, we also shed light on en-
dogenous coping responses that might be bolstered to handle
misfolded proteins.
Significance
The prevailing view of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
(Nrf2) function in the central nervous system is that it acts by a cell-
nonautonomous mechanism to activate a program of gene ex-
pression that mitigates reactive oxygen species and the damage
that ensues. Our work significantly expands the biological un-
derstanding of Nrf2 by showing that Nrf2 mitigates toxicity induced
by α-synuclein and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), by potently
promoting neuronal protein homeostasis in a cell-autonomous and
time-dependent fashion. Nrf2 accelerates the clearance of α-synu-
clein, shortening its half-life and leading to lower overall levels of
α-synuclein. By contrast, Nrf2 promotes the aggregation of
LRRK2 into inclusion bodies, leading to a significant reduction
in diffuse mutant LRRK2 levels elsewhere in the neuron.

Results
Nrf2 Overexpression Reduces LRRK2- and α-Synuclein–Induced Toxicity
in Primary Rat Neurons. To elucidate a role for Nrf2 in cellular
coping mechanisms for misfolded proteins, we developed a method
to assay Nrf2 activation in live cells, including neurons. A common
method to identify Nrf2 activation is through a reporter construct
that contains the ARE (25) located in target genes of Nrf2. We
adapted this approach by visualizing Nrf2 activation in real time in
single cells by placing the expression of the fluorescent protein
mApple under the control of the ARE sequence. To validate the
ARE_mApple reporter gene, HEK293 cells were cotransfected
with Venus, as a morphology marker, and ARE_mApple and
treated with tertiary butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an activator of
endogenous Nrf2 (26). At 24 h posttransfection, cells were imaged,
and ARE_mApple fluorescence was measured. Treatment with
increasing doses of tBHQ caused a dose-dependent increase in
ARE_mApple expression, indicative of ARE activation (Fig. S1A).
Next we cotransfected HEK293 cells with Venus as a morphology
marker, ARE_mApple, and either Nrf2 or empty vector and con-
firmed that overexpression of Nrf2 led to a robust activation of the
ARE reporter in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 A and B).
We then validated the ARE reporter in primary rat neurons, by
first testing if we could activate endogenous Nrf2. Primary rat
neurons were cotransfected with Venus and ARE_mApple and
treated with tBHQ. At 24 h posttransfection, neurons showed a
robust increase in ARE_mApple fluorescence (Fig. S1B). Next, we
tested if Nrf2 overexpression could lead to ARE activation in
neurons. As primary rat cultures contain some glia, Nrf2 activation
in neurons might be caused by glia through a non–cell-autonomous
mechanism. To determine the contribution of this mechanism, we
labeled two cohorts of neurons in the same cultures with distinct
fluorescent labels, pTag-BFP and GFP, via sequential transfections
(Fig. 1C). The BFP-labeled cohort was also cotransfected with
Nrf2, whereas GFP-labeled neurons were not. Both cohorts of
neurons were also transfected with ARE_mApple to report Nrf2-
dependent ARE activation. Similar to HEK293 cells, we found that
neurons cotransfected with ARE_mApple, Nrf2, and pTag-BFP
showed an up-regulation of ARE_mApple fluorescence (Fig. 1D).
If glia were driving Nrf2-dependent ARE transcription in neurons,
neurons ectopically expressing GFP but not Nrf2 should show an
increase in ARE_mApple expression. However, we found that this
cohort of neurons had a similar level of ARE activation as a
population of neurons with no ectopic Nrf2 expressed in any of the
cells. Interestingly, Nrf2 induced a 12.1-fold induction of ARE
transcription in neurons, compared with only a 3.3-fold induction
in HEK293 cells, suggesting potential differences in basal levels of
Nrf2 in neurons and other cells types.
To test Nrf2’s cell-autonomous role in neurons, we measured
the expression of known Nrf2 targets, including those involved in
stress response and protein homeostasis in neurons transfected
with Nrf2. Primary rat cortical neurons were cotransfected with
mApple and Nrf2 or control plasmid and fixed 24 h later. Nrf2
overexpression caused a significant increase in expression of pro-
teasome 20s alpha and GST (Fig. S2 A–D), known Nrf2 tran-
scriptional targets (27). After validating Nrf2-dependent activation
in neurons, we tested if overexpression of Nrf2 reduced toxicity
induced by the PD-associated proteins LRRK2 and α-synuclein in

 neurons. We examined Nrf2’s effect on toxicity caused by two
LRRK2 mutations: the most common PD-associated mutation,
G2019S (28), and Y1699C. We showed that both mutations cause
dose-dependent toxicity, neurite degeneration, and IB formation (5).
To test Nrf2’s effect on α-synuclein–induced toxicity, the wild-type
α-synuclein protein was overexpressed. We found that overexpression
of α-synuclein in neurons leads to dose-dependent toxicity (29), which
models the duplication and triplication mutations of the α-synuclein
gene that cause a severe, highly penetrant form of PD (30, 31).
α-Synuclein was cotransfected into primary rat neurons, along
with Nrf2 and the morphology marker monomeric red fluorescent
protein (mRFP). To ensure that the total DNA transfected into the
neurons was the same across conditions, additional control plasmid
was transfected into the cohort of neurons without exogenous Nrf2.
Approximately 24 h after transfection, a robotic microscope (21)
was used to collect consecutive images of the same fluorescent
neurons. This approach enabled hundreds of neurons expressing
mRFP, Nrf2, and α-synuclein to be longitudinally followed in-
dividually, which we did every day for 1 wk. The reproducible
temporal expression profile of mRFP (Fig. S3) made it suitable to
track neuron morphology (Fig. 1E). As shown in previous studies
(21, 22), the loss of the mRFP signal coincided with the loss of
membrane integrity (Fig. S4), indicating the time of death for each
neuron. Similarly, we cotransfected primary rat neurons with Nrf2-,
mRFP-, and either Venus-tagged mutant Y1669C, G2019S, or
wild-type LRRK2 (Venus-LRRK2) and longitudinally imaged the
cells once a day for 7 d and used the mRFP signal to determine the
time of death of each neuron. Additional control plasmid was
transfected into the cohort of neurons without exogenous Nrf2 to
balance the DNA transfected into the neurons.
Using statistical survival tools that are commonly used in clinical
studies (24), the time of death of each neuron within the different
cohorts being followed was used to generate cumulative survival and
risk-of-death curves. These plots revealed that neurons expressing
α-synuclein had a greater cumulative risk-of-death and, thus, higher
toxicity than control neurons (Fig. 1F and Fig. S5A) and that neu-
rons overexpressing mutant LRRK2 had a greater risk of death than
either control neurons or neurons expressing wild-type LRRK2
(Fig. 1 G and H and Fig. S5 B and C). Exogenous overexpression of
Nrf2 caused a highly significant reduction in toxicity in neurons
expressing either α-synuclein or mutant LRRK2 (Fig. 1 F–H and
Fig. S5 A–C). Nrf2 also caused a small but statistically significant
increase in survival of neurons overexpressing wild-type LRRK2
(Fig. 1 G and H and Fig. S5 B and C). However, Nrf2 does not seem
to cause any dramatic improvement in baseline neuron viability, as
Nrf2 did not improve the survival of control neurons (Fig. 1F). For
Nrf2 to be considered as a potential therapeutic target, evidence
that Nrf2 mitigates neurodegeneration in human neuron models is
critical. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from
a healthy control individual were differentiated into human neurons
(Fig. S5D). iPSC-derived human neurons were cotransfected with a
panneuronal GFP_synapsin survival marker, α-synuclein, and either
Nrf2 or control plasmid and longitudinally imaged for 7–9 d (Fig.
S5E). Neurons expressing exogenous α-synuclein had a greater risk
of death than control neurons. Nrf2 reduced the risk of death of
neurons exogenously expressing α-synuclein without affecting the
survival of control neurons (Fig. S5F). Our results highlight the
specificity of Nrf2’s protective effect on neurons undergoing neu-
rodegeneration induced by PD-associated proteins. Furthermore,
we show that Nrf2 can act directly in neurons and does not require a
non–cell-autonomous mechanism of action.
The Protective Effect of Nrf2 Is Time-Dependent. Although we saw a
strong protective effect of Nrf2 on PD-associated protein toxicity,
we did observe that the cumulative risk-of-death curves of cells
with or without Nrf2 expression diverged to a greater extent at the
beginning of the experiment than at later times, hinting that Nrf2’s
effects might vary with time. We used Cox proportional hazard
(CPH) analysis, a popular survival analysis method (32), to
quantify both the magnitude of Nrf2’s effect on toxicity and any
adaptive changes in Nrf2’s efficacy over time. The magnitude of
Nrf2’s effect on α-synuclein and mutant LRRK2-induced toxicity
was surprisingly large (Table S1). Exogenous Nrf2 expression
reduced the risk of death by 92% [hazard ratio (HR) of 0.082,
P = 5.6e−14] and 86% (HR of 0.142, P = 1.2e−7) in neurons
expressing G2019S and Y1699C LRRK2, respectively. Although,
in neurons expressing α-synuclein, Nrf2 reduced the risk of death
by 67% (HR = 0.33, P < 2e−16). Furthermore, Nrf2’s impact on
PD-associated toxicity was most significant early on in the ex-
periment and attenuated significantly with time (Table S1).
To determine if the time-dependent effect of Nrf2 was due to a
decline in Nrf2 levels, we fixed cohorts of Nrf2 transfected neurons
at 24 and 168 h posttransfection and measured levels of Nrf2 by
immunocytochemistry. Nrf2 levels were comparable across both
cohorts of neurons (Fig. S6A). Next, we investigated if the drop in
efficacy could be due to a decrease in Nrf2-dependent ARE tran-
scription. Neurons transfected with ARE_mApple were imaged and
analyzed for ARE_mApple fluorescence at 24 and 168 h post-
transfection. Interestingly, we found that levels of ARE_mApple
were significantly lower at 168 h (Fig. S6B). To control for the
confound that a decline in Nrf2-dependent ARE transcription
could be due to the early death of neurons expressing high levels of
ARE_mApple, neurons were cotransfected with ARE_mApple and
GFP and longitudinally imaged for a week. The cotransfected GFP
was used as a morphology marker to select only neurons that lived
up to 172 h posttransfection (Fig. S6C). Neurons showed a signifi-
cant decrease in ARE_mApple signal with time (Fig. S6 C and D),
confirming a decrease in Nrf2-dependent ARE activation in neu-
rons over time, despite a high level of Nrf2 expression. This suggests
that neurons are undergoing an adaptive response to Nrf2 that
eventually limits its signaling.
Nrf2 Increases α-Synuclein Turnover. As Nrf2 has been implicated
in the up-regulation of targets involved in proteostasis, including
molecular chaperones and protein degradation machinery (14,
15, 33–35), we next determined if Nrf2 mediated its strong pro-
tective effect on PD-associated protein toxicity in neurons by
modulating α-synuclein and LRRK2 dynamics. With α-synuclein’s
propensity to misfold and induce a dose-dependent toxicity (29),
Nrf2 may reduce α-synuclein toxicity by up-regulating protein
degradation machinery to decrease α-synuclein levels (16). To
measure the levels of diffuse α-synuclein in single cells, we tagged
Dendra2 to α-synuclein and first confirmed that this fusion protein
retained the dose-dependent toxicity (Fig. 2 A–C) that we pre-
viously showed for untagged α-synuclein (29). Although Dendra2–
α-synuclein expression varied significantly from cell to cell,
α-synuclein levels in single neurons measured by Dendra2_GFP
fluorescence and by immunocytochemistry were highly correlated
(Fig. S7 A and B), indicating that Dendra2 fluorescence provided
a faithful estimate of the amount of protein in each cell. We also
confirmed that Dendra2–α-synuclein was distributed throughout
the cytosol, including expression in dendrites and spines of mature
neurons (Fig. S7 C and D). We then transfected neurons with
Dendra2–α-synuclein and Nrf2 or equal amounts of vector con-
trol. We found that cells expressing Nrf2 had lower steady-state
levels of Dendra2–α-synuclein (Fig. 2D). We also measured Nrf2’s
effect on steady-state levels of untagged α-synuclein. Neurons
cotransfected with untagged α-synuclein, mApple, and either Nrf2
or control were fixed at 24 h posttransfection and stained for
α-synuclein. Similar to Dendra2–α-synuclein-transfected neurons,
α-synuclein levels were lower in neurons transfected with Nrf2. In
contrast, levels of cotransfected mApple fluorescence were similar
(Fig. S7 E–G), indicating that Nrf2’s effect was specific to α-syn-
uclein and potentially indicating a role for Nrf2 in modulating
α-synuclein turnover.

 Steady-state levels of α-synuclein result from a balance of pro-
duction and degradation. As our synuclein expression constructs
are not expected to be activated by Nrf2 because they evidently
lack AREs, we hypothesized that Nrf2 lowers steady-state synu-
clein levels by accelerating its degradation. We measured α-syn-
uclein degradation rates in individual neurons by optical pulse
labeling (16, 36). This approach takes advantage of the photo-
switchable properties of Dendra2 in which an irreversible change
of its spectral properties occurs after illumination with short-
wavelength light. In our model, cells expressing Dendra2–α-syn-
uclein initially fluoresce green. Upon photoswitching, a population
of the green fluorescent protein is irreversibly switched to red,
creating a distinct intracellular population of photoconverted
α-synuclein that can be followed by the automated longitudinal
analysis (Fig. 2E and Fig. S8A). Red fluorescence of Dendra2–
α-synuclein was measured longitudinally within individual cells.
Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, measurements from hun-
dreds of cells were used to model the underlying degradation of
α-synuclein in the population, enabling us to determine if the
presence of Nrf2 modulated α-synuclein degradation in single
cells. In cells overexpressing Nrf2, the degradation of α-synuclein
was 10% faster (posterior probability, 0.92) (Fig. 2F and Fig. S8B).
As a comparison, we exposed primary rat neurons expressing
α-synuclein to a novel family of small-molecule autophagy in-
ducers, namely FPZ and MTM, which we previously showed to
up-regulate autophagy in primary rat cortical neurons (36). FPZ
and MTM led to a 24% (posterior probability, 0.92) and 23%
(posterior probability, 0.93) faster degradation of α-synuclein, re-
spectively (Fig. 2 G and H and Fig. S8 C and D). We next asked if
the benefits of Nrf2 might be explained through its effects on
α-synuclein levels. Using CPH analysis, we compared the benefi-
cial effect of Nrf2 on α-synuclein toxicity before and after ad-
justment for α-synuclein levels. Before incorporating α-synuclein
levels into the model, Nrf2 significantly reduces α-synuclein–
induced toxicity; however, once α-synuclein levels are incorporated
into the model, this significance drops away (Table S2), indicating
the Nrf2’s beneficial effect on α-synuclein toxicity can be explained
by its effects on α-synuclein levels.
Nrf2 Increases LRRK2 IB Formation and Insolubility. Next, we de-
termined if Nrf2-mediated protection leads to a similar effect
on LRRK2 dynamics. We began by looking at steady-state levels
of LRRK2, by measuring Venus-LRRK2 levels in neurons co-
transfected with mutant Venus-LRRK2 and either Nrf2 or
control. In contrast to α-synuclein, Nrf2 did not lead to a detect-
able decrease in steady-state levels of diffuse mutant LRRK2 at
24 h posttransfection (Fig. 3A). In addition to targeting mis-
folded proteins for degradation, toxic protein conformers may be
sequestered into IBs enabling nonnative toxic epitopes to be
buried or refolded (21, 37). Similar to other disease-causing
misfolded proteins, LRRK2 has a propensity to aggregate and
form IBs (38, 39). Thus, we wanted to determine if the protective
effect of Nrf2 is mediated through the shunting of diffuse mutant
LRRK2 into IBs, thereby increasing LRRK2 IB formation. To
test this, we used our longitudinal imaging platform to track
Venus-LRRK2 IB formation in real time. For each neuron
expressing mutant Venus-LRRK2, we recorded if and when an
IB formed (Fig. S9). As death can preclude IB formation, we
plotted the cumulative risk of IB formation, using a semiparametric
proportional hazards model that incorporates competing effects,
such as death. When we compared the risk of IB formation in
neurons expressing mutant Venus-G2019S-LRRK2 or Venus-
Y1699C-LRRK2 with and without Nrf2, we found that Nrf2 led to
a significantly greater risk of IB formation for the PD-associated
LRRK2 mutants (Fig. 3B).
The targeting of IBs to specific cellular locations is considered an
additional line of defense in the handling of misfolded proteins (40,
41). In the absence of Nrf2, LRRK2 IBs were more heterogeneous
and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and the morphology dif-
fered from cell to cell (Fig. 3C). However, in the presence of Nrf2,
LRRK2 IBs were predominantly restricted to near the nucleus as
compact foci (Fig. 3C). The intracellular location of protein IBs is a
known predictor of IB insolubility (40). Interestingly, insolubility in
high concentrations of detergent is an important characteristic of
many protein IBs found in neurodegenerative diseases (42), and in
the case of prion disease, insolubility is correlated with slower dis-
ease progression (43). Thus, to evaluate the insolubility of LRRK2
IBs, we treated neurons with high concentrations of detergent
(2.5% SDS/2.5% Triton-X-100) (44), which revealed that in the
presence of Nrf2, LRRK2 IBs were more insoluble than those that
formed without Nrf2 (Fig. 3D).
We previously showed that diffuse LRRK2 is toxic in a dose-
dependent manner (5), so we hypothesized that Nrf2 may reduce
mutant LRRK2-associated toxicity by sequestering misfolded

Nrf2 decreases α-synuclein levels by increasing its degradation. (A)
Overexpression of Dendra2–α-synuclein in neurons leads to an increased risk of
death. Number of neurons: Dendra2 = 238, Dendra2–α-synuclein = 239; HR, 2.86;
***P < 0.0001. (B) Neurons expressing Dendra2–α-synuclein were separated into
low-, medium-, or high-expressing neurons. (C) Neurons in the highest tercile of
Dendra2–α-synuclein expression displayed higher risk of death than neurons in
the lowest tercile of Dendra2–α-synuclein expression. Number of neurons in low =
59, medium = 60, and high = 67; HR, 1.54; low versus high *P = 0.03. (D) Steady-
state levels of α-synuclein are lower in neurons expressing Nrf2. Number of
neurons for ctrl = 139, Nrf2 = 96; t test, F value = 16.01; ***P < 0.0001. (E) A
neuron transfected with Dendra2–α-synuclein was pulsed for 1–2 s with 405-nm
light and imaged for several days. (Scale bar, 10 μm.) (F) Neurons expressing Nrf2
had a 10% increase in Dendra2–α-synuclein degradation. The mean slopes were
–0.019 (95% CI –0.021, –0.017) and –0.0173 (95% CI, –0.019, –0.015) for Nrf2 and
control cells, respectively. The posterior probability for a steeper mean slope of
RFP fluorescence in Nrf2 cells was 0.91, indicating that it is overwhelmingly likely
that the degradation of Dendra2–α-synuclein was faster in cells with Nrf2. Num-
ber of neurons, Dendra2–α-synuclein/Ctrl = 400 and Dendra2–α-synuclein/Nrf2 =
377. (G and H) Neurons transfected with Dendra2–α-synuclein and exposed to
0.5 μM fluphenazine (FPZ) or 0.5 μM methotrimeprazine (MTM) show a 24%
(posterior probability, 0.92) and 23% (posterior probability, 0.93) faster degra-
dation of α-synuclein, respectively, compared with vehicle control (DMSO). The
mean slopes for RFP fluorescence were –0.0192 (CI, –0.021, –0.017), –0.0216 (CI,
–0.024 to 0.019), and –0.0218 (CI, –0.024 to 0.019) for neurons treated with vehicle
(veh), 0.5 μM FPZ, and 0.5 μM MTM, respectively. Number of neurons in veh = 490,

 diffuse LRRK2 into more compact IBs. To test this, we mea-
sured levels of diffuse LRRK2 in neurons that had formed IBs
by 32 h posttransfection (Fig. 3E). We found that, in the
presence of Nrf2, neurons with IBs had a significant reduction
in diffuse mutant LRRK2 levels elsewhere in the cell (Fig. 3F).
These findings indicate that a reduction in PD-associated LRRK2
toxicity by Nrf2 is associated with an augmented risk of IB
formation, a reduction in the heterogeneity of IBs, and an increase
in IB detergent resistance and improved survival. This suggests that
Nrf2 promotes a shift of LRRK2 from the diffuse fraction into IBs
and a shift from less ordered IBs to more ordered ones.
Discussion
The prevailing view of Nrf2’s function in the central nervous system
is that it acts by a cell-nonautonomous mechanism to activate genes
that mitigate reactive oxygen species. However, growing evidence
indicates that Nrf2 can act in neurons via a cell-autonomous
manner, leading to transcriptional changes in not only oxidative
stress-related genes but also those related to proteostasis and spe-
cific neuronal functions (45–47). Our work demonstrates that Nrf2
can act in a cell-autonomous manner to potently promote neuronal
protein homeostasis and reduce neurodegeneration caused by
α-synuclein and mutant LRRK2 expression.
Our study provides supporting evidence for Nrf2’s role in the
progression and risk of PD. Genetic association studies linked single
nucleotide polymorphisms that lower Nrf2 promoter activity (48)
with an increased risk of PD (49). Nrf2 was up-regulated in neurons
differentiated from iPSCs derived from PD patients with mutations
in Parkin, another PD-associated gene (50). Furthermore, accumu-
lation of Nrf2 and its targets has been observed in surviving dopa-
minergic neurons in the substantia nigra of PD patients (51, 52),
indicating that the Nrf2 pathway is activated in neurons during the
neurodegenerative process. Previous studies in PD models focused
on Nrf2’s non–cell-autonomous protective effect on neurons, where
expression of Nrf2 in astrocytes reduced neuron death caused by
toxins (20) or mutant A53T α-synuclein (53). In contrast to previous
studies, we altered expression of Nrf2 directly in primary rat neurons
and showed that increased expression of Nrf2 and subsequent acti-
vation of ARE transcription was sufficient to activate endogenous
stress response mechanisms, leading to improved survival of neurons
against toxicity caused by both mutant LRRK2 and α-synuclein.
We also address the effects of chronic activation of Nrf2.
Nrf2’s effect on α-synuclein– and LRRK2-induced degeneration
attenuated with time and was associated with a time-dependent
decrease in Nrf2-dependent transcription, despite a steady level
of Nrf2 expression. This suggests that neurons are undergoing an
adaptive response to Nrf2 that eventually limits its signaling.
Although Nrf2 displays time-dependent effects on PD-associated
phenotypes, it does not eliminate the possibility that Nrf2 may be
used as a therapeutic strategy in a pulsatile or periodic manner to
maximize its benefits and avoid detrimental effects.
Nrf2’s protective effect on neurodegeneration was accompa-
nied by changes in the dynamics of LRRK2 and α-synuclein,
strengthening the concept that activation of endogenous defense
mechanisms protect against proteostasis stress (54) and could be
harnessed for therapeutic intervention. In addition, we support
growing evidence that, in addition to antioxidant genes (55), Nrf2
up-regulates genes involved in proteostasis, including components
of the proteasome (56, 57) and chaperone systems (15, 27). In-
terestingly Nrf2’s effect on protein dynamics differed for α-synuclein
and LRRK2. Nrf2 accelerates the clearance of α-synuclein, short-
ening its half-life and leading to lower overall levels of α-synuclein.
By contrast, Nrf2 promotes the aggregation of LRRK2 into IBs and
promotes the formation of IBs that are more compact and in-
soluble. How Nrf2 leads to different prominent effects on α-synuclein
and LRRK2 dynamics remains unclear. As Nrf2 is activated by a
battery of cellular stresses, including perturbations to proteostasis
(35), the distinct species of misfolded protein might influence the
distinct cellular responses activated by Nrf2. Alternatively Nrf2
may activate the same broad program of gene expression, which
includes multiple aspects of protein homeostasis, for both α-synu-
clein and LRRK2. The differences we observe in terms of Nrf2’s
effects on α-synuclein versus LRRK2 might relate to how those two
proteins interact with different components of the Nrf2 program.
