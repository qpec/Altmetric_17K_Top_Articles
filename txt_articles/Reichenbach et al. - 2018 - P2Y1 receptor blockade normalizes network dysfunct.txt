Astrocytic hyperactivity is an important contributor to neuronal-glial network dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
We have previously shown that astrocyte hyperactivity is mediated by signaling through the P2Y1 purinoreceptor (P2Y1R) 
pathway. Using the APP 
PS1 mouse model of AD, we here find that chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of P2Y1R 
inhibitors normalizes astroglial and neuronal network dysfunction, as measured by in vivo two-photon microscopy, 
augments structural synaptic integrity, and preserves hippocampal long-term potentiation. These effects occur 
independently from β-amyloid metabolism or plaque burden but are associated with a higher morphological complexity 
of periplaque reactive astrocytes, as well as reduced dystrophic neurite burden and greater plaque compaction. 
Importantly, APP 
PS1 mice chronically treated with P2Y1R antagonists, as well as APP 
PS1 mice carrying an astrocyte-
specific genetic deletion (Ip3r2−/−) of signaling pathways downstream of P2Y1R activation, are protected from the decline 
of spatial learning and memory. In summary, our study establishes the restoration of network homoeostasis by P2Y1R 
inhibition as a novel treatment target in AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic and incurable neurodegen-
erative disease characterized by progressive β-amyloid (Aβ) and 
phosphorylated tau accumulation. Although the exact mecha-
nisms underlying AD remain incompletely understood, neuronal 
dysfunction and degeneration appear to be sustained by a com-
bination of detrimental factors that include vascular pathology, 
neuroinflammation, and the dysregulation of neuronal-glial 
networks (Heneka et al., 2015; Palop and Mucke, 2016). Aber-
rant network activity is an especially relevant target in AD, as it 
can be detected across the translational spectrum—from in vitro 
preparations to animal models and patients (Palop and Mucke, 
2016)—and emerges at very early or even presymptomatic stages 
of the disease (Sperling et al., 2009). Hence, targeting network 
imbalance in AD holds the strong potential to delay clinical dis-
ease onset and slow symptom progression.
Most studies in animal models so far have focused on the dis-
equilibrium of neuronal networks, which is characterized by 
seizures and a higher fraction of hyperactive neurons (Palop et 
al., 2007; Busche et al., 2008; Kuchibhotla et al., 2008). However, 
similar to neurons, astrocytes also become hyperactive in AD 
models. Astroglial hyperactivity is most prominent around Aβ 
plaques and, interestingly, occurs independently from neuronal 
activity (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009; Delekate et al., 2014). We 
have previously shown that nucleotides such as ATP and ADP, 
which are released in the proinflammatory environment around 
plaques, activate metabotropic P2Y1 purinoreceptors (P2Y1Rs) 
on astrocytes, leading to an increased frequency of sponta-
neous astroglial calcium events (Delekate et al., 2014). However, 
whether astrocytic hyperactivity ameliorates or aggravates the 
pathogenic pathways and cognitive sequelae of AD has remained 
unclear. Because astrocytes structurally and metabolically sup-
port normal synaptic function and contribute to the regulation 
of blood flow (Petzold and Murthy, 2011; Araque et al., 2014), 
the normalization of astroglial network imbalance may have 
profound consequences for neuronal function in AD. Therefore, 
we here aimed to investigate the effects of long-term P2Y1R 
inhibition in a mouse model of AD. We found that chronic treat-
ment with P2Y1R antagonists normalized neuronal-astroglial 
network activity, restored structural and functional synaptic 
integrity, reduced neuritic dystrophy, and attenuated cognitive 
decline. These beneficial effects were associated with a higher 
morphological complexity of astrocytes around Aβ plaques and 
were in part recapitulated in mice lacking the IP3 receptor type 
2 (IP3R2), i.e., the signaling downstream of P2Y1R activation,

altogether establishing astroglial P2Y1R as a potential treat-
ment target in AD.
Results
P2Y1R is expressed by reactive astrocytes and neurons in 
human AD and APP 
PS1 mice
We used immunohistochemistry to determine the cell types 
expressing P2Y1R in human AD and APP 
PS1 mice. In postmor-
tem cortical and hippocampal sections of neuropathologically 
confirmed cases of AD, we found that the majority of reactive 
astrocytes express P2Y1R (Fig. 1 A), including astroglia located 
around Aβ plaques (Fig. 1 B). A similar pattern was evident in 
APP 
PS1 mice, in which P2Y1R was predominantly expressed 
by reactive astrocytes around Aβ plaques (Fig. 1, C and D), as 
previously reported (Delekate et al., 2014). However, we also 
detected P2Y1R expression in neurons, although this contributed 
to a much smaller fraction of overall expression (Fig. 1, C and 
D). Moreover, in a P2Y1R-specific ELI 
SA assay, the whole-brain 
concentration of P2Y1R strongly increased with age (Spearman 
correlation, ρ = 0.73) and with the level of astrocyte reactivity 
in APP 
PS1 mice (Spearman correlation, ρ = 0.63), but not in WT 
littermates (Fig. 1, E and F). We confirmed that astrocytes were 
not labeled by the antibody used in this study in brain sections 
from P2ry1−/− mice (Fig. S1).
Chronic P2Y1R inhibition reduces neuronal-astroglial network 
hyperactivity in APP 
PS1 mice
We have previously shown that acute P2Y1R inhibition reduces 
astroglial network hyperactivity in APP 
PS1 mice (Delekate et al., 
2014). Therefore, we next explored whether chronic P2Y1R inhibi-
tion could persistently reduce cortical astroglial network activity 
in APP 
PS1 mice. To this end, we implanted osmotic minipumps to 
infuse the P2Y1R antagonist MRS2179 (Boyer et al., 1998) or vehicle

PS1 showed an age-dependent increase of P2Y1R concentration (Spearman correlation, ρ = 0.73) that correlated with progressive reactive 
astrogliosis (GFAP; ρ = 0.63). No increase was seen in WT littermates (ρ = 0.22; n = 9 APP 
PS1 vs. n = 11 WT mice).

intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.). After a 6-wk continuous treat-
ment period, the mice were anesthetized and subjected to calcium 
imaging of cortical network activity using in vivo two-photon 
microscopy of the calcium indicator OGB-1 AM (Fig. 2, A and B). 
Astrocytes were identified by colabeling with sulforhodamine 101 
(SR101), and plaques were labeled with methoxy-X04 (Fig. 2 B).
These experiments revealed that chronic P2Y1R inhibition in 
APP 
PS1 mice strongly reduced astroglial hyperactivity to levels 
similar to WT littermates (Fig. 2 C; Kruskal–Wallis test followed 
by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test for all comparisons). 
MRS2179 had no significant effect on astrocyte activity in WT 
mice, indicating that P2Y1R inhibition does not nonspecifically 
dampen astroglial activity when pathological hyperactivity 
is absent. Moreover, chronic P2Y1R inhibition in APP 
PS1 mice 
resulted in a categorical shift in astroglial activity levels toward 
an inactive/normal-active phenotype (Fig. 2 D) typical for 
anesthetized WT animals (Thrane et al., 2012; Delekate et al., 
2014). Hence, chronic P2Y1R inhibition normalizes cortical 
astrocytic network activity. In addition, as MRS2179 can also 
affect other purinoreceptors (Boyer et al., 1998), we also

but was reduced to levels similar to those of WT littermates in MRS2179-treated or BPTU-treated APP 
PS1 mice. In contrast, astroglial activity was signifi-
cantly increased in MRS2365-treated mice (APP

PS1 + BPTU, n = 6 mice; APP

MRS2365 in transgenic mice (*, P < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test; same mice as in C; mean ± SEM). The cumulative 
distributions of spontaneous neuronal calcium transients in MRS2179-treated or BPTU-treated APP 
PS1 mice were not different from those of vehicle-treated 
or MRS2179-treated WT mice (P > 0.05, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) but were significantly different from those of vehicle-treated or MRS2365-treated APP 
PS1 
mice (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test).

performed experiments using the P2Y1R antagonist BPTU, an 
allosteric inhibitor with a different binding site than MRS2179 
and high selectivity over other P2Y and P2X receptors (Zhang 
et al., 2015). Mice treated for 6 wk with BPTU through osmotic 
minipumps also displayed reduced astroglial hyperactivity 
(Fig. 2 C). Moreover, we found that the P2Y1R agonist MRS2365 
(Chhatriwala et al., 2004) increased network hyperactivity in 
chronically treated APP 
PS1 mice (Fig. 2 C).
Because neuronal network hyperexcitability is another 
hallmark of AD mouse models (Palop et al., 2007; Busche et al., 
2008; Kuchibhotla et al., 2008), we also determined the effects 
of MRS2179, BPTU, and MRS2365 on cortical neuronal calcium 
activity. Interestingly, similar to astroglial activity, chronic treat-
ment with MRS2179 and BPTU also led to a reduction of neuronal 
activity in plaque-bearing APP 
PS1 mice (P < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis 
test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test and Kolmog-
orov–Smirnov test), whereas there was a trend toward higher 
neuronal activity in mice chronically treated with MRS2365 
(Fig. 2, E and F).
Hippocampal astrocytes are hyperactive in APP 
PS1 mice in vivo
As astrocytic hyperactivity in previous studies (Kuchibhotla 
et al., 2009; Delekate et al., 2014) was investigated only in the 
cortex, but the behavioral phenotype of AD models largely 
correlates with hippocampal pathology, we aimed to establish 
whether and to what extent astrocytes in the hippocampus are 
also hyperactive. To this end, we injected adeno-associated 
virus (AAV) encoding the fluorescent calcium indicator 
GCaMP6f under the astrocytic GfaABC1D promoter into the 
hippocampus and imaged astroglial network activity 4 wk 
later using two-photon microscopy through a window that 
was surgically implanted above the right dorsal hippocampus 
(Fig. 3 A). Astrocytes were clearly identifiable by their GCaMP6f 
expression and were spontaneously active (Fig. 3, B and C; and 
Video 1) similar to cortical astrocytes. Compared with age-
matched littermates, the amplitude of the calcium transients 
was significantly higher (P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney test) and 
the number of spontaneously active hippocampal astrocytes 
was increased in APP 
PS1 mice (P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test; 
Fig. 3, D–F). Because of the technically demanding surgical 
preparation of the hippocampal window, it was not possible to 
apply compounds topically or i.c.v. in these animals.
Chronic P2Y1R inhibition reverses synaptic deficits and 
restores structural synaptic integrity in the hippocampus
We next tested whether MRS2179 affects the well-established 
deficits of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of APP 
PS1 
mice. Consistent with previous studies (Gengler et al., 2010), 
long-term potentiation (LTP) of CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral

Whitney test; mean ± SEM), whereas the full duration at half maximum (FDHM) was similar. The fraction of active astrocytes was higher in APP

(**, P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test; APP

synapses was impaired in acute brain slices obtained from 
APP 
PS1 mice compared with slices from age-matched WT 
littermates (Fig. 4, A and B; P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney test). 
Moreover, basal synaptic transmission was also significantly 
impaired in slices from APP 
PS1 mice compared with slices from 
WT animals (Fig. 4 C; P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney test). Next, we 
tested in a second set of experiments whether this impairment 
is also observed in the presence of MRS2179. Importantly, 
the impairment of LTP, as well as the deficit in basal synaptic 
transmission, were not detected in the presence of MRS2179 
(Fig. 4, D–F; P > 0.05, Mann–Whitney test for both comparisons).
To determine the effects of chronic MRS2179 treatment on 
hippocampal CA1 synapses, we performed high-resolution 
confocal microscopy analysis of the colabeled pre- and 
postsynaptic markers synaptophysin and Homer1—i.e., 
synaptic puncta (Shi et al., 2017)—in brain sections from 
APP 
PS1 mice and age-matched WT littermates (Fig. 5 A). As 
expected, there was a strong decrease in the density of synaptic 
puncta in vehicle-treated APP 
PS1 compared with WT mice, 
but interestingly, the density of synaptic puncta was restored 
to near-WT levels in APP 
PS1 mice chronically treated with 
MRS2179 (Fig. 5, A and B; Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s 
multiple comparisons test).
Moreover, to quantify dystrophic neurites around plaques, we 
used immunoreactivity for the lysosome component lysosomal 
associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) as an established proxy 
marker (Condello et al., 2011). We found that the area of dys-
trophic neurites was reduced in MRS2179-treated APP 
PS1 mice 
(Fig. 5, C and D; P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney test), indicating that 
normalization of aberrant network activity confers protection to 
periplaque neurites and synapses.
Chronic P2Y1R inhibition does not affect amyloid metabolism, 
but increases astroglial plaque barrier function
Because Aβ production can be influenced by network activity 
(Palop and Mucke, 2016) and P2Y1R activation may modulate glial 
reactivity (Franke et al., 2012), we next determined the effect of 
6-wk MRS2179 treatment on Aβ metabolism and glial activation.
We found no effect on the overall area covered by GFAP-positive 
astrocytes or Iba1-positive microglia in the cortex or hippocampus 
of APP 
PS1 mice treated with MRS2179 compared with vehicle-
treated mice (Fig. 6, A–D, I, and J; P > 0.05, Mann–Whitney test 
for all comparisons). Moreover, the treatment had no effect on 
cortical and hippocampal Aβ plaque load and size (Fig. 6, E–H 
and K–M; P > 0.05, Mann–Whitney test for all comparisons), as 
measured by IC16 antibody or thioflavin staining. Similarly, levels 
of soluble as well as insoluble Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, determined using 
an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay after sequential 
extraction with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) and SDS 
buffer, were comparable between the two groups (Fig. 6, N and O; 
P > 0.05, Mann–Whitney test for all comparisons). The levels of 
full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its C-terminal 
fragments (CTFs), as well as levels of the APP-degrading enzyme 
neprilysin/CD10, were similar in all groups (Fig. 6, P–T; P > 0.05, 
Mann–Whitney test for all comparisons).
Because glial cells form a dense anatomical barrier around Aβ 
plaques that may help contain the diffusion of neurotoxic Aβ fibrils 
(Condello et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2016), we also determined mor-
phological changes of astrocytes and microglia in the periplaque 
region. We found that the mean plaque intensity—an established 
marker of plaque compaction that is inversely correlated with 
toxic fibril surface area (Condello et al., 2015)—was increased in 
MRS2179-treated APP 
PS1 mice (Fig. 7 A; P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney

test), perhaps explaining the reduction in dystrophic neurite area. 
Moreover, chronic MRS2179 treatment significantly increased the 
density and length of astrocytic process branches and terminal 
process points in the periplaque region and led to an increase in 
the number of periplaque complex astroglial structures (Fig. 7, 
B–E, J, and K; P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney test for all comparisons; 
representative examples are given in Fig. S2). No major changes 
of these parameters were observed in periplaque microglia (Fig. 7, 
F–K; P > 0.05, Mann–Whitney test for all comparisons), indicating 
that the effects of P2Y1R inhibition are predominantly mediated 
by astrocytes.
Chronic P2Y1R inhibition improves learning and 
memory in APP 
PS1 mice
Next, we determined the effects of chronic pharmacological 
treatment on hippocampus-dependent spatial reference learn-
ing and memory. To ensure compatibility with the osmotic 
minipump implantation, we used the Barnes maze test para-
digm, in which mice are trained to memorize the location of a 
hidden escape box (Pompl et al., 1999). We compared APP 
PS1 
mice treated with MRS2179, BPTU, MRS2365, or vehicle with age-
matched WT mice treated with MRS2179 or vehicle. Behavioral 
testing commenced 5 wk after pump implantation (Fig. 8 A). 
During the 4-d acquisition period, the temporal latency and spa-
tial distance covered by the mice until they reached the escape 
box was similar in all groups except for APP 
PS1 treated with the 
P2Y1R agonist MRS2365, which displayed longer latencies and 
distances compared with WT mice (Fig. 8, B–E; P < 0.05, two-
way repeated-measures ANO 
VA and Bonferroni post hoc test and 
Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons 
test, respectively). Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, 
vehicle-treated as well as MRS2365-treated APP 
PS1 mice relied 
on a nonspatial (serial) search strategy, indicated by the contin-
uously high number of serial errors performed before locating 
the escape box (Fig. 8, F–H; P < 0.05, two-way repeated-measures 
ANO 
VA and Bonferroni post hoc test and one-way ANO 
VA and 
Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, respectively). In contrast, 
MRS2179-treated as well as BPTU-treated APP 
PS1 mice, similar to 
WT littermates, switched from a nonspatial to a (targeted) spatial 
search strategy within 1–2 d (Fig. 8, F–H), indicating that P2Y1R 
inhibition improved spatial learning in APP 
PS1 mice. 24 h after 
the last acquisition day, mice were subjected to a probe trial in 
which the escape box was removed. As expected, spatial mem-
ory was strongly impaired in APP 
PS1 mice treated with vehicle 
or MRS2365 (Fig. 8 I; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test 
and Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple compar-
isons test, respectively). However, MRS2179-treated as well as 
BPTU-treated APP 
PS1 mice spent significantly more time in the 
target quadrant, comparable to WT mice, indicating that spatial 
memory was improved in these mice (Fig. 8 I). Motor function, 
measured by the velocity of mice across all days, was similar in all 
groups (Fig. 8 J; P > 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s 
multiple comparisons test).
Astrocyte-specific deletion of metabotropic signaling 
attenuates network dysfunction and improves spatial memory
Finally, to establish whether these effects were mediated by 
astrocytic P2Y1R, as opposed to nonastroglial sources of P2Y1R or 
ionotropic purinoreceptors, we used mice lacking IP3R2 (Ip3r2−/−; 
Li et al., 2005). IP3R2 is the predominant IP3 receptor subtype in 
astrocytes but shows negligible expression in neurons (Sharp et 
al., 1999), thus representing a valid genetic model to study the 
contribution of signaling pathways downstream of astroglial 
metabotropic receptors such as P2Y1R. Spatial learning and memory

that the latency to find the hidden platform was significantly

B; two-way repeated-measures ANO 
VA and Bonferroni post hoc 
test and one-way ANO 
VA followed by Holm–Sidak’s multiple 
comparisons test, respectively). In the probe trial, assessed 24 h 
after the last acquisition day, Appps1+/− × Ip3r2−/− and Appps1−/− × 
Ip3r2−/− mice spent more time in the target quadrant compared with 
nontarget quadrants, whereas Appps1+/− × Ip3r2+/+ mice spent equal 
times in target and nontarget quadrants (Fig. 9 C; Kruskal–Wallis 
test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test), indicating that 
Figure 6. Chronic P2Y1R inhibition has no effects on gliosis, plaque load, and amyloid metabolism. (A–M) MRS2179 (in comparison to vehicle; n = 6

Aβ plaque load and size (IC16 staining) or the density of thioflavin-positive Aβ plaques (P > 0.05, Mann–Whitney test for all comparisons). Cortex (CX) and

astroglial network normalization contributes to spatial memory 
restoration. Motor function, measured by the swimming velocity 
of mice across all days, was similar in all groups (Fig. 9 D; P > 0.05, 
Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test).
To confirm that astroglial hyperactivity was attenuated, we 
subjected these mouse lines to calcium imaging of cortical net-
work activity using two-photon microscopy and found that, as 
expected, astroglial activity was strongly reduced in Appps1+/− × 
Ip3r2−/− compared with Appps1+/− × Ip3r2+/+ mice, but similar to 
Appps1−/− × Ip3r2−/− mice (Fig. 9 E; Kruskal–Wallis test followed by 
Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). Moreover, topical application 
of the P2Y1R agonist MRS2365 had no significant effect on network 
activity in Appps1+/− × Ip3r2−/− mice (Fig. 9 E), confirming suffi-
cient functional suppression of the P2Y1R pathway in these mice.
Discussion
Aberrant network activity is an early and perhaps causal factor 
in cognitive decline and pathological synaptic remodeling, both 
of which are classical hallmarks of AD. Importantly, network 
disequilibrium is evident not only in animal models of AD 
(Busche et al., 2008; Kuchibhotla et al., 2008; Sanchez et al., 
2012), but also in presymptomatic and symptomatic patients 
with AD (Sperling et al., 2009; Reiman et al., 2012; Vossel et 
al., 2016). Interestingly, a large body of evidence suggests that 
network dysfunction is a pathogenic component of AD, and not 
simply an intrinsic compensation for synaptic decline (Palop 
and Mucke, 2016).
Similar to neurons, astrocytes form organized large-scale 
networks (Araque et al., 2014). In AD, astrocytes adopt a reactive 
Figure 7. P2Y1R inhibition increases the morphological barrier function of periplaque hippocampal astrocytes. (A) The mean intensity of hippocampal 
plaques was increased in MRS2179-treated versus vehicle-treated (Veh) APP 
PS1 mice, indicating greater compaction of plaques induced by the drug (n = 5 
mice for each group; age of both groups, 11 mo; *, P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney test). (B–E) The number and terminal points of near-plaque astrocyte branches 
and the length of astrocyte segments were increased by the drug treatment, and there was a trend toward more complex astrocytic structures around plaques

phenotype, suggesting that this morphological alteration may 
also be accompanied by functional changes. Indeed, although 
spontaneous calcium events in astrocytes are rare in anesthe-
tized WT animals (Thrane et al., 2012), the astroglial network 
becomes hyperactive in animal models of AD, especially in the 
vicinity of Aβ plaques (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009; Delekate et al., 
2014), indicating that, similar to neurons, astrocytic network 
dysfunction may also contribute to AD pathogenesis. We have 
previously shown that astrocyte overactivation through P2Y1R 
accounts for a large part of astroglial hyperactivity (Delekate et 
al., 2014). In the present study, we found that reactive astrocytes 
account for the majority of P2Y1R expression in APP 
PS1 mice, 
and that long-term treatment with a P2Y1R inhibitor normal-
izes astroglial network activity to levels normally detected in 
WT animals. Importantly, this astrocytic network normalization 
also reduced neuronal hyperactivity. Although this effect could 
be related to P2Y1R expression by a subpopulation of neurons, 
reactive astrogliosis itself may also induce neuronal hyperex-
citability (Ortinski et al., 2010; Robel and Sontheimer, 2016), 
suggesting that the attenuation of astrocytic network activity by 
P2Y1R inhibition may also modulate neuronal networks. In this 
regard, it is interesting to note that astrocytic P2Y1R have been 
shown to stimulate astroglial glutamate release and shape synap-
tic transmission (Domercq et al., 2006; Jourdain et al., 2007). In 
addition, although microglia remained largely unaffected mor-
phologically by P2Y1R inhibition, some of the observed effects 
may still be mediated by microglia through astrocyte-to-microg-
lia signaling (Liddelow et al., 2017). Although these mechanisms 
will have to be addressed by future studies, the net effect of this 
astroglial-neuronal network normalization by long-term P2Y1R 
inhibition is that synaptic integrity and function are preserved. 
Remarkably, this structural protection is paralleled by a resto-
ration of hippocampal LTP, i.e., a cellular correlate of learning 
and memory. Moreover, we showed that this treatment restored 
spatial learning and memory. This effect appeared to be related 
to an improvement in hippocampal function, as APP 
PS1 mice 
treated with two pharmacologically different antagonists were 
able to use spatial search strategies, whereas vehicle-treated 
or agonist-treated transgenic mice were not. Although future 
studies using cell-specific deletion of P2Y1R will be necessary to 
dissect the individual contribution of astroglia and neurons, our 
data that APP 
PS1 mice carrying an astrocyte-selective deletion 
of the metabotropic signaling pathways downstream of P2Y1R 
show a similar protection from cognitive decline strongly suggest 
a primary role for astrocytes.
These effects occurred in mice at a late stage of Aβ deposition 
in that model and were not paralleled by detectable changes in 
plaque size or load, or in the levels of soluble or insoluble Aβ. 
Interestingly, however, the treatment led to an increase of the 
cellular complexity of reactive astrocytes in the direct vicinity 
of plaques, although the glial marker used in this study rep-
resents only a fraction of the total astrocytic process length, and 
ultrastructural studies are needed to fully explore this question. 
Moreover, the higher astroglial complexity was paralleled by 
greater plaque compaction, indicating that modulation of the 
astrocytic barrier function can help contain the toxic effects of 
Aβ species on periplaque neurites.
Taken together, our study underlines the potential of har-
nessing the astrocytic “arsenal” as a powerful tool to alleviate 
and perhaps prevent the pathological and cognitive sequelae of 
AD. Together with previous studies (Sanchez et al., 2012), our 
data also strengthen the hypothesis that aberrant network activ-
ity itself is an important contributor to pathological synaptic 
remodeling and cognitive decline in AD. Hence, purinoreceptor 
inhibitors may represent attractive candidates to investigate the 
effects of astroglial-neuronal network normalization on AD in 
further preclinical and clinical trials.
Materials and methods
Animals
All experiments were performed according to animal care 
guidelines and approved by the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt 
und Verbraucherschutz of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). 
We used mice that coexpress the human KM67/671NL mutation 
in the APP (APPswe) and human L166P-mutated PS1 under the 
control of the Thy1 promoter on a C57BL/6J background (APP 
PS1-
21; provided by M. Jucker, DZNE, Tübingen, Germany; Radde et 
al., 2006) and their WT age-matched and sex-matched littermates, 
as well as Ip3r2−/− (Li et al., 2005; provided by J. Chen, University 
of San Diego, San Diego, CA). Ip3r2−/− mice were crossed with 
Appps1+/− mice, and Appps1+/− × Ip3r2+/− and Appps1−/− × Ip3r2+/− 
offspring were crossed to generate Appps1+/− × Ip3r2−/−, Appps1−/− 
× Ip3r2−/−, and Appps1+/− × Ip3r2+/+ for experiments. Animals were 
housed in groups on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water 
available ad libitum. Fixed brains of P2y1r−/− mice were provided

PS1 mice, which moved longer distances to reach the escape box compared with WT mice on days 2 
and 3 (#, P < 0.05, two-way repeated-measures ANO 
VA and Bonferroni post hoc test). Similarly, the AUC for the distance moved to the escape box was higher in 
MRS2365-treated APP 
PS1 mice and similar in all other groups (*, P < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). (F) The number of 
“hole errors” as a measure of nonspatial over spatial search strategies was higher on day 4 in vehicle-treated APP 
PS1 and MRS2365-treated mice compared with 
MRS2179-treated or BPTU-treated APP 
PS1 mice as well as MRS2179-treated or vehicle-treated WT mice (#, P < 0.05, two-way repeated-measures ANO 
VA and 
Bonferroni post hoc test). Moreover, MRS2179-treated and BPTU-treated APP 
PS1 mice as well as both WT groups made significantly fewer errors on day 4 versus 
day 1 (P < 0.001), whereas vehicle-treated APP 
PS1 mice did not (*, P < 0.05, two-way repeated-measures ANO 
VA and Bonferroni post hoc test). (G) Cumulative 
hole errors across all days were higher in vehicle-treated APP 
PS1 mice compared with all other groups, but similar to MRS2365-treated APP 
PS1 mice (*, P < 0.05, 
one-way ANO 
VA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison test). (H) Targeted (spatial) versus serial (nonspatial) search strategies in MRS2179-treated and vehicle-treated

except in vehicle-treated and MRS2365-treated APP 
PS1 mice. Vehicle-treated and MRS2365-treated APP 
PS1 mice did not show a preference for the TQ compared 
with all other quadrants (AO; *, P < 0.05, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test), and time spent in the TQ was significantly less for vehicle-treated APP 
PS1 mice 
compared with WT mice (#, P < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). (J) Velocity of mice in the Barnes maze across all days was 
similar in all groups (P > 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). All data are represented as mean ± SEM.

Intracerebroventricular cannulation and drug treatment
MRS2179 (1 mM; Tocris) and MRS2365 (50 µM; Tocris) were 
solubilized in sterile saline; BPTU (10 µM; Tocris) was solubilized 
in DMSO and sterile saline. Mice were implanted s.c. at the 
interscapular region with osmotic minipumps (model Alzet 
2006; delivery rate, 0.15 µl/h for 42 d; Durect) connected to 
Alzet Brain Infusion Kit 3 (anteroposterior [AP] −0.2 mm, 
medial lateral [ML] +1 mm relative to bregma; dorsal ventral 
[DV] +2.5 mm from the brain surface; Durect) for i.c.v. delivery. 
During surgery, animals were anesthetized with a combination 
of isoflurane (1.5% vol/vol), O2 (0.3% vol/vol), and N2O (0.7% vol/
vol) and kept on a heating pad (37°C). Buprenorphine s.c. was 
used as an analgesic. Pumps were filled with saline or compounds 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For topical drug treatment, the dura was removed, and 
MRS2365 (0.5 µM; solubilized in sterile saline) was topically 
applied for 45 min. Agarose (1.5% in artificial cerebrospinal 
fluid [ACSF], in mM: 132 NaCl, 3 KCl, 0.6 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 24.6 
NaHCO3, 3.7 glucose, 6.7 urea) was placed on top of the cortex 
for stabilization, and the window was closed with a cover glass 
(diameter, 5 mm) and sealed with silicone elastomer (Kwik-Sil; 
World Precision Instruments [WPI]).
Stereotactic virus injections
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction, 3%; mainte-
nance, 1–1.5% vol/vol). Body temperature was maintained with a 
heating pad (37°C). Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame, and 
a small hole (∼0.3 mm) was drilled into the skull using a den-
tal drill (coordinates: AP –1.9 mm and ML +1.25 mm relative to 
bregma). AAV5-GfaABC1D-cytoGCaMP6f.SV40 (1 µl; UPenn Vec-
tor Core) was injected at 0.1 µl/min into the dorsal hippocampus 
(DV +1 mm from brain surface) using a syringe with a 34G can-
nula (WPI) connected to a pump (Ultra Micro Pump; WPI). Mice 
received buprenorphine for analgesia (0.05 mg/kg for 3 d) and 
dexamethasone to prevent inflammation (0.2 mg/kg, once).

Appps1+/− × Ip3r2−/− mice was similar to Appps1−/− × Ip3r2−/− mice and significantly lower than in Appps1+/− × Ip3r2+/+ mice. Application of the P2Y1R agonist 
MRS2365 did not change astroglial activity in Appps1+/− × Ip3r2−/− mice, indicating effective suppression of signaling downstream of astrocytic P2Y1R activation 
(*, P < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). All data are represented as mean ± SEM.

Hippocampal window preparation
Hippocampal window surgery was performed 2 wk after virus 
injection and 4 wk before imaging as described previously 
(Schmid et al., 2016). Animals were anesthetized with 
isoflurane (induction, 3%; maintenance, 1–1.5% vol/vol), and 
body temperature was maintained with a heating pad (37°C). 
Mice received s.c. analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg), an 
anti-inflammatory drug (dexamethasone, 0.2 mg/kg), and an 
antibiotic (cefotaxime, 2 g/kg). After fixation in a stereotaxic 
frame, the skin was removed under sterile conditions, and a 
craniotomy (diameter, 3 mm) above the right somatosensory 
cortex (coordinates: AP –1.9 and ML +1.25 relative to bregma) 
was created with a dental drill. The dura was removed, and the 
somatosensory cortex was aspirated with a 21G needle attached to 
a 20-ml syringe with a flexible tube. When the external capsule of 
the hippocampus was reached, the alveus was carefully exposed 
using a 27G needle. The surface of the dorsal hippocampus was 
rinsed with sterile saline until bleeding stopped. Subsequently, a 
metal tube (diameter, 3 mm; height, 1.5 mm) sealed with a glass 
coverslip (diameter, 3 mm) was inserted, and the upper tube edge 
was glued to the skull bone using dental cement. The remaining 
exposed surface of the skull bone was sealed with dental cement, 
and a custom-made metal bar (z-stripe) was glued next to the 
metal tube. The z-stripe allowed repetitive repositioning in a 
custom-made head-holder for in vivo imaging under the two-
photon microscope. After surgery, mice received an analgesic 
(buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg) for 3 d.
Cortical window preparation
Windows were implanted as described previously (Delekate et 
al., 2014). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane 
(induction, 3%; maintenance, 1–1.5% vol/vol) and kept on a heat-
ing pad (37°C). After fixation in a stereotactic frame, the scalp 
was removed, and a craniotomy (diameter, 5 mm) was created 
above the left somatosensory cortex using a dental drill. Agarose 
(1.5% in ACSF) was placed on top of the cortex for stabilization, 
and the window was closed with a cover glass (diameter, 5 mm) 
and sealed with dental cement.
In vivo two-photon microscopy
Mice implanted with a hippocampal window were imaged using 
an upright two-photon microscope (LaVision Trim ScopeII) with 
a 16× objective (NA 0.8, Nikon LWD16x) and three nondescanned 
detectors with bandpass filters (617/73, 460/80, and 525/50 
nm). Texas Red dextran (70 kD; 6.25 mg/ml; Invitrogen) was 
injected i.v. to visualize blood vessels. To visualize Aβ plaques, 
methoxy-X04 (2–5 mg/kg; Tocris; solubilized in PBS with 4% 
Cremophor EL) was injected i.p. 24 h before imaging. During 
imaging, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and kept on 
a heating pad (37°C). Fluorophores were excited at 800 or 920 
nm using a Titan Sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser (Chameleon Ultra II; 
Coherent; 140-fs pulse width, 80-MHz repetition). Z stacks were 
taken (250 × 250 × 300 µm; 816 px; z increment, 3 µm; pixel dwell 
time, 0.95 µs), and XY time-lapse series of astroglial calcium 
activity (260 × 260 µm; 259 px; pixel dwell time, 1.88 µs) were 
subsequently recorded for 10 min at 3.57 Hz at a depth of 100–
200 µm beneath the hippocampal surface.
In mice implanted with a cortical window, the calcium-
sensitive dye OGB-1 AM (Life Technologies; solubilized in 20% 
Pluronic/80% DMSO and diluted to 1 mM with PBS) and SR101 
(100 µM; Sigma) were coinjected into the cortex at a depth of 
100–200 µm using glass micropipettes (tip diameter, 4–10 µm; 
WPI) connected to a pneumatic injector (1 bar, 60–90 s; PDES; 
NPI Electronic). Mice were anesthetized with a combination 
of isoflurane (0.5% vol/vol in 5% O2) and ketamine (50 mg/ml; 
10 µl bolus followed by 1.5 µl/min, administered i.p. through a 
catheter connected to a pump) and imaged using a Trim ScopeII 
microscope (LaVision) with three nondescanned detectors with 
bandpass filters (620/60, 460/80, and 525/50 nm) or an LSM 
7MP (Zeiss) equipped with a Ti:Sa laser (Chameleon Ultra II; 
Coherent) with three bandpass filters (420/80, 500/550, and 
565–610 nm) and one long-pass filter (555 nm). Fluorophores 
were excited at 800 nm. A 20× W Plan-Apochromat (NA 1.0; 
Zeiss) was used for both microscopes. Z stacks of the imaging 
region were taken (Trim ScopeII: XY, 250 × 250 µm, 828 px; Z, 
1-µm step size, 100-µm range, pixel dwell time 0.93 µs; LSM 7MP: 
XY, 249.8 × 249.8 µm, 828 px; Z, 1-µm step size, 100-µm range, 
pixel dwell time 0.79 µs), followed by XY time-lapse series of 
calcium activity (Trim ScopeII: 260 × 260 µm, 250 px, pixel dwell 
time 1.9 µs, frequency 3.55 Hz; LSM 7MP: 249 × 249 µm, 240 px, 
pixel dwell time 2.14 µs, frequency 3.47 Hz) for 10 min at 800 nm. 
Laser power below the objective was kept between 20 and 40 mW 
to minimize laser-induced artifacts and phototoxicity.
Behavioral phenotyping
All data were recorded and analyzed with EthoVision XT9 
(Noldus). For Barnes maze experiments, mice were placed in 
the center of a brightly lit open platform (diameter, 122 cm) 
in the presence of a continuous clicking sound. The platform 
was confined by 20 holes (hole diameter, 5 cm), with an escape 
box (target) fixed below one hole; all other holes were sealed. 
Extramaze cues were present for spatial orientation. 24 h before 
the first training day, the mice were placed in the middle of the 
platform and gently guided with a transparent glass beaker to the 
target. The beaker was placed on top of the target hole, and the 
mice were allowed 5 min to enter the escape box. Once the mice 
had entered the escape box, the clicking sound was stopped and 
they stayed in the escape box for 1 min. During the 4-d training/
acquisition phase, mice performed four trials per day, with an 
intertrial interval of 15 min. For each trial, mice were put at the 
center of the platform in a black tube for 30 s in the presence of 
the clicking sound, and after tube removal were allowed to freely 
explore the maze until they entered the escape box, after which 
the sound was stopped. The mice had 180 s to find the escape 
box. Mice that were not able to find the box were guided to the 
escape box using the glass beaker and left in the box for 1 min. 
On day 5 (probe trial), the escape box was removed, the target 
hole was sealed, and the mice were allowed to freely explore 
the maze for 60 s.
Morris water maze experiments were conducted using a circu-
lar pool (diameter, 110 cm) filled with opacified water at 20°C. The 
maze was virtually divided into four quadrants, with one containing 
a hidden platform (diameter, 10 cm) 1 cm below the water surface. 
Extramaze cues were present for spatial orientation. Mice were

placed into the water in a quasi-random fashion and were allowed 
to search for the platform for 60 s and remain on the platform for 
15 s; if the mice did not reach the platform in the allotted time, they 
were placed onto it manually. Mice were tested in four trials per day 
for five consecutive days with an intertrial interval of 30 min. Mice 
were dried with tissue towels and placed back in their home cages 
after the trials. For the probe trials, which were conducted 24 h after 
the last training session, the platform was removed, and mice were 
put in a new position into the maze and allowed to swim for 60 s.
Electrophysiology
Electrophysiological recordings were performed in acute brain 
slices as previously described (Minge et al., 2017). Briefly, 300-
µm acute hippocampal slices were obtained from APP 
PS1 and 
age-matched WT littermates. Horizontal slices were cut in an 
ice-cold slicing solution containing (in mM) NaCl 60, sucrose 105, 
KCl 2.5, MgCl2 7, NaH2PO4 1.25, ascorbic acid 1.3, sodium pyruvate 
3, NaHCO3 26, CaCl2 0.5, and glucose 10 (osmolarity 300–310 
mOsm) and kept in the solution at 34°C for 15 min before being 
stored at room temperature (21–23°C) in an extracellular solution 
containing (in mM) NaCl 131, KCl 2.5, MgSO4 1.3, NaH2PO4 1.25, 
NaHCO3 21, CaCl2 2, and glucose 10. All solutions were constantly 
bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2. Slices were allowed to rest for at 
least 1 h before recordings commenced, transferred to an interface 
chamber, and superfused with extracellular solution at 34°C. In 
a subset of experiments, MRS2197 (30 µM; Tocris) was added to 
the extracellular solution for 20–30 min before recordings started.
Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were 
recorded through a standard patch pipette (3–4 MΩ) filled with 
extracellular solution and placed in the CA1 stratum radiatum. 
fEPSPs were evoked by electrical stimulation of CA3-CA1 Schaf-
fer collaterals using a bipolar concentric stimulation electrode 
(FHC) placed in the stratum radiatum at the border between 
CA2/3 and CA1. The stimulation intensity was adjusted to obtain 
fEPSPs with half-maximum amplitude (without MRS2197: WT, 
66.1 ± 4 µA, n = 12; APP 
PS1, 69.9 ± 7.6 µA, n = 8; Student’s t test, P 
= 0.68; with MRS2197: WT, 39.7 ± 10.3 µA, n = 7; APP 
PS1, 46 ± 5.8 
µA, n = 11; Student’s t test, P = 0.52).
Basal synaptic transmission was monitored using single stim-
uli (100-µs duration) every 15 s for at least 10 min before induction 
of LTP using theta-burst stimulations (TBSs). During a TBS, eight 
bursts consisting of four stimuli (100 Hz) were applied at 5 Hz. TBS 
were delivered three times with an interval of 1 min. Subsequently, 
single stimuli were applied for 30 min to probe fEPSP potentiation.
Signals were amplified (1000×, EXT-02B; NPI) and filtered 
(high-pass, 0.1 Hz; low-pass, 20 kHz). Data were digitalized at a 
sampling rate of 10 kHz and stored using WinWCP (Strathclyde 
Electrophysiology Software). Analysis of fEPSP slopes was per-
formed offline using Clampfit (Molecular Devices).
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were sacrificed, and one hemisphere was fixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde for 1 d, stored in sucrose (15 and 25%), and embedded 
in Tissue-Tek (Sakura). Saggital sections (30 µm) were obtained 
using a cryostat (Thermo Fisher) and mounted onto slides.
Postmortem human brain tissue sections (4 µm) from AD 
cases were obtained through a collaboration with the Department 
of Neuropathology (University Hospital Bonn, Germany). The 
sections were deparaffined using xylene and descending ethanol 
solutions and incubated for 30 min in 0.21% citric acid (90–95°C).
All brain sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum 
(Vector Labs) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h. 
Subsequently, mouse brain sections were incubated with rabbit 
anti-GFAP (1:500; Z0334; Dako), rabbit anti-P2Y1R (1:200; 
APR009; Almone), rat anti-GFAP (1:1,000; 130300; Invitrogen), 
mouse anti-IC16 (1:250; provided by C. Pietrzik, Mainz University, 
Mainz, Germany); rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:250; 019-19741; Wako), rabbit 
anti-synaptophysin (1:250; ab14692; Abcam), chicken anti-Homer1 
(1:500; 160006; Synaptic Systems), and rat anti-LAMP1 (1:750; 
121602; BioLegend) in 5% normal goat serum and 0.05% Triton 
X-100 overnight at 4°C. Human brain sections were incubated 
with rabbit anti-P2Y1R (1:100; APR009; Almone), rat anti-GFAP 
(1:250; 130300; Invitrogen), and mouse anti-IC16 (1:250). Nuclei 
were stained with Hoechst 33258 (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher). After 
rinsing human sections in Tris buffer and mouse sections in PBS, 
stainings were incubated with secondary antibodies from goat 
(anti–rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, anti–rat Alexa Fluor 633, anti–rabbit 
Alexa Fluor 488, anti–mouse Alexa Fluor 647, anti–rat Alexa Fluor 
647, and anti–chicken Alexa Fluor 647; 1:1,000; Thermo Fisher) in 
PBS and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed, 
and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).
For thioflavin staining, sections were shortly incubated with 
70 and 80% ethanol and stained with 1% thioflavin S (Sigma) in 
80% ethanol for 15 min. Subsequently, sections were rinsed in 
80 and 70% ethanol and distilled water, counterstained with 
Hoechst, and mounted as described above.
Images were acquired using either a confocal laser-scanning 
microscope (LSM 700; Zeiss) with a 40× (NA 1.3) or 63× (NA 
1.4) objective or a slide scanner (Axio Scan.Z1, Zeiss) with a 10× 
objective (NA 0.45), with the following filter settings: LSM700, 
490–555 BP, 640 LP, 490 SP; AxioScan.Z1, 470/40 BP, 525–50 BP, 
587/25 BP, 647/70 BP, 640/30 BP, 690/50 BP. The same image 
acquisition settings were used for each staining.
Protein biochemistry
Mice were sacrificed, and one hemisphere was quickly transferred 
to liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Protein extraction was per-
formed by homogenization in PBS, pH 7.4, and 1% phosphatase 
inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher) and 1% protease inhibitor cock-
tail (Thermo Fisher) using a ceramic bead homogenizer (Precellys; 
VWR). Homogenates were extracted in RIPA buffer (in mM: 49.96 
Tris, pH 7.2, 149.6 NaCl, 25.6 NP-40, 24 Na deoxycholate, and 6.8 SDS) 
and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 g. The pellet containing insol-
uble Aβ was solubilized in SDS buffer (in mM: 69.2 SDS and 24.98 
Tris, pH 7.5). Protein concentration was measured using a BCA Pro-
tein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher) and a FLUOstar Omega reader (BMG).
For protein gel electrophoresis, samples were solubilized in 4× 
LDS buffer (Life Technologies), boiled for 10 min at 95°C, centrifuged 
for 5 min at 20,000 g at 4°C, and loaded on 4–12% NuPAGE Novex 
Bis-Tris-midi gels (Life Technologies). SeeBlue Plus2–prestained 
protein standard (Thermo Fisher) was used to determine molecular 
weights. After electrophoresis, the samples were transferred to 
nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 µm; Bio-Rad). For CTF detection, 
the membranes were incubated for 1 min in 1× Tris-buffered saline

(2.73 M NaCl and 39.9 mM Tris, 96°C, pH 7.6). All membranes were 
blocked in 5% nonfat skim milk powder (Biomol) in 1× Tris-buffered 
saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (Merck) for 1 h at room temperature. 
Full-length APP was detected using 6E10 antibody (1:100,000; SIG-
39320-1000; BioLegend), CTFs were detected using C1/6.1 antibody 
(1:1,000; 802801, BioLegend), neprilysin was detected using an 
anti-CD10 antibody (1:500; AF1126, R&D Systems), and actin was 
detected using an anti–β-actin antibody (1:8,000; A2103; Sigma). 
Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence 
reaction (Stella 3200; Raytest).
ELI 
SA quantification of P2Y1R was conducted using whole-
brain homogenates (25 mg/ml) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (EL017326MO; Cusabio). Quantitative determination 
of Aβ was performed using an electrochemiluminescence triplex 
ELI 
SA for Aβ1–38, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–42 (Aβ Peptide Panel 1 6E10 Kit; 
Meso Scale Discovery) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions using a SEC 
TOR Imager 2400 reader (Meso Scale Discovery).
Data analysis
Data analysis was conducted blinded for pharmacological 
intervention or genotype. Calcium imaging data were imported 
into ImageJ 1.50i (National Institutes of Health) and stabilized 
using the Image Stabilizer plugin for ImageJ (K. Li, Carnegie Mellon 
University, Pittsburgh, PA). Regions of interest (ROIs) of OGB-1–
positive cells and GCaMP6f-expressing astrocytes were defined 
manually. OGB-1–positive cells were considered astrocytes when 
they were colabeled with SR101. Neurons were identified manually 
by their morphology and the absence of SR101. For all calcium data, 
fluorescence over time was determined for each ROI, converted 
to ΔF/F, and imported into Matlab R2013b (MathWorks). After 
removal of outliers using a median filter and smoothing using a 
Gaussian filter, peak amplitude, time to peak, peak to baseline, 
and full duration at half maximum (FDHM) were determined 
for each signal using a custom-written algorithm in Matlab. Each 
time-lapse series that met this criterion was plotted together with 
the respective video file for visual inspection and verification. 
Astrocytes were defined as hyperactive based on established 
criteria (activity, ≥0.4 events/min; Delekate et al., 2014).
All immunohistochemical data points represent mean values 
of 5–10 brain sections per mouse. Immunohistochemical images 
were imported into ImageJ, converted to 8-bit gray level images, 
and smoothed using a Gaussian filter. After contrast enhancement 
(0.4% saturated pixels), images were binarized using ImageJ 
(plaque stainings, automated MaxEntropy algorithm; synaptic 
puncta stainings, automated Otsu algorithm; for GFAP and Iba1, 
a threshold defined as the mean background intensity plus the 
SD of background intensity multiplied by 2 was used). Astrocyte, 
microglia, and plaque area coverage as well as the number and size 
of plaques and LAMP1-positive dystrophic dendrites per area were 
quantified using ImageJ. The plaque area was subtracted from the 
area covered by dystrophic neurites before data analysis. To quantify 
synaptic puncta, colocalized synaptophysin-positive or Homer1-
positive punctuate signals were counted in thresholded single-
plane confocal images using the Synapse Counter plugin for ImageJ 
(Dzyubenko et al., 2016) with a predefined puncta size range of 0.9–
20 µm2. For periplaque morphological complexity quantification, 
high-resolution stacks were subjected to background removal 
(plaque stainings, automated Otsu algorithm; GFAP/Iba1 stainings, 
automated Huang algorithm; intensity thresholds were calculated 
based on maximum-intensity projections), and for each channel, 
3D particles (plaque channel, ≥600 voxels; glia channel, ≥30 voxels) 
were reconstructed using a Flood-Filler algorithm. Plaque mean 
intensity was calculated by the mean of all plaque voxels. Glial 
particles were considered as periplaque when they contained ≥1 
voxels with a distance ≤2r to the plaque center. Near-plaque glial 
particles were smoothed using a Gaussian filter (sigma, 1.0 px), 
skeletonized using the Skeletonize3D plugin, and analyzed using 
the Analyze Skeleton plugin.
We used Mann–Whitney test or Student’s t test for comparisons 
between two groups; Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multi-
ple comparisons test or one-way ANO 
VA and Dunnett’s multiple 
comparison test to compare several groups; two-way repeated- 
measures ANO 
VA and Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple 
 
measurements in the same groups; Fisher’s exact test to compare 
proportions; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to compare cumulative 
distributions; and Spearman correlation coefficient to quantify 
correlations. Data were analyzed using Prism 7 (GraphPad) and 
are expressed as mean ± SEM. P < 0.05 was accepted as statisti-
cally significant.
