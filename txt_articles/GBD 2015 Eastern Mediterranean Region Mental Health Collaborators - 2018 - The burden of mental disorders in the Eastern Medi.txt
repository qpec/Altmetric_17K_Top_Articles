Abstract
Objectives Mental disorders are among the leading causes
of nonfatal burden of disease globally.
Methods We used the global burden of diseases, injuries,
and risk factors study 2015 to examine the burden of
mental disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean region
(EMR). We defined mental disorders according to criteria
proposed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
disorders IV and the 10th International Classification of
Diseases.
Results Mental
disorders
contributed
to
4.7%
(95%
uncertainty interval (UI) 3.7–5.6%) of total disability-ad-
justed life-years (DALYs), ranking as the ninth leading
cause of disease burden. Depressive disorders and anxiety
disorders were the third and ninth leading causes of non-
fatal burden, respectively. Almost all countries in the EMR
had higher age-standardized mental disorder DALYs rates
compared to the global level, and in half of the EMR
countries, observed mental disorder rates exceeded the
expected values.
Conclusions The burden of mental disorders in the EMR is
higher than global levels, particularly for women. To
properly address this burden, EMR governments should
implement nationwide quality epidemiological surveillance
of mental disorders and provide adequate prevention and
treatment services.

Introduction
Mental illness is a growing public health concern. Findings
from Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
Study 2015 (GBD 2015) showed that mental disorders are
among the highest ranking causes of nonfatal burden
globally (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and
Prevalence
Collaborators
2016).
More
specifically,
depressive disorders and anxiety disorders were the third
and ninth leading contributors to years lived with disability
(YLDs)—a measure of nonfatal burden. The global
prevalence and nonfatal burden of mental disorders were
905,733,400 cases and 124,193,900 YLDs, respectively.
Five percent of global DALYs and 15.7% of global YLDs
were due to mental disorders (Kassebaum et al. 2016). One
DALY represents the loss of a healthy year of life and
aggregates the YLDs with the years of life lost (YLLs) due
to premature mortality.

fined group of countries comprising Afghanistan, the Arab

 Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran), Jordan, the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia), Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya,
Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, the Republic
of Yemen (Yemen), Somalia, Sudan, the Syrian Arab
Republic (Syria), Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE). Its population was estimated to be 628 million in
2014 (World Health Organization Regional Office for the
Eastern Mediterranean 2014). The EMR is a very hetero-
geneous region where member states vary significantly in
terms of their gross domestic product, sociodemographic
profiles, health indicators, and health system capacities and
coverage (Mandil et al. 2013).
Over the past two decades, the EMR has undergone
significant
improvements
in
health
status,
including
increased life expectancy and reductions in child mortality
(Memish 2014; Mokdad et al. 2014, 2016a; Moradi-Lakeh
et al. 2016). As people in the region are living longer, the
burden of chronic diseases, including mental disorders, is
expected to rise. Increasing mental disorder burden with
population aging, especially in developing countries, has
been described in the literature (Sathyanarayana Rao and
Shaji
2007;
World
Health
Organization
2016).
The
demographic and epidemiological changes in the EMR
have had a major impact on the organization and delivery
of mental health services. The population in EMR is very
young, where the median age is about 23 years, around
60% of the population is between 15 and 59 years of age,
and one third is below 15 years of age (World Health
Organization 2013a).
Moreover, 85% of the EMR population is or has been
(in the past quarter century) in a complex emergency sit-
uation resulting in a high prevalence of depression, anxiety,
and post-traumatic stress disorder (Ghosh et al. 2004).
Since 2010, the region has witnessed economic and polit-
ical unrest (Mokdad et al. 2016b). The latter were seen in
Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen. Currently, Syria is in a
state of civil war. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Palestine,
Lebanon and Somalia frequently experience disturbances
as well. Conflict predisposes a population to the develop-
ment of mental disorders (Murthy and Lakshminarayana
2006). Stressors of war include loss (human or material)
and grief, safety concerns, disruption of the fabric of
society, loss of identity, and potential discrimination with
displacement (Hassan et al. 2016).
No previous studies have assessed the burden of mental
disorders in the EMR collectively. Using data from GBD
2015, we aim to explore the burden of mental disorders in
the EMR by country, age group, sex, type of mental dis-
order, and income group from 1990 to 2015. We have
previously published a study on the burden of mental dis-
orders in the EMR between 1990 and 2013 using findings
from GBD 2013. We now update the burden estimates
using a wide range of updated and standardized analytical
procedures.
Methods
Case definition
In this study, we present GBD 2015 results for mental
disorders, excluding substance use disorders. The GBD
2015 mental disorders grouping consisted of anxiety dis-
orders, autistic spectrum disorders (autism and Asperger’s
syndrome), conduct disorder, eating disorders (anorexia
nervosa and bulimia nervosa), schizophrenia, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder,
depressive disorders (major depressive disorder and dys-
thymia), and idiopathic developmental intellectual dis-
ability (a residual category capturing intellectual disability
not attributed to any of the other causes in the study). We
defined mental disorders according to criteria proposed in
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
IV (DSM-IV) and the International Classification of Dis-
eases 10 (ICD-10) (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Inci-
dence and Prevalence Collaborators 2016). The DSM-IV
and ICD-10 definitions of the mental disorders described in
this study are published in detail in the GBD 2015 nonfatal
burden capstone study (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury
Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators 2016).
Calculation of burden (YLDs)
The estimation of YLDs for a given disorder is a product of
epidemiological data that accommodates the number of
people affected as well as the severity and disability
associated with their symptoms. That is, YLDs are calcu-
lated by multiplying the prevalence of a disorder by its
severity and comorbidity-adjusted disability weight. YLDs
for previous GBD iterations were re-estimated using the
same methods to allow meaningful comparisons of changes
over time.
Epidemiologic inputs
Prevalence, incidence, remission or duration, and excess
mortality data for mental disorders were captured through a
systematic review of the literature. In GBD 2010, a liter-
ature search was conducted in three stages involving
electronic searches of the peer-reviewed literature (via
Medline, Embase and PubMed), gray literature, and expert
consultation. The agreed approach for mental disorders was
to conduct electronic database searches on a rolling basis.
All three stages of the GBD 2010 literature review were
repeated
for
GBD
2013
to
capture
additional
data

 published up to 2013. For GBD 2015, only stages two and
three of the literature review were conducted, with another
electronic database search due for mental disorders in the
next iteration of GBD studies. The inclusion criteria for
epidemiologic studies stipulated that: (1) the publication
year must be from 1980 onward; (2) ‘‘caseness’’ must be
based on clinical threshold as established by the DSM-IV
or ICD-10; (3) sufficient information must be provided on
study method and sample characteristics to assess the
quality of the study; and (4) study samples must be rep-
resentative of the general population (i.e., inpatient or
pharmacological treatment samples, case studies, veterans
or refugee samples were excluded). No limitation was set
on the language of publication. Methods used for this
systematic review have been reported in greater detail
elsewhere (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and
Prevalence Collaborators 2016). Data from 108 epidemi-
ologic studies were used to estimate the burden of mental
disorders in the EMR in GBD 2015; a full list of the studies
is available in Appendix 1 in supplementary.
Disease modeling
For each disorder, epidemiological estimates from the litera-
ture review were pooled using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian
meta-regression tool. The tool used in GBD 2010 and GBD
2013, DisMod-MR, is based on a generalized negative bino-
mial model that: (1) uses an incidence–prevalence–mortality
mathematical model to enforce internal consistency between
estimates from different epidemiological parameters; (2)
estimates data for countries and world regions with few or no
available input data based on random effects for country,
regions, and their corresponding super-region groupings; (3)
deals with variability in the data due to measurement bias, or
alternatively, ecological factors through the use of study- and
country-level covariates; and (4) propagates uncertainty
around the raw epidemiological data through to the final
estimates. For GBD 2015, the computational engine of Dis-
Mod-MR 2.1 remained unchanged, but we substantially
rewrote the code that organizes the flow of data and settings at
eachleveloftheanalyticalcascade.GreaterdetailonDisMod-
MR 2.1 is available elsewhere (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury
Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators 2016).
Disability weights
Disability weights are the general public’s assessment of
the severity of health loss associated to the cause. Dis-
ability weights were derived using the GBD 2010 method
of pairwise comparison questions in population surveys (of
those aged 18 and over) conducted in Bangladesh,
Indonesia,
Peru,
Tanzania,
Hungary,
Italy,
Sweden,
Netherlands, and the United States and an open access
internet survey. Respondents considered two hypothetical
individuals with different health states and were asked to
indicate which person they perceived as healthier. In GBD
2013, methodological advances were introduced to dis-
ability weighting, including new data capturing many
newly published or unpublished data sources for the dis-
orders included in GBD. A disability weight ranging
between 0 (equivalent to perfect health) and 1 (equivalent
to death) was generated for 235 health states which toge-
ther reflected all causes of nonfatal burden in GBD 2015
(Salomon et al. 2015; GBD 2015 Disease and Injury
Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators 2016).
Severity distributions
Sequelae were further defined in terms of severity following
the same approach for estimating the distribution of severity
as in GBD 2013. Details on the severity distributions for
mental disorders are available elsewhere (GBD 2015 Disease
and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators 2016).
Comorbidity adjustment
GBD 2015 YLD estimates were adjusted for the effect of
comorbidity between diseases. Details on the process are
available elsewhere (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Inci-
dence and Prevalence Collaborators 2016).
Calculation of burden (DALYs)
We calculated DALYs as the sum of YLDs and YLLs.
YLLs were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths
due to the given disorder at a particular age by the standard
life expectancy at that age. However, death records used in
GBD 2015 followed ICD-10 rules for categorical attribu-
tion of cause of death to a single underlying cause and,
therefore, did not document any deaths due to mental
disorders, except for schizophrenia and eating disorders.
Socio-demographic index
In GBD 2015, we constructed a summary metric referred to
as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) based on measures
of income per capita, average years of schooling among
people aged 15 years and older, and total fertility rate
(Kassebaum et al. 2016). SDI values were scaled to a range
of 0–1, with 0 equaling the lowest income, lowest
schooling, and highest fertility rate observed from 1980 to
2015, and 1 equaling the highest income, highest school-
ing, and lowest fertility rate observed during that time. The
final SDI score was computed as the geometric mean of
each of the components. We compared observed patterns of
mental disorder YLDs with those expected on the basis of

 SDI, allowing us to explore where health gains exceeded—
or lagged behind-corresponding changes in development.
Classification of EMR countries
In an attempt to properly track the health status in the EMR
countries, we divided the region into three categories
according to the gross national income (GNI) per capita. The
first category represented the low-income countries (LICs)
with an average GNI per capita of $523 (GBD 2015 Disease
and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators 2016;
GBD 2015 Maternal Mortality Collaborators 2016; GBD
2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators 2016;
GBD 2015 Risk Factors Collaborators 2016; Kassebaum
et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016). On the opposite end of the
spectrum were some oil-rich, high-income countries (HICs)
with an average GNI per capita of $39,688. The nations that
lied in between were the middle-income countries (MICs)
with an average GNI per capita of $3,251. The three groups
were LICs: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Yemen, and Somalia;
MICs: Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco,
Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, and Tunisia; and HICs:
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the UAE.
Results
In 2015, the EMR generated a total of 229.2 million
DALYs (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 194.8–267.6) of
which 10.7 million DALYs (7.1–15.0) were due to mental
disorders. In other words, mental disorders contributed to
4.7% (3.7–5.6%) of total DALYs in the EMR in 2015,
ranking as the ninth leading cause of disease burden.
In 2015, the EMR generated a total of 67.1 million
YLDs (46.9–91.2) of which 10.7 million YLDs (7.1–14.9
million) were due to mental disorders. In other words,
mental disorders contributed to 15.9% (15.1–16.4%) of
total YLDs in the EMR in 2015, ranking second to mus-
culoskeletal
disorders
which
contributed
to
16.1%
(14.2–18.2%) of total YLDs. At a more detailed level,
depressive disorders and anxiety disorders were the third
and ninth leading causes of YLDs, respectively.
Figure 1 shows the composition of mental disorder
DALYs by type of disorder for both sexes combined in the
EMR in 2015. Depressive disorders (42.1%), followed by
anxiety disorders (21.5%), were the greatest contributors to
mental disorder DALY numbers.
Figure 2 shows the composition of mental disorder
DALY rates by age, sex, and disorder type in the EMR in
2015. DALY rates were higher for females across all age
groups, except for those under age 15. The highest rate of
DALYs occurred in the 25–49 age group, with a peak in the
35–39 age group for both sexes combined, females, and
males. The age pattern in males and females was different.
In females, DALY rates increased progressively from birth
up
to
age
35–39
(3131
DALYs/100,000)
and
then
decreased progressively with age. In males, DALY rates
peaked
at
age
15–19
(1929
DALYs/100,000)
and
decreased at age 20–24 (1860 DALYs/100,000), only to
rise again and peak at age 35–39 (2075 DALYs/100,000).
The burden associated with depressive disorders and anx-
iety disorders rose abruptly in adolescence for both sexes.
Depressive disorder burden peaked between 40 and
44 years, whereas anxiety disorder burden peaked between
15 and 19 years. For schizophrenia, the burden peaked
between 40 and 49 years while bipolar disorder peaked
between 25 and 29 years. Conduct disorder and ADHD
peaked between 10 and 14 years. Supplementary e-Table 1
details the values of the DALY rates depicted in the figure.
Figure 3 shows the age-standardized rate of mental
disorder DALYs over time for males, females, and both
combined in the EMR and globally. The rate of DALYs
remained almost constant from 1990 to 2015 in the EMR
for both males and females and globally. EMR DALY rates
in females were consistently higher than their male coun-
terparts and in the EMR compared to the global rates from
1990 to 2015. The rate of DALYs in males was lower than
the global level. Supplementary e-Table 2 details the val-
ues of DALY rates depicted in the figure. None of these
differences were statistically significant. Table 1 shows the
rankings (in age-standardized DALY rates) of each mental
disorder in the EMR in 2015 compared to 1990. All mental
disorders ranked higher in 2015.
Figure 4 shows the rate of mental disorder DALYs in
the EMR in 2015 by income grouping and sex. The DALY
rates were similar across income groups, ranging from
1725.9 DALYs/100,000 in LIC to 1758.2 DALYs in HIC.
Across these groups, females had higher mental disorder
DALY rates compared to males. All EMR income groups
had higher rates of DALYs compared to global levels.
Supplementary e-Table 3 details the values of DALY rates
depicted in the figure. None of these differences were
statistically significant.
Figure 5 shows the age-standardized rate of mental
disorder DALYs in the EMR and globally over time, by
income grouping. The DALY rates remained almost con-
stant in the EMR income groups and globally. Differences
between income groups and over time were not statistically
significant.
e-Figure 1 shows the age-standardized rate of mental
disorder DALYs in the EMR, by country and sex. The
countries are ranked in increasing order of age-standard-
ized mental disorder DALY rates for both sexes combined.
All countries in the EMR, except Egypt, had higher age-
standardized mental disorder DALY rates compared to the
global value.

 e-Figure 2 shows the age-standardized observed mental
disorder DALY rates by EMR country compared with the
expected values on the basis of each country’s SDI. For the
EMR, SDI in 2015 ranged from 0.151 for Somalia to 0.875 for
the UAE. The area between the observed and expected curves
represents the discrepancy between both values (D = ob-
served-expected). The countries are ranked in the order of
decreasing D. In half of the EMR countries, observed mental
disorder DALYs exceeded the expected values.
Discussion
Our study reveals a number of findings that are relevant to
setting a mental health agenda for the EMR. The burden
associated with mental disorders has not seen a significant
drop in the EMR (and globally) over the last quarter cen-
tury, and females continue to suffer a bigger burden of
mental illness. The mental disorder burden in the politi-
cally and economically stable high-income countries is
comparable to that in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs) of the region, which include some countries in
complex emergency situations. Almost all countries in the
EMR have a bigger burden of mental disorders compared
to the global rate.
Epidemiological transition
While the rate of mental disorder DALYs has not signifi-
cantly changed over time, the ranking of these disorders
shows a different picture. Compared to 1990, there was an
increase in the amount of burden mental disorders

 contribute to the total burden. This epidemiological tran-
sition is consistent with that seen globally, especially at
higher SDIs (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and
Prevalence Collaborators 2016). The increasing mental
health burden is mainly attributable to population growth
and aging rather than an increase in prevalence rates. This
is an important finding to be considered when setting
public health agendas for the region as more people will be
experiencing mental disorders and for longer durations.
Women’s mental health
Females have a higher burden of mental disorders in the
EMR. Rates of mental disorders, however, only partially
explain gender disparities in mental health. Risk factors,
timing of illness onset, diagnosis, treatment, and adjust-
ment to a chronic illness are to be accounted for (World
Health Organization 2006). Women in this part of the
world are particularly vulnerable to developing mental
illness, namely depressive disorders. With globalization
and urbanization of most EMR societies, women may be
exposed to numerous stressors. This distress may have
repercussions on the entire household and children in
particular, as adjustments to new social structures become
necessary (Eloul et al. 2009). According to the World
Bank, there has been a 47% increase in women’s partici-
pation in the labor market of the Middle East and North
Africa region from 1960 to 2000 (World Bank 2003).
Gender roles in the region may partially contribute to a
higher
burden
of
mental
illness
among
women.

 Socioeconomic disadvantage, low income and income
inequality, low or subordinate social status and rank, and
lack of autonomy are some examples of this polarity
(World Health Organization 2006). The impact of patri-
archy and women’s lack of empowerment on mental health
is thoroughly evaluated in the literature (Niaz and Hassan
2006). Moreover, cultural factors, high birthrates, and
young ages at first conception may contribute to higher
rates of postpartum depression (Eloul et al. 2009). Perinatal
mental disorders are particularly concerning for their
effects on the development of infants and children (World
Health Organization 2010). In addition, the region wit-
nesses one of the highest rates (37.0%) of intimate partner
violence in the world (compared to 25.4% in Europe and
29.8% in the Americas) (World Health Organization
2013b). Women are also more likely to be diagnosed with
depression compared to men with similar scores on stan-
dardized measures of depression (Callahan et al. 1997;
Stoppe et al. 1999).
The burden by disorder type
Depression is the highest contributor to the burden fol-
lowed by anxiety disorders. This is because of the higher
prevalence of these disorders as well as the disability
associated with them. It is worth mentioning that some

 highly disabling conditions, such as acute schizophrenia,
do not rank high in YLDs owing to their low prevalence
(Ferrari et al. 2014). This latter condition, however, had the
highest disability weight (0.778) among mental disorders in
GBD 2015 (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and
Prevalence Collaborators 2016). Under the age of 15,
males contribute more greatly to the burden of mental
disorders, primarily due to the higher burden of autism in
males under age five and conduct disorder in males ages
5–15. Indeed, epidemiologic studies from the region indi-
cate a high male to female ratio of autistic spectrum dis-
orders (Elsabbagh et al. 2012).
Observed vs expected rates
According to GBD 2015 findings, sizeable discrepancies
occurred for observed and expected YLDs based on SDI
throughout North Africa and the Middle East, probably
reflecting the uneven achievements in development found
in this region (GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and
Prevalence Collaborators 2016). At a regional level,
observed depression YLD rates exceeded expected rates
based on SDI. This implies that the EMR’s income per
capita, educational levels and fertility rates were not
commensurate with the high burden of depression seen in
the region. High-income countries in the EMR had the
highest SDIs in 2015 but had observed depression YLD
rates that exceeded expected rates based on SDI. This is not
consistent with the global trend where the proportion of life
expectancy spent with disability declined slightly with
increasing SDI (Kassebaum et al. 2016).
Capacity of EMR versus burden
This high burden of mental disorders is particularly chal-
lenging to the EMR, where 16 out of the 22 countries in the
region belong to the LMIC group. WHO’s 2014 Mental
Health Atlas (World Health Organization 2014) described
the preparedness of the EMR to deal with mental health at
a system level. The mental health workforce per 100,000
population in the EMR was 7.3 compared to a value of 9
and 43.5 globally and in the WHO European region. A
study published in 2005 showed that Lebanon had the
highest provision of psychiatric services with one psychi-
atrist per 45,000 population (Al-Krenawi 2005). A more
recent paper in 2012 reported the highest proportions of
psychiatrists in Bahrain (5 per 100,000), Qatar (3.4 per
100,000) and Kuwait (3.1 per 100,000) (Okasha et al.
2012). Countries like Iraq, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Syria,
and Yemen had fewer than 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000
population. It is important to note, however, that most of
these studies had design weaknesses, meaning all outcomes
must be interpreted with caution. The region’s WHO-
Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (World
Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern
Mediterranean 2010)
showed
that
the
median-treated
prevalence of mental disorders was 0.31%, thereby sug-
gesting a big gap in treatment. The unmet needs of children
and adolescents were greater than those of adults. This is
alarming in the region where a big proportion of the pop-
ulation is under 19 years of age (World Health Organiza-
tion 2010). Compared to the $3–$4 USD per capita
spending on mental health in the US, the region spends an
average of $0.15 USD per capita with only 2% of the
governments’ health budgets allocated to mental health
(which compares to the 5–10% required to match con-
temporary comprehensive healthcare systems) (Gater and
Saeed 2015). This level of spending is observed across
low-, middle- and high-income countries of the EMR. Not
only are the resources scarce but also inefficiently used and
inequitably distributed. Stigma further limits the use of
available resources. Moreover, there is little integration of
mental health in primary health care in much of the region
(World Health Organization Regional Office for the East-
ern Mediterranean 2010).
Some governments within the EMR have already taken
action to address the problematic increase in mental dis-
order burden. Qatar has launched its 2013–2018 Mental
Health Strategy which aims to increase availability and
utilization of mental health services using comprehensive
standards and guidelines (Supreme Council of Health, State
of Qatar and Hamad Medical Corporation, Primary Health
Care 2013). Kuwait is taking action to integrate mental
health in primary health care in light of the stigma asso-
ciated with mental illness and its impact on help seeking,
especially in the EMR (Almazeedi and Alsuwaidan 2014).
A study found that pharmacologic and/or psychosocial
treatment packages can be offered at low prices in LMICs,
including Morocco and Iran. It is important to point out
that the development of psychosocial interventions needs
to be tailored to the culture in the EMR. Most interventions
used today in the region are simply exported from research
in more developed nations instead of being adopted in a
culturally sensitive fashion (Chisholm et al. 2007).
Limitations
Our study has a number of limitations. First, our findings
were based upon best available secondary data and models
that cannot be verified across geographies or time within the
same region due to historical circumstances and constraints
of local resources. Most countries in the EMR lack quality
epidemiological data to describe the national prevalence and
burden of mental disorders and to provide quality represen-
tative data input for the GBD estimations. Raw prevalence
data was available for 10 of the 22 EMR countries: Egypt,
S32
GBD 2015 Eastern Mediterranean Region Mental Health Collaborators
123
 Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, the
UAE, and Yemen. A list of all data points used in this study
are available via the Global Health Data Exchange (http://
ghdx.healthdata.org). When data were of poor quality or
unavailable, we relied on modeling techniques to generate
the estimates using other available variables and the infor-
mation for neighboring countries or countries with a similar
health profile in the region. While this allowed us to include
all EMR countries in our burden of disease analysis and
generate collective measures for such a heterogeneous group
of countries, it is important for countries in the region to
facilitate the collection of high quality epidemiological data
for mental disorders. Note, however, that the limitation of
data availability is partly captured by the estimates of
uncertainty presented in our results. Second, disability
weights in GBD studies intentionally capture health loss
while not attempting to capture welfare loss and hence do not
reflect the economic and familial effects of mental disorders.
In addition, given the subjective nature of the symptoms of
mental illness, many individuals in cultures who express
mental disorders differently from the ICD-10 diagnostic
criteria were not captured by GBD. Third, deaths that were
causally linked to mental disorders were largely captured
under other causes. This is because an outcome could only be
listed once in the GBD cause list. Vital registrations rarely
list a mental disorder as a cause of death. For instance, major
depressive disorder-related deaths from suicide or ischemic
heart disease were captured under intentional injuries and
cardiovascular disease, respectively. Fourth, DSM-IV and
ICD-10 diagnostic criteria, mainly established in developed
nations, may not be sensitive to all cross-cultural presenta-
tions of mental disorders. Many patients in the EMR attribute
their psychiatric symptoms to physical causes, probably
secondary to stigma. This would, therefore, bias the mental
disorder burden estimates for the region. It is important to
note here that none of the EMR countries were included in
the group where surveys were done to estimate disability
weights.
