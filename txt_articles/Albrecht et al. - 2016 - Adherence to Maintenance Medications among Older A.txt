Abstract
Rationale: Among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), depression is one of the most common yet
underrecognized and undertreated comorbidities. Although
depression has been associated with reduced adherence to
maintenance medications used in other conditions, such as diabetes,
little research has assessed the role of depression in COPD
medication use and adherence.
Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of
depression on COPD maintenance medication adherence among a
nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries newly
diagnosed with COPD.
Methods: Weused a 5%random sampleofMedicareadministrative
claims data to identify beneficiaries diagnosed with COPD between
2006 and 2010. We included beneficiaries with 2 years of continuous
Medicare Parts A, B, and D coverage and at least two prescription fills
for COPD maintenance medications after COPD diagnosis. We
searched for prescription fills for inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting
b-agonists, and long-acting anticholinergics and calculated
adherence starting at the first fill. We modeled adherence to COPD
maintenance medications as a function of new episodes of
depression, using generalized estimated equations.
Measurements and Main Results: Our primary outcome was
adherence to COPD maintenance medications, measured as
proportion of days covered. The exposure measure was depression.
Both COPD and depression were assessed using diagnostic codes in
Part A and B data. Covariates included sociodemographics, as well as
clinical markers, including comorbidities, COPD severity, and
depression severity. Of 31,033 beneficiaries meeting inclusion
criteria, 6,227 (20%) were diagnosed with depression after COPD
diagnosis. Average monthly adherence to COPD maintenance
medications was low, peaking at 57% in the month after first fill and
decreasing to35%within6months.In ouradjusted regressionmodel,
depression was associated with decreased adherence to COPD
maintenance medications (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval,
0.89–0.98).
Conclusions: New episodes of depression decreased adherence to
maintenance medications used to manage COPD among older
adults. Clinicians who treat older adults with COPD should be
aware of the development of depression, especially during the
first 6 months after COPD diagnosis, and monitor patients’
adherence to prescribed COPD medications to ensure best
clinical outcomes.

 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) is a chronic lower respiratory
disease characterized by obstruction of
airflow. COPD is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the
third leading cause of death in the United
States (1, 2). Although smoking is the most
common risk factor for the development of
COPD in the United States, environmental
exposures and genetics also play a role
(1, 3). In 2010, medical costs of COPD in
the United States were estimated at $36
billion and projected to reach $49 billion by
2020 (4).
Clinicians select pharmacologic
strategies used for the management of COPD
based on COPD severity to reduce symptoms
and prevent COPD exacerbations (1).
Maintenance medications, including inhaled
corticosteroids, long-acting b-agonists, and
long-acting anticholinergics, have been
shown to reduce exacerbations and improve
lung function and health-related quality of
life among patients with moderate to
severe disease (5–7). Nonetheless, use of
and adherence to COPD maintenance
medications remain low, ranging from
29 to 56%, and contribute to increased
hospitalization, health care costs, and
mortality (8–20).
Among patients with COPD,
depression remains one of the most
common, yet least recognized and
undertreated, comorbidities, with a
prevalence of 17–44% (21–27). Depression
has been associated with decreased
adherence to maintenance medications
used in chronic conditions such as diabetes
(28, 29). Few studies have assessed the
association between depression and
adherence to COPD medications, and these
were limited by a cross-sectional study
design (30, 31). The objective of this study
was to assess the impact of depression on
COPD maintenance medication adherence
among a nationally representative sample
of Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed
with COPD. We hypothesize that new
episodes of depression will result in
decreased adherence to COPD
maintenance medications.
Methods
Study Population
We obtained Medicare administrative
claims data from the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic
Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) for a 5%
random sample of Medicare beneficiaries
from 2006 to 2012. We identified
beneficiaries with at least one inpatient
or outpatient claim containing the
International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) for COPD (code 490, 491.x,
492.x, 494.x, or 496), and excluded
beneficiaries with a history of respiratory
cancer, tuberculosis, asbestosis, and
sarcoidosis because their medication use
may differ from that of other individuals
with COPD. These ICD-9-CM codes are
used by the CMS to identify beneficiaries
with COPD and have a positive predictive
value of 73% (32). We required continuous
Medicare Parts A, B, D, and no Part C
coverage for 24 months after initial
diagnosis of COPD (index date) during the
study period to ensure adequate follow-up.
All Medicare beneficiaries who met criteria
for COPD since 1999 have the date of first
diagnosis of COPD reported in the CMS
Master Beneficiary Summary File. We used
this date to exclude beneficiaries whose first
diagnosis of COPD occurred before the
study period (2006–2012). We required
that study participants have at least two
prescription fills of a maintenance
medication during the 24-month follow-up
period.
Exposure
We used ICD-9-CM codes 296.2x, 296.3x,
and 311.xx to define depression. These codes
have been used previously and exclude
bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder,
and dysthymic disorder (33–35). Presence
of depression was defined as at least one
diagnosis code on at least one inpatient
claim or at least two outpatient claims
during the study period. To increase
identification of beneficiaries with
depression, we also accepted evidence of at
least one antidepressant prescription fill in
conjunction with diagnosis of depression
on one outpatient claim. Information on
antidepressant fills was collected from
Part D prescription drug event files.
Depression is a chronic disorder that
occurs as one or more unique episodes and
could be diagnosed at any time during the
study period (36, 37). We were interested in
how new episodes of depression impacted
adherence to COPD maintenance
medications. Therefore, among individuals
with depression episodes both before and
after COPD diagnosis, we defined a new
episode of depression after COPD diagnosis
as one occurring more than 5 months after
the depression episode before COPD
diagnosis.
Outcome
The primary outcome of this study was
adherence to inhaled COPD maintenance
medications. We searched for all inhaled
maintenance medications (inhaled
corticosteroids, long-acting b-agonists,
long-acting anticholinergics) in the Part D
prescription drug events file. We excluded
oral methylxanthines because they can be
used as either acute or maintenance
medications and are limited to severe
COPD (37). We divided follow-up time
after the COPD index date into 30-day
months, and measured adherence using
proportion of days covered (PDC) (number
of daily doses in the prescription/30 d) for
all maintenance medications per month.
The PDC ranges from 0 to 1. The PDC is
a widely used measure of medication
adherence in administrative claims data
(38, 39). Adherence was measured monthly
from the date of the first fill of a COPD
maintenance medication after COPD
diagnosis through the end of the study
period. We created a rolling 3-month
average adherence to reduce variability in
monthly adherence measures. Because
distribution of this variable was highly
skewed, we created adherence categories:
,0.2, >0.2 to ,0.4, >0.4 to ,0.6, >0.6 to
,0.8, and >0.8.
Covariates
Baseline comorbidities at COPD diagnosis
were determined using the CCW 27 flagged
comorbid conditions (40). If the date of first
diagnosis of a chronic condition was before
the date of COPD diagnosis, the patient was
considered to have that chronic condition
at baseline. We controlled for diagnosis of
asthma (ICD-9-CM codes 493.xx on one or
more inpatient claims or two or more
outpatient claims). We summed indicator
variables for chronic conditions including
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias,
atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease,
heart failure, diabetes, ischemic heart
disease, osteoarthritis, stroke, and asthma
to create a comorbidity measure. Our
measure had a range of 0–9 and was
categorized as fewer than two, two or three,
and more than three chronic conditions,
based on its distribution. We created time-
varying comorbidity diagnoses for use in

 our regression model by comparing the first
date of diagnosis with the first day of each
month after diagnosis of COPD.
Depression is one of the CCW 27
flagged comorbid conditions. The CCW
algorithm differs from our definition by
including ICD-9-CM codes 296.5x, 296.6x,
296.89, 298.0, 300.4, and 309.1. We used the
CCW depression algorithm to capture
individuals with a history of depression
before 2006.
To assess severity of depression, we
created a variable comprising a count of
three measures obtained from inpatient and
outpatient claims: the presence of a “4” in
the fifth place of an ICD-9-CM code for
depression, evidence of psychotherapy or
other nonpharmacological treatment, and
psychiatric hospitalization with a primary
diagnosis of depression. This variable had a
range of 0–3 and was dichotomized at 1.
We created a variable indicating any
use of short-acting b-agonists and short-
acting anticholinergics (COPD acute
medications) during the month. We
searched for the presence of any nursing
home claim on any inpatient stay, or health
care common procedure coding system or
place of service codes on a skilled nursing
facility claim during the month to indicate
nursing home stay within the month.
Characteristics suggestive of COPD
severity included supplemental oxygen
use, COPD-related hospitalization
(dichotomized at >1 COPD hospital
days/mo), and monthly COPD-related
emergency department visits (dichotomized
at >1 emergency department visit/mo)
(30, 41, 42). We searched carrier and
durable medical equipment claims for the
following preventive health services use
measures: influenza vaccination, colorectal
cancer screening, prostate cancer screening,
and mammography and Papanicolaou
smears (43). An annual count of preventive
health services use measures (including
mammography or Papanicolaou test) was
created as an indicator of healthy behavior.
This variable had a range of 0–3 and, based
on its distribution, was dichotomized at 1
or more.
We linked our Medicare cohort to
county-level data from the Area Health
Resource File. The Area Health Resource
File contains health resources and
socioeconomic indicators from multiple
sources. We abstracted variables
representing median household income,
percentage of persons aged 25 and older
with four or more years of college,
percentage of persons aged 25 and older
with less than a high school education, and
number of primary care providers per
100,000 population.
Data Analysis
Distributions of variables were examined
overall and by depression status. For
descriptive purposes, we made comparisons
between beneficiaries diagnosed with
depression at any time during the 24-month
follow-up and those who were not, using a
x2 or Student t test as appropriate. We
plotted the average 3-month adherence to
COPD maintenance medications over time.
We used generalized estimating
equations with a multinomial distribution
and a cumulative logit link to model the odds
of being in a higher adherence category
(greater adherence) as a function of our time-
varying depression variable and assumed
a compound symmetry covariance matrix
to estimate the correlations among
measurements within an individual. The
analyses were conducted at the person-
month level. We tested interactions with sex,
age, and low-income subsidy a priori.
Covariates associated with depression or
adherence were considered for inclusion in
our model. Comorbidities, acute inhaler use,
COPD severity variables, our preventive
health measure, and nursing home residence
were allowed to vary with time. Covariates
resulting in a greater than 10% change to the
effect estimate or whose type III P value was
less than 0.001 were included in the final
model. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.
To test the assumption of
proportionality in our multinomial model,
we conducted sensitivity analyses. We
created dichotomous variables representing
3-month average adherence at each decile
between 0 and 1. We used generalized
estimating equations with a binomial
distribution and a logit link to model the
odds of an observation falling into the
higher adherence category and assumed a
compound symmetry covariance matrix
to estimate the correlations among
measurements within an individual. We ran
separate models for each decile. Sensitivity
analyses included all variables from the final
regression model of the main analysis.
This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University
of Maryland, Baltimore (Baltimore, MD),
which waived the requirement for written
informed consent. All analyses were
conducted with SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Because of our large
sample size, a P value less than 0.001 was
considered statistically significant in
bivariate analysis.
Results
There were 129,606 Medicare beneficiaries
diagnosed with COPD between 2006 and
2010. Of these, 80,487 (62%) had 24 months
of continuous coverage of Medicare Parts A,
B, D, and no Part C after COPD diagnosis.
Of these, 31,033 (39%) had at least two fills
of a COPD maintenance medication, and
this group formed our sample population.
The average age was 68.4 (SD, 12.2) years
(Table 1). The study sample was primarily
female (64.8%) and white (83.2%).
During the 24-month follow-up period,
6,227 (20.1%) beneficiaries were diagnosed
with depression (Table 1). Individuals
diagnosed with depression were younger
than those who were not diagnosed with
depression (66.9 [SD, 14.0] yr vs. 68.8 [SD,
11.7] yr; P , 0.001). Depressed beneficiaries
were more likely to be female (74.4 vs.
62.4%; P , 0.001), to have more than three
comorbid conditions (32.6 vs. 22.6%; P ,
0.001), and to have evidence of a nursing
home stay (12.1 vs. 4.8%; P , 0.001).
Beneficiaries with depression had more
severe COPD symptoms in the month of
depression diagnosis as evidenced by higher
rates of oxygen use (9.7 vs. 8.2%; P , 0.001).
Average monthly adherence to COPD
maintenance medications was low, with a
peak of 0.57 in the month after the first fill
and decreasing rapidly before plateauing
at 0.35 by the seventh month (Figure 1).
Individuals with depression had lower
adherence throughout the study period
compared with those without depression.
Only 20% of depressed individuals and 22%
of nondepressed individuals fell into the
highest (.80%) adherence category.

model contained terms for new episode
depression, time, COPD index year, age, sex,

In our adjusted model, a new episode of
depression was associated with decreased
odds of greater adherence to COPD
maintenance medications (OR, 0.93; 95%
CI, 0.89–0.98) (Table 2). Acute inhaler
use (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 2.02–2.15),
supplemental oxygen use (OR, 1.43; 95%
CI, 1.36–1.51), nursing home residence
(OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.11–1.230), and low-
income subsidy (OR, 1.31; 95% CI,
1.27–1.37) were associated with increased
adherence to COPD maintenance
medications. Our assumption of
proportionality was supported.
Discussion
Beneficiaries with evidence of depression were
less likely to adhere to COPD maintenance
medications compared with their
nondepressed peers. Adherence to COPD
maintenance medications falls precipitously
within the first 6 months of use, regardless of
depression status. Our study results highlight
the importance of evaluation and monitoring
of depression, as well as the importance
of regular follow-up and counseling on
medication adherence, to maximize well-
being of individuals with COPD. Although
our study findings suggest that the first
6 months after COPD diagnosis is a critical
time period for medication monitoring, given
the chronic and progressive nature of COPD,
close attention throughout the disease
trajectory may be important.
The association between depression
and decreased adherence to COPD
medications has been previously reported
(31, 41, 42, 44); however, only a single
study quantified the effect (30). Qian
and colleagues analyzed maintenance
medication adherence, using a cross-
sectional study design, among Medicare
beneficiaries with COPD and reported that
individuals with depression were 11% less
likely to have high adherence (30). Our
study overcame the limitations of the cross-
sectional study design by examining the
longitudinal association between depression
and medication adherence, yet reported
results consistent with those of the study by
Qian and colleagues (9% less likely to have
greater adherence).
Comorbid depression in COPD
resulted in decreased adherence, as did the
presence of any other comorbid condition

 (except asthma), suggesting that
multimorbidity decreases adherence,
possibly through complex medication
regimens or patient prioritization of one
comorbid illness over another (45). Our
results suggest that individuals with more
than three chronic conditions are at highest
risk of poor adherence. This effect was
mitigated by increased severity of COPD
symptoms, evidenced by acute inhaler
use, oxygen use, and COPD-related
hospitalizations, and is consistent with a
prior report (30).
Historically, use of and adherence to
COPD maintenance medications has been
suboptimal, with many individuals with
COPD not receiving any maintenance
medications (14, 15, 17). Among
individuals who use COPD medications,
adherence is low, which poses difficulties in
medication management (8–18). In this
study, we found that only 22% of the
sample achieved adherence of at least 80%,
regardless of depression status. Our study
was conducted among beneficiaries with
at least two medication fills over the
24 months after COPD diagnosis,
representing those most likely to adhere
to COPD medications, as they have
documented primary adherence by picking
up their COPD medication prescriptions.
Nonetheless, the observed drop in
adherence after first COPD maintenance
medication fill suggests most individuals
with COPD are not using medications as
prescribed. Although a prior study by Qian
and colleagues reported adherence of at
least 80% in 36% of Medicare beneficiaries
with COPD, it did not assess adherence
among patients newly diagnosed with
COPD and evaluated adherence from first-
filled to last-filled prescription, differences
that could account for our lower adherence
rate (30). Women were less likely to be
adherent to COPD maintenance
medications compared with men, which is
consistent with two prior studies conducted
among individuals with COPD (30, 46).
Other studies have not reported a
significant association between sex and
adherence to COPD medications or
medications generally (11, 20, 44, 47). In
our study, women composed 65% of the
study sample, and 75% of those with
depression; hence, residual confounding by
depression status is possible. Race was
associated with decreased adherence to
COPD medications, which is consistent
with the study by Qian and colleagues

 conducted among Medicare beneficiaries
with COPD (30).
Limitations and Strengths
As with any study, ours has limitations that
should be noted. Our study includes
Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with
depression; however, depression is
underdiagnosed in administrative claims
data (48). This potential misclassification of
exposure would cause our results to be
biased toward the null. In addition, we
likely underestimated the burden of
depression in COPD by excluding
dysthymic disorder and depression found
in bipolar and schizoaffective disorder from
our depression definition. Furthermore,
our adherence measure was based on
prescription fills and does not measure
actual use of inhaled medications. Finally,
we could not control for all confounding or
direct influences of medication adherence.
For example, future work may consider
evaluating the impact of other medications,
such as oral corticosteroids, which can
mimic psychiatric side effects.
As well, this study has notable
strengths. This study is the first to assess
adherence to COPD maintenance
medications among Medicare beneficiaries
newly diagnosed with COPD. In addition,
we used a longitudinal study design to
capture episodes of diagnosed depression,
calculated a rolling monthly adherence
value to reduce variance between monthly
observations, and treated depression and
other covariates as time-varying. Although
our data did not include FEV values, a
common COPD severity measure, the proxy
measures we used for COPD severity
(oxygen use, acute inhaler use,
hospitalizations) have been used in other
studies and correlated with medication
adherence in the expected direction
(30, 41, 42, 49–51).
Conclusions
Our study found that new episodes of
depression have a negative influence on
adherence to maintenance medications used
to manage COPD among older adults.
Clinicians who treat older adults newly
diagnosed with COPD should be aware of
the development of depression, especially
during the first 6 months. As such, clinicians
should consider the need to monitor their
patients with COPD for need for treatment
of depression, as well as use of and
adherence to prescribed COPD
medications. Close management of these
and other aspects of newly diagnosed older
adults with COPD will help to ensure
optimal clinical outcomes. This study
provides foundational work elucidating the
association between depression and
adherence in older adults with COPD.
Future research should consider
prospective, longitudinal studies to
replicate our findings as well as to
further explore the relationship of these
comorbid conditions. n
