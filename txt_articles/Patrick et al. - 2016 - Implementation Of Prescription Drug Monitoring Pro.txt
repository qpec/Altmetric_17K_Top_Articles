Abstract
Over the past two decades the number of opioid pain relievers sold in the United States rose 
dramatically. This rise in sales was accompanied by an increase in opioid-related overdose deaths. 
In response, forty-nine states (all but Missouri) created prescription drug monitoring programs to 
detect high-risk prescribing and patient behaviors. Our objectives were to determine whether the 
implementation or particular characteristics of the programs were effective in reducing opioid-
related overdose deaths. In adjusted analyses we found that a state’s implementation of a program 
was associated with an average reduction of 1.12 opioid-related overdose deaths per 100,000 
population in the year after implementation. Additionally, states whose programs had robust 
characteristics—including monitoring greater numbers of drugs with abuse potential and updating 
their data at least weekly—had greater reductions in deaths, compared to states whose programs 
did not have these characteristics. We estimate that if Missouri adopted a prescription drug 
monitoring program and other states enhanced their programs with robust features, there would be 
more than 600 fewer overdose deaths nationwide in 2016, preventing approximately two deaths 
each day.
The number of prescriptions written for opioid pain relievers has risen across the United 
States.1 In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for opioid pain relievers—more than 
one forevery US adult.2 As the number of prescriptions increased, so did complications from 
the drugs’ use and misuse, including neonatal opioid withdrawal,3–5 treatment facility 
admissions,1 and overdose deaths.1,6

 In 2014, 47,055 people died in the United States from a drug overdose, and 61 percent of 
those deaths were related to opioids.7 Several high-risk behaviors have been associated with 
increased rates of overdose deaths among people who use opioids, including obtaining 
multiple prescriptions for opioid pain relievers from different providers.8 Furthermore, 
recent studies suggest that inappropriate prescribing patterns9 lead to overuse of long-acting 
preparations of the drugs that, in turn, are linked to increased risk of overdose death.10
In an effort to curb high-risk patient and prescriber behaviors, many states have implemented 
prescription drug monitoring programs. These programs collect data from pharmacies on the 
prescribing of controlled substances, review and analyze the data, and report them to 
prescribers. The aim of the programs is to identify high-risk behaviors on the part of patients 
(for example, obtaining a prescription from multiple providers, known as “doctor shopping”) 
and providers (such as prescribing abnormally high doses of the substances) that are 
associated with poor outcomes.8,11,12 The programs can also facilitate referrals to substance 
abuse treatment and inform prevention strategies by providing population-level data on 
opioid use.13 By 2014 forty-nine states had implemented a prescription drug monitoring 
program.14 Only Missouri does not now have a program either planned or implemented.15
Several studies of the programs’ effectiveness found that they improved clinicians’ 
confidence in opioid prescribing, identified and reduced doctor shopping, decreased overall 
opioid prescribing and treatment facility admissions, reduced diversion of opioids (that is, 
the transfer for illegal use or distribution of opioids that were received legally), and 
improved clinicians’ ability to monitor opioid dependency treatment.16 However, studies 
evaluating the programs’ effectiveness at reducing opioid-related overdose deaths are 
limited17 or are several years old, having been conducted before many of the programs were 
implemented.18,19
Furthermore, research evaluating the effectiveness of specific characteristics of prescription 
drug monitoring programs remains limited, despite variability in those characteristics across 
states. For example, states vary in the types of drugs with abuse potential that they monitor. 
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) categorizes drugs by abuse potential using a 
system called Controlled Substance Schedules. The system includes five schedules that 
range from one for substances with no medical purposes and high addiction potential, such 
as heroin (Schedule I), to a schedule for substances that have a medical purpose and low 
addiction potential, such as codeine cough syrup (Schedule V). States vary in the number of 
DEA schedules they monitor, and some states monitor additional substances not included in 
the DEA classification.
Building on the previous literature about prescription drug monitoring programs, we used 
publicly available data from all of the states that implemented a program in the period 1999–
2013 to determine whether implementation or different characteristics of a program were 
associated with decreases in opioid-related overdose deaths.

 Study Data And Methods
STUDY DESIGN
We used an interrupted time-series design to examine the association of both implementation 
and characteristics of prescription drug monitoring programs with the rate of opioid-related 
overdose deaths. Our unit of analysis was the state-year pair. The study design was 
strengthened by the variation across states in the timing of programs’ enactment and 
implementation (that is, when a program began collecting data), and the implementation of 
specific features.
We obtained data from multiple public sources (described below) for the period 1999–2013. 
Our analysis focused on the thirty-five states that implemented programs during the study 
period.
This was a study of aggregate-level deidentified death data. Accordingly, the Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center Institutional Review Board considered it exempt from review.
DATA
To evaluate the effectiveness of state prescription drug monitoring programs, we gathered 
data on the programs’ year of legislative enactment and year of implementation. Data for the 
year of enactment were obtained from LawAtlas,20 a database that contains a historical 
review of laws about the programs. Data on enactment were included to account for changes 
in prescriber or patient behavior that might have occurred after enactment but that would be 
independent of the implementation of a program. Data for the year of implementation were 
obtained from a technical assistance website managed by Brandeis University.21
Data on the characteristics of the programs—namely, how many drug schedules were 
monitored, how frequently the data were updated, and whether or not registration or use of 
the program was mandated—were also obtained from the LawAtlas. These data were 
reported only through 2011.20 For 2012 and 2013, we used data compiled from the National 
Alliance for State Model Drug Laws.22,23
A set of time-varying indicator variables was constructed for each state to capture when a 
prescription drug monitoring program statute passed and when the program was 
implemented. We also tested the interaction of the year a program was implemented with 
time, to determine if the association between opioid-related overdose deaths and 
implementation of a program changed over time. In addition, a set of indicators was created 
to identify program features, including the number of drug schedules monitored, the 
frequency of data updates, and whether or not registration or use was mandatory.
Because social disadvantage, such as unemployment24,25 and limited education,26 may 
affect an individual’s risk of overdose death, our models included variables that captured 
these factors. Annual state unemployment data (not adjusted for season) were obtained from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.27 Educational attainment data (the percentage of a state’s 
population ages twenty-five and older with at least a college degree) wereobtained from the

 decennial census for 200028 and the American Community Survey (ACS) for the period 
2005–13.29
Opioid prescribing rates at the state level have been associated with opioid-related overdose 
deaths.30 However, given that opioid prescribing rates are in the causal pathway between 
those deaths and the implementation of a prescription drug monitoring program, prescribing 
data were not included to avoid overadjustment bias.31 In other words, the mechanism by 
which programs likely reduce opioid-related overdose deaths is through patterns of opioid 
prescribing and use. Therefore, including opioid prescribing rates in our model would have 
biased our estimate of the effect of the programs to the null.
The outcome of interest was the annual rate of opioid-related overdose deaths per 100,000 
population in each state. Data for each state and year of interest were abstracted from the 
Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database of multiple 
causes of death maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).32 As 
was done in previous studies,24,33 we defined opioid-related overdose deaths as deaths in 
which the underlying cause was drug overdose, whether accidental or intentional,34 using 
the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth 
Revision (ICD-10), codes X40–X44, X60–X64, and Y10–Y14, when a code for an opioid 
analgesic (T40.2–T40.4) was also present. This methodology captured all deaths involving 
prescription opioids, including methadone.35
The mechanism by which an individual obtained the opioid (either legally through a licensed 
prescriber or illicitly through diversion) could not be determined. The WONDER database 
suppressed state-level data if there were fewer than ten deaths in a given year. Overall, 3.3 
percent of state-year combinations were suppressed or missing outcome data. We used linear 
imputation and the data from the years before and after the missing observations to account 
for these missing data in our sample, and we conducted our analyses both with and without 
imputed data (see online Technical Appendix Exhibit 1).36 One state (North Dakota) was 
dropped because of its high rate of suppressed data, which left thirty-four states in our 
sample.
ANALYSIS
We examined bivariate and multivariable results for our outcome of interest during our study 
period. In the first phase of our analysis, we sought to determine whether there was an 
association between implementing a prescription drug monitoring program and reductions in 
opioid-related overdose deaths among all states that implemented a program in the study 
period. Linear regression models with state fixed effects were employed to account for 
unmeasured variation at the state level and for specific time-varying state-level factors 
(unemployment and educational attainment rate) that might have an effect on prescription 
opioid use.
Because legislators might react to an increase in deaths by implementing a program, we 
included both the year of legislative enactment and the year of implementation to isolate the 
effect of the latter. We also examined the interaction of program implementation with time to 
capture any modification of that effect. Our data were nested within states and years.

 Therefore, data were treated as a time-series panel with appropriate precision adjustment of 
our estimates.
In the second phase of our analysis, we sought to determine if specific program 
characteristics were associated with greater changes in rates of opioid-related overdose 
deaths, compared to other characteristics. For this analysis, we excluded West Virginia 
because it was an extreme outlier, with an opioid-related overdose death rate nearly twice as 
high as that of the next highest state (Utah), and because it implemented a program early in 
our study period.
We added indicators for specific features of programs designed to broaden a program’s 
scope or improve the quality of its data. The details of our regression analysis can be found 
in the Technical Appendix.36
We then used our regression models to predict rates of opioid-related overdose deaths for 
states that had implemented a program and for those that had not, as well as for states whose 
programs had certain features. For the predicted death rates, the median year in our study 
period (2006) was set to zero, and predicted values for three years before and after 
implementation were generated to ensure adequate time to see trends in our regression 
model.
To ensure that our analyses were robust, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses. We 
conducted analyses with and without West Virginia for the reasons stated above, and with 
and without Florida, given the potential impact of the state’s recent and unique legislation 
designed to close “pill mills” (operations in which a provider prescribes or dispenses 
controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose)37 (for results of these sensitivity 
analyses, see Appendix Exhibit 2).36 Lastly, because some prescription opioid-related deaths 
may also involve opium or heroin, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that included deaths 
attributed to opioids (ICD-10 codes T40.2–T40.4), opium (T40.0), or heroin (T40.1) (for 
results of this sensitivity analysis, see Appendix Exhibit 3).36
All statistical analysis was done using Stata, version 13.1. Geographic information systems 
processing was done using ArcGIS, version 10.3.
LIMITATIONS
Our study had some limitations. First, each source of data had its own potential sources of 
error. For example, opioid-related overdose deaths may be underreported if medical 
examiners do not have a suspicion of opioid use and do not perform toxicology testing. 
However, unless the reporting of opioid-related overdose deaths decreased in each state only 
after the implementation of that state’s prescription drug monitoring program, this should 
not confound our results.
Second, while states generally follow the DEA schedules, this is not universally true. If, for 
example, a state were to combine two DEA schedules, this might have biased our results 
toward the null.

 Third, although we attempted to adjust for important state-level confounders, it is possible 
that we did not include some important time-varying, state-level factors associated with both 
our outcome and the predictor of interest.
Fourth, because prescription drug monitoring programs were not implemented in isolation, 
several other state and federal policy changes might have influenced our results. For 
example, Florida, in partnership with the federal government, was effective in closing pill 
mills, and this action was associated with a decrease in opioid-related overdose deaths.38 
However, the results of a sensitivity analysis in which we excluded Florida did not differ 
from those of our main analysis (Appendix Exhibit 2).36
Lastly, several agencies in the US Department of Health and Human Services have been 
working together to improve access to substance abuse treatment and mitigate the risk of 
deaths related to opioid pain relievers.39 Other innovations, including expanding the use of 
the opioid-reversal agent naloxone for first responders and families40 and abuse-deterrent 
formulations of opioids,41 were not captured in our data. But changes in federal practices or 
innovations in drug development or delivery would likely have affected all states at the same 
time and would likely be independent of our variables that captured program implementation 
or features in specific states and years.
Study Results
By 2013, forty-eight states had created a prescription drug monitoring program, leaving only 
Missouri and New Hampshire42 without a program (Exhibit 1). For additional data on 
growth of the programs by state, see Appendix Exhibit 4.36
Throughout our study period, rates of opioid-related overdose deaths increased across the 
United States, albeit with great variability (see Appendix Exhibit 5).36 For example, 
Nebraska’s opioid-related overdose death rate increased from 0.4 per 100,000 population in 
1999 to 2.3 in 2013, while Maryland’s death rate increased from 0.3 per 100,000 population 
in 1999 to 8.9 in 2913.
In 2013 seven states (Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and 
West Virginia) had opioid-related overdose death rates of at least ten per 100,000 population 
(Exhibit 2). In the same year, seven other states (Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Nebraska, and Texas) had death rates of fewer than three per 100,000 
population.
The average opioid-related overdose death rate for the thirty-four states in our sample rose 
from 1.4 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 6.2 per 100,000 population in 2013 (Exhibit 1). 
States that implemented a prescription drug monitoring program during the study period 
were similar to those that did not in terms of educational attainment and unemployment rates 
in the population. However, by the end of the study period, states that implemented a 
program had a lower opioid-related overdose death rate, compared to those that did not (6.19 
per 100,000 population versus 6.50 per 100,000 population) (Exhibit 1). Data for each year 
in our study period can be found in Appendix Exhibit 6.36

 In multivariable analyses that accounted for state program legislation enactment and 
implementation, educational attainment, unemployment rate, state fixed effects, and a linear 
time trend, we found that the implementation of a program was associated with a decrease of 
1.12 opioid-related overdose deaths per 100,000 population annually after implementation 
(Exhibit 3, model 1).
Programs that monitored four or more drug schedules and updated their data at least weekly 
were associated with greater reductions in opioid-related overdose deaths than programs 
without these characteristics (Exhibit 3, model 2). A state newly implementing a program 
with both of those features was predicted to have 1.55 fewer opioid-related overdose deaths 
per 100,000 population annually than a state without a program. State requirements for 
registration with or use of a program were not common during our study period, and our 
estimates did not show those features as having a significant effect.
Exhibit 4 graphically depicts the predicted death rates for a simulated three-year period after 
the implementation of a prescription drug monitoring program and after the implementation 
of a program with robust characteristics.
Discussion
In this retrospective study of states, we found that the implementation of a prescription drug 
monitoring program was associated with a subsequent decrease in opioid-related overdose 
deaths. In adjusted analyses, states with programs that monitored four or more drug 
schedules and updated data at least weekly were found to have lower opioid-related 
overdose death rates, compared to states whose programs lacked these characteristics.
This study adds to a growing body of evidence that describes the effectiveness of 
prescription drug monitoring programs in reducing adverse events associated with the use 
and misuse of opioid pain relievers. Previous studies found the use of a program to be 
effective in reducing doctor shopping, opioid diversion, and inappropriate prescribing.16 
Some previous research18,19 found little to no association between program implementation 
and deaths related to opioid pain relievers. Our study enhances these analyses by using the 
most recent data available on such deaths and employing state fixed effects to account for 
state-specific differences in the use of opioid pain relievers at baseline.
Interestingly, we found that the interaction of time with program implementation was 
positive and nearly significant (p = 0.06) when West Virginia was included in our analyses 
(Exhibit 3). West Virginia is an extreme outlier in terms of opioid-related overdose deaths, 
having a death rate nearly twice as high as that of the next highest state in 2013. 
Furthermore, West Virginia implemented its program in 2002, early in our study period. It 
appears that the association of program implementation in West Virginia with a decrease in 
opioid-related overdose deaths became attenuated over time (that is, there was a subsequent 
increase in deaths). However, excluding West Virginia from the analyses suggested that 
program implementation in all other states was associated with a reduction of opioid-related 
overdose deaths—an effect that grew slightly over time (Appendix Exhibit 2).36

 We found that prescription drug monitoring programs that reported data for a broader range 
of drug schedules and that were updated with greater frequency were associated with greater 
declines in opioid-related overdose deaths, compared to other programs. Notably, however, 
states vary greatly in program structure, including in the program’s ease of use for 
prescribers, frequency of reporting, interoperability with programs in neighboring states, 
number of drug schedules monitored, and requirements for pharmacies and physicians to 
register with and use the program.20 As the prescription opioid epidemic grew, some states 
implemented more stringent program features to mitigate the epidemic’s growth (Appendix 
Exhibit 7).36
Future research should evaluate additional innovations to prescription drug monitoring 
programs, such as interoperability between states’ programs and requiring prescribers to 
register with and use a program, and it should exploit natural experiments in program 
characteristics to understand the impact of these innovations. For example, though we found 
no effect of requiring providers to register with or use a program, as recently implemented 
by a number of states, some evidence suggests that mandating program use by prescribers 
significantly decreased doctor shopping and the number of prescriptions for opioid pain 
relievers written in specific states.43 These policies should be evaluated as additional years 
of data become available and as more states implement them.
Missouri, a state whose opioid-related overdose death rate grew faster than the national 
average (data not shown), remains the only state without a prescription drug monitoring 
program. States have been moving toward more comprehensive monitoring of drug 
schedules and more frequent updating of data. In 2015, thirty-three states monitored at least 
four drug schedules, and forty-eight states updated program data at least weekly.44,45
Our data suggest that policy makers in the states whose programs do not include these 
features could consider increasing their frequency of updating and monitoring all schedules 
of drugs that have a medical use and abuse potential as a strategy for reducing opioid-related 
overdose deaths. We estimate that if these remaining states did so and Missouri implemented 
an equally robust monitoring program, over 600 deaths would be avoided in 2016.46
Conclusion
In 2011 the Executive Office of the President of the United States12 set forth the goal of 
establishing a prescription drug monitoring program in every state and improving interstate 
interoperability of the programs. Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
Prevention for States program, which has made large-scale grants to sixteen states to 
enhance existing programs, set forth the goal of making data from the programs more 
timely47—a key characteristic we found to be associated with enhanced effectiveness. While 
these goals have gained widespread support, funding for the programs is frequently 
inconsistent and at risk, which jeopardizes their ability to remain operational.48–50
Our findings provide support for bolstering prescription drug monitoring programs and 
establishing a consistent and predictable funding source for them. Additional funding could 
be provided to increase the number of drug schedules monitored by the programs and the

 frequency of data updating—both features associated in our study with a reduction in 
opioid-related overdose deaths. It also may be valuable to tailor programs for easy use by 
physicians, who often find the programs’ data difficult to access,51 and to streamline 
interoperability between states.52
It is also important to note that prescription drug monitoring programs are just one tool that 
could limit the complications of overuse of opioid pain relievers. A comprehensive approach 
to the prescription drug abuse epidemic is needed, including improving education of 
providers and the public and improving and augmenting the ability of law enforcement 
officials to target illegal activities such as operating pill mills.12
That said, implementation of a prescription drug monitoring program with advanced features 
was strongly associated with a reduction in opioid-related overdose deaths. Research is 
needed to determine the importance of other improvements to program operations, such as 
increasing rates of registration, requiring all providers to use the programs, and increasing 
the identification and investigation of high-risk providers and patients. As the use of these 
programs becomes more common and consistent, their effect on decreasing the prescription 
opioid epidemic is likely to grow.

reducing accidental deaths than in reducing intentional deaths, we chose to include both accidental 
and intentional deaths because program implementation may also affect the availability of opioids

SOURCE Authors’ analysis of data from the sources listed in Exhibit 1. NOTES The explanatory variables, as well as the PDMP legislation enactment, are per year of implementation. State fixed effects 
were used for all models. Model 1 includes data for all states that implemented a PDMP during our study period. Model 2 excludes West Virginia. For each bivariate and multivariable regression, the 
outcome of interest is the opioid-related overdose death rate per 100,000 population. For example, model 1 shows that PDMP implementation was associated with a reduction of 1.2 opioid-related overdose 
deaths per 100,000 population per year. “Educational attainment” is the percentage of the population ages twenty-five and older with at least a college degree. CI is confidence interval.
