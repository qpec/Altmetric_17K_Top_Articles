appointments in healthcare: a national
retrospective data linkage study

Abstract
Background: Recently, studies have examined the underlying patient and practice factors for missed appointments,
but less is known about the impact on patient health. People with one or more long-term conditions who fail to
attend appointments may be at risk of premature death. This is the first study to examine the effect of missed primary
healthcare appointments on all-cause mortality in those with long-term mental and physical health conditions.
Methods: We used a large, nationwide retrospective cohort (n = 824,374) extracted from routinely collected general
practice data across Scotland over a 3-year period from September 2013 until September 2016. This data encompasses
appointment history for approximately 15% of the Scottish population, and was linked to Scottish deaths records for
patients who had died within a 16-month follow-up period. We generated appointment attendance history, number
of long-term conditions and prescriptions data for patients. These factors were used in negative binomial and Cox’s
proportional hazards modelling to examine the risk of missing appointments and all-cause mortality.
Results: Patients with a greater number of long-term conditions had an increased risk of missing general practice
appointments despite controlling for number of appointments made, particularly among patients with mental health
conditions. These patients were at significantly greater risk of all-cause mortality, and showed a dose-based response
with increasing number of missed appointments. Patients with long-term mental health conditions who missed more
than two appointments per year had a greater than 8-fold increase in risk of all-cause mortality compared with those
who missed no appointments. These patients died prematurely, commonly from non-natural external factors such as
suicide.
Conclusions: Missed appointments represent a significant risk marker for all-cause mortality, particularly in patients
with mental health conditions. For these patients, existing primary healthcare appointment systems are ineffective.
Future interventions should be developed with a particular focus on increasing attendance by these patients.

Background
Healthcare systems should manage and treat chronic,
long-term conditions (LTCs) effectively. However, while
traditional models of care focus on the treatment of indi-
vidual conditions, multimorbidity – the presence of two
or more LTCs [1] – is increasing in prevalence [2, 3].
Greater numbers of LTCs are associated with deprivation
[4], older age [5], high mortality [6] and depression [7].
High levels of multimorbidity are also correlated with in-
creased treatment burden [8], and repeated attendance at
primary healthcare appointments is required to avoid ad-
verse outcomes in conditions such as diabetes [9]. We re-
cently described an association between demographic risk
factors and a pattern of repeated missed primary care ap-
pointments [10], which raises the question of whether re-
peatedly missed appointments are associated with greater
numbers of LTCs, potentially further increasing the overall
burden of disease as well as socioeconomic health

 inequalities. Missed appointments may thus represent one
aspect of unmet health needs, yet there has been no prior
published research in this area.
Herein, we used a large Scottish primary healthcare
appointment dataset to quantify the association between
number of LTCs contributing to multimorbidity – both
physical and mental health related – and the risk of
missing general practice appointments. We also used
data linkage with the Scottish death registry to quantify
the risk of all-cause mortality and describe the causes of
death in patients who miss multiple appointments,
allowing, for the first time, a quantitative examination of
the association of missed appointment patterns (as a
proxy for unmet medical need) with adverse outcomes.
Methods
Study design
National Health Service (NHS) general practices provide
healthcare for most of the UK population. Patients are
registered at a single practice, and are able to schedule
appointments at their own discretion. Because practices
generally control access into treatment services in the
UK health system and hold data on almost all health ser-
vice encounters, they allow the examination of the asso-
ciation between appointment attendance patterns and
LTCs.
Routinely collected NHS data from general practices
across Scotland between September 5, 2013, and Sep-
tember 5, 2016, were extracted with agreement from
participating practices. Recruitment methods and the
characteristics of the practices are described in a previ-
ous protocol paper [11]. Overall, 136 practices from 11
Scottish health boards took part, resulting in a cohort of
11,490,537 separate appointments from 824,374 patients.
Letters of comfort were issued by the West of Scotland
NHS Ethics Committee and the University of Glasgow
College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences Ethics
Committee, confirming that the full study did not need
NHS ethics permission. Public Benefit and Privacy Panel
approval was granted by NHS Information Services
Scotland in December 2016. Data were aggregated where
necessary to ensure individual patient privacy.
Due to the sensitive nature of NHS administrative
data, the datasets generated or analysed during the
present study will not be made publicly available. Data
have been made available only to the research team
under controlled access and strictly for the purposes of
this research study. These data were stored in an NHS
Safe Haven – a platform allowing researchers to analyse
confidential patient data securely. Summary data, at the
level of disclosure-checked output from the National
Safe Haven, and coding can be obtained from the corre-
sponding author on reasonable request. Categories of
variables used in this paper are given in Additional file 1.
Outcomes
Our primary analysis assessed whether patients with
higher numbers of LTCs missed more general practice
appointments. A secondary analysis considered whether
patients who missed multiple appointments were at a
higher risk of all-cause mortality.
Data analysis
Patient and practice level data used in this study were pre-
pared as described previously [10]. Briefly, patients were
categorised into attendance categories averaged over the
3-year study period from September 5, 2013, until Sep-
tember 5, 2016, as follows: zero missed appointments
(zero group); low number of missed appointments, < 1 per
year (low group); medium number of missed appoint-
ments, 1–2 per year (medium group); and high number of
missed appointments, > 2 per year (high group).
LTC data were derived from patients’ primary care
Read codes and included both priority 1 and priority 3
codes [12]. LTC counts were calculated using the 43
LTCs as described by Barnett et al. [4], with refinement
of codes included in addiction/mental health categories.
These represent the LTCs with prevalence above 0.1% in
the UK population. Prescription data were used when
available to allocate LTCs to a patient if Read codes were
not adequately recorded [4]. LTCs were further cate-
gorised as related to mental or physical health, using the
approach adopted by Barnett et al. [4].
We used a negative binomial model to examine risk of
missing appointments, controlling for both patient-based
factors – age, sex, socioeconomic status and distance –
and practice level factors, including average interval be-
tween booking and appointment (appointment delay),
average appointment time per patient, average total num-
ber of appointments offered to each patient over 3 years,
practice rurality and mean practice socioeconomic status.
This model controlled for number of appointments made
by including it as an offset.
Similarly, we used Cox’s proportional hazards control-
ling for these factors to examine all-cause mortality as
an outcome. All-cause premature mortality was evalu-
ated by linking patient community health index numbers
– a unique identifier for each patient – from our initial
dataset to Scottish death records databases using the
follow-up period between September 6, 2016, and De-
cember 31, 2017. These identifiable community health
index numbers were then anonymised by Albasoft, an
NHS trusted third party used for data extraction on this
project, before upload to the Safe Haven.
Results
Patient demographic factors
Using our retrospective cohort of general practice data
across Scotland, we established a dataset containing
McQueenie et al. BMC Medicine            (2019) 17:2 
Page 2 of 9
 11,490,537 separate consultations (n = 824,374 patients)
for analysis. Table 1 reports patient demographic factors
for none, one to three, and four or more LTCs. Overall,
59.0% of participants had one or more LTCs, with 13.3%
reporting four or more. However, only 7.0% of those in
the ‘zero’ group had four or more LTCs, whilst in the
‘high’ group, 40.1% of participants had four or more.
Furthermore, high levels of LTCs were associated with
deprivation, wherein 64.3% of those in the most deprived
quantile had one or more LTC, compared to 51.1% of
those in the most affluent quantile.
LTCs and risk of missing appointments
We next examined the relationship between risk of
missing appointments and number of LTCs. Relative
risks of missing appointments based on LTC groups are
shown in Fig. 1a. Compared with the reference group of
patients with LTC scores of zero (relative risk ratio
(RRR) 1.00) in this model, patients with one to three
LTCs were approximately 30% more at risk of missing
appointments (RRR 1.29, 95% CI 1.28–1.31) and patients
with four or more LTCs were 70% more at risk of miss-
ing appointments (RRR 1.70, 95% CI 1.68–1.72). All
models are proportioned to the total number of appoint-
ments made per patient, ensuring that any increase in
the total number of appointments made does not ac-
count for an increased risk of missing appointments.
To examine whether patients who have multiple ap-
pointments in a short timeframe are likely to miss ap-
pointments, we studied whether patients who missed an
appointment had another within 30 days of that appoint-
ment (Additional file 2). Surprisingly, patients in the
‘high’ group had a lower number of appointments within
30 days of a missed appointment (5.7%) than the ‘low’
group (21.6%).
Physical and mental health-reated LTCs
To provide further information on the type of LTC that
increases the risk of missing appointments, we cate-
gorised LTCs into physical or mental health-related
LTCs and examined the RRR for missed appointments
for these types of LTCs alone. Physical health LTCs
(Fig. 1b) were associated with a modest increased risk of
missing appointments, with patients with one to three
physical morbidities being 16% more likely to miss ap-
pointments (RRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.15–1.17) and those with
four or more being approximately 38% more at risk of
missing appointments (RRR 1.38, 95% CI 1.37–1.41).
Mental health-related LTCs (Fig. 1c) represented a
greater risk of missed appointments, with those with one
to three mental morbidities being 30% more at risk of
missing appointments (RRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.29–31), and
those with four or more mental LTCs representing a
greater than 2-fold adjusted increase in likelihood of
missed appointments (RRR 2.05, 95% CI 1.95–2.16).
Next, we examined subtypes of mental health-related
LTCs and their contribution towards missed appoint-
ments (Additional file 3). Both problem alcohol (22.2%)
and psychoactive substance misuse (27.4%) contained a
high proportion of patients who missed two or more ap-
pointments per year. Other mental health-related LTCs
(depression, anxiety, dementia, schizophrenia and an-
orexia bulimia) appeared to have a smaller proportion of
patients in the ‘high’ group, with only 14.1% missing two
or more appointments per year. Patients with both
alcohol misuse and other mental health-related LTCs
showed a modest increase in proportion of patients in
the ‘high’ group (25.4%), with a similar increase reported
for those with both psychoactive substance misuse and
other mental health-related LTCs (30.0%). The propor-
tion of patients in the ‘high’ group appeared to be great-
est in patients who suffered from both problem alcohol
and psychoactive substance misuse (32.1%).
All-cause mortality in missed appointments
Using data linkage, we examined all-cause mortality in
missed appointment groups. Figure 2 shows a cumula-
tive incidence Kaplan–Meier plot containing proportions
of deaths in the ‘zero’
, ‘low’
, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ groups,
highlighting a clear trend toward an increased propor-
tion of deaths in the ‘low’
, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ groups
compared with the ‘zero’ group. To further quantify the
association, we performed Cox’s proportional hazards
analysis to find the risk of all-cause mortality in each of
the missed appointment groups using zero missed ap-
pointments as a reference (Fig. 3). This analysis con-
trolled for number of LTCs, age, sex, socioeconomic
status, distance to practice and practice-based factors
(average appointment delay, average appointment dur-
ation, average appointments offered to each patient over
3 years, rurality and mean practice socioeconomic sta-
tus). There was a dose-related increased risk of all mor-
tality outcomes, with a greater than 50% increase in the
‘low’ group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.55, 95% CI 1.47–1.63),
an over 2-fold increase in the ‘medium’ group (HR 2.17,
95% CI 2.04–2.30), and an approximately 3-fold increase
in the ‘high’ group (HR 3.11, 95% CI 2.94–3.30).
To interpret the differing effects of physical and men-
tal health on all-cause mortality, we examined all-cause
mortality outcomes on groups of patients who had only
physical health-related LTCs and those who had only
mental health-related LTCs (Fig. 4a). This showed a
dose-related
effect
for
any
physical
or
mental
health-related LTC, with a stepwise increase in all-cause
mortality for the ‘low’ (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.47–1.63),
‘medium’ (HR 2.04, 95% CI 2.17–2.30) and ‘high’ (HR
3.11,

 physical health-related LTCs (Fig. 4b) showed similar
patterns (low: HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.61–1.70; medium: HR
2.31, 95% CI 2.18–2.44; high: HR 3.36, 95% CI 3.17–
3.56), likely due to the increased predominance of phys-
ical over mental health-related LTCs. The effects were
more
pronounced
for
mental
health-related
LTCs
(Fig. 4c), with the ‘low’ group showing greater than
double all-cause mortality (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.99–2.21),
the ‘medium’ group showing an over 4-fold increase (HR
4.02, 95% CI 3.79–4.25), and the ‘high’ group showing an
over 8-fold increase (HR 8.37, 95% CI 7.91–8.87). This
effect was less marked in patients with both mental and
physical health-related LTCs (Fig. 4d), wherein the ‘low’
group showed an approximately 80% increased risk of
all-cause mortality (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.64–1.92), the
‘medium’ group showed an over 2.5-fold increase (HR
2.78, 95% CI 2.56–3.02) and the ‘high’ group showed an
over 4-fold increase (HR 4.40, 95% CI 4.02–4.77).
Causes and age at death in LTC groups
After examining the differential effect of physical or
mental health-related LTCs and missed appointments on
all-cause mortality, we next examined mean age at death
and the most common primary causes of death in pa-
tients with no, mental only, physical only, or both men-
tal and physical health-related LTCs (Table 2). The
lowest mean age at death (49.3 years old) was in the
‘high’ group of patients with mental health-related LTCs
alone. Conversely, patients in the ‘high’ group with phys-
ical health LTCs alone were, on average, approximately
80 years old at the time of death. Whilst patients experi-
encing either physical alone or physical and mental
health-related LTCs lived to between 75 and 79 years
old on average, those who died in the follow-up period
with mental but no physical health-related LTCs lived to
between 49 and 68 years old on average. The most com-
mon primary causes of death differed between groups,

 wherein those for patients with physical health-related
LTCs alone were lung malignancy and ischaemic heart
disease, and patients with both physical and mental
health-related LTCs most commonly died with dementia
or ischemic heart disease. In contrast, patients with men-
tal health-related LTCs alone frequently had primary
causes of death recorded as intentional self-harm by hang-
ing, strangulation and suffocation, poisoning/overdoses,
or an ill-defined or unknown cause of mortality (R99).
Notably, patients with mental health-related LTCs alone
are the only group that had the primary cause of death
listed within the ‘external causes’ classification of ICD-10
codes in a very substantial proportion of cases [13].
Discussion
We have described a strong association between the bur-
den of multimorbidity and the likelihood of missing pri-
mary care appointments in a large, broadly representative
sample of Scottish general practices. In the group of pa-
tients missing two or more appointments per year, almost
half (46%) had one or more LTCs, while 17% had four or
more. Furthermore, patients with four or more LTCs were
more than twice as likely to miss appointments as those
with none, even after controlling for multiple patient and
practice factors. Those least likely to attend were patients
with mental health-related LTCs.
Repeated missed appointments were also associated with
substantially increased premature all-cause mortality rates,
particularly amongst those with mental health-related
LTCs. Among patients with physical health-related LTCs
alone, those missing two or more appointments per year
had a 3-fold increase in all-cause mortality compared to
those who missed no appointments. For those with only
mental health-related LTCs, the corresponding increase
was more than 8-fold. A significant proportion of patients
with alcohol or substance misuse appeared to serially miss
appointments, with approximately one-quarter of each fail-
ing to attend two or more appointments per year, and ap-
proximately one-third of those with both failing to attend
two or more appointments per year.
Unsurprisingly, among those with no recorded physical
health LTCs, deaths occurred, on average, at younger ages
than among those with physical health LTCs, but the age
at death was lower with each escalating category of fre-
quency of missed appointments; deceased patients with
only mental health-related LTCs who missed two or more
appointments per year died on average at age 49.
There are some limitations to this study. We were un-
able to establish the cause of each missed appointment
directly. Some missed appointments, for example, may
have resulted from patients being too sick to leave home.
Nevertheless, missing multiple appointments still pro-
vides a risk marker of all-cause mortality even after con-
trolling for a variety of other factors. While some
conditions, such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease,
could also cause patients to forget appointments, these
specific diagnoses only accounted for a small number of
patients in our sample (n = 8927, 3.7%). In comparison,
approximately 70% of patients with any combination of
mental health multimorbidities suffered from depression,
and almost half (49.2%) suffered from anxiety. Finally,
there may be a proportion of patients who left Scotland
and/or died during the follow-up period, which we are
unable to account for.
Despite these limitations, we have established that a pat-
tern of repeatedly missing appointments is a potentially
valuable clinical marker for increased risk of premature
mortality, particularly among those with mental health
problems. It is unlikely that the relationship between
missed appointments and mortality is directly causal in
most cases, particularly among those without pre-existing
physical health LTCs. One possible mechanism involves
conditions associated with cognitive difficulties such as de-
mentia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or problem
drug or alcohol use, each of which is associated with an in-
creased risk of missing appointments and with increased
mortality [14–20]. The latter two conditions are likely to
underlie a substantial proportion of the premature deaths
from external causes among patients with mental health-
related LTCs who missed appointments frequently. Never-
theless, it remains possible that missed appointments
among those with physical LTCs do contribute to the ob-
served increased mortality [9].
Conclusions
The main clinical implication of these findings is that gen-
eral practices, the acute sector and other NHS services that
support patients should consider how best to facilitate en-
gagement of patients with patterns of repeatedly missing
appointments. Our previous work suggested an association
between rates of non-attendance and an increasing time
gap from appointment booking to appointment date [10].
Therefore, there is a case for conducting exploratory stud-
ies similar to small-scale research interventions performed
in mental health services involving a system of on-the-day
appointments [21] for selected patients.
