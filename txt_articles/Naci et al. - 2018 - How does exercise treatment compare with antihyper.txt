Objective To compare the effect of exercise regimens 
and medications on systolic blood pressure (SBP).
Data sources Medline (via PubMed) and the Cochrane 
Library.
Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACE-I), angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs), 
β-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and 
diuretics were identified from existing Cochrane 
reviews. A previously published meta-analysis of 
exercise interventions was updated to identify 
recent RCTs that tested the SBP-lowering effects of 
endurance, dynamic resistance, isometric resistance, 
and combined endurance and resistance exercise 
interventions (up to September 2018).
Design Random-effects network meta-analysis.
Outcome Difference in mean change from baseline SBP 
between comparator treatments (change from baseline 
in one group minus that in the other group) and its 95% 
credible interval (95% CrI), measured in mmHg.
Results We included a total of 391 RCTs, 197 of which 
evaluated exercise interventions (10 461 participants) 
and 194 evaluated antihypertensive medications (29 281 
participants). No RCTs compared directly exercise 
against medications. While all medication trials included 
hypertensive populations, only 56 exercise trials included 
hypertensive participants (≥140 mmHg), corresponding 
to 3508 individuals. In a 10% random sample, risk of 
bias was higher in exercise RCTs, primarily due to lack 
of blinding and incomplete outcome data. In analyses 
that combined all populations, antihypertensive 
medications achieved higher reductions in baseline SBP 
compared with exercise interventions (mean difference 
−3.96 mmHg, 95% CrI −5.02 to −2.91). Compared 
with control, all types of exercise (including combination 
of endurance and resistance) and all classes of 
antihypertensive medications were effective in lowering 
baseline SBP. Among hypertensive populations, there 
were no detectable differences in the SBP-lowering 
effects of ACE-I, ARB, β-blocker and diuretic medications 
when compared with endurance or dynamic resistance 
exercise. There was no detectable inconsistency between 
direct and indirect comparisons. Although there was 
evidence of small-study effects, this affected both 
medication and exercise trials.
Conclusions The effect of exercise interventions on SBP 
remains under-studied, especially among hypertensive 
populations. Our findings confirm modest but consistent 
reductions in SBP in many studied exercise interventions 
across all populations but individuals receiving 
medications generally achieved greater reductions than 
those following structured exercise regimens. Assuming 
equally reliable estimates, the SBP-lowering effect of 
exercise among hypertensive populations appears similar 
to that of commonly used antihypertensive medications. 
Generalisability of these findings to real-world clinical 
settings should be further evaluated.
InTRODuCTIOn
High systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a major 
modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease.1 
Individuals with high SBP are at elevated risk of 
cardiovascular disease and death2–4 and high SBP 
is the leading cause of death and disability around 
the world.5 Over the past half century, several 
classes of pharmacological treatment options have 
received approval to be prescribed for blood pres-
sure-lowering.6 The mortality and morbidity bene-
fits of these antihypertensive medication options 
have been extensively documented in randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses.7 8 
As the burden of cardiovascular disease continues 
to rise,9 the use of medications targeting high blood 
pressure is sharply increasing.10 In England, the 
number of adults taking blood pressure-lowering 
medications increased by approximately 50% 
What is already known?
 
► Exercise interventions are effective in lowering 
systolic blood pressure.
What are the new findings?
 
► Across all populations, individuals who receive 
antihypertensive medications tend to achieve 
greater reductions in systolic blood pressure 
than those who adopt structured exercise 
regimens.
 
► In populations with hypertension, different 
types of exercise interventions appear to be 
as equally effective as most antihypertensive 
medications.
 
► Structured exercise has not been evaluated as 
extensively as antihypertensive medications.

Review
from 2006 to 2016.11 This upward trend will likely increase, as 
recent changes to major clinical practice guidelines developed 
by prominent organisations such as the American Heart Asso-
ciation (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
have lowered the SBP threshold for the definition of hyperten-
sion.12 These changes are expected to increase the number of 
people labelled as having hypertension and treated with medi-
cations.13 14
Such an increase may lead to inadvertent adverse events at the 
population level, as the number of people taking multiple medi-
cations continues to rise15; polypharmacy represents a major risk 
factor for drug-related morbidity and mortality.16 Prescription 
drugs also contribute to rising healthcare expenditures. Spending 
on medications accounts for about 18% of total health spending 
on average across European countries.17 Recent increases in 
medication-related costs have prompted significant policy and 
clinical attention to the comparative effectiveness of new and 
existing medications.18 Meanwhile, relatively little attention has 
been given to promoting the wider adoption of non-pharmaco-
logical interventions such as exercise.
Exercise interventions have indisputable benefits for cardio-
vascular disease and beyond.19 20 According to a pooled analysis 
of observational cohort studies, men and women with high levels 
of leisure time physical activity had a 24% and 27% lower risk of 
cardiovascular disease, respectively, than men and women with 
low levels of physical activity.21 In addition, previous meta-anal-
yses of RCTs showed that exercise is effective in improving 
established cardiovascular risk factors: exercise interventions 
reduce waist circumference,22 improve glycated haemoglobin 
(HbA1c),23 lower serum triglycerides24 and increase high-den-
sity lipoprotein.25
Exercise also has well-documented benefits in lowering SBP
.26 
In a previous meta-analysis of 93 RCTs conducted among 5223 
healthy adults, SBP was reduced after endurance, dynamic resis-
tance and isometric resistance exercise regimens.27 Although 
recent AHA/ACC guidelines emphasise the role of lifestyle inter-
ventions, including exercise, in the management and treatment of 
hypertension, they consider pharmacological and non-pharma-
cological interventions in isolation.12 It would be very important 
to evaluate the comparative SBP-lowering effects of exercise and 
medication interventions.
In a previous meta-epidemiological study, we evaluated the 
comparative effectiveness of pharmacological and non-phar-
macological interventions on mortality.28 We found structured 
exercise interventions to be as equally effective as several 
frequently used medications in terms of their mortality benefits 
in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, rehabil-
itation after stroke, treatment of heart failure and prevention 
of diabetes. However, the amount of evidence on the mortality 
benefits of exercise was considerably smaller than that on medi-
cations. In addition, there was a paucity of available information 
on the ‘formulation’ and ‘dose’ of different types of exercise 
interventions, and also on the characteristics of people that 
stood to benefit from such interventions.
In this study, we set out to perform a network meta-analysis 
to compare systematically the SBP-lowering effects of exercise 
and medications. Our objective was to evaluate how different 
types and intensities of exercise fared against different classes 
and doses of antihypertensive medications in terms of lowering 
baseline SBP levels. In addition, we assessed the comparative 
SBP-lowering effects of exercise and medications specifically 
among hypertensive populations.
METhODs
Identification of available evidence
As previously,28 we identified the relevant body of evidence 
in three steps. First, one researcher (HN) searched Medline 
via PubMed for the most recently published comprehensive 
meta-analyses of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of exercise 
interventions on lowering SBP (see search strategy in online 
supplementary appendix 1).
Second, one researcher (HN up to August 2017 and MSK 
from August 2017 to September 2018) searched Medline via 
PubMed to identify recently published RCTs of exercise inter-
ventions aimed at lowering SBP that were published after the 
end date of electronic database search in the meta-analyses iden-
tified in step one (see search strategy in online supplementary 
appendix 2). Accordingly, our search covered the period from 
February 2012 to September 2018. T
wo researchers (SAS and 
HN, up to August 2017) and one researcher (MSK, from August 
2017 to September 2018) screened identified titles and abstracts 
according to prespecified eligibility criteria. Participants of 
interest included adults (with or without hypertension) with no 
cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes or other 
chronic conditions such as cancer. Eligible interventions were any 
form of structured exercise of any frequency, duration or inten-
sity. Eligible comparator interventions included usual practice 
(no exercise), other exercise regimens, or medications. Studies 
were included if they lasted at least 4 
weeks and reported SBP at 
baseline and follow-up (or change from baseline) for interven-
tion and comparator arms or the difference in means between 
the two arms. One researcher (MB) contacted the corresponding 
authors of recently published RCTs to obtain missing outcome 
data in the papers. Following title and abstract screening, three 
researchers (MB, MSK and HN) reviewed potentially relevant 
full text articles to determine study eligibility. Disagreements 
were resolved by consensus.
Third, one researcher (MSK) searched the Cochrane Library to 
identify published meta-analyses of RCTs of prescription medi-
cations aimed at lowering SBP with similar participant popula-
tions to those in the meta-analyses of exercise trials (ie, adults in 
whom the blood pressure lowering effect of an intervention can 
be observed, excluding individuals with other conditions poten-
tially causing hypertension, such as renal failure). Comparators 
in eligible medication trials included placebo, other medications, 
doses, or usual care. The list of relevant medication classes was 
identified using the clinical practice guidelines developed by 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)29 
and the European Society of Hypertension/European Society 
of Cardiology (ESH/ESC).30 We also used the British National 
Formulary (BNF) to determine the eligible doses of individual 
antihypertensive medications.31 Only trial arms of RCTs of 
medications from guideline-recommended medication classes 
and BNF-approved doses were eligible for inclusion in our 
review. We did not run additional searches to update the list of 
medication RCTs included in previous meta-analyses, since they 
were deemed to be sufficiently up-to-date and, in contrast to 
exercise trials, the amount of evidence for medication trials was 
already very large.
Data extraction
We adopted a two-tiered data extraction strategy. For eligible 
RCTs of medications, we relied on the information reported in 
the published Cochrane meta-analyses. We divided the sample of 
RCTs and two researchers (MSK and MB) extracted information 
on author name, trial reference, publication year, interventions

Review
(including dose), comparators, sample size (total number of 
randomly assigned participants or total number of participants 
with outcome measurement) per trial arm, and outcome data.
For eligible RCTs of exercise interventions, we carried out 
primary data collection from each publication. In addition to 
the data items captured from medication RCTs, we collected 
detailed information on the characteristics of participants (eg, 
mean age, proportion female) and interventions (type, intensity, 
frequency, duration). In terms of outcome data, we focused on 
SBP
, as it has been consistently associated with cardiovascular 
risk in epidemiological and experimental studies.12 SBP is also 
more commonly reported than diastolic blood pressure.27 We 
set out to extract the mean change from baseline SBP levels and 
its standard deviation (SD) in each trial arm. When the mean 
change from baseline was not available, we obtained the mean 
and SD of SBP levels at baseline and follow-up in each arm and 
thus calculated the mean change from baseline for each study.
Data on the SD of change from baseline SBP were rarely avail-
able. We therefore relied on standard errors, 95% confidence 
intervals, P values or t statistics to calculate SD, as recommended 
by the Cochrane Handbook.32 When no information was avail-
able to calculate SD, we imputed missing values by using a 
correlation coefficient of 0.8 between baseline and follow-up 
SBP
. We tested the sensitivity of our findings to different correla-
tion coefficients and confirmed the consistency of results across 
different sets of analyses (see online supplementary appendix 
4). T
wo researchers extracted outcome data (SAS and MB up to 
August 2017, and HN and MSK from August 2017 to September 
2018) and another researcher independently appraised the accu-
racy of the information.
Categorisation of available evidence
Exercise was defined as a subset of physical activity that is struc-
tured and repetitive with the objective of improving or main-
taining physical fitness.33 We divided exercise interventions into 
four major categories: (1) endurance, (2) dynamic resistance, (3) 
isometric resistance, and (4) a combination of endurance and 
dynamic resistance.27 Endurance exercise included interventions 
aimed at increasing heart rate and energy expenditure. Exam-
ples of endurance exercise included walking, jogging, running, 
cycling and swimming. Interval training was considered as 
endurance exercise. We labelled exercise interventions as resis-
tance training if they were aimed at increasing muscular strength 
and power. Strength training with dumbbells was a typical form 
of resistance exercise. We categorised exercise interventions as 
isometric exercise if they involved sustained contraction against 
an immovable load.
Intensity of exercise interventions was categorised into low, 
moderate and high using the classification developed by the 
American College of Sports Medicine.34 The majority of exer-
cise RCTs reported relevant information such as percent of heart 
rate reserve (% HRR), percent of maximal heart rate (% HRmax), 
percent of maximal oxygen uptake (% VO2 max), or percent of 
one repetition maximum (% 1RM) to categorise the relative or 
absolute intensity of exercise interventions. In cases where such 
information was not available, we relied on the study authors’ 
reporting to determine the intensity of physical activity.
Individual medications were categorised into the following 
antihypertensive medication classes: angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin-2 receptor blockers 
(ARBs), β-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and 
diuretics. Medications were also divided into low and high doses 
according to the BNF, assigning them to ‘low’ if at or below the 
mid-point of recommended doses in the BNF and ‘high’ if above 
the mid-point of recommended doses.
We categorised exercise trials according to the study-level 
mean baseline SBP of the participant population. While the 
RCTs of antihypertensive medications included only hyperten-
sive participants (with baseline SBP ≥140 
mmHg), exercise trials 
had more variable inclusion criteria. In our primary analysis, 
participant populations were labelled as ‘hypertensive’ if exer-
cise trials included adults with mean baseline SBP of at least 
140 
mmHg, which was consistent with the original definition of 
hypertension until the changes introduced by the 2017 AHA/
ACC guidelines.
We also considered additional cut-offs to define hypertension 
in two sensitivity analyses. In the first set of sensitivity analyses, 
we labelled populations in exercise RCTs as hypertensive if they 
had an average SBP of at least 130 
mmHg, which corresponds 
to the new blood pressure threshold to define hypertension in 
the 2017 AHA/ACC guidelines.12 In the second set of sensitivity 
analyses, we tested a cut-off of 150 
mmHg for mean SBP in exer-
cise trials, as this more closely matched the mean SBP of the trial 
populations in medication trials.
Risk of bias assessment
We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to evaluate the internal 
validity of results in a 10% random sample of medication (n=20) 
and exercise RCTs (n=20) (online supplementary appendix 
5).35 T
wo researchers (HN and MB) reviewed the publica-
tions of selected trials to determine whether the investigators 
used appropriate methods to (1) generate a random allocation 
sequence (selection bias), (2) conceal the sequence of treatment 
allocation from trial investigators and participants before the 
trial (selection bias), (3) mask participants and investigators from 
knowledge of treatment allocation during the trial (performance 
bias and detection bias), and (4) deal with missing outcome data 
(attrition bias). We consistently rated the selective outcome 
reporting domain as ‘unclear’, as there was inadequate informa-
tion available in the trials to evaluate planned versus reported 
outcomes.
statistical analysis
We first qualitatively synthesised included trials and described 
the types of direct and indirect comparisons and their relative 
contributions to the overall body of available evidence.
We then developed network diagrams to visualise the relative 
amount of available evidence on exercise and medications.36 
Nodes represented different exercise and medication inter-
ventions and lines connecting the nodes represented the direct 
head-to-head comparisons between interventions. In network 
diagrams, the size of each node and the thickness of each line 
connecting the nodes were proportional to the number of partic-
ipants. All network diagrams were generated using Stata version 
15.37
To estimate the comparative effectiveness of exercise and 
medications on SBP-lowering, we performed network meta-anal-
yses.38 Such analyses allow for the comparison of treatments 
that have not been directly compared with each other in head-
to-head studies.39 They can also combine evidence obtained 
from direct and indirect comparisons, thereby improving the 
precision of treatment effect estimates.40 41 Similar to pair-wise 
meta-analyses, network meta-analyses preserve the random 
allocation of participants to different arms within each trial; 
however, they compare multiple interventions by combining all

Review
available comparisons between treatments across trials, utilising 
the totality of the available evidence.42
Study-level treatment effects were combined using Bayesian 
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in WinBUGS version 
1.4.3.43 We used the model developed by Dias and colleagues 
for the NICE Decision Support Unit.44–46 Our base-case model 
assumed that the mean change from baseline in SBP per trial 
arm had a normal distribution. The relative effects across trials 
making different comparisons were linked using the identity 
function. This model took into account the correlations between 
treatment effects within multi-arm trials.
We used a random-effects model to perform the network 
meta-analyses, allowing for between-study heterogeneity.47 Our 
models therefore assumed that trial-specific treatment effects 
were drawn from a normal distribution, with a mean that was 
specific for each treatment comparison, and a common vari-
ance that was shared by all comparisons. We reported the mean 
treatment effect with 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) of every 
intervention relative to control and other interventions and the 
estimated between-study heterogeneity SD with its 95% CrI.
To test the consistency assumption of the network meta-anal-
ysis, we compared the fit of the base-case model to that of an 
inconsistency model.48 49 The latter model did not assume consis-
tency between direct and indirect evidence and instead estimated 
independent mean treatment effects.50 We also examined each 
data point’s contribution to the residual deviance and compared 
the estimated between-study heterogeneity in each model. We 
assessed any improvements in fit or reductions in between-study 
heterogeneity in the inconsistency model, which would suggest 
potential inconsistency (see online supplementary appendix 6). 
We plotted the findings of this secondary analysis side-by-side 
with our base-case model that assumed consistency to compare 
the results of the two models. We visually inspected the findings 
and assessed for systematic differences from those obtained from 
our primary analyses (see online supplementary appendix 6).
We compared the SBP-lowering effects of exercise and anti-
hypertensive medications in three sets of analyses: (1) all exer-
cise interventions versus all antihypertensive medications; (2) 
different types of exercise interventions versus different classes 
of medications; and (3) different intensities of exercise interven-
tions versus different doses of medications. We then repeated 
these analyses and compared the antihypertensive RCTs to 
a subset of exercise trials that only included hypertensive 
populations.
We evaluated small-study effects by extending the regres-
sion-based approach proposed by Moreno and colleagues.51–53 
We regressed the treatment effects against their standard errors 
and predicted the pooled effect size for an ideal study of infinite 
size (ie, with zero SE), assuming that smaller studies would be 
more biased than larger studies.54 This meta-regression allowed 
for a different mean bias according to type of comparison (ie, 
mean bias due to small-study effects was assumed to be different 
for RCTs evaluating the effect of exercise versus control and 
medications versus control).55
We adopted non-informative prior distributions for treat-
ment effects (normal (0, 10 000)) and the between-trial variance 
(uniform (0, 10)). Our analyses employed a long burn-in period 
(50 
000 iterations) and follow-up period (100 
000 iterations) to 
allow for convergence. We ran three chains with different sets of 
initial values. We visually inspected trace plots for key parame-
ters for each analysis to assess convergence in terms of stability.

tially relevant meta-analyses of medication therapies aimed 
at lowering baseline SBP (figure 1). Of these, we selected the

first-line therapy for hypertension.56–62 In total, these meta-anal-
yses included 316 RCTs. We excluded the trials and trial arms 
of medications and medication dosages that were not indicated 
in the BNF. After these exclusions, we included 194 medication 
RCTs, corresponding to 57 trials of ACE-I, 36 studies of ARBs, 
63 studies of β-blockers, nine studies of CCBs and 46 studies 
of diuretics. Seventeen RCTs compared one medication class to 
another.
Evidence base for exercise interventions
Of 47 potentially relevant reviews of exercise interventions iden-
tified from Medline, we considered the meta-analysis conducted 
by Cornelissen and Smart to be the most comprehensive in 
terms of its study identification, selection, review and synthesis 
methods.27 This analysis relied on 93 RCTs published up to 
February 2012. We subsequently updated this review and identi-
fied 2619 potentially relevant titles and abstracts published until 
September 2018 (figure 1). We excluded 2316 records that were 
irrelevant. Of 303 full-text articles, we included an additional 
107 RCTs. In total, we ultimately included 197 RCTs of exer-
cise interventions (see online supplementary appendix 3 for trial 
characteristics): 115 of these evaluated endurance training inter-
ventions including walking, running, cycling or aquatic exercises; 
30 RCTs evaluated dynamic resistance interventions; 10 evalu-
ated isometric resistance exercises; and 12 tested endurance and 
resistance training regimens in combination. The remaining 30 
RCTs compared one type of exercise intervention to another. No 
RCTs compared directly exercise against medications.
Characteristics of exercise and medication RCTs
RCTs of exercise interventions included substantially fewer 
participants; average sample size in exercise RCTs was 53 (range 
15–464) compared with 139 (7–1092) in RCTs of β-blockers, 
174 (14–625) in studies of ACE-I, 188 (24–2776) for diuretics, 
185 (15–397) for CCBs and 292 (40–1369) for ARBs. Mean 
age ranged from 50.4 for exercise trials to 55.0 for ARB and 
diuretics trials. On average, a higher proportion of participants 
were women in RCTs of exercise interventions (61%) compared 
with the proportion of women participants in RCTs of medi-
cations (ranging from 39% for ARBs to 47% for β-blockers). 
While the mean SBP at baseline was 132 
mmHg for participants 
in the RCTs of exercise interventions, it was consistently over 
150 
mmHg in medication RCTs (table 1).
Distribution of participants in exercise and medication RCTs
In total, 39 
742 participants were included in RCTs testing 
the SBP-lowering effects of medications and exercise interven-
tions. While 29 
281 participants were included in medication 
trials, 10 
461 were included in exercise RCTs (figure 2A). On 
average, trials of individual medication classes had more partic-
ipants than those included in the RCTs of different types of 
exercise (figure 2B). The majority of participants included in 
exercise RCTs were in trials evaluating the effect of endurance 
training, as compared with control or other exercise interven-
tions (n=8174). Relatively more participants were included in 
trials evaluating moderate-intensity exercise alone (n=4675) 
compared with those testing low- and high-intensity interven-
tions (figure 2C). Fifty-six exercise trials included hypertensive 
participants (≥140 
mmHg), corresponding to 3508 individuals 
(figure 3). A total of 6046 and 1828 participants were included 
in exercise RCTs with hypertensive populations when using a 
cut-off of 130 
mmHg and 150 
mmHg for mean baseline SBP
, 
respectively.
Risk of bias
Figure 4 and online supplementary appendix 5 summarise the 
risk of bias in a 10% random sample of exercise and medication 
RCTs. Seventeen of 20 exercise RCTs were judged to be at high 
risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding, 
while only one medication RCT was at high risk of bias on this 
domain. Risk of attrition bias was also higher in exercise trials 
(5/20) compared with that in medication trials (0/20). Inade-
quate reporting complicated our assessments for selection bias 
with the majority of both exercise and medication trials rated at 
unclear risk of bias.
Comparative effects on sbP
Across all populations, antihypertensive medications (mean 
difference −8.80 
mmHg, 95% CrI −9.58 to −8.02) and exer-
cise interventions (−4.84, 95% CrI −5.55 to −4.13) were both 
effective in lowering SBP from baseline as compared with control 
(figure 5A). Populations receiving medications achieved greater 
reductions in SBP compared with those participating in physical 
activity interventions (−3.96, 95% CrI −5.02 to −2.91).
Compared with control, all types of exercise (endurance 
−4.88, 95% CrI −5.69 to −4.06; resistance −3.50, 95% CrI 
−4.91 to –2.09; isometric −5.65, 95% CrI −8.21 to −3.13; 
and combination of endurance and resistance −6.49, 95% CrI 
−8.17 to −4.82) and all classes of antihypertensive medications

Review
(ACE-I −7.33, 95% CrI −8.75 to −5.91; ARB −8.14, 95% CrI 
−9.62 to −6.69; CCB −10.58, 95% CrI −12.03 to −9.14; 
and diuretic −8.06, 95% CrI −9.48 to −6.64) were effective in 
lowering baseline SBP (figure 5B).
Overall, different types of structured exercise interventions 
achieved similar reductions from baseline (table 2). One excep-
tion was the combination of endurance and resistance training, 
which was more effective in reducing baseline SBP than dynamic 
resistance alone (−2.98, 95% CrI −5.04 to −0.93). While 
different classes of antihypertensive medications were generally 
more effective than different types of exercise interventions,

Review
most medication classes (ACE-I, ARB and diuretic) did not differ 
beyond chance from isometric resistance and combination of 
endurance and dynamic resistance exercises.
Participants in low- (−4.60, 95% CrI −6.51 to −2.69), 
moderate- (−5.41, 95% CrI −6.37 to −4.46) and high-inten-
sity (−3.87, 95% CrI −5.11 to −2.65) exercise groups achieved 
greater reductions in baseline SBP than those in control groups 
(figure 5C). Similarly, low- and high-dose medications were more 
effective than control, lowering baseline SBP by 8.29 
mmHg 
(95% CrI −9.13 to −7.46) and 10.71 
mmHg (95% CrI −11.94 
to −9.46), respectively. While a dose gradient was seen for medi-
cations, there was substantial uncertainty for effects of different 
exercise intensities.
There was no detectable evidence of inconsistency in the 
network meta-analyses (online supplementary appendix 6). In 
our small-study effects analysis, we found some evidence that 
smaller studies reported different results than those in larger 
studies for both exercise and medication interventions (online 
supplementary appendix 7). We observed similar model fit with 
both models according to total residual deviance and deviance 
information criterion. The estimated mean bias for exercise versus 
control was −1.09 (95% CrI −1.89 to −0.34) and −1.75 (95% 
CrI −2.61 to −0.72) for medications versus control; however, 
there was no meaningful reduction in between-study heteroge-
neity when we adjusted for small-study effects, suggesting that 
this adjustment did not necessarily explain the observed differ-
ences in effects across studies. Since the base-case model fitted 
well, inferences about observed improvements to model fit or 
lack thereof may be spurious. Regardless, models adjusted for 
small-study effects tended to produce smaller treatment effect 
estimates for both exercise and medication interventions. Online 
supplementary appendix 7 compares the base-case results with 
predicted effect size for an ideal study of infinite size for each 
intervention.
Comparative effects on sbP among hypertensive populations 
(≥140 mmhg)
Compared with control, exercise reduced SBP by 8.96 
mmHg 
(95% CrI −10.27 to −7.64) among hypertensive populations 
(≥140 
mmHg) (figure 5a). We did not observe a difference 
between the SBP-lowering effects of medications and exercise 
(0.18, 95% CrI −1.35 to 1.68).
SBP was reduced (compared with control) by endurance 
(−8.69, 95% CrI −10.13 to −7.25), dynamic resistance (−7.23, 
95% CrI −10.58 to −3.87) and their combination (−13.51,

Review
95% CrI −16.55 to −10.45), while the 95% CrI included the 
null for isometric resistance (−4.92, 95% CrI −10.28 to 0.38) 
(figure 5B). Overall, different types of exercise interventions 
appeared similar to medications in terms of their SBP-lowering 
effects (table 2).
Hypertensive populations participating in moderate- and 
high-intensity exercise interventions achieved greater reductions 
in SBP compared with those in control groups (figure 5C). There 
were no detectable differences between different intensities of 
exercise and different doses of medications; however, these anal-
yses should be interpreted with caution given the wide 95% CrIs.
sensitivity analyses with different hypertension cut-offs
Figure 6 and online supplementary appendix 8 show the find-
ings of sensitivity analyses comparing the SBP-lowering effects of 
exercise interventions and medications at different hypertension 
cut-offs. Overall, exercise interventions appeared more effective 
as we restricted the sample of exercise trials included in the anal-
ysis to those with more hypertensive populations. For example, 
endurance interventions, compared with control, reduced base-
line SBP by 4.88 (95% CrI −5.69 to –4.06) in the base-case anal-
ysis; respective reductions were 6.84 (95% CrI −7.90 to −5.76) 
in trials with ≥130 
mmHg; 8.70 (95% CrI −10.13 to −7.25) 
with ≥140 
mmHg, and 10.74 (95% CrI −12.70 to −8.77) with 
≥150 
mmHg. There was substantial uncertainty in relative treat-
ment effects when using a cut-off of ≥150 
mmHg.
DIsCussIOn
In this study, we compared the SBP-lowering effects of commonly 
used antihypertensive medications and exercise interventions. 
We found that structured exercise was often evaluated in fewer 
and smaller trials than medications. While the number of partic-
ipants included in exercise trials accounted for approximately 
one third of the total in medication trials, only a 10th of the 
overall hypertensive population (using a 140 
mmHg cut-off) 
came from the exercise trials. Our analyses that synthesised 
the results of 391 RCTs including 39 
742 participants showed 
that individuals receiving medications achieved greater reduc-
tions in SBP than those following structured exercise regimens. 
However, different types of exercise interventions appeared to 
be as equally effective as most antihypertensive medications 
when we limited our analyses to trials in populations with high 
SBP
. The effectiveness of exercise increased as we adopted higher 
SBP cut-offs to define hypertension.
Comparison with other studies in the literature
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first formal eval-
uation of the comparative effectiveness of exercise and medica-
tions on SBP
. However, a large number of previous systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses have examined the SBP-lowering 
effects of medications8 63–66 and exercise separately.27 67–71 
Similar to other reviews, our study identified a diverse set of 
exercise interventions that varied in terms of their formulation, 
intensity, frequency and duration. Aerobic endurance was the 
most frequently studied type of exercise, followed by dynamic 
resistance.
Our findings differed from the meta-analysis by Cornelissen 
and Smart in two key ways.27 First, the magnitude of SBP reduc-
tion achieved with resistance training was considerably higher 
in our study, likely reflecting the large numbers of newer RCTs 
included in our study evaluating this type of exercise and having 
favourable results. This was particularly so when we limited our 
analyses to exercise RCTs with hypertensive populations. Second,

Review
we found compelling evidence that combining endurance and 
dynamic resistance training was effective in reducing SBP
. The 
previous review had insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of 
combining endurance and dynamic resistance exercise.
Implications for policy and practice
These findings could be used to examine and improve the 
evidence base supporting exercise recommendations. Current 
exercise recommendations are primarily based on observational 
evidence and highly variable across different settings.72 For 
example, in the UK, the National Health Service exercise guide-
lines for healthy adults 19 to 64 years of age recommend either 
(1) a combination of at least 150 
min per week of moderate 
aerobic activity and strength training on 2 or more days a week 
or (2) a combination of 75 
min per week of vigorous endur-
ance activity and strength training on 2 or more days a week.73 
Notably, while the guidelines specify the recommended duration 
of strength training, they do not specify its optimal volume and 
intensity. Examining and corroborating the evidence base behind 
these recommendations is not straightforward using the available 
exercise RCTs on SBP
. For example, only a small subset of studies 
identified in our review tested the effectiveness of the combi-
nation of endurance and dynamic resistance training. Although 
these types of interventions were often effective, especially in 
hypertensive populations, their frequency and duration were not 
consistently reported to determine the optimal formulation and 
dose of physical activity to maximise its benefit. We also did not 
observe a dose-response relationship between exercise intensity 
and SBP reduction.
Recent changes to major practice guidelines developed by 
the AHA/ACC will substantially increase the number of people 
labelled as having hypertension.13 14 While our findings support 
previous calls to prescribe exercise as a treatment option for 
hypertension,74 75 relatively little is known about the effective-
ness and comparative effectiveness of implementation strategies 
for optimal exercise uptake.76–79 Healthcare systems are there-
fore ill-equipped to ensure effective adoption of and adherence 
to exercise prescriptions. Despite the availability of national 
guidelines promoting exercise, levels of physical activity remain 
stubbornly low worldwide.80 For example, an estimated 40% of 
adults in the Americas and many European counties are phys-
ically inactive.81 82 Given our findings that even low-intensity 
exercise may be effective in reducing SBP
, renewed attention is 
warranted to identify effective strategies to promote exercise.
While our study suggests that exercise effectively lowers 
baseline SBP
, the generalisability of these findings to real-world 
settings should be investigated further. Most exercise trials 
in our study included healthy adults with optimal or mildly 
elevated blood pressure. When participants had elevated SBP
, 
exercise was often evaluated as an add-on to background anti-
hypertensive therapy. Unlike trial populations in our review, the 
majority of individuals in actual clinical practice who are eligible 
for antihypertensive therapy have multiple chronic conditions 
and receive several medications. Substituting medication therapy 
with exercise prescriptions in these populations may therefore be 
challenging.83 The proportion of such patient populations who 
can adopt some meaningful amount of exercise is unknown. This 
is further compounded by the reporting quality of exercise trials. 
According to a recent analysis, descriptions of exercise interven-
tions in hypertension trials were inadequately detailed for their 
replication in practice.84 Nevertheless, our findings can form the 
basis of evidence-based discussions between patients and their 
doctors about the SBP-lowering benefits of exercise. Although 
the effect of exercise is modest among individuals with moder-
ately elevated SBP
, providers should still have such discussions 
with their patients who are newly eligible for antihypertensive 
therapy as a result of recent changes to the AHA/ACC guidelines.
Implications for research
Studies comparing the effectiveness of medications and 
non-medication interventions are rare. Similar to our previous 
study,28 we did not identify any RCTs that directly compared the 
SBP-lowering effects of antihypertensive medications and struc-
tured training programmes. To address this gap, future studies 
should adopt exercise as an active comparator in trials of inter-
ventions aimed at preventing, managing or treating cardiovas-
cular diseases. Pharmaceutical companies, which in recent years

Review
have sponsored the majority of clinical studies, currently have 
little incentive to design studies that compare their products to 
non-medication alternatives.85 Encouraging sponsors to include 
established non-pharmacological alternatives in head-to-head 
trials will require buy-in from drug licensing agencies such as 
the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medi-
cines Agency, health technology assessment bodies such as NICE, 
research funders such as the National Institutes of Health in the 
USA and National Institute for Health Research in the UK, and 
research ethics committees.
In the absence of head-to-head RCTs that directly compare 
exercise and drug interventions, network meta-analyses can rely 
on existing studies and generate valuable evidence to inform 
policy and practice.86 Network meta-analyses that compare the 
benefits and harms of multiple interventions are increasingly 
common in the medical literature.87 88 However, most consider 
pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions sepa-
rately. Combining these bodies of literature in network meta-anal-
yses could identify areas where exercise interventions should be 
considered as viable alternatives to medications. In areas where 
evidence is inconclusive or biased, network meta-analyses could 
help inform the design of future head-to-head RCTs.89
limitations
This study had several limitations. First, our electronic searches 
were conducted in Medline and did not cover other relevant 
bibliographic databases. Therefore, we may have missed relevant 
RCTs of exercise interventions if they were published in jour-
nals not indexed in Medline. Still, our review covered more than 
twice as many RCTs as those included in the most comprehen-
sive systematic review to date.
Second, we did not update the list of studies included in the 
previously published meta-analyses of antihypertensive medica-
tions, which were published from 2008 to 2016. However, it 
is unlikely that we missed additional RCTs of medications, as 
the majority of antihypertensive medications are off patent and 
there is no longer an active research agenda evaluating their 
SBP-lowering effects.
Third, we relied on indirect evidence to determine the compara-
tive SBP-lowering effects of exercise and medications. Such indirect 
comparisons could be biased if there is an imbalance in the distribu-
tion of unmeasured or unknown relative treatment effect modifiers 
across trials comparing different interventions.90 We summarised 
results from substantially heterogeneous RCT
s from different 
settings and time periods. T
rials included diverse participant popula-
tions, intervention definitions, comparators and outcome measure-
ments. Findings of our network meta-analyses should hence be 
interpreted with caution.91 T
ransitivity may be tenuous given the 
typically different levels of SBP in medication versus exercise trials. 
However, when we tried to match trial populations more closely, 
the gap between medication and exercise in efficacy diminished. As 
we limited our analyses to more hypertensive populations, exercise 
interventions appeared more effective.
Fourth, while we obtained clinically relevant relative treatment 
effects for antihypertensive medications, we may have underesti-
mated the magnitude of SBP lowering associated with exercise inter-
ventions. We excluded trials of medications and dosages that were 
considered to be ineffective or suboptimal by the BNF, even though 
we did not exclude any exercise trials on this basis, as there is no 
equivalent body that is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness 
of structured exercise interventions and determining their suitability 
as treatment options in clinical practice.
Fifth, our review shares the limitations of the studies on which 
it is based. Although we did not formally evaluate the internal 
validity of all included RCTs, we conducted a risk of bias assess-
ment in a 10% random sample. Both exercise and medication 
trials had limitations in their reporting, which severely limited 
our accurate evaluation. We considered exercise trials to be at 
higher risk of performance and detection bias as compared with 
medication trials, primarily due to lack of blinding of investi-
gators and participants in exercise trials. This may have greater 
implications on the reliability of estimates from exercise trials 
given the semi-objective nature of SBP lowering. However, a 
recent meta-epidemiological study found no significant asso-
ciation between treatment effects and adequate blinding in 
physical therapy trials.92 In contrast to the findings of a recent 
comprehensive review that showed a different level of reporting 
bias between meta-analyses of pharmacological and non-phar-
macological interventions,93 we observed a similar relationship 
between trial size and magnitude of effect for both exercise 
and medications. Small-study effects may reflect publication 
bias, differential presence of quality issues in smaller trials, but 
also many other factors.94 Although exercise trials tended to be 
smaller, antihypertensive medication trials were not immune to 
small-study effects, which could explain our findings.
Exercise trials had several other methodological drawbacks. 
The majority of exercise trials included healthy adults with 
optimal blood pressure at baseline; reduction in blood pressure 
may be larger when the starting point is higher. Also, unlike anti-
hypertensive medication trials, most exercise trials evaluated SBP 
only as secondary or tertiary outcomes; sample sizes were often 
too small to adequately control for confounding and produce 
reliable estimates of treatment effects; the composition of 
control arms was heterogeneous (eg, some trials included exer-
cise as an add-on to background antihypertensive therapy while 
others did not allow for such therapy); and the methods used to 
measure SBP varied considerably across trials (eg, ranging from 
office-based measurement to ambulatory measurement). Similar 
to the findings of a recent analysis, reporting of harms associated 
with exercise interventions was rare and inconsistent.84 Taken 
together, these variations highlight the need for a more stan-
dardised approach to the design, conduct, analysis and reporting 
of exercise trials. Whether the reliability of estimates from exer-
cise trials is similar to those from trials of antihypertensive medi-
cations should be evaluated in the future.
COnClusIOns
The effect of exercise interventions on SBP remains under-
studied in relation to commonly used medications, especially 
among hypertensive populations. Many studied types and inten-
sities of exercise interventions demonstrate modest but consis-
tent reductions in SBP across diverse populations and settings. 
The SBP-lowering effects of exercise among hypertensive popu-
lations appear similar to that of commonly used antihypertensive 
medications, but this is tempered by the observed differences in 
study population characteristics.
