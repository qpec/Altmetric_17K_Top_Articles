Suicide in children and young people in England: 
a consecutive case series

Summary
Background There is concern about the mental health of children and young people and a possible rise in suicidal 
behaviour in this group. We have done a comprehensive national multi-agency study of suicide in under 20s in England. 
We aimed to establish how frequently suicide is preceded by child-specifi
 c and young person-specifi
 c suicide risk 
factors, as well as all-age factors, and to identify contact with health-care and social-care services and justice agencies.
Methods This study is a descriptive examination of suicide in a national consecutive sample of children and young 
people younger than 20 years who died by suicide in England between Jan 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015. We obtained 
general population mortality data from the Offi
  ce for National Statistics (ONS). We collected information about 
antecedents considered to be relevant to suicide (eg, abuse, bullying, bereavement, academic pressures, self-harm, 
and physical health) from a range of investigations and inquiries, including coroner inquest hearings, child death 
investigations, criminal justice system reports, and the National Health Service, including data on people in contact 
with mental health services in the 12 months before their death.
Findings 145 suicides in people younger than 20 years were notifi
 ed to us during the study period, of which we were 
able to obtain report data about antecedents for 130 (90%). The number of suicides rose sharply during the late teens 
with 79 deaths by suicide in people aged 18–19 years compared with 66 in people younger than 18 years. 102 (70%) 
deaths were in males. 92 (63%) deaths were by hanging. Various antecedents were reported among the individuals for 
whom we had report data, including academic (especially exam) pressures (35 [27%] individuals), bullying (28 [22%]), 
bereavement (36 [28%]), suicide in family or friends (17 [13%]), physical health conditions (47 [36%]), family problems 
(44 [34%]), social isolation or withdrawal (33 [25%]), child abuse or neglect (20 [15%]), excessive drinking (34 [26%]), 
and illicit drug use (38 [29%]). Suicide-related internet use was recorded in 30 (23%) cases. In the week before death 
13 (10%) individuals had self-harmed and 35 (27%) had expressed suicidal ideas. 56 (43%) individuals had no known 
contact with health-care and social-care services or justice agencies.
Interpretation Improved services for self-harm and mental health are crucial to suicide prevention, but the wide range 
of antecedents emphasises the roles of schools, primary care, social services, and the youth justice system.

Introduction
Suicide at any age is a tragedy, but for the families of 
young people who die by suicide it can be especially 
distressing. The prevalence of suicide is low in young 
people in England compared with other age groups; 
4·4 deaths per 100 000 population in 15–19 year olds 
versus 15·1 deaths per 100 000 population in 40–44 year 
olds.1 Suicide, however, is a leading cause of mortality in 
young people, in whom many common causes in older 
age groups are unusual. In 2013, the suicide rate in 
young people in England was lower than that of 10 years 
ago,2 but this reduction occurred mainly in the early 
2000s and there has been no decrease since about 2006.1 
In Europe, the average suicide rate of children aged 
10–19 years declined substantially during the 2000s.3,4
By contrast, the highest rates of self-harm have been 
reported in young women aged 15–19 years.5 Self-harm is 
strongly associated with increased risk of future suicide,6,7 
especially when alcohol misuse is present.8 Self-harm 
rates have been reported as increasing, to which self-
harm in young people is contributing,9 and rates of 
emotional disorders in children and young people seem 
to have risen since the mid 1970s.10 Public concern about 
the mental health of children has led to a new policy 
focus in England.11
Conventional suicide risk factors in the general 
population, such as a history of self-harm, social 
isolation, and alcohol and drug misuse, are likely to be 
important in children and young people.12 Additionally, 
there are various possible risk factors specifi
 c to the 
lives of children and young people that attract public 
and professional concern. These include exam stresses, 
bullying and online bullying, and suicide-related 
internet use (eg, searching for details of suicide 
methods). Studies of these factors are few, however, and 
are limited by small sample sizes.13–15 Research 
examining the eff
 ect of academic problems on suicidal 
behaviour comes mainly from studies in east and 
southeast Asia.16,17
In England, when a child dies, several possible 
investigations by offi
  cial bodies can occur, such as 
Child Death Overview Panels (CDOPs), the Prisons and 
 Articles
752 
www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 3   August 2016
Probation Ombudsman (PPO), the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission (IPCC), and the National 
Health Service (NHS). Additionally, all deaths by 
suicide are subject to coroner’s inquest. These 
investigations are important to local learning and 
making recommendations for specifi
 c services, but 
national recommendations for multi-agency practice 
are scarce. The investigations examine the circum-
stances leading to death and present a unique 
opportunity to identify a wide range of relevant 
antecedents and possible warning signs.
We are doing a UK-wide investigation of suicides by 
people younger than 25 years. In this report, we present 
fi
 ndings from the fi
 rst phase of the study, examining 
deaths by suicide in people younger than 20 years in 
England. The purpose of the fi
 rst phase was to examine 
possible child-specifi
 c and young person-specifi
 c 
suicide risk factors by use of multiple data sources. The 
second phase will extend the study to include people 
under the age of 25 years from across the UK. In this 
fi
 rst phase, we aimed to establish how frequently 
suicide is preceded by child-specifi
 c and young person-
specifi
 c suicide risk factors, as well as all-age factors, 
and to identify contact with health-care and social-care 
services and justice agencies.
Methods
Study population
We collected data about people aged 10–19 years who 
died by suicide (including probable suicide) and were 
resident in or died in England. Information about these 
deaths was notifi
 ed to the National Confi
 dential Inquiry 
into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness 
(NCISH) by the Offi
  ce for National Statistics (ONS) 
during the fi
 rst year of the study. These deaths occurred 
between Jan 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015, and were 
registered by June 30, 2015. We included deaths for 
which a suicide or undetermined conclusion (open 
verdict) was received at the coroner’s inquest (ICD-10 
codes X60–X84, Y10–Y34 [excluding Y33.9], Y87
.0, and 
Y87
.2), as is conventional in national UK statistics and 
epidemiological studies of suicide.18 Open verdicts are 
often returned on probable suicides where the required 
standard of evidence for a suicide verdict is not met—
exclusion of such deaths could lead to an underestimation 
of suicide fi
 gures.18 Narrative conclusions, summary 
descriptions of the circumstances leading to death, were 
included if one of the above ICD-10 codes was applied to 
the death by the ONS.
The study received approval from the National Research 
Ethics Committee North West (Greater Manchester 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did an electronic search of the databases Scopus, MEDLINE, 
and PsycINFO to identify studies that explored suicide in 
children and young people. The search terms used were 
“suicid*”, and “child*”, “adolescen*”, “youth*”, “teen*,” “young 
people”, and “young adult”. We excluded non-English language 
articles. We applied no date or study design restrictions to the 
search and we searched for articles published up to Jan 14, 
2016. We did not do a systematic review. Most studies that we 
found analysed participants’ self-reported data or were 
psychological autopsy studies or retrospective case series 
restricted by small numbers. There were also several birth 
cohort studies. Studies usually investigated suicidal ideation, 
non-suicidal self-injury, or suicide attempts rather than death 
by suicide. Existing evidence suggests that several risk factors 
for suicide are common to all age groups, including self-harm, 
mental illness, alcohol or drug misuse, and social isolation. 
However, there are also child-specifi
 c and young person-specifi
 c 
factors such as family adversity, bullying, the role of internet 
sites and social media, and educational factors. A controlled 
study would have been diffi
  cult to achieve because of the 
challenges in obtaining equivalent data for matched controls. 
The present study is therefore a national case series.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst national study to combine 
multiple sources of information to investigate the prevalence of 
a range of antecedents in children and young people who died 
by suicide in England. Our results show that multiple stressors 
and experiences occur before suicide and might be contributing 
factors. More than half of individuals previously demonstrated 
risk through self-harm, most often by cutting. Suicidal ideas 
were conveyed by roughly a quarter of this sample in the week 
before death. Most individuals were not known to specialist 
mental health services and almost half were not known to any 
agency. A higher proportion of females experienced many of 
the antecedents identifi
 ed in this study, including self-harm, 
physical health conditions, bereavement, abuse, bullying, and 
exam pressures. Females were also more likely to be known to 
services. Illicit drug use was more prevalent among males.
Diff
 erences were evident in antecedents in under 18s compared 
with 18–19 year olds. Bullying, academic pressures and abuse 
were more common in under 18s. Serious self-harm, illicit drug 
use, and excessive drinking were more prevalent in 18–19 year 
olds than in under 18s.
Implications of all the available evidence
Greater awareness of possible risk factors (including so-called 
fi
 nal straw stressors such as exam pressures and relationship 
problems) by services, families, and young people themselves 
can contribute to prevention of future deaths. Improved 
services for self-harm and access to Child and Adolescent 
Mental Health Services are crucial to suicide prevention. The 
antecedents of suicide identifi
 ed in this study also show the 
important role of schools, primary care, social services, and 
youth justice in countering suicide risk.

South, UK) on April 13, 2015. Exemption under Section 
251 of the NHS Act 2006, enabling access to confi
 dential 
and identifi
 able information without informed consent 
in the interest of improving care, was also obtained from 
the Health Research Authority Confi
 dentiality Advisory 
Group (HRA-CAG) on May 6, 2015.
Data sources
We collected data about individuals from a range of 
investigations and inquiries by offi
  cial bodies. We did not 
conduct new investigations. 145 suicides by people 
younger than 20 years were reported to us during the 
study period, of which we were able to obtain report data 
on 130 (90%).
We requested audio copies of inquest hearings (or 
where not available, copy statements or depositions 
submitted as evidence at the inquest) in all cases and we 
obtained recordings for 127 (88%) deaths. In six (4%) 
cases, the coroner did not wish to provide data to the study 
and in 12 (8%) cases, recordings had not been returned at 
the time of writing. For all items extracted from an initial 
23 (18%) coroner inquest hearings, we examined 
concordance rates between two independent researchers 
(CR and ST). Where there was an inconsistency, the 
information was reassessed and an agreement reached 
following discussion. Concordance rates for individual 
items in these 23 cases were 78–100%. Subsequently, 
where there were uncertainties or disagreements, these 
were resolved by discussion between raters (CR and ST) 
and consensus decision was reached.
Deaths of all children younger than 18 years are 
reviewed by a CDOP on behalf of the Local Safeguarding 
Children Board (LSCB). The CDOP is a multi-agency 
panel that reviews information from all agencies involved 
with the child and their family before the death. The 
CDOP identifi
 es factors that might have contributed to 
the susceptibility or death of the child by use of an 
analysis proforma (Form C). We approached 83 LSCBs 
where suicides were known to have occurred on the basis 
of ONS notifi
 cation. 56 LSCBs agreed to participate in 
the study. 13 did not wish to participate citing uncertainty 
about the release of personal data and 14 did not respond. 
Of the 56 who agreed to participate, 38 provided data, 
resulting in 35 Form C returns. A further eight LSCBs 
had not reviewed any deaths by suicide or self-infl
 icted 
harm during the study period. Ten LSCBs had not 
reviewed, fi
 nalised, or provided the Form C to the study 
at the time of writing.
A Serious Case Review (SCR) is commissioned after a 
child (age <18 years) dies or is seriously injured and abuse 
or neglect is known or suspected or where there is a cause 
for concern about the way professionals acted together to 
safeguard the child.19 The SCR report describes the 
circumstances of the death and actions to prevent future 
harm. We sought SCR reports from the relevant LSCB or 
from the national SCR repository20 in which they are 
deposited by the publishing LSCB. We obtained fi
 ve SCRs.
NCISH collects a UK-wide case series of individuals 
who die by suicide and were in contact with mental 
health services in the 12 months before their death. 
Clinical information about these people is collected via a 
questionnaire completed by the consultant psychiatrist 
who provided care. A full description of NCISH data 
collection processes has been reported previously.2 We 
obtained clinical information for 17 (12%) patients. 
However, this number is likely to be an underestimate 
because NCISH data collection procedures were 
continuing at the time of writing.
We requested NHS serious incident reports from the 
medical director of the treating NHS Trust if NCISH data 
showed that the individual had been in contact with 
mental health services in the 12 months before death. 
Serious incident reports describe the trust’s internal 
investigation of an incident. We obtained serious incident 
reports for 18 individuals.
The PPO independently investigates the deaths of 
prisoners, young people in detention, residents in 
approved premises, and immigration detainees by all 
causes. Following investigation, and after the coroner 
inquest, a fatal investigation report is published on the 
PPO website.21 The PPO notifi
 ed us of deaths in 
individuals younger than 20 years by apparent suicide 
during the study period, after which a report could be 
located on the PPO website. Of two deaths investigated 
by the PPO, we obtained one report. The second report 
was unpublished at the time of writing.
As well as overseeing the police complaints system in 
England and Wales, the IPCC investigates deaths by 
apparent suicide that occur in police custody and in the 
48 h after release from custody. The IPCC decide whether 
to investigate a death referred to them independently, 
manage or supervise the police force’s investigation, or 
return it for local investigation. The IPCC notifi
 ed us 
when any death by apparent suicide following police 
custody by individuals younger than 20 years was 
investigated. One death occurred within 2 days of leaving 
police custody and was subject to local force investigation; 
we obtained the police report from the coroner.
Procedures
We collected information from the described data 
sources and extracted the data onto a proforma for 
aggregated analysis. We collected information about 
demographic 
factors 
(relationship 
status, 
living 
circumstances), education (exam stress, academic 
pressures), medical history (physical health conditions), 
psychiatric history (mental disorders), social media and 
internet use, service contact (with general practitioner 
[GP], emergency department, or social care), bullying or 
abuse, disturbance to the family environment (mental 
illness or substance misuse in a parent or carer, social 
isolation, bereavement), and suicide method (including 
presence of a suicide note). We recorded these factors 
when they were referred to in any of the data sources as

having been present in the person’s life at some time and 
specifi
 cally in the 3 months before death. Reference to an 
antecedent at an investigation suggests that it was seen 
as relevant to the death but not necessarily that it was 
causal. Defi
 nitions are shown in the panel.
Statistical analysis
The main fi
 ndings are presented as proportions. The 
denominator in all estimates was the total number of 
cases on which at least one report was received (n=130), 
unless otherwise specifi
 ed. Items were deemed to be 
absent if reference was not made to them in any 
information source; if an item was not recorded, then we 
assumed it to be absent or not relevant to the case. We did 
subgroup analysis with the χ² test of independence or 
Fisher’s exact test (when any subgroup had an expected 
frequency of less than fi
 ve). We considered a two sided 
p value of less than 0·05 to be statistically signifi
 cant. 
Where stated, we analysed under 18s and 18–19 year olds 
and males and females separately. We used Stata version 
13.0 for all analyses.
We are aware that some factors are reported for a small 
number of deaths, including some that are potentially 
sensitive such as a history of abuse. We have therefore 
applied ONS guidance on disclosure.22 Specifi
 cally, we 
have eliminated factors with a count of less than three. 
Where we report subgroups with small numbers of three 
and greater, we present no further information on these 
individuals. All data are taken from a national sample 
and there are no data on geographical areas with 
populations less than 5000.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the 
data in the study and were jointly responsible for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between Jan 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015, we were notifi
 ed 
of 145 deaths by suicide in children and young people 
under the age of 20 years, which corresponded to a 
prevalence 
in 
2014 
of 
2·1 
deaths 
by 
suicide 
per 100 000 10–19 year olds in England. 102 (70%) of 
those who died were male, giving a male-to-female ratio 
of 2·4:1. The number of suicides seemed to increase 
with age, as did the proportion of males (fi
 gure 1). The 
most common method of suicide was hanging or 
strangulation, followed by jumping and multiple 
injuries—mainly being struck by a train (16 [11%] 
individuals) or jumping from a height (11 [8%]). Self-
poisoning by overdose was unusual; there were a similar 
number of deaths following gas inhalation (fi
 gure 2).
We obtained information about the antecedents of 
suicide for 130 (90%) of the 145 children and young 
people who died by suicide in the study time period 
(tables 1, 2). We obtained information from more than 
one source for 50 individuals; there were no major 
discrepancies about relevant antecedents between data 
sources. Most information was obtained from coroner 
inquest hearings (127 individuals). Of the 130 individuals 
with data about antecedents, 92 (71%) were male and 
14 (11%) were from a black or minority ethnic group.
We found evidence of possible disturbance to the 
family environment in 44 (34%) individuals, including 
mental or physical illness or substance misuse in a 
parent, carer, or sibling; or domestic abuse. In 47 (36%) 
Panel: Defi
 nitions
Social isolation, recent social withdrawal
No or few friends, had recently (within 3 months before death) showed behaviour such as 
isolating themselves in their bedroom.
History of abuse
Any history of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse.
Academic pressures
Diffi
  culties with schoolwork; (perceived) failure to meet own, teacher, or parental 
expectations; current exams; impending exams or exam results; other non-exam 
academic-related stresses, and any other student-related problems.
Serious recent episode of self-harm
The last episode of self-harm required medical treatment by either a general practitioner 
(GP) or in hospital.
Medical evidence
The presence of a mental disorder was taken from medical evidence heard during the 
coroner’s inquest or recorded from an National Health Service serious incident report or 
National Confi
 dential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide data. Data about medication or a 
serious recent episode of self-harm were collected in the same way. Physical health 
conditions were recorded from medical evidence heard during the coroner’s inquest or 
from other sources of data available, such as a child death investigation.
Excessive alcohol use
Alcohol use was recorded as an antecedent in reports in diff
 erent ways; eg, at a level of 
misuse, persistent heavy drinking, or binge drinking, but with a common theme of 
excessive use.
Family problems
Recent arguments, reported diffi
  cult relationships with family members, and problems 
within the family environment such as domestic violence or mental illness.
Relationship problems
Recent arguments with a current or ex-partner, being in an on-off
  relationship, having an 
aff
 air, or reported diffi
  culties within the relationship. Relationship break-up was recorded 
as a separate antecedent.
Previous or current contact with services 
Mental health service contact included any contact with child and adolescent or adult 
mental health services, including drug and alcohol services; contact with social care or 
local authority services included child protection services, secure local authority care, 
social services, or being a previous or current looked after child; youth justice or police 
contact included contact with a youth off
 ending team or with the police either as an 
off
 ender or a victim of crime. No known contact with any agencies or services excludes 
contact with a GP or in an emergency department.

individuals, family problems occurred in the 3 months 
before death. 55 (42%) lived with two parents (including 
a step-parent) at the time of death. Living alone was 
unusual but social isolation or recent social withdrawal 
was reported in 33 (25%) individuals. 42 (32%) had 
relationship problems in the 3 months before death 
and 25 (19%) had experienced a relationship break-up 
in this time.
Overall, abuse, neglect, or both was known to have 
happened to 20 (15%) individuals, six of whom had 
previously been under a Child Protection Plan or subject 
to a statutory order. Most abuse and neglect was 
historical.
Face-to-face bullying was more common than 
online bullying; in most cases of online bullying, 
face-to-face bullying had also occurred. For most 
individuals, the bullying was historical; nine (7%) were 
known to have experienced bullying in the 3 months 
before death.
In six (5%) of the 36 individuals who had experienced 
bereavement, this was multiple bereavement. Nine (7%) 
individuals had been bereaved by the death of a parent 
and 17 (13%) had been bereaved by suicide. Of those 
bereaved by suicide, nine (7%) individuals had lost a 
family member or partner and eight (6%) had lost a 
friend or acquaintance. In 12 (33%) of these 
36 individuals, the bereavement had occurred more than 
12 months before their death. Five (4%) individuals had 
been bereaved in the 3 months before death.
35 (27%) individuals were recorded as experiencing 
academic pressures (51% of the 69 individuals in 
education). Of the 20 (15%) facing pressures related to 
current exams, impending exams, or exam results, 
11 were known to be experiencing exam-related stress. 
Four individuals died on the day of an exam or the 
following day. Six (5%) were reported as experiencing 
academic-related stress unrelated to exams (eg, struggling 
with assignments or being unhappy with their university 
course). In 25 (19%) individuals, the academic pressures 
occurred in the 3 months before death.
Internet use related to suicide (ie, internet searches for 
suicide methods, suicidal ideas posted on social media, 
or online bullying) was recorded in 30 (23%) deaths. Of 
the 16 individuals who had searched the internet for 
information about suicide methods, fi
 ve died by a 
method they were known to have searched.
In 36 of the 47 individuals who had a physical health 
condition requiring medical attention, the condition had 
lasted longer than 12 months. The most common 
conditions were dermatological problems such as acne 
and eczema (14 [11%] individuals) and respiratory 
diseases such as asthma (13 [10%]). We had little 
information about treatments for these conditions.
In the 3 months before death, 27 (21%) individuals had 
taken illicit drugs, most often cannabis (23 [18%]). In six of 
these 27 people, this included drugs other than cannabis. 
Four were known to have taken so-called legal highs.

Most individuals had a history of self-harm, with 
cutting the most common method. In 25 (36%) of 
70 individuals with previous self-harm, the most recent 
episode required medical intervention by either a GP 
or in an emergency department. Similarly, most 
individuals were known to have expressed thoughts of 
suicide, most often to a family member (31 [24%] 
individuals), friends or peers (19 [15%]), or a health 
professional such as a GP or in an emergency department 
(16 [12%]). 12 (9%) individuals posted suicidal thoughts 
via social media. In the week before death, 13 (10%) 
individuals had an episode of self-harm—medical 
intervention at an emergency department was required 
for three of them—and 35 (27%) were reported to have 
expressed suicidal ideas or intent, with 21 (16%) 
expressing these on the day of death.
The most common mental health diagnosis was 
aff
 ective disorder (table 1). 79 (61%) individuals had no 
diagnosis of any mental disorder. 47 (36%) had been 
prescribed medication; information about the type of 
medication prescribed was available for 42 of these 
people. 30 (23%) individuals had been prescribed 
psychotropic medication; 20 (15%) were prescribed 
antidepressants, most often SSRIs (17 [13%]).
56 (43%) individuals had no known contact with any 
agencies or services. Of those known to have had service 
contact (74 [57%] individuals), this was most often with 
mental health services (53 [41%]). 23 (18%) individuals 
had contact with social care or local authority services 
and 39 (30%) had contact with youth justice or the police. 
Five (4%) individuals were a looked after child at the time 
of death and another three (2%) had previously been a 
looked after child. In the week before death, 29 (22%) 
individuals had contact with one or more agencies: 
16 (12%) with mental health services, fi
 ve (4%) with social 
care or local authority services, and nine (7%) with youth 
justice or the police.
We detected diff
 erences in antecedents before suicide 
between males and females (table 1). Online bullying, a 
history of sexual abuse (fi
 ve [13%] females vs three [3%] 
males; p=0·04) and physical health conditions were 
signifi
 cantly more common in females. Females were 
more likely to have self-harmed, especially by cutting, 
and to have required medical intervention for self-harm. 
More females left a suicide note than did males. A higher 
proportion of females had been under child and 
adolescent mental health services and social care or local 
authority services and more had been looked after 
children. We also found some diff
 erences that were not 
signifi
 cant. Bereavement, exam pressures, witnessing 
domestic abuse, and a history of abuse seemed to be 
more common in females, whereas a history of illicit 
drug use was more common in males. More males had 
no known contact with any agencies before death than 
did females.
We compared individuals younger than 18 years with 
those aged 18–19 years (table 2). 66 (46%) under 18s and 
79 (54%) 18–19 year olds died by suicide during the 
study period. Exam pressures, mental illness in the 
family, a history of abuse, and self-harm by cutting 
 
 
were signifi
 cantly more common in under 18s. Under 
18s were less likely to have a diagnosis of mental 
disorder than were 18–19 year olds and were more likely 
to be seen by social care or local authority services. We 
also noted some diff
 erences that were not signifi
 cant. 
Bullying, including online bullying, was more frequent 
in under 18s, whereas excessive drinking and illicit 
drug use were more common in 18–19 year olds.

Discussion
We were notifi
 ed of 145 suicides and probable suicides in 
England by people younger than 20 years during the 
16 month study period. Compared to the general 
population, the suicide rate is relatively low at this age,1 
but we found an escalation of risk during the late teen 
years (ie, 18–19 years), and a complex pattern of stresses 
and adverse events before suicide occurred. Most deaths 
were in males, but the male-to-female ratio was 2·4:1, 
which is lower than that in the population of England as 
a whole (more than 3:1).2 Most deaths were by hanging 
and the next most common method was jumping in 
front of a train or from a height—methods assumed to 
show severe mental disturbance and strong lethal 
intent.23 Deaths by drug overdose, one of the main suicide 
methods in the general population,2 were relatively 
uncommon in this age group.
We found many antecedents that might have contributed 
to individual deaths; previous research suggests that 
suicide is usually the result of multiple factors.24 Some are 
suicide risk factors at any age whereas others seem to be 
specifi
 c to young people. Academic pressures, especially 
related to exams, were common, although often 
unrecognised at the time, and four deaths occurred on the 
day of an exam or the day after. Bullying, usually face to 
face rather than online, was reported in 22% of individuals, 
but often this was historical rather than recent; when 
online bullying occurred, it was usually accompanied by 
face-to-face bullying. Suicide-related internet use was 
reported in roughly a quarter of young people; 12% were 
known to have searched online on suicide methods and,

although most used methods that were well known, it is 
possible that the unusual pattern of methods might refl
 ect 
information obtained in this way.
Bereavement was frequently reported, and 13% of 
individuals had experienced a suicide by a family 
member or friend. More than a third had a physical 
health condition, usually long-standing. The most 
common conditions were acne and asthma, both of 
which could lead to withdrawal from social activities.25,26 
Although acne is common in young people,27 in these 
cases it was severe enough to need medical attention.
Several limitations arise from our reliance on 
information recorded by coroners and in offi
  cial 
investigations. First, the information might have been 
subject to recall bias and variations in accuracy and 
completeness. For example, where we recorded 
“excessive alcohol use”, we did not have access to fully 
accurate data about the severity of alcohol use. Families 
and others might also “search after meaning” after a 
suicide, emphasising the factors that they see as most 
relevant.28 This might have increased our fi
 gures for 
some antecedents. Second, when a factor of interest 
was missing, we assumed it was absent; we are 
therefore likely to have underestimated fi
 gures in 
sensitive or private subjects such as child abuse or 
internet use. Third, this study was observational with 
no control group and the antecedents cannot be 
assumed to be risk factors or linked causally to suicide. 
For example, we were unable to compare the prevalence 
of exam stress in a general population sample. Control 
groups in this type of research can be problematic, 
especially with respect to the equivalence of data 
sources.29 Fourth, there might have been recording or 
ascertainment bias because the data that we used were 
not designed for research purposes and varied in 
content; the bodies completing the investigations were 
not blind to the outcome. Fifth, we investigated many 
social and clinical antecedents in small subgroup 
samples (ie, between age groups) so the potential risk 
of type I and type II errors is present.
However, inquest and investigation reports provide a 
summary of events and circumstances preceding a 
suicide, after independent examination of evidence from 
several sources. Although they do not attribute causality, 
they do focus on what they consider to be relevant. Our 
study has aggregated the fi
 ndings of these investigations 
and our results are a summation of relevant antecedents.
Numerous factors contribute to the sharp rise in 
suicide in the late teens. Many of these factors are 
common in young people in general and on their own 
cannot be used to predict suicide risk. Some factors that 
might contribute to risk have been long standing (eg, 
child abuse, substance misuse, or mental illness in the 
family) and others arise later (eg, bereavement or 
bullying), before new stresses precipitate suicide (eg, 
exam pressures or relationship break-up). This pattern 
of cumulative risk and so-called fi
 nal straw phenomena 
could off
 er opportunities to intervene: prevention of 
future deaths by suicide depends on society-wide 
awareness of risks, as well as actions by particular 
services.
Many children and young people who die by suicide 
have previously demonstrated their risk through self-
harm or expressing suicidal ideas. Others are in 
vulnerable groups such as looked after children and 
those under mental health care. For many, however, risk 
is not explicit. Many of these children and young people 
had not expressed recent suicidal ideas. Males are less 
likely to be known to services and to have self-harmed 
than are females. Although the overall risk is low, services 
and families should recognise the serious potential risk 
for some children and young people who are bereaved or 
under exam pressure, witnessing domestic abuse or 
using drugs, or who could be facing risk online or have 
themselves experienced a suicide.
In the next phase of this study, we will investigate in 
more detail the nature of contact with services before 
suicide in a wider age range—ie, under 25s. Improved 
services for self-harm and access to child and adolescent 
mental health services are crucial to reduce risk, but the 
antecedents in this study make clear the crucial role of 
schools, primary care, social services, and youth justice.
