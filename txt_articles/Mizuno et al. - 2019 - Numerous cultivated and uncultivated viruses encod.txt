Viruses modulate ecosystems by directly altering host metabolisms through auxiliary
metabolic genes. However, viral genomes are not known to encode the core components of
translation machinery, such as ribosomal proteins (RPs). Here, using reference genomes and
global-scale viral metagenomic datasets, we identify 14 different RPs across viral genomes
arising from cultivated viral isolates and metagenome-assembled viruses. Viruses tend to
encode dynamic RPs, easily exchangeable between ribosomes, suggesting these proteins can
replace cellular versions in host ribosomes. Functional assays confirm that the two most
common virus-encoded RPs, bS21 and bL12, are incorporated into 70S ribosomes when
expressed in Escherichia coli. Ecological distribution of virus-encoded RPs suggests some level
of ecosystem adaptations as aquatic viruses and viruses of animal-associated bacteria are
enriched for different subsets of RPs. Finally, RP genes are under purifying selection and thus
likely retained an important function after being horizontally transferred into virus genomes.

uring billions of years of co-evolution with their hosts,
viruses have evolved numerous strategies to directly
modulate metabolic pathways and subvert key cellular
biosynthetic machineries, which ensure their successful propa-
gation. For example, ocean viruses that infect cyanobacteria
(cyanophages) commonly encode core photosynthetic reaction
center proteins, which serve to maintain the complex photo-
synthetic machinery during infection1,2. These and other ocean
viruses can similarly manipulate their host’s ability to alter central
carbon metabolism3, uptake phosphate4, and cycle nitrogen5,6,
and sulfur7,8—the fundamental building blocks of life. Com-
plementarily, viruses employ a diverse array of host take-over
strategies to (i) fight off host defenses by encoding anti-
restriction-modification or anti-CRISPR genes9,10, (ii) control
transcription by encoding sigma factors or polymerases them-
selves11, and (iii) affect how proteins are translated. Indeed, many
bacterial and some eukaryotic viruses with large double-stranded
DNA genomes commonly encode a range of tRNA genes4,12–14.
While these genes are presumed to boost the translational effi-
ciency and virulence in diverse hosts15,16, their importance dur-
ing infection remains to be demonstrated experimentally. Giant
mimiviruses, whose genomes approach the size of small bacterial
genomes, carry many typically cellular genes including those for
translation initiation, elongation, and termination, as well as a
range
of
aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases17–19,
among
which
methionine- and tyrosine-tRNA synthetases have been func-
tionally characterized20. A single tRNA synthetase gene is also
encoded in the genome of the largest known bacterial virus,
Bacillus megaterium myovirus G21, but its function lacks
experimental confirmation. Some marine phages encode peptide
deformylases, which are involved in post-translational modifica-
tion22 that, at least in cyanophages, may help preferentially
produce the phage-encoded D1 photosystem protein23. Finally,
T7-like podoviruses encode serine/threonine kinases that have
been shown to phosphorylate around 90 proteins, including
several involved in protein translation, such as host-encoded
ribosomal proteins bS1 and bS6, translation initiation factors IF1,
IF2, and IF3, and elongation factors G and P24,25. It was suggested
that phosphorylation of these proteins may stimulate translation
of the phage late mRNAs. Although it is now clear that viruses
have evolved different strategies to tinker with protein translation,
the genes encoding proteins that directly participate in the for-
mation of the ribosomes are not yet observed in the genomes of
cultured viral isolates. In fact, this feature—ribosome-encoding or
not—has been proposed to signify a major divide between cellular
life forms and viruses26,27. However, viral genome fragments
assembled from environmental viral community sequence data-
sets (viral metagenomes), which vastly expand upon cultured
sequence space, suggested that viruses might encode ribosomal
proteins, specifically, bS1 and bS21. Though challenges insuring
removal of contamination from cellular genomes and the lack of
host context available warrants caution about such observations
of “cellular features” in metagenome-only datasets22,28, the
findings are intriguing.
Here we leverage the greater genomic context now available
from large-scale metagenomes and genomes to revisit the ques-
tion of whether viral genomes encode ribosomal proteins (RPs).
We identify 14 different RPs across viral genomes arising from
cultivated viral isolates and metagenome-assembled viruses. We
show that viruses tend to encode RPs known to be easily
exchangeable between ribosomes, suggesting these proteins can
replace cellular versions in host ribosomes, and confirm this
experimentally for the two most common virus-encoded RPs,
bS21 and bL12. Ecological distribution of virus-encoded RPs
suggests certain level of ecosystem adaptations as aquatic viruses
and viruses of animal-associated bacteria are enriched for
different subsets of RPs. Overall, these results further blur the
borders between viruses and cellular life forms.
Results
Ribosomal proteins encoded in cultivated virus genomes. To
systematically investigate the presence of RP-encoding genes in
viral genomes, we first searched available reference genomes of
cultivated viruses. Of 106 RP domains (Supplementary Table 1)
that seeded our searches, 5 were identified across 16 viral gen-
omes (Table 1). The genes were generally embedded within
variable genomic contexts, even for homologous RP genes
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Note that throughout this article we use
the unified RP nomenclature29, where capital letters “S” and “L”,
respectively, indicate whether the protein is present in the small
or large ribosome subunit, whereas the lowercase letters denote
that the protein is specific to bacteria (b), eukaryotes/archaea (e),
or are universal (u).
We first identified a ribosomal protein eS30 domain, a
component of the small 40S ribosomal subunit30, in the
Finkel–Biskis–Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MuSV), a
member of the family Retroviridae. This domain was part of
the fau gene fused to an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). FBR-MuSV has acquired the cDNA
copy of fau in inverse orientation, and production of the antisense
RNA suppresses expression of endogenous fau mRNA, which
leads to apoptosis inhibition and induces tumorigenesis30,31.
Although the viral protein is not translated30, the antisense
transcript affects the production of the cellular fau31 and thus
might have an indirect effect on the ribosome biogenesis.
The remainder of the virus-encoded ribosomal proteins—bS21,
bL9, bL12, and ribosome hibernation promotion factor (HPF)—
were
found
in
bacterial
viruses
(bacteriophages)
infecting
proteobacteria (from three different classes) and mycobacteria
(phylum Actinobacteria) hosts (Table 1). Though RP-encoding
bacteriophage genomes ranged in size between 44.5 and 358.6 kb,
only large (>130 kb) genomes encoded bS21 and HPF, whereas
only smaller (<80 kb) genomes encoded bL9 and bL12 (Table 1).
However, many more phage genomes encoding RP would be
needed to verify the significance of this observation.
The bS21 homolog was identified in pelagiphage HTVC008M,
a myovirus. bS21 is a conserved component of the bacterial 30S
ribosomal subunit (Fig. 1a) required for the initiation of
polypeptide synthesis and mediates the base-pairing reaction
between mRNA and 16S rRNA32. The viral protein was most
similar (54% identity over the protein length) to the correspond-
ing protein of its host, Pelagibacter ubique (Fig. 1b), an abundant
member of the SAR11 clade (class Alphaproteobacteria), which is
considered to represent one of the most numerous bacterial
groups worldwide33. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis
showed that bS21 homologs from different families of alphapro-
teobacteria cluster together and form a sister group to the
mitochondrial homolog, consistent with the scenario under which
mitochondria have evolved from an alphaproteobacterial ances-
tor. In this tree, all alphaproteobacterial sequences are basal to the
viral protein, strongly suggesting that the phage gene was
horizontally acquired from the Pelagibacter host (Fig. 1c).
Ribosomal protein bL9 was identified in Mycobacterium phage
32HC, a siphovirus. bL9 binds to the 23S rRNA and is a
component of the large 50S ribosome subunit (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). The protein is involved in translation fidelity and is
required to suppress frameshifting, and stop codon “hopping”34.
bL9 has a highly conserved architecture consisting of two widely
spaced globular RNA-binding domains connected by an elon-
gated α-helix35. While the C-terminal domain in the viral bL9
homolog has been apparently non-homologously replaced with a

 sequence that lacks known function, the N-terminal RNA-
binding domain and part of the α-helical spacer are preserved
(Supplementary Fig. 2b), suggesting that the viral protein may
bind to the 23S rRNA.
The next ribosomal protein encoded in sequenced viral
genomes was bL12, which was found in 7 phages infecting
proteobacteria from three different classes (Table 1). The bL12
proteins participate in the formation of the so-called bL12 stalk, a
clearly defined morphological feature in the E. coli 50S ribosomal
subunit, which besides bL12, contains ribosomal proteins uL10
and uL11 as well as the uL10- and uL11-binding region of the 23S
rRNA36 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The phage-encoded bL12
domains are similar (~30–40% identity) to bona fide cellular
ribosomal homologs and contain conserved residues involved in
interaction with uL11 and elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Although in some phages (e.g., Ralstonia
phage RSB3), the bL12 domain spans the entire protein, it was
more common to observe these domains variably positioned
within much larger polypeptides (up to 724 aa-long; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4b). Notably, searches seeded with sequences flanking
the bL12 domain in phage proteins resulted in identification of
multiple phage homologs which specifically lack the bL12 domain
(Supplementary Fig. 5). For example, proteins encoded by
Salmonella phages FSL_SP-058 and FSL_SP-076 contain the

 bL12 domains, whereas homologous protein from Escherichia
phage Pollock lacks this domain, despite conservation of the
upstream and downstream regions (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Furthermore, in different phage genomes, bL12 proteins were
encoded within widely different genomic contexts (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1). These observations suggest that bL12 domain has
been acquired by different phages on multiple, independent
occasions, with some of these genes possibly being fixed in the
phage genomes.
The last ribosomes-associated protein encoded in sequenced
viral genomes was the ribosome hibernation promotion factor

domain-containing
protein, which was encoded by 7 phages infecting Cronobacter
and E. coli (six closely related phages with 92–97% average
nucleotide identity) (Supplementary Fig. 6). HPF proteins are
expressed during stasis and under unfavorable growth conditions;
HPF binds ribosomes to stabilize 100S dimers that inhibit
translation to enable cells to control translational activity without
costly alteration of the ribosomal pool37. Multiple sequence
alignment shows high conservation of the viral and cellular HPF
homologs (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that the gene
transfer has occurred in a relatively recent past. In the HPF

protein encoded by Cronobacter phage clusters with sequences

is confounded by a potential long-branch-attraction artifact
(Supplementary Fig. 8).
Ribosomal proteins detected in viral metagenomes. To place
these findings of cultivated virus-encoded RPs into broader eco-
logical context, we searched 424,225 viral contigs from two global
metagenomic datasets8,38 for putative RPs using the same
106 sequence profiles (see Methods). Overall, 13 putative ribo-
somal protein genes were identified across 1403 contigs (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 3). By matching
CRISPR spacers, comparing k-mer nucleotide frequencies and
performing BLASTn homology searches against reference cellular
sequences, hosts could be predicted for 74 (5.3%) of the uncul-
tivated viruses encoding 7 different RPs (Supplementary Data 1).
Despite this relatively low fraction of predicted hosts, RP-
encoding phages are already associated with 8 bacterial phyla
(Proteobacteria,
Firmicutes,
Verrucomicrobia,
Bacteroidetes,
Deinococcus-Thermus,
Thermotogae,
Cyanobacteria,
and
Actinobacteria).
The bS21, bL12, and HPF, which were found in cultivated
phages, were also detected in uncultivated phages, with bS21
homologs dominating (88%) the pool of RPs detected (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table 2). While found in only one cultivated
phage (see above), maximum likelihood phylogeny and genome
context comparison using these metagenomic data suggested that
multiple virus-host exchanges of bS21 protein-coding genes have
occurred, likely across various bacterial phyla (Fig. 3). Notably,
bS21-encoding viruses were almost exclusively from aquatic
samples (90% of bS21s detected). Such repeated transfers and
enrichment in aquatic samples suggest that virus-encoded bS21
proteins likely can provide a direct fitness benefit to aquatic
bacteriophages. By contrast, bL12 and HPF were found across a
broad range of samples (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9),
suggesting that their repeated acquisition could be beneficial in
multiple types of conditions and hosts.
Another 10 RPs detected in uncultivated viruses were not
previously identified in isolate genomes (Supplementary Table 2).
Commonly (>10 viral contigs) detected among these are bL31
and bL33. Although the biological function of bL33 remains

 obscure39, it appears to contact tRNAs in the ribosomal E(exit)-
site40 (Supplementary Fig. 3b), whereas bL31, similar to HPF,
plays a role in 100S formation, 70S association, and translation41.
As in the case of bS21, viral contigs encoding bL31 or bL33 were
almost exclusively detected in aquatic environments (Fig. 2).
Maximum likelihood phylogenies and genome context compar-
isons highlighted a consistent pattern of at least two independent
events of virus-host transfers involving viruses infecting different
bacterial phyla (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11).
Thus, at this point, there is an emerging picture that ribosomal
protein genes acquired through random sampling of host DNA
might, in some cases, become fixed in viral genomes. Most
(>99%) of the viruses contained only a single ribosomal protein
gene (exception: 8 uncultivated viral contigs that contained 2;
Supplementary Fig. 12), which is clearly not enough for viruses to
build functional ribosomes on their own. Presumably, these
viruses are merely tweaking ribosomal functioning in their hosts
—just as observed for auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) whereby
viruses typically do not encode complete pathways, but instead
only select genes critical for the takeover and/or reprogramming
of the host cell6,7,42.
RP-encoding genes are carried by temperate and lytic viruses.
Given that tRNA genes are more frequently encoded by lytic, as
opposed to temperate, viruses15, we sought to evaluate whether
the acquisition and maintenance of RP-encoding genes is also
linked to either the lytic or temperate life-style. Among the 16
RP-encoding cultivated viruses only FBR-MuSV and Myco-
bacterium phage 32HC are temperate (see Methods). Specifically,
FBR-MuSV, like all retroviruses, integrates into the cellular gen-
ome as an essential step during replication, whereas phage 32HC
encodes a tyrosine recombinase (YP_009009518) predicted to
integrate the viral genome into a host tRNA gene43. For the
majority of RP genes encoded by uncultivated viruses there is not
enough genomic data to ascertain their preferential association
with either temperate or lytic viruses (73% are partial genomes
<20 kb). Of 1396 uncultivated virus genome fragments, only 14
were detectably temperate, although these putative temperate
viruses encoded 9 of the 13 virus-encoded RPs (Supplementary
Table 3). Notably, the bS21 genes appear to be largely encoded by
lytic viruses: of the 1310 genomes and large genomic contigs of
cultivated and uncultivated viruses encoding bS21, only three
(0.23%) genome fragments carry signature genes of temperate
viruses (Supplementary Table 3). These results suggest that RP-
encoding genes can be acquired by both temperate and lytic
viruses, with some of the genes possibly displaying preferential
association with lytic viruses. However, additional genomic data
will be required to quantitatively assess the dynamics of the RP
gene flow between hosts, temperate viruses, and lytic viruses.
Virus-encoded RP genes are under strong purifying selection.
Presence of ribosomal protein genes in viral genomes raises a
question of what their functions in the course of the infection
cycle might be and how do viruses benefit from carrying such
genes. The eS30-encoding gene increases the transformation
capacity of FBR-MuSV in vitro by twofold, providing clear fitness
advantage to the virus30. It is conceivable that homologs of other
ribosomal proteins might be also beneficial for the bacteriophages
that encode them. For instance, it is known that bS21 is necessary
during translation initiation step and in the absence of bS21,
ribosomes are incapable of binding natural mRNAs32. Thus,
phage-encoded bS21 might compete with and replace the cellular
bS21, ensuring translation of viral transcripts. Similarly, viral
bL12 domain proteins might provide interfaces for virus-specific
translation factors. Protein bL9 is required for translational
fidelity and is involved in suppression of frameshifting. In many
members of Caudovirales, production of certain tail components
is dependent on programmed translational frameshifting44 and a
viral copy of bL9 might help to achieve optimal frameshifting in
these genes. Finally, it has been demonstrated that stalling of
phage protein synthesis is one of the major defense strategies in
Bacteroidetes45. Thus, viral homologs of HPF and bL31 might
compete with the cellular homologs and prevent formation of
ribosome dimers, thereby releasing translation inhibition and
ensuring that phage transcripts are efficiently translated.
Given what seemed to be reasonable explanations for why
viruses might benefit from encoding such genes, we next
investigated whether virus-encoded RP genes appeared to be
functional. To this end, we calculated the ratio of non-
synonymous polymorphisms per non-synonymous site (pN) to
the number of synonymous polymorphisms per synonymous site
(pS). Here we used this metric to test if virus-encoded RPs were
under purifying or positive selection, where the former (pN/pS
<1) would indicate selection for a functional protein and the latter
(pN/pS > 1) would indicate that the gene might be in the process
of being phased out from the viral genome46. We found that well-
sampled viral-encoded RP genes (>10× coverage, and ≥1 single
nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP) had an average pN/pS = 0.10,
with 84% having a pN/pS ≤ 0.20 (Supplementary Table 2). This
suggests that these genes are under strong purifying selection and
thus likely retained an important function after being transferred
into virus genomes.
Virus-encoded RPs are incorporated into ribosomes. Although
encouraging, the results of these in silico functional assays did
not exclude the possibility that the viral RPs function in a
different framework compared to their bona fide cellular
homologs. Thus, we next explored whether the viral proteins
are incorporated into ribosomes, by focusing on 3 RPs encoded
by cultivated phages and most frequently detected in unculti-
vated phage genomes (Fig. 2). These were pelagiphage-encoded
bS21, bL12 from Salmonella phage FSL SP-076, and HPF from
Escherichia coli phage rv5. Following moderate and controlled
expression of the respective viral proteins, 70S ribosomes were
isolated under high-stringency salt conditions (see Methods) to
avoid unspecific association of viral proteins47. Judging from
the obtained ribosome profiles (Fig. 4a) and transmission
electron microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 13), expression of the
viral proteins did not affect the 70S stability. All examined

 samples nearly exclusively contained 70S monoribosomes and
a small portion of 100S particles (Fig. 4a). Subsequent mass
spectrometry (MS) analysis of the 70S and 100S ribosomes
purified on sucrose gradients unequivocally showed that bS21
and bL12 (Table 2, Supplementary Data 2 and 3), but not HPF
(Supplementary Data 4), were stably incorporated into the
ribosomes when expressed in E. coli. Consistently, there was no
discernible effect on the formation of 100S particles in cells
expressing the viral HPF homolog (Fig. 4a). Notably, HPF was
detected using MS in the crude cell extracts (Table 2, Supple-
mentary Data 5), indicating that lack of its incorporation into
ribosomes is not due to poor protein expression, but may
rather result from other factors, such as inadequate growth
phase, genuine loss of ability to bind to ribosomes or dis-
sociation due to stringent washes with salt during ribosome
isolation.

 In order to check whether the incorporation of virus-encoded
ribosomal proteins alters bacterial translation, we next proceeded
to purification of ribosomes carrying bS21 and bL12 viral
proteins.
Towards
this
aim,
we
overproduced
the
two
streptavidin-tagged viral ribosomal proteins in E. coli and the
ribosomes containing the tagged viral proteins were purified by
affinity. Only ribosomes containing bS21 could be purified,
suggesting that the tagged bL12 cannot be efficiently incorporated
or that its interaction with the ribosome is not sufficiently strong
to allow the purification. The presence of the viral bS21 within the
ribosomes was confirmed by MS analysis. The activity of the
purified ribosomes was then verified by an in vitro translation
assay. The protein synthesis is severely impaired in the presence
of viral bS21 (~5% compared to wild-type ribosomes; Fig. 4b).
This impairment is not due to the presence of the affinity tag,
because ribosomes containing the streptavidin-tagged E. coli bS21
were still active (~75% compared to wild-type ribosomes; Fig. 4b).
The inactivity of ribosomes carrying the viral bS21 suggests that
additional virus- or host-encoded factors may be needed for
proper translation or that the RP from a phage infecting
Pelagibacter ubique may not be fully compatible with E. coli
ribosomes.
Regardless, these results indicate that following their transfer
into viral genomes, bS21 and bL12 retained the ability to
incorporate into ribosomes, successfully competing with the
native cellular counterparts. Whether incorporation of these and
other viral RPs modulates protein translation during phage
infection remains to be demonstrated by further functional assays
both with heterologously expressed RPs as well as in the
framework of the infection with the corresponding phages.
Discussion
The evolution of life is a history of virus-host interactions, an
incessant “arms race” between viruses and cells48,49. To ensure
their successful proliferation, both parties have evolved numerous
molecular strategies which are continuously being uncovered.
Among the most remarkable recent discoveries are various
defense and counter-defense mechanisms9, peptide-based com-
munication strategies employed by bacterial viruses to alternate

 between the lytic and lysogenic life cycles50, as well as virus-
mediated manipulation of the behavior and reproductive strate-
gies of the hosts51,52. Horizontal gene transfer plays a key role in
these processes, with many, if not all, molecular innovations
being shuttled back and forth between viruses and cells, irre-
spective of who the original inventor was53. Indeed, even such
hallmark virus components as the major virion proteins have
been recurrently exapted from cellular proteomes and occasion-
ally reintroduced to perform diverse cellular functions54. Simi-
larly, numerous AMGs have been recruited by viruses from their
hosts, enabling viral manipulation of various cellular pathways,
and transforming the infected cell into a specialized virion fac-
tory. Genes for the core components of translation machinery,
namely RPs, until now appeared as the last unbreached boundary
between the cellular and viral kingdoms, despite the fact that
certain viruses were known to tinker with protein translation by
encoding tRNA genes, protein deformylases or tRNA synthetases.
Our current work shows that diverse ribosomal proteins are in
fact commonly encoded by numerous cultivated and uncultivated
viruses with relatively small genomes and offers support for them
having an evolutionary fitness advantage for viruses during
infection. Notably, virus-encoded RPs appear to be differentially
selected for across environments as aquatic viruses are enriched
for bS21, bL31, and bL33, whereas phages of animal-associated
bacteria are enriched for bS6, uS9, uS15, and HPF (Fig. 2).
Although ribosomes are highly stable macromolecular assemblies
which retain most of their original components during cellular
growth and division55, some elements (proteins bS21, bL12, bL9,
bL31, and bL33) are highly dynamic, solvent accessible, and
among the few proteins that are loosely bound to the ribosome
and can be exchanged in vivo between ribosomes55,56. These
dynamic ribosomal proteins are enriched in viruses, presumably
because they are most suited to homologous replacement during
infection. Just as in ocean virus AMGs, it appears that viruses co-
opt and fix not all enzymes in a metabolic pathway, but instead
only central regulators or enzymes for key rate-limiting steps in a
pathway6,8,57. More generally, such selective acquisition of key
components of the multisubunit assemblies, such as ribosomes, or
recruitment of central regulators of rate-limiting steps in meta-
bolic pathways appears to be a general strategy employed by
viruses to optimize the metabolic state of the infected cells and/or
to achieve the takeover of the host. Together, these functional and
computational findings highlight widespread means by which
viruses might modulate translation upon infection and either call
into question a commonly used definition for life—the presence/
absence of RPs—or further blur the borders between viruses and
cellular life forms. Given that viral metagenomics becomes a
major approach in virus discovery58 with new RNA and DNA
virus genomes and large genome fragments being discovered by
the thousands to tens of thousands8,38,59,60, we are most certainly
bound to discover many more new strategies of host take-over in
the near future.
Methods
Sequence analyses. All viral genomes were downloaded from viral RefSeq data-
base (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/). A hidden Markov model
(HMM) profile was downloaded from the PFAM database (http://pfam.xfam.org/)
for each domain listed in Supplementary Table 1. In total, 106 sequence profiles
corresponding to distinct ribosomal protein domains were used as seeds to search
the proteomes of viruses infecting hosts from the three cellular domains, as well as
proteins predicted on viral contigs from two previously published global metage-
nomic datasets, Global Ocean Virome8, and Earth’s Virome38, which are available
at https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/vr/main.cgi and http://datacommons.cyverse.org/
browse/iplant/home/shared/iVirus/GOV. Notably, domain S1, which is repeated 4
to 6 times in the ribosomal protein bS1, is not exclusive to RPs as it is common
across diverse RNA-binding proteins and fused to non-ribosomal functional motifs
(pfam id: PF00575.18). Thus while domain S1 was found in homologs of vaccinia
virus interferon inhibitor K3L61, which is conserved in chordopoxviruses belonging
to 7 different genera, it was not considered further due to potential functional
ambiguity. The domains were identified by HHsearch62 with E-value of 1e-5. For
isolates, the identified hits were then manually inspected using HHPRED62. All
alignments were constructed using PROMALS3D63. Maximum likelihood phylo-
genetic trees were constructed using PhyML64 using a WAG substitution model
and the proportion of invariable sites estimated from the data. For metagenomic
predicted proteins, multiple alignments were built with Muscle65 and maximum
likelihood phylogenetic trees were computed with FastTree66, and displayed with
iToL67. Genomic comparisons were performed using BLAST with the BLOSUM45
matrix. The ribosomal structure was downloaded from PDB database and visua-
lized using Chimera68.
Putative temperate phages were identified by searching for the following PFAM
domains in ribosomal protein-encoding viral contigs: Mu-transpos_C,
Phage_int_SAM_5, and Phage_integrase (hmmsearch, threshold of 30 on bit
score). Host predictions for viral metagenomic contig were obtained from the
original studies (i.e., ref. 8 and 38) and, in the case of the Earth’s virome38,
complemented with a k-mer based prediction computed with WIsH69 (p-value
threshold of 0.001).
To further confirm the functionality of RPs encoded on uncultivated viral
genomes, selective constraint on these AMGs was evaluated through pN/pS
calculation, as in ref. 46. Briefly, synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs were
observed in each ribosomal protein gene covered ≥10 × , and compared to expected
ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs under a neutral evolution model
if at least 1 SNP was identified. The interpretation of pN/pS is similar as for dN/dS
analyses, with the operation of purifying selection leading to pN/pS values <1.
Genetic constructions. The genes encoding for bS21 protein from Pelagibacter
phage HTVC008M (AGE60443), HPF protein from Escherichia coli bacteriophage
rv5 and bL12 protein from Salmonella phage FSL SP-076 (AGF88397) were syn-
thetized by Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). bS21 and HPF genes were
cloned into pEX-A2 plasmid and bL12 gene into pEX-K4 plasmid. The gene
corresponding to HPF viral protein was digested by BsaI and HindIII and inserted
into a pBAD24 vector between NcoI and HindIII restriction sites. The genes
corresponding to bS21 and bL12 viral proteins were cloned into the same vector,
using EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The C-terminal streptavidin-tagged
versions of bS21 genes from Pelagibacter phage and E. coli were also synthetized
and cloned into pBAD24 plasmids. The pBAD24 plasmid harbors an arabinose
dependent promoter, a pBR322 origin and the ampicillin resistance coding
sequence.
Protein expression and cell retrieval. Escherichia coli strain NM522 was used for
expression of viral bS21, HPF, and bL12 proteins. The same strain harboring empty
pBAD24 was used as a negative control. Overnight pre-cultures were grown in the
presence of 1 mM of L-arabinose and 100 µg/mL of ampicillin. Then the expression
was maintained in the cell culture until the end of exponential phase. Once the
cultures reached an OD600nm of 1, the cells were centrifuged at 8700× g for 7
minutes at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then washed into saline water at a con-
centration of 9 g/L of NaCl. A second centrifugation was made and the bacterial
pellet was frozen at −80 °C.
70S Ribosome purification. The E. coli cells were resuspended in Buffer 1 (Tris-
HCl pH7,5 20 mM,MgOAc 50 mM,NH4Cl 100 mM, EDTA 0.5 mM and DTT
1 mM) and finally lysed using the French Press. The lysate was centrifuged and the
supernatant was put above the same volume of high-salt sucrose buffer (Tris-HCl
pH7.5 10 mM, MgCl2 10 mM, NH4Cl 500 mM, EDTA 0.5 mM, certified RNase free
sucrose 1.1 M and DTT 1 mM) in order to wash the ribosomes. After centrifuga-
tion at 93,000× g for 20 h at 4 °C using Type 70 Ti rotor (BECKMAN L-90
ultracentrifuge), the ribosomes form a translucent pellet. The ribosome pellet was
washed several times to remove membranes and then resuspended in Buffer 2
(Tris-HCl pH7.5 10 mM, MgCl2 10 mM, NH4Cl 50 mM, EDTA 0.5 mM and DTT
1 mM) on ice. An equivalent of 200OD260nm units of ribosomes were loaded on top
of a 10–50% sucrose gradient into polycarbonate tubes. The ultra-centrifugation
was performed at 95,000× g, for 18 h at 4 °C using SW28 rotor (BECKMAN L-90
ultracentrifuge). The gradient was then fractionated into 500 µL aliquots. The
OD260nm values were determined for each fraction to locate the 70S absorbance
peak. The corresponding fractions were pooled in one volume of buffer 2 and
centrifuged at 93,000× g for 20 h at 4 °C using Type 70 Ti rotor in order to remove
sucrose. The pellet was recovered in buffer 2 and after titration, the ribosomes were
ready for mass spectrometry analysis or purification using StrepTrap™ HP columns
(GE healthcare) for in vitro translation assays.
The StrepTactin Sepharose column (StrepTrap™ HP columns, GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) was equilibrated with the buffer 3 (MgOAc 9 mM, NH4Cl 10 mM,
KCl 50 mM, HEPES-KOH pH7, 5 5 mM and DTT 1 mM). After injection of the
purified ribosomes, the column was washed with 100 mL of buffer 3 before elution
with 2.5 mM of d-Desthiobiotin. Fractions containing ribosomes were finally
concentrated (Amicon 30 kDa) and resuspended in the buffer 3 for in vitro
translation assays.

 In vitro translation assays. In vitro translation was performed using PUREx-
press® ΔRibosome Kit (New England Biolabs). Wild-type ribosomes (controls) or
eluted ribosomes carrying E. coli or virus-encoded tagged bS21 were tested (final
concentration: 10 pmol). A green fluorescent protein was translated by using a PCR
product containing T7 promoter to rapidly evaluate the translation rates.
Fluorescence analysis. After 3 h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction volume was
adjusted to 125 µL and distributed in cuvettes for Fluorescence measurement with
LS 55 Fluorescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer). Fluorescence intensity of trans-
lated GFP was determined using the FinLab software with following conditions: λ
excitation 485 nm/slit 10/photomultiplicator 775/λ emission 510 nm.
Negative staining. Following ribosome separation, we diluted samples 10 times in
Buffer 2 and applied them to freshly glow-discharged 300-mesh collodion/carbon-
coated grids. After three washes in this buffer, grids were stained with 2% uranyl
acetate for 30S. The grids were then observed with a Tecnai G2 Sphera trans-
mission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Images were recorded with a
4000 × 4000 Gatan Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera at a nominal magnification of
×50,000.
Liquid digestion of ribosomal samples. 25 µg of ribosomes were digested
according to the following protocol: first, 53.5 µl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
buffer (pH 7,8) was added to the sample to 65 µL total volume. After vortexing 1
minute, tubes were incubated 10 minutes at 80 °C and then sonicated for two
minutes. Reduction of disulfide bonds step was processed by adding 12.5 µl of 65
mM DTT to the sample and was incubated 15 minutes at 37 °C after agitation 1
minute. Alkylation of reduced disulfide bonds was realized by adding 135 mM
iodoacetamide. Microtube was then incubated 15 minutes in the dark at room
temperature, under agitation. Finally, proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C
with 10 µl of either modified endoproteinase glu-c ([0.1 µg/µl.], Promega, Madison,
WI) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer for bS21 (due to high lysine and
arginine content in bS21) or with modified Trypsine ([0.1 µg/µl.], Promega,
Madison, WI) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer for HPF, bL12 and control.
Protein prefractionation and digestion. Twenty five micrograms of soluble crude
protein extracts of E. coli were boiled for 10 min with 5 µl of LDS Sample buffer 4X
and 2 µl of reducing agent (DTT 10 × (500 mM)). They were then separated on a
NuPAGE® Novex® 4–12 % gradient Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen Corparation, USA) in
MES SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen: 50 mM MES, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 % SDS,
1.025 Mm EDTA) using Xcell SureLock Mini Cell (Invitrogen).
Gel was stained with EZBlue (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min and destained with
water overnight. Each gel lane was manually cut into 2 slices of approximately the
same size in the region of 7 kDa–14 kDa. The slices were first treated with 50 mM
NH4HCO3 in acetonitrile/water 1:1 (v/v), dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile and
rehydrated in 100 mM NH4HCO3. Next they were washed again with 50 mM
NH4HCO3 in acetonitrile/water, 1:1 (v/v) and dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile.
The slices were then treated with 65 mM DTT for 15 min at 37 °C, and with 135
mM iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature. Finally, the samples were
washed with 100 mM NH4HCO3 in acetonitrile/water, 1:1 (v/v), and dehydrated
with 100% acetonitrile before being rehydrated in 100 mM NH4HCO3, washed
with 100 mM NH4HCO3 in acetonitrile/water, 1:1 (v/v) and then dehydrated again
with 100% acetonitrile. Proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C with 4 ng/l of
modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 mM NH4HCO3. Peptides were
extracted by incubating the slices first in 80 µl of acetonitrile/ water/trifluoroacetic
acid (70/30/0.1; v/v/v) for 20 min, and then in 40 µl of 100% acetonitrile for 5 min
and finally in 40 µl of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (70/30/0.1; v/v/v) for
15 min. Supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and concentrated in a
SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific) for 15 min to a final volume of 40 µl.
LC-MS/MS analysis. Shotgun analyses were conducted on a LTQ-Orbitrap XL
(ThermoFisher Scientific) mass spectrometer. The MS measurements were done
with a nanoflow highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Dionex,
LC Packings Ultimate 3000) connected to a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (New Objective).
The HPLC system consisted of a solvent degasser nanoflow pump, a thermostated
column oven kept at 30 °C, and a thermostated autosampler kept at 8 °C to reduce
sample evaporation. Mobile A (99.9% Milli-Q water and 0.1% formic acid (v:v))
and B (99.9% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid (v:v)) phases for HPLC were
delivered by the Ultimate 3000 nanoflow LC system (Dionex, LC Packings). An
aliquot of 10 μL of prepared peptide mixture was loaded onto a trapping pre-
column (5 mm × 300 μm i.d., 300 Å pore size, Pepmap C18, 5 μm) over 3 min in 2%
buffer B at a flow rate of 25 μL/min. This step was followed by reverse-phase
separations at a flow rate of 0.250 μL/min using an analytical column (15 cm × 300
μm i.d., 300 Å pore size, Pepmap C18, 5 μm, Dionex, LC Packings). We ran a
gradient from 2−35% buffer B for the first 60 min, 35−60% buffer B from minutes
60−85, and 60−90% buffer B from minutes 85−105. Finally, the column was
washed with 90% buffer B for 16 min and with 2% buffer B for 19 min before the
next sample was loaded. The peptides were detected by directly eluting them from
the HPLC column into the electrospray ion source of the mass spectrometer. An
electrospray ionization (ESI) voltage of 1.6 kV was applied to the HPLC buffer
using the liquid junction provided by the nanoelectrospray ion source, and the ion
transfer tube temperature was set to 200 °C. The LTQ-Orbitrap XL instrument was
operated in its data-dependent mode by automatically switching between full
survey scan MS and consecutive MS/MS acquisitions. Survey full scan MS spectra
(mass range 400−2000) were acquired in the Orbitrap section of the instrument
with a resolution of r = 60 000 at m/z 400; ion injection times were calculated for
each spectrum to allow for accumulation of 106 ions in the Orbitrap. The ten most
intense peptide ions in each survey scan with an intensity above 2000 counts (to
avoid triggering fragmentation too early during the peptide elution profile) and a
charge state ≥2 were sequentially isolated at a target value of 10,000 and frag-
mented in the linear ion trap by collision-induced dissociation. Normalized colli-
sion energy was set to 35% with an activation time of 30 ms. Peaks selected for
fragmentation were automatically put on a dynamic exclusion list for 30S with a
mass tolerance of ± 10 ppm to avoid selecting the same ion for fragmentation more
than once. The following parameters were used: the repeat count was set to 1, the
exclusion list size limit was 500, singly charged precursors were rejected, and the
maximum injection time was set at 500 and 300 ms for full MS and MS/MS scan
events, respectively. For an optimal duty cycle, the fragment ion spectra were
recorded in the LTQ mass spectrometer in parallel with the Orbitrap full scan
detection.
For Orbitrap measurements, an external calibration was used before each
injection series ensuring an overall error mass accuracy below 5 ppm for the
detected peptides. MS data were saved in RAW file format (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) using XCalibur 2.0.7 with tune 2.4. The data analysis was performed
with Proline software 1.4 supported by Mascot Distiller and Mascot server
(v2.5.1; http://www.matrixscience.com) database search engine for peptide and
protein identification using its automatic decoy database search to calculate a
false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% at the peptide level. MS/MS spectra were
compared to the Escherichia coli Reference proteome set database containing
the phage ribosomal proteins (UniProt release 2017_01, 18 January 2017,
23022 sequences, 7070297 residues). Mass tolerance for MS and MS/MS was
set at 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. The enzyme selectivity was set to full
trypsin with one miscleavage allowed for samples HPF and bL12 and the
enzyme selectivity was set to full V8-DE with one miscleavage allowed for
sample bS21.
Protein modifications were fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteines, variable
oxidation of methionine, variable acetylation of lysine, and variable acetylation of
N-terminal residues.
