Abstract
Aims—Neurogenesis in the postnatal human brain occurs in two neurogenic niches; the 
subventricular zone (SVZ) in the wall of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the 
hippocampus (SGZ). The extent to which this physiological process continues into adulthood is an 
area of ongoing research. This study aimed to characterise markers of cell proliferation and assess 
the efficacy of antibodies used to identify neurogenesis in both neurogenic niches of the human 
brain.
Methods—Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were simultaneously examined in the SVZ and 
SGZ of 23 individuals aged 0.2–59 years using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence 
in combination with unbiased stereology.
Results—There was a marked decline in proliferating cells in both neurogenic niches in early 
infancy with levels reaching those seen in the adjacent parenchyma by four and one year of age, in 
the SVZ and SGZ, respectively. Furthermore, the phenotype of these proliferating cells in both 
niches changed with age. In infants, proliferating cells co-expressed neural progenitor (epidermal 
growth factor receptor), immature neuronal (doublecortin and beta III tubulin) and 
oligodendrocytic (Olig2) markers. However, after three years of age, microglia were the only 
proliferating cells found in either niche or in the adjacent parenchyma.
Conclusions—This study demonstrates a marked decline in neurogenesis in both neurogenic 
niches in early childhood, and that the sparse proliferating cells in the adult brain are largely 
microglia.

 Introduction
It has been proposed that enhancement of endogenous neurogenesis using pharmaceutical or 
environmental measures could be an effective therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative 
diseases [1, 2]. The ultimate success of these efforts would appear to be predicated on there 
being sufficient levels of neurogenesis in the aged human brain to respond to manipulation. 
The prolificity of adult neurogenesis in all mammals declines with age [3] although the 
timing of this and the extent to which it occurs in the human brain remains the subject of 
considerable debate.
There are two major neurogenic niches in the adult human brain, the subventricular zone 
(SVZ) underlying the wall of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the 
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In both niches, pluripotent neural stem cells give rise to 
transit amplifier cells that differentiate into neuroblasts, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte 
precursor cells [3]. Studies in various lower mammals have shown that neuroblasts from the 
SVZ migrate, via the rostral migratory stream (RMS), and integrate as interneurons into the 
granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb where they are thought to modulate olfactory learning 
and performance [4, 5]. In contrast, neuroblasts from the SGZ migrate a short distance to the 
adjacent granule cell layer (GCL) [6] where survivors are thought to facilitate the temporal 
separation of spatial memories [7].
In pioneering work Curtis and colleagues used immunohistochemistry to identify the 
endogenous proliferation marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), to demonstrate 
the presence of a functional RMS in humans [8]. In contrast, Sanai and colleagues used an 
alternative proliferation marker, Ki67 and the immature neuronal marker doublecortin 
(DCX) [9] to show that SVZ neurogenesis and migration along the RMS ceased by two 
years of age [10]. Knoth and colleagues used DCX and PCNA to demonstrate residual 
neurogenesis in the SGZ in adults up to 100 years of age [11]. To our knowledge no study 
has explored proliferation in the human SGZ using Ki67 across a wide age range.
More recently an alternative methodology, radioactive carbon dating of neuronal DNA, has 
shown numerous adult-born neurons in the adult human hippocampus [12] and the SVZ 
[13], although the neuroblasts produced by the latter appear to migrate into the adjacent 
caudate nucleus [13] rather than entering the olfactory bulb via the RMS [14]. One of the 
major advantages of this technique is that unambiguous confirmation of proliferating cell 
fate can be confirmed using mature cell markers such as the neuronal marker, NeuN. 
However the technique is limited to one or two specialist laboratories, worldwide.
Notwithstanding the contribution of radioactive carbon dating to this area, 
immunohistochemistry remains a much more accessible technique, although findings to date 
on the extent of adult neurogenesis have been marker-dependent. In an attempt to clarify the 
true extent of neurogenesis in both niches of the human brain we have compared and 
contrasted Ki67, PCNA and DCX immunostaining of postmortem tissue across a range of 
ages.

 Materials and methods
Cases
This project was conducted following approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee 
of the University of Sydney (HREC #13027). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
sections of the wall of the lateral ventricle and adjacent head of the caudate nucleus (CN) at 
the level of nucleus accumbens, and the hippocampus at the level of the lateral geniculate 
nucleus, were obtained from neurologically normal subjects (0.2 – 59 years; n = 23) (Table 
1). Additional sections from the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were also obtained from the 
three eldest adults (Table 1 #21 – 23). Tissue from eight individuals ≥ 24 years (adult) was 
obtained from the New South Wales Brain Tissue Resource Centre (NSW BTRC). Tissue 
from 15 individuals ≤16 years (juvenile), including 11 ≤4 years (infant), were obtained from 
the NSW Department of Forensic Medicine. Adult and juvenile tissues were fixed in 15 and 
20% formalin, respectively, for 2–3 weeks, followed by paraffin embedding. NSW BTRC 
provided information on age, gender, postmortem interval (PMI), cause of death, brain pH, 
alcohol intake and liver pathology. Only age, PMI, gender and the cause of death were 
available for the remainder of cases (Table 1).
Immunohistochemistry
7μm FFPE sections were dewaxed through graded alcohols prior to antigen retrieval and 
immunostaining. Antigen retrieval was performed in a decloaking chamber (BioCare 
medical DC2002, Concord, USA) for 30 minutes at 95°C using 10 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA 
buffer pH 9.0. A higher maximum temperature of 110°C was necessary for antigen retrieval 
for Ki67 due to its greater susceptibility to the effects of fixation [15]. Sections were washed 
in 0.05M Tris/0.015M NaCl/0.05% Tween-20 (TBST, pH 7.4) and incubated for 10 minutes 
in 3% H2O2 in methanol, followed by 15 minutes in 10% normal horse serum (NHS) before 
overnight incubation with the following primary antibodies at 4°C: Ki67 (Clone MIB-1; 
mouse monoclonal, 1:500; M7240, Dako, Denmark), doublecortin (DCX; goat polyclonal, 
1:500, sc-8066, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California) or PCNA (Clone PC10, mouse 
monoclonal, 1:500, sc-56, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary and secondary antibodies 
were diluted in 1% NHS prepared in TBST. The slides were incubated in the secondary 
antibody (1:200; biotinylated anti-mouse BA-2000 and biotinylated anti-rabbit BA-1000, 
Vector Laboratories, Meadowbrook, Queensland) for 30 minutes, then with an avidin-biotin-
peroxidase complex (1:100; PK-6100, Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes. Negative 
controls, omitting the primary or secondary antibody, were run concurrently for all 
antibodies. Visualisation was with DAB in 5% H2O2 for 2–3 minutes followed by 
hematoxylin counterstaining.
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence co-localisation studies with cell specific markers were performed using 
the same antigen retrieval protocol outlined above. Sections were then washed in 0.01M 
phosphate buffered saline (Bioline, Alexandria, Australia) with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), 
blocked for 20 minutes in 10% NHS and incubated overnight at 4°C in a primary antibody 
cocktail containing up to three antibodies raised in different species including: Ki67; DCX; 
PCNA; beta III tubulin (rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, ab18207, Abcam, Waterloo, NSW),

 ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000; 019-19741, 
Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, rabbit 
polyclonal, 1:200; Z0334, Dako, Denmark), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, rabbit 
monoclonal, 1:200; 04-338, Merck Millipore, Billerica, USA) and oligodendrocyte lineage 
transcription factor 2 (Olig2, clone ERP2673 1:200; ab109186, Abcam). The sections were 
protected from UV light and incubated in a secondary antibody cocktail (1:200: AlexaFluor 
488, donkey anti-goat IgG, A10055; AlexaFluor 568, donkey anti-mouse IgG, A10037; 
AlexaFluor 647, donkey anti-rabbit IgG, A31573) for 30 minutes. Tissue autofluorescence 
was quenched using 0.1% Sudan black B (B.D.H Laboratory Chemicals Group, United 
Kingdom) in 70% ethanol for 4 minutes. Sections were then cover slipped using ProLong® 
Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (P36935, Life Technologies, Mulgrave, Victoria) and left 
for 24 hours at room temperature, sealed with nail polish and stored at 4°C. Images were 
then obtained using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 META Spectral microscope) at 
the Advanced Microscope Facility of the Bosch Institute (University of Sydney).
Stereological quantification
Ki67+, DCX+ and PCNA+ cells were counted within the entire SVZ and SGZ of each 
section using an Olympus BX53 microscope equipped with StereoInvestigator (v5.65). The 
SVZ was defined as the tissue extending from the ependymal layer (layer I) to the medial 
margin of the head of the CN which is delineated by a distinct myelin layer (layer IV) [16, 
17]. Accordingly, all immunopositive cells in the SVZ were counted within the hypocellular 
layer (layer II) and the adjacent layer containing a ribbon of astrocyte cell bodies (layer III) 
[17] (Fig. S1A). As newborn neurons can migrate across the width of the GCL, the SGZ was 
arbitrarily defined as extending from the junction of the GCL and the molecular layer to the 
boundary between the polymorphic layer and the CA4 subregion of the hippocampus (the 
latter defined by the presence of pyramidal neurons) (Fig. S1B). The “Meander Scan” 
function was used at 40x magnification and immunopositive cells were recorded manually at 
each scan site. After the meander scan had sampled the entire area of interest, the area 
scanned and the total number of immunopositive cells counted were recorded and cell 
density calculated (cells/mm2).
Ki67+ cells were also counted in the SFG of three neurologically normal adults using 
unbiased stereology. Cortical ribbons were outlined using a 4x objective and then randomly 
sampled using the optical dissector probe function of the software. Counts were then 
performed at 40x magnification with a meander sampling rate of 1% and a counting frame 
of 22,500 μm2.
Images of the proximal RMS were obtained using a slide scanning microscope (Zeiss Axio 
Scan.Z1, Gena, Germany). Using Zen imaging software (v1.1.2.0, 2012 Blue Edition, Gena, 
Germany) the RMS was outlined prior to scanning and images, taken at 100x magnification, 
stitched together and exported.
Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to phenotype Ki67+ cells throughout the SVZ 
and SGZ of seven individuals (six juveniles including five infants). Neurogenic events were 
explored by triple staining with Ki67 and DCX and either EGFR (a putative transit amplifier 
cell marker) [18] or beta III tubulin (an immature neuronal marker) [19]. To determine the

 overall composition of proliferating cells, sections were triple-stained with Ki67, DCX and 
either GFAP (a mature astrocyte marker [20, 21], Iba1 (microglial marker) [22, 23] or Olig2 
(an oligodendrocytic lineage marker) [24, 25]. Fluorescent images were imported using 
LSM Image Browser v3.5 (Zeiss) and Ki67+ cells were scored as positive or negative for 
DCX and the cell-specific markers by an investigator blinded to case status (CD).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software package GraphPad Prism 6 
(v6.0d, GraphPad Software, Inc. 2013). Juvenile versus adult group differences were 
assessed using a Student’s t-test. A ratio-paired t-test was used to compare the relative 
densities of markers across all individuals. The relationships between markers and age were 
evaluated by Pearson correlation. The level of significance was chosen at p = 0.05 for all 
tests.
Results
Baseline proliferation in the adult human brain
The baseline level of cell proliferation in the adult brain outside the neurogenic niches was 
determined by counting Ki67+ cells in the SFG and the CN of three adults. Ki67+ cells were 
identified in all cases (mean density 2.9 ± 2.1 cells/mm2) and our previous work has shown 
these cells to be almost exclusively microglia [23]. No DCX+ cells were identified in the 
CN.
Markers of proliferation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone
Ki67+ cells, exclusively with nuclear staining, were distributed uniformly along the SVZ at 
all ages (Fig. 1A, C, E, G). DCX+ cells were distributed unevenly along the SVZ, often 
present as aggregates (Fig. 1B and D). DCX staining varied with age, being somatic 
(perinuclear), dendritic (processes) or a combination of both in individuals ≤ 4 years of age, 
predominantly somatic in 7–16 year olds (Fig. 1B, D, F) and absent in individuals older than 
16 (Fig. 1H).
PCNA+ cells were distributed uniformly along the SVZ in all individuals. Staining was 
nuclear but varied considerably in intensity. PCNA staining of ependymal cell nuclei, more 
intense in adults, was seen in all cases. There was no staining of ependymal cells with either 
Ki67 or DCX (Fig. S2).
Proliferating cells in the human subventricular zone decline with age
There was a marked decrease in cell proliferation in the infant SVZ (Fig. 1). The density of 
Ki67+ cells decreased dramatically over the first year of life and by four years of age was 
similar to the density in adult SFG and CN (2.6 cells/mm2) (Fig. S3).
Similarly, the density and total number of DCX+ cells in the SVZ declined with age. DCX+ 
cell density declined from 234.1 cells/mm2 in the youngest individuals (0.2 year-old) to 4.6 
cells/mm2 in the 16 year old, although the highest density was seen in a three year-old

 (391.2 cells/mm2). DCX+ cells were not identified in individuals older than 16 years (Fig. 
S3).
There was a positive correlation between Ki67+ and DCX+ cell densities in the juvenile SVZ 
(r2 = 0.39; p = 0.014) with DCX+ cells exceeding Ki67+ cells in 13/15 cases (mean = 2.6 
fold; 95% CI = 1.7 – 4.2)(Fig. S3).
The density of PCNA+ cells was greater than the density of Ki67+ cells in juvenile cases 
(mean = 3.9 fold; 95% CI = 1.8–8.5, p = 0.002). However, unlike Ki67+ and DCX+ cells, the 
PCNA+ cell density did not correlate with age (Fig. S3). The density of PCNA+ cells in 
adults (mean = 421.3 ± 121.1, range 0.76–799.3 cells/mm2, n = 8) was significantly higher 
than in juveniles (mean = 124.3 ± 26.0, range = 14.7–327.0 cells/mm2, n = 15, p = 0.005).
The phenotype of proliferating cells in the SVZ changes with age
Ki67+ cells in the juvenile SVZ (n = 6; Table 1) variably co-labelled with DCX (Fig. 2), beta 
III tubulin (Fig. 2A–D), EGFR (Fig. 2E–H), Olig2 (Fig. 2I–L), and Iba1 (microglia) (Fig. 
2M–P) but not GFAP (astrocytes) (Fig. 2Q–T).
The phenotype of Ki67+ cells in the SVZ differed with age (Fig. 3). In the youngest 
individual examined by confocal microscopy (1 year) Ki67 co-localised with DCX (65%). 
Triple labelling showed that Ki67+/DCX+ cells could be further subdivided into Ki67+/
DCX+/EGFR+ (29%), Ki67+/DCX+/beta III tubulin+ (19%) and Ki67+/DCX+ only (17%) 
cells. Additionally, there were occasional Ki67+/DCX−/EGFR+ and Ki67+/DCX−/beta III 
tubulin+ cells. The remaining Ki67+ cells were either Olig2+ (20%) or Iba1+ (10%). In a 3.9 
year-old Ki67+ cells co-labelled with DCX, Olig2 or Iba1 but no Ki67+/DCX+/EGFR+ or 
Ki67+/DCX+/beta III tubulin+ cells were identified. No Ki67+/DCX+ cells were seen at 14 
years and older with all Ki67+ cells examined in the adult SVZ being Iba1+ (Fig. 3). Ki67+/
GFAP+ cells were not seen at any age.
Markers of proliferation and neurogenesis in the SGZ
In juvenile brains, Ki67+ cells were common within, but not confined to, the SGZ. Ki67+ 
cells were also found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the CA4 region of 
the hippocampus (Fig. 4A and C). Ki67+ cells were exceptionally rare in the adult SGZ and 
adjacent regions (Fig. 4E and G).
The distribution and staining pattern of DCX+ cells differed with age. In juveniles, DCX+ 
cells were densely clustered within the PML near the GCL border with either somatic, 
dendritic or a combination of somatic and dendritic staining (Fig. 4B and D). Clustered 
DCX+ cells were not present in cases over three years of age and only sparse DCX+ cells 
were seen in the older juveniles and adults (2/8; Fig. 4F and H). Similar to the SVZ, nuclear 
PCNA staining varied in intensity and was distributed uniformly across all areas of the 
dentate gyrus (Fig. S2).
Proliferating cells in the human SGZ decline with age
As noted in the SVZ, there was a dramatic decline in the density of Ki67+ cells in the SGZ 
during the first year of life. In a 0.2 and 0.3 year-old there were 17.9 and 20.6 cells/mm2,

 respectively. At one year of age, the mean density was 3.77 ± 1.39 cells/mm2 (n = 3), similar 
to the Ki67+ cell density in the adult SFG and CN (baseline levels) (p = 0.66; Fig. S4). 
Ki67+ cells were only present in 2/8 adult SGZ and their mean density (0.27 ± 0.18 
cells/mm2) was lower than in the adult SFG (2.6 cells/mm2; p = 0.006).
As in the SVZ, the density of DCX+ cells exceeded that of Ki67+ cells in the SGZ in 14/15 
juveniles (mean ratio = 18.0, 95% CI = 6.9 – 47.0). The density of both Ki67+ and DCX+ 
cells declined with age although the decline was more rapid for Ki67+. At one year of age, 
DCX+ cells were still numerous (mean = 255 ± 81 cells/mm2) but then either absent from, or 
very sparse in (n = 3, mean = 0.45 ± 0.30 cells/mm2), the eight adults examined (Fig. S4).
The phenotype of proliferating cells in the SGZ changes with age
In the six juveniles examined (n = 6, 1–14 years) Ki67+ cells in the SGZ variably co-
expressed DCX, EGFR (Fig. 5A–D), Olig2 (Fig. 5E–H) and Iba1 but not beta III tubulin 
(Fig. 5M–P) or GFAP (Fig. 5Q–T).
In younger individuals (1 and 1.5 years) the majority of Ki67+ cells co-expressed the transit-
amplifier cell marker, EGFR. Ki67+/DCX+ and Ki67+/Olig2+ cells were also seen in infants 
up to 3.9 years. Some Ki67+/DCX+ cells co-expressed Olig2 but none co-expressed beta III 
tubulin or EGFR. In contrast to the SVZ, where 10% of Ki67+ cells in juveniles co-
expressed Iba1, no Ki67+/Iba1+ cells were identified in the SGZ < 3.9 years of age. All 
Ki67+ cells in older individuals (14 and 54 year-olds) were Iba1+ (Fig. 6).
Comparison of Ki67 and DCX in the subventricular and subgranular zones
In all cases, Ki67+ cells were more numerous in the SVZ than in the SGZ, although the 
Ki67+ cell density varied considerably between cases. In the juvenile group, the average 
SVZ/SGZ density ratio was 9.7 (n = 13; 95% CI = 5.9–16.0). The two cases with no Ki67+ 
cells in the SGZ were excluded from this analysis. Since in adults, Ki67+ cells were only 
identified in the SGZ in 2/8 cases (37 and 54 year-olds) a meaningful density ratio between 
the two niches could not be determined.
Rostral migratory stream
In some individuals a RMS from the rostral extremity of the frontal horn of the lateral 
ventricle, could be identified by its distinctive SVZ-like cytoarchitecture (greater cellularity) 
and the presence of epdendymal islets [10, 26]. The RMS was bordered by the CN and genu 
of the corpus callosum (CC) (Fig. 7 and Fig. S5). Numerous Ki67+ and DCX+ cells were 
present throughout the RMS of the youngest individual (0.2 year-old; Fig. 7A, D) but were 
spatially distinct. DCX+ cells were seen more dorsomedially adjacent to the CC (Fig. 7A–C) 
while Ki67+ cells were largely localised to the ventrolateral aspect of the RMS adjacent to 
the head of the CN (Fig. 7D–E). In the 0.2 and one year-old approximately 15% of the 
DCX+ cells showed colocalisation with Ki67 (Fig. 7F, G). Similar to the SVZ, there was a 
dramatic decline in the number of DCX+ and Ki67+ cells in the RMS during the first year of 
life with only a single DCX+ cell and rare Ki67+ cells seen in older individuals. In all the 
adults examined (n = 8, 24–59 years) there was only one case (a 54 year-old) with a single 
DCX+ cell in the RMS (Fig. 7G) while the rare Ki67+ cells seen in the adult RMS co-

 localised with Iba1 (Fig. 7H). Ependymal islets were dispersed throughout the RMS at all 
ages. In individuals younger than 2.5 years there were DCX+ and Ki67+ cells (Fig. S5 D–F) 
both within (non-patent) and surrounding the islets.
In contrast to Ki67 and DCX, the majority of RMS cells in all cases including ependymal 
cells of the ependymal islets were immunopositive for PCNA (Fig. S5A–C). Furthermore, in 
the infant brains PCNA staining was at two distinct intensities, a small subgroup of intensely 
stained cells with a similar density and distribution to the Ki67+ cells, and the majority of 
PCNA+ cells, including ependymal cells, that were moderately stained (Fig. S5A, B). In 
older brains intensely staining PCNA+ cells were rare, paralleling the density and 
distribution of Ki67+ cells, while the moderately staining population remained (a 54 year-
old; Figure S5C).
Discussion
The potential benefits of therapeutically manipulating endogenous adult neurogenesis for 
patients with neurodegenerative diseases are immense. Both pharmaceutical and 
environmental manipulation has been shown to affect adult neurogenesis in many 
mammalian species but successful manipulation in humans is likely to depend on there 
being a sufficient level of neurogenesis at the ages that these diseases are prevalent.
We had previously shown that there was no difference in cell proliferation in the SVZ of 
chronic alcoholics compared to neurologically normal controls [16]. In that study, and in 
previous studies examining the human SVZ and RMS [8, 10] the density of proliferative 
events depended on whether PCNA or Ki67 was used as a marker. Far fewer proliferating 
cells are identified in studies using Ki67 but epitope retrieval from fixed human brain tissue 
is known to be more difficult than for PCNA [15]. In order to clarify the true state of cell 
proliferation in adult neurogenic niches, fixed postmortem human brain tissue from 
neurologically normal infants to middle-aged subjects were examined. DCX was also 
included as an immature neuronal marker whose expression should partially overlap with 
both proliferative markers and confirm neurogenesis. Our results show that the density of 
Ki67+, DCX+ and Ki67+/DCX+ cells in the SVZ and SGZ is high prior to four and one year 
of age, respectively but then decreases markedly with age. In the SVZ this replicates the 
results of Sanai and colleagues in juveniles up to 18 months of age [10]. Furthermore the 
pattern of DCX+ immunostaining in the SGZ of juveniles and adults in this study is 
remarkably similar to the exponential decrease with ageing described by Knoth and 
colleagues [11]. Again, consistent with our results, Knoth et al. demonstrated that there was 
no relationship between PCNA+ and DCX+ cell density across a wide range of ages.
PCNA+ cells were more frequent than Ki67+ cells both within and outside the neurogenic 
niches and PCNA also stained the nuclei of mature ependymal cells. This has been reported 
in other studies [16, 27–29] as has PCNA staining of mature leptomeningeal cells [30]. It is 
not clear whether staining in these non-proliferating cell populations is specific, specific but 
identifying a modified form of PCNA [31], or is non-specific, detecting a shared epitope on 
an unrelated protein. In the present study, non-specific ependymal staining due to cross 
reactivity with secondary anibodies was ruled out by the inclusion of a no primary antibody

 negative control. Furthermore the likelihood of non-specificity was somewhat mitigated by 
the PCNA immunostaining pattern being seen with multiple PCNA antibodies raised in 
different species and from different clones (data not shown). Unlike DCX and Ki67, the 
majority of cells within the adult RMS were PCNA immunopositive including the 
ependymal islet cells. However, in the infant RMS there was a combination of this adult 
pattern interspersed with a few intensely stained cells. These intensely stained cells 
resembled the Ki67 pattern of immunopositivity and may represent the true proliferative 
population.
If staining in the majority of PCNA+ cells is specific, then PCNA must serve a distinct 
function in mature cells. Roles in DNA repair or transcription have been suggested [32] and 
a recent study showed that there are two pools of PCNA in mammalian cells, one involved in 
replication and a second soluble nucleoplasmic pool of unknown function [33]. Our findings 
are consistent with PCNA antibodies labelling two pools of PCNA in the infant human SVZ 
and RMS, with only the non-proliferative pool remaining in the adult. Notwithstanding the 
need for further work to delineate the functional significance of moderate PCNA expression 
in the dentate gyrus, ependymal layer and adjacent areas, our results strongly suggests that 
PCNA-based IHC studies will overestimate proliferative events in human postmortem brain 
tissue.
Notwithstanding DCX immunostaining of human astrocytes [34] and mature murine 
neurons [35, 36], our findings in the SVZ and SGZ combined with those of Sanai et al. in 
the SVZ [10] suggest that within the confines of the neurogenic niches, the combination of 
DCX and Ki67 immunostaining gives an accurate depiction of adult neurogenesis. This 
conclusion is supported by studies that employed either Ki67 [37] or DCX [11] in the SGZ. 
These studies also reported changes in the subcellular location of DCX [11, 37]. Boekhoorn 
et al. suggested that somatic DCX staining was related to PMI [37], however Knoth and 
colleagues, having matched for PMI, considered that somatic staining identified the most 
immature progenitor cells, notwithstanding these cells being found throughout the GCL 
[11]. Similar to Knoth et al, we found that somatic DCX staining was identified throughout 
the GCL independent of the PMI.
Co-localisation studies enabled us to explore the changing cell phenotype in the SVZ and 
SGZ with age. In infants there was evidence of neurogenesis with transit-amplifier cells 
(Ki67+/DCX+/EGFR+ and Ki67+/DCX−/EGFR+) and neuroblasts (Ki67+/DCX+/beta III 
tubulin+) in both niches consistent with previous studies [3, 38, 39] as well as 
oligodendrogenesis with Ki67+/DCX+/−/Olig2+ cells [40]. GFAP was also expected to co-
localise with Ki67 in the neurogenic niches due to the likely presence of both the GFAP-δ+ 
type B (neural stem) cells [41] and newborn astrocytes [3]. The lack of co-localisation may 
be partially explained by a largely quiescent neural stem cell population at the ages we 
examined. In this respect, our findings agree with a previous study that demonstrated no 
Ki67+/GFAP-δ+ cells in the aged human (82 year-old) SVZ [42]. Whereas, the extent of 
ongoing astrogliogenesis in the adult human SVZ or SGZ, unlike in the rodent SVZ [43], is 
unknown.

 In terms of the RMS our results are consistent with previous studies that suggested that 
chains of migrating neuroblasts are not seen in the human RMS after 2 years of age [10]. 
They are also in agreement with studies using atmospheric radioactive carbon from nuclear 
weapon testing that showed no evidence of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb [13, 14]. 
Ernst et al. suggested that SVZ-derived neurons deviated into the adjacent CN rather than 
continuing along the RMS to the olfactory bulb in the adult human brain [13], although our 
current and previous work in alcoholic and normal brains [16, 23] found no evidence of 
migration of proliferative cells into the CN. One caveat with our characterisation of the RMS 
is that it relied on a single coronal section at the level of the CN. This contrasts with more 
extensive analyses undertaken previously [8, 10, 26] and our findings must be considered in 
this context. Nevertheless, the distinct spatial separation of the majority of Ki67+ and DCX+ 
cells in the infant RMS suggests that proliferation, including neurogenesis, may continue 
along the length of the RMS rather than being confined to the SVZ [26]. A proliferative 
RMS has been shown in other species [44], [45], [46] and provides an alternative 
explanation to the traditional view that a proportion of neuroblasts remain mitotically active 
for their entire journey along the RMS[8].
In contrast to our findings in the SGZ, Spalding and colleagues, using atmospheric 
radioactive carbon techniques, suggested that human SGZ neurogenesis continues 
throughout life [12]. These apparently discordant results may be explained, at least in part, 
by differences in sampling techniques. Firstly Spalding et al. homogenised the entire 
hippocampus, approximately 7cm long, from one side of each brain they studied, while most 
IHC studies typically examine 5–48 μm sections. Usng an independent stereological 
measurement of the neurogenic volume of the human hippocampus [47], Spalding et al.’s 
estimation of 700 new neurons per day would equate to 5.2 neurons/mm3/day. Now given 
that the half-life of DCX expression in the human SGZ is unknown, an extrapolation from 
rat data [48], suggests that 5.2 neurons/mm3/day would equate to approximately 150 DCX+ 
cells/mm3. This figure is comparable to the 90–150 DCX+ cells/mm3 (0.45 ± 0.30 cells/mm2 
or one DCX+ cell every 2 to 3 sections) found in the SGZ of 3/8 adults in the current study.
Therefore the results of SGZ studies utilising either exogenous markers such as 14C [12] and 
BrdU [11] or endogenous IHC markers, may well be in agreement. At issue is whether the 
generation of 700 new neurons a day or 0.004% of the total granule cell population [12] is 
functionally significant. This estimate by Spalding and colleagues is approximately 10-fold 
lower than for rats (0.03%) [49] and mice (0.06%)[50] but is comparable to macaques (0.004 
– 0.02%) [51, 52]. The marked differences between infants and adults in the current study 
suggests that in humans, the decline in neurogenesis with age is more rapid than in other 
mammals and that in adults, neurogenesis is functionally insignificant. Our conclusion is 
supported by a recent meta-analysis of hippocampal neurogenesis studies encompassing 
seven mammalian species, including humans, that suggested that age-related decline in 
humans is underestimated and that from middle age “neurogenesis occurs at relatively low, 
and perhaps negligible levels” [53].
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the differences in adult neurogenesis 
between humans and lower mammals. Ongoing neurogenesis in the adult SVZ may reflect 
the dominant role of olfaction in macro-osmic rodents [54] and sheep [55] compared with 
Dennis et al.

 micro-osmic primates [14, 56]. In the adult rodent SGZ neurogenesis may be necessary to 
erase ‘superfluous’ memories and ensure that the hippocampus remains receptive to new 
memories [7]. In infant humans, a similar process may be the basis of infantile amnesia [7]. 
Since, unlike lower mammals, primates including humans, do not rely on the hippocampus 
for remote memory recall or reconsolidation [57], functionally significant neurogenesis in 
the adult SGZ may be unnecessary.
Away from the SVZ and the SGZ, glial proliferation occurs at low levels even in healthy, 
adult human brains [58]. This has been largely attributed to oligodendrocyte precursor cell 
[59] and more recently, to microglia [23]. The rate of turnover of oligodendrocyte precursor 
cells in the adult human is unclear, in part due to the lack of a definitive marker. While NG2 
(Chondroitin Sulphate Proteoglycan 4) has been used [59], this antigen is extremely 
sensitive to fixation, precluding its use in FFPE tissue. Our results demonstrate that within 
the adult human SVZ and SGZ the vast majority of proliferating cells are microglia and the 
degree of proliferation is similar to that noted in the surrounding brain parenchyma [23]. 
Similarly, Doorn et al. demonstrated that microglia are the predominant proliferating cells in 
the adult hippocampus [60]
Conclusions
Although commonly used,, PCNA is not aspecific marker of proliferation in postmortem 
human brain tissue. A combination of Ki67 and DCX immunoreactivity demonstrates that in 
humans, the density of proliferating cells, and neuroblasts in particular, declines markedly 
with age in the SVZ and SGZ and by four years of age is no greater than in the adjacent 
parenchyma. Although this low level of neurogenesis in neurologically normal adult humans 
suggests that any further reduction is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pathogenesis 
of neurodegenerative diseases the reported increases in neurogenesis in patients with 
conditions such as of Huntington’s disease [27] and epilepsy [61] suggests that therapeutic 
intervention to augment neurogenesis may be possible.

 Fig. 1. Immunostaining of endogenous markers of proliferation and neurogenesis in the human 
SVZ
Representative photomicrographs showing differences in immunostaining for Ki67 (A, C, E 
and G) and DCX (B, D, F and H) with age. Immunostaining of the SVZ from a 0.3 year-old 
individual shows (A) numerous Ki67+ cells with a nuclear staining pattern and (B) clusters 
of DCX+ cells with a combination of somatic and dendritic staining. A similar pattern is 
shown in a 1.3 year-old individual for both Ki67 (C) and DCX (D). A 16 year-old individual 
shows (E) a single Ki67+ cell (black arrow) in the SVZ and (F) shows a single DCX+ cell 
(black arrow) with weak somatic staining. A 54 year-old individual shows (G) a single 
Ki67+ cell (black arrow) and (H) no DCX+ cells. 400x magnification. Scale bar = 50μm. 
Insets show digital enlargement of immunopositive cells.

 Fig. 2. Phenotype of proliferating cells in the juvenile SVZ
Confocal micrographs of the SVZ from a 1 year-old individual shows Ki67+ cells co-
localising with the immature neuronal marker beta III tubulin and the neuroblast marker 
DCX (A–D), the transit-amplifier marker EGFR (E–H), the oligodendrocytic marker Olig2 
(I–L), the microglial marker Iba1 (M–P) but not the astrocytic marker GFAP (Q–T). 400x 
Magnification. Scale bar = 50μm. Insets show higher magnification of Ki67+ cells.

 Fig. 3. Phenotype of proliferating cells in the adult SVZ
Confocal micrographs of the SVZ from a 54 year-old individual shows Ki67+ cells co-
localising with the microglial marker Iba1 (A–C) but not the immature neuronal marker beta 
III tubulin (D–F) or the astrocytic marker GFAP (G–I). (J) A graph displaying the number of 
Ki67+ cells co-localising with different cell specific markers in the SVZ across a range of 
ages, note as quantification was performed on serial tissue sections totals could exceed or be 
less than 100%. (A–I) Magnification = 200x, Insets - 600x. Scale bar = 50 μm.

 Fig. 4. Immunostaining of endogenous markers of proliferation and neurogenesis in the human 
SGZ
Representative photomicrographs showing differences in immunostaining for Ki67 and 
DCX with age with the polymorphic layer to the right side in all images. Immunostaining 
shows the SGZ of a 0.3 year-old individual with (A) numerous Ki67+ cells with a nuclear 
staining pattern and (B) abundant DCX+ cells with predominantly somatic staining. A 1.3 
year-old shows (C) a single Ki67+ cell and (D) numerous DCX+ cells with predominantly 
cytoplasmic staining. A16 year-old individual shows no Ki67+ cells (E) and a single DCX+ 
cell with dendritic and somatic staining (arrow). A 54 year-old individual shows the same 
pattern for both Ki67 (G) and DCX (H) as the 16 year-old individual. 400x magnification. 
Scale bar = 50μm.

 Fig. 7. Characterisation of the RMS
Photomicrographs show traces of the rostral migratory stream with distinctive ependymal 
islets extending rostrally from and confluent with the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle 
between the corpus callosum (CC) and head of the caudate nucleus (CN). Higher 
magnifications of regions corresponding to black rectangles are shown in insets. Collages of 
overlapping fields show DCX+ cells throughout the dorsomedial portion of the RMS in a (A) 
0.2 year-old and (B) one year-old brain but only a single DCX+ cell (nuclear) in the (C) 54 
year-old. (D – E) Ki67+ cells are seen in ventrolateral portion of the RMS in (D) 0.2 year-old 
but markedly fewer Ki67+ cells within the RMS of (E) a one year-old. (F) a confocal 
micrograph showing the disparity of Ki67 (red) and DCX (green) within the RMS of a 0.2
