ABSTRACT:
Objective: Our objective was to assess the operating characteristics of the Psychological De-
velopment Questionnaire-1 (PDQ-1), an autism screener for use with young children. Methods: In Phase 1,
we evaluated the concordance of the PDQ-1 with established autism scales, determined test-retest reliability,
and identified a risk threshold score. In Phase 2, a population of 1959 toddler-age children was prospectively
screened through multiple pediatric practices in a diverse metropolitan region, using the new instrument.
Screen-positive children were referred for diagnostic evaluation. Screened children received follow-up at age
4 years to identify autism cases missed by screening and to specify the scale’s psychometric properties.
Results: By screening a diverse population of low risk children, age 18 to 36 months, with the PDQ-1, we
detected individuals with autism who had not come to professional attention. Overall, the PDQ-1 showed
a positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 99% in a low risk
population. High specificity, good sensitivity, and PPV were observed across the 18 to 36 month age-range.
Conclusion: The findings provide preliminary empirical support for this parent report–based indicator of
toddler psychological development and suggest that the PDQ-1 may be a useful supplement to de-
velopmental surveillance of autism. Additional research is needed with high risk samples and large, un-
selected populations under real-world conditions.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a complex and
heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder character-
ized by deficits in social communication and interaction,
as well as by restricted and/or repetitive patterns of be-
havior,1 affects 1% to 2% of US children2 and is increasing
in prevalence.3 Signs of ASD are almost always evident
before the age of 3 years,4 and many caregivers report
developmental concerns during the second year or ear-
lier.5 Nonetheless, many children with ASD do not come
to attention before school age and fewer receive early
interventions.6 Because clinical judgment alone is in-
sufficient for the detection of ASD in young children,7 the
use of standard screeners may contribute to the detection
of ASD in young children. Despite growing ASD aware-
ness, however, the use of developmental screeners
remains low,8 and universal autism screening is an un-
realized goal.9 Interestingly, the topic of autism screening
has grown controversial, with the US Preventive Services
Taskforce (USPSTF) concluding that the harms and bene-
fits of universal autism screening cannot be determined,10
thereby contradicting the recommendations of the Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Society for De-
velopmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, with regard to
screening all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months.11,12
A brief parent-report questionnaire, the Psychological
Development Questionnaire-1 (PDQ-1), was developed
to represent the expression of social referencing and
communication in young children and, inversely, to de-
tect children at risk for ASD. The PDQ-1 was designed to
stand as an efficient, single-phase tool, able to identify at-
risk individuals, age 18 to 36 months, without a follow-
up interview, as required by the Modified Checklist for
Autism in Toddlers-Revised/with Follow-up (M-CHAT-R/

 F), the most utilized and studied ASD screener.13,14 Be-
ginning with 23 questions derived from parent concern,
clinical experience and research on the development of
social interest, communication, and imitation,11,12,15 the
PDQ-1 was reduced to 11 and, ultimately, 10 questions.
The child’s primary caregiver answers each of the PDQ-1
questions on a 3-point (0–2) scale, and the weighted
answers are summed to yield a total score. The PDQ-1
can be self-administered in paper or digital form or ad-
ministered verbally in ,2 minutes and scored in
,2 minutes. The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate
the concordance of the PDQ-1 with reliable and valid
ASD tests; (2) establish the PDQ-1 test-retest reliability;
(3) define a screen positive threshold for the general
population (Phase 1) and, subsequently, (4) describe the
distribution of PDQ-1 scores by age, sex, and socioeco-
nomic status in a large diverse population; and (5) assess
the scale’s psychometric properties, including sensitiv-
ity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive val-
ues, based on prospective administration.
METHODS
Setting and Participants
In the pilot study (Phase 1, Fig. 1), 180 caregivers of
children age 12 to 36 months, residing in the New York
metropolitan region, participated through a written in-
formed consent process. The psychological status of 42
autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-diagnosed children,
recruited from an early intervention program, was eval-
uated with the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC)16—a 57-
item ASD questionnaire—and the Psychological De-
velopment Questionnaire-1 (PDQ-1) for the comparison
of test findings from caregivers of 38 age-matched chil-
dren with developmental delay (DD), but no indication
of social deficit, recruited from a high risk infant follow-
up program and 100 age-matched children without in-
dication of developmental or neurological delay or dis-
ability; typically developing (TD) controls were recruited
from 1 urban (n 5 50) and 1 suburban (n 5 50) pediatric
practice. A randomly selected sample (20%) of ASD (n 5
8), DD (n 5 8), and TD (n 5 20) caregivers completed
the ABC and PDQ-1 twice, once at baseline and 7 days
later, to determine short-term test/retest reliability. ABC
and PDQ-1 scores by parents of ASD-diagnosed children
(n 5 42) were compared with independently adminis-
tered, case-blind, Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised
(ADI-R) scores for this group. The ASD risk threshold for
the new test was defined as the highest total PDQ-1 score
observed in the ASD group.
Subsequently (Phase 2), prospective screening with
the PDQ-1 was conducted through 16 cooperating pe-
diatric practices and programs, representing a range of
primary care types and sizes, serving urban and suburban
communities in the New York metropolitan region.
Participants were toddlers (age: 18–36 months), and
their primary caregivers enrolled with written informed
consent. Caregivers were approached for participation
while waiting for any appointment type. Children with
neurologic, genetic, and/or developmental disorders
were excluded, as were those who received neonatal
intensive care unit care or were born at #37 weeks
gestational age. Children whose caregivers lacked suffi-
cient language proficiency were excluded. We sought to

 enroll and screen every child meeting criteria who pre-
sented at cooperating practices and whose caregivers
agreed to follow-up. The socioeconomic status of par-
ticipants was represented by tertiles derived from
a multifactorial, community-level index17—the District
Factor Group ranking, representing the community of
the cooperating practice.
Screening Instrument
The PDQ-1 is a 10-item questionnaire (Table 1) pri-
marily reflecting the caregiver’s evaluation of their
child’s level of communication and social orientation.
Seven PDQ-1 questions bear on the child’s level of social
interest, imitation, and reciprocity; 2 reflect the child’s
oral vocabulary. One question inquires about the tod-
dler’s responsiveness to sound. The caregiver’s answers
are scored 0 to 2 points, according to a (predetermined)
schema and summed to yield a total score. The maxi-
mum PDQ-1 score is 20. A PDQ-1 (cut-point) score #12
served as the (screen-positive) risk threshold, based on
Phase 1 findings.
Screening Procedures
Research and cooperating clinical staff established
practice-specific procedures for enrollment. Research
staff or a designated member of the host practice pro-
vided study information, conducted enrollment, and ad-
ministered the screener. Caregivers of children (18–36
months old) provided written informed consent during
the child’s visit and completed the PDQ-1. The ques-
tionnaire was self-administered by the caregiver, in the
waiting area, or was administered verbally, at the
parent’s request, in a private office, by a researcher.
Completed questionnaires were scored by researchers
using a standard schema (Time 1: screening phase).
Parents of screen-positive children were offered a com-
prehensive, expedited, (no-cost) developmental evalua-
tion of the child. A subset (n 5 10) of randomly selected
(screen-negative) individuals (PDQ-1 . 12) was referred
for and received evaluation. Evaluations were conducted
by
a
team
consisting
of
a
psychologist
and
de-
velopmental pediatrician supervising graduate students
and assistants who were research trained in and main-
tained high reliability on the evaluation measures. Stan-

the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL),19 a standard-
ized test of intellectual functioning in youngsters from
0 to 68 months. The ADI-R behavioral domain was ex-
cluded from the autism classificatory algorithm to im-
prove sensitivity.20 Nonverbal intellectual functioning
was based on MSEL fine motor and visual reception
subtest age equivalents (nonverbal intelligence quotient
5 mean age equivalent on and Visual Reception/chro-
nological age in months 3 100). ASD diagnostic status
was determined by an experienced, case blind, de-

 than 1 SD below the mean on any MSEL subscale were
referred, with the caregiver’s permission, to early in-
tervention and/or other providers. In the follow-up
phase, when screened cases were aged between 48
and 60 months, researchers contacted caregivers for
a standardized, brief interview (Table 2) reflecting the
child’s developmental status (Time 2: follow-up phase).
Multiple strategies to maximize follow-up were imple-
mented, including proactive contact, address, and phone
checking and re-engagement through the cooperating
practices. The scale was assessed at 3 levels: #12, #10,
and #7. PDQ-1 psychometric properties were assessed
at follow-up (Time 2, Fig. 2). All aspects of the pilot and
the prospective screening project were conducted with
institutional review board approval from the host in-
stitution. Data analyses were performed using SAS 9.3
statistical software.
RESULTS
In the pilot, Psychological Development Questionnaire-1
(PDQ-1) and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores varied
significantly across autism spectrum disorder (ASD), de-
velopmental delay (DD), and typically developing groups (1-
way analysis of variance, F test; p-value , 0.001), among
children, age 12 to 36 months. Median PDQ-1 scores were
5.0, 16.0, and 17.2, respectively. PDQ-1 and ABC scores
were associated (20.869; p-value , 0.001). PDQ-1 and ABC
total scores were consistent (0.997; p-value , 0.001; 0.998;
p-value , 0.001) over a 7-day period. PDQ-1 total scores
ranged from 0 to 20. The maximum PDQ-1 score recorded
from the ASD group was 12. The concordance of the PDQ-1
(and ABC) with Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-
R) total score was 100% at ASD diagnostic levels.
Subsequently, in the screening study, investigators
requested participation from 2288 caregivers. A total of
325 individuals (14.4%) did not complete the PDQ-1,
declined or met exclusionary criteria, yielding 2007
PDQ-1-screened children (18–36 months old). Post-
screening, an additional 7 individuals declined further
participation, yielding 2000 screened cases at Time 1
(Fig. 2). At follow-up (Time 2), 48 individuals declined
participation or could not be contacted, yielding 1959
subjects who participated at Time 1 and Time 2 (Fig. 2).
Boys and girls were equally likely to be screened (51%,
49%). Socioeconomic status (SES) distribution skewed
low: 55% were from low-SES communities compared
with 11% from middle- and 34% from high-SES commu-
nities. The mean age at screening was 27 months. Forty-
one percent of toddlers were screened at 18 to 24-
months, whereas 30% and 29% were screened at 25 to
30 months and 31 to 36 months, respectively. Slight but
significant differences in total PDQ-1 scores were ob-
served by sex and SES, and with increasing age, across
the screened population (Table 3). Subsequent to a PDQ-
11 (screen-positive) score and consequent diagnostic
evaluation, 1959 of 2007 (98%) screened cases had
follow-up when children were 48 months or older. At
that time, 26 caregivers reported that their child had
been diagnosed with ASD, including the 22 identified at
Time 1.
Characteristics of the screened children followed at age
4 to 5 years are provided in Table 4. Children diagnosed
with ASD were predominantly male (73% vs 27%), skewed
younger (50% younger than 24 months vs 41% in the total
sample) and were from low SES communities (58%). Ta-
ble 3 also profiles the 3 (screened) children with PDQ-1
scores #12 (screen-positive) at Time 1 but whose care-
givers reported no ASD diagnosis at follow-up. These indi-
viduals (1 male and 2 females [screened from low SES
communities]) received total scores #12 (screen positive),
who were evaluated at Time 1 and subsequently found
negative for ASD by clinical evaluation, and ADI-R in-
terview results can be considered false positives (Table 3).
All 3 (false positives) had Mullen Scales of Early Learning
(MSEL) scores indicative of language impairment, and 1
individual had MSEL consistent with cognitive impairment.
All 3 were evaluated between 18 and 24 months old, the
period of lowest test sensitivity. At follow-up, the (false
positive) caregivers reported that their children had re-
ceived services for DD or concern but had not received an
ASD diagnosis.

 The ASD prevalence estimate derived from the
screened population was in the range of 13 per 1000.
At follow-up, PDQ-1 positive predictive value (PPV)
was 88%. Table 5 also presents the sensitivity, speci-
ficity, PPV, and negative predictive value (NPV) of the
PDQ-1 at different levels of total score cutoff (#12,
#10, and #7). As expected, as PPV increased across
the different cutoff points, test sensitivity decreased.
At the #7 cutoff, the PPV was 100%, but sensitivity
was reduced to 23%. The specificity and NPV of the
PDQ-1 ranged from 99% to 100% at all cutoff points
(Table 5).
Since population screeners aim to identify individ-
uals with an undetected problem as early as possible,
Table 5 shows the screening results by age and indi-
cates highest sensitivity (100%) at the 31- to 36-month
level and roughly comparable sensitivities at 18 to 24
months (85%) and 25 to 30 months old (71%). The
overall PPV of the PDQ-1 was 88% with lower PPV
(79%) at 18 to 24 months and higher PPV (100%) be-
tween 25 and 36 months old. Among those who
screened positive by PDQ-1 at evaluation, almost all
(96%) showed lower than expected ($1 SD) MSEL

Autism Screener for Young Children
Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics
 and a significant minority (28%) had an MSEL non-
verbal intelligence quotient score $2 SDs below the
mean, consistent with cognitive impairment (Ta-
ble 6). At Time 2, follow-up interview indicated that
parents of PDQ-11 cases were more likely to report
that their child had significant sleep problems and
more
frequent
hospitalization
or
emergency
de-
partment visits, over the preceding 12 to 18 months,
than parents of children scoring high ($12) on the
PDQ-1 (Table 6).
DISCUSSION
The findings provide initial evidence in support of
a brief autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screener based
on parent report. In a large, diverse, low risk population,
the instrument detected ASD in toddler-age children
without previously suspected deficits and showed good
sensitivity (85%) and high specificity (99%)—represent-
ing a positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%. The new
instrument balanced the advantages of high sensitivity
and PPV across the 18 to 36 months age range. The
Psychological Development Questionnaire-1
(PDQ-1)
can be administered quickly and scored without special
training; universal follow-up is not required, and the
screener has a clear-cut point (risk threshold). Pro-
spective administration of the PDQ-1 through multiple
primary care practices indicated relatively few false
positives at the established risk threshold. Consistent
with
several
US
population–based
studies
of
the
aera,22,23 the ASD prevalence estimate generated from
prospective screening with the PDQ-1 was in the range
of 10 to 15 per 1000. Data from the pilot study showed
that PDQ-1 scores were highly concordant with Autism
Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) scores at ASD di-
agnostic levels, thereby affirming the construct validity
of the new instrument. In addition, PDQ-1 scores were
consistent over the 7-day test-retest period, supporting
the likelihood of short-term test stability. At evaluation,
most of the PDQ-11 cases had indications of depressed
language functioning on the Mullen Scales of Early
Learning (MSEL) and more than one-quarter had MSEL
nonverbal intelligence quotient scores consistent with
cognitive impairment.
Early detection of heterogeneous developmental
disorders, like ASD, is challenging. No single behavioral
or observational approach is likely to be simple and
reliable
across
the
range
of
affected
individuals.
Screening is only a brief assessment designed to identify
individuals who should receive a more thorough eval-
uation. Consistent use of a reliable screening tool may
be
regarded
as
a
complement
to
ongoing
de-
velopmental surveillance and serve as a vehicle for
heightened engagement with the caregiver. By system-
atically eliciting caregiver concern and information, the
health provider increases the likelihood of detecting
a disorder early and enhances the potential for positive
outcomes.
The study has several strengths. It was designed and
conducted as a prospective investigation, allowing for
an accurate assessment of test sensitivity and speci-
ficity. The screened population was demographically
diverse and spanned a significant age range (18–36
months), and test performance characteristics were
evaluated at multiple ages. Half of all screened subjects
were from low socioeconomic status communities,
reflecting a plan to include a group that is un-
derrepresented in research and is most likely to have
delayed ASD diagnosis.24 The diagnostic evaluation
was comprehensive and included an independently
administered interview based on parent information
(ADI-R)
and
a
DSM-IV–guided
(ASD1)
diagnostic
evaluation based on observation by and clinical judg-
ment of an experienced clinician.
The study included a follow-up phase which allowed
for the identification of cases that were screen-negative
but later identified with ASD. The investigators achieved
a high level of follow-up (98%), by use of multiple
strategies, including proactive contact, phone and ad-

including through the cooperating providers. The study
detected children with ASD who had not come to at-
tention and assisted them in receiving services. The
sensitivity and PPV of the PDQ-1 were shown to be good,
whereas specificity was excellent in comparison with
the best available ASD screener, the M-CHAT-R/F,14
which has a PPV of 54%. PDQ-1 advantages include
brevity, ease of administration and basis in parent-

 provided information, as well as high initial sensitivity,
specificity, and PPV.
The study also has limitations. Screening and follow-up
were conducted under informed consent conditions. The
PDQ-1 operating characteristics may be different under
real-life clinical practice conditions. The findings are pre-
liminary and call for replication in large, unselected, and
high risk populations. Additional studies are needed with
large, unselected populations and, additionally, to in-
vestigate the PDQ-1 as a level 2 screener, that is, as a tool
for use with individuals who have already known or sus-
pected neurological or developmental conditions. Those
children were purposefully excluded from the current
study, which evaluated the PDQ-1 as a screener for the
general (low risk) population. To be most useful, the PDQ-
1 and future ASD screeners should define the extent to
which they can discriminate children with ASD from
peers with global delay or other (specific) developmental
disorders. This study employed a standardized ASD di-
agnostic interview (ADI-R) and DSM-IV–guided clinical
judgment for confirmation of ASD. Future studies could
include additional or substitute diagnostic measures such

children who screened negative on the PDQ-1 were evaluated using Mullen scales, ADI-R, and clinical evaluation). cTime 2 examines all screened children at follow-up

Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis can only be
accomplished through comprehensive evaluation by
a professional. Effective screening is but the first step
toward diagnosis. Additional study is needed to assess
the usefulness of the PDQ-1 with high risk groups and
to evaluate the instrument under everyday conditions,
with unselected populations. The availability of valid
and efficient screeners, like the PDQ-1, may enhance
our ability to detect ASD in young children and to
expand the number of youngsters receiving early
interventions.
