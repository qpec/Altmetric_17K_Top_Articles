Background: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination percentage among 
 
age-eligible girls in Japan is only in the single digits. This signals the need for effective 
vaccine communication tactics. This study aimed to examine the influence of statistical 
data and narrative HPV vaccination recommendation massages on recipients’ vaccina-
tion intentions.
Methods: This randomized controlled study covered 1,432 mothers who had daughters 
aged 12–16 years. It compared message persuasiveness among four conditions: statis-
tical messages only; narrative messages of a patient who experienced cervical cancer, in 
addition to statistical messages; narrative messages of a mother whose daughter expe-
rienced cervical cancer, in addition to statistical messages; and a control. Vaccination 
intentions to have one’s daughter(s) receive the HPV vaccine before and after reading 
intervention materials were assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted using analysis 
of variance with Tukey’s test or Games–Howell post hoc test, and analysis of covariance 
with Bonferroni correction.
results: Vaccination intentions after intervention in the three intervention conditions 
were higher than the control condition (p < 0.001). A mother’s narrative messages in 
addition to statistical messages increased HPV vaccination intention the most of all tested 
intervention conditions. A significant difference in the estimated means of intention with 
the covariate adjustment for baseline value (i.e., intention before intervention) was found 
between a mother’s narrative messages in addition to statistical messages and statistical 
messages only (p = 0.040).
Discussion: Mothers’ narrative messages may be persuasive when targeting mothers 
for promoting HPV vaccination. This may be because mothers can easily relate to and 
identify with communications from other mothers. However, for effective HPV vaccine 
communication, further studies are needed to understand more about persuasive differ-
ences in terms of statistics, narratives, and narrators. Directions for future research are 
also suggested.

Persuasiveness of Vaccine Recommendation Messages

In communicating about risks and benefits of public health prac-
tices, it is essential to convey evidence-based information and to 
influence the audience to make better health decisions (1). This 
concept of public health communication is especially important 
in the current human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination crisis in 
Japan. The HPV vaccination rate for age-eligible girls in Japan was 
as high as 70–80% in 2011 and 2012 (2). However, owing to a series 
of negative campaigns by mass media on severe adverse reactions 
allegedly caused by HPV vaccination, such as difficulties walking 
and memory impairment, the proactive recommendation of HPV 
vaccination was suspended by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and 
Welfare in June 2013. As a direct result, the HPV vaccination rate 
among age-eligible girls fell sharply to only a few percent by 2014 
(2). Fears concerning adverse reactions to HPV vaccination are 
now a significant reason for avoiding vaccination in Japan and 
other countries (3–7), despite studies demonstrating the safety of 
HPV vaccines (8, 9). In this critical situation, conveying scientific 
information alone may not sway the biased anti-HPV vaccination 
sentiment; influential and persuasive communication tactics to 
encourage the audience to make less biased decisions are needed.
In Japan, unlike in many other developed countries, the 
primary care doctor system is underdeveloped, and school-
administrated HPV vaccination has not been routinely per-
formed. Most mothers and their daughters do not have health 
professionals whom they can consult with about HPV vaccines. 
They gather information independently and judge by themselves 
whether or not vaccination will be sought. Accordingly, when 
proactive recommendation of HPV vaccination resumes in 
the future, publicizing online and offline vaccination recom-
mendation messages from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and 
Welfare and municipalities will be a means for recommending 
vaccination to mothers and their daughters. Therefore, examin-
ing persuasive messages that recommend HPV vaccination is an 
urgent issue in Japan.
Since Aristotle, the use of evidence has been a primary means 
of enhancing message persuasiveness. Evidence is the set of 
factual statements that originate from a source other than the 
communicator and are offered to verify the communicator’s 
claims (10). Evidence can be divided broadly into two catego-
ries: statistical and narrative evidence (11). Statistical evidence, 
such as frequencies and percentages, provide proof in the form 
of summary information across a larger number of cases (11); 
e.g., “The frequency of severe adverse reactions to the HPV vac-
cine, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, is one in 4.3 
million.” Narrative evidence refers to the use of case stories or 
examples to support the argument offered by the communicator 
(11); e.g., “I am suffering from the aftereffect of cervical cancer. 
Therefore, I recommend you receive the HPV vaccine to prevent 
cervical cancer.” Studies indicate that presenting statistical or nar-
rative evidence almost always enhances message persuasiveness 
(10–12).
A primary question among scholars has focused on the relative 
persuasiveness of messages presenting statistical evidence com-
pared with those presenting narrative evidence. At present, study 
results are somewhat contradictory, and no definitive difference 
has been demonstrated between narrative and statistical evidence 
(10–14). However, using narratives to motivate health behavior is 
an emerging form of persuasion in public health (15–17). Several 
recent studies in the context of vaccine communication show 
that narrative messages about experiences of disease increase the 
audience’s risk perception of developing the disease, vaccination 
intention, and behaviors to prevent the disease to a greater degree 
than do didactic messages (18–21). Accordingly, use of narrative 
messages in addition to evidence-based statistical messages to 
counter the influence of anti-vaccination narratives of alleged 
victims of vaccine adverse reactions has been proposed (22–25). 
Thus, our first research question emerges herein: will a narrative 
message in addition to statistical messages result in higher intention 
to receive the HPV vaccine than statistical messages only?
Several models have been proposed to explain the persuasive-
ness of narratives, including the transportation-imagery model 
(26), extended elaboration likelihood model (27), and entertain-
ment overcoming resistance model (28). These models share 
the audience’s identification with a character of a narrative and 
transportation (i.e., caught up in, or carried away by, the story) 
as factors that serve to enhance the persuasiveness of narratives. 
Among various factors that have been explored, identification 
and transportation are the primary factors presently warranted 
by the literature (29).
Although the relationship of the influence of identification and 
transportation on narrative persuasion is not entirely clear, iden-
tification may foster transportation and consequently enhance 
persuasiveness (30, 31). Identification is a mechanism through 
which audience members experience reception and interpreta-
tion of the text internally, as if the events were happening to them 
(32). During identification, the audience imagines that he or she 
becomes the character and replaces his or her personal identity 
and role as an audience member with the identity and role of the 
character (32). A number of studies show that greater identifica-
tion with characters is associated with greater persuasiveness 
of narratives (33–40). A meta-analysis reported that perceived 
identification produced statistically significant effects on forming 
of story-consistent attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors on recipients 
(41). In addition, in the context of HPV vaccine communication, 
a study showed that the first-person narrative of a college student 
resulted in higher perceived risk of HPV infection than a report 
in the third-person narrative among participants who were col-
lege students (20). The authors discussed that the first-person 
narrative of a peer was easier to identify with for participants 
(20). Another study of college students found more HPV vaccine 
inoculation behaviors in the group who viewed the narrative 
of a college student than the narrative of a medical expert (21). 
Similarly, it was thought that participants could more easily 
identify with the narrative of a peer.
Japanese refer to the HPV vaccine as “sikyu keigan wakuchin” 
(i.e., cervical cancer vaccine). Therefore, a narrative of a cervi-
cal cancer patient who recommends HPV vaccination may be 
persuasive for some audiences. However, healthy individuals may

have difficulty identifying with a patient. When targeting mothers 
to promote HPV vaccination, the narrative of a mother who has 
a daughter may be easier to identify with and more persuasive 
than the narrative of a patient. Thus, our second research ques-
tion emerges herein: will the narrative of a mother whose daughter 
experienced cervical cancer result in higher intention to have their 
daughters receive the HPV vaccine than the narrative of a patient 
who experienced cervical cancer among participants who are moth-
ers with daughters?
This study aimed to examine the influence of HPV vaccination 
recommendation messages. It did so by using statistical data and 
narratives on vaccination intention of mothers with daughters 
aged 12–16 years, in Japan. This will help ensure that persuasive 
vaccine recommendation messages will be disseminated when 
proactive recommendation of the vaccination eventually resumes. 
A randomized controlled study was conducted to answer the 
above two research questions.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
study Design and Participants
Participants were recruited from persons registered in a survey 
company database in Japan. Eligibility criteria were mothers who 
have a daughter(s) aged 12–16 years who has never received HPV 
vaccination. An e-mail was sent to registered persons, which 
described that questionnaires (and materials) were created and 
intended for research purposes only. Recipients who were eligible 
and consented to participate in the study were invited to a web-
based survey. After conducting a pretest among 120 participants 
in August 2017, a total of 1,432 mothers excluding pretest partici-
pants completed the survey in September 2017.
When participants consented to participate in the study 
on the web screen, they were randomly assigned to a group 
that received statistical messages only, a group that received a 
patient’s narrative messages in addition to statistical messages, 
a group that received a mother’s narrative messages in addition 
to statistical messages, or a control group by algorithm included 
in the web-based survey computer program. Because required 
sample size in each intervention group was 394 participants (this 
will be discussed later), recruiting stopped when the number of 
participants of all of the intervention groups reached 394. All 
participants were asked about items such as sociodemographic 
information, history of cancer, and sexually transmitted disease, 
and whether they knew about the media coverage of adverse reac-
tions to the HPV vaccine. Participants in the intervention groups 
were asked their intention to have their daughter(s) receive the 
HPV vaccine before and after reading the intervention material. 
They were also asked their attitude toward HPV vaccination 
after reading the material. Participants in the control group were 
asked their intention of vaccination without reading interven-
tion materials. Token gifts were given to all participants upon 
completion of the study by the survey company. The protocol 
was approved by the ethical review committee at the Graduate 
School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo. All subjects gave 
written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
intervention Materials
Statistical content on the materials of the three intervention 
groups was taken from the websites of the Ministry of Health, 
Labor, and Welfare; National Cancer Center Japan; and a con-
sensus statement from 17 relevant Japanese academic societies 
on the promotion of the HPV vaccine (9). The statistical content 
included cervical cancer morbidity and mortality and HPV 
vaccine efficacy and safety. The content was identical among the 
three intervention materials. The statistical message contained a 
total of 745 Japanese characters.
Narrative contents of a patient and a mother were taken from 
a website of the United States Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (42) and modified for this study. In the narrative 
content, the narrator told the experience of being diagnosed 
with cervical cancer, having a total hysterectomy, giving up the 
dream of having children, suffering from complications, fearing 
cancer recurrence, and recommending HPV vaccination. These 
narrative contents were identical between the two intervention 
materials (patient’s and mother’s narratives) except for the sub-
ject of the narrative (i.e., “I,” in the patient’s narrative and “my 
daughter” in the mother’s narrative). The patient’s and mother’s 
narratives contained a total number of 341 and 357 Japanese 
characters, respectively. Appendix S1 in Supplementary Material 
shows the statistical messages and mother’s narrative used in this 
study, which was translated into English for this report.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was intention to have one’s daughter(s) 
receive the HPV vaccine after intervention. Intention before 
intervention was assessed for covariate adjustment for baseline 
value and changes in intention before and after intervention. 
Participants responded to the following three questions on 
1–6 scales ranged from “extremely unlikely,” “unlikely,” “a little 
unlikely,” “a little likely,” “likely,” to “extremely likely”: (1) “How 
likely would you have your daughter(s) receive the HPV vaccine 
sometime soon?”; (2) “If you were faced with the decision of 
whether to have your daughter(s) receive the HPV vaccine today, 
how likely is it that you would choose to have her receive the 
vaccine?”; and (3) “How likely would you have your daughter(s) 
receive the HPV vaccine in the future?” A summary score calcu-
lated by dividing the sum of scores of the three questions by three 
(i.e., mean) was used in the analysis. Higher scores indicate greater 
intentions. This measure was adapted from a previous study (43). 
The secondary outcome was attitude toward HPV vaccination. 
Participants rated “having my daughter(s) receive the HPV 
vaccine” on a scale consisting of five 1–6 semantic differential 
items (bad/good, harmful/beneficial, foolish/wise, threatening/
assuring, and risky/safe). A summary score calculated by dividing 
the sum of scores of the five items by five (i.e., mean) was used in 
the analysis. Higher scores indicate more favorable attitudes. This 
measure was adapted from a previous study (44).
sample size
A previous study of HPV vaccination communication showed that 
the effect sizes for comparing vaccination intention between “sta-
tistics only” and “a narrative in addition to statistics” conditions

and between a peer’s and a third-person’s narrative conditions 
were small (Cohen’s d = 0.2) (20). Based on these results, we 
conducted a power analysis using the G*Power 3 program (45, 
46) to determine sample size. This analysis showed that 394 par-
ticipants were required in each of the three intervention groups to 
detect an effect size (Cohen’s d) of 0.2 for comparing vaccination 
intention between “statistics only” and “a narrative in addition 
to statistics” conditions and between patient’s and mother’s nar-
rative conditions at an alpha error rate of 0.05 (two-tailed) and a 
beta error rate of 0.20. We set the sample size at about 200 for the 
control group because the number of participants who matched 
the eligibility criteria was limited among persons registered with 
the survey company.
statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe participants’ sociode-
mographic information, history, and baseline intention to vac-
cinate, by summarizing in percentages for categorical variables 
and as mean ± SD for continuous variables. Analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was conducted with the intention of vaccination or 
attitude toward vaccination as the dependent variable and the 
group assignment as the independent variable. Tukey’s test was 
conducted on significant main effects where appropriate. The 
Games–Howell post hoc test was performed when the assump-
tion of homogeneity of variances was not satisfied. According to 
recommendations in the literature including the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials statement, significance testing of 
baseline differences and covariate adjustment for variables that 
differ at baseline are not recommended because such adjustment 
is likely to bias the estimated intervention effect. However, covari-
ate adjustment for a baseline value of a quantitative outcome is 
recommended because a strong correlation between the baseline 
value and the outcome is expected (47–50). Therefore, we con-
ducted an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the baseline 
intention (i.e., before reading the intervention materials) as the 
covariate. Bonferroni correction was applied for the post hoc test 
to compare adjusted means of intentions. In addition, intention of 
vaccination was compared between before and after intervention 
using the paired t-test. ANOVA was conducted with changes 
in intention of vaccination before and after intervention as the 
dependent variable and the group assignment as the independent 
variable. Tukey’s test was conducted on significant main effects 
where appropriate. A p-value of <0.05 was set as significant in 
all statistical tests. All following p-values presented in the results 
of Tukey’s test, the Games–Howell post hoc test, and Bonferroni 
post hoc analyses were adjusted for multiple comparison. All 
statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
resUlTs
Participant characteristics
Numbers of participants were 394 in a group that received 
statistical messages only, 408 in a group that received a patient’s 
narrative messages in addition to statistical messages, 411 in a 
group that received a mother’s narrative messages in addition to 
statistical messages, and 219 in a control group. Table 1 shows the 
participants’ baseline characteristics. Participant age ranged from 
30 to 61 years (mean = 44 years, SD = 4.7). 49.7% of their daugh-
ters were 12–14 years old, and the remaining were 15–16 years 
old. Participants were distributed throughout Japan. About 90% 
of participants were not advised by health professionals to have 
their daughter(s) receive the HPV vaccine. About 90% of partici-
pants knew the media coverage of adverse reactions to the HPV 
vaccine and suspension of the proactive recommendation for 
HPV vaccination by the government. About 10% of participants 
had histories of cervical cancer or sexually transmitted disease 
personally or familiar persons.
intervention effect
Internal consistencies of questions about intention to have one’s 
daughter(s) receive the HPV vaccine and questions about atti-
tude toward vaccination were excellent (Cronbach’s α = 0.952, 
M = 2.73, SD = 0.99 in intention; Cronbach’s α = 0.945, 
M = 3.02, SD = 0.98 in attitude). Table 2 shows the intention of 
and attitude toward HPV vaccination across groups. Regarding 
intention of vaccination, ANOVA revealed a main effect of the 
group assignment [F(3, 1,428) = 17.198, MSE = 0.957, p < 0.001, 
η2 = 0.035]. Tukey’s test revealed a significant difference between 
the control and the statistics only (M = 2.30 vs. M = 2.81, 
p < 0.001), the control and the patient’s narrative in addition 
to statistics (M = 2.30 vs. M = 2.85, p < 0.001), and the control 
and the mother’s narrative in addition to statistics (M = 2.30 vs. 
M = 2.77, p < 0.001) groups. There was no significant differ-
ence in intention of vaccination between the three intervention 
groups. Regarding attitude toward vaccination, ANOVA revealed 
a main effect of the group assignment [F(3, 1,428) = 42.553, 
MSE = 1.645, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.082]. The Games–Howell post hoc 
test revealed a significant difference between the control and the 
statistics only (M = 2.39 vs. M = 3.10, p < 0.001), the control and 
the patient’s narrative in addition to statistics (M = 2.39 vs. M 
= 3.21, p < 0.001), and the control and the mother’s narrative in 
addition to statistics (M = 2.39 vs. M = 3.12, p < 0.001) groups. 
There was no significant difference in attitude between the three 
intervention groups.
Analysis of covariance with the baseline intention set as the 
covariate revealed the main effect of the group assignment [F(2, 
1,209) = 3.287, MSE = 0.255, p = 0.038, η2 = 0.0014]. The esti-
mated means of intention after intervention with the covariate 
adjustment for baseline values are shown in Table 2. Bonferroni 
post hoc analyses revealed a significant difference between the 
statistics only and the mother’s narrative in addition to statistics 
groups (M = 2.76 vs. M = 2.84, p = 0.040). There was no signifi-
cant difference in the estimated means of intention between the 
statistics only and the patient’s narrative in addition to statistics 
groups.
The mean of intention to have one’s daughter(s) receive 
the HPV vaccine before and after intervention in the three 
intervention groups was 2.50 (SD = 0.94) and 2.81 (SD = 0.99), 
respectably. Figure 1 shows distributions of intention of vac-
cination before and after intervention. Table 3 shows changes 
in intention of vaccination before and after intervention across

DiscUssiOn
Persuasiveness of statistical and 
narrative evidence
We conducted a randomized controlled study to compare mes-
sage persuasiveness between different conditions in terms of 
statistics, narratives, and narrators in the context of HPV vaccine 
communication. This study found that statistical only messages 
as well as a narrative (of a patient or a mother) in addition to 
statistical messages significantly improved mothers’ attitude and 
intention to have their daughter(s) receive the HPV vaccine than 
a no message condition (control). This result is consistent with a 
number of studies that showed presenting statistical or narrative 
evidence enhances message persuasiveness (10–12).
Persuasiveness of Patient’ vs. Mother’ 
narrative
One of our research questions was: will the narrative of a mother 
whose daughter experienced cervical cancer result in higher 
intention to have their daughters receive the HPV vaccine than 
the narrative of a patient who experienced cervical cancer among 
participants who are mothers with daughters? This study found 
no significant difference in attitude and intention of vaccination 
between the statistics only, patient’s narrative in addition to 
statistics, and mother’s narrative in addition to statistics groups. 
One of the reasons may be that baseline intentions affected inten-
tions after reading the material; the baseline intention was the 
highest in the statistics only group (M = 2.56) and the lowest in 
the mother’s narrative in addition to statistics group (M = 2.41) 
(see Table 1). The estimated mean of intention after adjusting 
for baseline intentions in the mother’s narrative in addition to 
statistics group was the highest among intervention groups, and 
significantly higher than in the statistics only group. In addition, 
the change in intention of vaccination before and after interven-
tion in the mother’s narrative in addition to statistics group was 
the largest among intervention groups, and significantly larger 
than in the statistics only group, although this result should be 
interpreted with caution because the regression to the mean of 
baseline values may be mixed in those changes (51). Similarity 
of the audience to a narrator should increase the likelihood of 
identification and consequently persuasiveness of the narrative 
message (30–41). The mother’s narrative may have been easy 
to feel similar to and identify with for participants who were

mothers with daughters and consequently contributed to increase 
mothers’ vaccination intentions.
However, even after adjusting for baseline intentions, we 
found no significant difference in vaccination intention between 
the patient’s narrative in addition to statistics and the mother’s 
narrative in addition to statistics groups. This may be because 
other factors such as increase in self-efficacy through modeling 
(28) and generation of fewer counterarguments (26) were more 
important than identification with the narrator in HPV vaccine 
communication. Future studies focusing on other factors such as 
modeling may be useful; e.g., a study that uses the narrative of a 
mother who had her daughter receives the HPV vaccine.
Persuasiveness of statistics Only vs. 
statistics in addition to narrative
Another of our research questions was: will a narrative message 
in addition to statistical messages result in higher intention to 
receive the HPV vaccine than statistical messages only under the 
circumstances of the HPV vaccination crisis in Japan? We found 
no significant difference in vaccination intention between the 
statistics only and the patient’s narrative in addition to statistics 
groups before as well as after adjusting for baseline intentions. 
The process of identification involves multiple dimensions such as 
sharing the character’s feelings and perspective, internalizing the 
character’s goals, and the loss of self-awareness by being absorbed 
in the story (32). Considering this, the narrative message used in 
the present study was created for research purposes and therefore 
may have been too short and dull without a picture or the name 
of the narrator to develop the process of identification for the 
audience. It may be useful to examine the persuasiveness of a 
longer and more vivid narrative of cervical cancer experience 
in future studies so that the audience can develop the process of 
identification.
limitations
The findings of this study must be interpreted with several limi-
tations. First, narrative persuasion is generally hindered when 
the persuasive intent is obvious, as in the intervention materials 
of the present study, because some audiences may react against 
being manipulated (52). This constraint of intervention materi-
als in this study should be noted in addition to shortness and 
dullness as discussed above. Second, although previous studies 
assessed the degree of identification with characters in terms of 
components such as liking, feeling like you know, and wanting 
to be like, we did not assess the degree of identification because 
such measurement items were not applicable to the narratives 
in the present study. However, mothers may obviously identify 
more with a mother’s narrative than a patient’s narrative because 
similarity of the audience to a narrator should increase the likeli-
hood of identification (32). Third, this study assessed vaccination 
intentions directly after message exposure. The long-term effects 
of promotional messages should be examined in future studies 
because they are important in this context given that HPV vacci-
nation requires multiple injections over a series of weeks. Fourth, 
this study assessed vaccination intentions rather than actual vac-
cination behaviors. However, measuring intention is beneficial 
in public health studies because it predicts actual behaviors (53). 
Finally, considering the critical situation of HPV vaccination 
in Japan, participants’ prior attitudes toward and intentions of 
vaccination may have been negatively distorted and affected the 
study results. Therefore, our results should be interpreted with 
caution.
cOnclUsiOn
Statistical messages of HPV vaccine efficacy and safety, the nar-
rative of a patient who experienced cervical cancer in addition 
to statistical messages, and the narrative of a mother whose 
daughter experienced cervical cancer in addition to statistical 
messages increased vaccination intention among participants 
who were mothers with daughters. In the practice of HPV 
vaccine communication, exposure to messages of HPV vaccine 
efficacy and safety may increase a mother’s vaccination inten-
tion whether it includes only statistical messages or narratives 
of cervical cancer experience in addition to statistical messages. 
Our study results may indicate that active dissemination of 
messages about efficacy and safety of HPV vaccines by public 
health institutions including the Ministry of Health, Labor, 
and Welfare and mother’s exposure to those messages are the 
keys to improve their attitude toward and intention of HPV 
vaccination.
A mother’s narrative in addition to statistical messages resulted 
in slightly higher vaccination intention than statistical messages 
only and a patient’s narrative message in addition to statistical 
messages. Mothers may feel similar to and easily identify with a 
mother’s narrative. Narrative of a mother with a daughter who 
experienced cervical cancer may be persuasive for audiences who 
are mothers. The public health institutions including the Ministry 
of Health, Labor, and Welfare may be able to increase persuasive-
ness of HPV vaccination recommendation messages by using the 
narrative of a mother’s daughter experienced cervical cancer in 
addition to statistical messages when they create materials such 
as leaflets and websites.
However, further studies are needed to understand more 
about persuasive differences between statistical and narrative 
messages as well as factors influencing the persuasiveness of nar-
ratives. A deeper understanding of these factors will help health 
professionals to more effectively communicate with individuals 
and communities to encourage better decision making regarding 
HPV vaccination.
