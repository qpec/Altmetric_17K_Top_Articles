The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommends routine vaccination of persons aged 11–12 years 
with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, quadrivalent 
meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and tetanus 
and reduced diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine 
(Tdap). A booster dose of MenACWY is recommended at 
age 16 years (1), and catch-up vaccination is recommended 
for hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), measles, mumps, and rubella 
vaccine (MMR), and varicella vaccine (VAR) for adolescents 
whose childhood vaccinations are not up to date (UTD) 
(1). ACIP also recommends that clinicians may administer 
a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) series to ado-
lescents and young adults aged 16–23 years, with a preferred 
age of 16–18 years (2). To estimate U.S. adolescent vaccina-
tion coverage, CDC analyzed data from the 2017 National 
Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) for 20,949 adolescents 
aged 13–17 years.* During 2016–2017, coverage increased for 
≥1 dose of HPV vaccine (from 60.4% to 65.5%), ≥1 dose of 
MenACWY (82.2% to 85.1%), and ≥2 doses of MenACWY 
(39.1% to 44.3%). Coverage with Tdap remained stable at 
* Eligible participants were born during January 1999–February 2005. Tdap 
coverage represents receipt of ≥1 Tdap dose at age ≥10 years. MenACWY 
coverage represents receipt of the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine 
or meningococcal vaccine of unknown type. MenB coverage represents receipt 
of at least 1 dose of either a 2-dose or 3-dose series, depending upon the vaccine 
brand. HPV vaccination coverage includes receipt of any HPV vaccine and 
does not distinguish between nine-valent (9vHPV), quadrivalent (4vHPV), or 
bivalent (2vHPV) vaccines. Some adolescents might have received more than 
the 2 or 3 recommended HPV vaccine doses. Estimates for hepatitis B and 
MMR vaccines represent coverage based on catch up for adolescents who were 
not up-to-date with these vaccinations. Except as noted, coverage estimates for 
≥1 and ≥2 varicella vaccine doses were obtained among adolescents with no 
history of varicella disease. Influenza vaccination coverage data are not included 
in this report but are available online at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/
index.htm.
88.7%. In 2017, 48.6% of adolescents were UTD with the 
HPV vaccine series (HPV UTD) compared with 43.4% in 
2016.† On-time vaccination (receipt of ≥2 or ≥3 doses of HPV 
vaccine by age 13 years) also increased. As in 2016, ≥1-dose 
HPV vaccination coverage was lower among adolescents living 
† Adolescents were considered to be HPV UTD if they had received ≥3 doses, 
or if all of the following applied: 1) they had received 2 doses; 2) the first dose 
was received before the 15th birthday; and 3) the interval between the first and 
second doses was ≥5 months minus 4 days, the absolute minimum interval 
between the first and second doses. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/

in nonmetropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) (59.3%) than 
among those living in MSA principal cities (70.1%).§ Although 
HPV vaccination initiation remains lower than coverage 
with MenACWY and Tdap, HPV vaccination coverage has 
increased an average of 5.1 percentage points annually since 
2013, indicating that continued efforts to target unvaccinated 
teens and eliminate missed vaccination opportunities might 
lead to HPV vaccination coverage levels comparable to those 
of other routinely recommended adolescent vaccines.
NIS-Teen is an annual survey that estimates vaccination 
coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years in the 50 states, 
the District of Columbia (DC), selected local areas, and 
territories.¶ NIS-Teen is conducted among parents and 
guardians of eligible adolescents identified using a random-
digit–dialed sample of landline and cellular telephone 
§ MSA status was determined based on household reported city and county of 
residence, and status was grouped into three categories: MSA principal city, 
MSA nonprincipal city, and non-MSA. MSA and principal city were as defined 
by the U.S. Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_cbsa.
html). Non-MSA areas include urban populations not located within an MSA 
as well as completely rural areas.
¶ The following local areas that received federal Section 317 immunization 
funds were sampled separately: Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; 
Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania; Bexar County, Texas; and Houston, Texas. 
Three local areas were oversampled (Dallas County, Texas, El Paso County, 
Texas, and Travis County, Texas). Three territories were sampled separately 
in 2017 (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Because of the 
severity of 2017’s hurricane season, survey operations in Puerto Rico and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands were suspended resulting in insufficient data for estimation 
of vaccination coverage.
numbers.** Parents and guardians are interviewed by telephone 
about the sociodemographic characteristics of the adolescent 
and household. Contact information and consent to contact 
the teen’s vaccination providers are requested. When more 
than one age-eligible adolescent lives in the household, one 
is randomly selected for participation. Vaccination providers 
identified during the interview are mailed a questionnaire 
requesting the vaccination history from the teen’s medical 
record.†† Vaccination coverage estimates are based on provider-
reported vaccination histories. This report summarizes national 
vaccination coverage for 20,949 adolescents (9,845 females 
 
** All identified cellular-telephone households were eligible for interview. 
Sampling weights were adjusted for dual-frame (landline and cellular 
telephone), nonresponse, noncoverage, and overlapping samples of mixed 
telephone users. A description of NIS-Teen dual-frame survey methodology 
and its effect on reported vaccination estimates is available at https://www.
cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/dual-frame-sampling.html. 
Starting in 2018, the landline telephone sample was dropped.
 
†† For the telephone samples for the states and local areas, the overall Council 
of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) response rate was 
25.7% (51.5% for the landline sample and 23.5% for the cellular-telephone 
sample). For adolescents with completed interviews, 48.1% had adequate 
provider data (53.6% landline sample, 47.1% cell sample). Among completed 
interviews with adequate provider data, 17% (3,572) were from the landline 
sample, and 83% (17,377) were from the cellular telephone sample. For 
Guam, the overall CASRO response rate was 31.3%. The CASRO response 
rate is the product of three other rates: 1) the resolution rate (the proportion 
of telephone numbers that can be identified as either for business or residence); 
2) the screening rate (the proportion of qualified households that complete 
the screening process); and 3) the cooperation rate (the proportion of contacted 
eligible households for which a completed interview is obtained).

[47%] and 11,104 males [53%]) aged 13–17 years with 
adequate provider data.§§
Data were weighted and analyzed to account for the complex 
sampling design of NIS-Teen. NIS-Teen methodology, includ-
ing methods for weighting and synthesizing provider-reported 
vaccination histories, has been described previously (3). T-tests 
were used to assess vaccination coverage differences between 
2017 and 2016 and between demographic subgroups (i.e., 
age, health insurance status, MSA status, race/ethnicity, and 
poverty level). Weighted linear regression by survey year was 
used to estimate annual percentage point changes in coverage. 
Trends in HPV vaccination initiation and HPV UTD status 
by year of birth were assessed using combined data from 2016 
and 2017 NIS-Teen; p-values <0.05 were considered statisti-
cally significant.
National Vaccination Coverage
In 2017, coverage with ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine was 65.5% 
among teens, an increase of 5.1 percentage points compared 
with 2016; 48.6% were HPV UTD with the recommended 
vaccination series, an increase of 5.2 percentage points from 
2016 (Table 1) (Figure). Among adolescents surveyed dur-
ing 2016–2017, HPV vaccination initiation by age 13 years 
increased an average of 5.9 percentage points for each birth 
year, from 19.6% (1998 birth cohort) to 56.3% (2004 birth 
cohort) (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/58071). HPV UTD status by age 13 years increased an 
average of 3.6 percentage points for each birth year, from 7.7% 
(1998 birth cohort) to 29.8% (2004 birth cohort). Coverage 
with ≥1 and ≥2 MenACWY doses, ≥2 MMR doses, and ≥2 
VAR doses also increased (Table 1). Coverage with ≥1 dose of 
MenB among persons aged 17 years was 14.5% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] = 12.3%–17.1%).
Vaccination Coverage by Selected Characteristics
Coverage with ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine and HPV UTD 
status were higher among adolescents living below the federal 
poverty level (73.3% and 53.7%, respectively) than among 
those living at or above the poverty level (62.8% and 46.7%, 
respectively)¶¶ (Table 2). Coverage with ≥1 dose of HPV 
vaccine was 10.8 percentage points lower among adolescents 
living in non-MSAs and 7.0 percentage points lower among 
 
§§ Adolescents from Guam (n = 382).
 
¶¶ Adolescents were classified as below the federal poverty level if their total 
family income was less than the federal poverty level specified for the applicable 
family size and number of children aged <18 years. All others were classified 
as at or above the poverty level. Poverty status was unknown for 779 
adolescents. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-
poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html.
those living in MSA nonprincipal cities compared with those 
living in MSA principal cities (Table 2). These disparities 
remained after controlling for poverty level.*** HPV UTD 
status was 10.0 percentage points lower among adolescents 
living in non-MSAs and 5.5 percentage points lower among 
those living in MSA nonprincipal cities compared with those 
living in MSA principal cities (Table 2). After adjusting for 
poverty level, differences in HPV UTD status did not persist 
among adolescents living in MSA nonprincipal cities, but did 
among adolescents living in non-MSAs compared with those 
living in MSA principal cities.††† ≥1- and ≥2-dose MenACWY 
coverage rates among adolescents living in non-MSAs were 
7.4 and 12.0 percentage points lower, respectively, than those 
among adolescents living in MSA principal cities (Table 2). 
This disparity remained after controlling for poverty level.§§§ 
Differences in HPV vaccination coverage by race/ethnic-
ity in 2017 were similar to patterns observed in previous 
years (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/58073) (4). Coverage with ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine and 
HPV UTD status were 8.8 and 6.6 percentage points higher, 
respectively, among adolescents enrolled in Medicaid than 
among those with private insurance only (Supplementary 
Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/58074). HPV UTD 
status, ≥1-dose MenACWY, and ≥2-dose MenACWY cover-
age rates were 12.7, 5.0, and 22.6 percentage points lower, 
respectively, among uninsured adolescents than among those 
with private insurance (Supplementary Table 2).
 *** Among adolescents living below poverty level, ≥1-dose HPV vaccination 
coverage estimates stratified by MSA status were 63.7% (95% CI = 58.4%–
68.7%) for adolescents living in non-MSAs, 70.4% (CI = 65.8%–74.7%) 
for adolescents living in MSA nonprincipal cities, and 78.0% (CI = 
74.1%–81.5%) for adolescents living in MSA principal cities (reference 
group). Among adolescents living at or above poverty level, ≥1-dose HPV 
vaccination coverage estimates were 56.9% (CI = 53.8%–60.0%) for 
adolescents living in non-MSAs, 61.6% (CI = 59.6%–63.6%) for adolescents 
living in MSA nonprincipal cities, and 66.0% (CI = 63.7%–68.2%) for 
adolescents living in MSA principal cities (reference group).
 ††† Among adolescents living below poverty level, HPV UTD status estimates 
stratified by MSA status were 44.3% (CI = 39.1%–49.6%), 52.8% (CI = 
47.8%–57.8%), and 57.0% (CI = 52.4%–61.5%) for adolescents living in 
non-MSAs, MSA nonprincipal cities, and MSA principal cities (reference

State, Local, and Territorial Vaccination Coverage
Vaccination coverage varied by jurisdiction (Table 3). 
Coverage with ≥1 dose of Tdap ranged from 78.9% in Alaska 
to 96.2% in Massachusetts; with ≥1 dose of MenACWY, from 
60.7% in Wyoming to 95.3% in Georgia; and with ≥1 dose 
of HPV vaccine, from 46.9% in Wyoming to 91.9% in DC 
(Table 3) (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/58072). HPV UTD status ranged from 28.8% in 
Mississippi to 78.0% in DC. The largest increases in HPV 
UTD status from 2016 to 2017 occurred in Virginia (19.8 per-
centage points), DC (16.0), South Carolina (13.6), Nebraska 
(12.4), Dallas, Texas (11.8), Louisiana (11.1), North Carolina 
(10.7), Massachusetts (8.9), Vermont (8.8), and Texas (6.8) 
(Table 3). During 2013–2017, ≥1-dose HPV vaccination 
coverage increased an average of 5.1 percentage points per year 
nationally; the 5-year average annual increase ranged from 2.2 
to 8.5 percentage points. The largest average annual increases 
were in Virginia (8.5 percentage points), DC (7.5), Montana 
(7.4), and in Arkansas, Iowa, Utah, and El Paso, Texas (7.3 
percentage points each) (Supplementary Table 3, https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/58075).
Discussion
In 2017, adolescent vaccination coverage with ≥1 dose of 
HPV vaccine, ≥1 and ≥2 doses of MenACWY, ≥2 doses of 
MMR, and ≥2 doses of VAR increased, while coverage with 
≥1 dose of Tdap and ≥3 doses of HepB remained high. This 
report includes the first U.S. estimates of ≥1-dose MenB cover-
age. Unlike MenACWY, MenB is not routinely recommended 
for all adolescents, and thus, the low vaccination coverage in 
adolescents aged 17 years (14.5%) is not unexpected.

calculated only among adolescents aged 17 years at time of interview. Does not include adolescents who received their first and only dose of MenACWY at or after 
16 years of age; HPV vaccine, nine-valent (9vHPV), quadrivalent (4vHPV), or bivalent (2vHPV). The routine ACIP recommendation for HPV vaccination was made for 
females in 2006 and for males in 2011. Because HPV vaccination was not recommended for males until 2011, coverage for all adolescents was not measured before 
that year;  HPV UTD includes those with ≥3 doses and those with 2 doses when the first HPV vaccine dose was initiated before age 15 years and at least 5 months 
minus 4 days elapsed between the first and second dose.
† ACIP revised the recommended HPV vaccination schedule in late 2016. The recommendation changed from a 3-dose to 2-dose series with appropriate spacing between 
receipt of the first and second dose for immunocompetent adolescents initiating the series before the 15th birthday. Three doses are still recommended for adolescents 
initiating the series between the ages of 15 and 26 years. Because of the change in recommendation, the graph includes estimates for ≥3 doses HPV from 2011 to 2015 
and the HPV UTD estimate for 2016 and 2017. Because HPV vaccination was recommended for boys in 2011, coverage for all adolescents was not measured before that 
year.
§ NIS-Teen implemented a revised adequate provider data definition (APD) in 2014, and retrospectively applied the revised APD definition to 2013 data. Estimates 
using different APD definitions may not be directly comparable. 
In December 2016, a 2-dose HPV vaccine schedule was 
recommended for persons starting the series at age <15 years, 
based on data showing noninferior immunogenicity compared 
with 3 doses (5). This schedule might encourage on-time 
initiation of the series and facilitate completion; however, it 
is too early to assess its impact on vaccination coverage. The 
5.1 percentage point annual increase in series initiation among 
all adolescents since 2013 is encouraging. Moreover, on-time 
vaccination (series completion by age 13 years) has increased 
approximately four percentage points in each successive birth 
cohort. Despite these improvements, HPV vaccination initia-
tion remains lower than coverage with Tdap and MenACWY, 
suggesting ongoing challenges to providing all three vaccines 
during the same visit. Efforts are under way to promote and 
improve on-time vaccination, including implementing a new 
combined Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set 
measure for adolescent vaccines that assesses receipt of all three 
routinely recommended adolescent vaccines, including HPV 
vaccine series completion by age 13 years (6).
HPV vaccine and MenACWY coverage in non-MSA areas 
remains lower than that in MSA areas. Disparities in coverage 
by MSA status were not observed for Tdap. Unlike persons 
living in urban settings, rural residents are less likely to have 
knowledge of HPV or be aware of HPV vaccine and its impor-
tance in cancer prevention (7,8). The overall shortage of health 
care providers, especially pediatricians, in rural areas might 
partially explain the lower coverage among rural adolescents 
(8,9). Health care providers in rural areas serve a broader 
population base and might be less familiar with adolescent 
vaccination recommendations. A study including adolescents 
and parents in rural Alabama identified provider education, 
better communication with parents and adolescents about the 
importance of HPV vaccination for preventing cancer, and a 
strong provider recommendation as being most influential in

initiation of HPV vaccination (7). Resources are available to 
facilitate discussion with adolescents and their parents about 
the importance of HPV vaccination (https://www.cdc.gov/
hpv/). Further evaluation is needed to identify where teens are 
receiving Tdap in non-MSAs and better understand the barri-
ers to providing HPV vaccine and MenACWY at these sites.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, the overall household response rate was 25.7% 
(landline = 51.5%; cell phone = 23.5%), and only 53.6% 
of landline-completed and 47.1% of cell phone–completed 
interviews included adequate provider data. Second, bias in 
estimates might remain after adjustment for household and 
provider nonresponse and phoneless households.¶¶¶ Weights 
have been adjusted for the increasing number of cell phone–
only households over time. Nonresponse bias might change, 
 ¶¶¶ In a sensitivity analysis of 2013 NIS-Teen data, including adjustments for 
incomplete sample frame, nonresponse bias, and incomplete ascertainment 
of vaccination status, estimates of Tdap, ≥1 dose MenACWY, and ≥1 dose 
HPV vaccine coverage, were estimated to be lower than actual values by 1–3 
percentage points https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/

which could affect comparisons of estimates between survey 
years. Third, estimates stratified by state/local area might be 
unreliable because of small sample sizes. Fourth, multiple 
statistical tests were conducted, and a small number might 
be significant because of chance alone. Finally, because NIS-
Teen includes adolescents aged 13–17 years, data on receipt 
of MenACWY or MenB vaccine at age ≥18 years could not 
be collected; thus reported coverage with these vaccines might 
underestimate the proportion of adolescents receiving them (1).
HPV vaccination initiation and completion continue to 
increase. Postintroduction monitoring studies have found 
reductions in cervical HPV infection, genital warts, and cer-
vical precancers in the United States (10). Protection against 
HPV-related cancers will continue to increase if adolescents 
and their parents are educated about the cancer prevention 
benefits of HPV vaccine and clinicians consistently recommend 
and simultaneously administer Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV 
vaccine at age 11–12 years.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Vaccines to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated 
cancers, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and meningococcal 
diseases are routinely recommended for persons aged 
11–12 years.
What is added by this report?
In 2017, coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years 
increased for ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine and ≥1 and ≥2 doses of 
meningococcal vaccines and remained high for ≥1 dose of 
tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine. 
HPV vaccination initiation has increased an average of 
5.1 percentage points annually since 2013.
What are the implications for public health care?
The increase in HPV vaccination coverage indicates that further 
efforts to address barriers to HPV vaccination initiation and 
series completion likely will lead to greater protection against 
HPV-associated cancers.
