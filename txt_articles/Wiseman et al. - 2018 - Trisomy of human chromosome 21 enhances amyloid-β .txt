Down syndrome, caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the single most common risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.
Worldwide approximately 6 million people have Down syndrome, and all these individuals will develop the hallmark amyloid
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer’s disease by the age of 40 and the vast majority will go on to develop dementia.
Triplication of APP, a gene on chromosome 21, is sufficient to cause early-onset Alzheimer’s disease in the absence of Down
syndrome. However, whether triplication of other chromosome 21 genes influences disease pathogenesis in the context of Down
syndrome is unclear. Here we show, in a mouse model, that triplication of chromosome 21 genes other than APP increases
amyloid-b aggregation, deposition of amyloid-b plaques and worsens associated cognitive deficits. This indicates that triplication
of chromosome 21 genes other than APP is likely to have an important role to play in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis in
individuals who have Down syndrome. We go on to show that the effect of trisomy of chromosome 21 on amyloid-b aggregation
correlates with an unexpected shift in soluble amyloid-b 40/42 ratio. This alteration in amyloid-b isoform ratio occurs independ-
ently of a change in the carboxypeptidase activity of the �-secretase complex, which cleaves the peptide from APP, or the rate of
extracellular clearance of amyloid-b. These new mechanistic insights into the role of triplication of genes on chromosome 21, other
than APP, in the development of Alzheimer’s disease in individuals who have Down syndrome may have implications for the
treatment of this common cause of neurodegeneration.

Introduction
Approximately 6 million individuals worldwide have Down
syndrome. Changes in social attitudes and improvements in
medical care have led to a significant rise in life expectancy
for people who have Down syndrome (Glasson et al., 2016).
In particular, neonatal survival rates of individuals who have
Down syndrome rose dramatically between 1950 and 1970
(Wu and Morris, 2013), such that today more people with
the condition than ever before are approaching late middle
age. Down syndrome is the biggest single genetic risk factor
for Alzheimer’s disease (Wiseman et al., 2015). A proportion
of people with Down syndrome start to accumulate amyloid-b
within their brain in childhood (Lemere et al., 1996; Leverenz
and Raskind, 1998), and the vast majority of individuals will
have accumulated substantial amounts of amyloid-b by their
mid-20s (Mann, 1988). By the age of 40, people who have
Down syndrome will also have universally developed neuro-
fibrillary tangles in a pattern broadly similar to that of
Alzheimer’s disease in the general population (Mann, 1988;
Lemere et al., 1996; Leverenz and Raskind, 1998). The vast
majority of people who have Down syndrome will develop
early-onset Alzheimer’s disease dementia, for example, it is
estimated that by their 60s, approximately two-thirds of indi-
viduals will have clinical dementia (McCarron et al., 2014).
The first site of amyloid-b accumulation in people with Down
syndrome is within the cell (Gouras et al., 2000; Gyure et al.,
2001; Mori et al., 2002; Hirayama et al., 2003) in the endo-
lysosomal system (Cataldo et al., 2000, 2004). It is clear that
one of the earliest Alzheimer’s disease-associated pathological
changes in people who have Down syndrome is the accumu-
lation of amyloid-b. Understanding the genetic factors that
influence amyloid-b accumulation in the context of trisomy
of chromosome 21 may assist with the development of novel
treatments
for
Alzheimer’s
disease
in
this
important
population.
Duplication of APP alone, in the absence of chromosome
21 trisomy, is a cause of early onset Alzheimer’s disease
(Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2006; Sleegers et al., 2006) making
it likely that three copies of APP are important in the de-
velopment
of
Down
syndrome–Alzheimer’s
disease.
However, the influence of three copies of the other 4600
Hsa21 protein-coding and non-coding genetic elements
(Ensembl GRCh38.p10) on Alzheimer’s disease in people
who have Down syndrome is largely not understood.
Here, we report for the first time that triplication of
chromosome 21 genes other than APP, increases amyloid-b
aggregation, plaque formation, and cognitive deficits in a
novel Down syndrome–Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid-b depos-
ition) mouse model. In our unique model system, we show
that trisomy of chromosome 21 lowers the ratio of soluble
amyloid-b40 to amyloid-b42, a known pro-amyloidogenic
change, and that this alteration in the peptide ratio correlates
with amyloid-b aggregation in the brain. Importantly, we
show that the effect of trisomy of chromosome 21 on sol-
uble amyloid-b40/amyloid-b42 ratio occurs despite unaltered
�-secretase complex carboxypeptidase activity.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
For animal studies end-points were determined by animals’
age, as defined below (Cohorts A–I). All experiments were
undertaken blind to genotype. Genotype was decoded after
experimental analysis and reconfirmed using an independent
DNA sample isolated from post-mortem tail, apart from in-
stances of sudden death when tissue could not be recovered.
Group sizes were calculated using power calculations, based
upon estimates of error in the literature. Animals in which a
reduction of copy number of the APP transgene was observed
at initial genotyping at 3–4 weeks of age were excluded from
further analysis. No outliers were excluded from the study.
Individual animals were treated as the experimental unit.
Experiments using human post-mortem tissues were under-
taken blind to euploid/trisomy status. Samples sizes were deter-
mined by the availability of tissues and appropriate matched
controls at the suppling brain bank. Individual patients were
treated as the experimental unit.

tgAPP n = 8, trisomic;tgAPP n = 6. Cohort H: (3 months old for
�-secretase enzymatic assays) wild-type n = 10, trisomic n = 10.
Cohort I: (4.5–6.5 months old for immunohistochemistry APP
and amyloid-b study) wild-type n = 10, trisomic n = 10, tgAPP
n = 12, trisomic;tgAPP n = 10.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed as indicated in the figure legends by either
two-tailed Students t-test (single variable study) or univariate
ANOVA (to control for multiple variables). For ANOVA be-
tween-subject factors for mouse work were: tgAPP, trisomy, and
sex; for experiments using human post-mortem material: age at
death, sex, post-mortem interval, and disease/syndrome status.
Additional between-subjects factors were included in ANOVA as
follows, for study of amyloid-b (82E1) and APP (22C11) staining
on samples aged between 4.5 and 6.5 months, age in days was
included and for study of Tris-soluble amyloid-b38, amyloid-b40
and amyloid-b42 preparation batch and age in days of mouse
were included. Repeated measures ANOVA was used for technical
replicates when every sample had the same number of replicates
run, including immunohistology studies where two sections were
stained from each mouse, plaque counts made by the two inde-
pendent scorers, and technical replicates in the �-secretase carbox-
ypeptidase activity study. For cases when the number of technical
replicates varied between subjects, subject means were calculated
and used in the ANOVA. For the longitudinal analysis of T-maze
alternation (short-term memory) performance at different ages, a
repeated measures ANOVA was used [between-subject factors
tgAPP, trisomy, sex, batch of mice Cohort A(i) or Cohort A(ii);
within-subject factor age]. A repeated measures ANOVA was used
for analysis of habituation to the open field [factors tgAPP, tri-
somy, sex, batch of mice Cohort A(i) or Cohort A(ii)]. Univariate
ANOVA was used for the other behavioural tasks (factors tgAPP,
trisomy, sex, batch of mice) [Cohort A(i), Cohort A(ii), and/or
Cohort B]. The identity (i.e. physical location) of ‘other arm’
used during the exposure phase was included as an additional
between-subjects factor in the analysis of the spatial Y-maze
data. All analyses were performed in SPSS.
Human tissue ethics
The procurement and use of human tissues in this study was in
accordance with the UK Human Tissue Act 2004. The study
was reviewed and approved by NHS Research Ethics commit-
tee, London-Queen Square. All samples were supplied, anon-
ymized by UK Brain Banks, as indicated in Supplementary
Table 1, and had full research consent.
Animal welfare and husbandry
Mice were housed in controlled conditions in accordance with
guidance
issued
by
the
Medical
Research
Council
in
Responsibility in the Use of Animals for Bioscience (2017) and
all experiments were carried out under License from the UK
Home Office and with Local Ethical Review panel approval.
Tc1 mice were taken from a colony maintained by mating Tc1
females (MGI: 3814712) to F1 (129S8 � C57BL/6) males. J20
B6.Cg-Tg(PDGFB-APPSwInd)20Lms/2J (MGI: 3057148) animals
were maintained by mating J20 APP transgenic mice to C57BL/
6J. Tc1 females were mated to J20 males to generate Cohorts A–
J, all cohorts were mixed sex unless otherwise stated. All mice
were co-housed throughout the study as lone-housing is known
to modify APP-related phenotypes (Kang et al., 2007); mice were
housed with littermates and/or animals of the same sex weaned
at the same time, thus mice of differing genotypes were
co-housed pseudo-randomly.
Mice had access to a mouse house with bedding material
and wood chips. All animals had continual access to water
and RM1 (Special Diet Services) (stock animals) or RM3
(Special Diet Services) (breeding animals) chow. Mice in
Cohorts B–F and H–J were housed in individually ventilated
cages in a specific pathogen free (SPF) facility. Mice in Cohorts
A and G were bred in individually ventilated cages in an SPF
facility prior to transportation to another facility. Mice from
Cohort A were then housed in open cages in a non-SPF facil-
ity. Mice in Cohorts A–F and H–J were housed at 21 � 2�C
and 55 � 10% humidity. Animals were euthanized by expos-
ure to rising carbon dioxide, followed by confirmation of
death by dislocation of the neck in accordance with the
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (United Kingdom).
DNA extraction and genotyping
DNA was extracted from tail tip or ear biopsy by the Hot Shot
method (Truett et al., 2000). Mice were genotyped using poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of human
chromosome 21 (Tc1 specific primers f: 50-GGTTTGAGGGA

CTTAT-30) as described previously (O’Doherty et al., 2005).
Presence of the human APP transgene was tested by PCR
using primers (APP f: 50-GGTGAGTTTGTAAGTGATGCC-30

 RNA extraction and quantitative
RT
-PCR
Total hippocampal RNA was extracted using miRNeasy� mini
kit (Qiagen). Tissue was disrupted using a TissueRuptor�
(Qiagen), and the protocol followed as per the manufacturer’s
instructions, samples were defrosted and homogenized on ice.
Final extracted RNA was eluted in DNase- and RNase-free
water. Amounts of RNA were equalized and cDNA was gen-
erated
using
the
QuantiTect�
Reverse
Transcription
Kit
(Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was undertaken to determine ex-
pression of human mutant APP (primers f: 50-CGACCGA
GGACTGACCACTC-30 r: 50-TGTCGGAATTCTGCATCCA
GA-30 probe FAM-CCAGGTTCTGGGTTGACAAATATCAA
GACG) and mouse App (primers f: 50-CTCCAGCCGTGG
CACC-30 r: 50-AGTCCTCGGTCAGCAGCG-30 probe FAM-
ACTCTGTGCCAGCCAATACCGAAAATGA).
Mouse
b-
actin (Actb) (4352341E-Vic Life Technologies) and Gapdh
(4342339E-Vic Life Technologies) were used as endogenous
controls. Minus reverse-transcriptase controls were run for
every sample for all reactions. No evidence of genomic ampli-
fication was detected.
Tissue preparation and western
blotting
For analysis of protein abundance in hippocampus and cortex,
tissue was dissected under ice-cold PBS before snap freezing.
Samples were then homogenized in RIPA Buffer (150mM
sodium chloride, 50mM Tris, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deox-
ycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate) plus complete protease
inhibitors (Calbiochem) by mechanical disruption. Total protein
content was determined by Bradford assay. Samples from indi-
vidual animals were run separately and were not pooled.
Equal amounts of total brain proteins were then denatured in
LDS denaturing buffer (Invitrogen) and b-mercaptoethanol, prior
to separation by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis using precast 4–
12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitro-
cellulose or PVDF membranes prior to blocking in 5% milk/PBST
(0.05% Tween-20) or 5–10% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/
PBST. Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA/PBST, HRP-
conjugated secondary anti-rabbit, anti-mouse and anti-goat anti-
bodies (Dako) were diluted 1:10000 in 1% BSA/PBST. Linearity
of antibody binding was confirmed by a 2-fold dilution series of
cortical protein samples. Band density was analysed using ImageJ.
Relative signal of the antibody of interest compared to the in-
ternal loading control was then calculated, and relative signal was
then normalized to mean relative signal of control samples run on
the same gel. Mean of technical replicates were calculated and
used for ANOVA, such that biological replicates were used as the
experimental unit.
Primary antibodies against C-terminal APP (Sigma A8717,
1:10000), BACE1 (Abcam ab108394, 1:1000), IDE (Abcam
ab32216, 1:1000), Neprilysin (R&D Systems AF1126, 1:1000),
b-actin (Sigma A5441, 1:60000), and GAPDH (Sigma G9545,
1:200000), were used.
BACE1 b-secretase activity assay
BACE1 b-secretase activity was measured as described pre-
viously (Ahmed et al., 2010). Briefly, whole cortex was lysed
in extraction buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, 3 mM NaCl,
0.1% TritonTM X-100, 0.32 M sucrose, pH 5.0) and an anti-
BACE1 antibody (Abcam 108394) was used to capture en-
dogenous BACE1, and cleavage of a b-secretase fluorogenic
peptide substrate was measured over 2 h at 37�C.
Carboxypeptidiase �-secretase
activity assay
CHAPSO detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) were pre-
pared from brain cortices after careful removal of leptomenin-
ges and blood vessels, as previously described (Szaruga et al.,
2015). Briefly, tissue was homogenized in �10 volumes of
10% sucrose in MBS buffer (25 mM MES, pH 6.5, 150 mM
NaCl) containing 1% CHAPSO (Sigma); separated by a su-
crose density gradient and the DRM fraction (interface of 5%/
35% sucrose) was collected and rinsed twice in 20 mM PIPES,
pH 7, 250 mM sucrose, 1 M EGTA. The resultant pellet was
resuspended with the above buffer and used as source of
enzyme. Activity assays were carried out for 1 or 2 h for
mouse or human derived DRMs, respectively, as described
before (Szaruga et al., 2015).
Expression and purification of
wild-type C99-3xFLAG substrate
Human wild-type APPC99-3xFLAG substrate was expressed
in COS1 or HEK cells and purified as previously described
(Chavez-Gutierrez et al., 2008). Purity was assessed by SDS-
PAGE and Coomassie staining (GelCode reagent, Pierce).
Quantification of amyloid-b
production by ELISA
Amyloid-b38, amyloid-b40 and amyloid-b42 product levels were
quantified on Multi-Spot 96 well plates pre-coated with anti-
amyloid-b38,
amyloid-b40,
and
amyloid-b42
antibodies
obtained from Janssen Pharmaceutica using multiplex MSD
technology, as described before (Szaruga et al., 2015).
Tissue fractionation for amyloid-b or
soluble APP assays and amyloid-b
ELISA
Total cortical proteins were fractionated based on the method
in Shankar et al. (2009). Total cortex was homogenized in five
volumes of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mM Tris-
HCl pH 8.0) plus complete protease and phosphatase inhibi-
tors (Calbiochem). Homogenates were centrifuged at 175 000 g
at 4�C for 30 min, and the resultant supernatant (the soluble
TBS fraction) was stored at �80�C. The resultant pellet was
homogenized in five volumes of 1% TritonTM X-100 in TBS
plus complete protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 175 000 g
at 4�C for 30 min, and the resultant supernatant (the Triton
soluble fraction) was stored at �80�C. The resultant pellet was
homogenized in eight volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH
8.0, containing 5 M guanidine-HCl plus complete protease in-
hibitors (Calbiochem). This resuspension (the guanidine HCl
soluble fraction) was incubated at 4�C for a minimum of 14 h

 with shaking and was stored at �80�C. Protein concentration
was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).
Total hippocampal proteins were homogenized in five vol-
umes of ice-cold TBS plus complete protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Calbiochem) based on the method in Holtta et al.
(2013). Homogenates were centrifuged at 16 000 g at 4�C for
30 min. The resultant supernatant (the soluble TBS fraction)
was stored at �80�C. Protein concentration was determined
by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).
Samples were then analysed by human amyloid-b40 and
amyloid-b42 ELISA (Life Technologies),
and/or amyloid-b
6E10
Triplex,
sAPPb
or
sAPP�
Assay
(Meso
Scale
Discovery) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly the
TBS, Triton, and guanidine HCl soluble fractions were diluted
into reaction buffer (Dulbecco’s phosphor-buffered saline 5%
BSA 0.0003% Tween, complete protease inhibitors) or Diluent
35 (Meso Scale Discovery) and added to a precoated plate
prior to addition of amyloid-b detection antibody and incuba-
tion overnight at 4�C (Invitrogen) or 2 h at room temperature
(Meso Scale Discovery). After washing, either a HRP-second-
ary antibody (Life Technologies) was applied prior to applica-
tion of a chromogenic reagent (Life Technologies) and plates
were read on a Sunrise plate-reader (450 nm), or Read Buffer
(Meso Scale Discovery) was applied immediately prior to plate
reading on a Meso Scale Discovery Sector Imager.
Multimeric amyloid-b ELISA
Multimeric amyloid-b was measured as described before in
detail (Holtta et al., 2013). In brief, the amyloid-b N-ter-
minal-specific antibody 82E1 (IBL International) was used
for both capture and detection, which results in selective quan-
tification of oligomerized amyloid-b (no signal from monomers
due to epitope-blocking). A synthetic dimer consisting of two
amyloid-b1–11 peptides with an added C-terminal cysteine
through which the peptides were coupled via a disulphide
bridge (Caslo) was used to create the standard curve. All sam-
ples were measured on one occasion using one batch of re-
agents. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 7%.
Mass-spectrometry analysis of amy-
loid-b in fractionated cortical proteins
Amyloid-b was immunoprecipitated using the KingFisher mag-
netic particle processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and mass
spectrometric analysis using MALDI-TOF MS were performed
as described previously (Mustafiz et al., 2011). Briefly, anti-
amyloid-b antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 (Signet Laboratories)
were
separately
added
to
magnetic
Dynabeads�
M-280
Sheep Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen). These coated beads were
mixed and added to fractionated brain homogenate diluted in
0.025% Tween 20 PBS (pH 7.4). After washing, using the
KingFisher magnetic particle processor, bound amyloid-b was
eluted using 0.5% formic acid. MALDI-TOF MS measure-
ments
were
performed
using
an
autoflexTM
instrument
(Bruker Daltonics). Each spectrum represents an average of
10 000 measurements. The MALDI samples were prepared
with the seed layer method using cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid as the matrix. The area of each form of amyloid-b in
the spectra was normalized to the sum of all areas of the
amyloid-b peptides detected in the spectra, such that relative
changes in the abundance of the different amyloid-b peptides
can be calculated. It should be noted that the ratio between the
different isoforms detected in the mass spectrum cannot be
interpreted as a direct reflection of their absolute abundance
in the brain since the ionization efficiency might be different
for the different peptides and as different peptides are more
hydrophobic and less soluble than others.
In vivo microdialysis
In vivo microdialysis was used to assess brain interstitial fluid
(interstitial fluid) amyloid-b40 half-life in awake mice as previ-
ously described (Castellano et al., 2011). Briefly, unilateral
guide cannula were implanted into the hippocampus and
used to insert a 2 mm microdialysis probe (38 kDa molecular
weight cut-off, BR-2, Bioanalytical Systems). Artificial CSF
containing 0.15% BSA was used as perfusion buffer. Hourly
interstitial fluid samples were collected for 6 h, using a 1 ml/min
flow rate to determine basal level of interstitial fluid amyloid-b,
prior to the administration of compound E by intraperitoneal
injection (20 mg/kg body weight). After compound E adminis-
tration, which is a �-secretase inhibitor that prevents further
amyloid-b production, samples were collected hourly for a fur-
ther 6 h. Levels of amyloid-b40 were determined for each time-
point using a sandwich ELISA (anti-amyloid-b35–40 HJ2 cap-
ture antibody and anti-amyloid-b13–18 HJ5.1-biotin as detect-
ing
antibody).
The
elimination
of
amyloid-b
from
the
interstitial fluid followed first-order kinetics; therefore, for
each mouse, t1/2 for amyloid-b was calculated with the
slope, k0, of the linear regression that included all fractions
until the concentration of amyloid-b stopped decreasing (t1/
2 = 0.693/k, where k = 2.303k0; Castellano et al., 2011).
Immunohistochemistry of mouse
brain
The brains were immersion fixed in 10% buffered formal

prior to being processed to wax (Leica ASP300S tissue proces-
sor). The blocks were trimmed laterally from the midline by
�0.9–1.4 mm to give a sagittal section of the hippocampal
formation. Two 4 mm sections 40-mm apart were analysed.
The sections were pretreated with 98% formic acid for
8 min, then antigen retrieval was undertaken by incubation
for 30 min in Tris boric acid EDTA buffer (pH 9.0). Slides
were then blocked prior to the application of directly biotiny-

against
either
full-length APP (22C11, MAB348B, Millipore, 1:3000), or
amyloid-b (82E1, IBL, 0.2 mg/ml) for 8 h. This was followed
by treatment with the Ventana DABMapTM kit (iView DAB,
Ventana Medical Systems) using a Ventana XT automated
stainer (Ventana Medical Systems). Alternatively, for staining
of amyloid-b, slides were incubated with mouse monoclonal
6F/3D (Dako 1:50) followed by iVIEWTM Ig secondary anti-
body (Ventana Medical Systems). The sections were counter-
stained with haematoxylin, scanned (Leica SCN400F scanner)
and analysed using Definiens software. 6F/3D stained slides
were photographed (ImageView II 3.5 Mpix digital camera)
and composed with Adobe Photoshop so that the entire
cortex could be analysed. The same thresholds for staining
intensity were then used to quantify the area covered by

scorers, using the counting objects feature of ImageJ.
Behavioural study design
Cohort A was longitudinally tested in the following order: test
1, spontaneous alternation in the T-maze at 2–3 months of
age; test 2, spontaneous alternation in the T-maze at 6–7
months of age; test 3, spatial novelty preference in the Y-
maze at 6–7 months of age; test 4, habituation to an open
field at 6–7 months of age; test 5, spontaneous alternation in
the T-maze at 15–16 months of age. Cohort A was batched
into two groups to facilitate testing (batch i and ii). Cohort B
was tested at 2–3 months of age in the spatial novelty prefer-
ence Y-maze task only, before being aged to 15 months. All
behavioural testing was undertaken between 8.30 and 16.30 h
(light 7.00–19.00 and dark 19.00–7.00). Cohorts A and B
were tested at independent facilities, such that site of test com-
pounded analysis of effect of age in the Y-maze task.
Spontaneous alternation in the
T
-maze
A T-shaped maze made of wood painted dark grey with
30 � 10 � 29 cm arms, with a central partition extending
7 cm into the start arm from the back of the maze, was used
to assess spontaneous alternation as previously described
(Deacon and Rawlins, 2006). Mice were placed into the
maze facing the wall of the start arm and allowed to make a
free choice of either goal arm. The mouse was then restricted
to that goal arm for 30 s by use of a guillotine door. The
central partition was then removed and all doors reopened.
The mouse was again placed at the end of the start arm
facing the wall and allowed to make a further free choice of
either goal arm. This was performed twice a day, once prior to
12.30 and once after 12.30 for 8 days, with an approximate
interval of 4 h between the two daily sessions. Whether or not
the animal chose the novel arm on the second run was re-
corded and summed across 16 trials.
Spatial novelty preference Y
-maze
task
Spatial
novelty
preference
was
assessed
in
an
enclosed
Perspex� Y-maze as described previously (Sanderson et al.,
2007).
Briefly,
a
Perspex�
Y-maze
with
arms
of
30 � 8 � 20 cm was placed into a room containing a variety
of extra-maze cues. Mice were assigned two arms (the ‘start’
and the ‘other’ arm) to which they were exposed during the
first phase (the exposure phase), for 5 min. This selection of
arms was counterbalanced with respect to genotype. Timing of
the 5-min period began only once the mouse had left the start
arm. The mouse was then removed from the maze and re-
turned to its home cage for a 1-min interval between the ex-
posure and test phases. During the test phase, mice were
allowed free access to all three arms. Mice were placed at
the end of the start arm and allowed to explore all three
arms for 2 min beginning once they had left the start arm.
An entry into an arm was defined by a mouse placing all
four paws inside the arm. Similarly, a mouse was considered
to have left an arm if all four paws were placed outside the
arm. The times that mice spent in each arm were recorded
manually and a novelty preference ratio was calculated for
the time spent in arms [novel arm / (novel + other arm)].
Habituation to an open field
Mice were habituated to a grey arena (40 � 40 � 40 cm) under
low light levels (20 lx), for 10 min/day on three consecutive
days [at a similar time each day (�30 min)]. Distance travelled
was measured using EthoVision. The ‘outer’ zone was defined
as 10 cm from the edge of the box and the inner zone as the
20 cm2 area in the centre.
Results
Trisomy of chromosome 21 genes
other than APP promotes the
deposition of amyloid-b
Having three copies of chromosome 21 genes other than
APP may influence the development of Alzheimer’s disease
in people who have Down syndrome. This is partly based
on mouse studies using single gene overexpression models,
rather than animal models that are aneuploid (Wiseman
et al., 2015). To take an unbiased approach and investigate
if triplication of genes other than APP can modulate the
development
of
Down
syndrome–Alzheimer’s
disease
in vivo, we crossed a model of Down syndrome that is
aneuploid for chromosome 21 with a mouse that deposits
amyloid-b in the brain. Thus, we have generated a new
model system to understand the early stages of Down syn-
drome–Alzheimer’s
disease,
when
amyloid-b
starts
to
accumulate.
The Down syndrome mouse was the Tc(Hsa21)1TybEmcf
(Tc1) model (O’Doherty et al., 2005), which carries a freely
segregating chromosome 21 and is trisomic for 75% of the
genes on this chromosome but, importantly, is not function-
ally triplicated for APP (Sheppard et al., 2012; Gribble et al.,
2013). As with a small percentage of Down syndrome indi-
viduals, the mouse is mosaic; on average �66% of brain
nuclei (neurons and glia) retain chromosome 21 (O’Doherty
et al., 2005). This model has well-defined Down syndrome-
associated deficits, including defects in nervous system func-
tion such as in long-term potentiation, short-term memory,
dendritic spine morphology and connectivity in the hippo-
campus (O’Doherty et al., 2005; Morice et al., 2008;
Witton et al., 2015; Hall et al., 2016).
To determine if trisomy of chromosome 21 sequences
other than APP is sufficient to modify Alzheimer’s disease-
related phenotypes, we crossed Tc1 mice with the APP
transgenic mouse strain Tg(PDGFB-APPSwInd)20Lms (J20-
tgAPP). J20-tgAPP mice overexpress a human APP transgene
with Alzheimer’s disease mutations and accumulates amyl-
oid-b within the brain from �4–5 months of age (Mucke
et al., 2000). This model has been widely used to study

 amyloid
deposition. Our
‘trisomic � tgAPP’ (Tc1 � J20-
tgAPP) cross is an in vivo model system that allows us to
investigate if amyloid deposition (from the tgAPP transgene)
is modified in the presence of an additional copy of human
chromosome 21, by producing four types of progeny: (i)
wild-types; (ii) those inheriting the APP transgene only
(‘tgAPP’); (iii) those inheriting human chromosome 21 only
(‘trisomic’); and (iv) those that inherit both the APP trans-
gene and human chromosome 21 (‘trisomic;tgAPP’).
We observed that early intracellular amyloid-b deposition
within the CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus was
significantly enhanced by trisomy of chromosome 21 at
4.5–6.5 months of age in trisomic;tgAPP mice compared
to tgAPP littermates (Fig. 1A and B). This is consistent
with the site of earliest deposition of amyloid-b occurring
intracellularly in the brains of people who have Down syn-
drome (Lemere et al., 1996; Mori et al., 2002; Cataldo
et al., 2004). A similar but non-significant increase in amyl-
oid-b accumulation within trisomic;tgAPP granular cells of
the dentate gyrus and in the cortex was also observed, but
no change in full-length APP could be detected using simi-
lar methods (Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with this
we saw a trend for an increase in the abundance of soluble
aggregated amyloid-b, as measured by a multimeric amyl-
oid-b ELISA, at 2 months of age in trisomic;tgAPP hippo-
campus as compared with tgAPP littermates (Fig. 1C).
We quantified plaque number at 6 and 16 months of age
in the hippocampus in the trisomic � tgAPP model system.
Trisomic;tgAPP progeny had significantly more extracellu-
lar plaques at both ages than tgAPP littermates (Fig. 1D–
H).
Similarly,
the
area
of
amyloid-b
deposition
was
significantly greater in trisomic;tgAPP hippocampus and
cortex compared with tgAPP controls at 16 months of
age (Fig. 1I and Supplementary Fig. 2).
Trisomy of chromosome 21 genes
other than APP does not alter the
ratio of amyloid-b isoforms that
aggregate
To determine which forms of amyloid-b peptide have
increased deposition in the trisomic;tgAPP model, cortical
proteins from 6- and 16-month-old animals were biochem-
ically fractionated by homogenization in progressively more
chemically disruptive solutions followed by ultracentrifuga-
tion (Tris buffer; then 1% TritonTM X-100; then 5 M guan-
idine hydrochloride) (Shankar et al., 2009). The abundance
of amyloid-b42, amyloid-b40 and amyloid-b38 in each frac-
tion was then determined (Fig. 2A–C and Supplementary
Fig. 3). At 16 months of age more amyloid-b42 was
observed in the least soluble fraction (5 M guanidine hydro-
chloride) in trisomic;tgAPP compared with tgAPP controls,
as measured using two independent assays (Fig. 2C and
Supplementary Fig. 3F). No changes in the amyloid-b40/42
or amyloid-b38/42 ratios were observed in the aggregated
(5 M guanidine hydrochloride soluble) fraction at either 6
or 16 months of age (Fig. 2D, E and Supplementary Fig. 3).
Consistent with this observation, we found no difference in
the relative abundance of amyloid-b species, as determined
by mass spectrometry, between trisomic;tgAPP and tgAPP
in the 5 M guanidine hydrochloride fraction isolated from
16-month-old cortex (Fig. 2F). Thus, trisomy of chromo-
some 21 sequences other than APP, are sufficient to greatly
increase intracellular and extracellular amyloid-b depos-
ition independently of changing the ratio of amyloid-b
that aggregates.
Trisomy of chromosome 21 genes
other than APP exacerbates APP/
amyloid-b associated cognitive
deficits
To determine if the chromosome 21 trisomy-associated in-
crease in amyloid-b aggregation contributes to changes in
APP/amyloid-b-associated cognitive deficits, a series of be-
havioural tests were undertaken on cohorts of wild-type,
trisomic, tgAPP and trisomic;tgAPP littermates. These ex-
periments were designed to avoid potential floor effects in
test performance; so any interaction between the influence
of trisomy and tgAPP status could be identified. Therefore
tasks in which the trisomic mice had near-wild-type per-
formance were used. This approach is also being developed
to improve the assessment of cognitive decline in adults
who have Down syndrome (Startin et al., 2016). Trisomy
of chromosome 21 significantly exacerbated APP/amyloid-
b-associated hyperactivity at both 2–3 and 6–7 months of
age, and trisomic;tgAPP animals specifically failed to ha-
bituate to an open field at 6–7 months of age (Fig. 3A–C
and Supplementary Fig. 4A and B). Typical habituation, as
measured by a decline in activity caused by increased fa-
miliarity with the new environment, was observed in wild-
type, trisomic and tgAPP littermates (Fig. 3B). In this task
we also observed that both trisomic and trisomic;tgAPP
mice spent significantly more time in the centre of the
open
field
than
wild-type
or
tgAPP
animals
(Supplementary Fig. 4C). However, trisomic;tgAPP mice
did not spend any additional time in the centre of the
field compared with trisomic controls. Both groups of ani-
mals spent �20% of the time available in the centre of the
field thus a ceiling effect is not biasing this task. These data
suggest the failure to habituate in the trisomic;tgAPP is not
driven by a modification of anxiety. We note that this task
was not designed to measure anxiety; the open field and
lighting conditions were designed to be non-anxious.
However, these data indicate the Tc1-trisomic mice may
have lower anxiety than wild-type controls, and further
tests are warranted to explore this.
To understand the observed failure to habituate in the
trisomic;tgAPP mice further, we undertook two tests of
immediate memory. For the Y-maze task, two independent
cohorts of mice were tested, one at 2–3 months of age and
one at 6–7 months of age. The effect of genotype was

 similar in both cohorts so they were combined for ana-
lysis. For the T-maze task, one cohort of mice was tested
longitudinally, at 2–3 months, 6–7 months and 15–16
months of age. We note that the performance of wild-
type mice declined with age in this task, as has been pre-
viously reported (Lalonde, 2002). No deficit as measured
by spatial novelty preference in the Y-maze (1-min trial
interval) was observed in tgAPP or trisomic mice (Fig.

 3D). However, trisomic;tgAPP mice had a poorer test per-
formance than wild-type and trisomic animals in this task,
such that a main effect of trisomy of chromosome 21 and
of tgAPP was observed, and a significant interaction of
these genetic factors was seen (Fig. 3D). Although some
residual memory was retained, as trisomic;tgAPP had
above chance performance in the task at the three ages
studied. The poorer performance of trisomic;tgAPP was
apparent despite these animals having a greater opportun-
ity to experience extra-maze cues during the training
phase than trisomic controls because of a greater time
spent in the training (other) arm during the initial expos-
ure to the maze (Supplementary Fig. 4B). An independent
immediate memory task, a discrete-trial spontaneous alter-
nation in the T-maze, was used to validate these observa-
tions. In this task, a main effect of chromosome 21
trisomy and an interaction of trisomy with tgAPP was
observed by ANOVA, such that trisomic;tgAPP mice per-
formed the task significantly worse than wild-type con-
trols (Fig. 3E). Consistent with our observations in the
Y-maze task, some residual memory was retained, as
trisomic;tgAPP did have above chance performance at
the three ages studied.
These data show that trisomy chromosome 21 exacer-
bates APP/amyloid-b associated cognitive changes, and
that
trisomic;tgAPP
mice
exhibit
specific
immediate
memory deficits in two tasks compared to the matched
controls.
Additionally,
trisomic;tgAPP
mice
were
less
likely to survive to 15 months of age than matched
tgAPP control animals (Supplementary Fig. 4D). Thus, the
chromosome 21 trisomy-associated increase in amyloid-b
accumulation described here correlates with changes in
multiple tests of cognition and is associated with an
increased risk of mortality.
Trisomy of chromosome 21 genes
other than APP does not alter APP or
b-CTF/a-CTF ratio in the brain
To determine if a change in the abundance of APP in the
brain of trisomic mice contributes to the increase in amyl-
oid-b aggregation, we compared levels of full-length APP in
Figure 2 Trisomy of chromosome 21 promotes the aggregation of amyloid-b. (A–F) Cortical proteins from 16-month-old mice were

 deposition (Haass et al., 2012). Cleavage of full-length APP
by b-secretase generates soluble b-APP and a membrane
bound b-C-terminal fragment (b-CTF), which can then be
cleaved by �-secretases, forming amyloid-b. Whereas cleav-
age of APP by an �-secretase, produces soluble �-APP and
�-C-terminal-fragment (�-CTF), in a process that prevents
b-cleavage and hence the formation of amyloid-b. We
found that chromosome 21 trisomy causes a significant in-
crease in both �- and b-CTFs relative to full-length APP, in
both the hippocampus and cortex at 3 months of age in
male mice (Fig. 4B and C). However, no significant change
in �- or b-CTF/full-length APP ratios occurs in female mice
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Moreover, trisomy of chromosome
21 did not alter the b-CTF/�-CTF ratio in either sex in the
cortex or hippocampus (Fig. 4D). This indicates that al-
though trisomy of chromosome 21 increases APP-CTF
abundance in males, it does not alter the relative balance
of the amylogenic versus non-amylogenic APP processing
pathway in the brain. Additionally, trisomy-associated in-
creases in amyloid-b accumulation are observed in both
males and females, suggesting that the specific effect of
trisomy in male mice on APP-CTF abundance is unlikely
to be the cause of enhanced amyloid-b deposition observed
in our mouse model system.
Trisomy of chromosome 21 genes
other than APP does not elevate
APP-CTF production
To determine if the elevation in APP-CTFs in males is
caused by an increased rate of CTF-production; we ana-
lysed the abundance of soluble b-APP, the other APP frag-
ment
produced
by
b-secretase
activity.
Trisomy
of
chromosome 21 did not alter the abundance of soluble b-
APP in the cortex of the Tc1 mouse (Fig. 5A), indicating
that the production of b-CTF is not upregulated in vivo by
trisomy of chromosome 21. Consistent with this, BACE1
level and BACE1-b-secretase activity (as measured by a
BACE1 capture enzymatic assay) were not altered by tri-
somy at 3 months of age, in the cortex (Fig. 5B–D).
Similarly, trisomy of Hsa21 did not affect levels of soluble
�-APP in the cortex at 3 months of age (Fig. 5E).

(A, B and D) Full-length APP (FL-APP), APP b-CTF and APP �-CTF were measured in cortex (wild-type n = 17, trisomic n = 16, tgAPP n = 24,
trisomic;tgAPP n = 19) and hippocampus (wild-type n = 11, trisomic n = 12, tgAPP n = 24, trisomic;tgAPP n = 17) at 3 months of age. (A) Full-
length APP was higher in tgAPP and trisomic;tgAPP compared with wild-type or trisomic mice [cortex F(1,68) = 87.667, P 5 0.001, hippocampus
F(1,56) = 94.301, P 5 0.001]. Trisomy did not alter full-length APP [trisomy–tgAPP interaction, cortex F(1,68) = 0.483, P = 0.489, hippocampus
F(1,56) = 2.457, P = 0.123]. (B and C) In male mice, APP-CTF/full-length APP ratio was altered (cortex tgAPP n = 17, trisomic;tgAPP n = 11,

APP (t-test cortex P = 0.005 hippocampus P 5 0.001). (D) Trisomy did not alter the b-CTF/�-CTF ratio in the cortex [trisomy F(1,37) = 0.065,
P = 0.799] or hippocampus [trisomy F(1,37) = 1.082, P = 0.305]. (B) Cropped western blot, four lanes of an eight-lane gel. Data are represented as

 Therefore, the elevated b-CTF and �-CTF/full-length APP
ratios observed in male trisomic;tgAPP compared with
tgAPP male controls are likely the result of impaired
turn-over of these fragments.
Trisomy of chromosome 21 does not
alter the extracellular clearance of
amyloid-b
The increase in abundance of b-CTF and �-CTF in trisomic
male mice indicates that trisomy of chromosome 21 may
alter the clearance of APP derivatives in some circum-
stances. To determine if trisomy causes increased amyl-
oid-b aggregation by impairing clearance of the peptide
in vivo, we measured the half-life of extracellular amyl-
oid-b40 in the hippocampus at 3 months of age by micro-
dialysis of interstitial fluid. To follow amyloid-b clearance
kinetics in vivo, a potent inhibitor of �-secretase (com-
pound E) was injected to halt amyloid-b generation.
Chromosome 21 trisomy did not significantly alter amyl-
oid-b40 half-life (Fig. 6A and B), nor did it alter the
expression of the key amyloid-b extracellular clearance en-
zymes, insulin degrading enzyme and neprilysin in the brain
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus changes in the extracellular
clearance of amyloid-b do not contribute to trisomy-asso-
ciated increases in deposition.
Trisomy of chromosome 21 genes
other than APP causes a shift in the
soluble amyloid-b40/42 ratio
The aggregation rate of amyloid-b in vitro is influenced by
the relative abundance of more aggregate prone amyloid-b
species, such as amyloid-b42, compared with forms of the
peptide, which are less able to seed aggregation such as
amyloid-b40 (Vandersteen et al., 2012). To determine if
chromosome 21 trisomy associated increases in amyloid-b
deposition are the result of changes in the ratio of amyloid-
b species in vivo, we investigated the relative abundance of
soluble amyloid-b prior to accumulation of detectable
amyloid-b deposits in the hippocampus of 2–3-month-old
progeny
from
the
trisomic � tgAPP
cross.

 Tris-soluble total hippocampal amyloid-b42 were not af-
fected by trisomy, but a significant decrease in both tris-
soluble amyloid-b38 and amyloid-b40 was observed, leading
to a significant decrease in the soluble amyloid-b38/42 and
amyloid-b40/42 ratios (Fig. 7A–C). Moreover the soluble
amyloid-b40/42 ratio significantly correlates with amyloid-b
aggregation in young hippocampus, as measured using a
multimeric amyloid-b ELISA (Fig. 7D), indicating that the
effect of trisomy on soluble amyloid-b ratios may underlie
the increased accumulation of the peptide observed within
the brain.
Trisomy of chromosome 21 genes
other than APP does not alter intrin-
sic �-secretase carboxypeptidase
activity
Impairment of �-secretase carboxypeptidase activity, such
as is caused by some familial Alzheimer’s disease mutations
in APP or PSEN1 or PSEN2, can result in similar changes
to the amyloid-b isoform ratios (Chavez-Gutierrez et al.,
2012). We isolated a membrane fraction containing �-
secretase from the cortex of our mouse model and used
this for an in vitro enzymatic activity assay using a recom-
binant APP-CTF substrate. No change in �-secretase car-
boxypeptidase activity was detected in the trisomic mouse
model (Fig. 7E and F). Similarly using the same method, no
difference in enzymatic activity was observed in people who
have Down syndrome–Alzheimer’s disease compared with
aged-matched
healthy
controls
(Fig.
7G,
H,
and
Supplementary Table 1). Trisomy of chromosome 21 there-
fore alters the amyloid-b ratio in vivo independently of a
direct effect on �-secretase activity.
Discussion
The extra copy of APP, encoded on chromosome 21, has a
central role in Down syndrome-Alzheimer’s disease patho-
genesis. This includes increasing the level of APP protein
and its derivatives, such as amyloid-b, and causing specific
alteration to endolysosomal biology (Lemere et al., 1996;
Salehi et al., 2006; Cheon et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2010).
Here we show that in addition, trisomy of other chromo-
some 21 sequences is sufficient to promote the aggregation
and deposition of amyloid-b within the brain and worsen
associated-cognitive deficits. Our data suggest that the in-
crease in amyloid-b aggregation caused by trisomy of
chromosome 21 may be mediated by an alteration in the
ratio of soluble amyloid-b isoforms that occurs independ-
ently of alterations in the activity of �-, b- or �- secretases,
or a change in the rate of extracellular clearance of amyl-
oid-b.
Our research uses animal models created to study Down
syndrome and amyloid-b accumulation, to investigate the
effect of triplication of chromosome 21 genes on amyloid-b
generation and deposition within the brain. As with all work
using animal models, it is essential to recognize that each model
gives us a limited view of a complex human disease. Down
syndrome mouse models in which App is triplicated [e.g.
Ts65Dn or Dp(10)1Yey;Dp(16)1Yey;Dp(17)1Yey triple triso-
mic mice] do not form amyloid-b plaques even in elderly
mice (26 months) (Reeves et al., 1995; Yu et al., 2010).
Thus, to understand the development of amyloid pathology
in the context of chromosome 21 trisomy we work with a
widely-used transgenic APP mouse model. This model overex-
presses human APP with Alzheimer’s disease associated point
mutations, which promote the formation of aggregation prone
amyloid-b42,
and
develops
robust
amyloid
pathology.
Therefore in this model system, the relative abundance of amyl-
oid-b42 is higher than would be typically observed in individ-
uals who have Down syndrome.
We crossed the tgAPP mouse with the Tc1 mouse model
of Down syndrome that contains a freely-segregating copy
of human chromosome 21. This model system allows us to
address whether the additional copy of the chromosome 21
genes carried in the Tc1 mouse are sufficient to alter amyl-
oid-b
generation,
deposition
and
associated
cognitive
changes. However, we note that as with all models of
Down syndrome (including the triple trisomics) (Yu et al.,
2010), the Tc1 mouse does not have the full complement of
chromosome 21 sequences (Gribble et al., 2013). Indeed,
here we have taken advantage of the absence of an add-
itional copy of APP in this model to investigate APP trip-
lication-independent effects. Within the Tc1 mouse model
the transchromosome is lost during development from
some cells; we previously determined that �66% of brain
nuclei retain the chromosome (O’Doherty et al., 2005).

 defects and reduced mortality compared to matched cases
of non-mosaic
chromosome 21
trisomy
(Papavassiliou
et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2013). Similarly, in the Tc1
mouse, mosaicism may result in a reduction in phenotypic
severity compared with that in non-mosaic Down syn-
drome
model
systems.
Further
studies
in
alternative
mouse models of Down syndrome that are not mosaic, in
particular mice with segmental duplications of the mouse
genome orthologous to regions of human chromosome 21,
may help investigate this (Brault et al., 2006; Yu et al.,
2010; Lana-Elola et al., 2011, 2016).
Our results demonstrate that a number of cognitive
changes are observed in trisomic;tgAPP mice compared to
wild-type controls. In particular, these mice display a pro-
found hyperactivity, a failure to habituate to a novel open-
field,
and
poorer
immediate
memory
than
wild-type
controls. These changes may relate to the increase in amyl-
oid-b aggregation observed in these mice or how trisomic
neurons respond to aggregating amyloid-b. Further studies,
in which a trisomic model and wild-type control are
exposed to equal quantity of amyloid-b are required to
understand the mechanisms that cause the changes in cog-
nition observed in our study.
Our findings suggest a number of new avenues of inquiry
that warrant further investigation. Our work indicates that
people who have Down syndrome may have exacerbated
amyloid accumulation compared with individuals who have
early-onset Alzheimer’s disease caused by duplication of
APP. Comparative pathological studies of the two causes
of early-onset disease are required to investigate this

 hypothesis. Notably, comparative studies of Alzheimer’s
disease in people who have Down syndrome and sporadic
Alzheimer’s disease have suggested that higher levels of
aggregated amyloid-b accumulate in people who have
Down syndrome (Hyman et al., 1995; Egensperger et al.,
1999; Wilcock et al., 2015), consistent with the finding in
our mouse model system presented here. If amyloid depos-
ition is found to be higher in people who have Down syn-
drome, understanding which gene on chromosome 21 other
than APP contributes to this will provide novel insights
into disease development and may provide a new target
for drug therapy for individuals who have Down syn-
drome, who are at extraordinarily high risk of developing
dementia.
Alzheimer’s disease in people who have Down syndrome
first
presents
with
memory
impairment,
behavioural
changes, myoclonus and seizures; with a low incidence of
cerebral haemorrhage and stroke. A recent review has
noted that this pattern of clinical presentation is more simi-
lar to that seen in familial cases of Alzheimer’s disease
caused by mutations in APP that decrease amyloid-b40/42
ratio, than to cases of diseases caused by duplication of
APP (Zis and Strydom, 2018). The authors hypothesized
that a shift to a lower amyloid-b40/42 ratio in people who
have Down syndrome might explain this apparent clinical
disparity. Our animal work supports this hypothesis and
suggests further studies of the ratio of amyloid-b40/42 in
people who have Down syndrome, particularly at the ear-
liest stages of disease is warranted.
We first observe a significant increase in amyloid-b accu-
mulation within CA3 pyramidal hippocampal neurons of
our mouse model (Fig. 1B). A previous study using the Tc1
mouse showed that the CA3 has a particular vulnerability
to trisomy of chromosome 21, which includes a specific
reduction in synapse number, alterations to synapse archi-
tecture and related electrophysiological and behavioural
deficits (Witton et al., 2015). The sensitivity of the CA3
to trisomy of chromosome 21 is also observed in an alter-
native Down syndrome mouse model (Popov et al., 2011).
The specific effect of trisomy of chromosome 21 on the
synapses of CA3 cells may contribute to their vulnerability
to intracellular amyloid-b accumulation, as the synapse is
proposed to be a key site of amyloid-b formation (Das
et al., 2013). Further work is required to determine if
CA3 pyramidal cells in people who have Down syndrome
also have a similar tendency to develop intracellular amyl-
oid-b accumulation and the molecular changes that are re-
sponsible for this.
Additionally, this work also demonstrates that factors
other than the intrinsic carboxypeptidase activity of the
�-secretase complex or the APP protein sequence can sub-
stantially alter the ratio of amyloid-b isoforms generated
in vivo. Moreover, we show that an extra dose of a gene
or genes encoded on chromosome 21 is sufficient to modu-
late this process. Identification of these gene/genes will pro-
vide novel insights into the pathways that can alter
amyloid-b generation and how these processes could be
modulated to prevent disease.
A number of proteins encoded on chromosome 21 have
been suggested to influence amyloid-b biology and are tri-
somic in the Tc1 mouse model. These include SUMO3,
which is conjugated to proteins to regulate their function
and may influence APP processing (Li et al., 2003; Dorval
et al., 2007). The kinase DYRK1A can phosphorylate APP
and alter the protein’s stability and the formation of amyl-
oid-b (Ryoo et al., 2008; Garcia-Cerro et al., 2017).
Recently, a novel inhibitor of DYRK1A has been shown
to reduce amyloid-b plaque load in an Alzheimer’s disease
mouse model (Branca et al., 2017). BACE2, a homologue
of BACE1 located on chromosome 21 may impair the for-
mation of amyloid-b by cleaving APP within the amyloid-b
region (Sun et al., 2006; Mok et al., 2014). An endogenous
inhibitor of lysosomal cathepsins, CSTB, which reduces
amyloid-b accumulation when knocked-out, is also found
on chromosome 21 (Yang et al., 2011). Reduced activity of
the enzymes inhibited by CSTB have been linked to altered
clearance of amyloid-b and processing of APP; including a
shift in the amyloid-b40/42 ratio (Mueller-Steiner et al.,
2006; Hook et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015).
Moreover, recent studies have highlighted that alterations
in �-secretase trafficking or modulation of the endo-lyso-
some system can profoundly affect amyloid-b generation
(Xiao et al., 2015; Sannerud et al., 2016); other as yet
unidentified gene/genes on chromosome 21 may affect
these processes and mediate the effect of trisomy on amyl-
oid-b ratios, aggregation and deposition observed here.
Identification of the causal gene(s) on chromosome 21
will provide further novel insights into the new Down syn-
drome–Alzheimer’s disease mechanism described in this
study.
