Abstract
Purpose: Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) is a compo-
nent of the human microbiome that primarily inhabits the oral
cavity. It causes periodontal disease and has also been implicated
in the development of human cancers. Although there are several
reports of the relationship between F. nucleatum and the clinical
outcome in human cancers, its prognostic significance in esoph-
ageal cancer remains unclear.
Experimental Design: We quantified F. nucleatum DNA in
325 resected esophageal cancer specimens by qPCR. Signif-
icant pathways in F. nucleatum–positive esophageal cancer
tissues were identified by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes
(KEGG)
enrichment
analysis
using
microarray
data.
Results: Esophageal cancer tissues contained significantly more
F. nucleatum DNA than matched normal esophageal mucosa (P ¼
0.021; n ¼ 60). F. nucleatum DNA was detected in 74 of 325 cases
(23%). F. nucleatum DNA positivity was significantly associated
with tumor stage, but not with sex, age, performance status,
tobacco use, alcohol use, histology, tumor location, or preoper-
ative treatment. F. nucleatum DNA positivity was also significantly
associated with cancer-specific survival [log-rank P ¼ 0.0039;
univariate HR ¼ 2.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22–
3.23; P ¼ 0.0068; multivariate HR ¼ 1.78; 95% CI, 1.06–2.94;
P ¼ 0.031]. The top-ranked KEGG pathway in F. nucleatum–
positive tissues was "cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction." A
significant relationship between F. nucleatum and the chemokine
CCL20 was validated by IHC.
Conclusions: F. nucleatum in esophageal cancer tissues was
associated with shorter survival, suggesting a potential role as a
prognostic biomarker. F. nucleatum might also contribute to
aggressive tumor behavior through activation of chemokines,
such as CCL20. Clin Cancer Res; 22(22); 5574–81. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Esophageal cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-
related death in men and the eighth most common in women
worldwide (1). Despite the development of multimodal thera-
pies, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and che-
moradiotherapy, the prognosis of patients, including those who
undergo complete resection, remains poor (2–4). Further studies
are therefore needed to clarify the pathogenesis of esophageal
cancer and to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic possibili-
ties. In addition, the identification of new prognostic or predictive
markers for esophageal cancer could improve the use of risk-
adapted treatment strategies and help to stratify patients for drugs
targeting these tumor characteristics in future clinical trials.
Research into the microbiome is a rapidly advancing field in
human cancers (5–7). More than 100 trillion bacteria inhabit the
human body and form their own flora (microbiome) in individ-
ual organs. The gut microbiome has recently been shown to play
an important role in health, as well as in diseases, such as obesity
(8, 9), inflammatory bowel disease (10, 11), diabetes (12, 13),
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (14, 15), and several types of
cancers. Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum; a non–spore-form-
ing, anaerobic gram-negative bacterium) is part of the normal
flora in the human oral cavity, vagina, and gastrointestinal muco-
sa(16). Itisrecognized as a pathogen in periodontal diseases (17),
chorioamnionitis (18), and inflammatory bowel disease (10, 19).
Regarding the association between F. nucleatum and gastroenter-
ological cancers, metagenomic analysis has shown an overabun-
dance of F. nucleatum in colorectal cancer tissues (20, 21).
F. nucleatum has also been shown to activate the WNT/b-catenin
signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cells, and to potentially
promote tumor growth (22). Recent studies reported that high
levels of F. nucleatum DNA were linked to a poor prognosis in
human cancers (23, 24), whereas others reported no association
between F. nucleatum DNA levels and patient survival (Supple-
mentary Table S1; refs. 20, 25). However, no studies to date have
examined the prognostic impact of F. nucleatum in esophageal
cancer tissues.

 In this study, we quantified F. nucleatum DNA in 325 samples of
resected esophageal cancer by qPCR and examined its prognostic
value. We also clarified the mechanism whereby F. nucleatum may
confer a poor prognosis by enrichment analysis of Kyoto Ency-
clopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The results of
this study suggest that F. nucleatum may have a potential role as a
prognostic biomarker in esophageal cancer.
Materials and Methods
Study group
We analyzed 325 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
esophageal cancer specimens from consecutive patients under-
going resection at Kumamoto University Hospital (Kumamoto,
Japan) between April 2005 and June 2013. Tumor staging was
carried out according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
Staging Manual (7th edition; ref. 26). The vast majority of cases
were diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); there were
300 cases (92%) of SCC, 12 (3.7%) of adenocarcinoma, and 13
(4.0%) of others. A total of 117 received preoperative treatment
[73 chemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil either with or without
docetaxel) 44 chemoradiotherapy]. Patients were observed at 1- to
3-month intervals until death or January 31, 2016, whichever
came first. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the
date of surgery to the date of death. Cancer-specific survival was
defined as the time from the date of surgery and the date of death
attributable to esophageal cancer. Written informed consent was
obtained from each subject, and the study procedures were
approved by the Institutional Review Board. The term "prognostic
marker" is used throughout this article according to the REMARK
guidelines (27).
DNA extraction and qPCR for F. nucleatum
Genomic DNA was extracted from FFPE esophageal cancer
tissues using a QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen). We
determined the amount of F. nucleatum DNA by qPCR assay.
The nus G gene of F. nucleatum and the reference human gene
SLCO2A1 were amplified using custom-made TaqMan primer/
probe
sets
(Applied
Biosystems).
The
primer and
probe
sequences for each Custom TaqMan Gene Expression Assay were
as follows: F. nucleatum forward primer, 50-TGGTGTCATTCTTC-
CAAAAATATCA-30; F. nucleatum reverse primer, 50-AGATCAA-
GAAGGACAAGTTGCTGAA-30; F. nucleatum FAM probe, 50-AC-
TTTAACTCTACCATGTTCA-30; SLCO2A1 forward primer, 50-
ATCCCCAAAGCACCTGGTTT-30; SLCO2A1 reverse primer, 50-
AGAGGCCAAGATAGTCCTGGTAA-30; SLCO2A1 VIC probe, 50-
CCATCCATGTCCTCATCTC-30. Assays were performed in a 384-
well optical PCR plate. DNA was amplified and detected using a
LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche) under the following
reaction conditions: initial denaturation at 95�C for 10 minutes,
15 seconds at 95�C, and 60 seconds at 60�C. The amount of
F. nucleatum DNA in each tissue was normalized relative to
SLCO2A1 (28).
Immunohistochemical staining
FFPE tissue was serially sectioned at 3 to 5 mm, dewaxed,
deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated through a series of
graded alcohols. The samples were boiled for 15 minutes in a
microwave oven in Histofine (pH ¼ 9.0; Nichirei) to increase
antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked by 3%
hydrogen peroxidase treatment for 30 minutes. The slides were
incubated with primary antibody (1:50 dilution of rabbit mAb for
macrophage inflammatory protein 3a (CC-chemokine cysteine
motif chemokine ligand 20, CCL20; ab9829; Abcam) overnight at
4�C. Detection was performed with a biotin-free horseradish
peroxidase–labeled polymer of the Envision Plus detection sys-
tem (Dako). The sections were developed in 3,3-diaminobenzi-
dine and counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin. The slides were
then dehydrated through graded alcohols and covered with cover-
slips. Staining intensity and percentage of CCL20-positive tumor
cells were assessed. The extent of staining was categorized semi-
quantitatively, based on the percentage of positive tumor cells: 0
(�5% positive cells), 1 (6%–25% positive cells), 2 (26%–50%
positive cells), 3 (51%–75% positive cells), and 4 (>75% positive
cells). The intensities of cytoplasmic and membrane staining were
also determined semiquantitatively as follows: 0 (negative), 1
(weakly positive), 2 (moderately positive), and 3 (strongly pos-
itive). The scores of sections were defined as "extent of staining �
intensity."
Microarray and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
Total RNA was isolated from frozen sections of 10 esophageal
cancer biopsy specimens using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Gene expression microarray analysis was carried out using Sur-
ePrint G3 Human GE Microarray 8 � 60K Ver. 2.0 (Agilent
Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Differ-
entially expressed genes (DEG) were screened by comparing the
RNA expression levels of esophageal cancer specimens between F.
nucleatum–positive and F. nucleatum–negative groups, using
Subio Platform (Subio Inc.). KEGG pathway enrichment analyses
were performed to identify the biological functions and pathways
represented by the identified DEGs using the Database for Anno-
tation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery 6.7 software
(https://david.ncifcrf.gov/; ref. 29).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using JMP, version 10
(SAS Institute). All P values were two-sided. We compared
mean values using Student t tests for age and body mass index,
and c2 or Fisher exact tests for all other variables. Survival time
distribution in the survival analysis was assessed by the
Translational Relevance
Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), which primarily
inhabits the oral cavity, causes periodontal disease. F. nucle-
atum influences the development and progression of colorectal
cancer. Furthermore, the presence of F. nucleatum is associated
with a poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.
However, no studies to date have examined the prognostic
impact of F. nucleatum in esophageal cancer. In this study, we
quantified F. nucleatum DNA in 325 resected esophageal cancer
specimens by qPCR. This is the first study to provide the
evidence for the relationship between F. nucleatum and poor
prognosis in esophageal cancer. In addition, using KEGG
enrichment analysis, we demonstrated that F. nucleatum might
contribute to the acquisition of aggressive tumor behavior
through the activation of chemokines, such as CCL20. Our
data suggest that F. nucleatum DNA status can have a potential
role as a prognostic biomarker.

 Kaplan–Meier method using log-rank tests. We constructed a
multivariate model to compute the HR based on the F. nucle-
atum DNA status, including sex (male vs. female), age at surgery
(<65 vs. �65 years), year of surgery (2005–2009 vs. 2010–
2013), tobacco use (yes vs. no), alcohol use (yes vs. no),
performance status (0 vs. 1–), tumor location (upper vs. lower),
tumor stage (I and II vs. III and IV), and preoperative treatment
(absent vs. present). Interactions were assessed by including the
cross-product of the F. nucleatum DNA status and another
variable of interest in a Cox model.
Results
F. nucleatum in esophageal cancer tissues
We assessed the relative amounts of F. nucleatum DNA in
esophageal cancer tissues by qPCR assay. F. nucleatum DNA levels
were higher in esophageal cancer tissues than in paired adjacent
nontumor tissues (n ¼ 60, P ¼ 0.021; Fig. 1A). We also measured
the relative F. nucleatum DNA levels in cancer tissues from the 325
esophageal cancer cases. F. nucleatum was detected in 74 (23%)
of 325 cases (Fig. 1B). The relative F. nucleatum DNA content
in esophageal cancer tissues ranged from 3.0 � 10�4�2.8 � 100
(median, 2.3 � 10�2).
Relationship between tumor F. nucleatum DNA status and
clinicopathologic features in esophageal cancer
The clinicopathologic features of the 325 cases according to
F. nucleatum status are shown in Table 1. F. nucleatum positivity
was not associated with age, sex, year of operation, preoperative
performance status, smoking history, alcohol history, comorbid-
ity, tumor location, histology, tumor size, or preoperative therapy
(all P > 0.05), but was associated with tumor stage (P ¼ 0.016),
T stage (P < 0.01), and N stage (P ¼ 0.039).
Tumor F. nucleatum DNA status and patient survival
There were 112 deaths among the 325 esophageal cancer
patients, including 75 esophageal cancer-specific deaths. The
median follow-up time for censored patients was 2.6 years.

 According to Kaplan–Meier analysis, F. nucleatum–positive
patients had significantly shorter cancer-specific survival (log-
rank P ¼ 0.0039) and OS (log-rank P ¼ 0.046) compared with
F. nucleatum–negative cases (Fig. 2). We also analyzed F. nucleatum
DNA status by Cox regression analysis. F. nucleatum–positive
patients had significantly higher cancer-specific mortality com-
pared with F. nucleatum–negative patients [HR ¼ 2.01; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 1.22–3.23; P ¼ 0.0068; Table 2]. In the
multivariate Cox model adjusted for clinical, pathologic, and
epidemiologic features, F. nucleatum positivity was associated
with significantly higher cancer-specific mortality (multivariate
HR ¼ 1.78; 95% CI, 1.06–2.94; P ¼ 0.032; Table 2). Similar results
were observed for overall mortality.
Survival analyses of interaction between F. nucleatum and other
variables
We determined whether the influence of F. nucleatum on
cancer-specific survival was modified by any of the clinical,
pathologic, or epidemiologic variables evaluated. The effect of
F. nucleatum was not significantly modified by age, year of
surgery, performance status, tumor location, preoperative treat-
ment, tumor size, or tumor stage (all P > 0.09; Fig. 3). Notably,
we did not observe a modifying effect of the preoperative
treatment on the relationship between F. nucleatum and
cancer-specific survival rate (Pinteraction ¼ 0.58).
Tumor F. nucleatum DNA status and patient survival in
esophageal SCC
SCC is the predominant type of esophageal cancer in the East,
including Japan. We therefore also performed survival analyses,
including only SCC (n ¼ 300). F. nucleatum–positive patients with
SCC had significantly lower cancer-specific survival compared
with F. nucleatum–negative patients (log-rank P ¼ 0.0012, uni-
variate HR ¼ 2.26; 95% CI, 1.34–3.72; P ¼ 0.0026; multivariate
HR ¼ 1.98; 95% CI, 1.14–3.37; P ¼ 0.016).
Upregulated pathways in F. nucleatum–positive esophageal
cancer tissues
To clarify the mechanism whereby F. nucleatum may confer a
poor prognosis, we performed enrichment analyses of KEGG
pathways using the microarray data. The top 10 most enriched
KEGG pathways associated with the significantly upregulated
DEGs in F. nucleatum–positive esophageal cancer tissues are
shown in Fig. 4A. Importantly, "cytokine–cytokine receptor inter-
action" was the top-ranked pathway (FDR < 0.001, fold enrich-
ment > 1.95). A list of the chemokine DEGs (fold change > 2) in
"cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction" is shown in Supplemen-
tary Table S2. We hypothesized that F. nucleatum might contribute
to the acquisition of aggressive tumor behavior through the
activation of chemokines. CCL20 was identified as the most
upregulated chemokine (Supplementary Table S2), and we there-
fore evaluated the expression status of CCL20 in esophageal

Discussion
We examined the prognostic impact of human microbiome
F. nucleatum among 325 patients with resected esophageal can-
cers. It is becoming increasingly clear that the human microbiome
influences cancer development and progression (5, 30–32). A
better understanding of the mechanisms and contribution of the
microbiota to human cancers may thus aid the development of
novel approaches to cancer treatment and/or prevention. To the
best of our knowledge, the current study provides the first evi-
dence for the relationship between F. nucleatum and poor prog-
nosis in esophageal cancer. In addition, using KEGG enrichment
analysis, we demonstrated that F. nucleatum might contribute to
the acquisition of aggressive tumor behavior through the activa-
tion of chemokines, such as CCL20.
Previous studies of the relationships between Fusobacterium
species and clinical outcome in human cancers have been incon-
clusive (Supplementary Table S1). Two studies reported that
tumor Fusobacterium species were associated with a poor progno-
sis in patients with colorectal cancer (32, 33). Mima and collea-
gues analyzed a molecular pathology epidemiologic database of
more than 1,000 colorectal cancers and revealed that F. nucleatum
DNA levels in colorectal cancer tissues were associated with
shorter survival (24), while Flanagan and colleagues demonstrat-
ed a relationship between F. nucleatum and poor prognosis in 122
colorectal cancers (23). Regarding pancreatic cancer, Mitsuhashi
and colleagues reported that tumor Fusobacterium status was
independently associated with a poorer prognosis (33). Our
current findings in relation to esophageal cancer are in agreement
with these previous results. In contrast, however, two other studies
(n ¼ 99 and n ¼ 511, respectively) of colorectal cancer found no
associations between Fusobacterium detection and clinical out-
come (20, 25). This discrepancy may be attributable to differences
in patient cohorts or in the methods used to assess Fusobacterium
species, or simply to chance variations between independent
studies. However, our results demonstrated a clear association
between increased F. nucleatum DNA content in esophageal cancer
tissues and a poor prognosis, suggesting that F. nucleatum may be a
suitable biomarker for identifying patients likely to experience
inferior outcomes.
Experimental studies have provided mechanistic insights into
the relationship between F. nucleatum and cancer progression.
F. nucleatum is known to express the novel adhesin protein, FadA,
on the bacterial cell surface (34). Rubinstein and colleagues
revealed that FadA can bind to E-cadherin, activate b-catenin
signaling, and promote colorectal cancer cell proliferation in
in vitro and in vivo models (22). They also reported that colorectal
cancer tissues showed elevated fadA gene levels, suggesting a
potential role of FadA as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in
human cancer. F. nucleatum was shown to inhibit T cell–mediated
immune responses against colorectal tumors and promote tumor
progression in the ApcMin/þ mouse model (35). Another study
using colorectal cancer samples revealed an inverse association
between tissue levels of F. nucleatum DNA and CD3þ T-cell density
in tumor tissues (28). Collectively, these results suggest that
F. nucleatum may exert immunosuppressive activity by inhibiting
human T-cell responses. A third possible mechanism involves
modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. An in vivo
study showed that colonization by F. nucleatum stimulated the
secretion of immune cytokines, leading to colon tumorigenesis
(35). Furthermore, our study revealed that the "cytokine–cytokine
receptor interaction" was the most upregulated pathway in
F. nucleatum–positive esophageal cancer, thereby supporting
this third possible mechanism.
Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the crucial roles of
chemokines and their receptors in tumor development and pro-
gression in several types of cancers (36–39). Kretschmer and
colleagues recently reported that esophageal SCC cells modulated
chemokine expression in fibroblasts, affecting the tumor immune
response (40). The most upregulated chemokine in F. nucleatum–
positive esophageal cancers in the current study was CCL20. An
increasing number of studies have recently drawn attention to the
roles of CCL20 and its physiologic sole receptor CCR6 in the
development and progression of various type of cancers (41–43).
An in vitro assay demonstrated that CCL20 stimulation promoted
cancer cell proliferation and migration (44, 45). In addition,
CCL20 plays crucial roles in the migration of Treg lymphocytes
(46, 47), and the accumulation of Treg lymphocytes is associated
with shorter survival in human cancers (48, 49). Liu and collea-
gues recently reported that CCL20 was related to tumor infiltra-
tion of Treg lymphocytes in esophageal SCC, suggesting the
Figure 3.

 importance of chemokines, such as CCL20, in immune surveil-
lance in esophageal cancer patients (50). Further studies are
needed to validate the current findings and to elucidate the
mechanism(s) whereby F. nucleatum affects tumor behavior.
In conclusion, F. nucleatum was detected in esophageal cancer
tissues and was associated with shorter survival, suggesting that it
may serve as a useful prognostic biomarker. F. nucleatum might
also contribute to the acquisition of aggressive tumor behavior
through the activation of chemokines, such as CCL20.

F. nucleatum and chemokines in esophageal cancer. A, top 10 most enriched KEGG pathways among significantly upregulated DEGs in F. nucleatum–positive
esophageal cancer tissues. Dashed lines, P values for the 10 top-ranked categories of KEGG pathways. The P values are expressed as the negative logarithm
(base 10). B, immunostaining for CCL20 in esophageal cancer tissues. CCL20 positivity was observed in the cytoplasm and membrane of esophageal cancer cells.
C, CCL20 expression scores were significantly higher in F. nucleatum–positive tissues (n ¼ 20) compared with F. nucleatum–negative tissues (n ¼ 20).
