Abstract 
Background
Background: There has been a rapid global development of the horizontal 
drilling and hydraulic fracturing process termed fracking. This involves the 
dispersion of “produced water” which contains naturally occurring radioac-
tive material (NORM) which may contaminate surface water and pose a 
health risk. Objectives
Objectives: To investigate association between early (0-28 days) 
infant mortality by county in Pennsylvania and fracking. Methods
Methods: We com-
pared early infant mortality for 2007-2010 after fracking developed with a 
control period 2003-2006, contrasting a group of the 10 most heavily fracked 
counties with the rest of Pennsylvania. Results
Results: Whilst early infant deaths de-
creased by 2.4% in the State over the period, in the 82,558 births in the 10 
fracked counties there was a significant increase in mortality (238 vs 193; RR 
= 1.29; 95% CI 1.05, 1.55; p = 0.011). For the five north east fracked counties 
Bradford, Susquehanna, Lycoming, Wyoming and Tioga the combined early 
infant mortality increased from 34 deaths to 60 (RR 1.66; 1.05, 2.51; p = 
0.014), whereas in the south western 5 counties Washington, Westmoreland, 
Fayette, Butler and Greene the increase was modest, 157 to 178 (RR 1.18; 0.95, 
1.46; p = 0.13). Increased risk was associated with exposure to groundwater, 
expressed as the county ratio of water wells divided by the number of births. 
Conclusions
Conclusions: Fracking appears to be associated with early infant mortality in 
populations living in counties where the process is carried out. There is some 
evidence that the effect is associated with private water well density and/or 
environmental law violations.

1. Introduction 
New unconventional gas extraction technology, involving horizontal drilling and 
explosive hydraulic fracturing of underground rock strata has been termed 
“fracking” a term which we employ here. The economic advantages of fracking 
have led to a rapid and on-going growth in the extraction of natural gas globally 
[1]. The method involves the explosive destruction of large volumes of under-
ground gas and oil retaining rocks and the pumping down of large amounts of 
what is termed “produced water” which initially contains various chemical and 
sand additives [2] [3]. This produced water and backflow returns to the surface 
with a high load of dissolved and suspended solids including naturally occurring 
radioactive elements Uranium, Thorium, Radium and their decay products, col-
lectively termed NORM (Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material) [2] [3] [4] 
[5] [6]. The contaminated water has to be safely disposed of but this is often as-
sociated with violations of legal disposal constraints. 
It has long been known that Radium dissolved in fracked pore water or ad-
sorbed on clay particles and grain coatings can dissolve and return to the surface 
in produced water [7] [8] a fact that has led to tightening of controls over radio-
activity in the conventional oil industry. Radium and Total Dissolved Solids 
(TDS) in produced water are positively correlated [9] [10]. Radium is released 
though variation in ionic strength (salinity) differentials (Sturchio et al. 2001). 
As an example, over the course of 20 days, Radium concentration in flowback 
from a Marcellus Shale gas well in Greene County Pennsylvania increased by 
almost a factor of four from 74 Bq/L to 240 Bq/L [9] [11]. These high Radium 
activities are pointers to a more general radiological contamination of produced 
water from the ingrowth of Radium progeny and other dissolved radionuclides 
[12] [13]. These are radiologically significant activity levels; for example, the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limit for Radium in drinking water is 
0.185 Bq/L and for all NORM alpha is 0.555 Bq/L. These and other considera-
tions have led to concerns about possible contamination of surface waters and 
local drinking water [14] [15] [16]. 
The health effects of exposure to low levels of NORM in drinking water even 
at the current legal limit have been the subject of a number of studies, which 
collectively raise the issue of the adequacy of this limit and current risk models 
underpinning it in protecting members of the public from the harmful effects of 
internal exposures to Uranium, Radium and their progeny [17]-[22]. One of the 
earliest gas fracking developments where these concerns are relevant was the ex-
ploitation of the Marcellus Shale beds in Pennsylvania where shales and sand-
stones contain significant quantities of NORM [10]. 
There is general concern about the lack of research into the health effects of 
fracking [14] [15] [16]. Two recent studies of Pennsylvania examined birth out-
comes [23] [24]. In both studies of birth outcomes mothers’ exposures were 
stratified by radial distance from the well head. One study, from 2007 to 2010 
demonstrated an effect on birth weight and prematurity; the other which looked 
at a different database from 2009 to 2013 found a significant trend with preterm

birth and doctor concerns about pregnancy risk. This latter was in central and 
north east Pennsylvania whereas the Stacey et al. study [23] examined Butler, 
Washington and Westmoreland Counties in South West Pennsylvania, counties 
which are not among the most highly fracked. 
There may be another problem with these approaches. Ecological methods 
employing radial distance from a putative source as surrogate for exposure have 
been criticized in connection with nuclear site studies [25] [26] [27] since they 
presuppose a radial dispersion of the exposure, something which is not even true 
for airborne releases. For example, liquid contaminations generally flow down-
hill, and airborne contamination downwind; in either case, they are directional. 
If exposure to contaminated drinking water were a vector for the effect, we feel 
that the inclusion of a drinking water covariate might have been valuable. Nev-
ertheless, both the studies in Pennslvania suggested an association with adverse 
effects on infant development, one which we follow up here. 
Infant mortality (IM), particularly early (0-28 days) infant mortality (EIM), is 
an indicator of developmental harm. This may be roughly divided into (1) play 
of chance, (2) mothers’ health and (3) congenital anomalies, which latter nowa-
days represent about half of the total number of early infant deaths [28]. Foe-
tuses with congenital anomalies inconsistent with survival to term are often 
aborted in the first trimester [29] [30]. However, other anomalies do not become 
life threatening until after birth. An in utero existence protects the foetus from 
severe congenital heart defects and abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract or 
lungs which only become life threatening after the baby is released from the um-
bilical connection at birth. In the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance system [29] 
that there were 45.8% of deaths due to severe congenital anomalies occurring 
shortly after birth. 
Since Chernobyl, it has been increasingly argued that the effects on congenital 
anomaly rates of internal exposures to low levels of radioactivity are not safely 
described by current radiation risk models [31] [32] [33]. For example, the 
post-Chernobyl research reviewed by Schmitz-Feuerhake et al. 2016 [32] has di-
rected attention back to an earlier proposed association between infant and 
perinatal mortality (EIM plus stillbirths) and atmospheric nuclear testing fallout 
[34] [35]. 
We therefore decided to examine directly the most obvious easily available in-
dicator of harm, the 0-28 days infant mortality (EIM) trend in each of the 67 
Pennsylvania Counties over two balanced 4-year periods, comparing immedi-
ately before (2003-2006) with immediately after (2007-2010) the fracking expan-
sion began. These are justified as study periods because there were 44 fracking 
wells drilled before 2007 but 2864 in the 2007-2010 period [36] referred to in 
[24]. We further focus on the 10 most heavily fracked counties to see if there is 
an association between the increased risk of dying at age 0-28 days after fracking 
expansion began and if so, whether any result may be associated either with den-
sity of fracking wells, with exposures to water from private wells, or with viola-
tions of legal restrictions on disposal of produced water.

2. Method 
Data on the number of live births and number of infant deaths 0-1 year and 0-28 
days (EIM) for each of the 67 counties of Pennsylvania for the years 1999 to 2014 
were obtained from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania [37]. 
Data on the number of fracking wells and violations by county and year were 
obtained from the website of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental 
Protection [38]. 
Data on the number of water wells drilled in the Pennsylvania counties was 
obtained from website of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and 
Natural Resources [39]. 
We first calculated the risk ratio (RR) of EIM rates (per 1000 live births) be-
tween the non-fracked and fracked periods as: RR = EIM (2007-2010)/EIM (2003- 
2006) for each county, for the entire State of Pennsylvania and for the aggregate 
of all Pennsylvania counties less the 10 most fracked counties. We then mapped 
the result RR to compare this with a similar map of fracking well density by 
county to use the simple John Snow method for any apparent associations. 
3. Results 
Figure 1
Figure 1 shows the counties of Pennsylvania with an indication of the density of 
fracking by county whilst Fig
Figure
ure 2 shows the Risk Ratio also by county. 
In Table 1
Table 1 we focus on the 10 most highly fracked counties and the State of 
Pennsylvania and show the numbers of births and fracking wells drilled in the 
period 2007-10 and also the number of violations in 2011 by county. In Table 2
Table 2 
are shown the values of the Risk Ratio and associated statistical results for the 
most fracked counties and Pennsylvania and also for further aggregation of the 
fracked counties into those in the North East and those in the South West, since 
these two areas enjoy different geologies, and we calculate Risk Ratios separately 
for these two groups. Note that we do not employ ratios of Standardised Mortal-
ity Ratios (i.e. SMRR = SMRR (2007-10)/SMRR (2003-6) where SMRR = RR 
(county)/RR (Pennsylvania). This would represent a more accurate indicator but

would only slightly increase any effect tabulated by about 2% because of the 
slight fall in the EIM ratio for the State of Pennsylvania. 
Since we are interested in the clear difference in RR between the north east 
and south west group we define a water-well index of exposure W which is sim-
ply the number of water wells in the county per unit birth. This index W is given 
in Table 3
Table 3 for each of the 10 highly fracked counties and in Fig
Figure
ure 3 we plot the 
RR for each county against the Index W. 
4. Discussion 
There are two questions: 1) Is there a significant increase in EIM in the fracked 
counties after fracking began? And 2) Can we say anything about the likely cause 
from the results? The answer to the first question is that there is such an in-
crease, which appears in 9 of the 10 main fracked counties although the small 
numbers do not permit any statistical certainty for each county on its own. 
Overall, it is possible to say that for all the 10 counties combined there is a 29% 
increase in EIM between the 4-year period before fracking began and the 4-year 
period after it expanded. The two tailed 95% confidence interval for the 29% in-
crease lay between 5% and 55%. If we base this increase on the 2.5% fall in the 
EIM rates in all Pennsylvania (which becomes about 4% reduction if considering 
the non-fracked counties) this represents a 33% increase relative to the non- 
fracked county rate ratio. 
Taking all the counties, we have mapped the RR value for each county as a 
colour code in a John Snow map in Figure 2
Figure 2. This can be compared with Figure 
Figure 
1 where counties are coloured according to the number of fracking wells re-
ported in 2011. It seems clear that there is qualitatively an association between 
the counties showing the excess risk in the post-fracking period and increased 
risk of dying in the first month of life. 
We have focused on EIM but have also examined infant (0 - 1 y); there are in

creases here also in the fracked counties; they are more modest, though still sig-
nificant, but for the purposes of examining the effects of fracking they do not 
add to the picture. 
One immediate result was the difference in RR between the south west coun-
ties and those in the north east. In the 5 north east counties are found a com-
bined RR of 1.67 (1.1 < RR < 2.51; p = 0.014) but for the south west group we 
find RR = 1.18 (0.95 < RR < 1.46; p = 0.13). Comparison of the two groups north 
east and south west by standardisation [40] gives an Odds Ratio of 2.8 (1.76, 
4.36; p < 0.0001). This may be relevant in searching for a cause. Two possible 
explanations are the density of private water wells in the two regions and the 
number of violations in the regions, both adjusted to the number of births. 
These may not be independent. In Table 3
Table 3 we see that there is almost 3 times the 
number of water wells in the north east per birth. This is a significant difference 
at the < 0.001 level. Why could this be important? Because if the increases were 
driven by contamination of drinking water in private wells, then the effect would 
not occur in those populations whose water supply were piped from a reservoir, 
as in the larger towns. It would be those with private wells which would become 
contaminated, either by surface water contamination from illegally disposed

process water, or by contamination of the relevant aquifer following the explo-
sive decomposition of underground strata with the associated release of NORM, 
hitherto stably adsorbed on rock or shale. In addition, or alternatively, the geol-
ogy of the north east is shale and sandstone and the aquifers are closer to the 
surface than in the south west where the geology is granitic, and thus there will 
also be acidity and mobilisation differences in the groundwater aquifers [39]. 
For Table 3
Table 3 also we find that the number of Violations per birth is much 
greater in the north east than in the south west. We have no information about 
how this parameter may connect with the water-well density parameter. How-
ever, there does seem to be a trend in the central crude RR of each county and an 
exposure covariate which we have defined as W, the number of water wells in 
each county per birth. This relationship is shown in Figure
Figure 3. There is a signifi-
cant trend with W in the north-east group but not in the south-west (Chi-square 
for trend 3.75; p = 0.052). 
However, with considerable caution owing to the wide confidence intervals in 
each county, we can apply some analysis to this. If it were the water-well expo-
sure, we should predict RRs in the north east to show the trend Susq > Tioga >

expect the trend to be Susq > Lycoming > Bradford > Wyoming = Tioga which is

a poor match. 
Similar examination of the south-west would suggest Greene would have the 
highest risk if it were Violations, but the highest RRs are in Washington and 
Fayette where there are higher W values but zero Violations listed. 
The results therefore seem to support the suggestion that the vector for the ef-
fect is exposure to drinking water from private wells. This is a mechanistically 
plausible explanation. However the findings do not prove such a suggestion. We 
may examine other possible explanations for possible health effects which have 
been advanced [14]. First, exposure to some kind of airborne contaminant. But 
such an effect should show a similar RR for the north east and south west coun-
ties. Then there are the social disruption arguments, rapid growth in small 
communities, noise, diesel fumes, effects on herd immunity and so forth; again, 
these do not persuasively distinguish between the north east and the south west 
group. 
With the drinking water explanation in mind we return to mechanism. We 
acknowledge the existence of chemical contaminants in the produced water and 
put such an explanation to one side as a possible but unknown factor. However, 
we earlier drew attention to recent work focusing on the genetic effects of inter-
nal radioactive contamination [32]. The EPA levels for Radium in drinking wa-
ter (0.18 Bq/L) were calculated on the basis of the concept of absorbed dose, 
which in turn represents the physical deposition of energy per unit mass of tis-
sue. This is not the same calculation for external exposures as for internal expo-
sures especially to Uranium and Radium, both DNA seekers, for various techni-
cal reasons discussed elsewhere [21]. There is already evidence that exposures to 
low levels of NORM in drinking water causes increased levels of cancer, leuke-
mia and birth defects [17] [18] [19] [20]. A recent example, the increases in 
heritable effects found in the post Chernobyl studies, particularly those of 
Wertelecki in the Ukraine, who carefully defined the contamination levels of the 
mothers by measurement, revealed significant effects at doses that were compa-
rable with those considered by the EPA to be safe [41] [42]. Thus the legal limits 
of exposure currently believed to protect may now need to be revisited. 
Early infant mortality is a flag for genetic damage, and thus represents a 
“miner’s canary” for other ill health effects in children and adults, particularly 
cancer, though there is a temporal lag in cancer between exposure and clinical 
expression. Unfortunately, cancer incidence data is not made available for re-
searchers, in certain areas does not exist. The results obtained here would sug-
gest that studies of infant mortality, particularly early infant mortality, can pro-
vide an early assessment of risk to putative agents of environmental harm. It is 
suggested that further research in Pennsylvania might involve comparison of 
birth outcomes with measurements of NORM in private drinking water wells 
located near fracking wells.

Babies born in the 4 years after fracking expansion (2007-2010) in those counties

of Pennsylvania with most wells were 28% more likely to die in the first month 
than babies born in those counties in the 4 years before fracking began 
(2003-2006). There were about 50 more babies died in these 10 counties than 
would have been predicted if the rate had been the same over the period as all of 
Pennsylvania, where the incidence rate fell over the same period. The association 
was also greater in the 5 north east counties of Susquehanna, Bradford, Wyo-
ming, Lycoming and Tioga (67% increased risk) than in the 5 south west coun-
ties of Washington, Westmoreland, Greene, Butler and Fayette (18% increased 
risk). There is some analytical evidence based upon the distribution of risk by 
county that this may be because of differences in the source of drinking water in 
these counties, with a greater proportion of drinking water being from private 
wells in the north east than in the south west. Evidence is discussed which sup-
ports the contamination of the drinking water by naturally occurring radioactive 
material, including Radium as a cause of the increased risk.
