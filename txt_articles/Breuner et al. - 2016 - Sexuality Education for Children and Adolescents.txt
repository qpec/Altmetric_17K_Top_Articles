abstract
The purpose of this clinical report is to provide pediatricians updated 
research on evidence-based sexual and reproductive health education 
conducted since the original clinical report on the subject was published by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2001. Sexuality education is defi
 ned 
as teaching about human sexuality, including intimate relationships, human 
sexual anatomy, sexual reproduction, sexually transmitted infections, sexual 
activity, sexual orientation, gender identity, abstinence, contraception, and 
reproductive rights and responsibilities. Developmentally appropriate and 
evidence-based education about human sexuality and sexual reproduction 
over time provided by pediatricians, schools, other professionals, and 
parents is important to help children and adolescents make informed, 
positive, and safe choices about healthy relationships, responsible sexual 
activity, and their reproductive health. Sexuality education has been shown 
to help to prevent and reduce the risks of adolescent pregnancy, HIV, and 
sexually transmitted infections for children and adolescents with and 
without chronic health conditions and disabilities in the United States.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this clinical report is to provide pediatricians with 
an update on the research regarding evidence-based sexual and 
reproductive health education that has been conducted since the original 
clinical report on the subject was published by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2001. 
1 Education about sexuality that is provided 
by pediatricians can complement the education children obtain at school 
or at home, 
 
2, 
 
3 but many pediatricians do not address it. In a review of 
health maintenance visits, 1 of 3 adolescent patients did not receive 
any information on sexuality from their pediatrician, and if they did, the 
conversation lasted less than 40 seconds.

BACKGROUND
Children and adolescents with and 
without chronic health conditions 
and disabilities will benefit when 
they are provided with accurate 
and developmentally appropriate 
information about the biological, 
sociocultural, psychological, 
relational, and spiritual dimensions 
of sexuality. Information about 
sexuality can be taught and shared 
in schools, communities, homes, 
and medical offices using evidence-
based interventions. Children 
and adolescents should be shown 
how to develop a safe and positive 
view of sexuality through age-
appropriate education about their 
sexual health. Sexuality education 
can be disseminated through the 
3 learning domains: cognitive 
(information), affective (feelings, 
values, and attitudes), and behavioral 
(communication, decision-making, 
and other skills). 
5
Sexuality education is more than 
the instruction of children and 
adolescents on anatomy and the 
physiology of biological sex and 
reproduction. It covers healthy 
sexual development, gender 
identity, interpersonal relationships, 
affection, sexual development, 
intimacy, and body image for all 
adolescents, including adolescents 
with disabilities, chronic health 
conditions, and other special needs. 
6 
Developing a healthy sexuality is a 
key developmental milestone for 
all children and adolescents that 
depends on acquiring information 
and forming attitudes, beliefs, 
and values about consent, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, 
relationships, and intimacy. 
7 Healthy 
sexuality is influenced by ethnic, 
racial, cultural, personal, religious, 
and moral concerns. Healthy 
sexuality includes the capacity to 
promote and preserve significant 
interpersonal relationships; value 
one’s body and personal health; 
interact with both sexes in respectful 
and appropriate ways; and express 
affection, love, and intimacy in ways 
consistent with one’s own values, 
sexual preferences, and abilities. 
The various dimensions of healthy 
sexuality comprise the anatomy, 
physiology, and biochemistry 
of the sexual response system; 
identity, orientation, roles, and 
personality; and thoughts, feelings, 
and relationships. 
6 Ideally, children 
and adolescents receive accurate 
information on sexual health from 
multiple professional resources. 
8, 
9
All children and adolescents need 
to receive accurate education about 
sexuality to understand ultimately 
how to practice healthy sexual 
behavior. Unhealthy, exploitive, or 
risky sexual activity may lead to 
health and social problems, such as 
unintended pregnancy and sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs), 
including gonorrhea, Chlamydia, 
syphilis, hepatitis, herpes, human 
papilloma virus (HPV); HIV infection; 
and AIDS. 
10 From a 2012 informative 
report by the National Campaign 
to Prevent Teen and Unplanned 
Pregnancy that surveyed 1200 high 
school seniors, many senior girls and 
boys reported having mixed feelings 
about the first time they had sex, with 
more than three-quarters responding 
that they would change the way their 
first sexual experience occurred. 
Interestingly, seniors in this study 
wanted their younger peers to know 
it was “fine to be a virgin” when they 
graduated from high school. 
11
It has been demonstrated that 
sexuality education interventions 
can prevent or reduce the risk of 
adolescent pregnancy HIV, and 
STIs for children and adolescents 
with and without chronic health 
conditions and disabilities in 
the United States. 
12 Adolescent 
sexual activity and teen births and 
pregnancies have been decreasing 
since 1991, with the exception of 
2005 to 2007, when there was a 
5% increase in birth rates. The 
decrease in adolescent birth rates 
in the United States reflects an 
increased use of contraception at first 
intercourse and in the use of dual 
methods of condoms and hormonal 
contraception in already sexually 
active teenagers. 
13 Nevertheless, 
the United States continues to 
lead industrialized countries with 
the highest rates of adolescent 
pregnancy. 
14  Importantly, 88% of 
births to adolescents 15 to 17 years 
of age in the United States continued 
to be unintended (unwanted or 
mistimed). 
15 
Sexual health information 
messages are received by children 
and adolescents multiple times 
throughout the day from the media, 
religious organizations, schools, and 
family peers, parents/caregivers, and 
partners, although the quality of the 
information varies. 
16, 
 
17 In an article 
published in 2013 on how sexually 
experienced adolescents in the 
United States receive sexual health 
information, parents and teachers 
were the source of information 
for 55% of girls and 43% of boys 
about birth control and for 59% 
of girls and 66% of boys about 
STIs/HIV. 
18 Only 10% of sexually 
experienced adolescents reported 
health care providers as a source of 
birth control/STI/HIV information. 
More than 80% of adolescents 15 
to 19 years of age received formal 
instruction about STIs, HIV, or how to 
say "no" to sex between 2011-2013, 
yet only 55% of males and 60% of 
females received instruction about 
birth control. 
19 Strong support of 
multilevel expanded and integrative 
sex education is warranted now more 
than ever.20
Delivery of Sexuality Education
Pediatricians/Health Care Providers
Pediatricians are in an excellent 
position to provide and support 
longitudinal sexuality education to 
all children, adolescents, and young 
adults with and without chronic 
health conditions and disabilities as 
part of preventive health care. Over

the past decade, increasing numbers 
of adolescents contend with sexuality 
in the context of their own chronic 
physical or mental health condition 
and/or developmental disability. 
21, 
 
22 
When sexuality is discussed routinely 
and openly during well-child visits 
for all children and adolescents 
in the pediatrician’s office, 
conversations are easier to initiate, 
more comfortable to continue, and 
more effective and informative for 
all participants. Pediatricians and 
other primary care clinicians can 
explore the expectations of parents 
for their child’s sexual development 
while providing general, factual 
information about sexuality and can 
monitor adolescent use of guidance 
and resources offered over time.
Pediatricians can introduce issues of 
physical, cognitive, and psychosexual 
development to parents and their 
children in early childhood and 
continue discussions at ongoing 
health maintenance visits throughout 
school age, adolescence, and young 
adulthood. Sharing this information 
can help overcome barriers to 
discussing the sexual development 
of all children and adolescents and 
to improve screening rates for STIs, 
pregnancy, and partner violence. It is 
also important to provide access to 
current accurate sexuality education 
and to provide access to confidential 
relevant information, services, 
and support over the course of a 
lifetime. 
18, 
 
21 These conversations can 
begin with questions the family might 
have about the child and his or her 
body as well as about self-stimulation 
and “safe touch.” With insights 
into the typical stages of child and 
adolescent sexual development, 
parents can better understand their 
own child’s behaviors. For example, 
by recognizing that masturbation 
is typical toddler behavior, parents 
can better understand and discuss 
self-stimulatory behaviors of their 
teenager. The problem is often the 
inability to distinguish between 
behaviors that are publicly and 
privately appropriate as children 
grow older. 
23
Often, the pediatrician can take the 
lead from the parent or caregiver 
and then ask a few gentle leading 
questions about how much 
information the family would 
like to receive with the child and 
parent together in the room. The 
dynamics of the sexuality education 
conversation can then change as the 
child becomes a young adolescent 
by asking the parent or caregiver 
to leave the room after the initial 
introductions and history taking has 
occurred with the parent in the room. 
Parents and adolescents benefit from 
being prepared for these changes in 
adolescent interactions when there 
will be time alone for the adolescent 
to engage with the pediatrician to 
discuss sexuality, as well as personal 
and mental health, drug and tobacco 
use, and other psychosocial issues. 
The importance of confidentiality 
and its role in adolescent health 
care autonomy should be discussed 
with both adolescents and their 
parents. Unlike school-based 
instruction, a conversation about 
sexuality with pediatricians 
can provide an opportunity for 
personalized information, for 
confidential screening of risks, and 
for addressing risks and enhancing 
existing strengths through health 
promotion and counseling. Children 
and adolescents may ask questions, 
discuss potentially embarrassing 
experiences, or reveal highly 
personal information to their 
pediatricians. Families and children 
may obtain education together or in 
a separate but coordinated manner. 
Prevention and counseling can 
be targeted to the needs of youth 
who are and those who are not yet 
sexually active and to groups at high 
risk of early or unsafe sexual activity, 
which includes children with and 
without chronic health conditions 
and disabilities.
Use of a psychosocial behavior 
screening tool or the Bright Futures 
Previsit Questionnaire (available 
at https:// 
brightfutures. 
aap. 
org/ 
Bright%20 
Futures%20 
Documents/ 
CoreTools11- 
14YearOCVisit. 
pdf) is a good way to address 
all of these topics, in addition to 
physical activity, nutrition, school, 
and relationships. The AAP policy 
statement on providing care for 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
and questioning youth, as well as 
other resources, offer suggestions 
on how to incorporate important 
conversations about sexual and 
gender identity in the health 
supervision visit. 
24 
– 
26
In the office setting, children and 
adolescents have been shown to 
prefer a pediatrician who is open 
and nonjudgmental and comfortable 
with discussions to address 
knowledge, questions, worries, 
or misunderstandings among 
children, adolescents with and 
without chronic health conditions 
and disabilities, and their parents/
caregivers related to a wide range 
of topics. These topics include, 
but are not limited to, anatomy, 
masturbation, menstruation, 
erections, nocturnal emissions 
(“wet dreams”), sexual fantasies, 
sexual orientation, and orgasms. 
Information regarding availability 
and access to confidential sexual 
and reproductive health services 
and emergency contraception 
is important to discuss with 
adolescents and with parents. During 
these discussions, pediatricians also 
can address homosexual or bisexual 
experiences or orientation, including 
topics related to gender identity. It 
is also important to acknowledge 
the influence of media imagery 
on sexuality as it is portrayed in 
music and music videos, movies, 
pornography, and television, 
print, and Internet content and to 
address the effects of social media 
and sexting. According to the US 
Preventive Services Task Force, 
intensive behavioral counseling 
is important for all sexually active

adolescents and for adults who are 
at increased risk of STIs. 
27 Although 
there may not be time to address all 
of these topics in a brief office visit, 
the longitudinal relationship and 
annual well visit present several 
opportunities for discussion. In 
addition, more information and 
resources can be shared with 
adolescents, many of which are easily 
accessible and listed at the end of this 
report.
Most adolescents have the 
opportunity to explore intimacy and 
sexuality in a safe context, but some 
others experience coercion, abuse, 
and violence. In fact, unwanted first 
sexual encounters were reported 
in the National Survey of Family 
Growth among 11% of female 
and male subjects 18 to 24 years 
of age who had first intercourse 
before age 20 years. 
28 Teenagers 
who report first sex at 14 years of 
age and younger are more likely 
to report that it was nonvoluntary, 
compared with those who were 17 
to 19 years of age at sexual debut. 
29 
Unwanted encounters may include 
dating violence, stranger assaults, 
and intrafamilial sexual abuse/incest. 
Screening for sexual violence and 
nonconsensual sexual encounters 
is important when evaluating all 
sexually active adolescents, especially 
for adolescents with chronic health 
conditions and disabilities, because 
they may be more likely to be victims 
of sexual abuse. 
5, 
 
30
In the Schools
Formal sexuality education in 
schools that includes instruction 
about healthy sexual decision-
making and STI/HIV prevention 
can improve the health and well-
being of adolescents and young 
adults. 
31 If comprehensive sexuality 
education programs are offered in 
the schools, positive outcomes can 
occur, including delay in the initiation 
and reduction in the frequency of 
sexual intercourse, a reduction in the 
number of sexual partners, and an 
increase in condom use. 
12, 
 
32 Some 
studies also have shown less truancy 
and an improvement in academic 
performance in those who have taken 
sexuality education courses. 
33
A student’s experience in school 
with sexuality education can 
vary a great deal. The Sexuality 
Information and Education Council 
of the United States and the Future 
of Sex Education (FoSE) promote 
evidence-informed comprehensive 
school-based sexuality education 
appropriate to students’ age, 
developmental abilities, and cultural 
background as an important part 
of the school curriculum at every 
grade. 
34 A comprehensive sexuality 
program provides medically accurate 
information, recognizes the diversity 
of values and beliefs represented in 
the community, and complements 
and augments the sexuality education 
children receive from their families, 
religious and community groups, 
and health care professionals. 
Adolescents and most parents agree 
that school-based programs need 
to be an important source of formal 
education for adolescent sexual 
health. 
35 
– 
37
The protective influence of sexuality 
education is not limited to the 
questions about if or when to have 
sex, but extends to issues of partner 
selection, contraceptive use, and 
reproductive health outcomes. 
38 
Creating access to medically 
accurate comprehensive sexuality 
education by using an evidence-
based curriculum and reducing 
sociodemographic disparities in 
its receipt remain a primary goal 
for improving the well-being of 
teenagers and young adults. Ideally, 
this education happens conjointly in 
the home and in the school. 
39
Factors that shape the content and 
delivery of sexuality education 
include state and school district 
policies, state education standards, 
funding from state and federal 
sources, and individual teacher 
comfort, knowledge, and skills. Fewer 
than half of states require public 
schools to teach sexuality education, 
and even fewer states require 
that, if offered, sexuality education 
must be medically, factually, or 
technically accurate. State definitions 
of “medically accurate” vary, from 
requiring that the department 
of health review curriculum 
for accuracy to mandating that 
curriculum be based on published 
medical information. 
40
Two-thirds of states and the District 
of Columbia allow parents to remove 
their children from participation or 
opt out from sexuality education. 
Fewer than half of states and 
the District of Columbia require 
parents to be notified that sexuality 
education will be provided. Other 
states have specific content 
requirements, including “stressing 
abstinence” or precluding discussion 
of homosexuality or abortion. 
41 
The status of sexuality education in 
private schools is less well known. 
There is little to no information 
available from parochial or private 
scholastic institutions on the 
provisions of sexuality education.
Although policies exist requiring 
sexuality education, it may not 
be occurring in an unbiased and 
systematic manner. From the 2012 
School Health Policies and Practices 
Survey, only 71% of US high school 
districts have adopted a policy 
specifying that human sexuality is 
taught. In a separate study comparing 
high schools, middle schools, and 
elementary schools, sexuality 
education taught in middle schools 
across states was more likely to 
be focused on “how to say no to 
sex” rather than other topics, with 
approximately 1 in 5 teenagers 
reporting that they first received 
instruction on “how to say no to sex” 
while in the first through fifth grade. 
Adolescent boys were slightly more 
likely than girls to be instructed on 
how to say no to sex or were using 
birth control while in middle school 
(52% of male teenagers, compared

with 46% of female teenagers). 
Male teenagers were less likely than 
female teenagers to report first 
receiving instruction on methods of 
birth control while in high school 
(38% of male teenagers, compared 
with 47% of female teenagers). 
42
Teacher training in the United 
States is quite variable from district 
to district and school to school 
especially in sexuality education. 
The FoSE Initiative has released 
the National Teacher Preparation 
Standards for Sexuality Education 
to provide guidance to institutions 
of higher education to better 
prepare future teachers. 
9 The 
FoSE teacher standards include 
professional disposition, diversity 
and equity, content knowledge, legal 
and professional ethics, planning, 
implementation, and assessment. 
According to these standards, 
teachers may benefit from receiving 
specialized training on human 
sexuality, which includes accurate 
and current knowledge about 
biological, social, and emotional 
stages of child and adolescent sexual 
development (including sexual 
orientation) and legal aspects of 
sexuality (ie, age of consent).
Professionals responsible for 
sexuality education may benefit from 
receiving training in several learning 
and behavior theories and how to 
provide age- and developmentally 
appropriate instruction as part of 
sexuality education lesson planning. 
Ideally, teachers would be familiar 
with relevant and current state 
and/or district laws, policies, and 
standards to help them choose 
and adapt an evidence-based and 
scientifically accurate curriculum 
that is appropriate and permissible 
within a school district. Ongoing 
professional development and 
participation in continuing education 
classes or intensive seminars is 
advised. Teachers can benefit from 
access to updated and current 
sexuality information, curricula, 
policies, laws, standards, and other 
materials. The FoSE standards advise 
that teachers are aware of and take 
into account their own biases about 
sexuality, understand guidelines 
for discussion of sensitive subjects 
in the classroom and addressing 
confidentiality, and know how to 
address disclosure by students of 
sexual abuse, incest, dating violence, 
pregnancy, and other associated 
sexual health issues. The goal is for 
teachers to feel comfortable and 
committed to discussing human 
sexuality and to know how to 
conduct themselves appropriately 
with students as professionals both 
inside and outside of the classroom 
and school. It is important for 
teachers to have an appreciation for 
how students’ diverse backgrounds 
and experience may affect students’ 
personal beliefs, values, and 
knowledge about sexuality. In the 
United States, 35.5% of districts 
have adopted a policy stating that 
there is a requirement that those 
who teach health education must 
earn continuing education credits 
on strategies or on health-related 
topics. It is important for teachers 
to develop skills in creating a safe, 
respectful, and inclusive classroom. 
41
In the Home
Fundamentally, parents and 
caregivers can have an important 
role as their children’s primary 
sexuality educators. However, a 
number of factors, including lack of 
knowledge, skills, or comfort, may 
impede a parent’s or caregiver’s 
successful fulfillment of that role. 
Health care providers, schools, 
faith-based institutions, the 
media, and professional sexuality 
educators are resources that guide 
and advise parents by providing 
training, resources, understanding, 
and encouragement. One program, 
"Talking Parents, Healthy Teens, 
" 
aims to influence parents’ skills, 
such as communication, monitoring, 
and involvement. These include 
intentions to talk about sex, to 
monitor and stay involved, and 
to understand environmental 
barriers and facilitators that 
influence talking about sexuality (eg, 
community norms that discourage or 
encourage such communication). 
43 
By increasing parents’ skills and 
facilitating opportunities for 
communication through take-home 
activities, the program also aims 
to affect the parent-adolescent 
relationship, further influencing 
adolescent behavior change (eg, the 
likelihood that adolescents will delay 
intercourse or use condoms). 
44
In one study, adolescents were 
asked whether they received formal 
instruction on 4 topics of sexuality 
education at home, school, church, 
a community center, or some other 
place before they were 18 years old. 
42 
They were specifically asked whether 
they spoke to their parents before 
the age of 18 about topics concerning 
sex, birth control, STIs, and HIV/AIDS 
prevention. Two-thirds of male and 
80% of female adolescents reported 
having talked with a parent about at 
least 1 of 6 sexuality education topics 
(“how to say no to sex, 
” methods of 
birth control, STIs, where to get birth 
control, how to prevent HIV/AIDS, 
and how to use a condom). Younger 
(15–17 years old) female teenagers 
were more likely (80%) than younger 
male teenagers (68%) to have talked 
to their parents about these topics. 
42
The medical literature supports that 
family and parental characteristics 
can dictate patterns of sexual 
experience among teenagers, as 
shown in the National Survey of 
Family Growth data from 2006 to 
2010. 
28 For example, in both male 
and female teenagers, a significantly 
smaller percentage were sexually 
experienced if they lived with both 
parents when they were 14 years 
of age, if their mothers had their 
first birth at 20 years or older, if 
the teenager’s mother was a college 
graduate, or if the teenager lived 
with both of his or her parents. 
28 
Further, the approaches parents take 
when talking with their adolescent 
e5

Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
about sex may have a tremendous 
influence on the teenager. 
45 Parents 
who dominate the conversation have 
teenagers who do not have as much 
knowledge. Conversely, parents who 
are engaged and comfortable talking 
about sexual health have teenagers 
who are more knowledgeable and 
may even be more proactive in 
seeking reproductive health medical 
services. 
45
A review of 12 studies on parental 
communication about sex revealed 
that parents who received training on 
this topic had better communication 
with their adolescents about 
sexuality compared with those who 
did not. 
46 Parental conversations 
with their adolescents about 
sexuality education is correlated with 
a delay in sexual debut and increased 
use of contraception and condoms. 
47 
Jaccard and Levitz 
45 identified 
multiple effective components in 
parent-adolescent sexual health 
communication, including (1) 
the extent of communication as 
measured by frequency and depth 
of discussions, (2) informational 
style, (3) the content of data that 
is discussed, (4) when and how 
the communication occurs, and (5) 
the overall environment where the 
conversation takes place.
Discussions of sexuality do not occur 
equally among mothers and fathers. 
One review found that overall, the 
number of discussions parents 
have with teenagers about sex has 
decreased from 1995 to 2002. 
48 
From a separate review covering 
1980 through July 2010, mothers 
were the primary discussant in 
all interventions. 
49 In reviewing 
the role of fathers in sexual health 
discussions, Kirkman et al 
50 found 
that fathers recognized, by self-
report, that they need to share 
the role of communication about 
this topic with their teenagers but 
that they leave the conversation to 
the mothers more often than not. 
Although mothers can also effectively 
teach their sons about sexuality, 
 
51 
the relationship boys have with their 
fathers or other male role models 
plays a crucial role in their sexual 
health, including reducing sexual 
risk taking and delaying initiation 
of sexual intercourse, especially in 
those boys with a connection to their 
fathers, whether they live in the same 
home or not.52, 
 
53
It is clear that parents would 
benefit from support to improve 
communication with their 
adolescents about sex.
ABSTINENCE EDUCATION
We know that abstinence is 100% 
effective at preventing pregnancy 
and STIs; however, research has 
conclusively demonstrated that 
programs promoting abstinence-
only until heterosexual marriage 
occurs are ineffective. 
54 
 
– 
57 A recent 
systematic review examined the 
evidence supporting both abstinence-
only programs and comprehensive 
sexuality education programs 
designed to promote abstinence from 
sexual intercourse. In that review, 
most comprehensive sexuality 
education programs showed 
efficacy in delaying initiation of 
intercourse in addition to promoting 
other protective behaviors, such as 
condom use. There was no evidence 
that abstinence-only programs 
effectively delayed initiation of 
sexual intercourse.57 In another 
review of sexuality education, 
Cavazos-Rehg et al 
35 found that the 
literature examining the efficacy 
of current school-based sexuality 
education programs had insufficient 
evidence to support the intervention 
of abstinence on the basis of 
inconsistent results across studies.
The federal government has 
historically provided $178 million for 
abstinence-only education through 
Title V, Section 510 of the Social 
Security Act in 1996, Community-
Based Abstinence Education projects 
through the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act, and the 
Adolescent Family Life Act program. 
The Community-Based Abstinence 
Education program received the 
most federal funds and made 
direct grants to community-based 
organizations, including faith-based 
organizations. Federal guidance 
required all programs to adhere to an 
8-point definition of abstinence-only 
education and prohibited programs 
from disseminating information 
on contraceptive services, sexual 
orientation and gender identity, and 
other aspects of human sexuality. 
Programs promoted exclusive 
abstinence outside of heterosexual 
marriage and required that 
contraceptive use, contraceptive 
methods, and specifically condoms 
must not be discussed except to 
demonstrate failure rates. 
58
The Obama administration’s 
proposed budget for fiscal year 
2014 created funding for programs 
that have been proven effective in 
reducing teen pregnancy, delaying 
sexual activity, or increasing 
contraceptive use. 
32, 
 
59 
– 
61 There are 
still Title V–funded programs for 
abstinence-only programs in the 
schools and in other places in the 
community. However, most public 
funding now supports evidence-
informed interventions that have 
been proven to delay onset of sexual 
activity, reduce numbers of partners, 
increase condom and contraceptive 
use, and decrease incidence of teen 
pregnancy and STIs, including 
HIV.32, 
 
59 
– 
61 Private and parochial 
schools also have their own standards/
polices and limited funding stream 
for sexuality education. 
57
In a 2005 study by Brückner and 
Bearman, 
 
62 a review of Add Health 
data suggested that many teenagers 
who take a “virginity pledge” and 
intend to be abstinent before 
marriage fail to do so and that 
when these teenagers do initiate 
intercourse, they fail to protect 
themselves by using contraception. 
In a review of the virginity pledge 
movement, these researchers found

that 88% of teenagers who took the 
pledge had initiated intercourse 
before marriage, compared with 99% 
of those who did not take the pledge. 
They also found that teenagers who 
took the pledge were less likely to use 
contraception after they did initiate 
sexual intercourse and not to seek 
STI screening. At 6-year follow-up, 
the prevalence of STIs (Chlamydia, 
gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and HPV 
infection) was comparable among 
those who took the abstinence pledge 
and those who did not. 
62
The American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the 
Society for Adolescent Health and 
Medicine, the AAP, the American 
Medical Association, the American 
Public Health Association, National 
Education Association, and the 
National School Boards Association 
oppose abstinence-only education 
and endorse comprehensive sexuality 
education that includes both 
abstinence promotion and accurate 
information about contraception, 
human sexuality, and STIs.

CLINICAL GUIDANCE FOR 
PEDIATRICIANS
1. The pediatrician should 
encourage early parental 
discussion with children at home 
about sexuality, contraception, 
and Internet and social 
media use that is consistent 
with the child’s and family’s 
attitudes, values, beliefs, and 
circumstances.
2. Diverse family circumstances, 
such as families with same-
sex parents or children who 
identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, or questioning, 
create unique guidance needs 
regarding sexuality education.
3. Modeling ways to initiate talks 
about sexuality with children at 
pertinent opportunities, such 
as the birth of a sibling can 
encourage parents to answer 
children's questions fully and 
accurately.
4. Parents and adolescents are 
encouraged to receive information 
from multiple sources, including 
health care providers and 
sexuality educators, about 
circumstances that are associated 
with earlier sexual activity. 
Adolescents are encouraged to feel 
empowered through discussing 
strategies that allow for practicing 
social skills, assertiveness, control, 
and rejection of unwanted sexual 
advances and cessation of sexual 
activity when the partner does not 
consent.
5. Discussions regarding healthy 
relationships and intimate 
partner violence can be effectively 
included in health care visits.
6. Pediatricians are encouraged to 
acknowledge that sexual activity 
may be pleasurable but also 
must be engaged in responsibly.
7. Specific components of sexuality 
education offered in schools, 
religious institutions, parent 
organizations, and other 
community agencies vary 
based on many factors. The 
pediatrician can serve as a 
resource to each.
8. School-based comprehensive 
sexuality education that 
emphasizes prevention of 
unintended pregnancy and STIs 
should be encouraged.
9. The discussion of methods 
of contraception and STI and 
HPV cancer prevention with 
male and female adolescents 
is encouraged before the onset 
of sexual intercourse (see the 
AAP statement “Contraception 
and Adolescents”). It is also 
important to discuss consistent 
use of safer sex precautions with 
sexually active teens. Bright 
Futures recommendations can 
be used.
10. Abstinence is the most effective 
strategy for preventing HIV 
infection and other STIs, as well 
as for prevention of pregnancy.
11. Preparation for college entry 
is an excellent opportunity for 
pediatricians to address issues 
such as the effects of alcohol, 
marijuana, and other drug 
consumption on decisions about 
safe, consensual sexual practices.
12. Children and adolescents with 
special issues and disabilities 
may benefit from additional 
counseling, referrals, and sharing 
of online resources listed at the 
end of this report.
