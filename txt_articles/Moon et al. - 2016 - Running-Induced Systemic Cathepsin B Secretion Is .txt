SUMMARY
Peripheral processes that mediate beneficial effects
of exercise on the brain remain sparsely explored.
Here, we show that a muscle secretory factor,
cathepsin B (CTSB) protein, is important for the
cognitive and neurogenic benefits of running. Prote-
omic analysis revealed elevated levels of CTSB in
conditioned medium derived from skeletal muscle
cell cultures treated with AMP-kinase agonist AICAR.
Consistently, running increased CTSB levels in
mouse gastrocnemius muscle and plasma. Further-
more, recombinant CTSB
application enhanced
expression
of
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(BDNF) and doublecortin (DCX) in adult hippocampal
progenitor cells through a mechanism dependent on
the multifunctional protein P11. In vivo, in CTSB
knockout (KO) mice, running did not enhance adult
hippocampal
neurogenesis and spatial
memory
function. Interestingly, in Rhesus monkeys and hu-
mans, treadmill exercise elevated CTSB in plasma.
In humans, changes in CTSB levels correlated with
fitness and hippocampus-dependent memory func-
tion. Our findings suggest CTSB as a mediator of
effects of exercise on cognition.
INTRODUCTION
Physical activity benefits human health, including brain function
(Voss et al., 2013). In particular, exercise may maintain and
improve cognition (Duzel et al., 2016). In rodents, running in-
duces changes in brain neurotransmitter, neurotrophin levels,
neuronal morphology, and vascularization. In addition, hippo-
campus-dependent
memory
and
adult
neurogenesis
is
enhanced (Voss et al., 2013). In humans, there is a relationship
between aerobic capacity, hippocampal plasticity, and memory
(Duzel et al., 2016). However, peripheral mechanisms that elicit
these positive effects of running remain unclear.
Peripheral factors in the blood of young animals can improve
brain plasticity in aged animals (Katsimpardi et al., 2014). Given
that skeletal muscle plays a pivotal role in exercise (Hawley et al.,
2014), myokines (Pedersen and Febbraio, 2008) may influence
neural plasticity. Indeed, overexpression of peroxisome prolifer-
ator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator (PGC-1a) in muscle
increased production of Fibronectin type III domain containing 5
(FNDC5), which is cleaved and secreted as irisin, increasing hip-
pocampal Bdnf expression. Exercise elevates irisin in human
plasma (Wrann, 2015). Furthermore, PGC-1a1 overexpression
in muscle has an antidepressant-like effect by reducing entry
of neurotoxic kynurenine into the brain (Agudelo et al., 2014).
Moreover, spatial memory is enhanced by AICAR treatment in
wild-type (WT) mice (Kobilo et al., 2011), but not in muscle-spe-
cific AMPK mutant mice (Kobilo et al., 2014), supporting a link
between skeletal muscle and cognition.
In this study, using proteomic and biochemical analyses, we
found that secretory cathepsin B (CTSB) (Lemaire et al., 1997)
is a myokine that is increased in plasma and gastrocnemius mus-
cle by exercise in adult male mice. CTSB treatment of neural
cells in vitro enhanced expression of DCX and BDNF. CTSB
knockout (KO) mice showed deficits in spatial memory, adult hip-
pocampal neurogenesis, dentate granule cell (GC) physiology,
and hippocampal P11 levels. In Rhesus monkeys and humans,
treadmill exercise increased CTSB plasma levels. Moreover, in
humans, CTSB plasma levels were positively associated with
memory. Overall, CTSB may play an important role in the bene-
ficial effects of exercise on the brain.
RESULTS
Identification and Validation of Candidates
To model effects of exercise in vitro, we applied AMPK agonist
AICAR (100 mM) to L6 myoblast cells and analyzed the condi-
tioned medium (CM; Figures 1A and 1B). Specifically, L6
myoblast cells were differentiated for 8 days and CM was
collected after 6 hr of AICAR or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) treatment.
CM was used for silver staining based proteomic analysis (Fig-
ure 1B). Interestingly, CM from AICAR-treated cells revealed a
differential protein expression pattern as compared to vehicle
controls (Figure S1A). The differentially expressed bands were
excised and eluted. We analyzed the peptide sequence of
selected candidate proteins by mass spectrometry (Figure S1B).
First, we selected the candidates based on the estimated protein

 size between 37 and 50 kDa based on size marker (Bio-Rad).
Further evaluation was performed utilizing QSPEC (http://www.
nesvilab.org/qspec.php/), a secretory database (http://www.
spd.cbi.pku.edu.cn/spd_index.php), exercise microarray data
sets (GEO: GDS2234), and AICAR-treated microarray data sets
(GEO: GSE50873). The 37-kDa lysosomal cysteine protease
CTSB that has extracellular functions was selected (Figures 1A
and S1B).
Validation of CTSB Expression after Exercise
To validate CTSB as a candidate myokine that may affect the
brain, we studied Ctsb gene expression in differentiated
myoblast cells. After 8 days, cells were differentiated and starved
for 3 hr with serum-free media and incubated with vehicle or
AICAR (100 mM) at the indicated time points (Figure 1C). There
were significant differences in Ctsb gene expression between
time points (F(4,15) = 32.91, p < 0.0001). Specifically, short-term
treatment (3 hr) of AICAR increased Ctsb mRNA levels
(p < 0.0001; Figure 1C). However, there was no increment in
intracellular protein levels after treatment of AICAR as measured
by western blot (WB) analysis (Figure 1D). CTSB is known to
be secreted (Lemaire et al., 1997). Therefore, extracellular pro-
tein levels were measured by ELISA. CTSB was significantly
increased in differentiated L6 muscle cell lines after 100 mM of
AICAR treatment at 6 hr (t(6) = 3.67, p < 0.01) and at 12 hr
(t(6) = 2.86, p < 0.03) (Figure 1E). Furthermore, analysis of plasma
samples from mice (n = �6–8 per group) that were running for 3,
14, or 30 days showed changes in CTSB levels (F(5,35) = 4.64,
p < 0.0024). Specifically, plasma CTSB increased after 14 days
and 30 days (p < 0.044 and p < 0.0008, respectively) compared
to controls (Figure 1F). In addition, Ctsb gene expression and
protein amount was evaluated in muscle and other peripheral tis-
sues derived from long-term (30 days) voluntary wheel running
mice. Ctsb mRNA (t(14) = 2.613, p < 0.021) and protein (t(10) =
6.429, p < 0.03) levels increased in the gastrocnemius skeletal
muscle (Figures 1G and 1H). Ctsb mRNA expression was unal-
tered in soleus, white adipose tissue, liver (Figure S1C), and fron-
tal cortex (Figure S1D) and decreased in the spleen of running
mice (t(14) = 3.682, p < 0.0025; Figure S1C). These findings sug-
gest that running results in CTSB secretion from skeletal muscle.
Behavior in Sedentary and Running CTSB KO Mice
Increased levels of CTSB in plasma and skeletal muscle after
running led us to evaluate behavior in male CTSB KO and WT
littermate mice, housed under control (WT-S and KO-S) or
running (WT-R and KO-R) conditions (n = 7–9 per group). The
running
distances
did
not
differ
between
groups
(WT-R
[2,735 ± 196 m/day], KO-R [2,654 ± 321 m/day], and p > 0.05).
Motor Behavior
Locomotor activity in the open field was examined over 30 min.
Total distance traveled did not differ between groups (Figure 2A).
In addition, no difference between the groups was observed in
the latency to fall in the rotarod test (Figure S1E).
Mood-Related Behaviors
The forced swim test was used to test depression-like behavior.
There was a significant main effect of genotype on immobility
time (F(1,27) = 8.62, p < 0.007; Figure 2B). Immobility time was
reduced in the WT-R as compared to KO mice (p < 0.01). Mice
were also tested in the sucrose preference test to evaluate anhe-
donia (Figure S1F). In addition, the elevated plus maze test was
performed to assay anxiety (Figure S1G). There was no differ-
ence between the groups, consistent with previous research in
male KO mice (Czibere et al., 2011).
Spatial Memory
Mice (n = 7–9 per group) were trained in the Morris water maze.
There was no difference between the groups in acquisition of the
task (p > 0.05) (Figure 2C). After the last training day, probe trials
were conducted 24 hr and 48 hr later to evaluate retention of
spatial memory. The WT-R group preferred the platform quad-
rant compared to all other quadrants in both probe trials at
24 hr (F(3,32) = 14.38, p < 0.0001) and 48 hr (F(3,32) = 7.58,
p < 0.0006). The WT-S group showed target preference at
24 hr (F(3,32) = 11.54, p < 0.0001), but not at 48 hr (p > 0.05).
The KO groups did not exhibit target preference (Figure 2D).
Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis
Running-induced adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the
hippocampus is positively associated with memory (Voss et al.,
2013). Running did not improve memory in the KO mice.
There was a reduction in immature adult-born DCX+ Type C cells
in KO mice; main effect of genotype (F(1,28) = 7.735, p < 0.0074;
Figure 2E). DCX+ Type D cell count analysis showed main effects
of running (F(1,28) = 20.224, p < 0.0001) and genotype (F(1,28) =
13.438, p < 0.0005; Figure 2F). Type D cells were increased in
the WT-R group as compared to all other groups (p < 0.0002).
DCX staining is shown for each group (Figure 2G).
Electrophysiological Recordings from Dentate GCs
To determine whether CTSB KO affects memory function by
changing physiological properties of mature dentate GCs,
patch-clamp recordings were made of developmentally born
GCs (Nowakowski and Rakic, 1981). To evaluate GABAergic
inhibitory transmission, recordings of miniature inhibitory post-
synaptic currents (mIPSCs) were performed. mIPSCs frequency
was reduced in cells (n = 15) derived from KO mice as compared
to cells (n = 12) from WT (t(25) = 3.388, p < 0.005), suggesting
reduced inhibitory neurotransmission onto GCs (Figures 2H–
2L). Examination of intrinsic properties of mature GCs revealed
a more depolarized resting membrane potential in KO (�82.8 ±
2.2 mV) as compared to WT (�88.4 ± 0.49 mV) cells (t(17) =
2.62, p < 0.02). Other intrinsic properties, such as input resis-
tance, membrane time constant, and capacitance did not differ
between groups (p > 0.05).
Permeability of CTSB across the Blood-Brain Barrier
To test whether CTSB can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB),
rCTSB (50 mg per mouse) or vehicle (distilled water) was injected
intravenously (i.v.) into CTSB KO mice. At 15 minutes after i.v.
CTSB injection, there was a significant increase in blood
(104.21 ± 4.11 ng/ml versus control 2.25 ± 2.20 ng/ml;
t(4) = 21.87, p < 0.0001) and tissue derived from whole brain
(8.17 ± 0.90 ng/ml versus control 1.005 ± 0.46 ng/ml;
t(4) = 7.08, p < 0.021) CTSB levels.
CTSB Enhances DCX and BDNF Levels in aNPCs
Running increases hippocampal Ctsb mRNA (Figure 3A) and
adult neurogenesis. Therefore, we applied exogenous CTSB to
hippocampal progenitor cells with different dosages for 24 hr.

 There was no effect on proliferation (live cell portion) or survival
of aNPCs compared to controls (Figures S2A and S2B). We
further utilized neurogenesis pathway-specific PCR arrays
(SABioscience) to screen for genes regulated by rCTSB treat-
ment in the aNPCs. Of the 86 genes, 15 genes exhibited a
consistently changed expression level with 24 hr treatment of
100 ng/ml rCTSB as compared to basal differentiation media
(Figure 3B; Table S1). Two genes relevant to neurogenesis,
Dcx and Bdnf, were selected for validation of PCR array
screening. Dcx mRNA (F(2,9) = 5.74, p < 0.03) and Bdnf mRNA
expression increased (F(2,6) = 75.88, p < 0.0001) with rCTSB
(100 ng/ml) treatment, respectively (Figures 3C and 3D). Specif-
ically, Dcx mRNA expression after 48 hr of rCTSB was elevated
(p < 0.008). Furthermore, 24 hr of rCTSB increased Bdnf mRNA
compared to control (p < 0.0001; Figures 3C and 3D). Adminis-
tration of rCTSB (10 and 100 ng/ml) for 24 hr increased DCX

levels in aNPCs (Figure 3E).
Involvement of P11 Protein in CTSB Effects Neuronal
Cells
Exercise increases hippocampal P11 (S100A10) expression
(Sartori et al., 2011). In PC12 cells, P11 level was enhanced by
rCTSB (F(4,10) = 6.72, p < 0.007; Figures 3F and S2D), while hip-
pocampal P11was reduced in KO mice (t(7) = 2.41, p < 0.05;
Figure 3G). In addition, 12 (p < 0.002) and 24 hr (p < 0.041) of
rCTSB (100 ng/ml) increased Dcx mRNA compared to control
(0 hr; Figure S2C). P11 knockdown using small interfering (si)
RNA altered rCTSB treatment effect on DCX in PC12 cells
(F(1,8) = 9.36, p < 0.02). rCTSB elevated DCX levels in control,
but not P11 knockdown conditions (Figure 3H).
CTSB plays a role in cancer cell migration (Olson and Joyce,
2015). Five hours of rCTSB treatment affected PC12 cell migra-
tion (F(5,30) = 2.55, p < 0.048). Specifically, rCTSB (2 ng/ml)
increased PC12 cell migration (p < 0.003; Figure 3I). There was
also a significant interaction between P11 siRNA transfection
and rCTSB treatment (F(3,16) = 5.01, p < 0.012) on PC12 cell
mobility (Figure 3J). rCTSB did not enhance migration in P11
knockdown PC12 cells (Figures 3J and S2E).
P11 is associated with cholesterol-rich platforms on endoso-
mal membranes (Morel and Gruenberg, 2007), and CTSB is
also involved in peripheral cholesterol absorption (Wong et al.,
2013). Hippocampal 24-hydoxycholesterol levels, the form of
brain-specific cholesterol, was diminished in CTSB KO mice
compared to WT (t(10) = 2.55, p < 0.03; Figure 3K).
Treadmill Training Increases CTSB Plasma Levels in
Rhesus Monkeys and Humans
We evaluated CTSB levels in Rhesus monkeys and humans. In
monkeys, CTSB plasma levels were significantly greater in the
exercise group (4 months of treadmill training) compared to con-
trol subjects (p < 0.02; Table S2A). In humans, we analyzed two
forms of cathepsin, L (CTSL) and CTSB. CTSB plasma levels in
the training group differed significantly from control after
4 months of treadmill exercise (p < 0.048). There was no effect
on CTSL. In addition, Pearson correlation analyses across
groups revealed a positive correlation between fitness increase
(percentage change of VO2-VT) and changes in CTSB level after
4 months of treadmill exercise (r = 0.44; p < 0.016; Figure 4A;
Table S2B).
Cognition and CTSB Plasma Levels in Humans
Human subjects were tested in complex figure (CF) drawing
recall test. There was a positive correlation between pre-post dif-
ferences in CTSB plasma levels and late complex-object recall
score (CF-score) changes (r = 0.37; p < 0.01, one-tailed; and
p < 0.05, two-tailed). Partial correlations with VO2-VT as a con-
trol variable eliminated the correlation between CTSB and the
CF-score (r = 0.296; p = 0.16) indicating that the relationship be-
tween CTSB and CF recall was dependent on aerobic fitness
(Figure 4B; Table S2B).
DISCUSSION
Benefits of exercise for brain function depend on central and pe-
ripheral factors. Candidate myokine CTSB may be important for
brain plasticity. In vitro, AMPK activation elicited CTSB secretion
in skeletal muscle cells. In vivo, exercise elevated CTSB plasma
levels and hippocampal Ctsb gene expression, suggesting both
direct and indirect CTSB effects on brain function. Ctsb gene KO
precluded exercise induced enhancement of retention of spatial
memory and adult neurogenesis and reduced inhibitory trans-
mission onto dentate GCs and decreased hippocampal P11, a
protein needed for CTSB effects on neuronal differentiation
and migration. In primates, treadmill training elevated CTSB
plasma levels and may contribute to exercise-induced memory
benefits in humans.
Lysosomal cysteine protease CTSB is ubiquitously expressed
throughout the body (Turk et al., 2012). High levels are found in
multiple human cancers (Aggarwal and Sloane, 2014). The role

 of CTSB in normal physiology has remained unexplored. CTSB
was increased in plasma after long-term training in mice, Rhesus
monkeys, and humans. Voluntary wheel running in mice elevated
CTSB in plasma and gastrocnemius muscle, but not in other
organs. Long-term exercise can cause muscle injury and inflam-
mation. Transport and breakdown of amino acids and activation
of the immune response are required for muscle repair. Indeed,
gastrocnemius tenotomy upregulated CTSB and L activity (Har-
ris and Baillie, 1990). Our time-course of CTSB increase is
consistent with studies indicating that muscle regeneration after
exercise-induced lysosomal activation takes several weeks (Sal-
minen et al., 1984).
Our study suggests that CTSB is a myokine that can cross the
BBB. However, the role of CTSB in brain function has been
controversial. In a transient ischemia model, a CTSB inhibitor
prevented neuronal cell death (Yoshida et al., 2002). In addition,
CTSB was considered as a protease involved in cell death after
brain injury (Banerjee et al., 2015) and onset of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (Hook et al., 2008). However, CTSB is also reportedly neu-
roprotective (Bendiske and Bahr, 2003) with anti-amyloidogenic
properties (Mueller-Steiner et al., 2006). Furthermore, in double-
KO mice lacking both CTSB and CTSL there is brain atrophy (Fel-
bor et al., 2002).
CTSB may mediate the benefits of exercise for brain function
through several pathways. Running increased whole hippocam-
pus Ctsb gene expression. Running induces hypoxia (Radak
et al., 2013), which in turn may elevate brain CTSB levels (Yakov-
lev and Gulyaeva, 2015). This could promote clearance of neural
debris (Devi and Kiran, 2004) and adult neurogenesis, a process
implicated in memory function (Abrous and Wojtowicz, 2015).
Running increased neurogenesis in WT, but not CTSB KO
mice. In vitro analyses are consistent with in vivo observations.
Dcx and Bdnf levels increased after rCTSB administration in
aNPCs. Consistently, inhibition of both CTSB and CTSL reduced
hippocampal Bdnf expression (Bednarski et al., 1998). BDNF
regulates synaptic plasticity, cell survival, and differentiation
(Chao et al., 2006). DCX is important for neuronal migration, a
process critical for brain development (Kawauchi, 2015).
In WT, but not KO, mice running improved spatial memory.
These observations are compatible with the human exercise re-
sults. Plasma CTSB, but not CTSL (Felbor et al., 2002), levels
increased after 4 months of exercise and were positively corre-
lated with fitness levels. Humans were also tested for CF recall,
a task that is strongly dependent on the hippocampus (Vargha-
Khadem et al., 1997). The positive relationship of CTSB with
CF recall was dependent on exercise-induced changes in aero-
bic fitness. Aerobic activity is also associated with an increase in
hippocampal volume (Duzel et al., 2016). It will be of interest to
measure whether CTSB levels are correlated with hippocampal
gray matter volume.
In the periphery multifunctional adaptor protein P11, Annexin
A II light chain, is a known binding partner of CTSB in caveolae
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Cavallo-Medved
et al., 2009). Annexin A2 downregulation decreased CTSB
expression in human lung adenoma cells (Wang et al., 2012). In
the brain, exercise increases hippocampal P11 (Sartori et al.,
2011). P11 regulates serotonin (Svenningsson et al., 2013),
important for exercise-induced neurogenesis (Klempin et al.,
2013), as well as glutamate and GABA (Eriksson et al., 2013).
Hippocampal P11 expression and inhibitory neurotransmission
onto dentate granule was reduced in CTSB KO mice. Consis-
tently, hippocampal GABA is lower in P11 KO mice (Eriksson
et al., 2013). In vitro, DCX and migration of PC12 cells (Westerink
and Ewing, 2008), induced by CTSB treatment, was diminished
by P11 knockdown. P11 is also associated with cholesterol
formation (Morel and Gruenberg, 2007) and GABAergic signaling
is affected by membrane cholesterol amount (Sooksawate and
Simmonds, 2001). Reduced 24-hydroxycholesterol in CTSB
KO hippocampi may affect cognition.
Exercise increases CTSB in mouse and primate plasma. CTSB
deficiency in mice precludes benefits of running on spatial mem-
ory. In humans there is a positive correlation between CTSB
levels, fitness, and hippocampus-dependent memory. These
findings expand our understanding of how exercise-induced
peripheral factors boost brain function.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subjects
For animal experiments, 1-month-old C57BL/6 male (n = 64) mice were pur-
chased from Jackson Labs. Mice were individually housed in standard condi-
tions with food and water ad libitum.
For Rhesus monkey studies, monkeys (n = 13 [three female and ten male],
�6.9–20.7 years old) are housed individually in standard nonhuman primate
caging on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle.
Animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH guidelines. All proto-
cols for procedures were approved by the National Institute on Aging (NIA)’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
For human studies, healthy young adults (n = 43 [24 female], �19–34 years
old) were enrolled in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the
training or control group, matched by gender, age, and BMI. All subjects
signed written informed consent and received monetary compensation for
participation. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of
the University of Magdeburg, Germany.
Cell Culture
Rat L6 skeletal myoblast cells (ATCC CRL-1458, VA) were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS).
The aNPCs were grown in Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (1:50),
L-glutamine (1:100), EGF (20 ng/ml), bFGF (20 ng/ml), and heparin (20 ng/ml).
PC12 cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS.
Molecular Analyses
For quantitative (q)PCR analysis, total RNA was extracted from L6, aNPC, and
PC12 cells and various tissues using a total RNA extraction kit (Ribozol,
AMRESCO) according to the manufacturer’s manual.
For WB, equal amounts of protein lysates from cells and tissues were sub-
jected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a NC membrane (Millipore). Specific
signals were visualized by Odyssey (Amersham Biosciences).
For the ELISA assays, species-specific ELISA kits were used according to
the manufacturer’s specifications. The plate was read using SpectraMax
Plus 384 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).
Behavioral Testing
Mice were housed individually in standard or running wheel cages. After
4 weeks, mice were tested in the open field, rotarod, Morris water maze, forced
swim test, sucrose preference test, and elevated plus maze.
For detailed methods, see Supplemental Information.
