Background. Molecular diagnostics that rapidly and accurately predict fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance promise to improve 
treatment outcomes for individuals with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). Mutations in the gyr genes, though, can 
cause variable levels of in vitro FQ resistance, and some in vitro resistance remains unexplained by gyr mutations alone, but the 
implications of these discrepancies for treatment outcome are unknown.
Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 172 subjects with MDR/extensively drug-resistant TB subjects and 
sequenced the full gyrA and gyrB open reading frames in their respective sputum TB isolates. The gyr mutations were classified into 
2 categories: a set of mutations that encode high-level FQ resistance and a second set that encodes intermediate resistance levels. 
We constructed a Cox proportional model to assess the effect of the gyr mutation type on the time to death or treatment failure and 
compared this with in vitro FQ resistance, controlling for host and treatment factors.
Results. Controlling for other host and treatment factors and compared with patients with isolates without gyr resistance muta-
tions, “high-level” gyr mutations significantly predict poor treatment outcomes with a hazard ratio of 2.6 (1.2–5.6). We observed a 
hazard of death and treatment failure with “intermediate-level” gyr mutations of 1.3 (0.6–3.1), which did not reach statistical signif-
icance. The gyr mutations were not different than culture-based FQ drug susceptibility testing in predicting the hazard of death or 
treatment failure and may be superior.
Conclusions. FQ molecular-based diagnostic tests may better predict treatment response than traditional drug susceptibility 
testing and open avenues for personalizing TB therapy.

The use of molecular-based diagnostics for the detection of 
tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance is gaining traction globally [1]. 
Molecular diagnostics detect drug resistance genetic mutations 
in 1 or more Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) genes [2, 3]. 
Although the interpretation of the detected mutations in a par-
ticular MTB isolate is presently focused on a binary “resistant” 
or “sensitive” readout, it is well recognized that several genetic 
mutations can cause variable levels of drug resistance that may 
not be consistently classified as either resistant or sensitive [4, 
5]. The clinical implications of such “intermediate” mutations 
are unknown and necessitate a closer look at treatment out-
comes in patients whose isolates harbor these mutations. As we 
move beyond molecular diagnostics that focus on a handful of 
genes to whole-genome sequencing to detect resistance [6], the 
number of detected variants will grow, requiring an increasingly 
sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the impact of gen-
otypic drug resistance on treatment response.
Despite the wide use of molecular diagnostics, several open 
questions remain that limit their ability to fully replace cul-
ture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST), such as a sensitivity 
gap that is consistently found when molecular diagnostics are 
compared with culture-based tests for several second-line MTB 
drugs [7, 8]. For the fluoroquinolones (FQs), as many as 31% 
of moxifloxacin-resistant isolates have been reported to not har-
bor any resistance mutations [4, 7]. Culture-based DST is widely 
considered the gold standard diagnostic for MTB drug resist-
ance, although prospective data are limited on how well they pre-
dict clinical effectiveness [9]. In addition, there are well-known

issues with accuracy and reproducibility [10]. The ultimate goal 
of DST is to distinguish between MTB isolates that will or will 
not respond to a drug used in treatment. The determination of 
resistance, when reliable, should lead to the choice of an alter-
native drug. Here we compare molecular diagnostics with cul-
ture-based DST in predicting overall treatment outcome.
FQs are considered critical to effective multidrug-resistant 
(MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB treatment 
[11, 12]. FQs exert their antitubercular activity by inhibiting 
DNA gyrase, limiting DNA replication and transcription. MTB 
gyrase consists of 2 subunits encoded by the genes gyrA and 
gyrB [2, 13]; mutations in these genes are the main cause of FQ 
resistance in MTB [14]. Here we performed gyr sequencing and 
analysis on strains from patients from a previously described 
cohort study of MDR-/XDR-TB treatment outcome [11] to 
determine (1) the significance of “intermediate” gyr muta-
tions on treatment response and compare this with treatment 
response for “high” resistance level gyr mutations; and (2) how 
gyr mutation detection compares with FQ culture-based DST 
in predicting treatment response controlling for host and other 
drug resistance variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We studied a subset of patients from a retrospective cohort 
study (N = 669) of individualized MDR-/XDR-TB outpatient 
treatment in Lima, Peru, between 1 February 1997 and 31 July 
2003 [11, 15–18]. We excluded subjects with incomplete treat-
ment regimen composition data, and those not treated with 
FQs. Baseline DST was performed at the Massachusetts State 
Laboratory using the indirect proportion method on 7H10 
media for all drugs with the exception of pyrazinamide, which 
was tested using BACTEC, as described previously [18]. DST 
to the first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, eth-
ambutol, and streptomycin) was routinely performed. In >75% 
of subjects, DST was also performed to the following sec-
ond-line drugs: amikacin, capreomycin, cycloserine, ethion-
amide, kanamycin, and para-aminosalicylic acid; ciprofloxacin 
or ofloxacin; and either gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxiflox-
acin. Less than 25% of subjects had isolates tested to any of 
the following agents: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clofazimine, 
clarithromycin, or rifabutin. Regimens were constructed based 
on DST results and prior treatment according to previously 
described principles [19]. Data were collected and recorded in 
a Web-based electronic medical record during treatment [20]. 
A standardized paper records abstraction was conducted to 
complete the dataset.
Strain Selection, Sequencing, and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 
Testing
We selected MTB isolates with DST results for an FQ and an inject-
able (amikacin, capreomycin, or kanamycin) yielding confirmed 
XDR-TB, pre–XDR-TB, or MDR-TB with additional resistance 
to at least 1 tested agent (n = 176). We excluded subjects if the 
time from when an available archived TB isolate was collected to 
the start of MDR-TB treatment exceeded 18 months (n = 5). If 
multiple TB isolates were archived for a given subject, we chose 
the isolate obtained at the time closest to the MDR-TB treatment 
start, except when the isolates differed in their FQ resistance phe-
notype, in which case we chose the more highly resistant isolate. 
The 171 isolates underwent gyrA and gyrB gene sequencing using 
molecular inversion probes (MIPs) as part of a separate study 
[21]. Of the 171 archived isolates, 112 also underwent moxiflox-
acin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing at the 
Massachusetts State Laboratory between 2012 and 2013 using the 
indirect proportion method on 7H10 agar. Concentrations tested 
were 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mg/L; results were quality 
controlled as previously described [4].
Patient Variables and Outcomes
Monthly FQ exposure was classified as late-generation FQ 
administration (levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or moxifloxacin) 
for at least 75% of days in a month. Reference exposure was 
that to an early-generation FQ (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or 
sparfloxacin).
Exposure to an “otherwise adequate” regimen in the inten-
sive phase was defined as administration of at least 4 agents 
that were likely efficacious—including 1 of the injectable agents 
(kanamycin, capreomycin, amikacin), for at least 6 months 
after culture conversion. This distinguished likely activity of the 
companion drugs from that of the FQs; the latter, as represented 
by the presence of FQ resistance mutations, was the exposure of 
interest. The continuation phase of an otherwise adequate reg-
imen contained at least 3 likely efficacious oral drugs [19]. An 
agent (excluding FQs) was considered likely efficacious if either 
(1) all in vitro DST prior to the start of this regimen confirmed 
susceptibility to the agent used; or, (2) in vitro DST to the agent 
was not available and the subject had not received the agent 
for > 1 month prior to individualized treatment. If at least 75% 
of regimen days in a month met the adequate definition, that 
month was coded as “exposed.”
We also created a variable reflecting previous treatment. This 
was abstracted from the record and dichotomized into (1) less 
prior treatment, defined as ≤2 prior regimens, not including the 
standardized regimen for MDR-TB; and (2) more prior treat-
ment, defined as >2 regimens or prior treatment with the stand-
ardized regimen for MDR-TB.
Other covariates collected included demographics (age, sex, 
location of residence, treatment time period). Indicators of dis-
ease severity were collected including: hematocrit, nutritional 
status (body mass index [BMI] and clinical diagnosis of malnu-
trition), presence of extrapulmonary TB, respiratory difficulty 
(dyspnea or resting respiratory rate >26 breaths/minute), tachy-
cardia (heart rate >100 beats/minute), and cavitary and bilateral

disease on chest radiography. Comorbidities and risk factors—
substance and tobacco use, human immunodeficiency virus 
infection, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and renal disease, 
and psychiatric and seizure disorders—were also recorded.
Treatment outcomes (cure, completion, failure, death) were 
defined according to definitions in place at the time and as pre-
viously described [22]. There was no systematic follow-up after 
treatment completion to assess relapse. The primary study end-
point was time from initiation of the individualized regimen to 
death from any cause or treatment failure. Data were censored 
when an outcome other than death or treatment failure was 
recorded.
Sequencing and gyr Mutation Variables
Sequencing was performed between 2010 and 2012 using 
archived patient samples. The information from the sequenc-
ing was not used to guide clinical care. In brief, the gyrA and 
gyrB gene sequences were captured using MIPs [21] designed to 
cover both DNA strands of the open reading frames, promoter 
regions, and 100 flanking bases on either side of the selected 
genes. We called mutations using Bowtie [23] 0.12.7/ SAMtools 
[24] 0.1.18. We considered any synonymous mutations and the 
following polymorphisms in gyrA (E21Q, T80A, S95T, G247S, 
and G668D) neutral variants, as they are recognized to be neu-
tral variants or are known markers of genetic lineage [6, 7, 25]. 
Other gyr mutations detected (gyrA: A288D and R128K; gyrB: 
S486Y) were also considered to be neutral variants as they 
occurred outside of the gene resistance determining region [4].
We coded the gyr resistance mutation variable into 2 dichot-
omous indicator variables: The first indicated the presence of 
the gyrA mutations A90V and D94A, which are associated with 
intermediate MICs to moxifloxacin; and the second indicated 
gyr mutations that were associated with high MICs to mox-
ifloxacin (gyrA: D94G, D94N, D94Y, D89N, and S91P; gyrB: 
T539A, N538D, and E540D) [4, 26].
Analysis
We modeled the association between the gyr mutations and the 
hazard of death or treatment failure using Cox proportional 
hazards analysis. In addition to treatment variables, possible 
confounders of treatment response (including prior treatment, 
sex, age, and extent of disease on chest radiography identified 
as such based on previous evidence [11]) were evaluated for an 
association with hazard of death or treatment failure. Those 
variables that predicted the outcome at a P value ≤.20 were 
considered candidates for the multivariate model and retained 
if inclusion of that variable changed the effect estimate of gyr 
mutation in the model by ≥10%. In addition, we tested for inter-
action between the gyr variables and the late-generation FQ 
treatment variable (2 interaction terms). Finally, we compared 
the strength of the association with clinical outcomes across the 
indicators of resistance. First, we compared the coefficients for 
high and intermediate gyr mutations. We constructed a model 
containing indicator variables for both and then nested mod-
els containing both indicators but assuming equal coefficients. 
Similarly, to evaluate the clinical utility of FQ phenotypic DST 
vs gyr sequencing, we compared a model in which resistance 
was defined by presence of a high-level gyr mutation or by FQ 
DST, to 2 nested models: (1) in which resistance was defined 
by the presence of a high-level gyr mutation, and (2) in which 
resistance was defined by DST. In all cases, we used the like-
lihood ratio test (LRT) to assess the predictive power of the 
nested models. The comparisons were repeated for the different 
FQ exposures (ciprofloxacin, for which we had complete DST; 
and levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, which are considered to be 
more efficacious in treating MDR-TB).
The proportional hazards assumption was tested by exam-
ining the interaction between the gyr mutation variable and 
the treatment semester. Informative censoring was assessed by 
evaluating the association between default and the gyr variables. 
Missing values were multiply imputed using additive regression, 
bootstrapping, or predictive mean matching as implemented in 
the R “Hmisc” package version 4.0-1. All statistical tests were 
2-sided. Analyses were conducted using R version 3.3.2 and the 
“survival” package 2.40-1. Throughout, we used a P value cutoff 
of .05 to assess statistical significance.
Ethics Review
This retrospective study was approved by Harvard Medical 
School’s Committee on Human Studies, Partners Healthcare, 
and the Ministry of Health of Peru. These ethics boards did not 
require informed consent.
RESULTS
Of the 171 patients, 40% were female and the mean age was 
30 years (Table 1). Overall, the observed TB disease severity 
was high: 56% of the patients had cavitary or bilateral disease, 
43% were malnourished or had a low BMI, and 74% manifested 
respiratory distress. On average, the subjects’ TB isolates had 
phenotypic resistance to 6.4 drugs with 91 being XDR (53%) 
and 22 (13%) MDR with additional resistance to a second-line 
injectable (capreomycin, kanamycin, or amikacin) or an FQ—
that is, pre-XDR. Overall, more than half (55%) were resistant 
to either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin. On sequence analysis, 
12 isolates (7%) harbored the gyrA A90V mutation, and 8 (5%) 
the gyrA D94A mutation; another 24 isolates carried other gyr 
mutations that were previously associated with high-level mox-
ifloxacin resistance (Table 1). There were significant discrepan-
cies between gyr sequencing and each FQ DST, with 14%–53% 
of isolates found to be resistant in culture lacking specific gyr 
resistance mutations (Table 2). Nearly all patients with geno-
typic (42/44 [95%]) or phenotypic FQ resistance (90% [84/93] 
with ciprofloxacin resistance, 85% [40/47] with levofloxacin

resistance, and 93% [38/41] with moxifloxacin MIC >0.5 μg/mL) 
 
were treated with moxifloxacin or levofloxacin.
There were 40 deaths (23%) and 11 treatment failures (6%). 
Cure or completion was reported in 107 (62%) patients. Thirteen 
subjects (8%) were lost to follow-up or transferred out of care.
In univariate analysis, the administration of a late-generation 
vs early-generation FQ was not significantly associated with 
death or treatment failure; the administration of an otherwise 
adequate treatment regimen was highly protective (Table 3).
High-level gyr mutations predicted poor outcome (hazard ratio 
[HR], 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–3.84; P = .03), 
but the intermediate gyr mutations did not (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 
.69–3.16; P = .31). Upon adjustment for other covariates, includ-
ing interactions with FQ treatment that were not significant, the 
hazard associated with the presence of high-level gyr mutations 
increased to 2.60 (95% CI, 1.21–5.55; P = .01) (Table 4).
There was no difference in the relative strength of the associa-
tion between death and failure and the 2 gyr mutation categories,

high-level and intermediate (Table 5). The unadjusted rate of 
poor outcomes was higher for isolates sensitive by gyr sequenc-
ing but resistant by DST, than for those resistant by both 
measures (Table 6). We assessed if resistance determined by cul-
ture-based FQ DST was a better predictor of treatment outcome 
than gyr mutations. High-level gyr mutations were superior to 
ciprofloxacin DST alone, and were comparable to levofloxacin or 
moxifloxacin DST (Table 5). Resistance defined by the detection 
of any gyr resistance mutation (ie, high-level or intermediate) 
was also superior to resistance by ciprofloxacin DST alone (LRT 
χ2 = 4.7; P = .03) in predicting poor treatment outcome.
DISCUSSION
In this well-characterized treatment cohort in Peru with high 
levels of drug resistance, we found high-level gyr resistance 
mutations to be strongly associated with death or failure, 
 
controlling for severity of illness, comorbidities, and other tre
-at-
ment variables. Although patients with isolates harboring these 
mutations were disproportionately treated with late-generation 
FQs, these findings suggest that the regimens remain compro-
mised and should be reinforced in such patients. Isolates with 
the intermediate mutations gyrA A90V and D94A have been 
consistently observed to have lower levels of in vitro FQ resist-
ance [27]. These intermediate gyr mutations, occurring at simi-
lar frequency to high-level gyr mutations, were not significantly 
associated with treatment outcome, suggesting that patients 
with isolates harboring only these intermediate mutations may 
still respond to treatment with late-generation FQs. Both results 
are consistent with findings by Rigouts et al [26], which dis-
criminated between high-level and intermediate gyr mutations 
in their association with treatment failure (excluding death and 
default) of a 9-month standardized regimen (the “Bangladesh 
regimen”) containing high-dose, late-generation FQs. Rigouts 
et al did exclude MDR patients with resistance to second-line 
injectables, and did include additional gyr mutations in their 
intermediate category, notably all nonglycine mutations at 
codon 94 and all mutations outside of- codon 94 [26]. Although 
the association between our category of intermediate gyr muta-
tions and poor treatment outcome was not significant, the value 
of intermediate gyr mutations as a predictor of poor outcomes 
was not statistically distinguishable from that of high-level gyr 
mutations. Thus, the measurement of unfavorable outcomes in 
larger cohorts with intermediate mutations is necessary before 
any recommendation against treatment reinforcement can be 
made in this group.
The clinical significance of resistance classified by gyr muta-
tions was not enhanced by the information on resistance classi-
fication from culture-based DST. Rather, we observed improved 
prediction through the gyr mutation detection compared to 
ciprofloxacin DST, if not for the later-generation agents. This

 Genetic Determinants of TB Treatment Outcome • CID 2017:65 (15 October) • 1369
HRs of poor treatment outcome for all 3 FQ drug susceptibility 
tests were not statistically significant, our comparison with cul-
ture-based DST is the first to suggest that gyr mutation detec-
tion is as good, if not better, in identifying patients unlikely 
to respond to FQ treatment. We observed this to be the case 
even with the relatively small number of gyr mutations that we 
defined as relevant to FQ resistance. All gyr mutations that we 
used to define resistance are detectable by the HAIN MTBDRsl 
version 2.0, with the 2 intermediate mutations detected by the 
probes MUT1 (A90V) and MUT3A (D94A) [8, 30]. These 
results argue against focusing efforts on identifying additional 
mutations to close the sensitivity gap of FQ molecular diagnos-
tics using culture-based DST as a gold standard. Instead, they 
support a closer look at how isolates with different gyr resist-
ance mutations respond to therapy in the host.
There are several possible limitations. First, there may 
be unmeasured confounding in this retrospective study. 
Differences in treatment effectiveness, baseline disease severity, 
treatment-related adverse events, or comorbidities all have the 
potential to confound the association between FQ resistance 
and the patient outcome. Although we attempted to capture 
these effects using the covariates described, we had no measure-
ment of adverse events. Second, although we specifically selected 
patients with more advanced levels of resistance, the number of 
observed mutations was small, with only 45 of 172 isolates har-
boring gyr resistance mutation. This may have contributed to 
the limited power to detect a statistically significant difference 
between the HRs of the high and intermediate mutations.
This study represents the first attempt to compare molecular 
and culture-based FQ resistance in patients with pre–XDR-TB 
or XDR-TB on individualized therapy. This is an increasingly 
relevant question as TB programs roll out molecular diagnostics 
and grapple with interpreting discrepancies between them and 
traditional methods. Furthermore, it provides strong evidence 
that treatment reinforcement is needed in the case of high-level 
gyr mutations. For the first time, viable treatment alternatives 
exist for patients in whom regimens may be compromised by FQ 
resistance. Using the results of the validated, rapid molecular test 
for FQ resistance is a way to rule out use of the shortened regi-
men and rule in the use of bedaquiline or delamanid, per World 
Health Organization guidelines [31]. We present evidence that 
patients with resistance detected by phenotypic testing alone 
without gyr mutations or with only intermediate gyr mutations 
may still respond to conventional treatment with late-generation 
FQs, providing evidence that not all resistance mutations are 
equal in terms of treatment response. We anticipate that results 
from the large ongoing clinical trials on MDR-TB treatment will 
help validate these observations in the near future.
