Summary
Background Lifelong HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) has prompted an interest in two-drug regimens to minimise 
cumulative drug exposure and toxicities. The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of dolutegravir and rilpivirine suggest 
potential compatibility and effectiveness as a two-drug regimen. We aimed to investigate this two-drug regimen in a 
phase 3 study.
Methods We identically designed SWORD-1 and SWORD-2, which were open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, 
phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority studies in 12 countries evaluating efficacy and safety of once-daily dolutegravir 
50 mg plus rilpivirine 25 mg versus current ART regimen (CAR). We included participants aged 18 years or older who 
were on first or second ART with stable plasma HIV-1 RNA (viral load <50 copies per mL) for 6 months or longer at 
screening. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) with stratification by third-agent class, age, and planned 
participation in a bone mineral density substudy. The primary endpoint was proportion of participants with viral load 
lower than 50 copies per mL at week 48 among those individuals who received one or more doses of study medication. 
Investigators monitored adverse events to assess safety. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers 
NCT02429791 (SWORD-1) and NCT02422797 (SWORD-2).
Findings We screened for participants from April 14, 2015, to Oct 15, 2015, for SWORD-1 and from April 21, 2015, to 
Sept 25, 2015, for SWORD-2. We randomly assigned 516 participants to dolutegravir-rilpivirine and 512 to continue 
with CAR. At week 48 (last patient visit was Nov 22, 2016), in the pooled analysis of the intention-to-treat population, 
95% of participants had viral loads lower than 50 copies per mL in each group (486 of 513 in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine 
group vs 485 of 511 in the CAR group), with an adjusted treatment difference of −0·2% (95% CI −3·0 to 2·5) and 
showed non-inferiority with a predefined margin of −8%. 395 (77%) of 513 participants in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine 
group and 364 (71%) of 511 participants in the CAR group reported adverse events. The most common adverse events 
were nasopharyngitis (49 [10%] for dolutegravir-rilpivirine vs 50 [10%] for CAR) and headache (41 [8%] vs 23 [5%]). 
More participants taking dolutegravir-rilpivirine (17 [3%]) reported adverse events leading to withdrawal than did 
participants taking CAR (three [<1%]).
Interpretation Dolutegravir-rilpivirine was non-inferior to CAR over 48 weeks in participants with HIV suppression 
and showed a safety profile consistent with its components. Results support the use of this two-drug regimen to 
maintain HIV suppression.

Introduction
Treatment guidelines for adults with HIV-1 infection 
recommend first-line and second-line antiretroviral ther-
apy (ART) regimens comprising two nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a third drug from 
the boosted protease inhibitor, integrase strand transfer 
inhibitor (INSTI), or non-NRTI (NNRTI) classes. It 
has been noted that NRTIs have been associated with 
long-term negative mito 
chondrial, renal, cardiovascular, 
and bone-health effects, prompting clinicians to seek 
NRTI-sparing options to treat HIV-1 infection.1
With combination ART resulting in longer lifespans, 
ageing patients with HIV are confronted by a constellation 
of interrelated comorbidities and drug–drug interaction 
risks.2 Regimens comprising two antiretroviral drugs have 
been proposed to minimise cumulative drug exposure 
and reduce risks for long-term drug-related toxicities.3 
A systematic review2 of studies on two-drug regimens, 
from 2000 to 2014, showed mixed results. Most study 
populations were small, some trials had no active-control 
groups, or treatment durations were too short to support 
robust conclusions, and larger randomised trials had no 
independent confirmation from adequately powered 
follow-up 
trials.2 
Concerns 
surrounding 
two-drug 
regimens include questions about how they compare with 
triple therapy in terms of barrier to treatment-emergent

resistance and subsequent virological failure.4 Thus, the 
success of two-drug regimens might depend on choosing 
component drugs with complementary therapeutic, 
pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties.3
The properties of dolutegravir make it a suitable 
candidate to investigate in two-drug regimens. Its 
14-h plasma half-life and low-to-moderate pharma-
cokinetic variability between patients support once-
daily dosing.5 The drug–drug interaction risks with 
dolutegravir are low because of its minimal effect on 
hepatic enzymes and its virological potency without 
pharmacokinetic boosters.6 The safety and efficacy of 
dolutegravir 
have 
been 
extensively 
studied 
in 
treatment-naive7,8 and treatment-experienced9 patients 
with HIV-1 infection, and it has shown superiority or 
non-inferiority to comparator regimens, as well as 
efficacy, regardless of baseline viral load, in each of its 
phase 3 trials.7–9 Treatment-emergent resistance has not 
been reported in any previously ART-naive patient who 
received dolutegravir in these trials,7,8 and dolutegravir 
has been shown to retain activity against most drug-
resistance mutations selected by other INSTIs.10
Rilpivirine is an NNRTI with potent virological efficacy 
and favourable safety profiles when compared with other 
NNRTIs.11 Its 48-h half-life permits once-daily dosing12 
and has shown unchanged virological effectiveness 
against some resistance mutations selected by other 
NNRTIs.13 The properties of rilpivirine suggest that it 
might be compatible with dolutegravir in a once-daily 
two-drug regimen that blocks viral replication at two 
stages, thereby enhancing its ability to achieve virological 
control and suppression. A retrospective cohort study14 
of 152 treatment-experienced participants with HIV-1 
infection provided preliminary evidence of the safety and 
efficacy of a once-daily two-drug regimen composed of 
dolutegravir 50 mg and rilpivirine 25 mg. Dolutegravir-
rilpivirine was found to be well tolerated; 115 (99%) of 
116 participants remained free of virological failure, 
and 105 (91%) remained free of therapeutic failure after 
24 weeks. In the SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies, we 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed between April 17 and 27, 2017, for clinical 
trial publications, cohort studies, and review articles published 
in English from 2004 to 2017, using combinations, 
abbreviations, and variations of the search terms “HIV”, 
“antiretroviral therapy”, “dolutegravir”, “integrase strand 
transfer inhibitor”, “rilpivirine”, “non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor”, “nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor”, “dual therapy”, “two-drug regimens”, and “treatment 
simplification”. We used general Internet searches to acquire 
relevant practice guidelines and prescribing inserts from 
governmental, non-governmental, and corporate organisations. 
The evidence showed that two-drug regimens are being 
discussed and developed by investigators and clinicians to 
address emerging polypharmacy, lifelong cumulative drug 
exposure, ageing, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NRTI) toxicity issues being faced by patients with 
HIV-1 infection. The notion for treatment in HIV for almost 
20 years has been that three-drug regimens are required to 
provide adequate virological efficacy and a barrier to emergence 
of resistance. However, the development and regulatory 
approval of the potent integrase strand transfer inhibitor 
dolutegravir has facilitated development of two-drug regimens. 
The potency, safety, and high-resistance barrier of dolutegravir 
make it an optimal core drug for an NRTI, protease inhibitor, and 
booster-sparing two-drug regimen, and the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of rilpivirine suggest compatibility with dolutegravir.
Added value of this study
Results of the SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies show that 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine is non-inferior (predefined 
−8% non-inferiority margin) to the continuation of triple 
therapy, consisting of two NRTIs with a third drug belonging to 
the integrase strand transfer inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor, or protease inhibitor classes in 
maintaining virological suppression through 48 weeks. To date, 
these studies comprise the largest trial population in which the 
efficacy and safety of a two-drug regimen have been evaluated. 
These findings provide a robust demonstration of the suitability 
of this two-drug regimen, dolutegravir-rilpivirine, for 
maintenance of HIV-1 suppression in treatment-experienced 
adults. These studies might also help with the development of 
new two-drug regimens following careful selection of 
antiretroviral drugs based on their potency, safety profile, 
and pharmacokinetic properties.
Implications of all the available evidence
After the early attempts at treatment of HIV infection with 
combinations of two antiretroviral drugs encountered mixed 
efficacy and toxicity results, the development and real-world use 
of this approach in recent years since the advent of combination 
therapy with three drugs has been sparse. A systematic review of 
contemporary two-drug regimen studies revealed that the bulk 
of these studies were insufficiently powered to support robust 
conclusions regarding efficacy or had no independent 
confirmation in separate studies. The SWORD studies highlight 
the potential benefit of two-drug regimens composed of drugs 
chosen on the basis of their favourable properties (eg, virological 
efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, 
and resistance barrier) in highly adherent patients who might 
need to minimise the number of concomitant medications they 
are taking. As the population with HIV ages, polypharmacy 
might become a more important treatment consideration. 
Treatment simplification strategies with two-drug regimens 
such as dolutegravir-rilpivirine might become more prominent 
in treatment decisions.

aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dolutegravir-
rilpivirine compared with continuation of current ART 
regimen (CAR) for 48 weeks in a large randomised 
population with suppressed viral load.
Methods
Study design and participants
The SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies are identically 
designed, 148-week, phase 3, randomised, multicentre 
(12 countries; appendix), open-label, parallel-group, active-
controlled, non-inferiority studies. The studies were done 
under approval of national, regional, or investigational site 
ethics committees in accordance with the 2008 Declaration 
of Helsinki. Summaries of the SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 
protocols are available online.15,16
We included participants who were 18 years or older, 
were on their first or second ART regimen, and were 
stably suppressed (viral load <50 copies per mL) for 
6 months or longer at screening. Participants had no 
observed instance of viral load greater than 50 copies per 
mL in the 6-month period before screening and no more 
than one instance of viral load greater than 50 copies per 
mL but lower than 200 copies per mL in the previous 
period of 6–12 months before screening. Previous ART 
regimens consisting of two NRTIs plus a third drug 
(NNRTI, INSTI, or protease inhibitor) were allowed, 
including pharmacokinetically boosted protease inhibitors 
or unboosted atazanavir. Enrolment of participants with 
current or previous exposure to dolutegravir or rilpivirine 
was limited to about 10%. Key exclusion criteria included 
any major resistance-associated protease inhibitor, INSTI, 
NRTI, or NNRTI mutation17 or integrase resistance-
associated substitution R263K; severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh C); concurrent hepatitis B infection; 
anticipated need to receive hepatitis C therapy in the first 
48 weeks and interferon-based hepatitis C therapy 
throughout the study; substantial suicidality risk as 
determined by the site investigator; QT interval corrected 
according to Bazett’s formula of 450 ms or longer; and 
pregnancy or breast 
feeding. We also excluded patients if 
they switched to a second-line regimen (change of one or 
more drugs) because of virological failure on the first-line 
regimen (defined as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA 
≥400 copies per mL after initial suppression to <50 copies 
per mL). All participants gave written informed consent 
before the study began.
Randomisation and masking
We screened potential participants for 14–28 days, and we 
randomly assigned (1:1) those individuals who met the 
eligibility criteria to receive dolutegravir 50 mg and 
rilpivirine 25 mg once daily or continue CAR for 52 weeks. 
We stratified randomisation by baseline third-agent class 
(INSTI, NNRTI, or protease inhibitor), age group (< or 
≥50 years of age), and planned participation in a bone 
mineral density substudy (202094 substudy, number 
NCT02478632). The randomisation and stratification 
schedule was generated centrally with RandALL NG 
software. No blinding of the studies was required because 
they were open label. However, before the week 48 primary 
analysis, sponsor staff had no access to data summarised 
by actual randomised treatment.
Procedures
Participants took dolutegravir-rilpivirine at about the 
same time daily with a meal. We assessed participants 
during study visits at screening, day 1, weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 
36, and 48, and week 52 (CAR only) or withdrawal. The 
studies are in progress, with participants having viral load 
lower than 50 copies per mL at week 48 in the CAR group 
being switched to dolutegravir-rilpivirine at week 52 to 
allow time to confirm the week 48 viral load result. We 
used the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular, 
Des Plaines, IL, USA) to quantify plasma viral load (lower 
limit of detection of 40 copies per mL).
The confirmed virological withdrawal population in-
cluded all participants in the intention-to-treat-exposed 
popu 
lation (ie, all participants who received at least one 
dose of study medication) with a viral load of 50 copies 
per mL or greater and a second, confirmatory viral load of 
200 copies per mL or greater. The potential precautionary 
virological with 
drawal population included all participants 
with con 
secutive viral loads between 50 copies per mL 
and 200 copies per mL; these participants were evaluated 
for possible mitigating circumstances that could have led 
to these elevations in viral load. If no reason was identified 
or a participant did not achieve a viral load lower than 
50 copies per mL on a third test, we placed the participant 
in the precautionary virological withdrawal population. 
For participants who met virological with 
drawal criteria, 
genotypic and pheno 
typic resistance testing for reverse 
transcriptase, protease, and integrase was done by 
Monogram Bio 
sciences (South San Francisco, CA, USA). 
We analysed CD4 cell counts by flow cytometry.
Potential reasons for withdrawal from the study 
included drug substitution or dose modification; liver or 
renal toxicity; QT interval corrected according to Bazett’s 
formula of longer than 500 ms; grade 3 or worse allergic 
reaction or rash related to study medication; pregnancy; 
grade 4 clinical adverse event due to study drug; and use 
of certain prohibited medications.
Adverse events were volunteered by the participant, 
identified by an investigator questioning the participant, 
or detected by other means (eg, via central laboratory 
analysis, suicidality monitoring, or during a physical 
examination). Investigators noted adverse events as drug 
related when appropriate.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of 
participants in the intention-to-treat population with 
plasma viral load lower than 50 copies per mL at week 
48 using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
snapshot algorithm.18 We chose the intention-to-treat

population for the primary analysis to provide a conser-
vative approach to evaluation of virological efficacy by 
including participants who did not have full protocol 
compliance and were more likely to have virological failure 
in the snapshot analysis. We did a sensitivity analysis of 
efficacy in the per-protocol population (intention-to-treat 
population with the exception of participants with protocol 
violations that could affect the assessment of antiviral 
activity or participants who received the correct study 
medication for <90% of total time on treatment).
Secondary efficacy endpoints were snapshot efficacy at 
week 24 in the intention-to-treat population; snapshot 
efficacy at week 48 in the intention-to-treat population in 
subgroups defined by baseline third-agent class; changes 
in CD4 T-cell counts at weeks 24 and 48 in the intention-to-
treat population; and changes in CD4 T-cell counts at week 
48 in subgroups defined by baseline third-agent class. 
Secondary safety endpoints include incidence and severity 
of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities over 
48 weeks, proportion of participants who discontinued 
treatment because of adverse events over 48 weeks, change 
from baseline in fasting lipid concentrations at weeks 24 
and 48, and safety assessments based on third-agent 
treatment class (protease inhibitor, NNRTI, or INSTI). A 
secondary endpoint regarding virological outcomes was 
the incidence of observed genotypic and phenotypic 
resistance to CAR and to dolutegravir or rilpivirine 
compared with the confirmed virological withdrawal 
population. Secondary endpoints related to biomarkers 
included change from baseline in renal, bone, and 
cardiovascular biomarkers at week 48. Safety was 
monitored by adverse events, serious adverse events, and 
other clinical evaluations (appendix).
Endpoints regarding health outcomes were patient-
reported outcomes on the HIV Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire, status version (HIVTSQs); European 
Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels; and the Symptom 
Distress Module (appendix).
We did an interim futility analysis for the study’s 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to 
evaluate the efficacy of dolutegravir-rilpivirine about 
9 months after the first participant’s first study visit with 
the intention of having roughly 50% of participants reach 
week 24 in time for the IDMC to review the data before 
any participants reached the week 48 visit (primary 
endpoint). The sponsors were masked to this analysis. 
The IDMC reviewed a futility analysis and monitored the 
incidence of participants meeting confirmed virological 
withdrawal criteria by week 36, overall, and within the 
subset of participants switching from an NNRTI to 
ensure that participants were not being suboptimally 
treated. Following this review, the IDMC recommended 
continuing the study as planned without revision.
Statistical analysis
We designed SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 to ascertain if the 
antiviral effect of dolutegravir-rilpivirine once daily is 
non-inferior to CAR at week 48. Two studies were done 
rather than one larger trial to comply with regulatory 
guidance and show reproducibility in the efficacy 
and safety analyses across two international multicentre 
studies, each enrolling 500 participants or more. 
The sample size in each study was calculated at 
238 participants per group assuming a true 87% response 
rate (ie, viral load <50 copies per mL at week 48) in 
each group and a 2·5% one-sided significance 
level to provide 90% power to infer non-inferiority 
with a –10% non-inferiority margin chosen to ensure 
reasonable preservation of treatment effect in the 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine group. A pooled analysis of all 
SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 data was predefined, and a non-
inferiority margin of −8% was used to provide additional 
stringency on the analysis of the larger combined 
population. We calculated the Cochran- 
Mantel-Haenszel 
treatment difference (dolutegravir- 
rilpivirine response 
rate minus CAR response rate) adjusted for baseline ART 
third-agent class (ie, INSTI, NNRTI, or protease inhibitor) 
and age group (ie, <50 years or ≥50 years) to minimise the 
potential for these variables to confound the analysis. 
We calculated the treatment difference (dolutegravir-
rilpivirine failure rate minus CAR failure rate) adjusted 
for the same factors as a complementary analysis, with a 
non-inferiority margin of 4% consistent with updated 
guidelines from the US FDA.18 We based non-inferiority 
of the primary endpoint on the difference in response 
rates. We did all data analysis using SAS software 
(version 9.1.3 or higher). The trials are registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02429791 (SWORD-1) 
and NCT02422797 (SWORD-2).
Role of the funding source
ViiV Healthcare was the financial and regulatory sponsor 
and participated in designing the trial and collecting, 
analysing, and interpreting data. Janssen Pharmaceutica 
NV participated as a partner in the development of the 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine two-drug regimen. All authors 
had full access to the data and are responsible for the 
veracity and completeness of the reported data. The 
corresponding author had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
We screened for participants from April 14, 2015, to 
Oct 15, 2015, for SWORD-1 and from April 21, 2015, to 
Sept 25, 2015, for SWORD-2. The week 48 analysis 
for both studies included data until Nov 22, 2016. 
Of 1339 participants screened across both studies, 
1028 (77%) were randomly assigned to switch to 
dolutegravir- 
rilpivirine (n=516) or continue CAR 
(n=512; figure 1). The intention-to-treat and safety 
populations included 1024 participants (figure 1).

number of participants for a planned substudy of 
bone mineral density.
Demographic and key baseline clinical characteristics 
for the intention-to-treat population were well balanced 
across treatment groups (table 1). Participants were 
mostly white (819 [80%] of 1024), with a median age of 
43 years (range 21–79; table 1) in both groups. At 
screening, most participants were being treated with 
ART that included tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or 
emtricitabine (table 1). Women accounted for 22% of 
participants in the pooled study population, and most 
participants were younger than 50 years old (table 1).
59 protocol deviations leading to exclusion from 
the 
per-protocol 
analysis 
were 
reported 
among 
56 participants in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group 
versus 67 protocol deviations among 58 participants in 
the CAR group (figure 1). The most frequent protocol 
deviations were not meeting eligibility criteria and 
taking pro 
hibited medications. Withdrawals were 
similar across treatment groups, and the most common 
reason for withdrawal in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine 
group was adverse events (figure 1). In the CAR group, 
the most common reasons were withdrawal of consent 
and protocol deviation (figure 1). Six participants were 
withdrawn because of investigators’ assessment of lack 
of efficacy (figure 1).
As recommended by the IDMC, the study progressed 
through completion of the week 48 primary endpoint 
analysis. This analysis revealed that 240 (95%) of 
252 participants in the SWORD-1 population and 
246 (94%) of 261 participants in the SWORD-2 population 
maintained viral loads of lower than 50 copies per mL 
after switching to dolutegravir-rilpivirine, compared with 
245 of 256 (96% in SWORD-1) and 240 of 255 (94% in 
SWORD-2) who remained on CAR (figure 2). In the 
pooled analysis of the intention-to-treat population, 
95% of participants maintained viral loads lower than 
50 copies per mL in both treatment groups (486 of 513 in 
the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group vs 485 of 511 in the 
CAR group) with an adjusted treatment difference of 
−0·2% (95% CI −3·0 to 2·5; figure 2) that confirmed non-
inferiority of dolutegravir-rilpivirine. A sensitivity analysis

with the primary analysis. Fewer virological failures 
were reported in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group than 
the CAR group (figure 2). Dolutegravir-rilpivirine was 
non-inferior to CAR in the proportion of participants 
classified as virological failures (−0·5%, −1·4 to 0·5), with 
a predefined non-inferiority margin of 4%.
Of the three virological failures in the dolutegravir-
rilpivirine group, one met precautionary virological 
withdrawal criterion, but no study resistance testing was 
done because the viral load was lower than 200 copies 
per mL. Two participants met the confirmed virological 
withdrawal criterion; we did viral resistance testing using 
findings in one participant with identified non-adherence 
while receiving dolutegravir-rilpivirine. The data showed 
the NNRTI resistance-associated substitution K101K/E 
mixture with no decreased susceptibility to rilpivirine 
(1·2-fold change); we did not observe any inte-
grase resistance substitutions or decreases in dolutegravir 
susceptibility. 
This 
participant’s 
viral 
load 
was 
1 059 771 copies per mL at week 36; upon resum-
ing dolutegravir-rilpivirine, the viral load decreased to 
1018 copies per mL after 18 days and further decreased to 
lower than 50 copies per mL at the withdrawal visit 
(week 45, while still taking dolutegravir-rilpivirine).
Median CD4 cell counts increased from baseline to 
week 48 (by 28·0 cells per µL, IQR −55·0 to 112·5 in the 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine group vs by 22·0 cells per µL, 
−46·0 to 108·0 in the CAR group). Subgroup analyses by 
age, sex, race, baseline third-agent class, and baseline 
CD4 cell count gave consistent results to support overall 
findings (figure 3).
After switching to dolutegravir-rilpivirine, 395 participants 
(77%) reported at least one adverse event by week 48 
compared with 364 participants (71%) who continued with 
CAR (table 2). The most frequent adverse events were naso-
pharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, 
diarrhoea, back pain, bronchitis, influenza, and arthralgia, 
with very few grade 2 or worse events in these categories 
(table 2, appendix). Adverse events considered to be drug 
related by the site investigator were reported more 
frequently in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group than the 
CAR group (table 2). Adverse events leading to withdrawal 
by week 48 were reported in 17 participants (3%) in the 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine group and three (1%) in the CAR 
group (table 2).
Neuro 
psychiatric adverse events were reported more 
frequently in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group than in the 
CAR group (table 2). Insomnia (17 [3%] of 513 in the 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine group vs ten [2%] of 511 in the CAR 
group), depression (17 [3%] vs six [1%]), anxiety (11 [2%] vs 
eight [2%]), and abnormal dreams (six [1%] vs 0) were the 
most commonly reported neuropsychiatric adverse events 
at week 48, with steady incremental increases reported in 
these events at weeks 4, 12, and 24 in the dolutegravir-
rilpivirine group (appendix). Few of these events resulted 
in withdrawal from either group. Other neuropsychiatric 
adverse events were reported in fewer than 1% of 
participants in each group. Most psychiatric events were 
grade 1 or 2 (appendix), with seven participants reporting 
grade 3 or 4 events (five [1%] of 513 in the dolutegravir-
rilpivirine group vs two [<1%] of 511 in the CAR group). 
Neuropsychiatric adverse events considered to be drug 
related by the investigator were more frequent in the 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine group (26 [5%] of 513) than in the 
CAR group (two [<1%] of 511), with five participants

(n=1 grade 4 anxiety, n=1 grade 3 suicidal ideation, and

Compared 
with 
continuing 
CAR, 
switching 
to 
dolutegravir- 
rilpivirine had no effect on serum concen-
trations of total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and 
triglycerides and no effect on the ratio of total to HDL 
cholesterol (figure 4). The decrease in serum concentrations 
of bone-turnover biomarkers, including bone-specific 
alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 
N-terminal propeptide, and type 1 collagen cross-linked 
C-telopeptide from baseline to week 48 in the dolutegravir-
rilpivirine group differed from the change in the 
CAR group (figure 4). No consistent pattern of change 
from baseline to week 48 or differentiation between 
the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group and the CAR group 
was observed for the inflammatory or cardiovascular 
biomarkers: interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, soluble 
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble CD14, soluble 
CD163, fatty acid binding protein-2, and d-dimer (data not 
shown). A change in fasting glucose concentrations was 
observed in both treatment groups (median 0·00 mmol/L 
[IQR −0·30 to 0·40] in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group vs 
0·20 mmol/L [−0·10 to 0·50] in the CAR group; median 
baseline value for each group was 5·00 mmol/L). Greater 
decreases were observed in urine retinol-binding protein 
and urine β-2-microglobulin in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine 
group than in the CAR group; and no change from 
baseline was observed at week 48 in serum cystatin C or 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (using cystatin C) in 
either group (irrespective of receiving tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate at baseline; appendix).
At baseline, similar HIVTSQs total scores were 
noted in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group (mean 54·4 
[SD 6·4]) and the CAR group (53·9 [6·6]). Greater 
improvements in HIVTSQs total score from baseline to 
week 48 were observed in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine 
group (increase of 1·5; 55·9 [7·0]) than in the CAR 
group (increase of 0·4; 54·3 [6·0]). Baseline HIVTSQs 
Lifestyle/Ease subscores were 27·5 [3·2] for the 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine group and 27·2 [3·3] for the 
CAR group, with slightly greater improvements at 
week 48 observed in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group 
(increase of 0·8; 28·3 [3·0]) compared with the CAR 
group (increase of 0·1; 27·3 [3·7]; p<0·0001). No

compared with the CAR group (11·0 [11·2] at baseline vs

in 
both 
groups 
(mean 97·85% [SD 4·22] in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine 
group vs 98·30% [3·91] in the CAR group).
Discussion
To our knowledge, the SWORD trials have enrolled the 
largest randomised study population for the evaluation of a 
two-drug regimen so far2 and both the individual SWORD-1 
and SWORD-2 studies and the pooled SWORD data 
analysis showed non-inferiority in the main 
tenance of 
virological suppression over 48 weeks following a switch to 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine compared with con 
tinuing CAR. 
Notably, the non-inferiority margins (−10% for individual 
studies and −8% for pooled analysis) were more stringent 
than the −12% non-inferiority margin used in previous 
studies7,19–21 in this therapy area. The pattern of response 
rates was consistent across subgroups defined by age, sex, 
race, baseline CD4 cell count, and baseline third-agent 
class. Only a few virological failures occurred in the pooled 
SWORD population at week 48, with non-inferiority of 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine in this measure shown at an 
FDA-defined margin of 4%.
Only one mixed NNRTI resistance-associated mutation, 
with no loss in rilpivirine susceptibility and no INSTI 
genotypic or phenotypic resistance, was identified in one 
participant 
taking 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine 
who 
had 
acknowledged poor adherence before the elevated viral 
load result. Nevertheless, this participant was able to 
achieve viral load lower than 50 copies per mL again after 
re-establishing adherence with dolutegravir-rilpivirine 
dosing. The single drug-resistant mutation observed 
(one [<1%] of 513) might reflect the high barrier to 
resistance of this dolutegravir-based combination and is 
lower than the low rate of treatment-emergent resistance 
reported in the SPIRIT trial (four [1%] of 469),20 which 
studied switching to rilpivirine-emtricitabine-tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate from ritonavir-boosted protease 
inhibitor therapy in participants with HIV suppression. 
No integrase resistance- 
associated substitutions were 
observed. The SWORD study results indicate that 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine maintained HIV-1 suppression 
with no increased risk of developing resistance.
An important consideration regarding the balance of 
adverse event reporting between the treatment groups is 
that all participants were stable on their current regimen

for at least 6 months before screening. Therefore, we 
expected participants in the CAR group to tolerate con-
tinuation of CAR without substantial new adverse events. 
Similar differences in adverse events leading to withdrawals 
have been noted in other switch studies in which 
participants who stayed on their current regimen reported 
fewer new adverse events than participants in the switch 
group.20,22 Accordingly, patients on ART outside of clinical 
trials tend to switch to and stay on better-tolerated regimens. 
In the STRIIVING study,22 75% of patients who switched to 
dolutegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine reported adverse 
events at week 48, with 4% having adverse events leading to 
withdrawal by week 24. Likewise, more discontinuations 
due to adverse events were reported after both immediate 
and delayed switch to rilpivirine-emtricitabine-tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate relative to the comparator in the 
SPIRIT study.20 The open-label design of the SWORD 
studies might also have affected the greater frequency of 
adverse events in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine groups. The 
most frequent adverse events considered to be related to 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine were aligned with adverse events 
commonly reported with most ART regimens in previous 
clinical trials. No new or signature drug-related adverse 
events were observed with this combined therapy that were 
not already recognised with the use of the individual 
components, and no increase was seen in overall frequency 
or severity of drug-related adverse events. This absence of 
additive adverse reactions is not surprising given the lack of 
drug interaction between dolutegravir and rilpivirine.23
Most neuropsychiatric adverse events were grade 1 
or 2 and not considered to be related to dolutegravir-
rilpivirine. These adverse events often occurred in 
participants with previous history of anxiety, depression, 
or insomnia. Because participants in the CAR group were 
accustomed to their study regimen, few neuro 
psychiatric 
adverse events were expected in this group. Additionally, 
the eligibility criteria excluded participants who posed a 
clinically significant suicidality risk based on history of 
suicidal behaviour or ideation at baseline. Finally, the 
incidence of neuropsychiatric adverse events in the 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine group was consistent with rates 
described in a review24 of previous dolutegravir trials, 
further supporting the absence of any additive or 
synergistic effects of the two-drug regimen.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a component of most 
participants’ CAR at baseline, is closely associated with 
bone demineralisation.25 From baseline to week 48, 
dolutegravir-rilpivirine was associated with larger re-
ductions in bone-turnover biomarkers (ie, specific 
alkaline phosphatase, procollagen type 1 N-terminal 
propeptide, osteocalcin, type 1 collagen cross-linked 
C-telopeptide) compared with the CAR group in which 
most participants remained on regimens containing 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Increased bone-turnover 
biomarkers have been linked to increased bone loss. We 
anticipated that the decrease in bone-turnover biomarkers 
would be associated with preservation of bone health and 
improvement in bone mineral density following the 
switch to dolutegravir-rilpivirine.
Additionally, we noted a neutral effect on serum lipids 
in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group, despite more than 
70% of these participants being switched from tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate, which has been reported to be a 
lipid-friendly drug. This outcome might be an important 
consideration for older patients living with HIV. More-
over, the neutral effect on lipids could reflect the absence 
of a booster drug in this two-drug regimen, which can 
also reduce the potential for drug interactions and can 
be especially important for patients with extensive poly-
pharmacy burdens. The changes in inflam 
matory or 
cardiovascular biomarkers from base 
line to week 48 
were similar, with no consistent pattern to differentiate 
between the groups, so no loss of inflam 
matory control

was identified following the switch to this two-drug 
regimen. Assessment of renal tubule function showed a 
favourable effect of dolutegravir-rilpivirine compared 
with CAR.
The SWORD studies had some limitations on the 
assessment of efficacy and safety. The open-label design 
might induce bias in both physicians and participants 
based on their knowledge about the treatment. However, 
blinding the study medication using a double-dummy 
design would not have been feasible because it would have 
resulted in an unacceptably high pill burden, possible 
negative effects on adherence, and the potential to 
compromise the evaluation of the endpoints regarding 
health outcomes. A concern with open-label designs is that 
knowledge of treatment might affect safety reporting such 
that more adverse events are reported with novel, 
experimental treatments (ie, dolutegravir-rilpivirine in the 
SWORD studies) versus control regimens (ie, CAR). 
Another limitation is that the SWORD studies were not 
done in lower-income countries, making it unclear if the 
results would be relevant in such settings. A strength of 
the SWORD studies was the successful recruitment of 
commonly under-represented subpopulations, including 
women and participants aged 50 years or older. A very low 
and non-inferior virological non-response rate was 
observed across both treatment groups, and the two-drug 
regimen showed no increased risk for selection of resistant 
HIV-1 infection. To date, the only two-drug regimens that 
have shown non-inferiority in randomised clinical trials 
have included a boosted protease inhibitor (lopinavir, 
atazanavir, or darunavir).19,26 However, the use of ritonavir 
as a pharmacokinetic enhancer involves an increased risk 
of pharmacokinetic interactions and various toxicities 
when used with some protease inhibitors.27
Once-daily oral dolutegravir-rilpivirine would be the first 
oral two-drug regimen that provides patients with an 
alternative to guideline-preferred triple-drug regimens, 
avoids major NRTI toxicities, has limited potential for 
drug–drug interactions, and does not increase lipid 
concentrations or inflammatory biomarkers. Endpoints 
regarding health outcomes indicated that patients 
maintained similar levels of satisfaction with dolutegravir-
rilpivirine relative to previous regimens and did not report 
more symptoms during treatment with dolutegravir-
rilpivirine. Another potential benefit is the possibility that 
this novel two-drug regimen could be formulated into one

of the smallest complete fixed-dose combination tablets 
available because it requires only 75 mg of active 
ingredients (dolutegravir 50 mg and rilpivirine 25 mg). 
Planned secondary analyses of long-term SWORD 
endpoints will provide important longitudinal data about 
the safety of dolutegravir-rilpivirine and its ability to 
prevent virological failure and treatment-emergent 
resistance for extended periods.
