Background: Campaigns aimed at raising cancer awareness and encouraging early presentation have been implemented in
England. However, little is known about whether people with low cancer awareness and increased barriers to seeking medical help
have worse cancer survival, and whether there is a geographical variation in cancer awareness and barriers in England.
Methods: From population-based surveys (n ¼ 35 308), using the Cancer Research UK Cancer Awareness Measure, we calculated
the age- and sex-standardised symptom awareness and barriers scores for 52 primary care trusts (PCTs). These measures were
evaluated in relation to the sex-, age-, and type of cancer-standardised cancer survival index of the corresponding PCT, from the
National Cancer Registry, using linear regression. Breast, lung, and bowel cancer survival were analysed separately.
Results: Cancer symptom awareness and barriers scores varied greatly between geographical regions in England, with the worst
scores observed in socioeconomically deprived parts of East London. Low cancer awareness score was associated with poor
cancer survival at PCT level (estimated slope ¼ 1.56, 95% CI: 0.56; 2.57). The barriers score was not associated with overall cancer
survival, but it was associated with breast cancer survival (estimated slope ¼ � 0.66, 95% CI: � 1.20; � 0.11). Specific barriers, such
as embarrassment and difficulties in arranging transport to the doctor’s surgery, were associated with worse breast cancer survival.
Conclusions: Cancer symptom awareness and cancer survival are associated. Campaigns should focus on improving awareness
about cancer symptoms, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas. Efforts should be made to alleviate barriers to seeking
medical help in women with symptoms of breast cancer.
Cancer accounts for more than 130 000 deaths each year in
England (Office for National Statistics, 2012a). Survival for most
types of cancer is lower in England than in comparable Western
European countries (Berrino et al, 2007), and in other high-income
countries, such as Canada and Australia (Coleman et al, 2011). The
National Health Service (NHS) in England has introduced several
cancer plans, highlighting early diagnosis as a key strategy to
improve cancer survival (Department of Health, 2000, 2011, 2014).
Since Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer in 2011, more
than d450 million has been invested in raising cancer awareness
and encouraging early diagnosis in England (Department of
Health, 2014). A number of ‘Be Clear on Cancer’ campaigns were
developed
to
improve
recognition
of
early
symptoms
and
encourage prompt visits to the doctor for the most common types

 of cancer, such as breast, lung, and bowel cancer (Cancer Research
UK, 2015). The underlying assumption was that survival would be
improved if people recognised symptoms early and sought medical
help before developing advanced-stage cancer. Short-term survival
is particularly sensitive to stage of disease and therefore to
timeliness of cancer diagnosis.
It is not clear what effect, if any, cancer awareness and barriers
to help seeking have on cancer survival. The most appropriate
research design to address this question would be a prospective,
cohort study examining the predictive value of symptom recogni-
tion or barriers to help seeking on cancer survival. Such a study has
not yet been carried out. It is also difficult to assess the effects of
intermediary factors, such as time from the onset of symptoms to
presentation, time from presentation to starting a treatment, stage
of disease, and types of treatment. Ironmonger et al (2014)
evaluated the first national campaign and a regional campaign in
England, both aimed at raising public awareness of a persistent
cough as a lung cancer symptom. They reported an increase in
cancer awareness, a shift to earlier stage at diagnosis, and a higher
surgical resection rate after both campaigns, compared with 1 year
before. Data on survival were available only for the regional
campaign, and suggested a statistically nonsignificant increase in
1-year survival in the pilot compared with control areas.
Evidence suggests a wide geographical variation in cancer
survival in England, with lower survival in the north compared
with the south of the country (Quaresma et al, 2011; Walters et al,
2011). Quaresma et al (2011) showed that the geographical
variation in 1-year cancer survival at primary care trust (PCT) level
is constant year- on year, from 1996 to 2009. The PCTs were the
statutory NHS bodies, structured as small geographical areas,
responsible for commissioning and providing most health services
in England until 2013 (NHS, 2012). Walters et al (2011) reported
the same geographical patterns, with generally lower cancer
survival in northern England, for patients diagnosed between
1991 and 2006, using Cancer Network areas. These studies
analysed survival from the most common types of cancer, such
as lung, breast, and bowel.
To explore reasons for variation in cancer survival between
countries with similar health-care systems, including Australia,
Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom,
Forbes et al (2013) examined differences in cancer awareness and
barriers to help seeking. Although the United Kingdom, with the
lowest cancer survival, had low average cancer awareness and
the highest barriers, there was no consistent pattern across the
participating countries. For example, Denmark, also with poor
cancer survival, had low levels of barriers. However, it may be
difficult to detect any patterns at an international level. The
assessment of differences in cancer awareness and barriers by
much smaller geographical region in a single country may offer a
more salient explanation of cancer survival differences. This study
aimed to identify how cancer symptom awareness and barriers to
help seeking vary by small geographical region (PCT) in England,
and whether average levels of awareness and barriers are associated
with cancer survival at the PCT level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Material. Data from population-based surveys, using the Cancer
Research
UK
Cancer
Awareness
Measure
across
England
(n ¼ 49 270), were linked with cancer survival data from the
National Cancer Registry at the Office for National Statistics. These
two data sets were linked based on matching by the relevant
geographical area (PCT) in England. To make the matching
procedure more reliable we used cancer survival data of patients
diagnosed in 2010 only, because most CAM surveys were
conducted in that year (range: 2009–2011). This meant that
both patients and survey participants would have been exposed to
the same media health messages and local cancer awareness
campaigns, delivered in their area of residence up to 2010.
On one side, we used data from the surveys, described in detail
elsewhere (Niksic et al, 2015), carried out in 92 PCTs out of the
151 PCTs in England at the time. The response rate was 51%. The
surveys questions used to assess cancer symptom awareness
(summed up recognition of 9 cancer symptoms) and barriers to
help seeking (summed up reporting of 10 barriers to help seeking)
are available in Supplementary Material.
To allow reliable calculations of awareness and barriers scores,
we included only 52 PCTs, which had at least 90 participants in
total, with available data in each sex and age category (15–44; 45–
54; 55–64; 65–74; and 75 þ years). To calculate the symptom
awareness score, for each participant we added up the positive
responses (‘Yes’) to the questions about the recognition of nine
cancer symptoms (Niksic et al, 2015). We then calculated the
arithmetic mean of this score for each combination of PCT, sex,
and age group. We took the same approach with calculating the
barriers score, using positive responses (‘Yes often’ or ‘Yes
sometimes’) to questions about 10 barriers to help seeking. To
standardise the awareness and barriers scores by age and sex, we
used the age and sex weights developed by the Cancer Research UK
Cancer Survival Group, at London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine. The same weights were also used for the calculation of
cancer
survival
index
(and
site-specific
indices).
The
only
difference between these weights was that cancer survival indices
were also weighted for the type of cancer. This made the
comparison between the awareness and barriers score and cancer
survival indices more reliable. It also allowed us to avoid using the
same weights for the elderly and the young people living in each
PCT who have different risks of being diagnosed with cancer and
different cancer survival. The same approach was used with
calculating individual symptoms and barriers.
On the other side, we used data from the National Cancer
Registry to calculate net cancer survival. Net survival was defined
as survival from a cancer of interest in the absence of death from
other causes, estimated from population life tables (Perme et al,
2012). The life tables were stratified by every year of age, sex,
and socioeconomic deprivation categories for the calendar years
2010–2011, and developed by Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival
Group, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
The survival index was calculated as 1-year net survival for all
cancers combined, except non-melanoma skin and prostate cancer,
standardised for type of cancer, sex, and age, in five age categories
(15–44; 45–54; 55–64; 65–74; and 75 þ
years) for patients
diagnosed in 2010 and followed up until 2011. Patients diagnosed
with non-melanoma skin cancer were excluded because these
malignancies are rarely fatal and extremely rarely linked with
metastases (NCIN, 2013). Registries in the United Kingdom have
incomplete data on non-melanoma skin cancer that is often
underreported, and many patients are treated topically without
pathological verification and in the private sector (Goodwin et al,
2004; NCIN, 2013). Prostate cancer was excluded because the
widespread introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing
since the early 1990s introduced difficulties in the interpretation of
survival trends (Pashayan et al, 2006). The exclusion of non-
melanoma skin cancer and prostate cancer is the common
procedure in calculation of the cancer survival index in England,
published annually by the ONS (Office for National Statistics,
2012b).
This index was designed to support the evaluation of the effects
of early diagnosis, and to provide a single summary measure of
cancer survival, for the purpose of monitoring the effectiveness of
the health-care system (Quaresma et al, 2015). Breast (women
only), bowel, and lung cancer survival indices were calculated using

 the same approach. These types of cancer were selected because
they are associated with the highest incidence and the highest
mortality in Europe (Ferlay et al, 2013).
The total number of cancer patients used to construct the
survival index and site-specific indices was 133 413, the number or
residents in PCTs included in our analysis who were diagnosed
with cancer in 2010. Out of this number, 13 475 (10%) were female
breast cancer patients, 21 902 (16%) were bowel cancer patients,
21 510 (n ¼ 16%) were lung cancer patients, and 76 526 (57%) were
patients diagnosed with other types of cancer. The cancer survival
indices at PCT level were linked to the cancer awareness and
barriers measures by the corresponding PCT.
Statistical analysis. The awareness and barriers scores were
analysed as continuous variables, and their association with the
cancer survival index was assessed using scatter plots and linear
regression (at Po0.05 level). The survival index was the dependent
variable. Scatter plots were also used to visually assess the
association between breast, bowel, and lung cancer survival, and
their cancer-specific symptoms, including ‘unexplained lump or
swelling’, ‘persistent cough or hoarseness’, and ‘change in bowel
or bladder habits’, respectively. Associations between cancer
survival indices and individual cancer symptoms and individual
barriers were also assessed using linear regression. In regression
models, each PCT was weighted using the inverse variance of the
cancer survival estimate. We defined different levels of the barriers
score based on the interquartile range (IQR). We considered
barriers below 25th percentile as ‘low’, between 25th and 75th
percentile as ‘intermediate’ barriers, and above 75th percentile as
‘high’ barriers. The same procedure was used for the awareness
score. Maps were also developed using 25th and 75th percentiles to
determine the cutoff points for low, intermediate, and high scores.
We calculated the statistical power to detect the effects in our
regression analysis using a post hoc power calculator (http://
clincalc.com/Stats/Power.aspx), and reliability of cancer awareness
and barriers scores between PCTs using one-way ANOVA. We
analysed data using Stata 14.0 (2015; Stata 14.0 Statistical Software,
College Station, TX, USA) and ArcGIS for Desktop Advanced 10.3
software (Environmental Systems Research Institute, 2014).
RESULTS
Our data set included 52 PCTs spread across England (Table 1).
The mean cancer symptom awareness score was 7.2 (range: 4.8–
8.3, IQR: 6.9–7.6). The mean barriers to help-seeking score was 1.7
(range: 0.6–3.1, IQR: 1.4–1.8). The 1-year cancer survival index
had a mean value of 66.9 (range: 60.5–71.7).
Geographical variation in cancer awareness and barriers to help
seeking in England. The lowest cancer awareness scores were
observed in Tower Hamlets (4.8), Newham (5.5), Redbridge (6.4),
Gloucestershire (6.5), and Lambeth (6.5). The highest awareness
scores were observed in Peterborough (8.3), Bedfordshire (8.1),
Great Yarmouth and Waveney (8.1), and Cambridgeshire (8.0)
(Figure 1).
In England, different PCTs were ranked according to their
socioeconomic deprivation based on the income domain of the
English indices of Deprivation (Department for Communities and
Local Government, 2011). The PCTs ranked as some of the most
socioeconomically deprived were: Newham and Tower Hamlets in
East London, Bradford and Airedale and Kirklees in Yorkshire,
Lambeth and City and Hackney in London, and Hampshire in
Southern coast of England. The PCTs ranked as some of the least
socioeconomically deprived were: Herefordshire in West Midlands,
Bedfordshire in the East of England, Richmond and Twickenham
in London, and Great Yarmouth and Waveney in the East of
England.
The highest barriers scores were observed in Tower Hamlets
(3.1), Kirklees (3.1), Bradford and Airedale (3.0), and Newham
(2.7). The lowest barriers scores were observed in North Tyneside
(0.6), Northamptonshire (0.8), Newcastle (0.9), and Herefordshire
(1.1) (Figure 2).
Cancer awareness and barriers scores in relation to cancer
survival. There were large differences between survival from
different types of cancer: breast cancer survival ranged from 93% to
99%, bowel cancer survival ranged from 67% to 81%, and lung
cancer survival ranged from 18% to 42%.
Scatter plots showed the position of each PCT with regard to
their cancer survival and cancer awareness score or recognition of
cancer-specific symptoms (Figure 3); and cancer survival and
barriers score (Figure 4). There was a considerable variation in
assessed variables across PCT areas. We observed a trend with the
best scores in PCTs such as Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire, and
the worst scores in Tower Hamlets and Newham PCTs. The
outliers in most scatter plots were Tower Hamlets and Newham
PCTs, but even after excluding these outliers, similar trends
remained in the scatter plots.
The association between the cancer awareness score and the
cancer survival index was statistically significant (estimated
slope ¼ 1.56, 95% CI: 0.56; 2.57, P ¼ 0.01) (Table 2). Each
additional symptom recognised was associated with a 1.56%
increase in the cancer survival index. Recognition of seven out of
nine individual symptoms was statistically significantly associated
with a slight increase in cancer survival index (Table 2). For
example, for every 1% increase in the recognition of unexplained
lump or swallowing among people living in these PCTs, there was a
0.15 increase in cancer survival index. For every 1% increase in the
recognition of unexplained weight loss among people living in
these PCTs, there was a 0.13 increase in cancer survival index
(Table 2). We found no trends (Figure 3) or statistically significant
associations (Table 2) between survival from breast, lung, or bowel
cancer, and the awareness score or recognition of each cancer
symptom.
The barriers score was not associated with the cancer survival
index (estimated slope ¼ � 0.14, 95% CI: � 1.28; 0.99, P ¼ 0.80),
but it was associated with breast cancer survival: each additional
barrier reported was associated with 0.66% decrease in the breast
cancer survival (estimated slope ¼ � 0.66, 95% CI: � 1.20; � 0.11,
P ¼ 0.02) (Table 2). Most individual barriers had an inverse
association with breast cancer survival. We found no statistically
significant associations between the barriers score or individual
barriers and lung and bowel cancer survival. Similar statistically
significant associations were obtained after we excluded from
regression models the two outliers, Tower Hamlets and Newham
PCTs (data available on request).
DISCUSSION
We found geographical variation in cancer symptom awareness
and barriers to help seeking across England, with the lowest scores
observed in socioeconomically deprived parts of East London. Low
cancer symptom awareness was associated with poor cancer
survival index for all cancers combined, and high barriers to
seeking medical help were associated with poor survival from
breast cancer at PCT level in England.
Strengths and limitations. This is the first study to examine
geographical variation in cancer awareness and barriers to help
seeking in England and to link these with cancer survival data. All
measures, predictors, and outcomes were standardised using the
same age- and sex-standardised weights. This means that the
cancer awareness and barriers score in each PCT were weighted
differently depending on the age and sex structure of the survey

 population in each PCT. The cancer survival indices were
standardised by age, sex, and type of cancer in each PCT to adjust
for changes over time in the distribution of cancer patients in these
categories. This approach was necessary because cancer survival
varies widely depending on these factors (Quaresma et al, 2012).
Therefore, the cancer survival indices were not affected by changes
over time in the proportion of cancers of different lethality by sex,
such as an increase in breast cancer and a reduction of lung cancer
incidence. In addition, the survival indices were not affected by
different age distributions of the cancer patient population or a
shift in the proportion of men and women diagnosed with a given
type of cancer (Quaresma et al, 2012; Office for National Statistics,
2012c). We analysed only PCTs with 90 þ participants and
available data in all sex and age groups to allow reliable calculations
of the scores. A validated measure of public cancer awareness
(Stubbings et al, 2009) was used to interview participants included
in a large population-based sample.
The matching of surveys with survival data of patients
diagnosed in 2010 when most of the surveys were carried out
reduced a possible bias that would happen if patients had more
opportunities to improve their cancer awareness than survey
participants. For example, several regional campaigns were run in
England during 2011, and the first large national campaigns,
aimed at improving awareness about lung and bowel cancer
symptoms, were introduced in 2012 (Ironmonger et al, 2014).
To the best of our knowledge there were no large-scale awareness
raising campaigns in England before 2010. In fact, most of the
CAM
questionnaires
were
used
by
cancer
networks
as
a
preliminary assessment before launching various cancer awareness
campaigns. We used a 1-year cancer survival that is the most
commonly used proxy measure for late presentation (Møller et al,
2011). This is because most excess deaths in the English patients
diagnosed with breast (Møller et al, 2010), lung (Cheyne et al,
2013), and bowel cancer (Møller et al, 2012) occur in the first year
after diagnosis. Our study provides some support to the NAEDI
hypothesis that proposed that the main reasons behind late
diagnosis, associated with poor survival, are low cancer awareness
and increased barriers to help seeking (Richards, 2009; Hiom,
2015).
As with any ecological study, our study may be subject to what
has been called the ecological fallacy that can occur if we assume
that inferences based on group-level analyses are applicable at the
individual level (Piantadosi et al, 1988). For example, it would be
incorrect to assume that by simply increasing awareness about an
additional cancer symptom would mean that a person can expect
an increase in cancer survival by 1.65 percentage point (if and
when
cancer
is
diagnosed).
If
a
woman
no
longer
feels
embarrassment in relation to changes in her breasts following a
campaign, it does not mean that her expected survival from breast
cancer will be automatically increased by 0.6 percentage points. In
addition, the possibility that these associations may be stronger or
weaker at the level of individual cancer patients cannot be
excluded. Although our findings are not directly applicable to
individual people, they outlined an overall pattern of low cancer
survival in small geographical areas with low cancer symptom
awareness. As such, our findings can be used as a starting point in
investigations of the complex relationship between symptom
awareness, barriers to help seeking, and cancer survival. This is
essential before embarking on a large and complex investigation
based on individual-level data. Marmot (1998) argues that
ecological analyses are a useful way to explore the relationship
between social environment and health, particularly as effective
policies are delivered at a community-wide level rather than
individual level.
Our results might not be generalised nationally, because we
included only a third of all PCTs. However, we included a wide
range of environmentally and socioeconomically diverse PCTs
across the country. We have not adjusted our analyses for
socioeconomic deprivation or ethnicity for a number of reasons.
First, at the time when we conducted the analysis, survival data of
different ethnic groups by PCT were not available to us. Therefore,
it was not possible to include this factor in our analysis. Second,
our units of analysis were PCTs, and there was a wide variation of
socioeconomic deprivation within each PCT. Calculating a single
deprivation score for each PCT may not be valid. This is because
on average there are B100 000 people living in each PCT, and
some PCTs had over 250000 residents such as Brighton and Hove
(Bojke et al, 2001). Adjusting the PCTs for their average socio-
economic status may not accurately capture material or social
resources, especially among culturally and ethnically diverse groups.
Most large cities in England, such as London, Manchester, or
Lancaster, have some poor people living in affluent areas, and vice
versa, with contrasting housing types in the same neighbourhood,
ranging from Victorian semi-detached houses and maisonettes to less
popular council flats and ‘towers’ (Cattell, 2001; Popay et al, 2003).
Therefore, adjusting each geographical area for its average level of
socioeconomic deprivation is not warranted, especially if there are
large gaps between the affluent and poor residents in that area.
Third, our surveys had a substantial proportion of participants
with missing data on socioeconomic deprivation. If we had decided to
use data on socioeconomic deprivation to calculate the cancer
awareness and barriers scores, the number of units in our analysis
would be reduced to 22 only. This is because we would have to
remove 30 PCTs, because they did not have participants in all five
categories of socioeconomic deprivation. However, we used popula-
tion life tables that may in part overcome the fact that socioeconomic
deprivation was not accounted for. These life tables took into account
different mortality rates of a different population groups living in
these PCT during the years 2010 and 2011 and, for example,
controlled for the fact that the elderly men, with low socioeconomic
position, have high mortality rates. In addition, the use of age- and
sex-standardised weights also accounted for some of the differences in
sociodemographic distribution of people living in these PCTs.
With statistical power of 80% we were able to detect regression
coefficients over 1.44 for cancer awareness and over 0.36 for
barriers score in relation to the overall cancer survival index. For
breast cancer survival, with statistical power of 80% we were able to
detect regression coefficients over 0.79 for cancer awareness and over
0.17 for barriers score. For lung cancer survival, with statistical power
of 80% we were able to detect regression coefficients over 2.76 for
cancer awareness and over 0.62 for barriers score. For bowel cancer
survival, with statistical power of 80% we were able to detect
regression coefficients over 2.08 for cancer awareness and over 0.50
for barriers score. It is possible that some of our results were not
statistically significant because of lack of power, rather than no
association. However, it is worth noting that the weighting in the
regression model to some extent mitigates the lack of power.
It is important to note that the scores were standardised by age
group and sex that would reduce the within-PCT variability. The
reliability of the group-level barriers scores was at B0.80 for each
age and sex combination, with the exception of the 75 þ age group
(0.23 in men and 0.50 in women). For awareness scores, their
reliability was above 0.80 for each age and sex combination, with
the exception of elderly men (0.55) and elderly women (0.53). The
relatively low reliability among elderly is related to the small
number of participants in the 75þ age group. This suggests an
overall reliability of the PCT-level scores standardised on age and sex.
Comparison with existing literature. Cancer symptom awareness
and barriers to help seeking varied greatly between geographical
areas in England, but we did not observe a north–south divide in
these scores. The worst scores were observed in socioeconomically
deprived parts of East London, such as Tower Hamlets and
Newham. There is ample evidence that socioeconomically deprived

 people in England tend to have low cancer symptom awareness
and numerous reasons to deter them from seeking medical help,
including embarrassment or difficulties in arranging transport to
the doctor’s surgery (Robb et al, 2009; Waller et al, 2009; Niksic
et al, 2015). A recent Danish study corroborated the findings that
socioeconomic deprivation is strongly associated with increased
barriers to help seeking (Hvidberg et al, 2014). Underprivileged
people are also more likely to pursue an unhealthy lifestyle,
including smoking and low physical activity (Marmot et al, 1991),
that act to ‘normalise’ early symptoms of disease (Dixon-Woods
et al, 2006). They may also feel embarrassed to discuss their
symptoms with their doctor because of perceived social distance
and status differences.
Another possible explanation for our findings is the role of
ethnic minority background, one of the factors contributing to
poor recognition of symptoms and increased barriers to help
seeking (Forbes et al, 2011; Niksic et al, 2016). A recent study
found that ethnic minorities in England had lower cancer
symptom awareness and more widespread barriers to seeking
medical help than White participants (Niksic et al, 2016). Another
study carried out in East London also reported that South Asian
and Black women had significantly lower breast cancer awareness
than White women (Forbes et al, 2011). Emotional barriers to
seeking medical help, such as embarrassment and lack of
confidence to talk to the doctor, were highest among South Asian
women. These differences could not be explained by different
levels of educational attainment or socioeconomic deprivation.
Socioeconomically deprived areas often have higher proportion of
ethnic minorities, and these two factors in combination may have
an amplified effect on cancer awareness and barriers to help
seeking.
Low cancer awareness was associated with low cancer survival at
PCT level, with the worst results observed in Tower Hamlets and
Newham. These boroughs of Inner North-East London, together
with Hackney, have been described as ‘the unhealthiest place in
Britain’, with high levels of unemployment, large ethnic diversity,
low levels of social cohesion, and the largest population growth in
the country (East London NHS Trust, 2013). People living in the

 same PCT area are likely to share aspects of their social and
lifestyle patterns, and access to educational and health-care
facilities, making their health outcomes more similar than those
of people from different PCTs (Nur et al, 2015). A term ‘place
effect’ was coined to describe the extent of area effects on
individuals’ health (Macintyre et al, 2002). If symptom awareness
and cancer survival are to be improved, then it can be argued that
place effects need to be taken into account. Campaigns may be more
effective if they are culturally sensitive and socially inclusive, with a
clear and simple message, translated into languages frequently spoken
in the community, and if health-care provision, in terms of both units
and personnel, is increased in areas with rapidly growing population.
Socioeconomically deprived areas that have poor cancer survival
(Coleman et al, 2004; Rachet et al, 2010) could benefit most from
awareness rising campaigns. A recent NHS Health and Wellbeing
Strategy is an example of the area-specific approach to improve health
outcomes that includes reducing the risks of developing cancer (East
London NHS Trust, 2013).
We found no strong evidence that recognition of the cancer-
specific
symptoms
were
associated
with
survival
from
the
corresponding cancers. People may perceive these symptoms, such
as ‘persistent cough’, as temporary and attribute them to non-
cancer causes like smoking, having a cold, or an allergy. As an
alternative explanation, the role of ‘symptom clusters’ has also been
implicated. Early symptoms of breast, bowel, or lung cancer often
occur in clusters rather than in isolation. A symptom cluster is a
relatively stable group of two or more related symptoms, occurring
simultaneously and independently from other symptom clusters
(Kim et al, 2005). For example, the cluster of lung cancer
symptoms may include thoracic pain, cough, hemoptysis, and
vomiting (Hamilton et al, 2005a). The cluster of bowel cancer
symptoms may include rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhoea,
and weight loss (Hamilton et al, 2005b). The cluster of breast
cancer symptoms may include a lump, fatigue, pain, and insomnia
(Gaston–Johansson et al, 1999; Banning, 2007). Recognition of a
single, cancer-specific symptom may not be sufficient to produce
an effect on survival from that cancer. Experiencing a few
unexplained symptoms simultaneously, as a cluster, is perhaps
more likely to have an effect on cancer survival because it may
prompt people to seek medical help.

 The barriers score was not associated with the cancer survival
index, but it was associated with breast cancer survival. This could
be because breast cancer survival was assessed for women only, and
there is evidence that women are more likely to report barriers to
help seeking than men (Niksic et al, 2015). Women may perceive
numerous reasons to deter them from seeking medical help,
imposed by sociocultural norms. Female breasts have a social
symbolism, linked with their maternal and sexual function.
Therefore, breast cancer may be perceived as a violation of
femininity, and a source of shame and stigma (Wong and King,
2008). Niksic et al (2015) found that women have B20% higher
odds than men to report that they would be put off consulting a
doctor because of embarrassment, worry about wasting the
doctor’s time, and perceived difficulty in talking to the doctor.

 These barriers were found to have a strong negative association
with breast cancer survival.
We also need to acknowledge that the regression coefficients were
statistically significant for most cancer symptoms in relation to the
cancer survival index, but not for site-specific indices. This may be
because of several reasons. First, an attenuation effect because of lower
reliability, noting that many of the bowel cancer coefficients are
approximately two-thirds the size of the overall coefficients. Second,
good matching between the survival index, which included different
types of cancer, and awareness score, which included different types of
cancer symptoms. For example, it would be surprising if we observed
that ‘difficulty in swallowing’ was associated with breast cancer
survival. However, statistically significant association of this symptom
with the cancer survival index is not surprising because survival from
oesophageal cancer is included in this index. Third, survival from site-
specific cancers was not associated with awareness score, as expected,
given that this score included a range of different symptoms that were
not necessarily relevant for individual cancer sites. Fourth, breast, lung,
and bowel cancer survival indices may have lower statistical power to
detect effects of cancer symptom awareness and barriers on survival.
Furthermore, the coefficients for the barriers score for overall
cancer survival index were close to zero, with the coefficients for
breast cancer survival generally negative (Po0.05), and for lung
and bowel cancer generally positive (although not statistically
significant). Therefore, it is possible that there was some cancelling
out effect in that the barriers that were harmful for breast cancer
survival may well have been protective for the other two cancers.
Finally, the combination of positive and negative coefficients between
overall cancer survival index and different barriers to help seeking
suggests that the use of the aggregate barriers score may not be
warranted. Some barriers may be associated with prompt help seeking,
whereas other barriers may prolong interval to the first medical
consultation. If this is true, different barriers to help seeking need to be
analysed separately in order to understand the mechanism behind them
and their relationship with cancer survival.
Further studies are required to confirm or refute these findings.
More specifically, future studies should assess whether the observed
associations exist at the individual level, and explore the reasons
driving these results, such as educational attainment, ethnicity,
number of doctors per PCT, or access to health-care services.
Researchers
should
also
focus
on
exploring
whether
gender
differences in cancer awareness and barriers to help seeking could
account for some of the differences in survival from the most
common types of cancer. It is necessary to understand the role of
different barriers to help seeking in cancer survival, and which
mechanisms drive these differences. Understanding whether experi-
encing a cluster of cancer symptoms prompts or hinders help seeking
and whether it is associated with cancer survival would be useful.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Our study suggests that higher cancer symptom awareness is
associated with better cancer survival that may inform future
health campaigns and policy decision makers. We highlighted
areas for improvement, and the relative position of each of
the 52 PCTs with regard to cancer awareness, barriers to help
seeking, and cancer survival. Future campaigns should help
people to recognise early symptoms of different types of cancer
and encourage preventive health behaviour, especially in socio-
economically deprived areas. Efforts should be made to alleviate

Abbreviations: GP ¼ general practitioner/doctor; PCT ¼ primary care trust. Weights for all cancer survival estimates were used in models where all cancers survival index was an outcome, and
cancer-specific weights were used in models where outcomes were breast, lung, and bowel cancer, respectively. All awareness and barriers scores (and individual symptoms/barriers) were
standardised for age and sex in each PCT. Estimates in bold were statistically significant at Po0.05 level (95% confidence interval).
