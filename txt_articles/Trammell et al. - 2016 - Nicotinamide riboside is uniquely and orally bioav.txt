Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is in wide use as an NAD þ precursor vitamin. Here we determine
the time and dose-dependent effects of NR on blood NAD þ metabolism in humans. We
report that human blood NAD þ can rise as much as 2.7-fold with a single oral dose of NR in
a pilot study of one individual, and that oral NR elevates mouse hepatic NAD þ with distinct
and superior pharmacokinetics to those of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. We further show
that single doses of 100, 300 and 1,000 mg of NR produce dose-dependent increases in the
blood NAD þ metabolome in the first clinical trial of NR pharmacokinetics in humans. We
also report that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), which was not thought to be en
route for the conversion of NR to NAD þ, is formed from NR and discover that the rise in
NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of effective NAD þ repletion.

 N
icotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD þ), the central
redox coenzyme in cellular metabolism1,2 functions as a
hydride
group
acceptor,
forming
NADH
with
concomitant
oxidation
of
metabolites
derived
from
carbohydrates, amino acids and fats. The NAD þ/NADH ratio
controls the degree to which such reactions proceed in oxidative
versus reductive directions. Whereas fuel oxidation reactions
require NAD þ as a hydride acceptor, gluconeogenesis, oxidative
phosphorylation, ketogenesis, detoxification of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and lipogenesis require reduced co-factors, NADH
and NADPH, as hydride donors (Fig. 1). In addition to its role as
a coenzyme, NAD þ is the consumed substrate of enzymes such
as poly-ADPribose polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins and cyclic
ADPribose synthetases1. In redox reactions, the biosynthetic
structures of NAD þ, NADH, NADP þ
and NADPH are
preserved. In contrast, PARP3, sirtuin4 and cyclic ADPribose
synthetase5
activities
hydrolyze
the
linkage
between
the
nicotinamide (Nam) and the ADPribosyl moieties of NAD þ to
signal DNA damage, alter gene expression, control post-
translational modifications and regulate calcium signalling.
In animals, NAD þ-consuming activities and cell division
necessitate ongoing NAD þ synthesis, either through a de novo
pathway that originates with tryptophan or via salvage pathways
from three NAD þ precursor vitamins, Nam, nicotinic acid (NA)
and nicotinamide riboside (NR)2. Dietary NAD þ precursors,
which include tryptophan and the three vitamins, prevent
pellagra.
Though
NR
is
present
in
milk6,7,
the
cellular
concentrations of NAD þ, NADH, NADP þ and NADPH are
much higher than those of other NAD þ metabolites8,9, such that
dietary NAD þ precursor vitamins are largely derived from
enzymatic breakdown of NAD þ. Thus, although milk is a source
of NR6,7, the more abundant sources of NR, Nam and NA are
unprocessed foods, in which plant and animal cellular NAD þ
metabolites are broken down to these compounds. Human
digestion and the microbiome10 play roles in the provision of
these vitamins in ways that are not fully characterized. In
addition, the conventional NAD þ precursor vitamins, NA and
Nam, have long been supplemented into human and animal diets
to prevent pellagra and promote growth11,12. Though NR has
been available as a GMP-produced supplement since 2013 and
animal safety assessment indicates that it is as nontoxic as Nam13,
no human testing has been reported.
Different tissues maintain NAD þ levels through reliance on
different biosynthetic routes and precursors14,15 (Fig. 1). Because
NAD þ-consuming activities frequently occur as a function of
cellular stresses3 and produce Nam, the ability of a cell to salvage
Nam
into
productive
NAD þ
synthesis
through
Nam
phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) activity versus methylation
of
Nam to
N-methylnicotinamide
(MeNam)
regulates
the
efficiency
of
NAD þ-dependent
processes16.
NAD þ
biosynthetic genes are also under circadian control17,18. Both
NAMPT expression and NAD þ levels decline in a number of
tissues as a function of aging and overnutrition19–22.
High-dose NA but not high-dose Nam is prescribed to treat
and prevent dyslipidemias, although its use is limited by painful
flushing23,24. Whereas it takes only B15 mg per day of NA or
Nam to prevent pellagra, pharmacological doses of NA can be as
high as 2–4 g. Despite the 4100-fold difference in effective dose
between pellagra prevention and dyslipidemia treatment, we
proposed that the beneficial effects of NA on plasma lipids might
simply depend on function of NA as an NAD þ boosting
compound1. According to this view, sirtuin activation would
likely be part of the mechanism because Nam is an NAD þ
precursor in most cells14,15 but inhibits sirtuins at high doses25.
On the basis of the ability of NR to elevate NAD þ synthesis,
increase sirtuin activity and extend lifespan in yeast6,26, NR has
been employed in mice to elevate NAD þ metabolism and
improve health in models of metabolic stress. Notably, NR allows
mice to resist weight gain on high-fat diet27, prevent noise-
induced hearing loss28 and maintain the regenerative potential of
stem cells in aging mice, providing a longevity advantage29. In
addition, the hepatic NAD þ metabolome has been interrogated
as a function of prediabetic and type 2 diabetic mouse models.
The data indicate that levels of liver NADP þ and NADPH,
which are required for resistance to ROS, are severely challenged
by diet-induced obesity, and that diabetes and the NAD þ
metabolome
can
be
partially
controlled
while
diabetic
neuropathy can be blocked by oral NR30.
Data indicate that NR is a mitochondrially favoured NAD þ
precursor31 and in vivo activities of NR have been interpreted as
depending on mitochondrial sirtuin activities27,28, though not to
the
exclusion
of
nucleocytosolic
targets32,33.
Similarly,
nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the phosphorylated form
of NR, has been used to treat declining NAD þ in mouse models
of overnutrition and aging19,20. Beneficial effects of NMN have
been shown to depend on SIRT120. However, because of the
abundance of NAD þ-dependent processes, the effects of NR and
NMN may depend on multiple targets including sirtuins, PARP
family members, cADPribose synthetases, NAD þ-dependent
oxidoreductases and NADPH-dependent ROS detoxification
enzymes30.
To translate NR technologies to people, it is necessary to
determine NR oral availability and utilization in different tissues.
Here we began with targeted quantitative NAD þ metabolomics
of blood and urine in a pilot experiment in which a healthy 52-
year-old man took 1,000 mg of NR daily for 7 days. These data
indicate that blood cellular NAD þ rose 2.7-fold after one dose of
NR and that NA adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) unexpectedly
increased 45-fold. We then performed a detailed analysis of 128
mice comparing oral NR, Nam and NA in a manner that
eliminated the possibility of circadian artefacts. These data
indicate that NR boosts hepatic NAD þ and NAD þ- consuming
activities to a greater degree than Nam or NA. Further
experiments clarified that NR is a direct precursor of NAAD
and that NAAD sensitively reports on increased
NAD þ
metabolism in mouse liver and heart. Finally, we performed a
clinical study with 12 healthy human subjects at three single doses
of NR. We demonstrated that NR supplementation safely
increases NAD þ metabolism at all doses and validated elevated
NAAD as an unexpected, sensitive biomarker of boosting
NAD þ. The unique oral bioavailability of NR in mice and
people and methods established herein enable clinical translation
of NR to improve wellness and treat human diseases.
Results
Oral NR increases human blood NADþ with elevation of NAAD.
GMP-synthesized NR showed no activity as a mutagen or toxin13.
Despite use as an over-the-counter supplement, no data addressing
human
availability
were
available.
A
healthy
52-year-old
male (65 kg) contributed blood and urine before seven days of
orally self-administered NR (1,000mg per morning). Blood was
taken an additional nine times during the first day and at 24h after
the first and last dose. Blood was separated into peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma before quantitative NADþ
metabolomics by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry
(MS)9, which was expanded to quantify methylated and oxidized
metabolites of Nam30. As shown in Supplementary Table 1 and
Fig. 2, the PBMC NAD þ metabolome was unaffected by NR for
the first 2.7 h. In six measurements from time zero through 2.7 h,
NAD þ had a mean concentration of 18.5 mM; while Nam had a
mean concentration of 4.1 mM and the methylated and oxidized

 Nam metabolite, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (Me2PY),
had a mean concentration of 2.6 mM. However, at 4.1 h post
ingestion, PBMC NADþ and Me2PY increased by factors of 2.3
and 4.2, respectively.
In yeast, deletion of NR kinase 1 (NRK1) does not eliminate
utilization
of
NR26.

salvage26,34. However, as shown in Fig. 2, Nam concentration
in the human subject’s PBMCs merely fluctuated in a range of 2.6
to 7.1 mM throughout all 11 observations. The 4.2-fold increase in
Me2PY concentration at the 4.1 h time point suggests that
increased cellular NAD þ
accumulation is accompanied by
increased
NAD þ-consuming
activities
linked
to
increased
methylation and oxidation of the Nam product.
In the subject’s PBMCs at 7.7 and 8.1 h post ingestion, NAD þ
and Me2PY peaked, increasing above baseline concentrations by
2.7-fold and 8.4-fold, respectively. At these times, unexpectedly,
NAAD,
the
substrate
of
glutamine-dependent
NAD þ
synthetase35,36, which is only expected to be produced in
biosynthesis of NAD þ from tryptophan and NA2, was elevated
from less than 20 nM to as high as 0.91 mM. Whereas NAAD
lagged the rise in PBMC NAD þ by one time point, the relative
rise in PBMC NAD þ was not as pronounced as the spike in
NAAD, which was at least 45-fold above the baseline level.
Although contrary to expectations, these data suggested that NR
might be incorporated into NAAD after formation of NAD þ and
chased back to the NAD þ peak as NAD þ declines.
Complete NAD þ metabolomic data from the human subject’s
PBMCs, plasma and urine are provided in Figs 2–4 and
Supplementary Tables 1–3. These data show that all of the
phosphorylated compounds—NAMN, NAAD, NAD þ, NADP þ,
NMN and ADPR—are found exclusively in blood cells and are
not found in plasma or urine. Notably, the peak of NADP þ,
which represents cellular NADP þ plus NADPH oxidized in
extraction, and the peak of ADPR, which signals an increase in
NAD þ-consuming activities, co-occur with peak NAD þ. Using
methods optimized for recovery of nucleotides, NR was not

Figure 1 | The NAD þ metabolome. NAD þ is synthesized by salvage of the vitamin precursors, NA, Nam and NR, or from tryptophan in the de novo
pathway. NAD þ can be reduced to NADH, phosphorylated to NADP þ or consumed to Nam. Nam can also be methylated and oxidized to waste products.

 recovered. As shown in Figs 3 and 4, the major time-dependent
waste metabolite in plasma and urine was Me2PY, which rose
B10-fold from pre-dose to time points after NAD þ peaked in
PBMCs.
NR is the superior hepatic NAD þ precursor vitamin. On the
basis of known NAD þ biosynthetic pathways31, it was difficult to
understand how levels of NAAD rose in human PBMCs after an
oral dose of NR. Though NR did not elevate Nam in blood
samples at any time during the n ¼ 1 experiment, it remained
possible that NR was partially converted to Nam before salvage
synthesis to NAD þ. Such conversion to Nam might allow
bacterial hydrolysis of Nam to NA by pncA gene products—
potentially in the gut10—and subsequent conversion to NAD þ
through an NAAD intermediate. NAAD was reported in mouse
liver when 500 mg kg � 1 of radioactive Nam was injected
intraperitoneally (IP) into the body cavity of mice37. However,
NAAD was observed in kidneys, ovaries, lung, heart and brain in
addition to liver in mice IP-injected with 500 mg kg � 1 of NA but
not Nam38. Moreover, careful analysis of mouse liver perfused
with radioactive NA and Nam indicated that NAAD is produced
from NA but not Nam at physiological concentrations39. To our
knowledge, formation of blood or tissue NAAD from oral
administration of Nam or NR has never been observed.
Although some mouse experiments have been done with IP
administered NR at dosages of 1,000 mg kg � 1 twice per day28,
NR is active as an oral agent at a daily dose of 400 mg kg � 1 by
supplementation into food27,29,30 and demonstrated potent
NAD þ boosting activity in the n ¼ 1 human experiment at
15 mg kg � 1 (Fig. 2). On the basis of weight/surface area, the
conversion between human adult dose and mouse dose is a factor
of 12.3 (ref. 40), suggesting that mice should be administered
185 mg kg � 1 to achieve comparable levels of supplementation
with the human pilot experiment. We therefore designed a
reverse translational experiment in which mice were administered
185 mg kg � 1 of NR or the mole equivalent doses of Nam and NA
by oral gavage. To ascertain the timecourse by which these
vitamins boost the hepatic NAD þ metabolome without the
complication of circadian oscillation of NAD þ metabolism17,18,
we euthanized all mice at B2 pm. Thus, gavage was performed at
0.25, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h before tissue harvest. To stop
metabolism synchronously, mouse livers were harvested by
freeze-clamping. As shown in Fig. 5, we additionally performed
saline gavages at all time points and euthanized mice for
quantitative NAD þ metabolomic analysis to ensure that animal
handling does not alter levels of NAD þ metabolites. The flat
timecourses
of
saline
gavages

soundness.

metabolites
(pmol mg � 1) at 2 pm were 1,000±35 for NAD þ, 230±29 for
Nam, 210±20 for NADP þ, 66±13 for ADPR and o15 for all
other NAD þ metabolites. Hepatic levels of NA, NAR, NAMN,
NAAD have baselines of o4. As a point of orientation to
quantitative metabolomics in tissue samples, 1,000 pmol mg � 1 is
B1 mM, 200 is B200 mM and 10 is B10 mM.

week. PBMCs were prepared from blood collected before the first dose (0 h), at seven time points after the first dose (0.6, 1, 1.4, 2.7, 4.1, 7.7 and 8.1 h),

g, Me4PY; h, NAAD; i, ADPR) are with respect to whole blood volumes. The data indicate that the NAD þ metabolome—with the exception of Nam and
NAAD—is elevated by the 4.1 time point post ingestion. Whereas PBMC Nam was never elevated by NR, NAAD was elevated by the next time point.
NAD þ and NAAD remained elevated 24 h after the last dose.

 increases in ADPR, Nam, MeNam, Me2PY and N-methyl-4-
pyridone-5-carboxamide (Me4PY) on a common absolute scale
with NAD þ permits assessment of increased NAD þ-consuming
activities
associated
with
NAD þ
precursor
vitamin
supplementation.
Hepatic
concentrations
of
13
NAD þ
metabolites
were
quantified in three to four mice at seven time points after gavage
of saline and each vitamin. In addition, on each experimental day,
three mice were gavaged with saline and euthanized to serve as
time zero samples. Each vitamin produced a temporally distinct
pattern of hepatic NAD þ metabolites. Consistent with rapid
phosphorylation of NR and NAR by NR kinases41, the only
NAD þ metabolites that do not produce hepatic peaks as a
function of gavage of NAD þ precursor vitamins are NR and
NAR (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). The accumulation curves of
some metabolites as a function of each vitamin are strikingly
similar. For example, the accumulation of NMN (Fig. 5a) is nearly
identical to that of NAD þ (Fig. 5b) and NADP þ (Fig. 5c),
though at a scale of B1:400:40, respectively. In addition, the
accumulation of Me4PY (Fig. 5f) is nearly identical to that of
Me2PY (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
As shown in Fig. 5b, NA produced the least increase in hepatic
NAD þ and also was 4–6 h faster than NR and Nam in kinetics of
hepatic NAD þ accumulation. When NA was provided by oral
gavage, liver NA peaked (340±30 pmol mg � 1)
in 15 min
(Fig. 5g). Hepatic NA appearance was followed by an expected
peak of 220±29 NAAD at 1 h post gavage (Fig. 5i) and a rise in
hepatic NAD þ from 990±25 baseline to 2,200±150 at 2 h
(Fig. 5b). Hepatic NADP þ due to NA (Fig. 5c) rose in parallel to
that of hepatic NAD þ. In the hours after gavage of NA, as
hepatic NAD þ and NADP þ fell, there was clear evidence of
enhanced NAD þ-consuming activities with significant rises in
ADPR (Fig. 5j), Nam (Fig. 5d), MeNam (Fig. 5e), Me2PY
(Supplementary Fig. 1c) and Me4PY (Fig. 5f). Thus, oral
administration of NA doubled hepatic NAD þ from B1 to
B2 mM through expected intermediates and produced an
increase in NAD þ
consumption and methylated products,
MeNam, Me2PY and Me4PY. Net conversion by the liver of
NA to Nam has been documented for decades30,37,38. Essentially,
the liver transiently elevates NAD þ biosynthetic capacity so long
as NA is available while increasing NAD þ-consuming activities,
thereby making Nam available to other tissues. Expression of
hepatic NNMT results in net production of MeNam from NAD þ
precursors, which stabilizes SIRT1 protein in liver and is
associated with better lipid parameters in mice and some
human populations42,43.
As
shown
in
Fig.
5g
and
consistent
with
radioactive
experiments39, oral Nam was not used by the liver as NA
because it did not produce a peak of NA at any time after gavage.
Though there was a clear increase in hepatic NAD þ 2 h after
Nam gavage, the Nam gavage drove increased hepatic NAD þ
accumulation from 2 to 8 h with a peak at 8 h (Fig. 5b). Nam
gavage produced two peaks of Nam in the liver (Fig. 5d), the first
at 15 min, consistent with simple transport of Nam to liver. The
second broad peak was coincident with elevation of NAD þ and
NADP þ (Fig. 5c,d) and elevation of the NAD þ-consuming
metabolomic signature of ADPR (Fig. 5j), MeNam, Me4PY and
Me2PY (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Fig. 1c).
Of the metabolites associated with NAD þ-consuming activ-
ities, ADPR is the only one that must be formed from NAD þ
because Nam, MeNam and the oxidized forms of MeNam could
appear in liver from the gavaged Nam without conversion to
NAD þ. Interestingly, of three NAD þ
precursor vitamins
provided in bolus at equivalent oral doses, Nam provided the
least increase in ADPR (Fig. 5j). Whereas the area under the
curve (AUC) of the Nam-driven rise in hepatic NAD þ indicated
a B50% advantage of Nam over NA (Fig. 5b), there was a 450%
deficit in Nam-driven ADPR accumulation versus NA (Fig. 5j).
This is consistent with the idea that high-dose NA, though not an
ideal hepatic NAD þ precursor, is effective as a cholesterol agent
whereas Nam is not44 because high-dose Nam inhibits sirtuins1.
Notably, NR is active as a cholesterol-lowering agent in overfed
mice30.
As shown in Fig. 1, Nam is expected to proceed through NMN
but not NR, NAR, NaMN or NAAD en route to forming NAD þ.
Though there was no elevation of hepatic NR or NAR with oral

 Nam, there was also little elevation of hepatic NMN—this
metabolite never reached a mean value of 5 pmol mg � 1 at any
time after Nam administration (Fig. 5a). Surprisingly, as shown in
Fig. 5i, 2–4 h after oral Nam, NAAD was elevated to nearly 200
from a baseline of o2 pmol mg � 1. Elevated NAAD occurred
during the broad peak of elevated hepatic NAD þ and NADP þ
(Fig. 5b,c). These data suggest that the rise in NAAD is a
biomarker of increased NAD þ synthesis and does not depend on
the conventionally described precursors of NAAD, namely NA
and tryptophan.
As shown in Fig. 5b, NR elevated hepatic NAD þ by more than
fourfold with a peak at 6 h post gavage. NR also produced the
greatest elevation of NMN (Fig. 5a), NADP þ (Fig. 5c), Nam
(Fig. 5d), NAMN (Fig. 5h), NAAD (Fig. 5i) and ADPR (Fig. 5j) in
terms of peak height and AUC. Importantly, although gavage of
Nam produces a peak of Nam in the liver at 15 min, the peak of
Nam from NR gavage corresponds to the peak of NAD þ, NMN,
NADP þ and ADPR. These data establish that oral NR has clearly
different hepatic pharmacokinetics than oral Nam. More NAD þ
and NADP þ were produced from NR than from Nam. In
addition, there was three times as much accumulation of ADPR,
indicating that NR drives greater NAD þ-consuming activities in
liver than mole equivalent doses of Nam and NA. Though it has
been speculated that NR would be a more potent NAD þ and
sirtuin-boosting vitamin than conventional niacins45, these are
the first in vivo data in support of this hypothesis.
As was seen in the n ¼ 1 human blood experiment, at time
points in which the abundant NAD þ metabolites, NAD þ and
NADPþ, were elevated by NR by Btwofold or more, NAAD rose
from undetectable levels to B10% of the level of NAD þ, thereby
becoming a highly sensitive biomarker of increased NAD þ
metabolism. Though compounds such as MeNam, Me2PY and
Me4PY are also correlated with increased NAD þ synthesis, they
are waste products that can be produced without NAD þ synthesis,
whereas NAAD is functional NADþ precursor.
To test whether NAAD is also elevated in other tissues and
through other routes of administration, we euthanized mice after
6 days of NR or saline by IP administration and analysed hepatic
and cardiac NAD þ metabolomes. As shown in Fig. 6, steady-
state levels of hepatic NAD þ and NADP þ are much more
responsive to NR than are steady state levels of cardiac NAD þ
and NADP þ. However, cardiac NAD þ metabolism was clearly
elevated on the basis of statistically significant elevation of NMN,
Nam, MeNam and Me4PY. Among these metabolites, only NMN,
which was elevated in the heart by approximately twofold, could
be considered diagnostic for increased NAD þ
formation.
In addition, NAMN and NAAD were increased by about
B100-fold in heart and liver with NAAD rising to B10% of
the concentration of heart and liver NAD þ in supplemented
animals. These data validate NAAD as a metabolite that
sensitively and reliably marks increased NAD þ metabolism even
in tissues in which steady-state levels of NAD þ are little changed.
NR is incorporated into NAAD. Appearance of hepatic NAAD
after gavage of Nam or NR, and of hepatic NAMN after gavage of
NR suggested that there is an NAD þ and/or NMN deamidating
activity when NAD þ and NADP þ levels are high. Alternatively,
high levels of NAD þ metabolites might inhibit glutamine-
dependent NAD þ synthetase, thereby resulting in accumulation
of NAMN and NAAD derived from tryptophan. To test whether
NR is incorporated into the peak of NAAD that appears after NR
gavage, we synthesized NR with incorporation of deuterium at
the ribosyl C2 and 13C into the carbonyl of the Nam moiety. This
double-labelled NR was provided to 15 mice by oral gavage at an

Figure 4 | Elevation of the urinary NAD þ metabolome by oral NR in a 52-year-old male. A healthy 52-year-old male ingested 1,000 mg NC Cl daily for 1
week. Urine was collected before the first dose, in three collection fractions in the first 12 h and before the second and fifth daily dose. Concentrations
(a, Nam; b, MeNam; c, Me2PY; d, Me4PY) are normalized to urinary creatinine. The data indicate that urinary MeNam, Me4PY and Me2PY are the
dominant metabolites elevated by oral NR. No phosphorylated species were found in urine.

Figure 5 | NR elevates hepatic NAD þ metabolism distinctly with respect to other vitamins. Either saline (orange, n ¼ 3 per time point) or equivalent
moles of NR (black, n ¼ 3 per time point), NA (blue, n ¼ 4 per time point) and Nam (green, n ¼ 4 per time point) were administered to male C57Bl6/J mice
by gavage. To control for circadian effects, gavage was performed at indicated times before a common B2 pm tissue collection. In the left panels, the
hepatic concentrations (pmol per mg of wet tissue weight) of each metabolite (a, NMN; b, NAD þ; c, NADP þ; d, Nam; e, MeNam; f, Me4PY; g, NA; h,
NAMN; i, NAAD; and j, ADPR) are shown as a function of the four gavages. The excursion of each metabolite as a function of saline gavage is shown in
orange; as a function of NR in black; as function of Nam in green; and NA in blue. In the right panels, the baseline-subtracted 12-hour AUCs are shown.

that NR produces greater increases in NAD þ metabolism than Nam or NA with distinctive kinetics, that Nam is disadvantaged in stimulation of

 effective dose of 185 mg kg � 1 with the same experimental design
used in pharmacokinetic analysis of the three vitamins. The effect
of labelled oral NR on the hepatic NAD þ metabolome was first
assessed at 2 h after gavage—a time point before the rise in the
steady-state level of NAD þ (Fig. 5b).
As shown in Fig. 7a,b, at 2 h, 54% of the NAD þ and 32% of
the NADP þ contained at least one heavy atom while 5% of the
NAD þ and 6% of the NADP þ incorporated both heavy atoms.
Because 450% of hepatic NAD þ incorporates label before a rise
in NAD þ accumulation, it is clear that the NAD þ pool is
dynamic. As shown in Fig. 7c,d, the majority of hepatic Nam and
MeNam following gavage of double-labelled NR incorporated a
heavy atom, necessarily the 13C in Nam. Because NR drives
increased NAD þ synthesis and ADPR production (Fig. 5), the
liberated singly labelled Nam becomes incorporated into NMN
and NAD þ in competition with double labelled NR, thereby
limiting subsequent incorporation of both labels into the NAD þ
pool.
Appearance of a peak of NAAD after NR administration could
either be due to inhibition of de novo synthesis of NAD þ or from
a deamidating activity that occurs at high NAD þ. If NAAD is
not derived from ingested NR, then it should not incorporate
heavy atoms. However, if NAAD is derived from ingested NR,
then it should incorporate heavy atoms that reflect the rate at
which the putative deamidating activity occurs with respect to
NAD þ-consuming activities and the degree of heavy atom
incorporation into NAD þ. As shown in Fig. 7e, at the 2 h time
point,
NAAD
contained
roughly
the
same
heavy
atom
composition as NAD þ (Fig. 7a), that is, 45% contained at least
one heavy atom and 8% incorporated both heavy atoms. Thus,
NR is the biosynthetic precursor of NAD þ, NADP þ and
NAAD. The data suggest that the activity that converts NAD þ to
NAAD
occurs
at
high
NAD þ
concentrations
at
a
rate
comparable to the rate of NAD þ turnover to Nam. Given the
lack of formation of NA from either Nam or NR in the mouse
liver (Fig. 5), the only other reasonable possibility is that NMN is
deamidated to NAMN when NAD þ
metabolism increases.
Incorporation of the Nam and ribosyl moieties of NR into
NAAD establishes this metabolite as both a biomarker of
increased NAD þ metabolism and a direct product of NR
utilization.
NR safely increases PBMC NAD þ metabolism and NAAD in
people. The n ¼ 1 human experiment illustrated the potential of
1,000 mg NR to boost human NAD þ metabolism. We therefore
conducted a controlled experiment with 12 consented healthy
men and women to determine the effect of three single doses of
NR on blood and urine NAD þ metabolites with monitoring of
subjects for potential adverse events. Considering that the
recommended daily allowance of vitamin B3 as Nam or NA is
B15 mg per adult, we tested three doses of the higher molecular
weight compound NR Cl (100, 300 and 1,000 mg) that corre-
spond to 2.8, 8.4 and 28 times recommended daily allowance.
Body weights of the subjects varied. However, we had already
observed the timecourse of changes in a human NAD þ

Figure 6 | Rising NAAD is a more sensitive biomarker of elevated tissue NAD þ metabolism than is NAD þ. Male C57Bl6/J mice were intraperitoneally
injected either saline (n ¼ 8) or NR Cl (500 mg kg � 1 body weight) (n ¼ 6) for 6 days. Livers and hearts were freeze-clamped and prepared for metabolomic

Participants were randomized to receive doses of NR in different
sequences with 7-day washout periods between data collection.
Participants and investigators were blinded to doses. Blood and
urine collections were performed over 24 h following each dose.
Participants were asked to self-report perceived discomforts.
At 500 mg of niacin, 33 of 33 participants experienced flushing
compared with one out of 35 participants on placebo46. In this
study, two individuals self-reported flushing at the 300 mg dose
but not at the 100 mg or 1,000 mg dose, and two individuals self-
reported feeling hot at the 1,000 mg dose but not at lower doses.
Over the total of 36 days of observation of study participants,
there were no serious adverse events and no events that were
dose-dependent. To assess whether NR might be associated with
authentic and dose-dependent episodes of flushing, future
experiments will incorporate a validated flushing symptom
questionnaire47.
As shown in Fig. 8 and Supplementary Data Files 1 and 2, the
NAD þ metabolome was quantified in the PBMC and plasma
fractions at pre-dose and at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h after receiving oral
NR. Urinary NAD þ metabolites (Supplementary Data File 3)

As shown in Fig. 5, inbred, chow-fed male mice supplemented
with NAD þ precursor vitamins by gavage and euthanized at
B2 pm produced hepatic NAD þ metabolomic data with little
variation. However, blood samples from people exhibited greater
variation, due to differing baseline levels of metabolites and
variable pharmacokinetics, both of which are likely due to genetic
and nutritional changes between subjects (Fig. 8). In PBMCs,
eight key metabolites were quantified in at least 10 subjects at all
time points at each dose. For each metabolite, we plotted average
concentration as a function of dose and time, calculated whether
NR elevated that metabolite, plotted the averaged peak concen-
tration of the metabolite as a function of dose, and calculated the
dose-dependent AUC of the metabolite attributable to NR
supplementation. Unlike a drug metabolism study in which
metabolites appear only after administration, most NAD þ
metabolites are present before supplementation, such that the
AUC attributable to supplementation is a time-zero baseline-
subtracted AUC. Thus, it is possible to calculate not only
the AUC rise in metabolites but also the per cent increase in

Figure 7 | NR contributes directly to hepatic NAAD. Double-labelled NR was orally administered to mice. At indicated times after gavage, mice (n¼ 3) were
euthanized and livers freeze-clamped for isotopic enrichment analysis. Data are plotted as pmolmg� 1 of wet tissue weight. At the 2h time point, hepatic NADþ
(a) shows 54% incorporation of Mþ 1 and Mþ 2 species, indicating that more than half of the NADþ is turned over before there is a rise in steady-state NADþ.
At 2h, hepatic NADPþ (b) shows 32% incorporation of label(s) from ingested NR. At all time points, half or more of hepatic Nam (c) and MeNam (d) carries an
NR-derived label, indicating that NR has driven rapid NADþ synthesis and consumption. At 2h after gavage, 45% of hepatic NAAD (e) incorporates NR-derived
label(s). At 2h, hepatic NADþ (a), NADPþ (b) and NAAD (e) pools incorporate 5, 6 and 8% of double-labelled NR indicating that NR is a direct precursor of all
three metabolites and excluding the possibility that the NR-driven increase in NAAD is due to inhibition of de novo synthesis.

Figure 8 | Dose-dependent effects of NR on the NAD þ metabolome of human subjects. Time-dependent PBMC NAD þ metabolomes from n ¼ 12
healthy human subjects were quantified after three different oral doses of NR. In each left panel, the blood concentration of a metabolite as a function
of dose and time is displayed (a, NMN; b, NAD þ; c, Nam; d, MeNam; e, Me2PY; f, NAAD). #P valueo0.05; ##P valueo0.01 100 mg versus. 300 mg;
wwP valueo0.01; wwwP valueo0.001 100 versus. 1,000; zP valueo0.05; zzP valueo0.01 300 versus. 1,000. A Dunnett’s test was performed comparing the
average concentration of each metabolite at each time point to the concentration of that metabolite at time zero. Significant elevations of NAD þ, MeNam,
Me2PY and NAAD are indicated. In each middle panel, the averaged maximum metabolite concentration per dose is plotted. In each right panel, the
background-subtracted metabolite AUCs are displayed with a one sample t-test comparing the AUC to background above each bar. In addition, asterisks
indicate dose-dependent increases in metabolite AUC (*P valueo0.05; **P valueo0.01; ***P valueo0.001). The data indicate that all doses of NR elevated
8 h NAAD and 24 h NAD þ, and that additional NAD þ metabolites were elevated dose dependently with statistical significance by multiple comparisons.

 AUC in these metabolites attributable to dose-dependent NR
supplementation.
Collapsing the data into pre-dose versus 24 h levels of each
metabolite at all doses, NR significantly elevated PBMC NAD þ
(Fig. 8b), MeNam (Fig. 8d) and Me2PY (Fig. 8e) and significantly
elevated PBMC NAAD (Fig. 8f) at 8 h. In contrast, NR did not
produce a statistically significant all-dose elevation of NMN
(Fig. 8a) or Nam (Fig. 8c) at any time point.
The averaged peak concentration of MeNam (Fig. 8d), Me2PY
(Fig. 8e) and NAAD (Fig. 8f) increased monotonically with
increased NR doses. Of these metabolites, only NAAD was below
the detection limit in individuals before they took NR, qualifying
this metabolite as a biomarker of supplementation. Nam (Fig. 8c)
exhibited no tendency towards higher cellular concentrations
with higher doses of NR. NMN tended to rise (Fig. 8a) and
NAD þ rose (Fig. 8b) to higher concentrations of B2 and 20 mM,
respectively, in people taking 300 and 1,000 mg doses of NR
versus people taking 100 mg doses. Thus, 100 mg supplementa-
tion produced an average B4±2 mM increase in PBMC NAD þ,
whereas the higher doses produced average B6.5±3.5 mM
increases in PBMC NAD þ. No sex differences were discovered.
As was first seen in the n ¼ 1 human experiment and in mouse
liver experiments, NAAD is the most sensitive biomarker of
effective NAD þ supplementation because it is undetectable in
the blood of people before supplementation. At all doses, the peak
shape of NAAD indicated that NAD þ metabolism is most
greatly boosted at 8 h with significant supplementation at 4 h and
significant supplementation remaining at 24 h. At the 8 h peak,
the average concentration of NAAD was elevated to 0.56±0.26,
0.74±0.27 and 1.24±0.51 mM in PBMCs from volunteers taking
100, 300 and 1,000 mg single doses of NR, respectively.
We plotted pre-dose-subtracted AUCs of each metabolite as a
function of dose of NR. With the exception of Nam, the levels of
which were unaffected by NR, NR produced or tended to produce
dose-dependent elevation of the entire NAD þ metabolome
(Fig. 8). In plasma, levels of meNam, me2PY and me4PY also rose
in a dose-dependent manner and were identified at concentra-
tions similar to those in the PBMC fraction. The methylated and
oxidized Nam derivatives were accompanied by low levels of
NAR, which increased with higher doses of NR. Urinary
metabolites were similar to plasma metabolites.
In Supplementary Table 4, the average 24 h baseline-subtracted
AUC of each metabolite is expressed as a percentage increase in that
metabolite at each dose of NR. Once again, Nam and NMN showed
essentially no increase in blood cell concentrations with respect to
baseline concentrations: averaged AUCs never rose by 50% above
baseline. However, NAD þ, meNam, me2PY and NAAD rose or
tended to rise in dose-dependent manners. The effect size of the rise
in NAAD (B2,900%) was much greater than the effect sizes of the
rise in me2PY (B600%), meNam (B200%) or NAD þ (B90%).
AUC increases of NAAD, me2PY and meNam achieved statistical
significance with respect to lower doses of NR.
Discussion
Despite 475 years of human use of NA and Nam11 and 410
years of preclinical NR research6, there has never been a
quantitative metabolomic or pharmacokinetic comparison of
the three NAD þ precursor vitamins in any system. In terms of
elevation of mouse liver NAD þ, we discovered that NR is more
orally bioavailable than Nam, which is more orally bioavailable
than NA (Fig. 5b). The three precursors also differ in the degree
to which they promote accumulation of ADPR, a measure of
sirtuin and other NAD þ-consuming activities. As shown in
Fig. 5j, the ability of NR to elevate ADPR exceeded that of Nam
by B3-fold. This validates NR as the favoured NAD þ precursor
vitamin for increasing NAD þ and NAD þ-consuming activities
in liver.
NR, Nam and NA each have unique pharmacokinetic profiles
in mouse liver, both in terms of kinetics of NAD þ formation and
the population of NAD þ metabolites as a function of time. As
shown in Fig. 5d, Nam is the only vitamin precursor of NAD þ
that produces elevated hepatic Nam 15 min after oral adminis-
tration and, as shown in Fig. 5g, NA is the only precursor that
produces elevated NA 15 min after oral administration. These
data exclude the possibility that all three vitamins are utilized
through the Preiss-Handler pathway in liver or that oral NR is
used exclusively as Nam. Additionally, we have demonstrated that
utilization of both NR and extracellular NMN are limited by
activity of the NR kinase pathway48.
When PBMCs were analysed from the first person to ingest
NR, NAAD was observed to increase at least 45-fold from a
baseline of less than 20 nM to a peak value of nearly 1 mM. This
occurred concomitant with a rise in NAD þ from B18.5 to
50 mM. NAAD was also observed to be elevated in liver when
mice were orally administered NAD þ precursor vitamins. In
addition, NR led to striking elevation of NAAD in the heart, a
tissue that increases NAD þ metabolism without increasing
steady-state NAD þ.
Surprisingly, NA, the only precursor expected to proceed to
NAD þ through an NAAD intermediate, produced the least
NAAD. Indeed, although Nam and NR never produced peaks of
hepatic NA or NAR, both produced peaks of hepatic NAAD
during the periods in which these compounds elevated hepatic
NAD þ. The temporal basis of the NAAD excursions suggested
that elevating NAD þ (Fig. 5b) not only stimulates accumulation
of NAD þ-consumption products ADPR (Fig. 5j), Nam (Fig. 5d),
MeNam (Fig. 5e) and Me4PY (Fig. 5f), but also stimulates
retrograde production of NAAD (Fig. 5i) and NAMN (Fig. 5h).
According to this view, as the rate of NAD þ synthesis increases,
a previously unknown activity would deamidate NAD þ to
NAAD. Alternatively, similar conditions could result in NMN
deamidation, giving rise to NAMN and NAAD.
In mouse liver, the apparent flux through this pathway is quite
significant: the NR-driven peak of NAAD amounted to 10% of
the NR-attributable peak of NAD þ. Production of high levels of
NAAD from NAD þ could therefore account for the NR-
stimulated peak in NAMN because NAMN adenylytransferase is
a reversible enzyme49. Striking elevation (B100-fold) of NAAD
was also seen in the heart of mice supplemented with NR after 6
days of IP administration (Fig. 6).
The hypothesis that NAAD is formed from NR in vivo was
tested by administering NR labelled in the Nam and ribosyl
moieties. As shown in Fig. 7, NR stimulates appearance of
double-labelled NAAD (8% of total) at the same time in which
5% of NAD þ is double-labelled. The biochemical basis for a
potential NAD þ deamidation reaction is unknown. However,
glutamine-dependent NAD þ synthetase is irreversible35,36. One
intriguing possibility is that NAAD is formed by the long-sought
enzyme that forms intracellular NAADP50. According to this
view, an NADP deamidase may be responsible for formation of
NAADP—this same activity might deamidate NAD þ at high
concentrations forming NAAD. Unlike ADPR and methylated
Nam waste products, NAAD is not only a biomarker of elevated
NAD þ metabolism but also a reserve metabolite that contributes
to elevated NAD þ over time.
Finally, in the first clinical study of NR, we established that
blood NAD þ metabolism is increased by single 100, 300 and
1,000 mg doses of NR without dose-dependent increases in
PBMC Nam or serious adverse events.
In people, as in mice, NAAD is the most sensitive biomarker of
boosting NADþ. While 1,000mg of NR elevated PBMC NAD þ

 from B12 to B18 mM and generated a B90% increase in 24h
AUC, NAAD was elevated from below the limit of quantification to
B1mM and generated a 2,900% increase in 24h AUC. The ability
to detect NAAD in human samples is expected to aid conduct of
clinical testing of NR. Availability of over-the-counter supplements
can complicate clinical trials because patients may enrol to obtain
compounds they expect to bring benefits and be inclined to take
supplements in case they are assigned to placebo. Detection of
NAAD should therefore be incorporated in phase II and III trials to
eliminate the confounding effects of off-study NR use.
Methods
Materials and reagents. NR Cl was produced under GMP conditions. Me2PY
and Me4PY were purchased from TLC PharmaChem Inc. (Vaughan, Ontario,
Canada). All other unlabelled analytes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St
Louis, MO) at highest purity. Internal standards [18O1]- Nam and [18O1]-NR were
prepared as described51,52. [18O1-D3]-MeNam was prepared by alkylation of
[18O1]-Nam with deuterated iodomethane. 13C-NA and [D4]-NA were purchased
from Toronto Chemical Research (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and C/D/N Isotopes,
Inc. (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada), respectively. To prepare [13C, D1]-NR, we
first converted 13C-NA to 13C-Nam (ref. 53) and D-[2-D1]-ribose (Omicron
Biochemicals, South Bend, IN) to the labelled D-ribofuranose tetraacetate54. The
labelled D-ribofuranose-tetraacetate and Nam were then used to synthesize double-
labelled NR55. [13C]-labelled nucleotides standards were prepared by growing yeast
in U-13C-glucose and extracting as described9.
Pilot human experiment. After overnight fasting, a healthy 52-year-old male self-
administered 1,000 mg of NR Cl orally at 8 am on 7 consecutive days. Blood and
urine were collected for quantitative NAD þ metabolomic analysis. The participant
took 0.25 g of NA to assess sensitivity to flushing and self-reported painful flushing
that lasted 1 h. No flushing was experienced on NR. The study was submitted for
approval by the University of Iowa institutional review board (IRB), which ruled it
not subject to human subjects research on the basis of informed self-
administration56.
Mice. For gavage experiments, 12-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson
Laboratories, Bar Harbour, ME) were housed 3–5 mice per cage on a chow diet
(Teklad 7013) for one week before the experiment. Body weight-matched groups
were randomly assigned to be given either 185 mg NR Cl per kg body weight
(n ¼ 3) or equimole amounts of NA (n ¼ 4) or Nam (n ¼ 4) by saline gavage. On
each experimental day, a saline injection (n ¼ 3) was performed and served as time
point zero and an additional saline gavage (n ¼ 3) timecourse was performed. To
avoid circadian effects, timecourses were established such that all tissue harvests
were performed at B2 pm. Double-labelled NR (n ¼ 3) was also administered by
gavage against a saline control (n ¼ 3). With protocols approved by the University
of Iowa Office of Animal Resources, mice were live-decapitated and the medullary
lobe of the liver was freeze-clamped at liquid nitrogen temperature. For IP
experiments,
6–8-week-old, male C57Bl/6J mice were injected with either PBS or 500 mg NR Cl
per kg body weight for 6 days. With protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Utah, mice were anaesthetised by
chloral hydrate and livers and hearts were freeze-clamped at liquid nitrogen
temperature. Tissues were stored at � 80 �C before analysis.
Clinical trial. A randomized, double-blind, three-arm crossover pharmacokinetic
study of oral NR chloride was performed at 100, 300 and 1,000 mg doses
(Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT02191462). Twelve healthy, non-pregnant subjects
(six male and six female) between the ages of 30 and 55 with body mass indices of
18.5–29.9 kg m � 2 were recruited and randomized to one of three treatment
sequences after screening, passing eligibility criteria and providing informed
consent. Overnight fasted subjects received a single morning dose of either 100 mg,
300 mg, or 1,000 mg of NR on 3 test days separated by 7-day periods in which no
supplement was given. To evaluate pharmacokinetics, blood was collected and
separated into plasma and PBMC fractions for analysis of the NAD þ metabolome
at pre-dose and again at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. Urine was collected pre-dose and in
0–6 h, 6–12 h and 12–24 h fractions. Safety, vitals, biometrics, complete blood
counts and a comprehensive metabolic panel were assessed at time zero and 24 h
after each dose. The study was reviewed and approved by the Natural Health
Products Directorate, Health Canada and IRB Services, Aurora, Ontario. Written
informed consent was obtained from each subject at the screening visit before all
study-related activities.
Exclusion criteria: women who were pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to
become pregnant during the course of the trial; use of natural health products/
dietary supplements within 7 days before randomization and during the course of
the study; use of vitamins or St John’s Wort 30 days before study enrolment; use
of supplements containing NR within 7 days before randomization and the
course of the study; use of nutritional yeast, whey proteins, energy drinks,
grapefruit and grapefruit juice, dairy products, alcohol for 7 days before the
study; consumption of 42 standard alcoholic drinks per day or drug abuse
within the past 6 months; smoking; blood pressure Z140/90; use of blood
pressure medications; use of cholesterol-lowering medications; metabolic diseases

screening (for example, aspartate transaminase and/or alanine transaminase
42 � upper limit of normal (ULN), and/or bilirubin 42 � ULN); planned
surgery during the course of the trial; history of or current diagnosis of any
cancer (except successfully treated basal cell carcinoma or cancer in full remission
45 years after diagnosis); history of blood/bleeding disorders; blood donation in
the previous 2 months; participation in a clinical research trial within 30 days
before randomization; allergy or sensitivity to study supplement ingredients or to
any food or beverage provided during the study; cognitive impairment and/or
inability to give informed consent; any other condition which in the qualified
investigator’s opinion may have adversely affected the subject’s ability to
complete the study or its measures or which may have posed significant risk to
the subject.
Sample preparation and targeted quantitative metabolomics. Dual extractions
were carried out for complete analysis of the NAD þ metabolome. For analysis of
NR, Nam, NA, MeNam, Me2PY and Me4PY (group A analytes), samples were
spiked with 60 pmol of [18O1]-Nam, [18O1]-NR and [D3, 18O1]-MeNam and
240 pmol [D4]-NA (internal standard (IS) A). For analysis of NAD þ, NADP þ,
NMN, NAR, NAMN, NAAD and ADPR (group B analytes), samples were dosed
with 13C-yeast extract (IS B) as described9.
Human samples. One hundred microlitre of urine was mixed with 20 ml of IS A
in 5% (v/v) formic acid or IS B in water for the analysis of group A and B analytes,
respectively. Fifty microlitre of ice-cold methanol was added and the mixture
vortexed before centrifugation at 16.1kg at 4 �C for 10 min. Supernatants were
injected without further dilution and analysed as described below. Standard curves
and quality controls for the complete analysis were prepared in the same manner as
described for urine samples but in water.
To quantify group A analytes in plasma, 100 ml of plasma was added to 20 ml of
IS A prepared in 5% (v/v) formic acid and mixed with 400 ml of ice-cold methanol.
The mixture was allowed to sit on ice for 20 min then centrifuged as described for
urine. After drying under vacuum overnight at 35 �C, the sample was reconstituted
in 100ml of water. To quantify group B analytes, 100ml of plasma was added to 10 ml
of IS B in water and mixed with 300 ml of acetonitrile with vortexing for 15 s. After
briefly resting on ice, the samples were centrifuged as above. Supernatants were
applied to Phenomenex Phree SPE cartridges (Torrance, CA) and the flow-through
collected. 200 ml of aqueous acetonitrile (four volumes acetonitrile: one volume
water) was also applied and the flow-through collected. The flow-through from both
steps was combined and dried via speed vacuum. Samples were reconstituted in
60 ml of water. Standard curves and quality controls for both analyses were prepared
in donor plasma (University of Iowa DeGowin Blood Center, Iowa City, IA) and
extracted using the same method employed for plasma samples.
PBMC fractions were thawed on ice and simultaneously extracted for both A
and B analyses when possible. 100 ml of sample was added to either 20 ml of IS A in
5% formic acid (v/v) or 10 ml IS B in water for quantification of group A and B
analytes, respectively. Samples were then mixed with 300 ml of acetonitrile and
vortexed for 15 s. Samples were shaken for 5 min at 40 �C then centrifuged as
described above. For group A analytes, supernatants were dried via speed vacuum
overnight at 35 �C after this step. For group B analytes, supernatant was applied to
Phenomenex Phree SPE cartridges and treated in the same manner as described
above for quantification of group B analytes in plasma. Immediately before
analysis, samples were reconstituted in either 100 ml of 10 mM ammonium acetate
with 0.1% formic acid (for group A analyte quantification) or 100 ml of 5% (v/v)
aqueous methanol (for group B analyte quantification). Standard curves were
prepared in water and processed in the same manner as samples.
Murine samples. For the IP experiment, male C57Bl/6J mice were injected with
either saline or NR Cl (500 mg kg � 1) for 6 days. On the day of tissue harvests, mice
were anaesthetized by chloral hydrate before collection of liver and heart both of
which were freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen. All tissues were stored at � 80 �C
before extraction.
Murine liver and heart obtained by freeze-clamp were pulverized using a
Bessman pulverizer (100–1,000 mg size) (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho
Dominguez, CA) cooled to liquid N2 temperatures. Each pulverized liver and heart
sample was aliquoted (5–20 mg) into two liquid N2 cooled 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes,
which were stored at � 80 �C until analysis. Before extraction, murine liver sample
identities were masked and sample order randomized.
Before extraction, IS A and IS B were added to separate aliquots resting on dry
ice for quantification of group A and B analytes, respectively. Samples were
extracted by addition of 0.1 ml of buffered ethanol (three volumes ethanol: one
volume 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.1) at 80 �C. Samples were vortexed vigorously until
thawed, sonicated in a bath sonicator (10 s followed by 15 s on ice, repeated twice
for liver and thrice for heart), vortexed, then placed into a Thermomixer
(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) set to 80 �C and shaken at 1,050 r.p.m. for 5 min.

 Samples were centrifuged as described above. Clarified supernatants were
transferred to fresh 1.5 ml tubes and dried via speed vacuum for two h. Before
LC-MS analysis, samples were resuspended in 40 ml of 10 mM ammonium acetate
(499% pure) in LC-MS-grade water. Sample preparation following
[13C1, D1]-NR administration differed only in the following respect. In lieu of IS A,
60 pmol of [D4]-Nam and [D3, 18O1]-MeNam and 240 pmol of [D4]-NA were
added to sample. Standard curves were prepared in water without extraction.
LC-MS. Separation and quantitation of analytes were performed with a Waters
Acquity LC interfaced with a Waters TQD mass spectrometer operated in positive
ion multiple reaction monitoring mode as described9. MeNam, Me2PY and Me4PY
were added to the analysis and detected using the following transitions: MeNam
(m/z 137494, cone voltage ¼ 8 V, collision energy ¼ 20 V); Me2PY (m/z 1534107,
cone voltage ¼ 44 V, collision energy ¼ 22 V); and Me4PY (m/z 1534136, cone
voltage ¼ 24 V, collision energy ¼ 14 V). For the analysis of urine, plasma and
murine liver, heart and blood cells, group A analytes were separated as described
for the acid separation9. In blood cells, group A analytes were separated on a
2.1 � 150 mm Synergy Fusion-RP (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using the same
gradient and mobile phase as described for the acid separation9. For human
samples, group B analytes were separated using the mobile phase and gradient as
previously described for the alkaline separation9. Murine liver and heart extracts
were analysed using a slightly altered alkaline separation on a 2.1 � 100 mm
Thermo Hypercarb column. Specifically, flow rate was increased to 0.55 ml min � 1
and run time shortened to 11.6 min. Separation was performed using a modified
gradient with initial equilibration at 3% B, a 0.9 min hold, a gradient to 50% B over
6.3 min, followed by a 1 min wash at 90% B and a 3 min re-equilibration at 3% B.
Analytes in human plasma were quantified by dividing their peak areas by IS
peak areas and comparing the ratio to a background-subtracted standard curve.
Analytes in all other matrices were quantified by dividing their peak areas by IS
peak areas and comparing the ratio to a standard curve in water. Urinary
metabolites were normalized to creatinine concentrations. Hepatic metabolites
were normalized to wet liver weights.
For both human and mouse samples, samples were transferred to Waters
polypropylene plastic total recovery vials (Part # 186002639) after extraction or
preparation and stored in a Waters Acquity H class autosampler maintained at
8 �C until injection. In all cases, 10 ml of extract was loaded onto the column.
For analysis of enrichment in murine liver, metabolites were separated
following the same LC procedure described above and detected using a Waters
Premier Q-TOF operated in positive ion, full-scan mode. Leucine enkephalin was
infused to ensure high mass accuracy. Enrichment data were corrected for natural
isotope abundance based on theoretical isotope distribution, 13-carbon abundance
skew and the purity of the labelled standard (3/97% [13C1]-NR/[13C1, D1]-NR).
Quantification was performed on the Waters TQD as described above and used to
determine the quantity of non-labelled and labelled metabolites. Separation and
quantification of analytes was performed with a Waters Acquity LC interfaced with
a Waters TQD mass spectrometer operated in positive ion multiple reaction
monitoring mode. Enrichment analysis was performed with a Waters Q-TOF
Premier mass spectrometer operated in positive ion, full-scan mode with the same
LC conditions as described for non-enrichment experiments.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism
version 6.00 for Windows, (La Jolla, CA). Sample sizes were sufficiently powered
(1—b ¼ 0.8, a ¼ 0.05) to detect at least a 2-fold difference in NAD þ concentration.
Murine liver data were analysed using two-way analysis of variance, whereas
human blood cells were analysed using a repeated measure, two-way analysis
of variance. Holm–Sidak and Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests were performed
when comparing more than two groups. AUCs in blood cells were calculated
after subtracting pre-dose metabolite concentrations of each experimental series.
For mouse data, AUCs were calculated as described57 after subtracting the saline
group for that day and propagating error. Data are expressed as means±s.e.m.
Group variances were similar in all cases. A P valueo0.05 was considered
significant.
Data availability. Metabolomic data have been deposited in Metabolights
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) under accession code MTBLS368.
