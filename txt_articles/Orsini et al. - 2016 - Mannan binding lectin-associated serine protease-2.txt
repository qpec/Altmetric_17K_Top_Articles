Abstract
Background: Complement activation via the lectin activation pathway (LP) has been identified as the key
mechanism behind post-ischemic tissue inflammation causing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) which can
significantly impact the clinical outcome of ischemic disease. This work defines the contributions of each of
the three LP-associated enzymes—mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP)-1, MASP-2, and
MASP-3—to ischemic brain injury in experimental mouse models of stroke.
Methods: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in wild-type (WT) mice or mice deficient for defined complement
components by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) or three-vessel occlusion (3VO). The inhibitory
MASP-2 antibody was administered systemically 7 and 3.5 days before and at reperfusion in WT mice in order to
assure an effective MASP-2 inhibition throughout the study. Forty-eight hours after ischemia, neurological deficits
and infarct volumes were assessed. C3 deposition and microglia/macrophage morphology were detected by
immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, and confocal analyses.
Results: MASP-2-deficient mice (MASP-2−/−) and WT mice treated with an antibody that blocks MASP-2 activity
had significantly reduced neurological deficits and histopathological damage after transient ischemia and
reperfusion compared to WT or control-treated mice. Surprisingly, MASP-1/3−/− mice were not protected, while
mice deficient in factor B (fB−/−) showed reduced neurological deficits compared to WT mice. Consistent with
behavioral and histological data, MASP-2−/− had attenuated C3 deposition and presented with a significantly
higher proportion of ramified, surveying microglia in contrast to the hypertrophic pro-inflammatory microglia/
macrophage phenotype seen in the ischemic brain tissue of WT mice.

Conclusions: This work demonstrates the essential role of the low-abundant MASP-2 in the mediation of cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury and demonstrates that targeting MASP-2 by an inhibitory therapeutic antibody markedly
improved the neurological and histopathological outcome after focal cerebral ischemia. These results contribute to
identifying the key lectin pathway component driving brain tissue injury following cerebral ischemia and call for a
revision of the presently widely accepted view that MASP-1 is an essential activator of the lectin pathway effector
component MASP-2.

Background
Inflammatory mechanisms intrinsic to brain and blood-
borne inflammatory mediators are among the major
drivers of focal injury following cerebral ischemia. Among
the inflammatory cascades, the complement system repre-
sents a powerful contributor to ischemic brain injury by
several possible mechanisms including anaphylatoxin re-
lease, endothelial activation aiding leukocyte adhesion and
recruitment, over-activation of the phagocytic system, and
direct cellular lysis [1]. Activation of the complement can
be achieved by three distinct pathways: the classical path-
way (CP), the alternative pathway (AP), and the lectin
pathway (LP). All three pathways encompass tightly regu-
lated sequential activation cascades converging at the
cleavage of the abundant complement component C3.
Cleavage of C3 releases the small complement anaphyla-
toxin C3a and the large C3b fragment, which possess pro-
inflammatory properties and promote opsonization and
direct phagocytosis, respectively. In addition, C3b is also a
constituent of the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb), and the
deposition of C3b promotes the formation of more AP C3
convertases by binding to native factor B (fB) to form the
AP zymogen complex C3bB [2]. C3b is also an essential
component of both C5-cleaving convertase complexes
(C3bBb(C3b)n and C4b2a(C3b)n, respectively). With the
cleavage of C5, the last enzymatic step of complement
activation is completed. C5 cleavage releases the potent
complement anaphylatoxin C5a and the larger fragment
C5b that initiates the formation of the membrane attack
complex (MAC) by subsequent recruitment of the ter-
minal cascade components C6-C9. This MAC inserts into
cell membranes to form a pore that results in ion flux,
causing cell lysis.
The critical contribution of the complement system to
the pathophysiology of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)
has been demonstrated in several models of ischemia-
reperfusion injury [3–7]. It was initially hypothesized
that the complement activation pathway responsible for
IRI is the CP driven by natural antibodies binding to
ischemia-damaged cells [8]. The involvement of the LP in
IRI was first described by Collard et al. in 2000 [9], a find-
ing that was later underlined by our own work reporting
the observation that CP-deficient C1q−/− mice were not
protected in models of cerebral IRI [6]. The prominent
role of the LP over the CP in mediating IRI was under-
lined by the protective phenotype of mannan-binding
lectin (MBL) deficiency and the therapeutic effect of
inhibitory molecules against MBL in various mouse
models [7, 10–14]. Deficiency or inhibition of MBL
achieved long-lasting neuroprotection and improved func-
tional outcome in mouse models of stroke with a wide
window for therapeutic intervention (up to 24 h) [13].
The latter findings are supported by numerous recent
publications, which underline the prominent role of the
LP in the pathogenesis and progression of brain damage
in a clinical context. In stroke patients, the LP was shown
to be the relevant pathway in the progression of ischemic
brain damage [12, 15–17] with studies highlighting MBL
[18, 19] and ficolin-3 [15], two different LP recognition
molecules, as independent predictors of ischemic stroke
outcome.
The initiation of the complement activation via the LP
requires the binding of one or more of the five different
human recognition subcomponents (i.e., MBL, collectin-
11 (CL-11), ficolin-1, ficolin-2, or ficolin-3) or the five
different mouse recognition components (i.e., MBL-A,
MBL-C, CL-11, ficolin-A, or ficolin-B) to their cognate
ligands on activating surfaces [20–22]. The ligands that
mediate the binding of LP recognition components on
ischemic cells are presently unknown. LP activation
complexes are formed when a multimolecular complex
composed of oligomers of homotrimeric recognition
subunits associated with LP-specific serine proteases,
called mannan-binding lectin-associated serine prote-
ases (MASPs), bind to cognate ligands on activator sur-
faces. Three MASP enzymes named MASP-1, MASP-2,
Orsini et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation  (2016) 13:213

 and MASP-3 have been described and are encoded by
two different genes. The MASP1 gene is located on
human chromosome 3 (mouse chromosome 16) and
encodes MASP-1 and MASP-3. The MASP2 gene is
located on human chromosome 1 (mouse chromosome 4)
and encodes the serine protease MASP-2 [23, 24].
Of the three different MASPs, only MASP-2 is able to
cleave both C2 and C4 to form the LP C3 convertase
C4bC2a and the C5 convertase C4bC2a(C3b)n. Indeed,
in the absence of MASP-2, but not of MASP-1/MASP-3,
a complete inhibition of LP activation was observed
[20, 25]. In addition, targeting MASP-2 by gene dis-
ruption or administration of antibodies that inhibit
MASP-2 functional activity reduced IRI in models of
myocardial, intestinal, or renal IRI [20, 26].
With respect to MASP-1, previous work suggested
that, due to its ability to cleave C2 but not C4, it cannot
drive LP activation in the absence of MASP-2 but may
facilitate MASP-2-driven LP activation [20, 27–29]. A
recent study, however, proposed that MASP-1 has an
essential role in driving MASP-2 and LP activation by
being an exclusive activator of MASP-2 [30], analogous
to the CP serine proteases where C1r is the exclusive
activator of C1s [31]. Further studies attributed an add-
itional role to MASP-1 and/or MASP-3 in driving AP
activation by converting factor D (fD) and/or fB zymo-
gen into their enzymatically active forms [32, 33].
As for the subsequent activation steps, the activation
of complement C3, but not of complement C5, was
shown to be instrumental in the development of cerebral
IRI, as demonstrated in a mouse model of focal ischemia
[34]. Thus, it appears that C5a is not required to medi-
ate the hallmarks of post-ischemic inflammation such as
endothelial cell activation, facilitation of leukocyte adhe-
sion and recruitment, and activation of phagocytic cells.
This study reveals the involvement of MASPs in cere-
bral IRI by assessing the impact of MASP-2 and of
combined MASP-1 and MASP-3 deficiency in gene-
targeted mouse strains and in WT mice treated with a
MASP-2-specific inhibitor on functional and histopatho-
logical damage following cerebral focal ischemia. We
directly compared our findings against the phenotypes
seen in fB-deficient and C4-deficient mice (fB−/− and C4−/−,
respectively) analyzed in parallel.
Methods
Animals
Procedures involving animals and their care for transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) surgery were
conducted at the Mario Negri Institute in conformity
with institutional guidelines (Quality Management System
Certificate-UNI EN ISO 9001:2008, Reg. no. 8576-A) in
compliance with national (D.L. n:116,G.U. suppl. 40,
February 18, 1992) and international laws and policies
(EEC Council Directive 86/609, OJL 358,1; Dec. 12, 1987;
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,
US National Research Council 1996, Eight Edition, 2011).
All animal experiments were approved by the Mario Negri
Institutional Animal Care Committee. Male 9- to 13-
week-old C57Bl/6J (Charles River Laboratories, Italy) and
MASP-2−/− [20], MASP-1/3−/− [27], C4−/− [8], and fB−/−
[35] mice (bred at the Biomedical Services, University of
Leicester) were used.
Procedures involving animals and their care for three-
vessel occlusion (3VO) surgery were conducted at the
University of Leicester, in accordance to the UK Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986. Female 9- to 13-week-
old C57Bl/6J (Charles River Laboratories, UK) and MASP-
2−/− mice (Biomedical Services, University of Leicester)
were used.
MASP-2 inhibitory antibody treatment
The inhibitory MASP-2 antibody (HG4) used in this
study is a derivative of the human MASP-2 inhibitory
mAb OMS721 modified for improved LP inhibition in
mice. HG4 and isotype control (IC) antibody (ET904,
supplied by BioLegend) were administered (10 mg/kg
intraperitoneally) twice (7 and 3.5 days) as single injec-
tions prior to initiation of ischemia and once (10 mg/kg
intravenously), again as a single injection, at time of
reperfusion.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
Surgery
tMCAO was induced by a siliconized filament (7-0, Doccol
Corporation) introduced into the right carotid artery and
advanced to block the origin of MCA for 60 min as de-
scribed previously [6, 13]. Surgery-associated mortality rate
was 7 %. See also Additional file 1.
Neurological deficits
At 48 h after tMCAO, each mouse was rated on two
neurological function scales unique to mouse [5, 36].
The general deficit scale describes the well-being of the
mouse, evaluating hair, ears, eyes, posture, spontaneous
activity, and epileptic behavior. The focal deficit scale eval-
uates body symmetry, gait, climbing on a surface held at
45°, circling behavior, front limb symmetry, compulsory
circling, and whisker response to a light touch. In both
scales, the mice were scored from 0 (healthy mouse) to 28
(the worst performance in all categories) by a trained in-
vestigator blinded to the experimental conditions. See also
Additional file 1.
Infarct-volume quantification
After assessment of neurological deficits, the mice were
perfused and brains were obtained as described previously
[6]. Twenty-micron coronal brain cryosections were cut

 serially and stained with cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich).
Ischemic lesion size was calculated on seven slices by
delineating the infarcted area, visualized by the rela-
tive paleness of histological staining. Infarct volumes
were calculated by the integration of infarcted areas
after correction for the percentage of brain swelling
due to edema using Analytical Image System (Imaging
Research Inc.). See also Additional file 1.
Three-vessel occlusion
Surgery
3VO was conducted as described by Yanamoto et al. 2003
[37]. The two common carotid arteries (CCAs) were
exposed, and the left one was clipped. The left MCA was
exposed through a small burr hole in the temporal bone
and permanently occluded using a bipolar coagulator.
Complete ischemia was induced by clipping the right
CCA for 30 min. Then, both clips on CCAs were re-
moved, allowing reperfusion. Surgery-associated mortality
rate was 8 %. See Additional file 1.
Infarct-volume quantification
Twenty-four hours after 3VO, the mice were sacrificed
by cervical dislocation and then brains were removed,
cut serially at 1-mm intervals, and stained with 2,3,5-
triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) for infarct mea-
surements using Analytical Image System. See also
Additional file 1.
Lectin pathway-specific C3 deposition assay
To assess the inhibitory effects of antibody administration
on systemic LP functional activity, the sera of the mice
treated with HG4 or its corresponding isotype control anti-
body were analyzed in LP-specific C3 deposition ELISA, as
described previously [20].
Microglia/macrophage and C3 immunofluorescence and
confocal analysis
Twenty-micrometer coronal brain sections were incu-
bated with rat anti-mouse CD11b (1:500, kindly pro-
vided by Dr. Doni, for microglia/macrophage staining)
and rabbit anti-C3 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
primary antibodies followed by Alexa 546 anti-rat and
Alexa 488 anti-rabbit (both 1:500, Invitrogen) secondary
antibodies [13, 38]. Images were acquired by confocal mi-
croscopy as described previously [38]. Three-dimensional
images were acquired over a 10- to 12-μm z-axis with a
0.23-μm step size and processed using Imaris software
(Bitplane) and Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems Europe
Ltd). See also Additional file 1.
Microglia/macrophage and C3 immunohistochemical
analysis
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 20-μm brain
coronal sections using rat anti-mouse CD11b (1:800, kindly
provided by Dr. Doni) and rabbit anti-C3 polyclonal (1:50,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by biotinylated anti-
rat and anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Labora-
tories, CA, USA). Positive cells were stained by reaction
with 3,3diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride (DAB, Vector
laboratories). For negative control staining, the primary
antibody was omitted, and no staining was observed.
For quantitative analysis of microglia/macrophage,
field selection was performed on one brain coronal section
(+0.1 mm from the bregma, Additional file 1: Figure S1)
using a BX61 Olympus microscope equipped with a mo-
torized stage. Frames were acquired using the software
AnalySIS (Olympus) [38]. Twelve quantification fields at
×40 magnification (pixel size = 0.172 μm) were uniformly
distributed over the cortex. Image processing was per-
formed using Fiji software [39] through the algorithm
previously described [40]. Once segmented, the cells
were measured for the following parameters: area,
Feret’s diameter (caliper), and solidity. Mean single-cell
values for each parameter were used for statistics. See also
Additional file 1.
For quantitative analysis of C3 staining, the entire ipsi-
lateral cortex of one coronal section per mouse (+0.1 mm
from the bregma) was acquired at ×20 by Olympus BX-61
Virtual Stage microscope, with a pixel size of 0.346 μm.
Acquisition was done over 6-μm thick stacks, with a step
size of 2 μm. The different focal planes were merged into
a single stack by mean intensity projection to ensure
consistent focus throughout the sample. The acquired
area was analyzed using Fiji software. C3 staining was
expressed as positive pixels/total assessed pixels and re-
ported as the percentage of total stained area as previously
described [38].
Blinding and statistical analysis
All experimental procedures including surgery, behavioral
tests, infarct-volume quantification, immunofluorescence,
immunohistochemical analyses, and biochemical assays
were performed by investigators blinded to the experi-
mental conditions. Group size was defined using the
following formula: n = 2σ2f(α, β) / Δ2 (sd in groups = σ,
type 1 error α = 0.05, type II error β = 0.2, percentage dif-
ference between groups Δ = 20). For each measure, the
standard deviation between groups was calculated on the
basis of previous experiments with the same output
parameters (e.g., for lesion volume quantification σ = 17,
yielding n = 11.4). p values lower than 0.05 and 0.01 were
considered significant and highly significant, respectively.
Data are expressed as scatter-dot plots and means (bars).
GraphPad Prism 6 software was used for statistical

 analysis. All the data were checked for normal distribution
by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and unpaired t test or one-
way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was used
for statistical comparison among groups.
Results
MASP-2 significantly contributes to brain damage
following cerebral IRI
First, we focused on MASP-2, the effector enzyme required
for LP functional activity. Forty-eight-hours tMCAO, the
MASP-2−/− mice exhibited significantly lower neurological
deficits when compared to the WT mice (44 and
39 % reduction for general and focal deficits, respect-
ively, Fig. 1a). The improved neurological function in
the MASP-2−/− mice was associated with significantly
reduced infarct volumes compared to the WT mice
(19 % reduction, Fig. 1b).
Protection in the MASP-2−/− mice was also observed in
an additional model of stroke, the 3VO model. MASP-2
deficiency promoted tissue preservation also in this model
as evidenced by a 31 % reduction in infarct volume
(Fig. 1c).
To assess whether the protective phenotype observed
in the MASP-2−/− mice could also be obtained by
pharmacological inhibition of MASP-2, the effect of
MASP-2-blocking mAb was evaluated. A pharmacody-
namic evaluation in naive mice indicated that single-dose
intraperitoneal administration of MASP-2-blocking anti-
body HG4 (5 mg/kg) effectively suppressed systemic LP
functional activity to undetectable levels for approximately
3 days followed by a partial pathway recovery after 7 days
(Additional file 1: Figure S2). To assure effective LP inhib-
ition throughout the study, the mice were administered
HG4 or IC intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg) as a single dose 7
and 3.5 days prior to tMCAO and also received a single
dose of either test agent (10 mg/kg intravenously) at time
of reperfusion (Fig. 2a). Neurological assessments demon-
strated that treatment with MASP-2 antibody significantly
improved neurological deficits compared to equivalent
dosing of IC 48 h after tMCAO (46 and 45 % reduction
for general and focal deficits, respectively, Fig. 2b). Neuro-
logical improvement in MASP-2 antibody-treated mice
was accompanied by significant reduction in lesion vol-
umes (20 % reduction, Fig. 2c). A LP-specific C3 depos-
ition assay was performed 48 h after ischemia to verify

 persistence of the inhibitory activity of the therapeutic
antibody HG4 following injury. This assay showed that C3
deposition on mannan was significantly reduced in serum
collected from HG4-treated compared to IC-treated mice
(Fig. 2d) after reperfusion.
The absence of MASP-1 and/or MASP-3 functional activity
does not protect from brain damage following cerebral IRI
Since it has been suggested that MASP-1 is essential for
MASP-2 activation [30], we explored the post-ischemic
inflammatory response in MASP-1/3−/− mice. No differ-
ences in neurological deficits were observed in MASP-1/
3−/− when compared to WT mice, while infarct volumes
were increased (Fig. 3a). These findings indicate that
(i) in contrast to MASP-2, neither MASP-1 nor MASP-3
contribute to cerebral IRI following tMCAO ischemic in-
sults and (ii) MASP-1 is not required to activate MASP-2
in an in vivo model of stroke.
C4 deficiency does not protect from cerebral IRI
It has previously been reported that LP-mediated IRI is
independent of complement C4 in models of renal and
myocardial IRI. In C4-deficient human and mouse serum,
a reduced but clearly detectable residual LP functional
activity is maintained through a MASP-2-dependent C4-
bypass activation route [20, 26]. In order to assess if this
C4-bypass route is sufficient to mediate cerebral IRI,
we included C4−/− mice in our study. As shown in
Fig. 3b, no differences in either ischemic volume or
in the neurological-deficit scoring were detectable be-
tween the C4−/− and WT mice 48 h after tMCAO.
Alternative pathway functional activity is not essentially
required to mediate cerebral IRI
The role of AP in cerebral IRI is still a subject of debate.
We included fB−/− mice, a mouse strain which completely
lacks AP functional activity, for direct comparison. In
Fig. 2 Antibody-targeted MASP-2 inhibition significantly reduces neurological deficits and infarct volumes following tMCAO. 10 mg/Kg of the
anti-MASP-2 and its respective isotype control (IC) antibody were administered as single doses on 7 and 3.5 days before and 60 min after tMCAO
induction (n = 9) (a). Neurological deficits (b) and infarct volumes (c) were assessed 48 h post-tMCAO. Representative images from cresyl violet
staining are also shown for each of the experimental groups. Serum was collected 48 h post-tMCAO from MASP-2-antibody or IC pre-treated
animals and complement functional activity tested in a lectin pathway-specific ELISA (d) (IC, n = 8; anti-MASP-2 antibody, n = 7). Data are presented as
scatter-dot plots with means (bars). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01, unpaired t test

 these mice, the general neurological deficits were atten-
uated compared to the WT mice (31.8 % reduction),
although focal histopathological deficits and ischemic
volumes were not different from those seen in WT
(Fig. 3c). These results indicate a moderate contribu-
tion of the AP in cerebral IRI as assessed 48 h after
tMCAO.
MASP-2 but not MASP-1/3 deficiency attenuates C3
deposition and reduces the pro-inflammatory microglia/
macrophage phenotype in ischemic brain tissue
To further explore the effects of targeting either MASP-2
or MASP-1 and MASP-3, we analyzed C3 deposition and
microglia morphology in the ischemic brain areas of the
MASP-2−/−, MASP-1/3−/−, and WT mice. Immunofluor-
escence demonstrated that C3 deposition was markedly
reduced in MASP-2−/− compared to the WT or MASP-1/
3−/− mice (Fig. 4a–c). In addition, in the MASP-2−/− mice,
CD11b-positive cells, staining microglia/macrophages [38],
had a decreased hypertrophic and amoeboid morphology
compared to the WT or MASP-1/3−/− mice (Fig. 4a–c). At
higher magnification, CD11b-positive cells appeared to be
hypertrophic only when in close association with C3,
as
detectable
in
the
WT and
MASP-1/3−/−
mice
(Fig. 4d, f). Conversely, CD11b-positive cells had thin-
ner ramifications with less C3 deposition seen in the
MASP-2−/− mice (Fig. 4e). The quantification of C3 stain-
ing on lesioned cortices confirmed that the MASP-2−/−
Fig. 3 MASP-1/-3 and C4 deficiency are not protective in cerebral IRI, while fB deficiency affords a moderate degree of protection. General and
focal neurological deficits and ischemic volume were assessed 48 h post-tMCAO in MASP-1/3−/− (a), C4−/− (b), and fB−/− (c) mice and their WT
controls (n = 9, n = 7/8, n = 10/12, respectively). Representative cresyl violet-stained brain slices show typical lesions. Data are reported as scatter-dot
plots and mean bars. *P < 0.05, unpaired t test

 mice (Fig. 5b, d) had less C3 deposition compared to WT
while MASP-1/3−/− were not different (Fig. 5a, c, d).
To
further
define
microglia/macrophage
pheno-
types, their morphology was characterized in the WT,
MASP-2−/−, or MASP-1/3−/− mice 48 h after ischemia
(Fig. 6a). Although the percentage of total CD11b-stained
areas did not differ between the WT and MASP-2−/− mice
(6.95 ± 1.76 and 7.13 ± 1.81 % stained area, respectively),
the measurement of morphological parameters revealed
that, in the MASP-2−/− mice, brain microglia/macro-
phages predominantly maintained the shape of ramified,
surveying microglia (Fig. 6a) showing significantly reduced
areas (Fig. 6b), lower Feret’s diameter (Fig. 6c), and solidity
values (Fig. 6d) compared to the WT mice. This
strongly indicates that, in the absence of MASP-2, the
prevailing microglial phenotype is that of ramified, sur-
veying microglia while, in the WT and MASP-1/3−/−
mice, the predominant phenotype is that of less rami-
fied, activated, pro-inflammatory microglia. No differ-
ences were found between the MASP-1/3−/− and WT
ischemic mice in CD11b-positive cell morphology pa-
rameters (Fig. 6b–d) suggesting that MASP-1/3 defi-
ciency did not alter the state of microglia/macrophage
activation.

To confirm that the ischemic injury ensues from specific
complement deficiencies and not from differences in the
vascular architecture among the different genotypes, we
assessed the vascular features in every mouse strain used
(Additional file 1: Figure S3A). The distance from the
midline to the anastomotic line (defined by the anasto-
motic points between the anterior cerebral artery, ACA,
and the middle cerebral artery, MCA) was measured at
4 and 6 mm from the frontal pole (Additional file 1:
Figure S3B). The results obtained did not reveal any dif-
ferences between the deficient and WT mice (Additional
file 1: Figure S3C).
Discussion
This study provides a comparative analysis of the pheno-
types of mouse lines with targeted deficiencies of the LP-
specific serine proteases MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3
in a mouse model of stroke. Our analysis includes func-
tional outcomes based on behavior tests (focal deficit and
general neurological deficits) and histopathological out-
comes (infarct sizes) as well as immunohistochemistry
for deposition of the C3 activation products as a par-
ameter for complement activation events within the is-
chemic areas of the brain and for morphometric endpoints
(morphology of CD11b-positive macrophages/microglial
cells). An AP-deficient mouse line with a targeted defi-
ciency of the essential AP zymogen fB and a CP-deficient
mouse line with a targeted deficiency in C4 were also evalu-
ated. When compared to the WT mice, a strong protective
phenotype was observed in the MASP-2-deficient mice at
the level of functional and histopathological outcomes.
Absence of MASP-2 lead to reduced C3 deposition in the
ischemic brain area and less prominent hypertrophic and
amoeboid microglial morphology. Similarly, improved
outcomes were observed in the WT mice treated with a
MASP-2-inhibitory antibody, corroborating the findings
observed in the MASP-2−/− mice.
Overall, the CD11b morphological analysis revealed
that, in the absence of MASP-2 functional activity, micro-
glial cells within the ischemic areas primarily present as
ramified microglia suggestive of an anti-inflammatory
polarization state [41–43] as opposed to the hypertrophic
microglial morphology associated with phagocytic activity
and pro-inflammatory state in the ischemic areas of WT
brains. The complement system has a major role in the
activation of microglia, which constitutively express recep-
tors for C1q and for C3 cleavage products. As a conse-
quence of complement component binding, microglia
activate phagocytosis and cytokine production. Activated
microglia in turn contribute to complement component
production that feeds autocrine/paracrine signaling [41].
Since microglia act as a major contributor to post-injury

 inflammatory responses, it is plausible that complement
activation through MASP-2-dependent processes could
drive microglia from the ramified, surveying state towards
the pro-inflammatory phagocytic phenotype, with visual-
ized morphological changes of amoeboid cell shape, an
enlarged cell soma, and retracted processes [40, 41, 44].
Since in vitro experiments suggested that MASP-1 ful-
fills a critical role in the activation of MASP-2 [45], we
expected that the mice deficient in MASP-1 would also
show protection from cerebral IRI following tMCAO.
Surprisingly, the MASP-1/3−/− mice presented with lar-
ger infarct volumes then their WT controls but showed
a very similar degree of severity in neurological deficits.
Likewise, the degree of C3 deposition within the ische-
mic areas in the brains of the MASP-1/3−/− was similar
to that seen in the WT mice. The morphometric analysis
of microglia revealed no differences between the WT
and MASP-1/3−/− mice. The absence of any degree of
protection of the MASP-1 and MASP-3 double-deficient
mouse line indicates that neither MASP-1 nor MASP-3
are involved in the pathophysiological processes leading
to cerebral IRI.
Several studies have indicated that MASP-1 acts as a
rate-limiting protease in the activation of MASP-2 in
serum. SFMI-1, a peptide that preferentially inhibits
MASP-1, was reported to inhibit the LP to an extent

 similar to a MASP-2-specific peptide inhibitor, SFMI-2
[45]. Subsequent studies using second-generation peptide
inhibitors of either MASP-1 or MASP-2 with greater
specificity corroborated the initial results. These find-
ings led to the hypothesis that, in the LP, MASP-1 is
the initiating protease critically required to cleave MASP-
2 zymogen into its enzymatically active form, analogous to
the CP where C1r is the exclusive activator of C1s [30].
Separate in vitro studies using serum from a Malpuech–
Michels–Mingarelli–Carnevale (3MC) patient lacking both
MASP-1 and MASP-3 supported this hypothesis [46]. We
previously reported that serum of mice deficient in both
MASP-1 and MASP-3 maintains a reduced but clearly de-
tectable LP functional activity [20, 27].
The in vivo data presented here demonstrate that target-
ing MASP-2 reduces cerebral IRI while the absence of
MASP-1 and MASP-3 affords no protection. MASP-2
does not require MASP-1 to drive IRI. Thus, targeting
MASP-1 is unlikely to disrupt the LP-mediated patho-
physiological processes that lead to unfavorable outcomes.
It is undisputed that MASP-1 facilitates the conversion
of zymogen MASP-2 into its enzymatically active form,
most likely because the relatively low abundance of
MASP-2 compared to MASP-1 is a limiting factor dur-
ing the LP-specific trans-activation events involving the
juxtaposition of activating complexes [47]. The non-
protective phenotype of a combined MASP-1 and MASP-
3 deficiency in a MASP-2-dependent pathophysiological
process underlines that MASP-1 is not an essential activa-
tor of MASP-2 functional activity and highlights the
fundamental differences between LP and CP activation
events.
We demonstrate that targeting MASP-2 with a specific
inhibitory antibody is very effective in limiting both the
post-stroke neurological deficits as well as the associated
ischemic lesion and in reducing the consequent activation
of microglia towards the pro-inflammatory amoeboid
phenotype.
This study complements our previous work in which
we targeted the LP recognition subcomponents MBL-A
and MBL-C by either MBL-specific mAbs or through
the injection of an excess of a fluid-phase carbohydrate
ligand orthologue [13]. There are advantages to targeting
the single, low-abundance LP enzyme that critically
drives the pathophysiology of cerebral IRI over targeting
one or more of the five different LP recognition compo-
nents. Mice, for example, do not express an orthologue
for the human recognition subcomponent ficolin-3 (alias
H-ficolin) [48]. Our own recent work has demonstrated
that ficolin-3 drives LP activation in patients with sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage [17]. In stroke patients, ficolin-1
(alias M-ficolin) serum levels are dramatically decreased
at time point 6 h after the onset of symptoms, suggest-
ing massive ficolin-1 consumption following cerebral
ischemia. Ficolin-2 (alias L-ficolin) and ficolin-3 levels
also decrease during the acute phase, while serum MBL
levels remain unaffected [49]. These findings are in full
agreement with a previously published clinical study
reporting the consumption of ficolin-3 and ficolin-2
during the acute phase of stroke [15]. These reports
strongly suggest that in man, ficolins are critically in-
volved in triggering LP activation during the reperfu-
sion phase and that blocking MBL in stroke patients
might be therapeutically less effective than what we and
others observed when targeting MBL in mouse models
of cerebral ischemia. In addition to its low abundance,
MASP-2 is exclusively synthesized in the liver [50], and
the effectiveness of systemic MASP-2 inhibitory agents
in target organs is not complicated by local biosynthesis.
The assessment of fB−/− mice in our model of tMCAO
suggests that the AP contributes to IRI following cere-
bral ischemia as indicated by the significant amelioration
of general neurological deficits. An even stronger protec-
tion has previously been reported by Elvington et al. [51]
in which a reduction in both neurological deficits and in
ischemic volume were observed in fB−/− mice. In our
hands, the lack of AP activation does not affect the
lesion size as assessed by cresyl violet staining following
correction for oedema. The factor B data suggest a role
for the AP in cerebral IRI by amplifying complement
activation initiated by the LP. The predominant role of
the MASP-2-dependent LP over the AP in the mediation
of cerebral IRI pathology is underlined by the lack of a
protective IRI phenotype in the MASP-1/-3 double-
deficient mouse line, which is associated with low to
undetectable AP functional activity [32].
The absence of a protective effect of C4 deficiency
in cerebral IRI confirms the non-protective phenotype
of C4 deficiency previously reported in models of
myocardial and renal IRI and emphasizes the general
importance of a MASP-2-dependent C4-bypass activa-
tion route [20, 22, 26].
Conclusions
This work demonstrates the pivotal role of the LP effector
enzyme MASP-2 in driving tissue injury and unfavorable
outcomes in mouse models of ischemic brain ischemia
and the utility of inhibitory therapeutic antibodies against
this enzyme in reducing IRI-mediated tissue and organ
function loss.
