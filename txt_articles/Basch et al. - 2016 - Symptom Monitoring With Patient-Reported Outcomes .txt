Purpose
There is growing interest to enhance symptom monitoring during routine cancer care using patient-
reported outcomes, but evidence of impact on clinical outcomes is limited.
Methods
We randomly assigned patients receiving routine outpatient chemotherapy for advanced solid
tumors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to report 12 common symptoms via tablet
computers or to receive usual care consisting of symptom monitoring at the discretion of clinicians.
Those with home computers received weekly e-mail prompts to report between visits. Treating
physicians received symptom printouts at visits, and nurses received e-mail alerts when participants
reported severe or worsening symptoms. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality
of life (HRQL) at 6 months compared with baseline, measured by the EuroQol EQ-5D Index.
Secondary endpoints included emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and survival.
Results
Among 766 patients allocated, HRQL improved among more participants in the intervention group
than usual care (34% v 18%) and worsened among fewer (38% v 53%; P , .001). Overall, mean
HRQL declined by less in the intervention group than usual care (1.4- v 7.1-point drop; P , .001).
Patients receiving intervention were less frequently admitted to the ER (34% v 41%; P = .02) or
hospitalized (45% v 49%; P = .08) and remained on chemotherapy longer (mean, 8.2 v 6.3 months;
P = .002). Although 75% of the intervention group was alive at 1 year, 69% with usual care survived
the year (P = .05), with differences also seen in quality-adjusted survival (mean of 8.7 v. 8.0 months;
P = .004). Benefits were greater for participants lacking prior computer experience. Most patients
receiving intervention (63%) reported severe symptoms during the study. Nurses frequently ini-
tiated clinical actions in response to e-mail alerts.
Conclusion
Clinical benefits were associated with symptom self-reporting during cancer care.

INTRODUCTION
Symptoms are common among patients receiving
treatment of advanced cancers1,2 and often go
undetected.3-6 Systematic collection of symptom
information using patient-reported outcome
(PRO) standardized questionnaires has been
suggested as an approach to improve symptom
control.7,8 Several web-based systems exist9,10
and have been shown to prompt clinicians to
intensify symptom management,11-13 to improve
symptom control,11,13-15 and to enhance patient-
clinician communication, patient satisfaction,
and well-being.16-22 Most patients are willing
and able to self-report via the web, even close to
the end of life.23
The effects of symptom self-reporting on
clinical outcomes are not established, leaving
open the question of whether the benefits of
systems to elicit PRO self-reports outweigh their
added cost and burden.9,16,17 Symptoms precip-
itate emergency room (ER) visits and hospital
admissions,24 but it is not known if such visits are
potentially avoidable through improved prospective
monitoring. Several symptoms are associated with

 worse survival in advanced cancer and lead to functional impairment
and deconditioning.25 Therefore, improved symptom control may
improve survival. To address these questions, we conducted a single-
center randomized controlled trial to test whether systematic web-
based collection of patient-reported symptoms during chemotherapy
treatment, with automated alerts to clinicians for severe or worsening
symptoms, improves health-related quality of life (HRQL) as well as
survival, quality-adjusted survival, ER use, and hospitalization.
METHODS
Trial Design and Participants
Patients initiating chemotherapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSK) in New York for metastatic breast, genitourinary, gyne-
cologic, or lung cancers were enrolled in a nonblinded, randomized,
controlled trial of web-based self-reporting of symptoms, compared with
usual care. The study protocol was approved by the MSK institutional
review board and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00578006).
Patients were eligible if they planned to receive chemotherapy at MSK
and could read English. Patients were ineligible if they were participating in
an investigational treatment, because such studies stipulate structured
symptom reporting. The included tumor types were selected because they
represent a spectrum of symptoms related to cancer and treatment;
metastatic disease was specified because treatment is often continuous and
symptoms are common.1 All participants provided written informed
consent. Randomization was conducted by the institutional Biostatics
Service via a computer system using randomly permutated blocks. Par-
ticipants remained on study until discontinuation of cancer treatment,
voluntary withdrawal, or death.
Preplanned Subgroups
Before randomization, participants were assigned to one of two
subgroups based on level of prior computer and e-mail use. Those with
regular access to a computer and e-mail use at least weekly were assigned to
a computer-experienced subgroup; the remainder were assigned to a
computer-inexperienced subgroup. This approach was based on evidence
that patients with computer experience are more receptive to electronic
self-reporting than those with less computer experience.26 The patients in
each subgroup were independently allocated to self-reporting versus usual
care (1:1 in the computer-experienced subgroup and enriched at 2:1 in the
computer-inexperienced subgroup, to enable an assessment of the logistics
of obtaining PROs in this group as a part of a parallel feasibility study).
Intervention
Self-reporting was conducted via STAR (Symptom Tracking and
Reporting), a web-based interface previously established as easy to use for
patients with cancer with high symptom burdens.20,27-29 STAR includes
questions adapted for patient use from the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,26,27 pertaining to 12
common symptoms experienced during chemotherapy1,30: appetite loss,
constipation, cough, diarrhea, dyspnea, dysuria, fatigue, hot flashes,
nausea, pain, neuropathy, and vomiting. These symptoms are graded on a
five-point scale from 0 (not present) to 4 (disabling) based on clinical
criteria.31 STAR did not allow skipped questions or free-text responses.
At enrollment, nonclinical study staff trained participants to use
STAR and facilitated completion of a baseline self-report. At subsequent
medical oncology or infusion suite visits, study staff invited participants
to self-report either via wireless touchscreen tablet computers or free-
standing computer kiosks. Participants in the computer-inexperienced
subgroup were asked to self-report using STAR only at clinic visits.
Participants in the computer-experienced subgroup were given remote
access to STAR, with a weekly e-mail reminder encouraging but not
requiring a between-visit report.
STAR triggered e-mail alerts to nurses whenever a patient-reported
symptom worsened by $ 2 points or reached an absolute grade $ 3. The
system informed participants that e-mails are not generally monitored after
business hours, and participants were therefore encouraged to call the office
at such times for symptoms of concern. A report tracking participants’
symptoms20,23,26 was printed at each clinic visit for both the nurse and
treating oncologist. No specific guidance was provided to clinicians about
what actions to take in response to alerts or printed symptom profiles.
Usual Care
Usual care for both the computer-experienced and computer-
inexperienced subgroups consisted of the standard procedure at MSK
for monitoring and documenting symptoms, which is typical of medical
oncology practice and was identical for both subgroups.5,20 Symptoms are
discussed and documented in the medical record during clinical
encounters between patients and their oncologists. Patients are encouraged
to initiate telephone contact between visits for concerning symptoms.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was change in HRQL at 6 months from
baseline, measured via the EuroQol EQ-5D Index.32 The EQ-5D Index is a
five-item questionnaire (measuring mobility, self-care, usual activities,
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that produces a composite score
between 0 and 1 (multiplied by 100 to yield a result between 0-100)
representing general health status, normalized for the US population.33,34
Lower scores represent worse HRQL. A score change of 6 points on the 0 to
100 scale is considered clinically meaningful in US cancer populations.35
The EQ-5D was administered via paper at clinic visits every 12 6 4 weeks
throughout study participation, with an understanding that in the routine
care setting, clinic visit intervals vary between patients.
Survival at 1 year was tabulated based on medical records and
Social Security Death Index data. Quality-adjusted survival was eval-
uated by multiplying EQ-5D scores by survival time for each patient.36
Time to first ER visit and time to first hospitalization at MSKwere based
on admissions data in the medical record. Time receiving active cancer
treatment was abstracted from medical charts. The number of nursing
calls to patients was tabulated based on nursing logs in the medical
record.
Adherence with STAR self-reporting was assessed by calculating the
proportion of participants completing questionnaires at each successive
visit. For computer-inexperienced participants to be considered adherent
at a given visit, a self-report must have been completed at the time of that
visit. For computer-experienced participants to be adherent at a given visit,
a STAR report had to be completed remotely within 72 hours. Nurses used
a standardized form to record if and what clinical actions were taken in
response to e-mail alerts.
Statistical Analysis
The study was designed to accommodate combined and separate
analyses of the computer-experienced and computer-inexperienced sub-
groups. Based on prior work,28 it was projected that 30% to 40% of
participants would fall in the inexperienced category. The experienced
subgroup was randomized 1:1 and the inexperienced was randomized 2:1,
to facilitate focus on the feasibility of obtaining PROs in this group. The
study planned to enroll until 225 patients were allocated within the smaller
inexperienced subgroup (150 assigned to STAR and 75 to usual care). With
225 participants in the inexperienced subgroup, there was 80% power to
detect an effect size of 0.40 in mean EQ-5D index change from baseline
between arms using a t test with a two-sided a of 0.05.
For the primary quality-of-life analysis, EQ-5D index scores for
participants in each study arm were calculated at 6 months and compared
with baseline scores, excluding those who did not complete any post-
baseline EQ-5D questionnaire and using the last postbaseline observation
carried forward when available for patients without 6-month data. The
proportion of patients in each arm who experienced improved,

 unchanged, or worsened scores from baseline was compared using
Fisher’s exact test. This analysis was conducted both for any level of
change from baseline and for a 6-point change from baseline, which is
considered as clinically meaningful.34 Mean score changes from baseline
were compared using two group t tests. A multivariable linear regression
model, with change score as the dependent variable, adjusted for
covariates including age, sex, cancer type, race, and education level.
Multiple sensitivity imputation analyses were conducted including last
observation carried forward but including baseline observations for
patients with no postbaseline EQ-5D score, no observations carried
forward, minimum observation values carried forward, average obser-
vation values carried forward, and last observation carried forward but
assigning an EQ-5D value of zero if death occurred before 6 months. For
each method, analyses were conducted separately for the whole group
and for the subgroups based on computer experience.
For ER and hospitalization endpoints, cumulative incidence func-
tions were calculated with death treated as a competing event.37 Competing
risk regression was used to model risk with and without adjustment for
baseline covariates.
Comparisons of the percentage of patients alive at 1 year were made
using logistic regression, adjusting for baseline covariates, because com-
plete survival data were available for all patients. For the quality-adjusted
survival analysis, participants’ average EQ-5D scores were multiplied by
survival times for each EQ-5D reporting interval during the initial year of
enrollment; these values were summed to yield a total number of quality-
adjusted life months for that patient during that year.35 Participants with
missing baseline EQ-5D scores were excluded. Mean quality-adjusted life
months were compared between arms in each cohort, using two group t
tests. A multivariable linear regression model was used to adjust for the
baseline covariates in Table 1.
Two-sided P values of less than .05 were considered to indicate
statistical significance.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Between September 14, 2007 and January 6, 2011, 1,007
subjects were identified as potentially eligible and approached to
participate. Of these, 154 were found to be ineligible, and 87
declined. The remaining 766 subjects were enrolled and randomly
assigned,
including
227
computer-inexperienced
and
539
computer-experienced participants (Fig 1). Mean time on study
was 7.4 months and median time was 3.7 months (range, 0.25 to
49), with a mean of 16 clinic visits per patient (range, 1 to 114).
Baseline characteristics were balanced between randomi-
zation arms in both the computer-experienced and -inexperienced
subgroups
(Table
1).
Computer-inexperienced
participants
were significantly older, more often men, more often black,
and less educated than computer-experienced participants (all
P , .001).
Quality of Life
HRQL scores improved by any amount from baseline to
6 months among more participants in the STAR arm than in the
usual care arm (34% v 18%) and worsened among fewer (38% v
53%; P , .001; Fig 2; Data Supplement). Similarly, more par-
ticipants in the STAR arm experienced an improvement in
HRQL by the previously established clinically meaningful score
change threshold of $ 6 points34 compared with usual care (21%
v 11%), and fewer experienced a $ 6-point worsening (28% v

 37%; P = .001). Mean HRQL scores declined by less in the intervention
arm compared with usual care (1.4- v 7.1-point drop; P , .001;
Table 2). Although effect sizes were the same in the two subgroups
(0.38), results were statistically significant in the computer-
experienced subgroup (P , .001) but did not reach statistical
significance in the relatively smaller computer-inexperienced
subgroup (P = .06). Notably, 230 patients (30% of participants)
died or discontinued cancer treatment before completing a follow-
up HRQL questionnaire. In a sensitivity analysis that included
these individuals by carrying forward their baseline HRQL values,
results were similar; results were also robust across multiple
additional sensitivity analyses (Data Supplement). In an analysis
of the EQ-5D’s subdomains, three were statistically significantly
better with STAR compared with usual care at 6 months
compared with baseline, including Mobility (P = .02), Self-Care
(P = .01), and Anxiety/Depression (P = .01), but did not reach
significance for Pain/Discomfort (P = .05) or Usual Activities
(P = .09).

Fig 2. Proportion of patients with health-related
quality-of-life changes at 6 months compared with

arm was tabulated for which EuroQol EQ-5D Index
scores improved, remained unchanged, or worsened
by any amount at 6 months compared with baseline.
This analysis was repeated using a threshold for
change of six or more points, an amount considered
to be clinically meaningful in US cancer populations.
Results are shown (A) for all participants, and sep-
arately for (B) the computer-experienced subgroup,
and (C) the computer-inexperienced subgroup. Analy-
ses included only patients with available baseline and

using Fisher’s exact test comparing study arms based
on the three categories of comparison (improved,
unchanged, worsened). STAR, Symptom Tracking

Symptom Monitoring With Patient-Reported Outcomes
 ER Visits, Hospitalization, Cancer Treatment
Fewer participants in the STAR arm visited the ER compared
with usual care (34% v 41% at 1 year; P = .02; Fig 3). These
differences
appeared
more
pronounced
in
the
computer-
inexperienced subgroup (34% v 56%; P = .02) than in the
computer-experienced subgroup (34% v 36%; P = .16). A similar
trend was seen in the proportion of patients hospitalized at 1 year
for the overall study population (45% v 49%; P = .08), again more
pronounced and significant in the computer-inexperienced sub-
group (44% v 63%; P = .003) but not in the computer-experienced
subgroup (46% v 45%; P = .75; Data Supplement). Patients in the
STAR arm received active chemotherapy treatment for significantly
longer than usual care during the study, with a mean of 8.2 months
(range, 0 to 49 months) versus 6.3 months (range, 0 to 41 months),
respectively (P = .002), and a median of 4.1 months versus
3.5 months, respectively (P = .002).
Overall and Quality-Adjusted Survival
At 1 year, 69% of patients were alive in the usual-care arm
compared with 75% with STAR, a difference of 6% (P = .05; Table 3).
This difference was more pronounced among computer-inexperienced
participants (60% vs. 74%; P = .02), with a trend seen among
computer-experienced participants (71% v 76%; P = .45).
Significant differences in quality-adjusted survival were observed
during this 1-year period for all patients (mean of 8.0 v 8.7 months;
P = .004) and were statistically significant in both subgroups.
Symptom Reporting and Nurse Responses to E-mail
Alerts
On average, 73% of participants assigned to the intervention
arm completed a self-report at any given clinic visit (Data
Supplement). A total of 84,212 individual symptoms were self-
reported during the study. Among these, 1,431 or 1.7% were severe
or disabling (grade 3 or 4), reported by 277 of the 441 (63%)
intervention arm participants. The most common severe or dis-
abling patient-reported symptoms were fatigue, pain, anorexia,
dyspnea, neuropathy, and nausea. Nursing interventions taken in
direct response to e-mail alerts included telephone counseling
about symptom management (in response to 77% of alerts),
supportive medication initiation/change (12%), referral to the ER/
hospital (8%), chemotherapy dose modification (2%), and
imaging/test orders (2%). No difference in the number of nursing
calls to patients during participation was detected, with a mean of
12.8 in the STAR group vs. 12.9 in the control group (P = .93).
DISCUSSION
For adults receiving outpatient chemotherapy for advanced cancer
at a large specialty cancer center, web-based symptom reporting
with automated clinician e-mail alerts resulted in better HRQL,
fewer ER visits, fewer hospitalizations, a longer duration of pal-
liative chemotherapy, and superior quality-adjusted survival.
Although the vast majority of patient-reported symptoms
were grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate), more than 1,400 were grade
3 or 4 (severe to disabling). In response to e-mail alerts for severe or
worsening symptoms, nurses performed direct interventions
primarily composed of telephone counseling, medication changes,
and ER or hospital referral. Clinical actions may also have been
taken in response to symptom reports delivered to clinicians at
each office visit including responses to mild/moderate symptoms,
although these were not systematically tracked and may be a useful
focus of future research.
Prior studies have explored mechanisms by which patient
reporting of symptoms may confer clinical benefits, with findings
including increased rates of symptom discussions between
patients and clinicians,11,18,19 intensified symptom management by

 clinicians in response to patient reports,11-13 and improved
symptom
control
when
patient
reports
are
shared
with
clincians.11-14,18 As such, systematic patient reporting appears to
enhance clinician awareness and can augment existing mechanisms
for symptom management during routine oncology care. Con-
versely, when undetected in the absence of patient self-reporting,
symptoms may continue to worsen and cause serious complica-
tions, lead to hospital visits, limit the ability to safely deliver
chemotherapy, and diminish outcomes, as observed in this study.
This randomized trial should be interpreted in the context of
three key limitations. First, it was conducted at a single, urban
tertiary care cancer center limiting generalizability. However,
inclusion of a computer-inexperienced subgroup, with 39% having
no education beyond high school, suggests its applicability to
diverse US cancer populations. The study included only English
speakers; future assessments should include additional languages
and nontext interfaces, such as interactive voice response. ER and
hospital admissions regardless of primary site were tracked based
on the institution’s electronic medical record system. However,
some admissions to outside institutions may not have been
recorded.
Second, we chose to use the EQ-5D assessment of overall
HRQL rather than more granular questionnaires that evaluate
particular symptoms in detail. We selected this approach to avoid
conflating the intervention with the outcome metric and to enable
calculation of quality-adjusted survival. As a result, we have limited
information about which symptoms were best addressed by
symptom reporting. Despite the generic nature of the EQ-5D
measure, significant and clinically meaningful differences were
observed between study arms.
Third, substantial numbers of participants did not have 6-
month HRQL data available because they had died or discontinued
treatment. The survival and utilization endpoints would not be
affected by these missing data, and HRQL results were similar in
multiple sensitivity analyses. Moreover, missing HRQL would be
more likely expected to attenuate detection of potential benefits of
PRO reporting because of informative censoring of scores when
patients died or discontinued treatment earlier in the usual care
arm who otherwise might have reported low HRQL scores.38
Nonetheless, earlier or more frequent systematic outcomes data
collection is warranted for future assessments. The study design did
not anticipate the observed level of attrition in the accrual plan.
Some benefits appeared greater for computer-inexperienced
patients, who were overall older, frailer, and more symptomatic
than computer-experienced patients. Participants lacking com-
puter experience may have less-developed health communication
skills and thereby benefit more from a structured program for
eliciting symptoms. Future work is warranted to discern which
patient populations may benefit most from this type of health
communication intervention.
A formal cost-utility analysis was not performed. Resource use
was relatively modest and included software development, server
space and maintenance, eight tablet computers, and time spent by
patients and clinicians to report and review symptoms and to
respond when they were severe or worsening. The software did not
provide recommendations to patients or clinicians about man-
agement of detected symptoms, which could be added in future
systems.

Symptom Monitoring With Patient-Reported Outcomes
 In the context of a changing health care delivery system where
both population management and patient centeredness are pri-
oritized, symptom self-reporting engages patients as active par-
ticipants and may improve the experience, efficiency, and
outcomes of care. Given the favorable outcomes we have dem-
onstrated with a simple prototype, further work to refine optimal
strategies for engaging both patients and clinicians in harnessing
technology to improve care should be a priority.
