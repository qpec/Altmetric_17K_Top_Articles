Radioimmunotherapy of solid tumors using antibody-targeted
radionuclides has been limited by low therapeutic indices (TIs).
We recently reported a novel 3-step pretargeted radioimmunother-
apy (PRIT) strategy based on a glycoprotein A33 (GPA33)–targeting
bispecific antibody and a small-molecule radioactive hapten, a
complex of 177Lu and S-2-(4-aminobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo-
dodecane tetraacetic acid (177Lu-DOTA-Bn), that leads to high TIs for
radiosensitive tissues such as blood (TI 5 73) and kidney (TI 5 12).
We tested our hypothesis that a fractionated anti-GPA33 DOTA-
PRIT regimen calibrated to deliver a radiation absorbed dose to
tumor of more than 100 Gy would lead to a high probability of tumor
cure while being well tolerated by nude mice bearing subcutaneous
GPA33-positive SW1222 xenografts. Methods: We treated groups
of nude mice bearing 7-d-old SW1222 xenografts with a fraction-
ated 3-cycle anti-GPA33 DOTA-PRIT regimen (total administered
177Lu-DOTA-Bn activity, 167 MBq/mouse; estimated radiation
absorbed dose to tumor, 110 Gy). In randomly selected mice un-
dergoing treatment, serial SPECT/CT imaging was used to monitor
treatment response and calculate radiation absorbed doses to
tumor. Necropsy was done on surviving animals 100–200 d after
treatment to determine frequency of cure and assess select normal
tissues for treatment-related histopathologies. Results: Rapid ex-
ponential tumor progression was observed in control treatment
groups (i.e., no treatment or 177Lu-DOTA-Bn only), leading to eutha-
nasia due to excessive tumor burden, whereas 10 of 10 complete
responses were observed for the DOTA-PRIT–treated animals
within 30 d. Treatment was well tolerated, and 100% histologic cure
was achieved in 9 of 9 assessable animals without detectable radi-
ation damage to critical organs, including bone marrow and kidney.
Radiation absorbed doses to tumor derived from SPECT/CT (102
Gy) and from biodistribution (110 Gy) agreed to within 6.9%. Of the
total dose of approximately 100 Gy, the first dose contributes 30%,
the second dose 60%, and the third dose 10%. Conclusion: In a
GPA33-positive human colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model,
we validated a SPECT/CT-based theranostic PRIT regimen that led
to 100% complete responses and 100% cures without any treatment-
related toxicities, based on high TIs for radiosensitive tissues. These
studies support the view that anti-GPA33 DOTA-PRIT will be a potent
radioimmunotherapy regimen for GPA33-positive colorectal cancer
tumors in humans.

Radioimmunotherapy has been investigated for decades as a
promising therapeutic strategy for selective targeting of ionizing
radioisotopes to liquid and solid tumors in humans (1). Few suc-
cesses in safely and effectively treating tumors by this approach
have been achieved in solid tumors (1). An effective radioimmuno-
therapy approach would address a major unmet need, especially for
patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), a cancer
with a 5-y survival of only 11%. Unfortunately, numerous clinical
investigations of radioimmunotherapy against CRC-associated an-
tigens have yielded limited clinical benefit, irrespective of radioiso-
tope used (1). The main hurdle observed was insufficient radiation
delivery to tumor at radioimmunotherapy activities compatible with body
tolerance. Maximal treatment benefits reported thus far using radioim-
munotherapy with whole IgG have been stabilized tumor growth in
a minority of treated patients, and calculated radiation-absorbed doses
have been relatively low; for example, the use of 131I-huA33 to target
GPA33 in CRC resulted in modest tumor doses ranging from 12 to
33 Gy at the maximum tolerated dose of 1,480 MBq/m2, without cure
in small tumors, and with a corresponding mean red marrow–absorbed
dose of approximately 122 cGy (therapeutic index [TI] 5 ;16) (2,3).
TI in radioimmunotherapy can be greatly improved using a
multistep method, such as the pretargeting approach, based on the
discovery of Reardan, et al., that antibodies could be developed
against metal chelates (4). This allowed for the separation of
the antibody-based tumor-targeting step from the radioactive

 small molecular hapten component. Additional improvements in
targeting to tumor were achieved by modifications, such as the use
of streptavidin by Axworthy et al. (5). However, these ultimately
failed based on serious practical drawbacks related to immunoge-
nicity of reagents and low TI (1).
In response to these limitations, Orcutt et al. used mathe-
matic modeling to estimate that a hapten-binding antibody
must have an affinity of less than 100 pM for efficient delivery

(PRIT) (6) and developed a novel PRIT approach called
DOTA-PRIT (Fig. 1). The primary features include that the
modular bispecific antibody format (IgG-scFv) offers multiva-
lent and simultaneous antibody binding of 2 distinct antigens:
a tumor antigen and the pM affinity anti-DOTA hapten anti-
body fragment C825 that recognizes small radioactive yttrium-
or lutetium-chelate complexes of DOTA-Bn (6); and the use
of radio-haptens (e.g., 177Lu-DOTA-Bn) with almost exclu-
sive renal clearance and with negligible retention in normal
tissue (7)).
The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and
toxicity of a 3-cycle fractionated DOTA-PRIT regimen capable of
delivering an absorbed dose of more than 100 Gy to subcutaneous
human CRC tumor xenografts. We report our results with 177Lu,
a theranostic isotope that enables noninvasive treatment moni-
toring and dosimetry in combination with therapeutic b-emission
(half-life 5 6.7 d; maximum energy of the primary [78.6%]
b-emission from
177Lu 5 0.5 MeV; average energy of the
primary b-emission from 177Lu 5 0.13 MeV; maximum range 5
1.5 mm). The g-emissions of 177Lu (208 and 113 keV, with 10%
and 6% abundance, respectively) enable direct quantitative thera-
nostic SPECT imaging during treatment. A subaim was to validate
the SPECT imaging component of DOTA-PRIT for direct tumor
dosimetry, on a treatment cycle–specific basis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and General Procedures
The anti-GPA33 DOTA-PRIT bispecific antibody huA33-C825
(210 kDa) was expressed and purified as described by Cheal et al.
(8). A treatment cycle of anti-GPA33 DOTA-PRIT consisted of 3
separate intravenous injections via the tail vein: 0.25 mg of huA33-
C825 at 228 h, then 62.5 mg of clearing agent at 24 h, and 55 MBq of
177Lu-DOTA-Bn at 0 (8). The GPA33-postive human CRC cell line
SW1222 was obtained from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Immu-
notherapy and grown by serial passage. All animal experiments were
done in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,
following National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal welfare.
Technical details regarding cell culture and animal models were pre-
viously described by Cheal et al. (8).
DOTA-PRIT Regimen
Mice bearing subcutaneous SW1222 xenografts (30–170 mm3, 7 d
after inoculation) with either no treatment (n 5 5; tumor volume 5
114 6 35 mm3), 177Lu-DOTA-Bn only (n 5 5; tumor volume 5 128 6
34 mm3; 2 cycles, total administered 177Lu-DOTA-Bn activity: 110
MBq), or a 3-cycle DOTA-PRIT regimen consisting of anti-GPA33
PRIT 1 55.5 MBq of 177Lu-DOTA-Bn (n 5 10; tumor volume 5 83 6
38 mm3; total administered 177Lu-DOTA-Bn activity/mouse: 167 MBq)
were studied. For DOTA-PRIT, cycle 1 was given on days 7 and 8 after
tumor inoculation. This was repeated 6 d later (i.e., weekly), with cycle
2 given on days 14 and 15 and cycle 3 given on days 21 and 22. All
groups were monitored 2–3 times per week for overall health, body
weight, and measurement of tumor burden by external caliper, with
tumor volume calculated using the volume of an ellipsoid. Mice were
sacrificed when the tumor volume exceeded 2,500 mm3 (or earlier if the
tumor burden interfered with mobility), or if excessive weight loss
(.25%) from pretreatment baseline was noted. Tumor growth was
analyzed by performing a nonlinear regression fit of an exponential
growth curve to the tumor volume data collected in the first 21 d after
tumor inoculation for the nontreated and treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-Bn–
only groups. The tumor growth data of the animals treated with the 3-cycle
DOTA-PRIT regimen were fitted by an initial exponential growth curve up
to and including day 14 (i.e., onset time of growth delay and shrinkage)
using GraphPad Prism (version 6.00).
Monitoring of DOTA-PRIT with SPECT/CT
All SPECT/CT scans were obtained using a dedicated small-animal
scanner (NanoSPECT/CT; Bioscan) with an animal palette heated to
37�C. Animals were anesthetized during scanning using a mixture of
1.5%–2% isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare) and oxygen gas. A CT topo-
gram was acquired first, followed by a 360� small-animal SPECT
using a 4-head g-camera with pinhole collimators (1.4 mm). The
SPECT scan time was adjusted for each mouse to record approxi-
mately 30,000 counts minimum per frame (20–55 min). Bioscan
HiSPECT software was used for iterative image reconstruction and
fusion of CT and SPECT images.
Five of ten of the animals undergoing DOTA-PRIT were randomly
selected for serial noninvasive SPECT/CT imaging for verification of
tumor targeting and calculation of tumor dosimetry. Because of the
length of time required for each scan (30–40 min per mouse), the
imaging field of view was limited to the caudal half of the animal
(midline to tail). Each animal was imaged 5–6 times at various time
points during fractionated treatment, up to 24 h after injection of cycle 3
with 177Lu-DOTA-Bn (day 23) (Fig. 2). For each image, tumor volumes
were estimated by CT image analysis, and the total activity in the tumor
region was estimated by SPECT image analysis. Tumor count rates
were converted to activity concentrations (MBq per mm3 or gram [g])
using the measured system calibration factor for 177Lu.
To determine whether partial-volume correction would be necessary,
a phantom consisting of 4 fillable spheres with diameters of 5.8, 7.8,
9.9, and 12.4 mm was imaged on the SPECT/CT with a solution of
177Lu having a nominal concentration of 3.7 MBq (0.1 mCi)/mL.
Regions of interest were drawn on the coregistered CT images and
activity within the spheres measured in the reconstructed SPECT im-
ages. A diameter-dependent recovery curve was fitted and compared
with the CT-measured tumor sizes. A partial-volume effect was not
observed in the phantom SPECT images above a size of approximately
200 mm3. For the measured tumor sizes, we estimated a minimum re-
covery coefficient of 0.86 for cycle 1 and 0.71 for cycle 3. Because most
tumor sizes were greater than about 200 mm3 for the duration of the
experiment, we did not apply a partial-volume correction to the results.
SPECT Dosimetry
177Lu-DOTA-Bn activity concentration was measured by SPECT/CT
imaging of the SW1222 xenograft mice. Activity concentrations
as a function of time without decay correction for cycles 1 and 2
were fit to a single exponential. The apparent half-life for this
exponential therefore incorporated both physical and biologic
decay effects.
Durational cumulated activity was calculated for each cycle from
0 to 160 h after the start of cycle. Durational cumulated activity for
cycle 2 therefore includes residual activity from cycle 1. Activity for
cycle 3 was extrapolated by assuming an exponential with the same
effective half-life as cycle 2. This assumption is based on the fact that
cycle 3 should behave similarly to cycle 2 as both start while there is
residual activity still present from the previous treatment cycle. Total

 cumulated activities were also calculated for each cycle from the
start of the multicycle protocol, assuming no further treatment and
complete elimination of the tumor at 496 h after injection of 177Lu
activity in cycle 1. Total cumulated activity for cycle 1 represents
dose delivered from 1 injection from 0 to 496 hours after injection.
Total cumulated activity for cycle 2 represents dose delivered from the
first and second injections (but not the third) assuming the same rate of
decay for cycle 2 to 496 h.
Tumor time–activity curves were also simulated for the 3-cycle
treatment regimen. Curve parameters from the exponential fit to the
first cycle of each subject were used to generate the corresponding
second and third cycle curves. Residual activity from each previous
cycle was taken into account in the initial activity at the beginning of
each cycle. Elimination of radiolabel was assumed to proceed at the
same exponential rate as for the first cycle. Mean tumor-absorbed
doses were calculated as the product of the cumulated activities thus
determined and the average energy emitted per decay of 177Lu in the
form of b-particles, assuming complete local absorption of the
b-particles and ignoring the dose contribution of the much more
penetrating g-rays.
Necropsy of Animals That Underwent DOTA-PRIT
Mice were euthanized with CO2 according to the guidelines of
the American Veterinary Medical Association. After gross exami-
nation, organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. After
fixation, bones were decalcified in a formic acid solution (Surgipath
Decalcifier I; Leica Biosystems). Fixed organs were further pro-
cessed for histology in ethanol and xylene in a Leica ASP6025
tissue processor and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were
sectioned at 5 mm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and exam-
ined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. The following tis-
sues were examined: skin and subcutaneous tissue from tumor
implantation site, liver, kidney, spleen, and bone marrow (sternum,
vertebrae, femur, and tibia). Any abnormal
gross or histologic findings were noted.
Hematology and Serum Chemistry
For hematology, blood was collected into
tubes containing EDTA. Automated analy-
sis was performed by the LCP on an
IDEXX Procyte DX hematology analyzer,
and the following parameters were deter-
mined: white blood cell count, red blood
cell count, hemoglobin concentration, he-
matocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean
corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular
hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell
distribution width standard deviation and
coefficient
of
variance,
platelet
count,
platelet distribution width, mean platelet
volume, and relative and absolute counts
of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,
eosinophils, basophils, and reticulocytes.
For serum chemistry, blood was collected
into tubes containing a serum separator and
then centrifuged to obtain serum for analysis.
Serum chemistry was performed by the LCP
on a Beckman Coulter AU680 analyzer for
the following parameters: alkaline phosphatase
concentration, alanine aminotransferase concen-
tration, aspartate aminotransferase concentration,
creatine kinase concentration, gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase concentration, albumin concentra-
tion, total protein concentration, globulin con-
centration, albumin/globulin ratio, total bilirubin concentration, blood urea
nitrogen concentration, creatinine concentration, cholesterol con-
centration, triglycerides concentration, glucose concentration, calcium
concentration, phosphorus concentration, chloride concentration,
potassium concentration (K), sodium concentration (Na), Na/K ratio.
Statistical Analysis
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis or statistical comparisons between
groups (Student t test) were performed with Prism software (ver-
sion 6.0; GraphPad Software). For all studies, the level of statistical
significance is set at a P level of less than 0.05.

 over the course of the experiment demonstrated a clear difference
in efficacy between the control treatment groups (i.e., no treatment
or 177Lu-DOTA-Bn only) and the DOTA-PRIT–treated groups.
This is shown in Figure 3A where tumor volumes are plotted as
a function of time after xenograft inoculation for all treatment
groups.
Kaplan–Meier plots (Fig. 3B) were generated for all 3 groups.
Development of a 1,000 mm3 tumor volume that necessitated
euthanasia due to excessive tumor burden was designated as the
survival endpoint. All untreated mice and mice treated with 177Lu-
DOTA-Bn only (10/10, 100%) developed large, exponentially
growing tumors, requiring euthanasia of the animals. Individual
tumor doubling times ranged from 3.6 to 6.0 d (R2 5 0.90–0.99).
Because of this rapid tumor growth, treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-Bn
only was limited to just 2 cycles. The median time to a terminal
1,000 mm3 tumor volume was 19 d for no treatment and 16 d for
treatment with 2 cycles of 177Lu-DOTA-Bn only. For all DOTA-
PRIT–treated mice (10/10, 100%), the tumors grew exponentially
to a maximum size of 247–386 mm3 on day 14 (tumor doubling
time range, 2.2–5.1 d; R2 5 0.82–0.99). After the third cycle of
treatment (administered on days 21 and 22, after tumor inocula-
tion), tumors showed rapid regression to below the palpable
threshold (#10 mm3) by approximately day 30 (Fig. 3A). Tumor
volumes at the start of cycles 2 and 3 were 298 6 51 mm3 and
31 6 19 mm3, respectively, measured manually by caliper. For
the DOTA-PRIT–treated mice, median time to the terminal
1,000 mm3 tumor burden was never reached because all animals
(10/10) showed complete responses with no recurrence before
study endpoints (118–200 d after inoculation). By log-rank
(Mantel–Cox) test, survival of the DOTA-PRIT group was
significant (P , 0.0001).
SPECT/CT Imaging to Monitor Treatment and Quantify
Tumoricidal Tumor Doses
SPECT/CT of tumor-bearing mice undergoing treatment demon-
strated highly selective tumor localization of pretargeted 177Lu-
DOTA-Bn as early as 1 h after injection of 177Lu-DOTA-Bn. At this
time, the average effective 177Lu activity concentration in tumors (as
average MBq/g 6 SD; n 5 4) was 3.92 6 0.85 MBq/g, correspond-
ing to an uptake of injected 177Lu-DOTA-Bn of 7.1% 6 1.5% per g
of tumor volume. Prolonged and high tumor retention of 177Lu ac-
tivity was also observed at 24 and 160 h after injection (non–decay-
corrected activities, 3.17 6 1.10 and 0.64 6 0.19 MBq/g),
suggesting minimal biologic clearance of 177Lu activity from the
tumor. Activity in the bladder region is apparent in the SPECT
images at 1 h after injection, consistent with renal clearance of free
177Lu-DOTA-Bn (data not shown). Rapid renal clearance of free
177Lu-DOTA-Bn was also supported by the observation that
whole-body activity of each individual animal, determined by assay
in a dose calibrator, was similar to the measured tumor-associated
activity. 177Lu activity remaining in the mice measured after 24
and 160 h after injection of cycle 1 (as average 6 SD; n 5 5)
was 6.98% 6 1.64% and 1.18% 6 0.39% of administered activity,
respectively. Although the SPECT/CT imaging demonstrates that the
most prominent focus of activity was in the tumor, low levels of
177Lu activity were detected in the liver, spleen, and kidney (;10- to
15-fold-less activity than tumor, as percentage injected dose per
gram of tissue, based on previous biodistribution studies). For
cycle 2, the whole-body percentage of administered 177Lu activity
remaining after 24 and 160 h after injection was 12.83% 6 2.01%
and 1.98% 6 0.44%, respectively. Finally, for cycle 3, the
whole-body percentage of administered 177Lu activity remaining
after 24 h was 4.81% 6 1.03% (no additional data were collected
for cycle 3 after 24 h).
The CT image–derived tumor volumes (in mm3) demonstrating
tumor doubling followed by regression are shown in Table 1.
SPECT image–derived 177Lu activity estimates for tumor regions
of interest are shown in Table 2 and Figure 4. Tumor dosimetry
was calculated from 177Lu time–activity curves and is presented in
Table 3. Representative serial SPECT/CT images originating from
the same animal are provided in Figure 5. The contribution to total
dose was estimated to be greatest during cycle 2 (average dose
during cycle 2 period, 43.8 Gy; n 5 5). The fitted exponential
decay curves of the 3-cycle treatment regimen are shown in Figure
6, illustrating the difference between the measured activity and
expected activity from single and 2-cycle protocols. Total dose
from the 3-cycle treatment was estimated at 102 Gy. Radiation
absorbed doses to tumors derived from SPECT/CT (102 Gy) and
biodistribution (109.6 Gy) agreed to within 6.9%. For comparison,
177Lu activity in the tumor for a 3-cycle treatment was simulated
on the basis of kinetics derived only from the first cycle of the
experimental data. The time–activity curves are shown in Sup-
plemental Figure 1 (supplemental materials are available at
http://jnm.snmjournals.org), with tumor dose estimates calcu-
lated from the curves shown in Supplemental Table 1. Total
tumor dose predicted by the simulation was about 92 Gy, assum-
ing first-cycle kinetics throughout, that is, the kinetics of sub-
sequent cycles essentially ignore the effects of previous cycles.
Measured dose from the 3-cycle treatment was higher than
predicted.

 Toxicity of Fractionated DOTA-PRIT
All treatments were well tolerated, with no average weight loss
greater than 10% from baseline observation (Supplemental Fig. 2),
suggesting no acute toxicity. For DOTA-PRIT–treated mice, a
slight drop in average weight (;5%) from baseline was observed
for the duration of treatment administration, but was reversible to
pretreatment weight about 10 d after the final 177Lu-DOTA-Bn
injection. Weight loss was most likely the result of a transient
and reversible gastrointestinal toxicity, which did not leave per-
manent histologic changes, but formal toxicity studies are war-
ranted to verify this. No early, treatment-related deaths were
observed.
Histopathology confirmed complete tumor disappearance
in all surviving DOTA-PRIT–treated mice (9/9) at 3–6 mo
(96–178 d) after treatment. No evidence of tumors was ob-
served macroscopically or histologically at the site of tumor
inoculation or in distant organs in 9 of 9 mice that underwent
necropsy, consistent with histologic complete cures in those
animals (100%).
We found no evidence of treatment-related radiotoxicity in
radiosensitive organs in treated animals at either 3 or 6 mo after
treatment. For example, in the 5 mice submitted for necropsy and
histopathology assessment at 3 mo after treatment, no abnormal-
ities, such as bone marrow depletion as seen in
177Lu-IgG
radioimmunotherapy (9), nephrotoxicity, or increased incidence
of mesangial glomerulopathy as seen with 177Lu-peptide receptor
radiotherapy (10), were observed.
A variety of histopathologic changes were noted; these are
presented in Supplemental Table 3. Although most of these
findings were compatible with naturally occurring background
lesions typical in mice of this strain and age, 2 lesions observed
with a low incidence were not typical spontaneous lesions.
These 2 lesions, for which a link to test article–induced toxicity
could not be ruled out, were mild to moderate granulomatous
hepatitis or splenitis (2/9 mice) and marked pulmonary inter-
stitial fibrosis (1/9 mice). Sudden deterioration or death was
observed in 2 of 10 treated animals 136 and 158 d after treat-
ment. In 1 animal, this was determined to be due to pulmonary
fibrosis of undetermined cause (as mentioned previously) with
secondary myocardial hypertrophy; the other mouse could not
be analyzed because of the condition of the animal when it was
discovered.
DISCUSSION
We herein report a 3-cycle, curative theranostic regimen with
minimal toxicity for SW1222, a human solid CRC xenograft,

 adenocarcinoma of the colon (classification, Dukes’ stage C,
a locally invasive cancer). There have been extensive preclini-
cal studies with multistep regimens, but the outcome we report,
of a high probability (100%) of histologic cures without detect-
able radiosensitive organ toxicity, is to the best of our knowl-
edge, extremely unusual. Our preclinical development focus
has been on hitting therapeutic benchmarks, which must be
achieved in human translational trials as well. These bench-
marks include, for example, cumulative doses to solid tumor
of more than 100 Gy and TIs for radiosensitive tissues of more
than 12 for the kidneys, 70 for bone marrow, and 40 for colon. We
chose these benchmarks based on clinical human normal-tissue
radiation dose tolerance estimates (11), as well as experience
gleaned from radiopeptide treatments and related toxicities in
humans (1).
In our preliminary studies with anti-GPA33 DOTA-PRIT and
SW1222,
dose
escalation
resulted
in
progressive
tumor
response, and that toxicity was not limiting (8). At lower tumor
doses (;40–70 Gy), treatment led to complete responses
(e.g., we observed 4/4 complete responses for a 2-cycle treat-
ment regimen of 55.5 MBq per cycle) but was ultimately sub-
curative and resulted in 2 distinct recurrence phenotypes:
outgrowth of antigen-positive tumor with the same rate of
growth as controls (seen in 3/4); and a histologic senescence
pattern that resulted in dormant tumor, in which antigen-
expressing cell growth arrested after 1–2 doublings (seen in
1/4; observed at 140 d after injection). It is critical to assess
long-term outcome after radioimmunotherapy, because we and
others (12) have shown that late recurrence can occur in this
model, with relatively high frequency when treatment is sub-
optimal. In this study, we found that repeated dose cycles to
higher tumor doses were required to achieve 100% histologic
cures in 9 of 9 treated animals available for assessment by
necropsy. With the 3-dose regimen, we achieved our targets
and in this CRC model, we obtained cures with minimal tox-
icity (mean TIs for tumor–to–normal tissue were ;73 [blood],
;10 [liver], ;10 [spleen], ;12 [kidney], and ;110 [marrow-
bearing bone (femur)] when 10,000 cGy were delivered to
tumor; Tables 1–3 provide dose estimates).
DOTA-PRIT should provide an ideal theranostic platform
that permits the use of a single radiopharmaceutical entity for
both quantitative imaging and therapy, by simply changing
the amount of radioactivity administered. The use of non-
invasive SPECT has the advantage of providing a tumor
radiation estimate for all 3 doses in the regimen, which is
otherwise impossible to achieve by biodistribution (i.e.,
terminal) studies alone. The absorbed doses to tumor,
10,160 6 141 cGy, were estimated using SPECT. We defined
and derived the dose contribution from each cycle by calcu-
lating the total predicted dose after that cycle and subtracting
what would have been the total dose, had treatment stopped
after
the
previous
cycle.

Tumors were estimated to be below palpation threshold at 496 h after injection of cycle 1, thus having an effective activity
concentration of zero. Cumulated dose for each cycle was calculated as total dose after 496 h after injection of cycle 1,
assuming treatment was stopped at that dose. Therefore, cycle 2 cumulated dose represents expected dose after 496 h from a
treatment comprising only 2 cycles. Dose during the third period was calculated from 320 to 480 h to be comparable in duration
to the other 2 periods. In fact, the period after injection of cycle 3 until complete regression of tumor is slightly longer than the
other 2 cycle periods.

 proportions of the total cumulated dose after 3 treatment
cycles until total regression of the tumor at 496 h are consid-
ered, it turns out that 60% of the dose is from the second
cycle, and cycles 1 (30%) and 3 (10%) contribute smaller
fractions. This result is nonintuitive but is based on dynamic
measured changes in tumor volume expansion, which in turn
is based on CT during cycle-1 treatment, followed by rapid
regression during cycle 2 in particular (Table 1).
As a novel feature of this work, we
determined that the addition of cycle 3
contributed 10% of the total absorbed
dose by tumor, which was essential for
histologic cure of the 9 of 9 tumors
examined
after
treatment.
This
result
may relate to the state of the treated tumor
at the time the third cycle is added. Such
information is crucial for later treatment
planning in the clinic and underscores the
importance of a multiple-cycle treatment
regimen that is closely monitored with
theranostics.
CONCLUSION
This study validated a theranostic cura-
tive radionuclide therapy regimen with no
clear evidence of radiation-induced toxic-
ity in a murine model bearing human CRC
solid-tumor xenografts. We demonstrated
that 3 cycles were required to achieve
tumor doses of more than 100 Gy, and
with TIs of greater than 70 for blood and
greater than 10 for kidney we observed
no
radiation-related
toxicity
despite
high
total
administered
177Lu
activity
(167 MBq/mouse). Cycle-specific tumor
dosimetry was demonstrated using serial
SPECT/CT of animals undergoing treat-
ment. Collectively, these preclinical studies support clinical trans-
lation of anti-GPA33 DOTA-PRIT.
