ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To investigate the relation between exposure to both 
air and noise pollution from road traffic and birth 
weight outcomes.
DESIGN
Retrospective population based cohort study.
SETTING
Greater London and surrounding counties up to the 
M25 motorway (2317 km2), UK, from 2006 to 2010.
PARTICIPANTS
540 365 singleton term live births.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Term low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age 
(SGA) at term, and term birth weight.
RESULTS
Average air pollutant exposures across pregnancy 
were 41 μg/m3 nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 73 μg/m3 
nitrogen oxides (NOx), 14 μg/m3 particulate matter 
with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm (PM2.5), 23 μg/
m3 particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 
μm (PM10), and 32 μg/m3 ozone (O3). Average daytime 
(LAeq,16hr) and night-time (Lnight) road traffic A-weighted 
noise levels were 58 dB and 53 dB respectively. 
Interquartile range increases in NO2, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, 
and source specific PM2.5 from traffic exhaust (PM2.5 traffic 
exhaust) and traffic non-exhaust (brake or tyre wear and 
resuspension) (PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust) were associated with 
2% to 6% increased odds of term LBW, and 1% to 3% 
increased odds of term SGA. Air pollutant associations 
were robust to adjustment for road traffic noise. 
Trends of decreasing birth weight across increasing 
road traffic noise categories were observed, but were 
strongly attenuated when adjusted for primary traffic 
related air pollutants. Only PM2.5 traffic exhaust and PM2.5 
were consistently associated with increased risk of 
term LBW after adjustment for each of the other air 
pollutants. It was estimated that 3% of term LBW 
cases in London are directly attributable to residential 
exposure to PM2.5>13.8 μg/m3during pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that air pollution from road 
traffic in London is adversely affecting fetal growth. 
The results suggest little evidence for an independent 
exposure-response effect of traffic related noise on 
birth weight outcomes.
Introduction
Air pollution is a major public health issue. It has been 
associated with reduced fetal growth,1 through which it 
may have extensive and permanent influences on the life 
course.2 A key contributor to urban ambient pollution 
is road traffic and, critically, vehicle emissions are 
released near people. Urban particulate matter includes 
a large contribution from outside the urban area, and 
locally emitted particles. Close to roads an individual 
would be exposed to more primary exhaust and non-
exhaust (brake or tyre wear and resuspension of road 
dust induced by vehicles) particles. Further away from 
roads an individual would be exposed to more nitrate 
and secondary organic aerosol as a proportion of their 
total particulate dose.
Road traffic also produces noise, which has been 
associated with adverse health outcomes such as 
hypertension and cardiovascular disease.3 Research 
on how noise affects birth outcomes is more limited, 
but a possible effect on LBW has been suggested.4 
Noise could potentially influence fetal growth through 
stress, hypertension, and sleep disturbance.4-6
Evidence about the relative roles of air and noise 
pollution on birth weight is limited and inconsistent.7-9 
To address health impacts of traffic effectively these 
need to be better understood. In this study, we 
investigate long-term exposure to both traffic related 
air and noise pollution during pregnancy in relation to 
birth weight outcomes.

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Road traffic pollution comprises not only air pollutants such as NO2 and 
particulate matter, but also noise
There is a large body of research demonstrating associations between maternal 
exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy and reduced birth weight, 
low birth weight (LBW) or small for gestational age (SGA)
The relation between road traffic noise and birth weight is unclear, and research 
examining traffic related air pollutant and noise coexposures together is very 
limited, so the extent to which observed air pollution associations might be 
attributable to road traffic noise is poorly understood
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
There is an increased risk of LBW specifically in relation to the air pollution 
profile of London
Exposure to local air pollution from road traffic is associated with increased 
risk of LBW in London, but there is little evidence for an independent exposure-
response effect of traffic related noise on birth weight
Reducing exposure to traffic related air pollution could reduce the burden of 
LBW, SGA, and subsequent morbidity, and ultimately give babies in urban 
environments a healthier start in life

other counties (2317 km2), as traffic information, and 
therefore air pollution and noise estimates, was not 
available for beyond the M25. Figure 1 shows the study 
area. We extracted 671 509 singleton births occurring 
within the M25 from 2006 to 2010 from the UK 
National Births and Stillbirth registers held at the UK 
Small Area Health Statistics Unit and supplied by the 
Office for National Statistics. These registers provide 
routinely collected data on all births in the country, 
including date of birth, birth weight, sex, and mother’s 
age. We appended gestational age and baby’s ethnicity 
from the NHS Numbers for Babies (NN4B) dataset, 
with 99.2% linkage. The method of gestational age 
assessment is not recorded on NN4B records. It is 
likely to be based on the more accurate and recent 
information from a mother’s routine second trimester 
scan but a proportion may be based on the date of the 
last menstrual period.10
Maternal residential addresses at the time of 
birth were geocoded to 0.1 m accuracy using Quick 
Address Software (Experian, 2015). We did not have 
information on whether a mother changed address 
during pregnancy. We excluded births in middle layer 
super output areas overlapping the M25 (n=7493) 
because area level covariates would reflect populations 
inside and outside the study boundary. We obtained 
2011 census output area level data as follows: Carstairs 
deprivation index from UK Census 2011 standardised 
across census output areas in study area;11 and 2014 
tobacco expenditure each week (population ≥16 years) 
from CACI, as a smoking proxy.
Air pollution exposures
Average monthly concentrations of nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), particulate 
matter with diameter <2.5 μm (PM2.5), particulate 
matter with diameter <10 μm (PM10), PM2.5 from traffic 
exhaust (PM2.5 traffic exhaust), and PM2.5 from traffic non-
exhaust (PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust) were estimated for points on 
a 20m × 20m regular grid across the study area, using 
dispersion modelling (KCLurban).12 NO2, NOx, PM2.5 
traffic exhaust, and PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust are primary pollutants 
related to traffic (ie, locally emitted or rapidly formed 
near source oxidation products, or both). PM2.5 and 
PM10 are dominated by regional particles, long range 
particles, and secondary particles formed through 
atmospheric chemical reactions but also include 
particles from primary traffic sources. O3 is a regional, 
secondary pollutant. PM2.5, PM10, and O3 are more 
homogeneously distributed than primary pollutants 
related to traffic. 
The KCLurban model uses Atmospheric Dispersion 
Modelling System (version 4) and road source model 
(version 2.3); data on emissions from the London 
Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI);13 empirically 
derived NO-NO2-O3 and PM relations; and hourly 
meteorological information.12 The model performed 
well when evaluated against measurements, with high 
spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) between observed 
versus modelled monthly concentrations: ρ>0.91 
for NOx, PM10, and PM2.5; ρ>0.83 for NO2; and ρ>0.9 
for O3 at both roadside and background locations.14 
Normalised mean bias (NMB) and root mean square 
error (RMSE) for modelled monthly predictions were 
slightly higher for NOx (NMB 11%; RMSE 13 μg/m3, 
22%) and NO2 (11%; 5.2 μg/m3, 20%) compared with 
PM2.5 (5%; 2.2 μg/m3, 14%) and PM10 ( 6%; 3.1 μg/
m3, 12%), indicating that whilst all have a positive 
bias (NMB), PM2.5 and PM10 are more accurately 
predicted than NO2 and NOx (RMSE). Further detail 
about the modelling procedure and model evaluation 
is available elsewhere.12 14 Using a Geographic 
Information System, each maternal residential address 
was assigned monthly air pollutant concentrations 
for the nearest 20 m × 20 m grid point according to its 
geocoded XY coordinates. For each birth record, we 
calculated the time weighted average concentrations 
for NOx, NO2, PM2.5 traffic exhaust, PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust, PM2.5, 
PM10, and O3 across pregnancy and for each trimester 
(first trimester defined as days 1-93, second as days 94-
186, and third as day 187 to day preceding delivery). 
The time weighting was based on the proportion of 
the pregnancy or trimester in each calendar month.15 
16 To define trimesters, gestation period (available as 
completed weeks of pregnancy) was converted to days, 
and 4 days (rounded up from the midpoint 3.5 days) 
was added to adjust for potential underestimation 
where true gestation period was not an exact number 
of completed weeks.
Road traffic noise exposures
A-weighted road traffic noise levels (dB) were modelled

residential addresses using the Traffic Noise Exposure 
(TRANEX) model:17 LAeq,16hr (average sound level 0700-
2300 hours); Lnight (2300-0700); Lday (0700-1900); Leve 
(1900-2300); Lden (logarithmic composite of Lday, Leve, 
and Lnight with 5 dB added to the Leve and 10 dB added 
to Lnight). Model validation studies conducted in two UK 
cities showed high Spearman’s correlation (ρ=0.90) 
between measured and modelled noise levels, 
indicating good model performance.17 The geocoded 
address points are for the geometric centroid of the 
dwelling, so for the purposes of noise modelling, the 
address points were universally moved to one metre 
from the façade on the side of the dwelling closest 
to the nearest road section with traffic information, 
as described elsewhere.17 We modelled noise for one 
midpoint year (2007) and applied these values to other 
years for the same address locations because temporal 
variability in noise over the study period was negligible. 
Noise could not be estimated for 4.5% of births owing 
to maternal residential address point (receptor) 
placement issues,17 however, these addresses were 
randomly distributed across the study area. We flagged 
addresses exposed to A-weighted Lday>50 dB from 
railways or aircraft (Heathrow Airport and London City 
Airport). Railway and London City Airport noise data 
were from Environmental Noise Directive strategic 
noise mapping (2006 annual average), and Heathrow 
Airport noise data were from annual average contours 
(2001) from the Civil Aviation Authority.
Outcomes
Term low birth weight (LBW) was defined as birth 
weight less than 2500 g and gestational age of 37 
weeks or more.18 SGA was defined as birth weight for 
gestational age less than the 10th centile by sex and 
ethnicity (to account for constitutional differences in 
birth weight by sex and ethnic group, and thus better 
identify pathologically small infants). 
We initially excluded births with gestational age 
less than 24 or greater than 44 weeks (n=1083, 
0.2%), missing or implausible (<200 g or >9000 g) 
birth weight (n=5747, 0.9%), and missing gestational 
age (n=9725, 1.5%). Birth weight outliers were then 
identified and excluded according to Tukey’s rule (ie, 
values greater than twice the interquartile range (IQR), 
below the first quartile, and above the third quartile 
for each gestational week) both overall and separately 
according to sex and ethnicity (white, Asian, black, or 
other) for the calculation of sex-ethnicity specific birth 
weight for gestational age centiles.19 Stillbirths were 
retained at this stage, because excluding stillbirths 
overestimates centiles for gestation <28 weeks by up to 
30%.20 We identified 0.58% of the observations overall 
as outliers. We calculated smoothed sex-ethnicity 
specific birth weight for gestational age centile curves 
according to the LMS method using LMSChartMaker 
Light V.2.54 software which has been used in previous 
research.21-26 The software can hold a maximum of 
100 000 records, so a subsample of 100 000 was 
randomly selected if the number of records for a 
given sex and ethnicity subgroup exceeded this. 
Representativeness of these 100 000 samples for 
their particular subgroup with respect to exposures 
or potential confounders was checked and confirmed. 
We did not calculate centiles or SGA for the ethnic 
group ‘other’, as it does not represent a meaningful 
homogeneous ethnic group for analysis. 
We excluded birth weight outliers (n=3815, 0.6%), 
stillbirths (3910, 0.6%), preterm births (40 346, 
6.1%), births missing noise exposure (31 197, 4.7%), 
and births missing ethnicity (47 710, 7.2%), leaving 
540 365 singleton term live births eligible for birth 
weight analyses, and 471 489 for SGA analyses (the 
exclusions were not mutually exclusive). 
Statistical Methods
Air pollutant exposures were analysed as continuous 
measures, rescaled to both IQR increments and 
increments specific to pollutants (NO2, 10 μg/m3; NOx, 
20 μg/m3; PM2.5 traffic exhaust, 1 μg/m3; PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust, 
1 μg/m3; PM2.5, 5 μg/m3; PM10, 10 μg/m3; O3, 10 μg/
m3). Where multiple air pollutants are examined it is 
a common approach to rescale to the IQR, in order to 
calculate effect estimates for comparable increases 
across the different pollutants (which may have very 
different absolute concentration ranges). The IQR is the 
difference between the 75th and 25th centiles of the 
distribution. As all noise metrics were highly correlated 
(ρ≥0.997), we limited analysis to one daytime (LAeq,16hr) 
and one night-time (Lnight) metric. Noise metrics were 
right skewed, so were categorised (LAeq,16hr <55 dB 
(reference), 55 to <60 dB, 60 to <65 dB, and ≥65 dB; 
and Lnight <50 dB (reference), 50 to <55 dB, 55 to <60 
dB, 60 to <65 dB, and ≥65 dB) for primary analysis. 
We examined the functional relation between term 
birth weight and noise (supplementary figure 1 in web 
appendix 1) using generalised additive models, and 
there were no major departures from linearity so we 
additionally analysed noise as a continuous variable, 
rescaled to IQR increment.
We analysed continuous birth weight using linear 
regression, and LBW or SGA using logistic regression. 
We limited analyses to term births. We adjusted all 
models for maternal age (<25, 25-29, 30-34, or ≥35 
years); birth registration type (within marriage, 
sole registration, joint with same address, joint 
with different address); birth season; birth year; 
Carstairs deprivation quintile; tobacco expenditure 
(continuous); and a random intercept for middle 
layer super output areas. Birth weight and LBW were 
also adjusted for sex, gestational age (linear and 
quadratic terms), and baby’s ethnicity (white, Asian, 
black, other). All covariates were included in the 
model a priori based on previous knowledge, except 
for birth season, birth year, and the random intercept 
for middle layer super output areas which were 
included as they were influential in the model. In 
joint air pollutant-noise models we further adjusted 
air pollutants for noise, and vice versa. We ran two air 
pollutant models for term LBW and continuous term 
birth weight, assessing models on a case by case basis 
for collinearity by inspecting the variance inflation

factor and standard errors. We also evaluated the 
relation between exposures and term birth weight 
(unadjusted, adjusted, and joint exposure models) 
using generalised additive models to evaluate non-
linearity.
We ran sensitivity analyses on joint air pollutant-
noise models evaluating possible effect modification 
by ethnicity (interaction term for exposure multiplied 
by ethnicity); and excluding those exposed to aircraft 
or railway noise >50 dB – the latter to remove the 
influence of high aircraft or railway noise and allow 
the evaluation of the influence of road traffic noise in a 
cleaner subgroup.

We calculated the population attributable fraction 
for term LBW for exposure to PM2.5 greater than the 25th 
centile of the exposure distribution, using the formula 
in figure 2.27 The exposure levels were quartiles for 
this calculation. All analyses were conducted in Stata 
(version 13), except generalised additive models which 
were run in R (version 3.1.2) using the mgcv package. 
No adjustment for multiple testing was made.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were 
they involved in developing plans for design or 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked 
to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. 
There are no plans to disseminate the results of the 
research to study participants or the relevant patient 
community. 
Results
Table 1 shows that 2.6% and 9.5% of term births 
were classified as LBW and SGA respectively. Over the 
study period of 2006 to 2010, there were temporal 
trends for LBW (decreasing), air pollutant exposures 
(decreasing particularly for PM2.5 traffic-exhaust, PM2.5, 
PM10), and an increasing proportion of births with 
high noise exposures, the latter reflecting change in 
spatial distribution of maternal addresses over time, as 
noise modelling was not time varying. Supplementary 
table 1 in web appendix 1 shows that air pollutant 
exposures were positively correlated (0.45 to 1.00), 
except with O3 (-0.46 to -0.77). Daytime and night-time 
road traffic noise were very highly correlated (∼1.00), 
and road traffic noise was positively correlated with air 
pollutant exposures (0.15 to 0.50) except O3 (∼-0.15). 
Maternal age, ethnicity, birth registration type, birth 
season, birth year, deprivation (Carstairs quintile), and 
tobacco expenditure were associated with outcomes 
and exposures (supplementary tables 2 and 3 in web 
appendix 1).
Air pollution
Figure 3 and supplementary tables 4 to 6 in web 
appendix 1 show that in single pollutant adjusted 
models, IQR increases in exposure to primary 
pollutants related to traffic (NO2, NOx, PM2.5 traffic exhaust, 
PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust), PM2.5, and PM10 during pregnancy 
were associated with 2% to 6% increased odds of 
term LBW (eg, odds ratios of 1.03, 95% confidence 
interval 1.00 to 1.06 for NO2; and 1.04, 1.01 to 1.07 
for PM2.5 traffic exhaust), 1% to 3% increased odds of term 
SGA, and reduced term birth weight. Figure 3 shows 
that decreased odds of term LBW were observed 
with increasing O3 exposure. Consistent with this, 
in adjusted generalised additive models, term birth 
weight 
decreased 
approximately 
linearly 
with 
increasing exposure to air pollutants (except O3) (not 
shown).
Figure 4 shows that in two air pollutant models, only 
PM2.5 traffic exhaust and PM2.5 consistently had odds ratios 
above one associated with term LBW when adjusted,

in turn, for other air pollutants. Reduced term birth 
weight was consistently associated with PM2.5 traffic-exhaust 
only (supplementary figure 2 in web appendix 1). We 
checked two air pollutant models for multicollinearity 
on a case by case basis. Models with very high variance 
inflation factors were excluded (eg, PM2.5 traffic exhaust 
and PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust), and where variance inflation 
factor values were borderline around 10, we excluded 
the model if the standard error more than doubled. 
However, for all two air pollutant models presented 
there was some increase in the standard errors for the 
exposure terms, which reflects the correlation structure 
between pollutants.
Noise
Figure 3 and supplementary tables 4 and 5 in web 
appendix 1 show that in adjusted models, high 
(≥65 dB) night-time road traffic noise exposure was 
associated with an odds ratio of 1.03 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.95 to 1.11) for term LBW, and 1.03 (0.99 to 
1.08) for term SGA, compared with the reference group 
(<50 dB), with a suggestion of increasing odds ratios 
across increasing night-time noise categories for term 
LBW. There was a suggestion of an exposure-response 
relation of decreasing term birth weight across 
increasing night-time and daytime road traffic noise 
categories (supplementary table 6 in web appendix 
1). In adjusted generalised additive models, term birth 
weight decreased with increasing exposure to road 
traffic noise in a largely linear fashion (not shown).
Air pollution and noise
Figures 3 and 5 and table 2 show that air pollutant 
associations with term LBW were robust to adjustment 
for night-time or daytime road traffic noise, with virtually 
no change to odds ratios. The same holds for term SGA 
(table 2) and term birth weight (supplementary figures 
3 and 4 and supplementary table 7 in web appendix 
1). Air pollutant effect estimates adjusted for noise as 
a continuous variable (for each IQR) (supplementary 
table 8 in web appendix 1) were virtually identical to 
those from the primary analysis which adjusted for 
noise as a categorical variable. Consistent with the 
linear regression models, in adjusted joint exposure 
generalised additive models, air pollution associations 
with term birth weight were robust to adjustment for 
road traffic noise. Figure 6 shows the joint model for 
NO2 and night-time noise (Lnight), with the remaining 
models in web appendix 1.
Models are adjusted for sex (term LBW model 
only), maternal age, ethnicity (term LBW model 
only), birth registration type, birth season, birth year, 
Carstairs quintile (census output area level), tobacco 
expenditure (census output area level), gestational age 
as linear and quadratic terms, and random intercept 
for middle layer super output areas, in addition to 
including the air pollutant or noise metrics shown 
above. All air pollution estimates are adjusted for either 
night-time (Lnight) or daytime noise (LAeq,16hr) as specified 
in the table, and noise estimates are adjusted for traffic 
related air pollution exposure (NO2). IQR values for air

pollutants: NO2 (for each IQR, 8.6 μg/m3), NOx (23.7 
μg/m3), PM2.5 trafficexhaust (0.35 μg/m3), PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust 
(0.29 μg/m3), PM2.5 (2.2 μg/m3), PM10 (3.0 μg/m3), and 
O3 (8.4 μg/m3)
After adjustment for each air pollutant, in turn, 
there was no evidence that increasing night-time 
or daytime road traffic noise exposure (analysed 
as either a categorical or continuous variable) was 
associated with increasing risk of term LBW (figs 3 
and 5) or term SGA (supplementary tables 8 and 9 
in web appendix 1). There was some suggestion of 
an association with reduced term birth weight in the 
highest night-time road traffic noise category after 
adjustment for NO2 or NOx but not after adjustment for 
PM2.5 traffic exhaust or PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust. However, this was 
not evident in adjusted joint exposure generalised 
additive models – which indicated that once adjusted 
for any of the primary traffic related air pollutants, in 
turn, there appears to be no relation between road 
traffic noise and term birth weight (fig 6 and web 
appendix 1). A weak association remained between 
road traffic noise and reduced term birth weight after 
adjustment for PM2.5, PM10, and O3 in linear regression 
(supplementary figure 3 and supplementary tables 8 
and 9 in web appendix 1) and generalised additive 
models (web appendix 1).
Trimester specific air pollution models
For term LBW, odds ratios for primary traffic related 
air pollutant exposures in the second and third 
trimesters tended to be stronger than for first trimester 
exposures (supplementary table 10 in web appendix 1). 
Conversely, for term SGA, odds ratios for exposures in 
earlier trimesters were stronger than the third trimester 
exposure for PM2.5 traffic exhaust and PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust, 
and first trimester exposure appeared to be strongest 
for PM2.5 and PM10 (supplementary table 10 in web 
appendix 1). However, confidence intervals for trimester 
specific effects overlapped. These analyses are presented 
according to prespecified pollutant specific increments 
(not IQR) to allow comparison between trimesters for 
each pollutant.
Additional analyses
Compared with unadjusted analyses (supplementary 
tables 4 to 6 in web appendix 1), effect sizes were 
generally reduced in single or joint pollutant adjusted 
models. Given the strong relation between exposures and 
census output area level deprivation, we ran birth weight 
models without adjustment for Carstairs quintile to check 
for overadjustment, however, there were only small 
changes in birth weight coefficients (<1 g) and the pattern 
of results was unchanged (not shown). The inclusion of 
a random intercept for middle layer super output areas 
(to models adjusted for all other covariates described) 
resulted in relatively small changes to associations for 
noise, term LBW, or SGA, but considerable attenuation of 
associations between air pollutants and term birth weight 
(-18% to -28% for primary traffic related air pollutants, 
and -35% to -49% for pollutants including regional or 
urban background contributions).

All sensitivity analyses were conducted on joint air 
pollutant-noise models. Noise analyses were largely 
unchanged after excluding those exposed to aircraft 
or rail noise greater than 50 dB (not shown). We did 
not observe interactions between ethnicity and air 
pollution or road traffic noise exposures for term LBW 
or SGA. Ethnicity-exposure interactions were observed 
in term birth weight analyses with both primary traffic 
related air pollutants (P value<0.001) and road traffic 
noise exposures (∼0.028 for daytime noise, 0.005 for 
night-time noise), with inverse relations for primary 
traffic related air pollutants across all ethnic strata 
(supplementary table 11 in web appendix 1).
The population attributable fraction estimated for 
term LBW for exposure to PM2.5 over the 25th centile of 
the distribution (ie, 13.8 μg/m3) during pregnancy was 
3% (0% to 7%). This 3% corresponds to 93 (0-216) 
cases of term LBW out of a total of 2950 cases each 
year on average in our London study population which 
are directly attributable to residential exposure during 
pregnancy to PM2.5>13.8 μg/m3.
discussion
To our knowledge, this is the largest UK study on air 
pollution and birth weight, and the first UK study and 
largest study worldwide of birth weight and noise 
exposure. We observed that long term exposure during 
pregnancy to NO2, NOx, PM2.5 overall and specifically 
from traffic exhaust and non-exhaust sources, and 
PM10, were all associated with increased risk of LBW at 
term, across London. There was strong confounding of 
the relation between road traffic noise and birth weight 
by primary traffic related air pollutant coexposures, 
and our results, particularly from generalised additive 
models, suggest little evidence for an independent 
exposure-response effect of traffic related noise on 
birth weight outcomes. Our findings from two air 
pollutant models suggest that associations between 
term LBW and air pollutants emitted from vehicle 
exhausts may be driven by the fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5 traffic exhaust) component rather than the gaseous 
NOx component.
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
This study benefits from highly spatially resolved air 
pollution modelling assigned at address level, and 
noise levels estimated at address point. For noise 
particularly, this represents an advance on previous 
studies which have assigned noise exposure with lower 
spatial precision (eg, at postcode level,8 or according to 
50 m or 250 m buffers around maternal address,7 or 
based on road proximity)28, and consequently reduces

potential exposure misclassification, as noise levels 
may change dramatically over short distances (tens 
of metres). Nonetheless, the potential for exposure 
misclassification remains. For air pollution, there 
may be some exposure misclassification close to 
sources (where gradients of primary pollutants are 
steep). However, most people do not live within 10 
m to 30 m of the centre of a main road so the impact 
on this study will be low. The percentage of maternal 
residences in our dataset within 10 m of a major road 
(annual average daily traffic (AADT) >10 000 vehicles) 
was 0.07%, within 20 m was 5%, and within 30 m 
was 11%. We examined the relation between living 
within 10 m, 20 m, and 30m of a major road and key 
individual level variables (ethnicity, birth registration 
type, and maternal age). These variables were not 
associated with living within 10 m of a major road. The 
percentage of mothers living within either 20 m or 30 
m of a major road was slightly greater (by up to 3%) 
for non-white ethnicities (v white), unmarried mothers 
(v married), and younger (v older) maternal age groups. 
However, these percentage differences are very small 
(≤3%), so there is no reason to assume that this would 
introduce serious bias. Most importantly, however, 
whilst there may be some exposure misclassification 
between the exposure at the actual address versus the 
grid point estimate assigned, this should introduce no 
bias because we have assigned the nearest 20 m × 20 
m point. To introduce bias we would always have to 
choose the point on the side of the residence closest to 
the road and this is unlikely. 
The air pollutant model predicted PM2.5 and PM10 
slightly more accurately than NO2 and NOx, but the 
model bias was in the same direction (over prediction) 
for all these pollutants. Greater model prediction 
uncertainty for NO2 and NOx may result in effect 
estimates for NO2 and NOx being more conservative 
than those for PM2.5 and PM10 and therefore may limit 
our ability to directly compare the magnitude of effect 
estimates for NO2 or NOx with PM2.5 or PM10. 
The noise model is likely to have overestimated and 
underestimated noise on some minor roads (owing to 
the constant for traffic on minor roads), but there is no 
geographical pattern (ie, autocorrelation) in any bias as 
a result of this,17 however, to reduce potential exposure 
misclassification we categorised noise exposure for 
analysis. We avoided selection bias by using all birth 
registration data. Direct measures of individual level 
smoking or deprivation data were unavailable, but 
we adjusted for tobacco expenditure and deprivation 
(Carstairs quintile) at census output area level, as in 
previous epidemiological studies.29 30 We have also 
adjusted for birth registration type, an individual 
level variable which relates to both individual 
level qualifications and housing tenure (and thus 
socioeconomic status or deprivation) and individual 
level smoking.31 We cannot exclude the possibility 
of some residual confounding by maternal smoking, 
passive smoking, or deprivation, but we have adjusted 
for deprivation and smoking by proxy at individual 
level, in addition to at area level. Information on parity 
was not available as part of this study, so we could not 
adjust for any potential confounding effects directly, 
but an association between parity and exposure 
is most likely through deprivation (at area level or 
individual level), ethnicity, or maternal age, and these 
have been adjusted for. There is some evidence to 
suggest that extremes of ambient temperature may be 
associated with adverse birth outcomes (eg, preterm 
birth or early delivery and LBW).32-36 Meteorological 
conditions, including ambient temperature, are 
related to air pollution levels. By adjusting for season 
we did adjust for general seasonal variation in average 
temperatures, but we could not adjust for exposure 
to extreme ambient temperatures as we did not have 
data on temperature linked to the births data. We 
could not account for residential mobility during 
pregnancy (∼16% in UK37), nor exposures away from 
maternal residence (eg, workplace or transport), 
indoor air pollution, or exposure modification owing 
to behaviours (eg, opening windows), or building 
characteristics (eg, bedroom façade). These could 
contribute to exposure misclassification. 
We were not able to adjust for spontaneous versus 
medical intervention early delivery (which could 
influence the outcome indirectly by gestation period), 
as data on delivery type were not available as part of

this study from the birth registry or NHS Numbers for 
Babies (NN4B) datasets. If clinical practice in medical 
intervention for early delivery varies spatially (eg, 
between hospitals or owing to cultural factors), this 
could potentially confound the spatial component of 
exposure metrics. However, all our epidemiological 
models included a random effect for small area (middle 
layer super output areas – average population 8000) 
specifically to account for underlying spatial patterns 
in the data, so we do not think this should be a serious 
issue. Multiple hypothesis tests were performed, so the 
multiple testing problem (ie, that the probability of a 
Type 1 error will be greater than 0.05 (5%)), should be 
considered when interpreting P values.
Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other 
studies
Our single air pollutant model findings are consistent 
with recent meta-analyses which report increased risk 
of low birth weight (LBW) and reduced mean birth 
weight associated with NO2,1 PM2.5,38 and PM10.1 39 
Meta-analysis results for O3 are less clear: odds ratio for 
LBW of 1.01 (95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.25) 
for each 20 ppb increase in pregnancy exposure to 
O3.1 To our knowledge, only three Californian studies, 
have examined source specific PM2.5 and birth weight. 
Converted to the same interquartile range (IQR) (0.35 
μg/m3) scale as our PM2.5 traffic exhaust analyses, these 
studies each report 2% increased odds of term LBW 
for PM2.5 from diesel and 3% to 4% increased odds for 
PM2.5 from gasoline,40-42 consistent in magnitude with 
our odds ratio for term LBW of 1.04 (95% confidence 
interval, 1.01 to 1.07) for each IQR increase. To our 
knowledge, no previous study has reported two 
pollutant models including source specific PM2.5. Our 
findings, that only PM2.5 traffic exhaust (out of PM2.5 traffic exhaust, 
NO2, and NOx) showed a consistent elevated risk with 
mutual adjustment, suggesting that associations 
between LBW and air pollutants emitted from vehicle 
exhausts may be driven by the fine particulate 
matter (PM2.5 traffic exhaust) component rather than the 
gaseous NOx component is an important and new 
contribution to scientific knowledge. Our study also 
shows associations between LBW and fine particulate 
matter from road traffic which is not emitted from the 
vehicle exhaust (ie, brake or tyre wear particles and 
vehicle induced resuspension of road dust). However, 
owing to multicollinearity in models containing both 
 
PM2.5 traffic exhaust and PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust, we could not 
separate potential effects of traffic related exhaust 
and non-exhaust related PM2.5. The magnitude of 
association with PM2.5 traffic exhaust was consistently 
stronger than with PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust, and this could 
reflect differing chemical constituents (and thus 
toxicity) of the PM2.5 mixture from different sources.
We found that associations between road traffic 
noise and term birth weight were strongly attenuated 
when adjusted for primary air pollutants related to 
traffic: to null when adjusted for PM2.5 traffic exhaust or 
PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust, although after adjustment for NO2 
or NOx an association between night-time noise and 
reduced birth weight in the highest exposure category 
remained, which could possibly reflect a threshold 
effect. The results of our generalised additive models 
adjusted for NO2 or NOx, however, do not support an 
independent association with road traffic noise, or 
suggest any threshold effect for noise. The most recent 
systematic review of noise exposure and birth weight 
found “evidence supportive of associations between 
LBW and noise exposure” particularly for very high 
noise levels, but the evidence was inconsistent,4 
based on 10 occupational studies, four aircraft noise 
studies, and two traffic noise studies. Three previous 
studies have examined long term air pollution and 
noise exposures jointly.7-9 Our findings are consistent 
with a small cohort study (n=6438) in Barcelona, 
which suggested elevated risks of term LBW and small 
for gestational age (SGA) associated with noise and 
air pollution exposures in single exposure adjusted 
models, but in a joint exposure model term LBW risk 
was associated with third trimester PM2.5 (for each 3.6 
μg/m3, odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.07 
to 1.61), but not noise (for each 6.7 dB (A-weighted), 
0.89, 0.71 to 1.12).7 Term birth weight was not 
associated with NO2, NOx, or road traffic noise, in 
either fully adjusted single exposure models or joint 
exposure models in the Danish National Birth Cohort 
(n=75 166).9
Our findings contrast with a registry based study 
in Vancouver (n=68 238), which found associations 
between all transportation (road traffic, railway, and 
aircraft) noise (Lden) and reduced term birth weight or 
LBW which remained after adjustment for PM2.5, PM10, 
and primary road traffic air pollution (NO2 and NOx), 
however, associations for air pollutants were attenuated 
to null by adjustment for transportation noise.8 Road 
traffic noise showed similar associations with term 
birth weight or LBW in single exposure models, but road 
traffic noise adjusted for air pollution was not analysed.8 
We, however, found an association between the road 
traffic noise and reduced birth weight remained after 
adjustment for PM2.5 or PM10 (which include regional 
and urban background contributions) – one possible 
explanation is that adjusting for PM2.5 or PM10 did not 
fully control for confounding of noise by air pollution 
coexposures from road traffic. This should be noted by 
other researchers investigating potential health effects 
of road traffic noise. 
Compared with London, the noise distribution in 
Vancouver was wider (Lden mean 60.2 dB(A-weighted), 
range 6.2-89.0), mean air pollution exposures were 
lower and with less contrast in Vancouver (PM2.5 
mean 4.1 μg/m3, range 0-11.3; NO2 mean 33.7 μg/m3, 
range 0-64.5) and Denmark (NO2 median 11.0 μg/m3, 
5th-95th centiles 7.1–26.3), and air pollutant-noise 
correlations were lower in Vancouver (correlations 
with road traffic noise: 0.05 for NO2, 0.09 for PM2.5; and 
all transportation noise: 0.18 for NO2, 0.16 for PM2.5), 
but higher in Denmark (0.47 between NO2 and road 
traffic noise).8 9 These differences, which could reflect 
differences in pollutant sources, may contribute to the 
contrasting findings from Denmark and Vancouver

compared with our study. In our study the noise model 
floor means that the minimum modelled value of night-
time noise from road traffic in London was 42.4 dB,17 
which is higher than the recommended upper limit of 
exposure of total noise of 40 dB proposed by the Night 
Noise Guidelines for Europe.43 It is possible that we did 
not have a sufficiently low noise exposure reference 
group, to detect small associations between noise and 
birth weight, above the guideline level.
In the broader context, our findings contrast with 
reviews of joint air pollution and noise studies which 
suggest independent effects of road traffic noise on 
other health outcomes (eg, cardiovascular outcomes), 
after adjustment for air pollution.44 45 This could 
reflect different biological pathways between noise 
and fetal growth versus other health outcomes at later 
stages of life. The fetus has no direct exposure to the 
environment, but exposure is mediated through the 
mother and placenta, and this may modify effects. 
Threshold effects may be relevant for exposure to noise, 
and the threshold could vary between health outcomes, 
possibly being higher for effects on birth weight versus, 
for example, cardiovascular outcomes. Alternatively, it 
might reflect differences between studies in the ability 
to control for confounding by air pollution from road 
traffic specifically. We did note that associations between 
noise and birth weight were more strongly attenuated by 
adjustment for primary road traffic-related air pollutants 
(NO2, NOx, PM2.5 traffic exhaust, PM2.5 traffic non-exhaust) compared 
with background air pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10). This 
suggests that adjusting for the background pollutants 
may not fully adjust for the confounding effects of air 
pollution coexposures directly from road traffic, in 
our study. With respect to cardiovascular outcomes, it 
has been noted that “more studies using air pollution 
indicators specific to road traffic are needed to properly 
assess if road noise and pollutant effects on CV outcomes 
are subjected to the confounding effect of one another.”45
Our results did not give a clear indication as to 
which trimester could be most influential with respect 
to air pollution and fetal growth, and previous study 
findings have been inconsistent on this point. The 
most recent meta-analyses are suggestive overall of 
stronger associations for later trimesters between 
LBW or reduced birth weight and PM2.5 and PM10,38 39 
but unclear for NO2.1 One potential explanation for 
this is that earlier trimester exposures may be more 
prone to exposure measurement bias from residential 
mobility (in studies assigning exposure according 
to maternal residential address at birth), and thus 
attenuated towards the null. However, there are 
persuasive findings from a natural experiment of air 
pollution reductions during the 2008 Bejing Olympics, 
supporting the importance of the third trimester 
exposures to air pollution in relation to term birth 
weight.46 This is biologically plausible, as during the 
third trimester the rate of fetal growth and weight gain 
increases dramatically and reaches its peak at about 
week 33.47 48
We found effect modification by ethnicity of the 
relation between air pollution and reduced birth 
weight in line with previous studies, although results 
for different ethnic groups have been inconsistent.49-54 
Effect modification by ethnicity could reflect increased 
susceptibility to the adverse impacts of air pollution, 
owing to environmental inequality or differing 
biological susceptibility.
Biological mechanisms in which air pollution or 
noise may impair fetal growth are not established. 
Hypothesised mechanisms for air pollution are 
oxidative stress; endocrine disruption; changes to 
maternal-placental blood flow and oxygen or nutrition 
transfer;55 placental mitochondrial damage;56 and 
placental growth or function,57 whilst those for noise 
are stress triggered endocrine or immune response 
disruption, 
plasma 
catecholamine 
increase 
or 
placental blood flow decrease,4 hypertension,5 and 
sleep disturbance.6 Convincing evidence that maternal 
passive smoking during pregnancy is causally related 
to reduced birth weight,58 strongly supports the 
biological plausibility of an association between 
ambient air pollution and reduced birth weight, by 
analogy.
Conclusion
This study suggests that in Greater London, which 
has 19% of all annual births in England and Wales,59 
air pollution from road traffic is having a detrimental 
impact upon babies’ health, before they are born. We 
estimate that 3% of term LBW cases in London are 
directly attributable to residential exposure during 
pregnancy to PM2.5>13.8 μg/m3. Our results suggest 
little evidence for an independent exposure-response 
effect of traffic related noise on birth weight, but we 
cannot rule out that an association might be observed 
in a study area with a wider range of noise exposures. 
Our findings should be broadly generalisable to 
other UK and European cities or urban areas with 
comparable exposure levels and profiles. At city scale, 
environmental health policies aimed at reducing 
road traffic air pollution could reduce the burden of 
LBW, SGA, and subsequent lifelong morbidity. With 
the annual number of births projected to continue 
increasing in London,60 the absolute health burden 
will increase at the population level, unless air quality 
in London improves.
