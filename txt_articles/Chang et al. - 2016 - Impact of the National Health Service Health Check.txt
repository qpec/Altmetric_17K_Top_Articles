T
he World Health Organization has set a 
target to reduce premature death from 
cardiovascular disease by 25% by 
2025,1 a goal that was affirmed in the recently 
published Sustainable Development Goals.2 
International protocols recommend the imple-
mentation of risk assessment for cardiovascular 
disease and management programs as integral 
components of strategies to achieve this tar-
get.3–6 Although different in scale and settings, 
many countries have launched risk assessment 
programs, including the Million Hearts initia-
tive in the United States and a program of 
“more heart and diabetes checks” in New Zea-
land.4–6 In Canada, the recommendation to 
deliver cardiovascular screening, education and 
follow-up programs in a variety of community 
settings was published in the Canadian Heart 
Health Strategy and Action Plan in 2009.7 The 
action plan aimed to improve heart health in the 
Canadian population, although its funding was 
never secured.7,8 However, the recently 
launched Choosing Wisely Canada campaign, 
which aims to promote the cost-effective use of 
medicines, has challenged the usefulness of 
annual health examinations for asymptomatic 
adults who have no apparent risk factors.9
The Health Check program of the National 
Health Service in England is the largest and 
most ambitious risk assessment and manage-
ment program for cardiovascular disease world-
wide. Since its inception in 2009, the program 
has offered, to all adults aged 40–74 years with 
no known vascular disease, a risk assessment 
every 5 years, with tailored management strat-
egies, including lifestyle advice. Introduction of

Background: The National Health Service 
Health Check program in England is the largest 
cardiovascular risk assessment and manage-
ment program in the world. We assessed the 
effect of this program on modelled risk of 
cardio 
vascular disease, individual risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease, prescribing of relevant 
medications and diagnosis of vascular disease.
Methods: We obtained retrospective elec-
tronic medical records for a randomly selected 
sample of 138 788 patients aged 40–74 years 
registered with 462 English general practices 
participating in the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink between 2009 and 2013. We used a 
quasi-experimental design of difference-in-
differences matching analysis to compare 
changes in outcomes between Health Check 
attendees and nonattendees, with a median 
follow-up time of 2 years.
Results: Overall, 21.4% of the eligible popula-
tion attended a Health Check. After matching 
(n = 29 672 in each group), attendees had a sig-
nificant absolute reduction in modelled risk for 
cardiovascular disease (–0.21%, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] –0.24% to –0.19%) and individual 
risk factors: systolic blood pressure 
(–2.51 mm Hg, 95% CI –2.77 to –2.25 mm Hg), 
diastolic blood pressure (–1.46 mm Hg, 95% CI 
–1.62 to –1.29 mm Hg), body mass index (–0.27, 
95% CI –0.34 to –0.20) and total cholesterol 
(–0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI –0.18 to –0.13 mmol/L). 
Statins were prescribed for 39.9% of attendees 
who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease. 
The program resulted in significantly more diag-
noses of selected vascular diseases among atten-
dees, with the largest increases for hypertension 
(2.99%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (1.31%).
Interpretation: The National Health Service 
Health Check program had statistically signifi-
cant but clinically modest impacts on modelled 
risk for cardiovascular disease and individual 
risk factors, although diagnosis of vascular dis-
ease increased. Overall program performance 
was substantially below national and interna-
tional targets, which highlights the need for 
careful planning, monitoring and evaluation 
of similar initiatives internationally.

the Health Check program has been controver-
sial, and its appropriateness and benefits have 
been continually challenged.10–13 Previous 
assessments have been limited to evaluations of 
local programs, have had only short follow-up 
and have not taken underlying trends in cardio-
vascular risk into account, although some of 
these analyses have identified significant but 
modest reductions in modelled risk for cardio-
vascular disease and individual risk factors.14–16
Evaluation of cardiovascular risk assessment 
programs delivered in routine care settings 
internationally are sparse. The impact of the 
Health Check program, which is being deliv-
ered in the context of a universal health system 
with well-developed primary care and high 
penetration of electronic medical records, has 
international significance. The objectives of this 
study were to assess the impact of the Health 
Check program on changes in modelled risk for 
cardiovascular disease, individual risk factors 
for cardiovascular disease, prescribing of rele-
vant medications and identification of new 
diagnoses of vascular disease.
Methods
Data source
We used data from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink, one of the largest electronic 
medical records databases in the world (www.
cprd.com/).17 This database routinely collects 
longitudinal and anonymized primary care data 
from general practices in the United Kingdom, 
providing a nationally representative sample 
consisting of about 7% of the population.17–20 
The data are subject to regular quality checks 
and are widely used for research studies.21 Data 
stored in the database include each patient’s 
demographic information and registration sta-
tus, medical history and diagnosis, laboratory 
test results (e.g., cholesterol level), drug pre-
scriptions and referrals to secondary care. Eth-
ics approval for the study protocol was obtained 
from the Independent Scientific Advisory Com-
mittee of the Clinical Practice Research Data-
link (protocol number: 12_039).
Study population
We extracted data for a computer-selected ran-
dom sample of 194 248 English residents aged 
40–74 years who were registered with a practice 
that was participating in the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink during the first 4 years of the 
Health Check program (Apr. 1, 2009, to Mar. 31, 
2013), which we defined as the intervention 
period. According to the Health Check eligibility 
criteria, we excluded patients with a previous 
diagnosis of vascular disease (atrial fibrillation, 
chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, 
hypercholesterolemia, heart failure, hyperten-
sion, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, tran-
sient ischemic attack and diabetes mellitus). 
Patients were categorized into 2 groups: Health 
Check attendees and nonattendees. Because of a 
delay in publicizing a universal code for recording 
Health Check attendance in general practice, we 
identified attendees following the best practice 
guidance of the Health Check program.22 We 
defined attendance as the recording of 4 risk fac-
tors (blood pressure, body mass index [BMI], 
cholesterol and smoking status) within a 6-month 
period when a patient was continuously eligible 
for the program and a Health Check attendance 
date as the day when the last of the 4 risk factors 
was recorded.23,24 Our method of identifying 
Health Check attendance has achieved good 
validity, as documented previously.24
Outcome measures
Our study outcomes were the modelled risk 
score for cardiovascular disease as computed 
by the QRISK2 algorithm, which is recom-
mended by the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (because the Framingham 
algorithm overestimates cardiovascular risk in 
the UK population), systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, BMI, total cholesterol, 
prevalence of smoking, prescribing of statin 
and antihypertensive medications, and diagno-
sis of the following vascular diseases: atrial 
fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, coronary 
artery disease (including myocardial infarc-
tion), familial hypercholesterolemia, heart fail-
ure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, 
stroke, transient ischemic attack and type 2 
diabetes mellitus.25,26
We generated cardiovascular risk scores 
using a licensed QRISK2 batch processor 
(.NET version 2014.0, ClinRisk Ltd.), which 
computes risk scores from the following data: 
systolic blood pressure, BMI, ratio of total to 
high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 
smoking status and pre-existing vascular dis-
eases (atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, 
hypertension and diabetes), none of which 
apply to patients who are eligible for the Health 
Check program; and other risk factors, includ-
ing the patient’s age, sex, ethnicity, family his-
tory of premature coronary artery disease, and 
the Townsend index value (explained below) or 
postcode.25 Patient age was held constant (from 
the year 2009) throughout the intervention 
period, to isolate the effect of aging on risk 
scores.16 We assigned ethnicity as “missing” if 
it was not recorded (which occurred for 32.8% 
 Research
E230 
CMAJ, July 12, 2016, 188(10) 
of the study population), we assigned a smok-
ing status of “nonsmoker” if there was no indi-
cation of the patient being a smoker in the 
past,27 and we assumed no family history of 
premature coronary artery disease if such a his-
tory had never been recorded.
The Townsend index is a composite small-
area measure of deprivation for England, which 
is based on the 2001 census data reported for 
unemployment, household overcrowding, and 
non-ownership of a house or a car.28 The Clin-
ical Practice Research Datalink mapped an 
individual’s postcode to the area’s Townsend 
score but supplied only quintiles of the 
Townsend deprivation index values, where the 
quintile with the lowest index values repre-
sented the least-deprived neighbourhoods and 
the quintile with the highest index values repre-
sented the most-deprived neighbourhoods. 
Therefore, we assigned the median Townsend 
index value for each quintile using data 
obtained nationally for QRISK2 calculations.29 
For patients with missing Townsend data, the 
QRISK2 batch processor assigned a score of 0.
Statistical analysis
We used a difference-in-differences matching 
model, as first proposed by Heckman and asso-
ciates,30 which is commonly employed in health 
services research and policy evaluations.31–36 
The model begins with propensity score match-
ing, which ensures that the observed character-
istics of the intervention and matched control 
group are comparable, consequently eliminat-
ing as much observed heterogeneity as pos-
sible.37 Because the matched control group pro-
vides a counterfactual for the intervention 
group had there been no intervention, the 
difference-in-differences part of the model 
removes unobserved heterogeneity that was 
fixed over time or that followed parallel time 
trends between groups, thus providing a robust 
estimator.30,34,35,38
 Our statistical model required a comparison 
of individual-level data between baseline and 
follow-up periods in relation to an intervention 
date. We defined the intervention date as the 
Health Check attendance date, as described 
above, for attendees and as the midpoint of the 
eligibility period (defined by the age and regis-
tration status of individual patients) for non-
attendees. Exploiting the longitudinal nature of 
the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we 
obtained each individual’s baseline data from 
the latest measurements taken on or within 
5 years before the intervention date and follow-
up data from the latest measurements taken after 
the intervention date but before the end of the 
study (on Mar. 31, 2013). For prescribing of 
medications, we considered a patient to be tak-
ing a medication if there were prescriptions 
recorded within 12 months before or after the 
intervention date for baseline and follow-up 
data, respectively. Participants in our study had 
no diagnosis at baseline because of the Health 
Check eligibility criteria, and we considered any 
diagnosis within 3 months after the intervention 
date to be associated with the intervention.23
Missing data are a common problem in rou-
tine health care data.39 Failure to consider miss-
ing risk factor data in our dataset could have 
resulted in analysis of a highly selected subset of 
the study population, which would have wasted 
valuable observed risk factor data for most 
patients.40,41 However, we have included findings 
from complete case analyses for comparison. 
We therefore used multiple imputation by 
chained equations to estimate missing data for 
blood pressure, BMI and log-transformed (for 
skewed distribution) total and HDL cholesterol 
at both baseline and follow-up. We included in 
the imputation model all input variables for the 
QRISK2 algorithm, data on English geographic 
region and an indicator for Health Check atten-
dance. We generated 10 imputed datasets and 
ran the QRISK2 algorithm on each one to com-
pute cardiovascular risk scores.
We calculated the means (or proportions) of 
the outcomes before and after the intervention 
for both Health Check attendees and non-
attendees. We compared the changes in out-
come from baseline to follow-up using paired 
t tests, and we assessed the difference in 
changes between attendees and nonatten 
dees 
using t tests (unadjusted difference-in-
differences). We then ran the difference-in-
differences matching model for every outcome 
on each imputed dataset and combined the 
point estimates and standard errors using the 
Rubin rule, to produce the adjusted difference-
in-differences estimator.42
All data management and statistical analyses 
were conducted in STATA SE software, ver-
sion 12.1. We used psmatch2 in the STATA 
software, with specification of kernel matching 
with appropriate bandwidth (i.e., between 0.05 
and 0.1), and allowed matching to build on the 
following variables: patient’s age, sex, ethnicity 
(white, nonwhite or missing), quintile of the 
Index of Multiple Deprivation (2010) mapped 
to practice postcode and English region. We 
also ran models that included clinical risk factor 
levels at baseline (systolic blood pressure, BMI, 
total cholesterol and smoking status) in the 
matching process, to assess the robustness of 
the results. The Index of Multiple Deprivation 
 Research

E231
is a composite score of socioeconomic status 
similar to the Townsend deprivation index, but 
it was assigned to each “Lower Layer Super 
Output Area” (geographic area containing 
about 650 households) in England, on the basis 
of 7 principal domains of deprivation (income, 
employment, health deprivation and disability, 
education skills and training, barriers to hous-
ing and services, crime, living environment).43 
We did not use individual-level Townsend data, 
as these were missing for 21.1% of the sample.
To evaluate the levels of impact by population 
subgroups, we stratified the analyses by pre-inter-
vention modelled cardiovascular risk categories 
(< 10%, 10%–20% or ≥ 20%) or by whether the 
following risk factors were above recommended 
levels: systolic blood pressure (≥ 140 mm Hg), 
diastolic blood pressure (≥ 90 mm Hg), BMI 
(≥ 30) and total cholesterol (≥ 5 mmol/L).
Results
We identified a cohort of 138 788 patients from 
462 practices who were eligible for a Health 
Check between Apr. 1, 2009, and Mar. 31, 
2013, for inclusion in our analyses, after 
excluding 55 460 patients with a previous diag-
nosis of vascular disease (Appendix 1, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.151201/-/DC1). Of the eligible patients, 
21.4% (29 672) attended a Health Check during 
the intervention period (median follow-up 2 yr).
Table 1 compares the demographic charac-
teristics of attendees and nonattendees before 
and after propensity score matching. Compared 
with nonattendees before matching, Health 
Check attendees were older (mean age 53.5 v. 
50.1), more likely to be women (52.6% v. 
50.0%) and more likely to be from a white eth-

nic group (71.9% v. 54.8%) (all p < 0.001). 
Differences between attendees and nonattend-
ees were nonsignificant (p > 0.05) after match-
ing, which indicates that the propensity score 
method substantially eliminated between-group 
differences in observed characteristics.
Modelled risk for cardiovascular disease
Before the intervention, Health Check attendees 
had a higher mean QRISK2 score than non-
attendees (6.7% v. 5.1%) (Table 2). Although 
both groups had absolute reductions in cardio-
vascular risk after the intervention (reduced to 
6.2% and 4.9%, respectively), there was a small 
but significantly greater reduction among 
attendees after matching (–0.21%, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] –0.24% to –0.19%). This 
reduction is equivalent to one additional cardio-
vascular event being prevented every year for 
every 4762 (95% CI 4167 to 5263) people who 
attend a Health Check. Our robustness tests 
indicated that the results remained broadly sim-
ilar when patients were additionally matched on 
the basis of 4 clinical risk factor levels at base-
line (systolic blood pressure, BMI, total choles-
terol and smoking status) (see Appendices 2 
and 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.151201/-/DC1).
After stratification by pre-intervention 
cardio 
vascular risk categories, the absolute risk 
reduction for attendees with a baseline risk of 
20% or higher (–0.54%, 95% CI –0.93% to 
–0.15%) was not significantly greater than for 
those with lower risk (10%–20% risk: –0.34%, 
95% CI –0.44% to –0.24%; < 10% risk: 
–0.14%, 95% CI –0.16% to –0.12%) (Figure 1;

Individual risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease
Relative to nonattendees, Health Check atten-
dees had higher pre-intervention mean systolic 
blood pressure (131.9 v. 128.5 mm Hg), higher 
mean diastolic blood pressure (80.2 v. 
78.7 mm Hg), higher mean BMI (27.7 v. 26.9) 
and slightly higher mean total cholesterol (5.5 v. 
5.3 mmol/L), but a lower prevalence of current 
smoking (17.9% v. 22.2%) (Table 2). After the 
intervention, Health Check attendees had abso-
lute reductions in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, total cholesterol and smoking preva-
lence, but not in BMI. After matching, there 
were significant reductions in the following indi-
vidual risk factors among Health Check attendees: 
systolic blood pressure (–2.51 mm Hg, 95% CI 
–2.77 to –2.25 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure 
(–1.46 mm Hg, 95% CI –1.62 to –1.29 mm Hg), 
BMI (–0.27, 95% CI –0.34 to –0.20) and total chol-
esterol (–0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI –0.18 to 
–0.13 mmol/L).
Reductions in diastolic blood pressure, BMI 
and total cholesterol were similar among Health 
Check attendees, irrespective of modelled cardio-
vascular risk levels at baseline (Appendix 4). 
Reductions in systolic blood pressure were signif-
icantly greater among Health Check attendees 
with higher modelled cardiovascular risk at base-
line: the reductions were –4.54 mm Hg (95% CI 
–6.04 to –3.03 mm Hg) for individuals with 20% 
risk or higher at baseline, –3.16 mm Hg (95% CI 
–3.84 to –2.47 mm Hg) for those with 10%–20% 
risk at baseline, and –2.16 mm Hg (95% CI –2.46 
to –1.86 mm Hg) for those with less than 10% 
risk at baseline. 
Table 3 presents the impact of Health Check 
attendance on blood pressure, BMI and total 
chol 
esterol stratified by individual risk factor lev-
els at baseline. Health Check attendance was 
associated with significant decreases in all 3 risk 
factors after matching, with those who had ele-
vated risk levels at baseline experiencing the 
greatest reduction, except for BMI. For example, 
Health Check attendees with elevated blood pres-
sure at baseline experienced a greater reduction 
in systolic blood pressure than those with normal 
blood pressure at baseline (–3.22 mm Hg 
[95% CI –3.63 to –2.81 mm Hg] v. –1.20 mm Hg 
[95% CI –1.51 to –0.89 mm Hg]).
Prescribing of statins 
and antihypertensive medications
Before the intervention, Health Check attendees 
were more likely than nonattendees to receive a 
prescription for a statin (9.7% v. 3.1%) or an anti-
hypertensive medication (4.8% v. 1.8%) (Table 2). 
After matching, Health Check attendance was 
associated with significantly greater absolute 
increases in prescribing of statins (+3.83%, 95% 
CI +3.52% to +4.14%) and antihypertensive medi-
cations (+1.37%, 95% CI +1.08% to +1.66%) 
(Table 2). Statin prescribing increased significantly 
among Health Check attendees, irrespective of 
modelled cardiovascular risk at baseline (Figure 2, 
Appendix 4). However, the increases were greatest 
among Health Check attendees with cardiovascu-
lar risk 20% or higher at baseline (+15.2%,

+8.24%) and those at less than 10% risk (+2.23%, 
95% CI +1.94% to +2.52%). The level of prescrib-
ing for Health Check attendees remained low after 
the intervention, with prescribing of statins and 
antihypertensive medications for only 39.9% and 
23.4%, respectively, of attendees with cardio-
vascular risk of 20% or higher at baseline.
Diagnosis of vascular disease
During the study period, a vascular disease was 
diagnosed in 6.4% (1 894/29 672) of the Health 
Check attendees and 1.3% (1 465/109 116) of 
the nonattendees. Table 4 shows that, after 
matching, the following diseases were diag-
nosed significantly more frequently among 
Health Check attendees: 0.17% (95% CI 0.11% 
to 0.23%) for chronic kidney disease, 0.09% 
(95% CI 0.07% to 0.11%) for familial hyper-
cholesterolemia, 2.99% (95% CI 2.77% to 
3.21%) for hypertension, 0.03% (95% CI 
0.01% to 0.05%) for peripheral vascular disease 
and 1.31% (95% CI 1.17% to 1.45%) for type 2 
diabetes mellitus (where the values shown are 
matching estimators of the differences between 
attendees and nonattendees). There was no sig-
nificant increase in diagnosis of atrial fibrilla-

Comparison with complete case analysis
In the complete case analysis, Health Check 
attendees did not experience a significant reduction 
in modelled cardiovascular risk after matching 
(Appendices 5 and 6, available at www.cmaj 
.ca 
/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151201 
/-/DC1). 
Reductions in individual risk factor levels among 
Health Check attendees were broadly comparable 
in the complete case and main (imputed) analyses 
(Appendices 5, 7 and 8, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151201/-/DC1). 
Interpretation
In this national evaluation based on routine pri-
mary care data, we found that attendance of the 
Health Check program was associated with sta-
tistically significant but clin 
ically modest overall 
reductions in modelled cardiovascular risk and 
individual risk factors (except for smoking prev-
alence). Reductions in modelled cardio 
vascular 
risk, diastolic blood pressure, BMI and total 
chol 
esterol were similar for all Health Check 
attendees, irrespective of modelled cardio-
vascular risk levels at baseline. Levels of medi-
cation prescribing remained suboptimal for 
Health Check attendees at high cardiovascular 
risk. The program resulted in significantly more 
diagnoses of selected vascular diseases among 
attendees, with the largest increases for hyper-
tension and type 2 diabetes.
Evaluation of cardiovascular risk assessment 
and management programs in routine care set-
tings is limited. Si and colleagues44 performed a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of the 
effectiveness of general health checks on surro-
gate outcomes (systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, BMI and total cholesterol) using sev-
eral randomized controlled trials, including the 
Oxford and Collaborators Health CHECK Trial 
(OXCHECK) and EUROACTION studies, the 
British Family Heart Study and a trial from 
Denmark. The meta-analysis showed that 
practice-based health checks were associated 
with significant and beneficial effects favouring 
the intervention group, and the result was con-
sistent across all studies, but the magnitude of 
changes in surrogate outcomes remained uncer-
tain because of the limited number of studies 
available.44 Although the design and content 
(e.g., invitation methods, age of the population, 
duration and method of follow-up) of those ran-
domized controlled trials are not directly com-
parable to characteristics of the Health Check 
program, our findings are consistent with those 
reported in the meta-analysis,44 with signifi-
cantly greater reductions in blood pressure, 
BMI and total cholesterol being observed 
among Health Check attendees. Our findings 
are also consistent with 2 previous evaluations 
of local Health Check programs in England,

which showed significant reductions in mod-
elled cardiovascular risk and individual risk 
factors (except for BMI) at 1 year after the 
intervention among those who attended a 
Health Check.15,16
Our findings raise a question about the 
potential contribution of risk assessment and 
management programs to achieving interna-
tional targets for cardiovascular mortality 
reduction, especially in low-resource settings 
and in countries where similar programs have 
not been deployed. The performance of the 
Health Check program has fallen well short of 
national and international performance targets 
for cardiovascular risk assessment programs. 
This outcome may be due to several factors, 
including poor initial planning of the program 
and inadequate engagement of health care pro-
fessionals and the public about potential pro-
gram benefits.45,46 A recent study reported that 
one-third of nonattendees did not receive invi-
tations, while other nonattendees suggested that 
they lacked information about and understand-
ing of the program.46 Inflexible appointment 
times and venues were also identified as bar-
riers to accessing the program.45,46 
In a previous study, we found important 
variations in program performance, including 
variations in coverage between geographic 
areas and lower coverage among younger per-
sons and those from a black African or Chinese 
ethnic background.24 Early modelling of the 
Health Check program undertaken by the Eng-
lish Department of Health indicated that the 
program would need to achieve 75% coverage, 
with 85% of high-risk attendees receiving 
statins, to be cost-effective.47 At the interna-
tional level, the World Health Organization has 
set a target for risk assessment programs of 
50% of individuals with high risk for cardio-
vascular disease receiving drug therapy.1 The 
Health Check program failed to meet all of 
these targets, with only 21.4% coverage, and 
only 39.9% of high-risk patients receiving 
statins. These findings are concerning, given 
that the program is being delivered in the con-
text of a universal health care system with well-
developed primary care and high penetration of 
electronic medical records.
Strengths and limitations
The Health Check program has been criticized 
because it has not been subjected to a randomized 
controlled trial.48 However, public health agen-
cies in England opted to roll out the program 
nationally and have emphasized the value of 
observational studies for policy evaluation.49 We 
employed a robust quasi-experimental study 
design to evaluate the Health Check program, an 
approach that permits causal inference of the pro-
gram’s impacts.38 Although we cannot rule out 
completely the possibility of bias, we used robust 
matching, which ensured that the baseline out-
comes were similar between groups. This method 
should reduce bias, including regression to the 
mean, adequately. Use of alternative experimen-
tal designs, such as interrupted time series, was 
not feasible because of incompleteness of the risk 
factor data (such data would be required to gener-
ate time trends in our outcome measures).

The study’s limitations included missing risk 
factor data, which we addressed by means of 
multiple imputation. This approach is robust 
when data are missing at random, and we justi-
fied using this method by including all variables 
that might be predictive of the missing risk fac-
tors in our dataset.41,50 Nonetheless, the results 
for changes in individual risk factors were 
broadly similar to those from the complete case 
analysis. This study was also limited by poor 
initial coding of Health Check attendance in 
general practice information systems, because 
of the delay in publicizing a universal code. 
Although this problem may have resulted in 
some misclassification of Health Check atten-
dance in our sample, our definition of atten-
dance has been previously validated.24
Conclusion
Our results highlight the need for careful moni-
toring and evaluation of risk assessment pro-
grams for cardiovascular disease internation-
ally. They also emphasize the need for 
high-quality research to identify effective strat-
egies to improve program performance.
