Great American Smokeout — 
November 15, 2018
The American Cancer Society’s 43rd annual Great 
American Smokeout will be held on November 15, 
2018. The Great American Smokeout is an annual event 
that encourages smokers to make a plan to quit smoking 
(https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/
great-american-smokeout.html).
A report in this issue of MMWR (1) indicates that in 
2017, 14.0% of U.S. adults were current cigarette smok-
ers, the lowest prevalence recorded since monitoring 
began in 1965. Nonetheless, smoking remains the leading 
preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the 
United States (2). Each year, an estimated 480,000 U.S. 
adults die from cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke 
exposure (2).
Smokers can and do quit smoking: former smokers now 
outnumber current smokers (2). Among current U.S. adult 
smokers, nearly two out of three want to quit smoking, and 
approximately half made a quit attempt in the preceding 
year (2). Getting effective help through counseling and 
use of medications can increase the chances of quitting 
by as much as threefold (3).
Information and support for quitting smoking is 
available at 800-QUIT-NOW (800–784–8669). CDC’s 
Tips From Former Smokers campaign offers additional 
resources (https://www.cdc.gov/tips).

Cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body 
and causes adverse health consequences, including heart 
disease, stroke, and multiple types of cancer (1). Although 
cigarette smoking among U.S. adults has declined consider-
ably, tobacco products have evolved in recent years to include 
various combustible, noncombustible, and electronic products 
(1,2). To assess recent national estimates of tobacco product 
use among U.S. adults aged ≥18 years, CDC, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of 
Health’s National Cancer Institute analyzed data from the 
2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). In 2017, an

estimated 47.4 million U.S. adults (19.3%) currently used any 
tobacco product, including cigarettes (14.0%; 34.3 million); 
cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars (3.8%; 9.3 million); 
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) (2.8%; 6.9 million); smoke-
less tobacco (2.1%; 5.1 million); and pipes, water pipes, or 
hookahs (1.0%; 2.6 million). Among current tobacco product 
users, 86.7% (41.1 million) smoked combustible tobacco prod-
ucts, and 19.0% (9.0 million) used ≥2 tobacco products. By 
univariate analyses, the prevalence of current use of any tobacco 
product was higher among males than among females; adults 
aged <65 years than among those aged ≥65 years; non-Hispanic 
American Indian/Alaska Natives, whites, blacks, or multiracial 
adults than among Hispanics or non-Hispanic Asians; adults 
who lived in the South or Midwest than among those in the 
West or Northeast; adults who had a general educational 
development certificate (GED) than among those with other 
levels of education; adults who earned an annual household 
income of <$35,000 than among those with those with higher 
income; lesbian, gay, or bisexual adults than among hetero-
sexual/straight adults; and adults who were divorced/separated/
widowed or single/never married/not living with a partner 
than among those who were married/living with a partner. 
Prevalence was also higher among those who were uninsured, 
insured by Medicaid, or had some other public insurance than 
among those with private insurance or Medicare only; those 
who had a disability/limitation than among those who did 
not; and those who had serious psychological distress than 
among those who did not. Full implementation of evidence-
based tobacco control interventions that address the diversity 
of tobacco products used by U.S. adults, in coordination with 
regulation of tobacco product manufacturing, marketing, 
and sales, can reduce tobacco-related disease and death in the 
United States (1–3).
NHIS is an annual, nationally representative, in-person 
survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population 
(4). The 2017 Sample Adult component included 26,742 
adults aged ≥18 years; the response rate was 53.0%. Data were 
weighted to adjust for differences in selection probability and 
nonresponse and to provide nationally representative estimates. 
Five tobacco products were assessed: cigarettes; cigars (cigars, 
cigarillos, or filtered little cigars); pipes (regular pipes, water 
pipes, or hookahs)*; e-cigarettes; and smokeless tobacco (chew-
ing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, or dissolvable tobacco). Current 
cigarette smokers were those who reported having smoked 
≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime and smoked every day 
or some days at the time of survey. Current users of all other 
tobacco products were those who reported their use every day 
or some days at the time of survey. Prevalence estimates for 
current use of any tobacco product, any combustible tobacco 
product (cigarettes, cigars, or pipes), and use of ≥2 tobacco 
* The use of regular pipe, water pipe, or hookah was assessed together using a 
single question. Interviewers could read the following sentences if necessary: 
“A hookah is a type of water pipe. It is sometimes called a ‘narghile’ (NAR-ge-lee) 
pipe. Do not include electronic hookahs or e-hookahs”; “Do not include 
electronic pipes or e-pipes.”

products† were calculated. Estimates were calculated overall 
and separately by sex, age, race/ethnicity, U.S. region,§ educa-
tion, marital status, annual household income, sexual orienta-
tion,¶ health insurance coverage,** disability,†† and presence 
of serious psychological distress.§§ T-tests were performed to 
assess overall differences in tobacco use between 2016 and 
2017, with statistical significance defined as p<0.05.¶¶
Among U.S. adults in 2017, 19.3% (estimated 47.4 million) 
currently used any tobacco product and 16.7% (41.1 million; 
 † Current use of ≥2 tobacco products was defined as use either every day or some 
days of at least two or more of the following tobacco products: cigarettes (≥100 
cigarettes during lifetime); cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars; pipes, water 
pipes, or hookahs; electronic cigarettes; or smokeless tobacco products.
 § Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, 
South Dakota, and Wisconsin. South: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District 
of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and 
West Virginia. West: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, 
Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.
 ¶ Sexual orientation was determined using the question “Which of the following 
best represents how you think of yourself?” Response options included “gay,” 
“straight, that is, not gay,” “bisexual,” “something else,” and “I don’t know the 
answer” among male respondents, and “lesbian or gay,” “straight, that is, not 
lesbian or gay,” “bisexual, “something else,” and “I don’t know the answer” 
among female respondents. Respondents were considered to be lesbian, gay, 
or bisexual if they responded “gay,” “lesbian or gay,” or “bisexual.”
 
** Private coverage: includes adults who had any comprehensive private insurance plan 
(including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations). 
Medicaid: for adults aged <65 years, includes those who did not have private coverage, 
but who had Medicaid or other state-sponsored health plans, including Children’s 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP). For adults aged ≥65 years, includes adults aged 
≥65 years who did not have any private coverage but had Medicare and Medicaid or 
other state-sponsored health plans including CHIP; Medicare only: includes adults 
aged ≥65 years who only had Medicare coverage; Other coverage: includes adults who 
did not have private insurance, Medicaid, or other public coverage, but who had any 
type of military coverage, coverage from other government programs, or Medicare. 
Uninsured: includes adults who did not indicate that they were covered at the time of 
the interview under private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP
, a state-
sponsored health plan, other government programs, or military coverage.
 
†† Disability status was defined on the basis of self-reported presence of selected limitations, 
including vision, hearing, cognition, and movement. Limitations in performing 
activities of daily living were defined using the question “Does [person] have difficulty 
dressing or bathing?” Limitations in performing instrumental activities of daily living 
were defined on the basis of responses to the question “Because of a physical, mental, 
or emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty doing errands alone such as 
visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?” Any disability was defined as a “yes” response 
pertaining to at least one of the limitations listed (vision, hearing, cognition, movement, 
activities of daily living, or instrumental activities of daily living). A random sample of 
half of the respondents from the 2017 Person File was asked about limitations, and 
weights from the Family Disability Questions File were applied.
 
§§ The Kessler psychological distress scale is a series of six questions that ask about 
feelings of hopelessness, sadness, nervousness, restlessness, worthlessness, and 
feeling like everything is an effort in the past 30 days. Participants were asked to 
respond on a Likert Scale ranging from “None of the time” (score = 0) to “All of 
the time” (score = 4). Responses were summed over the six questions; persons with 
a score of ≥13 were coded as having serious psychological distress, and respondents 
with a score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress.
 
¶¶ NHIS 2016 data were incorporated to inform statistically significant 
differences during 2016–2017 for the use of any tobacco product, any 
combustible tobacco product, ≥2 tobacco products, cigarettes, cigars, pipes, 
e-cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco. The 2016 Sample Adult component 
included 26,742 adults aged ≥18 years; the response rate was 54.3%.
86.7% of current tobacco users) used any combustible tobacco 
product (Table). Cigarettes were the most commonly used 
tobacco product (14.0%; 34.3 million), with the prevalence of 
cigarette smoking in 2017 being the lowest measured among 
U.S. adults since NHIS data collection for this measure began 
in 1965 (Figure 1). Prevalence estimates of other tobacco 
products in 2017 were as follows: cigars (3.8%; 9.3 mil-
lion); e-cigarettes (2.8%; 6.9 million); smokeless tobacco 
(2.1%; 5.1 million); and pipes (1.0%; 2.6 million). During 
2016–2017, declines occurred in current use of any tobacco 
product; any combustible tobacco product; ≥2 tobacco prod-
ucts; cigarettes; and smokeless tobacco (all p<0.05). Among 
current tobacco product users, the proportion who were daily 
users was 75.0% for cigarettes, 58.2% for smokeless tobacco, 
40.5% for e-cigarettes, 12.4% for cigars, and 10.6% for pipes.
Overall, 3.7% of U.S. adults (9.0 million; 19.0% of current 
tobacco product users) used ≥2 tobacco products. Among 
multiple tobacco product users, 84.1% used two products, 
13.4% used three products, and 2.5% used four or more 
products. The most prevalent tobacco product combinations 
were cigarettes and e-cigarettes (30.1%), followed by cigarettes 
and cigars (29.2%) (Figure 2).
By univariate analyses, the prevalence of any current 
tobacco product use was higher among males (24.8%) than 
among females (14.2%); those aged 25–44 years (22.5%), 
45–64 years (21.3%), or 18–24 years (18.3%) than among 
those aged ≥65 years (11.0%); non-Hispanic American Indian/
Alaska Natives (29.8%), multiracial adults (27.4%), whites 
(21.4%), or blacks (20.1%) than among Hispanics (12.7%) or 
non-Hispanic Asians (8.9%); those who lived in the Midwest 
(23.5%) or the South (20.8%) than among those who lived 
in the West (15.9%) or Northeast (15.6%); those who had a 
GED (42.6%) than among those with other levels of educa-
tion; those who were divorced/separated/widowed (23.1%) or 
single/never married/not living with a partner (21.0%) than 
among those married/living with a partner (17.6%); those 
who had annual household income of <$35,000 (26.0%) 
than among those with higher income; and lesbian, gay, or 
bisexual adults (27.3%) than among heterosexual/straight 
adults (19.0%). Prevalence was also higher among those who 
were uninsured (31.0%), insured by Medicaid (28.2%) or had 
some other public insurance (26.8%) than among those with 
private insurance (16.2%) or Medicare only (11.0%); those 
who had a disability/limitation (25.0%) than among those 
who did not (18.8%); and those who had serious psychologi-
cal distress (40.8%) than among those who did not (18.5%).

 †††† Disability status  was defined on the basis of self-reported presence of selected limitations including vision, hearing, cognition, and movement. Limitations in 
performing activities of daily living were defined using  the question “Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing?” Limitations in performing instrumental 
activities of daily living were defined on the basis of responses to the question “Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty 
doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?” Any disability was defined as a “yes”  response pertaining to at least one of the limitations 
listed (vision, hearing, cognition, movement, activities of daily living, or instrumental activities of daily living). A random sample of half of the respondents from 
the 2017 Person File was  asked about limitations and weights from the Family Disability Questions File were applied.
 
§§§§ Based on the Kessler psychological distress scale, a series of six questions that ask about feelings of hopelessness, sadness, nervousness, restlessness, worthlessness, 
and feeling like everything is an effort in the past 30 days. Participants were asked to respond on a Likert Scale ranging from “None of the time” (score = 0) to “All 
of the time” (score = 4). Responses were summed over the six questions; persons with a score of ≥13 were coded as having serious psychological distress, and 
respondents with a score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress.
estimated 14.0% of U.S. adults (34.3 million) were current 
cigarette smokers in 2017, representing a 67% decline since 
1965. However, in 2017, nearly nine in 10 (41.1 million) adult 
tobacco product users reported using a combustible tobacco 
product, with cigarettes being the product most commonly 
used. The burden of death and disease from tobacco use in the 
United States is caused overwhelmingly by cigarettes and other 
combustible products, and an estimated 480,000 U.S. adults 
die from cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure 
each year (1). Therefore, continued efforts to reduce all forms 
of combustible tobacco smoking, including cigarettes, among 
U.S. adults are especially important (1).

U.S. adults also report using various noncigarette tobacco 
products. In 2017, approximately one in five adults (47.4 mil-
lion) currently used any tobacco product, and 19.0% of these 
adults reported multiple tobacco product use. Multiple tobacco 
product users are at increased risk for nicotine addiction and 
dependence (1,5). E-cigarettes were commonly used among 
multiple tobacco product users. Primary reasons for e-cigarette 
use among adults include curiosity, flavoring, cost, consider-
ation of others, convenience, and simulation of cigarettes, as 
well as to attempt to quit smoking (6). However, although 
e-cigarettes could benefit adult smokers if used as a complete 
substitute for combustible tobacco smoking, evidence of the 
effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a cessation aid is inconclusive (7).
Demographic variations in tobacco product use were 
observed. For example, young adults reported the highest use 
of emerging products such as e-cigarettes and pipes; the higher 
prevalence of overall pipe use among young adults is likely pri-
marily driven by water pipe or hookah use (1). Differences in 
tobacco product use across population groups might be related 
to multiple factors, including targeted advertising, differing 
perceptions regarding the relative harm or social acceptability 
of tobacco use, and differences in tobacco product prices and 
levels of access to cessation resources (1,2).

* For NHIS  years 1965–1991, current smokers included adults who reported that they had smoked ≥100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoked. Since 1992, 
current smokers included adults who reported smoking ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime and specified that they currently smoked every day or on some days. 
Data are not available for 1967–1969, 1971–1973, 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1989, and 1996 because questions regarding smoking were not included in the 
NHIS conducted in those years. Related data and documentation can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/data-questionnaires-documentation.htm.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Although cigarette smoking among U.S. adults has declined 
considerably, tobacco products have evolved in recent years 
to include various combustible, non-combustible, and 
electronic products.
What is added by this report?
In 2017, an estimated 47.4 million U.S. adults (19.3%) currently used 
any tobacco product. Among current tobacco product users, 86.7% 
(41.1 million) smoked combustible tobacco products, and 19.0% 
(9.0 million) used two or more tobacco products.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Implementation of evidence-based tobacco control interven-
tions that address the diversity of tobacco products used by U.S. 
adults, in coordination with regulation of tobacco product 
manufacturing, marketing, and sales, can reduce tobacco-
related disease and death in the United States.

* For cigarettes, current smokers were defined as persons who had smoked ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime and now smoked either every day or some days. Current 
users of all other assessed tobacco products were defined as persons who reported use of each respective product every day or some days at the time of survey.
† Percentages were calculated among adults who currently used ≥2 of the following five tobacco product types: cigarettes; cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars (cigars); 
regular pipes, water pipes, or hookahs (pipes); chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, or dissolvable tobacco (smokeless tobacco); and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
§ A total of 26 distinct combinations were assessed (10 two-product type combinations; 10 three-product type combinations; 5 four-product type combinations, and 
1 five-product type combination).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, the potential for recall bias exists because 
responses were self-reported and not biochemically validated. 
However, self-reported smoking status correlates highly with 
serum cotinine levels (8). Second, the questionnaire did not 
assess gender identity; including transgender persons could 
affect overall tobacco use estimates among the sexual and 
gender minorities considered in this report. Third, NHIS 
estimates are not generalizable to persons in the military or 
institutionalized populations. Finally, the NHIS Sample Adult 
component’s response rate of 53.0% might have resulted in 
nonresponse bias.
Full implementation of comprehensive tobacco control 
programs at the national, state, and local levels, including 
tobacco price increases, high-impact anti-tobacco mass media 
campaigns, comprehensive smoke-free laws,*** and barrier-free 
access to tobacco cessation counseling and approved medica-
tions, along with FDA regulation of tobacco products, can 
accelerate progress toward reducing tobacco-related death and

private-sector worksites, restaurants, and bars. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/

disease in the United States (3). Given the increasing diversity 
of available tobacco products, coordinated efforts are key to 
implementing proven strategies while also exploring promis-
ing new strategies. For example, CDC supports the National 
Tobacco Control Program (3), and the Tips From Former 
Smokers campaign, which led to approximately half a million 
sustained quits among U.S. adult smokers during 2012–2015 
(9). FDA launched the Every Try Counts campaign in 2018, 
which targets adults aged 25–54 years who have attempted 
to quit smoking in the last year but were unsuccessful. The 
campaign also complements FDA’s recently announced plan to 
explore reducing nicotine content in cigarettes to minimally or 
nonaddictive levels (10). The National Cancer Institute sup-
ports research to improve tobacco dependence treatment and 
provides resources to help smokers quit, including Smokefree.
gov; the toll-free national quitline network (1-800-QUIT-
NOW); and LiveHelp online. These coordinated strategies, 
in combination with state and local level tobacco prevention 
and control strategies that address the diversity of tobacco 
products, can reduce tobacco related disease and death in the 
United States (1).
