Abstract
Objective: Neuroinflammatory responses are implicated in depression. The aim was to 
explore whether depression in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) was associated with 
high circulating galectin-3, controlling for metabolic variables, s-creatinine, life style 
factors, medication and cardiovascular complications.
Design: Cross-sectional.
Methods: Participants were T1D patients (n = 283, 56% men, age 18–59 years, diabetes 
duration ≥1 year). Depression was assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-
depression subscale. Blood samples, anthropometrics and blood pressure were collected, 
and supplemented with data from medical records and the Swedish National Diabetes 
Registry. Galectin-3 ≥2.562 µg/l, corresponding to the 85th percentile, was defined as 
high galectin-3.
Results: Median (quartile1, quartile3) galectin-3 (µg/l) was 1.3 (0.8, 2.9) for the 30 
depressed patients, and 0.9 (0.5, 1.6) for the 253 non-depressed, P = 0.009. Depression 
was associated with high galectin-3 in all the 283 patients (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 
3.5), in the 161 men (AOR 3.4), and in the 122 women (AOR 3.9). HbA1c, s-lipids, 
s-creatinine, blood pressure, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, cardiovascular 
complications and drugs (antihypertensive, lipid lowering, oral antidiabetic drugs and 
antidepressants) were not associated with high galectin-3.
Conclusions: This is the first study to show an association between depression and 
galectin-3. Depression was the only explored parameter associated with high circulating 
galectin-3 levels in 283 T1D patients. High galectin-3 levels might contribute to the 
increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality observed in 
persons with depression. Potentially, in the future, treatment targeting galactin-3 might 
improve the prognosis for patients with high galectin-3 levels.
Introduction
Depression is associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 
Alzheimer’s disease, increased coronary heart disease and 
both coronary and all-cause mortality (1, 2, 3). T1D has a 
serious impact on mental health, indicated by the more 
than doubled relative risk rate for suicide in persons with 
T1D (4). Several biological links between depression and 
somatic disorders have been demonstrated including 
metabolic changes, dysregulation of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis and activation of the innate immune 
system causing systemic inflammation (2, 3, 5, 6, 7).

Depression, type 1 diabetes 
and galectin-3
820
7:6
We have previously shown in these patients with T1D 
that depression was associated with inadequate glycaemic 
control (8), and with high midnight salivary cortisol 
secretion (9, 10), but not with obesity (11).
Galectin-3 is a soluble β-galactoside binding lectin, 
which is expressed in several cells such as activated 
macrophages, microglia, mast cells and in tissues such as 
subsets of neurons in the brain, the heart, the epithelium 
of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and the 
kidney (12, 13, 14). Galectin-3 is implicated in a variety 
of biological processes including immune activation, 
fibrosis, angiogenesis and neurodegeneration (12, 14, 15, 
16, 17, 18).
Higher circulating galectin-3 concentrations have 
been associated with heart failure independent of 
aetiology, and with increased cardiovascular and all-
cause mortality in the general population (14, 19, 20, 21). 
Galectin-3 has pleiotropic effects in CNS inflammation, 
combining pro-inflammatory roles with remodelling 
capacity 
in 
damaged 
CNS 
tissues 
(16). 
Experimental 
studies 
have shown that galectin-3 contributes to microglial 
activation and prolonged inflammatory responses in 
the brain (17). In Alzheimer’s disease, increased levels 
of serum galectin-3 have been demonstrated (15). 
Significant associations have previously been found 
between galectin-3 and age, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, triglycerides, LDL, 
BMI, renal dysfunction and smoking (19, 21, 22, 23). 
Metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus has, however, been 
linked to lower galectin-3 levels (22). Even though the 
main focus of galectin-3 has been on its function as a 
proinflammatory mediator, there are also studies showing 
galectin-3 acting as a decoy to advanced glycation end-
products which could indicate some kind of protective 
function in patients with diabetes (24).
Our hypothesis was that depression is associated 
with high galectin-3 levels in patients with T1D as 
neuroinflammatory processes are implicated in depression 
(2, 3, 5, 7), and since both galectin-3 and depression have 
been linked to Alzheimer’s disease, as well as to increased 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (1, 2, 14, 17, 19, 20, 
21). To our knowledge, galectin-3 has not previously been 
explored in depressed patients or in patients with T1D. 
The aim was to explore whether depression in patients 
with T1D was associated with galectin-3, and control 
for metabolic variables, s-creatinine, medication and 
cardiovascular complications. This knowledge could add 
to our current understanding of depression in T1D and 
prepare for better diagnostic or treatment strategies in the 
future.
Subjects and methods
This study has a cross-sectional design and is one of five 
baseline analyses (8, 9, 10, 11) for a randomized controlled 
trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01714986) where ‘Affect School 
with Script Analysis’ was tried against ‘Basic Body Awareness 
Therapy’ for persons with diabetes, inadequate glycaemic 
control and psychological symptoms (25, 26). The patients 
who attend the clinic every 6 months for regular follow-up 
visits were consecutively recruited by specialist diabetes 
physicians or diabetes nurses during a 9-month period, 
25 March 2009 to 28 December 2009, from one hospital 
diabetes outpatient clinic. The catchment population was 
125,000 in southern Sweden. Inclusion criteria were T1D 
with ≥1-year duration, in patients of 18–59 years of age. 
Exclusion criteria were cancer, hepatic failure, end-stage 
renal disease, psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, severe 
personality disorder, severe substance abuse, cognitive 
deficiency (due to stroke, dementia or mental retardation) 
or inadequate knowledge of Swedish. In this study, 283 
persons with T1D were included, 65% of the eligible patients 
(Fig. 1). A questionnaire was used to assess self-reported 
depression. Blood and saliva samples, anthropometrics 
and blood pressure were collected and supplemented 
with data from medical records and the Swedish National 
Diabetes Registry (S-NDR) (27, 28). In case of missing values, 
galectin-3 levels were compared between patients with and 
without the missing values. The study complies with the 
declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Regional 
Ethical Review Board of Linköping University, Linköping, 
Sweden (Registration no. M120-07, T89-08). All participants 
provided written informed consent.
Self-reported depression
Self-reported depression was assessed by the Hospital 
Anxiety 
and 
Depression 
Scale-Depression 
subscale 
(HADS-D) which consists of 7 statements, with 4 response 
alternatives from 0 to 3. The cut-off level ≥8 points was 
used as recommended by the constructors of the test (29). 
HADS-D is a useful instrument for detecting symptoms of 
depression, both at an individual and a collective level, 
and has been demonstrated to have a good reliability and 
discriminant validity (30). Imputation of a missing value 
was performed in one case.
Blood samples
Galectin-3 was analysed using a commercial human 
DuoSet 
ELISA 
and 
supplementary 
ancillary 
kit

(R&D Systems). Patient plasma samples were diluted 1:2 
in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and run in duplicates. 
The ELISA analysis was performed according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured 
at 450–580 
nm in a FLUOstar optima plate reader (BMG 
Labtech Gmbh, Ortenberg, Germany). Concentrations of 
unknown samples were calculated using a four-parameter 
logistic regression curve. The intra-assay coefficient of 
variation for the analysis was 4.3%.
Galectin-3 was available for 283 patients (65% 
of the eligible patients) (Fig. 1). Galectin-3 (µg/l) was 
dichotomized, and cut-off levels were determined for 
the 75th, the 80th, the 85th and the 90th percentiles. 
Galectin-3 ≥2.562 
µg/l, corresponding to the 85th 
percentile, was defined as high galectin-3, and was used 
in the further statistical analyses.
The 283 patients with galectin-3 measurements 
were compared to the 9 patients without galectin-3 
measurements. There were no differences for the 
prevalence 
of 
self-reported 
depression, 
abdominal 
obesity, general obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, 
cardiovascular 
complications, 
antidepressants, 
oral 
antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in addition to insulin, lipid 
lowering drugs (LLDs) or antihypertensive drugs (AHD); 
or for the medians of HbA1c, s-lipids, creatinine, systolic 
or diastolic blood pressure, age or diabetes duration (all P 
values ≥0.09).
Venous HbA1c (mmol/mol (%)) was analysed with 
HPLC – variant II, Turbo analyser (Bio-Rad). High HbA1c 
levels were defined as HbA1c >70 
mmol/mol (>8.6%) (8).
Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, LDL and HDL 
(mmol/l) were collected after an overnight fast, and

measured directly (31), using the enzymatic colour test 
(Olympus AU®, Tokyo, Japan).
Creatinine (µmol/l) was assayed by an AU2700® 
instrument (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).
Anthropometrics and blood pressure
Waist circumference (WC), weight, length and blood 
pressure were measured according to standard procedures 
by a nurse. Abdominal obesity was defined as WC ≥1.02 
m 
for men and as WC ≥0.88 
m for women. General obesity 
was defined as BMI ≥30 
kg/m2 for both genders (32). 
Galectin-3 levels did not differ between the 6 patients 
without and the 277 patients with WC measurements 
(P 
= 
0.67), and did not differ between the two patients 
without and the 281 patients with BMI values (P 
= 
0.11).
Episodes of hypoglycaemia
A severe episode of hypoglycaemia was defined as needing 
help from another person. Episodes during the last 
6 months prior to recruitment were registered.
Smoking and physical inactivity
Smokers were defined as having smoked any amount of 
tobacco during the last year.
Physical inactivity was defined as moderate activities, 
such as 30 
min of walking, less than once a week. There 
were 17 missing values both for smoking and for physical 
inactivity. Galectin-3 levels did not differ between the 17 
without data and the 266 with data, neither for smoking 
(P 
= 
0.72) nor for physical inactivity (P 
= 
0.87).
Cardiovascular complications
Cardiovascular complications were defined as ischaemic 
heart disease, cardiac failure, stroke or transient ischemic 
attack.
Medication
Antidepressants 
were 
selective 
serotonin 
reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors 
(SNRIs) 
and/or 
specific 
serotonergic 
antidepressants (N06AB, N06AX16, N06AX11).
Diabetes specific treatment was divided into two 
groups: Insulin only (multiple daily insulin injections 
or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion), or insulin 
combined with OAD (ATC code A10BA02). The indications 
for OAD prescription in addition to insulin were obesity 
or insulin resistance.
LLD were HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) 
(C10AA). Indications for LLD were TC >4.5 
mmol/l 
(>1.74 
mg/dl) 
and/or 
LDL 
>2.5 
mmol/l 
(>97 
mg/dl) 
according to the Swedish national guidelines in 2009 (33).
AHD were calcium antagonists (ATC codes C08CA01-
02); ACE inhibitors (ATC codes C09AA-BA); angiotensin II 
antagonists (ATC codes C09CA-DA); diuretics (ATC code 
C03A); and/or selective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists 
(ATC code C07AB). Indications for AHD were systolic 
blood pressure >130 
mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 
>80 
mmHg according to the Swedish national guidelines 
in 2009 (33).
Statistical analysis
Analysis of data distribution using histograms revealed 
that age, diabetes duration, galectin-3 and triglycerides 
were not normally distributed. Data were presented 
as median values (quartile (q1, q3)), and analyses were 
performed with Mann–Whitney U test. Fisher’s exact 
tTest (two-tailed) was used to analyse categorical data. In 
order to establish a cut-off level for galectin-3, the 75th, 
80th, 85th and 90th percentiles of galectin-3 were entered 
into a backward elimination multiple logistic regression 
analysis with self-reported depression as the dependent 
variable. Crude odds ratios (CORs) for the associations 
with galectin-3 ≥2.562 
µg/l (corresponding to the 85th 
percentile) were calculated. Variables with P 
≤ 
0.10, and 
gender and age independent of P value, were entered 
into multiple logistic regression analyses (Backward: 
Wald). The Hosmer and Lemeshow test for goodness-of-
fit and Nagelkerke R2 were used to evaluate each multiple 
logistic regression analysis model. CIs of 95% were used. 
Imputation for a missing value in the HADS-D scale was 
performed using multinomial regression on the other 
variables in the scale in one case. P 
< 
0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. SPSS version 18 (IBM) was used. 
Results
Median (q1, q3) galectin-3 (µg/l) levels were for all (n 
= 
283) 
0.9 (0.6, 1.7); for the men (n 
= 
161) 1.0 (0.6, 2.0), and for 
the women (n 
= 
122) 0.9 (0.5, 1.4), P 
=

the depressed patients compared to the non-depressed, 
P 
= 
0.009. The prevalence of cardiovascular complications 
was higher in the depressed patients than in the non-
depressed, P 
= 
0.014.
In Table 2, the prevalence of depression is presented 
for four different galectin-3 cut-off levels, corresponding 
to the 75th, the 80th, the 85th and the 90th percentiles 
of galectin-3. The P values were significant for the 
85th percentile (P 
= 
0.006), and for the 80th percentile 
(P 
= 
0.026). The association between depression and the 
85th percentile of galectin-3 was significant (AOR 3.5 (CI 
1.5-8.0), P 
= 
0.004), but not between depression and the 
following percentiles of galectin-3: the 75th (AOR 0.8 (CI 
0.2-3.5), P 
= 
0.73), the 80th (AOR 1.2 (CI 0.1-20.3), P 
= 
0.92) 
or the 90th percentile (AOR 0.7 (CI 0.2-2.3), P 
= 
0.61).
In Table 3, baseline characteristics for all the 283 
T1D patients, and comparisons between the 42 patients 
with galectin-3 levels ≥2.562 
µg/l and the 241 patients 
with galectin-3 levels <2.562 
µg/l are presented. Patients 
with galectin-3 ≥2.562 
µg/l had a higher prevalence of 
cardiovascular complications (P 
= 
0.045).
In 
Table 
4, 
associations 
with 
high 
galectin-3 
(≥2.562 
µg/l) are presented. Depression was associated 
with high galectin-3 in all the 283 patients (AOR 3.5), in 
the 161 men (AOR 3.4), and in the 122 women (AOR 3.9). 
Cardiovascular complications were only associated with 
high galectin-3 in simple logistic regression (COR 4.1), but 
not when age, depression and gender were included in the 
analysis.
In all the 283 patients, the association between 
cardiovascular 
complications 
and 
depression 
was 
significant: COR (CI), 6.6 (1.7-24.8), P 
= 
0.005; and 
between cardiovascular complications and age: COR (CI), 
1.18 (1.06-1.31), P 
= 
0.003; but not between cardiovascular 
complications and gender, P 
= 
0.77.
Discussion
The main findings were that self-reported depression 
was associated with high galectin-3 (≥2.562 
µg/l) for all, 
and for each gender analysed separately. There were no 
associations between high galectin-3 and the following 
explored variables: HbA1c, s-lipids, blood pressure, 
obesity, s-creatinine, drugs (antidepressants, OADs, LLDs 
or AHDs) or cardiovascular complications. There was a 
strong association between depression and cardiovascular 
complications.
The association between depression and high 
galectin-3 in patients with T1D is a new finding. To 
our knowledge, galectin-3 has neither been explored in 
patients with T1D previously, nor has the association 
between galectin-3 and depression been explored. The 
results supported our hypothesis that the depressed 
patients with T1D had higher galectin-3 levels than 
the non-depressed patients. Associations between high 
galectin-3 and potential diabetes-related confounders 
such as HbA1c, obesity, s-lipids, blood pressure, severe 
hypoglycemia, s-creatinine, smoking, physical inactivity, 
cardiovascular complications and drugs (antihypertensive, 
lipid lowering, oral antidiabetic and antidepressants) 
were 
systematically 
explored. 
Gender

well defined. Patients with cognitive deficiencies were 
excluded, so no patients diagnosed with dementia were 
included.
One weakness was the limited number of patients 
within several subgroups. There were only 10 persons 
with cardiovascular complications, and the association 
between cardiovascular complications and high galectin-3 
was not significant when adjusted for depression and 
age. The P value was 0.10 for the association between 
high galectin-3 and cardiovascular complications in the 
six men, indicating that this might be a type 2 error. 
In a larger setting, significant associations between 
cardiovascular complications and high galectin-3 levels 
could be expected (14, 19, 20, 21). Only 14 women and 
16 men had self-reported depression. Despite the low 
number of depressed patients, the associations between 
depression and high galectin-3 were significant for all, 
and for the men and women analysed separately. The 
diagnosis of depression was not confirmed by a structured 
interview. HADS-D has, however, shown high validity for 
assessing depressive symptoms both at an individual and a 
collective level (30). We have also previously found strong 
associations between self-reported depression assessed by 
HADS-D and clinical psychiatric diagnoses, and between 
self-reported depression and antidepressant use in these 
patients (8). Another weakness is that we did not have a 
control group without T1D, but this was not necessary 
for exploring our hypothesis that galectin-3 is higher 
in depressed than in non-depressed patients with T1D. 
One difficulty we had to address in this research was that 
there is no established consensus regarding detrimental 
galectin-3 levels. Therefore, we explored the associations 
between depression and four different galectin-3 cut-off 
levels. In the further analyses, we chose the galectin-3 level 
that corresponded to the 85th percentile of galectin-3, as 
this was the level that showed the highest association with 
depression. Depression is associated with increased risk for 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and with increased 
risk for Alzheimer’s disease (1, 2). According to previous 
research, higher circulating galectin-3 concentrations are 
associated with heart failure independent of aetiology, and 
with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in 
the general population (14, 19, 20, 21). Increased levels 
of serum galectin-3 have also been demonstrated in 
Table 3 Baseline characteristics for all 283 T1D patients, and comparisons between patients with galectin-3 levels below and 
above the 85th percentile.

Depression, type 1 diabetes 
and galectin-3
825
7:6
Alzheimer’s disease (15). Thus, increased galectin-3 levels 
might represent a biological link between depression and 
coronary heart and all-cause mortality, as well as between 
depression and Alzheimer’s disease. However, as this is 
a cross-sectional study, it cannot be deduced whether 
depression is primary or secondary to increased galectin-3 
levels.
We have previously shown that depression was 
associated with high HbA1c (8). In this study, we found 
no associations between high HbA1c and galectin-3, 
indicating that they are two independent biomarkers 
associated 
with 
depression. 
Our 
results 
differ 
from 
previous 
research as we did not find any associations between high 
galectin-3 and age, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
triglycerides, s-LDL, BMI, s-creatinine or smoking (19, 
21, 22, 23). In none of these previous studies had the 
results been controlled for depression, the results might 
have been different if they had. However, it must be 
observed that patients with end-stage renal disease, 
bipolar disorders, psychotic symptoms or stroke with 
secondary cognitive deficiency, were excluded which 
could affect the results in this study. Also, we cannot 
exclude that some of the metabolic variables, creatinine 
or cardiovascular complications could have been 
associated with high galectin-3 if we had chosen another 
galectin-3 cut-off level. There are several unanswered 
questions and subjects for future research. The biology 
of circulating galectin-3 in patients with diabetes and 
depression is uncertain. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 
(MMP-9), which is one of the best described proteases in 
the CNS, targets galectin-3 for cleavage (34). Galectin-3 
is, however, also a positive downstream regulator of 
MMP-9 expression (35). Increased levels of MMP-9 have 
been described during depressive episodes in patients

Depression, type 1 diabetes 
and galectin-3
826
7:6
with bipolar depression (36), in patients with unipolar 
major depressive disorder (37), as well as in the brains of 
persons with Alzheimer’s disease (38). MMP-9 has also 
been suggested to play a main role in synaptic trafficking 
and modification of glutamate receptors, such as the 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (39), which is of particular 
interest when it comes to depression and treatment of 
this condition (40). Future studies should thus focus on 
MMP-9 in addition to galectin-3 in patients with diabetes 
and depression, which might give valuable information 
about the pathogenesis.
Whether galactin-3 could be a good diagnostic marker 
for depression in T1D needs to be further investigated. 
Additional larger studies comparing galectin-3 levels in 
depressed and non-depressed persons, both in persons with 
and without T1D will be necessary, as well as longitudinal 
studies. Can galectin-3 be used for the evaluation of 
the efficacy of the treatment for depression? It would 
be of interest to measure galectin-3 at the initiation of 
antidepressant medication or psychotherapy and follow 
the galectin-3 values during therapy. It would also be of 
interest to explore whether depressed T1D patients with 
high galectin-3 level have increased risk for Alzheimer’s 
disease, renal dysfunction, cardiac failure and mortality. 
Which galectin-3 levels are damaging for the heart, for 
the brain or for the kidneys? For how long can a person 
have increased galectin-3 levels without risking damage 
to the heart or risking the development of Alzheimer’s 
disease? Can galectin-3 be a target for treatment? In 
further research, we suggest that when associations 
between galectin-3 and somatic parameters are explored, 
the results should be adjusted for depression.
In conclusion, depression was the only examined 
variable associated with high circulating galectin-3 
(≥2.562 
µg/l) in the 283 patients with T1D. The 
association between depression and galectin-3 has not 
to our knowledge been explored previously, neither 
in persons with T1D nor in those without T1D. Higher 
galectin-3 levels might contribute to the increased risk for 
Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality 
observed in patients with depression. Potentially, in the 
future, high galectin-3 levels could be used as indicators 
for depression, and treatment targeting galactin-3 might 
be developed to improve the prognosis for patients with 
high galectin-3 levels.
